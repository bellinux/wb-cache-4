5|$|After {{entering}} NSS, {{the pair}} learned that Seung-hee was their undercover scout agent. While the duo was <b>surprised</b> <b>and</b> somewhat hurt, Hyun-jun was angered the most {{as he felt}} his heart was toyed with. During a team celebration dinner, Hyun-jun confronted her alone and the two embraced the passion they have for one another. Afterward, the two maintained a secret romantic relationship without the knowledge of anyone.|$|E
5|$|At 08:40, the {{opposing}} aircraft strike formations passed {{within sight of}} each other. Nine Zeros from Zuihō <b>surprised</b> <b>and</b> attacked the Enterprise group, attacking the climbing aircraft {{from out of the}} sun. In the resulting engagement, four Zeros, three Wildcats, and two TBFs were shot down, with another two TBFs and a Wildcat forced by heavy damage to return to Enterprise.|$|E
5|$|Before her death, Norman {{met with}} each of her followers; she died on July12, 1993, and was cremated. In her will, she promised to return to Earth, {{accompanied}} by the Space Brothers, in eight years. Students, {{some of whom were}} <b>surprised</b> <b>and</b> confused by her death, were instructed by leaders not to grieve because she was in a celestial state. Some of them privately mourned, and a few left the group. Items of Norman's were distributed to students, some of whom wore them at later events.|$|E

5|$|Despite the band's intent, {{a future}} album {{from the group}} was uncertain. On June 12, 2008, Atlantic Records {{filed a lawsuit against}} Weiland and Eric Kretz, {{claiming}} the two had threatened to terminate their contract unless changes were made. Stone Temple Pilots had delivered six albums (five studio records and the compilation, Thank You) and Atlantic wanted a seventh album with an option for two more. In a statement made by email, the band said they were <b>surprised</b> <b>and</b> disappointed by the lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|German General Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein's raiding force retaliated to {{this growing}} British presence, by attacking the widely {{dispersed}} 5th Mounted Brigade on 23 April, Easter Sunday and also St George's Day, when Yeomanry were <b>surprised</b> <b>and</b> overwhelmed at Katia and Oghratina east of Romani. The mounted Yeomanry brigade {{had been sent}} to guard the water pipeline and railway as they were being extended beyond the protection of the Suez Canal defences into the desert towards Romani.|$|E
5|$|Pritchard {{learned from}} local {{residents}} {{that about a}} mile and a half to the north there was a military camp. Not knowing whether this was Davis and his group or the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, he approached cautiously. He soon identified the camp as Davis's. At first dawn, Pritchard charged the camp, which was so <b>surprised</b> <b>and</b> overwhelmed that it offered no resistance and yielded immediately.|$|E

5|$|The German {{evacuation}} {{had been}} carried out in an orderly fashion. Army Group North's plans had paid off and both the Soviets and the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (German High Command) was <b>surprised</b> <b>and</b> impressed by {{the speed of the}} evacuation. The 8th Army went on to take the remaining West Estonian islands (Moonsund archipelago) in the Moonsund Landing Operation, an amphibious attack. Overall, the Baltic Offensive resulted in the expulsion of German forces from Estonia, Lithuania and a large part of Latvia.|$|E
5|$|The NK 8th Division's attack stalled almost immediately. The {{division}} drove for Yongch'on from Uiseong. However, {{the attack}} {{failed to reach}} the Taegu-P'ohang corridor after being <b>surprised</b> <b>and</b> outflanked by the ROK 8th Division. NK 8th Division's 3rd Regiment was nearly destroyed by South Korean forces immediately, forcing its 2nd Regiment to attempt to relieve it, resulting in at least 700 casualties for the 2nd Regiment. At least six tanks were also destroyed by U.S. Air Force F-51 Mustangs and mines.|$|E
5|$|Also in the off-season, Gillis fired Luongo's goaltending coach Ian Clark {{and hired}} Roland Melanson in his place. Luongo {{had been a}} {{personal}} friend of Clark's and publicly stated being <b>surprised</b> <b>and</b> disappointed with the switch. The decision to hire Melanson was largely precipitated on his willingness to work with Luongo on a full-time basis – something Clark was unable to do. Despite the coaching change at the club level, Luongo retained Clark as his personal coach for his summer training. He began working with Melanson {{leading up to the}} 2010–11 season and employed several changes in his playing style, which included playing deeper into his crease instead of challenging shooters.|$|E

5|$|At 14:30 {{approximately}} 300 North Korean infantry {{came from}} the village of Tugok and concealed positions, striking B Company on Hill 125 just north of the road and east of Tugok. Two T-34 tanks <b>surprised</b> <b>and</b> knocked out the two leading Marine M26 Pershing tanks. Since the destroyed Pershing tanks blocked fields of fire, four others withdrew to better positions. Assault teams of B Company and the 1st Battalion with 3.5-inch rocket launchers rushed into action, took the tanks under fire, and destroyed both of them, as well as an armored personnel carrier following behind. The North Korean infantry attack was brutal and inflicted 25 casualties on B Company before reinforcements from A Company and supporting Army artillery and the Marine 81mm mortars helped repel it.|$|E
5|$|At 17:00 on 24 September, as Puller's men {{hiked up}} the {{northeast}} slope of Mount Austen, they <b>surprised</b> <b>and</b> killed a bivouac of 16 Japanese soldiers. The {{noise from the}} skirmish alerted several companies of Oka's Maizuru Battalion, who were emplaced nearby. The Maizuru troops quickly attacked Puller's Marines, who took cover and returned fire. Acting on Oka's orders, the Japanese slowly disengaged while withdrawing towards the Matanikau River, and the engagement was over by nightfall. The Marines counted 30 dead Japanese and had suffered 13 dead and 25 wounded. Puller radioed headquarters and requested help to evacuate the wounded. Vandegrift replied that he would send the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment (2/5) as reinforcements the next day.|$|E
5|$|At about 2:00 pm the French {{attacked}} Castel Ceriolo {{and delayed}} {{the advance of}} Schellenberg’s column by attacking its tail. Aided by Frimont, Ott defeated Monnier and forced two-thirds of his command to retreat to the northeast. About the same time, Marengo had fallen to the Austrians, forcing Napoleon's men into a general retreat. As Austrian troops crossed the Fontanone, their guns bombarded the French infantry in the vines. In a bid to further delay Schellenberg’s advance, Bonaparte committed his main Guard battalion and its artillery, which moved to flank the column. After driving off Austrian dragoons {{with the aid of}} GdB Champeaux’s remaining cavalry (under Joachim Murat), they engaged the head of the column. After a 15-minute firefight around 4:00 pm the Guard were <b>surprised</b> <b>and</b> destroyed by Frimont’s cavalry.|$|E

5|$|Chnodomar {{could not}} ignore Julian's {{fortification}} of Saverne, as it threatened his control of Alsace and blocked his main access route {{into the interior}} of Gaul. He {{had come to see}} this region as Alamanni territory by right of conquest after occupying it for several years. He also claimed to possess letters from Constantius granting the Alamanni the right to occupy those lands. Chnodomar had been <b>surprised</b> <b>and</b> dismayed by Julian's successful campaigns of 355-7. But he was encouraged by his own success against Barbatio and the intelligence brought to him by a deserter that Barbatio's withdrawal had left the Caesar with only 13,000 men. Having driven two Roman magistri from the field (Barbatio and before him, Magnentius' lieutenant, Decentius), Chnodomar had lost the barbarians' traditional fear of pitched battles with the Romans.|$|E
5|$|During {{his second}} reign, Echmarcach {{may have been}} {{involved}} in military activities in Wales with Gruffudd ap Rhydderch (died 1055). For instance in the year 1049, English and Welsh sources record that Norse-Gaelic forces were utilised by Gruffudd ap Rhydderch against his Welsh rivals and English neighbours. Specifically, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the thirteenth/fourteenth-century Brut y Tywysogion, and the twelfth-century Chronicon ex chronicis record that a Norse-Gaelic fleet sailed up the River Usk, and ravaged the surrounding region. These sources further reveal that Gruffudd ap Rhydderch and his Norse-Gaelic allies later <b>surprised</b> <b>and</b> routed the English forces of Ealdred, Bishop of Worcester (died 1069).|$|E
5|$|Following the victory, Maryland {{patrolled the}} {{southern}} approaches to Surigao Strait until 29 October; she then steamed for the Admiralty Isles for brief replenishment and resumed patrol duty around Leyte on 16 November, protecting the landing forces from continued Japanese air attacks. On 29 November, during another Japanese air attack, a kamikaze aircraft <b>surprised</b> <b>and</b> struck Maryland. The aircraft crashed into Maryland between Turrets No. 1 and 2, piercing the forecastle, main, and armored decks and blowing {{a hole in}} the 4-inch steel, causing extensive damage and starting fires. In all, 31 men were killed and 30 wounded in the attack, and the medical department was destroyed but still functional.|$|E

5|$|In early August, three North Korean {{divisions}} mounted offensives {{against the}} three {{passes through the}} area, with the NK 8th Division attacking Yongch'on, NK 12th Division attacking P’ohang-dong and NK 5th Division, {{in conjunction with the}} 766th Independent Infantry Regiment, attacking An'gang-ni. The NK 8th Division drove for Yongch'on from Uiseong, but its attack failed to reach the Taegu-P'ohang corridor after being <b>surprised</b> <b>and</b> outflanked by the ROK 8th Division. This fighting was so heavy that the NK 8th Division was forced to hold its ground for a week before trying to advance. Stalled again by South Korean resistance, it halted to wait for reinforcements. However the other two attacks were more successful, catching the UN forces by surprise.|$|E
5|$|On December 13, {{another group}} of MiG-15s {{attacked}} Davis during a morning patrol near Yongwon. Davis destroyed one MiG, and as a second MiG attempted to target his wingman, Davis outmaneuvered it and shot it down. At {{the end of the}} patrol, Davis had amassed 10 victories, making him the first double ace of the war. During an afternoon patrol commanding twenty-two F-86's, Davis spotted fifty MiGs in the Sunchun, South Korea area heading further south towards the Taechon area. He <b>surprised</b> <b>and</b> destroyed one MiG, and then turned on another in an aggressive attack which forced the MiG pilot to bail out. After 30 combat missions in Korea, Davis had 12 victories.|$|E
5|$|Realising {{that he was}} in danger, Levski {{decided to}} flee to Romania, where he would meet Karavelov and discuss these events. First, however, he had to collect {{important}} documentation from the committee archive in Lovech, which would constitute important evidence if seized by the Ottomans. He stayed at the nearby village inn in Kakrina, where he was <b>surprised</b> <b>and</b> arrested on the morning of 27 December 1872. Starting with the writings of Lyuben Karavelov the most accepted version has been that a priest named Krastyo Nikiforov betrayed Levski to the police. This theory has been disputed by the researchers Ivan Panchovski and Vasil Boyanov for lack of evidence.|$|E
