The only differences are that Karavelov claimed Levski was tall rather than of medium height, while Furnadzhiev noted that his moustache was light brown and his eyes appeared hazel.|$|E

40|$|Although the {{association}} for esophageal cancer with tobacco <b>smoking</b> <b>and</b> alcohol <b>drinking</b> {{has been well}} established, the risk appears to be less strong in China. To provide more evidence {{on the effect of}} <b>smoking</b> <b>and</b> alcohol consumption with esophageal cancer in China, particularly among Chinese women, a population-based case-control study has been conducted in Jiangsu, China, from 2003 to 2007. A total of 1, 520 cases and 3, 879 controls were recruited. Unconditional multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied. Results showed that the odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval (CI) for ever <b>smoking</b> <b>and</b> alcohol <b>drinking</b> were 1. 57 (95 % CI: 1. 34 - 1. 83) and 1. 50 (95 % CI: 1. 29 - 1. 74). Dose-response relationships were observed with increased intensity and longer duration of smoking/drinking. Risk of <b>smoking</b> <b>and</b> alcohol <b>drinking</b> at the highest joint level was 7. 32 (95 % CI: 4. 58 - 11. 7), when compared to those never smoked and never drank alcohol. Stratifying by genders, <b>smoking</b> <b>and</b> alcohol <b>drinking</b> increased the risk among men with an OR of 1. 74 (95 % CI: 1. 44 - 2. 09) and 1. 76 (95 % CI: 1. 48 - 2. 09); however, neither smoking nor alcohol consumption showed a significant association among women. In conclusion, <b>smoking</b> <b>and</b> alcohol <b>drinking</b> were associated with esophageal cancer risk among Chinese men, but not among Chinese women...|$|R

In one stunt, Peter attempts to jump a lake but instead crashes into a tree, {{causing him to}} fall into the lake and become incapacitated. Brian swims out to save him from drowning, but strains his back during the rescue and also ends up stranded in the water along with Peter, before being rescued by Joe. Lois berates Peter for his actions, since Brian is becoming old and has been <b>smoking</b> <b>and</b> <b>drinking.</b> Peter begins to grow upset about Brian's age so he obtains another dog and names him New Brian. His positive attitude and desirable personality make Brian feel like an outcast and Brian becomes sad that he is now unloved, and rejected. For example in one scene, when the Griffins hear New Brian fart, they think it is cute and when Brian does it, they get furious and kick him out. He ultimately decides to leave the residence, while his family begins to miss him.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Gaga, {{dressed in black}} clothing, sunglasses, bloody feet, and {{seemingly}} bionic features, walking through a field in Nebraska; having returned on foot after years of absence. Gaga goes to buy ice cream from an ice cream truck, but she suddenly drops it as a toothless man with a doll in his hand grins at her. She begins to have flashbacks to an earlier time spent in Nebraska as scenes of Gaga having a wedding, being tortured by a man inside a barn, and being inside a water tank appear in quick succession. The song starts playing as the camera zooms slowly towards Gaga, who is standing bent forward as she begins singing. The video continually switches to scenes where Gaga, with little make up, a simple gray-colored hair style, and a white dress, plays a piano {{in the middle of}} a cornfield, while her male alter ego, Jo Calderone, sits on top of the piano, <b>smoking</b> <b>and</b> <b>drinking</b> a beer.

40|$|Abstract — Aims: The main {{objective}} {{of this article was}} to compare alcohol and tobacco consumption in the US and the Basque Country (the North of Spain) with particular attention to the association between alcohol and tobacco use. The consistency of findings was considered by analyzing data from two different years. These comparisons may provide a rational basis for exploring the associations between alcohol and cigarette use that are influenced by changes in use prevalences. Methods: Two epidemiological samples from the US, obtained in 1992 and 1996, and two from the Basque Country, obtained in the same years, were used. Sampling methodologies were similar. Questionnaires were self-administrated with the help of interviewers, and were used to define ever smokers, ex-smokers, current smokers, heavy smokers, ever drinkers, ex-drinkers, current drinkers and weekly drinkers. The associations between <b>smoking</b> <b>and</b> alcohol <b>drinking</b> were explored through logistic regressions. Results: The associations between current <b>smoking</b> <b>and</b> current <b>drinking</b> in the general population, <b>and</b> between ever <b>smoking</b> <b>and</b> weekly <b>drinking</b> among current drinkers appear very stable. In 1992 and 1996, US subjects who decided to try alcohol tended to try <b>smoking</b> <b>and</b> vice versa. In US Caucasians (particularly in 1996), heavy smoking was strongly associated with ever drinking among current smokers. In the Basque Country in 1992, there was a significant association between <b>smoking</b> cessation <b>and</b> <b>drinking</b> cessation among ever drinkers who als...|$|R

40|$|Whether {{cigarette}} <b>smoking</b> <b>and</b> moderate <b>drinking</b> {{are associated}} with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has not been fully described. This study investigated the separate and joint effects of <b>smoking</b> <b>and</b> moderate <b>drinking</b> on Chinese men with NAFLD. Across-sectional assay from DFTJ Cohort study was performed with a size of 9432 elderly Chinese men excluding excessive alcohol consumption (< 210 g/week). Fatty liver was diagnosed by standardized ultrasonographic inspection. The odds ratio (OR) of alcohol consumption <b>and</b> <b>smoking</b> for the prevalence of NAFLD were analyzed using multiple logistic regression with multiple adjustments. The prevalence of NAFLD in current smokers (pack-year≥ 40) and drinkers (80 ~ 210 g/week or drinking duration≥ 35 years) {{was significantly higher than}} that in non-smokers and non-drinkers, respectively. The combination of current <b>smoking</b> (pack-year≥ 40) <b>and</b> <b>drinking</b> (80 ~ 210 g/week) was associated with the highest risk of NAFLD (OR 1. 85; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 28 - 2. 68;P< 0. 01). The similar combined effect was found in participants with pack-year≥ 40 <b>and</b> <b>drinking</b> duration≥ 35 years (OR 1. 72; 95 % CI 1. 26 - 2. 34;P< 0. 01). Moreover, an interaction was observed between current <b>smoking</b> <b>and</b> moderate <b>drinking</b> in NAFLD.

Similarly, males are 13 percentage points more likely than females of consuming drugs and engaging in criminal behaviours. Although the average age is 19, many individual were aged 18 at the moment of the interview.
