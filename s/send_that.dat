25|$|A {{good example}} of the use of {{probability}} theory in equity trading is the effect of the perceived probability of any widespread Middle East conflict on oil prices, which have ripple effects in the economy as a whole. An assessment by a commodity trader that a war is more likely can <b>send</b> <b>that</b> commodity's prices up or down, and signals other traders of that opinion. Accordingly, the probabilities are neither assessed independently nor necessarily very rationally. The theory of behavioral finance emerged to describe the effect of such groupthink on pricing, on policy, and on peace and conflict.|$|E

500|$|The Super Smash Bros. {{series is}} a {{departure}} from many fighting games; instead of winning by depleting an opponent's life bar, Smash Bros. players seek to knock opposing characters off a stage. Each player has a damage total, represented by a percentage, which rises as damage is taken and can exceed 100%, with a maximum damage of 999%. As this percentage rises, the character can be knocked progressively farther by an opponent's attacks. To KO an opponent, the player must <b>send</b> <b>that</b> character flying {{off the edge of}} the stage, which is not an enclosed arena but rather an area with open boundaries, many suspended in an otherwise empty space. When knocked off the stage, a character may use jumping moves in an attempt to return; some characters have longer-ranged jumps and may have an easier time [...] "recovering" [...] than others. Additionally, characters have different weights, making it harder for heavier opponents to be knocked off the edge, but reciprocally harder for them to recover once sent flying.|$|E

2500|$|After the Allies began {{digging a}} new trench against the inner defenses, Dubreton {{launched}} a sortie without warning on 5 October. The attackers killed and wounded almost 150 Allies and carried off or spoiled {{much of their}} equipment. No sooner had Wellington resumed siege operations than Dubreton struck again. At 2am on the 8th, with perfect timing, the French swarmed out of the fort and inflicted 184 casualties while suffering small losses. Rain began to fall in sheets, flooding the siege trenches. The British guns on the hornwork ran so low on ammunition that French cannonballs were retrieved and reused.

2500|$|Producer Steve Lillywhite {{was hired}} by U2 in December 1986 to help mix some songs for The Joshua Tree; [...] "With or Without You" [...] was one of them. While Lillywhite and {{engineer}} Mark Wallis were mixing it, Eno entered the room {{and told them that}} he wanted to change the introduction. Wallis said: [...] "And it was kind of awe-inspiring because he said, 'Right, send this guitar through those ten effects over there and <b>send</b> <b>that</b> guitar through those ten effects over there and then feed them back to each other.' So what started as a traditional bit of rhythm guitar, bass, and drums suddenly became something quite otherworldly and spiritual, {{and the sound of the}} music you were hearing started to give you a feeling of where the song was going to go prior to the lyric. I thought that was really visionary." [...] Ultimately, [...] "With or Without You" [...] was the most debated song of those on which Lillywhite worked, as Eno and Lanois each had ideas different from his. Lillywhite, who wanted a more mainstream approach to his mix, favoured [...] "a little more crash, bang" [...] sound to Mullen's drums that enter later in the song, while Eno preferred that the drums remain [...] "more mysterious and more supportive".|$|E
