40|$|Light leaf spot, {{caused by}} Pyrenopeziza brassicae, was {{assessed}} regularly on double-low cultivars of winter oilseed rape during field experiments at Rothamsted in 1990 - 91 and 1991 - 92. Previous cropping and fungicide applications differed; seed yield and seed quality were measured at harvest. In each season, both the initial incidence of light leaf spot {{and the rate}} of disease increase were greater in oilseed rape crops sown after rape than those sown after cereals. The incidence of diseases caused by Phoma lingam or Alternaria spp. was also greater in second oilseed rape crops. In 1991 - 92 there was 42 % less rainfall between September and March than in 1990 - 91, and much less light leaf spot developed. However, P. lingam and Alternaria spp. were more common. Only fungicide application schedules including an autumn spray decreased the incidence of light leaf spot on leaves, stems and pods, as indicated by decreased areas under the disease progress curves (AUDPC) and slower rates of disease increase. <b>Summer</b> <b>sprays</b> decreased incidence and severity of light leaf spot on pods only. In 1990 - 91, all fungicide treatments which included an autumn spray increased seed and oil yields of cv.

40|$|Liquid lime sulfur (LLS) {{was applied}} to apples at various rates and timings to {{determine}} its effectiveness for controlling sooty blotch, flyspeck, and summer fruit rots. Four applications of LLS at either 2 qt or 4 qt controlled flyspeck {{just as well as}} four sprays of Topsin M plus Captan (the commercial standard). Four applications of LLS at 1 qt/ 100 gal were less effective, but applying the low rate six times improved performance to equal that of the standard treatment.   Two phosphorous acid products, Phostrol and NutriPhyte, were substituted for captan in several <b>summer</b> <b>sprays</b> and also provided effective control of sooty blotch and flyspeck.   Measurements of the spray solution pH and surface residue pH from newly sprayed leaves verified the alkaline nature of LLS sprays and raised the possibility that LLS sprays could cause rapid breakdown of products that are subject to alkaline hydrolysis (e. g.

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 English holly {{culture in}} Oregon has been {{threatened}} {{by the development of}} red leaf spots which prevent sale of cut holly. Chemical, mechanical and insect injury and boron deficiency have been shown in the past to cause different types of red leaf spotting, but the cause of holly scab, a widely prevalent type of red leaf spotting, had not been determined. The objectives of this study were to determine the cause of holly scab and to investigate the factors that influence its development. Holly scab spots are irregular, translucent, or red-black swollen areas principally on the lower leaf surface, although some varieties show spotting on both leaf surfaces. Observation of scab development on trees in a variety plot showed that the size and color of holly scab spots varies considerably on different varieties of holly. Green stem hollies appear to be as susceptible to scab as the brown or blue stem varieties but form less pigmentation. No promising resistant varieties were observed. Nutritional vigor of the host did not affect susceptibility to infection. When nitrogen, calcium or boron deficient plants and normal plants were exposed to natural inoculum in the field all plants became infected. Over 100 different organisms were isolated from leaves affected with holly scab and inoculation attempts were made with 28 of the isolates. Only a species of Sclerophoma produced holly scab. Attempts to identify the fungus repeatedly lead to Phoma and Phyllosticta. Because of significant differences from characteristics of these genera, however, cultures were sent to B. C. Sutton of the Commonwealth Mycological Institute for identification. Sutton acknowledged that the fungus was not a Phoma or Phyllosticta. He pointed out its similarity to Sclerophoma pithyophila (Cda.) Hohn. and listed it as a Sclerophoma species with accession number IMI 107649. The fungus in culture has pycnidia that are non-ostiolate, spherical to pyriform, ranging in size from 75 microns to 200 microns. Spores are hyaline, ovoid-oblong, guttulate, 2 - 4 x 5 - 7 microns with no visible sporophores at maturity but are embedded in a gelatinous matrix. The fungus grows slowly on streptomycin-PDA over a range of 15 ° to 25 ° C but does not grow at 30 ° C. It grew best on media with an initial pH from 4 to 7. The holly Sclerophoma did not sporulate under normal laboratory conditions, but sporulated readily when KNO₃ was used as a nitrogen source or following exposure to prolonged periods of near-ultraviolet. Sporulation has not been observed in infected leaves. Comparison of the holly Sclerophoma with descriptions of the Sclerophoma species listed by Grove showed distinct differences in host range and morphology which would support the establishment of a new species. Unfortunately cultures of other Sclerophoma species were not available for comparison, and further attempts to clarify the taxonomic status of the holly Sclerophoma are pending receipt of collections from Europe. Attempts to control the disease, with spring and <b>summer</b> <b>sprays</b> were inconclusive {{due to a lack of}} natural infection within the test plots, but provided information on three other non-pathogenic leaf-spots.

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{environmental}} control practices and problems for greenhouses in Saudi Arabia was conducted. The data were collected in Riyadh, Qaseem and Eastern regions {{during the period of}} September 2003 to May 2004. The study was carried out on greenhouses covering approximately an area of 443 ha. Theo¬retical analysis were made to evaluate the performance of ventilation and cooling system for common greenhouses designs. The results showed that most of surveyed greenhouses were Quonset-style structure with lengths ranging from 30 m to 56 m, and a width of 9 m. Gutter-connected structures is the second popular houses design, which can be either ridge-and- furrow or arch-roof with lengths ranging from 110 m to 150 m, and widths ranging from 35 m to 40 m. All gutter-connected greenhouses were evaporatively cooled by fan and pad system, while Quonset-style houses were either naturally or mechanically ventilated. Galvanized metal were commonly used to build frame of greenhouses. Three types of covering materials were used including polyethylene, glass and fiberglass. The result indicated that most of greenhouses in Riyadh region were evaporatively cooled during summer period by fan and pad system, whereas most greenhouses in Qaseem and Eastern regions were naturally ventilated. Ventilation rates for each fan were between 40000 and 44000 m 3 /hr. Fans were either manually or automatically operated. Fans operation were based on air temperature inside greenhouses. It was found that in some farms, fans were switched off during night to save electrical energy consumption. The average distance between cooling pads and fans was 39. 5 m. The results showed that there were three types of pad materials; they are cross-fluted cellulose pads, excel¬sior (wood fiber), plastic pads and palm dates fiber pads. During periods of high solar radiation, greenhouse shading was commonly used. Several shading systems are used by many greenhouse growers including: white shading mix¬ture sprayed on the exterior greenhouse covering and variable shading (internal or external) using different materials such as plastic nets rated at 20 % to 80 % shading. Another approach for reducing greenhouses overheating during <b>summer</b> was to <b>spray</b> water droplets in greenhouses by low- or high-pressure systems. Summer air exchange rates were ranged from 1. 21 to 1. 84 air changes per minute (ACM), which was higher than the recommended rate of 0. 75 to 1. 0 ACM. Greenhouses in Qaseem have the lowest predicted inside air temperature, while greenhouses in Dhah¬ran have the highest predicted inside air temperature. Greenhouses in Dhahran have the highest predicted inside relative humidity, while the lowest values were predicted in Riyadh. Predicted temperatures and relative humid¬ities inside the greenhouses were in the permissible ranges for good production practice of greenhouse crops. Shade was predicted to reduce air temperature, and to increase relative humidity inside the greenhouses. Results showed that naturally ventilated greenhouses were Quonset structure with lengths ranging from 30 m to 56 rn, and width of 9 m. The common method for natural ventilation was done by opening doors and roof vents between poly¬ethylene cover. The results indicated that 61 %, 31 % and 26 % of greenhouses in Riyadh, Qaseem and Eastern regions, respectively, were heated during winter. Heating system were of two types; Diesel burning heaters and water heating pipes. Some major obstacles of greenhouses environment control were salt precipitation and dust accumulation in the cooling pad, non-uniform temperature in the greenhouse, low efficiency of cooling and heating systems, and high costs of covering materials. Some recommendations to improve the performance of the environmental con¬trol systems for greenhouses were presented...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} focused on the {{identification}} of the sources and processes affecting levels and composition of PM 10 and PM 2. 5 from air quality monitoring networks in Eastern Spain. This is a multidisciplinary study. Time series of TSP and PM 10 recorded from 1996 to 2000 are interpreted to assess the role of local, regional and distant sources in PM levels in this region. To this is end, the influence of the meteorology on PM levels recorded at nineteen rural, urban and industrial monitoring stations is studied by means of synoptic charts, back-trajectories and local meteorological variables. The impact of African dust transport on PM levels is investigated by means of simulations in the SKIRON forecast system and by TOMS satellite observations. Moreover, a chemical characterisation of PM 10, PM 2. 5 and TSP size segregated fractions and a daily PM 10 and PM 2. 5 source apportionment by two receptor modelling techniques are performed. For this purpose, 24 -hour samples of PM 10 were collected for 16, 12 and 5 months at rural, urban and industrial sites, respectively. PM 2. 5 was sampled at the urban site simultaneously with PM 10. 	The results showed that day-to-day variations in PM levels are highly influenced by the meteorology. From March to October, PM levels at rural, urban and industrial sites vary {{as a function of the}} concatenation of Atlantic air mass advections (Atlantic episodes with low PM levels) and regional circulations (Regional events with high PM and O 3 levels) which induce the PM transport from urban/industrial to rural sites and the ageing of polluted air masses in the Western Mediterranean. From November to February low PM levels are recorded at rural sites, and variations in PM levels at urban/industrial sites are governed by the successive occurrence of Atlantic episodes and Local urban/industrial pollution events (with high PM, NOx and CO levels). The African dust events mainly occur from January to October and induce very high PM levels in all sites. 	As a result of the frequency and intensity of the Regional episodes, PM levels at rural sites undergo a seasonal evolution with a summer maximum. The difference between PM levels at urban and rural sites presents an autumn-winter maximum owing to the occurrence of intensive Local urban pollution events. 	The meteorological context in which the aforementioned episodes occur is discussed, with special emphasis on the synoptic scenarios giving rise to the African dust outbreaks in the different seasons. 	Levels of PM components at the different study sites were compared. The seasonal evolution and the grain size distribution of these components was studied and the form of occurrence was determined. The chemical characterisation shows that high levels of natural mineral dust components (e. g. Al, Fe, Mg, Ti, Sr, Ca) are simultaneously recorded in PM 10 and PM 2. 5 at all sites during African episodes. Other interesting findings are: 1) a marked seasonal evolution of nitrate levels and grain size distribution due to the occurrence of ammonium-nitrate in autumn-winter, 2) an excess of Na with respect to the Na/Cl marine ratio in summer owing to reactions of acids with sea salt, and 3) high background levels of ammonium-sulphate in summer. Moreover, the levels of elemental, organic and mineral carbon were determined. 	At the rural site, the PM 10 annual mean reaches 22 µg/m 3, the main contributions being secondary particles from industrial emissions (27 % of PM 10), vehicle exhausts (14 - 23 %), natural mineral dust (23 %) and sea spray (5 - 9 %). At the urban kerbside station, the PM 10 annual mean reaches 49 µg/m 3, the main contributions being vehicle exhausts (35 - 45 % of PM 10), secondary particles from industrial emissions (24 - 31 %), natural + road dust (25 %) and sea spray (4 - 6 %). At the urban kerbside station, the PM 2. 5 annual mean reaches 34 µg/m 3, the main contributions being vehicle exhausts (41 - 53 % of PM 2. 5), secondary particles from industrial emissions (29 - 35 %) and mineral dust (9 - 11 %). 	These results have important implications for the implementation of the PM 10 EU standards. The natural load in ambient PM 10 levels in Eastern Spain accounts for 30 - 40 % of the 2010 EU annual PM 10 limit value (20 µg/m 3). In this region it will not be easy to meet this limit value given that the annual PM 10 levels are in the range 17 - 20 µg/m 3 at rural, 30 - 45 µg/m 3 at urban and 45 - 60 µg/m 3 at industrial sites. The high background levels of PM 10 in this region are favoured by the specific orographic and meteorological context of the Mediterranean and by the high load of mineral dust caused by the soil re-suspension and the frequent occurrence of African dust events. At rural sites, 2 - 5 exceedances of the EU daily PM 10 limit value (50 µg/m 3) are recorded every year during African dust outbreaks. On average, 15 African induced and 40 - 80 non-African induced exceedances of the EU daily PM 10 limit value are recorded every year at the urban kerbside stations. 	The parameter selected for PM monitoring is a key factor. Most of the PM species resulting from combustion and vehicle exhaust emissions have a fine size distribution (< 2. 5 µm), with exception of nitrate in <b>summer,</b> whereas sea <b>spray</b> and mineral dust present a coarse size distribution. The interference of African dust in the PM monitoring is significantly reduced when PM 2. 5 instead of PM 10 is monitored. Natural mineral dust concentrations during African episodes are in the ranges 20 - 30 µg/m 3 in PM 10 and 10 - 15 µg/m 3 in PM 2. 5. However, PM 2. 5 is not a suitable parameter for PM monitoring in all environments. The selection of PM 10 or PM 2. 5 should be conditioned by the type of anthropogenic activity. At urban sites, PM 2. 5 contains mainly vehicle exhaust products, whereas the road traffic dust principally occurs in the 2. 5 - 10 µm fraction. PM 2. 5 is not a suitable parameter for monitoring some industrial activities (e. g. ceramics, cement production or mining) with primary PM emissions in the 2. 5 - 10 µm range.
