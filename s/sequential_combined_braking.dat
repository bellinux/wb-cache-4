40|$|<b>Sequential</b> <b>combined</b> spinal {{epidural}} anaesthesia (Sequential CSEA) {{is probably}} the greatest advance in central neuraxial block in this decade for high risk geriatric patients because here the advantages of both spinal and epidural anaesthesia are summated avoiding the side effects. This study is designed to compare the clinical effects of <b>sequential</b> <b>combined</b> spinal epidural anaesthesia versus spinal anaesthesia in high risk geriatric patients undergoing major orthopaedic procedure. Sixty patients aged 65 to 80 years, ASA III were randomly allocated into two equal groups. Group A (n= 30) received <b>sequential</b> <b>combined</b> spinal epidural anaesthesia with 1 ml (5 mg) of 0. 5 % hyperbaric bupivacaine with 20 mg fentanyl through spinal route, and the expected incompleteness of spinal block was managed with small incremental dose of 0. 5 % isobaric bupivacaine through epidural catheter, 1. 5 to 2 ml for every unblocked segment to achieve T 10 sensory level. Group B (n= 30) received spinal anaesthesia with 2 ml (10 mg) of 0. 5 % hyperbaric bupivacaine and 20 mg of fentanyl. Both the groups showed rapid onset, excellent analgesia and good quality motor block. Group A showed a significantly less incidence of hypotension (p< 0. 01) along with the provision of prolonging analgesia as compared to group B. So <b>sequential</b> <b>combined</b> spinal epidural anaesthesia is a safe, effective, reliable technique with stable haemodynamic along with provision of prolonging analgesia compared to spinal anaesthesia for high risk geriatric patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: A prospective, randomized, {{open-label study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate effects on mammographic density in postmenopausal and late perimenopausal women receiving continuous <b>combined</b> or <b>sequential</b> <b>combined</b> hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Methods: The subjects were randomized to treatment with low-dose continuous combined HRT containing 1 mg 17 -estradiol plus 0. 5 mg norethisterone acetate (Activelle®) or a <b>sequential</b> <b>combined</b> HRT regimen consisting of 0. 625 mg conjugated equine estrogens for 28 days plus 5 mg medrogestone for 14 days (Presomen®). Mammograms were obtained at baseline and after 9 cycles (each 28 days) of treatment. Results: The majority of women (approximately two-thirds in each treatment group) had no changes in mammographic breast density between baseline and the final study visit. There were no marked differences between treatment groups. Approximately 20 % of women in both groups had a slight increase in mammographic density. Only 10 – 14 % of women in both groups had a pronounced increase in mammographic density. The analyses of the degree of change showed no remarkable differences between treatments. Conclusion: These results indicate that the increase in mammographic density with a low-dose continuous combined HRT regimen is no greater than that with a <b>sequential</b> <b>combined</b> HRT regimen. The type of progestogen does not {{have an impact on the}} extent of mammographic density changes...|$|R

40|$|To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of two hormonal therapies in treating symptoms caused by bowel endometriosis. Patient preference study. University hospital. A total of 143 women with rectovaginal endometriosis infiltrating the rectum. This study was performed between January 2008 and June 2011. Patients were treated with a desogestrel-only contraceptive pill or with the <b>sequential</b> <b>combined</b> contraceptive vaginal ring for 12  months. The primary endpoint {{of the study was}} the rate of satisfied patients at 12 -month follow up. The changes in symptoms and in the volume of the nodules were secondary endpoints. At 12 -month follow up, the rate of satisfied patients was higher in the group treated with the desogestrel-only contraceptive pill than in the group treated with the <b>sequential</b> <b>combined</b> contraceptive vaginal ring (p =  0. 004). When only changes in gastrointestinal symptoms were considered, 50 % of patients treated with the desogestrel-only contraceptive pill and 31. 3 % of those treated with the <b>sequential</b> <b>combined</b> contraceptive vaginal ring were satisfied (p =  0. 037). The reduction in the volume of the nodules, the percentages of patients who discontinued the therapy after the completion of the study and of those who decided to undergo surgery were similar between the two groups. Both hormonal therapies are efficacious in treating symptoms caused by rectovaginal endometriosis infiltrating the rectum. Patient satisfaction is higher with the desogestrel-only pill than with a vaginal ring...|$|R

40|$|Time and the {{stopping}} {{distance of the}} electric drive with frequent starting-and-braking modes that contain embedded asynchronous motor with a recessed <b>combined</b> <b>braking</b> device depend on the moment of an electromagnet disinhibition. At the same time other important criteria are taken into the account, i. e. wear resistance of the brake device and the smoothness of the deceleration of the electric drive. In general such an asynchronous motor contains asynchronous engine with squirrel-cage rotor, electromechanical normally-closed brake, electromagnetical slip clutch and control circuit. The mechanical characteristics of the deceleration of asynchronous motor with recessed <b>combined</b> <b>brake</b> device at different moments of an electromagnet disinhibition are presented.  The mathematical model is featured and the transients in such a motor are presented.  Formation models for computer research were {{carried out in the}} Fortran 2008 programming language. Calculation of the system of differential equations was fulfilled by the Runge – Kutta method. The deceleration of the electromechanical brake at various speeds caused different time values and {{stopping distance}}s. The plots of stopping distance and the braking time at various moments of an electromagnet disinhibition are demonstrated.  The optimum moment of switching on an electromechanical brake, providing small stopping distance and the braking time is the time when the speed wвкл = 0, 6 – 0, 8 of the nominal. In this case the acceptable number of brake applications for friction linings (compared with mechanical braking) will increase by 1. 6 – 2. 8 times.
