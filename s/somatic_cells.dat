5|$|Coalitions between organisms of {{the same}} species have also evolved. An extreme case is the eusociality found in social insects, such as bees, {{termites}} and ants, where sterile insects feed and guard the small number of organisms in a colony that are able to reproduce. On an even smaller scale, the <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> that make up the body of an animal limit their reproduction so they can maintain a stable organism, which then supports a small number of the animal's germ cells to produce offspring. Here, <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> respond to specific signals that instruct them whether to grow, remain as they are, or die. If cells ignore these signals and multiply inappropriately, their uncontrolled growth causes cancer.|$|E

In immature egg cells, mRNAs with shortened poly(A) tails are not degraded, but are instead stored without being translated. They are then activated by cytoplasmic polyadenylation after fertilisation, during egg activation.|$|E

40|$|Factors {{affecting}} <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> {{counts and}} {{the association between}} <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> counts and milk production were evaluated. Data were collected from 748 Ontario Dairy Herd Improvement Corporation supervised herds that were on production and <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count programs between April 1981 and March 1983. Two data files were created; one, the lactation summary file, contained one record per cow on each of 9406 Holsteins and the other, the test day file, included results of all tests during the complete lactation {{on each of the}} above cows. The latter file contained 85, 236 records. Multiple curvilinear least squares regression was used to create five separate models. The dependent variables used in the models were natural logarithms (Loge) of the geometric mean of the <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count for the lactation, 305 day milk production and breed class average for milk from the lactation summary file, and loge of the 24 hour <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count and 24 hour milk production from the test day file. The <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count at both the lactation and test day level increased with age up to approximately ten years and thereafter slowly decreased. The variable "days in milk" was not significantly associated with the lactation average <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count. A curvilinear relationship was found between days in lactation at the time of test and the <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count of 24 hour milk production.

5|$|Cell theory led {{biologists}} to re-envision individual organisms as interdependent assemblages {{of individual}} cells. Scientists in the rising field of cytology, armed with increasingly powerful microscopes and new staining methods, soon {{found that even}} single cells were far {{more complex than the}} homogeneous fluid-filled chambers described by earlier microscopists. Robert Brown had described the nucleus in 1831, {{and by the end of}} the 19th century cytologists identified many of the key cell components: chromosomes, centrosomes mitochondria, chloroplasts, and other structures made visible through staining. Between 1874 and 1884 Walther Flemming described the discrete stages of mitosis, showing that they were not artifacts of staining but occurred in living cells, and moreover, that chromosomes doubled in number just before the cell divided and a daughter cell was produced. Much of the research on cell reproduction came together in August Weismann's theory of heredity: he identified the nucleus (in particular chromosomes) as the hereditary material, proposed the distinction between <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> and germ cells (arguing that chromosome number must be halved for germ cells, a precursor to the concept of meiosis), and adopted Hugo de Vries's theory of pangenes. Weismannism was extremely influential, especially in the new field of experimental embryology.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanisms}} of reproductive heritability and {{the origin of}} new traits remained a mystery. Towards this end, Darwin developed his provisional theory of pangenesis. In 1865, Gregor Mendel reported that traits were inherited in a predictable manner through the independent assortment and segregation of elements (later known as genes). Mendel's laws of inheritance eventually supplanted most of Darwin's pangenesis theory. August Weismann made the important distinction between germ cells {{that give rise to}} gametes (such as sperm and egg cells) and the <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> of the body, demonstrating that heredity passes through the germ line only. Hugo de Vries connected Darwin's pangenesis theory to Weismann's germ/soma cell distinction and proposed that Darwin's pangenes were concentrated in the cell nucleus and when expressed they could move into the cytoplasm to change the cells structure. De Vries {{was also one of the}} researchers who made Mendel's work well-known, believing that Mendelian traits corresponded to the transfer of heritable variations along the germline. To explain how new variants originate, de Vries developed a mutation theory that led to a temporary rift between those who accepted Darwinian evolution and biometricians who allied with de Vries. In the 1930s, pioneers in the field of population genetics, such as Ronald Fisher, Sewall Wright and J. B. S. Haldane set the foundations of evolution onto a robust statistical philosophy. The false contradiction between Darwin's theory, genetic mutations, and Mendelian inheritance was thus reconciled.|$|E

The cows divided over 5 different Dutch dairy farms were split in two groups and given either a high vitamin E supplementation (3. 000 IU/day orally) or a low supplementation (135 IU/day orally) during the dry period. These data were used to investigate 5 risk factors ante partum for their predictive value towards an elevated <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> count post partum.

25|$|The {{process of}} <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> nuclear {{transplant}} involves two different cells. The first being a female gamete, {{known as the}} ovum (egg/oocyte).

The second being a <b>somatic</b> <b>cell,</b> referring to {{the cells of the}} human body. Skin cells, fat cells, and liver cells are only a few examples. The nucleus of the donor egg cell is removed and discarded, leaving it 'deprogrammed.' What is left is a <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> and an unnucleated egg cell.

Genetic parameters were estimated for 67, 882 and 49, 709 primiparous goats of the dairy Alpine and Saanen breeds, respectively, with complete information for milk <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> counts and milk production traits. About 40 % of the goats had additional information for 11 udder type traits scored by official classifiers of the breeders’ association CAPGENES. Estimates were obtained by REML with an animal model.

Heritability of LSCS was 0. 20 and 0. 24 in the Alpine and Saanen breeds, respectively.

Heritability estimates in first lactation ranged from 0. 30 to 0. 35 for lactation milk, fat, and protein yields; from 0. 60 to 0. 67 for fat and protein contents; and from 0. 22 to 0. 50 for udder type traits.
