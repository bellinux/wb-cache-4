50|$|Accelerated curing is any {{method by}} which high early age {{strength}} is achieved in concrete. These techniques are especially useful in the prefabrication industry, wherein high early age strength enables {{the removal of the}} formwork within 24 hours, thereby reducing the cycle time, resulting in cost-saving benefits.

50|$|Pozzolona {{increases}} the later age strength of concrete as it reacts with calcium hydroxide {{and turns it}} into calcium-silicate-hydrates (C-S-H). However Portland pozzolona cements have higher activation energy and therefore, their rate of hydration is lower as compared to ordinary Portland cement (OPC). This results in lower early age strength as compared to OPC. Accelerated curing techniques radically help to increase the rate of strength gain. Halit et al. showed that <b>steam</b> <b>curing</b> improved the 1 day compressive strength values of high volume fly ash concrete mixtures (40%, 50% and 60% fly ash by replacement) from 10MPa to about 20MPa which is sufficient to enable the removal of formwork and greatly aids the precast concrete industry.|$|E
50|$|When the {{concrete}} is {{poured into the}} form, a small gap is created {{between it and the}} plastic. Plastic has a coefficient of thermal expansion and contraction 10 to 15 times that of concrete, and when subjected to temperature variations, the plastic continues to expand and contract at that higher coefficient. At high temperatures, plastic can even melt. The result is a separation between the spacers and the poured concrete, creating a free passage for corrosive agents to reach the steel reinforcement from the exterior of {{the concrete}} product. This will cause the steel - and eventually the concrete - to corrode. If <b>steam</b> <b>curing</b> is applied to the concrete, the heat in the curing process causes the plastic to expand while the concrete is relatively fresh and weak. After reaching the maximum curing temperature and volume expansion of the plastic, the temperature is held at this level until the concrete reaches the desired strength. After curing, the subsequent lower temperatures cause the plastic to contract, and a gap remains at the interface between the plastic and concrete. Plastic spacers are also subject to corrosion when they come into contact with chlorides and chemicals, where concrete has a much higher resistance.|$|E

The role of phosphorus slag in steam-cured concrete was investigated by determining the hydration heat, hydration products, nonevaporable water content, pore structure of paste, and the compressive strength and chloride ion permeability of concrete.
