40|$|Investigation of <b>surge</b> <b>pressure</b> is {{of great}} {{significance}} to the circulation loss problem caused by unsteady operations in management pressure drilling (MPD) operations. With full consideration of the important factors such as wave velocity, gas influx rate, pressure, temperature, and well depth, a new <b>surge</b> <b>pressure</b> model has been proposed based on the mass conservation equations and the momentum conservation equations during MPD operations. The finite-difference method, the Newton-Raphson iterative method, and the fourth-order explicit Runge-Kutta method (R-K 4) are adopted to solve the model. Calculation {{results indicate that the}} <b>surge</b> <b>pressure</b> has different values with respect to different drill pipe tripping speeds and well parameters. In general, the <b>surge</b> <b>pressure</b> tends to increase with the increases of drill pipe operating speed and with the decrease of gas influx rate and wellbore diameter. When the gas influx occurs, the <b>surge</b> <b>pressure</b> is weakened obviously. The <b>surge</b> <b>pressure</b> can cause a significant lag time if the gas influx occurs at bottomhole, and it is mainly affected by pressure wave velocity.

40|$|The {{importance}} of ECD prediction was recognized {{at an early}} stage of the drilling history. Narrow pressure windows make the ECD prediction even more important. The variation in ECD with respect to <b>surge</b> and swab <b>pressures</b> is more or less dependent on the tripping velocity of the pipe string. When tripping into a hole the pipe movement causes positive <b>pressures</b> know as <b>surge</b> <b>pressures,</b> while the swab pressures are negative pressures which normally occur during tripping out of the hole. However swab pressures can occur when the string is decelerated during tripping into the hole, likewise <b>surge</b> <b>pressures</b> can occur when tripping out of the hole. According to Burkhardt, there are mainly three effects which can lead to <b>surge</b> pressures; <b>pressure</b> generated by breaking of gelled mud, pressure generated by inertia of mud column and pressure generated from viscous drag of mud column [9]. Clearly the viscous drag of the mud column is the most important contribution to the <b>surge</b> <b>pressure,</b> and also the most complicated one. Burkhardt developed a complicated method which involved finding the viscous drag component of the <b>surge</b> <b>pressure</b> by utilizing a friction factor in the fanning equation. This method was found to complicated for Matlab implementation since it needed several values read from graphs. However approximated Burkhardt equations for laminar and turbulent flow were found useful. The <b>surge</b> <b>pressure</b> could also be found by approximating equations to the computed Bingham pressure loss model for variation in Vp. These equations were in turn corrected with a correction factor for each mud parameter and geometry, by variation of mud parameter, giving a set of New Formulas valid for a range of mud parameters. The two models were implemented in a Matlab script together with the Bingham pressure loss model meant to compute the <b>surge</b> <b>pressure</b> with real-time parameters for a case study. Since the models only evaluated the viscous drag of the mud column, they were considered as steady-state models. The steady-state model did not give good results compared to the measured <b>surge</b> <b>pressure</b> for the case study. However steady-state models were found useful when identifying the peak <b>surge</b> <b>pressure</b> at peak velocity. Addition of pressure effects from inertia of mud column and pressure generated by gelled mud gave good results compared to the measured pressure for the case study. However the two models used requires further field validation before they are accepted as a good surge and swab predictors. It is also recommended that compressibility and tubular elasticity are included to achieve full transformation to a dynamic surge model. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-In a {{piped water}} {{distribution}} system, {{one of the}} hazards in water mains is frequent damage including rupture of the pipe line. The major cause of water hammer is rapid generation of <b>surge</b> <b>pressure</b> mainly due to sudden closure of valve. The occurrence of water hammer is however depends in various flow conditions and characteristics. In a steady state, the pipe flow may be laminar or turbulent. The factors such as pressure, viscosity, frictional stress plays a vital role for occurrence of water hammer. On the other hand, the pipe characteristics namely, material, thickness, length and diameters are all important in this connection. The gradual or rapid closure of valve is also considerable in water hammer study. A one-dimensional propagation of water surge in a pipe material has been studied theoretically with a simple conservation of energy model. The numerical solution for different times of valve closing, pipe materials, lengths, diameter has been worked out. It has been observed that the <b>surge</b> <b>pressure</b> depends intensely with time, pipe material and diameter; however, not much dependent on length. In the present study, the water hammer surge for an elastic pipe is worked out. Under similar conditions, a difference in <b>surge</b> <b>pressure</b> transmission is observed than a rigid pipe. The paper also discusses the <b>surge</b> <b>pressure</b> leading to rapid opening of valve leading to water hammer surge for valve closure.

The Core spacecraft's propulsion system is a blowdown monopropellant system with an initial hydrazine load of 545 kg in a single composite overwrapped propellant tank. At launch, the propulsion system contained propellant in the tank and manifold tubes upstream of the latch valves, with low-pressure helium gas in the manifold tubes downstream of the latch valves. The system had a relatively high beginning-of- life pressure and long downstream manifold lines; these factors created conditions that were conducive to high <b>surge</b> <b>pressures.</b> This paper discusses the GPM project's approach to surge mitigation in the propulsion system design.

It is configured in two inline stages: the First Stage is a Space Shuttle derived five-segment Solid Rocket Booster and the Upper Stage {{is powered by}} a Saturn V derived J- 2 X engine. During launch, roll control for the First Stage (FS) is handled by a dedicated Roll Control System (RoCS) located on the connecting Interstage. That system will provide the Ares I with the ability to counteract induced roll torque while any induced yaw or pitch moments are handled by vectoring of the booster nozzle. This paper provides an overview of NASA s Ares I FS RoCS cold flow development test program including detailed test objectives, types of tests run to meet those objectives, an overview of the results, and applicable lessons learned. The test article was built and tested at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, AL. The FS RoCS System Development Test Article (SDTA) is a full scale, flight representative water flow test article whose primary objective was to obtain fluid system performance data to evaluate integrated system level performance characteristics and verify analytical models. Development testing and model correlation was deemed necessary as there is little historical precedent for similar large flow, pulsing systems such as the FS RoCS. The cold flow development test program consisted of flight-similar tanks, pressure regulators, and thruster valves, as well as plumbing simulating flight geometries, combined with other facility grade components and structure. Orifices downstream of the thruster valves were used to simulate the pressure drop through the thrusters. Additional primary objectives of this test program were to: evaluate system <b>surge</b> <b>pressure</b> (waterhammer) <b>characteristics</b> due to thruster valve operation over a range of mission duty cycles at various feed system pressures, evaluate temperature transients and heat transfer in the pressurization system, including regulator blowdown and propellant ullage performance, measure system pressure drops for comparison to analysis of tubing and components, and validate system activation and re-activation procedures for the helium pressurant system. Secondary objectives included: validating system processes for loading, unloading, and purging, validating procedures and system response for multiple failure scenarios, including relief valve operation, and evaluating system performance for contingency scenarios. The test results of the cold flow development test program are essential in validating the performance and interaction of the Roll Control System and anchoring analysis tools and results to a Critical Design Review level of fidelity...|$|R

Flow instabilities are unwanted because they can reduce the efficiency of the industrial process.

Subsequently, the location of all five metatarsal heads was identified, using the same size of masks and the same protocol. The 2 D positional variation of the masks and the peak pressure (PP) and pressure time integral (PTI) values of each mask were calculated. For single-masking the lowest inter-observer reliability was found for the distal-proximal direction, causing a clear, adverse impact on the reliability of the <b>pressure</b> <b>characteristics</b> (PP and PTI).
