500|$|Regardless of the {{inconsistent}} chapter headings across manuscripts, {{the work}} {{is made up of}} three distinct sections. The first of these deals with the concepts of procreation and generation, largely according to the doctrines of Aristotle and Galen. This section opens by stressing the important influence of the stars before it deals with topics concerning human sexual intercourse. The book then moves onto the topics of conception and birth, and the author then explores the physical <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> The final two chapters of this section deal with animals; the penultimate chapter focuses on [...] "animals in genere et in specie" [...] (i.e. in regards to genus and species), while the final lays forth a classification and differentiation system for animals.|$|E
500|$|Fascinated, {{the king}} then sent surgeon Cyriacus Ahlers to Guildford. [...] Ahlers arrived on 20November and found Toft exhibiting no <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> [...] He {{may have already}} {{suspected}} the affair was a hoax and observed that Toft seemed to press her knees and thighs together, as if to prevent something from [...] "dropping down". [...] He thought Howard's behaviour just as suspicious, as the man-midwife would not let him help deliver the rabbits—although Ahlers was not a man-midwife and in an earlier attempt had apparently put Toft through considerable pain. [...] Convinced the affair was a hoax, he lied, telling those involved that he believed Toft's story, before making his excuses and returning to London, taking specimens of the rabbits with him. [...] Upon closer study, he reportedly found evidence of them having been cut with a man-made instrument, and noted pieces of straw and grain in their droppings.|$|E
5000|$|In medicine, Piskacek's sign is an {{indication}} <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> This <b>sign,</b> however, {{may or may not}} be a concrete probability <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> along with other <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> early <b>pregnancy.</b> Other <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> early <b>pregnancy</b> include Goodell, Hegar, von Braun Fernwald, and Chadwick.|$|R
50|$|Ladin's sign is a {{clinical}} <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> {{in which there}} is softening in the midline of the uterus anteriorly at the junction of the uterus and cervix. It occurs at about 6 weeks gestation.|$|R
50|$|Chadwick's sign is a bluish {{discoloration}} of the cervix, vagina, and labia {{resulting from}} increased blood flow. It {{can be observed}} as early as 6 to 8 weeks after conception, and its presence is an early <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy.</b>|$|R
500|$|Tosca {{was one of}} Flower's oldest daughters, {{described}} as [...] "rebellious" [...] in the first series opening sequence. Her research name, given to her by the Kalahari Meerkat Project researchers, is actually Baddiel. In the first episode, Tosca showed <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> When the pups were born two episodes later, Flower declined to exercise her right to kill them and allowed them to be accepted into the family. [...] Three episodes later, while the pups were only seven weeks old, Flower evicted Tosca from the Whiskers, forcing the new mother to leave her pups behind. When the Whiskers were temporarily split into two groups in the next episode, Tosca found the splinter group and took over leadership from her sister Daisy. Believing the split would be permanent, Tosca was then fitted with a radio collar by the project researchers. However, the two groups reunited, and after Flower resumed her role as dominate female of the group, she permanently and viciously evicted Tosca.|$|E
500|$|Thanksgiving {{services}} in the diocese of London were held {{at the end of}} April after false rumours that Mary had given birth to a son spread across Europe. Through May and June, the apparent delay in delivery fed gossip that Mary was not pregnant. Susan Clarencieux revealed her doubts to the French ambassador, Antoine de Noailles. Mary continued to exhibit <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> until July 1555, when her abdomen receded. There was no baby. Michieli dismissively ridiculed the pregnancy as more likely to [...] "end in wind rather than anything else". It was most likely a false pregnancy, perhaps induced by Mary's overwhelming desire to have a child. In August, soon after the disgrace of the false pregnancy, which Mary considered to be [...] "God's punishment" [...] for her having [...] "tolerated heretics" [...] in her realm, Philip left England to command his armies against France in Flanders. Mary was heartbroken and fell into a deep depression. Michieli was touched by the queen's grief; he wrote she was [...] "extraordinarily in love" [...] with her husband, and was disconsolate at his departure.|$|E

50|$|Pregnancy is {{perceived}} positively in India, and most married women are extremely happy to learn <b>of</b> their <b>pregnancy.</b> Fertility is highly valued, {{and community members}} may begin to look negatively upon a woman if she is married for a year without any <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> If a couple is infertile, they will often seek {{out a piece of}} dried skin from the umbilical cord of a friend’s baby. Eating this is believed to improve fertility.|$|R
30|$|The {{dependent}} variable {{of this study}} is the number of ANC service visits of pregnant women from early pregnancy to their 9  months <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> period. This research attempts to include socioeconomic, demographic, health and environmental related factors that are assumed as a potential determinant for the barriers in the number of antenatal care service visits. These factors are presented: Wealth index, Utilization of media, Type of residence, Age of mother’s, Mother’s education, marital status, Birth order and <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> complications.|$|R

5000|$|There were no <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{pregnancy}}</b> {{and birth}} in Narjis. Hakimah Khatun {{has said that}} the [...] "pregnancy of Narjis was like pregnancy of Moses and Jesus without any signs {{for the protection of the}} child". That is because the Abbasid decided to kill the expected child, who was known as the savior. After the birth of the child, Hasan al-Askari revealed the child to his forty close followers and then the child was hidden.|$|E

5000|$|The {{corpus luteum}} (the remains of an ovulated ovarian follicle) is {{responsible}} for the development of maternal behavior and lactation, which are mediated by the continued production of progesterone by the corpus luteum through some or all of pregnancy. In most species, the corpus luteum is degraded {{in the absence of a}} pregnancy. However, in some species, the corpus luteum may persist in the absence of pregnancy and cause [...] "pseudopregnancy", in which the female will exhibit clinical <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy.</b>|$|E

30|$|Table  5, the {{expected}} number of ANC visits {{of pregnant women}} from 9  month pregnancy periods for a seen <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> complications is 1.2554 {{times more likely than}} {{the expected}} number of ANC visits for no seen <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> complications while holding all other variables in the model constant. The expected number of ANC visits for a use of media is 1.1269 times the expected number of ANC visits for not use of media while holding all other variables in the model constant. That is, the higher utilize media, the fewer predicted ANC visits. The expected number of non zero ANC visits for the rich wealth index would be 1.3297 times the expected number of non-zero ANC visits for the poor wealth index. Similarly the middle wealth index is higher than poor wealth index. The expected number of non zero ANC visits of rural women would be 0.848 times the expected number of non zero ANC visits of the urban women. That means If a subject were to increase rural women by one point, the expected number of ANC visits would decrease by a factor of exp(−  0.1652) =  0.84772 while holding all other variables in the model constant.|$|R
50|$|Uterine souffle is a soft, blowing sound heard using a stethoscope, {{usually in}} the second {{trimester}} <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> (13-28 weeks). This sound is heard most clearly in {{the lower part of}} the uterus and is synchronous with the pulse of the mother. The uterine souffle is produced by the rush of blood through the dilated vessels of the uterus. On auscultation, uterine souffle may often be confused with funic souffle, which is a sharp, whistling sound that is synchronous with the pulse of the foetus. Therefore, the maternal pulse must be palpated simultaneously in order to confirm uterine souffle. Uterine souffle is considered as a probable objective <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy.</b>|$|R
40|$|Clomiphene citrate (2 mg/kg body wt) {{given on}} the day of mating can block or {{interrupt}} pregnancy in guinea-pigs. Corpus luteum function, uterine histology, implantation and embryo development were studied in clomiphene-treated and control animals on Days 5, 9 and 20 <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> Following treatment, only 25 % of the females were regularly pregnant, presenting large and healthy foetuses. The other females examined showed either pregnancy with embryos undergoing resorption or no <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> In these females, corpus luteum size was reduced, progesterone concentrations were very low and the endometrial glands and the epithelium were often altered. It is concluded that clomiphene causes a reduction in fertility by altering the uterus and, by directly or indirectly inducing luteolysis, causes later pregnancy loss...|$|R

50|$|In 1970 and 1971 {{the rights}} of {{pregnant}} schoolteachers were called into question.

30|$|It {{is notable}} {{that we did}} not have all the classic {{symptoms}} and <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> ectopic <b>pregnancy</b> but it is only the high index of suspicion in an high risk lady that led to a timely diagnosis and treatment and more importantly early discharge because of laparoscopic surgery.
