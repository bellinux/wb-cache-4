40|$|Background {{and aims}} <b>Soil</b> {{aggregate}} <b>stability</b> depends on plant community properties, such as functional group composition, diversity and biomass production. However, {{little is known}} about the relative importance of these drivers and the role of soil organisms in mediating plant community effects. Methods We studied <b>soil</b> aggregate <b>stability</b> in an experimental grassland plant diversity gradient and considered several explanatory variables to mechanistically explain effects of plant diversity and plant functional group composition. Three <b>soil</b> aggregate <b>stability</b> measures (slaking, mechanical breakdown and microcracking) were considered in path analyses. Results <b>Soil</b> aggregate <b>stability</b> increased significantly from monocultures to plant species mixtures and in the presence of grasses, while it decreased in the presence of legumes, though effects differed somewhat between <b>soil</b> aggregate <b>stability</b> measures. Using path analysis plant community effects could be explained by variations in root biomass, soil microbial biomass, soil organic carbon concentrations (all positive relationships), and earthworm biomass (negative relationship with mechanical breakdown). Conclusions The present study identified important drivers of plant community effects on <b>soil</b> aggregate <b>stability.</b> The effects of root biomass, soil microbial biomass, and soil organic carbon concentrations were largely consistent across plant diversity levels suggesting that the mechanisms identified are of general relevance...|$|R
40|$|<b>Soil</b> {{aggregate}} <b>stability</b> is a {{key factor}} in soil resistance to water erosion, which is a threat to soils in a large part of northern Tunisia. The analysis of the spatial variability of <b>soil</b> aggregate <b>stability</b> provides both agronomic and environmentally useful information. However, extensive measurements of <b>soil</b> aggregate <b>stability</b> remain tedious and expensive. This study explores two different approaches as alternative to measurements of <b>soil</b> aggregate <b>stability.</b> One approach estimated aggregate stability via laboratory measurements of soil elementary properties using multiple linear regressions known as pedotransfer functions. The second approach, which is methodologically innovating, was based on the geological pattern as a proxy for aggregate stability using regression-kriging analysis. A set of 113 soil samples from an 800 km(2) agricultural region that included the Lebna watershed (Cap Bon, Tunisia) were collected from the soil surface layer (0 - 10 cm depth). Samples were analyzed for elementary properties (i. e., soil texture, total Carbon and nitrogen, iron, CaCO 3, salinity, CEC and pH) and for <b>soil</b> aggregate <b>stability</b> according to the normalized method (ISO/DIS 10930, 2012), which considers three indexes (MWD) calculated for three contrasted wetting conditions and disruptive energies. Most soils in the study area were non-salted with an alkaline pH and relatively low organic carbon content. Of the soils, 35 % were clay soils, and 55 % had a balanced soil texture. The average of the three <b>soil</b> aggregate <b>stability</b> indexes (MWDmean,) ranged from 038 to 2. 80 mm, and this property showed large variability from instable soils to very stable ones. Analysis of pedotransfer functions determined that the best predictor variables for <b>soil</b> aggregate <b>stability</b> were silt, organic matter and iron.

40|$|<b>Soil</b> {{aggregate}} <b>stability</b> {{data are}} often predicted to be {{positively associated with}} measures of plant productivity, rangeland health, and ecosystem functioning. Here we revisit the hypothesis that <b>soil</b> aggregate <b>stability</b> is positively associated with plant productivity. We measured local (plot-to-plot) variation in grassland community composition, plant (aboveground) biomass, root biomass, % water-stable soil aggregates, and topography. After accounting for spatial autocorrelation, we observed a negative association between % water-stable soil aggregates (0. 25 - 1 and 1 - 2 mm size classes of macroaggregates) and dominant graminoid biomass, and negative associations between the % water-stable aggregates and the root biomass of a dominant sedge (Carex filifolia). However, variation in total root biomass (0 - 10 or 0 - 30 cm depths) was either negatively or not appreciably associated with <b>soil</b> aggregate <b>stabilities.</b> Overall, regression slope coefficients were consistently negative thereby indicating the general absence of a positive association between measures of plant productivity and <b>soil</b> aggregate <b>stability</b> for the study area. The predicted positive association between factors was likely confounded by variation in plant species composition. Specifically, sampling spanned a local gradient in plant community composition which was likely driven by niche partitioning along a subtle gradient in elevation. Our results suggest an apparent trade-off between some measures of plant biomass production and <b>soil</b> aggregate <b>stability,</b> both known to affect the land's capacity to resist erosion.

Estimating moss and lichen cover is fairly easy and non-destructive, but documenting cyanobacterial level of development (LOD) is more difficult.

Particle size distribution (PSD) and aggregate stability are the important characteristics of <b>soil.</b> Aggregate <b>stability</b> {{has a significant}} impact on the development of the root system, water and carbon cycle and soil resistance against soil erosion. <b>Soil</b> aggregate <b>stability,</b> defined as the ability of the aggregates to remain intact when subject to a given stress, is an important soil property that affects the movement and storage of water, aeration, erosion, biological activity and growth of crops. Dry <b>soil</b> aggregate <b>stability</b> (Mean Weight Diameter (MWD), Geometric Mean Diameter (GMD)) and Wet Aggregate Stability (WAS) are important indices for evaluating <b>soil</b> aggregate <b>stability.</b> To improve <b>soil</b> physical properties, including modifying aggregate, using various additives (organic, inorganic and chemicals), zeolites are among what has been studied. According to traditional definition, zeolites are hydratealuminosilicates of alkaline and alkaline-earth minerals. Their structure is made up of a framework of[SiO 4]− 4 and [AlO 4]− 5 tetrahedron linked to each other's cornersby sharing oxygen atoms. The substitution of Si+ 4 by Al+ 3 intetrahedral sites results inmore negative charges and a high cation exchange capacity. Zeolites, as natural cation exchangers, are suitable substitutes to remove toxic cations. Among the natural zeolites,Clinoptilolite seems to be the most efficient ion exchanger and ion-selective material forremoving and stabilizing heavy metals. Due to theexisting insufficient technical information on the effects of using different levels of zeolite on physical properties of different types of soils in Iran, the aim of this research was to assess the effects of two different types of zeolite (Clinoptilolite natural zeolite, Z 4, and Synthetic zeolite, A 4) on aggregate <b>stability</b> indicesof <b>soil.</b> Materials and Methods: In this study at first, after preparation of two different types of soil with light and medium texture and doing identification tests such as determination of gradation and hydrometer tests and Atterberg limits, zeolite in four levels, 0 (control), 1...|$|R
