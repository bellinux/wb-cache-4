40|$|The {{subject of}} this {{dissertation}} thesis was to analyse the wide spectrum of corrosion and material problems in exacting and ecological important environments, first of all in flue gas desulphurisation systems in power stations combustioning fossil fuels. There exists evidence that <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxid,</b> produced by combustion of coal, forms toxic substances that are dangerous to the living environment. Large part {{of this paper is}} about application of unique corrosion probes installed in flue gas ducts in power stations. The corrosion probes are welded together from the sample tubes of stainless steels and nickel alloys. These materials could be used for construction of the FGD, heating plants, refuse incinerating plants and others. The one of corrosion problems in FGD systems is intergranular attack which often occurs in heat influenced areas of welds. For the non-destructive testing of resistance to intergranular corrosion is suitable EPR test method. The Electrochemical Potentiokinetic Reactivation method is used for measuring of the degree of sensitisation to intergranular corrosion of stainless steels and nickel alloys now. This thesis includes some results of EPR tests a suitable materials for corrosion control in FGD units. In the experimental part of this work was implemented two head intentions: The first intention of this work was to set up program for the calculation thermic and temperature conditions on corrosion probes. The second intention was to extend the EPR method for the group of nickel alloysAvailable from STL Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|E
