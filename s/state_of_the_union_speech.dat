25|$|The House of Representatives Chamber has 448 {{permanent}} seats. Unlike Senators, Representatives do {{not have}} assigned seats. The chamber {{is large enough to}} accommodate members of all three branches of the federal government and invited guests for joint sessions of Congress such as the <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>speech</b> and other events. It is adorned with relief portraits of famous lawmakers and lawgivers throughout history. Of the twenty-three relief portraits only Moses is sculpted from a full front view and is located across from the dais where the Speaker of the House ceremonially sits.|$|E
25|$|President Obama also {{attempted}} to address inequality before taxes (i.e., market income), {{with an increase}} in the minimum wage and infrastructure investment. While the Republican Congress did not support a federally-mandated {{increase in the minimum wage}}, 18 states did increase their minimum wages, benefiting an estimated 7 million workers, following the President's 2013 <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>speech</b> calling for an increase. During late 2015, the House and Senate, in rare bipartisan form, passed the largest infrastructure package in a decade, costing $305 billion over five years, less than the $478 billion in Obama's initial request. He signed the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act into law in December 2015.|$|E

500|$|Prior to June 2014, Obama offered {{substantial}} {{support for a}} broadly-based [...] "All of the above" [...] approach to domestic energy policy, which Obama has maintained since his first term and which he last confirmed at his <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>speech</b> in January 2014 to a mixed reception by both parties. In June 2014, Obama made indications that his administration would consider a shift towards an energy policy more closely tuned to the manufacturing industry {{and its impact on}} the domestic economy. Obama's approach of selectively combining regulation and incentive to various issues in the domestic energy policy such as coal mining and oil fracking has received mixed commentary for not being as responsive to the needs of the domestic manufacturing sector as needed, following claims that the domestic manufacturing sector utilizes as much as a third of the nation's available energy resources.|$|E
500|$|R.A., {{writing on}} The Economists Free Exchange blog, {{concluded}} that Cowen's analysis of education {{suggested that the}} rich world would do better by aiding mass education programs in developing countries rather than pursuing the diminishing returns in domestic education and research, in contrary [...] to President Obama's <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>speech</b> in 2011. Looser immigration law would also allow rich and poor countries to exploit this source of growth. Secondly, it proposed to harvest [...] "policy low-hanging fruit" [...] i.e. reforming or abolishing foolish and costly policies. It proposed taxing [...] "bads" [...] such as traffic congestion and pollution rather than [...] "goods" [...] such as income, reducing spending on medical treatments with no clear benefits, and removing agricultural subsidies and mortgage interest reduction. In The Economist, two different sets of policy responses were considered {{depending on whether the}} true cause is ailing technological innovation or a decline in workers' bargaining power in the face of emerging-market industrialization. Progressive taxation and redistribution would offset labor's position of weakness whilst a limited state would reduce commitments it cannot expect to fulfill in a stagnating economy.|$|E
2500|$|López Obrador led a rally {{on the day}} of the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>union</b> <b>speech,</b> where sympathizers {{celebrated the}} President being {{prevented}} from delivering his speech inside congress. They claimed that the President [...] "had created a police state" [...] in the area around the Congress building and interpreted it as a violation of the Constitution that made it impossible for Congress to be called into session, and thereby enabling Fox to address the chamber. He explicitly told his followers not to be lured into violent confrontations, declaring, [...] "We aren't going to fall into any trap. We aren't going to be provoked". [...] He also asked his followers to remain in the Zócalo, instead of marching to the legislative palace, the site of the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>union</b> <b>speech,</b> as had been planned.|$|E

2500|$|Bachmann {{responded to}} President Obama's 2011 <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>speech</b> for the Tea Party Express website; this speech was {{broadcast}} live by CNN. She insisted that her response {{was not intended}} to counter the official Republican party response by Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. When asked if the speech was an indication of competition with Ryan and Speaker Boehner's leadership team, Bachmann dismissed such a view as [...] "a fiction of the media", she had alerted Ryan and the leadership team that her response might go national and no objections were raised.|$|E
2500|$|Although the United States {{declared}} war on Germany on April 6, 1917, it did not initially declare war on the other Central Powers, a state of affairs that Woodrow Wilson described as an [...] "embarrassing obstacle" [...] in his <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>speech.</b> Congress {{declared war}} on the Austro-Hungarian Empire on December 7, 1917, but never made declarations of war against the other Central Powers, Bulgaria, the Ottoman Empire or the various co-belligerents allied with the Central Powers. Thus, the United States remained uninvolved in the military campaigns {{in central and eastern}} Europe, the Middle East, the Caucasus, North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and the Pacific.|$|E

Bush proposed the American Competitiveness Initiative which seeks to support increasing competitiveness of the U.S. economy, with greater development of advanced technologies, as well as greater education and support for American students. [...] In the 2007 <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>speech,</b> President Bush proposed a 20:10 policy, where, as a nation, the United States would be working to reduce 20% of the national energy usage in next 10 years by converting to ethanol.|$|E
2500|$|He favored {{raising it}} to $9.50 an hour by 2011, and then {{indexing}} it for inflation afterwards. In his <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>speech</b> in 2012, he hinted at proposing legislation to raise minimum wage rate to $9.00/hr sometime during his next term. [...] In January 2014 he signed {{an executive order}} raising the minimum wage for federal [...] "workers who are performing services or constructing buildings" [...] to $10.10/hr and began garnering support for a bill to enact this change nationally.

2500|$|The Twentieth Amendment also {{established}} January 20 {{as the beginning}} of the presidential term. In years when a new president is inaugurated, the outgoing president may deliver a final State of the Union message, but none has done so since Jimmy Carter sent a written message in 1981. In 1953 and 1961, Congress received both a written State of the Union message from the outgoing president and a separate <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>speech</b> by the incoming president. Since 1989, in recognition that the responsibility of reporting the State of the Union formally belongs to the president who held office during the past year, newly inaugurated Presidents have not officially called their first speech before Congress a [...] "State of the Union" [...] message.|$|E
