25|$|This ratio {{estimates}} {{how many}} times the inventory turns over a year. This number tells how much cash/goods are tied up waiting for the process and is a critical measure of process reliability and effectiveness. So a factory with two inventory turns has six months <b>stock</b> <b>on</b> <b>hand,</b> which is generally not a good figure (depending upon the industry), whereas a factory that moves from six turns to twelve turns has probably improved effectiveness by 100%. This improvement will have some negative results in the financial reporting, since the 'value' now stored in the factory as inventory is reduced.|$|E

Keep, elected president of the Central on December 12, 1866, immediately revoked the yearly payment. An outraged Vanderbilt stopped carrying all Central freight. Steamboats could not move the Central's cargoes because the Hudson River was frozen due to a harsh winter. Freight backed up in Albany, and New York City was effectively cut off by rail. The Central's stock price fell. In an attempt to make money off the situation, Keep borrowed a significant number of shares to sell short. Flooding the market with shares only drove the price further downward, and Vanderbilt and his allies quickly purchased these shares. [...] This forced Keep to pay his lenders out of his own pocket, hurting him financially, and allowed the Vanderbilt group to gain control of the Central.

40|$|We use {{a stylized}} optimization/simulation model {{to study the}} {{behavior}} of crop markets in response to climate variations and climate forecasts. In the model, farmers choose area planted to each crop, consumers and stockholders arbitrage across time, and traders arbitrage across regions. Climate forecasts cause some degree of planting specialization depending on the quantity of <b>stocks</b> <b>on</b> <b>hand</b> and access to imports and exports. Because the elasticity of demand facing the region is inelastic, improved climate forecasts cause a decline in farm profits, but consumers gain more so net global income increases. Trade barriers diminish the incentives to respond to climate forecasts, and so dramatically reduce their value. Thus, we show in this framework that the economic activities of storage and trade are complements not substitutes for climate information...|$|R

It has been estimated that 95 percent of the sweet corn grown in the United States is used for canning, and no doubt this percentage would be about the same for Iowa. - The acreage grown in any one year in Iowa depends largely on the price the canner received for the canned product the previous year and the carry-over of canned sweet com from the previous year’s pack.
