5|$|At {{the end of}} the speech, Sir Austen Chamberlain {{walked down}} and <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> brother's hand. The Import Duties Act 1932 passed Parliament easily. The Ottawa Conference that August {{produced}} little result, with Chamberlain bringing home several minor bilateral trade agreements, and no general agreement.|$|E
5|$|Cornwallis {{refused to}} attend the {{surrender}} ceremony, citing illness. Instead, Brigadier General Charles O'Hara led the British army onto the field. O'Hara first attempted to surrender to Rochambeau, who <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> head and pointed to Washington. O'Hara then offered his sword to Washington, who also refused and motioned to Benjamin Lincoln. The surrender finally took place when Washington's second-in-command accepted the sword of Cornwallis' deputy.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{spent most}} of this time {{exploring}} on land: three years and three months on land, 18 months at sea. Early in the voyage {{he decided that he}} could write a book about geology, and he showed a gift for theorising. At Punta Alta he made a major find of gigantic fossils of extinct mammals, then known from only a very few specimens. He ably collected and made detailed observations of plants and animals, with results that <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> belief that species were fixed and provided the basis for ideas which came to him when back in England, and led to his theory of evolution by natural selection.|$|E

5|$|In the second, the Soviets {{started with}} a quick goal by Shadrin after 21 seconds. The last ten minutes saw two goals from the Soviets: Yakushev scoring his seventh of the series {{followed}} by Vasiliev on the power play to put the Soviets ahead 5–3 after two periods. White had countered for Canada midway through the period. It was one of few moments for Canada to cheer as the Soviets played an excellent period. The other was a goal-saving play by Esposito who stopped a shot by Yury Blinov who had faked goaltender Dryden out of position and had an empty net to shoot at. Blinov was denied by Esposito who stopped the puck with his stick on the goal line. Blinov and the crowd had prematurely celebrated the apparent goal, and Blinov <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> head in disbelief.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match against Oxford University, Loxton {{came in at}} 4/206 and {{anchored}} the innings, remaining unbeaten on 79 as Australia were bowled out for 431. He featured in partnerships with Colin McCool and Doug Ring, who both made fifties. He then took the new ball in both innings, taking 1/14 and 1/16 from five and eight overs respectively in another innings victory. When Oxford batted, Philip Whitcombe struck a delivery from Ernie Toshack to Loxton, and {{took a few steps}} out of his crease. Loxton prepared to throw at the Whitcombe's stumps in a run out attempt, but did not release, while Whitcombe stood his ground outside the crease. In those days, the fielding standards were lower, with weaker and less accurate throws and Whitcombe was only a metre or two outside his crease, while Loxton was around thirty away. The next delivery from Toshack was again hit to Loxton, and Whitcombe again wandered outside his crease. This time Loxton threw the ball and hit the stumps directly, running out the batsman, who was unable to comprehend what had happened and <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> head.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many of his}} countrymen, Słowacki {{decided to}} stay in France as a {{political}} refugee. In 1832 he published his first collections of poems and his first two dramas (Mindowe and Maria Stuart). He also met Mickiewicz again; reportedly, Mickiewicz approached his younger colleague and <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> hand. However, Słowacki's poems, written in the 1820s, were unpopular among his Polish compatriots, as they failed to capture the sentiment of a people living under foreign occupation. Słowacki was angered by Mickiewicz, who not only stole the limelight with his Księgi narodu polskiego i pielgrzymstwa polskiego (Books of the Polish nation and pilgrimage), but his part three of Dziady (1832) cast Słowacki's stepfather, professor Bécu, {{in the role of}} a villain. In a letter to his mother Słowacki wrote that immediately after reading that work he was ready to challenge Mickiewicz for a duel; that did not come to pass but from that moment on, Słowacki would see Mickiewicz as his main rival. Few days later, antagonized by worsening reception of his works among the Polish émigré community in Paris, including sharp criticism from Mickiewicz, Słowacki left on a trip to Geneva, Switzerland. The French authorities denied him the right to return to France {{as part of a larger}} program to rid the country of the potentially subversive Polish exiles who had settled there.|$|E

25|$|After {{the reading}} of the apology statement, the jury foreman {{personally}} handed the statement to Arbuckle who kept it as a treasured memento {{for the rest of his}} life. Then, one by one, the entire 12-person jury plus the two jury alternates walked up to Arbuckle's defense table where they <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> hand and/or embraced and personally apologized to him. The entire jury even proudly posed in a photo op with Arbuckle for photographers after the verdict and apology.|$|E

25|$|Behra {{came down}} into trees and rolled almost into a street where drivers and cars often waited in a paddock to practice. A doctor arrived from a Red Cross {{ambulance}} close by.

25|$|Nimzovich {{suffered}} from the delusion that he was unappreciated and that the reason was malice. All it took to make him blossom, as I later learned, was a little praise. His paranoia was most evident when he dined in company. He always thought he was served much smaller portions than everyone else. He didn't care about the actual amount but only about the imagined affront. I once suggested that he and I order what the other actually wanted and, when the food was served, exchange plates. After we had done so, he <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> head in disbelief, still thinking that he had received the smaller portion.|$|E
25|$|White House {{correspondent}} Seth Kantor — who was {{a passenger}} in the motorcade — testified that after President Kennedy was shot, he had visited Parkland Hospital while the wounded President was receiving care. Kantor said that {{as he entered the}} hospital, at about 1:30 pm, he felt a tug on his coat. He turned around to see Jack Ruby who called him by his first name and <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> hand; {{he said that he had}} become acquainted with Ruby while he was a reporter for the Dallas Times Herald newspaper. According to Kantor, Ruby asked him if he thought that it would be a good idea for him to close his nightclubs for the next three nights because of the tragedy and Kantor responded with thinking that doing so would be a good idea.|$|E

25|$|On March 19, Obama {{became the}} first sitting {{president}} to appear on a late night talk show {{when he was a}} guest on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. On April 2, Obama attended the G-20 London Summit. On April 17–19 he attended the 5th Summit of the Americas where he met Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez, a longtime enemy of Washington, who <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> hand and gave him the book Las venas abiertas de América Latina (Open Veins of Latin America) of Eduardo Galeano while media was present. On April 28, day 99 of Obama's presidency, Senator Arlen Specter (a former Democrat who switched to the Republican party in 1966) returned to the Democratic Party. Specter increased the Democratic senators to 59, one short of a filibuster-proof majority. At the conclusion of the first 100 days, over 100 federal judgeships remained vacant.|$|E
25|$|Rhodes and Cordingley were {{competing}} {{for a place}} in the Yorkshire team after the sacking of Bobby Peel in 1897. Cordingley was, at that stage, as well qualified for the position as Rhodes and had good reports from his time playing with Lytham. In a trial match {{at the end of the}} 1897 season, Cordingley took eight wickets for 33 runs for Yorkshire against the Yorkshire Colts team, and also took three wickets against the senior Yorkshire side in another game. In the same games, Rhodes took just two wickets for 99 runs. At the start of the 1898 season, both Cordingley and Rhodes played for Yorkshire Colts against Nottinghamshire Colts; Rhodes took one wicket for 14 and Cordingley took four for 37. Two days later, both men were included in the squad for Yorkshire against the Marylebone Cricket Club (M.C.C.). According to one story, Yorkshire captain Lord Hawke and leading amateur cricketer Stanley Jackson could not agree on which player to leave out, and chose Rhodes after spinning a coin. However, Hawke later denied this was the case. He claimed always to believe Rhodes the better bowler and said that Jackson came to the same view after seeing Rhodes bowling during practice. Rhodes took six for 33 in the game and was chosen to play in the next match, but Cordingley remained in the squad. However, during the game he received news of the death of his mother and returned home. Rhodes meanwhile took 13 wickets in the game and Cordingley accepted that there was no likelihood of taking his place. This gave rise to a legend that after seeing Rhodes bowl in his first match, Cordingley, accepting Rhodes' superiority, <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> hand and returned home without completing the team's tour of the South of England. Rhodes remained in the side for the rest of the season and took 141 wickets for Yorkshire. He was named one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year and played for England the following season. He went on to take 4,184 wickets in a career lasting until 1930.|$|E
