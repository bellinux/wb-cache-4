40|$|Information flow type systems, such as EnerJ (a type {{system for}} energy e ciency), and {{integrity}} and confidentiality, are unsound if <b>subtyping</b> <b>for</b> references is allowed {{because of the}} presence of mutable references. The standard approach is to disallow <b>subtyping</b> <b>for</b> references, or in other words, replace subtyping constraints with equality constraints. Unfortunately, this often leads to imprecision, causing the type system to reject valid programs. We observe that subtyping is safe when the left-hand-side of the assignment is immutable. Therefore, we compose information flow systems with reference immutability, which allows <b>for</b> limited <b>subtyping</b> <b>for</b> references. We infer types with the standard approach (i. e., no <b>subtyping</b> <b>for</b> references), and with the composition approach on 13 Java web applications. The composition approach achieves at least 20 % precision improvement over the standard approach...|$|R
