In 1995, 35 percent of the students enrolled in public schools were multicultural 1 students of color (National Center for Education Statistics, 2002) and this number is expected to grow to 46 percent by 2020 (Pallas, Natriello, 2 ̆ 6 McDill, 1989). In <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> 2 ̆ 7 s largest cities, the population of multicultural students has already exceeded the percentage of White students (Banks, 1994). In contrast, White teachers represent 90 percent of the public school teachers and 85 percent of the education graduates in 1999 – 2000 (NCES, 2002). The demographic disparity between students and teachers suggests a need for increased attention toward multicultural teaching strategies and multicultural competency, areas that have remained relatively unexamined in the preparation of White teachers (Howard, 1999). ^ Teachers 2 ̆ 7 lack of multicultural competency, including skills and knowledge regarding multicultural education, may contribute to their inability to increase student achievement. On a large scale this lowered competency and skills may explain gaps in achievement and underrepresentation and overrepresentation in gifted and special education programs. This mixed-methods study investigated the concept of multicultural competency—recognized as one of the goals of multicultural education—as a strategy for improving teacher-student cross-cultural relations (Gay, 1994). Data were collected from 162 preservice and inservice teachers using two survey instruments, the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (MEIM) (Phinney, 1992), the Multicultural Education 2 ̆ 6 Cultural Competency Assessment (MECCA) (Boyd, 2002), and 12 in-depth case studies.

Its {{location}} in Riverside County-which is within close proximity to <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> 2 ̆ 7 s wealthiest citizens and also the U. S. -Mexico border-along with the county 2 ̆ 7 s dependence onthe agriculture industry has contributed to a significant demand for low-wage farm workers, who often have a mix of immigration statuses. Historical, political, and socioeconomic factors have compounded to limit affordable housing options in the Coachella Valley for these farm workers and have generated the proliferation of illegal trailer parks with egregious habitability concerns on the vast swathes of Indian country throughout the county. Tribal sovereignty renders these parks beyond the reach of prophylactic state and local laws that would otherwise protect the health, safety, and welfare of the parks 2 ̆ 7 residents. Consequently, these parks are subject only to the jurisdiction of federal courts. In United States v. Duro, a federal judge appointed a receiver to oversee urgent infrastructure improvements in Duroville, one of the largest parks. Receivership is arguably the strongest and most invasive articulation of a court 2 ̆ 7 s equitable powers because it strips a party of his property rights and vests control of the property in question to a third party that is accountable only to the court. The court 2 ̆ 7 s action in appointing a receiver was a key factor in the provision of a safe relocation site for Duroville 2 ̆ 7 s residents, which required a concerted effort by the County, the State, and a private housing developer. This Comment explores the implications that this groundbreaking case has for other trailer parks on Indian country in the Coachella Valley. Ultimately, it concludes that the Duroville receivership was a necessary and legitimate extension of the court 2 ̆ 7 s equitable powers and that receivership can be an effective means both to remedy urgent habitability problems in other trailer parks on Indian land and to spur local government actors to work towards providing decent, safe, and affordable housing alternatives for residents of these parks...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} environmentalism in the United States. The dimension of perspective receives considerable attention. The prevailing perspective by a society regarding the importance of the health of the natural world greatly influences the degree of support of environmental organizations, environmental policy, as well as the direction charted for the future of that society. The perspectives of the Native Americans and the dominant European cultures which arrived in North America are presented and contrasted. It is supposed that the perspective which prevails in the United States regarding the importance of the natural world is evolving. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Manifest Destiny and the American Industrial Revolution exacted a steep cost from the nation 2 ̆ 7 s natural resources. Previously perceived as 2 ̆ 2 raw materials, 2 ̆ 2 today the unmanipulated environment is viewed in terms of its recreational, aesthetic, ecologic, and spiritual worth. This evolving perspective is demonstrated qualitativelythrough case studies featuring methods of sustainable agriculture, by an ecological restoration project, and by grassroots eco-poltical activism. The changing perspective is quantified by measuring the growth of <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> 2 ̆ 7 s leading environmental organizations. It is hypothesized that those organizations have experienced significant growth over the study period, or from 1980 - 1994.

The prevailing perspective by the citizens of the United States is indeed evolving toward a view that is more sustainable since the missions of the nation 2 ̆ 7 s leading environmental organizations are endorsed by the financiers of those organizations Environmentalists, now more than ever, must remain encouraged and vigilant in order to increase the chances that the newly evolved perspective will become policy.
