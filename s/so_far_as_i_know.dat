His name who leads the armies of Heaven is [...] "Faithful and True"...and all deeds which are done in alliance with these armies ... are essentially deeds of faith, which therefore ... is at once the source and the substance of all known deed, rightly so called ... as set forth in the last word of the noblest group of words ever, <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> uttered by simple man concerning his practice, being the final testimony of the leaders of a great practical nation ...|$|E
500|$|Crane's poems, {{which he}} {{preferred}} to call [...] "lines", are typically not given as much scholarly attention as his fiction; no anthology contained Crane's verse until 1926. [...] Although it is not certain when Crane began to write poetry seriously, he once said that his overall poetic aim was [...] "to give my ideas {{of life as a}} whole, <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> it". [...] The poetic style used in both of his books of poetry, The Black Riders and Other Lines and War is Kind, was unconventional for the time in that it was written in free verse without rhyme, meter, or even titles for individual works. [...] They are typically short in length; although several poems, such as [...] "Do not weep, maiden, for war is kind", use stanzas and refrains, most do not. [...] Crane also differed from his peers and poets of later generations in that his work contains allegory, dialectic and narrative situations.|$|E

2500|$|Most German {{immigrants}} came to Wisconsin {{in search}} of inexpensive farmland. However, immigration began to change in character and size in the late 1840s and early 1850s, due to the 1848 revolutionary movements in Europe. After 1848, hopes for a united Germany had failed, and revolutionary and radical Germans, known as the [...] "Forty-Eighters", {{turned their attention to}} the United States. One of the most famous [...] "liberal revolutionaries" [...] of 1848 was Carl Schurz, who explained why he came to Milwaukee in 1854, [...] "It is true, similar things [...] were done in other cities where the Forty-eighters [...] had congregated. But <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> nowhere did their influence so quickly impress itself upon the whole social atmosphere as in 'German Athens of America' as Milwaukee was called at the time." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Cimiters" [...] are {{mentioned}} about ten {{times in the}} Book of Mormon as existing hundreds of years before the term [...] "scimitar" [...] was coined. The word [...] "cimiter" [...] is considered an anachronism since the word was never used by the Hebrews (from which the Book of Mormon peoples came) or any other civilization prior to 450 AD. is of oriental and uncertain origin and appears in various forms. How {{it came to be}} introduced into the speech and writings of the Nephites, and how not used in the other Hebrew literature at an earlier date, is <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> unaccountable. The earliest use of the word I have found is in Gibbon, where referring to the alleged incident of finding the sword of Mars for Attila, he there calls that sword of Mars 'cimiter'; but that was about 450 A.D."

2500|$|Gordon {{was tall}} and {{handsome}} (see portrait prefixed to The Laureate of the Centaurs). But he stooped and held himself badly, partly {{on account of his}} short sight. He was shy, sensitive and, even before he was overwhelmed with troubles, inclined to be moody. After his head was injured at Ballarat he was never the same man again, and subsequent accidents aggravated his condition. Any suggestion that drink was a contributing cause may be disregarded. Sir Frank Madden, who was with him the day before his death, said that he was then absolutely sober, [...] "he never cared for it [...] and <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> seldom took it at all". The Rev. Tenison Woods in his [...] "Personal Reminiscences" [...] said [...] "Those who did not know Gordon attributed his suicide to drink, but I repeat he was most temperate and disliked the company of drinking men".|$|E
