50|$|The {{coatings}} on metals tend to {{fall into}} two categories: thermoplastic or thermoset. A thermoplastic coating does not chemically react when the substrate undergoes drying after the coating process.

40|$|Multifunctional DLC {{coatings}} {{have been}} extensively studied and {{recognized as a}} promising solution to avoid wear and friction problems. However, {{the effect of the}} environment on the tribological behaviour, in particular in the refrigeration industry, is little studied yet. The present work aims to study the influence of refrigerant gases (HFC 134 a and R 600 a) on the tribological behaviour of multifunctional CrN-Si rich DLC coatings, in particular on the tribo-chemical reactions. Tribological behaviour was evaluated using constant and incremental load reciprocating sliding tests. The constant load tests were conducted to access the friction coefficient and wear rates of specimen and counter-bodies whereas the incremental load tests (increments of 2 N at 15 min. intervals) allowed the assessment of the <b>scuffing</b> <b>resistance</b> of the coatings. The <b>scuffing</b> <b>resistance</b> was defined as the work (N. m) at which the value of the friction coefficient first rose above 0. 20 (lubricity effect). The characterization of wear scars (tribolayers) was performed by optical interferometry, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry associated with scanning electron microscopy, and micro Raman spectroscopy. It was verified a strong influence of the atmosphere via the formation of a tribolayer at the interface between body and counter body. This influence resulted in some disturbance of friction coefficient and contact resistance values. Tests performed in R 600 a atmosphere presented lower (36 %) friction coefficient and lower (40 %) <b>scuffing</b> <b>resistance</b> (surface durability) than those performed in HFC 134 a refrigerant gas. The observed differences were justified in terms of the tribo-chemical reaction between the multifunctional coating, the counter body and the refrigerant gases. Both results presented traces of Oxygen, but in the tests with HFC 134 a gas it was observed the presence of Fluorinated compounds in the tribo-layer. In the tests performed with R 600 a gas atmosphere it was found only Carbon and Silicon, indicating different interactions of the environment. It is worth noting that these results can serve as a guide to the application: the low friction induced by the presence of R 600 a recommend it for applications where sustainability and energy saving are required while the use of HFC 134 a is recommended for applications requiring increased reliability (longer life) ...|$|E
5000|$|Piston {{rings are}} subject to wear as they {{move up and down}} the {{cylinder}} bore due to their own inherent load and due to the gas load acting on the ring.

Newer modern motorcycle manufacturers have many single function but serrated ports to retain the ring. Typically, top ring and oil control rings will be coated with chromium, or Nitrided, possibly plasma sprayed [...] or have a PVD (physical vapour deposition) ceramic coating.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{purpose of}} the work described in this thesis was to develop an insight into the scuffing performance of steel discs used to simulate gear tooth contacts under severe conditions of load, sliding and high temperature. Different surface conditions of the discs such as ground, superfinished, ground/hard-coated, and superfinished/ hard-coated were investigated in various combinations and at sliding speeds of up to 16 m/s {{in order to obtain}} an understanding of the possible beneficial effect of improved surface finish and the application of hard coatings on scuffing performance under the severe conditions experienced in an aerospace transmission such as a helicopter main rotor gearbox. The lubricant used in all tests was an oil commonly used in aerospace transmissions. It was found that the diamond-like coating (DLC) investigated in this work had the effect of markedly improving the <b>scuffing</b> <b>resistance</b> of the hardened steel substrate. In tests using the ground/coated samples, for example, it was not found possible to produce scuffing within the load and temperature limits of the test rig used (2. 0 GPa maximum Hertzian contact pressure or 300 C maximum disc bulk temperature) even at the high sliding speed of 16 m/s. In addition to improving <b>scuffing</b> <b>resistance</b> {{it was found that the}} effect of the hard coating was to reduce friction and operating temperatures for a given load/speed combination. Superfinishing of the steel discs also led to a reduction in friction, but did not produce a significant improvement in <b>scuffing</b> <b>resistance.</b> It was found that the combination of ground/hard-coated discs running against ground/uncoated discs produced a remarkable behaviour of the discs' bulk temperatures, which suggests that the hard coating acts as a thermal barrier. Micro-elastohydrodynamic lubrication (micro-EHL) analyses were conducted using surface profiles of discs used in the experimental work. These theoretical simulations demonstrated the very severe lubrication conditions which are present in the experiments. Pressure ripples far in excess of the calculated Hertzian pressure are predicted, and the films generated by hydrodynamic action are extremely thin.

With the failure time as a criterion, the rank order is as follows: NCM/Fe > CKS/Fe. Before the scoring occurs at the interface of the piston ring and cylinder liner (PRCL), the cast iron liner enters into a “polish wear” stage, and iron-based adhesive materials begin to form on the piston ring surface.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to provide}} a better {{understanding}} of the influence of various parameters on surface distress in gears. The types of gears of concern in this study are the ones found in gas turbine engines and helicopter gearboxes where tooth contacts are particularly heavily loaded. The work is concerned with the influence of surface roughness, gear material and hard coatings and their effect in reducing the occurrence of scuffing, which is a form of surface distress that can occur under severe conditions of sliding and high temperature. An extensive experimental programme has been carried out using a two-disc machine developed to simulate gas turbine gearing and micro-elastohydrodynamic lubrication (micro-EHL) contacts under realistic conditions of load, speed, surface finish and temperature. The project involved a large number of disc tests with the aim of quantifying the effects of: a significant improvement in surface finish the use of a different gear material and surface hardening and the use of different hard coatings on the resistance to scuffing. This work was conducted using an existing disc machine to extend the work carried out by Patching (1994) who used a single material. The scuffing performance of axially ground (roughness average, Ra = 0. 4 urn) case-carburised steel discs was used as a benchmark against which the performance of alternative materials/surfaces could be measured. Different materials and surface conditions were investigated as follows. The ground discs were superfinished to better than Ra = 0. 1 um using a proprietary polishing method. A nitriding steel was used. Two different super-hard coatings were investigated. The main conclusions to be drawn from the work are: the <b>scuffing</b> <b>resistance</b> of nitrided surfaces is superior to case-carburised surfaces, but it is essential to remove the compound layer ('white layer') to achieve durability at high sliding speeds. The benefits of superfmishing are clearly demonstrated better finish improves the scuffing performance and also gives lower friction and bulk temperatures during operation. Hard coatings show promise, and the triple combination of nitriding, superfmishing and hard coatings gave particularly impressive <b>scuffing</b> <b>resistance</b> in this investigation. A micro-EHL solver was used to simulate the conditions of the various tests. The solver, which was developed at Cardiff by Professor H P Evans and his associates, can be used to simulate the lubrication of rough surfaces in contact under realistic thin film conditions in which there is significant asperity interaction including momentary 'dry' contact. Surface profiles acquired from the discs used in the tests were used as input to the solver. Using the solver a number of objective performance parameters were obtained including high pressure cycling and occurrences of thin or zero film within the nominal contact between the discs. The results of the simulations confirmed the distinct advantages of using smoother surfaces and contributed to an understanding of the way in which hard coatings can lead to surface improvement. In addition to work on scuffing the project included the design and manufacture of a test rig, complete with data acquisition and control system, for research on contact fatigue and micropitting in particular...|$|E
40|$|Compacted {{graphite}} iron (CGI) is a cast iron material that has gained much attention {{due to its}} attractive material properties which are intermediate between those of grey and ductile cast iron. In the automotive industry compacted {{graphite iron}} has become an interesting alternative material to grey cast iron in components like cylinder blocks or cylinder heads. The reason for this interest is the higher strength found in CGI. However, one disadvantage is the lower thermal conductivity of CGI compared to grey cast iron. The aim of the present work is to investigate how chemical composition and cooling rate affects the microstructure in compacted graphite iron and trying to relate the microstructure to the thermal conductivity. The effect of an austempering heat treatment process on some material properties in CGI, grey and ductile cast iron is also investigated. The austempering heat treatment was shown {{to have a significant}} influence on many of the material properties investigated. The hardness was increased, while the thermal conductivity was reduced, for all three graphite morphologies observed. <b>Scuffing</b> <b>resistance</b> increased considerably for the austempered grey iron but was slightly reduced for the other two austempered morphologies. The ultimate tensile strength in bending was reduced in the austempered grey iron and CGI samples but slightly increased in the ductile iron sample. It was confirmed that alloying elements like magnesium increased nodularity, while copper and tin promoted formation of pearlite in CGI. Silicon had a ferrite promoting effect as well as an inoculating effect and chromium and molybdenum promoted formation of carbides. The thermal conductivity was highly affected by the fraction of ferrite as well as nodularity and addition of carbon and silicon.

40|$|This thesis aims at {{increased}} knowledge in two fields of tribological research; both related to making currently used combustion engines greener. The first field regards {{the possibilities of}} using a boric acid fuel additive to increase fuel efficiency. The second field is about the severe wear phenomenon scuffing, which can become problematic when cargo ships are operated on low-sulphur fuel to reduce sulphuric emissions. Tribological tests were developed and performed to simulate the applications. Advanced surface analysis was performed to understand changes occurring on the outermost surface of sliding components, which affect friction and wear. Samples from engines were studied to verify {{the relation between the}} lab tests and the applications. In the case of boric acid, the coefficient of friction was below 0. 02 for large parts of the tests, but varied with test parameters. The corresponding reduction in friction was up to 78 % compared with tests without the additive. As an attempt to assess if the substantial fuel savings found in field tests with passenger cars (6 %) can be explained by friction reduction in boundary and mixed lubricated parts of the piston assembly, assumptions were presented that would lead to fuel savings close to these 6 %. Boric acid was detected on surfaces after the tests, and the tribofilm appearance depended on test parameters. The tribofilms were shown to be affected by storage time and test temperature; a finding that is vital for future studies. In the case of scuffing, mechanisms were studied and accumulation of wear debris had a significant role on scuffing initiation in the lab scale scuffing tests. Regarding the possibility to test materials <b>scuffing</b> <b>resistance,</b> there was a large scatter in the results, and thereby difficult to draw conclusions. Two new piston ring materials were identified to perform somewhat better than the currently used. In conclusion, findings that could facilitate immediate improvement of fuel efficiency of today’s combustion engine vehicles as well as findings that strengthen available hypotheses on scuffing mechanisms are presented. The latter offers improved understanding of scuffing and thereby give possibilities to counteract the higher risk associated with operation on cleaner fuel...|$|E
40|$|Operating {{conditions}} such as load and speed of compressors are getting more aggressive to improve efficiency. Also, protection from beneficial surface layers, such as ferrous chlorides, on the critical interfaces is compromised as the refrigerants industry is moving from traditional (CFC/HFC) to environmentally friendly refrigerants. Thus, {{there is a need}} to have a closer look at the critical tribo-contacts and devise ways to make them more robust and wear-resistant. In this work, first of its kind studies were done to evaluate the possibility of using surface texturing for realistic gray cast iron compressor surfaces. Three types of micro-dimple patterns (40 ??m diameter and 10 ??m depth, 60 ??m diameter and 7. 5 ??m depth, 60 ??m diameter and 4 ??m depth) with two area densities of 5 % and 20 % were created on the pin surfaces by the method of laser surface texturing. The results of the controlled tribological experiments with the texture patterns were compared against untextured surfaces under starved lubrication conditions. Under identical conditions of load, the untextured pins failed while all the textured pins operated successfully. In addition, the textured pins survived the entire duration of three hours in durability type studies highlighting their long term usefulness. Selected tests were also done at different sliding speeds, lubricant types and refrigerants and the usefulness of surface texturing at aggressive conditions was realized. For the wear and durability experiments, the beneficial effect of the micro-dimples could be attributed to the lubricant storage ability. A trade-off between the effect of the material pile-ups or bulges around the micro-dimples and the lubricant storage volume of the micro-dimples determined the difference in performance between the texture patterns. In addition, step loading scuffing experiments were done using the texture patterns and the <b>scuffing</b> <b>resistance</b> was found to primarily depend on the lubricant storage ability of the micro-dimples. Even though surface texturing was found to have a positive effect, such behavior needs to be evaluated under specific lubricants and refrigerants, to fully understand the complex phenomena driving the improved performance. Overall, the research work done in this thesis developed new information about the application of surface texturing for air-conditioning and refrigeration compressor applications. It was demonstrated successfully that texturing could be applied to compressor surfaces operating under realistic {{conditions such}} as starved lubrication and provide significant tribological benefits...|$|E
40|$|In general, the {{potential}} of current conventional high-temperature materials has been exploited to a large extent. The industries are therefore looking forward to development of alternative materials for their industrials application, which would be lighter, stronger and having improved higher temperature potential compared to the presently available alloys. Among the various high temperature materials for the future, intermetallics-base alloys are prime candidates for alternative materials. In this thesis work, Ni 3 Al- and MoSi 2 -based materials were specially investigated for their industrial. On Ni 3 Al-based materials Attractive engineering properties of Ni 3 Al alloys is their increasing yield strength with increasing temperature up to about 650 - 750 ºC. This type of strength behaviour suggested that the Ni 3 Al-based intermetallic alloys may have good wear properties in the peak-strength temperature range. Consequently, investigations of their sliding friction and wear were initiated. In fact, a number of laboratory {{studies have indicated that}} Ni 3 Al-based alloys have significant potential in wear-critical applications, especially in cavitations erosion and in sliding wear at the temperature range between 400 ºC and 650 ºC. In this work, an existed Ni 3 Al-based alloy 77. 7 Ni- 9. 8 Al- 11. 5 Fe- 0. 5 Mn- 0. 5 Ti- 0. 1 B in weight percentages and its composite reinforced by 6 vol. % Cr 3 C 2 -particles were studied and related to their microstructures. Hot isostatic pressing and casting were applied for preparing the materials. Wear rate of the test materials under different loads and their <b>scuffing</b> <b>resistance</b> were measured by Pin-on-Disk method. SEM, EDS, XRD, and EBSD techniques were used to observe the microstructures and identify the phase constitutions of the tested materials. The tribological performance related to the analytical results revealed that the single phase Ni 3 Al-based alloy showed a better wear-resistance compared to duplex microstructure. And the investigation also indicated that the hard Cr-carbide played a positive role on tribological intermetallics reducing the wear-rate. On MoSi 2 -based materials MoSi 2 is presently considered {{as one of the most}} promising due to its high melting point (2030 ºC) and excellent elevated-temperature oxidation resistance. However, like most of other intermetallics, the major problem, which has impeded their use, as high temperature materials, is their poor ductility and toughness during brittle-to-ductile transition temperature, BDTT, and low strength level above at temperature. In other words, their low temperature strength is limited by brittle fracture while the high temperature strength is governed by plastic flow. From the earlier investigations it was clear that the addition of alloying elements could not make the monolithic MoSi 2 compound having the right combination of ambient temperature toughness and high temperature strengthen. For the most demand depends on the development of engineered composite materials. In this work, the attention was mostly focused on ZrO 2 -particles reinforced MoSi 2 -matrix composites. The working results indicated (1) a PLS process could be a practical and economical method for producing MoSi 2 -ZrO 2 composites; (2) ZrO 2 -particles of less than 1 μm usually generated the better sintered density, RT-hardness and toughness than of the composites compared with the bigger particles; (3) the composites containing 15 – 25 vol. % unstable zironia (USZ) showed a better toughening effect, compared to the composites having less or more particles; and (4) A deteriorated oxidation resistance of MoSi 2 -ZrO 2 composite compared to its monolithic counterpart is due to the formation of the porous oxide layer of ZrSiO 4 +SiO 2 mixture and a retarded Si diffusion by the inner oxidation and reaction between SiO 2 and ZrSiO 4. Therefore, an alloying addition for further forming a protective oxide layer is necessary on developing this type of composites.
