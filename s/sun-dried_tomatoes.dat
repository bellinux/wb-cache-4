40|$|Tomato, {{sweet pepper}} and okra are {{vegetables}} which are grown and consumed daily by all classes {{of the population}} in Western Africa generally and Nigeria specifically. These vegetables are consumed fresh during the season and dried during off-season. In this study some nutritional content of fresh and locally <b>sun-dried</b> samples of <b>tomato,</b> sweet pepper and okra were analyzed and changes evaluated. The nutritional contents analyzed are ascorbic acid, vitamin A (β-carotene), calcium, potassium and sugar. The study shows that β-carotene retention in sun-dried vegetables were quite lower in all the vegetables studied, with tomato recording the highest percentage loss of 80 %, sweet pepper 65 % and 50 % for okra. The traditional method of sun drying which does not involve blanching and sulphiting causes ascorbic acid loss in all analyzed vegetables ranging from 46. 5 % in okra, 69. 67 % in sweet pepper with tomato recording the highest difference of 74 %. Calcium and potassium changes were low, while sugar concentrations in sun-dried vegetables were high. This shows that adult’s intake of carotene and ascorbic acid from dried tomato, pepper and okra, which are used in most Nigerian diet at non-production seasons will be inadequate after cooking compared to recommended daily allowances...|$|R
40|$|What {{better than}} a lively debate to stimulate ideas on The Role of Information and Communication in the Development of Small and Medium Agri-food Processing Units in Africa ? Between 20 and 24 February 2006, almost 100 {{participants}} half of them women from around 30 countries exchanged views on the subject in Cotonou, Benin. A number of observations emerged from this seminar, which was organised by CTA: the poor use of certain new tools, notably the internet and management software, the relevance of collective action in commercial strategies {{and the need for}} better communication about products in other words, better packaging to achieve better sales. Thanks to ICTs, small agri-food processing enterprises now have better access to information on markets, business opportunities, regulations, manufacturing processes and equipment. But the cost of both materials and their maintenance is often too high for small-scale operators, and operating ICTs often requires considerable training. A number of products presented at stands placed outside the conference room caught the eye of participants. In Côte d'Ivoire, Mrs A Cécile Kouassi has developed and patented a method for stabilising and reconstituting fresh attiéké (cassava semolina) that is now being used to provide revenue for about a thousand rural women working in cooperatives. In Kenya, Palm House Dairies, which supports 350 rural households, has made a selling point from its simple but striking packaging, stamped with the company logo (a cow under a tree). Antoinette Magaral, president of ATOSA, an agri-food processing association in Chad, exhibited <b>sun-dried</b> meat, <b>tomatoes</b> and peppers, packaged in small sachets. The products were well received by guests at the seminar. ATOSA is trying to persuade hotel and restaurant owners in the country s capital to put more specialties from Chad on their menus. This type of direct contact with clients, together with word of mouth and tasting sessions, are key elements when it comes to selling food products, and are {{part and parcel of the}} communication strategies so crucial to successful small and medium agri-food processing operations.

50|$|<b>Sun-dried</b> <b>{{tomatoes}}</b> are ripe tomatoes that lose most {{of their}} water content after spending a majority of their drying time in the sun. These tomatoes are usually pre-treated with sulfur dioxide or salt before being placed in the sun {{in order to improve}} quality. Typically, tomatoes spend 4-10 days in the sun in order for the sun-drying process to be complete. Cherry types of tomatoes will lose 88% of their initial (fresh) weight, while larger tomatoes can lose up to 93% during the process. As a result, it takes anywhere from 8 to 14 kilograms of fresh tomatoes to make a single kilogram of <b>sun-dried</b> <b>tomatoes.</b>|$|E

50|$|Tomatoes were {{originally}} {{salted and dried}} to preserve the fruit. Salting and evaporating the moisture out of tomatoes (as with most foods) significantly delays the process of decomposition. By drying ripe tomatoes, these foods could be enjoyed and provide valuable nutrition in the winter when it is difficult or impossible to grow fresh produce. The true origin of <b>sun-dried</b> <b>tomatoes</b> is unclear, but {{it is known that}} the Aztecs began salting and sun-drying their tomatoes in order to preserve their freshness around the year 700 AD. Italians originally dried their tomatoes on their ceramic roof-tops in the summer sun. <b>Sun-dried</b> <b>tomatoes</b> surged in popularity in the United States in the late 1980s to early 1990s, where they were often found in pasta dishes and salads, becoming a trend before losing popularity from overuse {{by the end of the}} 1990s.|$|E

After four days additional ingredients are added and stirred, and again after another four days. On the ninth day, Herman is divided into equal parts (four or five) and all but one of these parts are passed along to friends. The last part is kept and on the tenth day is cooked. Many ingredients can be added to Herman before the procedure of cooking the Herman cake. These ingredients can vary from eggs, cinnamon, apples, chocolate, and cherries to make Herman sweet or olives and <b>sun-dried</b> <b>tomatoes</b> for a savoury taste.|$|E
5000|$|At work, Daniel asked Betty {{to pick up}} a new {{wheelchair}} that {{he wanted}} to use at the event. Afterward, she met a new canteen guy named Giovanni, whom she found both intriguing and annoying. After she complained about not having enough <b>sun-dried</b> <b>tomatoes</b> on her sandwiches to Daniel, Betty discovered that Gio was fired and Gio blamed [...] "MODE Girl" [...] Betty for it, causing him to reveal what he really put in his sandwiches to everyone in the 28th floor. Feeling a sense of guilt, Betty caught up with Gio and apologized for what happened. As she saw Gio's van, she asked him if he could take her to New Jersey to pick up the new wheelchair Daniel needed.

5000|$|Popular in the 1950s as {{a comfort}} food, the grilled cheese {{sandwich}} {{has made a}} comeback in various incarnations in the 1990s and 2000s. It was estimated in 2001 that Americans consume around 2.2 billion grilled cheese sandwiches yearly, and chefs have experimented with different types of bread and cheese in updates of the classic cheese dream of yore. Pumpernickel, dark brown, and rye breads have been used, topped with Swiss cheese, Gouda, and havarti respectively. Other options include apples with mozzarella, peaches with edam, and pear with gorgonzola or brie; Italian herbs, <b>sun-dried</b> <b>tomatoes</b> and mozzarella; or turkey and ham, with which [...] "a variation on a Monte Cristo" [...] can also be created. Scott Fletcher of the Grafton Village Cheese Company makes cheese dreams with rustic country bread, sharp Cheddar cheese, white pepper, eggs, milk, unsalted butter, and maple syrup. The open faced sandwiches make an appearance in Luanne Rice's novel Stone Heart.|$|E
5000|$|What Tunisians {{refer to}} as a [...] "tajine" [...] is very {{different}} from the Moroccan dish. Tunisian tajine is more like an Italian frittata or an eggah. First, a simple ragout is prepared, of meat cut into very small pieces, cooked with onions and spices, such as a blend of dried rosebuds and ground cinnamon known as baharat or a robust combination of ground coriander and caraway seeds; this is called tabil. Then something starchy is added to thicken the juices. Common thickeners include cannellini beans, chickpeas, breadcrumbs or cubed potatoes. When the meat is tender, it is combined with the ingredients which have been chosen to be the dominant flavouring. Examples include fresh parsley, dried mint, saffron, <b>sun-dried</b> <b>tomatoes,</b> cooked vegetables and stewed calves' brains. Next, the stew is enriched with cheese and eggs. Finally, this egg and stew is baked in a deep pie dish, either on the stove or in the oven until top and bottom are crisply cooked and the eggs are just set. When the tajine is ready, it is turned out onto a plate and sliced into squares, accompanied by wedges of lemon. Tunisian tajines can also be made with seafood or as a completely vegetarian dish.|$|E
40|$|Low-temperature {{geothermal}} waters {{can be used}} efficiently in drying various {{vegetables and}} fruits, replacing sun-drying or drying using conventional fuels. A geothermal tomato dehydration plant has been operating since 2001 in Neo Erasmio, northern Greece, producing high-quality, <b>sun-dried</b> <b>tomatoes.</b> The unit uses low-cost geothermal water to heat atmospheric air to 56 - 58 degrees C, which is introduced in a specially designed tunnel-type dryer. The scope of this work is to model the aforementioned tomato-drying process that uses low-enthalpy geothermal energy. The modelling procedure consists of two stages: the first stage focuses on the modelling of a single tomato piece, whereas the second stage {{is concerned with the}} modelling of air drying of tomatoes in a tunnel with trays moving in batches. The influence of air velocity, air temperature, and tomato tray loading on the drying process was investigated. The effect of flow configuration, i. e., co-current or counter-current operation, on the drying characteristics was also explored. The model can be used for the design and optimization of the continuous drying process existing in Neo Erasmio and can be easily extended and modified to deal with other agricultural products and tunnel designs...|$|E
