30|$|Silva-Filho et al. [13] {{presented}} a heuristic for two-level caches, known as TECH. Preliminary results {{have demonstrated that}} {{the order in which}} cache parameters are explored affects the number of states that should be visited to find the best configuration for a given application. The heuristic is focused on energy consumption. Basically, the TECH heuristic is similar to TCaT, but it adopts a reverse exploration order and a different exploration environment based on the Architecture Description Language known as ArchC. TECH explores the <b>second</b> <b>level</b> of the cache hierarchy before the <b>first</b> <b>level.</b> In TECH heuristic, all cache parameters are set initially to be minimal, with the exception of <b>second</b> <b>level</b> cache size, that is set to be maximal. The exploration of parameters follows the same logic of TCaT heuristic, but the sequence of exploration of parameters starts tuning cache size of <b>second</b> <b>level,</b> followed by <b>first</b> <b>level.</b> After that, the exploration is done for line size of <b>second</b> <b>level</b> and then <b>first</b> <b>level.</b> At last, the heuristic is concluded exploring associativity of <b>second</b> <b>level,</b> followed by the <b>first</b> <b>level.</b> Through simulations it was observed that to define the cache size of the <b>second</b> <b>level,</b> initially, we need to limit increases in the <b>first</b> cache <b>level.</b> Preliminary experiments show an approximately 4 -fold reduction in energy consumption when compared with TCaT heuristics.|$|R
