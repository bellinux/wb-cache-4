5|$|Desert <b>Strike</b> was {{followed}} by four sequels Jungle <b>Strike,</b> Urban <b>Strike,</b> Soviet <b>Strike,</b> and Nuclear <b>Strike</b> that expanded on the basic gameplay it established. The design staff made efforts to retain game mechanics they felt embodied {{the core of the}} original. They believed removing those elements would result in a loss of focus of what attracted fans. As the series moved to more advanced consoles, Posehn became less involved in the programming side of development. Jungle <b>Strike</b> and Urban <b>Strike,</b> both released for the Genesis, featured additional vehicles and locations. Soviet <b>Strike,</b> released for the original PlayStation and the Sega Saturn in 1996, featured 3D graphics, as did Nuclear <b>Strike,</b> released on PC and PlayStation in 1997 and the Nintendo 64 in 1999. A fifth sequel provisionally titled Future <b>Strike</b> was planned, but the game was eventually released as , a mech-based shooter game.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>strike,</b> despite {{considerable}} tensions, {{the city}} of Philadelphia remained mostly calm {{and there were no}} major outbreaks of violence. All of the city's newspapers editorialized against the <b>strike</b> and the public was, by and large, opposed to the <b>strike</b> as well. Several of the <b>strike</b> leaders, including James McMenamin and Frank Carney, were arrested for violating the anti-strike act. The NAACP played an active role both in pressuring the PTC and the federal government to institute fair hiring practices at the PTC for several years before the <b>strike,</b> and in maintaining the calm during the <b>strike</b> itself.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to Combat <b>Strikes,</b> there are special Stealth <b>Strikes,</b> Situation-Specific <b>Strikes</b> and Boss-Specific <b>Strikes</b> which become available at certain {{points in the}} game.

50|$|Because {{the number}} of <b>strikes</b> on the hour is {{determined}} by the position of the snail which rotates in tandem with the hour hand, rack <b>striking</b> seldom becomes desynchronized. Rack <b>striking</b> also made possible the repeating clock, which can be made to repeat the last hour struck by pressing a button. Rack <b>striking</b> became the standard mechanism used in <b>striking</b> clocks down to the present.|$|R

Eventually, two factions emerged; one group of workers desired to return to work while another wished to continue the <b>strike.</b> Violent riots broke out when striking workers prevented the others from returning to work. The riots began to assume communal colours as the workers who wished to continue the <b>strike</b> were mostly caste Hindus while those who desired to end it were largely untouchables or Dalits.|$|E

With {{the success of the}} original title, producer Scott Berfield, game director John Manley and associate producer Tony Barnes were tasked with creating the sequel. Jungle <b>Strike</b> retained the core mechanics of its predecessor, with the addition of various vehicles and settings.

It {{caught the attention of}} a number of African townsmen, leading to the creation of trade unions and African nationalist politics, and is seen as the birth of African nationalism.|$|E

A reaction to the agricultural <b>strikes</b> within California was met received by the law enforcement as well as the press who took the side of the growers. Even though the initial group of agricultural <b>strikes</b> in April 1933 seemed to be successful, the growers began to recruit labor despite of the <b>strikes,</b> therefore the influence of power the strikers had begun to diminish.|$|R

5|$|The RAF had {{initially}} planned on a buy of 150 trainers; however, {{with both the}} BAC TSR-2 tactical <b>strike</b> aircraft and Hawker Siddeley P.1154 supersonic V/STOL fighter cancelled, the RAF were looking increasingly hard at their future light <b>strike</b> needs and realizing that they now needed more than just advanced trainers with some secondary counter insurgency capability. The RAF's <b>strike</b> line-up {{was at this point}} intended to consist of American General Dynamics F-111s plus the AFVG for lighter <b>strike</b> purposes. There was concern that both F-111 and AFVG were high risk projects and with the French already planning on a <b>strike</b> role for the Jaguar, there was an opportunity to introduce a serious backup plan for the RAF's future <b>strike</b> needs – the Jaguar. As a result, by October1970, the RAF's requirements had changed to 165 single-seat <b>strike</b> aircraft and 35 trainers.|$|E
