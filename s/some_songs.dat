5|$|Gutawa {{followed}} Harmony Cinta in August 2010 {{with a third}} album, the Islamic religious album Balada Shalawat (Ballads for Salah). During recording, Gutawa received coaching from an Islamic scholar, or ustad, {{regarding the}} correct pronunciation of Arabic lyrics used in <b>some</b> <b>songs.</b> The album was launched during Ramadhan, with profits donated to Indonesia's poor.|$|E

5|$|The {{manuscript}} {{as currently}} bound (the date accompanying the binding {{information on the}} inside rear cover is stamped Dec. 6, 1944) has <b>some</b> <b>songs</b> out of sequence (nos. 331-340), surrounded by no. 311 and 312.|$|E
5|$|When Bolognesi was re-writing the screenplay, Bodanzky {{suggested}} that he listen to Arnaldo Antunes' music. According to the writer, he found <b>some</b> <b>songs</b> {{that seemed to be}} composed for the film. He then wrote some scenes and characters to fit the compositions and integrate them into the narrative.|$|E
5|$|Coronel was {{replaced}} by session musician Ron Leejack, and the group continued their efforts to finish the album. <b>Some</b> <b>songs</b> were completely re-recorded to accommodate Leejack's different playing style. The entire recording process, which followed a haphazard schedule, took nearly a year to complete. When the completed album was presented to Don Ellis, Epic's A director, he stated that he hated the album and {{was not going to}} release it. The next day, Wicked Lester manager Lew Linet requested and received the group's release from Epic Records.|$|E

5|$|After {{recording}} drums, {{bass and}} most of the guitars, the band, Giordano and Parker moved to Water Music in Hoboken, New Jersey. The rest of the guitars and the vocals, strings and cowbells were recorded there, and recording was complete by April. Giordano, Parker and Ted Young mixed the recordings, and Ted Jensen did the mastering; Mike Sapone contributed programming to the songs. Girl Next Door String Quartet provided the strings, arranged by conductor Ray Zu-Artez (who played piano). Neil Rubenstein of These Enzymes and Nick Torres of Northstar contributed vocals to <b>some</b> <b>songs.</b> In retrospect, Fred Mascherino considered the sessions rushed.|$|E
5|$|All of Chopin's {{compositions}} {{include the}} piano. Most are for solo piano, though {{he also wrote}} two piano concertos, a few chamber pieces, and <b>some</b> <b>songs</b> to Polish lyrics. His keyboard style is highly individual and often technically demanding; his own performances were noted for their nuance and sensitivity. Chopin invented {{the concept of the}} instrumental ballade. His major piano works also include mazurkas, waltzes, nocturnes, polonaises, études, impromptus, scherzos, preludes and sonatas, some published only after his death. Influences on his composition style include Polish folk music, the classical tradition of J. S. Bach, Mozart and Schubert, as well as the Paris salons where he was a frequent guest. His innovations in style, musical form, and harmony, and his association of music with nationalism, were influential throughout and after the late Romantic period.|$|E
5|$|Allen Lanier, Joe Bouchard and Donald Roeser contributed {{instrumental}} {{parts and}} backing vocals to the tracks as guests. These remain Lanier's and J. Bouchard's only contributions to Imaginos. Columbia Records' complaints about Albert Bouchard's lead vocals pushed him to finance multiple recordings with try-outs of singers, including Jon Rogers and Joey Cerisano, whose performances on <b>some</b> <b>songs</b> {{were used for}} the final mix of the album in 1988. The new recordings, overdubs by other uncredited musicians, and mixing lasted until 1984. Musicians involved in this second phase of recording included future BÖC keyboard player Tommy Zvoncheck, who had already played with Clarence Clemons, Public Image Ltd and The Dream Syndicate.|$|E
50|$|Chutney music, chutney soca, chutney parang, baithak gana, folk music, {{classical}} music, <b>some</b> Hindu religious <b>songs,</b> <b>some</b> Muslim religious <b>songs,</b> and <b>some</b> Christian religious <b>songs</b> are sung in Caribbean Hindustani, sometimes being {{mix with}} English in the Anglophone Caribbean or Dutch in Suriname and the Dutch Caribbean.|$|R
50|$|This {{album was}} the only Aerosmith album to receive the Parental Advisory sticker, {{primarily}} due to lead singer Steven Tyler shouting profanities in between <b>songs</b> and modifying <b>some</b> <b>song</b> lyrics to racier ones, although <b>some</b> other <b>song</b> lyrics had profanity in their original studio versions as well (even their next studio album, Just Push Play, contained profanity).|$|R

5|$|Black Beauty was {{recorded}} on April 10, 1970, at the Fillmore West in San Francisco, when Davis performed as the opening act for the Grateful Dead. It was also {{soon after his}} studio album Bitches Brew had been released to stores, and he played <b>some</b> <b>songs</b> from the album while leading an ensemble that featured soprano saxophonist Steve Grossman, bassist Dave Holland, keyboardist Chick Corea, drummer Jack DeJohnette, and percussionist Airto Moreira. After the departure of saxophonist Wayne Shorter from the group earlier that year, Grossman was enlisted by Davis {{to participate in an}} April 7 recording session for his next album Jack Johnson (1971) before joining the live band.|$|E
5|$|Cannibal is {{the debut}} {{extended}} play (EP) by American recording artist Kesha, released on November 19, 2010. The EP is a follow-up companion to her debut album, Animal. Originally, the record {{was thought to}} be released as a deluxe edition of Animal, but was instead sold and released as both an EP and a deluxe edition of Animal. Kesha worked with a variety of producers and writers such as executive producer Dr. Luke, Benny Blanco, Ammo, Max Martin, Bangladesh and others. Musically, the songs on Cannibal are of the dance-pop genre, with <b>some</b> <b>songs</b> incorporating elements of electro and electropop in their production and beats. Throughout the album, the use of Auto-Tune and vocoders is prominent. Lyrically, the songs on Cannibal speak of ignoring judgement or hate and experiences based on love and heartbreak.|$|E
5|$|Erotica is {{the fifth}} studio album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Madonna. It was released on October 20, 1992, by Maverick Records. The album was released simultaneously with Madonna's first book publication, Sex, a coffee table book containing explicit photographs featuring the singer. It marked Madonna's first release under her own multimedia entertainment company, Maverick. Erotica is a concept album about sex and romance, incorporating her alter ego named Mistress Dita, inspired by actress Dita Parlo. <b>Some</b> <b>songs</b> also take on a more confessional tone, influenced {{by the loss of}} Madonna's two close friends to AIDS.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Some</b> <b>song</b> adaptions seek {{inspiration}} from specific '80s songs, for instance Sugar was reworked with a backing track very reminiscent of [...] "Never Gonna Give You Up" [...] by Rick Astley.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are also}} 7 Cycles of <b>Songs,</b> <b>some</b> single <b>songs</b> for voice and piano and about 30 a cappella choir pieces ...|$|R

5|$|In 2011, Townshend and {{longtime}} Who engineer Bob Pridden remixed the album, {{resulting in a}} deluxe 5-disc box set. Unlike earlier reissues, this set contains two discs of demos, including <b>some</b> <b>songs</b> that were dropped from the final running order of the album, and a selection of songs in 5.1 surround sound. The box set came with a 100-page book including an essay by Townshend about the album sessions, with photos. In 2014, the album was released on Blu-ray Audio featuring a brand-new remix of the entire album by Townshend and Pridden in 5.1 surround sound as well the 2011 Deluxe Edition stereo remix and the original 1973 stereo LP mix.|$|E
5|$|Lux Radio Theatre (CBS, June 1940). Introduced and {{produced}} by Cecil B. DeMille, it featured Irene Dunne, Allan Jones, and Charles Winninger, {{all of whom}} were in the 1936 film version. In this condensed version <b>some</b> <b>songs</b> from the show were sung, but Julie was played by a non-singing Gloria Holden. This version made the biracial Julie a single woman. Only a few lines of Ol' Man River were heard, sung by a chorus. While supposedly based on the 1936 film, this production used the ending of the original show, which the film did not use.|$|E
5|$|Moakes has {{indicated}} that there was no worry about whether a song could be recreated live in concert {{in the same way as}} it would appear on record. A brass section and a chamber choir were hired as additional musicians. Drum machines and distorted guitars were used more extensively than in Bloc Party's previous works to create a sense of manipulation to the basic rock palette. Drummer Matt Tong was initially sceptical of moulding songs with programmed drums, as opposed to using his physical output, but agreed to the idea when the band recorded some of the tracks in their entirety. On <b>some</b> <b>songs,</b> the guitars were disregarded and the band focused solely on the beat. Okereke's voice was often used as an instrument by being looped, vocoded, or run through effects pedals.|$|E
50|$|The {{title was}} {{inspired}} by the 1970s afro-rock band Demon Fuzz and Akita's use of a fuzz box as a pulse generator. <b>Some</b> <b>song</b> titles were inspired by Jon Appleton's Appleton Syntonic Menagerie LP.|$|R
50|$|Shapeless (lead=yes) is a remix album by Buck-Tick, {{released}} on August 24, 1994. All songs were remixed by European artists, and <b>some</b> <b>song</b> titles are translated into English. It reached number five on the Oricon chart.|$|R
5000|$|The flower-like ("foliated") rims {{found in}} {{official}} Jun began in <b>some</b> <b>Song</b> pieces, and echoed contemporary styles in metalwork and lacquer. [...] By the Yuan some shapes, such as vases and circular incense-burners, are given handles.|$|R
5|$|Ono {{released}} her first solo album, Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band, in 1970 as a companion piece to Lennon's better-known John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band. The two albums also had companion covers: Ono's featured {{a photo of}} her leaning on Lennon, and Lennon's a photo of him leaning on Ono. Her album included raw, harsh vocals, which bore a similarity with sounds in nature (especially those made by animals) and free jazz techniques used by wind and brass players. Performers included Ornette Coleman, other renowned free jazz performers, and Ringo Starr. <b>Some</b> <b>songs</b> on the album consisted of wordless vocalizations, in a style that would influence Meredith Monk and other musical artists who have used screams and vocal noise in lieu of words. The album reached No. 182 on the US charts.|$|E
5|$|Sony Music Entertainment and Columbia Records {{promoted}} Live at Roseland: Elements of 4 {{by holding}} screenings of the DVD. The album was also promoted by posting teasers and live performances of <b>some</b> <b>songs.</b> Seven music videos which {{were placed on}} the album were also released prior to its official release. The complete concert film premiered exclusively on Vevo on November 20, a day before the album was released. During the same day, Beyoncé held a screening of the DVD at The Paris Theater in New York City, which was attended by fans. Live at Roseland: Elements of 4 received positive response from music critics who praised Beyoncé's live performances during the 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé revue, the album's documentary style and the intimate footage from Beyoncé's personal life. The DVD was also included on several year-end lists of best DVDs of 2011.|$|E
5|$|Stringer did {{not expect}} the success of Glee Cast single releases, and {{estimated}} that four million copies would be sold by Christmas2009. He was unsure whether the high sales figures would help or hinder the release of Glee: The Music, Volume1, and as such, was eager for its release in order to gauge the physical and digital market response. The 17 tracks selected for the album were considered amongst the series' most popular, with Columbia and Fox aiming to attract casual buyers as well as Glee fans. Geoff Bywater, head of Fox's music department, anticipated considerable sales from impulse buyers in retail stores. Instrumental versions of <b>some</b> <b>songs</b> were included as bonus tracks, based on a trend of fans recreating the musical numbers in tribute to the show.|$|E
5000|$|The band is {{finishing}} recording {{the material that}} will comprise the next album, featuring many <b>songs</b> in Spanish. <b>Some</b> <b>song</b> titles include Lies, Groove, Vagabundo (Hobo), Tan Fugaz Como La Eternidad (As Fast As Eternity) and Surf ...|$|R
