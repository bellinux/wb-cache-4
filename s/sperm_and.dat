40|$|Sperms {{are highly}} {{specialized}} cells for delivering DNA from male to the ovum. Incredibly, wide degree {{of diversity in}} sperm morphology in their basic structures i. e. head, middle piece and tail is found across species. Differences in terms of overall size of the <b>sperm,</b> shape <b>and</b> number of <b>sperm</b> produced are also incredible.

5|$|Blue {{whales are}} not easy to catch or kill. Their speed and power meant that they were rarely pursued by early whalers, who instead {{targeted}} <b>sperm</b> <b>and</b> right whales. In 1864, the Norwegian Svend Foyn equipped a steamboat with harpoons specifically designed for catching large whales. The harpoon gun was initially cumbersome and had a low success rate, but Foyn perfected it, and soon several whaling stations were established on the coast of Finnmark in northern Norway. Because of disputes with the local fishermen, the last whaling station in Finnmark was closed down in 1904.|$|E

40|$|While both <b>sperm</b> number <b>and</b> quality are now {{recognized}} {{to be important}} in determining the outcome of sperm competition, very few studies have experimentally assessed the influence of these two parameters simultaneously.

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{prediction that}} fast sperm {{should be more}} effective at fertilizing eggs has never been documented empirically. Interspecific comparisons suggest an inverse relationship between <b>sperm</b> velocity <b>and</b> <b>sperm</b> longevity but this trade-off has never been demonstrated within a species. Here I investigate how <b>sperm</b> velocity <b>and</b> <b>sperm</b> longevity influence the patterns of fertilization in the sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus. In the laboratory I examined 11 male female pairs of sea urchins for variation in <b>sperm</b> velocity <b>and</b> <b>sperm</b> longevity, <b>and</b> determined the correlations of these traits with the percentage of eggs fertilized with serially diluted sperm. Males with faster sperm had higher rates of fertilization than males with slower sperm. Within individual males, as sperm aged they slowed down and showed a reduced percentage activity and lower rates of fertilization. Across males, the average velocity of freshly spawned sperm was inversely related to sperm longevity. These results establish the possibility that sperm traits are adapted for varying conditions along a continuum from sperm limitation to sperm competition...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDue to {{socioeconomic}} factors, more {{couples are}} choosing to delay conception than ever. Increasing average maternal and paternal age in developed countries over the past 40  years has {{raised the question of}} how aging affects reproductive success of males and females. Since oxidative stress in the male reproductive tract increases with age, we investigated the impact of advanced paternal age on the integrity of <b>sperm</b> nucleus <b>and</b> reproductive success of males by using a Prdx 6 −/− mouse model. We compared sperm motility, cytoplasmic droplet retention <b>sperm</b> chromatin quality <b>and</b> reproductive outcomes of young (2 -month-old), adult (8 -month-old), and old (20 -month-old) Prdx 6 −/− males with their age-matched wild type (WT) controls. Absence of PRDX 6 caused age-dependent impairment of <b>sperm</b> motility <b>and</b> <b>sperm</b> maturation <b>and</b> increased <b>sperm</b> DNA fragmentation <b>and</b> oxidation as well as decreased <b>sperm</b> DNA compaction <b>and</b> protamination. Litter size, total number of litters and total number of pups per male were significantly lower in Prdx 6 −/− males compared to WT controls. These abnormal reproductive outcomes were severely affected by age in Prdx 6 −/− males. In conclusion, the advanced paternal age affects <b>sperm</b> chromatin integrity <b>and</b> fertility more severely in the absence of PRDX 6, suggesting a protective role of PRDX 6 in age-associated decline in the <b>sperm</b> quality <b>and</b> fertility in mice...|$|R
5|$|Like most brown algae, Postelsia {{goes through}} {{alternation}} of generations, {{and is an}} annual species. The diploid sporophyte produces, through meiosis, haploid spores, which drip down through the grooves in the blades onto the substrate, which may be mussels, barnacles, or bare rock. These spores develop, through mitosis, into small, multicellular haploid gametophytes, male and female. The male and female gametophytes create <b>sperm</b> <b>and</b> eggs, respectively. The sperm of the male reaches the female egg and fertilizes, resulting in a diploid zygote, which develops into a new sporophyte.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{other members}} of this phylum, {{anthozoans}} {{do not have a}} medusa stage in their development. Instead, they release <b>sperm</b> <b>and</b> eggs into the water. After fertilisation, the planula larvae form part of the plankton. When fully developed, the larvae settle on the seabed and attach to the substrate, undergoing metamorphosis into polyps. Some anthozoans can also reproduce asexually through budding or by breaking in pieces. More than 6,100 species have been described.|$|E
5|$|Between 1985 and 2007, only {{an average}} of 18 sockeye salmon {{returned}} to Idaho each year. Serious conservation efforts by wildlife biologists and fish hatcheries have captured the few remaining wild sockeye salmon, collected their <b>sperm</b> <b>and</b> eggs, and in a laboratory, have them spawn. Instead of spawning naturally, these sockeye begin their lives in an incubator in a fishery biologist's laboratory. These baby salmon then are transported by ship, bypassing the dams. (The dams can hurt juvenile baby sockeye salmon with their powerful tides and currents, which suck the baby salmon down.) Another conservation effort that has helped the salmon recover, is the destruction of old, outdated dams, such as the Lewiston Dam on the Clearwater River, {{a tributary of the}} Snake.

5|$|Egg-laying (ovipositing) {{involves}} {{not only}} the female darting over floating or waterside vegetation to deposit eggs on a suitable substrate, but also the male hovering above her or continuing to clasp her and flying in tandem. The male attempts to prevent rivals from removing his <b>sperm</b> <b>and</b> inserting their own, something made possible by delayed fertilisation and driven by sexual selection. If successful, a rival male uses his penis to compress or scrape out the sperm inserted previously; this activity takes up {{much of the time}} that a copulating pair remains in the heart posture. Flying in tandem has the advantage that less effort is needed by the female for flight and more can be expended on egg-laying, and when the female submerges to deposit eggs, the male may help to pull her out of the water.|$|E

40|$|Background Oxidative {{stress is}} the result of an {{imbalance}} between the production and scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Recently, oxidative stress has been introduced as a major cause of male infertility.

Patients <b>and</b> Methods This case control study was conducted using 35 men with idiopathic infertility and 34 men with proven fertility. Seminal plasma TAC and MDA were measured by ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) and thiobarbituric acid (TBA) reaction methods, respectively. Results Seminal TAC levels were significantly lower and seminal MDA levels were significantly higher in men with idiopathic infertility than in fertile men (P < 0. 0001 and P = 0. 004, respectively). A positive correlation was shown between sperm motility, <b>sperm</b> morphology, <b>and</b> TAC levels in men with idiopathic infertility (P = 0. 002 and P = 0. 002, respectively). In addition, there was a correlation between <b>sperm</b> motility <b>and</b> TAC levels in fertile men (P = 0. 005). There was no correlation between <b>sperm</b> count <b>and</b> TAC levels in either men with idiopathic infertility or in fertile men.

5|$|Fusion is {{the process}} by which two lipid bilayers merge, {{resulting}} in one connected structure. If this fusion proceeds completely through both leaflets of both bilayers, a water-filled bridge is formed and the solutions contained by the bilayers can mix. Alternatively, if only one leaflet from each bilayer is involved in the fusion process, the bilayers are said to be hemifused. Fusion is involved in many cellular processes, in particular in eukaryotes, since the eukaryotic cell is extensively sub-divided by lipid bilayer membranes. Exocytosis, fertilization of an egg by <b>sperm</b> <b>and</b> transport of waste products to the lysozome {{are a few of the}} many eukaryotic processes that rely on some form of fusion. Even the entry of pathogens can be governed by fusion, as many bilayer-coated viruses have dedicated fusion proteins to gain entry into the host cell.|$|E
5|$|Homologous {{recombination}} {{is a type}} {{of genetic}} recombination in which nucleotide sequences are exchanged between two similar or identical molecules of DNA. It is most widely used by cells to accurately repair harmful breaks that occur on both strands of DNA, known as double-strand breaks. Homologous recombination also produces new combinations of DNA sequences during meiosis, the process by which eukaryotes make gamete cells, like <b>sperm</b> <b>and</b> egg cells in animals. These new combinations of DNA represent genetic variation in offspring, which in turn enables populations to adapt during the course of evolution. Homologous recombination is also used in horizontal gene transfer to exchange genetic material between different strains and species of bacteria and viruses.|$|E
