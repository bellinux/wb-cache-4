Commonly used doxorubicin-containing regimens are AC (adriamycin, cyclophosphamide), TAC (taxotere, AC), ABVD (Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine), BEACOPP, CHOP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) and FAC (5-fluorouracil, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide).|$|E
5|$|Doxorubicin, {{sold under}} the trade names Adriamycin among others, is a {{chemotherapy}} medication {{used to treat}} cancer.

Doxorubicin is given by injection into a vein.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to endometrial carcinomas, the uncommon endometrial stromal sarcomas are cancers that {{originate in the}} non-glandular connective tissue of the endometrium. They are generally non-aggressive and, if they recur, can take decades. Metastases to the lungs and pelvic or peritoneal cavities are the most frequent. They typically have estrogen and/or progesterone receptors. The prognosis for low-grade endometrial stromal <b>sarcoma</b> is good, with 60–90% five-year survival. High-grade undifferentiated endometrial <b>sarcoma</b> (HGUS) has a worse prognosis, with high rates of recurrence and 25% five-year survival. HGUS prognosis is dictated by {{whether or not the}} cancer has invaded the arteries and veins. Without vascular invasion, the five-year survival is 83%; it drops to 17% when vascular invasion is observed. Stage I ESS has the best prognosis, with five-year survival of 98% and ten-year survival of 89%. ESS makes up 0.2% of uterine cancers.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Sarcomas</b> {{represent}} a significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenge that requires techniques to provide better {{assessment of the}} disease than provided by traditional means. FDG-PET depicts the increased metabolism in abnormal tissues, enabling visualisation and quantification in vivo. The objective of this review {{was to assess the}} diagnostic value of FDG-PET in the detection, grading and therapy response of soft tissue and bone <b>sarcomas.</b> Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical studies on FDG-PET and <b>sarcomas</b> was conducted. Databases of PubMed, Embase and Cochrane were searched for studies. Besides that, the references of identified studies were reviewed. Three reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality. Statistical pooling was possible for studies concerning detection and grading of studies with mixed <b>sarcomas</b> (soft tissue and bone) and studies with soft tissue <b>sarcomas</b> only. Results: Twenty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria. There was disagreement between the reviewers in 21. 5 % of the questions from the criteria list. The methodological quality of most of the included studies was poor. Pooled sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of PET for the detection of <b>sarcomas</b> were 0. 91, 0. 85 and 0. 88, respectively. The difference between the mean Standard Uptake Value (SUV) in malignant and benign tumours for the studies concerning mixed and soft tissue <b>sarcomas</b> was statistically significant, as well as the difference in FDG uptake between low and high grade mixed <b>sarcomas.</b> Conclusions: The meta-analysis in this study was limited by the fact that only a few studies had mutual comparable outcome parameters. Moreover, the methodological quality of the studies was generally poor. Nevertheless, our results indicate that FDG-PET can discriminate between <b>sarcomas</b> and benign tumours and low and high grade <b>sarcomas</b> based on the mean SUV. The diagnostic implications of these results have to be investigated, especially the discrimination between benign tumours and low grade <b>sarcomas.</b> Based on this meta-analysis, there is no indication to use FDG-PET in the standard treatment of <b>sarcomas.</b> In the future PET imaging in bone and soft tissue <b>sarcomas</b> should be directed to the clinical implication for the detection and grading of <b>sarcomas</b> and the treatment evaluation of locally advanced <b>sarcomas.</b> (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

5|$|People with AIDS have an {{increased}} risk of developing various viral-induced cancers, including Kaposi's <b>sarcoma,</b> Burkitt's lymphoma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, and cervical cancer. Kaposi's <b>sarcoma</b> is the most common cancer occurring in 10 to 20% of people with HIV. The second most common cancer is lymphoma, which is the cause of death of nearly 16% of people with AIDS and is the initial sign of AIDS in 3 to 4%. Both these cancers are associated with human herpesvirus 8. Cervical cancer occurs more frequently in those with AIDS because of its association with human papillomavirus (HPV). Conjunctival cancer (of the layer that lines the inner part of eyelids and the white part of the eye) is also more common in those with HIV.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} {{the incidence of}} intra-articular synovial <b>sarcomas</b> and investigate if any radiological variables can differentiate them from localized (unifocal) pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) and if multivariate data analysis {{could be used as}} a complementary clinical tool. Methods. Magnetic resonance images and radiographs of 7 cases of intra-articular synovial <b>sarcomas</b> and 14 cases of localized PVNS were blindedly reviewed. Variables analyzed were size, extra-articular growth, tumor border, blooming, calcification, contrast media enhancement, effusion, bowl of grapes sign, triple signal intensity sign, synovial low signal intensity, synovitis, age, and gender. Univariate and multivariate data analysis, the method of partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), were used. Register data on all synovial <b>sarcomas</b> were extracted for comparison. Results. The incidence of intra-articular synovial <b>sarcomas</b> was 3 %. PLS-DA showed that age, effusion, size, and gender were the most important factors for discrimination between <b>sarcomas</b> and localized PVNS. No <b>sarcomas</b> were misclassified as PVNS with PLS-DA, while some PVNS were misclassified as <b>sarcomas.</b> Conclusions. The most important variables in differentiating intra-articular <b>sarcomas</b> from localized PVNS were age, effusion, size, and gender. Multivariate data analysis can be helpful as additive information to avoid a biopsy, if the tumor is classified as most likely being PVNS...|$|R

We have developed a real-time, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) multiplex assay for the identification of the primary fusion transcript types (SYT-SSX 1 and SYT-SSX 2) from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. Twenty-nine of 30 (96. 7 %) histologically diagnosed FFPE synovial <b>sarcomas</b> were positive for the presence of either the SYT-SSX 1 or SYT-SSX 2 fusion transcripts. Ten of 16 (62. 5 %) and five of 16 (31. 25 %) monophasic fibrous synovial <b>sarcomas</b> were positive for SYT-SSX 1 and SYT-SSX 2, respectively.

5|$|Biologically active {{mushroom}} polysaccharides {{have been}} a frequent research topic in recent decades due to their possible stimulatory effect on innate and cell-mediated immune responses, antitumor activities, and other activities. Immunostimulatory activity, antioxidant activity, cholesterol-lowering, and blood sugar-lowering effects have been detected in extracts of R.virescens fruit bodies, which are attributed to polysaccharides. A water-insoluble beta-glucan, RVS3-II, has been isolated from the fruit bodies. Sulfated derivatives of this compound have antitumor activities against <b>sarcoma</b> tumor cell lines. RVP, a water-soluble polysaccharide present in the mushroom, is made largely of galactomannan subunits and has antioxidant activity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Uterine <b>sarcomas</b> are a rare {{group of}} {{neoplasms}} with aggressive clinical course and poor prognosis.

Regarding adjuvant chemotherapy, there is little evidence in the literature supporting its use except for carcinosarcomas.

40|$|SummaryThe cell {{of origin}} for most mesenchymal tumors is unclear. One cell type that {{contributes}} to this lineages is the pericyte, a cell expressing Ng 2 /Cspg 4. Using lineage tracing, we demonstrated that bone and soft tissue <b>sarcomas</b> driven by the deletion of the Trp 53 tumor suppressor, or desmoid tumors driven by a mutation in Apc, can derive from cells expressing Ng 2 /Cspg 4. Deletion of the Trp 53 tumor suppressor gene in these cells resulted in the bone and soft tissue <b>sarcomas</b> that closely resemble human <b>sarcomas,</b> while stabilizing β-catenin in this same cell type caused desmoid tumors. Comparing expression between Ng 2 /Cspg 4 -expressing pericytes lacking Trp 53 and <b>sarcomas</b> that arose from deletion of Trp 53 showed inhibition of β-catenin signaling in the <b>sarcomas.</b> Activation of β-catenin inhibited the formation and growth of <b>sarcomas.</b> Thus, pericytes can be a cell of origin for mesenchymal tumors, and β-catenin dysregulation {{plays an important role}} in the neoplastic phenotype...|$|R
40|$|Context: Inducible {{nitric oxide}} synthase (iNOS) is a cytoplasmic enzyme which {{plays a crucial role}} in the {{pathogenesis}} of oral carcinomas and <b>sarcomas.</b> Aims: The objective of this study was to analyze the immunohistochemical expression of iNOS in carcinomas and <b>sarcomas</b> affecting the oral cavity in order to understand the possible role of iNOS in their biologic behavior and to correlate iNOS expression with lymph node metastasis in carcinomas and <b>sarcomas.</b> Settings and Design: Patients, who attended the oral diagnosis department of Vinayaka Missions Sankarachariyar Dental College, were screened, for the purpose of the study. Besides these, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were also retrieved from archives of the Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology Department. A total of 40 cases (20 carcinomas and 20 <b>sarcomas)</b> were selected for the study. Subjects and Methods: A total of 40 cases (20 carcinomas and 20 <b>sarcomas)</b> were selected for the study. Five apparently normal tissues were obtained from the tumor adjacent normal tissue to be used as a control. These were subjected to immunohistochemical staining using antibody to iNOS and evaluated. Statistical Analysis Used: The results were analyzed using the Chi-square test. Results: Among the 20 carcinomas 19 showed a positive immunoreactivity for iNOS and 1 case was negative. Among the 19 immunopositive iNOS cases of carcinomas, 15 cases showed positive lymph node metastasis. Among the <b>sarcomas,</b> positive immunoreactivity for iNOS was seen in 10 hard tissue <b>sarcomas,</b> while the remaining 10 soft tissue <b>sarcomas</b> were negative for iNOS expression. The results were analyzed using the Chi-square test. Conclusions: iNOS is a reliable marker for lymph node metastasis in carcinomas irrespective of the histologic grade. The high expression in carcinomas shows that the carcinomas elaborate more angiogenesis for growth compared with the <b>sarcomas</b> with the exception of hard tissue <b>sarcomas...</b>|$|R
