40|$|Tree {{mortality}} {{has traditionally}} been evaluated in forest inventories through summaries of dead trees by location, species, and several causal agents. Although these methods were most commonly used, {{in order to assess}} <b>forests</b> <b>sustainable</b> <b>development,</b> they have had limited use in detecting mortality trends and development dynamics. This study proposes the application of survival analysis for the purpose of analyzing tree mortality. Individual tree growth increments were used to estimate survival and hazard functions for the Elatia forest (Drama, Northeast Greece). These estimates provided indications of regional mortality by diameter at breast height (DBH) and diameter growth ([Delta]DBH) between successive measurements. Comparisons of survival/hazard curves and tests of effects of species and crown class (CC) on individual survival curves were conducted.

This study was conducted using undisturbed soil samples collected at the 0. 1 - 0. 125 m depth. Undisturbed soil samples were used in the uniaxial compression tests. Soil sampling consisted of two stages, before and after the mechanized harvest operations. The traffic effects on the sigmap in the dry season indicated that the soil compaction process was neither evident nor important.

Utilising two Australian rural communities in Eden/Gippsland and Tasmania as qualitative case studies, this research explores how 23 non-forestry affiliated rural residents perceived and experienced the TBL economic, environmental and social impacts of plantation forestry. Residents criticised the economic plantation forestry benefits because of lengthy periods of inactivity and limited local employment, explaining that their community was reliant on the industry yet the promised economic benefits had never fully materialised. There was a sense the industry ‘plant and walk away. ’ Residents were concerned about the environment impact on water quality, water tables and fire hazards, although they praised plantation forestry for carbon sequestering, eradicating erosion and water run-off. Negative social impacts were described, specifically how the land-use change from farming to forestry had significantly reduced the local population, employment and need for services.

40|$|AbstractEconomic {{assessment}} of forest ecosystems {{is especially important}} for determining efficiency of investment in: biodiversity conservation, expansion of the national forest and rational use of forest resources, <b>sustainable</b> <b>forest</b> <b>development.</b> In Romania, although discussed and debated in recent years, this subject has generated and still produces theoretical, methodological and practical issues.

Without sufficient knowledge about the value of forest ecosystem services, consequences unpredictability tends to increase with the degree of change. This paper will address some issues related to estimating the economic value of forests in Romania and ecosystem services provided by forests.

40|$|<b>Sustainable</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>Development</b> aims at use and {{conservation}} of forest resources {{while at the}} same time meeting the development goals of an economy. At present, in India, this objective is met almost entirely through the use of legal & administrative controls rather than encouraging voluntary compliance. In this context, need has been felt to evolve an integrated strategy so that the contribution and requirements of various stakeholders in management of forests are incorporated. This would also require appropriate valuation of forests to account for the broader dimensions of benefits and costs incurred by the people and concerned institutions. It is suggested that a holistic approach for valuation of forests is essential while examining the issue of compensation for expansion and maintenance of forest cover. There is need to identify the set of people/institutions that bear the cost vis-à-vis the beneficiaries in order to develop an appropriate incentive mechanism. Here, the involvement of local people is of paramount importance. Since benefits from forestry are widespread, stakeholders that bear greater costs should be suitably compensated. For this, the modus-operandi in the Indian context needs to be worked out...|$|E
40|$|The FLEGT (Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade) {{initiative}} {{is among the}} recent attempts to combat deforestation and promote <b>sustainable</b> <b>forest</b> <b>development.</b> However, ideas about what the objectives of FLEGT are and how legality should be interpreted differ among different actors involved. Some advocate a narrow interpretation of legality that promotes a strong {{role of the state}} and focuses on law enforcement, while others advocate a broader interpretation that includes issues of participation and sustainability. These different interpretations mirror current developments in international forest governance which are influenced on the one hand by broader trends in governance, which focus on voluntary instruments, participation and marketization, while on the other hand, the nation state remains a very powerful actor. This article uses a discourse analytical approach to analyze the discursive structure of FLEGT, particularly the European Union FLEGT Action Plan and the Indonesian legality standards. Our findings show that FLEGT is first and foremost shaped by state oriented discourses that promote regulatory instruments and a narrow interpretation of legality. Sustainability and participatory considerations are present, both in the EU and in the Indonesian context, but they come in a secondary position. The article concludes by positioning these findings in the international forest governance debate and by discussing the implications of the discursive structure of FLEGT for sustainability, participatory governance and the state...|$|E
40|$|Many {{countries}} around the world are engaged in decentralization processes, and most African countries face serious problems with forest governance, from benefits sharing to illegality and <b>sustainable</b> <b>forest</b> management. This book summarizes experiences to date on the extent and nature of decentralization and its outcomes - most of which suggest an underperformance of governance reforms - and explores the viability of different governance instruments in the context of weak governance and expanding commercial pressures over forests. Findings are grouped into two thematic areas: decentralization, livelihoods and <b>sustainable</b> <b>forest</b> management; and international trade, finance and forest sector governance reforms. The authors examine diverse forces shaping the forest sector, including the theory and practice of decentralization, usurpation of authority, corruption and illegality, inequitable patterns of benefits capture and expansion of international trade in timber and carbon credits, and discuss related outcomes on livelihoods, forest condition and equity. The book builds on earlier volumes exploring different dimensions of decentralization and perspectives from other world regions, and distills dimensions of forest governance that are both unique to Africa and representative of broader global patterns.

30|$|In {{parallel}} with the growing concerns about the protection of soils and tree regeneration, and the environmental sustainability of the forestry practices, the Quebec’s forest sector was severely impacted by the 2007 – 2010 recession that followed {{the collapse of the}} housing bubble in the US. Together, these events lead to profound reflections on Quebec forest management and eventually to the adoption of a new forest management regime specifically designed to implement <b>sustainable</b> <b>forest</b> <b>development</b> through ecosystem-based management (Government of Quebec 2017). This approach aims to maintain both productivity and biodiversity of the forested landscapes of Québec (Gauthier et al. 2008). Achieving these two goals however is challenging, at least at the stand scale. For example, biodiversity protection involves maintaining forest structures that are often associated to old forests, which have the additional benefit of storing large amounts of carbon in their organic soils (Fenton et al. 2009). Old forests however are increasingly rare in managed landscapes. Maintaining the abundance of old forests can be achieved through full conservation of old-growth forests but also by using partial cutting, a silvicultural practice that is however susceptible to reduce productivity on paludified sites (Fenton et al. 2009). Nevertheless, reporting on the fifteen-year results of uneven-aged management in forested peatlands, Groot (2013) observed and increase in basal area with time indicating that partial cutting can maintain stands which structure is suitable for the implementation of uneven-aged silviculture through the use of partial cutting.|$|E
40|$|Calcareous soils {{represent}} up to {{one third}} of the forest land base in southeastern British Columbia (B. C.). Throughout B. C., calcareous soils occupy about 10 % of the land base. Calcareous soils contain sufficient free lime (calcium carbonate or magnesium carbonate) to effervesce when treated with 10 % hydrochloric acid. These soils have high pH, are often finer textured, and occur in B. C. because of semi-arid conditions and/or limestone derived soil parent material. The B. C. Ministry of Forests (B. C. MoF) and Canadian Forest Service (CFS) have studied tree growth on disturbed calcareous soils for over 25 years. Early B. C. MoF studies on harvesting and site preparation disturbance, and CFS studies on skidroad disturbance, created an awareness of the sensitivity of these soils. Soil disturbance guidelines that recognize this sensitivity were developed during the 1980 s and incorporated in the 1995 Forest Practices Code of B. C. Act. Subsequently, an integrated study on calcareous soils has been developed that incorporates existing and new research sites. The largest new installation is a Long-Term Soil Productivity study (LTSP) that includes rehabilitation treatments and “miniplots ” to monitor smaller disturbances, such as displacement and exposure of calcareous subsoils. Mirroring research trials on non-calcareous soils, the objectives of the studies are to test and verify policy aimed at ensuring <b>sustainable</b> <b>forest</b> <b>development.</b> Results to date indicate that trees of some species, such as white spruce (Picea glauca), may grow 30 % less on undisturbed calcareous soils...|$|E

40|$|Background Conceptual {{models of}} forest {{dynamics}} are powerful cognitive tools, which are indispensable for communicating ecological ideas and knowledge, and in developing strategic approaches and setting targets for forest conservation, restoration and <b>sustainable</b> management. <b>Forest</b> <b>development</b> through time is conventionally {{described as a}} directional, or “linear”, and predictable sequence of stages from “bare ground” to old forest representing the “climax-state”. However, this simple view is incompatible with the current {{knowledge and understanding of}} intrinsic variability of forest dynamics. Hypothesis Overly simple conceptual models of forest dynamics easily become transformed into biased mental models of how forests naturally develop and what kind of structures they display. To be able to communicate the essential features and diversity of forest dynamics, comprehensive conceptual models are needed. For this end, Kuuluvainen (2009) suggested a relatively simple conceptual model of forest dynamics, which separates three major modes of forest dynamics, and incorporates state changes and transitions between the forest dynamics modes depending on changes in disturbance regime. Conclusions Conceptual models of forest dynamics should be comprehensive enough to incorporate both long-term directional change and short-term cyclic forest dynamics, as well as transitions from one dynamics mode to another depending on changes in the driving disturbance regime type. Models that capture such essential features of forest dynamics are indispensable for educational purposes, in setting reference conditions and in developing methods in forest conservation, restoration and ecosystem management...|$|R
40|$|In acidic forest soils, {{availability}} of inorganic nutrients is a tree-growth-limiting factor. A hypothesis to explain <b>sustainable</b> <b>forest</b> <b>development</b> proposes that tree roots select soil microbes involved in central biogeochemical processes, such as mineral weathering, that {{may contribute to}} nutrient mobilization and tree nutrition. Here we showed, by combining soil analyses with cultivation-dependent analyses of the culturable bacterial communities associated with the widespread mycorrhizal fungus Scleroderma citrinum, a significant enrichment of bacterial isolates with efficient mineral weathering potentials around the oak and beech mycorrhizal roots compared to bulk soil. Such a difference {{did not exist in}} the rhizosphere of Norway spruce. The mineral weathering ability of the bacterial isolates was assessed using a microplaque assay that measures the pH and the amount of iron released from biotite. Using this microplate assay, we demonstrated that the bacterial isolates harboring the most efficient mineral weathering potential belonged to the Burkholderia genus. Notably, previous work revealed that oak and beech harbored very similar pHs in the 5 - to 10 -cm horizon in both rhizosphere and bulk soil environments. In the spruce rhizosphere, in contrast, the pH was significantly lower than that in bulk soil. Because the production of protons {{is one of the main}} mechanisms responsible for mineral weathering, our results suggest that certain tree species have developed indirect strategies for mineral weathering in nutrient-poor soils, which lie in the selection of bacterial communities with efficient mineral weathering potentials...|$|E
40|$|Nitrogen {{availability}} and uptake capacity are key factors influencing forest {{growth and development}} in N-limited terrestrial ecosystems. With the aim to determine how species and forest management affect tree N nutrition, we conducted root N uptake experiments as well as soil N analyses at three forest stands with different native and introduced tree species (i. e. Larix principis-rupprechtii Mayr., Quercus aliena var. acutiserrata Maxim. ex Wenz. and Picea wilsonii Mast.) and two management approaches (i. e. monoculture versus mixed stand) in the Qinling Mountains of China. Across the native and introduced species studied, in general, investigated trees take up both, organic and inorganic N compounds, but prefer organic N (Gln- and Arg-) over inorganic NH 4 +–N. The introduced conifer species (L. principis-ruprechtii) showed higher root N acquisition capacities compared to a native conifer species (P. wilsonii) under N-limited conditions. Moreover, the mixed forest stand with L. principis-ruprechtii and Q. alinea var. acutesserata accumulated more nitrogen in soil pools and showed improved C and N retention capability through the whole soil profile {{as compared to the}} monocultures of P. wilsonii or L. principis-ruprechtii. Similar acquisition strategies were observed for specific N sources (i. e. organic versus inorganic) across all investigated tree species. Still the introduced species Larix exhibited a superior root N acquisition capacity and, therefore, may be a good candidate for afforestation programs in the studied region. The present results underpin the significance of forest management practices that achieve a mixed species structure with broadleaved tree species such as Quercus for restoration of soil C and N pools in order to stabilize forest ecosystems and to achieve <b>sustainable</b> <b>forest</b> <b>development...</b>|$|E
40|$|The climate {{negotiations}} at the COP 15 in December 2009 did {{not produce}} a new international treaty with binding emissions commitments but the Copenhagen Accord for dealing with post- 2012 climate change. Given the current climate negotiation process {{it is unlikely that}} we will see a global climate agreement soon on a global cap between all Convention members participating in a single carbon market. We {{may be more likely to}} see a stepwise process moving towards this scenario, most likely involving linkages between different national policy programs when it comes to mitigation as well as offsetting emissions. In such a process countries will offer commitments based on their domestic abilities, preferences and policies, norms and institutions. National and sub-national policies are thus likely to be the de-facto building blocks of nations' abilities to make and fulfill international commitments. However, also with multilateral mitigation programs without binding commitments, carbon markets will be needed as well as international authorities that support measurement, reporting and verification rules and the international registries. Such markets will necessarily be complicated and temporary in a world without an overarching binding agreement. There will be numerous tradeoffs between different kinds of second-best arrangements.

40|$|Abstract Background Conceptual {{models of}} forest {{dynamics}} are powerful cognitive tools, which are indispensable for communicating ecological ideas and knowledge, and in developing strategic approaches and setting targets for forest conservation, restoration and <b>sustainable</b> management. <b>Forest</b> <b>development</b> through time is conventionally {{described as a}} directional, or “linear”, and predictable sequence of stages from “bare ground” to old forest representing the “climax-state”. However, this simple view is incompatible with the current {{knowledge and understanding of}} intrinsic variability of forest dynamics. Hypothesis Overly simple conceptual models of forest dynamics easily become transformed into biased mental models of how forests naturally develop and what kind of structures they display. To be able to communicate the essential features and diversity of forest dynamics, comprehensive conceptual models are needed. For this end, Kuuluvainen (2009) suggested a relatively simple conceptual model of forest dynamics, which separates three major modes of forest dynamics, and incorporates state changes and transitions between the forest dynamics modes depending on changes in disturbance regime. Conclusions Conceptual models of forest dynamics should be comprehensive enough to incorporate both long-term directional change and short-term cyclic forest dynamics, as well as transitions from one dynamics mode to another depending on changes in the driving disturbance regime type. Models that capture such essential features of forest dynamics are indispensable for educational purposes, in setting reference conditions and in developing methods in forest conservation, restoration and ecosystem management...|$|R
