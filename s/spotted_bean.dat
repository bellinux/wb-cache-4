Results recorded significant difference for seed and protein yields, seed protein percentage and number and weight of nodules. Of the strains of Rhizobium leguminosarum;bv. phaseoli Rb 117 strain had the most effect on common bean. Of the three cultivars that were tested, COS 16 line was the most successful cultivar. High seed yield and good evaluations for other traits were achieved from COS 16 line (<b>spotted</b> <b>bean),</b> and Rb 117 strain. Those seeds inoculated with the Rb 117 strain demonstrated a 59 percent increase in seed yield compared to non-inoculated cultivars. The highest record for protein percentage was achieved from 100 kg nitrogen, and Rb 117 treatment and the highest protein yield (864 kg/ha) was from plants inoculated with Rb 117. Of all inoculants (or strains of Rhizobium leguminosarum;bv. phaseoli) the Rb 117 strain had a better effect on common bean compared with other strains. Of the three cultivars tested, COS 16 line was the most successful. High seed yield and good evaluations for other measured traits were achieved from COS 16 line (<b>spotted</b> <b>bean)</b> {{in the second year}} of the experiment with inoculation of the Rb 117 strain.

40|$|Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is {{the most}} {{important}} grain legume in Uganda. Beans managed under conventional systems range in yield from 500 to 800 kg ha- 1, with a yield gap of about 75 %. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the productivity and net profitability of four bean cultivars grown under three management systems on Phaeozem soil (Mollisol) in Masaka District, Uganda. The experimental design was a randomized incomplete block in a split-plot arrangement. Management system was the whole-plot factor and included the Conventional Farmer (CFS), Improved Farmer (IFS), and High Input systems (HIS). Management systems differed for seed fungicide treatment (no vs. yes), seeding density (10 vs. 20 seed m- 2), plant configuration (scatter vs. rows), fertilizer applications (P, K, Ca, and Mg), rhizobium inoculation (no vs. yes), pesticide applications (no vs. yes), and frequency and timing of weeding. Subplots were four common bean cultivars selected for varying resistance to foliar pathogens. Increasing management intensity and planting cultivars tolerant to common bean diseases improved bean grain yield. Mean grain yield was greater in HIS than IFS and CFS. For all management systems, disease resistant NABE 14 produced more grain yield than NABE 15, K 132, and NABE 4. The HIS with NABE 14 produced the most grain (1772 kg ha- 1), most likely due to its greater resistance to angular leaf <b>spot,</b> <b>bean</b> common mosaic virus, and root rot. The economic return to labor and management was greatest for HIS with NABE 14 ($ 559 ha- 1).

40|$|Due to the {{increased}} importance of angular leaf <b>spot</b> of common <b>bean</b> (Phaseolus vulgaris) in Brazil, monitoring the pathogenic variability of its causal agent (Phaeoisariopsis griseola) is the best strategy for a breeding program aimed at developing resistant genotypes. Fifty one isolates of P. griseola collected in five Brazilian States were tested {{on a set of}} 12 international differential cultivars in the greenhouse. When inoculated plants showed symptoms but no sporulation was observed, they were transferred to a moist chamber for approximately 20 - 24 h. After this period of time, if no sporulation was observed, the plants were considered resistant; otherwise, they were considered susceptible. From the fifty-one tested isolates, seven different pathotypes were identified. No Andean pathotypes were identified; consequently, all isolates were classified as Middle American pathotypes. Pathotype 63 - 31 was the most widespread. Pathotype 63 - 63 overcame resistance genes present in all differential cultivars and also the resistance gene(s) present in the cultivar AND 277.

40|$|Infection {{of plants}} by {{bacterial}} leaf pathogens at wound sites {{is common in}} nature. Plants defend wound sites to prevent pathogen invasion, but several pathogens can overcome spatial restriction and enter leaf tissues. The molecular mechanisms used by pathogens to suppress containment at wound infection sites are poorly understood. Here, we studied Pseudomonas syringae strains causing brown <b>spot</b> on <b>bean</b> and blossom blight on pear. These strains exist as epiphytes that can cause disease upon wounding caused by hail, sand storms and frost. We demonstrate that these strains overcome spatial restriction at wound sites by producing syringolin A (SylA), a small molecule proteasome inhibitor. Consequently, SylA-producing strains are able to escape from primary infection sites and colonize adjacent tissues along the vasculature. We found that SylA diffuses from the primary infection site and suppresses acquired resistance in adjacent tissues by blocking signaling by the stress hormone salicylic acid (SA). Thus, SylA diffusion creates a zone of SA-insensitive tissue that is prepared for subsequent colonization. In addition, SylA promotes bacterial motility and suppresses immune responses at the primary infection site. These local immune responses do not affect bacterial growth and were weak compared to effector-triggered immunity. Thus, SylA facilitates colonization from wounding sites by increasing bacterial motility an...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Angular leaf <b>spot</b> {{of common}} <b>bean</b> (ALS), caused by fungus Pseudocercospora griseola (Sacc.) Crous 2 ̆ 6 U.

Development of resistant cultivars is one of main objectives of common bean breeding programs and success in selection of lines and progenies depends on accurate assessments of ALS severity. High conidia production in vitro is difficult and makes the use of artificial inoculation in common bean plants unfeasible (Sanglard et al., 2009). Development of efficient methodologies in conidia production to artificial inoculation has been reported in literature, however, average time to obtain enough sporulation is around 30 to 45 days (Sanglard et al., 2009; Silveira 1967).

Analysis of the B 728 a genome identified 24 LuxR-like proteins, three of which are encoded by salA, syrF, and syrG located adjacent to the syringomycin gene cluster. The LuxR-like proteins encoded by these three genes exhibit a domain architecture that places them in a subfamily of LuxR-like proteins associated with regulation of secondary metabolism in B 728 a. Deletion mutants of salA, syrF, and syrG failed to produce syringomycin and displayed reduction of virulence on bean. The transcriptional start sites of salA, syrG, and syrF were located 63, 235, and 498 bp upstream of the start codons, respectively, using primer extension analysis. The predicted - 10 /- 35 promoter regions of syrF and syrG were confirmed using site-directed mutagenesis and GFP reporters that showed conserved promoter sequences around the - 35 promoter region.

40|$|Pseudomonas syringae is a plant {{pathogen}} whose pathogenicity and host specificity {{are thought to}} be determined by Hop/Avr effector proteins injected into plant cells by a type III secretion system. P. syringae pv. syringae B 728 a, which causes brown <b>spot</b> of <b>bean,</b> is a particularly well-studied strain. The type III secretion system in P. syringae is encoded by hrp (hypersensitive response and pathogenicity) and hrc (hrp conserved) genes, which are clustered in a pathogenicity island with a tripartite structure such that the hrp/hrc genes are flanked by a conserved effector locus and an exchangeable effector locus (EEL). The EELs of P. syringae pv. syringae B 728 a, P. syringae strain 61, and P. syringae pv. tomato DC 3000 differ in size and effector gene composition; the EEL of P. syringae pv. syringae B 728 a is the largest and most complex. The three putative effector proteins encoded by the P. syringae pv. syringae B 728 a EEL—HopPsyC, HopPsyE, and HopPsyV—were demonstrated to be secreted in an Hrp-dependent manner in culture. Heterologous expression of hopPsyC, hopPsyE, and hopPsyV in P. syringae pv. tabaci induced the hypersensitive response in tobacco leaves, demonstrating avirulence activity in a nonhost plant. Deletion of the P. syringae pv. syringae B 728 a EEL strongly reduced virulence in host bean leaves. EELs from nine additional strains representing nine P. syringae pathovars were isolated and sequenced. Homologs of avrPphE (e. g., hopPsyE) and hopPsyA were particularly common. Comparative analyses of these effector genes and hrpK (which flanks the EEL) suggest that the EEL effector genes were acquired by horizontal transfer after the acquisition of the hrp/hrc gene cluster but before the divergence of modern pathovars and that some EELs underwent transpositions yielding effector exchanges or point mutations producing effector pseudogenes after their acquisition...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMuch of the worlds’ annual harvest loss to {{pests and}} {{diseases}} occurs {{as a consequence}} of crops grown in monocultures, or cultivated varieties with uniform resistance. This uniform resistance is met by the continuing evolution of new races of pests and pathogens that are able to overcome resistance genes introduced by modern breeding, creating the phenomenon of boom and bust cycles. One of the few assets available to small-scale farmers in developing countries to reduce pests and diseases damage is their local crop varietal diversity, together with the knowledge to manage and deploy this diversity appropriately. Local crop varietal diversity of banana and plantain (Musa spp.) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) was measured at the community and household levels within farmers’ fields in four agro-ecological areas of Uganda. Resistance of traditional and modern varieties of P. vulgaris to anthracnose, angular leaf <b>spot,</b> and <b>bean</b> fly and of traditional and modern varieties of Musa spp. to black sigatoka, banana weevils and nematodes was assessed from participatory diagnostics of farmer knowledge and cross-site on-farm and on-station trials. By performing cross-site on-farm experiments, it was possible to identify traditional varieties with higher resistance to pest and diseases when grown outside their home sites. Increased diversity of crop varieties, measured by number of varieties (richness) and their evenness of distribution, corresponded to a decrease in the average damage levels across sites and to a reduction of variance of disease damage. In sites with higher disease incidence, households with higher levels of diversity in their production systems had less damage to their standing crop in the field compared to sites with lower disease incidence. The results support what might be expected of a risk-minimizing strategy for use of diversity to reduce pest and disease damage...|$|R

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{metabolome}} fingerprint of pulse consumption. The study of robust and accurate biomarkers for pulse dietary assessment has great value for nutritional epidemiology regarding health benefits and their mechanisms. To characterize the fingerprinting of dietary pulses (chickpeas, lentils and <b>beans),</b> <b>spot</b> urine samples from a subcohort from the PREDIMED study were stratified, using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Non-pulse consumers (≤ 4 g/day of pulse intake) and habitual pulse consumers (≥ 25 g/day of pulse intake) were analysed using a 1 H-NMR metabolomics approach combined with multi- and univariate data analysis. Pulse consumption showed differences through 16 metabolites coming from (i) choline metabolism, (ii) protein-related compounds, and (iii) energy metabolism (including lower urinary glucose). Stepwise logistic regression analysis was applied to design a combined model of pulse exposure, which resulted in glutamine, dimethylamine and 3 -methylhistidine. This model was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC > 90 % in both training and validation sets). The application of NMR-based metabolomics to pulse exposure highlighted new candidates for biomarkers of pulse consumption, the role of choline metabolism and the impact on energy metabolism, generating new hypotheses on energy modulation. Further intervention studies will confirm these findings...|$|R
30|$|Nada et al. (2014) {{stated that}} {{potassium}} silicate {{was the most}} effective treatment among other silicon sources tested, i.e., calcium silicate and sodium silicate in reducing damping-off incidence and in improving plant growth parameters as well as seed yield. Kanto et al. (2006) reported that both potassium silicate and calcium silicate suppressed Fusarium wilt of cucumber for 3 [*]years more than sodium silicate. They tested liquid potassium silicate as soil drench to control the powdery mildew of strawberry in the soil {{and found that the}} soluble potassium silicate suppressed the powdery mildew disease more efficiently as a protective control than as a control to diminish initial incidence. Also, they measured silicate-treated leaves and found that leaves treated by silicate were harder than control leaves. Moreover, Jayawardana et al. (2014) reported that the root and the foliar application of soluble silicon as potassium silicate caused decrease in disease incidence and increase in plant growth and fruit quality parameters. Weerahewa and David (2015) tested tomato cultivars “Thilina” and “Maheshi” by soil application of silicon at 0, 50, and 100 [*]mg/l during the growth stage, flowering stage, and both growth and flowering stages to control anthracnose. They reported a reduction of lesions by 80 % in “Maheshi” and 87 % in “Thilina,” respectively. In this vein, Cherif and Belanger (1992) evaluated amendment with potassium silicate as means to control Pythium ultimum infection on cucumber and reported that supplying the solutions with 100 or 200 [*]ppm of potassium silicate significantly reduced plant mortality, root decay, and yield losses attributed to the infection. Furthermore, Rodrigues et al. (2003, 2010) suggested that potassium silicate sprays could reduce the intensity of angular leaf <b>spot</b> on <b>beans.</b> Liang et al. (2005) noticed that silicon can prevent pathogen penetration into host tissues. Reduction in disease incidence in plants treated with silicon sources under field conditions is not probably due to the fungi-static effects of silicon, but silicon could act as physical barrier against pathogen penetration or it can be used as inducer for defense response in plants (Shen et al. 2010).|$|R

Once inside and changed, he becomes excited upon seeing a couple of kiddie slides and attempts to use one, only for a lifeguard to spot and force him out to the main pool. A little annoyed, <b>Bean</b> soon <b>spots</b> the diving boards and decides to try out the highest one. However, he soon becomes frightened when he learns how high up he is, and tries to chicken out, only to find two boys waiting for their turn.

40|$|The angular leaf <b>spot</b> of dry <b>bean</b> {{caused by}} the fungus Phaeoisairopsis griseola is a very {{important}} disease on dry bean crops in Brazil. In propitious weather conditions, susceptible cultivars have significant losses due to this disease. In these conditions, fungicide usage is an important step for angular leaf spot management. Since the effects of this method of control on plant physiology are not known, this study had the following objectives: a) Verify the action of fungicide in physiological changes in dry beans (photosynthesis rate and stomatal conductivity); b) evaluate the efficacy of some fungicides for the control of angular leaf spot; and c) examine the effects of these fungicides on other agronomic parameters; weight of 100 grains, number of grains per pod and number of pods per plant. The dry bean cultivar used in this study was Perola. Four trials were conducted, two in a net greenhouse and two trials under field conditions. A spray of piraclostrobin, tebuconazol and tebuconazol+ trifloxistrobin increased photosynthesis rates, although stomatal conductivity was not changed. In addition, sprays of tebuconazol, piraclostrobin, metiram+piraclostrobin and azoxistrobin provided better levels of disease control and also higher weight of 100 grains, with the exception of azoxystrobin for this parameter...|$|R

The amounts of chocolate <b>spot</b> on field <b>bean</b> leaves and flowers were increased by irrigation and decreased by benomyl in all seasons. These effects were greater in 1977 and 1978, when there was respectively 76 - 5 and 82 - 4 mm rainfall in June, than in 1979, when there was 30 mm rainfall in June and less chocolate spot developed. Leaves half-way up stems of plants in irrigated, unsprayed plots had 11 % of their area affected in July 1977, 17 % affected in July 1978, but only 4 % affected in August 1979. By contrast, middle leaves of plants in unirrigated, sprayed plots had 3, 4 and 0 - 3 % of their leaves affected in 1977, 1978 and 1979 respectively. Irrigation increased the number of pods per stem in 1977 and 1979 and decreased it in 1978; it decreased grain yield in 1977 and 1978, but increased yield in 1979. Benomyl treatments affected the number of pods little in any year; they increased yield in 1977 and and 1978, but not in 1979...|$|R
40|$|Sources of {{resistance}} to anthracnose and angular leaf <b>spot</b> in common <b>bean</b> for Costa Rica. The objective {{of this study was}} to select sources {{of resistance}} to angular leaf spot and anthracnose from a diverse group of germplasm with known resistance to these diseases and other abiotic and biotic factors. Atotal of 173 common beans that included 46 landraces and 127 breeding lines were evaluated at two locations (Estación Experimental Fabio Baudrit Moreno and Sub-Estacion Experimental Fraijanes, both of Universidad de Costa Rica) in 1996 and 1997. A mixture of four races (races 9, 10, 547, and 1024 of maximum virulence and coverage in Costa Rica) of the anthracnose pathogen was used to inoculate four times. Because of high natural incidence of angular leaf spot, inoculation was not necessary. Twenty-one landraces and 13 breeding lines were resistant (disease score of 3 or less) to antracnose. Only five landraces (G 12529, G 14934, G 19428, G 19696, and G 19831), one improved cultivar (ICA Tundama), and a breeding line UCR 55 had intermediate reaction (disease score between 4 and 6).

50|$|Now on the road, Bean {{pulls out}} a book of stamps and places the last one on his tongue, {{preparing}} {{to put it on}} the letter he wants to post, when he suddenly spots a postbox. Parking next to it, he prepares to stick the stamp on the envelope, only to realise he accidentally swallowed it. Seeing a lady preparing to post a letter, Bean offers to do it for her and pretends to post it. Once she is out of sight, he immediately uses steam from his car's radiator to remove the stamp on it, but cannot make it stick to his letter in the usual way and so uses a sweet stuck in his pocket to do so. Giving his letter to the postman as he comes to empty the postbox, <b>Bean</b> <b>spots</b> the lady return after finding her letter on the ground, and quickly hides in the postbox as she complains to the postman about its missing stamp, effectively trapping himself within. After some time, another postman arrives and frees him, whereupon he loses his car keys down a drain and finds himself forced to wait for a bus. When one does come along, it has no more room for him, forcing him to wait for the next one.|$|R
40|$|A {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} approach using degenerate primers that targeted the conserved domains of cloned plant disease resistance genes (R genes) was used to isolate a set of 15 resistance gene analogs (RGAs) from common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). Eight different classes of RGAs were obtained from nucleotide binding site (NBS) -based primers and seven from not previously described Toll/Interleukin- 1 receptor-like (TIR) -based primers. Putative amino acid sequences of RGAs were significantly similar to R genes and contained additional conserved motifs. The NBS-type RGAs were classified in two subgroups according to the expected final residue in the kinase- 2 motif. Eleven RGAs were mapped at 19 loci on eight linkage groups of the common bean genetic map constructed at Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical. Genetic linkage was shown for eight RGAs with partial resistance to anthracnose, angular leaf <b>spot</b> (ALS) and <b>Bean</b> golden yellow mosaic virus (BGYMV). RGA 1 and RGA 2 were associated with resistance loci to anthracnose and BGYMV and were part of two clusters of R genes previously described. A new major cluster was detected by RGA 7 and explained up to 63. 9 % of resistance to ALS and has a putative contribution to anthracnose resistance. These results show the usefulness of RGAs as candidate genes to detect and eventually isolate numerous R genes in common bean. Peer-reviewe...|$|R
