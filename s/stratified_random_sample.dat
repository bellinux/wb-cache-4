5000|$|The book [...] "Activism, Inc: How the Outsourcing of Grassroots Campaigns Is Strangling Progressive Politics in America"by Columbia University {{sociologist}} Dana Fisher, {{is based}} on an ethnographic study she did in a <b>stratified</b> <b>random</b> <b>sample</b> of fund canvass offices during the summer of 2003. Fisher charges the corporatized fundraising model (of which the Fund is an example) with mistreating idealistic young people by using them as interchangeable parts and providing them with insufficient training; Fisher also believes that the outsourcing of grassroots organizing by groups like the Sierra Club and Greenpeace to organizations like the Fund has led to the decay of grassroots infrastructure and opportunities for involvement on the left (A summary of this book can be found here. The Fund has created a website to respond to a few of the criticisms raised by the book: [...] "http://www.canvassingworks.org". The site includes testimony by former Fund staff who have moved into leading roles in other progressive organizations and other progressive leaders, including U.S. Representative Jan Schakowsky (IL), Sierra Club Executive Director Carl Pope, Dr. Woody Holton (Associate Professor of American history at the University of Richmond), and Randy Hayes of the Rainforest Action Network.|$|E
5000|$|Since its inception, the Stanford-Binet {{has been}} revised several times. Currently, {{the test is}} in its fifth edition, which is called the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales, Fifth Edition, or SB5. According to the publisher's website, [...] "The SB5 was normed on a <b>stratified</b> <b>random</b> <b>sample</b> of 4,800 {{individuals}} that matches the 2000 U.S. Census". By administering the Stanford-Binet test to large numbers of individuals selected at random {{from different parts of}} the United States, it has been found that the scores approximate a normal distribution. The revised edition of the Stanford-Binet over time has devised substantial changes in the way the tests are presented. The test has improved when looking at the introduction of a more parallel form and more demonstrative standards. For one, a non-verbal IQ component is included in the present day tests whereas in the past, there was only a verbal component. In fact, it now has equal balance of verbal and non-verbal content in the tests. It is also more animated than the other tests, providing the test-takers with more colourful artwork, toys and manipulatives. This allows the test to have a higher range {{in the age of the}} test takers. This test is purportedly useful in assessing the intellectual capabilities of people ranging from young children all the way to young adults. However, the test has come under criticism for not being able to compare people of different age categories, since each category gets a different set of tests. Furthermore, very young children tend to do poorly on the test due to the fact that they are lacking in the concentration needed to finish the test.|$|E

40|$|The Sierra report {{proposes a}} {{methodology}} {{for states to}} use to demonstrate that their Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) programs are obtaining emissions reductions similar to those estimated by the MOBILE emissions factor model. The proposed methodology involves comparing fleetwide test average emissions of a state I/M program with those of a benchmark program (Sierra suggests using the Arizona IM 240 program for the benchmark program). The fleet emissions are determined based on the final (passing) IM 240 test results of a <b>stratified</b> <b>random</b> <b>sample</b> of 1, 600 vehicles. Average fleet emissions are determined based on the age distribution of the fleet (Sierra suggests using three age groups, pre- 1975, 1975 - 1980, and post- 1980). The fleet emissions are then compared with the fleet emissions of the benchmark program, reweighted using the evaluated program’s vehicle age distribution. Programs that use an alternative I/M test (e. g. ASM, idle, etc.) and that cannot test {{a random sample of}} IM 240 s, must first determine the correlation between their test and the IM 240, based on a <b>stratified</b> <b>random</b> <b>sample</b> of 700 to 800 vehicles measured on both tests (depending on the type of alternative test used).
