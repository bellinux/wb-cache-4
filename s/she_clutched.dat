2500|$|The {{prosecutor}} {{showed the}} jury the outfit Saldívar had worn during her alleged rape. He claimed {{that someone had}} purposefully torn holes and shredded the shirt with scissors. On October 13, Rosalinda Gonzalez, the assistant manager of the Days Inn, was called to testify. She told the jury that when Selena arrived in the lobby after being shot, she had asked the singer who shot her. Selena cried out [...] "the girl in room 158". Ruben DeLeon, the motel's salesman, said that Selena told him [...] "Yolanda, Yolanda Saldívar shot me. The one in room 158." [...] Receptionist Shawna Vela testified that she had heard the same statements but added that Selena had screamed: [...] "lock the door, she'll shoot me again" [...] before collapsing. Vela told the jury that {{there was so much}} blood that she felt nauseous before calling 911. The last person to be called to testify was paramedic Richard Fredrickson who described, in detail, Selena's condition and a mysterious ring <b>she</b> <b>clutched</b> in her hands. The Quintanilla family were seen sobbing as Fredrickson detailed his attempts to save Selena's life, while Saldívar [...] "stared blankly".|$|E

6000|$|ANDERSON (groaning). Heaven forgive me, I {{left you}} alone with that scoundrel. (Judith remembers. With an agonized cry, <b>she</b> <b>clutches</b> his {{shoulders}} and drags herself to her feet as he rises with her. He clasps her tenderly in his arms.) My poor pet! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How did I? How did I not?' cried <b>she,</b> <b>clutching</b> {{him by the}} arm. 'Where is it? All {{depends on}} that! Fool!' she went on, {{throwing}} him off from her at arm's length, as a sudden suspicion stung her--'you have not given it to the heathen woman?' ...|$|R
60|$|Hetty swayed a little; but <b>she</b> <b>clutched</b> the bridle, and a faint sparkle {{showed in}} her half-closed eyes.|$|E
60|$|The lady {{started as}} {{she gazed at}} me, and her tired eyes widened. <b>She</b> <b>clutched</b> Mr. Riddle's arm.|$|E

50|$|Jeremiah {{wakes up}} in the {{hospital}} with his grandmother beside him. She tells him that Sarah is in the psychiatric ward.

The final scene is of Sarah and Jeremiah driving away.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The covey told me {{you were}} a charwoman; so I suppose you picked the {{envelopes}} out of waste-paper baskets, or such like, and then changed the addresses?' She nods again; still she dare not look up, but she is admiring his legs. When, however, he would cast the letters into the fire, she flames up with sudden spirit. <b>She</b> <b>clutches</b> them.|$|R
6000|$|And {{what is this}} prize {{that the}} {{trembling}} Venetia holds almost convulsively in her grasp, apparently without daring even to examine it? Is this the serene and light-hearted girl, whose face was like the cloudless splendour of a sunny day? Why is she so pallid and perturbed? What strong impulse fills her frame? <b>She</b> <b>clutches</b> in her hand a key! ...|$|R
60|$|But <b>she</b> <b>clutched</b> them tighter to {{her heart}} as she leaned for a moment, pale yet smiling, against the cross.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>clutched</b> at {{his hand}} passionately, and suddenly, as though finding it insufficient, twined {{her arms around his}} neck and kissed him.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the ancient}} kingdom of Mahismati, Sivagami (Ramya Krishnan) {{emerges from a}} cave while {{carrying}} a baby.

6000|$|MISS REED: [...] "Eavesdropping is {{listening}} through a key-hole, or around a corner. This is very different. Besides, it's Oliver, and he's {{been talking about}} ME. Hark!"

40|$|Photograph of a {{portrait}} painting depicting "Lady Hamilton" by George Romney, [s. d. ].

6000|$|THE NYMPH: (Her {{features}} hardening, gropes in {{the folds}} of her habit) Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe) Sully my innocence!

6000|$|... "And look, Jack, {{the ice is}} {{cracking}} everywhere!" [...] {{continued the}} frightened girl. <b>She</b> <b>clutched</b> his arm and looked appealingly into his face. [...] "Oh! what shall we do?" ...|$|E
60|$|He came up, {{thrusting}} {{his fingers}} into a fissure near the summit {{and finding a}} tiny support for his toes. Lowering herself cautiously, <b>she</b> <b>clutched</b> the hand he extended.|$|E
