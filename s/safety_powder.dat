50|$|The fuse {{is set for}} a {{predetermined}} time by rotation of a time ring in {{the lower part of}} the fuze. On firing, set-back causes the time-train firing pin to function. This initiates the powder in the time-train ring and ignites the <b>safety</b> <b>powder</b> pellet, freeing the impact firing pin. Thus the fuze will function on impact if impact occurs before expiration of the set time. The time-setting can be eliminated altogether by turning the setting ring off the scale. It should be noted that the fuze is not interchangeable with fuzes used in other 8 cm mortar ammunition.|$|E

As safety fuse is designed to neither give nor take fire through the heavy fuse jacket, ignition may be achieved by punching a hole perpendicular to and through a <b>safety</b> fuse <b>powder</b> core, threading a piece of Thermalite or similar igniter cord through the hole, then gently squeezing the safety fuse with pliers or similar to bring the powder core into contact with the igniter cord. The Thermalite could be ignited by a match, or more certainly by a purpose made igniter, similar to a wire sparkler.|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to analyze}} the factors that {{influence}} urban consumers' attitudes towards food safety after the melamine scandal. Design/methodology/approach – Based on the research about the attitudes of urban consumers in Nanjing towards the <b>safety</b> of milk <b>powder</b> after the melamine scandal in 2008, this paper adopts the ordered logit model to test which factors significantly influence consumers' attitudes. Findings – The findings suggest that: first, there is a common concern among consumers about the <b>safety</b> of milk <b>powder</b> after the melamine scandal; second, according to the research, the concern is in inverse relation to the level of educational attainment, consumers' awareness of food safety incidents and their opinion of governments' action after the incident. Moreover, those who always have a concern about the safety of the alternatives to milk powder are more easily affected. Originality/value – Different from other researches, the paper focuses on consumers' attitudes towards food safety by studying a specific case, namely the melamine scandal.

50|$|Flash powders {{even within}} {{intended}} usages often release explosive force of deadly capacity. Nearly all widely used flash powder mixtures {{are sensitive to}} shock, friction and electrostatic discharge. In certain mixtures, {{it is not uncommon}} for this sensitivity to spontaneously change over time, or due to change in the environment, or to other unknowable factors in either the original manufacturing or in real-world storage. Additionally, accidental contaminants such as strong acids or sulphur compounds can sensitise them even more. Because flash powder mixtures are so easy to initiate, there is potentially a high risk of accidental explosions which can inflict severe blast/fragmentation injuries, e.g. blindness, explosive amputation, permanent maiming, or disfigurement. Fatalities have occurred. The various flash powder compositions should therefore not be handled by anyone who is unfamiliar with their properties, or the handling techniques required to maintain <b>safety.</b> Flash <b>powder</b> and flash powder devices pose exceptionally high risks to children, who typically cannot understand the danger and may be less adept with safe handling techniques. As a result, children tend to suffer more severe injuries than adults.|$|R
40|$|Human milk is {{recognised}} as {{the best}} form of nutrition for infants. However; in instances where breast-feeding is not possible, unsuitable or inadequate, infant milk formulae are used as breast milk substitutes. These formulae are designed to provide infants with optimum nutrition for normal growth and development and are available in either powdered or liquid forms. Powdered infant formula is widely used for convenience and economic reasons. However; current manufacturing processes are not capable of producing a sterile powdered infant formula. Due to their immature immune systems and permeable gastro-intestinal tracts, infants can be more susceptible to infection via foodborne pathogenic bacteria than other age-groups. Consumption of powdered infant formula contaminated by pathogenic microbes can be a cause of serious illness. In this review paper, we discuss the current manufacturing practices present in the infant formula industry, the pathogens of greatest concern, Cronobacter and Salmonella and methods of improving the intrinsic <b>safety</b> of <b>powdered</b> infant formula via the addition of antimicrobials such as: bioactive peptides; organic acids; probiotics and prebiotics...|$|R

40|$|Background: Until recently, {{members of}} the Cronobacter genus (formerly known as Enterobacter sakazakii) were a {{relatively}} unknown cause of nosocomial infections. However, their association with infant infections, particularly through the consumption of contaminated reconstituted infant formula in neonatal intensive care units, has resulted in international efforts to improve neonatal health care. Aim: To investigate current understanding of this emergent group of bacterial pathogens and the steps taken to reduce neonatal infection. Methods: A literature review was undertaken to determine current knowledge of the Cronobacter genus with respect to recent taxonomic revisions, sources and clinical relevance. Findings: The majority of severe neonatal meningitis infections are associated {{with one of the}} 10 Cronobacter spp., the clonal complex known as C. sakazakii sequence type 4. International efforts by the Food and Agriculture Organizationâ€“World Health Organization (WHO) {{to reduce the risk of}} neonatal infection by this organism have resulted in improved microbiological <b>safety</b> of <b>powdered</b> infant formula (PIF), but revised guidelines for feeding practices have been problematic. In addition, the majority of infections occur in the adult population and the sources are unknown. Conclusion: International improvements in the microbiological safety of PIF and advice on feeding practices have focused on improving neonatal health care following the heightened awareness of Cronobacter infections in this particular age group. These measures are also likely to reduce neonatal exposure to other opportunistic bacterial pathogens, but a number of unresolved issues remain with respect to the practicalities of feeding premature neonates safely while following WHO advice...|$|R

In {{this study we}} evaluated the effect and <b>safety</b> of <b>powdered</b> fermented milk with L. helveticus CM 4 on subjects with high-normal blood pressure or mild hypertension. Methods: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study was conducted using 40 subjects with high-normal blood pressure (HN group) and 40 subjects with mild hypertension (MH group). Each subject ingested 6 test tablets (12 g) containing powdered fermented milk with L. helveticus CM 4 daily for 4 weeks (test group) or {{the same amount of}} placebo tablets for 4 weeks (placebo group). Results: During treatment, the decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in the test group tended to be greater than in the placebo group for both blood pressure groups. At the end of treatment (week 4), a significant decrease in DBP in the HN group was observed (i. e. 5. 0 mm Hg (0. 1, 9. 9; p � 0. 04) compared with the placebo group).

Qualitative tests were used to screen {{the presence or absence}} of proteins, chitin/chitosan from tahong shells. Quantitative analysis using Flameless Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry was used to show the presence of lead in the extracted chitin/chitosan and the de-leading ability of 20 % sodium chloride to help reduce lead from the substances of interest. Skin patch and scratch tests were used in guinea pigs to show dermatologic <b>safety</b> of <b>powdered</b> chitin/chitosan. Tahong shells contain proteins but the pasty substance produced from these proteins was not comparable to commercial paste. Chitin and chitosan were extracted from the tahong shells as evidenced by osazone crystal formations at 25 minutes. The powdered chitin and chitosan contains 3. 1427 and 4. 0171 ppm lead respectively, which fall below the standard recommended by the United States Pharmacopoeia for Nutritional Supplements of 10 ppm. Sodium chloride reduced the lead in chitin and chitosan at 24. 91 and 23. 47 % respectively.

Current intervention strategies have fallen short of ensuring the production of infant formula that is free from C. sakazakii. In this study, we describe the isolation and characterisation of three bacteriophages (phages) and their application as a phage cocktail to inhibit the growth of C. sakazakii in different brands of infant formula, while also assessing the phages ability to prevent biofilm formation. All three phages, isolated from slurry, possess a relatively broad host range, verified by their ability to infect across genera and species. When all three phages were combined and used {{as part of a}} phage cocktail, 73 % coverage was obtained across all Cronobacter strains tested. Optimum thermo-tolerance and pH stability were determined between 4 °C- 37 °C, and pH 6 - 8, respectively, well within the normal range of application of infant formula. Genome sequencing and analysis revealed all the phages to be free from lysogenic properties, a trait which renders each favourable for phage therapy applications. As such, the combined-phage preparation (3 × 10 (8) pfu/mL) was found to possess a strong bactericidal effect on C. sakazakii/C. sakazakii LUX cells (≤ 10 (4) cfu/mL), resulting in a significant reduction in cell numbers, to below the limit of detection (< 10 cfu/mL). This was observed following a 20 h challenge in different brands of infant formula, where samples {{in the absence of the}} phage cocktail reached concentrations of ~ 10 (9) cfu/mL.

The patients stopped taking metformin with lifestyle interventions for three weeks, and 105 patients qualified for the program. They were randomly divided into the Sancai powder group and the metformin group (1500 mg/day). The follow-up period was for 12 weeks. Comparisons of several variables were analyzed. RESULTSNo {{significant differences were found between}} the two groups in hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2 h post-meal glucose (2 hPG), although they had decreased significantly (P < 0. 01).

40|$|Neutron-absorbing Fe-based amorphous-metal {{coatings}} {{have been}} developed that are more corrosion resistant than other criticality-control materials, including Al-B{sub 4 }C composites, borated stainless steels, and Ni-Cr-Mo-Gd alloys. The presence of relatively high concentration of boron in these coatings not only enhances its neutron-absorption capability, but also enables these coatings {{to exist in the}} amorphous state. Exceptional corrosion resistance has been achieved with these Fe-based amorphous-metal alloys through additions of chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten. The addition of rare earth elements such as yttrium has lowered the critical cooling rate of these materials, thereby rendering them more easily processed. Containers used for the storage of nuclear materials, and protected from corrosion through the application of amorphous metal coatings, would have greatly enhanced service lives, and would therefore provide greater long-term <b>safety.</b> Amorphous alloy <b>powders</b> have been successfully produced in multi-ton quantities with gas atomization, and applied to several half-scale spent fuel storage containers and criticality control structures with the high-velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) thermal spray process. Salt fog testing and neutron radiography of these prototypes indicates that such an approach is viable for the production of large-scale industrial-scale facilities and containers. The use of these durable neutron-absorbing materials to coat stainless steel containers and storage racks, as well as vaults, hot-cell facilities and glove boxes could substantially reduce the risk of criticality {{in the event of an}} accident. These materials are particularly attractive for shielding applications since they are fire proof. Additionally, layers of other cold and thermal sprayed materials that include carbon and/or carbides can be used in conjunction with the high-boron amorphous metal coatings for the purpose of moderation. For example, various carbides, including boron, tungsten, and chromium carbide, as well as graphite particles can be co-deposited with a metallic binder phase with either thermal spray or cold spray technology. These moderator layers would also be fire resistant. By coating the vessels and piping used for spent fuel reprocessing, including slab and pencil tanks, enhanced criticality safety and substantially better corrosion resistance can be achieved simultaneously. Since these alloys are Fe-based, any substitution of these for high-performance Ni-based alloys is expected to result in a cost savings. Ultimately, the cost of these materials should comparable to that of stainless steels...|$|R
