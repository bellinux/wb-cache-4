While being lowered to the sea, the winch of the <b>syncrolift</b> {{pulled out of}} the concrete causing the ship to fall down, creating a hole in the hull and sinking the stern. Early reports of significant damage proved to be false and the ship was repaired soon after. Out of ten crew members that were on board at the time, only one sustained minor injuries.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>syncrolift</b> or {{synchrolift}} is {{a system}} for lifting boats and ships {{out of the water}} for maintenance work or repair. [...] The vessel is maneuvered over a submerged cradle, which is then lifted by a set of synchronized hoists or winches. The vessel can be worked upon in place, or it can be moved inland so the <b>syncrolift</b> can be freed for other use.|$|E

5000|$|The largest <b>syncrolifts</b> {{can lift}} vessels up to 100,000 tons. [...] Because of this capacity, <b>syncrolifts</b> have almost {{completely}} supplanted the older dry dock systems, {{most of which}} could handle only one vessel at a time.|$|R
50|$|In 1957, he {{designed}} and built the first <b>Syncrolift</b> shiplift with a lifting capacity of 100 tons, and in 1958 formed Pearlson Engineering Company (PECO) to develop his invention. PECO was taken over in 1959 by the British engineering group Northern Engineering Industries, which later became part of Rolls-Royce plc. PECO became NEI <b>Syncrolift,</b> Inc. in 1986. In 1990 Pearlson and his son Douglas, President of the company, both left to form Pearlson and Pearlson, a shipyard consultancy specializing in drydocking and transfer systems.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Syncrolift</b> System {{was invented}} in the mid 1950s by Raymond Pearlson {{when he was working}} as Chief Engineer for Merrill Stevens, a small Miami shipyard. In 1958 he formed Pearlson Engineering Company (PECO) to develop his invention. PECO was taken over in 1959 by the British {{engineering}} group Northern Engineering Industries (NEI) and for the next 20 years or so Pearlson travelled the world installing his product in hundreds of shipyards. PECO became NEI <b>Syncrolift,</b> Inc. in 1986 and in 1989 became part of Rolls-Royce plc when that company acquired NEI.|$|E
50|$|Raymond Pearlson (born 2 March 1926) is an American marine {{engineer}} and {{the inventor of}} the <b>Syncrolift</b> System, which was designed to both launch ships and lift them out of the water for repair.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Syncrolift</b> System {{was invented}} by Raymond Pearlson, who was later awarded the Sperry Award for the invention, {{development}} and worldwide implementation of a new system for lifting ships {{out of the water}} for repair and for launching new ship construction.|$|E
50|$|Vancouver Shipyards designs, constructs, maintains, {{and repairs}} {{all types of}} vessels. The yard's {{facilities}} include a major steel forming shop, a large fabrication and assembly hall, a totally enclosed paint facility, and a <b>SyncroLift</b> capable of lifting vessels up to 1200 tonnes.|$|E
50|$|The Namibian Ports Authority, or Namport, is a {{state owned}} {{enterprise}} established {{by an act of}} parliament government of Namibia as the national ports authority of Namibia, managing principally the ports of Walvis Bay and Lüderitz, as well as managing a <b>Syncrolift</b> dry dock facility in Walvis Bay. Namport was founded in 1994. Its head office is located in Walvis Bay.|$|E
50|$|The former HMS Bridport was modernized and {{overhauled}} in Bay 1 of the <b>Syncrolift</b> at Rosyth. The {{project was}} started {{ahead of schedule}} to deconflict the programme. After a ceremony at the Fife yard the HMS Bridport became ENS Ugandi and joined the Mineships Division. She differs from the previous two Sandown-class vessels delivered to the Estonian Navy, as she has been fitted with a ZU-23-2 twin mount, 23mm cannon system and a Klein 5000 sidescan sonar.|$|E
50|$|The company's {{shipyard}} is twenty {{five years}} old and is located on reclaimed land just outside the historic port of Harlingen, with unrestricted open-water access from locks and bridges. The facilities include a huge covered and heated dry dock with space for vessels up to 150 meters of length and 7.5 meters drafts. The shipyard also features a 4.500 ton <b>syncrolift,</b> with new construction and refit projects benefitting from having their co-makers on site at the shipyard.|$|E
50|$|It will {{be discerned}} between two {{different}} kinds of platform design, the articulated and the rigid. The articulated platform has hinged connections between the main and the longitudinal beams, this type is amongst other things favored by <b>Syncrolift</b> and TTS. At the rigid platform, the beams are bolted or welded together. The advantage of the rigid system is a better load distribution and the safety against rope break. This type is amongst other things favored by WETEC Group and TTS.|$|E
5000|$|Walvis Bay is Namibia's largest {{commercial}} port, handling {{on average}} 3,000 vessel calls {{per year and}} over 5.3 million tons of cargo. Facilities at the port include a container terminal, privately operated bulk cargo terminal and six tugboats. The expansion of the port will commence in 2012 to increase container storage capacity to 900 000 TEU's [...] There is a <b>Syncrolift</b> dry dock facility at Walvis Bay harbor, for lifting ships {{out of the water}} for repair, separate from the port facilities proper.Walvis bay is linked to landlocked SADC countries via road corridors mainly the Trans Caprivi, Trans Kalahari, Trans Kunene and Trans Oranje.|$|E
50|$|According to {{publications}} and news reports, DBM-241 was reported operational {{as late as}} 2005. An article published in October 2012 reported that the Egyptian Navy bought DBM-241 a year earlier. Although the advance was paid, the official handover of the ship has not happened {{by the time the}} article was published. As of March 2014, the official website of the Armed Forces of Montenegro does not list DBM-241 among its fleet and the ships status remains unknown. The two Silba-class in Croatian hands continue to see service the Navy Flotilla performing traditional naval tasks as well as support missions for civilian institutions such water supply and transporting firefighters.
