The ears are short, the neck {{is the same}} diameter as the head, the legs are short and powerful, the toes are fully webbed, and the tail (one-third of body length) is tapered. These qualities give the river otter a streamlined profile in water, but reduce agility on land. The smell and hearing abilities of the river otter are acute. The otter has a delicate <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> in the paws in addition to great dexterity. River otters characteristically approach within {{a few feet of}} a boat or a person on shore because they're near-sighted, a consequence of vision adapted for underwater sight.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the possible existence of a motivated relation between sound and meaning (“sound symbolism”) in demonstrative pronouns. The goal was to search for evidence of such non-arbitrariness, and {{to gain a better understanding}} of the motivating factors behind it. Six motivations are considered. Two motivations were based on the <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>Touch</b> and Vision. Two others- on the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> Hearing, concerning vowels and consonants. Lastly, two concerned “proto-pointing”, based on the <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> and vision, respectively. Demonstrative pronouns belonging to two-way or three-way deictic systems were used through a genetically and areally spread sample consisting of 101 languages. The findings were divided into motivated (supporting the motivations), non-motivated (not supporting the motivations, arbitrary) and anti-motivated (the reverse of motivated, perhaps functionally). The results showed support for the Touch, Visual and Hearing–Vowel motivations, most strongly for the latter. This implied that the vowel frequency of the demonstrative pronouns is a potent factor in expressing a sound-symbolic relation, perhaps reinforced by the two other motivations. Functional causes such as faster learning of non-arbitrary words are suggested as the driving force behind the phenomenon...|$|R

25|$|Wired gloves. These {{can provide}} input to the {{computer}} about the position and rotation of the hands using magnetic or inertial tracking devices. Furthermore, some gloves can detect finger bending {{with a high degree}} of accuracy (5-10 degrees), or even provide haptic feedback to the user, which is a simulation of the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>touch.</b> The first commercially available hand-tracking glove-type device was the DataGlove, a glove-type device which could detect hand position, movement and finger bending. This uses fiber optic cables running down the back of the hand. Light pulses are created and when the fingers are bent, light leaks through small cracks and the loss is registered, giving an approximation of the hand pose.|$|E
25|$|Tactile imaging is {{a medical}} imaging {{modality}} that translates the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> into a digital image. The tactile image {{is a function of}} P(x,y,z), where P is the pressure on soft tissue surface under applied deformation and x,y,z are coordinates where pressure P was measured. Tactile imaging closely mimics manual palpation, since the probe of the device with a pressure sensor array mounted on its face acts similar to human fingers during clinical examination, slightly deforming soft tissue by the probe and detecting resulting changes in the pressure pattern. Figure on the right presents an experiment on a composite tissue phantom examined by a tactile imaging probe illustrating the ability of tactile imaging to visualize in 3D the structure of the object.|$|E

50|$|Mechanosensation is a {{response}} mechanism to mechanical stimuli. The physiological foundation for the <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>touch,</b> hearing and balance, and pain is the conversion of mechanical stimuli into neuronal signals: mechanosensation. Mechanoreceptors of the skin, called cutaneous mechanoreceptors, are responsible for touch. Tiny cells in the inner ear, called hair cells, are responsible for hearing and balance. States of neuropathic pain, such as hyperalgesia and allodynia, are also directly related to mechanosensation. A wide array of elements {{are involved in the}} process of mechanosensation, many of which are still not fully understood.|$|R
25|$|Scientists {{who study}} {{perception}} and sensation have long understood the human senses as adaptations. Depth perception consists of processing {{over half a}} dozen visual cues, {{each of which is}} based on a regularity of the physical world. Vision evolved to respond to the narrow range of electromagnetic energy that is plentiful and that does not pass through objects. Sound waves go around corners and interact with obstacles, creating a complex pattern that includes useful information about the sources of and distances to objects. Larger animals naturally make lower-pitched sounds as a consequence of their size. The range over which an animal hears, on the other hand, is determined by adaptation. Homing pigeons, for example, can hear very low-pitched sound (infrasound) that carries great distances, even though most smaller animals detect higher-pitched sounds. Taste and smell respond to chemicals in the environment that are thought to have been significant for fitness in the EEA. For example, salt and sugar were apparently both valuable to the human or pre-human inhabitants of the EEA, so present day humans have an intrinsic hunger for salty and sweet tastes. The <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> is actually many senses, including pressure, heat, cold, tickle, and pain. Pain, while unpleasant, is adaptive. An important adaptation for senses is range shifting, by which the organism becomes temporarily more or less sensitive to sensation. For example, one's eyes automatically adjust to dim or bright ambient light. Sensory abilities of different organisms often coevolve, {{as is the case with}} the hearing of echolocating bats and that of the moths that have evolved to respond to the sounds that the bats make.|$|E
25|$|In 1884, London {{hosted the}} International Health Exhibition. This {{exhibition}} placed {{much emphasis on}} highlighting Victorian developments in sanitation and public health, and allowed the nation to display its advanced public health outreach, compared to other countries at the time. Francis Galton took advantage of this opportunity to set up his anthropometric laboratory. He stated {{that the purpose of}} this laboratory was to “show the public the simplicity of the instruments and methods by which the chief physical characteristics of man may be measured and recorded.” The laboratory was an interactive walk-through in which physical characteristics such as height, weight, and eyesight, would be measured for each subject after payment of an admission fee. Upon entering the laboratory, a subject would visit the following stations in order. First, they would fill out a form with personal and family history (age, birthplace, marital status, residence, and occupation), then visit stations that recorded hair and eye color, followed by the keenness, color-sense, and depth perception of sight. Next, they would examine the keenness, or relative acuteness, of hearing and highest audible note of their hearing followed by an examination of their <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>touch.</b> However, because the surrounding area was noisy, the apparatus intended to measure hearing was rendered ineffective by the noise and echoes in the building. Their breathing capacity would also be measured, as well as their ability to throw a punch. The next stations would examine strength of both pulling and squeezing with both hands. Lastly, subjects' heights in various positions (sitting, standing, etc.) as well as arm span and weight would be measured. One excluded characteristic of interest was the size of the head. Galton notes in his analysis that this omission was mostly for practical reasons. For instance, it would not be very accurate and additionally it would require much time for women to disassemble and reassemble their hair and bonnets. The patrons would then be given a souvenir containing all their biological data, while Galton would also keep a copy for future statistical research.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSculpture {{is the art}} of {{creating}} three dimensional forms by using various tools and conveying emotions and thoughts by means of the aesthetic values created in such way. The work of art that comes out in the end may be a form of art that shows abstract or solid features. Statues could be used to tell about persons and sometimes about emotions. The effect of a statue in telling about the emotions could convert into a description related to the language of the material used, and sometimes it is the texture of the form that strengthens this language of description. Each stage from clay kneading to the appearance of form is completed by sensing the various features of surface and texture by means <b>of</b> the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>touching.</b> This sensitivity that comes out with the use <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>touching</b> also shows itself through the appearance of the texture over the surface of the tool. The changes in the understandings of texture line depend on persons or their emotional conditions at that specific moment. The subject of this study is how does a soft tone or hard tone in a piece of music being listened to affects a three dimensional form being worked on. The problem of the research is what kind <b>of</b> a <b>sense</b> does the music or the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> hearing contribute to the already changing nature of the texture that comes out by the use <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>touching</b> and seeing. 8 students in Visual Arts Education and there are two working group of this study.
