40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a natural {{model for the}} realization space of a polytope up to projective equivalence which we call the <b>slack</b> realization <b>space</b> of the polytope. The model arises from the positive part of an algebraic variety determined by the slack ideal of the polytope. This is a saturated determinantal ideal that encodes the combinatorics of the polytope. We also derive {{a new model of}} the realization space of a polytope from the positive part of the variety of a related ideal. The slack ideal offers an effective computational framework for several classical questions about polytopes such as rational realizability, projective uniqueness, non-prescribability of faces, and realizability of combinatorial polytopes. The simplest slack ideals are toric. We identify any toric ideal that arises from a projectively unique polytope as the toric ideal of the bipartite graph given by the vertex-facet non-incidences of the polytope. Several new and classical examples illuminate the relationships between projective uniqueness and toric slack ideals. Comment: Updated references and minor changes.

Therefore, hydrodynamic radii are not a primary determinant of the dehydrating ability. Additionally, CH 2 -concentration of EGs but not alcohols was found to correlate intimately with the measured viscosity of the bulk solution of EGs.

50|$|One of {{the more}} well known tools that is often used for data hiding is called Slacker (part of the Metasploit framework).

Another data hiding technique {{involves the use of}} bad sectors.

50|$|Most file {{systems are}} based on a block device, which is a level of {{abstraction}} for the hardware responsible for storing and retrieving specified blocks of data, though the block size in file systems may be a multiple of the physical block size. This leads to space inefficiency due to internal fragmentation, since file lengths are often not integer multiples of block size, and thus the last block of a file may remain partially empty. This will create <b>slack</b> <b>space.</b> Some newer file systems, such as Btrfs and FreeBSD UFS2, attempt to solve this through techniques called block suballocation and tail merging.

In this paper, we study the problem of spanners with slack: e. g., can we find sparse spanners where we are allowed to incur an arbitrarily large distortion on a small constant fraction of the distances, but are then required to incur only a constant (independent of n) distortion on the remaining distances? We answer this question in the affirmative, thus complementing similar recent results on embeddings with <b>slack</b> into ℓp <b>spaces.</b> For instance, we show that if we ignore an ɛ fraction of the distances, we can get spanners with O(n) edgesand O(log 1) distortion for the remaining distances. ɛ We also show how to obtain sparse and low-weight spanners with slack from existing constructions of conventional spanners, and these techniques allow us to also obtain the best known results for distance oracles and distance labelings with slack.

50|$|The primary {{benefit of}} memory mapping a file is {{increasing}} I/O performance, especially when used on large files.

Firstly, a system call is orders of magnitude slower than a simple change to a program's local memory. Secondly, in most operating systems the memory region mapped actually is the kernel's page cache (file cache), meaning that no copies need to be created in user space.|$|E

50|$|This {{results in}} unused space when a file {{is not an}} exact {{multiple}} of the allocation unit, {{sometimes referred to as}} <b>slack</b> <b>space.</b> For a 512-byte allocation, the average unused space is 256 bytes. For 64 KB clusters, the average unused space is 32 KB. The size of the allocation unit is chosen when the file system is created. Choosing the allocation size based on the average size of the files expected to be in the file system can minimize the amount of unusable space. Frequently the default allocation may provide reasonable usage. Choosing an allocation size that is too small results in excessive overhead if the file system will contain mostly very large files.File system fragmentation occurs when unused space or single files are not contiguous. As a file system is used, files are created, modified and deleted. When a file is created the file system allocates space for the data. Some file systems permit or require specifying an initial space allocation and subsequent incremental allocations as the file grows. As files are deleted the space they were allocated eventually is considered available for use by other files. This creates alternating used and unused areas of various sizes. This is free space fragmentation. When a file is created and there is not an area of contiguous space available for its initial allocation the space must be assigned in fragments. When a file is modified such that it becomes larger it may exceed the space initially allocated to it, another allocation must be assigned elsewhere and the file becomes fragmented.|$|E
40|$|The maximum {{turbidity}} zone (MTZ) of the Gironde Estuary is a site {{of important}} mineralization of particulate organic nitrogen. Moreover, this MTZ is characterized by intense cycles of settling and resuspension of anoxic fluid mud at both tidal and neap-spring time-scales. In the upper layer of the fluid mud, which was deposited at tidal slack and eroded during each ebb and flood, a denitrification rate of up to 65 µmol l - 1 h - 1 was measured during the transient period of settling. High concentrations of NO - 2 (up to 13 µM), and N 2 O (up to 1500 nM) were observed in this layer at tidal slack, either due to an incomplete nitrification at low oxygen concentrations or to high denitrification activity. This suggests that deposition and erosion of the upper fluid mud at the tidal time-scale could be {{an important source of}} N 2 O for the estuarine overlying waters. The deepest layer of the fluid mud was more turbid, NO 3 - depleted and remained stable throughout tidal cycles, during several days. In this layer, ammonification was responsible for an increase of NH + 4. Most probable number (MPN) counts of ammonium oxidizing bacteria in turbid water and fluid mud revealed that they were closely associated with particles, whereas potential nitrification rates were rather constant (10 - 14 µmol l - 1 h - 1) irrespective of the suspended matter concentrations. In the MTZ of the Gironde, nitrogen behaves like in activated sludge reactors, with oxic/anoxic oscillations occurring at the tidal time scale. Nitrification takes place in the oxic water column and denitrification in the anoxic fluid mud. However at the whole estuarine scale the loss of particulate nitrogen and the gain of total dissolved inorganic nitrogen are in the same order of magnitude, which suggests that the net loss of nitrogen from the system is rather limited. This seems {{due to the fact that}} high denitrification rates are limited both in time (tidal <b>slacks)</b> and <b>space</b> (upper layers of fluid mud). However, our study emphasises the importance of settling/erosion transition periods on the nitrogen dynamics in estuarine maximum turbidity zones...|$|R

40|$|The Log-structured File System (LFS) {{transforms}} random {{writes to}} a huge sequential one to provide superior write performance on storage devices. However, LFS inherently suffers from overhead incurred by cleaning segments. Specifically, when file system utilization is high and the system is busy, write performance of LFS degenerates significantly due to high cleaning cost. Also, in the newer flash memory based SSD storage devices, cleaning leads to reduced SSD lifetime as it incurs more writes. In this paper, we propose an enhancement to the original LFS to alleviate the performance degeneration due to cleaning when the system is busy. The new scheme, which we call <b>Slack</b> <b>Space</b> Recycling (SSR), allows LFS to delay on-demand cleaning during busy hours such that cleaning may be done when the load is much lighter. Specifically, it writes modified data directly to invalid areas (<b>slack</b> <b>space)</b> of used segments instead of cleaning on-demand, pushing back cleaning for later.

Organizational context (work environment) is {{a significant factor in}} influencing outcomes; however, the nature of the mechanisms are relatively unknown. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess how organizational context moderates the effect of research use and pain outcomes in hospitalized children. Methods A cross-sectional survey was undertaken with 779 nurses in 32 patient care units in 8 Canadian pediatric hospitals, following implementation of a multifaceted knowledge translation intervention, Evidence-based Practice for Improving Quality (EPIQ). The influence of organizational context was assessed in relation to pain process (assessment and management) and clinical (pain intensity) outcomes. Organizational context was measured using the Alberta Context Tool that includes: leadership, culture, evaluation, social capital, informal interactions, formal interactions, structural and electronic resources, and organizational slack (staff, space, and time). Marginal modeling estimated the effects of instrumental research use (direct use of research knowledge) and conceptual research use (indirect use of research knowledge) on pain outcomes while examining the effects of context. Results Six of the 10 organizational context factors (culture, social capital, informal interactions, resources, and organizational slack [space and time]) significantly moderated the effect of instrumental research use on pain assessment; four factors (culture, social capital, resources and organizational slack time) moderated the effect of conceptual research use and pain assessment. Only two factors (evaluation and formal interactions) moderated the effect of instrumental research use on pain management.

Whilst a range of tools exists to support designers once a system has been specified there are few if any tools available to assist in system-level specification. Our aim is to provide a tool that is not only capable of selecting the most appropriate processor cores required to meet performance deadlines, but also cost and energy criteria as well. Given an existing software application, our tool will select appropriate (possibly heterogeneous) processor cores from a design library; allocate the various software functions to each processor; and provide a static task execution schedule. Point-to-point communication links are used. Both their cost and energy requirements are also accounted for. Total system cost and energy requirements are hence provided. In cases where a solution 2 ̆ 7 s performance exceeds the performance deadline, the tool will use the available <b>slack</b> <b>space</b> to stretch the execution and reduce the operating voltage.

40|$|Industrial {{structures}} such as blast furnaces, oil refineries, gravel crushers etc. {{are often}} beautiful and fascinating. Furthermore, they exemplify certain formal and organizational characteristics which could be incorporated into architectural design. In the 1920 's Le Corbusier and his contemporaries refereed to industrial structures, American grain silos in particular {{as a symbol of}} their Positivist faith in rationalism and anticipation of a Techno - Utopia. However, the world has changed in the last 60 years. Contemporary architecture is struggling to move beyond this Positivistic utopian vision and create a built environment which is more humane, user friendly and accommodating of idiosyncrasy and diversity. This thesis will examine four characteristics exemplified by industrial structures which could inform such an architecture. Industrial structures are heterotopically ordered complex assemblages of autonomous components. Discrete, clearly defined spaces within them are displaced so as to allow residual or <b>slack</b> <b>space</b> in between. The exposed steel frame work creates a sense of transparency and blurs the edge between inside and out. The purely utilitarian lack of artifice creates an honest and legible tectonic expression. These four characteristics cannot be applied superficially as an end in themselves. They should evolve out of the design process. Industrial structures are organized according to strict functional, utilitarian and economic criteria. It might be possible to archive these characteristics in architecture by following the same functional methodology. However, this is difficult in architecture because not only are the functional requirements obscure and complex but there is often little correlation between form and function. In architecture, the experiential as well as the technical qualities of a building must be considered. Helmut Schulitz's three C's context, construction method and content, defines a broad categorization of functional criteria which can influence the form of a building. However, no matter how broadly defined, a purely rational, functional design approach is insufficient to create architecture. Some degree of formal compositional order is unavoidable. To illustrate the incorporation of these characteristics into architecture, I have designed a community center to be located on the Boston State Hospital site at Franklin park. This design attempts to follow a heterotopic functional methodology based on Helmut Schulitz's Three C's categorization. The various activities of the center are organized around a plaza. The plaza is open to the southwest and commands a view of the field below and the blue hills in the distance. In summation, this thesis proposes four characteristics discernible in industrial structures which could inform a more diverse and humane architecture. It then proposes how these characteristics can be achieved by following a functional design methodology. This approach is illustrated with the design of a community center located on the Boston State Hospital Site. by Damon Strub. Thesis (M.
