40|$|Abstract. The {{resonant}} frequency of flexural vibrations for an {{atomic force microscope}} (AFM) cantilever has been investigated using the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. The results show that for flexural vibration the frequency is sensitive to the contact position, the first frequency is sensitive only to the lower contact stiffness, but high order modes are sensitive in a larger range of contact stiffness. By increasing the height H, for a limited range of contact stiffness the sensitivity to the contact stiffness increases. This <b>sensitivity</b> <b>controls</b> the image contrast, or image quality. Furthermore, by increasing the angle between the cantilever and sample surface, the frequency decreases...|$|R

40|$|The {{solution}} of optimal control problems through the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation offers guaranteed satisfaction {{of both the}} necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality. However, finding an exact solution to the HJB equation is a near impossible task for many optimal control problems. This thesis presents an approximation method for solving finite-horizon optimal control problems involving nonlinear dynamical systems. The method uses finite-order approximations of the partial derivatives of the cost-to-go function, and successive higher-order differentiations of the HJB equation. Natural byproducts of the proposed method provide <b>sensitivities</b> of the <b>controls</b> {{to changes in the}} initial states, which can be used to approximate the solution to neighboring optimal control problems. For highly nonlinear problems, the method is modified to calculate <b>control</b> <b>sensitivities</b> about a nominal trajectory.

5000|$|Among the {{advantages}} of synth guitars are that the musician can play either the guitar or the synthesizer alone, or blend the timbres of the both together in any ratio. Many models {{can be used with}} almost any guitar, {{with the addition of a}} hexaphonic pickup. In the early systems, there was a detectable latency, especially at lower pitches, between playing a note on the guitar and the note's sounding on the synthesizer, but this was remedied in 2000s-era instruments.While this type is also somewhat prone to note-tracking glitches, the problem can be overcome by adjusting the <b>sensitivity</b> <b>controls</b> of the pickup or converter [...] - [...] and by playing more precisely. Another possible disadvantage is that not all of the variable performance parameters available on a synthesizer can be actuated from a guitar; a synth guitar lacks assignable controls to open a filter in real-time, for example. Nevertheless, contemporary synth-guitar designs often include an expression pedal for such purposes.|$|R
