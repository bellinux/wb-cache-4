5|$|Desert <b>Strike</b> <b>is</b> a shoot 'em up game {{in which}} the player pilots an AH-64 Apache helicopter. The game is less frantic than typical shoot 'em ups, with the {{addition}} of greater strategic elements. The action takes place on open, multi-directional scrolling levels viewed from an isometric perspective. The player views the action from outside the helicopter, rather than from within the cockpit.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific {{angelshark}} {{is primarily}} a visual hunter; experiments in nature show that they strike at fish-shaped targets without any electrical, chemical, vibrational, or behavioral cues. At night, they are guided by the bioluminescence of planktonic dinoflagellates and ostracods disturbed by moving prey. This species' visual system is attuned to the wavelengths of light emitted by these planktonic organisms, showing the importance of night hunting. Pacific angelsharks {{are more likely to}} strike at prey approaching from the front. It usually waits until the prey approaches to , as its attack is less accurate beyond this distance. The <b>strike</b> <b>is</b> a stereotyped behavior in which the shark presses the forward lobes of its pectoral fins against the bottom and thrusts its head upwards at up to a 90° angle. Its mouth forms a tube when opened, creating a suction force, while its jaws protude forward to secure the prey between sharp teeth. During the strike, the eyes roll backward into the head for protection. The <b>strike</b> <b>is</b> often completed in under a tenth of a second.|$|E
5|$|After {{a failed}} {{attempt at a}} school field trip, Edna Krabappel calls an {{emergency}} strike {{on behalf of the}} Teachers' Union of Springfield Elementary, to protest against Principal Skinner's miserly spending on the school. The school is closed and students cope in their own ways. The parents of Springfield attempt to act as substitute teachers until the <b>strike</b> <b>is</b> over but this is deemed unsuccessful. Eventually, the two sides are forced into talking and think of a resolution: using the school to house prisoners from the overcrowded prison system, thus generating money and returning the school to normal.|$|E

5000|$|... (Internet <b>strike)</b> <b>was</b> a {{new concept}} in country like Nepal, {{and this is the}} first time in the history of Nepal that [...] "Internet Strike" [...] has taken place.

50|$|For those {{sports that}} allow {{striking}} from the mounted position, such as mixed martial arts, {{the most common}} <b>strikes</b> <b>are</b> punches to the face and head. Elbow <b>strikes</b> <b>are</b> also commonly used, and knee <b>strikes</b> <b>are</b> sometimes seen. In addition to punching the head, strikes to the ribs and chest can also be difficult to defend and thus effective.|$|R
5|$|Jungle <b>Strike</b> <b>is</b> {{the sequel}} to , a similar game which parodied the Gulf War and which was {{released}} in 1992. Desert Strike arose from a failed attempt at a flight simulator and was inspired by Matchbox toys and Choplifter. Central to the game's concept were nonlinear gameplay and the eschewing of power-ups and bosses. With {{the success of the}} original title, producer Scott Berfield, game director John Manley and associate producer Tony Barnes were tasked with creating the sequel. Jungle Strike retained the core mechanics of its predecessor, with the addition of various vehicles and settings. Desert Strike was at the time Electronic Arts' highest selling video game and maintained a high sales chart position as Jungle Strike was released in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear <b>Strike</b> <b>is</b> a helicopter-based game, with {{strategy}} elements {{added to}} the action gameplay. The plot concerns an elite special force - the player's allies - pursuing a nuclear-armed rogue spy through a fictionalised Asian setting. It retained the earlier game's engine but added several modifications to improve graphical performance and make the game more accessible. The game features 15 playable vehicles, a large increase from previous games. In addition to the main fictionalised Apache, there are secondary helicopters, jets, armour and a hovercraft. The player also commands ground troops in occasional real-time strategy sections.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear <b>Strike</b> <b>is</b> a helicopter-based shooter {{game with}} a blend of both {{strategy}} and action, which the player views from outside the helicopter from an overhead perspective. It is similar to previous games in the series, but has 15 playable vehicles, a larger number than any of its predecessors. The main helicopter is a fictional Super Apache, with additional helicopters including the Cobra and other Hueys. Playable jets include the Harrier Jump Jet and a fictional V/STOL version of the A-10 Thunderbolt II. The player can use surface vehicles including the M1 Abrams tank, Bradley armoured vehicle, the Multiple Launch Rocket System and a PACV hovercraft.|$|E

50|$|Target {{analysis}} {{could go}} in either place. If air or missile <b>strikes</b> <b>are</b> delivered after the SR team leaves the AO, the SR aspect is intelligence, but if the <b>strikes</b> <b>are</b> to be delivered and possibly corrected and evaluated while the SR team is present, the SR mission is fires-related.|$|R
5|$|Soviet <b>Strike</b> <b>is</b> set {{after the}} {{disintegration}} of the Soviet Union, and takes place in a fictionalised Russia, Eastern Europe and around the Caspian Sea. The player pilots an Apache helicopter and battles with the forces of Shadowman, a renegade ex-Communist figure. Like its predecessors, the game features shooting action mixed with strategic management of fuel and ammunition, but has more authentic 3D graphics, as well as a modified overhead - as opposed to isometric - perspective. The game also features a more realistic enemy artificial intelligence and environment. Critics received the game positively, praising the graphics and full motion video, while commentary on the gameplay and difficulty was more mixed.|$|E
5|$|Japanese temple bells are struck {{externally}} {{with either}} a hammer or a suspended beam rather than with an internal clapper. The sound of the bell {{is made up of}} three parts. First is the atari, the impact of the strike. A well-made bell should produce a clean, clear tone. The initial sound of the <b>strike</b> <b>is</b> immediately followed by the prolonged oshi, the reverberation that continues to sound after the bell is struck. This is higher in pitch and is a low rumble with a sorrowful air, rich in harmonics; it lasts for up to ten seconds. Finally comes the okuri or decay, the resonance that is heard as the vibration of the bell dies away, which can last up to a minute. There are also continuous harmonic overtones heard throughout the tolling of the bell. These multiple tones create a complex pitch profile.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns sends hired goons to the Simpson {{house in}} order to take Homer back to Mr. Burns' Manor to negotiate. While Mr. Burns is setting the agenda for the discussion, Homer is struck by the urgent need to use the rest room. Homer asks Mr. Burns where the rest room is and {{immediately}} leaves, leading Mr. Burns to conclude that Homer is a tough negotiator who is unwilling to even hear him out. At a later union meeting, Homer tries to resign, tired of meeting with Mr. Burns. The union misunderstands his frustration, and the members nearly unanimously decide to strike. Mr. Burns is undeterred by the strike and tries several methods of breaking it up, but fails. On an edition of Kent Brockman's talk show Smartline, Mr. Burns is allowed an opening tirade and he threatens dire events if the <b>strike</b> <b>is</b> not concluded.|$|E
25|$|The {{significance}} of the hunger <b>strike</b> <b>was</b> the prisoners' aim of being considered political prisoners as opposed to criminals.

50|$|The {{principal}} issue, {{which was}} not resolved during the <b>strike,</b> <b>was</b> Korail's replacement of regular long-term positions with short-term contract positions.

5|$|Rebecca Lansing, a TriOptimum {{counter-terrorism}} consultant, contacts {{the player}} and claims that Citadel Station's mining laser is being powered up to attack Earth. SHODAN's {{plan is to}} destroy all major cities on the planet, {{in a bid to}} become a kind of god. Rebecca says that a certain crew member knows how to deactivate the laser, and promises to destroy the records of the hacker's incriminating exchange with Diego if the <b>strike</b> <b>is</b> stopped. With information gleaned from log discs, the hacker destroys the laser by firing it into Citadel Station's own shields. Foiled by the hacker's work, SHODAN prepares to seed Earth with a mutagenic virus—the same one responsible for turning the station's crew into mutants. The hacker, while attempting to jettison the chambers used to cultivate the virus, confronts and defeats Diego, who has been transformed into a powerful cyborg by SHODAN. Next, SHODAN begins an attempt to upload itself into Earth's computer networks. Following Rebecca's advice, the hacker prevents the download's completion by destroying the four antennas that SHODAN is using to send data.|$|E

25|$|Employer {{reactions}} to whipsaw strikes vary widely. In some countries which ban worker strikes, the whipsaw <b>strike</b> <b>is</b> illegal and employers {{are able to}} work with government law enforcement officials to end its use. In countries where the whipsaw <b>strike</b> <b>is</b> permitted, employers often counter this form of strike by locking out all employees who work for the employer association and using strikebreakers to provide temporary or permanent replacements.|$|E

25|$|The <b>strike</b> <b>is</b> {{constantly}} {{mentioned in}} David Peace's book GB84, {{in which the}} older characters often mention the 1926 strike to draw parallels with the long miners' strike of 1984-5.|$|E

25|$|The Salad Bowl <b>strike</b> <b>was</b> {{a series}} of strikes, mass pickets, boycotts and {{secondary}} boycotts that began on August 23, 1970 {{and led to the}} largest farm worker strike in U.S. history. The <b>strike</b> <b>was</b> led by the United Farm Workers against the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. The Salad Bowl <b>strike</b> <b>was</b> only in part a jurisdictional strike, for many of the actions taken during the event <b>were</b> not <b>strikes.</b> The strike led directly to the passage of the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act in 1975.|$|R
50|$|The {{end of the}} <b>strike</b> <b>was</b> {{not the end of}} the royalty issue, however.

25|$|In {{the event}} that all ten pins are felled by any one player in a single box, {{by no more than}} two throws (just as in tenpins) bonuses are awarded for a strike or spare. A <b>strike</b> <b>is</b> {{achieved}} with just the first delivery downing all ten pins, with a spare needing two throws, again just as in the tenpin sport. If all ten pins are felled by rolling all three balls in a box, the result is a Ten or ten-box, usually marked by an X (as in the Roman numeral for ten) but no additional points are awarded. (In tenpin bowling, a <b>strike</b> <b>is</b> often scored with an X).|$|E
25|$|In {{the tenth}} box, play is similar, except that a player scoring a <b>strike</b> <b>is</b> granted two {{additional}} balls, scoring a spare earns one additional ball. Three balls are rolled in the tenth box regardless.|$|E
25|$|The {{right to}} <b>strike</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the}} {{essential}} means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their economic and social interests. The Committee considers that this basic right is not really guaranteed when a worker who exercises it legally {{runs the risk of}} seeing his or her job taken up permanently by another worker, just as legally. The Committee considers that, if a <b>strike</b> <b>is</b> otherwise legal, the use of labour drawn from outside the undertaking to replace strikers for an indeterminate period entails a risk of derogation from the right to strike which may affect the free exercise of trade union rights.|$|E
