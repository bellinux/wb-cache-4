5|$|Aghartas 1976 North American release had {{different}} artwork designed by John Berg, the art director from Davis' U.S. label, Columbia Records. In its liner notes, an inscription said the record should be listened {{to at the}} highest possible volume, and the trumpeter was credited for the arrangements. After it was released, Macero received a complaint from Columbia's accounting department about Davis being compensated $2,500 per arrangement, arguing {{that none of the}} music <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it had been arranged.|$|E

25|$|Ström {{headed off}} towards Åby to inform {{them of the}} {{accident}} and met Mr. Andersson, a track walker. From a nearby house, Andersson called Åby and notified them of the accident. Track walker Eriksson arrived from his house east of the accident site. His wife had lowered the boom barrier at the railway crossing and was standing {{and waiting for the}} train when she thought it <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the train had stopped, so Eriksson quickly went {{to the site of the}} derailment. Once he saw that the telegraph poles were aslant, he knew that something serious had occurred. Upon seeing that the train had derailed, he hurried to Getå Halt to notify Krokek Station what had occurred.|$|E

25|$|Many {{accounts}} {{state that}} both men fired in near perfect unison. Some stated it <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> one shot had been fired. “One witness said {{it looked as}} if the guns were spitting fire at the same time.” Then, a number of shots followed, ranging between five and nine according to different testimonies. As reports tell of a total of five entry wounds in the two men, the minimum number of shots fired had to be five. The exchange occurred rapidly. Reid received a bullet to one leg. Reid fired two more rounds, one grazing Smith’s left arm and the other striking his left thigh above the knee and exiting the other side. Chambering his Winchester, Smith sent a bullet into Reid’s lower abdomen and groin. Reid fell face down upon the planking, severely wounded. It is not known if Smith remained standing or also had fallen.|$|E

500|$|Rolling Stone {{magazine}} reviewer Anthony DeCurtis {{wrote that}} Beyoncé <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she was [...] "having fun" [...] on the song, while Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{of the online}} music guide service AllMusic described Beyoncé's vocals as [...] "assured and sexy". Mark Anthony Neal of the international webzine PopMatters, regarded [...] "Baby Boy" [...] {{as one of the}} [...] "high-profile collaborations" [...] on Dangerously in Love. Lisa Verrico of the daily British newspaper The Times described the song a [...] "Latino-tinged collaboration ... Paul does a reggae rap in the middle, but it's when he chats while Beyoncé half raps that the pair have real chemistry". Yancey Strickler of the Flak magazine wrote that [...] "'Baby Boys diwali stutter is enhanced by Sean Paul's dancehall monotone".|$|E

500|$|Nelson and {{the band}} {{encountered}} problems in producing {{some aspects of the}} song. According to Champion, [...] "...it was really difficult to record, because it worked at about five or six different tempos. It was a tough choice of choosing which tempo to play, because sometimes it sounded too rushed, and sometimes it <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it was dragging..." [...] The band was trying to get the right tempo, according to Nelson, [...] "because a beat either side of the tempo we picked didn't have the same groove". To improve the song, they recorded this part live and Buckland overdubbed his guitar. They recorded it two or three times until Nelson {{and the band}} were happy at the output. The backing vocals were recorded in the control room of Quadrangle.|$|E
500|$|... "So Appalled" [...] {{received}} mostly favorable {{reviews from}} contemporary critics. [...] David Browne of Time {{wrote that he}} felt that the track was [...] "built on rumbling tanks of pianos and strings" [...] and that it <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> West was [...] "marching into the apocalypse." [...] David Amidon of PopMatters compared the production to West's album Late Registration which found West [...] "inviting his friend Jon Brion to impart slices of film scoring to the odds and ends of his tracks". He commented that much like every song on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, the song [...] "contains an underscore as ambitious as the beats upfront", concluding that tracks [...] "Hell of a Life" [...] and [...] "So Appalled" [...] alone [...] "carry enough auditory sugar to make listening to this album on any regular sort of listening device almost a fool's errand." ...|$|E
500|$|Rather than {{remaining}} {{limited to}} trying to convince traditional downmarket male buyers to switch to Honda from other brands with the macho approach of most motorcycle advertising at the time, Honda broke new ground. The ad campaign sought to improve the image of motorcycling in general and expand the overall size of the motorcycle market by attracting new riders. In a stroke of good fortune for Honda, Brian Wilson and Mike Love composed the 1964 song [...] "Little Honda", extolling the joys of riding the Honda 50, and even inviting the listener to visit their local Honda dealership, in language that <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{it could have been}} written, or at least paid for, by Honda's advertising copywriters, yet it was not a commercial jingle. The song was released by The Hondells in 1964, followed by the release of the original recording by The Beach Boys. In 1965 The Hondells released [...] "You Meet the Nicest People on a Honda", another song promoting the Super Cub, which was actually used in Honda's TV spots, as a B side to their version of [...] "Sea Cruise." ...|$|E

500|$|The two {{original}} songs sung by New Directions {{were rated}} from excellent to abysmal. Benigno gave each song a [...] "B+"; {{he called the}} duet, [...] "Pretending", [...] "lovely". The nicest thing Kubicek wrote {{of it was that}} it <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the lyrics had been [...] "written by a lovesick teenage boy", and he called [...] "Light Up the World" [...] a [...] "trainwreck". Berk was even harsher: [...] "When the show has carte blanche access to every amazing song in the history of popular music, there's something terribly humiliating about watching the kids sing this shit tune as their finale, and do so with such desperate conviction." [...] Gonzalez gave [...] "Light Up the World" [...] a [...] "B+", but said it sounded a [...] "bit too much" [...] like [...] "Loser Like Me", and while Benigno thought it had a better melody than [...] "Loser" [...] and also made [...] "much better use of the Gleeks as a whole", he criticized the chorus for its similarity to [...] "Let It Rock" [...] by Kevin Rudolf. Semigran said it was an [...] "uplifting, if not rather lackluster pop song", yet Hankinson called it his favorite number in the episode.|$|E
500|$|... "Heaven" [...] is a mournful, {{understated}} slow-tempo ballad with {{gospel and}} pop overtones. It is instrumentally {{complete with a}} hymn-like simple piano. According to the sheet music published on the website Musicnotes.com, it is composed using time signature of common time in the key of A Major with a slow tempo of 52 beats per minute. Beyoncé's vocals range from the low note of C#3 to the higher note of E5. It contains the sequence of A–C#m–F#m–C#m as its chord progression. Chris Bosman from Consequence of Sound described the song as a blend of [...] "cinematic reach of modern Top 40 pop with the patience and melancholy of post-808s & Heartbreaks [...] hip-hop". Paste reviewer Philip Cosores noted how the song <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it [...] "work together" [...] with other Boots-produced material on the album, including [...] "Blue" [...] and [...] "Haunted". A writer from Fuse, opined that the song sounded slightly like a {{second part of the}} singer's own ballad [...] "Halo" [...] (2008). Similarly, Mike Wass from the website Idolator called it [...] "an edgy, indie sister" [...] of [...] "Halo" [...] while Lindsey Weber from Vulture.com deemed it an [...] "answer to" [...] that song. Variety journalist Andrew Barker likened the song to Rihanna's [...] "Stay" [...] (2012) while adding that it succeeded in [...] "improving on it in every way".|$|E
500|$|In {{comparison}} to previous albums, which were largely driven by observational commentary on matters pertaining to social welfare, Graduation is more introspective {{in nature and}} addresses personal themes. West stated {{that he wanted to}} make inspirational music and placed more focus on individual perspective and experience that listeners could connect with in an attempt to create [...] "people's theme songs". Dismayed that the messages behind his complex lyricism were frequently lost on listeners and didn't carry well during live performances, West made an attempt to simplify his lyrics and use more skeletal rhyme schemes for more straightforward verses while concentrating on speaking volumes with sparser wording on Graduation. Having committed a significant amount of time towards elevating his storytelling abilities by listening to folk musicians, West manages to form a lyrical narrative within nearly every song on the album. West dedicated a majority of the album towards conducting an analysis himself and conveying his ambivalent outlook on his newfound wealth and fame. As such, West's subversive songwriting fluctuates between playful self-aggrandizement and critical self-doubt. While confident, extroverted and celebratory at face value, many songs contained on Graduation were thematically distanced and retained melancholic subtext. Some music critics remarked that compounded with West's urgent, emotive rapping style, the record <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he were experiencing an existential crisis.|$|E

2500|$|Company {{headquarters}} in Atlanta began receiving letters and telephone calls expressing anger or deep disappointment.

Another letter asked for his autograph, as the signature of [...] "one of the dumbest executives in American business history" [...] would likely become valuable in the future. The company hotline, 1-800-GET-COKE, received over 1,500 calls a day compared to around 400 before the change.

2500|$|However, {{the crew}} was alarmed by the thunder-like sound of the waves {{slamming}} against her flat bottom. Reed and Vogak wrote that at times it <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the ship had hit a hard rock. Around 10 a.m. {{of the next day}} the hull cracked, the space between inner and outer bottoms was flooded, and Vogak rushed his ship to a safe anchorage in Ferrol. The divers discovered a five-meter-long dent and numerous cracks in the fore segment of the hull which were ultimately blamed on waves. Popov concurred and admitted his failure [...] "to foresee the effects of shallow draft". He wrote that the damage had dual mechanism: first, when the flat pontoon pitched above the waves, gravity subjected it to an enormous stress, bending the whole structure down. Next, as it plummeted down, the flat bottom hit water head-on, rupturing the rivets and tearing off the crossbeams. Reed noted that the radial framing pattern chosen by the designers resulted in a strong center section and inadequately weak extremities, and that any experienced shipbuilder should have discovered this weakness in advance.|$|E
2500|$|Although Cheap Thrills <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it {{consisted}} of concert recordings, like on [...] "Combination of the Two" [...] and [...] "I Need a Man to Love", only [...] "Ball and Chain" [...] was actually recorded {{in front of a}} paying audience; the rest of the tracks were studio recordings. The album had a raw quality, including the sound of a drinking glass breaking and the broken shards being swept away during the song [...] "Turtle Blues". Cheap Thrills produced very popular hits with [...] "Piece of My Heart" [...] and [...] "Summertime". Together with the premiere of the documentary film Monterey Pop at New York's Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts on December 26, 1968, the album launched Joplin's successful, albeit short, musical career. Cheap Thrills reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 album chart eight weeks after its release, remaining for eight (nonconsecutive) weeks. The album was certified gold at release and sold over a million copies in the first month of its release. The lead single from the album, [...] "Piece of My Heart", reached No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the fall of 1968.|$|E
