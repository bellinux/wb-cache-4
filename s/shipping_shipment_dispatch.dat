40|$|A {{dispatching}} {{schedule is}} to be developed for a supplier providing parts to a manufacturer, given the cumulative production at the supplier and the cumulative demand at the manufacturer. This paper develops dispatching strategies that combine regular (e. g. truck of ship) and express (e. g. air) shipments, and compares these strategies {{as a function of}} the total inventory in the system (i. e. cumulative production minus cumulative demand). In most cases, one of five basic strategies should provide a cost that is close to optimal. Company A is the exclusive supplier of a part used by Company B. To satisfy all demand, the cumulative production at Company A, P(t), must always equal or exceed the cumulative demand at Company B, D(t). Parts are shipped by either of two modes: a regular mode, at a cost of A per shipment with a travel time of [tau]; or an express mode, at a cost of B + bQe (where Qe equals the shipment size) with a travel time of 0. Given P(t), D(t), A, [tau], B, and b, determine a <b>shipment</b> <b>dispatch</b> schedule that minimizes total transportation cost. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we present two models for joint stock {{replenishment}} and shipment consolidation decisions which {{arise in the}} context of vendor managed inventory. Stock replenishment from suppliers or shipment to customers each incurs a lump-sum cost to the vendor. We assume the vendor uses the reorder point, lot-size policy to replenish stock and one of two schemes to dispatch shipment: the time-based and quantity-based consolidation schemes. Under the time-based (quantity-based) scheme, a <b>shipment</b> is <b>dispatched</b> periodically (when a certain quantity of outstanding demand is accumulated). The basic finding is that the quantity-based scheme can outperform the time-based counterpart while the reverse never occurs...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the reorganization of}} freight transportation {{in the city of}} Venice, Italy. Most of the freight arrives from the mainland by trucks, but must be carried to the final customers by boats, through a network of small canals. The existence of constraints, related to the widths and clearances of the canals, makes it necessary to use boats of different sizes and capacities. In this paper, we analyze the transshipment operations from trucks to boats, and the organization of the boat distribution. Currently, the lack of an adequate terminal facility prevents items offloaded from land vehicles from being stored and sorted prior to being loaded on boats. As a result, items are transshipped directly from trucks to boats. This form of operation generates delays for the vehicles, resulting in very long queues, and inefficient boat <b>shipments.</b> Consequently, <b>dispatched</b> boats are insufficiently loaded with deliveries to be scattered throughout the city, creating an inefficient use of [...] ...|$|R

2500|$|A {{catamaran}} (...) (informally, a [...] "cat") is a multi-hulled watercraft featuring {{two parallel}} hulls of equal size. It is a geometry-stabilized craft, deriving its stability from its wide beam, {{rather than from}} a ballasted keel as with a monohull sailboat. [...] Catamaran is a Tamil word Kattumaram (கட்டுமரம்) - logs tied together - [...] which is used from ancient times to <b>ship</b> heavy <b>shipment</b> over shallow water bodies. Hundred of elephant fleets were shipped by Tamil kings with Catamaran to conquer East Asian countries in 10th century BC. Catamaran is hull free and therefore lighter than a monohull, catamarans often have a shallower draft (draught) than comparably-sized monohulls. The two hulls combined also often have a smaller hydrodynamic resistance than comparable monohulls, requiring less propulsive power from either sails or motors. The catamaran's wider stance on the water can reduce both heeling and wave-induced motion, as compared with a monohull, and can give reduced wakes.|$|R

30|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been {{significant}} interest {{in the development of}} connectivity indicators for ports. For short sea shipping, especially in Europe, Roll-on Roll-off (RoRo) shipping is almost equally important as container shipping. In contrast with container <b>shipping,</b> RoRo <b>shipments</b> are primarily direct, thus the measurement of its connectivity requires a different methodology. In this paper, we present a methodology for measuring the RoRo connectivity of ports and illustrate its use through an application to European RoRo shipping. We apply the methodology on data collected from 23 different RoRo shipping service providers concerning 620 unique routes connecting 148 ports. We characterize the connectivity of the ports in our sample and analyze the results. We show that in terms of RoRo connectivity, neither the number of links nor the link quality (frequency, number of competing providers, minimum number of indirect stops) strictly dominate the results of our proposed indicator. The highest ranking ports combine link quality and number. Finally, we highlight promising areas for future research based on the insights obtained.|$|R
