40|$|Abstract: The {{capability}} to withstand non-contact underwater explosions (UNDEX) {{is an important}} aspect to be emphasized {{in the design of}} modern warships, and shock testing is one of the efficient methods to qualify the ability. A brief history on the research of shock testing of naval shipboard equipment as well as major means in evaluating anti-shock performance of warship equipment is introduced first in this paper. Three prevailing shock test methods: UNDEX testing, virtual shock trial and land-based test with <b>shock</b> test <b>machines</b> are presented with the focus on the advances in <b>shock</b> test <b>machines</b> in US and Europe. Comparison of current shock testing facilities is also given. Moreover, some new concepts of <b>shock</b> test <b>machines</b> are reviewed as well, and three major directions of the development of <b>shock</b> test <b>machines</b> are concluded. The first trend is that <b>shock</b> testing <b>machines</b> are required to generate positive and negative shock pulse to simulate real UNDEX environment made up of shock wave followed by bubble pulse and structural whipping. The second is that <b>shock</b> test <b>machines</b> can test heavy equipments, and the last is that shock pulses can be controlled and customized conveniently. ...|$|R

This was a base on the low-emission gas, high-energy efficiency, permanence and possible with co-generation. Especially, transportation system has been restricted to system’s total weight. Light weight of a transportation system offers to increase performance. By using light weight in a transportation system, it gives another benefit that reduced oil consumption, improved fuel efficiency and increased Market-value.

Conventional bipolar plate material was used to graphite. Graphite has been very weak at external <b>shock.</b> <b>Machining</b> process is not easy, and the main problem is that the graphite material supplied by oxidizing and reducing agent composition of the gas leak comes. Thus, the manufacturing cost is increased by this reason. This study will be tried to bipolar plate material replacement from graphite materials to metallic material.

50|$|Shock testing {{typically}} {{falls into}} two categories, classical shock testing and pyroshock or ballistic shock testing. Classical shock testing {{consists of the}} following shock impulses: half sine, haversine, sawtooth wave, and trapezoid. Pyroshock and ballistic shock tests are specialized and are not considered classical shocks. Classical shocks can be performed on Electro Dynamic (ED) Shakers, Free Fall Drop Tower or Pneumatic Shock Machines. A classical shock impulse is created when the <b>shock</b> <b>machine</b> table changes direction abruptly. This abrupt change in direction causes a rapid velocity change which creates the shock impulse.|$|E

Numbers of fish examined for various catagories of the study wares length-frequency, 495; aging by vertebrae, 407; length-weight relationship, 601; and food habits, 275. Fish were collected by use of an electric <b>shocking</b> <b>machine</b> generating 600 watts and 220 volts. Numbers of fish occurred as high as 150 per tenth mile of stream. Preferred habitats occurred in areas of coarse gravel and small rocks. Vertebrae dissected from the fish were used in age determination. Length-frequency {{proved to be a}} general correlation to the aging technique. Fish were difficult to sex by external observation except during the breeding season. Relationship between standard length and weight is described by the following formula: W = 4. 236 X 10 - 4 L 2 • 900 The coefficient of condition (K) increased with length up to 60 millimeters in standard length and decreased in length in fish ranging from 60 to 125 millimeters in standard length. The greatest variation in K occurred in fish below 50 millimeters in length. The factor for converting total length to standard length as determined from 601 specimens between 24 and 112 millimeters. standard length was 0. 812. The factor for converting standard length to total length for the same fish was 1. 232. The bulk of the diet consisted almost entirely of aquatic insects. Most of the aquatic insects were diptera. Ephemeroptera, plecoptera, and trichoptera were consumed in almost equal numbers. Food availability and preference were determined from bottom samples of the river.
