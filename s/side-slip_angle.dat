40|$|This {{internship}} {{report is}} part of a larger assignment which is an analysis of lateral string stability and the development of a controller design method with guaranteed lateral string stability. Lateral string stability is an issue when a look-ahead sensing method is used in combination with a vehicle-following control strategy. The coupling between vehicles enables errors to increase while they propagate upstream through a string of vehicles. Communicating desired yaw rate or lateral acceleration and use this information for controller design could be an option to achieved guaranteed lateral string stability. One of the applications of lateral control will be conducting maneuvers like merging or lane changes. During these maneuvers the <b>side-slip</b> <b>angles</b> of the tyres stay within the 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆einterval of linear tyre response, this means that <b>side-slip</b> <b>angles</b> of the tyres are within 0 : 5. On this interval the non-linear and linearized tyre model have the same linear response. This makes is possible to use a linearized vehicle model with linear tyres for the modeling of the lateral and yaw dynamics of the vehicle. This is validated using experimental data and it is shown that the response of the linearized vehicle model is almost equal to the actual vehicle response...|$|R

Most commercial <b>side-slip</b> <b>angle</b> sensor systems and estimation techniques rely on smooth terrain and high vehicle speeds, typically above 20 km/h, to provide accurate measurements.

First, the yaw dynamic models {{of both the}} tractor and trailer are derived considering the lateral forces and <b>side-slip</b> <b>angles.</b> In {{order to be able}} to calculate the side-slips precisely, the relaxation length approach is preferred. Since the obtained yaw dynamic models are nonlinear, a constrained nonlinear optimization problem is formulated for the parameter estimation. Second, the longitudinal dynamic model for the system is derived based-on the static and dynamic responses. The static model consist of two inputs, the hydrostat position and the diesel engine speed, and one output, the longitudinal speed of the system. Afterwards, a dynamic model is proposed to define the dynamic effect between the output of the static model and the actual longitudinal speed. Third, the mathematical models of the steering mechanisms both for the tractor and trailer are identified. Consequently, a complete nonlinear dynamic model for the tractor–trailer system is obtained.

This new kind of vehicle is equipped with two front steering wheels and two rear wheels; {{the front and rear}} suspension mechanisms allow the scooter to roll freely as a standard motorcycle.

Single-track vehicles are characterised by weakly damped modes of vibration (weave and wobble) and therefore this phenomenon is even more important. This article focuses {{on the study of}} both steady-state and transient properties of motorcycle and scooter tyres in the presence of very low and very high inflation pressures. The steady-state properties are defined as lateral forces (side-slip and camber forces) and yaw torques (self-aligning and twisting). The transient properties are described in terms of relaxation length, which represents the distance needed to reach a certain percentage of the steady-state value of the tyre force. Experimental tests are carried out on a specific rotating disk machine. Three sets of tyres are analysed.

40|$|The aim of an {{electronic}} {{stability control system}} in a passenger car is to assist the driver {{in order to avoid}} accidents by preventing unstable/uncontrollable behaviour of the vehicle. Most electronic stability control systems in cars of today are designed to minimize the difference between the measured yaw rate of the vehicle and the by the driver desired counterpart. This approach definitely affects the vehicle safety in a positive manner although the function and accuracy of the electronic stability control system can be extensively improved if the vehicle body <b>side-slip</b> <b>angle</b> is known. However, to measure the vehicle body <b>side-slip</b> <b>angle</b> is a complex task and requires expensive sensors why estimation of this angle is the only realistic option for use in production vehicles at this time. The objective of this work is to estimate the vehicle body <b>side-slip</b> <b>angle,</b> preferably without extending the sensor technology available in a modern vehicle. The estimation algorithm should be based on a linear model-based observer and validated against real vehicle test data. In this work a planar case is assumed, i. e. the road bank and slope angles are equal to zero. Furthermore, it is assumed that a linear vehicle model describes the vehicle dynamics with sufficient accuracy for this application. Since a linear vehicle model (especially a linear tire model) does not have the ability to perfectly describe the lateral dynamics of the vehicle an algorithm for continuously updating the cornering stiffness used in the tire model is developed. Furthermore, it is realized that a single observer tuned for a specific road surface friction does not produce an estimate of the vehicle body <b>side-slip</b> <b>angle</b> that is accurate enough on roads {{with a wide variety of}} surface friction. Therefore, the solution consists of three observers tuned for three different surfaces run in parallel, resulting in three estimates of the vehicle <b>side-slip</b> <b>angle.</b> Due to this the final component of the estimation algorithm is a system that estimates the current surface friction and based on this knowledge arbitrates between the three estimates produced by the observers in order to obtain the final estimate of the vehicle body <b>side-slip</b> <b>angle.</b> The estimation algorithm is validated against real test data presenting results that indicate that the algorithm works in a satisfactory way.

Crucial variables which govern the forces generated at the tyre-road interface are tyre <b>side-slip</b> <b>angle,</b> tyre longitudinal slip ratio and terrain pro le. Solutions to measure these variables exist for smooth hard roads but the solutions experience challenges on rough and o -road terrain. Digital Image Correlation {{is concerned with}} tracking the changes of a scene in a sequence of images or in images obtained from multiple viewpoints. These methods are frequently used in micro and nano-scale mechanical testing due to its ease of implementation and use {{as well as its}} non-contact approach. As a result these techniques are being implemented in many elds from material testing, physics, lm animations and engineering. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the applications of Digital Image Correlation in vehicle dynamics using cost e cient o -the-shelf digital cameras and lenses. The following three vehicle dynamic problems are investigated: The measurement of the vehicle <b>side-slip</b> <b>angle,</b> longitudinal slip-ratio of a pneumatic tyre and high delity terrain pro ling. The vehicle <b>side-slip</b> <b>angle</b> {{can be used as a}} measure of the vehicle stability and therefore be used to improve the e ectiveness of vehicle stability controllers. The tyre <b>side-slip</b> <b>angle</b> is also a vital measurement in characterising the lateral force characteristics of pneumatic tyres. A planar measuring method using Digital Image Correlation is shown to accurately measure the <b>side-slip</b> <b>angle.</b> The method is expanded by developing two additional algorithms which can measure all translational and rotational velocities. These methods are validated on both smooth surfaces and rough o -road terrain. A method is also implemented whereby the longitudinal slip ratio of a tyre can be measured using a single camera. Therefore, doing away with the conventional method of using three independent measurement systems. Features in the contact patch, encompassing both the tyre and the road, are tracked in a sequence of images. The features are classi ed into features lying on the tyre, road and outliers using a clustering algorithm. This enables the system to determine the tyre and road velocities from which the slip ratio is determined. High delity terrain pro ling is performed using a calibrated stereographic rig to obtain a three dimensional point cloud of the scene which is being viewed. The point cloud generated at one sample contains a grid of points encompassing a large area with points spaced both laterally and longitudinally. Overlapping point clouds are generated and joined using various registration techniques. The joined point clouds are sub-sampled to obtain a regularised grid of point containing a single point cloud of non overlapping points. The proposed techniques create new possibilities in the eld of vehicle dynamics. Enabling the <b>side-slip</b> <b>angle</b> to be measured in rough of road conditions while providing additional measurements.

The novelty of this approach relies {{on the use of}} a grid motion technique for CFD calculation of response functions {{and the development of a}} time-dependentsurrogate model that fits the relationship between flight conditions (Mach number and angle of attack) and responses calculated from a limited number of simulations (samples). The reduced-order model, along with the surrogate model, providesa means for rapid calculation of response functions and predicting aerodynamic forces and moments during maneuvering flight. The maneuvers are generated using a time-optimal prediction code, each covering a different range of angle of attack and motion rates. The <b>side-slip</b> <b>angle</b> ranges from − 5 ° to 5 ° for all maneuvers, and the model assumes that the lateral aerodynamics is linear with <b>side-slip</b> <b>angle</b> over this range. Results presented show that the aircraft studied in the current paper exhibits highly nonlinear roll moments even at low angles of attack which the linear model fails to predict. The results of the new model provide some evidence that, for a certain range of input parameters, in certain maneuvers considered, the predictions match quitewell with URANS CFD predictions. The models were at least better than traditional quasi-steady predictions. However, for aircraft maneuvering at high angles of attacks, discrepancies are found in lateral coefficients between the model and CFD. At these conditions, the lateral airloads become highly nonlinear with <b>side-slip</b> <b>angle</b> and the model fails to predict these effects.

The wear of rubber is considered {{to be the result of}} energy dissipation due to friction. There are many models that describe the dynamical behaviour of vehicles and tyre, but less e ort has been dedicated to consider the tyre wear in these models. The purpose of the thesis was to create an easy to understand and trend-accurate tyre wear model for implementation in a complete car model. The tyre wear in the thesis is determined to be the amount of rubber volume loss due to sliding per unit length that the tyre travels. A literature study was performed with the objective of gaining knowledge of tyre models and the a ecting parameters of tyre wear. The most important parameters in determining tyre wear were identied as the forward velocity, <b>side-slip</b> <b>angle,</b> longitudinal slip, vertical load, and tyre ination pressure. The wear was chosen to be calculated with Archards wear law for these parameters both separately and combined in pairs in order to obtain a deeper understanding of the wear. The results show that wear is increasing exponentially for the forward velocity. Tyre wear decreases linearly as tyre ination pressure (vertical bristle sti ness) increases. The vertical load, longitudinal slip and <b>side-slip</b> <b>angle</b> yielded exponentially increasing wear.

The performance of the proposed system is verified and evaluated for a variety of situations and maneuvers by using CarSim and Matlab/Simulink...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} novel linear {{observer}} with an extension dealing with polytopic uncertainties {{in a vehicle}} dynamic system to identify the <b>side-slip</b> <b>angle.</b> The performance optimization issue is addressed by the minimization of H∞ norm of the system considering the estimation error as an output and the steer angle as an input. Contrary to the standard robust optimal design approaches, we use a convex inner approximation technique to reduce {{the order of the}} observer and this enables us to derive suboptimal, fixed-order, and efficiently practicable estimators. Moreover, the numerical examples performed on two-track nonlinear model of the system are provided to illustrate the impacts of design parameters on the optimization results and the efficiency of the technique...|$|E
40|$|Procedures for {{determining}} a comprehensive accident scenario from a limited data set are reported. The analysis techniques accept and process data from either an Air Traffic Control radar tracking system or a foil flight data recorder. Local meteorological {{information at the}} time of the accident and aircraft performance data are also utilized. Equations for the desired aircraft motions and forces are given in terms of elements of the measurement set and certain of their time derivatives. The principal assumption made is that aircraft side force and <b>side-slip</b> <b>angle</b> are negligible. An estimation procedure is outlined for use with each data source. For the foil case, a discussion of exploiting measurement redundancy is given. Since either formulation requires estimates of measurement time derivatives, an algorithm for least squares smoothing is provided...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} {{comparison}} study of two vehicle stability control methods by direct yaw-moment control (DYC) : a PID and a sliding controller. For {{the purpose of}} this study, control systems are based solely on vehicle <b>side-slip</b> <b>angle</b> state feedback and the lateral dynamics of the 2 DOF vehicle model are used to establish the desired response. Close-loop dynamics of the PID controller are determined with the pole placement method, and an anti-windup strategy is adopted to respond to the tire’s nonlinear characteristics. The comparison study was performed by computer simulations with a 14 DOF nonlinear vehicle model validated with experimental data. The controllers are evaluated for typical severe manoeuvres on low friction road surfaces. It is found that despite their fundamental differences, the control methods provide comparable performances for the cases studied...|$|E
