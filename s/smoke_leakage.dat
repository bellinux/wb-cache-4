40|$|This study {{examined}} the <b>smoke</b> <b>leakage</b> control of firestops using various filling materials with different densities and construction methods. Realistic <b>smoke</b> <b>leakage</b> control was investigated using actual-scale through-penetration firestop models installed in a curtain wall and air leakage measurement units. The <b>smoke</b> <b>leakage</b> control of firestops with various linear openings, temperatures, and firestop filling thicknesses was measured. When layers were filled with mineral wool, the leakage volume flow rate at a density of 80 kg/m was reduced by about 8 %- 13 % to that at density of 60 kg/m. Regardless of the density level, filling mineral wool in horizontal layers resulted in a leakage volume flow rate at a moderate temperature (200 20 oC) that was 39 %- 42 % of the leakage volume flow rate at room temperature. However, if vertical layers were used, the leakage volume flow rate of the mineral wool at a moderate temperature was about 45 %- 55 % that at room temperature. The results indicate that filling firestops in horizontal layers {{is more effective than}} filling them in vertical layers in terms of <b>smoke</b> <b>leakage</b> control. At both room and moderate temperatures, horizontal firestop fillings were able {{to prevent the spread of}} smoke...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the interaction of}} sprinklers and unit entry doors for hotel apartments. Full scale testing was conducted to quantify the <b>smoke</b> <b>leakage</b> performance of typical unit entry doors during simulated sprinkler controlled fire conditions. Test results showed that for a typical tight fitting unit entry door without any smoke gaskets or seals, excessive <b>smoke</b> <b>leakage</b> into adjoining exit corridors will result where no additional mechanical smoke control systems are employed. The contribution of fire and smoke doors to an effective fire safety strategy is recognised by most prescriptive codes and standards throughout the world. The increasing international trend towards the use of performance based codes and fire safety engineering design principles {{has resulted in the}} need for th...|$|E
40|$|Chinese kangs {{are widely}} used today, in nearly 85 % of rural homes by 175 million people in Northern China. While Chinese kangs are a {{potentially}} energy sustainable solution for home heating, existing systems are characterized by their poor energy efficiency and significant concerns {{about the impact of}} indoor air pollution in homes caused by smoke backflow or <b>smoke</b> <b>leakages.</b> Existing kang designs are based on the intuition and historical accumulation of past craftsmanship experiences. As the first attempt, a macroscopic thermal-fluid approach is used to model the airflow and heat transfer process of an elevated kang with a focus on smoke flow. This model considers nonlinear interaction of thermal buoyancy force, wind force and heat transfer from kang plates and chimney walls. Five parameter groups are identified for characterizing the kang systems to guide the kang smoke flow design. Our work has explained the so-called smoke backflow phenomenon that can lead to serious indoor air quality problems in rural homes and based on the results, we have provided some design recommendations for avoiding smoke backflowand for enhancing energy efficiency by increasing the heat utilization of the kang body.

40|$|A {{program to}} assess the impact of smoke on digital Instrumentation and Control (I and C) safety systems began in 1994, funded by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission Office of Research. Digital I and C safety systems are likely {{replacements}} for today`s analog systems. The nuclear industry has little experience in qualifying digital electronics for critical systems, part of which is understanding system performance during plant fires. The results of tests evaluating the performance of digital circuits and chip technologies exposed to the various smoke and humidity conditions representative of cable fires are discussed. Tests results show that low to moderate smoke densities can cause intermittent failures of digital systems. <b>Smoke</b> increases <b>leakage</b> currents between biased contacts, leading to shorts. Chips with faster switching times, and thus higher output drive currents, are less sensitive to leakage currents and thus to smoke. Contact corrosion from acidic gases in smoke and inductance of stray capacitance are less important contributors to system upset. Transmission line coupling was increased because the smoke acted as a conductive layer between the lines. Permanent circuit damage was not obvious in the 24 hrs of circuit monitoring. Test results also show that polyurethane, parylene, and acrylic conformal coatings are more effective in protecting against smoke than epoxy or silicone. Common-sense mitigation measures are discussed. Unfortunately industry is a long way from standard tests for smoke exposure that capture the variations in smoke exposure possible in an actual fire...|$|R
40|$|Floating {{ring bearing}} {{is widely used}} in turbochargers to {{undertake}} the extreme condition of high rotating speed and high operating temperature. It {{is also the most}} concerned by the designers and users alike due to its high failure rate and high maintenance cost. Any little clearance change may result in oil leakage, which in turn cause blue smoke or black <b>smoke</b> according to <b>leakage</b> types. However, there is no condition monitoring of this bearing because {{it is almost impossible to}} measure the clearance especially the inner clearance, in which the inner oil film directly bears the high speed rotation. In stead of measuring clearance directly, this paper has proposed a method that uses film pressure as a measure to monitor the bearing clearance and its variation. A non-linear mathematical model is developed by using Reynolds equations with non-linear oil film pressure. A full description of the outer and inner film is provided along both axial and radial directions. A numerical simulation is immediately carried out. Variable clearance changes are investigated using the mathematical model. Results show the relationship between clearance and film pressure...|$|R
40|$|Check of <b>smoke</b> <b>leakage</b> of an {{entrance}} door,class A fire door, for highrise apartment {{was carried out}} in a full scale model using a model fire source which was designed to smolder 1 hour and then to flame. The door openable inward and outward with and without air tight material were used. A total 13 types of experimental condi-tions was carried out with major variables of door situation (open or close) and of pressure difference between fire room and corri-dor. Concentrations of smoke, gas, and smoke particles, pressure, temperatures,and weight of fire source were measured. No differe-nce in <b>smoke</b> <b>leakage</b> performance between doors openable inward and outward was obtained. Smoke and combustion gas in corridor were hardly observed when the entrance door was closed, therefore it suggests clearly that the middle corridor is safe enough as an evacuation route when the door was closed...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) {{simulations}} {{are carried}} out to select a better air intake system for a new fire laboratory, designed for experiments with a maximum fire heat release rate of 7 MW. Two different air intake systems are considered: a louver system around the lower perimeter of the building or a chimney system that employs vertical ducts to bring fresh air down from the roof to {{the lower part of}} the building. The two systems are investigated with different fire sizes and wind speeds. The results show that the chimney system gives a more stable smoke and temperature stratification inside the building and a higher hot smoke layer above the floor. The louver system, on the other hand, gives rise to unsymmetrical air movements inside the building when the wind speed outside is high. The louver system also yields a lower hot smoke layer that can spill smoke through the louvers to the outside of the building, especially for small fires with low exhaust flow rates. The results, therefore, suggest that an evenly distributed chimney system would provide a more stable ventilation environment for conducting fire experiments and would prevent <b>smoke</b> <b>leakage</b> to the outside of the building.

40|$|This study investigates, designs, and {{implements}} {{an inexpensive}} application that allows local and remote monitoring of a home. The application {{consists of an}} array of sensors for monitoring different conditions in a home environment and also for accessing the devices that might {{be connected to the}} system. Only a few sensors are initially involved in this study and information about the temperature level, forced entry detection, <b>smoke</b> and water <b>leakage</b> detection can be obtained at any time from any location with an Internet connection. The application software (coded in C language) runs on an embedded system which is basically a wireless Linksys router running on a GNU/Linux based firmware for embedded systems. Interaction between the sensors and the application software is achieved through an implemented sensor interfacing circuit. The communication with the sensor interfacing unit is done through the serial port, and accessibility of the connected sensors is achieved through a telnet client. The sensors can be accessed from local and remote locations with the sensors giving reliable information. The resulting application shows {{that it is possible to}} use the router for other applications other than what it is intended for...|$|R
40|$|Used endoscopically, the CO 2 laser {{offers some}} {{advantages}} over other operative techniques for endometriosis and adhesions but, {{in spite of}} the continuing development of new instrumentation there are still problems with the system. The technique needs specialized equipment requiring ongoing biomedical maintenance and specialized technical care in the operating room. Some problems such as the intraperitoneal accumulation of <b>smoke,</b> gas <b>leakage,</b> and difficulty with maintenance of proper beam alignment still occur. In spite of these problems the advantages are numerous: the system allows precise bloodless destruction of diseased tissue and eliminates the risks of cautery. In the hands of an experienced laparoscopist, it appears safe and effective in vaporization of endometriotic lesions, utero-sacral neurectomy, adhesiolysis and salpingostomy. The judicious use of these techniques, combined with carefully planned further investigations by well-trained and experienced laparoscopists and continuing improvements in the delivery systems, will soon reveal the true efficacy of the CO 2 laser laparoscope. If studies continue to show pregnancy rates and pain relief to be equivalent to those patients treated by laparotomy, CO 2 laser laparoscopy will become the preferred procedure for the management of pelvic endometriosis and its associated adhesions, distal tubal occlusion, pelvic pain and tubal pregnancy. With the exception of using the argon laser to treat endometriosis, the selective absorption characteristic of lasers has not been greatly utilized. While the CO 2 laser is heavily absorbed by water and hence vaporizes most cells in a rather indiscriminate fashion, this is not true for other wavelengths, such as argon, Nd-YAG, KTP, krypton, xenon, copper and gold vapour lasers. The energy form of each of these lasers has different properties of penetration, absorption, reflection and heat dissipation. Many of these lasers have not yet been evaluated in human subjects. An exciting, although not new, area of possible laser application involves the use of photosensitizers and fluorescing agents (Dougherty et al, 1978). Some recent experimental studies (Schellhas and Schneider, 1986; Schneider et al, 1988) may lead to new therapeutic possibilities. The surgical laser is not, however, a panacea. Only controlled trials carried out carefully {{over the next few years}} will clearly define its potential. In the meantime it is incumbent upon all of us to investigate the clinical, gynaecological and surgical applications in a careful, methodical and scientific manner. Peer reviewe...|$|R
