40|$|Aldosterone synthase (CYP <b>11</b> <b>B</b> 2) <b>and</b> <b>11</b> β-hydroxylase (CYP <b>11</b> <b>B</b> 1) {{regulate}} aldosterone and cortisol production, respectively. The {{expression of}} these enzymes is promoted by calcium influx through Cav 3. 2, a T-type calcium channel. Neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF) binds to neuron-restrictive silencer element (NRSE) {{to suppress the}} transcription of NRSE-containing genes. We found a NRSE-like sequence in human CYP <b>11</b> <b>B</b> 2 <b>and</b> CYP <b>11</b> <b>B</b> 1 genes {{as well as the}} CACNA 1 H gene of many mammalian species. The CACNA 1 H gene encodes the α-subunit of Cav 3. 2. Here we investigated how NRSF/NRSE regulates aldosterone and cortisol synthesis. Inhibition of endogenous NRSF by an adenovirus-expressing dominant-negative NRSF (AD/dnNRSF) increased human CYP <b>11</b> <b>B</b> 2 <b>and</b> CYP <b>11</b> <b>B</b> 1 mRNA expression, leading to aldosterone and cortisol secretion in human adrenocortical (H 295 R) cells. In reporter gene experiments, NRSE suppressed luciferase reporters driven by CYP <b>11</b> <b>B</b> 2 <b>and</b> CYP <b>11</b> <b>B</b> 1 promoters <b>and</b> dnNRSF enhanced them. Moreover, cotransfection of dnNRSF increased luciferase activity of reporter genes after deletion or mutation of NRSE, suggesting that NRSF/NRSE regulates transcription of CYP <b>11</b> <b>B</b> 2 <b>and</b> CYP <b>11</b> <b>B</b> 1 genes indirectly. AD/dnNRSF augmented mRNA expression of rat CYP <b>11</b> <b>B</b> 2 <b>and</b> CYP <b>11</b> <b>B</b> 1 genes, neither of which contains a NRSE-like sequence in rat adrenal cells. AD/dnNRSE also significantly increased CACNA 1 H mRNA in H 295 R and rat adrenal cells. Efonidipine, a T/L-type calcium channel blocker, significantly suppressed dnNRSF-mediated up-regulation of CYP <b>11</b> <b>B</b> 2 <b>and</b> CYP <b>11</b> <b>B</b> 1 expression. Moreover, NRSF/NRSE is also involved in angiotensin II- and K+-stimulated augmentation of CYP <b>11</b> <b>B</b> 2 <b>and</b> CYP <b>11</b> <b>B</b> 1 gene transcription. In conclusion, NRSF/NRSE controls aldosterone and cortisol synthesis by regulating CYP <b>11</b> <b>B</b> 2 <b>and</b> CYP <b>11</b> <b>B</b> 1 gene transcription mainly through NRSF/NRSE-mediated enhancement of the CACNA 1 H gene...|$|R

This study also provided morphological data {{to investigate the}} signal transduction mechanisms of myocardial hypertrophy and reverse it. Materials and Methods: A myocardial hypertrophy model was established by subcutaneously injecting isoprenaline in healthy adult Sprague-Dawley rats. Myocardial tissues were obtained, embedded in conventional paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin. Pathological changes in myocardial tissues were then observed. The expressions and distributions of CD 11 a, CD <b>11</b> <b>b,</b> <b>and</b> CD <b>11</b> c integrins were detected by immunohistochemistry. Changes in the mRNA expressions of CD 11 a, CD <b>11</b> <b>b,</b> <b>and</b> CD <b>11</b> c in the myocardial tissues of rats were detected by RT-PCR. Image analysis software {{was used to determine}} the expressions of CD 11 a, CD <b>11</b> <b>b,</b> <b>and</b> CD <b>11</b> c integrins quantitatively. Results: Immunohistochemical results showed that the positive expressions of CD 11 a, CD <b>11</b> <b>b,</b> <b>and</b> CD <b>11</b> c integrins increased significantly in the experimental group compared with those in the control group.

Scores from objective clinical measures of balance have frequently been associated with falls in older adults. The Berg Balance Score (BBS) which is a frequently used scale to test balance impairments in the elderly,takes time to perform and has been found to have scoring inconsistencies. The purpose was to determine if individual items or a group of BBS items would have better accuracy than the total BBS in classifying community dwelling elderly individuals according to fall history. Method: 60 community dwelling elderly individuals were chosen based on a history of falls in this cross sectional study. Each BBS item was dichotomized at three points along the scoring scale of 0 – 4 : between scores of 1 and 2, 2 and 3, and 3 and 4. Sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), and positive (+LR) and negative (-LR) likelihood ratios were calculated for all items for each scoring dichotomy based on their accuracy in classifying subjects with a history of multiple falls. These findings were compared with the total BBS score where the cut-off score was derived from receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Results: On analysing a combination of BBS items, <b>B</b> 9 <b>and</b> <b>B</b> <b>11</b> were found to have the best sensitivity and specificity when considered together. However the area under the curve of these items was 0. 799 which did not match that of the total score (AUC= 0. 837). A, combination of 4 BBS items - <b>B</b> 9 <b>B</b> <b>11</b> <b>B</b> 12 <b>and</b> B 13 also had good Sn and Sp but the AUC was 0. 815.

The sample population consisted of a panel of 100 dogs of <b>11</b> breeds <b>and</b> mixed bred dogs, chosen to represent the US dog population. 3 Exonic SNPs were identified; a synonymous G>A SNP in exon 1 (2 <b>B</b> <b>11</b> * 1) could however not be confirmed and quantified in the larger population. A non-synonymous C>T SNP was found in exon 2 (2 <b>B</b> <b>11</b> * 2), this was present in the population with an allele frequency of 8 % but mainly in Labrador Retrievers. This polymorphism was predicted to have a probable damaging effect on CYP 2 <b>B</b> <b>11.</b> A potential splice site G>A SNP (2 <b>B</b> <b>11</b> * 3) was found in exon 7 and showed to be widely distributed, having an allele frequency of 65 % in the overall population. Besides these exonic SNPs, two intronic SNPs were identified but not tested to confirm. The reference sequence differed from all tested dogs in exon 6, maybe representing a SNP in the Boxer used for this reference sequence. These polymorphisms could have major effects on the function of CYP 2 <b>B</b> <b>11</b> <b>and</b> these results therefore prove a need for further investigation...|$|R

We have determined these ratios for the multipole components b 3, b 4, b 5, b 7, <b>b</b> 9, <b>b</b> <b>11</b> <b>and</b> a 3, a 4,a 5 of the main dipoles...|$|R
