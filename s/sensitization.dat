5|$|Beryllium is {{a health}} and safety issue for workers. Exposure to {{beryllium}} in the workplace {{can lead to a}} <b>sensitization</b> immune response and can over time develop chronic beryllium disease (CBD). The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States researches these effects in collaboration with a major manufacturer of beryllium products. The goal of this research is to prevent <b>sensitization</b> and CBD by developing {{a better understanding of the}} work processes and exposures that may present a potential risk for workers, and to develop effective interventions that will reduce the risk for adverse health effects. NIOSH also conducts genetic research on <b>sensitization</b> and CBD, independently of this collaboration. The NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods contains methods for measuring occupational exposures to beryllium.|$|E
5|$|Apical {{periodontitis}} is acute {{or chronic}} inflammation around {{the apex of}} a tooth caused by an immune response to bacteria within an infected pulp. It does not occur because of pulp necrosis, meaning that a tooth that tests as if it's alive (vital) may cause apical periodontitis, and a pulp which has become non-vital due to a sterile, non-infectious processes (such as trauma) may not cause any apical periodontitis. Bacterial cytotoxins reach the region around {{the roots of the}} tooth via the apical foramina and lateral canals, causing vasodilation, <b>sensitization</b> of nerves, osteolysis (bone resorption) and potentially abscess or cyst formation.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{reactivity}} of the metal, toxicological data are available only for compounds. Water-soluble barium compounds are poisonous. In low doses, barium ions act as a muscle stimulant, and higher doses affect the nervous system, causing cardiac irregularities, tremors, weakness, anxiety, shortness of breath, and paralysis. This toxicity {{may be caused by}} Ba2+ blocking potassium ion channels, which are critical to the proper function of the nervous system. Other organs damaged by water-soluble barium compounds (i.e., barium ions) are the eyes, immune system, heart, respiratory system, and skin causing, for example, blindness and <b>sensitization.</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: Guidelines and {{position}} papers indicate that allergen immunotherapy (AIT) {{is the only}} disease-modifying treatment, including prevention of the onset of new allergen <b>sensitizations.</b> However, this preventive effect was shown by only a few observational studies. Our aim was to systematically review the efficacy of AIT in preventing the onset of new allergen <b>sensitizations.</b> Methods: Computerized bibliographic searches of Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (through June 2015) were supplemented with manual searches of reference lists. Observational studies or randomized controlled trials with a long-term observation period were included. Paired reviewers extracted data about study characteristics and assessed biases. The end point was the risk difference in the onset of new allergen <b>sensitizations</b> between patients treated with AIT and pharmacotherapy. The strength of the evidence was graded based on the risk of bias, consistency, and magnitude of effect, according to the GRADE Working Group's guide. Results: Eighteen studies (1049 children, 10   057 adults) met the inclusion criteria. The risk of bias was high {{in all but one}} study. Low evidence supports the position that AIT prevents the onset of new allergen <b>sensitizations,</b> with 10 of 18 studies reporting a reduction in the onset of new <b>sensitizations</b> in patients treated with AIT vs placebo. Small studies and studies with a shorter follow-up showed the highest benefit of AIT. Conclusions: The overall evidence provides a low-grade level of the evidence supporting the efficacy of AIT in preventing the onset of new allergen <b>sensitizations,</b> but high-quality studies could change this estimate...|$|R
40|$|Background: Although the {{preventive}} {{efficacy of}} allergen immunotherapy (AIT) in {{the onset of}} new allergen <b>sensitizations</b> has been asserted by many reviews, position papers, and consensus conferences, the evidence available is from only 3 studies. The objective of this work was a systematic review to evaluate the preventive efficacy of AIT in the onset of new allergen <b>sensitizations.</b> The end-point was the risk difference (RD) in the onset of new allergen <b>sensitizations</b> between patients treated with AIT and pharmacotherapy. Methods: Computerized bibliographic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (until November 30 th, 2016) were done. Random-effects and fixed-effects model meta-analyses were performed. Randomized controlled trials or observational studies comparing children treated with AIT with house dust mite (HDM) to subjects who did not receive AIT, with a long-term observation period (at least 3 years including treatment and follow-up) have been included. Results: Eight studies totaling 721 children (390 treated with AIT and 331 with pharmacotherapy) met the inclusion criteria. The risk of bias was high. Low evidence supports the conclusion that AIT prevents the onset of new allergen <b>sensitizations,</b> with 3 of 8 studies reporting {{a reduction in the}} onset of new <b>sensitizations</b> in patients treated with AIT vs pharmacotherapy. Our meta-analysis found no difference between AIT and pharmacotherapy, with high heterogeneity (RD, â 8 ̆ 89 ̆ 20. 10; 95...|$|R

5|$|Prolonged skin {{contact with}} {{glacial acetic acid}} may result in tissue destruction. Inhalation {{exposure}} (eight hours) to acetic acid vapours at 10 ppm can produce some irritation of eyes, nose, and throat; at 100 ppm marked lung irritation and possible damage to lungs, eyes, and skin may result. Vapour concentrations of 1,000 ppm cause marked irritation of eyes, nose and upper respiratory tract and cannot be tolerated. These predictions were based on animal experiments and industrial exposure. Skin <b>sensitization</b> to acetic acid is rare, but has occurred.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with other}} members of the lipocalin protein family, major urinary {{proteins}} can be potent allergens to humans. The reason for this is not known, however molecular mimicry between Mups and structurally similar human lipocalins has been proposed as a possible explanation. The protein product of the mouse Mup17 gene, known as Musm1, Ag1 or MA1, accounts for much of the allergenic properties of mouse urine. The protein is extremely stable in the environment; studies have found 95% of inner city homes, and 82% of all types of homes in the United States have detectable levels in at least one room. Similarly, Ratn1 is a known human allergen. A US study found its presence in 33% of inner city homes, and 21% of occupants were sensitized to the allergen. Exposure and <b>sensitization</b> to rodent Mup proteins is considered a risk factor for childhood asthma, and is a leading cause of laboratory animal allergy (LAA)—an occupational disease of laboratory animal technicians and scientists. One study found that two-thirds of laboratory workers who had developed asthmatic reactions to animals had antibodies to Ratn1.|$|E
25|$|Recently {{this idea}} has regained some {{credibility}} {{under a new}} term, central <b>sensitization.</b> Central <b>sensitization</b> occurs when neurons in the spinal cord's dorsal horn or brainstem become more responsive after repeated stimulation by peripheral neurons, so that weaker signals can trigger them. The delay in appearance of referred pain shown in laboratory experiments can be explained due to {{the time required to}} create the central <b>sensitization.</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: Allergen-specific {{immunotherapy}} (AIT) {{still remains}} the only causal treatment for IgE mediated respiratory diseases (rhinitis/asthma) In addition to the observed clinical decrease in symptoms, AIT can provide a long-lasting and preventive effect. In particular it can modify the progression from rhinitis to asthma. Methods: The study was observational, open, non randomized, controlled, prospective and performed in a real-life setting. Patients with pure mite-induced allergic rhinitis were followed-up, receiving adjuvanted SLIT (aSLIT), standard SLIT (sSLIT) or drug treatment alone, according to their preference starting between 2008 and 2009. The possible onset of asthma, changes in pulmonary function and bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR) were assessed over a 5 -year horizon. Also the onset of new <b>sensitizations</b> and symptoms-medication score (SMS) were evaluated. Results: One hundred forty two patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were assessed at baseline, and 124 had the 5 -year evaluation (age range 8 – 57, 69 male).

40|$|The aim is {{to review}} recent {{literature}} up to July 2013 concerning the effect of allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) on asthma.

25|$|There is {{compelling}} {{evidence that the}} N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor has significant involvement in the CNS <b>sensitization</b> process. It is also hypothesized that elevated CNS glutamate levels promote wind-up and CNS <b>sensitization.</b> In addition, there is experimental evidence that demonstrates NMDA receptors in peripheral nerves. Because immunological functions can modulate CNS physiology, {{it has also been}} hypothesized that a variety of immune processes may contribute to the initial development and maintenance of peripheral and central <b>sensitization.</b> Furthermore, trauma related cytokine release, exaggerated neurogenic inflammation, sympathetic afferent coupling, adrenoreceptor pathology, glial cell activation, cortical reorganisation, and oxidative damage (e.g., by free radicals) are all concepts that have been implicated in the pathophysiology of CRPS.|$|E
25|$|The (spinal cord) {{dorsal horn}} neurons {{give rise to}} the spinothalamic tract (STT), which {{constitutes}} the major ascending nociceptive pathway. As a consequence of spontaneous activity arising in the periphery, STT neurons develop increased background activity, enlarged receptive fields and increased responses to afferent impulses, including normally innocuous tactile stimuli. This phenomenon is called central <b>sensitization.</b> Central <b>sensitization</b> is an important mechanism of persistent neuropathic pain.|$|E

25|$|The nerves {{of young}} babies respond more readily to noxious stimuli, {{with a lower}} {{threshold}} to stimulation, than those of adults. A baby's threshold for <b>sensitization</b> is also substantially decreased, whilst the process involves a much larger area of <b>sensitization</b> with each trauma.

25|$|There is {{emerging}} evidence {{from studies of}} cord bloods that both <b>sensitization</b> and the acquisition of tolerance can begin in pregnancy, however the window of main danger for <b>sensitization</b> to foods extends prenatally, remaining most critical during early infancy when {{the immune system and}} intestinal tract are still maturing. There is no conclusive evidence to support the restriction of dairy intake in the maternal diet during pregnancy in order to prevent. This is generally not recommended since the drawbacks in terms of loss of nutrition can out-weigh the benefits. However, further randomised, controlled trials are required to examine if dietary exclusion by lactating mothers can truly minimize risk to a significant degree and if any reduction in risk is out-weighed by deleterious impacts on maternal nutrition.|$|E

25|$|While {{working in}} London {{in the early}} 1970s with John R. Vane (Nobel prize in Medicine, 1983), he participated in the {{discovery}} of the inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins by aspirin-like drugs. At that time, he proposed that the mechanism of the analgesic action of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was due to the prevention of pain receptor <b>sensitization</b> which results from an inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins. This hypothesis was supported by further work from his laboratory and from many other investigators. His studies on the basic mechanisms involved in the development of inflammatory hyperalgesia led to the discovery that a select class of analgesics like metamizole, in contrast to the classical NSAIDs, are able to counteract the ongoing <b>sensitization</b> of the primary sensory neuron via the stimulation of the arginine/nitric oxide pathway. He recently (December 2008) characterized a phenomenon described as retrograde <b>sensitization</b> of the primary sensory neuron, which emphasizes the importance of the peripheral component of the inflammatory pain. His group made a relevant contribution to the role of bradykinin and of cytokines in the development of inflammatory hyperalgesia. He found that among the cytokines, interleukin 1b mediates the endogenous release of prostaglandins and IL-8 is responsible {{for the development of the}} sympathetic hyperalgesia. In this area he described an antagonist of IL-1 that is now being developed as a model for a new class of analgesics.|$|E
25|$|Allergy to nickel is {{a common}} cause of contact dermatitis, with roughly 10% of the {{population}} in Western Europe and North America being sensitive to nickel. Initial <b>sensitization</b> frequently occurs from jewellery such as ear studs and other body piercings, and nickel allergy is more prevalent among women than men. Once sensitized, an individual can develop contact dermatitis from shorter term contact with nickel-containing products: this is a particular problem given the use of nickel in coinage, such as the European one- and two-euro coins and the Canadian five-cent piece. This led to moves by two European countries to prevent the initial <b>sensitization</b> of jewellery wearers by limiting the use of nickel in piercing studs and other products which are in prolonged contact with the skin, and then to the European Union Nickel Directive in 1994.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{describe}} differences in clinical response to allergen challenges in allergic rhinitis subjects with different <b>sensitizations.</b> We investigated multiple {{steps in the}} allergic cascade to find an explanation for this difference in clinical response. Furthermore, the role of dendritic cells is discussed, with emphasis on an appropriate balance between pro-inflammatory versus tolerogenic effects of different dendritic cell (DC) subsets. Numbers of myeloid DCs (mDCs), plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and Langerhans type DCs (LDCs) in nasal mucosa differ between subjects with different allergic <b>sensitizations.</b> The mDC/pDC ratio is equal for allergic and healthy subjects, however after nasal allergen provocation the ratio in healthy subjects decreases, while remaining the same in allergic subjects, suggesting lack of immunosuppression in allergic subjects. Tissue distribution of mDCs, pDCs and LDCs in human oral mucosa shows significantly more mDCs and LDCs in oral mucosa in allergic subjects compared to healthy controls. Given the complexity and heterogeneity in function of dendritic cells, and flexibility of DC subets in expression of function, we tried to gain more insight in their role by studying distribution of DC subsets in several models of immunological dysfunction. We analyzed dendritic cells in nasal mucosa of IgA Nephropathy patients, in pulmonary mucosa of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) patients, and in intestinal mucosa and mesenteric lymph nodes of patients with Crohn’s disease and non-IBD patients.
