5|$|The {{machines}} were not all straight {{copies of the}} ZX81; some, such as the CP-200, came with extra memory and a larger case (often with a chiclet keyboard {{in place of the}} original membrane keyboard).

5|$|These {{processes}} {{are also important}} in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are {{largely responsible for the}} production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste. Facultative anaerobes can <b>switch</b> <b>between</b> fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves.|$|E

Each player selects two characters {{to compete in}} a one-on-one battle, attempting to defeat the opposing team. The players are given the ability to <b>switch</b> <b>between</b> their characters at any point during the match. The game also incorporates numerous elements from X-Men: Children of the Atom and Marvel Super Heroes.|$|E
5|$|A PC Engine port of Ninja RyÅ«kenden was {{produced}} in 1992, published by Hudson Soft and released only in Japan; it features more colorful and detailed graphics, along with difficulty and gameplay tweaks and a different soundtrack. This version also supports three different language settings with Japanese, English and Chinese as the available options. However, the English translation used in this version differs from the one used in the earlier NES version. To <b>switch</b> <b>between</b> the three settings, the player must press the Select + I + II buttons simultaneously at the title screen, which will change the text under the logo to the appropriate characters.|$|E
5|$|An ore-bulk-oil carrier, {{also known}} as {{combination}} carrier or OBO, is a ship designed {{to be capable of}} carrying wet or dry bulk cargoes. This design was intended to provide flexibility in two ways. Firstly, an OBO would be able to <b>switch</b> <b>between</b> the dry and wet bulk trades based on market conditions. Secondly, an OBO could carry oil on one leg of a voyage and return carrying dry bulk, reducing the number of unprofitable ballast voyages it would have to make.|$|E

The Android version was released in March 2012, the Steam version was released April 4, 2013 and GOG version was released April 22, 2013 (15th Anniversary Edition available on GOG in the same package as 20th Anniversary Edition).|$|E

Due {{to the high}} angle of attack, the long pointed nose obstructed the view and necessitated the capability to droop. The droop nose {{was accompanied by a}} moving visor that retracted into the nose prior to being lowered. When the nose was raised to horizontal, the visor would rise in front of the cockpit windscreen for aerodynamic streamlining.|$|E

The game supports a Career mode (described below), a Quickplay mode, where players can create a set list of numerous songs and play through them. All songs on disc and through downloadable content are immediately available to play in this mode. The game also carries over the competitive modes from previous Guitar Hero games.|$|E

5|$|In Nier and Drakengard 3, {{the player}} {{controls}} the main protagonist {{with two other}} characters acting as AI-controlled supports. Drakengard 3 {{was designed to be}} a faster experience than the previous games, with the protagonist being given a special hyper-mode and the ability to freely <b>switch</b> <b>between</b> weapons without pausing the action. Aerial gameplay was also changed, with the dragon now capable of ground combat. Nier, while featuring similar hack-and-slash combat, also includes other gameplay types such as a top-down view for puzzle areas, 2D style areas for buildings or similar structures. Side-quests were also added, which often involved fetch quests, fishing and farming.|$|E

In the course of the game, Link learns three tunes to play on the harp. The Tune of Echoes activates Time Portals at fixed locations; the Tune of Currents enables Link to travel from the past to the present without a Time Portal; the Tune of Ages allows Link to <b>switch</b> <b>between</b> the two time periods at almost any location on the map.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} met with very {{positive}} reviews from critics, receiving an aggregated score of 93% from Metacritic. Similar to its predecessor, StarCraft II was praised for its engaging gameplay, {{as well as its}} introduction of new features and improved storytelling. The game was criticized for lacking features that existed in the original StarCraft game including LAN play and the ability to <b>switch</b> <b>between</b> multiplayer regions. At the time of its release, StarCraft II became the fastest-selling real-time strategy game, with over three million copies sold worldwide in the first month.|$|E

5|$|The game's {{multiplayer}} received mixed reviews. Prell {{thought that}} the mission-design was varied, and the voting system kept the mode from being repetitive. He also praised the interconnected structure between the single-player and multiplayer, noting that the items that could be carried over from multiplayer to campaign made the mode feel rewarding for players. Reiner {{thought that the}} action featured in this mode is satisfying, but thought that the system lacked enough depth and complexity to engage players. Patterson echoed similar thoughts, and felt that the ability of players to <b>switch</b> <b>between</b> the campaign and the Chaos Squad mode made the multiplayer mode a rewarding experience. Brown criticized the mode, saying that its difficulty was not properly scaled.|$|E
5|$|The new {{keyboard}} did {{not include}} the BASIC keyword markings that were found on earlier Spectrums, except for the keywords LOAD, CODE and RUN which were useful for loading software. This was not a major issue, as the +2 boasted a menu system, almost identical to the ZX Spectrum 128, where one could <b>switch</b> <b>between</b> 48K BASIC programming with the keywords, and 128K BASIC programming in which all words (keywords and otherwise) must be typed out in full (although the keywords are still stored internally as one character each). Despite these changes, the layout remained identical to that of the 128.|$|E
5|$|With the {{popularity}} of the Guitar Hero and Rock Band franchises, many wondered if BrÃ¼tal Legend would take advantage of these games' guitar-themed controllers. Schafer mentioned that while he had entertained the idea, he could not find an acceptable way for players to repeatedly <b>switch</b> <b>between</b> standard and guitar controllers, so he abandoned it. Players who preordered the game through GameStop were able to unlock a special promotional in-game guitar designed in conjunction with Jack Black's band Tenacious D, and includes voices provided by both Black and Kyle Gass.|$|E
