50|$|Leaf springs {{were very}} common on automobiles, {{right up to}} the 1970s in Europe and Japan and late 1970s in America when the move to front-wheel drive, and more {{sophisticated}} suspension designs saw automobile manufacturers use <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> instead. Today leaf springs are still used in heavy commercial vehicles such as vans and trucks, SUVs, and railway carriages. For heavy vehicles, they have the advantage of spreading the load more widely over the vehicle's chassis, whereas <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> transfer it to a <b>single</b> point. Unlike <b>coil</b> <b>springs,</b> leaf springs also locate the rear axle, eliminating the need for trailing arms and a Panhard rod, thereby saving cost and weight in a simple live axle rear suspension. A further advantage of a leaf spring over a helical spring is {{that the end of the}} leaf spring may be guided along a definite path.|$|R
40|$|An {{alternative}} to the conventional telescopic fork type front suspension used in bicycles is the Floating handle bar suspension which replaces the two springs {{that are used in}} the Telescopic forks by a <b>single</b> open <b>coiled</b> <b>spring</b> of a greater wire diameter and stiffness thereby eliminating the need of telescopic forks. In our study we determine the spring that is to be used to produce the required suspension effect. The newly designed spring was integrated to the bicycle and the model was validated by a working prototype which was ridden to check for any failures. The bicycle model used for checking the effectiveness of floating handlebar suspension was a Hercules Terminator V 2. One major problem that we faced was the maneuverability of the bicycle during hard turns. This was due to the increase in weight of the front suspension...|$|R

40|$|Electrical power {{generation}} {{is paid for}} {{on the basis of}} the marginal costs of generation, and supply is paid for at the marginal cost at the supply point. In the case where power lines form a loop and there is a limit on a line within the loop, the electrical requirements of providing supply force a reallocation of generation and a step change in the marginal costs. This is known as the <b>spring</b> <b>washer</b> effect. In some cases the cost of supply can reach extreme levels. Transpower and its customers are interested in obtaining a better understanding of these events. Simplified equations determining {{power generation}} and pricing are derived. So-lutions for the supply costs are obtained for several simple cases. Numerical exam-ples and a graphical representation demonstrate the <b>spring</b> <b>washer</b> effect and how a <b>spring</b> <b>washer</b> responds to changes. Several possible changes that reduce the cost of supply are demonstrated. When a <b>spring</b> <b>washer</b> comes active the marginal prices make a step change. This means that power costs can be be highly sensitive to the values of all the network parameters that affect the power flow in the power loop.

40|$|Introduction: The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate the percentage of force degradation of elastomeric chains, NiTi closed <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> and stainless steel closed <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> at different time intervals in different media. Materials and methods: Three types of space closing auxiliaries, such as elastomeric chains, NiTi closed <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> and stainless steel <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> immersed in artificial saliva, alcohol-free mouthrinse (Colgate plax) and alcohol-containing mouthrinse (Listerine) at time interval of 1, 4, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days were divided into nine groups of 15 each: Group I- 15 polyurethane elastomeric chain immersed inside artificial saliva (Control). Group II- 15 polyurethane elastomeric chain immersed inside alcohol-free mouthrinse. Group III- 15 polyurethane elastomeric chain immersed inside alcohol-containing mouthrinse. Group IV- 15 stainless steel closed <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> immersed inside artificial saliva (Control). Group V- 15 stainless steel closed <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> immersed inside alcohol-free mouthrinse. Group VI- 15 stainless steel closed <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> immersed inside alcohol-containing mouthrinse. Group VII- 15 NiTi closed <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> immersed inside artificial saliva (Control). Group VIII- 15 nickel titanium closed <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> immersed inside alcohol-free mouthrinse.

Results: The force produced by elastomeric chain, stainless steel closed <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> and NiTi closed <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> at seven time intervals in artificial saliva, alcohol-free mouthwash and alcohol-containing mouthwash showed a statistically significant difference (p < 0. 001).

Aims and objectives : The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the effect of wire diameter, lumen size and length of <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> on the load produced as a function of displacement of SS and NiTi <b>coil</b> <b>spring.</b> Materials and methods : The study consisted of 60 samples of open and closed <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> (30 each). Open <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> were tested in compression and closed <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> in tension using a Lloyd universal testing machine. The data obtained was subjected to statistical analysis using student′s t-test. Results : Mean values, standard deviation and t-value were calculated. Statistically significant difference were obtained in between the groups (p < 0. 05), (p < 0. 001). Discussion : The heaviest load value at 60 % compression was recorded in 0. 010 × 0. 030 spring with 20 cm initial length due to its large wire diameter and reduced lumen size among the <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> tested. Straight line of load deflection curve bears clinical significance due to unpredictable behavior of spring beyond a certain limit.
