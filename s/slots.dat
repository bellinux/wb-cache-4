5|$|All seven PCI Express x16 <b>slots</b> in the Asus P6T7 {{motherboard}} {{were used}} in the building of the Fastra II computer. However, the video cards in the Fastra II are wide enough to require two such <b>slots</b> each. To solve this issue, the researchers came up with flexible PCI Express cables, and Tones developed a custom cage which allowed the video cards to suspend over the motherboard.|$|E
5|$|Like the Fastra I, the Fastra II uses a Lian Li PC-P80 Armorsuit case, {{which has}} 10 {{expansion}} <b>slots.</b> The motherboard in the Fastra II {{was at that}} time the only workstation motherboard that had seven full-sized PCI Express x16 <b>slots.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some {{scheduling}} {{problems can}} be modeled as a question about finding graph homomorphisms. As an example, one might want to assign workshop courses to time <b>slots</b> in a calendar so that two courses attended by the same student are not too {{close to each other}} in time. The courses form a graph G, with an edge between any two courses that are attended by some common student. The time <b>slots</b> form a graph H, with an edge between any two <b>slots</b> that are distant enough in time. For instance, if one wants a cyclical, weekly schedule, such that each student gets their workshop courses on non-consecutive days, then H would be the complement graph of C7. A graph homomorphism from G to H is then a schedule assigning courses to time <b>slots,</b> as specified. To add a requirement saying that, e.g., no single student has courses on both Friday and Monday, it suffices to remove the corresponding edge from H.|$|E

5|$|As in Final Fantasy XII, {{enemies are}} {{integrated}} into the open field and can be approached or avoided by the player. When the player's character touches an enemy, the screen transitions from the regular map to a separate battle screen {{similar to those used}} in previous Final Fantasy titles. A maximum of three characters may be used in battles, which use a variant on the series' traditional Active Time Battle (ATB) system first featured in Final Fantasy IV. Under this system, the player selects an action from the menus, such as Attack, Magic, and Item. Unlike previous games in the series, the player only controls the lead character while the remaining two characters are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI). Each action requires a specific number of <b>slots</b> on the ATB bar, which continually refills to a set maximum number of <b>slots.</b> The ATB bar gradually increases in size throughout the game from two <b>slots</b> to six. The player may select less than the maximum number of possible actions, or may stop the filling of the ATB bar and perform as many actions as can be done with the current ATB amount. The player may select an autobattle command, which fills the ATB <b>slots</b> with actions chosen automatically. Actions cannot be performed outside of battle, and the characters' health is fully restored after each battle.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{is almost}} {{identical}} to the previous game's version of the series' Active Time Battle (ATB) system, called the Command Synergy Battle system. Under this system, the player selects an action from the menus, such as Attack, Abilities, or Item. Each action requires a specific number of <b>slots</b> on the ATB bar, which continually refills at a constant rate to a set maximum number of <b>slots.</b> The kinds of attack actions available are close-range melee attacks or ranged magical attacks, {{but there are also}} other magical actions that evoke healing or shielding abilities. The ATB bar can be increased in size throughout the game from three <b>slots</b> to six. The player may select less than the maximum number of possible actions or may stop the filling of the ATB bar and perform as many actions as can be done with the current ATB amount. The player may select an autobattle command, which fills the ATB <b>slots</b> with actions chosen automatically. Actions cannot be performed outside of combat, and the characters' health is fully restored after each fight. Players have the option of restarting a battle while {{in the middle of a}} fight. During some skirmishes, players are put through quick time events called Cinematic Actions that allows them to deal higher damage to foes and end certain battles.|$|E

After the closure of Little Red, all but three of the Heathrow <b>slots</b> were returned to BA and absorbed back into their operation, thus granting them a monopoly on UK mainland domestic flights at Heathrow {{for the first time}} since British Midland Airways (as BMI were named at the time) moved into Heathrow in 1982.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{flexibility}} in array design and more accurate {{control over the}} <b>slot</b> radiation level {{has led to the}} design of post <b>slot</b> antenna. A post <b>slot</b> waveguide antenna consists of a centreline longitudinal <b>slot</b> with a tuning post. By varying the probe depth and <b>slot</b> length, it is possible to produce beam steering effect electromechanically. The objective {{of this paper is to}} propose a novel post <b>slot</b> configuration for waveguide antenna design. The desired operating frequency is 1. 4 GHz for L-band remote sensing application. This paper presents the simulation and measurement of the proposed post <b>slot</b> waveguide antenna. Simulation on a four-element of conventional shunt <b>slot</b> and the proposed post <b>slot</b> antenna arrays has been carried out by using a three-dimensional electromagnetic simulation tool. It is shown that the post <b>slot</b> array antenna has superior performance as compared to the conventional shunt <b>slot</b> array antenna in terms of first side-lobe level. A series of measurement on two hardware prototypes (proposed post <b>slot</b> and conventional shunt <b>slot</b> array antennas) has been conducted in an indoor anechoic chamber. The measurement results clearly indicate the flexibility of the proposed post <b>slot</b> in controlling radiation pattern as compared to the conventional shunt <b>slot</b> configurations...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{unsteady}} suction from a high-Reynolds-number cross-flow into a <b>slot</b> is {{considered in the}} case where the suction is driven by a time-dependent <b>slot</b> pressure. The model uses linearised asymptotics based on a small parameter that defines the suction strength. An integro differential equation is derived for the mass flow into the <b>slot</b> and this is solved for various time-dependent <b>slot</b> pressures of practical interest. Closed-form expressions are also found for {{the shape of the}} shear layer dividing the external flow from the fluid in the <b>slot.</b> For a step function change in the <b>slot</b> pressure, a non-monotonic decay to the steady solution is observed, and for an oscillatory <b>slot</b> pressure there is a phase lag between the <b>slot</b> pressure and the mass flow. For rapidly changing <b>slot</b> pressures it is shown that <b>slot</b> injection can occur, even when the <b>slot</b> pressure remains below the free-stream pressure...|$|R

At that time, the ASTRA group needed a {{motherboard}} that had four PCI Express x16 <b>slots</b> with double-spacing between each of them. The only such motherboard the ASTRA group could find at that time was the MSI K9A2 Platinum, which has four such <b>slots.</b> In 2009, the Asus P6T7 WS Supercomputer motherboard, which the Fastra II uses, was released, which has seven PCI Express x16 <b>slots.</b> The Fastra II has six faster dual-GPU GeForce GTX 295 video cards, and a single-GPU GeForce GTX 275, {{for a total}} of 13 GPUs.
