Share capital was , plus loans from the <b>shipping</b> <b>company.</b> Braathens had made good money during World War II with the {{participation}} in the Norwegian Shipping and Trade Mission, and received permission to use US$1 million to purchase aircraft. The idea to start an airline had occurred to Braathen in 1936, when the ship Brajara had engine trouble while en route to Japan. The Japanese shipyards could not guarantee that they could repair the ship, and {{at first it was}} considered whether the ship should be towed to Europe for repairs. The solution chosen was instead to have the necessary piece made in Amsterdam and flown by KLM. Braathen wanted to have an airline that would be able to fly crew and supplies to his and other ships throughout the world—primarily in the Far East.|$|E

5|$|In January 1998, Olav Nils Sunde {{announced}} that he would establish a low-cost airline following the opening of the new airport. The company would be led by CEO Morten Andersen, who previously had been CEO of Norway Airlines, and the lawyer Stein Øxseth. Sunde would own 92% of the company through his <b>shipping</b> <b>company</b> Larvik Scandi Line, while Andersen and Øxseth would own 4% each. The company would be a brand extension of Sunde's <b>shipping</b> <b>company</b> Color Line. The company aimed at a 15–20% market share, with 1.4 million passengers annually. It was the first low-cost airline in Norway. The company launched tickets down to NOK 500 each way, and sold cheap tickets without demanding that the traveler be away during a weekend. Color Air made an agreement with the British airline Air Foyle HeavyLift to operate a fleet of Boeing 737-300 aircraft.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} social and {{environmental}} information disclosure practices of <b>shipping</b> <b>companies,</b> with specific reference to how they account for the lifecycle of ships under their control. This thesis sheds light on the working conditions, violations of human rights, and ecological damage within the ship-breaking yards of Chittagong, Bangladesh. The thesis has two interrelated sections. The first section explores {{the social and}} environmental disclosure practices of the top ten global <b>shipping</b> <b>companies</b> for a particular year. The second section explores the disclosure practices {{of some of the}} identified <b>shipping</b> <b>companies</b> that supplied their ships for dismantling to the ship yards of Chittagong, Bangladesh. Both sections utilise annual report content analysis. For the purposes of measurement, an index called ‘Ship recycling related information disclosure index’ (SRIDI) has been used and the unit of analysis is the frequency of disclosures. The thesis also developed an ‘accountability model’ to evaluate the accountability demonstrated by the <b>shipping</b> <b>companies.</b> The thesis finds that the extent of disclosures of social and environmental information, including ship recycle-related information by the global top ten <b>shipping</b> <b>companies,</b> is relatively high for some of the organisations. However, the disclosures made by the identified <b>shipping</b> <b>companies</b> that are alleged to supply the end-of-life ships to Bangladesh seem to be lower than the global top ten <b>shipping</b> <b>companies.</b> The thesis finds no information from either the global <b>shipping</b> <b>companies</b> or from the identified <b>shipping</b> <b>companies</b> annual report that specifically states where the ships actually go {{at the end of their}} lifecycle. This implies that the <b>shipping</b> <b>companies</b> avoid mentioning the final destination for their end-of-life ships to avoid potential criticism for dumping them in the ship-breaking yards of developing countries, an act which might negatively impact their reputation as well as ‘brands’. This also implies that although <b>shipping</b> <b>companies</b> that allegedly supply their end-of-life ships to Bangladesh should be accountable for their actions. However this does not appear to be the case. This thesis used a normative theoretical perspective and applied ‘accountability model’ to analyse the findings. The first part of the thesis was accepted as a paper in the AFAANZ conference 2012 held in Melbourne and was presented in a concurrent session by the researcher...|$|R
