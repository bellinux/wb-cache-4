5000|$|In his 1984 {{edition of}} the play for The Oxford Shakespeare, Eugene M. Waith argued for Shakespeare's sole authorship. Believing that Titus was Shakespeare's first attempt at tragedy, he argued that any lapses can be {{attributed}} to uncertainty and inexperience rather than co-authorship. Brian Vickers, however, is highly critical of Waith's analysis, attacking his [...] "blanket refusal either to report the case for co-authorship fairly, or to engage in a <b>series</b> <b>evaluation</b> of its arguments." [...] He also believes that Waith's [...] "evidence consists largely in suppressing the evidence of other scholars." [...] In the Oxford Shakespeare Complete Works of 1986, in his introduction to the play, Stanley Wells makes no reference to the authorship debate whatsoever, but in the 1987 Textual Companion, Gary Taylor explicitly states that Shakespeare appears to have written only part of the play. Accepting the evidence of feminine endings which seem to suggest that Shakespeare did not write Act 1, 2.1 and 4.1, Taylor supported Jackson's findings in 1979.|$|E
