This makes it desirable to observe and control these properties in real time during the deposition. Here we show {{for the first time}} the evolution of the band gap and the sub band gap defect absorption of CIGS thin film as well as surface roughness during a three stage co evaporation process by means of an optical analysis technique, based on white light reflectometry WLR. By simultaneously recording structural information with in situ energy dispersive X ray diffraction and X ray fluorescence we can directly correlate the evolution of opto electronic material parameters with the structural properties of the film during growth. We find that the surface roughness and the <b>sub</b> gap <b>light</b> absorption can be correlated with the phase evolution during the transformation from In,Ga 2 Se 3 to Cu In,Ga Se 2 by the incorporation of Cu into the film. <b>Sub</b> bandgap <b>light</b> absorption is found to be influenced by the Cusaturated growth phase and is lowered close to the points of stoichiometry, allowing for an advanced process desig...|$|R

40|$|All {{photovoltaic}} {{solar cells}} transmit photons with energies below the absorption threshold bandgap of the absorber material, which are therefore usually {{lost for the}} purpose of solar energy conversion. Upconversion UC devices can harvest this unused <b>sub</b> threshold <b>light</b> behind the solar cell, and create one higher energy photon out of at least two transmitted photons. This higher energy photon is radiated back towards the solar cell, thus expanding the utilization of the solar spectrum. Key requirements for UC units are a broad absorption and high UC quantum yield under low intensity incoherent illumination, as relevant to solar energy conversion devices, as well as long term photostability. Upconversion by triplet triplet annihilation TTA in organic chromophores has proven to fulfil the first two basic requirements, and first proof of concept applications in photovoltaic conversion as well as photo electro chemical energy storage have been demonstrated. Here we review the basic concept of TTA UC and its application in the field of solar energy harvesting, and assess the challenges and prospects for its large scale application, including the long term photostability of TTA upconversion material...|$|R

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this thesis will be to explore the `model space' of Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) Dark Matter (DM), using {{simplified}} models {{in order to make}} some general statements on the allowed parameter space and to guide future detection efforts. The context for this thesis is a time in which many experiments are attempting, either directly or indirectly, to pin down the interactions of DM with the very precisely measured standard model. So far no robust signals have been found. Depending on your particular tastes, you may hold out for one particular realization of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics (e. g. Supersymmetry) and explore its rich phenomenology to ever increasing precision. But as time marches on, with diminishing confidence in discovery despite concerted efforts, you may instead look for ways in which to explore all possible realizations at once, a bottom-up approach, to help guide future searches and model building efforts. This is the utility of simplified models. We will show that much of the parameter space of a neutral thermal WIMP (with arbitrary spin, spanning a complete set of simplified models) is heavily constrained by a combination of indirect/direct searches. Inevitably, carrying out such a study requires many assumptions, not all of them sound all of the time. To test the robustness of the study we will take an in-depth phenomenological look at a more detailed model, tackling many of the assumptions of simplified models (such as minimal flavour violation and gauge-invariance). We will take several detours along the way. We will show that the next generation of direct detections machines will be sensitive detectors for <b>light</b> (<b>sub</b> GeV) new particles in the neutrino sector. We will also consider how heavy flavour observables might be impacted by the breakdown of the assumption of quark-hadron duality, rather than from genuine new physics...|$|R
