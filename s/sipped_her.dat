60|$|Marcia {{suddenly}} withdrew her glance, laughed {{softly to}} herself and <b>sipped</b> <b>her</b> wine.|$|E
60|$|So she {{sat down}} and <b>sipped</b> <b>her</b> tea, and ate a little, in silence. She was thinking.|$|E
60|$|Tuppence <b>sipped</b> <b>her</b> {{coffee with}} a deeply {{reflective}} air, and snubbed Tommy {{when he spoke}} to her.|$|E
6000|$|We went forward, and {{unlatched}} {{the kitchen}} door. The great-aunt {{was seated in}} her little, round-backed armchair, <b>sipping</b> <b>her</b> [...] "night-cap." ...|$|R
60|$|There she sat, <b>sipping</b> <b>her</b> tea {{and eating}} her toast, {{with her feet}} upon the fender, while Mr. O'Mahony ate his mutton-chop and drank his whisky and water.|$|R
60|$|She {{had read}} this letter once, and now while <b>sipping</b> <b>her</b> second {{cup of coffee}} was reading it again, {{when the door opened}} and Tom Starbrow walked into the room.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, we're {{behaving}} shockingly, {{all three}} of us!" [...] Philippa declared, as she <b>sipped</b> <b>her</b> champagne {{and leaned back in}} her seat.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{what may}} that be, Jeff? Something very awful, I daresay," [...] remarked my mother, {{with a look}} of interest, as she <b>sipped</b> <b>her</b> tea.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Thain {{preserves}} the instincts of the savage," [...] the Duchess observed, as she <b>sipped</b> <b>her</b> wine. [...] "Perhaps {{he may be}} right. Civilisation certainly tends to emasculate sport." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Cis, how {{you have}} grown!" [...] she said, leaning {{back in her chair}} and leisurely <b>sipping</b> <b>her</b> tea. [...] "I declare I had no idea that I had a son your height, sir! Had you, Lord Penraven?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Gwendolen did {{not speak}} immediately, but after <b>sipping</b> <b>her</b> coffee, {{answered}} brusquely, [...] "Oh no, let it be; I will write to-morrow." [...] Then, feeling a touch of compunction, {{she looked up and}} said with playful tenderness, [...] "Dear, old, beautiful mamma!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said, {{arranging}} herself comfortably, and <b>sipping</b> <b>her</b> tea, while Susan busied herself {{putting away}} her lady's [...] "things," [...] and otherwise tidying the room, [...] "it {{does not always}} rain here; {{there is a little}} sunshine sometimes. By the way, where is Miss Gray?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The man, who was Charl, {{shook his}} head absently. [...] "I've been here this last hour, hain't I, Nance?" [...] {{he said to the}} woman who meditatively <b>sipped</b> <b>her</b> ale near him.|$|E
6000|$|... "This," [...] Anna declared, as she <b>sipped</b> <b>her</b> {{wine and}} looked around her, [...] "reminds me more of Paris than any place I have yet seen. I suppose it is the mirrors and decorations." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It won't be good, and Mr. Greystock won't {{think you}} good, if you don't come and eat your breakfast." [...] So Lucy was led {{back into the}} parlour, and <b>sipped</b> <b>her</b> tea and crunched her toast, while Lydia came and stood over her.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Merrick was in {{a morning}} wrapper, <b>sipping</b> <b>her</b> coffee in an upper room. But she could not deny herself to Uncle John, her dead husband's brother and her only daughter's benefactor (which meant {{indirectly}} her own benefactor), so she ordered the maid to show him up at once.|$|R
6000|$|And {{the happy}} young {{housewife}} {{does not know}} That the woman beside her was first his choice, Till the fates ordained {{it could not be}} so [...] . Betraying nothing in look or voice The guest sits smiling and <b>sips</b> <b>her</b> tea, And he throws her a stray glance yearningly.|$|R
60|$|Caroline did {{not answer}} her husband immediately, but went on {{buttering}} <b>her</b> toast, and <b>sipping</b> <b>her</b> tea. She had never yet disobeyed any positive order that he had given, and she was now thinking whether she could obey this order; or, if not, how she would explain to him {{that she could not}} do so.|$|R
60|$|Eleanor was {{herself the}} widow of a medical man and felt a little {{inclined}} to resent all these hard sayings. But Miss Thorne was so essentially good-natured {{that it was impossible}} to resent anything she said. She therefore <b>sipped</b> <b>her</b> wine and finished her chicken.|$|E
60|$|Meg <b>sipped</b> <b>her</b> tea--confessed Hannah's {{skill in}} {{the mysteries of}} the Chinese herb--sipped again, then tried to eat a bit of bread and butter, with very {{indifferent}} success; and notwithstanding the lawyer's compliments to her good looks, seemed in reality, on the point of becoming ill.|$|E
60|$|Margharita <b>sipped</b> <b>her</b> tea quietly, {{and made}} no reply; but in the firelight her dark eyes glowed softly and brightly, and Lady St. Maurice was quite {{satisfied}} with her silence. For a few moments neither of them spoke. Then Lady St. Maurice {{leaned back in her}} chair, away from the firelight, and asked a question.|$|E
60|$|She <b>sipped</b> distastefully <b>her</b> brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped, sweet tea.|$|R
6000|$|He had met Tanis's friends; he had, {{with the}} ardent haste of the Midnight People, who drink and dance and rattle and are ever {{afraid to be}} silent, been adopted {{as a member of}} her group, which they called [...] "The Bunch." [...] He first met them after a day when he had worked {{particularly}} hard and when he hoped to be quiet with Tanis and slowly <b>sip</b> <b>her</b> admiration.|$|R
60|$|She took a <b>sip</b> from <b>her</b> glass, and {{the feeling}} that he had been going to laugh passed away.|$|R
6000|$|... "I should hate to do it," [...] replied Shirley, [...] "but I think I {{could do}} it, if goaded by certain exigencies which I can imagine." [...] And Miss Keeldar quietly <b>sipped</b> <b>her</b> glass of new milk, looking {{somewhat}} thoughtful {{and a little}} pale; though, indeed, when did she not look pale? She was never florid.|$|E
60|$|What {{a bright}} {{afternoon}} that little gift made {{in that little}} room! How much faster Mary's fingers flew the livelong day as she sat sewing by her mother! and Mrs. Stephens, in the happiness of her child, almost forgot {{that she had a}} headache, and thought, as she <b>sipped</b> <b>her</b> evening cup of tea, that she felt stronger than she had done for some time.|$|E
6000|$|She {{looked at}} me in silence for some moments, with her face {{gradually}} softening into a smile. Seeming to fear {{that she had been}} too gloomy, and seeming also to lose the connexion in her mind, she said politely as she <b>sipped</b> <b>her</b> glass of wine, [...] "Yes, my dear, as I was saying, I expect a judgment shortly. Then I shall release my birds, you know, and confer estates." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'As we {{are quite}} {{confidential}} here, Mr. Copperfield,' said Mrs. Micawber, <b>sipping</b> <b>her</b> punch, 'Mr. Traddles {{being a part}} of our domesticity, I should much like to have your opinion on Mr. Micawber's prospects. For corn,' said Mrs. Micawber argumentatively, 'as I have repeatedly said to Mr. Micawber, may be gentlemanly, but it is not remunerative. Commission to the extent of two and ninepence in a fortnight cannot, however limited our ideas, be considered remunerative.' ...|$|R
6000|$|In {{this moment}} Virginia {{perceived}} {{that her mother}} was of the same nature with Mrs. McBride--not one whit more refined--and the gulf between them swiftly widened. Hastily <b>sipping</b> <b>her</b> coffee, she tried hard to keep back the tears, but failed; and no sooner did her mother turn away than she fled to her room, there to sob unrestrainedly her despair and shame. [...] "Oh, I can't stand it," [...] she called. [...] "I can't! I can't!" ...|$|R
60|$|They were {{assembled}} in Cleopatra's room The Serpent of old Nile (not to mention her disrespectfully) was reposing on <b>her</b> sofa, <b>sipping</b> <b>her</b> morning chocolate {{at three o'clock}} in the afternoon, and Flowers the Maid was fastening on her youthful cuffs and frills, and performing a kind of private coronation ceremony on her, with a peach-coloured velvet bonnet; the artificial roses in which nodded to uncommon advantage, as the palsy trifled with them, like a breeze.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well it ayn't {{exactly the}} right ticket, Mrs Trotman, I believe," [...] said Mick, bowing gallantly to the lady; [...] "but 'pon my soul I am so thirsty, that I'll take Chaffing Jack at his word;" [...] and so saying Mick and Devilsdust ensconced {{themselves}} in the bar, while good-hearted Mrs Carey, <b>sipped</b> <b>her</b> glass of gin and water, which she frequently protested was a pool of Bethesda.|$|E
60|$|A {{crash of}} martial {{music from the}} band filled the air with ringing melody, {{and for a moment}} they sat silent. Ughtred took up his as yet unlit cigarette, and Sara <b>sipped</b> <b>her</b> coffee. Around them were little groups of men and brilliantly-dressed women. The {{pleasant}} hum of conversation and light laughter came to them with something of an inspiring ring. Down the broad promenade two men were walking. Sara touched her companion on the arm with her fan.|$|E
60|$|Maud <b>sipped</b> <b>her</b> tea in silence. Her {{heart was}} like lead within her. The {{recurrence}} {{of the butter}} theme {{as a sort of}} leit motif in her companion's conversation was fraying her nerves till she felt she could endure little more. She cast her mind's eye back over the horrid months and had a horrid vision of Geoffrey steadily absorbing butter, day after day, week after week--ever becoming more and more of a human keg. She shuddered.|$|E
60|$|She {{had handed}} over his coffee-cup, and was <b>sipping</b> at <b>her</b> own, glancing furtively through her narrowed lids at the austere face of her brother.|$|R
6000|$|Again I {{looked at}} Jane, {{and saw that}} {{although}} she was <b>sipping</b> <b>her</b> tea and had some bacon upon her plate she had eaten nothing at all. Like the catch of a song echoed through my brain that fearsome sentence: [...] "It {{is a terrible thing}} to have one's child die of the smallpox." [...] Terrible, indeed, for now I had little doubt but that Jane was infected, and if she should chance to die, then what should I be? I should be her murderer! ...|$|R
25|$|In Corner of a Cafe Concert, a man smokes while {{behind him}} a {{waitress}} serves drinks. In The Beer Drinkers a woman enjoys her {{beer in the}} company of a friend. In The Cafe Concert, shown at right, a sophisticated gentleman sits at a bar while a waitress stands resolutely in the background, <b>sipping</b> <b>her</b> drink. In The Waitress, a serving woman pauses for a moment behind a seated customer smoking a pipe, while a ballet dancer, with arms extended as she is about to turn, is on stage in the background.|$|R
