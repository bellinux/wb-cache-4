5000|$|The {{first part}} of the pulse sequence, SS, {{achieves}} [...] "slice selection". A <b>shaped</b> <b>pulse</b> (shown here with a sinc modulation) causes a 90° nutation of longitudinal nuclear magnetization within a slab, or slice, creating transverse magnetization. The second part of the pulse sequence, PE, imparts a phase shift upon the slice-selected nuclear magnetization, varying with its location in the Y direction. The third part of the pulse sequence, another slice selection (of the same slice) uses another <b>shaped</b> <b>pulse</b> to cause a 180° rotation of transverse nuclear magnetization within the slice. This transverse magnetisation refocuses to form a spin echo at a time TE. During the spin echo, a frequency-encoding (FE) or readout gradient is applied, making the resonant frequency of the nuclear magnetization vary with its location in the X direction. The signal is sampled nFE times by the ADC during this period, as represented by the vertical lines. Typically nFE of between 128 and 512 samples are taken.|$|E

5000|$|A multibeam {{echosounder}} is {{a device}} typically used by hydrographic surveyors {{to determine the}} depth of water {{and the nature of}} the seabed. Most modern systems work by transmitting a broad acoustic fan <b>shaped</b> <b>pulse</b> from a specially designed transducer across the full swath acrosstrack with a narrow alongtrack then forming multiple receive beams (beamforming) that are much narrower in the acrosstrack (around 1 degree depending on the system).

If the speed of sound in water is known for the full water column profile, the depth and position of the return signal can be determined from the receive angle and the two-way travel time.|$|E
