5|$|Although {{there are}} many Cortinarius species {{with some degree of}} violet colour, C.violaceus and its close {{relatives}} are easily distinguished by their much darker purple colour. Cortinarius iodes of the southeastern United <b>States</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> slimy purple cap and paler violet stipe. The other species in the section Cortinarius are dark purple and superficially similar, but can be differentiated based on host and geography as they do not occur in the same locations as C. violaceus. Certain Leptonia species in northwestern North America, including L. carnea and L. nigroviolacea, have a similar color, but are easily differentiated due to their pink spore print.|$|E

25|$|A tax protester {{is someone}} who refuses to pay a tax {{claiming}} that the tax laws are unconstitutional or otherwise invalid.

The United <b>States</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> large and organized culture of people who espouse such theories. Tax protesters also exist in other countries.|$|E

Among wars with high death tolls from disease is the Civil War where an estimated 620,000 soldiers died from disease. American soldiers in other countries have spread diseases which ultimately disrupted entire societies and healthcare systems with famine and poverty.|$|E
25|$|The United <b>States</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> {{history of}} {{recognizing}} and celebrating Hanukkah {{in a number}} of ways.

(Monseratte would be acquitted of the felonies, but was convicted on misdemeanors.) Espada {{was the target of}} a state investigation into whether he funded his campaign with money siphoned from a nonprofit health care agency he controls. The Bronx County District Attorney's office was also investigating charges that Espada actually resided in Mamaroneck, Westchester County rather than the north Bronx district he represented.|$|E
25|$|One {{example of}} a quantum {{interference}} phenomenon that arises from superposition is the double-slit experiment. The photon state is a superposition of two different states, one of which corresponds to the photon having passed through the left slit, and the other corresponding to passage through the right slit. The relative phase of those two <b>states</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> value which depends on the distance {{from each of the}} two slits. Depending on what that phase is, the interference is constructive at some locations and destructive in others, creating the interference pattern. By the analogy with coherence in other wave phenomena, a superposed state can be referred to as a coherent superposition.|$|E
