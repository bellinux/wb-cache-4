5|$|Houston pioneered American car {{culture in}} the early 1900s thanks to the ready {{availability}} of inexpensive gasoline. By the 1920s traffic congestion had become so serious that the city became {{the first in the}} nation to install interconnected traffic lights. Visitors to the city were often astonished at the lack of pedestrian access to shopping venues and the importance of the automobile within the city. Though mass transit had been successful in Houston's earlier years, later efforts aimed at promoting mass transit and urban planning were largely defeated in Houston because of opposition by the public, which favored public investment in roads over mass transit. Urban concepts pioneered in Houston, like establishing shopping centers outside the city's core and encouraging <b>suburban</b> <b>sprawl,</b> became major trends adopted in many cities, both within the state and around the country.|$|E
5|$|Other approaches, {{loosely based}} around New Urbanism, are {{successfully}} reducing environmental impacts by altering {{the built environment}} to create and preserve sustainable cities which support sustainable transport. Residents in compact urban neighborhoods drive fewer miles, and have significantly lower environmental impacts {{across a range of}} measures, compared with those living in sprawling suburbs. In sustainable architecture the recent movement of New Classical Architecture promotes a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops smart growth, architectural tradition and classical design. This in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture, as well as opposing solitary housing estates and <b>suburban</b> <b>sprawl.</b> Both trends started in the 1980s. The concept of Circular flow land use management has also been introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land take by urban sprawl.|$|E
5|$|Since {{as early}} as 1967, local {{officials}} have discussed building a Manchester bypass, either as a separate project {{or as part of}} a road bypassing both Hampstead and Manchester. However, by the mid-1970s, the town of Manchester decided it did not want the bypass. The bypass was planned to pass to the west of Manchester, but the town allowed a residential subdivision to be built along the bypass route. The planned bypass route was eventually changed to be east of town. After two decades of disagreement by the town and county over the path of the bypass, in 1993 the bypass was placed in the town's master plan. However, state support for the Manchester bypass was scrapped in 1998 by Smart Growth proponent and governor Parris Glendening, who said the bypass would promote <b>suburban</b> <b>sprawl.</b> The Manchester Bypass is neither in the Maryland Department of Transportation's Consolidated Transportation Program for 2012 to 2017 nor in MDSHA's 2011 Highway Needs Inventory for the next 20 years.|$|E

50|$|After {{the county}} {{consolidated}} {{by mutual agreement}} with the small resort city of Virginia Beach in 1963, and assumed the latters name, explosive growth during the 1960s and 1970s transformed Kempsville into a <b>sprawling</b> <b>suburban</b> community of the largest independent city in Virginia.|$|R
50|$|The {{old city}} centre {{has been largely}} preserved, unlike the suburbs. There has been no clear {{planning}} by the city councillors regarding expansion, and the <b>sprawling</b> <b>suburban</b> areas are irregularly constructed, {{with the addition of}} 1970s-style high rise blocks in many places.|$|R
25|$|The 2000 census {{showed that}} Reading's {{population}} decline had ceased. This {{was attributed to}} an influx of Hispanic residents from New York City, {{as well as from}} the extension of <b>suburban</b> <b>sprawl</b> from Philadelphia's northwest suburbs.|$|E

40|$|Lack of {{coordination}} between transport {{and land use}} in developing countries creates a variety of complications in the urban form. Due to this mismatch, vehicle ownership is uncontrollably rising, generating hyper-congestion on the road network. <b>Suburban</b> <b>sprawling</b> {{is one of the}} adverse outcomes of the transport-land use mismatch, which increases trip lengths and thereby supports traffic gridlocks in the urban areas. This paper proposes a satellite centre-based telecommuting as a solution for easing congestion in developing countries by exploring the link between travel behaviour and urban form. The investigation is conducted in two stages. In the first stage, the household travel behaviour in developing countries is analysed by using a nested logit (NL) model of two levels. The upper level is characterized by car-owning, motorcycle owning and no vehicle-owning choices. The lower level consists of household related travel choices. In the second stage, the developed NL model is applied for a telecommuting policy by locating new satellite centres outside the CBD. The satellite locations are chosen considering the travel convenience, urban form and the existing road network. The impacts of the policy are assessed in terms of vehicle kilometres travelled (VKT) and emissions considering Bangkok Metropolitan Region as a case study. ...|$|R
5000|$|Millburn and Short Hills (a {{hamlet of}} Millburn) {{lie to the}} south of Livingston which itself is south of {{mainstream}} West Essex. The town of Millburn, like Livingston, is geographically on the western border of Essex County. However, it is usually not considered to be part of [...] "West Essex", which implies the northwestern area of Essex County that was originally known as Horseneck. The southwestern Essex County towns, like Livingston and Millburn, are generally considered to have developed as <b>suburban</b> Newark <b>sprawl,</b> as opposed to the Horseneck area which originally developed independently.|$|R
25|$|Melbourne's {{population}} density declined following the Second World War, {{with the private}} motor car and the lures of space and property ownership causing a <b>suburban</b> <b>sprawl,</b> mainly eastward. After much discussion both at general public and planning levels in the 1980s, the decline has reversed since the recession of the early 1990s.|$|E

50|$|Controlled-access {{highways}} {{have been}} constructed both between major cities as well as within them, leading to the <b>sprawling</b> <b>suburban</b> development found near most modern cities. Highways have been heavily criticized by environmentalists, urbanists, and preservationists for the noise,pollution, and economic shifts they bring.Additionally, they have been criticized by the driving public for the inefficiency with which they handle peak hour traffic.|$|R
25|$|The dam {{was built}} to serve the purpose of flood control, {{irrigation}} and municipal water use. With heavy <b>suburban</b> <b>sprawl</b> downstream encroaching since the 1960s, agriculture along lower Santiago Creek has practically ceased. It is currently owned by the Irvine Ranch Water District and the Serrano Water District (the former Serrano Irrigation District). Today the dam marks the usual ending point of surface flow in Santiago Creek, as all the discharge is retained in the reservoir and downstream flow is limited to seepage and stormwater.|$|E
