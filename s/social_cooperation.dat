25|$|This {{clash of}} {{perspectives}} led to {{something of a}} stand-off {{and a lack of}} communication between the disciplines, resulting in little cooperation and progress for three decades. The stand-off was resolved by Holland's Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship which re-visited biological inclusive fitness theory to draw a distinction between the statistical evolutionary mechanisms for the emergence of social traits and the non-deterministic proximate mechanisms through which they are expressed. In a strict interpretation of the theory, a statistical association of related genes (as would be present in the interactions of close genetic relatives) is understood as a necessary (though not sufficient) condition for the evolutionary emergence of certain traits relating to <b>social</b> <b>cooperation</b> (see kin selection). However, this does not entail that the proximate mechanisms governing the expression of such social traits in primates and humans necessarily depends on (or are determined by) conditions of genetic relatedness per se. For the vast majority of social mammals—including primates and humans—the formation of social bonds (and the resulting <b>social</b> <b>cooperation)</b> are based on familiarity from an early developmental stage, and the same kinds of mechanisms that attachment theorists (see above) have outlined. In short, in humans and in other primates, genetic relatedness is not necessary for the attachment bonds to develop, and it is the performance of nurture that underlies such bonds and the enduring <b>social</b> <b>cooperation</b> that typically accompanies them (see Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship).|$|E
25|$|Finally, the stag hunt game in Fig. 5 shows a {{situation}} in which both players (hunters) can benefit if they cooperate (hunting a stag).

This example of the potential conflict between safety and <b>social</b> <b>cooperation</b> is originally due to Jean-Jacques Rousseau.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century Pashtun society was colonized, stagnant, violent, worn down by feuds, inequalities, factionalism, poor <b>social</b> <b>cooperation,</b> and plain ignorance. Education opportunities were strictly limited. Pashtuns are Muslims; and religious leaders and Mullahs were known to have told parents that if their children went to school, they would go to hell. Khan stated that “the real purpose of this propaganda” was to keep Pashtuns “illiterate and uneducated”, and hence his people “were the most backward in India” with regard to education. He also stated that by the time Islam reached his people centuries earlier, it had lost much of its original spiritual message.|$|E
25|$|A famous {{example of}} this type of game was called the stag hunt; in the game two players may choose to hunt a stag or a rabbit, the former {{providing}} more meat (4 utility units) than the latter (1 utility unit). The caveat is that the stag must be cooperatively hunted, so if one player attempts to hunt the stag, while the other hunts the rabbit, he will fail in hunting (0 utility units), whereas if they both hunt it they will split the payload (2, 2). The game hence exhibits two equilibria at (stag, stag) and (rabbit, rabbit) and hence the players' optimal strategy depend on their expectation on what the other player may do. If one hunter trusts that the other will hunt the stag, they should hunt the stag; however if they suspect that the other will hunt the rabbit, they should hunt the rabbit. This game was used as an analogy for <b>social</b> <b>cooperation,</b> since much of the benefit that people gain in society depends upon people cooperating and implicitly trusting one another to act in a manner corresponding with cooperation.|$|E
25|$|The {{very first}} South-Eastern European Pride, called The Internationale Pride, {{was assumed to}} be a {{promotion}} of the human right to freedom of assembly in Croatia and some Eastern European states, where such rights of the LGBT population are not respected, and a support for organising the very first Prides in that communities. Out of all ex-Yugoslav states, at that time only Slovenia and Croatia had a tradition of organising Pride events, whereas the attempt to organize such an event in Belgrade, Serbia in 2001, ended in a bloody showdown between the police and the counter-protesters, with the participants heavily beaten up. This manifestation was held in Zagreb, Croatia from June 22–25, 2006 and brought together representatives of those Eastern European and Southeastern European countries where the sociopolitical climate is not ripe for the organization of Prides, or where such a manifestation is expressly forbidden by the authorities. From 13 countries that participated, only Poland, Slovenia, Croatia, Romania and Latvia have been organizing Prides. Slovakia also hosted the pride, but encountered many problems with Slovak extremists from Slovenska pospolitost (the pride did not cross the centre of the city). Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republic of Macedonia, Albania and Lithuania have never had Prides before. There were also representatives from Kosovo, that participated apart from Serbia. It was the very first Pride organized jointly with other states and nations, which only ten years ago have been at war with each other. Weak cultural, political and <b>social</b> <b>cooperation</b> exists among these states, with an obvious lack of public encouragement for solidarity, which organizers hoped to initiate through that regional Pride event. The host and the initiator of The Internationale LGBT Pride was Zagreb Pride, which has been held since 2002.|$|E
40|$|The idea of {{this paper}} is an {{advanced}} game concept. This concept is expected to model non-monetary bilateral cooperations between self-interested agents. Such non-monetary cases are <b>social</b> <b>cooperations</b> like allocation of high level jobs or sexual relationships among humans. In a barter double auction, there is a big amount of agents. Every agent has a vector of parameters which specifies his demand and a vector which specifies his offer. Two agents can achieve a commitment through barter exchange. The subjective satisfaction level (a number between 0 % and 100 %) of an agent is as high as small is the distance between his demand and the accepted offer. This paper introduces some facets of this complex game concept. ...|$|R

2500|$|A common {{model of}} {{altruism}} and <b>social</b> <b>cooperation</b> is the Prisoner's dilemma. [...] Here {{a group of}} players would collectively {{be better off if}} they could play Cooperate, but since Defect fares better each individual player has an incentive to play Defect. [...] One solution to this problem is to introduce the possibility of retaliation by having individuals play the game repeatedly against the same player. [...] In the so-called iterated Prisoner's dilemma, the same two individuals play the prisoner's dilemma over and over. [...] While the Prisoner's dilemma has only two strategies (Cooperate and Defect), the iterated Prisoner's dilemma has a huge number of possible strategies. [...] Since an individual can have different contingency plan for each history and the game may be repeated an indefinite number of times, there may in fact be an infinite number of such contingency plans.|$|E
2500|$|Political philosopher John Gray {{identified}} the common strands in liberal thought as being individualist, egalitarian, meliorist and universalist. The individualist element avers the ethical {{primacy of the}} human being against the pressures of social collectivism, the egalitarian element assigns the same moral worth and status to all individuals, the meliorist element asserts that successive generations can improve their sociopolitical arrangements, and the universalist element affirms the moral unity of the human species and marginalises local cultural differences. The meliorist element {{has been the subject of}} much controversy, defended by thinkers such as Immanuel Kant, who believed in human progress, while suffering criticism by thinkers such as Rousseau, who believed that human attempts to improve themselves through <b>social</b> <b>cooperation</b> would fail.

2500|$|Holland {{subsequently}} {{showed that}} Schneider's intuition {{in regard to}} the 'scientific facts' was correct. In evolutionary biology, the theory treating the evolution of <b>social</b> <b>cooperation</b> emerged in a formal version in the 1960s and 1970s in the form of inclusive fitness theory, and a related theory, kin selection. The theory specifies that one criterion for the evolution of certain kinds of social traits is a statistical association of identical genes, as would exist when close genetic relatives associate with one another. Early applications of the theory applied to humans (darwinian anthropology) took as their starting position the former anthropological perspective that human kinship is fundamentally [...] "based on" [...] blood-ties. However, these extensions emerged at precisely the time that anthropology was reflexively critiquing this [...] "blood" [...] assumption behind traditional kinship theorizing. This reversion to [...] "blood" [...] led some anthropologists to strongly attack the emerging biological perspectives as suffering the same ethnocentric assumptions (e.g., [...] "blood is thicker than water") that the anthropologists themselves had recently eschewed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{question}} for Deacon is what behavioral-environmental changes {{could have made}} the development of symbolic thinking adaptive? Here he {{emphasizes the importance of}} distinguishing humans from all other species, not to privilege human intelligence but to problematize it. Given that the evolution of H. sapiens began with ancestors who did not yet have [...] "culture," [...] what led them to move away from cognitive, learning, communication, and tool-making strategies that were and continued to be adaptive for most other primates (and, some have suggested, most other species of animals)? [...] Learning symbol systems is more time consuming than other forms of communication, so symbolic thought made possible a different communication strategy, but not a more efficient one than other primates. Nevertheless, it must have offered some selective advantage to H. sapiens to have evolved. Deacon starts by looking at two key determinants in evolutionary history: foraging behavior, and patterns of sexual relations. As he observes competition for sexual access limits the possibilities for <b>social</b> <b>cooperation</b> in many species; yet, Deacon observes, there are three consistent patterns in human reproduction that distinguish them from other species: ...|$|E
2500|$|Emulation {{learning}} and imitative learning {{are two different}} adaptations {{that can only be}} assessed in their larger environmental and evolutionary contexts. In one experiment, chimpanzees and two-year-old children were separately presented with a rake-like-tool and an out-of-reach object. [...] Adult humans then demonstrated two different ways to use the tool, one more efficient, one less efficient. Chimpanzees used the same efficient method following both demonstrations, regardless of what was demonstrated. Most of the human children, however, imitated whichever method the adult was demonstrating. If the chimps and humans were to be compared {{on the basis of these}} results, one might think that chimpanzees are more intelligent. From an evolutionary perspective they are equally intelligent, but with different kinds of intelligence adapted to different environments. Chimpanzee learning strategies are well-suited to a stable physical environment that requires little <b>social</b> <b>cooperation</b> (compared to humans). Human learning strategies are well-suited to a more complex social environment in which understanding the intentions of others may be more important than success at a specific task. [...] Tomasello argues that this strategy has made possible the [...] "ratchet effect" [...] that enabled humans to evolve complex social systems that have enabled humans to adapt to virtually every physical environment on the surface of the earth.|$|E
