5|$|NuScale {{designs and}} markets small modular nuclear {{reactors}} that the Department of Energy {{expects to be}} commercially available around 2025. Its designs use the light water approach to cooling and power generation that is common in conventional nuclear plants. Water is heated by the nuclear core {{at the base of}} the reactor vessel. Heated water flows upwards inside the riser, then down over <b>steam</b> <b>generators.</b> As heat is transferred to <b>steam</b> <b>generators,</b> the water becomes cooler and denser, sinking back to the bottom of the device, where the cycle is repeated. Heat transferred to the <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> is used to create steam that turns a turbine, which drives an electrical generator.|$|E

The initial order was for 15 {{locomotives}} with <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> and 11 with head-end power, but 9 of the first type were switched to using head-end power as Amtrak ramped up acquisition of Amfleet cars. Amtrak anticipated that E60-hauled Amfleet trains could displace both the GG1s and the mechanically-unreliable Metroliners.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} {{derailments}} {{in the mid-1970s}} shattered Amtrak's confidence in the locomotive, and many railroads banned it from their tracks. Multiple investigations pointed to issues with the locomotive's trucks, {{the weight of the}} water and <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> used for train heating, or the vibration of baggage cars behind the locomotive. In 1977 Amtrak decided to move on from the SDP40F in favor of the EMD F40PH, which was already in use on short-distance routes. Amtrak traded most of its fleet into EMD; the components were incorporated into new F40PHs. The remainder were traded to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (ATSF) for use in freight service. The Santa Fe rebuilt the locomotives and designated them SDF40-2. The Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway (BNSF), successor to the Santa Fe, retired them in 2002.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two main}} types of <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> irons, {{pressurised}} and non-pressurised. A non-pressurised <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> iron will produce a lot of steam but the steam is released at a lower speed, typically around 80-100 grams per minute. A pressurised <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> iron, on the other hand, creates a highly pressurised environment that helps the steam penetrate fabric more efficiently. A pressurised <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> iron will typically have a steam output of 100-120 grams per minute. The amount of pressure a <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> iron has is measured in bars, with a higher bar number meaning the steam has more pressure. <b>Steam</b> <b>generator</b> irons typically have 3-6 bars of pressure.|$|R

30|$|Many robots, {{including}} climbing robots, {{are designed}} for nuclear stations [10 – 17]. A <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> is the key device in a nuclear power station in which heat is passed from the coolant in the primary circuit to {{the water in the}} secondary circuit to generate high-pressure and high-temperature steam for electricity. The <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> is a huge cylindrical object with a 3 m diameter, and to enhance the efficiency of heat exchange, thousands of tubes are inside of it, making it a fragile device vulnerable to various problems. To make sure the <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> works safely, it needs to be inspected annually. The key problem we need to solve is to get pictures of tubes which are inside of the <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> secondary side in real time. The inner structure of the <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> makes it impossible to check it manually, because the space is too small for person to fit. Obrutsky [18] summarized some technologies for <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> tube inspection. So a robot with cameras which could move inside the <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> secondary side is very convenient. It should be noted that broken tubes can be repaired conveniently. Therefore, the real-time positioning of the vehicle is meaningful.|$|R
25|$|Plants {{that use}} gas {{turbines}} {{to heat the}} water for conversion into steam use boilers known as heat recovery <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> (HRSG).

40|$|The {{horizontal}} <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> (SG) is one {{of specific}} features of Russian-type pressurized water reactors (VVERs). The main advantages of horizontal <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> are connected with low steam loads on evaporation surface, simple separation scheme and high circulation ratio. The complex three-dimensional steam-water flows in the <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> vessel influence significantly the processes of the steam separation, distribution, and deposition of the soluble and nonsoluble impurities and determine the efficiency and reliability of the <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> operation. The 3 D code for simulation of the three-dimensional steam-water flows in the <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> could be effective tool for design and optimization of the horizontal <b>steam</b> <b>generator.</b> The results of the code calculations are determined mainly by {{the set of the}} correlations describing interaction of the steam-water mixture with the inner constructions of the SG and interfacial friction. The results obtained by 3 D code STEG with the usage of the different interfacial friction correlations are presented and discussed in the paper.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Steam</b> <b>generator</b> in {{a nuclear}} power plant is huge heat {{exchanger}} that transfers heat from reactor to make steam to drive turbine-generator. Failure of the <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> tubes can result in the release of fission products to the secondary side. Therefore, accurate integrity assessment of the cracked <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> tubes is of great importance for maintaining the safety of the nuclear power plant. This paper provides limit loads for circumferential through-wall cracks in <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> tubes under combined internal pressure and bending loads. Such limit loads are developed on the basis of three dimensional finite element analyses assuming elastic-perfectly plastic material behavior. As for the crack location, both the top of the tubesheet and U-bend regions are considered. The analysis results can be directly applied to the practical integrity assessment of cracked <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> tubes, because the comparison between experimental data and FE results shows a very good agreement...|$|R

40|$|After a {{postulated}} {{design basis}} accident leads high temperature gas cooled reactor to emergency shutdown, <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> still remains with high temperature level {{and needs to be}} cooled down by a precooling before reactor restarts with clearing of fault. For the large difference of coolant temperature between inlet and outlet of <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> in normal operation, the temperature distribution on the components of <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> is very complicated. Therefore, the temperature descending rate of the components in <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> needs to be limited to avoid the potential damage during the precooling stage. In this paper, a pebble-bed high temperature gas cooled reactor is modeled by thermal-hydraulic system analysis code and several postulated precooling injection transients are simulated and compared to evaluate their effects, which will provide support for the precooling design. The analysis results show that enough precooling injection is necessary to satisfy the precooling requirements, and larger mass flow rate of precooling water injection will accelerate the precooling process. The temperature decrease of <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> is related to the precooling injection scenarios, and the maximal mass flow rate of the precooling injection should be limited to avoid the excessively quick temperature change of the structures in <b>steam</b> <b>generator...</b>|$|R
40|$|After {{emergency}} shutdown of high-temperature-gas-cooled reactor, the residual {{heat of the}} reactor core should be removed.

During this procedure, the structure of <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> may suffer cold/heat shock because of the sudden load of coolant or hot helium at the first few minutes. Transient analysis was carried out based on a one-dimensional mathematical model for <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> and <b>steam</b> pipe of start-up loop to achieve safety and reliability. The results show that <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> should be discharged and precooled; otherwise, boiling will arise and introduce a cold shock to the boiling tubes and tube sheet when coolant began to circulate prior to the helium. Additionally, in avoiding heat shock caused by the sudden load of helium, the helium circulation should be restricted to start with an extreme low flow rate; meanwhile, the coolant of <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> (water) should have flow rate as large as possible.
