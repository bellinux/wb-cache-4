25|$|Cello {{manufacturer}} Luis & Clark constructs cellos from carbon fibre. Carbon fibre {{instruments are}} particularly <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>outdoor</b> playing {{because of the}} strength of the material and its resistance to humidity and temperature fluctuations. Luis & Clark has produced over 1000 cellos, some of which are owned by cellists such as Yo-Yo Ma and Josephine van Lier. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) as well as German luthier G.A. Pfretzschner produced an unknown number of aluminum cellos (in addition to aluminum double basses and violins).|$|E
25|$|Marimba {{bars are}} {{typically}} made of either wood or synthetic material. Rosewood {{is the most}} desirable, while Padauk is a popular affordable alternative. Bars made from synthetic materials generally fall short in sound quality in comparison to wooden bars, but are less expensive and yield added durability and weather resistance, making them <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>outdoor</b> use; marimbas with wooden bars are usually played inside because the bars are susceptible to pitch change due to weather. Bubinga (Guibourtia demeusei) and mahogany have also been cited as comparable to rosewood in quality for use as marimba bars. The specific rosewood, Dalbergia stevensonii, only grows in Southern Guatemala and Belize, formerly the British Honduras. This wood has a Janka rating of 2200, which is about three times harder than Silver Maple. The bars are wider and longer at the lowest pitched notes, and gradually get narrower and shorter as the notes get higher. During the tuning, wood is taken from the middle underside of the bar to lower the pitch. Because of this, the bars are also thinner in the lowest pitch register and thicker in the highest pitch register.|$|E
500|$|As {{a cheaper}} option the UX32A was praised by Chris Martin of PC Advisor for being [...] "a more {{affordable}} luxury", retaining the [...] "premium feel" [...] of the Zenbook range {{but at a}} lower price point. The aluminium chassis, which is identical to the UX32VD to keep costs down, was widely acclaimed for its strength and build quality. By contrast, the Sandy Bridge chip, a previous-generation part at the time of sale, was outlined as a detraction as was the lower battery life compared to the UX31E. Although the screen used was a TN panel and of a lower resolution than the UX32VD or UX31A, it was considered an acceptable compromise for the price. The screen has a matte finish and relatively high brightness which Notebook Check's reviewer, Christian Hepp, found [...] "quite <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>outdoor</b> use", noting that it had a good contrast ratio but a narrow range of colours.|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was to {{identify}} microalgae isolates <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> long-term <b>outdoor</b> cultivation at high salinities for biodiesel production. Screening and selection of locally collected halophilic microalgae isolates were based on the comparison of phenotypic traits such as growth rate, photosynthetic response and biomass productivity over a range of salinities, temperatures, light intensities and dissolved oxygen levels. Strain selection was also carried out in outdoor open raceway ponds. The prasinophyte Tetraselmis and benthic diatoms were the most abundant of the microalgal species isolated. Indoor and outdoor comparative studies between 6 Tetraselmis strains- MUR 167, 219, 230, 231, 232 and 233 - and the benthic diatom Amphora coffeaeformis MUR 158 showed that Tetraselmis was more suited <b>for</b> <b>outdoor</b> long-term cultivation in open raceway ponds.

40|$|The cost of {{building}} a digitizing system for image-based rendering can be prohibitive. Furthermore, the physical size, weight, and complexity of these systems has, in effect, limited their use to small objects and indoor scenes. The primary motivations for this project {{is to reduce the}} acquisition cost of light-field capture devices and create a portable system <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> acquiring <b>outdoor</b> scenes. This paper describes the design of such an apparatus using readily available parts. One of the strategies for reducing the system cost has been to rely on software to correct as many of the geometric and photometric inaccuracies as possible. The resulting light field acquisition device can be built for under $ 200. The presented light-field acquisition system employs a modified lowcost flatbed scanner.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new interaction metaphor we have termed “god-like interaction”.
