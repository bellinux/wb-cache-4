The Stephanhouser innovations include the <b>ScrewLess</b> pin design, which eliminates pivot screws in post rods and enhances instrument durability, a procedure for creating a saxophone bow out of a single piece of brass for a more resonant sound, and a more precise octave key design.

5000|$|The tip of an épée {{comprises}} several parts including: the mushroom-shaped movable tip; its housing or [...] "barrel", {{which is}} threaded to the blade; a contact spring; {{and a return}} spring. The tips are generally {{held in place by}} two small grub screws, which thread into the sides of the tip through elongated openings {{on either side of the}} barrel. The screws hold the tip within the barrel but are allowed to travel freely in the openings. While this is the most common system, <b>screwless</b> variations do exist. The return spring must allow the tip to support a force of 750 g-f N without registering a touch. Finally, an épée tip must allow a shim of 1.5 mm to be inserted between the tip and the barrel, and when a 0.5 mm shim is inserted and the tip depressed, it should not register a touch. The contact spring is threaded in or out of the tip to adjust for this distance. These specifications are tested at the start of each bout during competitions. During competitions, fencers are required to have a minimum of two weapons and two body wires in case of failure or breakage.|$|E
40|$|Background The scarf {{osteotomy}} is {{a standard}} procedure to correct hallux valgus. Recent modifications in the technique allow for important translations of the bone fragments {{without the need for}} screw fixation. We performed the first prospective analysis of radiographic parameters after a <b>screwless</b> scarf osteotomy. Prospective study of pre- and postoperative standing radiographs of the feet let us quantify angle reduction and shortening, lengthening or lowering of the first metatarsal. Methods 100 patients undergoing a <b>screwless</b> scarf osteotomy were evaluated radiographically before and after surgery. The 1 - 2 IM angle, HVA, length of the first metatarsal, protrusion length and height of the first metatarsal head were measured. Results The mean 1 - 2 IM angle was reduced significantly, to a normal range. The mean reduction of the first metatarsal length and protrusion length was 0. 3 and 0. 14  cm respectively. The metatarsal head was lowered 0. 3  cm on average. Conclusions A minimal mean reduction of the first metatarsal length was observed, but it is possible to lengthen the first metatarsal if necessary. In 23 % of cases, an increase of protrusion length was obtained. The <b>screwless</b> scarf osteotomy results in a good correction of the 1 - 2 IM angle and HVA. If necessary, plantarisation of the first metatarsal head could be obtained. Secondary displacement was seen in 1 patient. Level of evidence IIa, prospective controlled trial. status: accepte...|$|E
40|$|Paediatric calcaneal {{fractures}} {{are rare}} injuries usually managed conservatively or with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF).

We report successful closed reduction and <b>screwless</b> fixation of an extra-articular calcaneal fracture dislocation in a 7 -year-old boy. Reduction was achieved using two Ilizarov half-ring frames arranged perpendicular to each other, enabling simultaneous application of longitudinal and rotational traction. Anatomical reduction was achieved with restored angles of Bohler and Gissane. Two K-wires were the definitive fixation.

40|$|Abstract — Recent {{advances}} in tissue-engineered cartilage {{open the door}} to new clinical treatments of joint lesions. Common to all therapies with in-vitro engineered autografts is the need for optimal fit of the construct, to allow <b>screwless</b> implantation and optimal integration into the live joint. Computer Assisted Surgery techniques are prime candidates to ensure the required accuracy {{while at the same time}} simplifying the procedure. A pilot study has been conducted aiming at assembling a new set of methods to support ankle joint arthroplasty using bio-engineered autografts. Computer assistance allows planning of the implant shape on a CT image, manufacturing the construct according to the plan and interoperatively navigating the surgical tools for implantation. A rotational symmetric model of the joint surface was used to avoid segmentation of the CT image; a new software was developed to determine the joint axis and make the implant shape parameterisable. A complete cycle of treatment from planning to operation was conducted on a human cadaveric foot, thus proving the feasibility of computer-assisted arthroplasty using bio-engineered autografts.

40|$|Objectives: Implant {{supported}} single metal-ceramic crowns cemented either extraorally or intraorally were comparatively {{evaluated by}} clinical, radiologic, biomarker, and microbiological parameters. Materials and Methods: Twelve patients with bilateral single tooth {{gap in the}} maxillary posterior region received two locking-taper implants; 4. 5 mm width, 8 mm length. Selection of intraoral (IOC) or extraoral cementation (EOC) using <b>screwless</b> titanium abutments was done randomly. Peri-implant crevicular fluid (PICF), gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) samples were collected from the implants, adjacent teeth, and bleeding on probing, soft tissue thickness, keratinized tissue width were recorded before starting the prosthetic procedures (baseline) and 3, 6 months after implant loading. Crestal bone loss was measured on radiographs taken immediately and 6 months after cementation. Cytokine levels, amounts of bacteria were determined in PICF/GCF samples. Data were tested by appropriate statistical analyses. Results: Clinical findings were similar in the crowns cemented extraorally or intraorally at all times (P[*]&# 60;[*]. 05). PICF and GCF data were similar. At 3 month, interleukin- 17 E and osteoprotegerin levels were lower in the intraorally cemented crowns. Conclusion: Extraorally and intraorally cemented crowns exhibited similar crestal bone loss after loading. Higher amount of osteoprotegerin at 3 month at the EOC than the IOC sites might bode well for good osseointegration...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES This is the {{experience}} with the Stratos system in two surgical centres {{for the management of}} two types of rib fractures: flail chest and multiple dislocated rib fractures with significant chest wall deformity. METHODS From January 2009 to May 2012, 94 consecutive patients were included. Selected indications were extended anterolateral flail chest (n = 68) and dislocated painful rib fractures (n = 26). The open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) system consists of flexible titanium rib clamps and connecting plates. The postoperative course was assessed. Clinical and functional outcomes were evaluated at 6 months. Functional assessment consisted of measurement of the functional vital capacity (FVC) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination with determination of the radiological vital capacity (rVC) in patients with a flail chest. RESULTS The median operation time and length of hospital stay were 122 min and 19 days, respectively, in patients with a flail chest, and 67 min and 11 days, respectively, in patients with dislocated painful rib fractures. The morbidity rate was 6. 4 % and the overall 30 -day mortality rate was 1. 1 %. Clinical evaluation and pulmonary function testing at 6 months revealed no deformity of the chest wall, symmetrical shoulder girdle mobility in 88 % and a feeling of stiffness on the operated side in 19 % of the patients operated for a flail chest. Median ratio of FVC was 88 %, not suggesting any restriction after stabilization. MRI was performed in 53 % (36 of 68) of the patients with a flail chest. The analysis of the rVC showed, on average, no clinically relevant restriction related to the operation, with a mean rVC of the operated relative to the non-operated side of 92 % (95 % confidence interval: 83, 100). Stabilization of more than four ribs was associated with a lower median rVC than stabilization of four or less ribs. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that stabilization of the chest wall with this <b>screwless</b> rib fixation device can be performed with a low morbidity and lead to early restoration of chest wall integrity and respiratory pump function, without clinically relevant functional restriction. Owing to the simplicity of the fixation technique, indications for stabilization can be safely enlarged to selected patients with dislocated and painful rib fracture...|$|E
