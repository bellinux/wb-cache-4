Basically, after distributing 255 seed {{values in the}} existing method, these values were performed XOR operation to generate the link encryption key of 128 [*]bits. However, the existing method have some problems such as <b>key</b> <b>seeds</b> are sent to a node as a plaintext and all <b>key</b> <b>seed</b> values (maximum 255 seeds) should be guaranteed their successful transmission each time without loss. Therefore, in this paper, we propose two-phase <b>key</b> <b>seed</b> distribution approaches called quick and main mode.

The main features of cryptography are to work out with problems, which are associated with secrecy, authentication and integrity. In order to handle all the cryptographic problems many kinds of cryptographic algorithms have been invented. The complexity of these problems made several categories of cryptographic algorithms.

30|$|RF 4 CE {{can provide}} the basic {{security}} functionalities such as frame encryption and data authentication in MAC layer because {{it is based on}} IEEE 802.15. 4 specification. In the network layer of RF 4 CE, it first generates 128 bits link encryption key and stores the key in the pairing table after finishing the pairing process, and then the encryption key is utilized for secure data transmission. In the process of distributing the <b>key</b> <b>seeds,</b> it establishes secure channel between nodes. At this time, a controller and target node first performs the pairing process, and then checks the security capability option of the pairing request node. In case the correspondent node supports the security function, a <b>key</b> <b>seed</b> distribution process is performed. During the <b>key</b> <b>seed</b> distribution, the <b>key</b> <b>seed</b> values of the maximum n are delivered to a controller and then the same secret key is generated in an end-to-end. At this time, the maximum n of the transmitted <b>key</b> <b>seed</b> value is 255. In each node, the <b>key</b> <b>seed</b> value is reassembled through the XOR operation and then generates the link encryption key [6, 7, 12, 14]. However, the <b>key</b> <b>seed</b> values have the vulnerabilities such as data interception, masquerading, and denial-of-service by the third party as well as MITM attack because of being transmitted to the plaintext state without providing an encryption or any security functions. Therefore, the <b>key</b> <b>seed</b> wiretapping by malicious users should be fundamentally prevented, and a solution for forgery of seed value itself and a sequence number of a <b>key</b> <b>seed</b> frame is required, too. In order to prevent DoS attack, it is necessary to support tolerant and resilient capability to prepare for interrupting the normal <b>key</b> <b>seed</b> distribution and secret key generation.

40|$|Abstract: Current {{methods for}} {{evaluating}} hazards to seed-eating birds {{are based on}} estimated exposure per unit area and assume that birds ingest all of the chemical on a treated seed. In an earlier study, however, {{it was determined that}} red-winged blackbirds removed only about 15 % of an insecticidal treatment applied to individual rice seeds. Here, we extend those Ðndings by examining the seed-handling behavior of four granivorous bird species exposed to millet, rice, sunÑower and sorghum treated with imidacloprid. Mourning doves (Zenaida macroura L.) swallowed the seed whole. House Ðnches (Carpodacus mexicanus Mu ller), red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus L.) and boat-tailed grackles (Quiscalus major Vieillot) discarded the seed hulls, however, and removed only 15 È 40 % of the initial chemical treatment. Residues on seed hulls decreased as handling time increased. SunÑowers had the lowest residues because birds repeatedly handled the hull to remove bits of the oily kernel.

40|$|Quantum-based {{cryptographic}} protocols {{are often}} said to enjoy security {{guaranteed by the}} fundamental laws of physics. However, even carefully designed quantum-based cryptographic schemes may be susceptible to subtle attacks that are outside the original design. As an example, we give attacks against a recently proposed ``secure communication using mesoscopic coherent states'', which employs mesoscopic states, rather than single-photon states. Our attacks can be used either as a known-plaintext attack {{or in the case}} where the plaintext has not been randomized. One of our attacks requires beamsplitters and the replacement of a lossy channel by a lossless one. It is successful provided that the original loss in the channel is so big that Eve can obtain 2 ^k copies of what Bob receives, where k is the length of the <b>seed</b> <b>key</b> pre-shared by Alice and Bob. Substantial improvements over such an exhaustive key search attack can be made, whenever a key is reused. Furthermore, we remark that, under the same assumption of a known or non-random plaintext, Grover's exhaustive key search attack can be applied directly to "secure communication using mesoscopic coherent states", whenever the channel loss is more than 50 percent. Therefore, as far as information-theoretic security is concerned, optically amplified signals necessarily degrade the security of the proposed scheme, when the plaintext is known or non-random.
