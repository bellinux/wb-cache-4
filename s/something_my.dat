Club, stated a {{positive}} review of Dragonlance Chronicles, remarking that Dragons of Autumn Twilight is still widely read, although {{he noted the}} clichés of the series: [...] "In Dragons Of Autumn Twilight, the adventurers meet up in a tavern—even {{if it is a}} tavern that’s nestled in the branches of a giant tree, <b>something</b> <b>my</b> 12-year-old self thought was super cool. (My 42-year-old self agrees, although my days of getting drunk way up high up in a tree are starting to wind down.)".|$|E
500|$|In early 2001, Spears {{said that}} she had plans to make her film debut. She and her team then created a concept for it, which was later {{developed}} by Grey's Anatomy creator Shonda Rimes. Spears commented that she [...] "talked to [...] and told her what I wanted the movie to be about and she elaborated on it. It was my little project. When you do a movie, I {{think you have to be}} really passionate about it. I was having a lot of offers, but this is <b>something</b> <b>my</b> heart was into." [...] A press conference was held during the Marché International du Disque et de l'Edition Musicale (MIDEM) in Cannes, France, on January 19, 2002, where Spears also premiered the film.|$|E

I want someone to look at that number and say [...] "that's fucked up" [...] and fix it. Fix society. Please." [...] A second post appeared shortly after; titled [...] "Sorry", it featured an apology to her close friends and siblings for the trauma that her suicide would put them through, but also contained a message to her parents: [...] "Fuck you. You can't just control other people like that. That's messed up." [...] An additional, handwritten suicide note reading [...] "I've had enough" [...] was found on her bed, but then thrown away by Alcorn's mother after police made a copy.|$|E

500|$|In early 2001, Spears and {{her team}} {{developed}} a script for a movie where the singer could be the main role. [...] "I talked to [...] and told her what I wanted the movie to be about and she elaborated on it," [...] Spears said. [...] "It was my little project. When you do a movie, I {{think you have to}} be really passionate about it. I was having a lot of offers, but this is <b>something</b> <b>my</b> heart was into." [...] After finishing the script, the movie, which was later titled Crossroads, had the working titles of What Are Friends For and Not a Girl. [...] "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman", written by Dido, Max Martin and Rami, was originally intended to be included on the movie's soundtrack, but after JIVE Records decided not to release a soundtrack, Spears later decided to use it on her third studio album, Britney (2001).|$|E
500|$|Cisneros {{was awarded}} a {{bachelor}} of arts degree from Loyola University Chicago in 1976, and received a master of fine arts degree from the Iowa Writers' Workshop at the University of Iowa in 1978. [...] It was while attending the Workshop that Cisneros discovered how the particular social position she occupied gave her writing a unique potential. She recalls being suddenly struck by the differences {{between her and her}} classmates: [...] "It wasn't as if I didn't know who I was. I knew I was a Mexican woman. But I didn't think it {{had anything to do with}} why I felt so much imbalance in my life, whereas it had everything to do with it! My race, my gender, and my class! And it didn't make sense until that moment, sitting in that seminar. That's when I decided I would write about <b>something</b> <b>my</b> classmates couldn't write about." [...] She cast aside her attempt to conform to American literary canons and adopted a writing style that was purposely opposite that of her classmates, realizing that instead of being something to be ashamed of, her own cultural environment was a source of inspiration. From then on, she would write of her [...] "neighbors, the people [...] saw, the poverty that the women had gone through." ...|$|E

2500|$|Later on as his Motown career developed, Gaye {{would seek}} {{inspiration}} in fellow label mates such as David Ruffin of The Temptations and Levi Stubbs of the Four Tops as their grittier voices led to Gaye and his producer seeking a similar sound in recordings such as [...] "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" [...] and [...] "That's the Way Love Is". Later in his life, Gaye {{reflected on the}} influence of Ruffin and Stubbs stating, [...] "I had heard something in their voices <b>something</b> <b>my</b> own voice lacked". He further explained, [...] "the Tempts and Tops' music made me remember that when a lot of women listen to music, they want to feel the power of a real man." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} May 27, 1967, Rex Stout told author Dick Lochte that Orson Welles had once {{wanted to make}} a series of Nero Wolfe movies, and Stout had turned him down. Disappointed with the Nero Wolfe movies of the 1930s, Stout was leery of Nero Wolfe film and TV projects in America during his lifetime: [...] "That's <b>something</b> <b>my</b> heirs can fool around with, if they've a mind to," [...] he said. In 1976, a year after Stout's death, Paramount Television purchased the rights for the entire set of Nero Wolfe stories for Orson Welles. Paramount paid $200,000 for the TV rights to eight hours of Nero Wolfe. The producers planned to begin with an ABC-TV movie and hoped to persuade Welles to continue the role in a mini-series. Frank D. Gilroy was signed to write the television script ("The Doorbell Rang") and direct the TV movie on the assurance that Welles would star, but by April 1977 Welles had bowed out. Thayer David was cast as Wolfe in the 1977 TV movie.|$|E
