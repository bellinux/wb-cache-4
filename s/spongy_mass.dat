The bottom of the furnace also fills with molten slag, often consisting of fayalite, a compound of silicon, oxygen and iron mixed with other impurities from the ore.

As stated, although normally distinctive the oak marble gall can, under some growth conditions, be mistaken for the oak apple gall, caused by a number of gall wasps, such as Biorhiza pallida.

60|$|Section 8. It {{might be}} {{inferred}} from this that pure and impure blood mix in the ventricle, and that a blood of uniform quality flows to lungs, head, and extremities; {{but this is not}} so.

It will be noted that the opening of pulmonary arteries lies nearest to the heart, next come the aortic and carotid arches, which have a common opening at A. Furthermore, at c.g.l.

It selects the dorsal aorta, because the carotid arch, plugged by the carotid gland, offers the greater resistance. Presently, however, the back resistance of the filled dorsal aorta rises above this, and the last flow of blood, from the ventricular systole-- almost purely oxygenated blood for the left auricle-- goes on towards the head.|$|E

5000|$|The fine scoria ashes or [...] "cinders" [...] {{thrown out}} by basaltic volcanoes are often <b>spongy</b> <b>masses</b> of tachylite {{with only a}} few larger {{crystals}} or phenocrysts imbedded in black glass. Such tachylite volcanic bombs and scoria are frequent in Iceland, Auvergne, Stromboli and Etna, and are very common also in the ash beds or tuffs of older date, such as occur in Skye, Midlothian and Fife, Derbyshire, and elsewhere. Basic pumices of this kind are exceedingly widespread {{on the bottom of the}} sea, either dispersed in the pelagic red clay and other deposits or forming layers coated with oxides of manganese precipitated on them from the sea water. These tachylite fragments, which are usually much decomposed by the oxidation and hydration of their ferrous compounds, have taken on a dark red color. This altered basic glass is known as [...] "palagonite"; concentric bands of it often surround kernels of unaltered tachylite, and are so soft that they are easily cut with a knife. In the palagonite the minerals are also decomposed and are represented only by pseudomorphs. The fresh tachylite glass, however, often contains lozenge-shaped crystals of plagioclase feldspar and small prisms of augite and olivine, but all these minerals very frequently occur mainly as microlites or as beautiful skeletal growths with sharply-pointed corners or ramifying processes. Palagonite tuffs are found also among the older volcanic rocks. In Iceland a broad stretch of these rocks, described as [...] "the palagonite formation," [...] is said to cross the island from south-west to north-east.

60|$|Now, {{when the}} coco-nut has {{actually}} reached {{the ground at}} last, and proceeds to sprout in the spot where chance (perhaps in the bodily shape of a disappointed monkey) has chosen to cast it, these numerous safeguards and solid envelopes naturally begin to prove decided nuisances to the embryo within. It starts under the great disadvantage of being hermetically sealed within a solid wooden shell, so that no water can possibly get at it to aid it as most other seeds are aided {{in the process of}} germination. Fancy yourself a seed-pea, anxious to sprout, but coated all round with a hard covering of impermeable sealing-wax, and you will be in a position faintly to appreciate the unfortunate predicament of a grower coco-nut. Natural selection, however--that deus ex machinâ of modern science, which can perform such endless wonders, if only you give it time enough to work in and variations enough to work upon--natural selection has come to the rescue of the unhappy plant by leaving it a little hole {{at the top of the}} shell, out of which it can push its feathery green head without difficulty. Everybody knows that if you look at the sharp end of a coco-nut you will see three little brown pits or depressions on its surface. Most people also know that two of these are firmly stopped up (for a reason to which I shall presently recur), but that the third one is only closed by a slight film or very thin shell, which can be easily bored through with a pocket knife, so as to let the milk run off before cracking the shell. So much we have all learnt during our ardent pursuit of natural knowledge on half-holidays in early life. But we probably then failed to observe that just opposite this soft hole lies a small roundish knob, imbedded in the pulp or eatable portion, which knob is in fact the embryo palm or seedling, for whose ultimate benefit the whole arrangement (in brown and green) has been invented. That is very much the way with man: he notices what concerns his own appetite, and omits all the really important parts of the whole subject. We think the use of the hole is to let out the milk; but the nut knows that its real object is to let out the seedling. The knob grows out at last into the young plantlet, and it is by means of the soft hole that it makes its escape through the shell to the air and the sunshine which it seeks without. This brings us really down at last to the true raison d'être for the milk in the coco-nut. As the seed or kernel cannot easily get at much water from outside, it has a good supply of water laid up for it ready beforehand within its own encircling shell. The mother liquid from which the pulp or nutty part has been deposited remains in the centre, as the milk, till the tiny embryo begins to sprout. As soon as it does so, the little knob which was at first so very small enlarges rapidly and absorbs the water, till it grows out into a big spongy cellular mass, which at last almost fills up the entire shell. At the same time, its other end pushes its way out through the soft hole, and then gives birth to a growing bud at the top--the future stem and leaves--and to a number of long threads beneath--the future roots. Meanwhile, the <b>spongy</b> <b>mass</b> inside begins gradually to absorb all the nutty part, using up its oils and starches for the purpose of feeding the young plant above, until it is of an age to expand its leaves to the open tropical sunlight and shift for itself in the struggle for life. It seems at first sight very hard to understand how any tissue so solid as the pulp of coco-nut can be thus softened and absorbed without any visible cause; but in the subtle chemistry of living vegetation such a transformation is comparatively simple and easy to perform. Nature sometimes works much greater miracles than this in the same way: for example, what is called vegetable ivory, a substance so solid that it can be carved or turned only with great difficulty, is really the kernel of another palm-nut, allied to the coco-palm, and its very stony particles are all similarly absorbed during germination by the dissolving power of the young seedling.|$|E

50|$|Like other {{freshwater}} mussels, {{this species}} releases larvae called glochidia, which must attach parasitically {{to a host}} organism, generally a fish, so they can develop into free-living juveniles. Some mussels release their glochidia inside a <b>spongy,</b> sticky <b>mass</b> called a conglutinate. The conglutinate sometimes resembles a prey item, such as a worm, which attracts the fish. When the fish bumps the conglutinate, it breaks apart and releases the glochidia, which attach to the fish. S. undulatus produces an interesting kind of conglutinate. It is whitish and rod-shaped, up to 7 millimeters long and contains around 12 glochidia. The glochidia of this species are larger than those of most other mussels, measuring up to almost 500 micrometers. The conglutinate moves by itself, making a pulsing motion. This {{may be caused by}} the swelling of the structure when it contacts the water. The motion helps to squeeze out the glochidia and it may help to attract fish hosts. Sometimes one of the glochidia will attach to a host while remaining attached to the conglutinate; in this case, the other glochidia in the structure may be dragged along with it and have an easier opportunity to parasitize the host.|$|R
50|$|The aphids {{accumulate}} {{in late summer}} and autumn, forming large colonies. Spores of Scorias spongiosa are borne by wind and rain and fall on the honeydew secretions found below the aphids. The first hyphal growth is straw coloured and unpigmented. The hyphae adhere {{to each other for}} short distances, diverging and re-adhering to form a loose stranded structure. Pigmentation begins to occur on the surfaces of outer strands and the stroma begins to darken. The hyphae coalesce and form mycelial strands which radiate outward and upward from the supporting structure. Flask-shaped, spore-bearing pycnidia appear on the mycelia, which have a waxlike appearance: the matrix turns from brittle to soft as it absorbs moisture. As further quantities of honeydew accumulate, the fungus grows larger until it resembles a gelatinous sponge resting on the branches or leaves of the beech tree. Fully pigmented strands in the mature stoma produce bowl-shaped pseudothecia and these outermost hyphae cease to grow. The inner strands continue growth and force their way to the exterior. Asexual conidia are extruded in a slimy matrix in liquid droplets from the pycnidia.

40|$|Auriferous iron sulfide-bearing {{deposits}} of the Carolina slate belt have distinctive mineralogical and textural features—traits {{that provide a}} basis to construct models of ore deposition. Our identification of paragenetically early types of pyrite, especially remnant colloform, crustiform, and layered growth textures of pyrite containing electrum and pyrrhotite, establishes unequivocally that gold mineralization was coeval with deposition of host rocks and not solely related to Paleozoic tectonic events. Ore horizons at the Haile deposit, South Carolina, contain many remnants of early pyrite: (1) fine-grained cubic pyrite disseminated along bedding; (2) finegrained <b>spongy,</b> rounded <b>masses</b> of pyrite that may envelop or drape over pyrite cubes; (3) fragments of botryoidally and crustiform layered pyrite, and (4) pyritic infilling of vesicles and pumice. Detailed mineral chemistry by petrography, microprobe, SEM, and EDS analysis of replaced pumice and colloform structures containing both arsenic compositional banding and electrum points to coeval deposition of gold and the volcanic host rocks and, thus, confirms a syngenetic origin for the gold deposits. Early pyrite textures are present in other major {{deposits of}} the Carolina slate belt, such as Ridgeway and Barite Hill, and these provide strong evidence for models whereby the sulfide ores formed prior to tectonism. The role of Paleozoic metamorphism was to remobilize and concentrate gold and other minerals in structurally prepared sites.

40|$|In the Ravenna quadrangle, {{north central}} Los Angeles county, {{approximately}} 8, 400 feet of middle Miocene (?) fanglomerates and 3, 600 feet of curiously interbedded basalts are exposed. They lie unconformably on a pre-Tertiary basement and unconformably under the Mint Canyon formation (upper Miocene). For {{this group of}} rocks the name "Vasquez Series" is suggested to replace the term "Escondido Series" of O. H. Hershey, which is preoccupied. The fanglomerates of the Vasquez Series are composed of angular fragments of anorthosite, quartz diorite, granite, and gneiss, commonly {{a foot or two}} in diameter though larger fragments are abundant. The fragments are embedded in a sparse matrix of sand and gravel cemented by calcite and iron oxides. The rude and irregular strata of the series are typically red, brown, or white in color. These sediments accumulated rapidly under semi-arid conditions in a large canoe-shaped basin and formed a series of coalescing alluvial fans which sloped in general toward the west. The upper part of the series contains local occurrences of fine silty beds of lacustrine origin. Some of the interbedded basalts exhibit phenomena suggestive of intrusive emplacement, others are clearly extrusive. These lavas range from massive hypohysline porphyricitc rocks to <b>spongy</b> amygdaloidal <b>masses.</b> Subsequent to deposition, the Vasquez Series was uplifted and deformed.

The endothelium was often associated with underlying blocks of collagenous material, as well as looselyarranged aggregates of lymphocytes, other mononuclear cells and occasional neutrophils in the connective tissue septae and more prominently perivascularly. The bitch was discharged on antibiotic treatment but returned 2 weeks later with apparent prolapsed vagina which failed to reduce over the next week. Laparotomy revealed the tumour to have spread extensively in the caudal abdomen to involve the broad ligament and the ventral rectal serosa, and the 'prolapsed' tissue was found to be expanded vaginal wall. The bitch was euthanased and necropsied, Histological examination confirmed lymphangiosarcomatous invasion of the submucosal and muscular layers of the retroperitoneal, traumatised, prolapsed part of the vagina, the urethra and the ventral rectal wall. The broad ligament was diffusely invaded with tumour which had proliferated into the caudal abdominal space, and 3 small intra-trabecular foci of tumour were found in the right popliteal lymph node near the hilus. Mitotic figures were generally scarce. There was mild subcutaneous oedema of the ventral trunk extending from the axillae to the inner proximal thighs, which had not been evident clinically, and the lymph nodes (peripheral more so than internal) microscopically showed marked trabecular and perivascular fibrosis especially in hilar regions. Other congenital defects were hepatic capsular and central venous fibrosis with lymphatic duplication and dilatation in all areas of connective tissue, ventrally-incongruous half-circular tracheal rings, and multifocal renal dysplasia affecting the right kidney. There was locally-extensive subacute pyelonephritis of the left kidney...|$|R
50|$|Most early {{processes}} in Europe and Africa involved smelting iron ore in a bloomery, where {{the temperature is}} kept low enough so that the iron does not melt. This produces a <b>spongy</b> <b>mass</b> of iron called a bloom, which then has to be consolidated with a hammer to produce wrought iron. The earliest evidence to date for the bloomery smelting of iron is found at Tell Hammeh, Jordan (http://www.ironsmelting.net/www/smelting/), and dates to 930 BC (C14 dating).|$|E
