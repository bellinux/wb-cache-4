40|$|Compressed signal {{representations}} find {{applications in}} image analysis through the reductions in numerical overheads {{made possible by}} downsizing the physical dimensions of an <b>image</b> <b>signal.</b> The pyramid algorithm of Burt and Adelson (1983 IEEE Transactions on Communications 31 532 – 540) is a popular choice that splits the <b>image</b> <b>signal</b> into two parts. One part is lowpass and recursively downsized, while the other is highpass but retains the original signal dimensions, which is inefficient. As a general rule for image compression without loss of information, a downsizing factor should equal the number of spatial filters. Here we show that a Taylor–Riesz expansion of the <b>image</b> <b>signal</b> allows one to downsize an <b>image</b> <b>signal</b> by an order equal to the n + 1 th Taylor–Riesz derivatives of the <b>image</b> <b>signal.</b> Application of the unique relationship allows us to both orthogonalize and decimate <b>image</b> <b>signals</b> by large factors (~ 16 ×) that approach those used in current image compression coding schemes. Low-level image properties like contrast, orientation, and energy may be estimated {{as a part of}} the downsizing process. The Riesz transform also allows one to steer continuously across 2 ‑D phase and spatial orientation while allowing access to a local definition of energy, which is itself a lowpass signal, and may itself be downsized. In downsizing both luminance and energy signals, we demonstrate how both coarse-to-fine and global-to-local image information may accessed by combining luminance and energy-based computations. We further demonstrate that the Riesz transform and its generalizations may be regarded as eigen-functions of a polar separable sampling mosaic. Our results suggest that polar separable signal representations based upon 2 ‑D phase and the Riesz transform lead to a unification of ideas capable of merging techniques for image compression and image analysis...|$|R

In addition, it is found that the structure of occluding 1 D signals is invariant under constant and linear models of signal velocity.

40|$|The {{rejection}} of the <b>image</b> <b>signal</b> is a problem inherent to all receiver architectures. One {{of the benefits of}} the low-IF receiver is, that image rejection is realized by I/Q signal processing instead of a fixed analog filter, making it highly reconfigurable and cost-efficient. However, unavoidable imbalances between the I- and Q-branch lead to a limited image attenuation. In this paper a novel I/Q imbalance compensation scheme is presented, in which the unknown analog imbalance parameters are estimated digitally without the need for any calibration or training signal. Based on these estimates the interference by the <b>image</b> <b>signal</b> is effectively compensated, upgrading the vulnerable ordinary low-IF receiver to a powerful advanced receiver architecture, where the mean value of the image-to-signal ratio never exceeds a pre-defined maximum value, regardless of the <b>image</b> <b>signal</b> power. 1...|$|R

We also want to incorporate light weighted human vision measurement system like edge information to measure video artifacts in real time. Then simple bucket filling approach is applied, where the particular bucket contains the maximum value also indicating the block boundaries that are passed to the report module.

40|$|Even though <b>image</b> <b>signals</b> are {{typically}} defined {{on a regular}} 2 D grid, there also exist many scenarios where {{this is not the}} case and the amplitude of the <b>image</b> <b>signal</b> only is available for a non-regular subset of pixel positions. In such a case, a resampling of the image to a regular grid has to be carried out. This is necessary since almost all algorithms and technologies for processing, transmitting or displaying <b>image</b> <b>signals</b> rely on the samples being available on a regular grid. Thus, it is of great importance to reconstruct the image on this regular grid, so that the reconstruction comes closest to the case that the signal has been originally acquired on the regular grid. In this paper, Frequency Selective Reconstruction is introduced for solving this challenging task. This algorithm reconstructs <b>image</b> <b>signals</b> by exploiting the property that small areas of images can be represented sparsely in the Fourier domain. By further considering the basic properties of the optical transfer function of imaging systems, a sparse model of the signal is iteratively generated. In doing so, the proposed algorithm is able to achieve a very high reconstruction quality, in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity measure as well as in terms of visual quality. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is able to outperform state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms and gains of more than 1 dB PSNR are possible...|$|R

40|$|Compressive Sampling (CS) is an {{emerging}} theory which points us to a promising direction of designing novel efficient data compression techniques. However, {{due to the}} complex nature of the natural <b>images</b> <b>signals,</b> the indiscriminate sampling scheme of conventional Compressive Sensing cannot sufficiently capture the important information of <b>image</b> <b>signals,</b> and as a result, the performance of Compressive Sensing drops greatly. The conventional Compressive Sensing {{is based on the}} assumption that we do not have any prior knowledge about the target signal. Therefore, an incoherent sampling scheme is a reasonable choice. However, for <b>image</b> <b>signals,</b> the knowledge about its spectrum characteristics is accessible, which enables us to adjust the conventional Compressive Sensing framework to achieve better performance by taking advantage of the prior knowledge. Based on this observation, we propose two reweighted Compressive Sensing frameworks which introduce weighting schemes into the measurement process. We developed two approaches of designing the weighting matrix from the perspectives of the human eye perception and the image spectrum statistics respectively. By utilizing the proposed weighting scheme, we can adjust the behavior of the measurement process to capture more information from the important frequency components; furthermore, our proposed weighting scheme can also improve performance of the optimization process in the reconstruction stage. Experiment results indicate that both of the proposed weighting schemes considerably enhance the performance of Compressive Sensing on <b>image</b> <b>signals</b> without increasing the size of measurements or computation complexity, while they can still keep the advantages of random sampling in the conventional Compressive Sensing framework...|$|R
