5|$|The diet of the {{macaroni}} penguin {{consists of}} a variety of crustaceans, squid and fish, although the proportions that each makes up vary with locality and season. Krill, particularly Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), account for over 90% of food during breeding season. Cephalopods and small fish such as the <b>marbled</b> <b>rockcod</b> (Notothenia rossii), painted notie (Lepidonotothen larseni), Champsocephalus gunneri, the lanternfish species Krefftichthys anderssoni, Protomyctophum tenisoni and P. normani become more important during chick-rearing. Like several other penguin species, the macaroni penguin sometimes deliberately swallows small (10– to 30-mm-diameter) stones; this behaviour has been speculated to aid in providing ballast for deep-sea diving, or to help grind food, especially the exoskeletons of crustaceans which are a significant part of its diet.|$|R

40|$|Waters around South Georgia are {{amongst the}} most {{productive}} in the Southern Ocean, and support internationally important fisheries. However, there is significant inter-annual variability in fish stocks, and some species have failed to recover from historical overfishing. Dispersal and retention of the planktonic eggs and larvae of marine fish can {{play a key role}} in the maintenance of adult stocks. We use a numerical modelling approach to examine the influence of oceanographic and life-history variability on the dispersal and retention of 2 Antarctic fishes: Champsocephalus gunnari (mackerel icefish) and Notothenia rossii (<b>marbled</b> <b>rockcod).</b> Mean retention of N. rossii larvae was predicted to be 5. 3 %, considerably lower than that of C. gunnari (31. 3 %), a difference related to the longer planktonic period of the former. Such apparent loss of larvae from local recruitment grounds may contribute to the failure of the N. rossii population to recover from its collapse in the 1970 s. However, retention of both species showed high inter-annual variability. Dispersal and retention of C. gunnari were strongly influenced by location of the spawning site, with the greatest contribution to overall retention from spawning sites on the southwest South Georgia shelf. In addition, a consistent feature in C. gunnari was a lack of larval exchange between the proximate South Georgia and Shag Rocks shelves, regions separated by only 240 km. Our findings provide insights into the demographic dynamics and connectivity of C. gunnari and N. rossii populations at South Georgia in relation to prospects for recovery and ongoing responses to environmental variability and change in the region...|$|R

Mitochondria {{are a key}} element in shaping whole organism energy turnover and functional capacities. In our study, we compared two nototheniid fish, the Austral black cod (Notothenia angustata, New Zealand) and the Antarctic <b>marbled</b> <b>rockcod</b> (Notothenia rossii, Antarctic Peninsula) for their abilities of metabolic compensation for rising temperature and PCO 2 at the intracellular level. We acclimated N. angustata to control conditions (PCO 2 of 0. 04 kPa) and to an ambient PCO 2 of 0. 2 kPa for 11 days, and kept N. rossii at a PCO 2 of 0. 04 kPa. We assessed permeabilized heart fibre oxygen consumption at various respiratory states (e. g. state III ￼￼complex I/ II, state IV (leak), uncoupled/ ETS capacity, complex IV) in acutely hypercapnic (PCO 2 of 2 kPa, corresponds to intracellular PCO 2 under 0. 2 kPa ambient hypercapnia) vs. normocapnic (PCO 2 of 0. 04 kPa) respiration media. In all respiratory states, acute exposure to the hypercapnic respiration medium resulted in reduced mitochondrial capacities, in the Austral and the Antarctic notothenioids Yet, overall heart fibre respiration was higher in the hypercapnia acclimated N. angustata than in their control group. This suggests that chronic acclimation of the fish to moderately elevated PCO 2 levels might enhance mitochondrial aerobic capacities, involving e. g. changes in enzyme capacities or mitochondrial proliferation. Our data indicate that while acute high PCO 2 levels of 2 kPa reduce mitochondrial oxidative capacities in Austral and Antarctic notothenioids, at least the Austral fish {{seem to be able to}} compensate for these acutely reduced metabolic capacities by hypercapnia acclimation. ...|$|R

Samples of vegetation (angiosperm, lichens and mosses), invertebrates (krill and limpets), fish (<b>marbled</b> and black <b>rockcod),</b> bird liver and eggs (Antarctic, Gentoo and Adélie penguins, kelp gull, Antarctic tern, cape petrel and giant southern petrel) and pinniped tissues (Weddell seal, crabeater seal, southern elephant seal and Antarctic fur seal) were analysed for Hg before and after delipidation by cyclohexane. The difference between the two measurements ranged individually from − 63 to 136 % (in the moss Sanionia uncinata) and the averages ranged from − 60 to 66 % (in pinniped tissues). The proportion of organic Hg, which presents considerable lipophilicity, but also high affinity for sulfhydryl groups in proteins, might be responsible for such variability.

40|$|The {{interspecific}} {{relationships in}} the genus Triturus are incompletely known. In CHAPTER 2, we attempt to resolve them by using allozyme and mtDNA data. Despite {{the large number of}} markers used, relationships continue to elude us. The results suggest that speciation in the group occurred during a short time period (the end of the Middle Miocene). Paleogeographic reconstructions of the presumed centre of origin (the Balkans) support this hypothesis. We proposed here that T. macedonicus should be raised to full species given its allopatric distribution and high genetic divergence with T. carnifex. The best way to test the scenario presented in CHAPTER 2 is to look at multiple independent markers that, unfortunately, were not readily available. CHAPTER 3 describes the process through which dozens of markers were designed and tested for the genus Triturus. Out of more than fifty markers tested, five provided promising results with enough variability to study the phylogeny and phylogeography of the genus. This opened the door not only for CHAPTER 4, but also for 5 and 6. Taking CHAPTER 2 as the starting point and with the tools developed in CHAPTER 3, CHAPTER 4 attempts to decipher the history of the genus Triturus. The study includes samples from 15 individuals of the seven species of the group. Locations were selected to cover most of the variability in the group, with the exception of areas close to other species. Hybridization is known to occur in these areas, and could bias the inferences made. Results show that all the genes, except the two mtDNA ones, have incongruent phylogenetic signals. We used phylogenetic networks to visualize the alternative phylogenetic signals and have built a phylogenetic tree based on a Bayesian hierarchical method that obtains the species tree based on individual gene trees. This approach successfully resolved the branching order of the newts, although time intervals are very narrow, confirming the near simultaneous speciation scenario of CHAPTER 2. We also found a high genetic differentiation between the two forms of the southern crested newt (T. karelinii) and proposed that they should be raised to full species (T. karelinii and T. arntzeni). As described in CHAPTER 4, hybridization can have a confounding effect on phylogenetic inferences. Incomplete lineage sorting can also produce similar patterns as gene flow, further complicating matters. CHAPTER 5 takes a new approach in distinguishing between gene flow and incomplete lineage sorting, only possible in species with very well defined species borders and limited dispersal capability as the newts, which limits gene flow to a narrow geographical region. As {{can be seen in the}} previous chapters, the crested newts show complex (although interesting) patterns resulting from compound interactions, especially in the Balkans. The marbled newts, on the other hand, are only two species, and therefore we can cover their evolutionary history in more detail, as it is simpler. CHAPTER 6 studies the phylogeography of the two <b>species</b> of <b>marbled</b> newts. Being just a pair and not a group of species, relationships are not problematic. Their sibling relationship is well established (see CHAPTER 2). This chapter also explores how differences in ecological conditions (see CHAPTER 8) along a hybrid zone affect its structure and the amount of gene flow between species. The morphological distinction of adults of the two <b>marbled</b> <b>species</b> is relatively straightforward, even though variation is present. Eggs and larvae, on the contrary, are easy to spot and collect, but impossible to distinguish. CHAPTER 7 describes a cheap and fast molecular technique that allowed the identification of the large number of samples used in CHAPTERS 8 and 9. Based on a morphological and genetic identification of individuals of the two <b>species</b> of <b>marbled</b> newts and published distributional data, CHAPTER 8 identified ecological factors associated with the range border of the two <b>species</b> of <b>marbled</b> newt. Ecological models defining the distribution of the two species differed in four main areas: the northern most region of contact close to Aveiro, the rest of the coastal area (see also CHAPTER 9), the region coinciding with the Tejo river, and the remainder contact zone going until Madrid. In the coastal area of Portugal, close to Caldas da Rainha, the northern marbled newt was found where only pygmy marbled newts were thought to occur. This prompted a detailed study on the distribution of the two species in this area described in CHAPTER 9. This study revealed a small pocket of populations of the northern species surrounded by populations of its sister southern species. Given the distance of this pocket to the main distribution, we believe that the enclave was created by T. pygmaeus moving north, superseding T. marmoratus, rather than the latter species expanding southwards.

40|$|Newts of {{the genus}} Triturus (Amphibia, Caudata, Salamandridae) are {{distributed}} across Europe and adjacent Asia. In spite of its prominence as a model system for evolutionary research, the phylogeny of Triturus has remained incompletely solved. Our aim was to rectify this situation, to which we employed nuclear encoded proteins (40 loci) and mitochondrial DNA-sequence data (mtDNA, 642 bp of the ND 4 gene). We sampled up to four populations per species covering large parts of their ranges. Allozyme and mtDNA data were analyzed separately with parsimony, distance, likelihood and Bayesian methods of phylogenetic inference. Existing knowledge on taxonomic relationships was confirmed, including the monophyly {{of the genus}} and the groups of crested newts (four <b>species)</b> and <b>marbled</b> newts (two <b>species).</b> The genetic coherence of species and subspecies was also confirmed, but not always with high statistical support (depending on taxon, characters under consideration, and method of inference). In spite of our efforts we did not obtain sufficient phylogenetic signal to prefer one out of twelve potential topologies representing crested newts relationships. We hypothesize {{that the lack of}} phylogenetic resolution reflects a hard polytomy and represents the (near) -simultaneous origin of crested newt species. Using a calibration point of 24 Ma (million years before present) for the most recent common ancestor of Triturus-species, the crested newt radiation event is dated at 7 - 6 Ma (scenario 1) or at 11 - 10 Ma (scenario 2), depending on the application of an allozyme versus mtDNA molecular clock. The first biogeographical scenario involves the spread of crested newts from the central Balkans into four compass directions. This scenario cannot be brought into line with potential vicariance events for south-eastern Europe. The second scenario involves the more or less simultaneous origin of four species of crested newts through large-scale vicariance events and is supported by the paleogeographical reconstruction for the region {{at the end of the}} Middle Miocene. The subspecies Triturus carnifex macedonicus carries in one large area the mtDNA that is typical for the neighbouring species T. karelinii, which is attributed to introgression and a recent range shift. It is nevertheless a long distinct evolutionary lineage and we propose to elevate its taxonomic status to that of a species, i. e., from Triturus c. macedonicus (Karaman, 1922) to Triturus macedonicus (Karaman, 1922) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} ten {{crayfish}} {{species have been}} observed in the Netherlands: one native species (the Noble crayfish Astacus astacus) and nine invasive species. Six invasive species are established (narrow-clawed crayfish Astacus leptodactylus, signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus, spiny-cheek crayfish Orconectes limosus, virile crayfish Orconectes, white river crayfish Procambarus acutus and red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii), the status of one invasive <b>species</b> (<b>marbled</b> crayfish Procambarus sp.) is currently unclear. Two invasive species (the stone crayfish Austropotamobius torrentium and the redclaw Cherax quadricarinatus) have been recorded only once. The remarkable expansion {{of some of these}} invasive crayfish has raised questions about the possible impacts. In this study, the probability of entry, further establishment, geographic occurence and spread is assessed. Additionally, an outline is given of the possible impact of the species. Besides the species already observed in the Netherlands, four other species are evaluated. Crayfish are imported either by the aquarium trade or the consumption trade. The consumption trade led to many of the early introductions (e. g. narrow clawed crayfish, red swamp crayfish, spiny cheeked crayfish). Nowadays, this trade has declined considerably due to the rise of imported, prepared crayfish from China. There remains however, a marginal international trade in living crayfish for consumption. In addition to the international trade, an opportunistic, seasonal trade in local species by some fishermen exists. The trade in consumption species in Europe is nearly limited to the species that are already established. Therefore, the probability of the introduction of new species through the consumption trade is low. The aquarium trade has increased significantly and the number of trades species is high and variable. Most of the traded (tropical) specimes stand no chance surviving in the wild but some cold water specimens (for ponds) are also traded. The trade in crayfish for aquaria and ponds must be considered as the prime source of potential new invaders. Many of the established species occupy a larger niche than observed in their natural range. Therefore, the chance of succesful establishment can be easily underestimated. Overwhelming evidence of negative economic and/or ecologic impact has been observed abroad in five of the evaluated species (red swamp crayfish, white river crayfish, signal crayfish, virile crayfish and rusty crayfish). Also in the Netherlands, crayfish are accused of causing damage but so far, very little evidence of the negative impact of crayfish is available. Possibly {{due to a lack of}} data. Further academic research is strongly recommended to assess the possible impacts. Additionally, agreements with the aquarium trade and the consumption trade might significantly reduce the probability of establishment of new ‘dangerous’ crayfish species. Tien soorten kreeften zijn waargenomen in Nederland: één inheemse soort en negen invasieve soorten. Zes soorten hebben zich gevestigd (Turkse rivierkreeft Astacus leptodactylus, Californische rivierkreeft Pacifastacus leniusculus, gevlekte Amerikaanse rivierkreeft Orconectes limosus, geknobbelde Amerikaanse rivierkreeft Orconectes, gestreepte Amerikaanse rivierkreeft Procambarus acutus en de rode Amerikaanse rivierkreeft Procambarus clarkii), de status van één soort (de marmerkreeft Procambarus sp.) is onzeker en twee soorten (de steenkreeft Austropotamobius torrentium en de Australische roodklauwkreeft Cherax quadricarinatus) zijn slechts éénmaal waargenomen. Door de opmerkelijke opmars van een aantal soorten zijn er zorgen gerezen over de mogelijke gevolgen van de kreeften voor flora, fauna en infrastructuur. In deze studie is de waarschijnlijkheid van binnenkomst, vestiging en verspreiding van de verschillende soorten onderzocht. Daarbij is een inschatting gemaakt van de impact. Behalve de soorten die al in Nederland zijn aangetroffen, worden vier andere soorten besproken. De import van kreeften vindt plaats door de handel voor aquaria enerzijds en consumptie anderzijds. Aanvankelijk zijn veel soorten ingevoerd door de consumptiehandel (o. a. de Turkse rivierkreeft, rode Amerikaane rivierkreeft en gevlekte Amerikaanse rivierkreeft). Tegenwoordig is de handel in levende rivierkreeften voor consumptie sterk teruggelopen door de opkomst van de handel in gepelde rivierkreeften uit China. Desondanks is er nog steeds een marginale handel in levende kreeften voor consumptie. Naast de internationale consumptiehandel, is er een opportunistische, seizoensgebonden handel in kreeften voor consumptie door lokale vissers in opkomst. De huidige handel in consumptiesoorten is vrijwel beperkt tot de kreeften die zich al gevestigd hebben. Nieuwe soorten zijn via de consumptiehandel nauwelijks te verwachten. De aquariumhandel is sterk toegenomen en het aantal soorten dat in de handel circuleert is hoog en variabel. De meeste (tropische) soorten maken geen kans om in het wild te overleven, maar ook koudwaterminnende soorten (voor de vijver) worden verhandeld. De handel in kreeften voor aquaria en vijvers moet beschouwd worden als de belangrijkste bron voor nieuwe soorten in Nederland. Veel gevestigde soorten bezetten een grotere niche dan in hun gebied van herkomst. De kans op vestiging kan hierdoor makkelijk onderschat worden. Van tenminste vijf van de geëvalueerde soorten (rode Amerikaanse rivierkreeft, gestreepte Amerikaanse rivierkreeft, Californische rivierkreeft, geknobbelde Amerikaanse rivierkreeft en Orconectes rusticus) is in buitenlandse studies aanzienlijke economische of ecologische schade aangetoont. Ook uit Nederland wordt schade door kreeften gemeld, maar wetenschappelijke onderbouwing ontbreekt. Verder onderzoek hiernaar wordt sterk aanbevolen. Convenanten met de aquariumhandel en de consumptiehandel zouden de kans op vestiging van ‘gevaarlijke’ nieuwe soorten kunnen reduceren...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the methods used to evaluate the potential adverse effects of underwater sound from impact pile driving on the marbled murrelet (a seabird that is federally listed as threatened), and to introduce measures that have successfully minimized adverse effects. The U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service has evaluated the effects of pile driving on the marbled murrelet through several recent Endangered Species Act consultations. Over the past few years, there has been increased attention to the potential for impact pile driving to adversely affect fish <b>species.</b> When foraging, <b>marbled</b> murrelets dive in pursuit of prey and can be exposed to the same elevated sound pressure levels that adversely affect fish. Exposure to these sounds could result in mortality, injury, and/or modification of normal behaviors. Marbled murrelets forage in the marine waters throughout Puget Sound. Recent transportation projects that have occurred in Puget Sound include replacement of the Hood Canal Floating Bridge and multiple Washington State Ferry terminal-maintenance and preservation projects. These projects typically use 36 -inch and 24 -inch hollow steel piles. Impact installation of these piles can produce sound pressure levels of 210 dB peak. Physical injury, including death, may occur in aquatic organisms at sound-pressure levels above 180 dB peak. Sound-pressure levels above 153 dBrms are expected to cause temporary behavioral changes that may negatively affect foraging efficiency. These projects were evaluated by determining the area where sound pressure was expected to exceed the above levels and then estimating the potential for marbled murrelets to be exposed to those sound-pressure levels. When exposure was likely to occur, the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service anticipated adverse effects in the form of harm (physical injury) and harassment (modification of normal behavior patterns). Minimization measures focused on reducing that potential exposure. Sound-attenuation devices (bubble curtains) were used to reduce the extent of the geographic area where adverse effects could occur. A hazing program was used to move murrelets out of the area where physical injury was expected. We present the analysis used to evaluate adverse effects to marbled murrelets from pile driving, discuss the method used to estimate the extent of effects, and introduce measures to minimize adverse effects. Finally, we recommend future research needed to better understand and to reduce further these impacts...|$|R
