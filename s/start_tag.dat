5000|$|Most of the {{attributes}} of an element are name-value pairs, separated by [...] "=" [...] and written within the <b>start</b> <b>tag</b> of an element after the element's name. The value may be enclosed in single or double quotes, although values consisting of certain characters can be left unquoted in HTML (but not XHTML) [...] Leaving attribute values unquoted is considered unsafe. In contrast with name-value pair attributes, there are some attributes that affect the element simply by {{their presence in the}} <b>start</b> <b>tag</b> of the element, like the [...] attribute for the [...] element.|$|E

50|$|Pandolfo {{was born}} in 1977 in Tupa, Sao Paulo. She started drawing and {{painting}} {{at the age of}} 3. At the age of 12, Pandolfo <b>started</b> <b>tagging</b> public walls. She later became part of the group whose graffiti art featured in galleries and museums.|$|R
50|$|In 1989, André <b>started</b> <b>tagging</b> a top-hatted, stick figure {{character}} by {{the name}} of Mr. A on the streets of Paris, which earned him a reputation as a renowned graffiti artist. According to André, he has drawn approximately 300,000 Mr. A characters since the inception of his career.|$|R
50|$|Drady became {{interested}} in the sport as a young child when she <b>started</b> <b>tagging</b> along with her mother to her twice-weekly social squash gatherings at a local club. She won the Queensland under-12 championship in 1978, and then went on to claim state and national championships and an under-19 world team crown in her junior years.|$|R
50|$|Some elements, such as {{the line}} break , do not permit any {{embedded}} content, either text or further tags. These require only a single empty tag (akin to a <b>start</b> <b>tag)</b> and do not use an end tag.|$|E
50|$|As is {{generally}} understood, {{the position of}} an element is indicated as spanning from a <b>start</b> <b>tag,</b> possibly including some child content, and is terminated by an end tag. This {{is the case for}} many, but not all, elements within an HTML document.|$|E
5000|$|In the HTML syntax, most {{elements}} are written with a <b>start</b> <b>tag</b> {{and an end}} tag, with the content in between. An HTML tag is composed {{of the name of}} the element, surrounded by angle brackets. An end tag also has a slash after the opening angle bracket, to distinguish it from the <b>start</b> <b>tag.</b> For example, a paragraph, which is represented by the [...] element, would be written asHowever, not all of these elements require the end tag, or even the <b>start</b> <b>tag,</b> to be present. [...] Some elements, the so-called void elements or [...] empty elements, do not have an end tag. A typical example is the [...] element, which represents a significant line break, such as in a poem or an address. A void element's behaviour is predefined, and it cannot contain any content or other elements. For example, an address would be written asWhen using an XHTML DTD, it is required to open and close the element with a single tag. To specify that it is a void element, a [...] "/" [...] is included {{at the end of the}} tag (not to be confused with the [...] "/" [...] at the beginning of a closing tag).|$|E
25|$|Ryan would <b>start</b> <b>tagging</b> with Jason Larusso, {{creating}} the tag team - The Lionhearts. Throughout 2013, {{the team would}} receive four tag team championship matches, for the Pro EVW, AWW, PWP and MPW tag team championships, however they would lose all of these matches. However, they would win the 4FW tag team championships in late 2014, defeating The Hunter Brothers.|$|R
50|$|Teako170 is a New York City {{graffiti}}-writer {{from the}} Wakefield {{area of the}} Bronx. He <b>started</b> <b>tagging</b> in 1972 {{at the age of}} seven years when New York graffiti was still in its infancy. In the late 70s, he was primarily seen on the 2s and 5s of the IRT White Plains Road Line until fading from the scene in 1983 when he joined the United States Air Force.|$|R

Tasso can have my pistol." [...] Rudi tapped his belt. [...] "In the Soviet army we didn't have shoes always, but we had guns. With all four of us armed one of us might get to your command bunker. Preferably you, Major." ...|$|R
50|$|An HTML {{attribute}} is a modifier of an HTML element type. An attribute either modifies {{the default}} functionality of an element type or provides functionality to certain element types unable to function correctly without them. In HTML syntax, an attribute {{is added to}} an HTML <b>start</b> <b>tag.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>start</b> <b>tag</b> {{may also}} include {{attributes}} within the tag. These indicate other information, such as identifiers for sections within the document, identifiers used to bind style {{information to the}} presentation of the document, and for some tags such as the [...] used to embed images, the reference to the image resource.|$|E
50|$|In this DTD specification, the {{behavior}} of the tag omission feature is specified for each element by the two characters following the element name. The values can be - or O for disabling and enabling the features. The first character specifies {{the behavior}} of the <b>start</b> <b>tag</b> and the second {{the behavior of}} the end tag.|$|E
3000|$|We tested two {{topics for}} the cotagging topic {{discovery}} process using Flickr photo-sharing site. In the first test, {{we used the}} <b>starting</b> <b>tag</b> [...] "flowers," [...] and we collected 3601 images whose tags contain the keyword flowers. From this 3601 -image tag set, we found the following tags {{that occur in the}} top cotagging list (after removing a few noise tags such as [...] "nikon," [...] that are easy to identify since they correspond to camera properties and not media object properties).|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Homem Primata" [...] at first shows black & white {{shots of the}} band walking among a crowd, {{alternating}} with images of pre-historical men. Then, in now colorful shots, the band <b>starts</b> <b>tagging</b> a 1950s truck with graffiti (illustrations include the anarchist symbol) before they start performing the song on board of it while someone drives it {{through the center of}} São Paulo. This ride is alternated with images of the band performing inside a cage, with people watching from outside.|$|R
50|$|Luke phones Steph but ends up {{talking to}} Dr. Squires {{and they go}} out to a bar. Another client of Luke's shows up and while getting drunk and high, they get kicked out for underage drinking. Luke and Dr. Squires are walking from the bar and <b>start</b> <b>tagging</b> a wall but are apprehended by the police. Steph bails them out of jail and, against Dr. Squires' wishes, takes Luke out for the day. Luke and Steph end up kissing. When Luke gets home, he finds he has strong {{feelings}} for her.|$|R
5000|$|HTML markup {{consists}} of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like [...] and , although some represent empty elements {{and so are}} unpaired, for example [...] The first tag in such a pair is the <b>start</b> <b>tag,</b> {{and the second is}} the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).|$|E
5000|$|There is an {{attribute}} information item for each attribute (specified or defaulted) of each {{element in the}} document, including namespace declarations. The latter however appear as members of an element's attributes property rather than its attributes property. Attributes declared in the DTD with no default value and not specified in the element's <b>start</b> <b>tag</b> are not represented by attribute information items. An attribute information item has the following properties: ...|$|E
5000|$|... tagbody is a {{primitive}} Common Lisp special operator which provides {{the ability to}} name tags and use the go form to jump to those tags. The backquote ` provides a notation that provides code templates, where the value of forms preceded with a comma are filled in. Forms preceded with comma and at-sign are spliced in. The tagbody form tests the end condition. If the condition is true, it jumps to the end tag. Otherwise the provided body code is executed and then it jumps to the <b>start</b> <b>tag.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The band {{continued}} for another nine months with Todd Baechle on bass and Ben Armstrong on drums. They toured the East Coast, but Oberst {{began to feel}} penned in by the band. [...] "It lost its luster and I got {{fed up with the}} big 'emo music' craze. We got tagged as an emo band right off the bat. A lot of cool bands were playing that style of music, then a huge number of bands <b>started</b> <b>tagging</b> along, and suddenly everyone was getting thrown in the emo category. These days, I think of emo as a negative term." ...|$|R
5000|$|As HTML {{is based}} on SGML, its parsing also depends {{on the use of}} a DTD, {{specifically}} an HTML DTD such as that for HTML 4.01. The DTD specifies which element types are possible (i.e. it defines the set of element types that go to make up HTML) and it also specifies the valid combinations in which they may appear in a document. It is part of general SGML behaviour that where only one valid structure is possible (per the DTD), it is not generally a requirement that the document explicitly states that structure. As a simple example, the [...] <b>start</b> <b>tag</b> indicating the start of a paragraph element should be closed by a [...] end tag, indicating the end of the element. Also the DTD states that paragraph elements cannot be nested. The HTML document fragment: ...|$|E
30|$|The {{interval}} of flow represents {{that the next}} packet must wait for the period when the packet departs from the system. Since the system reserves the bandwidth for the flow, {{this means that the}} {{interval of}} flow is decided by its weight. In other words, the larger the weight of flow, the shorter is the flow interval. If errors happen for the backlogged flow, it must relinquish the slot to another flow with clean channel and updates its <b>start</b> <b>tag</b> and finish tag.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a smaller-sized procedure for regiospecific analysis of triacylglycerols (TAG) using boric acid high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC). Cod liver/mackerel, bonito head, and seal oils TAG (2 mg) were partially hydrolyzed by ethyl magnesium bromide, and resulting 1 (3) -and 2 -monoacylglycerols (MAG) were isolated by the HPTLC. Fatty acids of the 1 (3) -and 2 -MAG {{were analyzed by}} gas-liquid chromatography (GLC). Positional distributions of fatty acids in TAG observed for the three marine oils {{were similar to those}} previously determined by the procedure requiring 100 mg of <b>starting</b> <b>TAG.</b> The new procedure appeared to be usable for regiospecific analysis of a few milligrams of marine oils TAG...|$|R
5000|$|Brad Keselowski {{was going}} for the [...] "perfect weekend" [...] (topping the charts in every {{practice}} session along with winning the pole), but he came up short as Jeff Gordon was the fastest in the final practice session {{with a time of}} 28.139 and a speed of 135.357 mph. Corey Lajoie, who was making his first Sprint Cup Series <b>start,</b> <b>tagged</b> the wall in turn 4. Greg Biffle spun out exiting turn 2. The only damage that was sustained was a flat right-rear tire. In the closing seconds of the session, Tony Stewart got loose coming off of turn 4 and spun sideways down the front stretch.|$|R
