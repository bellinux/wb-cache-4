5|$|Heaven is {{represented}} by an entrance to the Heavenly City, which is in a contemporary Gothic style illuminated by long, thin rays of light. The saved approach clasping their hands in prayer, and are greeted at the entrance by an angel. Only a few souls pass through the heavenly gates at a time. The imagery of a church as an earthly representation of Heaven was popularised in the 13th century by theologians such as Durandus; the gate to Heaven in this work resembles {{the entrance to the}} Beaune hospice. The way to Heaven is shown clearly as a gilded church– the saved ascend a set of steps, turn right, and disappear from sight. It is fully enclosed in a <b>single</b> <b>panel,</b> whereas Hell extends onto the adjoining panel, perhaps hinting that sin contaminates all around it.|$|E
5|$|Removing the {{original}} tablet {{to the victims}} of the East Ham Sewage Works accident had left an unsightly gap in {{the original}} row of tiles. In 1931, Mary Watts tracked down Fred Passenger, a former employee of DeMorgan who had, after the closure of the business, set up his own ceramics business using DeMorgan designs. Passenger was by this time working for a pottery business in Bushey Heath established by artist Ida Perrin, but Mary Watts persuaded him to produce a <b>single</b> <b>panel</b> in the style of DeMorgan to fit into the empty space. Herbert Maconoghu, a schoolboy who had died in 1882 attempting to rescue two friends from drowning, {{had been one of the}} names originally suggested by Watts, and Passenger produced a tablet to Maconoghu in the style of the original central row, which was installed in April 1931. Maconoghu was actually Herbert Moore McConaghey, the son of Matthew and Martha McConaghey, and he was born in Mynpoorie in Indian where Matthew was working as a settlement officer for the Imperial Civil Service.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two major}} styles used in {{newspaper}} comics, <b>single</b> <b>panels</b> and strips. <b>Single</b> <b>panels</b> usually, but not always, are not broken up and lack continuity. The popular Dennis the Menace and The Family Circus are both <b>single</b> <b>panels.</b> Strips {{on the other hand}} are generally longer and shaped into a rectangle. Strips include Peanuts and Garfield. J. R. Williams' long-run Out Our Way continued as a daily panel even after it expanded into a Sunday strip, Out Our Way with the Willets. Jimmy Hatlo's They'll Do It Every Time was often displayed in a two-panel format with the first panel showing some deceptive, pretentious, unwitting or scheming human behavior and the second panel revealing the truth of the situation.|$|R
50|$|The two {{conventional}} formats {{for daily}} newspaper comics are strips and <b>single</b> gag <b>panels.</b> The strips are usually displayed horizontally, wider {{than they are}} tall. Strips are usually, but not always, are broken up into several smaller panels with continuity from <b>panel</b> to <b>panel.</b> <b>Single</b> <b>panels</b> are square, circular or taller than they are wide. One of the leading <b>single</b> gag <b>panels</b> for decades, Grin and Bear It, was created in 1932 by George Lichty and syndicated by Field Enterprises.|$|R

50|$|The first {{cartoons}} {{to appear}} in Argentina were editorial cartoons in political satire magazines {{at the end of}} the 19th century. These cartoons, originally <b>single</b> <b>panels,</b> quickly evolved to multiple panel constructions with sequential action. Many used methods such as text indicating dialogue emanating from the speaker's mouth, or text below the drawings for dialogue and explanation.|$|R
25|$|In some cases, several {{events which}} {{chronologically}} occur {{one after another}} are depicted in a <b>single</b> <b>panel,</b> leading to an odd sense of multiplicity. This was an artistic convention of the time, much used in illuminated manuscripts. So for example, Adam appears twice in the scene of his awakening by God the Father.|$|E

50|$|Storytelling using a {{sequence}} of pictures has existed through history. One medieval European example in textile form is the Bayeux Tapestry.

25|$|Dennis the Menace {{is a daily}} {{syndicated}} newspaper {{comic strip}} originally created, written, and illustrated by Hank Ketcham. It debuted on March 12, 1951, in 16 newspapers and was originally distributed by Post-Hall Syndicate. It is now written and drawn by Ketcham's former assistants, Marcus Hamilton (weekdays, since 1995), Ron Ferdinand (Sundays, since 1981), and son Scott Ketcham (since 2010), and distributed to at least 1,000 newspapers in 48 countries and in 19 languages by King Features Syndicate.

25|$|The {{character}} {{who would later}} become the Yellow Kid first {{appeared on the scene}} in a minor supporting role in cartoon panel published in Truth magazine in 1894 and 1895. The four different black-and-white <b>single</b> <b>panel</b> cartoons were deemed popular, and one of them, Fourth Ward Brownies, was reprinted on 17 February 1895 in Joseph Pulitzer's New York World, where Outcault worked as a technical drawing artist. The World published another, newer Hogan's Alley cartoon less than a month later, and this was followed by the strip's first color printing on 5 May 1895. Hogan's Alley gradually became a full-page Sunday color cartoon with the Yellow Kid (who was also appearing several times a week) as its lead character.|$|E
25|$|Panelization is a {{procedure}} whereby {{a number of}} PCBs are grouped for manufacturing onto a larger board - the panel. Usually a panel consists of a single design but sometimes multiple designs are mixed on a <b>single</b> <b>panel.</b> There {{are two types of}} panels: assembly panels - often called arrays - and bare board manufacturing panels. The assemblers often mount components on panels rather than single PCBs because this is efficient. The bare board manufactures always uses panels, not only for efficiency, but because of the requirements of the plating process. Thus a manufacturing panel can consist of a grouping of individual PCBs or of arrays, depending on what must be delivered.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{structural}} behaviour of two connected Sandwiched Precast Lightweight Foamed Concrete Panel (PLFP) {{in term of}} their load bearing capacities and failure modes. Three (3) connected PLFP panels were cast using foamed concrete as the wythe and polystyrene as the core layer. Each connected panel were cast from two <b>single</b> <b>panels</b> connected using L-bar connection. The panels were strengthened with steel bar reinforcement embedded in both wythes which were connected to each other by the steel shear truss connectors. The connected PLFP panels were tested under flexural load. A <b>single</b> PLFP <b>panel</b> was cast as a control panel and tested under axial load. The results were analysed in term of the panel’s ultimate load, crack pattern and mode of failure. Results showed that the two connected PLFP panels were able to sustain slightly lower ultimate load compared to <b>single</b> PLFP <b>panel.</b> Crack at 45 degree angle at top half of panel and small crack at surface between joint of the connection were observed...|$|R

500|$|Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan) (c. 1410–1451) was a German painter {{working in}} the late [...] "soft style" [...] of the International Gothic. His {{paintings}} combine that era's tendency towards long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, [...] a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner {{was one of the}} most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include <b>single</b> <b>panel</b> oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and dark blue winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence.|$|E

500|$|The Green Goblin {{debuted in}} The Amazing Spider-Man #14. At this time his {{identity}} was unknown, but he proved popular and reappeared in later issues, which {{made a point}} of his secret identity. According to both Stan Lee and John Romita, Sr., who replaced Ditko as the title's artist, Lee always wanted the Green Goblin to be someone Peter Parker knew, while Ditko wanted his civilian identity to be someone who hadn't yet been introduced. Lee elaborated: [...] "Steve wanted him to turn out to be just some character that we had never seen before. Because, he said, in real life, very often a villain turns out to be somebody that you never knew. And I felt that that would be wrong. I felt, in a sense, it would be like cheating the reader. ... if it's somebody you didn't know and had never seen, then {{what was the point of}} following all the clues? I think that frustrates the reader." [...] However, Lee prefaced this statement by admitting that, due to his self-professed poor memory, he may have been confusing the Green Goblin with a different character, and in an earlier essay he had said that he could not remember whether Norman Osborn being the Green Goblin was his idea or Ditko's. Ditko has maintained that it was his idea, even claiming that he had decided on it before the first Green Goblin story was finished, and that a character he drew in the background of a <b>single</b> <b>panel</b> of Amazing Spider-Man #23 was meant to be Norman Osborn (who is not introduced until issue #37).|$|E
