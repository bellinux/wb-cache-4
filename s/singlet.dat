5|$|Persistent carbenes {{can exist}} in the <b>singlet</b> or the triplet states with the <b>singlet</b> state carbenes being more stable. The {{relative}} stability of these compounds is only partly due to steric hindrance by bulky groups. Some <b>singlet</b> carbenes are thermodynamically stable {{in the absence of}} moisture and (in most cases) oxygen, and can be isolated and indefinitely stored. Others dimerise slowly over days. Triplet state carbenes have half-lives measured in seconds, and therefore can be observed but not stored.|$|E
5|$|The {{spectroscopy}} {{of molecular}} oxygen {{is associated with}} the atmospheric processes of aurora and airglow. The absorption in the Herzberg continuum and Schumann–Runge bands in the ultraviolet produces atomic oxygen that is important in the chemistry of the middle atmosphere. Excited state <b>singlet</b> molecular oxygen is responsible for red chemiluminescence in solution.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{dimerisation}} of {{triplet state}} carbenes, these <b>singlet</b> state carbenes do not approach {{head to head}} ("least motion"), but rather the carbene lone pair attacks the empty carbon p-orbital ("non-least motion"). Carbene dimerisation can be catalyzed by both acids and metals.|$|E

25|$|<b>Singlet</b> oxygen {{is highly}} reactive, {{especially}} with organic compounds that contain double bonds. The resulting {{damage caused by}} <b>singlet</b> oxygen reduces the photosynthetic efficiency of chloroplasts. In plants exposed to excess light, the increased production of <b>singlet</b> oxygen can result in cell death. Various substances such as carotenoids, tocopherols and plastoquinones contained in chloroplasts quench <b>singlet</b> oxygen and protect against its toxic effects. In addition to direct toxicity, <b>singlet</b> oxygen acts a signaling molecule. Oxidized products of β-carotene arising from the presence of <b>singlet</b> oxygen act as second messengers that can either protect against <b>singlet</b> oxygen induced toxicity or initiate programmed cell death. Levels of jasmonate {{play a key role}} in the decision between cell acclimation or cell death in response to elevated levels of this reactive oxygen species.|$|E
25|$|The {{molecule}} {{is excited}} with near infrared radiation to the <b>singlet</b> state (with no unpaired electrons).

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{under which}} conditions <b>singlets</b> of fermionic gauge symmetries which are "square roots of gravity" can exist. Their existence is non-trivial {{because there are}} no fields neutral in gravity. We tabulate several examples of <b>singlets</b> of global and local supersymmetry and Îº-symmetry and show how in each case the gravity effect is cancelled by other gauge symmetries. We point out that the finding of Îº-symmetry <b>singlets</b> is essential for a covariant quantization of extended objects with manifest spacetime supersymmetry. Their role in string compactification is discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{models with}} multiple Higgs scalar gauge <b>singlets</b> {{and the resulting}} restrictions on the parameters from precision electroweak measurements. In these models, the scalar <b>singlets</b> mix with the SU(2) Higgs doublet, potentially leading to reduced couplings of the scalars to fermions and gauge bosons relative to the Standard Model Higgs boson couplings. Such models can make the Higgs sector difficult to explore at the LHC. We emphasize the new physics resulting from the addition {{of at least two}} scalar Higgs <b>singlets.</b> Comment: 13 page...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{thorough}} {{crystal structure}} determination {{at very low}} temperature of (CuCl) LaNb₂O₇, originally proposed as a spin- 1 / 2 square-lattice antiferromagnet, is reported thanks {{to the use of}} single-crystal x-ray diffraction and powder neutron diffraction. State-of-the-art calculations (maximum entropy method) reveal that (CuCl) LaNb₂O₇ is orthorhombic with Pbam symmetry. First-principles calculations demonstrate that the dominant magnetic interactions are antiferromagnetic between fourth nearest neighbors with a Cu-Cl-Cl-Cu exchange path, which lead to the formation of spin <b>singlets.</b> The two strongest interactions between the <b>singlets</b> are ferromagnetic, which makes (CuCl) LaNb₂O₇ the first system of ferromagnetically coupled Shastry-Sutherland quantum spin <b>singlets...</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{heavy metal}} atom at {{the centre of}} these {{complexes}} exhibits strong spin-orbit coupling, facilitating intersystem crossing between <b>singlet</b> and triplet states. By using these phosphorescent materials, both <b>singlet</b> and triplet excitons {{will be able to}} decay radiatively, hence improving the internal quantum efficiency of the device compared to a standard pleaded where only the <b>singlet</b> states will contribute to emission of light.|$|E
25|$|As {{electrons}} and holes are fermions with half integer spin, an exciton may {{either be in}} a <b>singlet</b> state or a triplet state {{depending on how the}} spins of the electron and hole have been combined. Statistically three triplet excitons will be formed for each <b>singlet</b> exciton. Decay from triplet states (phosphorescence) is spin forbidden, increasing the timescale of the transition and limiting the internal efficiency of fluorescent devices. Phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes make use of spin–orbit interactions to facilitate intersystem crossing between <b>singlet</b> and triplet states, thus obtaining emission from both <b>singlet</b> and triplet states and improving the internal efficiency.|$|E
25|$|The mechanism(s) of photoinhibition {{are under}} debate, several {{mechanisms}} have been suggested. Reactive oxygen species, especially <b>singlet</b> oxygen, {{have a role}} in the acceptor-side, <b>singlet</b> oxygen and low-light mechanisms. In the manganese mechanism and the donor side mechanism, reactive oxygen species do not play a direct role. Photoinhibited PSII produces <b>singlet</b> oxygen, and reactive oxygen species inhibit the repair cycle of PSII by inhibiting protein synthesis in the chloroplast.|$|E

25|$|These are {{equivalent}} to the Gell-Mann matrices. The critical feature of these particular eight states {{is that they are}} linearly independent, and also independent of the <b>singlet</b> state, hence 321 or 23. There is no way to add any combination of these states to produce any other, and it is also impossible to add them to make r, g, or b the forbidden <b>singlet</b> state. There are many other possible choices, but all are mathematically equivalent, at least equally complicated, and give the same physical results.|$|E

50|$|<b>Singlets</b> and {{the related}} spin {{concepts}} of doublets and triplets occur frequently in atomic physics and nuclear physics, where one often needs to determine the total spin {{of a collection of}} particles.
