40|$|Thin glass sheets (thickness &# 60; 1 mm) {{have a great}} {{potential}} in OLED and LCD displays. While the conventional manufacturing methods, such as mechanical <b>scribing</b> <b>and</b> <b>breaking,</b> result in poor edge strength, ultra-short-pulsed laser processing could be a promising solution, offering high-quality cutting edges. However laser precision glass cutting suffers from unwanted material modification and even severe damage (e. g. cracks and chipping). Therefore {{it is essential to}} have a deep understanding of the ultra-short-pulsed laser ablation mechanism of transparent dielectrics in order to remedy those drawbacks. In this work, the ablation mechanism of transparent dielectrics irradiated by picosecond laser pulses has been studied. Ultrafast dynamics of free-electrons is analyzed using a rate equation for free-electron density including multi-photon ionization, avalanche ionization and loss terms. Two maps of free-electron density in parameter space are given to discuss the dependence of ablation threshold intensity/fluence on pulse duration. The laser ablation model describing laser beam propagation and energy deposition in transparent dielectrics is presented. Based on our model, simulations and experiments have been performed to study the ablation dynamics. Both simulation and experimental results show good agreement, offering {{great potential}} for optimization of laser processing in transparent dielectrics. The effects of recombination coefficient and electron-collision time on our model are investigated...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDie {{separation}} {{processes for}} compound semiconductor devices are typically based on either diamond <b>scribe</b> <b>and</b> <b>break</b> techniques or on ganged sawing of the substrate using water-cooled saws. These mechanically dependent processes can suffer from several limitations, including overall throughput {{of the process}} (and throughput scalability as wafer sizes increase), physical damage to the dies incurred during the sawing or scribing operation, and the real estate cost of needing large scribe lines or streets for relatively small devices like LEDs. A plasma etch process has been developed for compound semiconductor device die separation, eliminating the real estate penalty, physical damage caused by mechanical processes, and has no scaling issues associated with larger wafer diameters [...] This article will report on the overall benefits of the plasma etch die separation processes, offer some cost of ownership comparisons, and show results from work performed for LED die separation using plasma etch...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} experimental {{study on the}} influence of laser cutting on the flexural strength of 0. 63 mm thick alumina sheets. In this study ceramic specimens are cut to a size of 24 × 3 mm 2 with the flexural strength being measured using a 3 point bending test. Based on a design of experiments approach the results reveal that among the experimental parameters the laser focus po-sition has the highest influence on the flexural strength, reducing it by 63 MPa. Cutting alumina at 300 mm/s yields a flexural strength of 395 MPa, which is significantly lower as compared with ref-erence samples produced by <b>scribe</b> <b>and</b> <b>break</b> having a flexural strength of 520 MPa. Yet, a compa-rable flexural strength of 311 MPa using a CO 2 laser is achieved at only 20 mm/s. To cut small con-tours, digital modulation of the fiber laser output power is employed leading to a flexural strength of 506 MPa at 1 mm/s and 469 MPa at 10 mm/s. Further results show that additional outer contours can halve the flexural strength and the lack of rounding reduces the flexural strength further. Inner contours especially with corners are also decreasing the flexural strength drastically while an inner circle causes only low strength reduction...|$|E
40|$|Motivation During {{research}} and development regarding next generation solar cells, many experiments are performed on multi-crystalline silicon (Si) wafers. One regular task is the separation of different areas of interest on a Si wafer. Separating multi-crystalline Si wafers implies one major challenge: Breaking the samples manually leads most often to a heap of Si crumbs which are only useful with limitations afterwards. This paper investigates the applicability of a novel wafer separation method, the thermal laser separation (TLS), on the separation of multi-crystalline Si wafers. TLS has already proven its applicability in the dicing of mono-crystalline Si wafers [1]. For the dicing of multi-crystalline Si, TLS will be compared to manual <b>scribe</b> <b>and</b> <b>break</b> and the mechanical wafer saw. E ach method is applied to wire saw cut multi-crystalline Si wafers. The methods are briefly described, experimental results are compared {{with each other and}} the separation methods are evaluated. Approach Samples of wire saw cut Si wafers (156 mm x 156 mm) are used to evaluate three separation methods. Each sample should be separated into squares of 20 mm edge length. For the sample preparation an accuracy of ap-prox. 100 μm in straightness is sufficient. The following separation methods are evaluated: Scribe and break: An initial scribe is applied manually {{at the edge of the}} samples with a diamond tip. The sam-ples are then broken manually by bending both sides of the sample around this initial scribe with tweezers. Mechanical wafer saw: Fast rotating (30. 000 rpm) diamond blades ar e used to separate the Si wafers by remov-ing material of the size of the blade width. Thermal Laser Separation [1]: The TLS process is a cleaving process that uses thermal-induced mechanical stress and which comprises two steps. To initiate the process, a small initial scribe is required, which is done with a diamond tool tip or with a special scribing laser (step 1). In this case, a diamond tool tip is used. The initial scribe gives the cleaving process a well-defined starting point. During the cleaving step (step 2), the material is heated up by a laser and directly after the laser spot the material is cooled down by a water aerosol. This combi-nation of heating up and cooling down the material results in a large temperature gradient inducing tensile stress inside the material. The ten sile stress opens a crack starting from the initial scribe and the crack is guided through the material by the movement of the laser-cooling combination. Sample preparation For the <b>scribe</b> <b>and</b> <b>break</b> no special preparation is necessary. As the mechanical wafer saw is a typical dicing technology, it is necessary to mount the wafers on dicing tape which has a sticky layer that holds the Si wafer on a thin metal dicing frame. In this case a UV tape is used. This tapes adhesiveness can be reduced by UV irradiating the tape after the dicing process. Separated samples can then be demounted manually. Even though the TLS-technology works also normally with dicing tape, it is not necessary to use it due to the fact that no external mechanical stress is applied to the samples compared to the mechan ical wafer saw. That is why the samples are just put on a vacuum chuck without special additional preparation. Results Results of separating multi-crystalline Si samples are shown in the figures below: <b>Scribe</b> <b>and</b> <b>break</b> (Figure 1) : The small arrows denote the manually applied diamond scribes. As can be seen from Figure 1 it is impossible to separate the samples into rectangular pieces. This process result does not fulfill the above specifications. Mechanical wafer saw (Figure 2) : With the mechanical saw it is possible to separate the samples into the speci-fied rectangular pieces with good straightness. Major drawback is the time-consuming sample preparation be-cause of the need for the mounting process prior to the separation and the demounting process after the separa-tion. Chipping a t the sample edges (indicated by the arrows) might reduce the breaking strength of the samples (currently under investigation). Thermal Laser Separation (Figure 3) : The TLS-process results also in rectangular pieces, but of lower straight-ness as the saw-result; compare arrow in Figure 3 (quantitative analysis ongoing). The TLS-process is less time-consuming, because no special preparation is necessary and the separation process works at high velocities up to 300 mm/s (wafer saw 10 mm/s in this case). Conclusion It was shown that for the preparation of multi-crystalline Si wafers as envisaged here, the TLS-technology pro-vides the fastest results with low preparation effort and, compared to the mechanical wafer saw, with a sufficient straightness. Investigations on the resulting bending strength and a quantitative analysis of the achieved straightness are being continued and will be presented in the final paper...|$|E

40|$|The <b>scribe</b> <b>and</b> <b>break</b> {{technique}} (or dicing) is {{a widely}} employed method in the industry of semiconductors to separate infrared laser diodes made from gallium arsenide (GaAs). The scribing step allows to create a precursor crack which is then propagated during the breaking step, along preferential { 110 } cleavage planes of GaAs. The main drawback of the scribing process is that it generates a lot of undesirable cracks and particles that degrade the performances of devices. In this dissertation, we have investigated the indentation process as a possible way to replace the scribing operation. For that purpose, we have investigated the morphology of the crack field and the cracking sequence {{as a function of}} the indenter geometry (shape, apex angle) and experimental conditions (maximal load, loading rate). Such investigations have been made with the help of a new tool: the in-situ SEM instrumented indentation which allows us to establish the cracking sequence and to correlate direct observations with the load-displacement histories. A new experimental technique has also been developed: cleavage cross-sectioning techniques allow us to determine the morphology of the crack field beneath the surface. The second research axis was focused on the interaction between deformation mechanisms and crack initiation. These investigations have been conducted with the help of Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and cathodoluminescence. In the first part of the dissertation, we have shown that acute wedge indenters with an included angle of 60 ° promote the formation of a well defined half-penny crack, the nucleation of which is affected by load rate and indenter radius. The relation between the final half-penny crack size and the maximum indentation load was made with the help of a fracture mechanics model. The crack field has been compared for several indenter shape including conical (60 ° and 120 ° apex angles), cube corner and Vickers indenters. In the second part of this dissertation we have determined that the indenter apex angle influences the slip systems that are activated and the nature of dislocations that are found under the indenter. In particular, we have shown that below 60 ° wedge indenters, mainly diverging slip systems are activated whereas under obtuse wedge indenters, mainly converging slip systems are activated. The converging pattern predominant under obtuse indenters is correlated with a delayed half-penny crack formation and is so interpreted as a plastic shielding phenomenon. Some experiments have been performed on commercial devices under production conditions. Although some adjustments are needed to reduce the chipping-out effect that occurs at the indenter extremities, the results are encouraging...|$|E
