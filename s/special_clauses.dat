With the onset of Russian rule, the Tsarist authorities encouraged resettlement of Armenians to Nakhchivan and other areas of the Caucasus from the Persian and Ottoman Empires. <b>Special</b> <b>clauses</b> of the Turkmenchay and Adrianople treaties allowed for this. Alexandr Griboyedov, the Russian envoy to Persia, stated that by the time Nakhchivan came under Russian rule, there had been 290 native Armenians families in the province excluding the city of Nakhchivan, the number of Muslim families was 1,632, and the number of the Armenian immigrant families was 943. The same numbers in the city of Nakhchivan were 114, 392 and 285 respectively. With such a dramatic influx of Armenian immigrants, Griboyedov noted friction arising between the Armenian and Muslim populations.

So far, insights from established economic theories have rarely been applied to terminal concessions in seaports.

This contribution provides a detailed overview of the different phases of the terminal awarding process, including a classification scheme for awarding procedures, and contains an extensive discussion on the economic issues that require further investigation. The paper concludes by proposing a comprehensive research agenda on the topic. ...|$|E
40|$|Under {{the auspices}} of the Council of Europe more than 200 {{international}} agreements were drafted and concluded. They foster closer cooperation primarily among member states and set PanEuropean legal standards. In some Council of Europe conventions <b>special</b> <b>clauses</b> have been introduced that allow a group of parties for a derogation from convention obligations - they are known as “disconnection clauses”. Disconnection clauses resemble conflict of law rules, are general in nature, normally are formulated in a unconditional way, and operate automatically. They are meant to provide protection for regulations established by more closely integrated states, e. g. Nordic states or the European Union. For the latter, they are crucial as they safeguard the EU autonomy and uphold primacy of EU rules visàvis international obligations of member states. Yet disconnection clauses raise much concern as contributing to further fragmentation of international law and may possibly have a disadvantageous effect on compliance with and consistency of legal standards in Europe...|$|E

40|$|Australia’s current {{migration}} {{legislation has}} a number of privative or ‘ouster’ clauses that either limit or bypass the judicial review processes. The partial suspension or withdrawal of the juridical order has been characterised by juridical exceptionalism with the insertion of these <b>special</b> <b>clauses</b> into legislation that confer wide discretionary powers on public offices and limit particular types of judicial inquiry. Such clauses attempt to restrict the obligations of ministerial review and they impose strict time limits on appellants seeking to challenge decisions made by ministers and their delegates. The application of privative clauses in federal legislation, particularly in migration legislation, has been a controversial aspect of recent policy making because this process challenges the separation of powers principle inherent in democratic systems of government. As a result, the contestation between the powers of the law makers and the oversight function of the judiciary has far reaching consequences for Australian democracy, and it opposes long established common law principles that legislative action should not be immune from judicial oversight. This paper argues that the insertion of privative clauses into Australia’s migration legislation has significantly reduced the degree of separation between the legislature and the judiciary {{to such an extent that}} government migration policy is ethically deficient and, as the High Court has recently determined, legally flawed...|$|E
40|$|Multi-wavelength astronomical studies require cross-identification of detections of {{the same}} {{celestial}} objects in multiple catalogs based on spherical coordinates and other properties. Because of the large data volumes and spherical geometry, the symmetric N-way association of astronomical detections is a computationally intensive problem, even when sophisticated indexing schemes are used to exclude obviously false candidates. Legacy astronomical catalogs already contain detections {{of more than a}} hundred million objects while the ongoing and future surveys will produce catalogs of billions of objects with multiple detections of each at different times. The varying statistical error of position measurements, moving and extended objects, and other physical properties make it necessary to perform the cross-identification using a mathematically correct, proper Bayesian probabilistic algorithm, capable of including various priors. One time, pair-wise cross-identification of these large catalogs is not sufficient for many astronomical scenarios. Consequently, a novel system is necessary that can cross-identify multiple catalogs on-demand, efficiently and reliably. In this paper, we present our solution based on a cluster of commodity servers and ordinary relational databases. The cross-identification problems are formulated in a language based on SQL, but extended with <b>special</b> <b>clauses.</b> These special queries are partitioned spatially by coordinate ranges and compiled into a complex workflow of ordinary SQL queries. Workflows are then executed in a parallel framework using a cluster of servers hosting identical mirrors {{of the same}} data sets...|$|E
40|$|M. Ing. Timber is an organic, {{orthotropic}} {{material of}} which the strength is currently not fully utilised in structural designs. Most design codes treat timber as an isotropic material with <b>special</b> <b>clauses</b> {{to compensate for the}} weaker strength across the grain. Several safety factors are used to accommodate the large variations in the strength of timber. In the orthotropic approach presented here, the unidirectional properties of timber are assumed as constant. It is also assumed that the large strength variation which is observed between samples of the same group, can mostly be attributed to the grain slope variation in a sample. The finite element method is employed to model grain slopes around a predetermined defect in a sample. The sample is then forced to fail at this defect, and the finite element model is then analyzed at the failure load to determine which stress combination led to the failure. Initial unidirectional material strengths are used in a failure criterion to evaluate the critical stress combination. The method of least squares is used to fit the predicted strength against the experimental strength. In this process new values are found for the unidirectional material strengths. The process is then repeated to determine whether another stress combination is not more critical than the original choice. As soon as the numerically acquired material strengths stabilise, it is compared with known values. The results indicate that the strength of a timber section can be predicted {{on the grounds of the}} observed fibre directions if the unidirectional material strengths are known...|$|E
