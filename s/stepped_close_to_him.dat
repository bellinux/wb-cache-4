60|$|They {{crossed the}} road to the hotel. The {{concierge}} removed his hat as they turned to enter. To all appearances he was unchanged--fat, florid, splendid. Draconmeyer <b>stepped</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|Barney {{touched the}} bell once more, and {{presently}} {{an officer of}} the Blentz faction answered the summons. As the man closed the door and approached, saluting, Barney <b>stepped</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|There was no discussion. Michael's {{jaw dropped}} and his forefeet began their restless lifting after several {{measures}} had been played. And Harris Collins <b>stepped</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and sang {{with him and}} in accord.|$|E
60|$|In her earnestness she <b>stepped</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> {{repelled}} yet {{fascinated by}} the sudden transition of his moods. That he would fight for her was at once horrible and wonderful.|$|R
60|$|She <b>stepped</b> <b>close</b> up <b>to</b> <b>him</b> {{and rested}} her hand lightly upon his shoulder.|$|R
60|$|She <b>stepped</b> <b>close</b> up <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> and {{bending over}} {{him as he}} sat there, crushed by realization, she lowered her voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said I to him, [...] "Friday, {{what will}} you do now? Why don't you shoot him?"--"No shoot," [...] says Friday, [...] "no yet; me shoot now me no kill; me stay, give you one more laugh;" [...] and indeed so he did, as you will see presently; for when the bear saw his enemy gone, he comes back from the bough where he stood, but did it mighty leisurely, looking behind him every step, and coming {{backward}} till he got into the body of the tree; then with the same hinder end foremost, he came down the tree; grasping it with his claws, and moving one foot at a time, very leisurely. At this juncture, and just before he could set his hind feet upon the ground, Friday <b>stepped</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> clapped the muzzle of his piece into his ear, and shot him as dead as a stone.|$|E
60|$|Salensus Oll looked puzzled. He {{turned again}} and looked upon Dejah Thoris, and then Thurid <b>stepped</b> quite <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and whispered {{something}} in his ear--what, I know not.|$|R
60|$|She stood up, quietly, and waited. The rough hardihood of {{the ring}} fell from him like a garment: he blushed deeply, {{and did not know}} what to do. Nor did she; but without willing it she came a <b>step</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> and turned up her face towards his. He, nearly blind with confusion, put his arms about her and kissed her. Suddenly she broke loose from his arms, seized the lapels of his coat tightly in her hands, and leaned back until she nearly hung from him with all her weight.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Dewes, who had {{all along}} {{had the most}} {{profound}} conviction of the guilt of the accused man seized his opportunity, and <b>stepping</b> <b>close</b> up <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> whispered in his ear: ...|$|R

6000|$|As Smangle {{pronounced}} {{the last three}} words, he stopped suddenly, reclosed the door which he had opened, and, walking softly back <b>to</b> Mr. Pickwick, <b>stepped</b> <b>close</b> up <b>to</b> <b>him</b> on tiptoe, and said, in a very soft whisper-- ...|$|R
60|$|The {{fingers of}} the man fumbled as he spoke at his waist-belt, near the handle of his knife. Observing this, Grummidge kept a watchful eye on him, but did not abate his nonchalant free-and-easy air, as he <b>stepped</b> <b>close</b> up <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Citizen-aristocrat, {{consider}} your words!" [...] La Boulaye had <b>stepped</b> <b>close</b> up <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> {{and his voice}} throbbed with a sudden anger no whit less compelling than Ombreval's. [...] "Fool! let me hear that word again, applied either to me or to any of my followers, and I'll have you beaten like a dog." ...|$|R
60|$|Adam resolutely avoided {{speech with}} the Prince, {{whenever}} possible, but the latter's provocative and sarcastic speech roused his dormant hatred; {{like a dog}} who has been worried, he now turned abruptly round and faced Sir Marmaduke, <b>stepping</b> <b>close</b> up <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> his eyes glaring with vindictive rage, a savage snarl rising in his throat.|$|R
60|$|The bear did {{not move}} as they {{approached}} him, and they fired on <b>him,</b> without seeming <b>to</b> injure <b>him</b> in the least. At length one of them <b>stepped</b> up quite <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> and put a ball into his head just above his eye.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a {{day since}} I wrote last. A strange thing has {{happened}} which will make your blood boil, Jeanne, as it has made mine. I was called out this morning to a little room where questions are sometimes asked us, and {{who do you think}} was there? M. Lebat, the son of the Maire of Dijon--the man who denounced and arrested me. What do you think the wretch had the insolence to say? That he loved me, and that if I would consent <b>to</b> marry <b>him</b> he could save me. He said that his influence would suffice, not only to get me free, but to obtain for me some of our estates, and he told me he would give me time to consider his offer, but that I must remember that nothing could save me if I refused. What do you think I did, Jeanne? Something very unladylike, I am afraid. I made a <b>step</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> and then I gave him a slap on the face which made my fingers tingle, then I made him a deep curtsy and said, 'That is my answer, Monsieur Lebat,' and walked into the great hall again.|$|R
5000|$|Eddi {{first met}} Luc Hemingway {{on the roof}} of the hospital. They later clashed when a hungover Eddi drunkenly climbed onto the roof of Luc's camper van and woke him up. They later {{disagreed}} over the treatment of a patient, but it was clear there was an attraction between them. Millson explained that Eddi usually had the upper hand with everyone, but she initially could not work Luc out and thought he was making fun of her. Millson said it took a seven or eight episodes for her to realise that Luc liked her. Speaking to Laura Pledger from the Radio Times, Millson later said the writers were focussed on developing the relationship between Luc and Eddi. He called them [...] "a very unlikely pair" [...] and thought their relationship was fun and not predictable like others. He commented, [...] "Strangely, that feels much more real and I think - if indeed anything ever does happen - it'll be in a really realistic way, not in a kind of violins and roses way." [...] Potts called Luc [...] "socially inept" [...] and said that every time Eddi took a <b>step</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> he would do something to make her step back again. She revealed that she got fan-mail from people who wanted Eddi and Luc to get together, but Potts thought if they became a couple, it would be [...] "the most dysfunctional relationship on the planet!" ...|$|R
6000|$|She <b>stepped</b> {{a little}} <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> {{as if she}} feared some one might hear her. [...] "Dickory," [...] said she, [...] "he did not put that thing into my mind; it was there already. That was a dreadful ship, Dickory, and {{it was filled with}} dreadful men. If he had not {{intended}} to go with them he would not have put himself into their power, and if he had not intended to be long away he would not have planned to leave me here with my uncle." ...|$|R
60|$|Standing at {{the open}} doorway and {{considering}} {{what he should do}} next, the Captain saw a bird flying toward him out of the forest. It was a turtle-dove, so tame that it fluttered <b>close</b> up <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> At the same moment the sound of sweet laughter became audible among the trees. His heart beat fast; he advanced a few steps and stopped. In a moment more the nymph of the island appeared, in her white robe, ascending the cliff in pursuit of her truant bird. She saw the strange man, and suddenly stood still; struck motionless by the amazing discovery that had burst upon her. The Captain approached, smiling and holding out his hand. She never moved; she stood before him in helpless wonderment--her lovely black eyes fixed spellbound on his face; her dusky bosom palpitating above the fallen folds of her robe; her rich red lips parted in mute astonishment. Feasting his eyes on her beauty in silence, the Captain after a while ventured to speak to her {{in the language of the}} main island. The sound of his voice, addressing her in the words that she understood, roused the lovely creature to action. She started, <b>stepped</b> <b>close</b> up <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> and dropped on her knees at his feet.|$|R
5000|$|The {{third and}} final arc was titled 'Savage City', and was about Bruce's efforts to save his city from the Riddler's control. It begins with Bruce Wayne {{awakening}} in the Duke residence, having removed the Batsuit before falling asleep. A young boy whose life he had saved informs him that the Riddler has taken control of Gotham. Alfred tells Batman to return to Wayne Manor through the secret entrance in the now dilapidated Crime Alley, the site of his parents' murder. Meanwhile, the military sends special forces soldiers to Gotham to help Gordon restore the peace. The Riddler uses a jumbotron every day to tell the people of Gotham that all he wants is a worthy opponent. The Riddler spots Gordon and {{the men on the}} rooftop, sending drones <b>to</b> stop <b>him.</b> The Riddler tries to destroy the building, but Batman stops him. Batman, Gordon, Fox and the soldiers plan a way to stop the Riddler. The next day, the Riddler appears on screen again to say that he will dedicate this [...] "Zero Year" [...] to the people of Gotham. Batman in a new costume comes driving in on a motorcycle and accepts the Riddler's challenge in order to buy time so Fox can discover their location. The Riddler drops Batman into a pit of lions. Batman fights and tames the lions, allowing Fox to find the Riddler's hiding place. Batman, Gordon and Fox try to attack the Riddler, only to fall into a trap. Fox is injured, but Batman saves him. The soldiers call in an airstrike to level Gotham while Batman finds the Riddler, as they play his last game. The Riddler challenges Batman to solve his riddles, allowing <b>him</b> one <b>step</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> on every answer he gets right. Gordon and Fox find a way to stop the jets from destroying Gotham. Batman grabs the Riddler, stopping his game. Gordon creates a Bat signal and successfully stops the jets. The Riddler reveals that to save Gotham, Batman must use his heart to turn the city's power back on; he must attach himself to an electrode. Batman successfully turns Gotham's power back on with the force of his own pulse. One month later, Gotham is back to normal, while the Riddler is put in Arkham Asylum. Bruce gets a visit from Julie Madison, an old flame, and Alfred tells him he has two choices: lead a normal life as Bruce Wayne, or protect Gotham as Batman. When Bruce chooses the latter, Alfred tells Julie that Bruce is [...] "spoken for" [...] as Batman disappears into the night.|$|R
60|$|Wolf Larsen did not laugh, {{though his}} grey eyes lighted {{with a slight}} glint of amusement; and in that moment, having <b>stepped</b> forward quite <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> I {{received}} my first impression of the man himself, of the man as apart from his body, and from the torrent of blasphemy I had heard him spew forth. The face, with large features and strong lines, of the square order, yet well filled out, was apparently massive at first sight; but again, as with the body, the massiveness seemed to vanish, and a conviction to grow of a tremendous and excessive mental or spiritual strength that lay behind, sleeping in the deeps of his being. The jaw, the chin, the brow rising to a goodly height and swelling heavily above the eyes,—these, while strong in themselves, unusually strong, seemed to speak an immense vigour or virility of spirit that lay behind and beyond and out of sight. There was no sounding such a spirit, no measuring, no determining of metes and bounds, nor neatly classifying in some pigeon-hole with others of similar type.|$|R
60|$|When {{we came to}} the tree, {{there was}} Friday got out to the small end of a large branch, and the bear got about half-way <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> As soon as the bear got out to that part where the limb of the tree was weaker, “Ha!” says he to us, “now you see me teachee the bear dance:” so he began jumping and shaking the bough, at which the bear began to totter, but stood still, and began <b>to</b> look behind <b>him,</b> <b>to</b> see how he should get back; then, indeed, we did laugh heartily. But Friday had not done with him by a great deal; when seeing him stand still, he called out <b>to</b> <b>him</b> again, as if he had {{supposed}} the bear could speak English, “What, you come no farther? pray you come farther;” so he left jumping and shaking the tree; and the bear, just as if he understood what he said, did come a little farther; then he began jumping again, and the bear stopped again. We thought now was a good time <b>to</b> knock <b>him</b> in the head, and called to Friday to stand still and we should shoot the bear: but he cried out earnestly, “Oh, pray! Oh, pray! no shoot, me shoot by and then:” he would have said by-and-by. However, to shorten the story, Friday danced so much, and the bear stood so ticklish, that we had laughing enough, but still could not imagine what the fellow would do: for first we thought he depended upon shaking the bear off; and we found the bear was too cunning for that too; for he would not go out far enough to be thrown down, but clung fast with his great broad claws and feet, so that we could not imagine what {{would be the end of}} it, and what the jest would be at last. But Friday put us out of doubt quickly: for seeing the bear cling fast to the bough, and that he would not be persuaded to come any farther, “Well, well,” says Friday, “you no come farther, me go; you no come to me, me come to you;” and upon this he went out to the smaller end, where it would bend with his weight, and gently let himself down by it, sliding down the bough till he came near enough to jump down on his feet, and away he ran to his gun, took it up, and stood still. “Well,” said I <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> “Friday, what will you do now? Why don’t you shoot him?” “No shoot,” says Friday, “no yet; me shoot now, me no kill; me stay, give you one more laugh:” and, indeed, so he did; for when the bear saw his enemy gone, he came back from the bough, where he stood, but did it very cautiously, looking behind him every step, and coming backward till he got into the body of the tree, then, with the same hinder end foremost, he came down the tree, grasping it with his claws, and moving one foot at a time, very leisurely. At this juncture, and just before he could set his hind foot on the ground, Friday <b>stepped</b> up <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> clapped the muzzle of his piece into his ear, and shot him dead. Then the rogue turned about to see if we did not laugh; and when he saw we were pleased by our looks, he began to laugh very loud. “So we kill bear in my country,” says Friday. “So you kill them?” says I; “why, you have no guns.”—“No,” says he, “no gun, but shoot great much long arrow.” This was a good diversion to us; but we were still in a wild place, and our guide very much hurt, and what to do we hardly knew; the howling of wolves ran much in my head; and, indeed, except the noise I once heard on the shore of Africa, of which I have said something already, I never heard anything that filled me with so much horror.|$|R
