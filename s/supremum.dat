5|$|By the {{inequality}} of arithmetic and geometric means, function S'n(θ) is bounded {{from above}} by −ln(n+1), {{and thus the}} maximum has to exist {{at least in the}} <b>supremum</b> sense.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} a real number might have two {{different}} decimal representations is merely {{a reflection of the}} fact that two different sets of real numbers can have the same <b>supremum.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1777, Grand Master Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc {{introduced}} the <b>Supremum</b> Justitiæ Magistratum (Collegiate Tribunal of the Jury's Supreme Magistrate) {{in order to}} establish more separation of powers in judicial decisions. Giandonato Rogadeo, an eminent European jurist, was requested to come to Malta in 1781 by de Rohan to address issues related to common law. Rogadeo went on to author the Diritto Municipale, between the year of his arrival and 1784, a law book to be used for the Castellania. During his stay in Malta, he further observed that it was not the law which was just problematic but also the judges and advocates which were corrupt. His work was opposed by the advocates and judges, with Baron Gaetano Pisani and Judge Gio Nicoló Muscat anonymously publishing works in Rome in 1783 to challenge it and aiming to keep the status quo which had limited considerations. It became the primarily Maltese law of the Code de Rohan, a humane set of laws, which brought significant reformation to criminal law. The Code incorporated previous laws introduced from former Grand Masters with a more liberal approach. It also set standard regulations for advocates, with some flexibility. It was subsequently amended with the use of bandi. The Diritto Municipale was abolished in 1854, during the British period, and replaced by a more lenient Criminal Code.|$|E
25|$|Subsets {{which are}} {{unbounded}} by themselves but bounded {{in the whole}} set; they have no maximum, but a <b>supremum</b> outside the subset; if the subset is non-empty this <b>supremum</b> is a limit point of the subset and hence also of the whole set; if the subset is empty this <b>supremum</b> is the minimum of the whole set.|$|E
25|$|Limit {{inferior}} is {{also called}} infimum limit, liminf, inferior limit, lower limit, or inner limit; limit superior {{is also known}} as <b>supremum</b> limit, limit <b>supremum,</b> limsup, superior limit, upper limit, or outer limit.|$|E
25|$|The supremum/superior/outer {{limit is}} a set that joins these {{accumulation}} sets together. That is, it is the union {{of all of the}} accumulation sets. When ordering by set inclusion, the <b>supremum</b> limit is the least upper bound on the set of accumulation points because it contains each of them. Hence, it is the <b>supremum</b> of the limit points.|$|E
25|$|If a {{sequence}} of real numbers is increasing and bounded above, then its <b>supremum</b> is the limit.|$|E
25|$|The {{ideals of}} a ring, ordered by inclusion. The <b>supremum</b> {{is given by}} the sum of ideals and the infimum by the intersection.|$|E
25|$|So {{the limit}} <b>supremum</b> is {{contained}} in all subsets which are upper bounds for all except finitely many sets of the sequence.|$|E
25|$|Mathematically, the Chebyshev {{distance}} is a metric {{induced by the}} <b>supremum</b> norm or uniform norm. It {{is an example of}} an injective metric.|$|E
25|$|The {{power set}} {{of a given}} set, ordered by inclusion. The <b>supremum</b> is given by the union and the infimum by the {{intersection}} of subsets.|$|E
25|$|A lattice is an {{abstract}} structure {{studied in the}} mathematical subdisciplines of order theory and abstract algebra. It consists of a partially ordered set in which every two elements have a unique <b>supremum</b> (also called a least upper bound or join) and a unique infimum (also called a greatest lower bound or meet). An example is given by the natural numbers, partially ordered by divisibility, for which the unique <b>supremum</b> is the least common multiple and the unique infimum is the greatest common divisor.|$|E
25|$|The {{order is}} Dedekind-complete; that is: every {{non-empty}} subset S of ℝ with an upper bound in ℝ has a {{least upper bound}} (also called <b>supremum)</b> in ℝ.|$|E
25|$|The open sets of a topological space, {{ordered by}} inclusion. The <b>supremum</b> {{is given by}} the union of open sets and the infimum by the {{interior}} of the intersection.|$|E
25|$|The topologies on a set, {{ordered by}} inclusion. The infimum {{is given by}} the {{intersection}} of topologies, and the <b>supremum</b> by the topology generated by the union of topologies.|$|E
25|$|The Stone–Čech {{compactification}} βN {{can be used}} {{to characterize}} ℓ∞(N) (the Banach space of all bounded sequences in the scalar field R or C, with <b>supremum</b> norm) and its dual space.|$|E
25|$|The convex subsets {{of a real}} or complex vector space, {{ordered by}} inclusion. The infimum is given by the {{intersection}} of convex sets and the <b>supremum</b> by the convex hull of the union.|$|E
25|$|A {{partially}} {{ordered set}} (L, ≤) is a complete lattice if every subset A of L has both a greatest lower bound (the infimum, also called the meet) and a least upper bound (the <b>supremum,</b> also called the join) in (L, ≤).|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, a {{complete}} lattice is a {{partially ordered set}} in which all subsets have both a <b>supremum</b> (join) and an infimum (meet). Complete lattices appear in many applications in mathematics and computer science. Being a special instance of lattices, they are studied both in order theory and universal algebra.|$|E
25|$|The {{main focus}} of {{interval}} arithmetic is {{the simplest way to}} calculate upper and lower endpoints for the range of values of a function in one or more variables. These endpoints are not necessarily the <b>supremum</b> or infimum, since the precise calculation of those values can be difficult or impossible.|$|E
25|$|The {{relation}} ≤ {{defined by}} a ≤ b if these equivalent conditions hold, is a partial order with least element 0 and greatest element 1. The meet a ∧ b and the join a ∨ b of two elements coincide with their infimum and <b>supremum,</b> respectively, with respect to ≤.|$|E
25|$|This {{implies the}} extreme value theorem: a {{continuous}} real-valued function on a nonempty compact space is bounded above and attains its <b>supremum.</b> (Slightly more generally, {{this is true}} for an upper semicontinuous function.) As a sort of converse to the above statements, the pre-image of a compact space under a proper map is compact.|$|E
25|$|The numbers A and B {{are called}} the lower and upper frame bounds, respectively. The frame bounds are not unique because numbers less than A and greater than B are also valid frame bounds. The optimal lower bound is the <b>supremum</b> of all lower bounds and the optimal upper bound is the infimum of all upper bounds.|$|E
25|$|The <b>supremum</b> of the {{sequence}} {ω(x,n)} is called the type. Almost all real numbers are S numbers of type 1, which is minimal for real S numbers. Almost all complex numbers are S numbers of type 1/2, which is also minimal. The claims of almost all numbers were conjectured by Mahler and in 1965 proved by Vladimir Sprindzhuk.|$|E
25|$|In {{commutative}} algebra, the Krull {{dimension of}} a commutative ring R, named after Wolfgang Krull, is the <b>supremum</b> of the lengths of all chains of prime ideals. The Krull dimension {{need not be}} finite even for a Noetherian ring. More generally the Krull dimension can be defined for modules over possibly non-commutative rings as the deviation of the poset of submodules.|$|E
25|$|The {{subgroups of}} any given group under inclusion. (While the infimum here is the usual {{set-theoretic}} intersection, the <b>supremum</b> {{of a set of}} subgroups is the subgroup generated by the set-theoretic union of the subgroups, not the set-theoretic union itself.) If e is the identity of G, then the trivial group {e} is the minimum subgroup of G, while the maximum subgroup is the group G itself.|$|E
25|$|Since {{there are}} only countably many notations, all ordinals with notations are {{exhausted}} well below the first uncountable ordinal ω1; their <b>supremum</b> is called Church–Kleene ω1 or ω1CK (not {{to be confused with}} the first uncountable ordinal, ω1), described below. Ordinal numbers below ω1CK are the recursive ordinals (see below). Countable ordinals larger than this may still be defined, but do not have notations.|$|E
25|$|The {{operator}} norm of T is {{the essential}} <b>supremum</b> of h. The essential range of h is defined in the following way: a complex number λ is in the essential range of h if for all ε > 0, the preimage of the open ball Bε(λ) under h has strictly positive measure. We will show first that σ(Th) coincides with the essential range of h and then examine its various parts.|$|E
25|$|In {{mathematical}} analysis, limit {{superior and}} limit inferior are important tools for studying sequences of real numbers. Since the <b>supremum</b> and infimum of an unbounded set of real numbers may not exist (the reals {{are not a}} complete lattice), it is convenient to consider sequences in the affinely extended real number system: we add {{the positive and negative}} infinities to the real line to give the complete totally ordered set , which is a complete lattice.|$|E
25|$|Just as order {{relations}} {{are grounded in}} ordered sets, sets closed under pairwise <b>supremum</b> and infimum, equivalence {{relations are}} grounded in partitioned sets, which are sets closed under bijections and preserve partition structure. Since all such bijections map an equivalence class onto itself, such bijections are also known as permutations. Hence permutation groups (also known as transformation groups) and the related notion of orbit {{shed light on the}} mathematical structure of equivalence relations.|$|E
25|$|In the {{mathematical}} field of real analysis, the monotone convergence theorem is {{any of a}} number of related theorems proving the convergence of monotonic sequences (sequences that are increasing or decreasing) that are also bounded. Informally, the theorems state that if a sequence is increasing and bounded above by a <b>supremum,</b> then the sequence will converge to the supremum; in the same way, if a sequence is decreasing and is bounded below by an infimum, it will converge to the infimum.|$|E
25|$|Various other {{mathematical}} domains use {{the concept}} of continuity in different, but related meanings. For example, in order theory, an order-preserving function f: X → Y between particular types of partially ordered sets X and Y is continuous if for each directed subset A of X, we have sup(f(A)) = f(sup(A)). Here sup is the <b>supremum</b> {{with respect to the}} orderings in X and Y, respectively. This notion of continuity is the same as topological continuity when the partially ordered sets are given the Scott topology.|$|E
25|$|The {{power set}} ℘(X) {{of a set}} X is a {{complete}} lattice that is ordered by set inclusion, and so the <b>supremum</b> and infimum of any set of subsets (in terms of set inclusion) always exist. In particular, every subset Y of X is bounded above by X and below by the empty set ∅ because ∅ ⊆ Y ⊆ X. Hence, it is possible (and sometimes useful) to consider superior and inferior limits of sequences in ℘(X) (i.e., sequences of subsets of X).|$|E
25|$|A {{refinement}} {{of a series}} is another series containing each {{of the terms of}} the original series. Two subnormal series are said to be equivalent or isomorphic if there is a bijection between the sets of their factor groups such that the corresponding factor groups are isomorphic. Refinement gives a partial order on series, up to equivalence, and they form a lattice, while subnormal series and normal series form sublattices. The existence of the <b>supremum</b> of two subnormal series is the Schreier refinement theorem. Of particular interest are maximal series without repetition.|$|E
25|$|Size: For simple hypotheses, {{this is the}} test's {{probability}} of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis. The false positive rate. For composite hypotheses this is the <b>supremum</b> of the {{probability of}} rejecting the null hypothesis over all cases covered by the null hypothesis. The complement of the false positive rate is termed specificity in biostatistics. ("This is a specific test. Because the result is positive, we can confidently say that the patient has the condition.") See sensitivity and specificity and Type I and type II errors for exhaustive definitions.|$|E
25|$|A sup (<b>supremum)</b> of X is a least {{upper bound}} on X, namely an upper bound on X that is less or equal to every upper bound on X. Dually an inf (infimum) of X is a {{greatest}} lower bound on X. The sup of x and y always exists in the underlying poset of a Boolean algebra, being x∨y, and likewise their inf exists, namely x∧y. The empty sup is 0 (the bottom element) and the empty inf is 1 (top). It follows that every finite set has both a sup and an inf. Infinite subsets of a Boolean algebra {{may or may not}} have a sup and/or an inf; in a power set algebra they always do.|$|E
