40|$|A simple {{version of}} the semiclassical theory {{is applied to the}} <b>shot</b> <b>effect.</b> Considerations of thermal noise {{reported}} by Lamb (1965) are extended to take into account amplitude fluctuations. The laser {{is considered to be a}} lossy cavity of the Fabry-Perot type in single-mode operation with a circular frequency driven by an inverted population of active atoms. The electric field is taken to be transverse to the cavity axis. The amplitude and phase are assumed to be slowly varying functions which satisfy two self-consistency equations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Research on {{innovation}} {{design of}} visual 2. 5 D effect black-and-white digital jacquard fabric {{is carried out}} based on layered-combination design mode and design method of full-color compound structure. Black-and-white digital jacquard fabric designed by combining two digital patterns together can express two patterns on face of fabric at same time. As long as lustrous yarns are employed to produce jacquard fabric with full-color compound structure, and juxtaposed colorless yarns cannot be covered by each other, black-and-white digital jacquard fabric could express good grey shading effect. Viewed from different angle, two overlapping patterns will show figured <b>shot</b> <b>effect</b> so-called visual 2. 5 D effect. In this paper, design principle and method of visual 2. 5 D effect black-and-white digital jacquard fabric were introduced clearly with proper design illustrations. It provides good value for design innovation of black-and-white digital jacquard fabric...|$|E
5000|$|The company Effects Associated {{were hired}} by Cohen to supply {{some of the}} special <b>effects</b> <b>shots.</b> When the shots were delivered, Cohen was not {{satisfied}} with shots of exploding factory buildings and paid only half (c. $8,000) of the agreed price for those <b>shots.</b> <b>Effects</b> Associated brought an action against Cohen in court to claim full compensation, {{but also because the}} parties had no written copyright agreement regarding the use of the shots. The trial court decided in favor of Cohen, ruling that there was an [...] "implied agreement" [...] for the non-exclusive use of the shots in the film.
