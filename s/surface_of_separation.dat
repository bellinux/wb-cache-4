40|$|International audienceWe present Contact Dynamics {{discrete}} element {{simulations of}} the earthquake-triggered Jiufengershan avalanche, which mobilized a 60 m thick, 1. 5 km long sedimentary layer, dipping similar to 22 degrees SE toward a valley. The dynamic {{behavior of the}} avalanche is simulated under different assumptions about rock behavior, water table height, and boundary shear strength. Additionally, seismic shaking is introduced using strong motion records from nearby stations. We assume that seismic shaking generates shearing and frictional heating along the surface of rupture, which, in turn, may induce dynamic weakening and avalanche triggering; a simple "slip-weakening'' criterion was adopted to simulate shear strength drop along the rupture surface. We investigate the mechanical processes occurring during triggering and propagation of an avalanche mobilizing shallowly dipping layers. Incipient deformation forms a pop-up structure at the toe of the dip slope. As the avalanche propagates, the pop-up deforms into an overturned fold, which overrides the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> along a decollement. Simultaneously, uphill layers slide at high velocity (125 km/h) and are folded and disrupted as they reach the toe of the dip slope. The avalanche foot forms a wedge that is pushed forward as deformed rocks accrete at its rear. We simulated five cross sections across the Jiufengershan avalanche, which differ in the geometry of the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation.</b> Topographic and simulated surface profiles are similar. The friction coefficient at the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> determined from back analysis is abnormally low (mu(SS) = 0. 2), possibly due to lubrication by liquefied soils.

40|$|International audienceThe {{distinctive}} {{features of the}} loss of stability of elastic solids which undergo phase transitions are investigated for the case of small deformations. The non-uniqueness of the solution of the boundary-value problem for the describing of the thermodynamic equilibrium of a two-phase body is caused by the non-linearity associated with the unknown interface. The solution can be chosen by comparing the potential energies of the body in the two-phase and single phase states and by analysing of the local stability of the two-phase states. A linearized boundary-value problem is formulated which describes infinitesimal small perturbations of an initial two-phase state which is in thermodynamic equilibrium. Analysis of the stability of the two-phase state reduces to an investigation of the bifurcation points and the behaviour of the small solutions of the system of integrodifferential equations in terms of functions describing the perturbations of the interface. The problem of the non-uniqueness and loss of stability of centrisymmetric equilibrium two-phase deformations is investigated as an example. A theorem concerning the number of centrisymmetric solutions is proved. The energy changes accompanying the formation and development of two-phase states and the stability of the solutions obtained are investigated. The concept of topological instability as a bifurcation is introduced, as a result of which the type of geometry of a solution of the boundary-value problem changes and <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> the phases actually appear and disappear. Macrodiagrams of the deformational are constructed which demonstrate the effect of deformation softening in the path of a phase transition...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A layered {{model of}} the lithosphere-asthenosphere system {{consisting}} of an elastic layer over-lying a viscoelastic half space is considered. A long, buried, inclined strike-slip fault is taken to be situated in the medium with a bending at the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation.</b> The mantle convection induced a constant force on the fault resulting in a sudden movement across it. The movement on the fault changes the stress pattern in the nearby region.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{magnetic}} {{field on the}} nonlinear growth rate of Rayleigh-Taylor instability induced two fluid interfacial structures has been investigated. The magnetic field {{is assumed to be}} parallel to the plane of the two fluid interface and acts in a direction perpendicular to the wave vector.

If magnetic field is present {{on both sides of the}} two fluid interface, stabilization may also take place in the sense that the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> undulates periodically when the force due to magnetic pressure on two sides are such as to act in opposite direction.

For water confined between hydrophilic surfaces, measurements and simulations have shown conflicting results ranging from “liquidlike” to “solidlike” behavior, from bulklike water viscosity to viscosity orders of magnitude higher. Here, we investigate how a homogeneous fluid behaves under nanoconfinement using its bulk response function: The Green's function of water extracted from a library of S(q,ω) inelastic x-ray scattering data is used to make femtosecond movies of nanoconfined water. Between two confining surfaces, the structure undergoes drastic changes as a function <b>of</b> <b>surface</b> <b>separation.</b> For <b>surface</b> <b>separations</b> <b>of</b> ≈ 9 Å, although the surface-associated hydration layers are highly deformed, they are separated by a layer of bulklike water. For <b>separations</b> <b>of</b> ≈ 6 Å, the two surface-associated hydration layers are forced to reconstruct into a single layer that modulates between localized “frozen’ and delocalized “melted” structures due to interference of density fields. These results potentially reconcile recent conflicting experiments. Importantly, we find a different delocalized wetting regime for nanoconfined water between surfaces with high spatial frequency charge densities, where water is organized into delocalized hydration layers instead of localized hydration shells, and are strongly resistant to `freezing' down to molecular distances (< 6 Å) ...|$|R

The effects of surface tension at the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> is neglected. There exist two modes of time-harmonic waves - the one with lower wave number propagating along the ice-cover and the one with higher wave number along the interface.

The exciting forces for vertical and horizontal directions are derived and plotted against different values of the wave number for different submersion depths of the sphere and flexural rigidity of the ice-cover. When the flexural rigidity and the density of the ice-cover are taken to be zero, the numerical results for the exciting forces for the problem with free surface are recovered as particular cases.
