In this thesis we present {{the idea of}} manipulating electronic currents mixed over two co-propagating edge channels, and discuss its potential impact for quantum interferometry and transport of spin-qubit states. We introduce the characteristics of edge states and evaluate the effect of local, non adiabatic potentials and their efficiency <b>to</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>charge</b> between two channels. We show that sharp potential variations whose energies are smaller than the Landau gap provide weak mixing, and we identify some experimental strategies that can achieve good mixing percentages.

The hybrid extended Kalman filter is adopted to dynamically estimate the cell SOCs which serve as a balancing criterion. A current sensor is added to detect balancing current for the SOC estimation. Simulations are carried out to compare the proposed approach with terminal voltage approaches and show that the proposed approach has charged more capacity into the pack in charging process...|$|R
