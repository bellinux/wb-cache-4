5000|$|In {{traditional}} {{business accounting}} and common usage, the [...] "bottom line" [...] refers {{to either the}} [...] "profit" [...] or [...] "loss", which is usually recorded {{at the very bottom}} line on a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> and expenses. Over the last 50 years, environmentalists and [...] "social justice" [...] advocates have struggled to bring a broader definition of bottom line into public consciousness by introducing full cost accounting. For example, if a corporation shows a monetary profit, but their asbestos mine causes thousands of deaths from asbestosis, and their copper mine pollutes a river, and the government ends up spending taxpayer money on health care and river clean-up, how do we perform a full societal cost benefit analysis? The triple bottom line adds two more [...] "bottom lines”: social and environmental (ecological) concerns. With the ratification of the United Nations and ICLEI TBL standard for urban and community accounting in early 2007, this became the dominant approach to public sector full cost accounting. Similar UN standards apply to natural capital and human capital measurement to assist in measurements required by TBL, e.g. the EcoBudget standard for reporting ecological footprint. The TBL seems to be fairly widespread in South African media, as found in a 1990-2008 study of worldwide national newspapers.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} public {{accountability}} promotes {{the need for}} a comprehensive set of performance-related information to satisfy the information needs of a diverse stakeholder interest group. However, literature concerned with the scope of information to be disclosed, and in particular {{within the context of a}} developing country, is limited. This paper identifies the information set which stakeholders of Malaysian local authorities consider relevant in the monitoring and assessment of local authority performance. Stakeholders indicated strong interest in performance information that is not traditionally disclosed in the financial statements: non-financial information particularly performance measurement of outputs, outcomes, efficiency and effectiveness. Disclosures in the <b>Statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Revenue</b> and Expenditure and forward-looking information are generally regarded as the most important disclosures. The results of the study also indicate differences amongst stakeholders as to the level of importance that they place on certain items especially items related to internal policies and governance and financial position of the local authorities. The findings will be of significance to policy makers interested in improving the performance reporting of Malaysian public sector entities, particularly local authorities...|$|E
40|$|It is a {{study which}} {{analyses}} various aspects of administrative, financial and social life in Italy in Napoleonic times, when a vast nation State, the ‘Italian Republic’ (1802 - 1805), then transformed into the ‘Kingdom of Italy’ (1805 - 1814), had a surface that covered {{a third of the}} Italian peninsula, with 6, 700, 000 inhabitants and an army of 80, 000 men. Under Napoleon in Italian peninsula a radical transformation of the public order is performed. The Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy offers a vast field of study which the book is dedicated. Based on surveys of powerful archival, as well as scientific literature to date, you will retrace the history of significant profiles of institutions - state and local - considered in their actual functioning. The complex tax and financial dynamics are also the subject of an original investigation. The first part provides a concise profile of political institutions in the Italian Republic (1802 - 1805) and the Kingdom of Italy (1805 - 1814), with the aid of diagrams. It then focuses on the functions and activities of the State Council (Consiglio di Stato) and in particular on a branch of it, the Board of Auditors (Consiglio degli Uditori), for the special responsibility of this central body: financial control of the most important towns. It also explains the genesis and evolution of the department, the largest administrative unit, according to the French model. The second part of this book is devoted to the topic, neglected by historians, of fiscal and financial policy. Budgets of many cities are investigated in connection with the prevailing needs of a rapidly expanding state power. The huge military spending of the Napoleonic regime, in particular, interacts heavily with the daily lives of the subjects of the Italian state, prompting mixed reactions: covert resistance, politics opposition, violent protest, until the insurrection. Specific attention is paid to the true amount of the Napoleonic taxes in comparison with the perceptions of taxpayers. Reality and perception: a gap between the two fields soon appears. In the third part the analysis moves to smaller municipalities as a mirror of a rural setting, yet a substantial majority in the national scene, in the arduous search for the new socio-political balance. In the Appendix the reader finds two unpublished archival sources: the index of all towns in the Kingdom of Italy in 1811; the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> and expenses of the municipalities in 1808, which offers an overview of Italian finances of that time...|$|E

40|$|Financial {{reporting}} frauds {{and earnings}} manipulation have attracted high profile attention recently. There {{have been several}} cases by businesses of {{what appears to be}} financial statement fraud, which have been undetected by the auditors. In this thesis, the main purpose is to identify some of the reasons why auditors have not detected financial statement fraud and to suggest possible solutions for improving the audit process in these areas. In order to achieve this target, some cases of the fraudulent financial <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> recognition will be analysed. The main reasons why auditors did not detect financial statement fraud from the technical side were application of analytical review procedures as “sufficient audit evidence;” weaknesses in audit risk model and risk assessment concerning internal control; and audit failure in revenue recognition and related-party transaction disclosure. The ethical issues that relate to the detection of fraud include auditor independence and the amount of non-audit services provided by the auditor. Several solutions will be recommended to enhance the audit process in detecting the financial statement fraud in accordance with the reasons we have determined...|$|R
