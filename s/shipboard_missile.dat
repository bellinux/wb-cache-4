25|$|Richmond K. Turner {{assumed the}} duty as anti-submarine warfare (ASW) school {{ship in the}} {{southern}} California operating areas. In February, it conducted a SecNav guest cruise, and on 1 March, it commenced an extensive updating of her <b>shipboard</b> <b>missile</b> systems at the Naval Station San Diego. It then underwent training and further preparations for its fourth WestPac deployment, which commenced in January 1970.|$|E
50|$|The missile's folding fins {{allow it}} to be {{launched}} from a 140 mm tube. It can be set to engage the target with height of burst, point detonation or fuze delay. The U.S. Navy has tested the Griffin as a <b>shipboard</b> <b>missile</b> guided by laser at fast-moving small boats; they planned to use it on the Littoral Combat Ships. The missile version is less than half the weight of a Hellfire round and includes a 5.9 kg warhead. It has a range of 15 km when air-launched, or 5.5 km when launched from the surface. It has been fired from the U.S. Army Remote weapon station, multi-round Wedge Launcher, Smart Launcher and Kiowa Warrior manned helicopters.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the end of}} World War II the Navy took {{possession}} of Topsail Island and began {{a joint venture with}} Johns Hopkins University [...] and established the US Naval Ordnance Test Facilities at Topsail Island, North Carolina, for Operation Bumblebee, a top-secret, experimental project to develop and test ramjet missiles, which advanced the Nation's jet aircraft and missile programs. So successful were the tests conducted at the Topsail Island site that the ramjet proved its value, opened the way for the advance of supersonic jet aircraft design and brought the United States to the threshold of modern space technology with the Talos, Terrier, Tartar and Sea Sparrow missiles aboard naval vessels. The name 'Bumblebee' was chosen, possibly due to the misconception that it is aerodynamically unable to fly, but does not know this and flies anyway. This operation led to the maturing of supersonic aircraft and <b>shipboard</b> <b>missile</b> design in the mid-20th century.|$|E
5000|$|On 5 September 1990 {{the ship}} {{departed}} San Diego for the Persian Gulf during Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. She {{was responsible for}} the first reload of <b>shipboard</b> Tomahawk <b>missiles</b> outside the continental U.S. while pierside in Mina Jebel Ali. The reload recipient was the guided missile destroyer [...]|$|R
50|$|Seacat was a British {{short-range}} {{surface-to-air missile}} system intended {{to replace the}} ubiquitous Bofors 40 mm gun aboard warships of all sizes. It was the world's first operational <b>shipboard</b> point-defence <b>missile</b> system and was designed so that the Bofors guns could be replaced with minimum modification to the recipient vessel and (originally) using existing fire-control systems. A mobile land-based version of the system was known as Tigercat.|$|R
50|$|The typical AS-2 launch platform, the Tupolev Tu-16K-10 Badger C, {{could carry}} {{a total of}} two AS-2s, one each on an inboard wing pylon. The Kipper's long range enabled it to be launched, hypothetically, from beyond the range of any <b>shipboard</b> surface-to-air <b>missiles</b> or {{anti-aircraft}} guns of that time. The only defense against the Kipper was the naval jet fighter aircraft, operating from either an aircraft carrier or a shore airfield.|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of Magnetic Suspension and Balance Systems (MSBS) to improve conventional wind tunnel testing techniques is discussed. Topics include: elimination of model geometry distortion and support interference {{to improve the}} measurement accuracy of aerodynamic coefficients; removal of testing restrictions due to supports; improved dynamic stability data; and stores separation testing. Substantial increases in wind tunnel productivity are anticipated due to the coalescence of these improvements. Specific improvements in testing methods for missiles, helicopters, fighter aircraft, twin fuselage transports and bombers, state separation, water tunnels, and automobiles are also forecast. In a more speculative vein, new wind tunnel test techniques are envisioned {{as a result of}} applying MSBS, including free-flight computer trajectories in the test section, pilot-in-the-loop and designer-in-the-loop testing, <b>shipboard</b> <b>missile</b> launch simulation, and optimization of hybrid hypersonic configurations. Also addressed are potential applications of MSBS to such diverse technologies as medical research and practice, industrial robotics, space weaponry, and ore processing in space...|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / November 19 - 21, 1979 / Town and Country Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaThe paper {{presented}} by NSWSES at the 1975 ITC Conference in Washington, DC, described the Portable High Frequency Telemetry System (PUTTS) being assembled for NATO. This system used {{the best of}} the then standard state of the arts commercial components and was used for <b>shipboard</b> <b>missile</b> data receiving/recording and for quick look missile performance evaluation. In 1977 the Naval Sea Systems Command made funds available to update the AN/SKQ- 3 system by utilizing the RF assembly similar to that used in PUTTS. This new RF assembly provided dual antennas for (1) a wide angle for verticle launch and initial acquisition; (2) narrow beam high gain for long range tracking. The RF unit also included frequency scan with automatic lock when a signal was received, and sector search. In 1978 funding was received from Australia and Iran to procure additional PUTTS. These units (PUTTS III) were updated to handle faster intercept rates as well as improved range tracking and adapt the new RF features from the SKQ- 3 Mod. Added to this were the capability to handle both PAM and PCM data with light weight hardware. These systems were completed and the Australian unit system was delivered after acceptance tests with U. S. fleet operation in the Gulf of Mexico. As a result of these successful improvements a new portable system has been built to (1) adapt microprocessors to the set-up of data format; (2) Provide automatic selection remote control of the RF head within the antenna frame; (3) provide the basic data to make automatic processing possible when and if desired; (4) Add the new low noise GASFET preamp to the system to increase the range; (5) Add capability for four receivers in the space presently occupied by the dual receivers to permit the handling of the new missiles with dual RF outputs and (6) provide the capability of system checking of all modules from the antenna through the system to the paper read-out device. This paper now presents the new updated system combining {{the state of the art}} development in programming, remote control, low noise preamps, miniature RF assembly, matrix control programming as well as automatic data set up and selection for data processing...|$|E
50|$|When {{multiple}} {{hits from}} Oerlikon 20 mm cannon and Bofors 40 mm guns {{were unable to}} prevent kamikaze strikes during {{the final year of}} the second world war; the 3"/50 was adapted as a replacement for these weapons. Post-war experimentation with an extended range variant (3"/70 Mark 26 gun) was abandoned as <b>shipboard</b> surface-to-air <b>missiles</b> were developed. The United States Navy considered contemporary 5"/38 caliber guns and 5â€³/54 caliber guns more effective against surface targets.|$|R
