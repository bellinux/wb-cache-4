50|$|The sport {{differential}} operates {{by using}} two superposition ("step up") gears at the differential, which are operated via multi-plate clutches {{each side of}} the differential crown wheel. When required by the software (using lateral and longitudinal yaw sensors, the ABS wheel sensors, and a <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>sensor),</b> the control software (located in a control unit close to the rear differential), actuates the relevant clutch pack. This has the effect of taking the output shaft drive through the step-up gear to the attached wheel, while the other shaft continues to drive its wheel directly (i.e., the clutch pack not actuated). The higher speed output shaft produces increased torque to the wheel, producing a yaw (turning) moment. In normal operation increased torque is delivered to the wheel {{on the outside of the}} turn thereby increasing the vehicles turning moment, in other words, its willingness to turn in the direction pointed by the steering wheel.|$|E

40|$|The project {{presented}} in this report is a master's thesis performed at Scania CV. The main purpose is to develop an algorithm that estimates the offset of the values that the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> angle <b>sensor</b> reports in a truck or tractor, and also to investigate the possibility to estimate the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> angle in real-time. The developed algorithm successfully estimates the offset to an accuracy {{on the order of}} degrees, and the uncertainty of the estimate is ultimately determined by the backlash in the steering system, which may range up to approximately 15 degrees or more depending on service standards. The investigation also shows that two general approaches to estimate the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> angle in real-time can produce unbiased estimates only when the vehicle is cornering at low speeds...|$|R
40|$|A {{stationary}} or temporary offset in {{the steering}} system {{of a vehicle}} can result in functions, relying on the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> angle, performing poorly. Due to {{the wide range of}} different vehicle configurations at Scania CV, all sensors with relevant information regarding vehicle direction are not available on all vehicles. By using a statistical approach, including common sensors installed on the vehicle, a conceptual algorithm calibrating the <b>Steering</b> <b>Wheel</b> Angle <b>Sensor</b> offset in real- time has been developed. The algorithm is simple and relies on the assumption that a vehicle is driving straight ahead most of the time above a certain minimum vehicle speed, thus the most frequent <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> angle is the straight ahead angle. The algorithm is only active above the certain minimum vehicle speed and consists of two moving windows comprising <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> angle samples in which the calculations are performed. The results show that the algorithm is able to detect offsets with a short calibration time. Storage of samples is required but no vehicle specific parameters are needed. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Active front {{steering}} is an emerging steering technology for passenger cars that realizes a mechatronic superposition of an {{angle to the}} hand steering wheel angle that is prescribed by the driver. This contribution describes algorithms, used to ensure – along with others – the overall safety of the system (i. e. preventing hazardous behavior). A kinematic constraint, modelled as a dynamic system, is used to estimate the steering wheel angle. This estimated signal is compared with the measured signal. Using change detection algorithms typical failure patterns of the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>sensor</b> are detected quite easily.

40|$|Collision Avoidance System solves many {{problems}} caused by traffic congestion worldwide and a synergy of new information technologies for simulation, real-time control and communications networks.

Congestion reduces utilization of the transportation infrastructure and increases travel time, air pollution, fuel consumption and most importantly traffic accidents.

40|$|Department of Human Factors EngineeringDriving is {{a commonplace}} but safety {{critical}} daily activity {{for billions of}} people. It {{remains one of the}} leading causes of death worldwide, particularly in younger adults. In the last decades, a wide range of technologies, such as intelligent braking or speed regulating systems, have been integrated into vehicles to improve safetyannually decreasing death rates testify to their success. A recent research focus in this area has been in the development of systems that sense human states or activities during driving. This is valuable because human error remains a key reason underlying many vehicle accidents and incidents. Technologies that can intervene in response to information sensed about a driver may be able to detect, predict and ultimately prevent problems before they progress into accidents, thus avoiding the occurrence of critical situations rather than just mitigating their consequences. Commercial examples of this kind of technology include systems that monitor driver alertness or lane holding and prompt drivers who are sleepy or drifting off-lane. More exploratory research in this area has sought to capture emotional state or stress/workload levels via physiological measurements of Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Electroencephalogram (EEG), or behavioral measurements of eye gaze or face pose. Other research has monitored explicitly user actions, such as head pose or foot movements to infer intended actions (such as overtaking or lane change) and provide automatic assessments of the safety of these future behaviors – for example, providing a timely warning to a driver who is planning to overtake about a vehicle in his or her blind spot. Researchers have also explored how sensing hands on the wheel can be used to infer a driver’s presence, identity or emotional state. This thesis extends this body of work through the design, development and evaluation of a <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>sensor</b> platform that can directly detect a driver’s hand pose all around a steering wheel. This thesis argues that full steering hand pose is a potentially rich source of information about a driver’s intended actions. For example, it proposes a link between hand posture on the wheel and subsequent turning or lane change behavior. To explore this idea, this thesis describes the construction of a touch sensor {{in the form of a}} steering wheel cover. This cover integrates 32 equidistantly spread touch sensing electrodes (11. 250 inter-sensor spacing) in the form of conductive ribbons (0. 2 " wide and 0. 03 " thick). Data from each ribbons is captured separately via a set of capacitive touch sensor microcontrollers every 64 ms. We connected this hardware platform to an OpenDS, an open source driving simulator and ran two studies capturing hand pose during a sequential lane change task and a slalom task. We analyzed the data to determine whether hand pose is a useful predictor of future turning behavior. For this we classified a 5 -lane road into 4 turn sizes and used machine-learning recognizers to predict the future turn size from the change in hand posture in terms of hand movement properties from the early driving data. Driving task scenario of the first experiment was not appropriately matched with the real life turning task therefore we modified the scenario with more appropriate task in the second experiments. Class-wise prediction of the turn sizes for both experiments didn’t show good accuracy, however prediction accuracy was improved when the classes were reduced into two classes from four classes. In the experiment 2 turn sizes were overlapped between themselves, which made it very difficult to distinguish them. Therefore, we did continuous prediction as well and the prediction accuracy was better than the class-wise prediction system for the both experiments. In summary, this thesis designed, developed and evaluated a combined hardware and software system that senses the steering behavior of a driver by capturing grip pose. We assessed the value of this information via two studies that explored the relationship between wheel grip and future turning behaviors. The ultimate outcome of this study can inform the development of in car sensing systems to support safer driving. clos...|$|E

Since the position of these objects is a-priori not known, we suggest to share their estimated location among the vehicles using vehicle-to-vehicle communication and, in this way, improve their over-all position accuracy over time. In this way, vehicles entering a GNSS-denied area are able to maintain their position accuracy, achieving even better results as if GNSS was available in the areaof interest...|$|R

50|$|The first {{generation}} 4Matic system was originally a complex electronically controlled system with automatically engaging four-wheel drive (4WD), the system employs locking central and rear differentials {{to provide additional}} traction in slippery conditions. The centre differential, {{also known as the}} transfer case, contains two clutches. Each hydraulically enabled clutch is controlled separately to allow for three modes of operation: 2WD (mode 0) where 100% of available torque is available to the rear axle while the front axle is disconnected, and two 4WD modes which allow for 35/65 front/rear axle torque split (mode 1) or 50/50 front/rear axle torque split (mode 2). The rear differential lock, previously known as ASD on Mercedes-Benz models, can also be locked (mode 3) if rear wheel slip is still present when the transfer case 50/50 4WD mode 2 is engaged. Due to safety and stability concerns there is no front differential lock. The 4Matic system uses inputs from the three channel ABS system and a <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> angle <b>sensor</b> to decide when to intervene. 4WD is disengaged automatically if the ABS service brakes are applied. Engine throttle control is not inherent in the W124 system. Two W124 variants of the 4Matic system were produced: the first system (1986-1991) used a mechanical pressure test lever to disable the system hydraulically while the second system variant (1992/1993) used an electrical test switch to break power to the system. The later system variant when in test mode allows for continued operation of the rear shock self-levelling system (SLS) when installed.
