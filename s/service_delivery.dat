5|$|After Khan's {{departure}} from Comilla, the cooperative's model failed in independent Bangladesh because {{only a few}} occupational groups managed to achieve the desired success. By 1979, only 61 of the 400 cooperatives were functioning. The model actually fell prey to the ineffective internal and external controls, stagnation, and diversion of funds. This prompted the subsequent scholars and practitioners in microfinance, such as Muhammad Yunus of Grameen Bank and Fazle Hasan Abed of BRAC, to abandon the cooperative approach in favour of more centralised control and <b>service</b> <b>delivery</b> structures. The new strategy targeted the poorest villagers, while excluding the 'less poor'. However, Khan's leadership skills {{during the course of}} his association with the project remained a source of inspiration for these leaders, as well as other participatory development initiatives in the country.|$|E

In this study, an efficient and flexible solution based on Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) has been proposed to sending services to WebPhone by using Session Initial Protocol (SIP). A framework for service push is introduced by using Widget to implement web services composition and interaction.

In addition national government has introduced strategies to substantially fast-track water <b>services</b> <b>delivery</b> to the poor. To expedite the reduction of water services backlogs, {{there is a need}} for alternative municipal <b>services</b> <b>delivery</b> models. Despite government policies for civil society participation in developmental strategies, municipalities are reticent to enter into <b>services</b> <b>delivery</b> partnerships with civil society organisations. Sufficient theoretical and practical evidence exists to support the notion of municipal community partnerships. The study demonstrates the potential role of civil society organizations in water services partnerships with municipalities to eliminate services backlogs, thus improving social capital between municipalities and communities. This is a qualitative research study of the Tshiungani II village community management of the local water scheme in partnership with the Mutale Local Municipality. It demonstrates effective services management by the village water committee over time, and the resultant good will that emanates from such a municipal-community partnership. This model lends itself to replication in similar rural settings throughout the country, and could contribute substantially towards expediting water <b>services</b> <b>delivery</b> to rural communities...|$|R
