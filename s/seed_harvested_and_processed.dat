40|$|People {{living in}} {{semi-arid}} {{regions of the}} developing, tropical world who are reliant on annual crops and/or pastures (for livestock) for food are particularly vulnerable to hunger and periodic famine. A number of species of edible-seeded Australian acacias thrive under adverse conditions; conditions under which annual plants barely survive. These include A. colei, A. coriacea sens. lat. (including A. sericophylla), A. elachantha, A. torulosa, A. tumida and A. victoriae. The seeds of these species are tasty, safe to consume as a moderate component of human diets and nutritious, being high in protein, carbohydrates and fats. In many regions, such as semi-arid tropical west Africa, the seeds ripen {{at a time of}} low labour demand when non-irrigated crops are not being cultivated. Being perennial and thus having an established root system, mature acacias can take advantage of rains that would be ineffective for annual crops (e. g. out of season or poorly distributed rains). Acacia <b>seeds</b> are easily <b>harvested</b> <b>and</b> <b>processed</b> into flour using simple, existing local technologies. The flour can be incorporated into local dishes and in 'non traditional' foods such as spaghetti, bread and biscuits. The seed also has great potential as feed for livestock. Being hard-coated, seeds can be stored for many years as a reserve for famine. Acacias can also supply various other products, especially fuelwood, and services such as improvement of soil fertility through fixation of atmospheric nitrogen. This paper reviews current knowledge and trials and the use of edible acacias in Africa and India. Certain Australian species have a vast potential as new food crops, worthy of larger scale promotion, particularly in semi-arid regions of the world...|$|R
40|$|The {{use of a}} 3 D {{perfusion}} culture {{environment for}} stem cell expansion {{has been shown to}} be beneficial for maintenance of the original cell functionality but due to several system inherent characteristics such as the presence of extracellular matrix, the continued development and implementation of 3 D perfusion bioreactor technologies is hampered. Therefore, this study developed a methodology for harvesting a progenitor cell population from a 3 D open porous culture surface after expansion in a perfusion bioreactor and performed a functional characterization of the expanded cells. An initial screening showed collagenase to be the most interesting reagent to release the cells from the 3 D culture surface as it resulted in high yields without compromising cell viability. Subsequently a Design of Experiment approach was used to obtain optimized 3 D harvest conditions by assessing the interplay of flow rate, collagenase concentration and incubation time on the <b>harvest</b> efficiency, viability <b>and</b> single cell fraction. Cells that were recovered with the optimized harvest protocol, by perfusing a 880 U/ml collagenase solution for 7 hours at a flow rate of 4 ml/min, were thereafter functionally analyzed for their characteristics as expanded progenitor cell population. As both the in vitro tri-lineage differentiation capacity and the in vivo bone forming potential were maintained after 3 D perfusion bioreactor expansion we concluded that the developed <b>seeding,</b> culture <b>and</b> <b>harvest</b> <b>processes</b> did not significantly compromise the viability and potency of the cells and can contribute to the future development of integrated bioprocesses for stem cell expansion. status: publishe...|$|R

5000|$|The first {{commercial}} {{process by which}} opiates are extracted from poppy straw was invented in Hungary by János Kabay. [...] This process, known as the [...] "poppy straw method", remains in use today. Kabay applied his new process initially to fields of opium poppies between the stages of flowering and maturity, while the fruits were green. This had several disadvantages: the immature poppy seeds could not be winnowed, so {{not only was the}} seed crop lost but their poppyseed oil interfered with the process; the abundant chlorophyll in the green plants also interfered; and an entire year's crop had to be processed in two months, as it reached the fruit stage. Kabay soon found that the process could be applied to poppy straw residue from the poppy <b>seed</b> <b>harvest,</b> <b>and</b> thereby eliminate all these disadvantages.|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} light, temperature, physiologic stage at <b>harvest</b> <b>and</b> length {{of time on the}} germination of Hyptis marrubioides seeds. Two trials were conducted. The first experiment was performed immediately after the <b>seed</b> <b>harvest</b> <b>and</b> consisted of a 2 x 3 x 3 factorial design with 2 environmental conditions (light and dark), 3 temperatures (20, 30 and 20 / 30 ºC) <b>and</b> 3 <b>seed</b> <b>harvest</b> times (green colored seeds, light brown seeds and dark brown seeds). The second experiment was conducted in the presence of light at a temperature of 30 ºC and consisted of a 4 x 3 factorial design, with 4 storage times (0, 6, 12 and 18 months) and the 3 three harvest physiologic stages used in the previous experiment. Both of the experiments were conducted in randomized blocks, with 4 replications of 100 seeds. Light did not affect germination. By contrast, a temperature of 20 ºC retarded the germination process, although the percentage of germinating seeds was not affected. Seed storage <b>and</b> the different <b>harvest</b> physiologic stages affected the Germination Velocity Index (IVG) and the germination percentage. <b>Seeds</b> that were <b>harvested</b> at the more mature stage (dark brown color) could be stored for up to 18 months...|$|R

40|$|Forest {{degradation}} in {{protected areas}} has been monitored {{around the world}} with remote sensing data, but degradation processes undetectable by widely used satellite sensors have been largely overlooked. Increased human pressures and socioeconomic development make forest protection more challenging, particularly for forest ecosystems that lie across national borders because of the differences in national socioeconomic policies and conditions within them. Here with Landsat data, Google Earth images, and field observations, we show that, in two adjacent biosphere reserves across the border of China and North Korea, over one half of primary forest landscapes have been deteriorated by exploitive uses, including <b>seed</b> <b>harvesting</b> <b>and</b> systematic logging. The combined effects of detectable <b>and</b> hidden degradation <b>processes</b> have further damaged forest ecosystems in the core areas in the two biosphere reserves, threatening sustainable biodiversity conservation in the region. It is urgent to develop cross-border collaborative conservation strategies that can help combat both detectable <b>and</b> hidden degradation <b>processes</b> at a regional scale.
