40|$|High-speed digital to {{analogue}} converters (DAC), {{which are}} optimised for large bandwidth signal synthesis applications, are a fundamental building block and enabling technology in industrial instrumentation, military, communication and medical applications. The spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) {{is a key}} specification of high-speed DACs, as unwanted spurious signals generated by the DAC degrades the performance and effectiveness of wideband systems. The focus of this work is to enhance the SFDR performance of high-speed DACs. As bandwidth requirements increase, meeting the desired SFDR performance is further complicated by the increase in dynamic non-linearity. The most widely used architecture in high-speed applications is the current-steering DAC fabricated on CMOS technology. The current source finite output impedance, switch distortion and clock feedthrough are the greatest contributors to dynamic non-linearity and are difficult to improve {{with the use of}} MOS devices alone. This research proposes the use of BiCMOS technology that offers high performance, using heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBT) that, when combined with MOS devices, are able to improve on the linearity of the current-steering DAC and hence improve the SFDR. A design methodology is introduced based on BiCMOS fabrication technology to improve SFDR performance and places emphasis on the constraints of modern fabrication processes. A six-bit current-steering application-specific integrated circuit DAC is designed based on the proposed design methodology, which optimises the SFDR performance of high-speed binary weighted architectures by lowering current switch distortion and reducing the clock feedthrough effect to verify the hypothesis experimentally. A novel current source cell is implemented that comprises HBT current switches, negative channel metal-oxide semiconductor (NMOS) cascode and NMOS current source to overcome distortion by specifically enhancing the SFDR for high-speed DACs. A switch driver and low-voltage differential <b>signalling</b> <b>receiver</b> to achieve high-speed DAC performance and their influence on the SFDR performance are designed and discussed. The DAC is implemented using the International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) 8 HP silicon germanium (SiGe) BiCMOS 130 nm technology. The DAC achieves a better than 21. 96 dBc SFDR across the Nyquist band for a sampling rate of 500 MS/s with a core size of 0. 1 mm 2 and dissipates just 4 mW compared to other BiCMOS DACs that achieve similar SFDR performance with higher output voltages, resulting in much larger power dissipation.

40|$|Aggressive mimics are predatory {{species that}} {{resemble}} a 2 ̆ 7 model 2 ̆ 7 species {{to gain access}} to food, mating opportunities or transportation at the expense of a <b>signal</b> <b>receiver.</b> Costs to the model may be variable, depending on the strength of the interaction between mimics and <b>signal</b> <b>receivers.</b> In the Indopacific, the bluestriped fangblenny Plagiotremus rhinorhynchos mimics juvenile cleaner wrasse Labroides dimidiatus. Instead of removing ectoparasites from larger coral reef fish, fangblennies attack fish to feed on scales and body tissue. In this study, juvenile cleaner wrasse suffered significant costs when associated with P. rhinorhynchos mimics in terms of reduced cleaning activity. Furthermore, the costs incurred by themodel increased with heightened aggression by mimics towards <b>signal</b> <b>receivers.</b> This was apparently because of behavioural changes in <b>signal</b> <b>receivers,</b> as cleaning stations with mimics that attacked frequently were visited less. Variation in the costs incurred by the model may influence mimicry accuracy and avoidance learning by the <b>signal</b> <b>receiver</b> and thus affect the overall success and maintenance of the mimicry system...|$|R

40|$|Mimetic {{species have}} evolved to {{resemble}} other species to avoid predation (protective mimicry) or gain access to food (aggressive mimicry). Mimicry systems are frequently tripartite interactions involving a mimic, model and ‘signal receiver’. Changes in {{the strength of the}} relationship between model and <b>signal</b> <b>receiver,</b> owing to shifting environmental conditions, for example, can affect the success of mimics in protective mimicry systems. Here, we show that an experimentally induced shift in the strength of the relationship between a model (bluestreak cleaner fish, Labroides dimidiatus) and a <b>signal</b> <b>receiver</b> (staghorn damselfish, Amblyglyphidodon curacao) resulted in increased foraging success for an aggressive mimic (bluestriped fangblenny, Plagiotremus rhinorhynchos). When the parasite loads of staghorn damselfish clients were experimentally increased, the attack success of bluestriped fangblenny on damselfish also increased. Enhanced mimic success appeared to be due to relaxation of vigilance by parasitized clients, which sought cleaners more eagerly and had lower overall aggression levels. <b>Signal</b> <b>receivers</b> may therefore be more tolerant of and/or more vulnerable to attacks from aggressive mimics when the net benefit of interacting with their models is high. Changes in environmental conditions that cause shifts in the net benefits accrued by models and <b>signal</b> <b>receivers</b> may have important implications for the persistence of aggressive mimicry systems...|$|R
40|$|Batesian and {{aggressive}} mimics {{are considered to}} be under selective pressure to resemble their models, whereas <b>signal</b> <b>receivers</b> are under selection to discriminate between mimics and models. However, the perceptual ability of <b>signal</b> <b>receivers</b> to discriminate between mimics and models is rarely studied. Here we examined 15 model [...] mimic coral reef fish pairs using nonsubjective methods to judge the accuracy of mimics in terms of color and luminance. We then investigated the potential ability of fish with various visual systems to discriminate between model and mimic colors using theoretical vision models. We found the majority of mimics closely resembled models in terms of color and luminance from a nonsubjective perspective. However, fish that have potentially trichromatic (3 distinct cone photoreceptors) visual systems with ultraviolet sensitivity had a much better capacity to discriminate between models and mimics compared with fish with midrange sensitivity or dichromatic (2 cone photoreceptors) fish. The spectral reflectance of color patches reflected by models and mimics became more similar with an increase in depth, indicating that <b>signal</b> <b>receivers</b> {{may be more likely to}} distinguish mimics from models in habitats located closer to the surface. There was no such change in luminance contrast with depth. The selection pressure on mimics to accurately resemble their model is therefore predicted to vary depending on the visual system of the <b>signal</b> <b>receiver</b> and the light environment.

40|$|The genes coding for the {{response}} regulators ARR 1 and ARR 2 have previously been identi®ed by in silico screening of an expression sequence tag database and subsequent cloning from both Arabidopsis cDNA and genomic libraries. Their structures, {{in which the}} N-terminal <b>signal</b> <b>receiver</b> domain {{is followed by the}} output domain, are characteristic of typical bacterial response regulators of the two-component regulatory systems that control responses to a variety of environmental stimuli. Here we present evidence that these response regulators actually work as transcription factors. ARR 1 and ARR 2 were localized in the nuclei of plant cells regardless of {{the presence or absence of}} their <b>signal</b> <b>receiver</b> domain. Their middle segments, which faintly resemble the mammalian oncogene product Myb, were capable of binding double-stranded DNA in a sequence-speci®c manner in vitro. Their C-terminal halves functioned as transactivation domains in plant cells when combined with the DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL 4. They thus possess all the essential components of a transcriptional activator. Both ARR 1 and ARR 2 promoted expression of a reporter gene in plant cells through their own target sequence. Truncation of their N-terminal <b>signal</b> <b>receiver</b> domain led to an increase in transactivation.

40|$|Male {{signaling}} influences both female {{choice and}} male-male competition. Although male signaling characteristics and female preferences {{have been shown}} to coevolve in many species, few studies have examined whether male signal characteristics and male receiver responses related to male-male competition also coevolve. The present study tested the hypothesis that male and female <b>signal</b> <b>receiver</b> preferences may coevolve in parallel for frogs in the genus Babina by comparing the acoustic structure of male advertisement calls of four closely related and geographically isolated Babina species. Then we assessed the behavioral responses of both male and female B. daunchina (Emei music frog) to male call playbacks from each of the four species. The results support the hypothesis that male and female <b>signal</b> <b>receiver</b> preferences have coevolved in this species. Specifically, both male and female B. daunchina respond strongly to the heterospecific calls of B. hainanensis, suggesting that preexisting biases exist in both females and males. Both male and female individuals showed a slight response to the calls of B. adenopleura while no response was evoked by the calls of B. lini. The manifestation of similar response profiles in male and female B. daunchina to the calls of the four species support the idea that male and female <b>signal</b> <b>receiver</b> preferences evolved in parallel and that the origin of these receiver biases reflects adaptations dependent on the same neural and cognitive systems in both sexes...|$|R

5|$|Batesian mimicry {{is a case}} of {{protective}} or defensive mimicry, where the mimic does best by avoiding confrontations with the <b>signal</b> <b>receiver.</b> It is a disjunct system, which means that all three parties are from different species. Batesian mimicry stands in contrast to other forms such as aggressive mimicry, where the mimic profits from interactions with the <b>signal</b> <b>receiver.</b> One such case of this is in fireflies, where females of one species mimic the mating signals of another species, deceiving males to come close enough for them to eat. Mimicry need not involve a predator at all though. Such is the case in dispersal mimicry, where the mimic once again benefits from the encounter. For instance, some fungi have their spores dispersed by insects by smelling like carrion. In protective mimicry, the meeting between mimic and dupe is not such a fortuitous occasion for the mimic, and the signals it mimics tend to lower the probability of such an encounter.|$|R

Nevertheless, we argue in this paper that existing approaches introduce undesirable trade-offs.

Message-passing protocols, such as FTSP, introduce different sets of compromises and constraints. In this paper, we present an inexpensive and ultra-low power (< 100 µA) mote peripheral, we term the Universal Time <b>Signal</b> <b>Receiver,</b> that leverages the availability of time signals transmitted by dedicated radio stations around the globe {{to provide access to}} UTC time with millisecond-level accuracy. We present experimental results measuring signal availability, quality of synchronization across motes, and power consumption.
