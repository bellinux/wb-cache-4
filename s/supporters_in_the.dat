5|$|The upper tier is {{contoured}} {{to leave}} open {{space in the}} corners of the ground, and the roof is significantly canted inwards. Both of these features are meant to provide as much airflow and sunlight to the pitch as possible. The stadium gives an illusion that <b>supporters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper tier {{on one side of the}} ground are unable to see <b>supporters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper tier opposite. As part of a deal with Sony, the stadium was the first in the world to incorporate HDTV streaming. In the north-west and south-east corners of the stadium are two giant screens suspended from the roof.|$|E
5|$|A 1997 {{match against}} Coleraine was {{abandoned}} when Linfield fans hurled bottles onto the pitch after two Linfield players were sent off. In May 2005 there were disturbances in Dublin at the Setanta Cup final between Linfield and Shelbourne. In the same month, Linfield fans were banned from travelling to the Oval for a match against Glentoran, allegedly {{as a result}} of disturbances involving both sets of fans the previous month. However, Glentoran denied this was the reason behind the ban, citing health and safety regulations that forced them to close the away stand. In 2008, three Linfield fans were charged in a Dublin court with public order offences at a Setanta Cup match against St Patrick's Athletic, but were released. In November of the same year, Linfield player Conor Hagan was struck by a rocket that was fired from Cliftonville <b>supporters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crowd following Linfield's 2–1 defeat, and the following month riot police were called into Glentoran <b>supporters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Boxing Day match after Linfield had taken a 2–0 lead.|$|E

Monmouth was a Protestant and had toured the South West of England in 1680, {{where he had been}} greeted amicably by crowds in towns such as Chard and Taunton. So long as Charles II remained on the throne, Monmouth was content to live a life of pleasure in Holland, while still hoping to accede peaceably to the throne. The accession of James II and coronation at Westminster Abbey on 23 April 1685 put an end to these hopes.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the Old Court – New Court controversy, Kentucky's {{politicians}} became divided between the Democrats and the National Republicans. Crittenden's alliance with Henry Clay and his own personal political views put him squarely in the National Republican Party. Because of Crittenden's support of his presidential bid, President Adams appointed him United States district attorney for the district of Kentucky in 1827. In 1828, Adams nominated him to replace Kentuckian Robert Trimble as an associate justice of the Supreme Court, but Jackson <b>supporters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Senate refused to confirm him. When Jackson defeated Adams in the 1828 presidential election, he removed Crittenden from his post as district attorney because of his association with Clay and his opposition to Jackson's financial policies.|$|E
