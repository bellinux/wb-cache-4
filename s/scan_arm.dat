40|$|Background: Surveillance is a {{standard}} management approach for stage 1 non seminomatous germ cell tumours (NSGCT), {{yet there is no}} agreement on the number of CT scans that are required to detect relapses. A randomised trial of 2 versus 5 CT scans was performed to determine whether the number of scans influenced the prognostic group (J Clin Oncol 15 : 594 - 603, 1997) at relapse. Methods: Patients with clinical stage 1 NSGCT opting for surveillance were randomised to chest and abdominal CT scans at either 3 and 12 or 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months, with all other investigations (clinical exams, markers, chest X-rays) carried out at equal frequency in the two arms. 3 / 5 patients were allocated to the 2 scan schedule. 400 patients were required to exclude a 3 % increase in the proportion of patients relapsing with IGCCCG intermediate or poor prognosis disease with 90 % power at the 5 % significance level (1 -sided). Results: 247 patients were allocated to 2 CT scans and 167 to 5 CT scans. With a median follow up of 40 months 37 (15 %) relapses have occurred in the 2 <b>scan</b> <b>arm</b> and 33 (20 %) in the 5 <b>scan</b> <b>arm.</b> No patients were poor prognosis at relapse but 2 (0. 8 %) of those relapsing in the 2 <b>scan</b> <b>arm</b> were intermediate prognosis compared to 1 (0. 6 %) in the 5 <b>scan</b> <b>arm</b> a difference of 0. 2 % (90 % CI - 1. 2 %, + 1. 6 %). The mean diameter of abdominal mass at relapse was 2. 1 cm in the two <b>scan</b> <b>arm</b> and 2. 2 cm in the five <b>scan</b> <b>arm.</b> After chemotherapy a residual mass was present in 35 % in the 2 scan and 36 % in the 5 <b>scan</b> <b>arm.</b> No deaths have been reported. Conclusions: This study can exclude with 95 % probability an increase in the proportion of patients relapsing with intermediate or poor prognosis disease of more than 1. 6 % if they have 2 rather than 5 CT scans as part of their surveillance protocol. CT scans at 3 and 12 months after orchidectomy should be considered as the new standard and will be associated with a reduction in radiation exposure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{times of}} global change biomass {{calculations}} and the carbon cycle is gaining in importance. Forests act as carbon sinks and hence, {{play a crucial}} role in worlds and forests carbon budgets. Unfortunately, growth models and biomass calculations existing so far mainly concentrate on the aboveground part of trees. For this reason, the aim of the present study is to develop an annually resolved 3 D growth model for tree roots, which allows for reliable biomass calculations and can later be combined with above-ground models. A FARO <b>scan</b> <b>arm</b> was used to measure the surface of a tree-root segment. In addition, ring-width measurements were performed manually on sampled cross sections using Win-DENDRO.

40|$|The December 2010 {{version of}} the guide, ORNL/TM- 2008 / 159, by Jeff Bunn, Josh Schmidlin, Camden Hubbard, and Paris Cornwell, has been further revised due to {{a major change in}} the GeoMagic Studio {{software}} for constructing a surface model. The Studio software update also includes a plug-in module to operate the FARO <b>Scan</b> <b>Arm.</b> Other revisions for clarity were also made. The purpose of this revision document is to guide the reader through the process of laser alignment used by NRSF 2 at HFIR and VULCAN at SNS. This system was created to increase the spatial accuracy of the measurement points in a sample, reduce the use of neutron time used for alignment, improve experiment planning, and reduce operator error. The need for spatial resolution has been driven by the reduction in gauge volumes to the sub-millimeter level, steep strain gradients in some samples, and requests to mount multiple samples within a few days for relating data from each sample to a common sample coordinate system. The first step in this process involves mounting the sample on an indexer table in a laboratory set up for offline sample mounting and alignment in the same manner it would be mounted at either instrument. In the shared laboratory, a FARO ScanArm is used to measure the coordinates of points on the sample surface ('point cloud'), specific features and fiducial points. A Sample Coordinate System (SCS) needs to be established first. This is an advantage of the technique because the SCS can be defined in such a way to facilitate simple definition of measurement points within the sample. Next, samples are typically mounted to a frame of 80 / 20 and fiducial points are attached to the sample or frame then measured in the established sample coordinate system. The laser scan probe on the ScanArm can then be used to scan in an 'as-is' model of the sample as well as mounting hardware. GeoMagic Studio 12 is the software package used to construct the model from the point cloud the <b>scan</b> <b>arm</b> creates. Once a model, fiducial, and measurement files are created, a special program, called SScanSS combines the information and by simulation of the sample on the diffractometer can help plan the experiment before using neutron time. Finally, the sample is mounted on the relevant stress measurement instrument and the fiducial points are measured again. In the HFIR beam room, a laser tracker is used in conjunction with a program called CAM 2 to measure the fiducial points in the NRSF 2 instrument's sample positioner coordinate system. SScanSS is then used again to perform a coordinate system transformation of the measurement file locations to the sample positioner coordinate system. A procedure file is then written with the coordinates in the sample positioner coordinate system for the desired measurement locations. This file is often called a script or command file and can be further modified using excel. It is very important to note that this process is not a linear one, but rather, it often is iterative. Many of the steps in this guide are interdependent on one another. It is very important to discuss the process as it pertains to the specific sample being measured. What works with one sample may not necessarily work for another. This guide attempts to provide a typical work flow that has been successful in most cases...|$|E

The selection of the operating frequencies at each deployed site is predominantly determined by atmospheric attenuation at the site.

40|$|A {{white light}} {{interferometer}} {{is designed to}} measure the distributed polarization coupling (DPC) in polarization-maintaining fiber (PMF). By using a Michelson interferometer to compensate the optical path difference induced by the modal birefringence of PMF, both the coupling strength and position of the coupling point can be acquired. The two reflective mirrors on the fixed and <b>scanning</b> <b>arms</b> should be vertical to each other. But in practice, the movable reflective mirror can’t be vertically aligned exactly to the fixed mirror, which {{would lead to a}}ngle misalignment. The angle misalignment would induce the variance of the optical path difference (OPD), which would reduce the fringe visibility. Finally, the angle error would lead to a decrease on the signal noise ratio (SNR) and miscalculation of the polarization coupling intensity. The angle misalignment and diameter of the incident light beam both {{have an effect on the}} fringe visibility. The simulation results show that the requirement of angle error becomes stricter with the increasing of the light beam diameter. To decrease the angle misalignment, the two plane reflective mirrors should be replaced with the corner cube prisms.

The force necessary to grip small diameter objects is being applied by some of the smallest muscles in the human body.

40|$|The {{study of}} archaeological {{artifacts}} requires a great {{care for the}} object. Current technologies allow {{the study of the}} object scanned in three dimensions. Hence, the digitization of objects has almost become compulsory for simplicity of study and analysis. For each scale of objects, dedicated hardware equipments exist oftentimes at important costs. Among others, <b>scanning</b> <b>arms,</b> handheld scanners, triangulation scanners, terrestrial laser scanners offer a wide variety of possibilities to produce 3 D data. However, the question of cost is central in the field of archaeological research. That is probably why the technology is not widely spread in the community.

Hence a low cost solution susceptible of being operated with reasonable effort could contribute to popularize 3 D acquisition tools.

We hypothesized that an early positron emission tomography (PET) scan {{could be used to}} adapt treatment. Therefore, we started the randomized EORTC/LYSA/FIL Intergroup H 10 trial evaluating whether involved-node radiotherapy (IN-RT) could be omitted without compromising progression-free survival in patients attaining a negative early PET scan after two cycles of ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) as compared with standard combined-modality treatment. Patients and Methods Patients age 15 to 70 years with untreated clinical stage I/II HL were eligible. Here we report the clinical outcome of the preplanned interim futility analysis scheduled to occur after documentation of 34 events in the early PET-negative group. Because testing for futility in this noninferiority trial corresponds to testing the hypothesis of no difference, a one-sided superiority test was conducted. Results The analysis included 1, 137 patients. In the favorable subgroup, 85. 8 % had a negative early PET <b>scan</b> (standard <b>arm,</b> one event v experimental arm, nine events).

However, the cumulative functional patency and durability of transposed AV fistulas (TAVF) compared with nontransposed AV fistulas (AVF) and prosthetic bridging grafts (AVG) remains ill-defined. MethodsFrom January 1998 to December 2002, 245 dialysis access procedures were performed at University Hospital and the Veteran Affairs Medical Center in New Jersey. Follow-up data were available for 125 procedures (TAVF, n = 42; AVF, n = 30; AVG, n = 53) performed in 97 patients. All access procedures were planned {{on the basis of}} preoperative duplex <b>scans</b> of <b>arm</b> and forearm veins. Functional patency was defined as ability to cannulate and hemodialyze patients successfully. Primary and secondary cumulative functional patency of TAVFs, AVFs, and AVGs was determined with life table analysis, and differences were analyzed with the log-rank test. Differences in revision rates, including thrombolysis, thrombectomies, and operative revisions, were determined with the Fisher exact t test. ResultsMean follow-up was 18 months (range, 4 - 24 months). For TAVFs, AVFs, and AVGs, primary functional patency rate at 1 year was 76. 2 %, 53. 3 %, and 47. 2 %, respectively, and at 2 years was 67. 7 %, 34. 4 %, and 25. 5 %, respectively. Similarly, secondary functional patency rate at 1 year was 83. 2 %, 66. 7 %, and 58. 5 %, respectively, and at 2 years was 74. 6 %, 56. 2 %, and 40. 2 %, respectively. Primary and secondary functional patency rates for TAVFs were superior to those for AVGs at 1 and 2 years (P <. 001). AVFs had superior secondary functional patency rate at 2 years, compared with AVGs (P <. 05), and TAVFs had superior primary and secondary patency rates at 2 years, compared with AVFs (P <. 05). AVGs required significantly more revisions than did TAVFs (28. 5 % vs 54. 7 %; P <. 001) or AVFs (36. 7 % vs 54. 7 %; P <. 05). ConclusionsPreoperative duplex <b>scanning</b> of upper <b>arm</b> and forearm veins facilitated successful creation of all types of autogenous fistulas at our institution.
