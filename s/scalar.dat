5|$|A {{vector space}} (also called a linear space) is a {{collection}} of objects called vectors, which may be added together and multiplied ("scaled") by numbers, called scalars. Scalars are often taken to be real numbers, but there are also vector spaces with <b>scalar</b> multiplication by complex numbers, rational numbers, or generally any field. The operations of vector addition and <b>scalar</b> multiplication must satisfy certain requirements, called axioms, listed below.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{discuss the}} {{phenomenology}} of (1, 1) -mode adjoint <b>scalars</b> {{in the framework}} of two Universal Extra Dimensions. The Kaluza–Klein (KK) towers of these adjoint <b>scalars</b> arise in the 4 -dimensional effective theory from the 6 th component of the gauge fields after compactification. Adjoint <b>scalars</b> can have KK-number conserving as well as KK-number violating interactions. We calculate the KK-number violating operators involving these <b>scalars</b> and two Standard Model fields. Decay widths of these <b>scalars</b> into different channels have been estimated.

50|$|When the {{requirement}} that the set of <b>scalars</b> form a field is relaxed so that it need only form a ring (so that, for example, the division of <b>scalars</b> need not be defined, or the <b>scalars</b> need not be commutative), the resulting more general algebraic structure is called a module.|$|R
