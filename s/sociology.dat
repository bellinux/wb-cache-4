5|$|A {{subfield}} of the <b>sociology</b> {{of health}} and illness that overlaps with cultural <b>sociology</b> {{is the study of}} death, dying and bereavement, sometimes referred to broadly as the <b>sociology</b> of death. This topic is exemplifed by the work of Douglas Davies and Michael C. Kearl.|$|E
5|$|Environmental <b>sociology</b> is {{the study}} of human {{interactions}} with the natural environment, typically emphasizing human dimensions of environmental problems, social impacts of those problems, and efforts to resolve them. As with other sub-fields of <b>sociology,</b> scholarship in environmental <b>sociology</b> may be at one or multiple levels of analysis, from global (e.g. world-systems) to local, societal to individual. Attention is paid also to the processes by which environmental problems become defined and known to humans. As argued by notable environmental sociologist John Bellamy Foster, the predecessor to modern environmental <b>sociology</b> is Marx's analysis of the metabolic rift, which influenced contemporary thought on sustainability. Environmental <b>sociology</b> is often interdisciplinary and overlaps with the <b>sociology</b> of risk, rural <b>sociology</b> and the <b>sociology</b> of disaster.|$|E

5|$|His The Method of <b>Sociology</b> first {{introduced}} {{his concept of}} divisions within subfields of <b>sociology.</b> His most notable works included two books published {{in the same year}} (1952): Modern Nationalities, and Cultural Sciences. The former is an analysis of the evolution of national-culture societies, and the latter presents a theoretical study of the relation between <b>sociology</b> and other sciences. Znaniecki never finished his magnum opus, Systematic <b>Sociology,</b> which would eventually be collected and published posthumously in its unfinished but final form as Social Relations and Social Roles: The Unfinished Systematic <b>Sociology</b> (1965).|$|E
5|$|Human ecology {{deals with}} {{interdisciplinary}} {{study of the}} relationship between humans and their natural, social, and built environments. In addition to Environmental <b>sociology,</b> this field overlaps with architectural <b>sociology,</b> urban <b>sociology,</b> and to some extent visual <b>sociology.</b> In turn, visual sociology—which is concerned with all visual dimensions of social life—overlaps with media studies in that it uses photography, film and other technologies of media.|$|E
5|$|Public <b>sociology</b> {{refers to}} an {{approach}} to the discipline which seeks to transcend the academy in order to engage with wider audiences. It is perhaps best understood as a style of <b>sociology</b> rather than a particular method, theory, or set of political values. This approach is primarily associated with Michael Burawoy who contrasted it with professional <b>sociology,</b> a form of academic <b>sociology</b> that is concerned primarily with addressing other professional sociologists. Public <b>sociology</b> {{is also part of}} the broader field of science communication or science journalism. In a distinct but similar vein, applied <b>sociology,</b> also known as clinical <b>sociology,</b> policy <b>sociology</b> or sociological practice, applies knowledge derived from sociological research to solve societal problems.|$|E

5|$|<b>Sociology</b> {{of leisure}} {{is a fairly}} recent {{subfield}} of <b>sociology,</b> compared to more traditional subfields such as <b>sociology</b> of work, <b>sociology</b> of the family, and <b>sociology</b> of education: it saw most of its development {{in the second half}} of the 20th century. Until then, leisure had often been seen as a relatively unimportant, minor feature of society. Leisure is now recognized as a major social institution, deserving of serious sociological inquiry, particularly in Western societies.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sociology</b> {{of leisure}} {{is the study}} of how humans {{organize}} their free time. Leisure includes a broad array of activities, such as sport, tourism, and the playing of games. The <b>sociology</b> of leisure is closely tied to the <b>sociology</b> of work, as each explores a different side of the work–leisure relationship. More recent studies in the field move away from the work–leisure relationship and focus on the relation between leisure and culture. This area of <b>sociology</b> began with Thorstein Veblen's Theory of the Leisure Class.|$|E

5|$|Weber's most {{influential}} work was on economic <b>sociology,</b> political <b>sociology,</b> and the <b>sociology</b> of religion. Along with Karl Marx and Émile Durkheim, he is commonly {{regarded as one}} of the founders of modern <b>sociology.</b> But whereas Durkheim, following Comte, worked in the positivist tradition, Weber was instrumental in developing an antipositivist, hermeneutic, tradition in the social sciences. In this regard he belongs to a similar tradition as his German colleagues Werner Sombart, Georg Simmel, and Wilhelm Dilthey, who stressed the differences between the methodologies appropriate to the social and the natural sciences.|$|E

5|$|Durkheim had an {{important}} impact {{on the development of}} Anthropology and <b>Sociology,</b> influencing thinkers from his school of <b>sociology,</b> such as Marcel Mauss, but also later thinkers, such as Maurice Halbwachs, Talcott Parsons, Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, and Claude Levi-Strauss. More recently, Durkheim has influenced sociologists such as Steven Lukes, Robert Bellah, and Pierre Bourdieu. His description of collective consciousness also deeply influenced the Turkish nationalism of Ziya Gökalp, the founding father of Turkish <b>sociology.</b> Randall Collins has developed a theory of what he calls interaction ritual chains, which is a synthesis of Durkheim's work on religion with Erving Goffman's micro-sociology. Goffman himself was also deeply influenced by Durkheim in his development of the interaction order.|$|E

40|$|This review {{investigates the}} {{problems}} of definition and inequity with which the literature on parenthood and work–life balance is beset. It analyses research trajectories first within the established disciplines of organizational psychology and the <b>sociologies</b> of work and family practices, and then within the newer field of management studies. Gender, class and difference are singled out as troubling themes, especially in relation to fathers and impoverished parents. A tendency towards mono-disciplinarity is observed within organizational psychology and <b>sociologies</b> of work and family practices. The review offers explanations for the historic but narrow definition within organizational psychology and <b>sociologies</b> of work and family practices of work–life balance as affecting mainly heterosexual dual-career parent couples. The authors show how this narrow definition has led to inequities within research. They further identify as limiting the definition of work–life balance to be always ‘problematic’, rather than enriching, among employed parents. Consequently, a three-factor framework is recommended, through which future studies may address {{the problems of}} definition and equity in work–life balance literature, including: a broader definition of work–life balance to include marginalized parents; the defining of parenting and employment as potentially life-enriching; and a commendation of the transdisciplinary approach within management studies as poised to move debate forward...|$|R
5|$|Establishment of <b>sociology</b> as an independent, {{recognized}} {{academic discipline}} is amongst Durkheim's {{largest and most}} lasting legacies.

Thomas, of the study, The Polish Peasant in Europe and America (1918–20), which is considered the foundation of modern empirical <b>sociology.</b> He also made major contributions to sociological theory, introducing terms such as humanistic coefficient and culturalism.|$|E
