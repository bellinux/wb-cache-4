40|$|Yellow {{and blue}} Pantone colors were printed on a {{substrate}} with high Optical Brightening Agent (OBA) levels and then measured under different measurement conditions {{as outlined in}} ISO 13655. Both colors exhibited large DEOO shifts with lighter <b>screen</b> <b>tints,</b> as more paper influenced the measurement. The Pantone colors were further analysed after being printed on two different substrates with varying OBAs. While the solids were color-matched to a DEOO of less than 1. 0, the tints resulted in DEOO values above 7. 0 due to more paper influence in the lighter <b>screen</b> <b>tints...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} ink {{film thickness}} of <b>screen</b> <b>tints</b> compared to nearby solid printing areas of two grainless lithographic plates were measured for dot areas from 45 % to 95 %, using a photometric technique of measuring the relative quantity of ink on a known {{area of the}} plate. Four different screen rulings were used - 65 I/in., 150 1 /in., 300 1 /in. and 500 1 /in. It was found {{that there is no}} correlation between dot area and ink film thickness for the dot areas from 60 % to 95 % for the three coarser screens and from 75 % to 95 % for the 500 1 /in. screen. The results do not exclude the possibility of a correlation for dot areas less than 75 % for the 500 1 /in. screen...|$|R
50|$|The helmet had a <b>tinted</b> <b>screen</b> with an {{internal}} head up display, laser rangefinder and an infrared camera to give 360 degrees vision, internal speaker/radio and filtration equipment.|$|R
50|$|Whenever a trap {{between two}} colors is created, it will contain {{the sum of}} the two colors in {{question}} when {{at least one of them}} is a spot color. In case the two colors are process colors, the trap will contain the highest value of each of the CMYK components. This trap color is always darker than the darker of the two abutting colors. In some cases, more specifically when the two colors are light pastel-like colors, this might result in a trap that is perceived as too visible. In this case, it might be desirable to reduce the amount of color in the trap. This should be limited however: the trap should never be lighter than the darkest color since this would have the same effect as misregistration—a light colored ‘gap’ between the two colors. Also, trap color reduction is not recommended when solid spot colors are used. In this case, reduction would cause the spot color in the trap to be printed, not as a solid, but as a <b>screened</b> <b>tint.</b>|$|R
50|$|Commercialization of SPD is {{accelerating}} in {{the automotive}} industry. SPD automotive side and rear windows and sunroofs offer many benefits to passengers in the vehicle. Because of their fast-switching {{and ability to}} be tuned, they reduce unwanted light and glare, which allows users to maintain their views of the outside while reducing glare on displays and video <b>screens,</b> or <b>tint</b> the windows for additional privacy. SPD automotive glass also minimizes heat build-up inside the vehicle because {{of their ability to}} block solar heat gain. Many SPD window systems automatically switch to their maximum heat-blocking state when the vehicle is not in use.|$|R
50|$|The {{equipment}} list was generally sparse, with budget models having drivers airbag, seat belt pre-tensioners, cassette player, heated rear <b>screen</b> and <b>tinted</b> windows, and early MK1s with keypad immobilisers and a clock {{in place of}} a tachometer and 3 stud wheels, much like the AX. Further up the list sunroofs, PAS, Electric windows, ultrasonic alarm, passenger airbag, CD player, tachometer, front fog lights, bodykits, colour-coded mirror caps and alloy wheels were added, to name a few. Although MK2 Saxos were generally better equipped than their older counterparts, the interiors were still dated in comparison to other small hatchbacks of the time, such as the Vauxhall Corsa, with many of the center console controls originating from the older Citroën AX model.|$|R
50|$|Like most of Maddin's films, Dracula, Pages from a Virgin's Diary is shot in {{the silent}} film tradition, {{complete}} with title cards and mimicking special effects of the era, such as <b>tinted</b> <b>screen</b> color, shadow play, and vaseline smeared on the camera lens to create a blurry effect. The film is not entirely monochromatic, since computer-generated special effects add bright, acidic colours to tint golden coins, green bank notes, and red blood.|$|R
40|$|An {{ensemble}} is {{a collection}} of related datasets. Each dataset, or member, of an ensemble is normally large, multidimensional, and spatio-temporal. Ensembles are used extensively by scientists and mathematicians, for example, by executing a simulation repeatedly with slightly different input parameters and saving the results in an ensemble to see how parameter choices affect the simulation. To draw inferences from an ensemble, scientists need to compare data both within and between ensemble members. We propose two techniques to support ensemble exploration and comparison: a pairwise sequential animation method that visualizes locally neighboring members simultaneously, and a <b>screen</b> door <b>tinting</b> method that visualizes subsets of members using screen space subdivision. We demonstrate the capabilities of both techniques, first using synthetic data, then with simulation data of heavy ion collisions in high-energy physics. Results show that both techniques are capable of supporting meaningful comparisons of ensemble data...|$|R
2500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} was directed and produced by Tomu Izawa, and despite Utada's previous musical work, {{it is her}} visual debut. The visual opens with a small intro screen of Utada and the songs title, and disappears to show Utada sitting and singing on a yellow sofa, {{in front of a}} closed garage door. As the chourus, she starts to dance with various close-up shots of her face. The second verse and chorus showcases Utada in a small blue room lit by a LED light, and superimposed the songs title on various scenes. It ends with the singers title against her face, as the <b>screen</b> is <b>tinted</b> blue. The clip was included on her 1999 DVD collection Singles Clip Collection Vol. 1, and subsequently on the 15th anniversary edition of First Love, which included all the visuals from the record. The yellow sofa and garage door scene was parodied in Halcali's single [...] "Tandem", and subsequently through Utada's single [...] "Goodbye Happiness" [...] (Nov 2010), which she directed herself.|$|R
40|$|Conventional cameras {{rely upon}} a {{pixelated}} sensor to provide spatial resolution. An alternative approach replaces the sensor with a pixelated transmission mask encoded {{with a series of}} binary patterns. Combining knowledge of the series of patterns and the associated filtered intensities, measured by single-pixel detectors, allows an image to be deduced through data inversion. In this work we extend the concept of a ‘single-pixel camera’ to provide continuous real-time video at 10 [*]Hz, simultaneously in the visible and short-wave infrared, using an efficient computer algorithm. We demonstrate our camera for imaging through smoke, through a <b>tinted</b> <b>screen,</b> whilst performing compressive sampling and recovering high-resolution detail by arbitrarily controlling the pixel-binning of the masks. We anticipate real-time single-pixel video cameras to have considerable importance where pixelated sensors are limited, allowing for low-cost, non-visible imaging systems in applications such as night-vision, gas sensing and medical diagnostics...|$|R
5000|$|When Les Hoffman {{entered the}} {{television}} manufacturing business, {{he was a}} newcomer. He needed to keep his costs down {{and did not have}} the resources like the established companies such as Zenith or Philco. After World War II ended, there was considerable surplus materials that needed to be cleared out of company and government stores. Television picture tubes require a protective safety glass in front of it to prevent injury if the picture tube imploded. Hoffman found large quantities of yellow Plexiglas used in aircraft. Since it was low price he bought large quantities. However, the television viewing area had a yellow-green tint to it. During the early years of television there was considerable concerns that long term viewing television could damage one's eyesight due to eye strain. Hoffman took advantage of this scare by advertising that the yellow-green <b>tinted</b> <b>screen</b> reduced eye strain. He marketed his televisions as [...] "Easy Vision". Les Hoffman definitely was a shrewd and market-savvy businessman.|$|R
50|$|After {{his brief}} {{stay with the}} Ogdens, Eddie lived at Monkey Gibbons's house. Stan and Hilda began to regard Eddie as the son they never had. In 1977, he started a {{short-lived}} curtain-making business with Hilda but this ended when Mike Baldwin would not let Hilda use his factory. Eddie regularly tried to sell products to his neighbours, insisting nothing was stolen or faulty, {{but there was always}} a problem of some sort. He sold Rovers Return landlady Annie Walker a carpet with her initials on it. The initials were the same because the carpet came from the Alhambra Weatherfield Bingo Hall. His promise to get a colour television for the Ogdens was similarly unsuccessful as he only managed to get them a colour <b>tinted</b> <b>screen.</b> In 1978, Eddie was suspected by the police of stealing Stan's handcart and filling it with lead stolen from Farraday Street, even though Eddie's friend, Tiny Hargreaves, was the real culprit. The cart was impounded by the police when Hilda took it back and Eddie and Stan claimed it was stolen. But the police found Eddie's fingerprints on the cart and Stan discredited Eddie's alibi by claiming not to know him. Eddie forgave Stan when he told the police the truth, but to clear themselves, they had to admit who the real culprit was and Eddie hated the thought of shopping his friends to the police.|$|R
50|$|Released July 15, 2007, {{the music}} video for Dreams opens {{up to an}} unseen figure {{dropping}} a mass of broken crystal from her hands. Maki is then seen getting a hair cut as the song begins, with Yuusuke on a couch, singing in the background. Maki is then shown standing alone before showing up {{in a room with}} a large window. Yuusuke appears not too long after and he and Maki switch from standing in the background and foreground. As a myriad of bright hues cover the screen, Yuusuke and Maki are seen singing together in a white room, each facing away from the other. The girl dropping the broken crystals {{at the beginning of the}} video is then revealed to be Maki. During the bridge, other members of the band are seen playing their instruments in the room with one window, the edges of the screen are colored bright blue and yellow with shots of Maki's face interspersed. Yuusuke and Maki are then seen in the room once more before the screen returns to Maki singing by herself in the room with one window. Another quick shot of Makai and Yuusuke in the white room is shown for a few seconds before switching to Yuusuke singing alone in a room and the other members once again showing off their playing. Maki then returns to her hair cut and shots of her singing on a yellow <b>tinted</b> <b>screen</b> are interspersed at different times before the song and video ends on a close up of Maki.|$|R
