The main {{difference between the two}} <b>sockets</b> is the <b>supported</b> HyperTransport version, while <b>Socket</b> F <b>supports</b> HyperTransport 2.0 at 1.0 GHz speed, <b>Socket</b> F+ <b>supports</b> HyperTransport 3.0 at up to 2.6 GHz speed and is backwards compatible with version 1.0 and 2.0.|$|R
50|$|LGA 1150 is {{designed}} {{as a replacement for}} the LGA 1155 socket, which is also known as Socket H2. The LGA 1150 socket has 1150 protruding pins that make contact with the pads on the bottom side of the processor. Cooling systems for LGA 1155 and LGA 1156 sockets are forward compatible with LGA 1150, due to them all sharing the same distance of 75 mm between each screw hole. Most motherboards with the LGA 1150 <b>socket</b> <b>support</b> varying video outputs (VGA, DVI or HDMI depending on the model) and Intel Clear Video Technology.|$|E
5000|$|In 2001, Gibson {{predicted}} that Microsoft's {{implementation of the}} SOCK_RAW protocol in the initial release of Windows XP would lead to widespread chaos by {{making it easier for}} Windows XP users to create denial of service (DoS) attacks. [...] In that year, his company's website was brought down by a DoS attack generated by a [...] "13-year-old amateur hacker"; the attacks continued for two weeks. Gibson blogged about the attacks and his efforts to track down the hacker. [...] The internet did not collapse, but three years after the Windows XP release, Microsoft limited raw <b>socket</b> <b>support</b> in Service Pack 2.|$|E
5000|$|Service Pack 2 {{also added}} new {{security}} enhancements (codenamed [...] "Springboard"), {{which included a}} major revision to the included firewall (renamed Windows Firewall, and now enabled by default), Data Execution Prevention gained hardware support in the NX bit that can stop some forms of buffer overflow attacks. Raw <b>socket</b> <b>support</b> is removed (which supposedly limits {{the damage done by}} zombie machines) and the Windows Messenger service (which had been abused to cause pop-up advertisements to be displayed as system messages without a web browser or any additional software) became disabled by default. Additionally, security-related improvements were made to e-mail and web browsing. Service Pack 2 also added Security Center, an interface which provides a general overview of the system's security status, including the state of the firewall and automatic updates. Third-party firewall and antivirus software can also be monitored from Security Center.|$|E

40|$|Embedded {{systems are}} usually {{suffering}} from limited resources which require a modified architecture of software {{to take the}} best usage of the resources. TCP/IP {{is the most important}} communication protocol for networked embedded systems which provide internet connectivity for hosts. Many of TCP/IP development for embedded systems lack system modeling, analysis and design. This paper presents a proposed lightweight TCP/IP architecture which consists of TCP/IP kernel,memory management, multi-threading and <b>socket</b> <b>support</b> to fit limited hardware resources devices. SysML is a general purpose modeling language is used to model the lightweight TCP/IP. The proposed SysML model discusses full functional analysis, design and requirement of the proposed architecture...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The paper {{analyzes}} the two pile caps with partially embedded socket and subject a center load. Three models were experimentally tested, varying {{the type of}} conformation of the column and walls of the socket, with a smooth, the other rough, and a monolithic two pile cap, used for reference. The roughening of the column-socket interface was examined {{with the aim of}} verifying the difference of the distribution of compressive and tensile stresses in the strut an tie model used for design. The experimental test to show that the two pile caps with conformation rough of the column and walls of the <b>socket,</b> <b>support</b> more load in comparison with two pile caps with smooth of the column and walls of the socket. Both however underperformed the monolithic two pile cap, with values of 66 % and 36 % respectively...|$|E
