As a concession for being <b>stripped</b> <b>of</b> most <b>of</b> <b>their</b> players, the former WHA clubs were permitted to keep two goaltenders and two skaters.

5|$|A lighter {{alternative}} to the turret, particularly popular with the French navy, was the barbette. These were fixed armored towers which held a gun on a turntable. The crew was sheltered from direct fire, but vulnerable to plunging fire, for instance from shore emplacements. The barbette was lighter than the turret, needing less machinery and no roof armor—though nevertheless some barbettes were <b>stripped</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> armor plate to reduce the top-weight of their ships. The barbette became widely adopted in the 1880s, and {{with the addition of}} an armored 'gun-house', transformed into the turrets of the pre-Dreadnought battleships.|$|E

He phones Marceline, telling her to rush over and bring her stuffed teddy bear Hambo.|$|E
