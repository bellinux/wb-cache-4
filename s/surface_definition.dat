40|$|We {{present an}} {{adaptive}} grid based algorithm to compute {{a family of}} relevant molecular surfaces. Molecular interfaces are important in simulations and visualization involving biomolecules. The Richards surface has traditionally {{been used as a}} good approximation to the surface, and defined as the surface formed by the inner facing part of a solvent probe atom rolling along the van der Waals surface of the molecule. Computing and representing this surface has traditionally involved complex geometrical data structures like alpha shapes. Adaptive and uniform trilinear grids are commonly used in various simulations involving interactions of molecules or computation of electrostatics and other energy terms. We make use of this grid directly to compute the Molecular Surface and properties like area, volume, curvatures, surface atoms and other surfaces. We compare geometrical and biochemical properties with other methods as a validation. 1 Molecular <b>Surface</b> <b>Definitions</b> Explicit <b>surface</b> <b>definitions</b> as the interface between the solvent and proteins have been given since 1970 s. Since it is easier to handle implicitly defined models mathematically, different implicit approximations to these surfaces have been developed. 1. 1 van der Waals and Lee Richards <b>Surface</b> <b>Definitions</b> The most common model for molecules is as a collection of atoms represented by spheres, with radii equal to their van der Waals radii.

This single API uses sophisticated algorithms to create high-quality n-sided surfaces that meet user-specified tolerances for position and continuity on boundaries and on optional internal guiding geometry. Advanced Covering allows a surface to be fit onto circuits (collections of edges that form closed loops) in solid or wire bodies, which is useful in consumer product design.

50|$|So that’s how NURBS {{started at}} Boeing. Boehm’s B-spline {{refinement}} paper from CAD ’80 was of primary importance. It enabled {{the staff to}} understand non-uniform splines and to appreciate the geometrical nature of the definition so as to use B-splines in solving engineering problems. The first use of the geometrical nature of B-splines was in the curve/curve intersection. The Bezier subdivision process was utilized, and a second use was our curve offset algorithm, {{which was based on}} a polygon offset process that was eventually communicated to and used by SDRC and explained by Tiller and Hanson in their offset paper of 1984. The staff also developed an internal NURBS class taught to about 75 Boeing engineers. The class covered Bezier curves, Bezier to B-spline and surfaces. The first public presentation of our NURBS work was at a Seattle CASA/SME seminar in March of 1982. The staff had progressed quite far by then. They could take a rather simple NURBS <b>surface</b> <b>definition</b> of an aircraft and slice it with a plane surface to generate an interesting outline of some of the wing, body and engines. The staff were allowed great freedom in pursuing our ideas and Boeing correctly promoted NURBS, but the task of developing that technology into a useable form was too much for Boeing, which abandoned the TIGER task late in ’84.|$|E

30|$|The {{original}} <b>surface</b> <b>definitions</b> {{consist in}} linear NURBS for both solids.

Figure 10 shows the vertical displacements u^h_y along a line located on the top surface of the lower solid for the cases of linear facets and fitting NURBS definitions, which are very similar.

40|$|Abstract We {{define a}} {{discrete}} Laplace–Beltrami operator for simplicial <b>surfaces</b> (<b>Definition</b> 16). It depends {{only on the}} intrinsic geometry of the surface and its edge weights are positive. Our Laplace operator {{is similar to the}} well known finiteelements Laplacian (the so called “cotan formula”) except that {{it is based on the}} intrinsic Delaunay triangulation of the simplicial surface. This leads to new definitions of discrete harmonic functions, discrete mean curvature, and discrete minimal <b>surfaces.</b> The <b>definition</b> of the discrete Laplace–Beltrami operator depends on the existence and uniqueness of Delaunay tessellations in piecewise flat surfaces. While the existence is known, we prove the uniqueness. Using Rippa’s Theorem we show that, as claimed, Musin’s harmonic index provides an optimality criterion for Delaunay triangulations, and this can be used to prove that the edge flipping algorithm terminates also in the setting of piecewise flat surfaces...|$|R

This paper can be considered as an extension of [26], where we study the effect of the <b>surface</b> <b>definition</b> (hence the contact gap) when solving frictionless contact problems with cgFEM. In addition to the previous approaches, linear facets and a combination of FE solution and NURBS surface, in this work we propose a new method in which the deformed configuration is defined as a NURBS surface, i.e., the control points of the original CAD surface are updated such that the new configuration fits the finite element displacement field of the contact surface.|$|E

However, the same coarse mesh had no convergence problems using the other two <b>surface</b> <b>definitions,</b> thanks to the consideration of the exact geometry. The last mesh was not solved using the NURBS displacement method due to the high amount of nodes coupled by each surface, which results in non-viable computational cost.|$|R
