5|$|Adaptation is the {{evolutionary}} process whereby an organism becomes {{better able to}} live in its habitat or habitats. Ecological factors such as habitat type, climate, prey specialization, and predatory competition {{have been shown to}} greatly influence gray wolf craniodental plasticity, which is an adaptation of the cranium and teeth due to the influences of the environment. Similarly, the dire wolf was a hypercarnivore, with a skull and dentition adapted for hunting large and struggling prey; the shape of its skull and snout changed across time, and changes in the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> body have been correlated to climate fluctuations.|$|E
5|$|After Animaniacs, Spielberg {{collaborated with}} Warner Bros. Animation again {{to produce the}} {{short-lived}} series Steven Spielberg Presents Freakazoid, along with the Animaniacs spin-off series Pinky and the Brain, from which Pinky, Elmyra & the Brain was later spun off. Warner Bros. also produced two other comedy animated series in the later half of the decade titled Histeria! and Detention, which were short-lived and unsuccessful compared to the earlier series. Later, Warner Bros. cut back the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> animation studio because the show Histeria! went over its budget, and most production on further Warner Bros. animated comedy series ceased.|$|E
5|$|In summary, {{the main}} {{competencies}} of the Tagora were its spacious cabin (though {{it was not}} class-leading), its comfortable seating, its fuel economy (in 2.2 GLS form) and the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> luggage compartment (572 litres). But {{the fact that a}} car launched in 1974, the Volvo 244 GLE, could offer better seats, disc brakes all round, better headlights, better ventilation and better handling for only slightly more than Talbot was charging for their car indicated that the Tagora had come to market with a vehicle that was uncompetitive in too many major respects.|$|E

5|$|The Icelandic {{financial}} crisis {{was a major}} economic and political event in Iceland that involved the default of {{all three of the}} country's major privately owned commercial banks in late 2008, following their difficulties in refinancing their short-term debt and a run on deposits in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.

5|$|The central {{concept of}} natural {{selection}} is the evolutionary fitness of an organism. Fitness is measured by an organism's ability to survive and reproduce, which determines the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> genetic contribution to the next generation. However, fitness {{is not the same}} as the total number of offspring: instead fitness is indicated by the proportion of subsequent generations that carry an organism's genes. For example, if an organism could survive well and reproduce rapidly, but its offspring were all too small and weak to survive, this organism would make little genetic contribution to future generations and would thus have low fitness.|$|E

5|$|The {{species of}} Paraceratherium are mainly {{discernible}} through skull characteristics. P. bugtiense and P. orgosensis share {{features such as}} relatively slender maxillae and premaxillae, shallow skull roofs, mastoid-paroccipital processes that are relatively thin and placed back on the skull, a lambdoid crest, which extends less back, and an occipital condyle with a horizontal orientation. P. transouralicum has robust maxillae and premaxillae, upturned zygomata, domed frontal bones, thick mastoid-paroccipital processes, a lambdoid crest that extends back, and occipital condyles with a vertical orientation. P. orgosensis is distinguished from the other species by the larger <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> teeth, and distinct crochets of its molars.|$|E

5|$|While the {{merchant}} marine was technologically outdated, and slower {{than that of}} the First World, it still attracted a consistent volume of cargo. The reason for the technological backwardness of {{the merchant}} marine were First World induced boycotts of Soviet shipping.

Under Mikhail Gorbachev's rule the Soviet Union became the largest buyer of new ships in the world.

5|$|Although the {{presence}} of an embryo per se would be equivocal regarding this issue, the conditions in which the embryo were preserved provide strong evidence that Dinocephalosaurus was viviparous. There is no preserved calcified eggshell surrounding the embryo, despite {{the presence}} of delicately-preserved calcified elements from other animals at Luoping. This is consistent with the eggshells surrounding the embryos of viviparous reptiles being non-calcified membranes. Furthermore, the relative proportions of the humerus and the fibula in the embryo, compared with the maternal individual and IVPP V13898 from Panxian, indicate that the embryo is around 12% of the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> mother. Combined with its ossified bones, this suggests that the embryo was at an advanced developmental stage, whereas crocodilians, birds, turtles, and tuataras lay eggs at very early developmental stages.|$|E

5|$|By 1901 {{there were}} so few rubber plants left in the {{concession}} that the Free State authorities granted permission for the villagers to cut down the remaining plants and grind their bark to retrieve the rubber. Once this process was completed the rubber tax was abolished. The Abir company merged with the Société Anversoise in May 1911 to form the Compagnie du Congo Belge and now focussed on the management of rubber plantations and the gathering of rubber from them. However, later that year it agreed with the Belgian government to reduce the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> operations and its monopoly status. In July 1911 it was banned from collecting rubber {{within the confines of}} its old concession for 18 months and was subject to new laws introduced by the Free State. The later history of the company is unknown but it continued to operate until at least 1926 when it split off its oil palm concessions into the Maringa company.|$|E
5|$|Certain planes feature aggressive, multi-segmented {{creatures that}} perish {{when all of}} their {{segments}} are eaten by the player's creature; however, they can eat segments of the player's creature to regrow their own. These creatures release many cells upon death, which can restore {{the health of the}} player's creature, temporarily increase the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> mouth, or cause it to sprout decorative protrusions. Players are not required to eat these or any other organisms; they may travel to higher or lower planes at any time. Being defeated by aggressive creatures does not result in death, but causes the player's creature to float to a higher plane. In the Flash version, the player can replay the game with a jellyfish-like organism by defeating an aggressive creature on the bottom plane. If the player reaches the bottom again, the creature there is their original worm-like creature, and defeating it starts the game over as that organism.|$|E

Substantive sovereignty talks again ended by 1981, and the dispute escalated with passing time. In April 1982, the disagreement became an armed conflict when Argentina invaded the Falklands and other British territories in the South Atlantic, briefly occupying them until a UK expeditionary force retook the territories in June. After the war, the United Kingdom expanded its military presence, building RAF Mount Pleasant and increasing the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> garrison.
