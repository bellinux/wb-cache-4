5|$|Boron carbide's {{structure}} is only approximately B4C, {{and it shows}} a clear depletion of carbon from this suggested <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>ratio.</b> This is due to its very complex structure. The substance can be seen with empirical formula B12C3 (i.e., with B12 dodecahedra being a motif), but with less carbon, as the suggested C3 units are replaced with C-B-C chains, and some smaller (B6) octahedra are present as well (see the boron carbide article for structural analysis). The repeating polymer plus semi-crystalline structure of boron carbide gives it great structural strength per weight. It is used in tank armor, bulletproof vests, and numerous other structural applications.|$|E

This is sometimes {{used for the}} solid-state synthesis of complex ionic compounds from solid reactants, which are first melted together. In other cases, the solid reactants {{do not need to}} be melted, but instead can react through a solid-state reaction route. In this method the reactants are repeatedly finely ground into a paste, and then heated to a temperature where the ions in neighbouring reactants can diffuse together during the time the reactant mixture remains in the oven. Other synthetic routes use a solid precursor with the correct <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>ratio</b> of non-volatile ions, which is heated to drive off other species.|$|E

40|$|The <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>ratios</b> of {{dissolved}} {{inorganic carbon}} (DIC) and nutrients during biological removal have been widely assumed to follow the Redfield ratios (especially the C/N ratio) in large river plume ecosystems. However, this assumption has not been systematically examined and documented because DIC and nutrients are rarely studied simultaneously in a river plume area, a region {{in which they can}} be affected by strong river-ocean mixing as well as intense biological activity. We examined <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>ratios</b> of DIC, total alkalinity (TA), and nutrients (NO 3 , PO 4 3 &minus; and Si(OH) 4 ) data during biological removal in the Mississippi River plume and adjacent continental shelf in June 2003 and August 2004 with biological removals defined as the difference between measured values and values predicted on the basis of conservative mixing determined using a multi-endmember mixing model. Despite complex physical and biogeochemical influences, relationships between DIC and nutrients were strongly dependent on salinity range and geographic location, and influenced by biological removal. Lower C/Si and N/Si ratios in one nearshore area were attributed to a potential silicate source induced by water exchange with coastal salt marshes. When net biological uptake was separated from river-ocean mixing and the impact of marshes and bays excluded, <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>ratios</b> of C/N/Si were similar to the Redfield ratios, thus supporting the applicability of the Redfield-type C/N/Si ratios as a principle in river-plume biogeochemical models...|$|R

40|$|Currently {{there is}} very little {{systematic}} work that quantifies the performance of energetic materials in terms of thrust or heat deposition applied to electronic circuits. A better understanding of the interactions between nano-scale energetic materials and electronic systems, as a function of stoichiometry is needed for enhanced defeat. Both of these needs are addressed in this research. Formulations of Al-CuO and Al-Bi 2 O 3 nano-thermites were prepared at different equivalence ratios and selectively deposited onto silicon substrates and thrust and heat deposition of these materials was quantified. Both nano-thermite systems produced maximum thrust near <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>ratios,</b> and more fuel-rich mixtures led to significant decreases in thrust. In contrast, fuel-rich formulations of both nano-thermite systems resulted in increased heat deposition due to less gas production, which removed hot products from substrate surfaces, and lower heat deposition was observed near <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>ratios.</b> The heat transfer from the Al-CuO system increased more than the Al-Bi 2 O 3 system at fuel rich conditions.
