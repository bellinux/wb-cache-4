50|$|Trichoderma is a genus of fungi that {{is present}} in all soils, where {{they are the most}} {{prevalent}} culturable fungi.

5|$|While {{the vast}} {{majority}} of wasps play no role in pollination, a few species can effectively transport pollen and pollinate <b>several</b> plant <b>species.</b> Since wasps generally do not have a fur-like covering of soft hairs and a special body part for pollen storage (Pollen basket) as some bees do, pollen does not stick to them well. However {{it has been shown that}} even without hairs, <b>several</b> wasp <b>species</b> are able to effectively transport pollen, therefore contributing for potential pollination of <b>several</b> plant <b>species.</b>|$|R
