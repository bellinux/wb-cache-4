5|$|Several digitisations {{have been}} made of both ATF's {{original}} Garamond and the Linotype adaptation, most notably a 2015 digitisation by van Bronkhorst with optical sizes and the original <b>swash</b> <b>characters.</b> A loose adaptation with sans-serif companion by Christian Schwartz is the corporate font of Deutsche Bahn.|$|R
5|$|A revival by Frederic Goudy for the American {{branch of}} Monotype, the name chosen to differ from other revivals. An elegant sample created by Bruce Rogers {{was shown in}} a spring 1923 issue of Monotype's magazine. It like Monotype Garamond {{features}} a large range of <b>swash</b> <b>characters,</b> based on Imprimerie Nationale specimen sheets.|$|R
25|$|Caslon Old Face is a {{typeface}} {{with multiple}} optical sizes, including 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 22, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 60, 72, 96 points. Each font has small capitals, long esses and <b>swash</b> <b>characters.</b> The 96 point font came in roman only and without small capitals. Caslon Old Face {{was released in}} July 2001.|$|R
50|$|A swash is a {{typographical}} flourish, such as {{an exaggerated}} serif, terminal, tail, entry stroke, etc., on a glyph.The use of <b>swash</b> <b>characters</b> dates back to at least the 16th century, {{as they can be}} seen in Ludovico Vicentino degli Arrighi's La Operina, which is dated 1522. As with italic type in general, they were inspired by the conventions of period handwriting. Arrighi's designs influenced designers in Italy and particularly in France.|$|R
5|$|American Type Founders {{created a}} revival of the Imprimerie Nationale fonts from around 1917, which was {{designed}} in-house by its design department led by Morris Fuller Benton under the influence of its historian and advisor Henry Lewis Bullen. It received a sumptuous showing, marketed especially towards advertisers, in ATF's 1923 specimen book. Also involved in the design's development was book and advertising designer T.M. Cleland, who created a set of matching borders and ornaments, and according to Warde and Garnett also designed the <b>swash</b> <b>characters.</b>|$|R
50|$|The family {{contains}} {{a large number}} of alternate <b>characters,</b> such as <b>swashes</b> and unicase <b>characters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many Bookman revivals {{appeared}} for phototypesetting {{systems in}} the 1960s and 1970s, often including an extensive repertoire of <b>swash</b> <b>characters,</b> meaning that the design is commonly associated with the graphic design of the period. These large character repertoires {{took advantage of the}} new phototypesetting technology, which allowed characters to be stored on film or glass phototype master disks and printed at any desired size, rather than bulky metal type. Letraset created one revival during this period. The separation of type designs from the complex manufacturing process of metal type also allowed for easier cloning of typefaces, meaning that many fonts sold during the period were unauthorised copies or modifications of other companies' designs.|$|R
50|$|Zapf was {{concerned}} {{that this was the}} wrong way to go, and while he was interested in creating a complicated program, he was worried about starting something new. However, Zapf remembered a page of calligraphy from his sketchbook from 1944 and considered the possibility of making a typeface from it. He had tried to create a calligraphic typeface for Stempel in 1948, but hot metal composition placed too many limits on the freedom of <b>swash</b> <b>characters.</b> Such a pleasing result could only be achieved using modern digital technology, and so Zapf and Siegel began work on the complicated software necessary. Siegel also hired Gino Lee, a programmer from Boston, Massachusetts, to work on the project.|$|R

Siegel also hired Gino Lee, a type designer from Boston, Massachusetts, to render the extensive character set. (The [...] "ino" [...] in [...] "Zapfino" [...] refers to Gino.) ...|$|R
50|$|ITC Bookman is {{a revival}} {{designed}} by Ed Benguiat in 1975, for the International Typeface Corporation. Benguiat developed a full {{family of four}} weights plus complementary cursive designs: unlike previous Bookman versions, these are true italics in which the letters take on handwriting forms. Benguiat also drew a suite of <b>swash</b> and alternate <b>characters</b> {{for each of the}} members of the family. While Bookman's x-height was quite high already, this enlarges the lower-case even more, in the fashion of the period. Fonts for <b>swash</b> and alternate <b>characters</b> were eventually released in OpenType versions of the fonts, or separately as ITC Bookman Swash.|$|R
50|$|A {{couple of}} years later, Pelavin created a suite of <b>swash</b> and {{alternate}} <b>characters</b> for the design. Eventually, ITC asked Pelavin to draw a bold weight to complement the original release. ITC Anna Extended is the result.|$|R
2500|$|The {{character}} was originally supposed {{to appear in}} only six episodes, but Mickey proved so popular with viewers that the soap's executive producer, Louise Berridge, decided to make him into a regular <b>character.</b> <b>Swash</b> has commented, [...] "I'm pleased it happened that way, I have done {{it on my own}} merit rather than coming in as part of a family. It's a bit more special." ...|$|R
5000|$|Commercial {{releases}} {{have been}} made by Monotype, Fontsite, DTP Types, Electric Typographer, Lanston Type, Bitstream, URW++ (bundled with Microsoft Office), Adobe, and Linotype. As many early digitisations were sublicensed, several of these may represent the same digitisation marketed by different rights-holders, possibly upgraded with modern features such as contextual ligature substitution and small caps. LTC's digitisation includes the calligraphic and <b>swash</b> alternate <b>characters,</b> as well as small caps. Goudy Catalog has been copied by Scangraphic, Bitstream, URW++, and Elsner+Flake. A version called Goudy Schoolbook also exists, with single-story versions of the letters a and g, but it is not for sale to the general public. (The digitisation bundled with Microsoft Office lacks all these features; it does include ligatures, but they must be inserted manually.) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{completed}} {{family was}} released for general use in 1929, with a first showing in Monotype's specimen booklet The Trained Printer and the Amateur by Alfred W. Pollard. Monotype {{described it as}} a 'long-descender type of great distinction', emphasising its feeling of not having been restricted to allow tighter linespacing, as other types often had been in the hot metal period. Monotype has sold the design with bold and bold italic designs (their invention, since bold type did not exist until much later), and <b>swash</b> italic alternate <b>characters.</b>|$|R
