5|$|On July 1, 1998, an ammonia leak and {{explosion}} at the Seward Fisheries plant caused {{a fire that}} led to the evacuation of Homer Spit and the ultimate destruction of the facility, which until then had been the major supplier of fish remains for Keene's feeding operation. But Keene was able to report when winter came that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> other sources and was ready for the eagles when they returned.|$|E
5|$|Manning {{copied the}} files from her laptop to an SD card for her camera, {{so that she}} could take it with her to the United States while on R leave. Army {{investigators}} later found the SD card in Manning's basement room in her aunt's home, in Potomac, Maryland. On January 23, Manning flew to the United States via Germany, for two weeks of leave. It was during this visit that she first went out dressed as a woman, wearing a wig and makeup.

5|$|David and her editor Jill Norman had {{discussed}} such a book {{as early as}} the 1970s, but work on other projects precluded it. After David's death, Norman found when sorting out her papers that David had written and compiled far more material on a Christmas theme than anyone else had realised. Among the papers was an introduction that David had written for the projected volume, in which she said that one of her motives for writing a book about Christmas cooking was to head off the annual last-minute requests for recipes from her friends and relations. Those <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> most frequently asked for formed the core of the book. Together with some Christmas recipes from Mediterranean Food, French Provincial Cooking, and Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen, and revised articles published in previous years in magazines, they were turned into a 214-page book. The chapters dealt with the social and historical side of Christmas, first courses and cold meats, soups, poultry and game, meat, vegetables and salads, sauces, pickles and chutneys, and desserts, cakes and drinks.|$|E

25|$|Winnicott's {{theoretical}} elusiveness {{has been}} linked to his efforts to modify Kleinian views. But whereas from a Kleinian standpoint, his repudiation of the concepts of envy and the death instinct were a resistant retreat from the harsh realities <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> in infant life, he has also been accused of being too close to Klein: of sharing in her regressive shift of focus away from the Oedipus complex to the pre-oedipal.|$|E

He later became the de facto absolute ruler of New Russia, governing its colonisation.|$|E

25|$|The {{incentive}} to give outward practical expression to her inward motive was inspired in Teresa by the Franciscan priest Saint Peter of Alcantara who became acquainted with her early in 1560, and became her spiritual guide and counselor.

25|$|Cabot went to Bristol {{to arrange}} {{preparations}} for his voyage. Bristol was the second-largest seaport in England. From 1480 onward it had supplied several expeditions {{to look for}} Hy-Brazil. According to Celtic legend, this island lay somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. There was widespread belief among merchants in the port that Bristol men had discovered the island at earlier date but then lost track of it. Note: Ruddock had contended in a private 1988 letter to a colleague, Quinn, that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> evidence in Italian archives that Bristol men had discovered North America pre-1470. As the island {{was believed to be}} a source of brazilwood (from which a valuable red dye could be obtained), merchants had economic incentive to find it.|$|E
