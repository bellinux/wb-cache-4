25|$|A {{number of}} basic {{principles}} are accepted by scientists as standards for {{determining whether a}} body of knowledge, method, or practice is scientific. Experimental results should be reproducible and verified by other researchers. These principles are intended to ensure experiments can be reproduced measurably given the same conditions, allowing further investigation {{to determine whether a}} hypothesis or theory related to given phenomena is both valid and reliable. Standards require the scientific method to be applied throughout, and bias to be controlled for or eliminated through randomization, fair <b>sampling</b> <b>procedures,</b> blinding of studies, and other methods. All gathered data, including the experimental or environmental conditions, are expected to be documented for scrutiny and made available for peer review, allowing further experiments or studies to be conducted to confirm or falsify results. Statistical quantification of significance, confidence, and error are also important tools for the scientific method.|$|E

40|$|Assuming a Latin square design {{model with}} unknown and {{possibly}} unequal normal error variances, the interest {{is to develop}} a one-stage <b>sampling</b> <b>procedure</b> to test the null hypothesis of equal treatment eects. The <b>sampling</b> <b>procedure</b> is to split up each single sample in a cell combination into two portions; the rst portion of observations is used for initial estimation and the second one is then combined with the rst one for overall use in order to dene a weighted sample mean, which is used to serve as a basis for a test statistic for the Latin square design model. It is found that the distribution of the test statistic based on the weighted sample means is completely independent of the unknown variances. The Latin square design model can be expressed by a general linear model which is easy in practical calculations using matrix. A 33 standard Latin square design model is used to illustrate their relationship.

First, using the large deviations result for the Gaussian model in Glasserman, Kang, and Shahabuddin (2005 a), we devise and apply a change of measure to the chi-square random variable.

40|$|ABSTRACT. This article {{introduces}} a general framework for <b>sampling</b> and reconstruction <b>procedures</b> {{based on a}} consistency requirement, introduced by Unser and Aldroubi in [29]. The procedures we develop allow for almost arbitrary sampling and reconstruction spaces, as well as arbitrary input signals. We first derive a nonredundant <b>sampling</b> <b>procedure.</b> We then introduce the new concept of oblique dual frame vectors, that lead to frame expansions in which the analysis and synthesis frame vectors are not constrained to lie in the same space. Based on this notion, we develop a redundant <b>sampling</b> <b>procedure</b> {{that can be used}} to reduce the quantization error when quantizing the measurements prior to reconstruction. 1...|$|R
40|$|When {{estimating}} in {{a practical}} situation, asymmetric loss functions are preferred over squared error loss functions, as the former is more appropriate than the latter in many estimation problems. We consider here the problem of fixed precision point estimation of a linear parametric function in beta for the multiple linear regression model using asymmetric loss functions. Due {{to the presence of}} nuissance parameters, the sample size for the estimation problem is not known beforehand and hence we take the recourse of adaptive multistage sampling methodologies. We discuss here some multistage sampling techniques and compare the performances of these methodologies using simulation runs. The implementation of the codes for our proposed models is accomplished utilizing MATLAB 7. 0. 1 program run on a Pentium IV machine. Finally, we highlight the significance of such asymmetric loss functions with few practical examples. loss function, risk, bounded risk, asymmetric loss function, LINEX loss function, relative LINEX loss function, stopping rule, multistage <b>sampling</b> <b>procedure,</b> purely sequential <b>sampling</b> <b>procedure,</b> batch sequential <b>sampling</b> <b>procedure,...</b>|$|R
