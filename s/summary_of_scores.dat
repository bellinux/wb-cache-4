Because of the emphasis on different languages and different subject areas the research has focused on the development of general purpose, re-usable techniques. The CRL/Brandeis group have implemented statistical methods for focusing on the relevant parts of texts, programs which recognize and mark names of people, places and organizations and also dates. The actual analysis of the critical parts of the texts is carried out by a parser controlled by lexical structures for the 'key ' words in the text. To extend the system's coverage of English and Japanese some of the content of these lexical structures was derived from machine readable dictionaries. These were then enhanced with information extracted from corpora. The system has already been evaluated in the 4 th Message Understanding Conference (MUC- 4) where it was required to extract information from 200 texts on South American terrorism. Considering the very short development time allowed for this additional domain the system performed adequately. The system was then adapted to handle the business domain and also to process Japanese texts. Further extensions to the system allowed it to process texts on micro-electronics development. Performance at the 12 and 18 month evaluations was good for Japanese, but less good for English where we have been attempting to automate much of the development process. A more pragmatic approach was adopted for the final 24 month evaluation, using the same hand-crafted techniques for English as had been used for Japanese. We estimate the amount of effort used directly to build the systems described here is around sixty man months...|$|E

METHOD: Relative and absolute measures of inequality based on the concentration index were used to examine {{the distribution of}} indicators of reported health based on domains and <b>summary</b> <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> the SF- 36 across occupation-related social classes in both countries. RESULTS: The degree of inequality is most pronounced in the domains and <b>summary</b> <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> the SF- 36 representing aspects of physical health.

40|$|Motivation: The key {{advantage}} <b>of</b> <b>scoring</b> functions {{based on the}} Delaunay tessellation (DT) of proteins used for fold recognition and mutagenesis {{is the use of}} higher order contact terms (four rather than two). The use of lower order contacts along with four-body terms could improve the accuracy <b>of</b> such <b>scoring</b> functions. Analysis <b>of</b> surface exposure of the contacts within the DT framework is of independent interest, and could also be critical for the performance <b>of</b> DT-based <b>scoring</b> functions. Results: We propose a unified framework for defining two, three, and four body amino acid (AA) contacts in proteins based on their Delaunay tessellations. Similar to four body scoring functions defined previously, we represent each AA by a single point, and distinguish all contacts based on their amino acid composition and back-bone chain connectivity. In addition, we define degrees of buriedness for the two and three body contacts under the same framework. There are four degrees of buriedness for two body contacts, and nine degrees for three body contacts, varying from completely non-buried (i. e., fully exposed to the surface) to completely buried. On an average, the accuracies <b>of</b> <b>scoring</b> functions for distinguishing native structures from decoys are higher when using higher order terms. More interestingly, the scoring function that combines three body terms with degrees of buriedness and four body terms is the most accurate, thus demonstrating the importance of lower order contacts and buriedness. We also use the three body contacts to define a scoring function for predicting the effects of mutagenesis on solubility of proteins.

Consensus regarding the appropriate patient-reported outcome (PRO) endpoints for clinical trials for early stage prostate cancer RT is lacking. To aid in trial design, this study presents PROs over 36 months following SBRT for clinically localized prostate cancer. Methods: 174 hormone-naïve patients {{were treated with}} 35 - 36. 25 Gy SBRT in 5 fractions. Patients completed the EPIC- 26 questionnaire at baseline and all follow-ups; the proportion of patients developing a clinically significant decline in each EPIC domain was determined. The minimally important difference (MID) {{was defined as a}} change of one-half SD from the baseline. Per RTOG 0938, we examined the percentage of patients who reported decline in EPIC urinary <b>summary</b> <b>score</b> <b>of</b> > 2 points and EPIC bowel <b>summary</b> <b>score</b> <b>of</b> > 5 points from baseline to one year. Results: 174 patients received SBRT with minimum follow-up of 36 months. The proportion of patients reporting a clinically significant decline in EPIC urinary/bowel scores was 34 %/ 30 %, 40 %/ 32. 2 %, and 32. 8 %/ 21. 5 % at 6, 12, and 36 months. The percentage of patients reporting decline in the EPIC urinary <b>summary</b> <b>score</b> <b>of</b> > 2 points was 43. 2 %, 51. 6 % and 41. 8 % at 6, 12, and 36 months. The percentage of patients reporting decline in EPIC bowel domain <b>summary</b> <b>score</b> <b>of</b> > 5 points was 29. 6 % 29 % and 22. 4 % at 6, 12, and 36 months. Conclusion: Our treatment protocol meets the RTOG 0938 criteria for advancing to a Phase III trial compared to conventionally fractionated RT. Between 12 - 36 months, the proportion of patients reporting decrease in both EPIC urinary and bowel scores declined, suggesting late improvement in these domains. Further investigation is needed to elucidate 1) which domains bear the greatest influence on post-treatment QOL, and 2) at what time point PRO endpoint(s) should be assessed...|$|R

In this study, we aimed to investigate changes in oral health related quality of life (OHRQoL) among adults during fixed orthodontic appliance therapy (FOAT). Methods: Two hundred thirty-two adult patients were enrolled from a consecutive sample at a university dental hospital. OHRQoL was assessed by 2 standardized instruments (OHIP- 14 and OHQoL-UK) at 4 times: before treatment (T 0), 6 months after bonding and banding (T 1), 12 months after bonding and banding (T 2), and 18 months after bonding and banding (T 3). Friedman 2 -way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Wilcoxon signed rank tests were {{used to compare the}} relative changes of OHRQoL among the different time points. Results: Significant changes in the <b>summary</b> <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> both the OHIP- 14 and OHQoL-UK were observed during fixed orthodontic treatment (P < 0. 001). There were significant OHRQoL deteriorations at T 1 and T 2 compared with T 0; these were reflected by <b>summary</b> <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> both the OHIP- 14 and OHQoL-UK as well as some <b>of</b> their domain <b>scores</b> (P < 0. 05). However, at T 3, the OHIP- 14 suggested deterioration in OHRQoL, but the OHQoL-UK suggested improvement in OHRQoL. Conclusions: Changes in OHRQoL occur during fixed orthodontic appliance therapy.
