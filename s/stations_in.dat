5|$|Later {{installations}} {{faced the}} opposite dilemma of having too few stations: one Streetsblog writer {{noted that the}} <b>stations</b> <b>in</b> the expansions were spaced further apart than the <b>stations</b> <b>in</b> the original service area, which would make the Citi Bike <b>stations</b> <b>in</b> these areas harder to access. In September 2017, a reporter for Time Out magazine wrote that the system did not serve the outer boroughs adequately, with stations only located in wealthier areas of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens that were closer to the Manhattan central business districts.|$|E

WABM and WTTO in Birmingham and WHP-TV in Harrisburg were {{to be sold to}} Deerfield Media, and WMMP in Charleston was to be sold to Howard Stirk Holdings – a broadcasting company owned by conservative pundit Armstrong Williams. Howard Stirk Holdings was also used as a sidecar for two conflicting <b>stations</b> <b>in</b> Sinclair's earlier {{acquisition of}} Barrington Broadcasting.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1991, however, falling {{inflation}} {{had reduced}} WMATA's construction costs {{so much that}} the agency said it could build the two final Green Line <b>stations</b> <b>in</b> Prince George's County without asking Congress for additional money. WMATA also proposed spending money almost three times faster up-front to accelerate its construction schedule, a move which would be more than compensated for by savings in out-years. Prince George's County officials threatened to block all further Metrorail construction unless they received guarantees that the <b>stations</b> <b>in</b> their county would be built. Funding for the remaining seven Green Line <b>stations</b> <b>in</b> the District and Prince George's remained in doubt as of August 1991, with District officials saying that it made sense to build the Georgia Avenue – Petworth and Columbia Heights stations and Prince George's representatives demanding that the three <b>stations</b> <b>in</b> their county be completed. WMATA said that it had so little money it could not fund 16 critical small construction projects, among them security gates at the Navy Yard and Waterfront stations and parts for escalators at the seven new Green Line <b>stations</b> <b>in</b> D.C. and Prince George's County. The funding impasse was broken in November 1991 when local and state governments agreed to roughly triple their contribution to Metro's construction costs by 1994 to complete the entire system.|$|E
