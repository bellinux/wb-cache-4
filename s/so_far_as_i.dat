5|$|And {{being on}} that blessed pilgrimage {{in the sacred}} city of Rome and seeing its great and ancient monuments and reading the great deeds of the Romans as {{described}} by Virgil, Sallust, Lucan, Livy, Valerius, Orosius, and other masters of history... I took my prompting from them although I am a disciple unworthy of such an undertaking. But {{in view of the}} fact that our city of Florence, daughter and offspring of Rome, was mounting and pursuing great purposes, while Rome was in its decline, I thought it proper to trace in this chronicle the origins of the city of Florence, <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have been able to recover them, and to relate the city's further development at greater length, and at the same time to give a brief account of events throughout the world as long as it please God, in the hope of whose favor I undertook the said enterprise rather than in reliance on my own poor wits. And thus in the year 1300, on my return from Rome, I began to compile this book in the name of God and the blessed John the Baptist and in honor of our city of Florence.|$|E

500|$|Gilbert finally {{called on}} Sullivan {{and read the}} {{libretto}} to him on 20 February 1875. [...] Sullivan was enthusiastic, later recalling, [...] " [...] read it through ...in {{the manner of a}} man considerably disappointed with what he had written. [...] As soon as he had come to the last word, he closed up the manuscript violently, apparently unconscious {{of the fact that he}} had achieved his purpose <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was concerned, inasmuch as I was screaming with laughter the whole time." [...] Trial by Jury, described as [...] "A Novel and Original Dramatic Cantata" [...] in the original promotional material, was composed and rehearsed in a matter of weeks.|$|E

500|$|Crane's poems, {{which he}} {{preferred}} to call [...] "lines", are typically not given as much scholarly attention as his fiction; no anthology contained Crane's verse until 1926. [...] Although it is not certain when Crane began to write poetry seriously, he once said that his overall poetic aim was [...] "to give my ideas {{of life as a}} whole, <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> know it". [...] The poetic style used in both of his books of poetry, The Black Riders and Other Lines and War is Kind, was unconventional for the time in that it was written in free verse without rhyme, meter, or even titles for individual works. [...] They are typically short in length; although several poems, such as [...] "Do not weep, maiden, for war is kind", use stanzas and refrains, most do not. [...] Crane also differed from his peers and poets of later generations in that his work contains allegory, dialectic and narrative situations.|$|E
500|$|Le Guin {{described}} {{coming of}} age as the main theme of the book, and wrote in a 1973 essay that she chose that theme since she was writing for an adolescent audience. She stated that [...] "Coming of age... {{is a process that}} took me many years; I finished it, <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> ever will, at about age thirty-one; and so I feel rather deeply about it. So do most adolescents. It's their main occupation, in fact." [...] She also said that fantasy was best suited as a medium for describing {{coming of age}}, because exploring the subconscious was difficult using the language of [...] "rational daily life". The coming of age that Le Guin focused on included not just psychological development, but moral changes as well. Ged needs to recognize the balance between his power and his responsibility to use it well, a recognition which comes as he travels to the stone of Terrenon and sees the temptation that that power represents.|$|E
500|$|Harris was {{followed}} into the witness-box by {{a succession of}} landladies, waitresses and other women, all of whom confirmed Davidson's habitual pestering without making any serious accusation of misconduct. [...] When Davidson himself took to the stand, on 25 May, his light-hearted, even flippant, manner created, says Tucker, [...] "the flavour of a comedy routine with the rector's counsel as straight man". Davidson's disastrous finances were aired—he took great offence when his association with Gordon was presented as a [...] "partnership in crime". [...] He caused disbelief and amusement in the court when, questioned about the boil-lancing incident with Rose Ellis, he professed not to know what a [...] "buttock" [...] was, claiming: [...] "It is a phrase I have honestly never heard. <b>So</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> remember {{it is a little}} below the waist." [...] At this stage, only Harris's largely uncorroborated testimony had provided specific allegations of immorality; the rest of the evidence was inconclusive and it seemed that the prosecution might fail. Davidson's cause was severely damaged, however, when Oliver produced a photograph of him, taken on 28 March 1932, with a nearly naked girl. She was Estelle Douglas, the 15-year-old daughter of one of Davidson' oldest friends. Davidson explained that the picture had been intended as a publicity shot to help the girl find work as an actress. He protested that he had been set up, and did not know she was naked under her shawl; he thought she was wearing a bathing suit, as she had been in an earlier photograph. [...] On 6 June, after closing speeches from both sides, the court adjourned until 8 July to allow the chancellor, who alone would determine the outcome, to consider the evidence.|$|E
6000|$|Georgina {{broke into}} a laugh. [...] "I do believe you would, if I were to ask you! But <b>I</b> won't go <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> that; <b>I</b> have {{something}} of my own. All I {{want you to do}} is to be with me." ...|$|R

2500|$|Rumours that Faith No More would reunite for {{shows in}} the UK {{in the summer of}} 2009 were {{circulating}} in late November 2008, but were originally dismissed by bassist Billy Gould. He explained: [...] "If anything like this were to happen, it would have to come from the band, and I haven't spoken with any of them in over a year. <b>So</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> know, there isn't anything to talk about, and I'm pretty sure that if you were to contact Patton, he would tell you the same thing." ...|$|R
500|$|Still, {{the film}} {{received}} mixed praise from trade publications. The Mirror commended the film for the clever adaptation which preserved coherency in the story, the good acting and adequate costuming despite a few {{flaws in the}} production. Among the errors highlighted by the Mirror was Eliza's ice scene and another scene where the black actors wore inaccurate attire such as a laborer who wore a fine shirt and tie. The Morning Telegraph reviewer did not care for the production much, finding issues with the adaptation, the acting and the scenes. The Moving Picture News was more positive in its review, praising the photography and the sensible adaptation of the book to the film format. Three different reviews in The Moving Picture World were published, each of which were positive. In contrast to the fault found in the Mirror, one of the reviewers specifically praised the ice scene by stating, [...] "This {{part of the picture}} seems to have been conceived and carried out with extraordinary realism. You see the snow falling, the ice floes cracking and moving, you felt the danger that the woman and child were running as they made their escape across the ice, pursued by their remorseless enemy through the blinding snowstorm. This is one of the finest effects I have seen on the moving picture screen, and the whole story, <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have seen it, is worked out with wonderful realism, effect and verisimilitude. It's as good a rendering of the subject as I have ever seen, and I have seen Uncle Tom's Cabin played several times." [...] The Leavenworth Times of Leavenworth, Kansas had an article reviewing the production and offered much praise for adaptation.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{composed}} {{during a period}} of personal difficulty for Eliot—his marriage was failing, and both he and Vivienne were suffering from nervous disorders. The poem is often read as a representation of the disillusionment of the post-war generation. Before the poem's publication as a book in December 1922, Eliot distanced himself from its vision of despair. On 15 November 1922, he wrote to Richard Aldington, saying, [...] "As for The Waste Land, that is {{a thing of the past}} <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> am concerned and I am now feeling toward a new form and style." ...|$|E
