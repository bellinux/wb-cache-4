25|$|Bifrenaria are {{generally}} robust plants, of <b>sympodial</b> growth, between ten and sixty centimeters tall. They {{are characterized by}} round-section root with thick velamen, four-angled fleshy pseudobulbs of one internode, often basally protected by dried sheaths and with only one apical leaf(except for Bifrenaria steyermarkii, which occasionally has two), plicate (fan-folded) enervated leathery leaves, yet malleable and not exceedingly thick, with a pseudo-petiole of basal round section, and a basal inflorescences bearing up to ten flowers, which seldom surpass the leaves' length.|$|E
25|$|Mucor plumbeus {{produces}} columella with distinctive, darkly pigmented, finger-like apical projections. Sporangiophores (structures bearing asexual spores) exhibit <b>sympodial</b> and monopodial branching. The {{appearance of}} sporangia of M. plumbeus changes throughout development from hyaline at first becoming dark brown colour at maturity. Sporangiospores are spherical, ranging from 5–7 to 8–10µm in diameter. Zygospores are also darkly coloured, though {{much larger than}} sporangiospores with an average diameter of approximately 85µm. Zygospores are ornamented with short star-shaped spines (length of 3µm). The mating system is heterothallic.|$|E
25|$|The {{inflorescence}} is compacted into a many-flowered spike, or {{a simple}} or branched raceme, and is apical, {{although it can}} seem axillary. Stems are monopodial (unbranched) until an inflorescence is formed, and then <b>sympodial</b> (potentially branched); this prevents the rosette from dying as in Agave. Flowers of all taxa within Aloeae are tubular and have some fusion of petal-like tepals, although the amount of fusion varies among genera. Differences in flower structure and colour among genera are considered to represent pollination syndromes, particularly shifts between insect and bird pollination, and so are less reliable indicators of relationships among species than was once thought. Thus Astroloba corrugata, like most species of Astroloba, has small, pale, horizontally held flowers that are insect-pollinated, whereas A.rubriflora has larger, red, vertically held flowers that are bird-pollinated.|$|E
25|$|Whether as shrubs, trees, or vines, palms {{have two}} methods of growth: solitary or clustered. The common {{representation}} {{is that of}} a solitary shoot ending in a crown of leaves. This monopodial character may be exhibited by prostrate, trunkless, and trunk-forming members. Some common palms restricted to solitary growth include Washingtonia and Roystonea. Palms may instead grow in sparse though dense clusters. The trunk develops an axillary bud at a leaf node, usually near the base, from which a new shoot emerges. The new shoot, in turn, produces an axillary bud and a clustering habit results. Exclusively <b>sympodial</b> genera include many of the rattans, Guihaia, and Rhapis. Several palm genera have both solitary and clustering members. Palms which are usually solitary may grow in clusters, and vice versa. These aberrations suggest the habit operates on a single gene.|$|E
500|$|The {{silver birch}} is a {{medium-sized}} deciduous tree, typically reaching [...] tall (exceptionally up to [...] ), with a slender trunk usually under [...] diameter. The bark {{on the trunk}} and branches is golden-brown at first, but later this turns to white {{as a result of}} papery tissue developing on the surface and peeling off in flakes, in a similar manner to the closely related Paper birch (B. papyrifera). The bark remains smooth until the tree gets quite large, but in older trees, the bark thickens, becoming irregular, dark and rugged. Young branches have whitish resin warts and the twigs are slender, hairless and often [...] The buds are small and sticky, and development is <b>sympodial,</b> that is to say the terminal bud dies away and growth continues from a lateral bud. The species is monoecious with male and female catkins found in the same tree. Some shoots are long and bear the male catkins at the tip, while others are short and bear female catkins. The immature male catkins are present during the winter but the female catkins develop in the spring, soon after the leaves unfurl.|$|E
50|$|Most are <b>sympodial</b> epiphytes, or rarely terrestrials.|$|E
5000|$|Sympodial: <b>Sympodial</b> orchids have a front (the newest growth) and a back (the oldest growth). The plant {{produces}} {{a series of}} adjacent shoots which grow to a certain size, bloom and then stop growing and are replaced. <b>Sympodial</b> orchids grow laterally rather than vertically, following the surface of their support. The growth continues by development of new leads, with their own leaves and roots, sprouting from or next {{to those of the}} previous year, as in Cattleya. While a new lead is developing, the rhizome may start its growth again from a so-called 'eye', an undeveloped bud, thereby branching. <b>Sympodial</b> orchids may have visible pseudobulbs joined by a rhizome, which creeps along the top or just beneath the soil.|$|E
