50|$|To turn a given presheaf P into a sheaf F, {{there is}} a {{standard}} device called sheafification or <b>sheaving.</b> The rough intuition of what one should do, {{at least for a}} presheaf of sets, is to introduce an equivalence relation, which makes equivalent data given by different covers on the overlaps by refining the covers. One approach is therefore to go to the stalks and recover the sheaf space of the best possible sheaf F produced from P.|$|E

Here, at a height of 2,000 feet above the sea, the crops were not quite ripe, the season being backward. Barley required a few more days of sunshine, and the potatoes were still in bloom. The evenings became cold, and the farmers' faces showed their anxiety. The wind was from the NNW, and for two consecutive nights black frost appeared. The potato-vines turned black, and the grain crop was seriously injured. After the first frost everybody was at work in the fields, women and men <b>sheaving</b> the barley, and every available hand digging the potatoes. There was sorrow in many a farmer's heart, for the people were now greatly distressed, and I detected tears on many a mother's cheek during these two days. After this sudden cold spell the weather became cloudy, a violent storm set in, and the ground was covered with eighteen inches of wet snow, though it was only the 20th of September.

40|$|The {{physical}} and chemical properties of some agricultural wastes included wheat straw, sugarcane bagasse, sugarcane peat; rice hulls as well as wood <b>sheaving</b> and sawdust as the control were examined for determine their potential as poultry bedding materials. Sugarcane bagasse and peat compared to other materials had greater initial moisture content (P< 0. 05) and there were no significant difference between other materials. The highest and lowest water holding capacity (WHC) was related to sugarcane peat (548. 14 %) and rice hulls (116. 70 %), respectively (P< 0. 05). Water releasing capacity (WRC) was significantly affected only in two hours after socking the materials in water so that the highest and lowest WRC were related to rice hulls (6. 03 %) and peat (1. 75 %), respectively (P< 0. 05). The highest and lowest pH values were related to peat (7. 26 %) and sawdust (4. 60 %), respectively (P< 0. 05). The highest and lowest bulk density were related to sawdust (182. 51 kg/m 3) and bagasse (46. 28 kg/m 3), respectively (P< 0. 05). The highest and lowest nitrogen (N) percentage values were also related to wheat straw (0. 39 %) and sawdust (0. 01 %), respectively (P< 0. 05). In conclusion, rice hulls due to its favorable properties could be successfully used as alternative poultry litter material. Peat was not a satisfactory material for applying as poultry bedding. In contrast to peat, bagasse due to similar properties to straw seems to have good potential for using as poultry litter material...|$|E
40|$|Objectives] Considering the {{shortcomings}} of the traditional <b>sheave</b> damper in buffer performance and the peak value of the greatest cable tension, [Methods] this paper presents a <b>sheave</b> damper with variable damping according to piston displacement {{as a replacement for}} the traditional <b>sheave</b> damper, and AMESim software is used for the modeling and simulation. [Results] The results show that the new <b>sheave</b> damper can significantly improve the arresting gear performance indicators, and has better adaptability for aircraft impact load. Compared with the traditional <b>sheave</b> damper, the new method can reduce cable tension by 25 % and reduce the maximum deceleration of aircraft by 23 %. [Conclusions] As such, the research in this paper can provide a theoretical reference for improving the performance of aircraft arresting gear...|$|R

Upon inspection the next morning, maintenance crews discovered that the <b>sheave</b> train on the downhill side of tower 11 had failed, and that the <b>sheave</b> had turned into the path of a chair and forced it off the cable.
