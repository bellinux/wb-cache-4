50|$|The T-18's chassis and {{suspension}} was improved {{from the}} T-16 {{by the addition}} of an extra <b>support</b> <b>roller</b> and an independent vertical spring suspension. The 300 mm track of the T-16 was transferred over to the T-18, with some improvements. The engine, a vertical, four-cylinder MS engine, was designed and improved upon by Alexander Mikulin. The engine was capable of a maximum of 35 horsepower. The MS engine was combined with the PSC transmission in one unit rather than being in two separate housings. The PSC transmission gave the tank four forward speeds and one reverse speed. The engine-transmission compartment in the back let air in via holes drilled in the rear plate. This improved protection, but also led to the engine overheating. Electrical equipment included a 6-volt battery, magneto and dynamo, which fed the lamp, horn, rear light, light distribution panel and two portable lamps.|$|E
50|$|The {{beam compass}} {{is used to}} scribe a circle, either by drawing with lead, penning by ink, or {{scratching}} with a sharpened point. The radius can be adjusted by sliding the metal point holder across a wood beam or metal rod, and locking it by turning a knob at the desired location. Some have a fine radius adjustment. The threaded adjustment {{is similar to that}} of a Screw. The only limitation is the rigidity of the wood beam or metal rod being used. Longer wooden beams tend to sag depending on the species of wood used. Metal rods can be used as an alternative, but they also have length limitations. Some trammel sets include a <b>support</b> <b>roller</b> for attachment at mid span of the beam or rod, to take out the sag. Trammel points score a precise line by using a sharpened point, or draw a line using a lead clutch, or an ink nib. When the circular knob is turned, it micro adjusts the radius of the circle. On some, a spring and screw mechanism locks the compass at the precise desired location. Turning clockwise decreases the radius while turning counterclockwise increases the radius slightly.|$|E

40|$|Key words: {{continuous}} casting; round bloom; minimum mould exit {{shell thickness}}; foot roller designing Abstract: The minimum mould exit shell thickness (MEST) {{is one of}} key factors to consider for continuous casting machine design. Based on the shell strength at elevated temperatures, a concept of shell integral average strength, from its very top surface to the solidus frontier, has been introduced to judge its bulging tendency under ferrostatic pressure. Considering the contribution for the foot roller designing, a mathematic model for {{the determination of the}} minimum MEST has been brought forward. It is shown that, when the minimal foot roll pitch is fixed, the minimum MEST is steady. But at the same time, when the MEST does not exceed the minimum value, the round bloom off-round would happen, it is worse for the round bloom than the bulging for the normal strand. And there is the cross point with the curve of the minimum MEST by the minimum roll pitch and the minimum MEST by the fluting include angle of the <b>support</b> <b>roller</b> and the lateral <b>support</b> <b>roller</b> against the cross section...|$|E
40|$|The project {{which is}} {{presented}} in this report {{is focused on the}} positioning of the <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> connected to the Kiln in one of the pelletizing plants in Kiruna at LKAB. Kiln is a rotating oven where the pellets are sintered, {{which is one of the}} steps in the pelletizing process. The <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> are used to position Kiln in an axial or vertical direction, by either skewing the rollers or positioning the whole center of the rollers towards or away from the Kiln. The plan for this project is to be used as a preparatory work for a construction of an atomized system for adjustment of the <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> for Kiln at LKAB in Kiruna. An atomized adjustment system can possibly simplify the procedure of Kiln positioning, increase the lifespan of the system and increase the reliability of the whole system. This report can also lead to improvements by being used as a support during positioning of <b>support</b> <b>rollers.</b> A <b>support</b> system for Kiln positioning can contribute to avoid production disturbances. Product disturbances can occur because of damaged components such as damaged support wheels or parts of the Kiln driveline. Less production disturbances increases the availability of the Grate-Kiln plant and thereby increases the profitability for LKAB. The aim of this project has been to develop a calculation model which can show the reactions of Kiln when the <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> are adjusted. The assignment was also to include the heating and cooling of Kiln and to have considerations regarding the gear contact in the driveline. One part of the assignment was also to document the damages that can occur because of inaccurate positioning of the <b>support</b> <b>rollers.</b> The final step in this project was to propose optimized positions for the <b>support</b> <b>rollers.</b> This project is the final assignment before examination from the M. Sc Student in Mechanical Engineering program at the University of Technology in Luleå LTU in Sweden. The main part of this project has been to develop a calculation model. The calculation model is built in a Matlab script. In this Matlab script there are essentially six parts of the script that can be varied, and these parts are:- The temperatures in the system- The dimensions of components- The load, with or without pellets- The positioning of the pellets in the Kiln - The skewing of the support rollers- The positioning of the center of the support rollersWhen these parameters are varied a result for over 170 parameters can be collected. The calculation model is mainly focused on how the forces in the system reacts when the <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> are adjusted and also how the Kiln reacts to thermal expansion and contraction. It is essentially the center positioning of the <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> which is analyzed. The calculations of the forces which occur because of the skewing of the <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> was too complicated and time consuming to be able to be finished during this project. The calculations regarding the skewing of the <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> has been started and future work has been recommended. The calculation model, which is one of the results of this project has been used to analyze the reactions from positioning the <b>support</b> <b>rollers.</b> By examine how great the height differences are for the Kiln, a maximum center positioning of the <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> has been recommended. This recommended maximum positioning is to protect any damages to the gear contact in the drive line. The thermal effects does not have a major impact on the forces in the system. Height differences that occur during heating and cooling of the Kiln has been noted up to about 9 mm. There is no great impact on the forces in the system during the interval which the <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> can be adjusted without exceeding the maximum height differences. A validation of the results in this report is planned to be performed during the summer 2015. Validerat; 20150615 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R

The influence of the integrated flexible support structure on the internal load distribution and the dynamic characteristics of the roller bearing are analyzed. The results indicate that with the support of a flexible squirrel-cage, the maximum contact load is decreased by 14. 2 %, the loading region is enlarged by 25 %, the cage slide ratio is reduced by 24 %, and the fatigue life is increased by more than 50 %.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the results of an {{experimental}} and analytical investigation on the mode I and mode II fracture mechanics behaviour of a high-strength steel. The aim was to identify the effect of crack tip geometry and loading system on the loading capacity of the material. Notched as well as pre-cracked single edge notched specimens were loaded in symmetric and anti-symmetric bending. The experimental results show that crack tip and loading parameters have a significant influence on the apparent critical fracture toughness values. The influence of a finite notch radius on the mode I and mode II fracture toughness is quantified by a J-integral analysis which indicates that for both loading systems crack initiation can be estimated by a local strain energy density criterion. A weight function analysis of the mode II loading shows that crack tip shielding due to contact between the crack faces becomes important if the distance from the first <b>support</b> <b>roller</b> to the crack plane is less than the thickness of the specimen.
