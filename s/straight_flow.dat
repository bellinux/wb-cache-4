Dr. Bruno Bruckman's old assistant on the jet engine program, Dr. Österich, took over for him in Berlin, and selected the axial flow design, due to its smaller diameter; it was 10 cm less than the competing axial-flow BMW 003.|$|E

50|$|Ideally {{a nozzle}} is wished to direct {{all of the}} gases {{generated}} in the combustion chamber and accelerated by the throat to leave the nozzle traveling straight out the nozzle. That means {{the momentum of the}} gases are axial, imparting the maximum thrust to the rocket. In fact, there are some non-axial components to the momentum. In terms of a momentum vector, there is an angle between the axis of the rocket engine and the gas flow. As a result, the thrust is lowered by varying amounts. The Bell or Contour shape is designed to impart a large angle expansion for the gases right after the throat. The nozzle is then curved back in to give a nearly <b>straight</b> <b>flow</b> of gas out the nozzle opening. The contour used is rather complex. The large expansion section near the throat causes expansion shock waves. The reversal of the slope to bring the exit to near zero degrees causes compression shock waves. A properly designed nozzle will have these two sets of shock waves coincide and cancel each other out. In this way, the bell is a compromise between the two extremes of the conical nozzle since it minimizes weight while maximizing performance.|$|E

40|$|The heat {{transfer}} and pressure drop characteristics {{of water in}} tape generated swirl flow were investigated. The test sections were electrically heated small diameter nickel tubes with tight fitting full length Inconel tapes of twist ratios from 2. 48 to 9. 2 inside diameters/ 180 of tape twist. Heat transfer coefficients and friction factors were determined for non-boiling forced convection heating and cooling while overall pressure drop information and curves of heat flux versus wall superheat were determined for surface boiling conditions. Improvements in {{heat transfer}} for equal flow rates of up to 851 c were observed for the non-boiling swirl flows with heating, but the improvement with cooling was substantially less. Compared {{on the basis of}} equal pumping power, improvements in heat transfer of up to 351 c were observed for the tighter tape twists. A method for predicting the heat transfer coefficient for non-boiling swirl flows was developed. It was based upon the theory that the improvement was due primarily to: 1) the increased flow path created by the tape, 2) the increased circulation created with heating due to the buoyancy effect set up by the large centrifugal force present, and 3) the fin effect of the tape. The experimental results of this and previous swirl flow investigations were in good agreement with the analytical prediction. The surface boiling characteristics of swirl flow were found to be similar to those observed in <b>straight</b> <b>flow.</b> The boiling curves for various velocities were asymptotic to a fully developed line at high wall superheats, and the visually observed point of incipient boiling and the transition to the fully developed boiling asymptote were predictable by conventional <b>straight</b> <b>flow</b> methods. It was concluded, therefore, that the dominant surface boiling heat transfer mechanism was similar for both swirl and <b>straight</b> <b>flow.</b> (cont.) For non-boiling swirl flows, the decrease in the pressure drop with heating was slightly less than is usual with straight flows, while the increase in the pressure drop with surface boiling was substantially less.
