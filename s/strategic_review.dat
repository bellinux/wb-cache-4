These range in size from regional airports to the smallest farm strip, although 84 per cent of GA flights operate from 134 of the larger aerodromes in the first four categories.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The paper {{explores the}} {{involvement}} of top management in <b>strategic</b> <b>reviews</b> of the organization’s operational activities (known as top executive audits or TEAs).

TEAs are also crucial to hoshin kanri and facilitate operational effectiveness. Originality/value – The paper suggests that <b>strategic</b> <b>reviews,</b> such as TEAs, are best operated when integrated together as an organization-wide managed system of review.
