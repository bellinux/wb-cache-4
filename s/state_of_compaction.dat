50|$|Traditionally, {{cancer has}} been viewed as a genetic disease that is driven by {{sequential}} acquisition of mutations, leading to the constitutive activation of proto-oncogenes {{and the loss of}} function of tumor suppressor genes. However, it has become increasingly evident that tumor development also involves epigenetic changes. These epigenetic changes include both genome-wide losses and regional gains of DNA methylation, as well as altered patterns of histone modification. The <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> of the chromatin fiber governs DNA accessibility and therefore has a crucial function establishing, maintaining, and propagating distinct patterns of gene expression. Perturbations of chromatin structure can cause inappropriate gene expression and genomic instability, resulting in cellular transformation and malignant outgrowth. Polycomb group proteins (PcG) function as transcriptional repressors that silence specific sets of genes through chromatin modification. Although they are primarily known for their role in maintaining cell identity during the establishment of the body plan, several mammalian PcG members are implicated in the control of cellular proliferation and neoplastic development.|$|E

40|$|Chromatin looping {{is a major}} {{epigenetic}} {{regulatory mechanism}} in higher eukaryotes. Besides its role in transcriptional regulation, chromatin loops have been proposed to play {{a pivotal role in}} the segregation of entire chromosomes. The detailed topological and entropic forces between loops still remain elusive. Here, we quantitatively determine the potential of mean force between the centers of mass of two ring polymers, i. e. loops. We find that the transition from a linear to a ring polymer induces a strong increase in the entropic repulsion between these two polymers. On top, topological interactions such as the non-catenation constraint further reduce the number of accessible conformations of close-by ring polymers by about 50 %, resulting in an additional effective repulsion. Furthermore, the transition from linear to ring polymers displays changes in the conformational and structural properties of the system. In fact, ring polymers adopt a markedly more ordered and aligned state than linear ones. The forces and accompanying changes in shape and alignment between ring polymers suggest an important regulatory function of such a topology in biopolymers. We conjecture that dynamic loop formation in chromatin might act as a versatile control mechanism regulating and maintaining different local <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> and order.

In the chromatin compartment dedicated protein complexes govern the accurate synthesis and repair of the genomic information and define the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> DNA <b>compaction</b> in vital cellular processes such as chromosome segregation or transcription. Unscheduled or faulty association of proteins with DNA has detrimental consequences on genome integrity. Consequently, the organization of chromatin-bound protein complexes is remarkably dynamic and can respond rapidly to cellular signaling events, which requires tight spatiotemporal control. In this context, the ring-like AAA+ ATPase CDC 48 /p 97 emerges as a key regulator of protein complexes that are marked with ubiquitin or SUMO. Mechanistically, CDC 48 /p 97 functions as a segregase facilitating the extraction of substrate proteins from the chromatin. As such, CDC 48 /p 97 drives molecular reactions either by directed disassembly or rearrangement of chromatin-bound protein complexes. The importance of this mechanism is reflected by human pathologies linked to p 97 mutations, including neurodegenerative disorders, oncogenesis, and premature aging.

40|$|International audienceVarious {{mechanisms}} {{can affect}} the permeability of dense unconsolidated sands: Volumetric dilation can lead to permeability increase, whereas strain localization in shear bands may increase or decrease the permeability depending on the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> and {{on the level of}} grains breakage inside the band. To investigate these various mechanisms, an experimental study has been performed to explore the effect of different factors such as grain size and grain shape, confining pressure, level of shear, stress path, and formation of one or several shear bands on the permeability of dense sands under triaxial loading. The experimental results show a reduction of permeability during the consolidation phase and during the volumetric contraction phase of shear loading, which can be related to the decrease of porosity. The experimental results also show that, depending on the confining pressure, the permeability remains stable or decreases during the volumetric dilation phase despite the increase of total porosity. This permeability reduction is attributed to the presence of fine particles, which result from grains attrition during pre-localization and grains breakage inside the shear band during the post-localization phase...|$|E

Avaliaram-se a densidade, a porosidade, a umidade volumétrica e a resistência à penetração do solo. Nas plantas, avaliaram-se a distribuição do sistema radicular e a produtividade. A densidade crítica obtida pelo IHO foi de 1, 75 Mg m- 3.

O sistema radicular concentrou-se superficialmente no PDc com melhor distribuição e desenvolvimento no PD e Esc.

40|$|The {{soil water}} {{retention}} (SWR) {{characteristics of the}} clays {{play an important role}} in controlling their engineering behaviour, particularly, in the unsaturated state. Although, researchers have attempted to understand the water retention characteristics of the clays in their reconstituted or remoulded state, such studies are rare for the clays in their intact state. In this context, it becomes important to understand the influence of initial <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction,</b> which would create different pore- and fabric- structure (viz., microstructure), on the water retention characteristics of the clays. With this in view, SWR behaviour was determined experimentally for the swelling clays (dried from different compaction states, viz., intact, reconstituted and remoulded) by employing Dewpoint Potentiameter (WP 4 C®). The changes in the pore-size distribution of the clays at different stages of drying cycle were also studied by employing the Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry. The study reveals that the SWR curves for the intact and reconstituted specimens of the clays converge beyond a certain stage of drying. Also, a critical analysis of changes in the pore structure of the swelling clay specimens, during drying, indicates that the progressively deforming pore structure {{play an important role in}} controlling its water retention characteristics to a great extent...|$|E
30|$|Development of {{structure}} {{results in the}} formation of pore spaces between aggregates, resulting in an increase in the porosity and a decrease in the bulk density (Foth 1990). Since structural development tends to be greatest in the surface soil, it is at this level in the profile that porosity is usually the greatest and bulk density the lowest (Hausenbuiller 1985). Lower porosities and higher bulk densities in the subsoil are usually associated with a relatively low degree of structural development and a higher <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> due to the weight of the overlying soil (Foth 1990). The trend of gradual decrease of soil porosity of the unaltered farmland with increasing soil depth observed in this study was consistent with the above references (Foth 1990; Hausenbuiller 1985). As for the reclaimed farmland, the soil porosities presented a trend of first decrease and then increase. The reason may be that the soil bulk density of the substratum (50 – 80  cm) was lower than that of the subsoil layer (20 – 50  cm), while the particle density of the substratum (50 – 80  cm) was higher than that of the subsoil layer (20 – 50  cm), resulting in the soil porosity of the substratum (50 – 80  cm) was higher than that of the subsoil layer (20 – 50  cm).|$|E

The solid content ranges from 24 to 28 % by volume, as controlled by compaction. Both viscous and elastic characters are largely governed by the solid part of the compact. The elastic character stems from the stiffness of the silica, while the viscous character stems from the interparticle movement. The elastic character of the solid part (the storage modulus and solid content) is essentially independent of the degree <b>of</b> <b>compaction,</b> indicating validity <b>of</b> the rule of mixtures. The viscous character of the solid part (the loss tangent and solid content) decreases with increasing degree <b>of</b> <b>compaction,</b> indicating decreasing ease of interparticle movement as the degree <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> increases.

30|$|This study modeled the {{compressive}} strength and elastic modulus of hardened cement {{that had been}} treated with an expansive additive to reduce shrinkage, {{in order to determine}} the mechanical properties of the material. In hardened cement paste with an expansive additive, hydrates are generated as a result of the hydration between the cement and expansive additive. These hydrates then fill up the pores in the hardened cement. Consequently, a dense, compact structure is formed through the contact between the particles of the expansive additive and the cement, which leads to the manifestation of the strength and elastic modulus. Hence, in this study, the {{compressive strength}} and elastic modulus were modeled based on the concept of the mutual contact area of the particles, taking into consideration the extent of the cohesion between particles and the structure formation by the particles. The compressive strength of the material was modeled by considering the relationship between the porosity and the distributional probability of the weakest points, i.e., points that could lead to fracture, in the continuum. The approach used for modeling the elastic modulus considered the pore structure between the particles, which are responsible for transmitting the tensile force, along with the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> of the hydration products, as described by the coefficient of the effective radius. The results of an experimental verification of the model showed that the values predicted by the model correlated closely with the experimental values.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Construction and {{development}} of cities imposes profound modifications on the environment, such as: destruction of forests, reduction of water infiltration, increase of the pluvial water concentration, pollution, etc. These impacts are more intense and serious in developing countries, because the construction/development is made, normally, without planning and considering {{the limitations of the}} environment. Around the cities the problems are more serious because the urban infrastructure is deficient, and this causes the expansion of problems into other areas of the hydrographic basin. The occupation of upstream catchment areas of cities, without adequate planning causes serious problems for the city, such as erosion, siltation, flooding etc. An important factor to be considered is the change in the natural condition of compaction of the soil that, as a consequence, can change infiltration and runoff rates, which may result in more erosion, flooding and siltation. In this paper an efficient, fast and innovative method is presented to evaluate the degree of compaction of soils using a TDR probe connected to a penetrometer for soil assessment. It is known that the resistance to penetration depends on the physical characteristics of the ground, to its <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> and its moisture content.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} an experimental and modelling approach for the soil-water retention behaviour of two deformable soils. The {{objective is to}} investigate the physical mechanisms that govern the soil-water retention properties and to propose a constitutive framework for the soil-water retention curve accounting for the initial <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> and deformability of soils. A granular soil and a clayey soil were subjected to drying {{over a wide range}} of suctions so that the residual state of saturation could be attained. Different initial densities were tested for each material. The soil-water retention curves (SWRCs) obtained are synthesized and compared in terms of water content, void ratio, and degree of saturation, and are expressed {{as a function of the}} total suction. The studies enable assessment of the effect of the past and present soil deformation on the shape of the curves. The void ratio exerts a clear influence on the air-entry value, revealing that the breakthrough of air into the pores of the soil is more arduous in denser states. In the plane of water content versus suction, the experimental results highlight the fact that from a certain value of suction, the retention curves corresponding to different densities of the same soil are convergent. The observed features of behaviour are conceptualized into a modelling framework expressing the evolution of the degree of saturation as a function of suction. The proposed retention model makes use of the theory of elastoplasticity and can thus be generalized into a hysteretic model applicable to drying-wetting cycles. The calibration of the model requires the experimental retention data for two initial void ratios. The prediction of tests for further ranges of void ratios proves to be accurate, which supports the adequacy of formulated concepts...|$|E

However, recently, some researchers have been using other methods <b>of</b> <b>compaction,</b> such as static compaction, specifically for studying the unsaturated behavior of pavement materials. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> techniques on resilient behavior of compacted laboratory specimens. Studies show that the resilient behavior of unsaturated compacted road pavement materials is influenced by suction. In this regard, two types of recycled Construction and Demolition (C&D) material were selected and static and impact compaction methods were utilized for sample preparation. Further, accuracy of four predictive resilient modulus models with or without incorporation of suction was investigated. Test results show the impact <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> method on particle breakage, matric suction and accordingly resilient behavior of C&D granular material...|$|R

ABSTRACT: Properties of soils provide far more information than typically used in construction quality control. The aim {{of this paper is}} to present mathematical evidence of the relation between soil properties such as porosity, soil interlock and bearing capacity and to demonstrate it's applicability in pavement layer construction control. Basic soil parameters are presented, and their interrelationships, whereafter these parameters are combined in mathematical relationships and their application in quality control demonstrated. The determination and use of the soil parameters; porosity and degree of interlock is suggested as a more pragmatic means of assessment <b>of</b> a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> soil <b>compaction</b> than the more traditional Relative <b>Compaction</b> <b>of</b> a so called maximum laboratory density. Soil groups may be related to porosity at maximum density which can be mathematically calculated from a single "one-shot" density test. Strength in the form of a possible minimum CBR of a soil at different moisture contents and density is shown to be mathematically assessable.
