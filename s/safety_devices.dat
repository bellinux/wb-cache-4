5|$|Following the Palomares and Thule accidents—the only {{cases where}} the {{conventional}} explosives of U.S. nuclear bombs accidentally detonated and dispersed nuclear materials—investigators concluded the high explosive (HE) used in nuclear weapons was not chemically stable enough to withstand the forces involved in an aircraft accident. They also determined that the electrical circuits of the weapons' <b>safety</b> <b>devices</b> became unreliable in a fire and allowed connections to short circuit. The findings triggered research by scientists in the United States into safer conventional explosives and fireproof casings for nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|Ambulances, {{like other}} {{emergency}} vehicles, {{are required to}} operate in all weather conditions, including those during which civilian drivers often elect {{to stay off the}} road. Also, the ambulance crew's responsibilities to their patient often preclude their use of <b>safety</b> <b>devices</b> such as seat belts. Research has shown that ambulances {{are more likely to be}} involved in motor vehicle collisions resulting in injury or death than either fire trucks or police cars. Unrestrained occupants, particularly those riding in the patient-care compartment, are particularly vulnerable. When compared to civilian vehicles of similar size, one study found that on a per-accident basis, ambulance collisions tend to involve more people, and result in more injuries. An 11-year retrospective study concluded in 2001 found that although most fatal ambulance crashes occurred during emergency runs, they typically occurred on improved, straight, dry roads, during clear weather. Furthermore, paramedics are also at risk in ambulances while helping patients, as 27 paramedics died during ambulance trips in the US between 1991 and 2006.|$|E
5|$|The Guardian Legend is a 1988 hybrid action-adventure/shoot 'em up {{video game}} {{developed}} by Compile for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). It is {{the sequel to}} the 1986 MSX game Guardic, and was published and released in Japan by Irem in 1988, in North America by Brøderbund in 1989, and in Europe by Nintendo in 1990. In the game, the player controls a lone protagonist, the Guardian, who is on a quest to destroy a large alien-infested world named Naju before it reaches the planet Earth. The player must deactivate ten <b>safety</b> <b>devices</b> scattered throughout Naju, thus activating the alien world's self-destruct sequence. The player explores Naju in a non-linear fashion and can acquire different weapons {{during the course of}} the game.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{monitoring}} system used in marine sink-float <b>safety</b> <b>device</b> is introduced. The ARM Cortex-M 3 {{is the core}} of microcontroller in this system, and the hardware and software architectures of the {{monitoring system}} are designed. The designed monitoring system can multi-point monitor marine environment around sink-float <b>safety</b> <b>device,</b> by doing this, the <b>safety</b> <b>device</b> can take marine equipment to escape from harsh marine environment by submerging a certain depth. So we can make sure marine equipment safe and normal. The experimental results show that the sink-float <b>safety</b> <b>device</b> can work normally in the harsh marine environment with the monitoring system. The acquisition of multi-point environment monitor as well as data management is achieved effectively. The reliability and safety of equipment are guaranteed by the sink-float <b>safety</b> <b>device...</b>|$|R

25|$|Costs in {{the sport}} are not trivial. As new {{technological}} advances or performance enhancements are introduced, equipment tends to increase in price.

25|$|Mask or goggles: Masks are <b>safety</b> <b>devices</b> {{players are}} {{required}} to wear at all times on the field, {{to protect them from}} paintballs. The original equipment used by players were safety goggles of the type used in labs and wood shops; today's goggles are derived from skiing/snowboarding goggles, with an attached shell that completely covers the eyes, mouth, ears and nostrils of the wearer. Masks can also feature throat guards. Modern masks have developed to be less bulky compared with older designs. Some players may remove the mouth and/or ear protection for aesthetic or comfort reasons, but this is neither recommended nor often allowed at commercial venues.|$|E
25|$|This {{point of}} view argues that {{management}} (and to some extent, local government) underinvested in safety, which allowed for a dangerous working environment to develop. Factors cited include the filling of the MIC tanks beyond recommended levels, poor maintenance after the plant ceased MIC production {{at the end of}} 1984, allowing several safety systems to be inoperable due to poor maintenance, and switching off safety systems to save money— including the MIC tank refrigeration system which could have mitigated the disaster severity, and non-existent catastrophe management plans. Other factors identified by government inquiries included undersized <b>safety</b> <b>devices</b> and the dependence on manual operations. Specific plant management deficiencies that were identified include the lack of skilled operators, reduction of safety management, insufficient maintenance, and inadequate emergency action plans.|$|E

25|$|When rodeo riders invaded Hollywood, {{they brought}} {{a battery of}} rodeo {{techniques}} that Canutt would expand and improve, including horse falls and wagon wrecks, along with the harnesses and cable rigs to make the stunts foolproof and safe. Among the new <b>safety</b> <b>devices</b> was the 'L' stirrup, which allowed a man to fall off a horse without getting hung in the stirrup. Canutt also developed cabling and equipment to cause spectacular wagon crashes, while releasing the team, {{all on the same}} spot every time. Safety methods such as these saved film-makers time and money and prevented accidents and injury to performers. One of Yakima's inventions was the 'Running W' stunt, bringing down a horse at the gallop by attaching a wire, anchored to the ground, to its fetlocks and launching the rider forwards spectacularly. This either killed the horse, or rendered it badly shaken and unusable {{for the rest of the}} day. The 'Running W' is now banned and has been replaced with the falling-horse technique. It is believed that the last time it was used was on the 1983 Iraqi film al-Mas' Ala Al-Kubra when British actor and friend of Yak Marc Sinden and stuntman Ken Buckle (who had been trained by Yak) performed the stunt three times during a cavalry charge sequence.|$|E
