5|$|<b>Stud</b> <b>fees</b> for stallions that enter {{breeding}} {{can range}} from $2,500 to $500,000 per mare in the United States, and from ₤2000 to £75,000 or more in Britain. The record stud fee to date was set in the 1980s, when the stud fee of the late Northern Dancer reached $1 million. During the 2008 Australian breeding season seven stallions stood at a stud fee of A$110,000 or more, with the highest fee in the nation at A$302,500.|$|E
25|$|The highest <b>stud</b> <b>fees</b> are {{generally}} for racing Thoroughbreds, which may charge {{from two to}} three thousand dollars for a breeding to a new or unproven stallion, to {{several hundred thousand dollars}} for a breeding to a proven producer of stakes winners. Stallions in other disciplines often have <b>stud</b> <b>fees</b> that begin in the range of $1,000 to $3,000, with top contenders who produce champions in certain disciplines able to command as much as $20,000 for one breeding. The lowest <b>stud</b> <b>fees</b> to breed to a grade horse or an animal of low-quality pedigree may only be $100–$200, but there are trade-offs: the horse will probably be unproven, and likely to produce lower-quality offspring than a horse with a stud fee that is in the typical range for quality breeding stock.|$|E
25|$|<b>Stud</b> <b>fees</b> are {{determined}} by the quality of the stallion, his performance record, the performance record of his get (offspring), as well as the sport and general market that the animal is standing for.|$|E
50|$|In the 2008 {{breeding}} season, Eddington's <b>stud</b> <b>fee</b> was $20,000. In October 2008, Claiborne Farm {{announced it}} would drop his <b>stud</b> <b>fee</b> to $15,000 for the 2009 breeding season. For the 2010 breeding season, Eddington's <b>stud</b> <b>fee</b> was halved to $7500.|$|R
25|$|As a stallion's career, either {{performance}} or breeding, improves, his <b>stud</b> <b>fee</b> tends {{to increase in}} proportion. If one or two offspring are especially successful, winning several stakes races or an Olympic medal, the <b>stud</b> <b>fee</b> will generally greatly increase. Younger, unproven stallions will generally have a lower <b>stud</b> <b>fee</b> earlier on in their careers.|$|R
5000|$|Eskendereya entered stud in 2011 at Taylor Made Stallions in Nicholasville, Kentucky. His {{starting}} <b>stud</b> <b>fee</b> was $30,000 live foal. In 2013 his <b>stud</b> <b>fee</b> {{was lowered}} to $17,500.|$|R
25|$|Archer was {{retired to}} stud at {{a fee of}} 10 guineas per mare (one of the highest <b>stud</b> <b>fees</b> of the time), but his progeny did not win a stakes race. He {{remained}} at Exeter Farm until his death at age 16 on 22 December 1872. He had wandered into a field of green barley, the consumption of which gave him a fatal inflammation of the lungs. Archer's jockey, John Cutts, had died three months earlier in September 1872.|$|E
25|$|Mick died on 6 May 1939, a {{few weeks}} short of his thirteenth birthday, having amassed around £20,000 in <b>stud</b> <b>fees,</b> from {{appearances}} in films, and in prize money. After his death he was stuffed and given by his last owner, A.H. Kempton, to the Natural History Museum in London; he has since been moved to the Natural History Museum at Tring in Hertfordshire where he is still on public view. He stands in cabinet 58 of the household dogs section at the museum in an airtight case filled with an insecticide called Vapona {{in order to prevent}} any damage by insects.|$|E
25|$|In rural areas, fights {{are often}} staged in barns or outdoor pits; in urban areas, fights may occur in garages, basements, warehouses, {{abandoned}} buildings, back alleys, neighborhood playgrounds, {{or in the}} streets. Dog fights usually last until one dog is declared a winner, which occurs when one dog fails to scratch, one dog dies, or one dog {{jumps out of the}} pit. The loser, if not killed in the fight, is typically killed by the owner through a gun, beatings, or torture, in fights run by criminal gangs in the U.S. However, sometimes dog fights end without declaring a winner. For instance, the dog's owner may call the fight. Dog fighting generates revenue from <b>stud</b> <b>fees,</b> admission fees and gambling. It is also a felony in all 50 U.S. states as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. In addition, the federal U.S. Animal Welfare Act makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly sell, buy, possess, train, transport, deliver, or receive any dog for purposes of having the dog participate in an animal fighting venture. The act also makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly use the mail service of the United States Postal Service or any instrumentality of interstate commerce for commercial speech for purposes of advertising a dog for use in an animal fighting venture, promoting or in any other manner furthering an animal fighting venture except as performed outside the limits of the States of the United States. Worldwide, several countries have banned dog fighting, but it is still legal in some countries like Japan, Honduras, and parts of Russia.|$|E

500|$|After {{finishing}} {{fifth in}} his track debut as a two-year-old, American Pharoah won his next two races, the Grade I Del Mar Futurity and FrontRunner Stakes, each by several lengths. An injury {{kept him out}} of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, but the strength of his two wins nonetheless resulted in his being voted American Champion Two-Year-Old Male Horse at the 2014 Eclipse Awards. [...] Before the 2015 season began, Zayat had sold breeding rights to the colt to the Ashford Stud, a division of Ireland's Coolmore Stud. He retained control over the colt and his racing career, as well as an undisclosed dividend on <b>stud</b> <b>fees.</b>|$|E
500|$|All {{cases were}} {{resolved}} with a settlement agreement in July 2010, {{seven months after}} the initial suit was filed. Zayat agreed to pay off his unsecured creditors over two years, without interest, and pay off Fifth Third by 2014. Zayat Stables' creditors unanimously approved the repayment plan. Zayat owed about $2.4 million to the Keeneland Association, and $1.2 million to other creditors including clinics, horse transport companies, boarding farms, and trainers—among them Bob Baffert. [...] He also owed several horse breeders for <b>stud</b> <b>fees.</b> [...] To settle his debts with Fifth Third, he agreed to annual payments based on a percentage of horse sales and proceeds from claiming races. As part of his reorganization plan, he was to sell a number of horses, including 100% of his Grade I-winning horse Eskendereya. Ultimately, consistent with Zayat's tendency to retain a financial interest in his stallions, he sold an undisclosed share in the stallion to Jess Jackson and retained some breeding rights. While the selling percentage and price were confidential, Zayat Stables' reported income to the bankruptcy court for the month the deal closed was $7.5 million. Zayat stated, [...] "While Chapter 11 was a necessary step to take ... I look forward to carrying out our reorganization plan, and continuing to develop {{some of the best}} horses in the country." [...] Zayat Stables successfully completed the bankruptcy reorganization plan, in the process his stable went from a high of 285 horses to a census of 118 in 2012.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, Ferguson {{launched}} {{legal action}} against the then major United shareholder John Magnier over stud rights for race horse Rock of Gibraltar. Magnier counter-sued Ferguson by filing a [...] "Motion to Comply" [...] requiring Ferguson to substantiate his claim for half of Rock of Gibraltar's <b>stud</b> <b>fees.</b> The legal issues were further compounded by the request for [...] "99 Questions" [...] to be answered over Ferguson's transfer dealings, including those of Jaap Stam, Juan Sebastián Verón, Tim Howard, David Bellion, Cristiano Ronaldo and Kléberson. The case was eventually settled out of Court.|$|E

2500|$|Professional fighters breed {{generations of}} skilled [...] "game dogs" [...] {{and take a}} great pride in their dogs' lineage. These fighters make a {{tremendous}} amount of money charging <b>stud</b> <b>fees</b> to breed their champions, in addition to the fees and winnings they collect for fighting them. They also tend to own a large number of dogs—sometimes 50 or more. Professionals also use trade journals, such as Your Friend and Mine, Game Dog Times, The American Warrior, and The Pit Bull Chronicle, to discuss recent fights and to advertise the sale of training equipment and puppies. Some fighters operate on a national or even international level within highly secret networks. When a dog is not successful in a fight, a professional may dispose of it using a variety of techniques such as drowning, strangulation, hanging, gunshot, electrocution or some other method. Sometimes professionals and hobbyists dispose of dogs deemed aggressive to humans to street fighters.|$|E

50|$|The pattern system exerts a huge {{influence}} on the bloodstock market, particularly {{in relation to the}} stud fee that a stallion can command for covering a mare at stud. This will be dictated almost entirely by the stallion's performances in Pattern races during its racing career. Only the very best horses can perform successfully in Group 1 events and such animals invariably command the highest <b>stud</b> <b>fees</b> when their racing career is at an end. A top-quality stallion can be enormously lucrative for its owners - <b>stud</b> <b>fees</b> of more than US$100,000 are relatively commonplace for the most coveted stallions.|$|E
5000|$|Sometime {{after his}} last race, he was retired. He stood {{his first season}} of stud duty at Pauls Mill Farm in Versailles, Kentucky, with a <b>stud</b> <b>fee</b> set at a fee of $10,000. In 2015, I Want Revenge was moved to stand stud at Millennium Farms in Lexington, where his <b>stud</b> <b>fee</b> was dropped down to $5,000.|$|R
50|$|Bay Ronald first {{stood at}} Preston Farm in 1899. Due to his rather unimpressive record, his <b>stud</b> <b>fee</b> {{for the first}} season was 25 guineas, and free to mares who had already {{produced}} winners. During his time at stud in England, he bred few mares—less than 20 each year—and they were generally of poor quality. Later, his <b>stud</b> <b>fee</b> would reach 100 guineas.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes the {{breeding}} contract will specify {{how many times}} the live foal guarantee may be used. If it doesn't, a 'reasonable number' is assumed. Typically, after 3 unsuccessful tries, the stallion owner will either require substitution of another mare, or will return the <b>stud</b> <b>fee.</b> Or the contract may allow the stallion owner to simply keep the <b>stud</b> <b>fee</b> after this many tries.|$|R
50|$|<b>Stud</b> <b>fees</b> are {{determined}} by the quality of the stallion, his performance record, the performance record of his get (offspring), as well as the sport and general market that the animal is standing for.|$|E
