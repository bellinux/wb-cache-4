40|$|In the future, {{it would}} be {{preferable}} to replace the halocarbon refrigerants with natural refrigerants like carbon dioxide, {{but there have been}} concerns over the use of carbon dioxide as a refrigerant due to its perceived inefficiency. It is possible to partially overcome this problem by the manipulation of the cylinders of the compressors used in the vapor compression refrigeration cycle. If some of the cylinders are used to compress vapor in a parallel compression system from an intermediary pressure, a refrigerating effect and COP greater than that of the system with all of the cylinders on suction can be achieved. An analytic model was created that allowed environmental and physical parameters to be altered. The investigations also included experimentation with the addition of superheat for the primary compression path, for which performance increases were noted for some operating conditions. The primary focus of the research was for the use of carbon dioxide in a standard air conditioning application. Accordingly, evaporation and condensation pressures were selected to correspond closely with evaporation and condensation temperatures for other refrigerants. Under the conditions used for the following research, superheating did not improve efficiency, and was not included. Physical limitations placed on the ratio of the <b>suction</b> <b>cylinder</b> swept volume to the economized cylinder swept volume suggest that building this economized compressor would be feasible. In fact, a standard reciprocating compressor could be altered such that 2 to 4 cylinders, depending on the volumetric ratio, are used for the economized path. The research demonstrates that under some conditions an economized carbon dioxide system outperforms a similar halocarbon system in terms of efficiency and capacity. In the end, this is the litmus test that proves that carbon dioxide can compete on the level with popular halocarbon refrigerants in this economized mode. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Reciprocating {{compressors}} are flexible {{to handle}} wide capacity and condition swings, offer a very efficient method of compressing almost any gas mixture in {{wide range of}} pressure, can generate high head independent of density, and have numerous applications and wide power ratings.

40|$|In this study, {{calculations}} {{of the mechanical}} efficiency of a large reciprocating compressor, developed by Mayekawa MFG. Co., Ltd., with a per <b>cylinder</b> <b>suction</b> volume of 1300 cm 3 were carried out. These calculations were used to confirm whether the empirical combination of major design parameters in the Mayekawa compressor delivers optimal mechanical efficiency. Initially, the theoretical equation of motion of the rotating crankshaft is developed. Subsequently, computer calculations are carried out to determine the mechanical efficiency for various combinations of the major design parameters for operating speeds of 800, 1000 and 1200 rpm. From these calculations, the optimal combination parameters yielding the maximum mechanical efficiency could be determined, and then compared with the empirical combination used in the Mayekawa compressor...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} presents techniques {{developed for}} non-intrusive sensing and fault detection in reciprocating compressors driven by induction motors. These procedures are “non-intrusive” because they rely only on {{voltage and current}} signals measured on the compressor power cable. The electrical sensor based method allows for easy and non-intrusive determination of many fault sensitive signals that usually require complicated, expensive, and time consuming operations to measure. The electric signals are processed and used with the inverted dynamic motor model equations and motor parameters (which are also determined non-intrusively) to recover the instantaneous angular speed of the compressor shaft, {{as well as the}} torque of electromagnetic origin provided by the motor. These two intermediate signals and compressor parameters such as crank shaft inertia are then used to solve for the compressor load torque. This load torque signal has high fault diagnostic value because it is composed of pressure and friction torques, and these signals are close to mechanical phenomena of diagnostic interest in the compressor. All these signals are recovered at a fine resolution giving high level of detail on a sub-shaft revolution basis. The use of the load torque signal in determining faults and additional diagnostic information is also given. A procedure for determining the <b>cylinder</b> <b>suction</b> and discharge pressure from the load torque signal and knowable cylinder parameters such as cylinder volume, crank arm length, and gas coefficients is discussed. The load torque signal is also useful directly: for the two piston machine used in the research, symmetry of the twice per rotation peak of the load torque is a valuable diagnostic measure. Reed valve leakage faults were investigated by drilling small holes of varying sizes in one <b>cylinder’s</b> <b>suction</b> reed. The asymmetry in each cylinder’s pressure torque peak increases with increasing leak size, providing both an indication and measure of leakage severity...|$|R
50|$|The graph above {{shows the}} intake runner {{pressure}} over 720 crank degrees of an engine with a 7 in intake port/runner running at 4500 rpm, which is its torque peak (close to maximum cylinder filling and BMEP for this engine). The two pressure traces {{are taken from}} the valve end (blue) and the runner entrance (red). The blue line rises sharply as the intake valve closes. This causes a pile up of air, which becomes a positive wave reflected back up the runner and the red line shows that wave arriving at the runner entrance later. Note how the <b>suction</b> wave during <b>cylinder</b> filling is delayed even more by having to fight upstream against the inrushing air {{and the fact that}} the piston is further down the bore, increasing the distance.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The present {{investigation}} reports mechanical properties of novel multicomponent TixCuyFe 20 Co 20 Ni 20 high entropy alloys (HEAs) with different alloy chemistry (x/y = 1 / 3, 3 / 7, 3 / 5, 9 / 11, 1, 11 / 9 and 3 / 2). The alloy cylinders were prepared by vacuum arc melting-cum-suction casting route. The detailed electron microscopic observations reveal {{the presence of}} three different solid solution phases; FCC (α 1) phase, FCC (α 2) phase and BCC (β) phase for all the investigated alloys, whereas ultrafine eutectic between FCC (α 1) phase, and Ti 2 (Co, Ni) - type Laves phase has been observed for the HEAs with x/y = 9 / 11, 1, 11 / 9 and 3 / 2. Room temperature compression test of the <b>suction</b> cast <b>cylinders</b> with aspect ratio of 2 / 1 has been conducted to obtain mechanical properties of the HEAs. The optimum combination of strength (∼ 1. 88 GPa) and plasticity (∼ 21 %) is obtained for x/y = 9 / 11; indicating simultaneous improvement of strength as well as plasticity of the novel HEAs. Fractographic analysis of the fractured surfaces reveals mixed mode of fracture for x/y = 1 / 3, 3 / 7 and 3 / 5, ductile mode for x/y = 9 / 11 and 1, whereas brittle mode of fracture for x/y = 11 / 9 and 3 / 2...|$|R
40|$|A variational {{technique}} {{is used to}} derive analytical expressions for the sensitivity of recirculation length to steady forcing in separated flows. Linear sensitivity analysis {{is applied to the}} two-dimensional steady flow past a circular cylinder for Reynolds numbers 40 ≤ Re ≤ 120, both in the subcritical and supercritical regimes. Regions which are the most sensitive to volume forcing and wall blowing/suction are identified. Control configurations which reduce the recirculation length are designed based on the sensitivity information, in particular small cylinders used as control devices {{in the wake of the}} main <b>cylinder,</b> and fluid <b>suction</b> at the <b>cylinder</b> wall. Validation against full non-linear Navier-Stokes calculations shows excellent agreement for small-amplitude control. The linear stability properties of the controlled flow are systematically investigated. At moderate Reynolds numbers, we observe that regions where control reduces the recirculation length correspond to regions where it has a stabilising effect on the most unstable global mode associated to vortex shedding, while this property does not hold any more at larger Reynolds numbers.

40|$|The heat {{transport}} phenomenon in a hermetic reciprocating compressor is {{addressed in this}} work. This is far from straightforward. It involves several transient physical phenomena interacting to each other. The heat is exchanged between the refrigerant fluid and the solid parts of the compressor (<b>suction</b> muffler, <b>cylinder</b> head, crankcase, etc.). At the same time, the solid parts exchange heat to each other by means of conduction and radiation. Moreover, the phenomenon happens in non-symmetrical complex geometries and the solid parts are made of different materials. This is interesting from both the software engineering and the compressor design viewpoint. A parallel object-oriented software platform for the resolution of multiphysics problems is employed. This platform allows the use of partitioned strategies so that the compressor {{heat transport}} problem -a global problem- {{can be divided into}} several smaller parts -local problems-. This makes possible the use of multilevel modeling strategies for thermal systems analysis. Furthermore, in order to couple the several sub-problems in an integrated simulation, the platform provides data transfer tools -for matching and non-matching meshes- to exchange sub-domain state information. In particular, the work provides detailed information on the heat distribution and the temperature of the components of a test compressor. By means of comparative studies the thermal properties of some of its components are analyzed. This highlights the importance of choosing proper materials. For example, different suction muffler materials are tested to investigate their influence on the volumetric efficiency. Since the whole compressor is simulated, the consequences of altering specific component properties are also appreciated on the other components. In sum, the work presents illustrative numerical results of the three-dimensional heat transfer in a compressor that show the potential use of computer simulation to support design of components to attain feasibility and energy efficiency.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a set of}} techniques for non-intrusive sensing and fault detection in reciprocating compressors driven by induction motors. The procedures developed here are "non-intrusive" because they rely only on electrical measurements to reconstruct the mechanical signals internal to the compressor. This allows for easy and non-intrusive determination of many fault sensitive signals that usually require complicated, expensive, and time consuming operations to measure. A sample of the signals produced by the procedures of this thesis are estimates of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>suction</b> and discharge pressures and a composite torque signal containing {{the effects of the}} mechanical loads within the compressor. This load torque signal is especially sensitive to faults, and a demonstration of the effect on and detection of compressor valve faults from the load torque signal is given. One of the key steps in the algorithm presented here is a procedure to "invert" the induction motor dynamic model equations to allow direct calculation of motor shaft speed and torque from stator current and voltage measurements. For this procedure a non-intrusive method to estimate motor model parameters from an in-situ induction motor driving a periodic load was developed. by Christopher James Schantz. Thesis (S. M.)
