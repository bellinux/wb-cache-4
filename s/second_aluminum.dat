The gallium aryloxide polymer reacts with pyridines, via both a solution and a solid/vapor reaction, to yield the yellow compound [(tBu) 2 Ga(L) ] 2 (mu-OC 6 H 4 O) [L = pyridine, 4 -Mepy, and 3, 5 -Me 2 py] via cleavage of the Ga 2 O 2 dimeric core. The thermolysis in the solid state {{results in the}} loss of the Lewis base and the formation of [{(tBu) 2 Ga} 2 (mu-OC 6 H 4 O) ]n. The DeltaH‡ and DeltaS‡ for the solid/vapor reactions have been determined. The inter-conversion of polymer to the pyridine complexes, and the reverse reactions, have been followed by 13 C CPMAS NMR spectroscopy, TG/DTA, SEM, EDX, and powder XRD. Insight into the solid state mechanism of this polycondensation polymerization reaction may be gained from the single crystal X-ray crystallographic packing diagrams of the pyridine complexes. The aluminum aryloxide polymer reacts with Lewis bases to yield the compound [(tBu) 2 Al) L) ] 2 ([mu-OC 6 H 4 O) [L = py, 3, 5 -Me 2 py, and THF] via cleavage of the Al 2 O 2 dimeric core. Unlike their gallium-pyridine analogs, these compounds do not undergo a clean dissociation to [{(tBu) 2 Al} 2 (mu-OC 6 H 4 O) ]n in the solid state. But they react by a solid/vapor reaction with solid Lewis bases to form colorful polymers of [{(tBu) 2 Al} 2 (mu-OC 6 H 4 O) (mu-L) ]n, where L = pyrazine, 4, 4 -bipyridine, and 1, 4 -benzoquinone. The formation of these compounds has been comfirmed by 13 C CPMAS, 27 Al MAS, and solution 1 H NMR. The reaction between [(tBu) 2 Al(mu-OPh) ] 2 and 4, 4 -bipyridine in toluene or CH 2 Cl 2 yields [(tBu) 2 Al(OPh) ] 2 (mu- 4, 4 -bipy). In CDCl 3, [(tBu) 2 Al(OPh) ] 2 (mu- 4, 4 -bipy) dissociates forming [(tBu) 2 Al(OPh) (mu- 4, 4 -bipy) ], [(tBu) 2 Al(mu-OPh) ] 2, and uncoordinated 4, 4 -bipyridine. Based on equilibrium data, we have found that for [(tBu) 2 Al(OPh) ] 2 (mu- 4, 4 -bipy) one aluminum center electronically "communicates" to the <b>second</b> <b>aluminum</b> center by deactivating the nitrogen nine bonds away from the first aluminum center making one Al-N bond stronger than the other.
