50|$|In effect, to {{fall within}} the SME definition, the {{enterprise}} must stay below the <b>staff</b> <b>headcount</b> ceiling and fall below {{at least one of}} the turnover and balance sheet total ceilings.

50|$|The Federal Government reconstituted the Board of Directors of the Nigerian Export - Import Bank on the 14th of August 2009, {{including}} {{the appointment of}} a new Executive Management team of which is headed by Robert Orya. It was an effort at resuscitating the bank. By all financial and operational yardsticks, the bank was in dire straits. Its total loan portfolio was ₦14.6 billion out of which 72% was non-performing. Within that category, ₦10.03 billion or 69% was classified as completely lost. This ensured the depletion of the bank's shareholders fund. It took considerable efforts to lay out the state of the affairs of the bank, as a result of poor record-keeping. In spite of a bloated <b>staff</b> <b>headcount,</b> significant skill gaps were identified in the system.

In addition, the analysis falls upon the criteria adopted for the determination {{of the size of the}} enterprise, the perimeter and the moment relevant for the <b>staff</b> <b>headcount,</b> as well as the definition of the categories of employees that must be taken into account...|$|E
40|$|This article {{looks at}} the {{provisions}} of the new GBER (General Block Exemption Regulation) No 651 / 2014 evaluating the modifications regarding the State aid for employment in comparison with the pasts Commission Regulations (both No 800 / 2008 and No 2204 / 2002). These modifications can be seen through two significant features: firstly the introduction of new list of disadvantaged workers and secondly the adoption of a new approach in the definition of severely disadvantaged workers. The several significant changes regard also the aid for the recruitment of disadvantaged workers in the form of wage subsidies (in particular concerning an incentive effect and the obligation to ensure continuous employment for a minimum period) and the introduction of a specific provision for aid for compensating the costs of assistance provided to disadvantaged workers. Finally we focus on the criteria for the <b>staff</b> <b>headcount</b> and we highlight their implications on employment law...|$|E
