5|$|The {{change in}} tactics {{appeared}} to be effective, as October state elections in Ohio and Indiana resulted in Republican victories there, discouraging Democrats about their chances the following month. Democratic party leaders had selected English as Hancock's running mate because of his popularity in Indiana. With their state-level defeat there, some talked of dropping English from the ticket, but he convinced them that the October losses owed more to local issues, and that the Democratic ticket could <b>still</b> <b>carry</b> Indiana, if not Ohio, in November.|$|E
5|$|The {{prints were}} {{intended}} {{as a form of}} moral instruction; Hogarth was dismayed by the routine acts of cruelty he witnessed on the streets of London. Issued on cheap paper, the prints were destined for the lower classes. The series shows a roughness of execution and a brutality that is untempered by the funny touches common in Hogarth's other works, but which he felt was necessary to impress his message on the intended audience. Nevertheless, the pictures <b>still</b> <b>carry</b> the wealth of detail and subtle references that are characteristic of Hogarth.|$|E
5|$|Matters {{became more}} {{complicated}} in 1954, when the Independent Subway System (IND) started operating D trains on the Culver Line. At the time, the tracks had lettered names (i.e. Track A, Track B, {{all the way}} to Track H from east to west). However, the IND also used lettered designations for its routes (i.e. A, B, {{all the way to}} H as well). The BMT had used numbered route designations up to this point, so this had not been a problem. However, the D route was now using the Culver Line, which departed from tracks E and F. To avoid confusion, the tracks were renamed with numbered designations, which they <b>still</b> <b>carry.</b>|$|E

25|$|Tattoos are {{strongly}} empirically associated with deviance, personality disorders, and criminality.

25|$|Electromagnetic {{radiation}} (including visible light, ultraviolet light, {{and radio}} waves) is carried by photons. Even though photons (the particle aspect of light) have no mass, they <b>still</b> <b>carry</b> momentum. This leads to {{applications such as}} the solar sail. The calculation of the momentum of light within dielectric media is somewhat controversial (see Abraham–Minkowski controversy).|$|E
25|$|Even today, {{traditional}} paniolo dress, as well {{as certain}} styles of Hawaiian formal attire, reflect the Spanish heritage of the vaquero.

25|$|The final estate layout was {{established}} under Pyotr Saltykov’s heir - Ivan Saltykov, when a neighboring court {{and a vast}} umbrageous garden were adjoined to the estate. The mansion itself was rebuilt in Classical style. In 1804 it was renewed: a second floor was added and the wings were connected to the outhouses. The building wasn’t damaged in the fire of 1812. The main staircase leading {{to the second floor}} and the staterooms on the second floor which later became the theatre foyer <b>still</b> <b>carry</b> the classical features.|$|E

25|$|In the 1950s, local {{farmer and}} teacher Ron Purvis adapted the skil-saw concept by {{implementing}} a diamond rotary blade. This enabled the carving {{of the many}} immense jade boulders which line the banks and bed of the Fraser and Bridge Rivers, which were {{on the one hand}} immovable and on the other would shatter or striate if blasting was used to break them. Purvis' innovation was revolutionary in the jade mining business and larger versions of his saw are at use in the Cassiar region. There are no major commercial jade mines in the Lillooet area today, although local shops <b>still</b> <b>carry</b> polished jade souvenirs.|$|E
25|$|The Arctic's {{native peoples}} <b>still</b> <b>carry</b> out {{subsistence}} hunting of belugas to obtain food and raw materials. This practice {{is a part}} of their culture, but doubts still remain whether the number of whales killed may be sustainable. The number of animals killed is about 200 to 550 in Alaska and around 1,000 in Canada. However, in areas such as Cook Inlet, Ungava Bay, and western Greenland, previous levels of commercial whaling have put the species in danger of extinction, and continued hunting by the native peoples may mean some populations will continue to decline. The Canadian sites are the focus of discussions between the local communities and the Canadian government, with the objective of permitting sustainable hunting that does not put the species at risk of extinction.|$|E
25|$|Despite this {{apparent}} rescue, it crashes as well, and the survivors once again find themselves {{alone on the}} outskirts of Allegheny National Forest. Following a series of train tracks through the area, the group find themselves at a functioning, but abandoned, military outpost. After answering a radio transmission, the survivors make their final stand against hordes of infected, before a military APC arrives to transport them to Northeast Safe Zone Echo, supposedly the only uninfected area not yet overrun. Instead, they are kept at a military installation and informed that even though they are immune, they <b>still</b> <b>carry</b> the infection. They are temporarily held by the military before the base is overrun with infected. The four escape via train and travel south at Bill's insistence; Bill believes that they can find long-term safety from the infected on the islands of the Florida Keys.|$|E
