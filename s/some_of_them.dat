5|$|An equally {{important}} reform was {{the abolition of}} private tax farming, which was replaced by salaried civil service tax collectors.

5|$|As of October 2010, {{there are}} 18rest areas {{operating}} along the A3 motorway, and additional rest areas are planned along the existing {{sections of the}} route. Legislation provides for four types of rest areas, designated as types A through D. A-type rest areas comprise {{a full range of}} amenities, including a filling station, a restaurant and a hotel or a motel; B-type rest areas have no lodging; C-type rest areas are very common and include a filling station and a café, but no restaurants or accommodations; D-type rest areas offer parking spaces only, possibly some picnicking tables, benches and restrooms. Even though the rest areas found along the A3 motorway generally follow this ranking system, there are considerable variations, as <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> offer extra services.

5|$|Diamonds are {{extremely}} hard, but also brittle {{and can be}} split up by a single blow. Therefore, diamond cutting is traditionally considered as a delicate procedure requiring skills, scientific knowledge, tools and experience. Its final goal is to produce a faceted jewel where the specific angles between the facets would optimize the diamond luster, that is dispersion of white light, whereas the number and area of facets would determine {{the weight of the}} final product. The weight reduction upon cutting is significant and can be of the order of 50%. Several possible shapes are considered, but the final decision is often determined not only by scientific, but also practical considerations. For example, the diamond might be intended for display or for wear, in a ring or a necklace, singled or surrounded by other gems of certain color and shape. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> may be considered as classical, such as round, pear, marquise, oval, hearts and arrows diamonds, etc. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> are special, produced by certain companies, for example, Phoenix, Cushion, Sole Mio diamonds, etc.|$|E

5|$|English has {{undergone}} many historical sound changes, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> affecting all varieties, and others affecting only a few.
