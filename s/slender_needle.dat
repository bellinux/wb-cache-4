The insertion {{of a long and}} <b>slender</b> <b>needle</b> into the complicated human body is a very challenging procedure, especially for cases where obstacle avoidance is required. In this paper, a compliant needle is designed to achieve the purpose of obstacle avoidance and path planning task. The compliant needle head can be deflected by a magnetic force aided method which helps to achieve a more flexible turning angle in 3 D space navigation. The buckling effect of needle during insertion is investigated as well. By choosing an appropriate length and radius combination of a needle, the buckling effect can be avoided to achieve a more stable insertion. © 2008 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A wirelessly-powered electro-acupuncture (EA) that {{dynamically}} adapts to body-impedance variation (BIV), is proposed.

40|$|A {{flexible}} needle insertion simulation {{with force}} feedback is proposed. The objectives of this simulation are {{to evaluate the}} influence of needle parameters (length, radius) to insertion process and train users {{to better understand the}} process. Needle buckling will be witnessed while inserting a <b>slender</b> <b>needle</b> into tissue if the exerted force is larger than the critical force of a given flexible needle. Needle buckling can greatly affect the insertion performance, and it can also be utilized to control the insertion path inside tissue. This simulation system can assist users to choose appropriate needle parameters, and train them to be familiar with the process of flexible needle insertion, which is different from traditional needle insertion. Efficient modeling methods for tissue deformation, needle buckling and deflection, haptic rendering are proposed. An experimental simulator based on the proposed methods is developed. © 2008 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

30|$|Cymothoids are ectoparasitic isopods parasitizing teleost fishes inhabiting diverse {{ecosystems}} (Trilles 1968, 1994; Brusca 1981; Seng and Seng 1990; Horton and Okamura 2001; Trilles et al. 2011; Hadfield et al. 2013; Aneesh et al. 2014) {{and have}} been shown to cause deleterious effects on their hosts (Trilles and Hipea-Jacquotte 2012). For instance, the anemone fish Amphiprion akallopisos, Stolephorus commersonii and Hemiramphus far were severely damaged due to the parasitic infestation by Renocila heterozota, Nerocila phaeopleura and Mothocya plagulophora, respectively (Bowman and Mariscal 1968; Rajkumar et al. 2006; Gopalakrishnan et al. 2010). Five species of Nerocila (N. acuminata, N. phaiopleura, N. loveni, N. depressa and N. longispina) were reported to have induced severe tissue damage in seven fish species such as Gymnothorax eurostus, Thryssa malabarica, Thryssa mystax, Thryssa setirostris, Coilia dussumieri, Opisthopterus tardoore, Escualosa thoracata and Ambassis ambassis (Bowman 1960; Aneesh et al. 2013 a). Further, seasonal fluctuations in the population of four Nerocila species were reported from the Malabar Coast of India (Aneesh et al. 2013 a). Recent studies conducted in our laboratory have shown profuse infestation of the Indian mackerel Rastrelliger kanagurta and the <b>slender</b> <b>needle</b> fish Strongylura leiura by Norileca indica and Mothocya renardi, respectively (Aneesh et al. 2011, 2013 b). Most of the taxonomic descriptions of the cymothoids are based primarily on ovigerous females; the various life cycle stages (excepting perhaps the pre-manca/manca of few Cymothoa sp.) have not received much attention thus far (Richardson 1905; Sartor and Pires 1988; Thatcher et al. 2003, 2007; Trilles and Bariche 2006; Hadfield et al. 2011). Keeping these in view, the present paper addresses the question of precise identification of the cymothoid C. frontalis infesting the belonid fish inhabiting the Malabar Coast.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{obtain a}} unique {{solution}} to the well known indeterminacy for Ivantsov dendrites [Dokl. Akad. Nauk. SSSR, 58, 567 (1947) ] by considering the directional solidification of a binary alloy as an array of interacting needle crystal dendrites. From {{the results of an}} asymptotic theory for the steady-state solidification of <b>slender</b> <b>needle</b> crystal arrays, the shape of the dendrite can be obtained from the solution of a non-linear integral equation. Here we solve this integral equation numerically to determine the charac-teristics of the solutions and compare the results to dendrite morphologies observed in experiments. The integral equation has a solvability condition that selects a distinct tip radius and tip undercooling for a given set of experimental conditions and dendrite spacings. This selection criteria is fundamentally dierent from traditional tip selection theories based on surface energy, and is linked to the interactions of dendrites in the array. Predictions of the tip radius are in good agreement with experimental measurements for con-ditions where the asymptotic theory is expected to be valid. Our results suggest that the tip radius increases with array spacing in the experimentally relevant parameter range. This relationship is consistent with the existence of a range of stable array spacings during directional solidification: the lower bound on array spacings is set by the stability criteria for array overgrowth, and an upper bound may be determined by the condition for tip splitting. In the asymptotic limit of small dendrite spacings, our integral equation interestingly has a degenerate set of solutions, indicating a transition from selection to degeneracy in the limit of small spacings. The explanation of this transition {{is beyond the scope of}} our theory and remains to be addressed. # 1998 Acta Metallurgica Inc. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} geometric percolation and scaling {{relations in}} suspensions of nanorods, covering {{the entire range}} of aspect ratios from spheres to extremely <b>slender</b> <b>needles.</b> A new version of connectedness percolation theory is introduced and tested against specialised Monte Carlo simulations. The theory accurately predicts percolation threshold for aspect ratios of length to width as low as 10. The percolation threshold for rod-like particules of aspect ratios below 1000 deviates significantly from the inverse aspect ratio scaling prediction, thought to be valid in the limit of infinitely slender rods and often used {{as a rule of thumb}} for nanofibres in composites materials. Hence, most fibres that are currently used as fillers in composite materials cannot be regarded as pratically infinitely slender for the purposes of percolation theory. Comparing percolation thresholds of hard rods and new benchmark results for ideal rods, we find that i) for large aspect ratios, they differ by a factor that is inversely proportional to the connectivity distance between the hard cores, and ii) they approach the slender rod limit differently...|$|R

40|$|Various {{alkaloids}} {{have been}} {{isolated from the}} bark and seeds of Holarrhena antidysenterica since the early investigations of Haines in 1858 (1) when conessine, the main alkaloid was first obtained. Recently an additional alkaloid to which it has been proposed to apply the name norconessine has been isolated by Dr. R. D. Haworth (2) to whom I am indebted for the supply of the drug used in this present investigation. The following is {{a summary of the}} main chemical features as found by him. A light petroleum extract of the seeds of Holar-rhena antidysenterica contains conessine (3, 4) and a new base C 23 HN 2, for which the name norconessine is suggested. This new base was separated from conessine by fractional crystallisa-tion of the hydrogen oxalates. Norconessine is an oil boiling point 240 #{ 176 }/ 0. 7 mm. containing three methylimino groups, and is slightly dextrorotatory in alcoholic solution. It is dibasic and the salts, of which the hydrogen oxalates, nodules melting point 225 #{ 176 }C. (dec.) and the dihydrochloride, <b>slender</b> <b>needles,</b> melting point 340 #{ 176 }(dec.) have been obtained crystalline, are readily soluble in alcohol and water. In chemical properties norconessine resembles conessine. Norconessine appears to be identical with kurchine, one of the bases obtained from the bark of Holarrhena anti-dysenterica by Ghosh and Ghosh (5), and described more fully by Ghosh and Bose (6). As a result of the close chemical similarities of conessine and norconessine it was considered that it might be of interest to see whether this similarity extended to their pharmacological properties. The dihydrochloride of norconessine was the salt used throughout this investigation...|$|R

We love their balsamic breath, the long, <b>slender</b> <b>needles</b> of their leaves, and, above all, the constant sibylline whisperings that never cease among their branches. In summer the ground beneath them is paved with a soft and cleanly matting of their last year's leaves; and then their talking seems to be of coolness ever dwelling far up in their fringy, waving hollows. And now, in winter time, we find the same smooth floor; for the heavy curtains above shut out the snow, and the same voices above whisper of shelter and quiet. [...] "You are welcome," [...] they say; [...] "the north wind is gone to sleep; we are rocking him in our cradles. Sit down and be quiet from the cold." [...] At the feet of these slumberous old pines we find many of our last summer's friends looking as good as new. The small, round-leafed partridgeberry weaves its viny mat, and lays out its scarlet fruit; and here are blackberry vines with leaves still green, though with a bluish tint, not unlike what invades mortal noses in such weather. Here, too, are the bright, varnished leaves of the Indian pine, and the vines of feathery green of which our Christmas garlands are made; and here, undaunted, though frozen to the very heart this cold day, is many another leafy thing which we met last summer rejoicing each in its own peculiar flower. What names they have received from scientific god-fathers at the botanic fount we know not; we have always known them by fairy nicknames of our own--the pet names of endearment which lie between Nature's children and us in her domestic circle.|$|R
