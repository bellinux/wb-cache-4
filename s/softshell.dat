25|$|One of {{the main}} attractions of the bank is the Crocodile Conservation Center. It is the largest {{breeding}} center of crocodiles in India and has bred thousands of crocodiles since its inception. The captive breeding program at the crocodile bank was so successful that by the 1990s there were over 8,000 crocodiles in residence, thousands had been reintroduced to the wild, and more sent to zoos and wildlife parks around the world. The CrocBank has supplied crocodile eggs, snakes, water monitors, lizards and iguanas for breeding programs and for exhibits. The bank also provides surplus reptiles for transferring to other zoos and exchange programs. Since 1976, over 1,500 crocodiles and several hundred eggs have been supplied to various state forest departments for restocking programmes in the wild and for setting up breeding facilities in other states in India and neighboring countries. All three of the original species that were bred at the bank (the mugger, the gharial and the saltwater crocodile) remain endangered, while the gharial is critically endangered and now faces extinction. The CrocBank also successfully breeds several species of threatened turtles, including two listed as critically endangered. The bank is a coordinating zoo of the Central Zoo Authority of India for the breeding programmes for endangered species, including rock python, king cobra and Ganges <b>softshell</b> turtle, as per the National Zoo Policy adopted by the Government of India in 1988. The National Zoo Policy (1998) states several objectives that zoos should pursue including education, publications, and breeding rare and endangered species.

40|$|Abstract Several {{studies have}} shown that wetland loss and habitat {{fragmentation}} can alter diversity and abundance of herpetofauna, but taxonomic attention has been skewed towards amphibians. We assessed responses of aquatic turtles to features at multiple spatial scales in an intensively farmed region of the Midwestern United States. Spatially hierarchical sampling was conducted from 2001 to 2003 in 35 randomly selected 23 -km 2 cells throughout the upper Wabash River basin in Indiana. Hoop nets were used at wetlands to capture common snapping turtles (Chely-dra serpentina serpentina) (n= 258), midland painted turtles (Chrysemys picta marginata) (151), eastern spiny <b>softshells</b> (Apalone spinifera spinifera) (70), red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans) (59), northern map turtles (Graptemys geographica) (27), false map turtles (Graptemys pseudogeographica pseudogeographica) (6), Blanding’s turtles (Emy-doidea blandingii) (3), and stinkpot turtles (Sternotherus odoratus) (3). We examined the degree to which these aquatic species were nonrandomly distributed in 14 landscapes. Assemblages of turtles generally were random and the extent of nestedness was influenced by the diversity of landcover, the proportion of grassland, and the total length of roads in each landscape. The occurrence and abundance of several species also were modeled to test hypotheses regarding the importance of site, patch, and landscape-level variables. Red-eared sliders appeared to be most sensitive to habitat fragmentation, whereas pain-ted turtles, snapping turtles, map turtles, and spiny <b>softshells</b> were less affected. Factors at multiple spatial scales affect turtle distributions, suggesting differential responses to landscape fragmentation...|$|R

2500|$|For {{commercial}} harvesting, collectors {{use either}} basking traps or hoop traps. The basking trap is a floating enclosures with sloping sides and a basking surface. Turtles {{are able to}} climb up the sloping sides onto the basking surface, but then when they jump off into the center, they can't get back out. Hoop traps are cylindrical mesh traps with a funnel opening. Hoop traps are submerged and turtles are attracted by bait. In Minnesota, trappers say that they prefer basking traps to target painted turtles and hoop traps for [...] "meat" [...] turtles (snapping turtles and <b>softshell</b> turtles). Minnesota harvest records also show a clear pattern of most painted turtles coming from basking traps and most <b>softshell</b> and snapping turtles from hoop traps. Three quantitative studies of basking traps also show they are more efficient than baited hoop traps for trapping painted turtles. Despite the many hours of night and cloudiness when the basking traps do not lure turtles, the painted turtle's drive to bask is so powerful, that on a per-day basis, these traps are twice as effective. Or, possibly, the basking traps are more effective since painted turtles frequently escape back out the funnel of hoop traps.|$|E

40|$|The general {{changes in}} calcium {{metabolism}} of laying birds all {{appear to be}} related to the formation of an egg with a well-calcified egg shell. The outstanding peculiarity of the avian reproductive system would be the extreme rate of calcium mobilization necessary for the formation of the egg shell. Although recent studies on this subject have revealed many valuable mechanisms by which calcification of the egg shell is controlled, there are some aspects which are remained for discussion. Much of the material considered in this article is related to the calcium metabolism for the formation of the egg shell in the fowl. Calcium and phosphorus retention generally rises over a period of 2 weeks before laying begins. This phenomenon should be based on the synergistic action of both sets of estrogens and androgens, since simultaneous administration of these hormones evokes an increase of calcium and phosphorus retention and the use of estrogens or androgens alone does not appreciably affect the changes in blood calcium and phosphorus in immature birds. Evidence is presented to show that much calcium is stored during reproduction in a special system of bone in the skeleton. The significance of hormones other than estrogens and androgens is discussed. The weight of evidence suggests that both medullary bone and cortical bone participate in shell formation. The structure of the avian egg shell is briefly described and its formation is related to the changes which occur in the calcium metabolism of the fowl. The significance and mode of action of the carbonate and calcium ions in the blood, uterine mucosa and uterine fluid during shell formation are discussed. Blood acid-base balance parameter is solely involved in shell formation. Metabolic acidosis, ventilatory alcalosis and acute hypercapnia may have a detrimental effect on shell formation due to a pH drop or a loss of bicarbonate. It is also discussed that the detrimental effect of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors on shell formation can be attributed to its powerful salidiuretic which disturbs the acid-base valance in the blood. Derangement of certain physiological mechanisms of the ovary and oviduct, which are unlikely {{to be related to}} calcium metabolism, can lead to the production of <b>softshelled</b> eggs. A mechanism of shell formation linked with ovulation cycle is briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|An {{outbreak}} of a previously unrecorded shell {{disease in the}} Portunid mud crab Scylla serrata from Gladstone Harbour, Port Curtis, Queensland, was investigated. The shell lesions called 'rust spots' appeared as orange coloured areas on the dorsal carapace, which in severe cases would ulcerate to expose underlying soft tissues. Through the examination of over 3000 mud crabs the disease prevalence in Port Curtis compared {{to a number of}} other locations in Queensland, was determined. Although the prevalence varied over the three successive sampling periods, the average prevalence (14. 3 %) in Gladstone Harbour was higher than the normal background prevalence of 5 % reported for shell disease in other crustacean populations. The lesion pathology of rust spot lesions was determined to be unique compared to the described pathology of other shell diseases, where there is an external erosion of the shell primarily due to pathogenic organisms. In non-perforated rust spot lesions, however, the external shell layers remain intact, with the lesions being restricted to the endocuticle layer and adjacent muscle attachments. As this layer is fonned in the postmoult period, it is likely the lesions are due to a defect in the manufacturing of this layer rather than one of pathogenic degeneration. The histopathology was supported by observations of diseased mud crabs held over a moulting period, in which lesions were also observed to form in the postmoult phase. Although chitinoclastic bacteria are considered to be the primary causative agents of shell disease in other crustaceans, {{there was no evidence of}} an infectious or parasitic agent being associated with the internal organs or carapace lesions of the diseased mud crabs examined. Furthermore, water and inoculation transmission experiments failed to reproduce the disease in juvenile mud crabs, sand crabs (Portunus pelagicus) or prawns (Penaeus japonicus). Although the nature of transmission experiments is that failure to reproduce the disease does not necessarily mean definitively a noninfectious cause, in combination with the pathology results they suggest that the cause of rust spot shell lesions is likely to be non-infectious. Haemolympl 1. assays were undertaken in an endeavour to measure the health status of diseased mud crabs. Results indicated elevated biochemical factors (two immune factors; antibacterial and phenoloxidase and one cellular enzyme; glutamate dehydrogenase) in both diseased and non-diseased crabs from Gladstone compared to the crabs from Ayr, a non-impacted site where no shell disease had been recorded. Levels in the diseased group of crabs were, however, depressed in comparison to their non-diseased cohorts from the same location, indicating a possible suppression of immune responses in diseased crabs. As shell disease had been associated with polluted environments, the metal analyses of diseased and non-diseased mud crab tissues from Gladstone were also compared with those from Ayr. Copper and zinc were elevated in mud crab hepatopancreas from Gladstone compared to Ayr in two consecutive years. Mean copper concentrations of Gladstone crabs were two to three times greater than for mud crabs sampled from other locations in Queensland. Total metal burdens were also elevated in the Gladstone mud crabs, with a high variation in the diseased mud crabs suggesting that this group may be unable to regulate metal levels. As copper and other metals have been demonstrated to cause inhibition of calcium uptake in other crustaceans, copper exposure experiments were conducted to test the hypothesis that copper could cause rust spot shell lesions by inhibiting calcium uptake in the developing postmoult cuticle. The experiment confirmed that calcium uptake into the carapace of <b>softshelled</b> juvenile, mud crabs was inhibited by sublethal copper exposure. The copper exposure experiments supported the pathology findings that rust spot shell lesions are likely to be caused by a defect in the manufacturing process of the endocuticle. The source of elevated copper accumulations in mud crabs, whether water or sediment borne or dietary was investigated. Water and sediments collected from mud crab burrows and analysed for metals determined that very low concentrations of metals exist in the burrows. A comparison was made between the diets of Gladstone mud crabs and those from Ayr to determine whether diet could be implicated as a source of elevated copper in the Gladstone mud crabs. Stable isotope analyses (carbon and nitrogen) of mud crab muscle was undertaken as an alternative to gut content analysis to determine the dietary sources of carbon and trophic position of crabs from the two areas. Although Gladstone and Ayr crabs had a similar trophic position the disparate delta carbon results suggests the diets of the crabs are different with a correlation established between delta carbon and copper concentration in the tissues. It is possible that diet may be a source of copper in Gladstone mud crabs through biomagnification along the food chain. Although results are preliminary, research into this poorly defined area of ecosystem health in Port Curtis should be continued...|$|R
