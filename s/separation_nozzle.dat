2500|$|Aerodynamic {{enrichment}} processes include the Becker jet nozzle techniques developed by E. W. Becker and associates using the LIGA {{process and the}} vortex tube separation process. These aerodynamic separation processes depend upon diffusion driven by pressure gradients, as does the gas centrifuge. They in general have the disadvantage of requiring complex systems of cascading of individual separating elements to minimize energy consumption. In effect, aerodynamic processes {{can be considered as}} non-rotating centrifuges. Enhancement of the centrifugal forces is achieved by dilution of UF6 with hydrogen or helium as a carrier gas achieving a much higher flow velocity for the gas than could be obtained using pure uranium hexafluoride. The Uranium Enrichment Corporation of South Africa (UCOR) developed and deployed the continuous Helikon vortex separation cascade for high production rate low enrichment and the substantially different semi-batch Pelsakon low production rate high enrichment cascade both using a particular vortex tube separator design, and both embodied in industrial plant. [...] A demonstration plant was built in Brazil by NUCLEI, a consortium led by Industrias Nucleares do Brasil that used the <b>separation</b> <b>nozzle</b> process. However all methods have high energy consumption and substantial requirements for removal of waste heat; none are currently still in use.|$|E
40|$|Real-time {{identification}} and quantitative analysis of volatile and semi-volatile chemical vapors {{are critical for}} environmental monitoring. Currently available portable instruments lack the sensitivity for routine air quality monitoring, so preconcentrators are employed as front-ends for miniaturized chemical sensors. However, commonly used techniques for sensitivity enhancement have a time constant associated with adsorption/desorption or permeation of gas molecules being concentrated. Little work has been reported on fast-response concentrating techniques for gas sensing applications. 	This research {{is devoted to the}} development of a fast-response microfluidic gas concentrating device with appropriate flow dynamic shapes and pressure gradients based on the <b>separation</b> <b>nozzle</b> method. It is capable of concentrating heavy gas molecules diluted in light ones when they are flowing at high speeds, thus maintaining the measurement system response time. This is promising for developing real-time preconcentrators to improve the sensitivity of miniature chemical sensors. 	In the initial phase of this work, linear test structures were used to characterize viscous effects in microfluidic devices. Unit processes were developed to fabricate encapsulated micronozzles with through-hole inlets and outlets. The mass flow efficiency of the test structures was measured to be in the range of 0. 36 - 0. 81, increasing with rising Reynolds number as a result of the decreasing influence of boundary layers. 	 Single-stage gas concentration devices were designed and fabricated on the basis of the test structures. A gas separation experimental setup and a mass spectrometric analysis apparatus were developed to evaluate the performance of the devices. Analytical and finite element analyses were conducted to better understand and verify the experimental results. As a proof-of-concept, gas separation experiments with two different inert gas mixtures were carried out in conjunction with mass spectrometric analysis. More than two-fold enrichment of SF 6 molecules with a response time on the order of 0. 01 ms was demonstrated through the device. The effects of design parameters and operating conditions on the separation factor were determined experimentally and compared to the numerical simulation results. This study forms the basis for developing a cascade of the single-stage elements envisioned as a preconcentrator for miniature chemical sensors to realize real-time environmental monitoring...|$|E

40|$|Flow <b>separation</b> in <b>nozzles</b> of rocket engines is {{undesired}} {{because it}} can lead to dangerous lateral forces, which might damage the nozzle. The origin of side-loads is not fully clear, although different possible origins were identified in the past. Meanwhile, it seems to be clear that in thrust-optimized or parabolic nozzles, a major side-load is due to the transition of separation pattern from free shock separation to restricted shock separation and vice versa. After a literature review, the reasons for the transition between the separation patterns are discussed, and the cap shock pattern, which is identified to be the cause of this transition, is closely analyzed. It turns out that this pattern can be interpreted as an inverse Mach reflection of the internal shock at the centerline. The separation and side-load behavior of thrust-optimized and parabolic nozzles is described in detail. In {{order to be able to}} predict the pressure ratio pc/pa at which the transition of separation patterns occurs, a model is developed which uses TDK-data as an input.

It was found that the two jets moved closer to each other to reach an equilibrium separation distance that was approximately 70 % of the spacing between the two nozzles. The distance at which the instabilities were first observed {{on the surface of the}} jet was also a function of the initial separation distance. However, it was weakly dependent on the jet velocity.

Furthermore, computational fluid dynamics simulations were also used to identify the mechanism and dynamics of jet instability in the single jet systems. The simulation results were analysed to study the effect of instability on various parameters such as jet breakup, droplet formation and size of emulsion droplets. It was found that at higher volumetric flow rates, the droplets size increased during the jet breakup due to an asymmetric instability.
