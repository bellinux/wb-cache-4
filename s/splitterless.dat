40|$|This {{document}} {{reports on}} {{performance of a}} <b>splitterless</b> "V/ADSL" system that uses DMT with 4. 3125 kHz wide tones over the band from DC to 5 MHz. Asymmetric 26 / 3. 2 Mbps V/ADSL service reaches over 3000 feet, while symmetric service at 6. 5 Mbps and 3. 2 Mbps reaches are 3000 to 6000 feet for the conventional (or digitally duplexed) DMT. These ranges are maintained even {{in the presence of}} bridged-taps that will be evident in <b>splitterless</b> V/ADSL. Some potential vectored-DMT enhancements are also addressed, which allow mixture of medium asymmetric and long symmetric service in the same binder for unbundling purposes. This document also addresses spectral compatibility issues between V/ADSL lines themselves and with existing ADSL and G. pnt. __________________________________________________________________________________ NOTICE This contribution has been prepared to assist Standards Committee T 1 - Telecommunications.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{examines the}} spectral compatibility of Metalink's symmetric DSL (SDSL) {{system that is}} modulated with 2 B 1 Q. The transmitted bit-rates of this SDSL system addressed in this contribution are between 208 kbps and 2320 kbps. Because these SDSL systems have at most 14 dBm average transmit power, they will generally be spectrally compatible with ISDN and HDSL. Results for SDSL compatibility with T 1 lines are reported here. The impact of NEXT from SDSL on full-rate T 1. 413 ADSL and on G. 992. 2 <b>splitterless</b> ADSL (G. lite) is also calculated for the aforementioned SDSL bit rates and is presented in detail here. Results are given for same-binder NEXT. Achievable upstream and downstream ADSL bit rates {{in the presence of}} SDSL crosstalk are obtained as a function of loop length. For the 1168, 1552, and 2320 kbps SDSLs, the self-NEXT loop limit is determined, and the ADSL bit rates are determined as a function of ADSL loop deployment length with the high-rate SDSLs deployed at the above [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) is {{one member}} {{of a group of}} {{broadband}} access technologies that uses the existing copper-based local loop of the analog PSTN for high-speed digital data transmission. One feature of ADSL is that it permits analog voice POTS transmissions to continue uninterrupted over the same wiring. Specifically, POTS continues to use the 0 to 4 KHz frequency range of the copper wiring, while ADSL uses bandwidth starting at 25 KHz and extending up to approximately 1. 1 MHz for data transmission. The term 2 ̆ 2 asymmetrical 2 ̆ 2 refers to the fact that data rates downstream (to the user) and upstream (from the user) are not the same. Typical ADSL data rates range from 1. 536 to 6. 144 Mbps downstream and from 16 to 640 Kbps upstream. Local loop length, wire size, and the presence of devices to improve voice communication such as bridged taps and loading coils all affect ADSL data rates. Digital data is coded by one of two methods: Discrete Multitone Modulation (DMT) or Carrierless Amplitude and Phase Modulation (CAP). Echo control is also accomplished by one of two methods: Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) or echo cancellation. This paper consists of four sections: 1) A technical review and comparison of the CAP and DMT line encoding technologies. 2) A market review of the presence of CAP and DMT technologies in customer premise equipment (CPE) such as modems and routers. 3) A review of the POTS physical layer that exists between the ADSL subscriber and the Telco CO, and its impact on ADSL availability and quality of service (QOS). 4) A technical review of the newer, <b>splitterless,</b> G.

40|$|This {{document}} is a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment {{of the requirements}} of the University of Hertfordshire for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Part Time) in 'EMC in Wire-line Communications' in the School of Electronic, Communication and Electrical Engineering at the University of Hertfordshire. It describes a programme of research into the modelling and measurement of radio frequency interference emissions from various communication networks including Power Line (Tele) communications (PLC/PLT) and Digital Subscriber Line (DSL). An introduction and literature review are followed by the results of practical measurements on installed networks. These measurements include antenna gain and Longitudinal Conversion Loss (LCL). Power line communication networks, <b>splitterless</b> DSL and home phoneline networks in buildings are studied and modelled and the models are compared with the measured results. Improved EMC test methods are also described, in particular the modelling and design of four types of portable antennas for use in radiated EMC measurements with improved sensitivity at frequencies up to 30 MHz. The first type is a set of three manually tuned loop antennas covering 100 kHz - 30 MHz. The second is a set of three loop antennas that cover a similar frequency range but with remote tuning via an optical fibre link, under the control of software which also controls an EMC measuring receiver. The third type is a larger (1. 6 m diameter) tuned loop covering 1. 75 - 10 MHz that allows the measuring system noise floor to be below the typical atmospheric noise floor. The fourth type is an electrically short dipole covering 10 - 30 MHz with improved matching. The protection requirements for various types of radio communication services are analysed and are compared with emission levels from various types of wireline communication network. A review of existing applicable EMC standards and standards under development is also presented...|$|E
