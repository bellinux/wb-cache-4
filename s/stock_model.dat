The exhaust was routed through a special manifold to a <b>stock</b> <b>Model</b> T exhaust. The steel landing gear was fastened to the wing and used rubber doughnuts in compression for shock absorption. The designer of the aircraft, Otto Koppen, went on to design the Helio Courier.|$|E

25|$|Regarding the {{traditional}} pull approach to inventory control, {{a number of}} techniques have been developed {{based on the work}} of Ford W. Harris (1913), which came to be known as the economic order quantity (EOQ) model. This model marks the beginning of inventory theory, which includes the Wagner-Within procedure, the newsvendor model, base <b>stock</b> <b>model</b> and the Fixed Time Period model. These models usually involve the calculation of cycle stocks and buffer stocks, the latter usually modeled as a function of demand variability. The economic production quantity (EPQ) differs from the EOQ model only in that it assumes a constant fill rate for the part being produced, instead of the instantaneous refilling of the EOQ model.|$|E

In the United States, it retailed for US$499. On June 9, 2014, Microsoft released a new Xbox One retail configuration that excludes the Kinect sensor, costing US$399.

40|$|Safety <b>stock</b> <b>models</b> {{have been}} {{developed}} for traditionally short lead-time supply chains. With globalisation, long lead-time complex supply chains have become the norm for multi-national organisations. Customers have evolved and are expecting better supply reliability at lower costs. The research investigates the need for developing new safety <b>stock</b> <b>models</b> that adapt to the changing global supply chains and customer needs and can optimally absorb supply and demand variability. The new safety <b>stock</b> <b>models</b> should ensure promised customer service levels. Sasol Solvents, a chemical commodity company, was used {{as the basis for the}} research. The organisation has global distribution hubs in four regions with unique location based constraints. The sales and supply chain personnel in these regions participated in the research. It was found that the current safety <b>stock</b> <b>models</b> exclude applicable variables that are needed to determine the optimal safety stock levels in a long lead-time supply chain. This exclusion causes sub-optimal safety stocks, which result in lower customer service levels. New safety <b>stock</b> <b>models</b> should therefore be developed that contain these variables identified and should be adaptable to the evolving changes in customer preferences and supply chain configurations. The new models should ensure the optimisation of profitability for global organisations. Dissertation (MBA) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010.

30|$|Recycling {{is central}} to {{decoupling}} resource demand from economic development in regions with mature in-use stocks. With the high end-of-life recycling rate of cobalt [68  % were reported for the US (Graedel et al. 2011)] and because in-use stocks of cobalt have been growing continuously, one can expect rising amounts of Co-containing scrap in the future. Comprehensive long-term scenarios for metal cycles need to address recycling and therefore need to include dynamic <b>stock</b> <b>models</b> {{not only for the}} mineral resources of cobalt, but also for the use phase of cobalt. The combination of dynamic <b>stock</b> <b>models</b> and IO models has been demonstrated already (Nakamura et al. 2014; Kagawa et al. 2015), and it was applied in an MRIO context by Hertwich et al. to estimate the turnover rates of energy installations (Hertwich 2015). The combination of dynamic material <b>stock</b> <b>models</b> with input–output models with a by-product-technology construct, which would allow researchers to study how secondary materials can replace primary production, has to our knowledge not been attempted yet.|$|R

Discussed theory is applied on real financial data. In numeric application there is a construction of a volatility estimates for two specific <b>stocks</b> using <b>models</b> described in the first part of this thesis.
