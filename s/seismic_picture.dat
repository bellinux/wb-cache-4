40|$|Abstract In this paper, we {{show the}} {{seismicity}} {{of the past}} 20 years that occurred in Italy and surrounding regions. Hypocentral locations have been obtained by using P- and S-wave arrival times from the INGV national and several regional permanent seismic networks. More than 48, 000 events, selected from an original data set of about 99, 780, are used to reconstruct the most complete <b>seismic</b> <b>picture</b> of the Italian region so far. The seismicity distribution allows inference on seismotectonics of this complex region of subduction versus continental collision. Our results clearly reveal the geometry of the Adria and the Ionian subduction and a continuous normal fault belt in the upper crust, following the Apennines mountain range. The depth of the seismogenic layer is computed from the cut-off of seismicity at depth and shows large variations along and across the seismic active regions. Earthquakes are generated by the different velocity of slab retreat and the subsequent asthenospheric upwelling. D 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The Low level Acoustic Combustion Source (LACS) is a {{new type}} of pulsed {{underwater}} acoustic source with an output level of 0. 5 - 1. 0 barm peak to peak. The source is based on a combustion engine and intended for shallow seismic surveys. It operates at 5 m depth and is able to fire pulses at a rate of up to 11 shots per second. Because of the source’s low output level, it is expected to be more suitable than other sources in environmental sensitive areas. The low pulse level may be compensated for by an integration of energy from a sequence of pulses. This article describes the results of a seismic field test in Byfjorden outside Bergen, Norway. The best seismic result is achieved using deconvolution or an iterative correlation method where the correlator sequence is recorded right below the seismic source. Compared with airgun results along the same survey path, the <b>seismic</b> <b>picture</b> based on the LACS source gives a clearer presentation of the bottom layers...|$|E

40|$|The {{region to}} the east of Palghat gap is of low {{elevation}} and nearly circular in shape. It forms a part of the Kaveri river basin. The predominantly gneissic terrain is surrounded by the charnockitic hill ranges, prominent among which are Nilgiris and Biligirirangan to the north; and Anaimalai and Kodaikanal to the south. The charnockite massifs have a steep slope facing the circular feature and a gentler slope in the opposite direction. Fractures/faults/shear zones are noticed in many parts. The Bouguer anomaly in the gneissic terrain is elliptical in shape and positive, relative to the surrounding elevated region. The magnetic contours are also elliptical and the magnetic basement is deeper by about one km compared to regions in the periphery. The shallow <b>seismic</b> velocity <b>picture</b> from Chennimalai to Palani indicates a graben structure. The velocity structure also depicts a 4 – 5 km Moho upwarp near Chennimalai. Junction between the gneissic and charnockitic terrain and even beyond, is marked by the presence of pseudotachylites and breccia. Field and petrographic studies indicate presence of suevite, Planar Deformation Features (PDF), Planar Fractures, diaplectic glass of quartz and plagioclase and spherical inclusion in suevite. These evidences taken together point to an extra-terrestrial impact which created a crater of approximately 120 km in diameter. Several lines of indirect evidences point to Neoproterozoic age for the impact. Kaveri Crater is the fourth largest crater {{on the surface of the}} Earth; other larger craters being Vredefort (160 km), Chicxulub (150 km) and Sudbury (130 km) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceI {{present a}} {{detailed}} description of the temporal properties of seismicity in a hierarchical model of rupture incorporating healing and faulting. At the microscopic scale, a stochastic process controls transitions between a solid and a broken state with respect to the local stress. From the distribution of broken elements, geometric rules of interaction determine the state of fracturing of domains of larger dimensions and the shape of the stress redistribution. Then, any point in space evolves with respect to its state of stress and its state of fracturing measured at different length scales. Applied to a single fault zone under a constant loading rate, this model of seismicity reproduces the main characteristics of the seismic catalogues: Gutenberg-Richter law for the magnitude-frequency relationship, Omori law for the aftershock decay rate, clustering of major events, swarms of earthquakes, seismicity of creeping segment and seismic noise. I infer that the control parameter is the dimensionless parameter A, the ratio between a characteristic time of healing and a characteristic time of loading. Following the magnitude of A, different seismic scenarios emerge: if A≈ 1, the system is in a critical state and largest events can occur over a wide range of timescales (e. g. clustering of major events); if A 1, the system is in subcritical states controlled by healing and the fault zone may be creeping. One particular feature is that the amplitude of the stress stored in the fault zone decreases and the frequency of large events increases as the critical state is approached. This can be interpreted as a weakening process. I propose a new phase diagram of seismicity to illustrate an alternative to the classical <b>seismic</b> cycle <b>picture...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Seismic</b> {{data are}} <b>pictures</b> showing {{subsurface}} <b>seismic</b> reflectivity. Seismic data interpretations concern with building geological models {{with the aim}} to describe relationship between the seismic data and a priori geological information. The models are used for hydrocarbon exploration or other geotechnical investigations. This thesis work is motivated by a demand of computer-assisted interpretation of seismic data. Manual interpretations take too long and are almost always non-unique. The computer-assisted interpretation has advantages in that it provides a faster interpretation framework and a consistent workflow. This thesis focuses on automating horizon matching across a fault surface. Horizons are visible boundaries between certain sediment layers in seismic data. Faults are discontinuity surfaces across which horizons are cut and displaced. Automation tools, such as auto-trackers, are widely being used to assist horizon interpretation. However, they fall short of tracking horizons across faults. Horizon matching across faults is done after defining the fault surface, and it is about establishing the pre-fault geological continuity of horizons. In order to define the fault surface, a new semi-automatic fault-tracking method has been developed. It involves fault enhancin...|$|R

A hydro-geophysical model, developed to simulate the hydrogeologic and geophysical effects of subsidence due to longwall mining, was tested against observations made over a longwall mine panel in Saline County, Illinois. Longwall mine subsidence caused fracturing of both the consolidated and unconsolidated overburden and altered the hydrogeologic characteristics of the overburden aquifers. The geophysical part of this work utilized seismic fracture characterization theories, commonly used in oil reservoir analysis, to predict fracture sizes and densities in unconsolidated deposits. The elastic properties of rocks in an oil reservoir at a few kilometers depth (under very high confining pressures) are very different from those of near-surface sediments. This fundamental difference was recognized and theoretical modifications were made to the widely used Garbin-Knopoff theory to characterize near-surface unconsolidated sediment fractures. The P-wave velocity reduction due to fracturing was then related to the size and density of the fractures, and this modification was confirmed through an experiment over known fractures. High-resolution seismic refraction tomography was then utilized to obtain a <b>seismic</b> velocity <b>picture</b> of generally saturated rocks and sediments along a cross-section above the mine panel before and after subsidence. Velocity reductions as much as 25 % were imaged over the static tension zone of the mine where fracturing may have extended to a depth of 10 $-$ 15 m. A mine-driven flow model was derived to determine pre-subsidence hydraulic diffusivities (and specific storage) from time-drawdown data ahead of the mine face for the entire lower drift aquifer. Specific storage after subsidence was determined using a combined seismic fracture density/drawdown model. Post-subsidence specific storage showed a 20 -fold increase for the lower drift aquifer, as compared to the specific storage before subsidence...|$|R
40|$|LKAB’s {{underground}} mine in Kiirunavaara has experienced an increasing seismic activity {{the last ten}} years. This seismic activity {{is caused by the}} stress redistribution resulting from the mining method of large-scale sublevel caving. The energy from the seismic events propagate in the rock mass as seismic waves. If one of these waves interacts with an excavation, it will be subjected to dynamic loads, and damage can potentially occur. Damage can be caused by different mechanisms depending on many factors such as pre-existing structures in the rock mass and the state of stress. To prevent these damages, LKAB has installed a rock support system for handling dynamic loads. This thesis has analysed available damage mapping reports, investigations, <b>pictures,</b> <b>seismic</b> data and history, in order to evaluate the function of the support system when subjected to dynamic loads. The conclusion of the analysis is that the support system is well designed, but there are areas of improvement. The main damage mechanisms are bulking without ejection and rockfall due to seismic shaking. Bulking with ejection and ejection due to seismic energy transfer were concluded to not yet be a problem in the Kiirunavaara mine. This result implies that an improved stiffness, static strength and yieldability are to be considered in order to decrease the amount of bulking. For rockfall due to seismic shaking, there are two main areas of improvement. The structural mapping has to be given higher priority, and it should provide direct support recommendations if needed. The second part is to increase the static strength of the system in order to survive rockfall due to seismic shaking. Since bulking with ejection and ejection due to seismic energy transfer are not yet considered significant problems, {{there is no need to}} improve the support system with respect to absorption of kinetic energy. The location of the damages in the drift profiles were also analysed, and it was concluded that a majority of the damages that occurred in the footwall drifts were located in the corner of the abutment facing the orebody. In the crosscuts, a majority of the damages occurred in the abutment and roof. Based on this, it is suggested that the support should be improved in the abutment and roof of the crosscuts, and in the abutment facing the ore of the footwall drifts...|$|R
