5|$|The new stand {{became a}} {{financial}} burden for the club. Operating costs increased after Norwegian clubs {{were allowed to}} wage players from 1984. In addition, interest rates rose quickly, making the club unable to meet its financial obligations. At the same time, the club experienced falling attendance. In 1985, the club's auditor warned that the club was heading into financial distress. In 1986, the club spent NOK1 million to build terraces between the club house and the pitch on the northern <b>short</b> <b>side,</b> and terraces on the southern <b>short</b> <b>side.</b> In 1990, Hamar Municipality gave Ham-Kam a grant of NOK1.7 million {{in an attempt to}} save the club's finances, {{in part because of the}} club's debt on the venue.|$|E
5|$|He had his {{breakout}} {{game for}} the New Zealand club in the round 18 48-0 victory over the Parramatta Eels. Tomkins scored two tries, {{one of which was}} directly from the lock position after a scrum win against the feed. The other of which, also from a scrum play, was down the <b>short</b> <b>side</b> where he broke four tackles in a fantastic individual effort. He also set up a brilliant try for captain Simon Mannering. In the first half, Tomkins recorded nine tackle breaks, a try assist, two line breaks, 84 running metres and two tries. His first half performance truly put him on the map in the National Rugby League after some debate previous to this game over whether he was worth the big money.|$|E
5|$|Malmö Stadion has {{an overall}} {{capacity}} of 26,500 spectators for sports, of which 14,000 are standing spectators. When hosting concerts, the stadium can host 25,000 spectators when {{the stage is}} on either long side of the stadium, or up to 40,000 when it is {{placed in front of}} either <b>short</b> <b>side.</b> It comprises two main stands on each of the long sides of the pitch: the Southern Stand and the Northern Stand, both of which have two tiers. The lower tier of the Northern Stand is terraced, and was the only tier of the stand until the upper, seated tier was built in 1992. The short sides of the pitch feature two minor terracing sections, respectively named the Eastern Stand and the Western Stand. When Malmö FF were based at the ground, the Northern Stand terracing was the section with the most season ticket holders, while the Eastern Stand was the section used to house away fans.|$|E

5|$|This action (and {{others like}} it) was {{intensely}} unpopular {{with the other}} investors, however, and he was blackballed from entry in the New York Stock Exchange several times before regaining admittance. Following the event, a rule was made to limit the length of any option contracts to sixty days, to prevent a similar coup on the <b>short</b> <b>side.</b> After some troubles, Little was again worth $2 million by 1846 (equivalent to about $ million today). However, his fortunes were again reversed that year when he attempted but failed to corner the Norwich and Worcester Railroad and was obligated to pay out for thousands of inflated shares that he had himself bid up in price, losing about {{a million dollars in}} the process—a staggering sum at the time.|$|E

25|$|In the low {{pressure}} process α-olefins (e.g. 1-butene or 1-hexene) may be added, which are {{incorporated in the}} polymer chain during polymerization. These copolymers introduce <b>short</b> <b>side</b> chains, thus crystallinity and density are reduced. As explained above, mechanical and thermal properties are changed thereby. In particular, PE-LLD is produced this way.|$|E
25|$|A {{filing cabinet}} {{is a piece}} of office {{furniture}} usually used to store paper documents in file folders. In the most simple sense, it is an enclosure for drawers in which items are stored. A vertical file cabinet has drawers that extend from the <b>short</b> <b>side</b> (typically 15inches) of the cabinet. The vertical filing cabinet was invented by Edwin G. Seibels in 1898, thus revolutionizing efficient record-keeping and archiving by creating space for offices, schools, and businesses.|$|E

25|$|The {{railroad}} {{that had}} nurtured Main Street eventually caused its decline. In 1928, {{now part of}} the New York Central, the line was expanded from one track to two, and in the process Main Street's grade crossing was eliminated in favor of a new overpass called Bridge Street, one block to the north. Traffic to what little commercial activity remained at the riverfront simply followed the new street straight to it, turning Main into a <b>short</b> <b>side</b> street that remained important to the community only as the location of its general store.|$|E
25|$|Crater Lake National Park {{is reached}} by train on the Southern Pacific Railroad lines into Medford and Klamath Falls, at which stops motor stages make the short {{trip to the}} park. A hotel {{on the rim of}} the lake offers accommodations. For the motorist, the visit to the park is a <b>short</b> <b>side</b> trip from the Pacific and Dalles-California highways.

25|$|The Board of Transportation's final {{headquarters}} {{was located}} at 370 Jay Street, at {{the northwest corner}} of Jay Street and Wiloughby Street in the modern MetroTech Center of Downtown Brooklyn. The building is bound by Pearl Street to the west, and was formerly bound by Myrtle Avenue at its north end; this portion of the street has since been de-mapped. The 14-story office building was designed by architects William Haugaard and Andrew J. Thomas in post-war modernist style. The building is L-shaped, the long side along Jay Street, and the <b>short</b> <b>side</b> along the former Myrtle Avenue. The outer facade of the building consists of white limestone, with 420 square and uniformly-arranged casement windows.|$|E
25|$|If the {{defending}} king {{is in front}} of the pawn and the attacking king and pawn have not yet reached their sixth rank, the Philidor position (or Philidor defense) easily works to secure a draw. If {{the defending}} king cannot get in front of the pawn but is not cut off, the <b>short</b> <b>side</b> defense can be used. If the pawn is a rook pawn or knight pawn, the back rank defense can be used. The back rank defense can also be used when the pawn is on other files if the attacking king has not reached the sixth rank. If the king is cut off along a file, the frontal defense may work, depending on the file of the pawn and how far advanced it is.|$|E
25|$|In 1603 Pope Clement VIII (r. 1592–1605) {{recruited}} in Corsica {{six hundred}} infantrymen. This act marks the official {{beginning of the}} Corsican Guard. The soldiers were quartered in the rione Regola, between {{the church of the}} Santissima Trinità dei Pellegrini and that of San Paolino, not far from Ponte Sisto, and in rione Ponte, at Vicolo dei Soldati ("Soldiers' Lane"), which got its name from another barrack occupied by Corsican soldiers. Another place frequented by the soldiers was Vicolo dell'Armata ("Army Lane"), also in Regola, a <b>short</b> <b>side</b> lane connecting Via Giulia with the shore of the Tiber, where there existed an inn, the Osteria dell'Armata ("Army Inn"), so called because it was attended by Corsican soldiers belonging to the Pope's guard.|$|E

25|$|The {{northern}} side of Birkhouse Moor is {{bounded by}} the more complex Glenridding valley system. Glenridding Beck has three principal southern tributaries: Mires Beck, Bleacove Beck and Red Tarn Beck. Mires Beck flows from Little Cove, a small corrie separating Keldas and the Nab. Bleacove Beck empties Blea Cove, a <b>short</b> <b>side</b> valley between The Nab and the north ridge. Red Tarn Beck forms the western perimeter of Birkhouse Moor, draining the large tarn of that name nestling beneath the summit of Helvellyn. There is more rock on this side, with Nab Crag rising above Blea Cove and extensive outcropping on all three ridges. There remains evidence on the Glenridding slopes of the former activities of Greenside Mine. Several leats and pipelines can still be traced which once captured the water of these streams for industrial use.|$|E
25|$|These small 0-4-0 tank engines {{were and}} are the {{standard}} shunter locomotives of the system, built between 1927 and 1937 by the firm of Breda in Milan. They have <b>short</b> <b>side</b> tanks, a rear coal bunker, and a unified, oval dome containing the steam dome inside a larger sand dome. This arrangement, popular worldwide in nations that favored the sand dome, helped both to insulate the steam dome {{and to keep the}} sand dry with the warmth. Large, prominent builder's plates adorn the domes. They utilise Walschaerts valve gear with piston valves and superheating, and are painted in the traditional European style of red below the running board, including frames and wheels, and black above, including boiler, cab, tanks etc. The purpose of the red paint is to make cracks and breakages in the locomotive's important running gear more obvious.|$|E
25|$|The parkway uses <b>short</b> <b>side</b> {{roads to}} connect to other highways, {{and there are no}} direct {{interchanges}} with Interstate Highways, making it possible to enjoy wildlife and other scenery without stopping for cross-traffic.

The mileposts {{can be found on the}} right-hand side of the road while traveling southbound on the parkway. Major towns and cities along the way include Waynesboro, Roanoke, and Galax in Virginia; and in North Carolina, Boone and Asheville, where it runs across the property of the Biltmore Estate. The Blue Ridge Music Center (also part of the park) is located in Galax, and Mount Mitchell (the highest point in eastern North America) is only accessible via a state highway (NC 128) from the parkway at milepost 355.4.|$|E
