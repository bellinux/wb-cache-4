5|$|When Rama {{abandons}} {{the young}} Maya Sita at Agni Pariksha, she – {{worried about her}} uncertain future – questions Rama and Agni about what should <b>she</b> <b>do</b> now. They advise {{her to go to}} Pushkar and perform austerities (Tapas) and prophesy that she will be become Svargalakshmi ("Lakshmi of the heaven") as the result of her asceticism. Shiva is pleased with her penance and promises to grant her desired boon. Maya Sita, who is transformed into Svargalakshmi by practising austerities for three lakh years, anxiously repeats five times that she get a husband. Shiva blesses her that she will be born as Draupadi, the princess of Pancala, who will have five husbands. Draupadi, the heroine of the Mahabharata, is born out of the flames of a yajna (fire sacrifice) of Drupada (King of Panchala) and later becomes the common wife of the five Pandava brothers, princes of Kuru kingdom. The text also declares that in previous birth, Maya Sita was Vedavati, a woman Ravana tries to rape and who curses Ravana that she will be the cause of his ruin. Since she has taken birth in three yugas (ages; a cycle of four ages is believed to repeat) – Vedavati in Satya yuga, Maya Sita in Treta Yuga and Draupadi in Dwapara yuga, she is known as Trihayani, the one who appears in the three ages.|$|E

25|$|MGM {{had bought}} the film rights to Clare Boothe Luce's 1936 smash Broadway hit The Women in 1937. Many writers had, unsuccessfully, taken a stab at a {{screenplay}} version. The studio handed it to Loos and veteran scriptwriter Jane Murfin, and three weeks later Loos handed Cukor a script that he loved. Unfortunately the censorship board did not. They insisted on changing more than 80 lines, and the film {{had to go into}} production. Loos was apprehensive, but Cukor insisted <b>she</b> <b>do</b> the changes on set, among his all-star bevy of leading ladies. Loos made immediate friends with Paulette Goddard, who was surprisingly well-read. She also had Aldous and Maria Huxley as houseguests, and encouraged Huxley to stay in California and continue to write there. When World War II began in September 1939, Loos convinced Huxley that it would be safer for his family if they stayed in the United States rather than returning to England, and she got him a job adapting screenplays at MGM.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} years of her career, Cyrus had a {{generally}} wholesome image as a teen idol. Her fame increased dramatically following the Vanity Fair photo scandal, and it was reported that photos of Cyrus could be shopped for $2,000 apiece. In the following years, Cyrus' image continued to shift dramatically, differing from her previous teen idol status. Donny Osmond wrote of Cyrus' transition into adulthood: [...] "Miley will have to face adulthood..... As she does, she'll want to change her image, and that change will be met with adversity." [...] The release of Can't Be Tamed (2010) saw Cyrus officially attempting to distance herself from her teenage years, releasing controversial music videos for her songs [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] (2010) and [...] "Who Owns My Heart" [...] (2010). Her behavior generated a considerable amount of controversy throughout 2013 and 2014, though godmother Dolly Parton stated [...] "...the girl can write. The girl can sing. The girl is smart. And she doesn't have to be so drastic. But I will respect her choices. I did it my way, so why can't <b>she</b> <b>do</b> it her way?" [...] Cyrus was placed at number seventeen on Forbes' list of the most powerful celebrities in 2014, with the magazine noting that [...] "The last time she made our list was when she was still rolling in Hannah Montana money.

500|$|Conor Behan of The Independent {{qualified}} {{the clip}} as being [...] "effortlessly sexy". Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone described the video {{for the song}} as the most NSFW from the album. Brent DiCrescenzo of Time Out referred to the clip for [...] "Partition" [...] as a classic MTV video. A more negative review came from The Verge Trent Wolbe who panned Nava's contribution to the album as uninteresting. The Daily Telegraph writer Sarah Crompton stated that the video looked suitable for a porn website and described its imagery as [...] "strip club dressed up as a Busby Berkeley musical". Crompton went on to call the message the video sent [...] "peculiar" [...] and added that the singer should try to become a better role model for young girls. Vivienne Pattison of Mediawatch-uk commented that such visuals showed that Beyoncé had [...] "sold out" [...] and undermined her position as a [...] "role model" [...] and previous [...] "powerful messages that empowered women and girls". In early March 2014, Bill O'Reilly criticized the video for [...] "Partition" [...] during his show The O'Reilly Factor broadcast on Fox News. He said that it represented glorification of sex {{in the back of}} a limousine and offered critique that teenage girls are influenced by the singer, adding, [...] "Why would <b>she</b> <b>do</b> it when she knows the devastation that unwanted pregnancies... and fractured families [...] I think Beyoncé, what she has done here, is inexplicable". In response to these claims, Rutger University's Kevin Allred argues that [...] "Beyonce isn’t sensationalizing her own body and putting it on display for viewers to gawk at. Rather, she performs the historical objectification of black female bodies and replays that objectification in order to point out that, stereotypically, black women have had few means of garnering attention beyond sexual performances. She goes so far as forcing the viewer to be complicit in this objectification by positioning them as the direct viewer of the show she is enacting." [...] The video was nominated in the category for Video of the Year at the 2014 BET Awards. At the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards it was nominated in the categories for Best Choreography and Best Female Video.|$|E
