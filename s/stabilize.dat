40|$|This article {{describes}} a laboratory study on <b>stabilizing</b> peat soil using Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) as binding agent and Polypropylene fibers as additive. Due to high initial water {{content of the}} <b>stabilized</b> peat soil samples and in-order to gradually reduce their moisture content, the <b>stabilized</b> peat soil samples kept in normal air temperature and out of water intrusions to drier condition during the curing period. This process of curing the <b>stabilized</b> peat soil with cement is been named Air Curing Technique. Laboratory tests used for the strength evaluations of <b>stabilized</b> peat soil are Unconfined Compression Strength (UCS), and California Bearing Ratio (CBR). Air Curing periods used are 28, 90, 180 days for the UCS tests and 90 days for the CBR (soaked, and un-soaked) tests. As the curing time for the <b>stabilized</b> peat soil continues the moisture content decreases, thus weight of Water/weight of Cement (W/C) reduces, {{and as a result}} <b>stabilized</b> peat soil is hardened and gains strength. The result of strength tests show significant strength improvement of <b>stabilized</b> peat soil through curing period. Also polypropylene fibers when added to the <b>stabilized</b> peat soil with cement, not only give more strength values to the <b>stabilized</b> peat, rather contribute a considerable amount of uniformity and intactness to the <b>stabilized</b> peat as well...|$|R

In this research, a set of soil samples with different cationic exchange capacity were selected, <b>stabilized</b> soil specimens are prepared by mixing the soil samples with different proportions of cement and Ca(OH) 2. The influence of soil cationic exchange capacity on the strength of the <b>stabilized</b> soil are investigated by means of measuring the concentrations of main ions in the pore solutions squeezed from the <b>stabilized</b> soil specimens and the strength of the <b>stabilized</b> soil. It is revealed that: cationic exchange of the soil samples depresses the Ca(OH) 2 saturation of the <b>stabilized</b> soil. When the cationic exchange capacity of the soil samples is high enough, the Ca(OH) 2 concentration of the pore solution in the <b>stabilized</b> soil cannot get saturated, under these conditions, further cationic exchange depletes Ca 2 +, OH- which shall be used to generate calcium silicate hydrate, so the amount of calcium silicate hydrate decreases, which results in the poor strength of the <b>stabilized</b> soil...|$|R

The influence of soil CEC on the strength of the <b>stabilized</b> soil was investigated by analyzing the CH saturation in the pore solution and measuring the strength of the <b>stabilized</b> soil specimens. It is revealed that cation exchange in the soil can reduce the CH saturation of the <b>stabilized</b> soil. If the CEC of the soil is too high, the CH in the pore solution of the <b>stabilized</b> soil cannot reach the saturation level, and further cation exchange would then consume the Ca 2 + ions which should be originally used to generate calcium silicate hydrate, thus result in the poor strength of the <b>stabilized</b> soil...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} a new property of computing systems called weak stabilization. Although this property is strictly weaker than the well-known property of stabilization, weak stabilization {{is superior to}} stabilization in several respects. In particular, adding delays to a system preserves the system property of weak stabilization, but does not necessarily preserve its stabilization property. Because most implementations are bound to add arbitrary delays to the systems being implemented, weakly <b>stabilizing</b> systems are much easier to implement than <b>stabilizing</b> systems. We also prove the following important result. A weakly <b>stabilizing</b> system that has {{a finite number of}} states is in fact <b>stabilizing</b> assuming that the system execution is strongly fair. Finally, we discuss an interesting method for composing several weakly <b>stabilizing</b> systems into a single weakly <b>stabilizing</b> system. ...|$|R
