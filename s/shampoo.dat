40|$|Main {{goal of this}} Master's thesis was to {{evaluate}} how price reductions influence consumers' likelihood to purchase FMCG products in connection to brand loyalty. Czech customers are characterized by high sensitivity to sales promotions. This thesis is focused on analysis of price discounts of <b>shampoos</b> in the Czech Republic. Leaflets of main retailers selling drugstore products were researched in order to describe the frequency and discount depth of <b>shampoos.</b> Customers' behaviour while buying <b>shampoos</b> and their attitude towards price discounts of <b>shampoos</b> were examined through a questionnaire. Main hypotheses that <b>shampoos</b> are discounted very frequently and of significant depth were confirmed. To conclude, customers' likelihood to buy <b>shampoos</b> increases heavily with discounted prices {{and some of the}} customers even believe that it is not worth buying <b>shampoos</b> for full prices...|$|R
5000|$|Despite a {{big success}} of {{medicated}} <b>shampoos</b> there are also other alternatives for people who dislike using a lot of chemicals. Organic, natural <b>shampoos</b> can be a suitable alternative. These <b>shampoos</b> often use tea tree oil, essential oils and extracts.|$|R
50|$|The {{considerations}} in 3 and 4 frequently {{result in a}} much greater multiplicity of surfactants being used in individual baby <b>shampoos</b> than in other <b>shampoos,</b> and the detergency and/or foaming of such products may be compromised thereby. The monoanionic sulfonated surfactants and viscosity-increasing or foam stabilizing alkanolamides seen so frequently in other <b>shampoos</b> are much less common in the more popular brand baby <b>shampoos.</b>|$|R

5|$|Maurice Hurley saw {{the episode}} as {{commentary}} {{on the sale of}} F-14 Tomcats to Iran. He intended to have Doctor Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) reveal her feelings for Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) in this episode, but Gene Roddenberry had it changed. Dan Curry created the model of the drone seen in this episode using a pantyhose container and a <b>shampoo</b> bottle. The opinions of critics were mixed, but singled out the appearance of Vincent Schiavelli for praise.|$|E
5|$|The {{model of}} the drone was created by Dan Curry, from a L'eggs pantyhose {{container}} and a <b>shampoo</b> bottle. He hand animated the model instead of using motion control photography, using his years of Tai Chi training to keep the movements fluid. In order to blend into the background, he wore a pair of green tights whilst he was manually moving the model on screen.|$|E

5|$|Wilco began touring {{before the}} album was released. Their live debut was on November 27, 1994, at Cicero's Basement Bar in St. Louis, a venue where Uncle Tupelo had first {{received}} significant media attention.

5|$|Mir {{featured}} a shower, the Bania, located in Kvant-2. It was an improvement on the units installed in previous Salyut stations, but proved {{difficult to use}} due to {{the time required to}} set up, use, and stow. The shower, which {{featured a}} plastic curtain and fan to collect water via an airflow, was later converted into a steam room; it eventually had its plumbing removed and the space was reused. When the shower was unavailable, crew members washed using wet wipes, with soap dispensed from a toothpaste tube-like container, or using a washbasin equipped with a plastic hood, located in the core module. Crews were also provided with rinse-less <b>shampoo</b> and edible toothpaste to save water.|$|E

40|$|The {{clinical}} {{efficacy of}} antidandruff <b>shampoos</b> is correlated with both their anti-Malassezia nd their squamolytic activities. The sebum flow nourishing the lipophilic yeasts is another actor on the scene, fueling the skin disorder. This {{study was conducted}} in 120 men in order to quantify the effect of eight proprietary antidandruff <b>shampoos</b> on sebum flow dynamics. Evaluations were made using the Lipometer ©. Two <b>shampoos</b> exhibited a significant effect upon the sebum follicular reservoir, steadily increasing the sebum excretion rate in time. One other product induced a significant decrease in sebum output. Present data give insight into the distinct effects of <b>shampoos</b> on the follicular reservoir function in androgenic alopecia. The resulting sebum flow dynamics may be significantly increased or decreased by proprietary products...|$|R
5|$|Until the 1980s, {{the most}} {{reproduced}} and publicized of Bauer's works were two paintings depicting the princess and the moose from Sagan om älgtjuren Skutt och lilla prinsessan Tuvstarr (The Tale of the Moose Hop and the Little Princess Cotton Grass), published in 1913. The first picture {{is of the}} princess riding on the moose {{and the second is}} of the moose standing guard over the sleeping princess. They were mainly used as pictures on the wall in nurseries. The same tale also contains the picture of Tuvstarr gazing down into the tarn looking for her lost heart, an allegory of innocence lost. Bauer made several studies of this motif. During the 1980s the painting of Tuvstarr and the tarn was used in advertising for a <b>shampoo.</b> This started a debate in Sweden about how works of art, considered part of the national heritage, should be used. In 1999, the picture again appeared in advertising, this time in a manipulated version in which all the trees had been cut down and Tuvstarr seemed to be lamenting them. The award-winning advertising campaign was made by the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation and helped further the newly awakened environmental movement in Sweden. In his biography on Bauer, Gunnar Lindqvist argues that the picture has become too commercialized.|$|E

Herbal ingredients like tea tree oil, rosemary oil, coleus oil, clove oil, pepper extract, neem extract, and basil extract also recorded anti-pityrosporum activity, but their MIC values are much higher than the synthetic ingredients. <b>Shampoos</b> containing ZnPTO and ketoconazole recorded higher in vitro activities than the <b>shampoos</b> containing herbal AD ingredients...|$|R
