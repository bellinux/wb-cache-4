50|$|Truth-value {{semantics}} is {{not without}} its problems. First, the <b>strong</b> <b>completeness</b> theorem and compactness fail. To see this consider the set {F(1), F(2),...}. Clearly the formula ∀xF(x) is a logical consequence of the set, {{but it is not a}} consequence of any finite subset of it (and hence it is not deducible from it). It follows immediately that both compactness and the <b>strong</b> <b>completeness</b> theorem fail for truth-value semantics. This is rectified by a modified definition of logical consequence as given in Dunn and Belnap 1968.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{discusses}} discrete frames as {{an attractive}} semantics for modal logic. We study questions of completeness, persistence, duality and definability. Notions of <b>completeness,</b> <b>strong</b> global <b>completeness</b> {{and complexity of}} dual varieties coincide for discrete frames; moreover, they are equivalent to conservativity of minimal hybrid extensions. The paper also provides some criteria of di-persistence and a Goldblatt-Thomason theorem for discrete frames. 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe present SLDNFA, an {{extension}} of SLDNF resolution for abductive reasoning on abductive logic programs. SLDNFA solves the floundering abduction problem: nonground abductive atoms can be selected. SLDNFA also provides a partial solution for the floundering negation problem. Different abductive answers {{can be derived from}} an SLDNFA refutation; these answers provide different compromises between generality and comprehensibility. Two extensions of SLDNFA are proposed that satisfy <b>stronger</b> <b>completeness</b> results. The soundness of SLDNFA and its extensions is proved. Their completeness for minimal solutions with respect to implication, cardinality, and set inclusion is investigated. The formalization of SLDNFA presented here is an update of an older version and does not rely on skolemization of abductive atoms...|$|R

5000|$|The {{notion of}} MTL-algebra {{is in fact}} so defined that MTL-algebras form the class of all algebras for which the logic MTL is sound. Furthermore, the <b>strong</b> <b>completeness</b> theorem holds: ...|$|E
50|$|The strongest form of {{completeness}} is {{the existence}} of all suprema and all infima. The posets with this property are the complete lattices.

40|$|AbstractLoop {{checking}} is {{a mechanism}} for pruning infinite SLD-derivations. In (Bol, Apt and Klop, 1991) simple loop checks were introduced and their soundness, completeness and relative strength was studied. Since no sound and complete simple loop check exists {{even in the absence}} of function symbols, subclasses of programs were determined for which the (sound) loop checks introduced by Bol are complete. In this paper, the Generalization Theorem is proved. This theorem presents a method to extend (under certain conditions) a class of programs for which a given loop check is complete to a larger class, for which the loop check is still complete. Then this theorem is applied to the results of Bol, giving rise to <b>stronger</b> <b>completeness</b> theorems. It appears that unnecessary complications in the proof of the theorem can be avoided by introducing a normal form for SLD-derivations, allowing only certain most general unifiers. This normal form might have other applications than those in the area of loop checking...|$|R
40|$|In {{the strong}} {{operator}} topology, the space $K(X, Y) $ of compact operators between two Banach spaces X, Y is not complete, not even sequentially complete. It is, however, Mackey complete, i. e., every bounded closed absolutely convex subset is a Banach disk (cf. [4]). In this paper {{we show that}} $K(X, Y) $, with the strong operator topology, has a <b>stronger</b> <b>completeness</b> property, namely the convex compactness property (see the definition below). This property is also true for the space of weakly compact operators ([9]). These considerations concerning the convex compactness property of $K(X, Y) $ and of other subspaces of $L(X, Y) $ (the space of all continuous linear operators) in the strong operator topology were motivated by the paper of Weis [11]. They originated from {{the context of the}} perturbation theory of $C 0 $-semigroups, in particular from the application to the neutron transport equation. We refer to [11] {{as well as to the}} references quoted there for motivation...|$|R
50|$|An infinitary {{logic is}} a logic that allows {{infinitely}} long statements and/or infinitely long proofs. Some infinitary logics {{may have different}} properties from those of standard first-order logic. In particular, infinitary logics may fail to be compact or complete. Notions of compactness and completeness that are equivalent in finitary logic sometimes are not so in infinitary logics. Therefore for infinitary logics, notions of strong compactness and <b>strong</b> <b>completeness</b> are defined. This article addresses Hilbert-type infinitary logics, as these have been extensively studied and constitute the most straightforward extensions of finitary logic. These are not, however, the only infinitary logics that have been formulated or studied.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Canonical {{models are}} of central {{importance}} in modal logic, in particular as they witness <b>strong</b> <b>completeness</b> and hence compactness. While the canonical model construction is well understood for Kripke semantics, non-normal modal logics often present subtle difficulties – {{up to the}} point that canonical models may fail to exist, as is the case e. g. in most probabilistic logics. Here, we present a generic canonical model construction in the semantic framework of coalgebraic modal logic, which pinpoints coherence conditions between syntax and semantics of modal logics that guarantee <b>strong</b> <b>completeness.</b> We apply this method to reconstruct canonical model theorems that are either known or folklore, and moreover instantiate our method to obtain new <b>strong</b> <b>completeness</b> results. In particular, we prove <b>strong</b> <b>completeness</b> of graded modal logic with finite multiplicities, and of the modal logic of exact probabilities. In modal logic, completeness proofs come in two flavours: weak completeness, i. e. derivability of all universally valid formulas, is often proved using finite model constructions, and <b>strong</b> <b>completeness,</b> which additionally allows for a possibly infinite set of assumptions. The latter entails recursive enumerability of the set of consequences of a recursively enumerable set of assumptions, and is usually established using (infinite) canonical models. The appeal of the first method is that i...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} the two substructural propositional logics KL, KL+, which use disjunction, fusion and a unary, (quasi-) exponential connective. For both we prove <b>strong</b> <b>completeness</b> {{with respect to}} the interpretation in Kleene algebras and a variant thereof. We also prove <b>strong</b> <b>completeness</b> for language models, where each logic comes with a different interpretation. We show that for both logics the cut rule is admissible and both have a decidable consequence relation. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. As web {{applications}} {{become more}} complex, automated techniques for their testing and verification have become essential. Many of these techniques, such as ones for identifying security vulnerabilities, require {{information about a}} web application’s control flow. Currently, this information is manually specified or automatically generated using techniques that cannot give <b>strong</b> guarantees of <b>completeness.</b> This paper presents a new static analysis based approach for identifying control flow in web applications that is both automated and provides <b>stronger</b> guarantees of <b>completeness.</b> The empirical evaluation of the approach shows that {{it is able to}} identify more complete control flow information than other approaches with comparable analysis run time. ...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well-known}} that Hájek s basic fuzzy logic (BL), Lukasiewicz logic, and product logic are not strongly standard complete. On {{the other hand}} Esteva and Godo s monoidal t-norm logic (MTL) and its involutive extension IMTL are strongly standard complete. In this paper we show that PiMTL (an extension of MTL by the axioms characteristic of product logic) does not enjoy the <b>strong</b> standard <b>completeness</b> theorem like BL, Lukasiewicz, and product logic...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we present Hilbert-style axiomatizations for three logics for {{reasoning}} about continuous-space Markov processes (MPs) : (i) a logic for MPs defined for probability distributions on measurable state spaces, (ii) a logic for MPs defined for sub-probability distributions and (iii) a logic defined for arbitrary distributions. These logics are not compact so one needs infinitary rules {{in order to}} obtain <b>strong</b> <b>completeness</b> results. We propose a new infinitary rule that replaces the so-called Countable Additivity Rule (CAR) currently used in the literature {{to address the problem of}} proving <b>strong</b> <b>completeness</b> for these and similar logics. Unlike the CAR, our rule has a countable set of instances; consequently it allows us to apply the Rasiowa-Sikorski lemma for establishing <b>strong</b> <b>completeness.</b> Our proof method is novel and it can be used for other logics as well. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this article is to show that a certain natural set of axioms yields a {{completeness}} result for continuous first-order logic. In particular, we show that in continuous first-order logic a set of formulae is (completely) satisfiable if (and only if) it is consistent. From this result it follows that continuous first-order logic also satisfies an approximated form of <b>strong</b> <b>completeness,</b> whereby Σφ (if and) only if Σφ 2 ^-n for all n<ω. This approximated form of <b>strong</b> <b>completeness</b> asserts that if Σφ, then proofs from Σ, being finite, can provide arbitrary better approximations of the truth of φ...|$|E

40|$|Starting from a {{decomposition}} {{result of}} MTL-chains as ordinal sums, we focus {{our attention on}} {{a particular kind of}} indecomposable semihoops, namely weakly cancellative semihoops. Weak cancellation property is proved to be the difference between cancellation and pseudocomplementation, so it gives a new axiomatization of Product logic and ΠMTL. By adding this property, some new fuzzy logics (propositional and first-order) are defined and studied obtaining some results about their (finite) <b>strong</b> standard <b>completeness</b> and other logical and algebraic properties...|$|R

40|$|Product Logic Π is an axiomatic {{extension}} of Hájek’s Basic Fuzzy Logic BL {{coping with the}} 1 -tautologies when the strong conjunction & and implication → are interpreted by the product of reals in [0, 1] and its residuum respectively. In this paper we investigate expansions of Product Logic by adding into the language a countable set of truth-constants (one truth-constant r for each r in a countable Π-subalgebra C of [0, 1]) and by adding the corresponding book-keeping axioms for the truth-constants. We first show that the corresponding logics Π(C) are algebraizable, and hence complete {{with respect to the}} variety of Π(C) -algebras. The main result of the paper is the canonical standard completeness of these logics, that is, theorems of Π(C) are exactly the 1 -tautologies of the algebra defined over the real unit interval where the truth-constants are interpreted as their own values. It is also shown that they do not enjoy the canonical <b>strong</b> standard <b>completeness,</b> but they enjoy it for finite theories when restricted to evaluated Π-formulas of the kind r → ϕ, where r is a truth-constant and ϕ a formula not containing truth-constants.

BIST logics are extensions of a logic, BiSKt, which arose in the semantic context of hypergraphs, since a special case of the pre-order can represent the incidence structure of a hypergraph. In this paper we provide, for the first time, a Hilbert-style axiomatisation of BISKt and prove the <b>strong</b> <b>completeness</b> of BiSKt.

This {{is a first step}} toward our conjecture that if X is completely regular, then Cp(X) is domain representable if and only if X is discrete. In addition, we show that if X is completely regular and pseudonormal, then in the function space Cp(X), Oxtoby's pseudocompleteness, <b>strong</b> Choquet <b>completeness,</b> and weak Choquet completeness are all equivalent to the statement “every countable subset of X is closed”...|$|R

We pay special attention to the expansion of the real field by the real and imaginary parts of the hypergeometric function _ 2 F_ 1 (1 / 2, 1 / 2; 1;z) because of its close relation to modular functions.
