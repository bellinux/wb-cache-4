He ordered his troops {{to make about}} 1,000 <b>scarecrows.</b> He then ordered his {{soldiers}} to put their own armor onto these <b>scarecrows.</b> During the night, the soldiers hung the <b>scarecrows</b> down the fortress wall, {{so as to be}} easily seen. Linghu Chao noticed a number of armored black figures in the distance, and ordered his archers to shoot at them, hoping to stop the ambush. When the <b>scarecrows</b> got pulled back over the wall, along with numerous embedded arrows, Linghu Chao realized that he had been deceived.

50|$|The {{appearance}} of the Kunekune {{may be the result}} of confusion with traditional <b>scarecrows,</b> which are found in fields of rice and barley. <b>Scarecrows</b> are seen in Japan as very scary and many local ghost stories claim that <b>scarecrows</b> come to life during the night, or if one stares at them too long. Another possible explanation might be thick fog clouds, which appear over the fields during lunchtime. A third possibility might be hallucinations, created by heat stroke and dehydration during hot summer days.|$|R
