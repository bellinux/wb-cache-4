40|$|International {{trade in}} {{educational}} services has grown substantially {{over the past}} decades. Now it is a billion dollar industry including recruitment of international students, establishment of university campuses abroad, franchised provision and on line education. WTO requires each member nation to make its own schedule of commitments in education services, and to explain its limitations on market access and national treatment {{as well as other}} limitations. In the schedules of commitments, commitments are split into two sections: First, “horizontal” commitments which stipulate limitations that apply to all of the sectors included in the schedule; these often refer to a particular mode of supply, notably commercial presence and the presence of natural persons. Any evaluation of <b>sector-specific</b> <b>commitments</b> must therefore take the horizontal entries into account. Second, specific commitments which apply to trade in services in a particular sector or subsector are listed. This paper examines China’s commitments in education services under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). It provides rough pictures about the impact of China’s commitments on its education services. </p...|$|E
40|$|Although {{services}} are not precisely defined and the relevant economic data are rather poor, the WTO Secretariat estimates that {{international trade in}} services now constitutes some one-third of total international trade. Barriers to these international flows involve a host of national regulations, licensing requirements, approval procedures, ownership conditions, etc. With {{the signing of the}} Marrakesh Agreement establishing the WTO in 1994, the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) established a multilateral framework under which Members make horizontal and <b>sector-specific</b> <b>commitments</b> to free up these barriers. Using a somewhat different approach, the NAFTA also set up a system of commitments for liberalizing services trade amongst the three North American members. Whilst generally recognised as a modest beginning, GATS 2000 in Geneva is now addressing a whole host of general rules and sector-specific issues to further liberalize these streams of international trade. Only relatively recently has analytical work begun addressing the environmental impacts of services at the national level. Services and services delivery have many characteristics which distinguish them from extractive and manufacturing industries. Such differences mean that ne...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates whether TBT {{provisions}} {{included in}} RTAs {{differ from those}} under the WTO TBT Agreement, and, if they do, whether they entail broader commitments. Our analysis covers 238 RTAs, of which 171 include at least one provision, and focuses on the provisions on technical regulations, conformity assessment procedures, transparency, dispute settlement, marking and labelling and <b>sector-specific</b> <b>commitments.</b> We find that all RTAs signed since 2010 systematically include TBT provisions and that the most frequent provisions are those referring to the TBT Agreement and transparency. Moreover, {{even if there are}} RTAs that include new or broader commitments than the TBT Agreement, our study shows that their number remains very limited. For instance, relatively few RTAs have included provisions to better implement WTO provisions in the area of transparency or provisions requiring the equivalence or harmonization of technical regulations among the parties or even the recognition of conformity assessment results. RTAs with a dispute settlement provision that applies exclusively to TBT issues are also very few. These RTAs give in general exclusive jurisdiction to the WTO DSM over TBT related disputes. Finally, also only a minority of RTAs include provisions on new issues such as marking and labelling or sector-specific provisions, typically for electric and electronic products, pharmaceuticals or vehicles...|$|E
40|$|Defence date: 12 December 2016 Examining Board: Professor Petros C. Mavroidis, European University Institute; Professor Bernard M. Hoekman, European University Institut; Judge Allan Rosas, Court of Justice of the European Union; Professor Robert Wolfe, Queen's University, CanadaThe thesis {{focuses on}} the {{liberalization}} of services {{in the context of}} preferential trade agreements (PTAs). The first part develops an interpretation of Article V of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) that regulates the conclusion of the so-called economic integration agreements (EIAs). It is argued that in the context of preferentialism, the GATS does not impose any market access discipline but aims at creating a non-discriminatory trading environment. Special attention is paid to Mode 4 and to the type of liberalization that it covers. In {{the second part of the}} thesis the main elements of Article V GATS (sectoral/modal coverage and non-discrimination) are employed to conduct an empirical analysis of EIAs. The chosen sample includes four of the European Unionﾒs international trade agreements that feature significant services liberalization. The services schedules of these four agreements are reviewed and rated to find out their level of liberalization. In the context of the EU, its services commitments continue, to a large extent, to be determined individually by its Member States. As the thesis shows, significant variations still exist among different Member States both in horizontal and <b>sector-specific</b> <b>commitments.</b> The thesis connects the EUﾒs internal situation to the wider issue of how deep EIAs should be in order to escape claims of non-compliance. It asks the question of how the exact coverage and level of non-discrimination should be assessed in a situation where commitments vary across different states or regions of the same contracting party. No clear answer can be provided but the thesis proposes that in order to be in line with its international obligations, the EU, as well as any WTO Member with internally divided regulatory powers in services, should ensure that when signing EIAs, the commitments of all Member States (or, in the case of other WTO Members, all states/regions/other entities with regulatory powers in services) reach the GATS threshold of substantiality in their level of liberalization...|$|E
