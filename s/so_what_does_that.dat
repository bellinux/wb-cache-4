Boston Globe sportswriter Bob Ryan said of the ABA-NBA exhibition games: [...] "When those exhibition games began, the view in the NBA was, 'Now we'll show those guys.'

40|$|Children {{have often}} been labeled as “natural engineers” whose curiosity about {{the world around them}} evokes {{comparisons}} to skills used by professional engineers and taught to undergraduate engineering students. Building towers out of blocks, taking things apart and figuring how things work are a part of childhood and have been considered to be precursors to engineering thinking. However there has been considerable debate around what engineering looks like for young children. Can young children engage in design and if <b>so,</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> look like? How can we differentiate “design” (especially “modeling” or “create”) activity from normal everyday play?Several design models have taken into account the developmental stages of young children, but they often are based on assumptions and have minimal evidence. In the GRADIENT (Gender Research on Adult-child Discussions within Informal ENgineering environmenTs) study, a collaboration between researchers at a museum and university, we looked at how parents with young girls engage in two different engineering activities in informal settings. The first setting is a Preschool Play dates program for children 3 - 5 years old, where the parent-daughter dyads were asked to build a tower first out of familiar materials (foam blocks) and then out of unfamiliar materials (dado squares). The second setting is a pneumatic ball run that is part of an engineering exhibit at the museum and was focused on children 6 - 11 years old. In each setting, 30 dyads were video recorded, and the verbal and non-verbal segments were open and axially coded for engineering talk and action. We found that children engage in the engineering design process in ways that are similar to other models of the engineering design, that include problem scoping, idea generation, modeling,testing, evaluation and revision. We also found that children engage in both predictive and reflective behavior, and often add context to the problem. However, we want to acknowledge that the way children engage in engineering thinking is different from the way that adults do(especially with idea generation and revision) and we will discuss this further in the paper. This work lays a foundation for future research, as understanding how children engage in the design process can help us understand how children learn engineering design skills, and how people develop engineering design skills across pre-college, undergraduate, and professional practice. The work also has implications for the development of learning experiences in both school and out-of-school settings...|$|E

Misdescription and superficiality are all too common. Unwarranted inferences, rhetorical distortion, and caricatures—all show up too regularly in comparative health policy scholarship and debates.

40|$|A {{systematic}} review, sponsored {{and coordinated}} by the American Occupational Therapy Association, {{was conducted to}} explore the existing evidence for {{the health benefits of}} engagement in occupations and activities among older adults by answering the focused question, “What is the evidence that participation in occupation and activities supports the health of community-dwelling older adults?”. The process involved a team of nine individuals who collectively agreed upon areas of occupations to explore, the search terms, databases for searching, and inclusion/exclusion criteria. The team collaborated with an external research librarian to conduct the literature searches using the pre-determined search terms and databases and compile all potential articles. Each article title and abstract was reviewed for consideration of preliminary inclusion based on inclusion criteria and relevance to answer the focused question. Each article was then reviewed in its entirety by a sub-team for a final inclusion decision. The exhaustive search of the national and international literature across health and social disciplines yielded 98 peer-reviewed journal articles demonstrating the strong relationship between health and occupational engagement. The final 98 articles were reviewed, critiqued, and synthesized into a collective Critically Appraised Topic (CAT), peer-reviewed journal manuscript, and practice guidelines. The review incorporated the breadth of areas of occupation in which older adults engage and the range of health benefits and health risks derived from that engagement. The results of this review demonstrated the multidisciplinary appreciation for occupational engagement and associated well-being and elucidate the health effects of engagement {{in a wide variety of}} occupations and activities. The literature revealed older adults’ participation in occupations and activities could be grouped into the following categories: IADLs, work, sleep, and physical, social, leisure, and religious activities and generated health outcomes including lower mortality rates, reduced health care utilization, declined rate of dementia progression, improved mental health, and lower rates of depression. Additionally, the results of this systematic review support occupational therapy’s historical ideologies and core philosophies linking occupational engagement to improved health and well-being. The findings suggest a increasing opportunities for occupational scientists and roles for occupational therapy in community-based health promotion and prevention efforts to meet the everyday occupational and health needs of the growing older adult population. Questions for Discussion: What responsibility, if any, do we as occupational scientists have to make linkages between occupation and health or any other construct; or is it enough to study occupation in its raw from? Most of the studies in this review were large scale (with thousands of participants gathered longitudinally). Is the mere fact that there was engagement in an occupation enough to draw conclusions about the health benefits without knowing the motivation, experience, or meaning derived from that engagement? If <b>so,</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> mean for the value we place on meaning in occupation?

40|$|The Supreme Court’s {{preemption}} jurisprudence {{over the}} last few decades has been unpredictable to say the least. Preemption defies traditional conservative–liberal alignment, as conservatives are torn between support of federalism and capitalist efficiency, and liberals are torn between support of strong national governance and multiplicity of legal remedies. As a result, justices often “flip” to take positions in tension with those that they take in federalism cases that do not involve questions of preemption. This tension between competing values combined with the complexity of preemption doctrine and the sheer number of values at stake in preemption cases produces great uncertainty. Court watchers and business interests alike have been unable to predict the path of the Court’s jurisprudence. With its recent decision in Wyeth v. Levine, however, the Court has clarified its preemption analysis. Justice Thomas, in his concurrence, firmly rejects an entire line of the Court’s preemption decisions—“ purposes and objectives” obstacle preemption. This rejection is not a sudden development; Justice Thomas has disfavored obstacle preemption for some time. What is significant, though, is the opinion’s frankness and the clarity that it lends to the Court’s past (and future) conflict preemption analysis. While urging the Court to abandon its obstacle preemption doctrine as overly broad and unsupported by congressional authorization, Justice Thomas simultaneously advocates for the expansion of what has traditionally been a very narrow category of preemption: impossibility preemption. Such an expansion is likely made necessary by the gap that would otherwise be left by his rejection of the obstacle preemption category. The natural question, then, is whether Justice Thomas’s expanded impossibility preemption might look very much like the narrow version of obstacle preemption that has been applied by the Court’s liberal bloc for some time. If this is the case, do we now have a firm five-Justice majority applying a unified doctrine to obstacle preemption cases? If <b>so,</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> doctrine look like? This Article sets out to answer these questions through an empirical analysis of the Court’s obstacle preemption decisions. Justice Thomas’s drift to disfavor obstacle preemption has been gradual. Although he did not formally renounce the doctrine until Wyeth, he has presumably been applying a similar analysis for some time. An examination of each of the Court’s obstacle preemption cases {{over the last}} fifteen years confirms that presumption. The analysis shows that Justice Thomas’s decisions very closely parallel those of the Court’s liberal bloc over the same time period. His broad impossibility analysis is thus functionally coterminous with a narrow version of obstacle preemption. Justice Thomas and the Court’s liberals form a distinct and somewhat reliable anti-obstacle preemption bloc. The analysis also shows, however, that because Justice Thomas and the Court’s liberals arrive at their positions through quite different analyses, their bloc is subject to fracture in certain particularly contentious cases. Part II presents a brief overview of the Court’s current preemption doctrine. Part III details the breakdown of traditional left–right voting blocs in preemption cases and the consequent failure of political voting models to explain the Court’s preemption jurisprudence. Part IV uses the recent Wyeth v. Levine decision as a lens through which to view the Court’s peculiar voting patterns in obstacle preemption cases. Part V presents an empirical analysis of the Court’s obstacle preemption cases over the last fifteen years. The data show an emerging five-Justice voting bloc opposed to obstacle preemption resulting from the surprising alignment of Justice Thomas with the Court’s liberal wing. Finally, Part VI identifies the factors that the loosely aligned voting bloc finds most relevant to its preemption decisions, exposes weak points in the bloc where fracture is likely, and discusses how recent appointments will affect voting alignments...|$|E

This is a terrible thought, for if <b>so,</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> it mean <b>that</b> he could control the wolves, as he did, by only holding up his hand for silence? How was it that all the people at Bistritz and on the coach had some terrible fear for me? What meant the giving of the crucifix, of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash? ...|$|R
5000|$|On 7 October (second day of film release) a {{story was}} {{reported}} that O21 got booed off the screens from two of the single screen cinemas in Karachi; Bambino and Capri. It got replaced in all its shows by Bang Bang! and Na Maloom Afraad, as people started protesting and throwing bottles on screen as the film did not exactly {{live up to their}} expectation. Aayan Mirza of Galaxy Lollywood investigated the case by talking with industry insiders and blamed it on film's distributor Distribution Club and wrote [...] "They don’t care whether the film is Pakistani or not, they are merely concerned with their business, <b>so</b> <b>what</b> they <b>do</b> is <b>that</b> the moment they suspect that their Pakistani release might not be as successful on a particular cinema as they had previously thought it to be, they would reach out to the management of that cinema and will have it replaced there completely with one of their own Indian films. To them, it is no money lost, and to cinemas it is healthy occupancy." [...] Further added [...] "This isn’t the first time it has happened, and Distribution Club has been doing it for long. They did the same with Ishq Khuda, with Sultanat and now O21." ...|$|R
2500|$|Since the {{publication}} of his first book, My Story in 1975, he claimed that his wealth originated from being commissioned as a mineral-dowser and not from bending spoons and forks. In 2007, skeptics observed that Geller appeared to have dropped his claims <b>that</b> he <b>does</b> not perform magic tricks. Randi highlighted a quotation from the November 2007 issue of the magazine Magische Welt (Magic World) in which Geller said: [...] "I'll no longer say that I have supernatural powers. I am an entertainer. I want to do a good show. My entire character has changed." [...] In a later interview, Geller told Telepolis, [...] "I said to this German magazine, <b>so</b> <b>what</b> I <b>did</b> say, <b>that</b> I changed my character, {{to the best of my}} recollection, and I no longer say <b>that</b> I <b>do</b> supernatural things. It doesn't mean that I don't have powers. It means that I don't say 'it's supernatural', I say 'I'm a mystifier!' That's what I said. And the skeptics turned it around and said, 'Uri Geller said he's a magician!' I never said that." [...] In that interview, Geller further explained that when he is asked how he does his stunts, he tells children to [...] "Forget the paranormal. Forget spoon bending! Instead of that, focus on school! Become a positive thinker! Believe in yourself and create a target! Go to university! Never smoke! And never touch drugs! And think of success!" ...|$|R
3000|$|The {{practitioners}} find {{it important}} to explore how the repetitive work of picking during a whole day influences workers and their performance. Occurrence of discrepancies {{may be one of}} the impacts. Research in this area is missing in the literature, but is in practitioners’ interest, as interviewee 1 mentions: “That is probably a minor problem we have, which has been always spoken about as being a major problem”; “it would be very interesting to see how you can oil the mind of the picker, make work smoother and more correct; and not only correct but also faster, just by providing the right tools.” In line with the goal of reducing discrepancies, interviewee 11 pinpoints the required training and motivation; interviewee 5 clarifies “there is a lot to do since in a warehouse you can see quite a lot of unmotivated personnel. I think a cultural change is needed here to lift the organization and individuals to be more productive by being happier and more content with work and their position.” Employees’ health is another important concern which is mentioned by interviewee 8 regarding cold storage area: “One problem is the sickness level of the labor which we think is high (6 – 7  %) and it costs both time and money to handle a high number like this”; he also continues from a staffing point of view: “we have an aim for a certain percentage of female employees but it is difficult due to the problem of having heavy work. It is not easy to handle all the weight. <b>So</b> <b>what</b> we <b>do</b> is <b>that</b> we try to rotate and we also use external labor on the heaviest parts.” [...]...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{sets out}} to answer three questions: what caused the IMF's {{apparent}} crisis of legitimacy {{in the aftermath of}} the Asian crisis, why were the subsequent reforms <b>so</b> limited and <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> apparent paradox tell us about the politics of IMF policy-making? Criticism of the Fund's role in Asia was largely criticism of Fund performance but the performance issues fed into pre-existing difficulties with the relationship between the Fund's role and its institutional structures. Essentially, the Fund's role had expanded in developing countries and contracted in developed countries but its institutions remained unchanged. The result was a growing imbalance between institutions designed to ensure IMF technical authority and an increasing need for more political kinds of legitimacy. The increasingly intrusive nature of Fund conditionality has also changed the audiences for Fund legitimacy claims as cooperation from domestic populations became more important to secure implementation. The first part of the thesis explores these developments providing an analysis of the logic of the ll iF's traditional legitimating justifications and a historical view of its evolution over time. The second part of the thesis examines the political consequences of these growing tensions in the context of the Asian crisis. Through four case studies (Indonesia, Malaysia, Korea and the US) it explores the nature of the new conditionality, the politics of programme implementation, forms of political resistance that materialised, and the nature of the relationship between the Fund, states and civil society. It argues that moves to engage civil society have created some modest successes but are ultimately limited by the overall institutional framework within which they operate. Internally, the Fund remains an institution dominated by developed countries despite being principally responsible for developing country policy. It is also dominated by financial elites in both developing and developed countries. Legitimacy is about the credibility of authority claims but the poütical significance of those claims lies in the extent to which they are able to attract political support and trigger political resistance. A combination of modest reforms, new arguments and public ambivalence or incomprehension have currently reduced political dissent but the possibility of further resistance, and therefore reform, in the face of subsequent crises persists while institutions remain unreformed...|$|R
