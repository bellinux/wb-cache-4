25|$|The <b>solitary</b> <b>tinamou,</b> {{limited to}} the Atlantic forests of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina, is {{threatened}} by habitat destruction and hunting. In the cloud forests of northern South America, there are fewer than 10,000 black tinamous left. The tepui tinamou's range is {{limited to the}} tops of a handful of plateaus in the cloud forests of Venezuela, making it highly vulnerable to any threat.|$|E
25|$|Identification of {{tinamous}} {{is not an}} easy task; utilizing {{their calls}} as a tool is integral. Each species has its own unique call or calls. The <b>solitary</b> <b>tinamou</b> has 11 different vocalizations. In most species both sexes call; some have different calls for males and females. Females tend to have deeper voices. Some species, in particular members of Crypturellus, have regional dialects. Male slaty-breasted tinamous have calls unique enough to be individually recognized by humans.|$|E
25|$|Major {{threats are}} habitat {{fragmentation}} and destruction. Although they are hunted throughout their range, it generally {{has little or}} only localized impact on the populations of the more widespread and common species. Pesticides are a problem throughout the grasslands and farmlands. The International Union for Conservation of Nature classifies seven tinamou species as vulnerable and seven as near threatened. The <b>solitary</b> <b>tinamou</b> is listed under Appendix I of CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora).|$|E

Some species, in particular members of Crypturellus, have regional dialects. Male slaty-breasted tinamous have calls unique enough to be individually recognized by humans.|$|E
50|$|Some species require regular {{sources of}} water for {{hydration}} while others like the <b>solitary</b> <b>tinamou</b> can survive without a permanent source of water, and will gain their water from the succulent choices of fruit. When drinking, they are unlike most other birds in that they don't lift their heads bill high after imbibing to allow the liquid the use of gravity to help it down. Instead, {{they have the ability}} to suck and swallow.|$|E

50|$|The {{dark water}} rivers {{are home to}} {{freshwater}} turtles and the broad-snouted caiman (Caiman latirostris).Mammals such as the neotropical otter (Lontra longicaudis) and capybara live in the wetlands.The cougar (Puma concolor) is also present.220 species of birds have been identified.These include blue manakin (Chiroxiphia caudata), yellow-legged tinamou (Crypturellus noctivagus), spot-winged wood quail (Odontophorus capueira), southern tamandua (Tamandua tetradactyla).Birds typical of the freshwater marshes include wren-like rushbird (Phleocryptes melanops) and orange-breasted thornbird (Phacellodomus ferrugineigula).Threatened bird species include the red-browed amazon (Amazona rhodocorytha), red-tailed amazon (Amazona brasiliensis), aracari and <b>solitary</b> <b>tinamou</b> (Tinamus solitarius).|$|E
50|$|These birds, {{like other}} tinamous, are ground birds that prefer {{to run and}} walk, but will fly when they must. They differ physiologically by having their {{nostrils}} halfway down their bill or more. They {{range in size from}} the largest, being the grey tinamou at 49 cm and the <b>solitary</b> <b>tinamou</b> at 1800 g, which are also the largest of all the tinamous, to the little tinamou at 21.5 - 24 cm and 174 - 238 g and the small-billed tinamou at 20 - 32 cm and 154 - 250 g.|$|E
50|$|Vegetation {{includes}} forest, restinga and mangroves.The forest includes {{trees from}} 20 to 30 m high, and epiphytes such as Bromeliaceae, Guzmania and Orchidaceae.It supports hundreds of species of mammals, reptiles and birds, many endemic and some endangered.Mammals include robust capuchin monkeys, Brazilian squirrel (Sciurus aestuans) and ocelot (Leopardus pardalis).The giant Atlantic tree-rat (Phyllomys thomasi) is endemic to the Ilhabela restinga.Birds include toucans, pionus parrots, Brazilian tanager (Ramphocelus bresilius), <b>solitary</b> <b>tinamou</b> (Tinamus solitarius), black hawk-eagle (Spizaetus tyrannus), brown-backed parrotlet (Touit melanonotus), penelopes and {{black-fronted piping guan}} (Pipile jacutinga).The archipelago is also a refuge for migratory birds.|$|E
50|$|The {{country people}} of the region {{consider}} that the primates in the park are good to eat.In 2012 environmental police seized the bodies of two howler monkeys and one southern muriqui.The muriqui, the largest primate in the Americas, is strongly threatened with extinction.In March 2013 environmental police found a hunter's camp with a shack equipped with a stove and kitchen utensils.A monkey that had been cleaned {{and was ready to}} eat was found, and the carcasses of an armadillo, and threatened birds such as <b>solitary</b> <b>tinamou</b> (Tinamus solitarius), neotropical bellbird and toucans.The hunters escaped into the forest.|$|E
50|$|The <b>solitary</b> <b>tinamou</b> {{is found}} in lowland humid {{tropical}} forest and montane forests up to 1200 m ASL. It readily inhabits secondary forest and can be not uncommon in extensively used plots, tolerating selective logging to some degree. Large plantations of exotic species are not well-liked. But the birds can be plentiful enough to withstand some hunting for example in a mosaic of cabruca smallholder plantings, interspersed with secondary growth with dense caeté Marantaceae and Merostachys bamboo understorey as well as higher Guadua bamboo and full-grown heart-of-palm trees (Euterpe edulis). In little-disturbed Dense Ombrophyllous Montane Forest ecotone, thriving populations may exist in forest fragments as small as 1,000 acres (400 ha).|$|E
50|$|The little tinamou is {{approximately}} 22 to(-) 24 cm long and weighs 220 g. This species is a shy, secretive and <b>solitary</b> <b>tinamou.</b> Although it looks {{similar to other}} ground-dwelling birds like quail and grouse, it is completely unrelated to those groups. This is a dumpy bird recognised by its small size and lack of barring. It has an unbarred sooty-brown plumage, it is shaded to grey {{on the head and}} has a whitish throat. Its foreneck is brownish and it is cinnamon buff on its belly. The female has a brighter rufous brown on its under parts than the male. Its legs can be grey, olive, or yellow.|$|E
50|$|Tinamous {{in general}} are a very loud species, with clear, distinct, and sharp calls that {{reverberate}} throughout the area. These species are no exception. For example, the highland tinamou can be heard from several kilometers through the thick vegetation of the rain forest. Their calls tend to be deep and loud, designed to penetrate the many layers of the habitat that they frequent. They have many different calls and songs, each one serving a different purpose, for example, the <b>solitary</b> <b>tinamou</b> has as many as 11 different vocalizations, most {{of which can be}} linked to pairing, contact calling, or territorial defense. Some species, in particular, the members of Crypturellus have a regional variation in tone of their calls. In fact, some species, like the slaty-breasted tinamou have individually unique calls and can be recognized individually by humans based on these calls. Finally, members of Crypturellus have been known to use regular calling locations.|$|E
