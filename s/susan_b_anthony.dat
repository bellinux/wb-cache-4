5|$|The Elizabeth Cady Stanton and <b>Susan</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Anthony</b> Papers {{project was}} an {{academic}} undertaking {{to collect and}} document all available materials written by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and <b>Susan</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Anthony,</b> which began in 1982. The project has since been ended.|$|E
5|$|Following {{passage of}} the act, a series of test strikes {{depicting}} Martha Washington were carried out to test a variety of gold-colored metallic compositions. Although the act provided for creation of the new coin, it also allowed for resumption of striking the Anthony design until production began on the gold-colored dollar. Nearing depletion of Treasury stores, on May 20, 1999, the U.S. Mint announced that production of the <b>Susan</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Anthony</b> dollar would resume. In total, 41,368,000 <b>Susan</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Anthony</b> dollars were struck for circulation dated 1999. The design was officially retired in 2000, when the Sacagawea dollar entered production.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Gasparro {{expected}} that Congress would authorize his soaring eagle reverse design {{to accompany the}} <b>Susan</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Anthony</b> obverse. However, an amendment introduced by Utah Senator Jake Garn altered the legislation to maintain the Apollo 11 design in use on the Eisenhower dollar reverse.|$|E

5|$|The Mint struck 500 million {{coins in}} {{anticipation}} of considerable public demand, but the <b>Susan</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Anthony</b> dollar was poorly received, {{in part because of}} confusion caused by its similarity in size and metallic composition to the quarter. Despite its poor reception, the coins eventually began seeing use in vending machines and mass transit systems, gradually depleting the surplus. In 1997, Congress passed a law authorizing the mintage of a new gold-colored one dollar coin depicting Sacagawea, but production could not begin quickly enough to meet demand. As a stopgap measure, until the new Sacagawea dollar coin could be issued, the <b>Susan</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Anthony</b> dollar was struck again in 1999 after an eighteen year hiatus; the series was retired the following year.|$|E
5|$|When the Eisenhower dollar coin was {{released}} in 1971, the patch design provided the eagle for its reverse side. The design was also used for the smaller <b>Susan</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Anthony</b> dollar unveiled in 1979, {{ten years after the}} Apollo 11 mission.|$|E
5|$|Special coins {{for sale}} to {{collectors}} were struck in proof finish through {{the run of the}} <b>Susan</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Anthony</b> dollar, and some minting variations are valuable to collectors. However, most circulation strikes remained in government stockpiles for several years after minting, so many of the coins are available in uncirculated grades, and the premium over face value is minimal.|$|E

5000|$|Speaking for the FFL, Clark said, [...] "Feminists for Life is {{cautious}} about the attribution of 'Marriage & Maternity.' In FFL materials, {{it is simply}} said to have appeared in <b>Susan</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Anthony’s</b> publication, The Revolution." ...|$|R
5|$|Stanton {{herself was}} marginalized in the women's {{suffrage}} movement after publication of The Woman's Bible. From that time forward, <b>Susan</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Anthony</b> took {{the place of}} honor among the majority of suffragettes. Stanton was never again invited {{to sit in a}} place of honor on stage at the NAWSA convention.|$|E
5|$|The coin {{was first}} {{suggested}} {{as a replacement}} for the <b>Susan</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Anthony</b> dollar, which proved useful for vending machine operators and mass transit systems despite being unpopular with the public. The Statue of Liberty was originally proposed as the design subject, but Sacagawea, the Shoshone guide of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, was eventually chosen.|$|E
5|$|Section 2 {{protects the}} right to vote only of adult males, not adult females, making it the only {{provision}} of the Constitution to explicitly discriminate on the basis of sex. Section 2 was condemned by women's suffragists, such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton and <b>Susan</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Anthony,</b> who had long seen their cause as linked to that of black rights. The separation of black civil rights from women's civil rights split the two movements for decades.|$|E

5000|$|Coralie Franklin Cook {{was active}} in the woman's {{suffrage}} movement. [...] She was the only African-American woman invited to give an official statement at <b>Susan</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Anthony's</b> 80th birthday celebration. She was {{also a member of the}} Coleridge Taylor Choral Society, and was elected president of the Washington Artists' Association.|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} {{design for the}} smaller dollar coin depicted an allegorical representation of Liberty on the obverse but organizations and individuals in Congress called for the coin to depict a real woman. Several proposals were submitted, and social reformer <b>Susan</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Anthony</b> {{was selected as the}} design subject. The reverse design of the Eisenhower dollar was retained. Both sides of the coin were designed by Frank Gasparro, the Chief Engraver of the United States Mint.|$|E
5|$|As few <b>Susan</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Anthony</b> dollars circulated, many remain {{available}} in uncirculated condition and are worth little above face value. However, some date and mint mark varieties are relatively valuable. The 1981 coins, having been issued only to collectors, are valued above the other circulation strikes in the series. In addition, a well-known {{variety of the}} 1979 circulation strikes on which the date appears nearer to the rim commands a higher price than the regular issue.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Susan</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Anthony</b> {{dollar is}} a United States dollar coin minted from 1979 to 1981, when {{the series was}} {{suspended}} due to poor public acceptance, and then again in 1999. Proposed as a smaller replacement for the cumbersome Eisenhower dollar, several shapes and compositions were tested, but all were opposed by the vending machine industry, a powerful lobby affecting coin legislation. Finally, a round planchet with an eleven-sided inner border was chosen for the smaller dollar.|$|E

The rooms include Kitchen and Heath, Daniel Anthony’s store, the Birthing Room, the Portrait Gallery and the Legacy Room.|$|R
50|$|American suffragist <b>Susan</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Anthony's</b> {{position}} on abortion {{has been the subject}} of a modern-day dispute. Since 1989, pro-life feminists promoted the idea that she was anti-abortion and would support the pro-life side of the modern debate over the issue. However, a number of scholars, pro-choice activists, and journalists have said that this narrative is a case of invented historical revisionism.|$|R
50|$|The 19th Amendment was {{ratified}} on August 18, 1920. The Justice Bell was sounded at {{a celebration}} ceremony led by Katherine Wentworth Ruschenberger {{was held on}} the steps of Independence Hall in Philadelphia on September 25, 1920. Two of <b>Susan</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Anthony's</b> nieces were among the many dignitaries in attendance. The bell rang 48 times, once for every state in the union at that time.|$|R
5|$|Although {{significant}} {{opposition to}} abolitionism existed {{early on in}} Massachusetts, resulting in anti-abolitionist riots between 1835 and 1837, opposition to slavery gradually increased throughout the next few decades. Abolitionists John Brown and Sojourner Truth lived in Springfield and Northampton, respectively, while Frederick Douglass lived in Boston and <b>Susan</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Anthony</b> in Adams, Massachusetts. The works of such abolitionists contributed to Massachusetts's actions during the Civil War. Massachusetts was {{the first state to}} recruit, train, and arm a Black regiment with White officers, the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment. In 1852, Massachusetts became the first state to pass compulsory education laws.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, in {{the spirit}} of the nation's centennial celebrations, Stanton and <b>Susan</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Anthony</b> decided to write a more {{expansive}} history of the women's rights movement. They invited Lucy Stone to help, but Stone declined to be part of the project; she was of the opinion that Stanton and Anthony would not fairly portray the divisive split between NWSA and American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA). Stanton and Anthony wrote without her and, in 1881, they published the first volume of the History of Woman Suffrage, and placed themselves at each of its most important events, marginalizing Stone's contribution.|$|E
5|$|The {{birth of}} her {{daughter}} in September 1857, however, began to reduce the level of her activism. Stone had made preliminary arrangements for the 1857 national convention {{to be held in}} Providence, but because she {{would not be able to}} attend it, she handed responsibility to <b>Susan</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Anthony</b> and Thomas Wentworth Higginson. When the Panic of 1857 disrupted Anthony’s plan to move the convention to Chicago, Stone made the announcement that the next National Woman’s Rights Convention would be in May 1858. Anthony helped Stone arrange the 1858 convention and then took sole responsibility for the 1859 meeting. Elizabeth Cady Stanton took charge of the 1860 convention.|$|E
50|$|The fund paid <b>Susan</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Anthony's</b> salary ($12 per week) {{while she}} coordinated the Women's Loyal National League's massive {{petition}} drive asking Congress to approve {{an amendment that}} would abolish slavery.With 400,000 signatures, {{it was the largest}} petition drive in the nation's history up to that time, gathering signatures from approximately one out every twenty-four adults in the Northern states and significantly contributing to the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.|$|R
5000|$|In July 1923 the National Woman's Party {{celebrated the}} 75th {{anniversary of the}} 1848 Seneca Falls {{convention}} with a pageant and pilgrimage to <b>Susan</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Anthony’s</b> grave in nearby Rochester, though Anthony did not attend in 1848. Alice Paul presented the draft of the Equal Rights Amendment, referred to as [...] "the Lucretia Mott Amendment", for the delegates’ approval at the general conference held at the First Presbyterian Church in Seneca Falls.|$|R
50|$|The Gannetts {{sponsored}} {{the formation of}} the Unity Club in 1889, which was initiated by the Women's Alliance but was open to anyone in Rochester. With as many as a hundred members, it was divided into small classes under the tutelage of the Gannetts for the intensive study of such thinkers as Thoreau, Hawthorne, George Eliot, and the Fabians. The secretary of the Social Topics class, which examined social problems of the day, was Emma Sweet, a member of First Unitarian who was <b>Susan</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Anthony's</b> secretary.|$|R
5|$|After the American Civil War, Stanton's {{commitment}} to female suffrage caused a schism in the women's rights movement when she, together with <b>Susan</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Anthony,</b> declined to support {{passage of the}} Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. She opposed giving added legal protection and voting rights to African American men while women, black and white, were denied those same rights. Her position on this issue, together with her thoughts on organized Christianity and women's issues beyond voting rights, {{led to the formation}} of two separate women's rights organizations that were finally rejoined, with Stanton as president of the joint organization, about twenty years after her break from the original women's suffrage movement.|$|E
5|$|Although {{she enjoyed}} {{motherhood}} and assumed {{primary responsibility for}} rearing the children, Stanton found herself unsatisfied and even depressed {{by the lack of}} intellectual companionship and stimulation in Seneca Falls. Throughout this period of removal from the woman’s movement, Stanton kept in touch with <b>Susan</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Anthony,</b> and writing Anthony’s speeches became one of Stanton’s primary modes of involvement in the movement from afar. Additionally, Stanton often wrote Anthony letters about the difficulties of balancing domestic and public life, especially in a prejudiced society. As another antidote to the boredom and loneliness, Stanton became increasingly involved in the community and, by 1848, had established ties to similarly minded women in the area. By this time, she was firmly committed to the nascent women's rights movement and was ready to engage in organized activism.|$|E
5|$|Although the collector's pieces sold well, the new dollars {{failed to}} {{circulate}} to any degree, except {{in and around}} Nevada casinos, where they took the place of privately issued tokens. There are no dollars dated 1975; coins from that year and from 1976 bear a double date 1776–1976, and a special reverse by Dennis R. Williams {{in honor of the}} bicentennial of American independence. Beginning in 1977, the Mint sought to replace the Eisenhower dollar with a smaller-sized piece. Congress authorized the <b>Susan</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Anthony</b> dollar, struck beginning in 1979, but that piece also failed to circulate. Due to their modest cost and the short length of the series, sets of Eisenhower dollars are becoming more popular among collectors.|$|E
50|$|During {{this period}} of her life, Ball became heavily {{involved}} with the Woman's Relief Corps (WRC), an auxiliary of the veteran's fraternal organization known as the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR). She was a vice-president of the WRC {{and a member of}} its executive board as well as president of its department of the Potomac. She was associate editor of the National Tribune, the GAR's weekly publication, for which in 1906 she wrote <b>Susan</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Anthony's</b> obituary. She also wrote for the Daughters of the American Revolution Magazine.|$|R
5000|$|Even {{prior to}} {{beginning}} her studies, {{she was the}} Missouri delegate to the American Equal Rights Association meeting in New York. After graduating and establishing a practice in St. Louis, she wrote articles for Elizabeth Stanton and <b>Susan</b> <b>B</b> <b>Anthony's</b> publication, [...] "The Revolution." [...] Then, instead of practicing law, she rose to prominence as a suffragist. Like Stanton and Anthony, she opposed the Fifteenth Amendment. Couzins {{was described as a}} riveting orator and lectured across the United States. In 1884, she testified before the U.S. House Judiciary Committee on the legal status of women.|$|R
5000|$|In 2016 Warren put a red, {{white and}} blue sign next to <b>Susan</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Anthony’s</b> grave the day after Hillary Clinton {{obtained}} the nomination at the Democratic National Convention; the sign stated, [...] "Dear <b>Susan</b> <b>B.,</b> we {{thought you might like}} to know {{that for the first time}} in history, a woman is running for president representing a major party. 144 years ago, your illegal vote got you arrested. It took another 48 years for women to finally gain the right to vote. Thank you for paving the way." [...] The city of Rochester put pictures of the message on Twitter and requested that residents go to Anthony’s grave to sign it.|$|R
