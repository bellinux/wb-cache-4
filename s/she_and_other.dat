5|$|Kork married Yekaterina Mikhailovna (born 1894). In June 1937, after Kork's arrest, Yekaterina was exiled to Astrakhan, {{where she}} was arrested on 5 September. <b>She</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> wives of {{executed}} military leaders were moved back to Moscow and subjected to torture and interrogation. On 13 July 1941 she {{was sentenced to death}} and was shot at the Kommunarka on 28 July.|$|E
5|$|A female human {{trafficking}} victim is interviewed {{with her face}} hidden. She describes how <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> {{human trafficking}} victims in Eastern Europe were held in buildings with security cameras, where {{they were forced to}} walk naked down a runway before a group of men who watched under the guise of attending a fashion show. She then describes being auctioned off to the audience members, who she says examined her off the runway as one might examine cattle.|$|E
5|$|Myrrha {{appears in}} the Divine Comedy poem Inferno by Dante Alighieri, where Dante sees her soul being punished in the eighth circle of Hell, in the tenth bolgia (ditch). Here <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> falsifiers such as the alchemists and the counterfeiters suffer dreadful diseases, Myrrha's being madness. Myrrha's {{suffering}} in the tenth bolgia indicates her most serious sin was not incest but deceit. Diana Glenn interprets the symbolism in Myrrha's contrapasso as being that her sin is so unnatural and unlawful that she is forced to abandon human society and simultaneously she loses her identity. Her madness in Hell prevents even basic communication which attests to her being contemptuous {{of the social order}} in life.|$|E

5|$|The {{captured}} wildling Osha, now {{a servant}} of the Starks, is harassed by Theon Greyjoy, who warns {{her that if she}} had been arrested in his homeland the Iron Islands, she would have suffered a worse fate. As Maester Luwin tells Theon to leave her alone after witnessing Theon's sexual advance on her, he asks Osha why <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> wildlings are coming south from the Wall. She reveals they were fleeing from the White Walkers, who have apparently returned after millennia of slumber, and declares that every army in the Seven Kingdoms should be marching north to confront that threat.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} commences with Inna wearing a pink leotard, {{following}} which <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> women practice pole dancing. Subsequently, the singer appears in black hotpants and a blonde blouse {{in front of}} a neon-lightened X sign in the background, flirting with one male. For the first refrain, she and her background dancers perform hand choreography. Following this, Inna and others are seen on {{what appears to be a}} runaway, with rain coming out from above; similar neon signs are shown in the background. After Yandel's cameo appearance, the video ends with Inna and her dancers further performing to the track. Cut scenes show the singer dancing and performing a slut drop {{in front of a}} wet glass surface.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of the Balkan Wars, Prince Andrew was {{reinstated}} in the army and Princess Andrew acted as a nurse, assisting at operations and setting up field hospitals, work for which King George V awarded her the Royal Red Cross in 1913. During World War I, her brother-in-law, King Constantine of Greece, followed a neutrality policy despite the democratically elected government of Venizelos supporting the Allies. Princess Andrew and her children were forced to shelter in the palace cellars during the French bombardment of Athens on 1 December 1916. By June 1917, the King's neutrality policy had become so untenable that <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> members of the Greek royal family were forced into exile when her brother-in-law abdicated. For the next few years, most of the Greek royal family lived in Switzerland.|$|E
50|$|Fink {{has also}} {{represented}} <b>other</b> prisoners <b>and</b> political radicals. In 1989, <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>others</b> secured acquittals {{for members of}} the Ohio 7, political radicals who were charged under a federal seditious conspiracy statute.|$|R

5|$|Bryant became {{familiar}} with the socialist journal The Masses through Portland resident and lawyer C. E. S. Wood, who eventually married Field and who often contributed to the magazine. Enthusiastic about its contents, particularly articles by Portland native John Reed, Bryant began raising subscriptions for it. Emma Goldman, a well-known anarchist whom Wood had defended in court, gave a speech in Reed's honor at the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) hall in Portland. <b>She</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> political activists, such as Alexander Berkman, were among guests entertained by Bryant and her husband. In 1914, Reed, a Harvard graduate and established writer who by then lived in Greenwich Village, came home for a visit, during which he spoke at the University Club of Portland against the class system. Exactly how or when or how often Bryant and Reed met is uncertain, but near Christmas 1915 when Reed again came home to visit his widowed mother, the young couple announced their love at a dinner party. Reed returned to Greenwich Village on December 28, and Bryant, abandoning her marriage, followed him three days later. Trullinger filed for divorce, which was granted in July 1916, on grounds of desertion.|$|E
5|$|Pankhurst {{was spared}} further {{force-feeding}} attempts after this incident, but {{she continued to}} violate the law and – when imprisoned – starve herself in protest. During the following two years she was arrested numerous times but was frequently released after several days because of her ill-health. Later, the Asquith government enacted the Cat and Mouse Act, which allowed similar releases for other suffragettes facing ill-health due to hunger strikes. Prison officials recognised the potential public relations disaster that would erupt if the popular WSPU leader were force-fed or allowed to suffer extensively in jail. Still, police officers arrested her during talks and as she marched. She tried to evade police harassment by wearing disguises and eventually the WSPU established a jujutsu-trained female bodyguard squad to physically protect her against the police. <b>She</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> escorts were targeted by police, resulting in violent scuffles as officers tried to detain Pankhurst.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, the Queen {{was ranked}} 24th in the 100 Greatest Britons poll. In 1997, <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> {{members of the}} royal family were {{perceived}} in the tabloid press as cold and unfeeling when they did not participate in the public outpouring of grief at the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. The Queen ignored precedent to bow to Diana's coffin as it passed Buckingham Palace and also gave a live television broadcast paying tribute to Diana.|$|E
50|$|She {{says that}} her real name is Karsta Wor-Ul <b>and</b> that <b>she</b> was a soldier under Admiral Dru-Zod until, generations ago, the Kryptonian {{government}} decided {{to shut down the}} Kryptonian Empire. Refusing to yield, <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>others</b> fled.|$|R

25|$|Batwoman and Bat-Girl {{were created}} to be romantic {{interests}} for Batman and Robin, respectively, as well as wannabe crime-fighting associates. Bat-Girl appeared seven times between 1961 and 1964, but then disappeared in 1964 (along with Batwoman, Ace the Bat-Hound, and Bat-Mite) when new Batman editor, Julius Schwartz, decided <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> characters were too silly. It has been suggested by scholars that the characters of Batwoman (in 1956) and Bat-Girl (in 1961) were introduced in part to refute allegations of homosexuality in Batman comics; specifically, the enduring claim that Batman and Robin were homosexuals.|$|E
