40|$|Let us {{now turn}} to an {{argument}} designed to show that mind-body supervenience itself leads to apparent difficulties with mental causation, ” <b>says</b> <b>Kim</b> (1998 : 39). This {{is something of a}} reversal, for Kim (1984 : 103) had earlier argued that supervenient causation is a legitimate form of causation. I prefer Kim’s earlier way of thinking. The problem that Kim, in his more recent writings, sees emerging from supervenience is that of causal exclusion. But I think that supervenience by itself does not entail causal exclusion. Belief that it does betrays a metaphysical prejudice that some empirically-informed reflection may help remove. In this paper I take an empirical perspective toward Kim’s arguments for causal exclusion and conclude that, from this perspective, supervenience does not have the dire consequences for causal explanation in the specials sciences that Kim thinks it does. The argument to which Kim refers is this (1998 : 38 - 47) : 1) Suppose that minds supervene on brains. 2) Consider a case in which an instance of mental property M causes an instance of M*. 3) By (1), M * has supervenience base P*. 4) But then, by (2) and (3), there are two reasons M * is instantiated: because M caused i...|$|E

40|$|Pacific Northwest wheat growers {{now have}} added {{insurance}} against outbreaks of yield-robbing fungi, thanks to Cara, a soft, white, winter club wheat cultivar {{developed by the}} Agricultural Research Service that boasts high levels of disease resistance and outstanding flour quality. Washington State accounts for 77 percent, or 230, 000 acres, of the entire U. S. club wheat crop, with the remainder produced in Oregon and Idaho. Much of the acreage in Washington and Oregon is planted with three cultivars: Bruehl, Cara, and Chukar. Spring-sown club wheat cultivars JD and Eden are grown on another 11, 000 acres. Although several other winter club wheats are available, there’s been a push to broaden the specialty crop’s genetic diversity, especially amid the latest fungal disease flare-up. “Recently, we’ve had severe epidemics of stripe rust, which is able to mutate rapidly and overcome the resistance that’s present in the current crop,” <b>says</b> <b>Kim</b> Garland-Campbell, an ARS geneticist who coordinates the club wheat breeding program. “We’re correcting former deficiencies, like poor disease resistance, in today’s club wheat and put together a crop production package that’s better than what was available. ” Cara, the program’s latest offering, combined high grain yields and flour quality with resistance to multiple fungal diseases, most notably stripe rust, which has inflicted yield losses of up to 40 percent.

40|$|Nonreductive materialism is the {{dominant}} position {{in the philosophy of}} mind. The global supervenience of the mental on the physical has been thought by some to capture the central idea of nonreductive materialism: that mental properties are ultimately dependent on, but irreducible to, physical properties. But Jaegwon Kim has argued that global psycho-physical supervenience does not provide the materialist with the desired dependence of the mental on the physical, and in general that global supervenience is too weak to be an interesting dependence relation. We argue that these arguments are unsound. Along the way, we clarify the relationship between global and strong supervenience, and show clearly what sort of dependence global supervenience provides. In recent years many philosophers have defended nonreductive materialism. According to this view, the special sciences are irreducible to physics even though all non-physical facts are determined by (and depend upon) physical facts. The notion of supervenience has played a prominent role in the thinking of these philosophers. 1 To see that this is no accident we need only consider the two main desiderata that supervenience relations are meant to capture: (i) the dependence of the supervening properties on the subvenient, or base, properties and (ii) the irreducibility of the supervening properties (and hence of the sciences that study them). In his recent Presidential Address to the APA, and elsewhere, Jaegwon Kim has argued that none of the standard supervenience relations found in the literature are capable of capturing both of these desiderata. 2 A relation strong enough to ensure dependence, <b>says</b> <b>Kim,</b> will be so strong that it will jeopardize irreducibility. A relation weak enough to be compatible with irreducibility will be too weak to yield dependence. Kim’s conclusion is that nonreductive materialism is not a viable option for philosophers of mind...|$|E
