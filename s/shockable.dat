50|$|To be most effective, {{bystanders}} {{should provide}} CPR immediately after a patient collapses. Properly performed CPR {{can keep the}} heart in a <b>shockable</b> ventricular fibrillation for 10-12 minutes longer.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the end of}} five {{cycles of}} CPR, always perform {{assessment}} via the AED for a <b>shockable</b> rhythm, and if indicated, defibrillate, and repeat assessment before doing another five cycles.|$|E
50|$|Prevention {{includes}} not smoking, physical activity, {{and maintaining a}} healthy weight. Treatment for cardiac arrest is immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and, if a <b>shockable</b> rhythm is present, defibrillation. Among those who survive targeted temperature management may improve outcomes. An implantable cardiac defibrillator may be placed to reduce the chance of death from recurrence.|$|E
50|$|Automated {{external}} defibrillators {{are designed}} for use by untrained or briefly trained laypersons. AEDs contain technology for analysis of heart rhythms. As a result, {{it does not require}} a trained health provider {{to determine whether or not}} a rhythm is <b>shockable.</b> By making these units publicly available, AEDs have improved outcomes for sudden out-of-hospital cardiac arrests.|$|E
50|$|Gradual {{improvements}} {{in the design of}} defibrillators, partly based on the work developing implanted versions (see below), have led to the availability of Automated External Defibrillators. These devices can analyse the heart rhythm by themselves, diagnose the <b>shockable</b> rhythms, and charge to treat. This means that no clinical skill is required in their use, allowing lay people to respond to emergencies effectively.|$|E
50|$|AEDs, {{like all}} defibrillators, are not {{designed}} to shock asystole ('flat line' patterns) as this {{will not have a}} positive clinical outcome. The asystolic patient only has a chance of survival if, through a combination of CPR and cardiac stimulant drugs, one of the <b>shockable</b> rhythms can be established, which makes it imperative for CPR to be carried out prior to the arrival of a defibrillator.|$|E
50|$|Epinephrine {{does appear}} to improve {{short-term}} outcomes such as return of spontaneous circulation. Some {{of the lack of}} long-term benefit may be related to delays in epinephrine use. While evidence does not support its use in children guidelines state its use is reasonable. Lidocaine and amiodarone are also deemed reasonable in children with cardiac arrest who have a <b>shockable</b> rhythm. The general use of sodium bicarbonate or calcium is not recommended.|$|E
50|$|Survival {{rates for}} out-of-hospital cardiac arrests are poor, often less than 10%. Outcome for {{in-hospital}} cardiac arrests are higher at 20%. Within {{the group of}} people presenting with cardiac arrest, the specific cardiac rhythm can significantly impact survival rates. Compared to people presenting with a non-shockable rhythm (such as asystole or PEA), people with a <b>shockable</b> rhythm (such as VF or pulseless ventricular tachycardia) have improved survival rates, ranging between 21-50%.|$|E
50|$|In each {{of these}} two types of <b>shockable</b> cardiac arrhythmia, the heart is {{electrically}} active, but in a dysfunctional pattern that does not allow it to pump and circulate blood. In ventricular tachycardia, the heart beats too fast to effectively pump blood. Ultimately, ventricular tachycardia leads to ventricular fibrillation. In ventricular fibrillation, the electrical activity of the heart becomes chaotic, preventing the ventricle from effectively pumping blood. The fibrillation in the heart decreases over time, and will eventually reach asystole.|$|E

5000|$|Studies {{have shown}} that {{immediate}} CPR followed by defibrillation within 3-5 minutes of sudden VF cardiac arrest dramatically improves survival. In cities such as Seattle where CPR training is widespread and defibrillation by EMS personnel follows quickly, the survival rate is about 20 percent for all causes and as high as 57 percent if a witnessed [...] "shockable" [...] arrest. In cities such as New York, without those advantages, the survival rate is only 5 percent for witnessed <b>shockable</b> arrest.|$|E
50|$|A {{third way}} to {{classify}} ventricular tachycardia {{is on the}} basis of its symptoms: Pulseless VT is associated with no effective cardiac output, hence, no effective pulse, and is a cause of cardiac arrest. In this circumstance, it is best treated the same way as ventricular fibrillation (VF), and is recognized as one of the <b>shockable</b> rhythms on the cardiac arrest protocol. Some VT is associated with reasonable cardiac output and may even be asymptomatic. The heart usually tolerates this rhythm poorly in the medium to long term, and patients may certainly deteriorate to pulseless VT or to VF.|$|E

5000|$|CPR {{alone is}} {{unlikely}} to restart the heart. Its main purpose is to restore partial flow of oxygenated blood to the brain and heart. The objective is to delay tissue death and to extend the brief window of opportunity for a successful resuscitation without permanent brain damage. Administration of an electric shock to the subject's heart, termed defibrillation, is usually {{needed in order to}} restore a viable or [...] "perfusing" [...] heart rhythm. Defibrillation is effective only for certain heart rhythms, namely ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, rather than asystole or pulseless electrical activity. CPR may succeed in inducing a heart rhythm that may be <b>shockable.</b> In general, CPR is continued until the person has a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or is declared dead.|$|E

40|$|Background: Cardiac arrest {{patients}} with initial non-shockable rhythm progressing to <b>shockable</b> rhythm {{have been reported}} to have inferior outcome to those remaining non-shockable. Wewanted to confirm this observation in our prospectively collected database, and assess whether differences in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) quality could help to explain any such difference in outcome. Materials and methods: All out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) cases in the Oslo EMS between May 2003 and April 2008 were retrospectively studied, and cases with initial asystole or pulseless electrical activity (PEA) were selected. Pre-hospital and hospital records, Utstein forms, and continuous ECGs were reviewed. Quality of CPR and outcome were compared for patients who progressed to a <b>shockable</b> rhythm and patients who remained in non-shockable rhythms. Results: Of 753 cases with initial non-shockable rhythms 517 (69 %) had asystole and 236 (31 %) PEA. Ninetyeight (13 %) patients progressed to a <b>shockable</b> rhythm, while 653 (87 %) remained non-shockable during the entire resuscitation effort (two unknown). Hands-off ratio was higher in the <b>shockable</b> than the nonshockable group, 0. 21 ± 0. 12 vs. 0. 16 ± 0. 10 (p = 0. 000) with no significant difference in compression and ventilation rates. Overall survival to hospital discharge was 3 %; 7 % in the <b>shockable</b> and 2 % in the nonshockable group (p = 0. 014). Based on a multivariate logistic analysis young age, initial PEA, and progressing to a <b>shockable</b> rhythm were associated with better outcome. Conclusion: Progressing from initial non-shockable rhythms to a <b>shockable</b> rhythm was associated with improved outcome after OHCA. This occurred despite more pauses in chest compressions in the <b>shockable</b> group, probably related to defibrillation attempts...|$|E
30|$|Conclusions: Aetiology of IHCAs {{on general}} wards is cardiac in 50  % of the events. Ischaemic reasons for IHCAs {{were twice as}} common as <b>shockable</b> primary rhythms in this study. Subjective {{symptoms}} and objective vital dysfunctions often precede general ward IHCAs. However, neither the aetiology nor the presence of antecedents, but low comorbidity, observed arrest and <b>shockable</b> primary rhythm are factors associated with a favorable outcome.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{progresses}} made in {{the science}} of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, there is lack of published works on this area in the Malaysian context. This survey was done {{to look at the}} outcomes of all cardiopulmonary resuscitation performed in Emergency Department (ED), Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia (HUSM). This is a one year cross-sectional study from March 2005 -March 2006. All adult cardiac arrest cases with CPR performed in ED, HUSM were included in the survey. The end points are return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and survival to ward admission. Out of the total 63 cases of cardiac arrest with CPR performed, only 19 cases (30. 2 %) had ROSC after CPR performed on them. Eventually only six patients (9. 5 %) had survival to ward admission. Patients with <b>shockable</b> intial arrest rhythm has a significantly higher chance to achieve ROSC (60. 0 %) compared to non-shockable rhythms (24. 5 %) (p = 0. 025). However, there was no different in survival to ward admission between <b>shockable</b> and non <b>shockable</b> rhythms groups. The survival after cardiac arrest is still dismally poor. Perhaps we should be more selective in initiating CPR especially for out of hospital cardiac arrest.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundValuable {{information}} can be retrieved from automated external defibrillators (AEDs) used in victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). We describe our experience with systematic downloading of data from deployed AEDs. The primary aim was to compare the proportion of <b>shockable</b> rhythm from AEDs used by laypersons with the corresponding proportion recorded by the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) on arrival. MethodsIn a 20 -month study, we collected data on OHCAs in the Capital Region of Denmark where an AED was deployed prior to arrival of EMS. The AEDs {{were brought to the}} emergency medical dispatch centre for data downloading and rhythm analysis. Patient data were retrieved from the medical records from the admitting hospital, whereas data on EMS rhythm analyses were obtained from the Danish Cardiac Arrest Register between 2001 and 2010. ResultsA total of 121 AEDs were deployed, of which 91 cases were OHCAs with presumed cardiac origin. The prevalence of initial <b>shockable</b> rhythm was 55. 0 % (95 % CI [44. 7 – 64. 8 %]). This was significantly greater than the proportion recorded by the EMS (27. 6 %, 95 % CI [27. 0 – 28. 3 %], p< 0. 0001). <b>Shockable</b> arrests {{were significantly more likely to}} be witnessed (92 % vs. 34 %, p< 0. 0001) and the bystander CPR rate was higher (98 % vs. 85 %, p= 0. 04). More patients with initial <b>shockable</b> rhythm achieved return of spontaneous circulation upon hospital arrival (88 % vs. 7 %, p< 0. 0001) and had higher 30 -day survival rate (72 % vs. 5 %, p< 0. 0001). ConclusionAEDs used by laypersons revealed a higher proportion of <b>shockable</b> rhythms compared to the EMS rhythm analyses...|$|E
30|$|Conclusion: Short-term {{antibiotic}} prophylaxis with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid significantly decreases incidence of early VAP in patients treated with mild therapeutic hypothermia after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest related to <b>shockable</b> rhythm.|$|E
30|$|Conclusions: Despite higher {{frequency}} in initial <b>shockable</b> rhythms and lower intervals until defibrillation and resuscitation in the ICU, {{no differences were}} found in initial recovery or hospital survival.|$|E
30|$|Cardiac arrests {{occurred}} in hospital wards show <b>shockable</b> initial rhythms less frequently and later onset of cardiopulmonary resuscitation maneuvers {{than the rest}} of the hospital but similar hospital survival.|$|E
30|$|Paediatric—In {{comatose}} children following resuscitation from OHCA or IHCA with a <b>shockable</b> or a non-shockable cardiac rhythm, {{we recommend}} using TTM to maintain normothermia {{in order to}} improve neurological outcome.|$|E
30|$|Rationale: Seven meta-analyses [14 – 20] and 4 {{systematic}} reviews [13, 21 – 23] assessed {{studies on}} targeted TTM after CA, but none identified separately patients with initial <b>shockable</b> versus non-shockable rhythm. Two studies with patients presenting initial <b>shockable</b> rhythm have been {{retained in the}} analysis [24, 25] and were in favour of the TTM use in this population. These trials (one pseudo-randomized [24] and one randomized [25]) found improved neurological outcome for OHCA patients with an initial <b>shockable</b> rhythm. Several studies {{were not included in}} the present analysis: (1) the TTM trial [26] because of the absence of a group with no control of body temperature, i.e. the trial compared TTM at 33  °C versus TTM at 36  °C, (2) a trial comparing a combination of hemofiltration with TTM versus hemofiltration alone versus no hemofiltration and no TTM [27], (3) clinical trials that assessed pre-hospital TTM. Observational studies, before–after studies, and matched cohort studies found results in favour of TTM use, despite a low to very low level of evidence [18]. International guidelines using the GRADE method and including Bernard [24] and HACA [25] trials strongly recommended the use of TTM for OHCA patients with an initial <b>shockable</b> rhythm to increase survival with good neurological outcome [13]. A recent meta-analysis also supports the use of TTM in this population [14].|$|E
30|$|In {{the first}} cardiac arrest {{simulation}} the patient remained in a <b>shockable</b> rhythm {{for the duration}} of the simulation and required a three defibrillation attempts separated by 2 min of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR).|$|E
30|$|Objectives The aim of {{this study}} was to look at outcome from cardiac arrests {{admitted}} to a tertiary referral service and assess whether the presentation of a <b>shockable</b> rhythm was associated with a better prognosis.|$|E
30|$|R 1.2 Paediatric—in {{comatose}} children following resuscitation from OHCA or IHCA with a <b>shockable</b> or a non-shockable cardiac rhythm, we do {{not suggest}} using TTM between 32 and 34  °C to improve survival with good neurological outcome.|$|E
