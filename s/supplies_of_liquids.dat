40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} how {{liquidity}} premia {{are affected by}} the <b>supplies</b> <b>of</b> various types of assets. Specifically, we examine how the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> government debt affects the real interest rate and the liquidity premium in the economy. More importantly, we examine how the financial sector satisfies the demand for liquidity by transforming illiquid assets into liquid assets, and thereby how the private <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> assets is affected by the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> government debt. We also show that a rise in uncertainty (i. e., risk premia) hampers the ability of financial institutions to provide liquid assets, and hence may lead to a contraction in the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> assets in addition to a rise in the liquidity premium. Hence, this paper establishes a close connection between risk premia and liquidity premia. This feature arises naturally out of our model, and as well seems to be a reasonable characterization of current events. The end result is a general equilibrium model that endogenizes the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> assets and their rate of return. Using quarterly U. S. data from 1950 to 2008, we show that central predictions of the model find strong support in the data. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{considers}} how the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> capital {{affects the}} liquidity of asset markets. The article views the former notion as a technological property of real investments {{and the latter}} as an endogenous property of financial market equilibrium, and describes a channel by which the two are linked. When agents hold more wealth in technologically liquid investments, a marginal adjustment to portfolio holdings alters discount rates less, causing a smaller price impact. Thus, even without intermediaries or frictions, the stock of transformable capital may be a crucial determinant of the resilience of financial markets. Copyright � The Author(s).
