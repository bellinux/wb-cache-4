40|$|Proceeding of: 2005 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record, Puerto Rico, October 23 - 29, 2005 Small animal PET systems {{based on}} {{rotating}} planar detectors posses some interesting advantages for high sensitivity, high resolution imaging. We have designed the rPET detectors based on MLS crystals assembled on a 30 x 30 matrix optically coupled to a flat-panel PS-PMT. Weighted position readout circuits pre-process the 64 {{signals from the}} 8 x 8 anodes matrix, which are digitized using a charge-integrating converter. The amplification electronics, including the trigger ouput for coincidence detection, and the high voltage supply are integrated in a three PCBs stack that forms the base attached {{to the back of}} the PMT. The whole assembly is enclosed in a light tight, lead(Pb) shielded aluminum box. The detectors are mounted on a rotating gantry with more than 180 degrees rotation span. The digitized events are screened and histogramed, and a modified center of gravity algorithm removes from the position calculation those signals with poor signal to noise ratio. Apparent mean crystal size on the 511 keV field-flood images is 0. 6 mm, mean peak-to-valley ratio is better than 8, and intrinsic resolution is 1. 5 mm at the central row, with the energy window wide open.

40|$|This paper compares two {{learning}} processes, namely those {{generated by}} replicator and best-response dynamics, {{from the point}} of view of the asymptotics of play. We base our study on the intersection of the basins of attraction of locally stable pure Nash equilibria for replicator and best-response dynamics. Local stability implies that the basin of attraction has positive measure but there are examples where the intersection of the basin of attraction for replicator and best-response dynamics is arbitrarily small. We provide conditions, involving the existence of an unstable interior Nash equilibrium, for the basins of attraction of any locally stable pure Nash equilibrium under replicator and best-response dynamics to intersect <b>in</b> a <b>set</b> of positive measure. Hence, for any choice of initial conditions <b>in</b> <b>sets</b> of positive measure, if a pure Nash equilibrium is locally stable, the outcome of learning under either procedure coincides.
