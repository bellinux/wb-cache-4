500|$|The Single Eurasian Sky programme, {{administered}} by the Eurasian Economic Commission, outlines {{the creation of a}} single market for air services and a single air traffic zone. The single air traffic zone {{would make it easier for}} airlines to draw up new flight paths, thereby increasing the number of flights flying through the region. Eurasian Commissioner, Daniyal Akhmetov, said that it would be created on a step-by-step basis. In June 2014, Belarusian Airline Belavia stated that it was ready to move towards the development of the Single Eurasian Sky. The terms and conditions of operation in the common aviation market have not yet been agreed on. However, the project is likely to be modelled on the European Union's Single European Sky. The project will reportedly help turn the airspace of the Eurasian Union into a popular transit hub between Europe and Southeast Asia. [...] "We <b>should</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> currently, the aviation companies of Kazakhstan and Belarus are not able to compete with Russia's aviation companies. Therefore, the programme will envisage a phasing, creating a competitive environment and so on", Eurasian Commissioner Akhmetov said.|$|E
2500|$|For example, the Boundary Commission for England {{stated in}} its 2011 newsletter; [...] "The Commission wishes to make {{very clear that}} those with an {{interest}} in the review process <b>should</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> the defined number of constituencies and the 5% electoral parity target are statutory requirements that it must apply and that it has absolutely no discretion in respect of either matter." ...|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "theory of the mind" [...] {{approach}} {{states that}} people with anger management problems tend to be unsteady mentally and {{are not able to}} internalize any blame for their actions. One of the main reasons for anger outbursts is externalizing blame and having a quick impulse to lash out. [...] These individuals need to {{have a better understanding of}} what their actions mean and that they <b>should</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> blaming themselves for problems can sometimes be the right thing to do.|$|E

2500|$|In February 2017, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare {{unveiled}} resource material {{relating to}} health {{issues to be}} used as a part of a nationwide adolescent peer-education plan called Saathiya. Among other subjects, the material discusses relationships and consent. The material states, [...] "Yes, adolescents frequently fall in love. They can feel attraction for a friend or any individual of the same or opposite sex. It is normal to have special feelings for someone. It is important for adolescents to understand that such relationships are based on mutual consent, trust, transparency and respect. It is alright to talk about such feelings to the person for whom you have them but always in a respectful manner. ... Boys <b>should</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> when a girl says 'no' it means no." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2014, the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria {{said that}} ISIL was {{committing}} crimes against humanity. A report by Human Rights Watch in November 2014 accused ISIL groups {{in control of}} Derna, Libya of war crimes and human rights abuses and of terrorising residents. Human Rights Watch documented three apparent summary executions and at least ten public floggings by the Islamic Youth Shura Council, which joined ISIL in November. It also documented the beheading of three Derna residents and dozens of seemingly politically motivated assassinations of judges, public officials, {{members of the security}} forces and others. Sarah Leah Watson, Director of HRW Middle East and North Africa, said: [...] "Commanders <b>should</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> they may face domestic or international prosecution for the grave rights abuses their forces are committing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hanson {{stated that}} Obama's much heralded [...] "reset" [...] of {{relations}} with Russia in 2009 had [...] "empowered" [...] Putin and, in this way, Obama {{was responsible for the}} outbreak of the war in Ukraine in 2014. In 2009, Hanson wrote about the [...] "reset": [...] "...former Soviet republics understand that Russia's Putin has a de facto green light to [...] "readjust" [...] their present-day, [...] "ad hoc" [...] borders—with President Obama about as clear on any future dispute as candidate Obama was about Georgia." [...] In 2014 Hanson predicted that Russia might very well invade Estonia in the near future, stating: [...] "Future targeted states, perhaps like Estonia, <b>should</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> they are slated to play the 1939 role of Poland after the earlier Anschluss and dismemberment of Czechoslovakia." [...] In 2014, Hanson predicted that the Russian-dominated Eurasian Economic Union, which Hanson calls the [...] "Russian Union" [...] would continue to grow, writing: [...] "Soon the Russian Union could dwarf the European Union, as the former consolidates and the latter threatens to fragment." ...|$|E

[...] Then there was great embracing and kissing, and Ayala felt that she was relieved from a terrible danger. She had often declared that no one could make her marry her cousin Tom; but it had seemed to her for a moment that if she were given up bodily to the Tringles no mode of escape would be open to her short of suicide. There had been a moment almost of regret that she had never brought herself to regard Jonathan Stubbs as an Angel of Light.|$|E

Under such circumstances, it was necessary that he must either abandon his pursuit, or that he must operate upon Lady Ongar through some other feeling than her personal regard for himself. He might, perhaps, have trusted much to his own eloquence if he could have seen her; but how is a man to be eloquent in his wooing if he cannot see the lady whom he covets? There is, indeed, the penny post, but in these days of legal restraints, there is no other method of approaching an unwilling beauty. Forcible abduction is put an end to as regards Great Britain and Ireland. So the count had resort to the post.|$|E

There are schools where girls are educated by English ladies. I am not of the sort to make a wedding outside my clan or country, but if I fight to keep Mama Lumra out of the Punjab I will choose my wives out of the Punjab. I desire nothing that is contrary to the Faith, Mother, but what was ample yesterday does not cover even the palm of the hand to-day. This is owing to the spread of enlightenment among all men coming and going and observing matters which they had never before known to exist.|$|E
