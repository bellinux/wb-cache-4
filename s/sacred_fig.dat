5|$|Plants {{including}} {{trees are}} important in mythology and religion, where they symbolise themes such as fertility, growth, immortality and rebirth, and may {{be more or less}} magical. Thus in Latvian mythology, Austras Koks is a tree which grows {{from the start of the}} Sun's daily journey across the sky. A different cosmic tree is Yggdrasil, the World tree of Norse mythology, on which Odin hung. Different again is the barnacle tree, believed in the Middle Ages to have barnacles that opened to reveal geese, a story which may perhaps have started from an observation of goose barnacles growing on driftwood. Greek mythology mentions many plants and flowers, where for example the lotus tree bears a fruit that causes a pleasant drowsiness, while moly is a magic herb mentioned by Homer in the Odyssey with a black root and white blossoms. Magic plants are found, too, in Serbian mythology, where the raskovnik is supposed to be able to open any lock. In Buddhist symbolism, both the lotus and the Bodhi Tree are significant. The lotus is one of the Ashtamangala (eight auspicious signs) shared between Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism, representing the primordial purity of body, speech, and mind, floating above the muddy waters of attachment and desire. The Bodhi Tree is the <b>sacred</b> <b>fig</b> tree under which the Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment; the name is also given to other Bodhi trees thought to have been propagated from the original tree.|$|E
5|$|Despite these measures, the {{conservation}} of Ambohimanga is challenged by human and natural factors. The rapidly growing but relatively impoverished population around Ambohimanga occasionally engages in illegal harvesting of plants and trees from the surrounding forests, threatening {{the integrity of the}} natural environment. The forests and wooden structures on the site are also susceptible to fire. Following the 1995 destruction by fire of Ambohimanga's sister rova at Antananarivo, widely believed to have been a politically motivated arson, rumors have circulated that Ambohimanga could suffer a similar fate. Cyclone Giovanna, which passed over Madagascar in February 2012, caused considerable damage at the site. The wooden shingles of Andrianampoinimerina's house were torn off by the wind, exposing the historic objects inside to damage from the elements. The wooden fence surrounding the Mahandrihono compound was also badly damaged. Worst affected are the plants and trees at the site. Large swaths of endemic medicinal plants and trees in the forest were destroyed. Many of the sacred trees shading the royal city were uprooted, including <b>sacred</b> <b>fig</b> trees around the Fidasiana courtyard and inside the zebu pen. Two of the uprooted trees were of particular symbolic significance, having served as physical anchors for certain royal rituals since the 17th century. Shortly after the storm, OSCAR unveiled plans to plant a substitute fig for the uprooted one that had shaded the sacred stone in the Fidasiana courtyard. Most of the historic jacarandas planted over a century ago under French colonial rule were also destroyed. The extent of damage to the site has prompted traditionalists to demand renewed respect for the sanctity of the site by requesting adherence to traditional taboos put in place by Merina monarchs. These include banning pigs at the site, as well as the consumption of pork, tobacco, alcohol and cannabis {{on the grounds of the}} royal city.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 8) In 1973 {{an archaeological}} team working near the Dead Sea discovered a late bronze age site which they named Tantura. The name {{first appeared on}} fragments found in Hebron and later, in ancient literature in Syria. Artifacts recovered from the preliminary surface survey indicated that Tantura, an isolated culture, dated from 1, 500 B. c. ?? 50. In 1974 the archaeological team, funded {{by a grant from}} the Institut Biblique D'Arche'ologie, Lyon, France, returned to the site to begin preliminary excavations. Tantura is situated in and on the cliffs overlooking the western shore of the Dead Sea, between Qumran and Ein Gedi, on the border of the Judean Wilderness (see fig. 1). The barren hills of the Wilderness are cut by deep ravines which wind through the rocky slopes down to the Dead Sea. Numerous caves open up on the face of the steep cliffs. The village of Tantura (see fig. 2) is on the plateau and is located between two dry river-beds, the larger Wadi Tantura and the Wadi Ab. There are indications that Tanturians built stone darns across the once running rivers to trap soil and rainwater for farming. Tantura came to light when a cave was discovered containing fragments of a culture that had disappeared centuries ago. Similar pieces had shown up in several disparate locations throughout the area and through careful study it was determined that all these artifacts emanated from one culture [...] -Tantura. The first discovery to be made was at Site I and includes the two <b>sacred</b> caves (see <b>fig.</b> 2). These caves are situated in the cliffs and are reached by a small path leading from the tops of the cliffs. The Burial cave (which has been surveyed, but not yet excavated) lies to the west of the Ritual Cave. The two caves are joined by a narrow, natural passageway. The Ritual Cave contains a large, stone altar and has yielded numerous artifacts (see figs. 4 - 7). The seriation of artifacts from the Ritual Cave (dating from 1, 500 B. C. ?? 50 through 1, 00 B. C. ?? 50) indicates that the Tanturian culture had its beginnings in these caves, and did not evolve and expand to the cliff top (Site II) until sometime after 1, 375 B. C. (See more in text...|$|R
40|$|The study investigates how {{religious}} principles {{govern the}} treatment of light/darkness in sacred monument. Specifically, a digitized daylight simulation {{is used in the}} analysis of Brihadeshvara Hindu Temple, built in 1010 AD in Tanjore, Tamilnadu, India. This sacred monument, listed as one of UNESCO's World Heritage Sites, is an intriguing case study since {{the treatment of}} the 'holy light' in the temple is the treatment of the 'holy darkness'. In spite of the importance given to sun in ancient Hindu scriptures, natural light was used very sparsely in Hindu temples. According to Hindu religious belief, when a worshipper is {{in the presence of the}} divine, there should be nothing to distract his/her senses (including vision). Therefore, the innermost sanctum is shrouded in total darkness and the progression into the temple is a ritual movement where the devotee goes through the dynamic experience of the darkening spaces of the temple before reaching the dark <b>sacred</b> chamber (see <b>Fig.</b> 1). The dictation of the Hindu faith to create this spiritual procession toward the 'holy darkness' is examined in the historic Brihadeshvara Temple by using Lightscape [...] computerized lighting simulation software. To run the program, a 3 -D CAD surface model of the temple was created and imported into Lightscape. Then the model was assigned materials and its openings and lighting systems were defined. The simulations were run on four interior horizontal (floor) and vertical (walls) surfaces, along four spaces of the procession in the temple. The simulation targeted three time frames: sunrise, sunset and at high noon on March 21 st (the equinox). The location of Tanjore, India was used for light conditions. The Lightscape simulations used the process of radiosity to generate single frame daylight renderings along with light analysis of each surface. A lighting animation was then produced in Quick Time. The results of this analysis demonstrate that the average illumination values for specific surfaces of the temple along the procession sequence correspond to the schematic expectation depicted in Figure 1, i. e., a progressively decreased luminance towards the dark innermost chamber. Furthermore, the simulated values were compared to the Illuminating Engineering Society (IES) standards, which recommend ranges of luminance for specific visual tasks and areas. The comparisons showed that the average luminance in the temple, from the illuminated entrance in the east to the darker chamber in the west, is lower than the IES standards for 'public places with dark surroundings' for 'short temporary visits'. Finally, a morphological analysis of the temple along accepted daylight design guidelines corroborated the previous findings. The multi-method investigation of the relationship of light and darkness, light and objects, and the designated light quality in the Brihadeshvara Temple demonstrates the strong influence of the specific dictum of Hinduism on the light/darkness treatment in the temple. The paper concludes that digitized media such as computerized daylight simulations can examine the significance of light/darkness in sacred monuments as a spiritual experience. This quantitative investigation can augment the qualitative studies in the field of historic sacred architecture...|$|R
25|$|Sacred or {{symbolic}} trees {{include the}} banyan and the <b>sacred</b> <b>fig</b> (Ficus religiosa) in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, {{the tree of}} the knowledge {{of good and evil}} of Judaism and Christianity. In folk religion and folklore, trees are often said to be the homes of tree spirits. Germanic mythology as well as Celtic polytheism both appear to have involved cultic practice in sacred groves, especially grove of oak. The term druid itself possibly derives from the Celtic word for oak. The Egyptian Book of the Dead mentions sycamores as part of the scenery where the soul of the deceased finds blissful repose.|$|E

2500|$|Plants often {{serve as}} {{images of the}} axis mundi. The image of the Cosmic Tree {{provides}} an axis symbol that unites three planes: sky (branches), earth (trunk) and underworld (roots). In some Pacific island cultures the banyan tree, of which the Bodhi tree is of the <b>Sacred</b> <b>Fig</b> variety, is the abode of ancestor spirits. In Hindu religion, the banyan tree is considered sacred and is called ashwath vriksha ("I am banyan tree among trees" [...] - Bhagavad Gita). It represents eternal life because of its seemingly ever-expanding branches. [...] The Bodhi tree is also the name given to the tree under which Gautama Siddhartha, the historical Buddha, sat on the night he attained enlightenment. The Yggdrasil, or World Ash, functions {{in much the same}} way in Norse mythology; it is the site where Odin found enlightenment. Other examples include Jievaras in Lithuanian mythology and Thor's Oak in the myths of the pre-Christian Germanic peoples. The Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil in Genesis present two aspects of the same image. Each is said to stand at the center of the Paradise garden from which four rivers flow to nourish the whole world. Each tree confers a boon. Bamboo, the plant from which Asian calligraphy pens are made, represents knowledge and is regularly found on Asian college campuses. The Christmas tree, which can be traced in its origins back to pre-Christian European beliefs, represents an axis mundi. , such as the Fly Agaric mushroom among the Evenks of Russia. In China, traditional cosmography sometimes depicts the world center marked with the Jian tree (...) [...] Two more trees are placed at the East and West, corresponding to the points of sunrise and sunset, as described in the Huainanzi. The Mesoamerican world tree connects the planes of the Underworld and the sky with that of the terrestrial realm.|$|E
