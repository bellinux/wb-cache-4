5|$|Cabbage is {{prepared}} and consumed in many ways. The simplest options include eating the vegetable raw or steaming it, though many cuisines pickle, stew, sautée or braise cabbage. Pickling {{is one of}} the most popular ways of preserving cabbage, creating dishes such as <b>sauerkraut</b> and kimchi, although kimchi is more often made from Chinese cabbage (B.rapa). Savoy cabbages are usually used in salads, while smooth-leaf types are utilized for both market sales and processing. Bean curd and cabbage is a staple of Chinese cooking, while the British dish bubble and squeak is made primarily with leftover potato and boiled cabbage and eaten with cold meat. In Poland, cabbage {{is one of the}} main food crops, and it features prominently in Polish cuisine. It is frequently eaten, either cooked or as <b>sauerkraut,</b> as a side dish or as an ingredient in such dishes as bigos (cabbage, <b>sauerkraut,</b> meat, and wild mushrooms, among other ingredients) gołąbki (stuffed cabbage) and pierogi (filled dumplings). Other eastern European countries, such as Hungary and Romania, also have traditional dishes that feature cabbage as a main ingredient. In India and Ethiopia, cabbage is often included in spicy salads and braises. In the United States, cabbage is used primarily for the production of coleslaw, followed by market use and <b>sauerkraut</b> production.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria, often {{lactic acid}} bacteria, such as Lactobacillus and Lactococcus, in {{combination}} with yeasts and moulds, {{have been used for}} thousands of years in the preparation of fermented foods, such as cheese, pickles, soy sauce, <b>sauerkraut,</b> vinegar, wine and yogurt.|$|E
5|$|Cabbages are {{prepared}} {{in many different}} ways for eating. They can be pickled, fermented for dishes such as <b>sauerkraut,</b> steamed, stewed, sautéed, braised, or eaten raw. Cabbage is a good source of vitamin K, vitamin C and dietary fiber.|$|E
5|$|Many cabbage varieties—including {{some still}} {{commonly}} grown—were introduced in Germany, France, and the Low Countries. During the 16th century, German gardeners developed the savoy cabbage. During the 17th and 18th centuries, cabbage was a food staple in such countries as Germany, England, Ireland and Russia, and pickled cabbage was frequently eaten. <b>Sauerkraut</b> {{was used by}} Dutch, Scandinavian and German sailors to prevent scurvy during long ship voyages.|$|E
5|$|Provisions loaded at {{the outset}} of the voyage {{included}} 6,000 pieces of pork and 4,000 of beef, nine tons of bread, five tons of flour, three tons of <b>sauerkraut,</b> one ton of raisins and sundry quantities of cheese, salt, peas, oil, sugar and oatmeal. Alcohol supplies consisted of 250 barrels of beer, 44 barrels of brandy and 17 barrels of rum.|$|E
5|$|As the {{traditional}} method of making borscht with beet sour often requires planning {{at least several}} days ahead, many recipes for quicker borscht replace the beet sour with fresh beetroot juice, while the sour taste is imparted by other ingredients, such as vinegar, lemon juice or citric acid, tomatoes, tart apples, dry red wine, dill pickle juice, <b>sauerkraut</b> juice, or a fermented rye flour and water mixture. The soup is typically flavored with {{a wide selection of}} herbs, spices and condiments. Salt, black pepper, garlic, bay leaves and dill are among the most commonly used. Other aromatics often added to borscht include allspice, celery stalks, parsley, marjoram, hot peppers, saffron, horseradish, ginger and prunes. Some recipes require flour or roux to further thicken the borscht. A common opinion is that a good borscht should be thick enough for a spoon to stand upright in it.|$|E
5|$|High {{levels of}} both {{sugar and salt}} can {{preserve}} food by preventing micro-organisms from growing. Green beans can be salted by layering the pods with salt, but this method of preservation is unsuited to most vegetables. Marrows, beetroot, carrot, and some other vegetables can be boiled with sugar to create jams. Vinegar is widely used in food preservation; a sufficient concentration of acetic acid prevents the development of destructive micro-organisms, a fact made use of {{in the preparation of}} pickles, chutneys and relishes. Fermentation is another method of preserving vegetables for later use. <b>Sauerkraut</b> is made from chopped cabbage and relies on lactic acid bacteria which produce compounds that are inhibitory to the growth of other micro-organisms.|$|E

25|$|The Black Creek {{area was}} {{formerly}} the nation's leader in <b>sauerkraut</b> production. Thus, the village has supported multiple <b>sauerkraut</b> factories {{since the late}} 1880s. One well-known brand was Frank Pure Food Company which purchased an existing kraut plant in Black Creek in 1956. The plant specialized in Frank's Quality Kraut on the village's west side for decades, but later ceased operations in the mid 1990s.|$|E

25|$|The name antiscorbutic {{was used}} in {{the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries}} as general term for those foods known to prevent scurvy, even though there was no {{understanding}} of the reason for this. These foods included but were not limited to lemons, limes, oranges, <b>sauerkraut,</b> cabbage, malt, and portable soup.|$|E
25|$|Demoli Stewed Live Fish is {{one among}} other notable dishes in Harbin, which is {{originated}} {{in a village}} named Demoli on the expressway from Harbin to Jiamusi. The village is now Demoli Service Area on Harbin-Tongjiang Expressway. Stewed Chicken with Mushrooms, Braised Pork with Vermicelli, and quick-boil pork with Chinese <b>sauerkraut</b> are also typical authentic local dishes.|$|E
25|$|Some women consume good {{bacteria}} in food with live culture, such as yogurt, <b>sauerkraut</b> and kimchi, or in probiotic supplements either {{to try to}} prevent candidiasis, or to reduce the likelihood of developing bacterial vaginitis following antibiotic treatment. There is no firm evidence to suggest that eating live yogurt or taking probiotic supplements will prevent candidiasis.|$|E
25|$|Walter de Paduwa on his Dr Boogie {{radio show}} of 11/11/2016 {{described}} (in French) his 1990s visit to Fredericksburg eating <b>sauerkraut</b> at 35 degrees, {{and seeing the}} Nimitz statue but summing up with the somewhat sweeping advice N'allez jamais a Fredericksburg. Il n'y a RIEN a voir a Frederiksburg (Never go to Fredericksburg. There is NOTHING to see at Fredericksburg).|$|E
25|$|As {{its primary}} {{ingredient}} is rye, kvass {{is a good}} source of vitamin B-1 and B-6, magnesium, phosphorus, amino acids, and pantothenate. It is also rich in lactic acid and simple sugars, which contributes to its pleasant, thirst-quenching taste, provides ample calories to fuel physical activity, and may improve digestion, as with other lacto-fermented foods such as yogurt and <b>sauerkraut.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hot {{dogs are}} {{commonly}} served {{with one or}} more condiments. In 2005, the US-based National Hot Dog & Sausage Council (part of the American Meat Institute) found mustard to be the most popular, preferred by 32% of respondents; 23% favored ketchup; 17% chili con carne; 9% pickle relish, and 7% onions. Other toppings include <b>sauerkraut,</b> mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and chili peppers.|$|E

Alcohol supplies consisted of 250 barrels of beer, 44 barrels of brandy and 17 barrels of rum.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} grains in Poland were millet (often made into kasza, {{a type of}} porridge) and wheat. Barley and oats were cultivated, but used mostly as animal feed or for brewing beer. Cabbage (especially as <b>sauerkraut),</b> kale, peas, broad beans, and onions were the most common vegetables. Dill and mustard were almost {{ubiquitous}} potherbs and parsley {{was used as a}} leafy green in stews, as a flavor additive, and applied as a coloring agent in dishes for the upper classes. Beef, pork and poultry (primarily chicken) were the most common meats, with the occasional appearance of mutton and lamb. Game, as elsewhere, was highly prized, but in short supply and usually limited to the high nobility, as hunting licenses were controlled by land owners. Fish was a staple, but unlike Germans, Poles tended only to eat it on fast days when meat was forbidden by the church.|$|E
25|$|A much milder acid than tartaric and malic, {{lactic acid}} is often {{associated}} with “milky” flavors in wine and is the primary acid of yogurt and <b>sauerkraut.</b> It is produced during winemaking by lactic acid bacteria (LAB), which includes three genera: Oenococcus, Pediococcus and Lactobacillus. These bacteria convert both sugar and malic acid into lactic acid, the latter through MLF. This process can be beneficial for some wines, adding complexity and softening the harshness of malic acidity, but it can generate off flavors and turbidity in others. Some strains of LAB can produce biogenic amines, such as histamine, tyramine and putrescine, which may be a cause of red wine headaches in some wine drinkers. Winemakers wishing to control or prevent MLF can use sulfur dioxide to stun the bacteria. Racking the wine quickly off its lees will also help control the bacteria, since lees are a vital food source for them. The winemakers must also be very careful of what wine barrels and winemaking equipment to which the wine is exposed, because of the bacteria's ability to deeply embed themselves within wood fibers. A wine barrel that has completed one successful malolactic fermentation will almost always induce MLF in every wine stored in it from then on.|$|E
500|$|Juniper berries {{are used}} in {{northern}} European and particularly Scandinavian cuisine to [...] "impart a sharp, clear flavor" [...] to meat dishes, especially wild birds (including thrush, blackbird, and woodcock) and game meats (including boar and venison). They also season pork, cabbage, and <b>sauerkraut</b> dishes. Traditional recipes for choucroute garnie, an Alsatian dish of <b>sauerkraut</b> and meats, universally include juniper berries. Besides Norwegian and Swedish dishes, juniper berries are also sometimes used in German, Austrian, Czech, Polish and Hungarian cuisine, often with roasts (such as German sauerbraten). Northern Italian cuisine, especially that of the South Tyrol, also incorporates juniper berries.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the advent}} of beet-based borscht, cabbage borscht was of {{particular}} importance. Made from either fresh cabbage or <b>sauerkraut,</b> it could be indistinguishable from the Russian [...] Indeed, the mid-19th-century Explanatory Dictionary of the Living Great Russian Language defines [...] as [...] "a kind of [...] " [...] with beet sour added for tartness. The significance of cabbage as an essential ingredient of borscht is manifest in the Ukrainian proverb, [...] "without bread, it's no lunch; without cabbage, it's no borscht." ...|$|E
500|$|Kirchherr {{later said}} that she, Voormann and Vollmer {{felt guilty about}} being German, and about Germany's recent history. Meeting the Beatles was {{something}} very special for her, although she knew that English people would think that she ate <b>sauerkraut,</b> and would comment on her heavy German accent, but they made jokes about it together. Lennon would make sarcastic remarks from the stage, saying [...] "You Krauts, we won the war," [...] knowing that very few Germans in the audience spoke English, but any English sailors present would roar with laughter.|$|E
500|$|Game and ham {{are popular}} in Champagne, {{as well as}} the special {{sparkling}} wine simply known as Champagne. Fine fruit preserves are known from Lorraine {{as well as the}} quiche Lorraine. Alsace is influenced by the Alemannic food culture; as such, beers made in the area are similar to the style of bordering Germany. Dishes like choucroute (the French word for <b>sauerkraut)</b> are also popular. Many [...] "Eaux de Vie" [...] (alcoholic distillation) also called schnaps is from this region, due {{to a wide variety of}} local fruits (cherry, raspberry, pear, grapes) and especially prunes (mirabelle, plum).:259,295 ...|$|E

Polish clear borscht may be also {{served with a}} croquette or [...] A typical Polish croquette (...) is made by wrapping a [...] (thin pancake) around a filling and coating it in breadcrumbs before refrying; [...] (literally, 'little [...] ) are variously shaped filled hand-held pastries of yeast-raised or flaky dough. An even more exquisite way to serve borscht is with a coulibiac, or a large loaf-shaped pie. Possible fillings for croquettes, [...] and coulibiacs include mushrooms, <b>sauerkraut</b> and minced meat.|$|E
500|$|Cabbages {{sold for}} market are {{generally}} smaller, and different varieties {{are used for}} those sold immediately upon harvest and those stored before sale. Those used for processing, especially <b>sauerkraut,</b> are larger and have a lower percentage of water. Both hand and mechanical harvesting are used, with hand-harvesting generally used for cabbages destined for market sales. In commercial-scale operations, hand-harvested cabbages are trimmed, sorted, and packed directly {{in the field to}} increase efficiency. Vacuum cooling rapidly refrigerates the vegetable, allowing for earlier shipping and a fresher product. Cabbage can be stored the longest at [...] with a humidity of 90–100 percent; these conditions will result in up to six months of longevity. When stored under less ideal conditions, cabbage can still last up to four months.|$|E
500|$|Mass {{migration}} from the Russian Empire to North America – initially mosty {{by members of}} persecuted religious minorities – was instrumental in bringing borscht across the Atlantic. The earliest waves of migration occurred {{at a time when}} cabbage-based borscht was still the dominant variant of the soup in at least parts of Russia. The Mennonites, who began arriving in Canada and the United States from Russia's Volga region in the 1870s, still eschew beetroots in their borscht; instead, Mennonite varieties include [...] (with cabbage or <b>sauerkraut)</b> and [...] (sorrel-based [...] "summer borscht"). According to the [...] Jewish Encyclopedia published in 1906, cabbage-based kraut borscht was also more popular than the beet-based variant in American Jewish cuisine at the time. Subsequent Jewish immigration helped popularize the red borscht in America.|$|E
500|$|Contemporary {{reviews of}} the Type 1 design were {{generally}} favorable. [...] The New York Weekly Tribune on May 19, 1849 described the new dollar as [...] "undoubtedly the neatest, tiniest, lightest, coin in this country... it is too delicate and beautiful to pay out for potatoes, and <b>sauerkraut,</b> and salt pork. Oberon might have paid Puck with it for bringing the blossom which bewitched Titania." [...] Willis' Bank Note List stated that [...] "there is no probability of them ever getting into general circulation; they are altogether too small." [...] The North Carolina Standard hoped {{that they would be}} struck at the Charlotte Mint and circulated locally to eliminate the problem of small-denomination bank notes from out of state. Coin dealer and numismatic author Q. David Bowers notes that the head of Liberty on the Type 1 dollar is a scaled-down version of that on the double eagle, and [...] "a nicely preserved gold dollar is beautiful to behold".|$|E
500|$|Ramaria {{botrytis}} is an edible species, {{and some}} rate it as choice. Its taste is [...] "slight", or [...] "fruity", {{and has been}} likened to <b>sauerkraut,</b> green peanuts (fresh harvested peanuts {{that have not been}} dehydrated), or pea pods. Older fruit bodies develop an acidic flavor. It is sold in food markets in Japan as Nedzumi-take, and harvested from the wild in Korea and Nepal. The thick base and main branches require longer cooking than the smaller branchlets. In the Garfagnana region of central Italy, the mushroom is stewed, or pickled in oil. Fruit bodies can be preserved by slicing thinly and drying. One field guide rates the edibility as [...] "questionable", warning of the possible danger of confusing specimens with the poisonous Ramaria formosa. Other authors warn that some individuals may experience laxative effects from consuming the mushroom. Caution is advised when collecting fruit bodies near polluted areas, as the species is known to bioaccumulate toxic arsenic.|$|E
500|$|The largest {{facility}} {{in this area}} of the park is The Marketplace – International Buffet, originally called All's Well Hall. In planning documents, it was simply called [...] "Medieval Pub". In the park's opening season guidebook, the facility is listed as selling [...] "bratwurst, sausages, beef and mushroom pie, smoked sausage, grilled frankfurter, <b>sauerkraut,</b> mashed potatoes, soft pretzels, pastries, with beer, wine, coffee, tea, milk, and soft drinks." [...] The self–serve restaurant had table service on request, and seated 528; Ginza Gardens in Grande Exposition of 1890 was the only other restaurant in the park with table service. A review of the restaurant in The Toronto Star describes the facility as the park's flagship eatery, but it received mixed reviews. [...] "The $2.50 beef and mushroom pie has a good crust and as much beef as potato. Tiny mushrooms, but big on flavor." [...] Conversely, 50 cent pretzels [...] "are strictly for teething tots –too cheewy." [...] The Marketplace currently serves an all–you–can–eat buffet, self described as [...] "upscale", offering meats like roast beef and fried chicken, pasta, a salad bar, a desert station, varied international cuisine, and other options. Marketplace has served a Mortal Meal, along with the Backlot Cafe elsewhere in the park, during Halloween Haunt in recent seasons.|$|E
