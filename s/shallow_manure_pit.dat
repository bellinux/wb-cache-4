The chamber represents a geometrically scaled {{model of a}} production swine grower facility. Gas injection was simulated from shallow pits using carbon dioxide (CO 2). The results indicate significant differences in gas concentration between the animal-occupied zone (AOZ) and human-occupied zones (HOZ), especially at ventilation rates representative of mild weather conditions. AOZ CO 2 concentrations were 12 times higher than HOZ during minimum ventilation conditions and six times higher during mild weather ventilation conditions. Large variations in normalized CO 2 concentration were found {{as a function of}} both vertical location from the floor and horizontal location from the inlet, especially at vertical locations representative of the AOZ. Rectangular obstructions, physically representing the overall size of 60 kg pigs, did significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 01) affect gas dispersion at high ventilation rates, but did not significantly (p 3 ̆e 0. 05) affect gas dispersion at low ventilation rates, implying that airflow patterns near the AOZ were significantly affected by the presence of rectangular obstructions at high ventilation rates. The mathematical model provided excellent prediction of the measured results.

40|$|Separation of solids from liquid swine {{manure and}} {{subsequent}} thermo-chemical conversion (TCC) of the solids fraction into oil {{is one way}} of reducing the waste strength and odor emission. Such processing also provides a potential means of producing renewable energy from animal wastes. Gravity settling and mechanical separation techniques, by means of a centrifuge and belt press, were used to remove the solids from liquid swine manure. The solid fractions from the above separation processes were used as the feedstock for the TCC process for oil production. Experiments were conducted in a batch reactor with a steady temperature 305 oC, and the corresponding pressure was 10. 34 Mpa. Gravity settling was demonstrated to be capable of increasing the total solids content of manure from 1 % to 9 %. Both of the mechanical separation systems were able to produce solids with dry matter around 18 % for manure, with 1 % to 2 % initial total solids. A significant amount of volatile solid (75. 7 %) was also obtained from the liquid fraction using the belt press process. The oil yields of <b>shallow</b> <b>pit</b> <b>manure</b> solids and deep <b>pit</b> <b>manure</b> solids with belt press separation were 28. 72 % and 29. 8 % of the total volatile solids, respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT Air {{temperature}} and relative humidity (RH) in the <b>manure</b> <b>pits</b> of five central Pennsylvania high-rise poultry houses were measured {{for at least}} one year to evaluate the role of the pit environment in the development of manure breeding flies and litter beetles. Pit air temperatures had weekly means ranging between 18. 1 and 22. 2 C. Seasonal temperature trends were similar at all farms, decreasing in winter and rising in summer. Maximum pit temperatures ranged from 31. 7 to 33. 3 C and minimum temperatures from. 6 to 5. 6 C, but these extremes were rare. Three houses had weekly mean RH ca 65 %, one ca 61 %, and one ca 72 %. No seasonal RH trends were evident. Daily temperature fluctuations were lowest at ca 0600 to 0700 h, peaked ca 1700 h, and varied inversely with RH. Pit air temperatures dropped below house fly reproductive thresholds for several weeks during the winter, but were adequate for their survival all year around. Manure temperatures were affected by the shape of the manure pile, depth of the manure, and seasonal air temperature patterns. Manure temperatures differed significantly between houses with either shallow (without scraper boards, x ca 16 to 19 C) or deep (with scraper boards, x ca 30 to 40 C) <b>manure</b> profiles. <b>Shallow</b> <b>manure</b> profile temperatures severely limit fly larvae and litter beetle development.

40|$|Within {{this project}} the ammonia {{emission}} from houses for growing-finishing pigs with a paved outside yard was determined on two organic farms {{and in the}} Star+ house at VIC Sterksel.

Within Star+ also measurements at housing level were done. From this study it is concluded that the ammonia emission level from houses with a paved outside yard can be similar to houses without outside yard. This can be realized by a good pen design that enables a reduced area of the <b>manure</b> <b>pit</b> and reduced floor fouling.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the ammonia emissions from houses for growing-finishing pigs with an outside yard. While regular emission measurements are not possible in these open systems another approach was used. Local parameters were measured and used in an existing NH 3 emission model to calculate the ammonia emissions. The following local parameters were measured/determined: total urine fouled floor area, total manure area in the <b>manure</b> <b>pit,</b> surface temperature of fouled areas of floor and <b>manure</b> <b>pit,</b> air velocity above fouled floor areas. Parameters pH and NH 4 -N content were measured by filter absorption of the urine puddles on the floor and the upper layer of the <b>manure</b> in the <b>pit.</b> These measurements were done in 3 pig houses with outside yard and in 2 regular houses, serving as reference. From the results of this study the following was concluded: 1) The floor emission is generally higher in houses with outside yard compared with regular houses, mainly caused by a larger fouled floor area. 2) The emission per m 2 pit surface area is significantly lower in houses with outside yard, especially as a result of the lower surface temperature of the <b>manure</b> in the <b>pit.</b> 3) The determination of ammonia emission in houses with outside yards using locally measured parameters provides a clear methodological perspective.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of specific crystalline AA supplementation to a diet on odor emission, odor intensity, odor hedonic tone, and ammonia emission from pig manure, and on manure characteristics (pH; ammonia N; total nitrogen; sulfurous, indolic, and phenolic compounds; and VFA concentrations). An experiment was conducted with growing pigs (n = 18) in a randomized complete block design, with 3 treatments in 6 blocks. Treatment groups were (1) a 15 %-CP basal diet with 3 times the requirement of sulfur-containing AA (14. 2 g/kg of diet, as-fed basis); (2) the basal diet with 2 times the requirement of Trp and Phe+Tyr (2. 9 and 20. 4 g/kg of diet, respectively, as-fed basis); and (3) the basal diet with AA supplementation to levels sufficient for maximum protein gain. Pigs with an initial BW of 41. 2 ± 0. 8 kg were individually penned in partly slatted floor pens and offered a daily feed allowance of 2. 8 times the maintenance requirement for NE (293 kJ/kg of BW 0. 75). Feed was mixed with water at 1 : 2. 5 (wt/wt). Feces and urine of each pig was allowed to accumulate in separate <b>manure</b> <b>pits</b> under the slatted floor. After an adaptation period of 2 wk, and after cleaning the <b>manure</b> <b>pits,</b> <b>manure</b> was subsequently collected. In wk 5 of the collection period, separate samples were collected directly from each <b>manure</b> <b>pit</b> for odor, ammonia, and manure composition analyses. Air samples were analyzed for odor concentration and for hedonic tone and odor intensity above the odor detection threshold. Results showed that supplementing crystalline S-containing AA in surplus of the requirement increased odor emission (P < 0. 001) and odor intensity (P < 0. 05) and reduced odor hedonic tone (P < 0. 05) from the air above the <b>manure</b> <b>pits.</b> Supplementing crystalline Trp, Tyr, and Phe in surplus of the recommended requirements did not affect odor emission, odor intensity, or odor hedonic tone. Regardless of dietary treatment, all pigs had similar performance levels. No differences were observed in ammonia emission from manure of pigs fed different levels of AA supplementation (P = 0. 20).

Pigs (n = 18) were allocated in a randomised complete block arrangement with 3 treatments in each of 6 blocks. The three treatments had 28. 4, 38. 2 and 48. 0 g fermentable protein per kg of feed. Pigs with an initial body weight (BW) of 41. 3 ± 3. 2 kg (mean ± S.

40|$|The {{mosquito}} species Anopheles plumbeus is {{an aggressive}} biter {{and a potential}} vector of malaria parasites and West Nile virus. It occurs naturally at low population densities, as its larval development is adapted to the specific water qualities found in tree holes. However, probably owing to environmental changes, it has recently been observed in several European countries to use increasingly often artificial breeding habitats {{that may lead to}} mass development and severe annoyance to humans living close by. The perception of mosquito nuisance, however, is very subjective, and breeding habitats are not always known, thus impeding targeted surveillance and control. To relate nuisance by An. plumbeus to specific environmental conditions, a questionnaire survey was carried out addressing persons who had submitted specimens of this particular mosquito species to the German citizen science project “Mueckenatlas”, an instrument of passive mosquito surveillance. The questionnaire was intended to find out whether a nuisance situation linked to An. plumbeus had existed, whether mosquito breeding habitats could be identified and whether control measures had been conducted. Despite some efforts, the participants who claimed to suffer from an An. plumbeus nuisance problem had rarely identified the source of the mosquitoes. Once control measures had been performed on abandoned <b>manure</b> <b>pits,</b> however, the nuisance problem disappeared or mosquito abundance was at least significantly reduced. Nevertheless, no significant effect of abandoned <b>manure</b> <b>pits</b> on the probability of an An. plumbeus nuisance could be demonstrated in a multivariate logistic regression model testing various variables. Instead, a significant positive effect of a disused farm nearby was found. The reason is probably that <b>manure</b> <b>pits</b> as the most frequent source of An. plumbeus mass development are often located on disused farms, without most people’s knowledge about their existence.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of three <b>manure</b> <b>pit</b> additives in commercial scale manure channels and simulated outdoor storage. The additives were American BioCatalysts (ABC), Pit Boss (PB) and Westbridge (WB). Results from two sets of indoor trials were combined to provide eight replicates of each additive. The protocol consisted of manure accumulation, pretreatment and treatment. Air and slurry samples were taken on Days 28 and 35 of the treatment phase. The outdoor phase that followed determined if residual effects resulting from indoor treatment existed. Manure was transferred from the manure channels to outdoor storage lagoons where it was stored in simulated lagoons. Samples were taken on Days 49 and 63. In terms of odour threshold reduction, the additives' effectiveness varied from producing no reduction to reductions of 66 %. The 66 % reduction produced by PB in the outdoor trial was the only significant odour threshold reduction in the experiment. During indoor storage, the additives produced minor odour threshold reductions. The additives were able to promote H 2 S reductions of 14 to 76 % and consistent yet minor NH 3 reductions in the indoor trials. None of the additives produced practical reductions in Total Solids or solubilization that could have improved manure-handling ease. Perhaps the strongest attribute of all of the additives was the ability to maintain elevated nutrients and micronutrient levels. Higher levels of TKN were maintained by all of the additives and the ability of the additives to maintain nitrogen in the available form, especially on Day 35 representing a potential of 9 to 25 % more available nitrogen during field application. Likewise, the additives resulted in 4 to 23 % more P while promoting elevated ortho-phosphate levels during the indoor trial. Improvements in nutrient value were also observed in potassium, copper and zinc results. Only with respect to waste strength reduction was the effectiveness of the additives relatively poor.

For this purpose, an automatic electro-hydraulic depth control system was developed, which minimises the difference between the actual injection, measured by means of an ultrasonic sensor, and the desired injection depth. To minimise this difference the relative position of the shallow slurry injector attached to the four-point linkage at the back of a manure tanker was changed with respect to this tanker. A grey box model was developed for the conversion of the voltage applied to an electronic control unit into the working depth of a <b>shallow</b> <b>manure</b> injector. A simplified and linearised model based on theoretical considerations was developed. The parameters of this model were estimated by means of frequency-domain identification techniques. This model contained all the dominant dynamics of the system that are relevant for control design. Since the dynamics of the system change during manure application, the worst case with respect to the stability of the depth control system was sought by comparing several extreme situations. The case of an empty tanker with the injector above the ground (minimal soil penetration resistance) was found to be the worst case and the model parameters were determined for this case.

In mixed multivariable logistic analysis, the C. perfringens isolates recovered from lactating sows (OR[*]=[*] 0. 069, P cpb 2 compared to the isolates from suckling pigs. The prevalence of cpb 2 in the isolates recovered from weanlings did not differ significantly from suckling pigs. C. perfringens isolates that were positive for cpb 2 were more likely to carry the atypical cpb 2 gene (atyp-cpb 2) (OR[*]=[*] 19, P 0. 001) compared to isolates that were negative for cpb 2. Multivariable analysis did not identify farm factors affecting the presence of consensus cpb 2 and atyp-cpb 2 genes. Conclusions This study provides baseline data on the prevalence of C. perfringens and associated toxin genes in healthy pigs at different stages of production on Ontario swine farms. The study suggests that if C. perfringens type A are involved in neonatal enteritis, there may be strains with specific characteristics that cannot be identified by the existing genotyping system. </p...|$|R
40|$|Odour {{nuisance}} from agricultural {{activities is}} increasing in densely populated countries like the Netherlands. To develop adequate regulations, a large-scale, government-financed monitoring programme {{was started in}} the mid- 1990 s to establish odour emission levels for both conventional and low ammonia emission housing systems for cattle, pigs and poultry. The results indicate that high- and low-odour emission housing are difficult to distinguish {{because of the large}} variation within housing systems. Measurements on different farm locations within the same housing system show both a large variation between locations and within one location (in time). The latter, however, is significantly smaller, which suggests that farm management is an important determinant in odour emission that interferes with the effects of housing systems. The current research was aimed at determining the effect of two common ammonia-reducing pig-housing systems on odour emissions compared to conventional housing systems under similar management conditions. The respective reduction principles of these systems are reducing the emitting surface of the <b>manure</b> <b>pit</b> and cooling of manure in the <b>manure</b> <b>pit</b> (both pits beneath slatted floor). Five farms that combined conventional housing with one low-ammonia system (three reduced emitting surface and two manure cooling) were selected for a direct, pair-wise comparison of (olfactometric) odour emission measurements. The results show a highly significant effect (p < 0. 01) for two of the three reduced emitting surface systems and for one of the two manure cooling system. The average odour reduction percentages of these systems are 35 % (from 24. 9 to 16. 0 OUE/s per animal) and 23 % (from 30. 1 to 24. 0 OUE/s per animal) respectively. Although odour emission reduction through the type of housing system is possible, management factors interact with the system and thereby determine whether the system reduces odour emission or not...|$|R
40|$|Agriculture {{accounts}} for 10 to 12 % of the World’s total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Manure management alone {{is responsible for}} 13 % of GHG emissions from the agricultural sector. During the last decade, Québec’s egg production systems have shifted from deep-pit housing systems to manure belt housing systems. The objective {{of this study was}} to measure and compare carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions from three different cage layer housing systems: a deep liquid <b>manure</b> <b>pit</b> and a <b>manure</b> belt with natural or forced air drying. Deep liquid <b>manure</b> <b>pit</b> housing systems consist of “A” frame layer cages located over a closed pit containing the hens’ droppings to which water is added to facilitate removal by pumping. Manure belt techniques imply that manure drops on a belt beneath each row of battery cages where it is either dried naturally or by forced air until it is removed. The experiment was replicated with 360 hens reared into twelve independent bench-scale rooms during eight weeks (19 – 27 weeks of age). The natural and forced air manure belt systems reduced CO 2 (28. 2 and 28. 7 kg yr− 1 hen− 1, respectively), CH 4 (25. 3 and 27. 7 g yr− 1 hen− 1, respectively) and N 2 O (2. 60 and 2. 48 g yr− 1 hen− 1, respectively) emissions by about 21, 16 and 9 % in comparison with the deep-pit technique (36. 0 kg CO 2 yr− 1 hen− 1, 31. 6 g CH 4 yr− 1 hen− 1 and 2. 78 g N 2 O yr− 1 hen− 1). The shift to manure belt systems needs to be encouraged since this housing system significantly decreases the production of GHG...|$|R

40|$|Previously, {{only one}} {{ribosome}} protection {{type of a}} tetracycline resistance gene, tetQ, had been identified in Bacteroides spp. During an investigation of anaerobic bacteria present in swine feces and <b>manure</b> storage <b>pits,</b> a tetracycline-resistant Bacteroides strain was isolated. Subsequent analysis showed that this new Bacteroides strain, Bacteroides sp. strain 139, did not contain tetQ but contained a previously unidentified tetracycline resistance gene. Sequence analysis showed that the tetracycline resistance gene from Bacteroides sp. strain 139 encoded a protein (designated Tet 36) that defines {{a new class of}} ribosome protection types of tetracycline resistance. Tet 36 has 60 % amino acid identity over 640 aa to TetQ and between 31 and 49 % amino acid identity to the nine other ribosome protection types of tetracycline resistance genes. The tet(36) region was not observed to transfer from Bacteroides sp. strain 139 to another Bacteroides sp. under laboratory conditions. Yet tet(36) was found in other genera of bacteria isolated from the same swine <b>manure</b> <b>pits</b> and from swine feces. Phylogenetic analysis of the tet(36) -containing isolates indicated that tet(36) was present not only in the Cytophaga-Flavobacter-Bacteroides group to which Bacteroides sp. strain 139 belongs but also in gram-positive genera and gram-negative proteobacteria, indicating that horizontal transfer of tet(36) is occurring between these divergent phylogenetic groups in the farm environment...|$|R
30|$|In {{industrial}} countries with large historic use of PCBs in open applications, the largest releases of PCBs stem from this source. The need {{for developing a}} regulatory framework for the inventory of PCBs in buildings and structures has been recognized [280, 289]. Inventory and control of remaining PCBs in open applications have {{a high priority for}} {{industrial countries}}, to lower and control current PCB impacts on the atmosphere and grassland, and the resulting burden on farm animals. If and where an inventory of specific open applications is important and useful needs to be determined. For example, it is estimated that PCB paints were used in 20 % of outdoor swimming pools in Switzerland [74]. Other applications with potential relevance are for instance paints/coating used for road markings, electricity pylons, silos, stables, and liquid <b>manure</b> <b>pits</b> [17, 73].|$|R
