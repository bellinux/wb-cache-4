40|$|This dataset {{contains}} the Arab-West Report special reports that {{were published in}} 2008. This dataset mainly {{contains the}} writings of Cornelis Hulsman, Drs., among other authors on topics related to Muslim- Christian relations, sectarian tensions, and incidents. Over {{the course of the}} year 2008, Egypt witnessed notable sectarian tensions. Several reports in this dataset concern the Abu Fana tensions, incidents which took place in the Upper Egyptian Minya governorate surrounding a dispute over the growth of Abu Fana Monastery. Arab West Report devoted a large portion of articles and reports covering the story and analysing its developments. Other reports contain published commentary from scholars and critiques of Egyptian and Western media coverage of the <b>sectarian</b> <b>incident.</b> Another major controversial issue addressed in this dataset is the notorious film Fitna which caused an uproar in the Islamic World. Other reports highlight the launching of ENAWU, the Electronic Network for Arab West Understanding. Papers submitted by the staff and interns of CAWU detail the Arab media coverage of the war on Iraq, and facts about the church building regulations and incidents in Egypt, in addition to interviews conducted by AWR and book reviews. Furthermore other reports narrated the experiences of interns when they visited monasteries and witnessed the monastic life. In addition to that some reports shed light on the field visits done by Arab West Report to Minya governorate to collect information and testimonies from residents and monks in relation to the Abu Fana Monastery dispute. Additionally, reports spanning that year on this dataset pointed out to the workshops and conferences that revolved around conflict resolution and dialogue. Furthermore, it contained commentary on published material from other sources (reviews/critique of articles) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} studies {{young people in}} the Northern Ireland conflict. I examine their ways of seeing sectarianism, the conflict and its history, what kinds of experiences they have had from the conflict and what they see as possible solutions to it. This study can be situated in the field of youth studies. Young people’s agency is in the focus. I examine the attitudes of the research participants as agents in the late modern era towards politics and participation in society. My main interest lies in the ways they see the role of {{young people in the}} conflict and how they perceive their own agency in it. I have also tried to find out how young people feel about political participation in general and as a means of finding a solution to the conflict. I have compared the answers of my interviewees regarding participation to results from Finnish youth studies to see, whether living {{in the midst of a}} conflict-affected society politicises young people in a different way than living in a peaceful society. The study is based on 15 interviews of young Protestants and Catholics. The interviews were conducted in Belfast in the spring 2006. The results of this study show that despite the peace process, the conflict still has many impacts on young people. The majority of the interview participants had been involved in some kind of <b>sectarian</b> <b>incident.</b> Segregation in education and housing affects their daily lives. I found that social class and the area of residence seem to have a big impact on the lives of these young people in terms of the conflict. The young people perceived the conflict mostly as a negative thing and they wished that the cycle of violence could be ended. Their attitudes were not sectarian for the most part, but many interview participants thought that segregation should be maintained in Northern Ireland for security reasons. Similarly to results attained among Finnish young people, the interview participants were not very much interested in parliamentary politics. They felt frustrated and angry with politicians. There was, however, concern for common issues, and young people’s participation in society was seen as a positive thing. Nevertheless, they did not know how young people could participate. In addition to the lack of means of participation, there was a lack of viable freetime options. There was a need especially for such alternatives where young people from both communities could interact safely with each other in a neutral space.

40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the representation}} of Muslim–Coptic relations in the Al-Ahrām newspaper between 2005 and 2010. The primary goal is to assess the strategies and discourses used by this newspaper to represent sectarianism. As scholars note, negative representations of the ‘other’ in the media can contribute to shaping and prolonging conflict. Therefore, Al-Ahrām's representation of <b>sectarian</b> <b>incidents</b> is significant for the analysis both {{of the dynamics of}} Muslim–Christian relations in Egypt, and of state and church policies towards communal violence. Three are three central discourses. (1) The use of selective narratives of history to construct a collective understanding of national unity as a natural state of relations between Muslims and Christians in Egypt. (2) Displacement of blame, which means constructing inter-religious conflict as alien and external through the use of an ‘us versus them’ paradigm in order to shift responsibility for Egypt's <b>sectarian</b> <b>incidents</b> to ‘outsiders’. (3) The control of extreme religious views through a discourse of ‘extremists versus moderates’...|$|R

40|$|This report {{provides}} an overview of the scale and nature of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland. Our definition of sectarian violence includes acts of violence, harassment and intimidation perpetrated by members of the Protestant/Unionist/ Loyalist communities on members of the Catholic/Nationalist/Republican communities and vice versa. The primary interest is in acts of non-militarised violence, including attacks on both persons and property, rather than on acts committed by members of paramilitary organisations. However, sectarian violence does include acts of extreme violence and may involve paramilitary activity. This is the third report in a series commissioned by OFMDFM on hate crime in Northern Ireland. The two previous reports were based on an analysis of police data. This has not been possible for this report, as the police only began to gather data on <b>sectarian</b> <b>incidents</b> in a systematic and centralised manner in September 2004. Instead we have made use of a variety of sources of data to construct fragments of a larger picture. This has involved use of a limited amount of police data: for some categories of violence and in some police command units. It also draws upon dat...|$|R
50|$|Following the {{adoption}} of the Sheffield rules and formation of The Football Association in England, a number of football clubs were founded by churches. Everton Football Club were founded in 1879 at St. Domingo's Methodist Church. The Reverend Ben Chambers was an advocate of Muscular Christianity, encouraging healthy minds and healthy bodies. Their Goodison Park ground has a church partially within the perimeter and as such do not play early matches on Sunday to avoid clashing with the services of the church. In the same year, Fulham St Andrew's Church Sunday School F.C., to later become Fulham F.C., was founded by members of the nearby Church of England church for members of the Sunday school with the same focus as Everton of advocating Muscular Christianity. In November 1880, St. Mark's Anglican Church in West Gorton, inspired by the same ideology and to win young men back to the church, set up a football team which later became Manchester City F.C.. St. Mary's Church, Southampton set up a team in 1885, which later became Southampton Football Club. On 6 November 1887, the Celtic Football Club was founded at the Catholic St. Mary's Church Hall in Calton as a way to fight poverty in East Glasgow. Their Glasgow neighbours Rangers F.C. later became associated with the Protestant section of Glasgow which led to the Old Firm rivalry, which has been the centre of several <b>sectarian</b> <b>incidents</b> between Scotland's Protestants and Catholics.|$|R
40|$|The dataset {{contains}} papers written between 2007 and 2016 {{by researchers}} and interns at the Center for Arab-West Understanding (CAWU) in Cairo or by researchers and academics connected to CAWU. The papers aim at obtaining {{a better understanding}} of the role of religion in society, including: -	Relations between Muslims and Christians in Egypt; -	Problems around church building, the highly controversial topic of (alleged) kidnappings of Christian youth, claims of forced conversions, reports on <b>sectarian</b> <b>incidents</b> in Egypt and media critique to uncover biased reporting within Egypt as well as the stereotypical tone in Western media; -	The role of Christian and Muslim institutions in society and the political sphere; -	Activities of human rights organizations; -	Islam and politics. All papers are: -	Descriptive and take different points of views serious as part of the description of events unfolding in society; -	Contributing to {{a better understanding of}} people between different cultures and beliefs. Methodology: Papers always include Egyptian source material. Authors were recommended to make use of the AWR database, conduct interviews in Egypt and where encouraged to contrast results with western news coverage. Papers discuss one subject at length and were reviewed by Egyptian and/or Western academics, within the bounds of organizational possibility and edited by Cornelis Hulsman or others to guarantee academic standards. This has resulted in a number of unique studies about subjects that are rarely covered in depth elsewhere. These papers are completed texts but besides, additional texts from reviewers often include interesting suggestions for further research...|$|R
