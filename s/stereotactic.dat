5|$|Recent {{improvements}} in targeting and imaging {{have led to}} the development of <b>stereotactic</b> radiation in the treatment of early-stage lung cancer. In this form of radiotherapy, high doses are delivered over a number of sessions using <b>stereotactic</b> targeting techniques. Its use is primarily in patients who are not surgical candidates due to medical comorbidities.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{therapy is}} being studied in {{some types of}} epilepsy. Medications that alter immune function, such as {{intravenous}} immunoglobulins, are poorly supported by evidence. Noninvasive <b>stereotactic</b> radiosurgery is, as of 2012, being compared to standard surgery for certain types of epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|Sadasivan joined Tan Tock Seng Hospital as a {{consultant}} neurosurgeon in 1991, where he reorganised the way stroke patients were treated, arranged for the neurosurgical intensive care unit to be computerised, introduced <b>stereotactic</b> brachytherapy for dealing with brain tumours, and chaired the National Neuroscience Institute's planning committee. In 1994, he moved into private practice at Gleneagles Hospital, establishing the first <b>stereotactic</b> radiosurgical treatment system driven by a linear particle accelerator in Singapore. He also worked with medical device manufacturer Siemens to develop image-guided surgical systems. He published more than 50 scientific papers and chapters in neurology books.|$|E
5|$|Shunt surgery, usually {{performed}} by neurosurgeons, involves {{the creation of}} a conduit by which CSF can be drained into another body cavity. The initial procedure is usually a lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt, which connects the subarachnoid space in the lumbar spine with the peritoneal cavity. Generally, a pressure valve is included in the circuit to avoid excessive drainage when the patient is erect. LP shunting provides long-term relief in about half the cases; others require revision of the shunt, often on more than one occasion—usually due to shunt obstruction. If the lumboperitoneal shunt needs repeated revisions, a ventriculoatrial or ventriculoperitoneal shunt may be considered. These shunts are inserted in one of the lateral ventricles of the brain, usually by <b>stereotactic</b> surgery, and then connected either to the right atrium of the heart or the peritoneal cavity, respectively. Given the reduced need for revisions in ventricular shunts, it is possible that this procedure will become the first-line type of shunt treatment.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>stereotactic</b> radiation. <b>Stereotactic</b> {{radiosurgery}} (SRS) is when doctors use a single or several <b>stereotactic</b> radiation treatments of the brain or spine. <b>Stereotactic</b> body radiation therapy (SBRT) refers to one or several <b>stereotactic</b> radiation treatments with the body, such as the lungs.|$|E
25|$|When used {{outside the}} CNS {{it may be}} called <b>stereotactic</b> body {{radiation}} therapy (SBRT) or <b>stereotactic</b> ablative radiotherapy (SABR).|$|E
25|$|<b>Stereotactic</b> {{radiation}} is a specialized type of external beam radiation therapy. It uses focused radiation beams targeting a well-defined tumor using extremely detailed imaging scans. Radiation oncologists perform <b>stereotactic</b> treatments, {{often with the}} help of a neurosurgeon for tumors in the brain or spine.|$|E
25|$|Some {{doctors say}} an {{advantage}} to <b>stereotactic</b> treatments is that they deliver {{the right amount of}} radiation to the cancer in a shorter amount of time than traditional treatments, which can often take 6 to 11 weeks. Plus treatments are given with extreme accuracy, which should limit the effect of the radiation on healthy tissues. One problem with <b>stereotactic</b> treatments is that they are only suitable for certain small tumors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Stereotactic</b> {{surgery and}} radiosurgery: PET-image guided surgery {{facilitates}} treatment of intracranial tumors, arteriovenous malformations and other surgically treatable conditions.|$|E
25|$|Psychosurgery {{continued}} to decline during the 1960s and 1970s. In 1976 about 120 operations {{were carried out}} in the United Kingdom. There were still a few standard leucotomies, but by the mid-1970s <b>stereotactic</b> subcaudate tractotomy, cingulotomy and <b>stereotactic</b> limbic leucotomy accounted for more than 50 per cent of operations. Depression was the most common diagnosis; people were also operated on for anxiety, violence, obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, anorexia and other diagnoses.|$|E
25|$|Another {{indication}} for neuroimaging is CT-, MRI- and PET-guided <b>stereotactic</b> {{surgery or}} radiosurgery {{for treatment of}} intracranial tumors, arteriovenous malformations and other surgically treatable conditions.|$|E
25|$|For {{comparisons}} {{across different}} scans (within or across subjects), differences in brain {{size and shape}} are eliminated by spatially normalizing (i.e. registering) the individual images to the <b>stereotactic</b> space of a template brain.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the Mental Health Act 1983 no more than 28 psychosurgical operations have been carried out in the United Kingdom in any year. No operations were performed in England between 1999 and 2009; Frenchay Hospital, Bristol, performed one anterior cingulotomy in 2010. A few <b>stereotactic</b> anterior capsulotomies are performed every year at the University of Wales Hospital, Cardiff. <b>Stereotactic</b> anterior cingulotomies are performed at the Dundee Royal Infirmary in collaboration with the psychiatric unit at Ninewells Hospital. The Cardiff and Dundee units introduced psychosurgery programmes in the early 1990s and have used psychosurgery in the treatment of depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and anxiety.|$|E
25|$|Ommaya {{worked with}} Sir Godfrey Hounsfield to {{determine}} the spatial resolution of the CT scanner which {{opened the door for}} its use in <b>stereotactic</b> surgery. Ommaya also invented the first spinal fluid driven artificial organ.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1980s {{the number of}} psychosurgical {{operations}} carried out annually in the United Kingdom had fallen to fewer than 70. Most of them were <b>stereotactic</b> subcaudate tractotomies performed at the Geoffrey Knight psychosurgical unit at the Brook Hospital, London.|$|E
25|$|Overlook {{is one of}} five New Jersey {{hospitals}} {{approved to}} provide emergency angioplasty in a community hospital setting. The hospital has the state's first combined PET/CT scanner and <b>stereotactic</b> radiosurgery cancer treatment program. Overlook won the Silver Governor's Award for Performance Excellence on two occasions.|$|E
25|$|Limbic leucotomy was {{developed}} in the early 1970s by surgeon Alan Richardson at Atkinson Morley’s Hospital. The operation combines <b>stereotactic</b> subcaudate tractotomy and cingulotomy, with up to 14 cryogenic lesions made in the brain. Limbic leucotomies continued to be performed at Atkinson Morley’s Hospital until 1999.|$|E
25|$|<b>Stereotactic</b> {{treatments}} can {{be confusing}} because many hospitals call the treatments {{by the name}} of the manufacturer rather than calling it SRS or SBRT. Brand names for these treatments include Axesse, Cyberknife, Gamma Knife, Novalis, Primatom, Synergy, X-Knife, TomoTherapy, Trilogy and Truebeam. This list changes as equipment manufacturers continue to develop new, specialized technologies to treat cancers.|$|E
25|$|The New York Times {{reported}} in December 2010 that radiation overdoses had occurred with the linear accelerator method of radiosurgery, {{due in large}} part to inadequate safeguards in equipment retrofitted for <b>stereotactic</b> radiosurgery. In the U.S. the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates these devices, whereas the Gamma Knife is regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The NYT article focused on Varian equipment and associated software, but the problem is likely not to be limited to that manufacturer.|$|E
25|$|If lesions are present, {{they are}} watched closely {{for changes in}} size. Prognosis is best when lesions are less than 3cm in length. Most {{complications}} occur when the lesions are greater than 6cm in size. Surgical intervention for intracranial lesions has been done successfully. Nonsurgical treatments include embolization, radiation therapy, and continued observation. Arterial vascular malformations may be treated with the cyberknife treatment. Possible treatment for cerebral arterial vascular malformations include <b>stereotactic</b> radiosurgery, endovascular embolization, and microsurgical resection.|$|E
25|$|The {{preoperative}} {{targeting of}} proper implantation sites {{can be accomplished}} by the indirect and direct methods. The indirect method uses computer tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or ventriculography to locate the anterior and posterior commissures and then employs predetermined coordinates and distances from the intercommissural line to define the target area. Subsequent histologically defined atlas maps {{can also be used to}} verify the target area. The direct method provides visualization and targeting of deep nuclei by applying <b>stereotactic</b> preoperative MRI, which unlike the indirect method, takes into account the anatomic variation of the nuclei’s size, position, and functional segregation amongst individuals.|$|E
25|$|Ommaya {{also did}} early {{work with the}} {{computed}} tomography (CT) scanner. His work with Sir Godfrey Hounsfield to determine the spatial resolution of the CT scanner {{opened the door for}} its use in <b>stereotactic</b> surgery. Spinal angiography was also pioneered by Ommaya, Di Chiro, and Doppman. This work allowed for the visualization of arteries and veins and allowed for understanding of spinal cord arteriography. The same team reported the treatment of spinal cord AVMs by percutaneous embolization of an intercostal artery using stainless steel pellets. This {{was one of the first}} reports of interventional neuroradiology. Ommaya made several significant contributions to many areas that concern neurological surgeons, treatment of cancer, hydrocephalus, traumatic brain injury, and arterio-venous malformations.|$|E
25|$|MRI is {{the investigative}} tool {{of choice for}} {{neurological}} cancers, as it has better resolution than CT and offers better visualization of the posterior fossa. The contrast provided between grey and white matter makes MRI {{the best choice for}} many conditions of the central nervous system, including demyelinating diseases, dementia, cerebrovascular disease, infectious diseases, and epilepsy. Since many images are taken milliseconds apart, it shows how the brain responds to different stimuli, enabling researchers to study both the functional and structural brain abnormalities in psychological disorders. MRI also is used in mri-guided <b>stereotactic</b> surgery and radiosurgery for treatment of intracranial tumors, arteriovenous malformations, and other surgically treatable conditions using a device known as the N-localizer.|$|E
25|$|External beam {{radiation}} therapy uses a linear accelerator to produce high-energy x-rays that are directed in a beam towards the prostate. A technique called Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) {{may be used}} to adjust the radiation beam to conform with the shape of the tumor, allowing higher doses to be given to the prostate and seminal vesicles with less damage to the bladder and rectum. External {{beam radiation}} therapy is generally given over several weeks, with daily visits to a radiation therapy center. New types of radiation therapy such as IMRT have fewer side effects than traditional treatment. Eleven centers in the United States are now using proton therapy for prostate cancer, which uses protons rather than X-rays to kill the cancer cells. Researchers are also studying types of <b>stereotactic</b> body radiotherapy (SBRT) to treat prostate cancer.|$|E
25|$|When the Board of Control {{published}} {{their second}} survey in 1961 {{the use of}} psychosurgery had declined by more than half; the decline being attributed to {{an awareness of the}} risks of irreversible effects and the introduction in 1955 of neuroleptic drugs. By 1961 nearly half of mental hospitals in the United Kingdom were no longer carrying out leucotomies. Approximately 500 operations were performed a year, and were unevenly distributed over the country. Someone hospitalised in the North East Metropolitan region was more than 15 times more likely to undergo psychosurgery than someone hospitalised in the neighbouring East Anglian region. There were also random differences in the type of operation used and the type of illness treated. Twenty per cent of operations were still standard pre-frontal leucotomies; the rest were new operations, and a few centres used <b>stereotactic</b> techniques. Some hospitals still used psychosurgery to treat chronic schizophrenia, in others the only indications were depression or obsessive illness.|$|E
25|$|In {{parallel}} to these developments, {{a similar approach}} was designed for a linear particle accelerator or Linac. Installation of the first 4MeV clinical linear accelerator began in June 1952 in the Medical Research Council (MRC) Radiotherapeutic Research Unit at the Hammersmith Hospital, London. The system was handed over for physics and other testing in February 1953 and began to treat patients on 7 September that year. Meanwhile, work by at the Stanford Microwave Laboratory {{led to the development}} of a 6-MV accelerator, which was installed at Stanford University Hospital, California, in 1956. Linac units quickly became favored devices for conventional fractionated radiotherapy but it lasted until the 1980s before dedicated Linac radiosurgery became a reality. In 1982, the Spanish neurosurgeon J. Barcia-Salorio began to evaluate the role of cobalt-generated and then Linac-based photon radiosurgery for the treatment of AVMs and epilepsy. In 1984, Betti and Derechinsky described a Linac-based radiosurgical system. Winston and Lutz further advanced Linac-based radiosurgical prototype technologies by incorporating an improved <b>stereotactic</b> positioning device and a method to measure the accuracy of various components. Using a modified Linac, the first patient in the United States was treated in Boston Brigham and Women's Hospital in February 1986.|$|E
2500|$|Technological {{improvements}} in medical imaging and computing {{have led to}} increased clinical adoption of <b>stereotactic</b> radiosurgery and have broadened its scope in the 21st century. The localization accuracy and precision that are implicit in the word [...] "stereotactic" [...] remain of utmost importance for radiosurgical interventions. [...] <b>Stereotactic</b> accuracy and precision are significantly increased by using a device known as the N-localizer. It was invented by American physician and computer scientist Russell Brown, and has become widely used in several <b>stereotactic</b> surgical and radiosurgical systems.|$|E
2500|$|In the 21st {{century the}} {{original}} concept of radiosurgery [...] {{expanded to include}} treatments comprising up to five fractions, and <b>stereotactic</b> radiosurgery has been redefined as a distinct neurosurgical discipline that utilizes externally generated ionizing radiation to inactivate or eradicate defined targets, typically in the head or spine, {{without the need for}} a surgical incision. [...] Irrespective of the similarities between the concepts of <b>stereotactic</b> radiosurgery and fractionated radiotherapy the intent of both approaches is fundamentally different, although both treatment modalities are reported to have identical outcomes for certain indications. The aim of <b>stereotactic</b> radiosurgery is to destroy target tissue while preserving adjacent normal tissue, where fractionated radiotherapy relies on a different sensitivity of the target and the surrounding normal tissue to the total accumulated radiation dose. Historically, the field of fractionated radiotherapy evolved from the original concept of <b>stereotactic</b> radiosurgery following discovery of the principles of radiobiology: repair, reassortment, repopulation, and reoxygenation. Today, both treatment techniques are complementary, as tumors that may be resistant to fractionated radiotherapy may respond well to radiosurgery, and tumors that are too large or too close to critical organs for safe radiosurgery may be suitable candidates for fractionated radiotherapy.|$|E
2500|$|In <b>stereotactic</b> {{radiosurgery}} (SRS), {{the word}} [...] "stereotactic" [...] {{refers to a}} three-dimensional coordinate system that enables accurate correlation of a virtual target seen in the patient's diagnostic images with the actual target position in the patient.|$|E
2500|$|Lena Zavaroni (1963–1999), Scottish child {{star and}} singer who had {{suffered}} from anorexia and depression for many years, underwent a <b>stereotactic</b> anterior capsulotomy [...] at the University of Wales Hospital in Cardiff in 1999. She died three weeks later from pneumonia (which her doctors considered {{was not related to}} the surgery).|$|E
2500|$|Capsulotomy, or {{anterior}} capsulotomy, {{in which}} part of the internal capsule in the frontal lobe is destroyed, was first used in France in the late 1940s and used extensively in Sweden. [...] Since the early 1990s <b>stereotactic</b> anterior capsulotomies been performed at Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, Scotland, and at the University of Wales Hospital, Cardiff, Wales.|$|E
2500|$|Cingulotomy, [...] where {{part of the}} {{anterior}} cingulate gyrus is destroyed, was pioneered in Great Britain in 1948 by Hugh Cairns, first Nuffield Professor of Surgery at the University of Oxford. Similar operations accounted for 10 per cent of psychosurgical operations in the United Kingdom in the mid-1970s. In recent years <b>stereotactic</b> anterior cingulotomies have been performed by the psychosurgical unit at Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, Scotland.|$|E
2500|$|In 1949 Knight at Runwell Hospital started {{performing}} {{the operation of}} orbital undercutting (called orbital leucotomy in Britain) devised by American surgeon William Beecher Scoville, in which the lower quadrants of the frontal lobes were cut via holes in the forehead. Knight later modified Scoville’s operation to restrict the cut to the lower medial quadrants. Further modifications dating from 1961 included {{the use of a}} <b>stereotactic</b> frame and brain images {{to make it easier to}} navigate in the frontal lobes, and the use of radioactive seeds (up to 20) to destroy tissue in the subcaudate region. The operation was then called <b>stereotactic</b> subcaudate tractotomy and by the mid-1970s, although only used at two neurosurgical units (which by that time had replaced mental hospitals as the sites for psychosurgical operations), it accounted for 30 per cent of operations in the United Kingdom. Knight operated at the Brook Hospital in South London in collaboration with retired psychiatrist Strom-Olsen and then with psychiatrist Paul Bridges. Knight retired in the early 1970s (the unit was named the Geoffrey Knight psychosurgical unit in his honour) and was replaced by John Bartlett. In all, nearly 1300 subcaudate tractotomies were carried out at the Brook Hospital, with one death attributed wholly to the operation. During the 1980s the unit accounted for over 75 per cent of the psychosurgical operations carried out in Britain. The unit ceased operating in 1994. [...] A team at Kings College Hospital under psychiatrist Stuart Checkley took over the work of the unit and performed 23 <b>stereotactic</b> subcaudate tractotomies over the next five years, using radiofrequency to destroy brain tissue.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Stereotactic</b> {{radiosurgery}} {{was first}} developed in 1949 by the Swedish neurosurgeon Lars Leksell to treat small {{targets in the}} brain that were not amenable to conventional surgery. The initial <b>stereotactic</b> instrument he conceived used probes and electrodes. The first attempt to supplant the electrodes with radiation {{was made in the}} early fifties, with x-rays. The principle of this instrument was to hit the intra-cranial target with narrow beams of radiation from multiple directions. The beam paths converge in the target volume, delivering a lethal cumulative dose of radiation there, while limiting the dose to the adjacent healthy tissue. Ten years later significant progress had been made, due in considerable measure to the contribution of the physicists Kurt Liden and Börje Larsson. [...] At this time, <b>stereotactic</b> proton beams had replaced the x-rays. The heavy particle beam presented as an excellent replacement for the surgical knife, but the synchrocyclotron was too clumsy. Leksell proceeded to develop a practical, compact, precise and simple tool which could be handled by the surgeon himself. In 1968 this resulted in the Gamma Knife, which was installed at the Karolinska Institute and consisted of several cobalt-60 radioactive sources placed in a kind of helmet with central channels for irradiation with gamma rays. This prototype was designed to produce slit-like radiation lesions for functional neurosurgical procedures to treat pain, movement disorders, or behavioral disorders that did not respond to conventional treatment. The success of this first unit led to the construction of a second device, containing 179 cobalt-60 sources. This second Gamma Knife unit was designed to produce spherical lesions to treat brain tumors and intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). In the 1980s the third and fourth units (with 201 cobalt-60 sources) were installed in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Sheffield, England. The fifth Gamma Knife was installed at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Pittsburgh in 1987.|$|E
2500|$|A {{new method}} to reduce rectal {{radiation}} injury in prostate cancer patients {{involves the use}} of an absorbable spacer placed between the prostate and rectum. [...] Such spacers are commercially available in some regions, and are undergoing clinical trials in others. [...] By temporarily altering [...] the anatomy these products have the potential to allow for improved cancer targeting while minimizing risk to neighboring healthy tissues. [...] Prostate Rectum Spacers should be compatible with all prostate cancer radiotherapy treatments including 3D conformal, IMRT and <b>stereotactic</b> radiation and brachytherapy.|$|E
2500|$|When {{viewed with}} MRI, glioblastomas often appear as ring-enhancing lesions. [...] The {{appearance}} is not specific, however, as other lesions such as abscess, metastasis, tumefactive multiple sclerosis, and other entities {{may have a}} similar appearance. Definitive diagnosis of a suspected GBM on CT or MRI requires a <b>stereotactic</b> biopsy or a craniotomy with tumor resection and pathologic confirmation. [...] Because the tumor grade {{is based upon the}} most malignant portion of the tumor, biopsy or subtotal tumor resection can result in undergrading of the lesion. Imaging of tumor blood flow using perfusion MRI and measuring tumor metabolite concentration with MR spectroscopy may add value to standard MRI in select cases by showing increased relative cerebral blood volume and increased choline peak respectively, but pathology remains the gold standard for diagnosis and molecular characterization.|$|E
