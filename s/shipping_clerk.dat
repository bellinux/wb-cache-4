5|$|Stanley Frederick Gibbs, GC (2 January 1909 – 3 March 1991) was an Australian <b>shipping</b> <b>clerk</b> and an {{exchange}} {{recipient of the}} George Cross, the highest civil decoration for heroism in the United Kingdom and formerly in the Commonwealth. On 3 January 1927, {{the day after his}} eighteenth birthday, Gibbs went to the rescue of 15-year-old Mervyn Allum during a shark attack at Port Hacking, New South Wales. He managed to fend off the shark by striking at it with his legs and fists and, with the assistance of a friend, pulled Allum clear of the water. Although Alllum died from his injuries, Gibbs was publicly praised by the coroner and local community leaders for his actions, and was subsequently awarded the Albert Medal.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} he reached his teens, Gygax had a {{voracious}} appetite for pulp fiction authors such as Robert Howard, Jack Vance, Fritz Leiber, H. P. Lovecraft, and Edgar Burroughs. Gygax was a mediocre student, and in 1956, a few months after his father died, he {{dropped out of high school}} in his junior year. He briefly joined the Marines, but after being diagnosed with walking pneumonia, he was given a medical discharge and moved back home with his mother. From there, he commuted to a job as <b>shipping</b> <b>clerk</b> with Kemper Insurance Co. in Chicago. Shortly after his return, a friend introduced him to Avalon Hill's new wargame Gettysburg, and Gygax was soon obsessed with the game, often playing marathon sessions once a week or more. It was also from Avalon Hill that he ordered the first blank hexagon mapping sheets that were available, which he then employed to design his own games.|$|E
5|$|Born in Hunters Hill, Sydney, {{and educated}} locally, Gibbs was {{employed}} by the Australian Gas Light Company (AGL) as a <b>shipping</b> <b>clerk</b> for forty-five years. During the Second World War, he enlisted as a private in the Second Australian Imperial Force in February 1942 and served with the 35th Battalion on home defence and patrolling duties in Sydney and Western Australia for two years. The battalion was deployed to New Guinea in January 1944 for service in the Huon Peninsula campaign, but Gibbs' overseas experience was short lived. He broke his leg {{on the day of}} arrival, and spent an extended period in hospitals in New Guinea and Australia. Discharged in December 1944, he returned to his work with AGL. In 1971, the British Government announced that the Albert Medal would be discontinued and living recipients would henceforth be regarded as holders of the George Cross. The change came into effect from 21 October, and living recipients were accordingly invited to exchange their medals; Gibbs took up the offer and formally became a recipient of the George Cross. Aged 82, Gibbs died in Bondi, New South Wales, in 1991.|$|E
60|$|The {{first that}} fell was Mr. Lewis, the <b>ship's</b> <b>clerk.</b> He was leaning, with folded arms, over a bale of blankets, engaged in bargaining, when he {{received}} a deadly stab in the back, and fell down the companion-way.|$|R
5000|$|With limited {{commercial}} success, Motown {{assigned the}} Spinners as road managers, chaperones, and chauffeurs for other groups, {{and even as}} <b>shipping</b> <b>clerks.</b> G. C. Cameron replaced Edgar [...] "Chico" [...] Edwards in 1967, and in 1969, the group switched to the Motown-owned V.I.P. imprint.|$|R
50|$|The exact {{death toll}} from the Phoenix is not known. The owners of the ship claimed that no more than 190 died, but the <b>ship's</b> <b>clerk</b> {{estimated}} {{that the number of}} lives lost was at least 250. 43 people were saved; 40 in the lifeboats and three rescued by the Delaware.|$|R

25|$|Inspired by {{works such}} as Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness (1902), {{originally}} published as a three-part series in Blackwood’s Magazine (1899) and based on Conrad's experience as a steamer captain on the Congo 12 years earlier, international criticism of Leopold’s rule increased and mobilized. Reports of outrageous exploitation and widespread human rights abuses led the British Crown to appoint their consul Roger Casement to investigate conditions there. His extensive travels and interviews in the region resulted in the Casement Report, which detailed the extensive abuses under Leopold's regime. A widespread war of words ensued. In Britain, former <b>shipping</b> <b>clerk</b> E. D. Morel with Casement's support founded the Congo Reform Association, the first mass human rights movement. Supporters included American writer Mark Twain, whose stinging political satire entitled King Leopold's Soliloquy portrays the king arguing that bringing Christianity to the country outweighs a little starvation, and uses many of Leopold's own words against him.|$|E
50|$|Port Orchard, part of Washington state's Puget Sound, is {{the strait}} that {{separates}} Bainbridge Island {{on the east}} from the Kitsap Peninsula on the west. It extends from Liberty Bay and Agate Pass in the north to Sinclair Inlet and Rich Passage in the south. It was named in May 1792 by George Vancouver after Harry Masterman Orchard, <b>ship's</b> <b>clerk</b> of Vancouver's <b>ship</b> Discovery.|$|R
50|$|The mutineers ordered Bligh, two midshipmen, the {{surgeons}} mate (Ledward), and the <b>ships</b> <b>clerk</b> into the <b>ships</b> boat. Several more men voluntarily joined Bligh rather than remain aboard. Bligh {{and his men}} sailed the open boat 30 nmi km to Tofua in search of supplies, but were forced to flee after attacks by hostile natives resulted {{in the death of}} one of the men.|$|R
50|$|In 1795, Bowditch went to sea on {{the first}} of four voyages as a <b>ship's</b> <b>clerk</b> and captain's writer. His fifth voyage was as master and part owner of a ship. Following this voyage, he {{returned}} to Salem in 1803 to resume his mathematical studies and enter the insurance business. One of his family homes in Salem, the Nathaniel Bowditch House, still exists and has recently been restored. This house has been designated a National Historic Landmark.|$|R
500|$|Stanley Frederick Gibbs {{was born}} in the Sydney suburb of Hunters Hill, New South Wales, on 2 January 1909. Known as [...] "Stan", he was the first of four {{children}} to Lindsay Thomas Gibbs and Edith Trevillion, who wed the year of his birth. He was followed by sister Ellen in 1910, Phyllis in 1912, and brother Lindsay in 1917. The specifics of Gibbs' education are unclear, but he left high school before achieving an Intermediate Certificate and at first worked as a shop assistant in a men's store. Gibbs later gained a position with the Australian Gas Light Company (AGL) as a <b>shipping</b> <b>clerk,</b> and by 1927 was living in the Inner West suburb of Marrickville.|$|E
500|$|The {{young couple}} moved to Chicago where Gygax {{continued}} as a <b>shipping</b> <b>clerk</b> at Kemper Insurance, and also found Mary Jo a job there too. (The company laid her off {{when she became}} pregnant with their first child.) [...] At Mary Jo's insistence, he also attended night classes in junior college to earn his high school diploma, {{and this time he}} excelled at his studies and made the college's Dean's List. He also took anthropology classes at the University of Chicago. Gygax also volunteered as a Republican precinct captain during the 1960 presidential election, and observed many infractions by his Democratic counterpart. When he threatened to report these, he was offered a full scholarship to the University of Chicago if he kept silent. Although Gygax ultimately did not report the infractions, since he felt nothing would be done, he also did not accept the scholarship.|$|E
500|$|Saunders was {{discharged}} from the Army on 5October 1945, {{following the end of}} the Second World War. Returning to Australia, he volunteered for service in Japan with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force, but the government would not accept Aborigines for the operation. Saunders spoke publicly against this policy, calling it [...] "narrow-minded and ignorant"; the wartime restriction on non-European enlistments in the armed forces was not lifted until 1949. Saunders moved to Melbourne with his family, which by this time consisted of his wife Dorothy, whom he had married in 1944, and their three young children. Dorothy had served in the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force during the war. [...] Saunders recalled that he [...] "had a hard time after the war... and poor old Dotty, she, you know, didn't know what the hell to make of it". Facing discrimination that he had rarely encountered as a soldier, he worked in the ensuing years as a tram conductor, a foundry worker, and a <b>shipping</b> <b>clerk.</b>|$|E
50|$|By {{the time}} the Delaware arrived at around 7 am, the Phoenix had burned to the waterline. The Delaware found only three survivors: the <b>ships</b> <b>clerk</b> and a {{passenger}} clinging to the rudder chains, and an engineer clinging to a door. The boat from the Liberty arrived soon after, followed {{by one of the}} Phoenixs lifeboats. The Delaware retrieved five bodies from the water, then took the hull of the Phoenix and the Libertys lifeboat in tow. The Delaware towed the wreck to Sheboygan, where it was beached by the citys north pier.|$|R

"Anywhere {{else they}} might be leaders, {{but they have no}} social weight in this topsy-turvy land, and though they have been {{employed}} in clerical work for generations they have no practical knowledge of affairs. A <b>ship's</b> <b>clerk</b> is a useful person, but he is scarcely the captain; and an orderly-room writer, however smart he may be, is not the colonel. You see, the writer class in India has never till now aspired to anything like command. It wasn't allowed to.

2500|$|The most {{prominent}} {{of the younger}} generation of writers in Paris was Émile Zola (1840-1902). [...] His first job in Paris was as a <b>shipping</b> <b>clerk</b> for the publisher Hacehtte; later, he served as the director of publicity for the firm. He published his first stories in 1864, his first novel in 1865, and had his first literary success in 1867 with his novel Thérèse Raquin.|$|E

50|$|As a teenager, Mariner was a <b>ship's</b> <b>clerk</b> {{aboard the}} British {{privateer}} Port au Prince. In 1806, {{while it was}} anchored off the Tongan island of Lifuka, in the Ha'apai island group, Port au Prince was seized by a chief named Fīnau Ulukālala. Most of the crew were killed during the capture of the ship, but the chief spared Mariner and a few crewmates. Mariner lived in Tonga for four years. After returning to England, Mariner dictated {{a detailed account of}} his experiences, a description of Tongan society and culture, and a grammar and dictionary of the Tongan language.|$|R
50|$|In 1591, {{at the age}} of twelve, Munk went to Oporto in Portugal {{where he}} worked for the {{shipping}} magnate Duart Duez. The following year he sailed with a Dutch convoy to Bahia in Brazil. Off the Brazilian coast, the convoy was attacked by French pirates. Munk was among the seven survivors. Munk lived in Bahia (today's Salvador) for six years, where he was in the service of Duart Duez' brother, Miguel. In 1599, under dramatic circumstances, Munk returned to Europe and Copenhagen, where the Danish magnate and Lord Chancellor Henrik Ramel hired him as a <b>ship</b> <b>clerk.</b>|$|R

[...] He joined the Citizens Military Force in 1910 and was initially posted to 5th Battalion (Victorian Scottish Regiment). Two years later, by then a sergeant, he transferred to 60th Battalion. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 58th Infantry (Essendon Rifles) in July 1913.|$|E
2500|$|The Caine {{family had}} moved into a larger house in 1873, at 59 South Chester Street, Toxteth, where Caine shared a bedroom with his younger brother John, a <b>shipping</b> <b>clerk.</b> John {{contracted}} tuberculosis which he passed to his brother. By 1875 Caine had permanent lodgings in New Brighton, spending weekends there [...] "for {{the sake of his}} health". Caine became increasingly unwell from the beginning of January 1877. In April the same year John, died from tuberculosis, aged 21. Dangerously ill, Caine was terrified of suffering the same fate. He recovered, but the disease left him with permanent lung damage, and throughout his life he had attacks of bronchitis. In his 1913 novel The Woman Thou Gavest Me, he describes Mary O’Neil dying of tuberculosis.|$|E

5000|$|Ginés de Mafra {{explicitly}} {{states in}} his first hand account that Enrique was taken on the expedition primarily because {{of his ability to}} speak the Malay language: [...] "He Magellan told his men that they were now in the land he had desired, and sent a man named Herédia, who was the <b>ship's</b> <b>clerk,</b> ashore with a Native they had taken, so they said, because he was known to speak Malay, the language spoken in the Malay Archipelago." [...] The island in the Philippines where Enrique spoke and was understood by the natives was Mazaua, which Mafra locates somewhere near Mindanao.|$|R
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the term is unclear. It was first noted by {{lexicographer}} F.C. Bowen in 1929, in his Sea Slang: a dictionary of the old-timers’ expressions and epithets, where he defines wogs as [...] "lower class Babu <b>shipping</b> <b>clerks</b> on the Indian coast." [...] Many dictionaries say [...] "wog" [...] derives from the golliwogg, a blackface minstrel doll character from a children's book, The Adventures of Two Dutch Dolls and a Golliwogg by Florence Kate Upton, published in 1895; or from pollywog, a dialect term for tadpole that is used in maritime circles to indicate someone who has not crossed the equator.|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} the thesis is the {{administration}} and logistics on board Dutch men-of-war during the 17 th and 18 th centuries. The sailor or <b>ship's</b> <b>clerk</b> {{who was in charge}} with this shipboard activities was the so called (scheeps) schrijver. His background, appointment, work, earnings and importance for the Dutch navy are the central topics. This non-commissioned officer occupied an important position both on board and on shore.

60|$|I was {{forthwith}} {{provided with}} an apron, and {{introduced to the}} slim and anaemic but cheerful Johnny Hedges, the <b>shipping</b> <b>clerk,</b> hard {{at work in the}} alley. Secretly I looked down on my fellow-clerks, as one destined for a higher mission, made out of better stuff,--finer stuff. Despite my attempt to hide this sense of superiority they were swift to discover it; and perhaps it is to my credit as well as theirs that they did not resent it. Curiously enough, they seemed to acknowledge it. Before the week was out I had earned the nickname of Beau Brummel.|$|E

One time he was so timid he was plumb scared of the Super, and never got credit for the dandy work he did. Him at the De Luxe! And if he wasn't {{ordering}} a tony feed with all the [...] "fixings" [...] from celery to nuts! And instead of being embarrassed by the waiters, like he used to be at the little dump where we lunched in Old Lang Syne, he was bossing them around like he was a millionaire! ...|$|E

"However, I didn't mean to {{talk about}} the house, but rather about my life when I was a <b>shipping</b> <b>clerk.</b> I had {{ambition}} and thought I had talent; I hated to be left behind by my friends. It cost much planning to share their amusements, join a good yacht club, and race my boat. Sportsmen like you don't know the small tricks and shabbiness we others are forced to use. Well, at length my uncle died and I got control of the falling house, with its load of debt. I'd long been rash, but the rashest thing I did was when I fell in love with Flora. Yet she loved me, and Chisholm, with some reserves, has given his consent. I have got to satisfy him and with this in view, we're bound for the Caribbean on board a thirty-year-old yacht." ...|$|E
