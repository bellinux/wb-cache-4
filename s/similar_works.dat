5|$|The illustration—humorously {{depicting}} New Yorkers' self-image {{of their}} place in the world, or perhaps outsiders' view of New Yorkers' self-image—inspired many <b>similar</b> <b>works,</b> including the poster for the 1984 film Moscow on the Hudson; that movie poster led to a lawsuit, Steinberg v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., 663 F. Supp. 706 (S.D.N.Y. 1987), which held that Columbia Pictures violated the copyright Steinberg held on his work.|$|E
5|$|His Remarks {{upon the}} Life of Jan Zamoyski (Uwagi nad życiem Jana Zamoyskiego, 1787), {{published}} anonymously {{on the eve}} of the Great Sejm, transformed the little-known tutor into one of the chief political thinkers of the late 18th-century Commonwealth. It became a model for other <b>similar</b> <b>works</b> and began a flood of political books and pamphlets unprecedented in the Commonwealth's history. It was reprinted numerous times, including in unauthorized editions.|$|E

5|$|In Eakins' oeuvre, The Swimming Hole was {{immediately}} {{preceded by a}} number of <b>similar</b> <b>works</b> on the Arcadian theme. These correspond to lectures he gave on Ancient Greek sculpture and were inspired by the Pennsylvania Academy's casts of Phidias' Pan-Athenaic procession from the Parthenon marbles. A series of photographs, relief sculptures, and oil sketches culminated in the 1883 Arcadia, a painting that also featured nude figures—posed for by a student, a nephew, and the artist's fiancée—in a pastoral landscape.|$|E
5|$|Roland Büchner's 2000 recording, {{with the}} Regensburger Domspatzen, {{combined}} Bach's German Magnificat with the 1723 Christmas {{version of his}} Latin Magnificat (BWV243a). Gardiner's Bach Cantata Pilgrimage featured BWV10 in a concert recorded in 2000. Ton Koopman's concert at the 2003 Leipzig Bach Festival combined BWV10 with the Christmas versions of Bach's and Kuhnau's Magnificat, thus allowing to compare <b>similar</b> <b>works</b> of two consecutive Thomaskantors. Sigiswald Kuijken recorded BWV10 for his Cantatas for the Complete Liturgical Year series in 2007. The same year, a concert at the Indiana University combined Bach's Meine Seel erhebt den Herren cantata with a 2005 Magnificat by Sven-David Sandström.|$|E
5|$|The Wujing Zongyao {{was one of}} 347 {{military}} treatises {{listed in}} the biographical chapters of the History of Song (1345 AD), one of the Twenty-Four Histories. Of these 347 different military treatises from the Song period, only the Wujing Zongyao, the Huqianjing (Tiger Seal Manual) of Xu Dong in 1004 AD, and fragments of <b>similar</b> <b>works</b> found in the later Yonglo Datian have survived. The original text of the Wujing Zongyao was kept in the Imperial Library, while a number of hand-written copies were distributed elsewhere, including a copy given to Wang Shao by Emperor Shenzong of Song in 1069 AD.|$|E

5|$|William De Morgan {{was unwilling}} to {{compromise}} on quality or embrace the trend towards mass production, and by this time his work was significantly more expensive than <b>similar</b> <b>works</b> by other designers. Consequently, his ceramics business was becoming increasingly unviable financially. In 1906 his first novel, Joseph Vance, was published and became a great success, prompting DeMorgan to close the ceramics business in 1907 to concentrate on writing. Mary Watts attempted to replicate DeMorgan's tile designs at Watts's pottery in Compton {{but was unable to}} do so, and investigated other tile manufacturers.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{the absence}} of starchy {{historical}} content in Robert doubtless {{played a part in}} attracting the bourgeoisie to the opera, until then regarded as primarily an aristocratic entertainment. The success of the opera also justified the government's policy of 'privatization' in selling the management to Véron, and this was a landmark in the dilution of state control and patronage in the fine arts. Although Véron had not commissioned it (having taken control only after the Revolution), Robert was his first new production as manager of the Opéra, and its success underwrote his policy of commissioning <b>similar</b> <b>works.</b> These were to include Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots, Fromental Halévy's La Juive, and Daniel Auber's Gustave III. However, while they used 'the same dazzling theatrical rhetoric' as Robert, they led to 'uniformly horrific dénouements' with 'gripping moral urgency', their more sophisticated plot-lines reflecting the changes in taste of the new opera clientele.

25|$|Later, publicizing Sadoveanu's work to Eastern Bloc {{and world}} audiences became a {{priority}} for the communist regime. Thus, Mitrea Cocor was, together with <b>similar</b> <b>works</b> by Zaharia Stancu and Eusebiu Camilar, among {{the first wave of}} Romanian books to have been translated into Czech and published in Communist Czechoslovakia. Alongside <b>similar</b> <b>works</b> by Petru Dumitriu, Mitrea Cocor was also among the few English-language editions sanctioned by the Romanian regime, being translated and published, with a preface by Jack Lindsay, in 1953. Nine years later, the collected short stories were a tool for cultural exchange between Romania and the United States. Sadoveanu's good standing in the Soviet Union after World War II also {{made him one of the}} few Romanian writers whose works were still being published in the Moldavian SSR (which, as part of Bessarabia, had previously been a region of Greater Romania).|$|E

25|$|Fedorowicz Publishing was {{the first}} North American press to {{translate}} works by the German author Franz Kurowski, providing laudatory and fictionalised wartime chronicles of German units and their highly-decorated personnel. In early 1990s, Fedorowicz released Kurowski's two popular works, Panzer Aces and Infantry Aces, in 1992 and 1994, respectively. The first two books were followed up by Panzer Aces II, Panzer Aces III, Luftwaffe Aces and <b>similar</b> <b>works.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{hand axe}} played helped {{establish}} that early humans {{were capable of}} constructing relatively sophisticated tools that also reflected a sense of aesthetics. The 19th century publications of Frere, and more importantly of Boucher de Perthes, in France, described pieces that were balanced, symmetrical and crafted with a formal purity.

25|$|Though Thompson's {{books were}} {{falling out of}} print in the United States, the French had {{discovered}} his works. Though they were not runaway bestsellers in France, his books did sell well enough in that country to keep a trickle of royalties flowing towards Thompson. Incidentally, Polito also debunks the myth that Thompson was not paid well for his works: Thompson's pay, he notes, was roughly {{in line with what}} writers of <b>similar</b> <b>works</b> received during that era.

25|$|Flemish genre {{painting}} is {{strongly tied to}} the traditions of Pieter Bruegel the Elder and was a style that continued directly into the 17th century through copies and new compositions made by his sons Pieter Brueghel the Younger and Jan Brueghel the Elder.

It is crowned by a balcony decorated with composite pilasters and a triangular frontispiece. The east façade is also decorated with composite pillars designed to resemble those of the Roman Forum or <b>similar</b> <b>works</b> from antiquity.
