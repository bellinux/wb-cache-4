The number of serial sections varies from 360 in sudden intrauterine unexplained death (SIUD) to 600 in term fetuses to over 1400 sections in {{sudden infant death syndrome}} (SIDS) victims. The procedure is not applicable in all histopathological laboratories, owing to the need for additional technical personnel. The simplified procedure allows a remarkable reduction of the number of sections. The brainstem is divided into 3 blocks. The first, cranial block, extends from the border between the medulla oblongata and pons up to the upper pole of the olivary nucleus. The second, intermediate block, corresponding to the submedian area of the inferior olivary nucleus, has as reference point the obex and extends 2 to 3 mm above and below the obex itself. The third, caudal block, includes the lower pole of the inferior olivary nucleus and the lower adjacent area of the medulla oblongata. Examinations of the brainstems from 106 SIDS victims, 30 controls, and 51 stillborns underlined a remarkable variability, particularly of the arcuate nucleus.

40|$|The {{examination}} timetabling (exam-timeslot-room assignment) problem involves assigning exams to {{a specific}} or limited number of times lots and rooms, {{with the aim of}} satisfying the hard constraints and the soft constraints as much as possible. Most of the techniques reported in the literature have been applied to solve <b>simplified</b> <b>examination</b> benchmark datasets, available within the scientific literature. In this research we bridge the gap between research and practice by investigating a problem taken from the Universiti Malaysia Pahang (UMP), a real world capacitated examination timetabling problem. This dataset has several novel constraints, in addition to those commonly used in the literature. Additionally, the invigilator scheduling problem (invigilalor assignment) was also investigated as it has not received the same level of research attention as the examination scheduling (although it is just as important to educational institutions). The formal models are defined, and constructive heuristics was developed for both problems in which the overall problems are solved with a two-phase approach which involves scheduling the exam to timeslot and room, and follows with scheduling the invigilator. During the invigilator assignment, we assume that there is already an examination timetable in place (i. e. previously generated). It reveals that the invigilator scheduling solution dependent on the number of rooms selected from the exam-timeslot-room assignment phase (i. e. a lesser number of used rooms would minimises the invigilation duties for staft), this encourages us to further improve the exam-timeslot- room timetable solution. An improvement on the result was carried out using modified extended great deluge algorithm (modified-GOA) and multi-neighbourhood GOA approach (that use more than one neighbourhood during the search). The modified-GOA uses a simple to understand parameter and allows the boundary that acts as the acceptance level, to dynamically change during the search. The propose approaches able to produce good quality solution when compared to the solutions from the proprietary software used by UMP. In addition, our solutions adhere to all hard constraints which the current systems fail to do. Finally, we extend our research onto investigating the Second International Timetabling Competition (ITC 2007) dataset as it also contains numerous constraints much similar to UMP datasets. Our propose approach able to produce competitive solutions when compared to the solutions produced by other reported works in the literature.

40|$|Previous parts {{provide a}} {{comprehensive}} {{introduction to the}} C language syntax, and the modern study of computer algorithms and data structures. Following those parts, this book presents many solutions to problem-based examinations using the C language. Problems are extracted from examination tests of the "Algorithms and Programming" course delivered within the Computer Engineering Bachelor-level degree at Politecnico di Torino. The text is intended primarily for use in undergraduate or graduate courses in algorithms and data structures. The content of the previous parts {{should be considered as}} prerequisites for reading this book. We have attempted to make every problem accessible and interesting. We also provide careful explanations of the main mathematical and algorithmic issues. The volume is divided in two chapters. The first one includes only completely solved examination-based problems. Those correspond to 16 examination tests, i. e., 16 standard and 16 <b>simplified</b> <b>examination</b> tests, for a total of 64 completely solved exercises. The second chapter includes only suggested problems, taken from 10 mock examination-based tests, again each one including a standard and a simplified section, for a total of 40 suggested problems. As in the examination of "Algorithms and programming", those exercises mainly include the following topics: Sorting, static and dynamic data structures, recursion, abstract objects, collections of objects and abstract data types (ADTs), trees, symbol tables (such as Binary Search Trees, BSTs, and Hash Tables), and graphs. Simplified exercises target the guided development of the solution to a problem, with only a small emphasis on design and problem-solving skills and more emphasis on the ability to use advanced C features (pointers, dynamic allocation, recursion) and on the knowledge of basic data structures and algorithms. For those simplified problems, only the code required by the examination specification is reported in the text, i. e., clients, data definitions and data initialization are often not reported in the book for the sake of space. Standard exercises target the design and development of a program in C to solve a problem, the main emphasis being on the algorithm and data-structure adopted, and on problem-solving and design skills. Exercise and solution style follow the ones introduced in previous volumes by the same author. C syntax is somehow restricted to the minimum set of constructs, avoiding useless or redundant ones. Solution design is maintained as simple as possible, keeping in mind asymptotic time and memory costs. Each solution can be mono or multi-file. In this last case, book sub-titles specify the file name to correctly follow the inclusion of header files and type definitions. Solutions are usually introduced by short descriptions, illustrating the main philosophy and core ideas behind them. Simplified specifications (but sometimes even standard ones) may be followed by more than one solution, illustrating the main logic possibilities to reach the same final target. The book is also covered by online material, as all source codes are available on the editor web page.

Entre suas formas de manifestação está a pré-eclâmpsia, cuja etiologia é desconhecida e a fisiopatologia não está totalmente esclarecida. É causa de alterações em todo o organismo materno, destacando as manifestações no sistema nervoso central (SNC). Uma das formas de verificar e acompanhar esse comprometimento do SNC é o exame simplificado de reflexo profundo do tendão. Para avaliar o comprometimento a nível periférico do SNC, o presente trabalho propôs a realização da eletromiografia (EMG) do músculo quadríceps femoral (vasto medial - VM e vasto lateral – VL), no momento em que é estimulado artificialmente o reflexo patelar com um martelo de exame neurológico. A atividade elétrica dos músculos VM e VL foi registrada pelo aparelho MyoTrac com dois canais, conectado a um notebook da marca Toshiba. Foram estudadas 21 gestantes com pré-eclâmpsia (grupo PE) comparadas com 20 gestantes normais (grupo NL). Os resultados obtidos comparando os dois grupos foram estatisticamente significativos para o músculo VL, com valores menores encontrados no grupo PE (38, 72 μV x 71, 72 μV). Comparando as avaliações do grupo PE durante a gestação, 24 e 48 horas após o parto, os valores foram menores durante a gestação (38, 72 x 73, 35 x 71, 85 respectivamente).

40|$|Objectives: To compare {{assessments}} of the marginal bone level around dental implants in the mandible using periapical radiography and Scanora detailed narrow beam (DNB) radiography. METHODS: Forty patients treated with Brånemark dental implants in the lower jaw were examined with periapical and Scanora DNB radiography. Ten implants were selected {{from each of the}} four dental regions (molar, incisor, canine, premolar), and no more than one implant was selected from the same patient. Seven observers assessed the level of the marginal bone on the mesial and distal surfaces of the implants. Three of the observers made all the assessments twice. RESULTS: Agreement between the methods was 61 %. The highest agreement was found in the molar region. In DNB radiography the marginal bone level was observed to be situated more “coronally” in 17 % and more “apically” in 22 % compared with periapical radiography. The kappa value for interobserver agreement for all observers was 0. 33 for periapical radiography and 0. 27 for DNB radiography. The weighted kappa value for intraobserver agreement ranged from 0. 75 to 0. 99 for DNB radiography and from 0. 94 to 0. 98 for periapical radiography.

We also sought to <b>simplify</b> the monofilament <b>examination</b> by reducing it to fewer touch points. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study at 10 centers in the United States, Canada, and Switzerland, general internists and residents performed a structured history and physical examination for neuropathy on the feet of diabetic patients. Independent examination by two observers included monofilament sensation, pinprick, vibration, position sense, and ankle reflexes. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 304 patients were examined {{by at least one}} practitioner, and 200 received duplicate examinations. Monofilament examination and ankle reflexes had the best reproducibility, with moderate agreement (kappa = 0. 59); pinprick, position, and vibration sense had fair agreement (kappa = 0. 28 - 0. 36). No component of the history or physical examination, singly or in aggregate, was both sensitive and specific for identifying a patient with an abnormal monofilament <b>examination.</b> A <b>simplified</b> monofilament <b>examination</b> using only 4 sites per foot (total 8 sites) detected 90 % of patients with an abnormal 16 -site monofilament evaluation.

Variable rate A/D optical clocking is used {{to acquire}} linear-in-k OCT fringe data at 100 kHz axial scan rate with 5. 3 um axial resolution in tissue. Fixed rate sampling at 1 GSPS achieves a 7. 5 mm imaging range in tissue with 6. 0 um axial resolution at 100 kHz axial scan rate. A 200 kHz axial scan rate with 5. 3 um axial resolution over 4 mm imaging range is achieved by buffering the laser sweep. Dual spot OCT using two parallel interferometers achieves 400 kHz axial scan rate, almost 2 X faster than previous 1050 nm ophthalmic results and 20 X faster than current commercial instruments. Superior sensitivity roll-off performance is shown. Imaging is demonstrated in the human retina and anterior segment. Wide field 12 × 12 mm data sets include the macula and optic nerve head. Small area, high density imaging shows individual cone photoreceptors. The 7. 5 mm imaging range configuration can show the cornea, iris, and anterior lens in a single image. These improvements in imaging speed and depth range provide important advantages for ophthalmic imaging.

Based on the theory of relational matrix, the method obtains an R-schedule to meet all the time constraints. Finally, this paper implements a <b>simplified</b> arrangement of <b>examination</b> timetable and verifies the effectiveness and the usability of the method. ? 2013 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|A {{standard}} method for transoral diagnostic and dissection of tumour is the endoscopic examination plus microscopic and laser supported surgery. For endoscopic examination {{a set of}} rigid endoscopes with different angles of view are {{on the market and}} in use. To <b>simplify</b> the diagnostic <b>examination,</b> a first idea was to use an endoscope with flexible angles of view. A further step of this approach is the electrical angulation of the endoscopic view to enable an adaption on the surgery site without using the hands. Thus the hands are free for intervention. This paper shows a first implementation of a prototype of an electrical operated endoscope for a free hand imaging in transoral interventions...|$|R
40|$|SummaryIntroductionObstructive {{sleep apnea}} {{syndrome}} (OSAS) may be suspected at interview, notably {{in case of}} snoring. Various studies suggested a link between primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and OSAS. The present study sought to determine OSAS prevalence in POAG associated with snoring. Material and methodsThirty-one snoring glaucomatous patients prospectively underwent <b>simplified</b> polysomnography. Ophthalmologic <b>examination</b> ruled out secondary glaucoma and assessed the glaucomatous neuropathy. Results 49 % of the patients included were diagnosed with OSAS. Ophthalmologically, glaucoma showed no specific characteristics. ConclusionGiven the high-prevalence of OSAS in patients with POAG, presence of snoring should be explored at interview. Conversely, patients who snore should be asked whether they have POAG, and if so, should undergo all-night sleep recording to explore for OSAS...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHTTP and HTTPS traffic {{recorded}} at {{the perimeter of}} an organization is an exhaustive data source for the forensic investigation of security incidents. However, due to the nested nature of today's Web page structures, {{it is a huge}} manual effort to tell apart benign traffic caused by regular user browsing from malicious traffic that relates to malware or insider threats. We present Hviz, an interactive visualization approach to represent the event timeline of HTTP and HTTPS activities of a workstation in a comprehensible manner. Hviz facilitates incident investigation by structuring, aggregating, and correlating HTTP events between workstations {{in order to reduce the}} number of events that are exposed to an investigator while preserving the big picture. We have implemented a prototype system and have used it to evaluate its utility using synthetic and real-world HTTP traces from a campus network. Our results show that Hviz is able to significantly reduce the number of user browsing events that need to be exposed to an investigator by distilling the structural properties of HTTP traffic, thus <b>simplifying</b> the <b>examination</b> of malicious activities that arise from malware traffic or insider threats...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{published}} data {{to support}} recommendations for prevention and management of well-appearing at-risk newborns (WAARNs) for early-onset sepsis (EOS) are limited. Methods: Retrospective cohort study comparing two different strategies for managing WAARNs (≥ 35 weeks gestation) during a 6 -year period (Period 1, from 2005 to 2007; Period 2, from 2009 to 2011). WAARNs were defined as healthy-appearing neonates evaluated because of risk factors for EOS. Laboratory evaluation plus <b>simplified</b> physical <b>examination</b> (Period 1) was compared with physical examination alone (PEA, Period 2). The use of antibiotics, the length of stay, the timeliness of diagnosis {{and the risk of}} falling ill immediately after hospital discharge in both periods were also compared. Results: WAARNs receiving empirical antibiotics were 14 / 500 (Period 1) and 3 / 500 (Period 2, p = 0. 01). Median length of stay was 4 (Period 1) and 3 days (Period 2, p = 0. 04). Symptoms of EOS were earlier than laboratory evaluation results in 42 / 44 neonates. Severe disease was diagnosed within 6 h of life in all neonates. No WAARNs presented with EOS following hospital discharge. Conclusions: WAARNs managed through PEA received less unnecessary antibiotics and had a shorter length of stay. They had no increased risk of severe complications or increased risk of becoming ill following hospital discharge...|$|R
40|$|Predictive {{performance}} {{tools are}} {{an important factor in}} the success of any new technology because they permit demonstration of whether a system will be efficient and economically feasible. A reliable predictive tool should allow the designer to optimise system performance and to maximise the cost effectiveness of a system prior to installation. This article discusses the five main parametric models for photovoltaic (PV) systems available in the literature. The current–voltage characteristics of a photovoltaic module can be reproduced modelling the PV panel as an equivalent electrical circuit made of linear and non-linear components. The parameters describing such components are directly related to the performance characteristics of the specific PV panel, which are generally available in a graphic form with respect to standard values of temperature and incident irradiance. Five of the most recent models are analysed in detail describing the algorithm, showing how the parameters were determined and highlighting the most important mathematical and physical assumptions that characterised each model and the calculation process. To <b>simplify</b> the <b>examination</b> and reading of the procedures referred to in the five models, all equations are rewritten using the same nomenclature. Furthermore, to assess the accuracy of each model with respect to the data provided by the manufacturer, this paper compares the I–V and P–V curves at various temperatures and irradiance for a generic PV panel...|$|R
40|$|Biomedical {{engineering}} {{is a unique}} area that allows fusion between two distinct fields of engineering and medicine. The integration of efforts from both fields promises progress through acquisition of information from tissues, cells, and organs through non-invasive methods of assessment. Here we investigate {{the ability of a}} hyperspectral device in extracting data from tissues through the wavelength spectrum, in foreseeing its potential in clinical diagnostics by <b>simplifying</b> methods of <b>examination</b> by clinicians in detecting corneal injuries. Hyperspectral imaging using 400 to 1000 nm visible wavelength was used to scan five porcine eyes (injured and non-injured). Images were saved in three dimensional images of rows, columns, and depth slices at 1200 to 1300 x 804 x 604 and were processed. All laboratory works were performed in accordance with the general risk assessment of University of Strathclyde. In our results, analysis of the images reveals significant cue between 500 to 800 nm bands in differentiating between injured and noninjured parts of the eye...|$|R
