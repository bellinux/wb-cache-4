40|$|The fully {{automated}} in-situ measuring system SIOUX (<b>Stratospheric</b> <b>Observation</b> Unit for nitrogen oXides) {{has been developed}} and established under flight conditions. SIOUX is a two channel measuring device designed for the high-altitude research aircraft M 55 -Geophysica to record reactive nitrogen oxides in the upper troposphere and the lower stratosphere. Channel A detects nitric oxide (NO) and channel B the total reactive nitrogen (NO_y), which is reduced to NO {{on the surface of}} a heated gold-converter in conjunction with carbon monoxide (CO) as reducing agent. The technique used for the measurement of NO is chemiluminescence. The detection limit of channel A is 6 pmol/mol and of channel B 10 pmol/mol for an integration time of 1 s. The main components of SIOUX are the sample inlet, the detector incorporating the reaction chambers, photomultipliers and ozone generators, the converter, a pumping system, a calibration/operation gas system and the data recording unit. Except for the sample inlet all components are housed in a pressurised aluminium container. This has a length of 1. 1 m, a diameter of 0. 6 m and a total mass of 250 kg; the maximum power consumption of SIOUX is 1300 W. For aeronautical compliance four test procedures were required to guarantee the flight compatibility of the mechanics and electronics of the device: shock/vibration/EMC(ElectroMagneticCompatibility) /pressure test. In October 2001 SIOUX was implemented for the first time aboard the M 55 -Geophysica during a test campaign in Russia. There, the measuring system was monitored under flight conditions and its operation was established for stratospheric conditions. Mixing ratios for NO and NO_y were registered up to an altitude of 20 km. In July 2002 SIOUX was used aboard the M 55 -Geophysica for validation the ENVISAT instrument MIPAS-E in Italy. A comparison was made for the first time between MIPAS-E measurements of nitric acid (HNO_ 3) and SIOUX measurements of NO_y-NO_x (#approx#HNO_ 3 in the altitude range 17 - 20 km). A mean deviation of 20 %#+-# 6 % between the MIPAS-E and the SIOUX data was registered. (orig.)

40|$|Abstract. Among {{the major}} factors {{controlling}} ozone {{loss in the}} polar vortices in winter/spring is the kinetics of the ClO dimer catalytic cycle. Here, we propose a strategy to test and improve our understanding of these kinetics by comparing and combining information on the thermal equilibrium between ClO and Cl 2 O 2, the rate of Cl 2 O 2 formation, and the Cl 2 O 2 photolysis rate from laboratory experiments, theoretical studies and field observations.

40|$|The climate {{response}} {{to changes in}} radiative forcing depends crucially on climate feedback processes, with the consequence that solar and greenhouse gas forcing have both similar response patterns in the troposphere. This circumstance complicates significantly the attribution {{of the causes of}} climate change. Additionally, the climate system displays a high level of unforced intrinsic variability, and significant variations in the climate of {{many parts of the world}} are due to internal processes. Such internal modes contribute significantly to the variability of climate system on various time scales, and thus compete with external forcing in explaining the origin of past climate extremes. This highlights the need for independent observations of solar forcing including long-term consistent observational records of the total and spectrally resolved solar irradiance. The stratospheric {{response to}} solar forcing is different from its response to greenhouse gas forcing, thus suggesting that <b>stratospheric</b> <b>observations</b> could offer the best target for the identification of the specific influence of solar forcing on climate...|$|R

The relevant transport processes are adequately represented in the analyses as long as vertical and horizontal scales exceed roughly 0. 5 - 1 km in the vertical and 50 km horizontally, while smaller structures and larger gradients are smoothed out.

40|$|Though the {{presence}} of intermittent turbulence in the stratosphere has been well established, much remains unknown about it. In situ observations of this phenomenon, which have provided the greatest details of it, have mostly been achieved via sounding balloons (i. e., small balloons which burst at peak altitude) carrying constant-temperature hot-wire anemometers (CTAs). The Turbulence and Intermittency Long-Duration Atmospheric Experiment (TILDAE) was developed to test a new paradigm for <b>stratospheric</b> <b>observations.</b> Rather than flying on a sounding balloon, TILDAE was incorporated as an add-on experiment to the payload of a NASA long-duration balloon mission that launched in January 2016 from McMurdo Station, Antarctica.

During the balloon's ascent, TILDAE's sonic anemometer provided atmospheric measurements up to an altitude of about 18  km, beyond which the ambient air pressure was too low for the instrument to function properly. Efforts are currently underway to scientifically analyze these observations of small-scale fluctuations in the troposphere, tropopause, and stratosphere and to develop strategies for increasing the maximum operating altitude of the sonic anemometer...|$|R

40|$|Interstellar dust {{appears in}} a number of roles in the {{interstellar}} medium. Historically, the most familiar one is as a source of extinction in the optical. Absorbed optical and ultraviolet light heats the dust, whence infrared (including near-infrared to submillimeter) emission, the particular theme of this review. In some distant galaxies, most of the luminosity of the galaxy is thus converted into the infrared, though in the Milky Way the situation is not generally as extreme, except in localized regions of star formation. I briefly review the range of physical conditions in which the dust emits in the interstellar medium and the various sizes of dust probed. Of interest astrophysically are observations of both the spectrum and the spatial distribution of the emission, preferably in combination. In the past fifteen year probes of dust emission have advanced significantly: through IRAS, KAO, COBE experiments, IRTS, ISO, and MSX.

40|$|In {{order to}} predict the effects of {{anthropogenic}} perturbations (such as the increase of chlorine) and natural events (such as volcanic eruptions) on the chemical composition of the stratosphere, {{it is essential to}} quantitatively test our knowledge of the photochemistry by conducting detailed comparisons between <b>stratospheric</b> <b>observations</b> and models. Through such comparisons, this thesis focuses on explaining sets of simultaneous measurements obtained from balloon (Chapters 3, 4, 5) and ER- 2 aircraft (Chapters 2, 6) platforms, with particular emphasis on the basic chemical processes underlying the partitioning of the chlorine and nitrogen families in the stratosphere. Following an introductory first chapter, Chapter 2 tests our knowledge of the photochemical balance between NO 2 and NO. Chapter 3 examines the effects of enhanced heterogeneous chemistry resulting from the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo on the partitioning between NO 2 and HNO 3. Chapter 4 discusses the factors controlling the distribution of chlorine between its main reservoirs (HCl, ClON 2) and more reactive (HOCl and ClO) forms. Chapter 5 questions the completeness of our understanding of chlorine chemistry and proposes the existence of a new atmospheric species perchloric acid, HClO 4. Finally, Chapter 6 focuses on the heterogeneous processes taking place during the Antarctic winter and their effect on the evolution of reactive chlorine and nitrogen species within and outside of the polar vortex...|$|R
40|$|The {{photolysis}} of ClOOCl limits loss of {{polar ozone}} by the ClO+ClO cycle. New laboratory {{measurements of the}} ClOOCl cross section suggest that its photolysis is about a factor of six slower than a value based on current recommendations. We show the incorporation of these new cross sections into a photochemical model leads to poor agreement with values of ClO and ClOOCl measured during the SOLVE campaign, with the model under-estimating measured ClO and over-estimating measured ClOOCl by amounts that are {{much larger than the}} measurement uncertainties. These comparisons indicate that a model using the new cross section, and no other changes, provides a poor description of the partitioning of ClO and ClOOCl. Such a simulation also results in much slower ozone loss rates compared to a model using standard chemistry. It should be noted that, {{in the absence of the}} new cross section, there is still inconsistencies in our understanding of stratospheric chlorine when compared to <b>stratospheric</b> <b>observations.</b> We use the SOLVE data set to test a variety of postulated processes, discussed in a companion presentation, that could be invoked to resolve these discrepancies. The SOLVE data set is noteworthy because it provides a comprehensive description of the diurnal variation ClO and ClOOCl partitioning.

40|$|A new stratospheric {{ensemble}} Kalman smoother (EnKS) {{system is}} introduced, {{and the potential}} of assimilating posterior <b>stratospheric</b> <b>observations</b> to better constrain the whole model state at analysis time is investigated. A set of idealised perfect-model Observation System Simulation Experiments (OSSE) assimilating synthetic limb-sounding temperature or ozone retrievals are performed with a chemistry&#x 2013;climate model. The impact during the analysis step is characterised {{in terms of the}} root mean square error reduction between the forecast state and the analysis state. The performances of (1) a fixed-lag EnKS assimilating observations spread over 48 hours and (2) an ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) assimilating a denser network of observations are compared with a reference EnKF. The ozone assimilation with EnKS shows a significant additional reduction of analysis error of the order of 10 % for dynamical and chemical variables in the extratropical upper troposphere lower stratosphere (UTLS) and Polar Vortex regions when compared to the reference EnKF. This reduction has similar magnitude to the one achieved by the denser-network EnKF assimilation. Similarly, the temperature assimilation with EnKS significantly decreases the error in the UTLS for the wind variables like the denser-network EnKF assimilation. However, the temperature assimilation with EnKS has little or no significant impact on the temperature and ozone analyses, whereas the denser-network EnKF shows improvement with respect to the reference EnKF. The different analysis impacts from the assimilation of current and posterior ozone observations indicate the capacity of time-lagged background-error covariances to represent temporal interactions up to 48 hours between variables during the ensemble data assimilation analysis step, and the possibility to use posterior observations whenever additional current observations are unavailable. The possible application of the EnKS for reanalyses is highlighted...|$|R
40|$|The Arctic winter 2010 / 2011 was {{characterized}} by a persistent vortex with extremely low temperatures in the lower stratosphere above northern Scandinavia leading to a strong activation of chlorine compounds (ClO x) like Cl, Cl 2, ClO, ClOOCl, OClO, and HOCl, which rapidly destroyed ozone when sunlight returned after winter solstice. The MIPAS-B (Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding) and TELIS (TErahertz and submillimeter LImb Sounder) balloon measurements obtained in northern Sweden on 31 March 2011 inside the polar vortex have provided vertical profiles of inorganic and organic chlorine species as well as diurnal variations of ClO around sunrise over the whole altitude range in which chlorine has been undergoing activation and deactivation. This flight was performed {{at the end of}} the winter during the last phase of ClO x deactivation. The complete inorganic and organic chlorine partitioning and budget for 31 March 2011, assumed to be representative for the late-winter Arctic stratosphere, has been derived by combining MIPAS-B and TELIS simultaneously observed molecules. A total chlorine amount of 3. 41 ± 0. 30 parts per billion by volume is inferred from the measurements (above 24 km). This value is in line with previous <b>stratospheric</b> <b>observations</b> carried out outside the tropics confirming the slightly decreasing chlorine amount in the stratosphere.

These measurements include tropospheric as well as lower <b>stratospheric</b> <b>observations.</b> Complex advection and rapid vertical transport associated with meso- and synoptic scale dynamical processes reflect in inhomogeneous water vapor distributions along the flight paths, as observed by the lidar. The DIAL vertical H 2 O cross sections are compared to operational ECMWF analyses at T 511 /L 60 and T 799 /L 91 resolution, interpolated in space and time to the flight path. Qualitatively, the tropical (Hadley) circulation, stratospheric intrusions and humidity transitions between different air masses are analyzed by ECMWF with remarkable accuracy. Locally however, relative shifts and differing shapes of structures, particularly those exhibiting large q-gradients and being subject to rapid temporal development may cause considerable deviations. The relevant transport processes are adequately represented in the ECMWF analyses as long as vertical and horizontal scales exceed roughly 0. 5 - 1 km in the vertical and roughly 50 km horizontally. Recently, impact studies at ECMWF started to investigate possible analysis and forecast improvement by assimilating these water vapour observations. First experiments indicated a reduction of the first-guess (12 h forecast) error compared to a control run, and the investigation of background and analysis departures confirmed the high quality of the data set.

First, through the flow-of-the-day ensemble background error covariances that are blended together with the static background error covariance. Second, via the ozone continuity equation in the tangent linear model and adjoint used for minimizing the cost function. All experiments assimilate actual conventional data and satellite-derived wind vectors in order to maintain nearly the same realistic troposphere. In the stratosphere, the experiments assimilate simulated ozone and/or radiance observations in various combinations. The simulated observations are taken from a 16 -day truth experiment (TE), which is an analysis with no <b>stratospheric</b> <b>observations.</b> The impact of ozone on the analysis is evaluated by comparing the experiments to the TE. Ozone assimilation is found to benefit the winds and temperatures when data are of sufficient quality and frequency. For example, global hourly ozone data with no error constrains the stratospheric winds and temperature to within ~ 2  m s − 1 and ~ 1  K, respectively. This demonstrates that there is dynamical information in the ozone distribution that can potentially be used to improve the stratosphere. This is particularly important for the tropics, where radiance observations have difficulty constraining winds due to their broad weighting functions and breakdown of geostrophic balance. Global ozone assimilation provides the largest benefit when the hybrid blending coefficient is an intermediate value (0. 5 was used in this study), rather than 0. 0 (no ensemble background error covariances) or 1. 0 (no static background error covariances), which is consistent with other hybrid DA studies. Reduction of the ozone sampling frequency, addition of observational noise, or inclusion of radiance observations all reduce the benefit of ozone. For example, a single polar-orbiting ozone measurement set with realistic errors has no significant impact on the wind analysis when a full suite of radiance observations is also assimilated. An examination of cross-correlations between ozone and other variables shows that a single ozone observation behaves like a potential vorticity (PV) charge, or a monopole of PV, with rotation about a vertical axis and vertically oriented temperature dipole. Further understanding of this relationship may help in designing observation systems that would optimize the impact of ozone on the dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Lower <b>stratospheric</b> in situ <b>observations</b> {{are used}} to {{quantify}} both the accumulated ozone loss and the ozone chemical loss rates in the Arctic polar vortex during the 1999 - 2000 winter. Multiple long-lived trace gas correlations {{are used to}} identify parcels in the inner Arctic vortex whose chemical loss rates are unaffected by extra-vortex intrusions. Ozone-tracer correlations are then used to calculate ozone chemical loss rates. During the late winter the ozone chemical loss rate {{is found to be}} - 46 +/- 6 (1 sigma) ppbv/day.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} set of stratospheric balloon {{and aircraft}} samples was analyzed for the position-dependent isotopic composition of nitrous oxide (N 2 O). Results {{for a total}} of 220 samples from between 1987 and 2003 are presented, nearly tripling the number of mass-spectrometric N 2 O isotope measurements in the stratosphere published to date. Cryogenic balloon samples were obtained at polar (Kiruna/Sweden, 68 ° N), mid-latitude (southern France, 44 ° N) and tropical sites (Hyderabad/India, 18 ° N). Aircraft samples were collected with a newly-developed whole air sampler on board of the high-altitude aircraft M 55 Geophysica during the EUPLEX 2003 campaign. All samples were analyzed by laboratory mass spectrometry for their 18 O/ 16 O and position-dependent 15 N/ 14 N isotope ratios with very high precision (standard deviation about 0. 15 per mil for 18 O/ 16 O and average 15 N/ 14 N ratios, about 0. 5 per mil for 15 NNO/ 14 NNO and N 15 NO/N 14 NO ratios). For mixing ratios above 200 nmol mol − 1, relative isotope enrichments (δ values) and mixing ratios display a compact relationship, which is nearly independent of latitude and season and which can be explained equally well by Rayleigh fractionation or mixing. However, for mixing ratios below 200 nmol mol − 1 this compact relationship gives way to meridional, seasonal and interannual variations. A comparison to a previously published mid-latitude balloon profile even shows large zonal variations, justifying the use of three-dimensional models for further data interpretation. In general, the magnitude of the apparent fractionation constants (apparent isotope effects) increases continuously with altitude and decreases from the equator to the North pole, which can be qualitatively understood by the interplay between the time-scales of N 2 O photochemistry and transport. Deviations from this behavior occur where polar vortex air mixes with nearly N 2 O-free upper stratospheric/mesospheric air (e. g., during the boreal winter of 2003 and possibly 1992). Aircraft observations in the polar vortex at mixing ratios below 200 nmol mol − 1 deviate from isotope variations expected for both Rayleigh fractionation and end-member mixing, but could be explained by continuous weak mixing between intravortex and extravortex air (Plumb et al., 2000). Finally, correlations between 18 O/ 16 O and average 15 N/ 14 N isotope ratios or between the position-dependent 15 N/ 14 N isotope ratios show that photo-oxidation makes a large contribution to the total N 2 O sink in the lower stratosphere (up to 100 %). Towards higher altitudes, the temperature dependence of these isotope correlations becomes visible in the <b>stratospheric</b> <b>observations...</b>|$|R
40|$|Volcanic eruptions impact climate {{through the}} {{injection}} {{of sulfur dioxide}} (SO 2), which is oxidized to form sulfuric acid aerosol particles that can enhance the stratospheric aerosol optical depth (SAOD). Besides large-magnitude eruptions, moderate-magnitude eruptions such as Kasatochi in 2008 and Sarychev Peak in 2009 can {{have a significant impact}} on stratospheric aerosol and hence climate. However, uncertainties remain in quantifying the atmospheric and climatic impacts of the 2009 Sarychev Peak eruption due to limitations in previous model representations of volcanic aerosol microphysics and particle size, whilst biases have been identified in satellite estimates of post-eruption SAOD. In addition, the 2009 Sarychev Peak eruption co-injected hydrogen chloride (HCl) alongside SO 2, whose potential stratospheric chemistry impacts have not been investigated to date. We present a study of the stratospheric SO 2 -particle-HCl processing and impacts following Sarychev Peak eruption, using the CESM 1 (WACCM) -CARMA sectional aerosol microphysics model (with no a priori assumption on particle size). The Sarychev Peak 2009 eruption injected 0. 9  Tg of SO 2 into the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS), enhancing the aerosol load in the Northern hemisphere. The post-eruption evolution of the volcanic SO 2 in space and time are well reproduced by the model when compared to IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer) satellite data. Co-injection of 27  Gg HCl causes a lengthening of the SO 2 lifetime and a slight delay in the formation of aerosols, and acts to enhance the destruction of stratospheric ozone and mono-nitrogen oxides (NO x) compared to the simulation with volcanic SO 2 only. We therefore highlight the need to account for volcanic halogen chemistry when simulating the impact of eruptions such as Sarychev on stratospheric chemistry. The model-simulated evolution of effective radius (r eff), reflects new particle formation followed by particle growth that enhances r eff to reach up to 0. 2  µm on zonal average. Comparisons of the model-simulated particle number and size-distributions to balloon-borne in-situ <b>stratospheric</b> <b>observations</b> over Kiruna, Sweden, in August and September 2009, and over Laramie, U. S. A., in June and November 2009 show good agreement and quantitatively confirms the post-eruption particle enhancement. We show that the model-simulated SAOD is consistent with that derived from OSIRIS (Optical Spectrograph and InfraRed Imager System) when both the saturation bias of OSIRIS and the fact that extinction profiles may terminate well above the tropopause are taken into account. Previous modelling studies (involving assumptions on particle size) that reported agreement to (biased) post-eruption estimates of SAOD derived from OSIRIS likely underestimated the climate impact of the 2009 Sarychev Peak eruption...|$|R
40|$|A four-dimensional variational (4 D-var) data {{assimilation}} system intended for operational application to <b>stratospheric</b> trace gas <b>observations</b> is being developed. The Kernel {{of this new}} system is a novel stratospheric global chemistry circulation model (GCCM) and its adjoint version. The German Weather Service’s global forecast model (GME) with its icosahedral discretisation scheme serves as an online meteorological driver for the GCCM. As a first application of the new system, ENVISAT MI-PAS data has been assimilated for a selected period. It can be demonstrated that the assimilation procedure gains a considerable improvement over legacy model runs, as the discrepancies between observations and the model are significantly reduced, while chemical consistency is maintained by the computationally costly, but efficient 4 D-var technique...|$|R
