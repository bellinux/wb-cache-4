40|$|Assuring and {{evolving}} concurrent programs requires under-standing the concurrency-related design decisions used {{in their}} implementation. In Java-style shared-memory pro-grams, these decisions include which state is shared, how access to it is regulated, the roles of threads, and the policy that distinguishes desired concurrency from race conditions. These decisions rarely have purely local manifestations in code. In this paper, we use case studies from production Java code to explore {{the costs and benefits}} of a new annotation-based approach for expressing design intent. Our intent is both to assist in establishing &quot;thread safety &quot; attributes in code and to support tools that safely restructure code [...] for example, shifting critical section boundaries or <b>splitting</b> <b>locks.</b> The annotations we use express &quot;mechanical &quot; proper-ties such as lock-state associations, uniqueness of references, and encapsulation of state into named aggregations. Our analyses revealed race conditions in our case study samples, drawn from open-source projects and library code. The novel technical features of this approach include (1) flexible encapsulation via aggregations of state that can cross object boundaries ~ (2) the association of locks with state aggregations, (3) policy descriptions for allowable method interleavings, and (4) the incremental process for inserting, validating, and exploiting annotations...|$|R
5000|$|The Boss 351 was {{the most}} potent {{high-performance}} variant of the 351C available only in the 1971 Boss 351 Mustang. Rated at 330 bhp (246 kW), it was fitted with a four-barrel Autolite model 4300-D spreadbore carburetor, an aluminum intake manifold, solid lifters, dual-point distributor, a six-quart oil pan, and cast-aluminum valve covers. Forged domed pistons gave an 11.3:1 nominal (11.1:1 advertised) compression ratio which made premium fuel necessary. It had four-bolt main bearing caps selected for hardness and a premium cast-iron crankshaft selected for hardness (90% nodularity). The cylinder head was modified for better airflow, used screw-in studs with adjustable rocker arms, and except for the water passages were basically the same heads used on the Boss 302. [...] The valvetrain used hardened and ground push rods with guide plates, and single grove-hardened valve <b>split</b> <b>locks.</b> The forged connecting rods were shot-peened and magnafluxed for strength, and used improved durability 180,000 PSI 3/8-inch nuts and bolts. The R-code Boss 351 Mustang was only installed in the 1971 Boss 351 Mustang, and it came equipped with Ram Air induction. Ford manufactured 1,806 Boss 351 Mustangs in 1971, 591 of which are registered and accounted for on the Boss 351 Registry site.|$|R

I shut the door of the study behind me, and, seizing a poker, began an attack upon the desk. That is how they found me. The cover of the desk was <b>split,</b> the <b>lock</b> smashed, the letters torn out of the pigeon-holes, and tossed about the room. In my senile rage I had flung about the pens and other such light stationery, and overturned the ink. Moreover, a large vase upon the mantel had got broken--I do not know how.

I was battering madly at the drawers, when the butler, backed by two women-servants, intruded upon me.|$|R
40|$|One often {{wonders how}} well Linux scales. We {{frequently}} get suggestions that Linux cannot scale {{because it is}} a monolithic operating sys-tem kernel. However, microkernels have never scaled well and Linux has been scaled up to support thousands of processors, terabytes of memory and hundreds of petabytes of disk stor-age which is the hardware limit these days. Some of the techniques used to make Linux scale were per cpu areas, per node structures, <b>lock</b> <b>splitting,</b> cache line optimizations, mem-ory allocation control, scheduler optimizations and various other approaches. These required significant detail work on the code but no change in the general architecture of Linux. The presentation will give an overview of why Linux scales and shows the hurdles micro ker-nels would have to overcome in order to do the same. The presentation will assume a basic un-derstanding of how operating systems work and familiarity with what functions a kernel per-forms. ...|$|R
25|$|The {{emergence}} of Tony Lock as a slow left-arm bowler in 1949 brought a stuttering end of McMahon's Surrey career. Though {{he played in}} 12 first-class matches in the 1949 season, McMahon took only 19 wickets; a similar number of matches in 1950 brought 34 wickets. In 1951, he played just seven times and in 1952 only three times. In 1953, <b>Lock</b> <b>split</b> the first finger of his left hand, and played in only 11 of Surrey's County Championship matches; McMahon played as his deputy in 14 Championship matches, though a measure of their comparative merits was that Lock's 11 games produced 67 wickets at 12.38 runs apiece, while McMahon's 14 games brought him 45 wickets at the, for him, low average of 21.53. At {{the end of the}} 1953 season, McMahon was allowed to leave Surrey to join Somerset, then languishing {{at the foot of the}} County Championship and recruiting widely from other counties and other countries.|$|R
40|$|Three {{designs of}} {{hierarchical}} locking suitable for B-tree indexes are explored in detail and their {{advantages and disadvantages}} compared. Traditional hierarchies include index, leaf page, and key range or key value. Alternatively, locks on separator keys in interior B-tree pages can protect key ranges of different sizes. Finally, for keys consisting of multiple columns, key prefixes of different sizes permit a third form of hierarchical locking. Each of these approaches requires appropriate implementation techniques. The techniques explored here include node <b>splitting</b> and merging, <b>lock</b> escalation and lock de-escalation, and online changes in the granularity of locking. Those techniques are the first designs permitting introduction and removal of levels in a lock hierarchy on demand and without disrupting transaction or query processing. In addition, a simplification of traditional key range locking is introduced that applies principled hierarchical locking to keys in B-tree leaves. This new method of key range locking avoids counter-intuitive lock modes used in today’s highperformance database systems. Nonetheless, it increases concurrency among operations on individual keys and records beyond that enabled by traditional lock modes. ...|$|R
40|$|Trapping {{and cooling}} {{macroscopic}} objects using light has attracted great interest recently {{as it may}} enable us to see quantum mechanical features in large systems. A microsphere pendulum is one such system to put it to test. This thesis work is devoted to solving many of the steps necessary for future trapping and cooling works of a microsphere pendulum using a whispering gallery mode (WGM) cavity-based photonic molecule scheme. In the course of implementing this scheme, microcavity devices, such as microspheres and microbubbles were studied for topics as diverse as optomechanics, photonics, laser tuning and spectroscopy. The WGMs in the microsphere pendulum sense its mechanical mode through fibre taper coupling of light. Its properties in the evanescent light fields and its optomechanical transduction characteristics were investigated. This system is highly dissipative - a feature which {{could prove to be}} very useful for cavity cooling applications. Owing to its pressure tuning capability, a microbubble cavity {{can be used as a}} means of finding co-resonances as needed to achieve a photonic molecule and mode <b>splitting.</b> By <b>locking</b> a laser to a WGM of a microbubble resonator, linear tuning and stability characteristics of the WGM via pressure were studied. A fast method of sensing and estimation of dissipation and dispersion individually in an optomechanical system with minimal invasion was required. In this regard, cavity-ringup spectroscopy (CRUS) was investigated by simply measuring the peak height of the CRUS signal, enabling ultrafast sensing applications. Finally, a coupled, two cavity system, known as a photonic molecule, was studied for its optomechanical transduction properties in CMIT, ATS and their intermediate regimes making way for understanding the trapping capabilities of such a system. The range of studies in this thesis also illustrate the versatility of WGM-based resonators in optics measurements extending from fundamental optomechanics to applied photonics...|$|R
40|$|Spin orbit {{interaction}} can {{be strongly}} boosted when a heavy element is embedded into an inversion asymmetric crystal field. A simple structure {{to realize this}} concept in a 2 D crystal contains three atomic layers, a middle one built up from heavy elements generating strong atomic spin-orbit interaction and two neighboring atomic layers with different electron negativity. BiTeI is a promising candidate for such a 2 D crystal, since it contains heavy Bi layer between Te and I layers. Recently the bulk form of BiTeI attracted considerable attention due to its giant Rashba interaction, however, 2 D form of this crystal was not yet created. In this work we report the first exfoliation of single layer BiTeI using a recently developed exfoliation technique on stripped gold. Our combined scanning probe studies and first principles calculations show that SL BiTeI flakes with sizes of 100 μm were achieved which are stable at ambient conditions. The giant Rashba <b>splitting</b> and spin-momentum <b>locking</b> of this new member of 2 D crystals open the way towards novel spintronic applications and synthetic topological heterostructures.

40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Geology or Earth and Environmental Sciences, Department of Earth and Environmental SciencesThe Alaska-Aleutian subduction system spans more than 3, 000 km along the northern boundary of the Pacific Ocean and is the location of both devastating earthquakes and frequent volcanic eruptions. The potential for loss of life and destruction compels us to study {{the nature of the}} Alaska-Aleutian subduction system. However, numerous studies have raised more questions than they have answered, illuminating the complex nature of this arc such as changes in arc water content along arc, trench parallel shear wave <b>splitting</b> directions, and <b>locked</b> versus slipping regions of the subducting and overriding plate. A necessary component to understanding the complexities of this arc is 3 D subduction zone models. I have verified that the 3 D thermal and velocity models using the Sepran finite element package correspond to previously published 2 D. However, 3 D model resolution no greater than 2 km in the mantle wedge region where temperature and velocity change most rapidly is necessary. The desired mesh resolution requires that the mesh spanning the Alaska Peninsula to the western Aleutians must comprise more than 23 million elements. The Sepran package version 0310 is limited to 4 Gb of memory per core or roughly 2 million elements and does not support parallel programming. Thus in order to run the full 23 million element Alaska-Aleutian model, the newest version of Sepran 0315 which does support parallel programming must be utilized. Finally, solving for velocity in the subducting slab of a large, variable slab shape often results in violations of conservation of mass as required for the Boussinesq approximation. A combination of defining velocity parallel to the incoming plate velocity to a depth of 170 km in the slab followed by a method that defines velocity according to the elements dip is the best approach to minimizing deformation in the subducting slab...|$|R

It was easy to recognize the 4WD thanks to the large lateral fascia of plastic material, the wheel rims of a specific design without any hub caps, and the front and rear splash guard; to distinguish it further unique identification was written on the tailgate, on the side shields and the splash guard as standard. Inside was a novel covered steering wheel. The standard package included: a right external mirror, optional headlamp cleaning system, instrumentation and control system with tachometer, sunroof, electric windows, central <b>locking,</b> <b>split</b> rear seat, and a steering wheel adjustable for height. The Y10 4WD had a top speed of 145 km/h and accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in 17.4 seconds.|$|R
40|$|Due to differing {{treatment}} options and variable functional results treatment of proximal humeral fractures still remains challenging. Open reduction and internal fixation {{can lead to}} promising functional results. However, the rate of avascular necrosis of the humeral head, especially in comminuted fractures is increasing in the mid- to longterm follow up. This emphasizes the need of clinical and radiographic controls much longer than {{one year after the}} operation. Moreover secondary dislocation is a common problem after treatment of these fractures. Complex fractures, fracture dislocations, head <b>split</b> fractures and <b>locked</b> dislocations with vast damage of the articular surface can alternatively be treated with hemiarthroplasty. However, functional results are difficult to precict and depend on anatomic healing of the tuberosities to the humeral shaft and the prosthesis. Exact reconstruction of the humeral length, which is mandatory for anatomic tuberosity positioning has been difficult {{due to the lack of}} anatomic landmarks. The tendon of the pectoralis major muscle represents a reliable landmark for correct hight adjustment. Intraoperative use of this landmark shows in comparison to a control group a more exact reconstruction of the humeral length, an optimized centering of the prosthetic head and improved healing of the tuberosities with consecutive improved functional result. Exact analysis of positioning of the tuberosities and their healing is only possible with CT Scans. Even minor malpositioning of the tuberosities leads to decreased functional results and correlates to fatty degeneration of the rotator cuff. However, even correct positioning of the prosthesis and adequate refixation techniques can not predict healing of the tuberosities sufficiently. Biologic active implants can improve healing of the tuberosities in hemiarthroplasty and fracture healing in reconstructive surgery. Effects of treatment of human osteoblasts with certain concentrations of bisphosphonat coated implants leads in vitro to a positive bone balance. Formation and resorption activity of osteoclasts is inhibited in vitro. Moreover, effects of coated implants on co-cultures of osteoblasts and osteoclasts and their interaction lead to a positive bone balance. Treatment of fractures with bisphosphonat coated implants in an animal model accelerates biomechanic stability with improved values for maximal load and torsional stiffness. Biologic active implants improve bone healing and could thereby improve functional results of operative reconstruction and hemiarthroplasty of proximal humeral fractures...|$|R
40|$|There {{seems to}} be a {{tendency}} within the education of neuroscience and cognitive psychology to give little attention to what is not well understood. One subject that tends to get left out of education for this reason is the concept of consciousness. There have been, however, a number of studies that tried to address the question of how brain processes are related to consciousness. The main question of this thesis therefore is: what are, according to contemporary views, the cognitive and neuronal processes that are needed for, or correlated with conscious experience? Through high level cognitive theories a scientific understanding of consciousness was arrived. Based on this, lower level neural theories where developed, focusing on how neurons interact with each other, and which neurons/areas interact with each other during conscious and unconscious processing. Three important theories will be discussed to illustrate this. First, the global workspace hypothesis will be discussed which is a cognitive theory. It was developed to, for the first time after behaviourism, address questions on consciousness scientifically. It states that different forms of information are usually autonomously and unconsciously processed in different brain areas. Consciousness is however derived when brain areas share their output to a global ‘workspace’ onto which different areas are connected such as for instance memory, language and association areas. Second, the 40 Hz theory is discussed which was based on the same notions as the global workspace theory but which takes a neural point of view, and focuses on how remote brain areas communicate to form a unified conscious percept. It states that neurons in different brain areas that are involved in conscious percept, fire in synchronized oscillations in order to bind their information processing. Finally, the recurrent processing theory is considered which is also a neural theory of consciousness that is to some extend based on the notions of the global workspace hypotheses but focuses on which areas communicate during conscious percept and more specifically on the course of this communication. This theory deviates from previous theories of consciousness in its’ notion of how to measure consciousness. Most theories use an intuitive concept of consciousness, i. e. that people can report on what they are conscious of, and so reportability {{can be used as a}} measure of consciousness. However, the recurrent processing theory states that reportability might not always be sufficient for measuring consciousness (for instance in <b>split</b> brain and <b>locked</b> in patients) and states that a fully neural description of consciousness is needed. According to this theory, consciousness is arrived when recurrent processing between higher and lower order areas takes place, regardless of peoples reports...|$|R
