40|$|Aim of {{this work}} is the fatigue {{assessment}} of a main component of a valve actuator used for oil & gas, power and chemical industries, in order to comply with its heavy-duty applications. To do this, full-scale valve actuator assemblies made of S 355 J 2 steel have been fatigue tested under nominal axial loading. All specimens have been tested under stress-relieved conditions by adopting a nominal load ratio R=- 1. After experimental tests, the fatigue crack paths have been analysed by means of liquid penetrant inspections. The fatigue strength class of the considered yoke has been determined by statistically re-analysing the experimental results, {{expressed in terms of}} range of the nominal applied load, and it has been compared with the design condition required by the relevant European Standard, EN 15714 - 3 / 4. Finally, two methodologies for fatigue strength assessment of the considered <b>scotch</b> <b>yokes</b> have been proposed, which are based on experimental fatigue data derived from smooth or sharp V-notched specimens, respectively, made of the same yoke material. The assessment capability of the proposed methodologies has been evaluated and discussed by comparing theoretical estimations with the experimental fatigue results of the <b>scotch</b> <b>yokes...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Scotch</b> <b>Yoke</b> {{makes the}} pistons dwell very {{slightly}} longer at top dead center, so the fuel burns more completely {{in a smaller}} volume.|$|E
50|$|The term <b>scotch</b> <b>yoke</b> {{continues}} to be used when the slot in the yoke is shorter than {{the diameter of the}} circle made by the crank pin. For example, the side rods of a locomotive may have scotch yokes to permit vertical motion of intermediate driving axles.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Scotch</b> <b>yoke</b> {{mechanism}} {{can be used}} {{to convert}} between rotational motion and linear reciprocating motion. The linear motion can take various forms depending on the shape of the slot, but the basic yoke with a constant rotation speed produces a linear motion that is simple harmonic in form.|$|E
5000|$|Cardano's {{work with}} hypocycloids {{led him to}} the [...] "Cardan gear mechanism," [...] in which a pair of gears with the smaller being {{one-half}} the size of the larger gear is used converting rotational motion to linear motion, with greater efficiency and precision than a <b>Scotch</b> <b>yoke,</b> for example.|$|E
50|$|The {{reciprocating}} action may be produced several ways. A crank or <b>Scotch</b> <b>yoke</b> type drive may be used, {{a swash plate}} type drive, a captive cam or eccentric, barrel cam, or other rotary to linear drive. Modern tools are built with variants {{of all of these}} mechanisms. Eccentric cam, crank and <b>scotch</b> <b>yoke</b> drives need balance weights to reduce vibration in the plane of the rotating element, and may still exhibit vibration that is objectionable to a user of a handheld saw and can lead to difficulty in controlling a cut. The swash plate drive has the advantage that there is little rotational out of balance, so the principal vibration is in line with the blade. This is generally controllable by keeping the foot of a handheld tool against the work.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} {{is to use a}} side rod that spans multiple axles with a <b>scotch</b> <b>yoke</b> used at each intermediate axle.

5000|$|A {{swashplate}} (also {{known as}} slant disk), invented by Anthony George Maldon Michell in 1917, is a device used {{in mechanical engineering}} to translate the motion of a rotating shaft into reciprocating motion, or vice versa. The working principles is similar to crankshaft, <b>Scotch</b> <b>yoke,</b> or wobble/nutator/Z-crank drives, in engine designs. It was firstly invented to replace crankshaft, {{and is one of}} the most popular concepts used in crankless engines.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Scotch</b> <b>yoke</b> (also {{known as}} slotted link mechanism) is a {{reciprocating}} motion mechanism, converting the linear motion of a slider into rotational motion, or vice versa. The piston or other reciprocating part is directly coupled to a sliding yoke with a slot that engages a pin on the rotating part. The {{location of the}} piston versus time is a sine wave of constant amplitude, and constant frequency given a constant rotational speed.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} in the late-1960s, GM directed their GM and Pontiac divisions {{to develop}} concept mini-cars called commuter car for urban drivers.

50|$|The Bourke {{engine is}} {{basically}} a two-stroke design, with one horizontally opposed piston assembly using two pistons that move {{in the same direction}} at the same time, so that their operations are 180 degrees out of phase. The pistons are connected to a <b>Scotch</b> <b>Yoke</b> mechanism in place of the more usual crankshaft mechanism, thus the piston acceleration is perfectly sinusoidal. This causes the pistons to spend more time at top dead center than conventional engines. The incoming charge is compressed in a chamber under the pistons, as in a conventional crankcase-charged two-stroke engine. The connecting-rod seal prevents the fuel from contaminating the bottom-end lubricating oil.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Scotch</b> <b>yoke</b> is {{not used}} in most {{internal}} combustion engines because of the rapid wear of the slot in the yoke caused by sliding friction and high contact pressures. This is mitigated by a sliding block between the crank and the slot in the piston rod. Also, increased heat loss during combustion due to extended dwell at top dead centre offsets any constant volume combustion improvements in real engines. In an engine application, less {{percent of the time}} is spent at bottom dead centre when compared to a conventional piston and crankshaft mechanism, which reduces blowdown time for two-stroke engines. Experiments have shown that extended dwell time does not work well with constant volume combustion Otto cycle engines. Gains might be more apparent in Otto cycle engines using a stratified direct injection (diesel or similar) cycle to reduce heat losses.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{study has}} shown that the {{application}} of a <b>Scotch</b> <b>Yoke</b> crank mechanism to a reciprocating internal combustion engine reduces the engine&# 039;s size and weight and generates sinusoidal piston motion that allows for complete balance of the engine.

The investigation starts by solving Reynolds equation for the <b>Scotch</b> <b>Yoke</b> linear bearing. The two-dimensional lubricant flow is numerically simulated and the calculated results are compared with experimental results from a linear bearing test rig. The performance characteristics and a design sensitivity analysis of the bearing are presented. Dynamic testing and analysis of an instrumented linear bearing on a test rig are used to validate the numerical simulation model. The oil supply and lubrication mechanism in the linear bearing are analysed and described in detail. This work aims to provide new insights into <b>Scotch</b> <b>Yoke</b> linear bearing design.

The water jet operates at Reynolds numbers, based on nozzle diameter, up to 50, 000. The jet is forced at high levels by a reciprocating <b>Scotch</b> <b>yoke</b> mechanism. By using an output signal from the <b>Scotch</b> <b>yoke</b> as a phase reference, {{it is possible to}} obtain either phase-locked hot film data or phase-locked photographs of the dye-marked coherent vortical structures in the shear layer. By assuming zero azimuthal velocity, continuity allows reconstruction of the vorticity field from the data obtained traversing the jet using a single straight hot film probe. Thus the phase-locked photographs and the phase-locked data sets can be compared. The close agreement of the reconstructed vorticity with the photographs gives credence to the assumption of zero azimuthal velocity, and shows that the dye injection method of flow visualization accurately represents the vortical structure of this flow...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a new mechanical design for an exoskeleton actuator {{to power the}} sagittal plane motion in the human hip. The device uses a DC motor to drive a <b>Scotch</b> <b>yoke</b> mechanism and series elasticity {{to take advantage of}} the cyclic nature of human gait and to reduce the maximum power and control requirements of the exoskeleton. The <b>Scotch</b> <b>yoke</b> actuator creates a position-dependent transmission that varies between 4 : 1 and infinity, with the peak transmission ratio aligned to the peak torque periods of the human gait cycle. Simulation results show that both the peak and average motor torque can be reduced using this mechanism, potentially allowing a less powerful motor to be used. Furthermore, the motor never needs to reverse direction even when the hip joint does. Preliminary testing shows the exoskeleton can provide an assistive torque and is capable of accurate position tracking at speeds covering the range of human walking. This thesis provides a detailed analysis of how the dynamic nature of human walking can be leveraged, how the hip actuator was designed, and shows how the exoskeleton performed during preliminary human trials...|$|E
