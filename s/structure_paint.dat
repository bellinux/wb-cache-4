5000|$|Lighthouse {{exterior}} paint was {{often used in}} colorful patterns {{to act as a}} day marker. Paint was also used to help protect the exterior structure of the lighthouse from wear. Evidence of paint degradation include crazing, cracking, peeling between coats, blistering, and wrinkling. Repair can be made through spot treatments or through a complete replacement of the paint.Original paint was made of lead and tended to withstand harsh conditions while still protecting the structure. The required use of National Historic Preservation approved paints has proved difficult as they do not work well with the lighthouse structure's original materials [...] Furthermore, salt in the air can lead to severe chalking of the paint surface and cause premature failure of latex paint products. Most repainting projects will have to begin with removal of the original base coat, followed by a thorough surface cleaning to remove impurities, then ended with a complete repainting of the <b>structure.</b> <b>Paint</b> normally only lasts between five and eight years, depending on the lighthouse and conditions.|$|E
