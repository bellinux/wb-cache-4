40|$|Abstract. Bending fatigue {{is one of}} {{the main}} failure modes of gears. The method of gear fatigue design was {{discussed}} in many papers. Most of them are based on GB/T 3480 - 83. But study shows that the method current widely used only fits for the single <b>side</b> <b>loaded</b> gear. For double <b>sides</b> <b>loaded</b> gear, only a mean stress modification coefficient is concerned compared to single <b>side</b> <b>loaded</b> gear. A new formula based on fatigue theory is given to modify the mean stress in consideration of the load character of doubled <b>sides</b> <b>loaded</b> gear. The method given in the paper is an addition to the traditional gear design method...|$|R

50|$|By {{increasing}} the contact {{area of the}} ball bearings on the shaft to approximately 45 degrees, the <b>side</b> <b>load</b> and direct load carrying capabilities are greatly increased. Each nut can be individually preloaded at the factory to decrease the available radial play to ensure rigidity. This process not only increases the contact area, increasing direct loading capabilities, but it also restricts any radial movement, {{increasing the}} overhung moment capabilities. This creates a sturdier structure that can handle a very strenuous working environment.|$|E

This also eliminates any problem with breaker follower or cam wear, and by eliminating a <b>side</b> <b>load</b> it extends distributor shaft bearing life. The remaining secondary (high voltage) circuit stayed essentially the same, using an ignition coil and a rotary distributor.|$|E

5000|$|On 20 May 2007, an Air Canada Jazz Bombardier CRJ-100 which {{originated}} in Moncton, New Brunswick, was substantially damaged when its landing gear collapsed after landing at Toronto-Pearson International Airport, ON (YYZ).

50|$|Friction is {{the main}} reason this action is effective. If a car is moving across a surface in any {{direction}} other than the direction it's pointed, it is skidding (or sliding), and a sideways load is being imposed against the tires. This causes a lot of friction, even if the tires are allowed to rotate freely. By turning the front wheels into the direction of the skid, the front wheels will become aligned with the direction of travel. The <b>side</b> <b>load</b> will no longer be imposed against the front tires, and they will then roll freely to match the speed of the vehicle. This reduces the friction between the front tires and the surface. But the rear tires will still be sliding sideways, and the greater friction that exists will cause the back end to trail directly behind the front end, similar to a badminton birdie in flight, thus the car straightens out. As the car straightens, the front wheels must be kept aligned with the direction of travel to keep the friction of the front tires at or below the friction of the rear tires, or a skid in the opposite direction will quickly develop. The key is to keep the front wheels aligned with the direction the vehicle is moving-not the direction it is pointed.|$|E

The <b>side</b> <b>load</b> physics captured include the afterburning wave, transition from free- shock to restricted-shock separation, and lip Lambda shock oscillation. With the adiabatic nozzle, free-shock separation reappears after the transition from free-shock separation to restricted-shock separation, and the subsequent flow pattern of the simultaneous free-shock and restricted-shock separations creates a very asymmetric Mach disk flow. With the cooled nozzle, the more symmetric restricted-shock separation persisted throughout the start-up transient after the transition, leading to an overall lower <b>side</b> <b>load</b> than that of the adiabatic nozzle.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this effort {{is to develop a}} computational methodology to capture the startup <b>side</b> <b>load</b> physics and to anchor the computed aerodynamic side loads with the available data from a regeneratively cooled, high-aspect-ratio nozzle, hot-fired at sea level. The computational methodology is based on an unstructured-grid, pressure-based, reacting flow computational fluid dynamics and heat transfer formulation, a transient 5 s inlet history based on an engine system simulation, and a wall temperature distribution to reflect the effect of regenerative cooling. To understand the effect of regenerative wall cooling, two transient computations were performed using the boundary conditions of adiabatic and cooled walls, respectively. The results show that three types of shock evolution are responsible for side loads: generation of combustion wave; transitions among free-shock separation, restricted-shock separation, and simultaneous free-shock and restricted shock separations; along with the pulsation of shocks across the lip, although the combustion wave is commonly eliminated with the sparklers during actual test. The test measured two <b>side</b> <b>load</b> events: a secondary and lower <b>side</b> <b>load,</b> followed by a primary and peak <b>side</b> <b>load.</b> Results from both wall boundary conditions captured the free-shock separation to restricted-shock separation transition with computed side loads matching the measured secondary <b>side</b> <b>load.</b> For the primary <b>side</b> <b>load,</b> the cooled wall transient produced restricted-shock pulsation across the nozzle lip with peak <b>side</b> <b>load</b> matching that of the test, while the adiabatic wall transient captured shock transitions and free-shock pulsation across the lip with computed peak <b>side</b> <b>load</b> 50 % lower than that of the measurement.

Further, the paper illuminates that in the limit where wind and aerodynamic loads are small, random mass flux variations exponentially amplify side-load-induced rotational stochasticity. In this practical limit, pitch/yaw dynamics are described by a randomly damped OU process; an exact solution of the associated Fokker–Planck equation can be obtained and used to compute, e. g. time-dependent pitch/yaw rate means and variances...|$|R
