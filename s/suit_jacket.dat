5|$|Some {{sources have}} claimed that the work is a {{derivative}} of preceding works. Playboy published a photo with similar bodypainting, with a necktie, <b>suit</b> <b>jacket</b> and similar pose, in its March 1968 issue, {{as part of a}} feature on bodypainting.|$|E
5|$|As other {{scenes of}} Carey in the latex mini {{and by the}} large red hone prop are interspersed, the club scene alters to a poker table, where Ealy reveals three of his card, '556', {{completing}} four of the seven digits of Carey phone number. The next scene finds Carey sitting on a large pink sofa in an empty room in the club, sporting only a white man's <b>suit</b> <b>jacket</b> and stilettos. As the song reaches the bridge, Carey is shown back in the club's main room dancing, as she leaves a number '4' on a nearby table for the man to find. As Carey once again {{is shown in the}} yellow latex dress, she walks down a small aisle, placing another card with the number '4' into Ealy's jacket pocket, before storming through the club by several followers. As the video ends, the number '555-6464' are shown lying on a small table, while Carey sits on the large pink sofa, and Ealy is seen on the other side gazing at her. The video concludes with Ealy slowly approaching Carey on the large sofa, as she winks and smiles to the camera.|$|E
25|$|On formal {{occasions}} a taovala, a woven mat, is worn {{over the}} tupenu. It is {{wrapped around the}} waist and secured with a kafa rope. The tupenu may be smartly tailored and have a matching <b>suit</b> <b>jacket.</b> If a man cannot afford to have a suit tailored to fit him, he will buy a used Western jacket, or wear a threadbare jacket inherited from an older relative.|$|E

25|$|Suit {{trousers}} {{are always}} {{made of the}} same material as the jacket. Even from the 1910s to 1920s, before the invention of sports jackets specifically to be worn with odd trousers, wearing a <b>suit</b> <b>jacket</b> with odd trousers {{was seen as an}} alternative to a full suit. However, with the modern advent of sports jackets, suit jackets are always worn with matching trousers, and the trousers have always been worn with the appropriate jacket.|$|E
25|$|Rather's {{energy and}} spirit helped him out-compete Roger Mudd for the anchor {{spot on the}} Evening News. Mudd was a more senior {{correspondent}} and a frequent substitute anchor for Walter Cronkite on Evening News. He also anchored Sunday evening broadcast, but it was Rather who traveled through Afghanistan when news led there. A few years into his service as anchor, Rather began wearing sweaters beneath his <b>suit</b> <b>jacket</b> to soften and warm his on-air perceptions to viewers.|$|E
25|$|Dressed in {{a version}} of the Sarong Kebaya {{designed}} by Pierre Balmain in 1968, the uniform of the Singapore Girl has remained largely unchanged. Stewards previously wore light-blue business jackets and grey trousers. Since June 2008, this has been redesigned by Christophe Galibert, artistic Director of Balmain Uniformes. The new steward's uniform now features a single-breasted navy blue <b>suit</b> (<b>jacket</b> and trousers), a sky blue shirt and different coloured striped ties. The tie colours differentiates the four ranks of cabin crew: inflight supervisor, chief steward(ess), leading steward(ess), and steward(ess).|$|E
5000|$|After {{completing}} his degree, Jewels moved to London and started developing his designs. His trademark designs included use of Swarovski crystals on <b>suit</b> <b>jackets,</b> which have drawn {{a lot of}} attention from onlookers.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Suit</b> <b>jackets</b> and blazers {{typically}} have {{one to four}} rows of buttons (each row containing two buttons), {{one or two of}} the rows functional. Each fastening method is identified using [...] "number-on-number" [...] terminology; the first number is the total number of front buttons, the second is the number of fastening buttons below the lapels (i.e. the second number also is the number of corresponding buttonholes). Six-on-two and six-on-one (as shown in the picture on the right) are the common button stances, but others exist. Stylistically, double-breasted <b>suit</b> <b>jackets</b> usually have peaked lapels, and fasten left lapel over right lapel as usual for men's jackets.|$|R

25|$|Moscone {{originally}} {{indicated a}} willingness to reconsider, but more liberal city leaders, including Harvey Milk, lobbied him against the idea, and Moscone ultimately decided not to appoint White. On November 27, 1978, three days after Moscone's 49th birthday, White went to San Francisco City Hall to meet with Moscone and make a final plea for appointment. When Moscone refused to reconsider his decision, White pulled a gun out of his <b>suit</b> <b>jacket</b> and shot and killed Moscone. White then went to Milk's office and shot Milk, killing him as well.|$|E
25|$|Previously unknown color footage filmed on the {{assassination}} day by George Jefferies {{was released on}} February 19, 2007 by the Sixth Floor Museum, Dallas, Texas. The film {{does not include the}} shooting, having been taken roughly 90seconds beforehand and a couple of blocks away. The only detail relevant to the investigation of {{the assassination}} is a clear view of President Kennedy's bunched <b>suit</b> <b>jacket,</b> just below the collar, which has led to different calculations about how low in the back President Kennedy was first shot (see discussion above).|$|E
25|$|Nightclubbing {{claimed the}} number 1 slot on NMEs Album of the Year list. Slant Magazine listed the album at No. 40 on {{its list of}} Best Albums of the 1980s. Nightclubbing is now widely {{considered}} Jones' best studio album. The album's cover art is a painting of Jones by Jean-Paul Goude. Jones {{is presented as a}} man wearing an Armani <b>suit</b> <b>jacket,</b> with a cigarette in her mouth and a flattop haircut. While promoting the album, Jones slapped chat-show host Russell Harty live on air after he had turned to interview other guests, making Jones feel she was being ignored.|$|E

25|$|After her marriage, Dolores {{adopted the}} severe {{masculine}} style of dress and hair popular at that time, appearing in Eve, The Lady's Pictorial in 1925 in a <b>suit</b> <b>jacket</b> and tie. The mannish appearance, uncharacteristic (in photographs) half-smile, and the knowing {{look in the}} picture has caused later commentators to wonder whether Dolores was signalling {{that she was a}} lesbian, but {{there is no evidence to}} suggest that she was and her appearance at this time may simply have been a fashion statement. The photograph appeared, slightly changed, on the cover of Fashioning Sapphism: The Origins of a Modern English Lesbian Culture by Laura Doan in 2013.|$|E
25|$|Dwight often {{speaks in}} a halting, intense manner, even in casual conversations. At the office, his most {{recurring}} formal wear is a mustard-colored, short-sleeved collar shirt, with a dark necktie and, usually, a brown <b>suit</b> <b>jacket.</b> He often uses one-upmanship to better himself over his peers, such as boasting about how he trains specific parts of his body. Dwight will sometimes engage in jokes and games in attempts to appease Michael, but often fails to do so, because of Michael's perception of himself as the jokester of the workplace. After Dwight temporarily leaves Dunder Mifflin, it is shown that he had long been watering the office plant and arranging the toys on Michael's desk {{in a manner that}} made Michael happy, unbeknownst to Michael.|$|E
25|$|The 83 × 67cm (33 × 26 in) {{painting}} shows a half-length {{portrait of}} the painter Édouard Manet. In this self-portrait as painter he depicted himself as a stylish Boulevardier {{in front of a}} dark background. The depicted wears a black top hat and a brown jacket, under which is a white shirt, of which only the collar can be seen. The neckline of the <b>suit</b> <b>jacket</b> covers a black silk tie which is affixed by a tie pin. In the right, only vaguely depicted hand he holds a long wooden brush with red paint on the tip; the left hand holds a painting palette with about three more brushes. No further accessories are shown. The figure is lit from the left by which the shadows beneath the left arm and the right half of the face are created. His pose is slightly turned to the right, so that the right half of the body is darker than the forward, left half. The painter's gaze is directed forwards at the viewer.|$|E

50|$|Pinstripes {{have been}} found on suits since the early 19th century. They were used by banks in London to {{identify}} their employees. Pinstripes were originally worn only on suit pants but upon being adopted in America during the 20th century they were also used on <b>suit</b> <b>jackets.</b>|$|R
50|$|When Housos won the The Logie Award for Most Outstanding Light Entertainment Program in 2014, Taumata {{was with}} the show's {{director}} Paul Fenech to accept the award in Melbourne. As a nod to bogandom, they both wore jeans, <b>suit</b> <b>jackets</b> covered in tattoo designs, and thongs.|$|R
25|$|The {{length of}} the skirt of the frock coat varied during the Victorian era and Edwardian era {{according}} to fashion. The most conservative length became established as being to the knees but fashion conscious men would follow the latest trends to wear them either longer or shorter. Similarly, {{the height of the}} waist– the point of maximal waist suppression– changed according to fashion. During its heyday, the frock coat was cut following the 19th century ideal of flattering the natural elegance of the naked figure, based on the ideals of Neoclassicism that admired the depiction of the idealised nude in Classical Greco-Roman sculpture. The elegance of the form of the frock coat derived from its hourglass shape with a closely cut waist which at times around the 1830s-40's was reinforced further with padding to round out the chest. A cut with an ideal hourglass silhouette was achievable because coats during this era were all made bespoke, individually cut to the exact measurements of the customer. The 19th century aesthetics of tailoring contrasted markedly to the modern style of cutting suits which involves a greater degree of drape (fullness), as established by the great early 20th century Savile Row tailor Frederick Scholte. Caution needs to be exercised by modern tailors trained to create the drape cut style of modern lounge suits to minimise drape– particularly around the waist– when cutting a historically accurate frock coat. Sometimes, modern lounge suit coats with an unusually long skirt are referred to by ready-to-wear makers as a 'frock coat' but these lack the waist seam, resulting in the fuller drape more typical of a modern overcoat or a lounge <b>suit</b> <b>jacket.</b> The silhouette of the historically accurate frock coat has the waist seam precisely tailored to permit the classical and elongating hourglass figure with the strong waist suppression.|$|E
500|$|In August, New York {{magazine}} {{published an}} alternative witness sketch, reportedly {{based on a}} description by Flight 305 eyewitness Robert Gregory, depicting horn-rimmed sunglasses, a [...] "russet"-colored <b>suit</b> <b>jacket</b> with wide lapels, and marcelled hair. The article notes that L.D. Cooper had wavy hair that looked marcelled (as did Duane Weber).|$|E
500|$|Before {{the start}} of Parks and Recreation, Ron has two ex-wives, {{both of whom are}} named Tammy, which is also the name of Ron's mother. Ron despises and fears both of his ex-wives, and they are among the few {{individuals}} in the world who can break Ron's usually unwavering stoicism. Nevertheless, Ron shares an extremely passionate sexual connection with his second ex-wife; he compared having sex with her to [...] "doing peyote and sneezing, slowly, for six hours," [...] and added, [...] "That woman really knows her way around a penis." [...] Ron is so susceptible to Tammy 2's sexual temptations that he made a video-tape warning himself about her to play in case he ever got back together with her. Ron plays the saxophone, and secretly performs at out-of-town jazz clubs under the name Duke Silver, which he keeps secret from his colleagues in Pawnee. He wears a trilby hat and <b>suit</b> <b>jacket</b> while playing, fronts a band called the Duke Silver Trio, and has released such albums as Memories of Now, Smooth as Silver, and Hi Ho, Duke. His music is especially popular with older women (among them being April's mother), who find Duke Silver extremely attractive.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to these restrictions, Marcus recommended to the WPB that coats, <b>suits,</b> <b>jackets</b> and dresses be sold separately [...] "to make them go further." [...] The changes were expected to create a total savings of 100000000 yd of fabric {{to be used in}} the war effort.|$|R

5000|$|The {{show was}} now called The New Beat the Clock (although the logo still read simply [...] "Beat the Clock"), and the set was {{refreshed}} {{with a new}} color scheme and a redesigned Clock.

500|$|The video opens, {{looking down}} on Martin who is singing, as he lies on his back on a {{mattress}}. As the camera shot pulls back, the mattress is revealed to be outside. A cyclist cycles past in reverse and Martin leaps up from the mattress. He walks in reverse through a city, out into the suburbs and eventually crossing a railway line [...] and into woods, picking up his <b>suit</b> <b>jacket</b> as he goes. Upon arriving at his car, a black BMW, he gets in and briefly passes out. A woman, at first shown lying unresponsive {{on the ground in}} front of the car, is shown flying back in through the shattered windscreen. The car rolls back up a hill in the woods and through a broken fence, which joins back together as the car passes through it. As the video closes, the couple is shown driving back up the road. It is revealed that Martin's passenger had removed her seat belt, in order to put her jacket on, just before the car accident, causing her death. Irish actress Elaine Cassidy portrays the female passenger.|$|E
2500|$|Pomposity. Hacker {{is often}} seen going off into sentimental, overly pretentious speeches either to himself or to Bernard and Sir Humphrey, holding his lapel on his <b>suit</b> <b>jacket</b> in a very royal manner. He also mimicked Napoleon by {{slipping}} {{his hand in the}} front of his <b>suit</b> <b>jacket</b> upon hearing he was selected by the party to become party leader and hence Prime Minister. However, it appears that Hacker's political idol is Winston Churchill: he occasionally speaks in the statesman's gruff style, on several occasions imitating or paraphrasing Churchill's [...] "We shall fight on the beaches" [...] speech, and is seen reading biographies of him.|$|E
2500|$|The dating of the {{painting}} goes back to Manet's friend Théodore Duret, who asked Léon Leenhof, the son of Manet's wife, about it after the painter's death. Moreover, Manet had used the same <b>suit</b> <b>jacket</b> that he wore in Self-Portrait with Palette in {{the painting}} At [...] "Père Lathuille" [...] (also from 1879), for the depiction of {{the son of the}} restaurant's owner.|$|E
50|$|The {{documentary}} {{shows this}} unique time period through numerous vacationer's anecdotes. For example, one old man laughs at his young self, recalling {{the time he}} and his teenage friends once stirred up trouble by showing up to a formal dining hall wearing dress shirts, ties, and <b>suit</b> <b>jackets</b> — but no pants.|$|R
50|$|Plain cardigans {{are often}} worn over shirts and inside <b>suit</b> <b>jackets</b> as a less formal {{version of the}} {{waistcoat}} or vest that restrains the necktie when the jacket has been removed. Its versatility means it can be worn in casual or formal settings and in any season, but it is most popular during cool weather.|$|R
25|$|Lapels are {{the folded}} flaps of cloth {{on the front}} of a jacket or coat, and are most {{commonly}} found on formal clothing and <b>suit</b> <b>jackets.</b> Usually they are formed by folding over the front edges of the jacket or coat and sewing them to the collar, an extra piece of fabric {{around the back of the}} neck.|$|R
