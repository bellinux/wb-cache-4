5000|$|In {{this book}} Merchant {{describes}} three forms of control: control of <b>specific</b> <b>actions,</b> control of results {{and control of}} personnel. When knowledge of which <b>specific</b> <b>actions</b> are desirable is excellent, {{it is always a}} good thing to control <b>specific</b> <b>actions.</b> When the ability to measure results on important performance dimensions is high, it is always a good thing to control results. When {{it is difficult to know}} which <b>specific</b> <b>actions</b> are desirable and when it is difficult as well to measure the results, the optimal control is the personnel control.|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were: (1) to {{determine}} the macro- and microvascular actions of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) in the rat, and (2) {{to determine whether the}} vascular <b>actions</b> of <b>N</b> 2 O involved specific interaction with alpha-adrenergic receptors or opioid receptors. Systolic blood pressure, heart rat, total tail blood flow, blood cell velocity in subepidermal capillaries of the tail, and percentage of capillaries exhibiting flow were monitored in conscious rats during the administration of N 2 O before and after administration of clonidine (an alpha 2 -adrenergic agonist), prazosin (an alpha 1 -adrenergic antagonist) or naloxone (an opioid antagonist). Total tail blood flow increased significantly in a dose-dependent manner with N 2 O at 20 % and 40 % with oxygen. This <b>action</b> of <b>N</b> 2 O was not blocked by clonidine, prazosin, or naloxone. Capillary flow velocity increased during 20 % and 40 % N 2 O compared to 100 % O 2, but the changes were not statistically significant nor did they correlate with the changes in tail blood flow. These data suggest that the peripheral vascular <b>action</b> of <b>N</b> 2 O does not involve <b>specific</b> <b>actions</b> at alpha-adrenergic receptors or opioid receptors and {{may be the result of}} direct actions on the peripheral vasculature...|$|R
