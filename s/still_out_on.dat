25|$|Undeterred by {{his first}} failure, Drummond {{launched}} a second attack, using the same methods and formation as in the first. Although some American units wavered, they were rallied by Ripley and stood their ground. While the combat was taking place, Winfield Scott led his depleted brigade (which had been reorganized into a single ad-hoc battalion under Major Henry Leavenworth) in an unauthorized attack against Drummond's centre. Scott's brigade was engaged both by the British and by units of Ripley's brigade, who {{were not aware of}} the identity of the troops at which they were shooting. Drummond's line was driven back but Scott's men broke in disorder and retreated, before rallying on the American left. Scott rode off to join Jesup's regiment, <b>still</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the right flank, but was severely wounded shortly afterwards.|$|E

Much of the masonry in North Block F {{also appears to be}} McElmo style. A smaller square building known as the Talus Unit lies just west of Chetro Ketl; it contains some McElmo style features. R. Gwinn Vivian (son of Gordon Vivian) notes, [...] "The jury is <b>still</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> this question, a problem that poses intriguing possibilities for future work." ...|$|E

500|$|On 14September, {{on their}} way back to Framheim, they left most of their {{equipment}} at the 80°S depot, to lighten the sledges. Next day, in freezing temperatures with a strong headwind, several dogs froze to death while others, too weak to continue, were placed upon the sledges. On 16September, [...] from Framheim, Amundsen ordered his men to push for home as quickly as possible. Not having a sledge of his own, he leapt onto Wisting's, and with Helmer Hanssen and his team raced away, leaving the rest behind. The three arrived back at Framheim after nine hours, followed by Stubberud and Bjaaland two hours later and Hassel shortly after. [...] Johansen and Prestrud were <b>still</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the ice, without food or fuel; Prestrud's dogs had failed, and his heels were badly frostbitten. They reached Framheim after midnight, more than seventeen hours after they had turned for home.|$|E
500|$|In June 2006, Hasan Zahirović-Laca sailed from Boka Kotorska to Italy to {{participate}} in the international naval exercise [...] "Adrion Livex 06". The boat left port under the flag of the Navy of Serbia and Montenegro, but because Montenegro declared its independence on 6 June while the boat was <b>still</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> exercise, Hasan Zahirović-Laca became the first ship outside of Montenegrin waters to display the flag of the new country. The boat was decommissioned later that year, along with the first boat of the class, Rade Končar. The latter was sold to Kenya in 2014 for an undisclosed price. The Kenyan Navy plans on stripping the boat of its guns and fire-control systems which would then be overhauled and installed on the offshore patrol vessel KNS Jasiri. Rade Končar itself is then expected to be rebuilt and used by the Navy as a patrol boat. The fate of Hasan Zahirović-Laca remains unknown.|$|E
500|$|Boycott {{was again}} refused the {{captaincy}} {{for the next}} Test series against India over the winter of 1981–82. Angered by this decision, he stated that [...] "even the Yorkshire Ripper got a fair trial in the dock but I've not been given a single chance." [...] He later battled Keith Fletcher over his slow scoring rate, playing Fletcher's comments to him during a press conference using a tape recorder. The series against India was to be his last. In his final ODI match during England's tour he scored 6 from 12 deliveries. During the following Test series he passed Sobers' career run record, hitting 60 in the first Test, 36 and 50 in the second to take him 81 runs short, and in the third Test he overtook the record with a flick off his pads for four. He became the leading Test run-scorer. In his last Test match, the fourth of the tour, taking place in January 1982, he scored 18 and six. During the tour, Boycott claimed he was too ill to field in a Test Match, but it was later discovered that he was playing golf while his teammates were <b>still</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the field.|$|E

500|$|This episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews. Christine Orlando of TV Fanatic {{said that the}} plot of the episode had a [...] "nice story arc when the cause of death ranged from disease, to suicide, and finally murder". She added that Nikki's family was a [...] "nightmare". She was surprised that Bill was not involved in killing Nikki, saying that he [...] "came across as a bit of a jerk for most of the episode", adding that Nikki had a [...] "short, sad life". Orlando praised the detail of Nikki's neck, noticing the bruising to show she was strangled. She said, [...] "I generally hate gore yet I found myself fascinated by the autopsy of the girl's neck. Maybe it was the detail of the muscle and the lack of blood but I've never seen such a procedure portrayed with that level of specificity". Orlando carried on saying, [...] "Is there some rule that we can't have both detectives every week? Detective Baker's definitely growing on me but I missed Bud. He and Megan had some great chemistry and I was hoping for more of {{that by the end of}} the season". Orlando understood Megan's reaction to the fact that Kate was dating Todd, calling it [...] "justified", saying it was an [...] "odd position to be in", but summarized; [...] "she'll just have to get over it". Orlando was worried whether Todd deserved Kate saying that; [...] "the jury is <b>still</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> Todd". She praised how this storyline turned out to be a [...] "great bonding moment" [...] between Megan and Lacey, saying she [...] "liked" [...] that Megan was honest with Lacey adding, [...] "I like it when adults actually act like adults".|$|E
2500|$|Sean Egan from BBC Music {{said that}} [...] "Many {{of the songs}} are amongst the strongest chart hits of the new millennium, {{especially}} Williams’ collaborations with Guy Chambers". Egan said that [...] "The sequencing is bizarre but has its own kind of logic, working backwards chronologically" [...] and as [...] "the familiar tunes go by, one is {{struck by the fact}} that Williams is both underrated [...] and overrated." [...] He also stated that had Williams [...] "not been sacked by Take That, he would never have been motivated to prove himself with edgy, knowing music light years beyond the boyband." [...] Egan concluded his review by saying that [...] "If this compilation is closing a chapter, the jury is <b>still</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> whether the next one is going to be a gripper." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with All About Soap Richie revealed how Alfie reacts. He commented: [...] "It's {{the last thing he}} expected to hear. He didn't see it coming. He's upset and angry, especially when Kat tries to explain how he made her feel when he accused her of sleeping with someone else when she got pregnant again. He obviously didn't mean the things he said then – he just said them {{in the heat of the}} moment, but those words have stuck with Kat." [...] Asked whether Alfie appreciates Kat's honesty, he replied: [...] "Not at all – he'd rather not know. Deep down, Alfie knows that Kat has done things in the past that maybe she shouldn't have, but he didn't know all the details. Now he knows Kat has been unfaithful, he has got to confront the fact. The jury is <b>still</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> that one," [...] he explained. [...] "I don't know, if I'm honest. They always seem to take two steps forward and then one step back... They do tend to come through these things, so who knows?" ...|$|E

I should have everything to create, as it might be, and the pleasure of seeing everything rising up under my own hand.
