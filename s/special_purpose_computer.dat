The parallel algorithm was implemented on a 512 processor AP 1000 and evaluated using NETtalk and other applications. To obtain high speedup, we have suggested an approach to combine the multiple parallel degrees (training set parallelism, node parallelism and pipelining of the training patterns) of the algorithm. For {{a large number of}} processors, we obtained a performance of 81 million weight updates per second using 512 processors, when running the NETtalk network. Our results show that to obtain the best performance on a large number of processors, a combination of multiple degrees of parallelism in the backpropagation algorithm ought to be considered.
