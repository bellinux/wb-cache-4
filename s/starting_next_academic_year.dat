40|$|This paper {{argues in}} favour of a language-oriented {{approach}} to teach the principles of concurrency to graduate students. Over the past years, the popularity of programming languages that promote a functional programming style has steadily grown. We want to promote {{the use of such}} languages as the appropriate basic tools to deal with the “multicore revolution”. We describe some of these programming languages and highlight two of them: Erlang and Clojure. We use these languages in a new graduate-level course that we will teach <b>starting</b> <b>next</b> <b>academic</b> <b>year.</b> Our goal is not to convince the reader that Erlang and Clojure are the best possible choices among this pool of candidate languages. Rather, our goal is to promote a functional programming style to tackle concurrency issues, and to teach this style in a programming language that makes it easy, straightforward and convenient to use that style. We do not want to get bogged down in a discussion on the usefulness or importance of learning new programming languages. For a good summary of the diverse advantages of studying new programming languages, we refer to a recent white paper by the ACM SIGPLAN education board [6]. 1. BACKGROUND <b>Starting</b> <b>next</b> <b>academic</b> <b>year,</b> the first author will teach a new graduate-level course on concurrency at the Flemish Free University of Brussels in Belgium. As in many other institutions worldwide, our computer science curriculum is slowly beginning to adapt to the reality that virtually every new computer is a parallel machine. To date, our computer science curriculum featured just one course that touches upon concurrent programming. However, this course focuses on the traditional topics of usin...|$|E

40|$|Non-traditional {{engineering}} students have problems to attend all scheduled laboratory sessions which are organized on campus. This prevents these non-traditional students (for example working students) from enrolling. In this paper, {{we describe the}} results of a project which has run during two years. We developed a new teaching method that facilitates flexible study programs in engineering: ‘laboratory immersion’. We developed the methodology, implemented it in three pilots and measured the results using electronic surveys, focus group discussions and study time measurements. The results of this study reveal that students and lecturers feel positive about this new method. By consequence this teaching method will be applied on a large scale <b>starting</b> from <b>next</b> <b>academic</b> <b>year.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|Until September 2015, LRGS {{used the}} more {{traditional}} '1st year, 2nd year, 3rd year...' system for naming years, rather than the modern 'Year 7, 8, 9...' system - a tradition {{that had been in}} place since the 1973/74 <b>academic</b> <b>year.</b> The tradition came under threat in May 2015, when some of the school's teachers {{made it clear that they}} would rather use the modern system, to avoid confusion when communicating with other schools and organisations using that system. An online petition was set up, garnering over a thousand signatures from students, teachers and Old Lancastrians. The change was also opposed by the senior prefect team. However, at the <b>start</b> of the <b>next</b> <b>academic</b> <b>year</b> (2015/16), the school officially changed to the modern system, despite the considerable opposition.|$|R

50|$|The Cherokee Female Seminary, (not to be {{confused}} with the first Cherokee Female Seminary), serves as the centerpiece of Northeastern State University, located in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, United States. The building was constructed to replace the original Cherokee Female Seminary that burnt to the ground Easter Sunday 1887. The Cherokee Council chose to rebuild the school on a 40 acre site north of Tahlequah, near Hendricks Spring. Two years later, on May 7, 1889, the dedication ceremonies were held in honor of the new building. The Female Seminary was owned and operated by the Cherokee Nation until March 6, 1909 when the State Legislature of Oklahoma passed an act providing for the creation and location of Northeastern State Normal School at Tahlequah, Oklahoma, and for the purchase form the Cherokee Tribal Government of the building, land, and equipment of the Cherokee Female Seminary. At the <b>start</b> of the <b>next</b> <b>academic</b> <b>year,</b> on September 14, the first classes were held at the newly created Northeastern State Normal School, now Northeastern State University.|$|R
40|$|This list is {{designed}} to help you match your interests with a potential supervisor. You do not need to register your project formally until Week 3 of semester 1 2013 / 14, but it is helpful to many students to have this list now, to enable them to talk to potential supervisors and agree on a project choice before the <b>start</b> of the <b>next</b> <b>academic</b> <b>year.</b> It is up to you to find a supervisor. Contact details of each supervisor are given to allow you to email or arrange meetings. Students may work together in pairs on any project, and are encouraged to do so, but only in exceptional circumstances should this number be exceeded. In recent years, almost 40 % of projects have been based on the student's own idea rather than a staff member. However, as with literature reviews, make sure you are choosing a topic which a staff member is willing to supervise. If the supervisor is outwith the department, e. g. a clinical or educational psychologist, then you must have a member of staff agreeing to act as internal supervisor when you register the project at the beginning of semester 1...|$|R
40|$|This project {{sought to}} explore the views of sixth-form history {{students}} concerning the efficacy of their departmentâs formative assessment policy, and builds on my part 2 research into student views of self and peer marking. The project first consisted of a literature review {{in order to provide}} the grounding needed to adapt the departmentâs current assessment policy. This policy was then implemented by all staff in the department {{at the start of the}} <b>academic</b> <b>year.</b> Questionnaires and group interviews were carried out to explore how the students responded to this policy, with the intention that their responses would then be mediated by staff to produce an adapted policy for the <b>start</b> of the <b>next</b> <b>academic</b> <b>year.</b> One of the key findings of this project was that despite increased student confidence in self assessment, students still reported considerable reliance on the teacher. Among other conclusions drawn, it will ultimately be suggested that to further shift the balance of power in assessment away from the teacher, students need greater ownership not only over the assessment of their work, but also the assessment policy itself. Therefore, although the original aim of the project was for the staff to redraft the departmentâs assessment policy based on student views, instead the outcome developed into a decision to give students a role in regularly revising the policy, encouraging a more organic and embedded approach. Although this approach to policy-making in general is far from novel, it is rarely applied specifically to formative assessment, where educationalists tend to empower students within the narrow boundaries of teacher-determined assessment activities. It is still often the teacher ultimately who âownsâ and âprovidesâ formative assessment activities, with students required only to play their ascribed role. Therefore, this approach contrasts considerably with some of the contemporary literature that sees formative assessment as a concern of teacher pedagogy rather than student ownership. </p...|$|R
