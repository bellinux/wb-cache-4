50|$|A large float {{will go up}} {{and down}} with the passing waves. This can be disconcerting and {{inconvenient}} for the divers if they need to hold onto it in a current, as they will to some extent {{go up and down}} with the line. This effect is minimised if a small diameter spar buoy is used as the primary buoy to tension the line, as it will tend to react less to the waves, with a large volume <b>safety</b> <b>buoy</b> on a short tether, which will prevent the spar buoy from being dragged down if the tension gets too much.|$|E
25|$|London River Services is not {{responsible}} for maintaining the river itself; the Port of London Authority takes care of river traffic control, security, navigational <b>safety</b> (including <b>buoys,</b> beacons, bridge lights and channel surveys), and the RNLI operates Thames lifeboat services.|$|R
50|$|The PLA {{today has}} a number of {{statutory}} duties, including river traffic control, security, navigational <b>safety</b> (including <b>buoys,</b> beacons, bridge lights and channel surveys), conservation (including dredging and maintaining certain river banks), encouraging both commercial and leisure uses of the river, and protecting its environment. The PLA is responsible for the operation of Richmond Lock, but it is not responsible for the Thames Barrier which is managed by the Environment Agency in its flood management role.|$|R
50|$|Cardiff Harbour Authority {{today has}} a number of {{statutory}} duties, including traffic control, security, navigational <b>safety</b> (including <b>buoys,</b> beacons, bridge lights and channel surveys), conservation (including dredging, maintaining river banks and the wetland wildlife reserve), encouraging both commercial and leisure uses of the bay, and protecting its environment. The CHA is responsible for the operation of the three sea locks, the five sluices that maintain the water level in the bay and the fish pass that allows migratory Salmon and Sea Trout to return to the rivers to spawn.|$|R
50|$|Assigned to Division 2 of Mine Squadron 2 of the Atlantic Fleet, Swan {{completed}} {{final acceptance}} trials {{in the spring}} of 1920 and began routine operations out of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in late June. These operations included buoy work and wreck salvage, and the latter duty is what brought the minesweeper into Cape Cod Bay in November of that year. On 28 November, during an attempt to refloat a wrecked oil barge, heavy seas came up quickly and cast Swan on the beach in Cape Cod Bay. The sudden disaster stranded the minesweeper on the beach and mountainous seas threatened to wreck the stricken ship. Rapid response by the Gurnet Beach Coast Guard crew saved the day, however, and the Coast Guards' heroic efforts brought all fifty-six sailors to <b>safety</b> through breeches <b>buoy</b> and surfboat.|$|R
