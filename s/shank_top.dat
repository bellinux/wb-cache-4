40|$|Economic, environmental, {{and energy}} {{independence}} issues {{are contributing to}} rising fossil fuel prices, petroleum supply concerns, and a growing interest in biomass feedstocks as renewable energy sources. Potential feedstocks include perennial grasses, timber, and annual grain crops with our focus being on corn (Zea mays L.) stover. A plot-scale study evaluating stover removal was initiated in 2008 on a South Carolina Coastal Plain Coxville/Rains–Goldsboro– Lynchburg soil association site. In addition to grain and stover yields, carbon balance, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and soil quality impact reported elsewhere in this issue, variation in gross energy distribution within various plant fractions — whole plant, below ear shank (bottom), above ear <b>shank</b> (<b>top),</b> cob, as well as leaves and stems of the bottomand top portions (n(part, year) = 20) was measured with an isoperibol calorimeter. Stalks from above the ear shank were the most energy dense, averaging 18. 8 MJ/kg db, and when combined with other plant parts from above the ear shank, the entire top half was more energy dense than the bottom half — 18. 4 versus 18. 2 MJ/kg db. Gross energy content of the whole plant, including the cob, averaged 18. 28 ± 0. 76 MJ/kg db. Over the 4 years, partial to total removal (i. e., 25 %to 100 %) of above ground plant biomass could supply between 30 and 168 GJ/ha depending upon annual rainfall. At 168 GJ/ha, the quantity of corn stover biomass (whole plant) available in a 3, 254 -km 2 area (32 km radius) around the study site could potentially support a 500 -MW power plant...|$|E
5000|$|Sabec {{signed the}} duo, re-christened Swirl 360, to Mercury. The {{resulting}} debut, Ask Anybody, {{was released in}} mid-1998, and the track [...] "Hey, Now Now," [...] co-written with John <b>Shanks,</b> became a <b>top</b> 5 hit on radio airwaves worldwide. Rolling Stone gave the album 3.5 stars and other entertainment magazines reviewed the band's efforts favorably. The band's second single [...] "Candy In The Sun" [...] released in 1999, was a summer chart topper as well.|$|R
50|$|Garson brought {{together}} {{a mixture of}} musicians, {{most of whom were}} not credited on the album sleeve. Musician and electronic instrument collector Paul Beaver, who had done music effects for films, was chosen to perform on the Moog synthesizer on the album since {{he was one of the}} few people on the West Coast who knew how to set up and use the synthesizer at the time. Beaver and Moog went to the California Audio Engineering Society convention in 1967 to showcase the Moog Synthesizer for the first time on the West Coast. Emil Richards, who had worked with such musicians as Frank Zappa, Marvin Gaye and Henry Mancini, was chosen to provide an assortment of percussive instrumental surprises throughout the album. Bassist Carol Kaye and drummer Hal Blaine, both top on-demand session musicians, were The Zodiac's rhythm section. Bud <b>Shank,</b> a <b>top</b> flute performer, and keyboardist Mike Melvoin were also used. Jacques Wilson wrote the album's narration, and folk singer Cyrus Faryar was chosen (suggested by Hassilev) to narrate over the album's exotic instrumentation.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{frequent}} producer-asked questions to those persons striving to secure sustainable corn (Zea mays L.) stover feedstock supplies for Iowa’s new bioenergy conversion or other bio-product facilities is “what quantity of nutrients will be removed if I harvest my stover?” Our objective is to summarize six years of field research from central Iowa, U. S. A. where more than 600, 1. 5 m 2 samples were collected by hand and divided into four plant fractions: vegetative material from the ear <b>shank</b> upward (<b>top),</b> vegetative material from approximately 10 cm above the soil surface to just below the ear (bottom), cobs, and grain. Another 400 stover samples, representing the vegetative material collected directly from a single-pass combine harvesting system or from stover bales were also collected and analyzed. All samples were dried, ground, and analyzed to determine C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Al, B, Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn concentrations. Mean concentration and dry matter estimates for each sample were used to calculate nutrient removal and estimate fertilizer replacement costs which averaged $ 25. 06, $ 20. 04, $ 16. 62, $ 19. 40, and $ 27. 41 Mg− 1 for top, bottom, cob, stover, and grain fractions, respectively. We then used the plant fraction estimates to compare various stover harvest scenarios and provide {{an answer to the}} producer question posed above...|$|R
