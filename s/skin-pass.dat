50|$|Cold-rolled {{sheets and}} strips come in various conditions: full-hard, half-hard, quarter-hard, and skin-rolled. Full-hard rolling reduces the {{thickness}} by 50%, {{while the others}} involve less of a reduction. Skin-rolling, {{also known as a}} <b>skin-pass,</b> involves the least amount of reduction: 0.5-1%. It is used to produce a smooth surface, a uniform thickness, and reduce the yield point phenomenon (by preventing Lüders bands from forming in later processing). It locks dislocations at the surface and thereby reduces the possibility of formation of Lüders bands. To avoid the formation of Lüders bands it is necessary to create substantial density of unpinned dislocations in ferrite matrix. It is also used to break up the spangles in galvanized steel. Skin-rolled stock is usually used in subsequent cold-working processes where good ductility is required.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{motivated}} {{by a desire to}} understand more about the fatigue properties of HRLC and HSLA steels and the manufacturing and metallurgical property variables which influence fatigue response. This knowledge was needed by the steel industry to improve the resistance of hot rolled strip steels to fatigue failure, and by the motor vehicle manufacturing industry to improve methods of design against fatigue failure in components made from these steels. A review of the literature identified a fatigue design methodology, the local strain approach to fatigue design, which was most suited to accurate fatigue life prediction. A vital input to this design method was strain controlled fatigue test data. To provide these data, the fatigue properties of a group of ten steels, representative of the commercially available range of H R L C and HSLA strip steels available in Australia have been characterised in this study. The steel grades chosen were, two low strength steels, XA 1010 and C 1012 W, four Australian HSLA Xtraform steels, and four Japanese steels. Characterisation of fatigue properties was performed using the Ramberg-Osgood cyclic stress-strain relationship, and the Coffin-Manson cyclic strain-life relationship. The fit of these relationships was found to be quite good. However, an improved fit was obtained by using a modification to the traditional relationships proposed by Weng. These relationships also had the advantage of recognising the fatigue limit phenomenon. By characterising of the fatigue properties of the steels, the goal of providing industry with the needed input data for fatigue design, was satisfied. While, other researchers established that a steel grade could be characterised by sampling from a single position in a coil, and from a single heat, the effects of strip thickness, skin passing, and anisotropy of properties on fatigue response were unclear and have consequently been examined in the present study. Thus, integral with the process of characterising the fatigue properties of the steels, was the testing of several variants of each steel, which were chosen to represent various treatments levels of these manufacturing variables. In this way, the effects of these variables on fatigue properties were examined. The test results were arranged into a series of balanced factorial experimental designs to facilitate linear regression statistical analysis. The Ramberg-Osgood relationship was used as the basis of the cyclic stress-strain analysis, and an alternative description to the Coffin-Manson formulation was developed for the cyclic strain-life relationship. A notional (Neuber) stress-life analysis, which compared steels under similar service conditions was also employed. The effect of strip thickness was examined in 3. 2 and 5. 0 mm thickness C 1012 W and XA 1010 steels. The lack of a significant thickness effect in either the cyclic stress-strain or strain-life behaviour in these steels suggested that thickness does not have a large effect on the properties of hot rolled strip steels. Test piece orientation had a significant effect on cyclic stress-strain behaviour. In each case, the cyclic strength of the transverse test pieces w a s higher than that of the longitudinal test pieces. There was no significant effect of orientation on cyclic strain-life behaviour, however, when compared on the basis of notional stress amplitude, the transverse test pieces also had longer lives. While no significant effect of skin passing was observed on cyclic stress-strain behaviour in the Xtraform steels, a significant effect was observed in cyclic strain-life behaviour. The effect was to slightly reduce fatigue lives in the two lower strength grades. However, in the high strength grades, while fatigue lives were reduced by skinpassing at higher stress/strain amplitudes, at low stress/strain amplitudes fatigue life was improved. Consequently, the conjecture that <b>skin-passing</b> is beneficial to fatigue life has been demonstrated only for Xtraform 400, although implied for Xtraform 500. Equivalent Xtraform and Japanese steels were compared on the basis of notional stress-life response, however, no steel w a s clearly superior to its counterpart. Thus this part of the study achieved the goal of developing and applying methods of statistical analysis which could discriminate between the fatigue responses of. similar steels, and provide a systematic analysis of the influence of manufacturing variables on fatigue response. Since uncertainty also existed about the influence of hardness, strength, composition, and microstructure on fatigue response, these effects were examined. The goal achieved {{in this part of the}} study was to develop methods to predict difficult to obtain fatigue properties from readily available measurements such as the non-fatigue variables listed above. These relationships would be of value both in alloy design and in design against fatigue. Relationships with the parameters which define both the Ramberg-Osgood, and W e ng forms of the cyclic stress-strain relationship, including a number of reputedly successful relationships, were examined. None of these potential relationships with the non-fatigue variables, were found to hold. Relationships between 0. 2 % cyclic proof strength and hardness, tensile strength, and proof strength were, however, found. It w a s also established that stress amplitude at 0. 1 % and 0. 4 % plastic strain amplitude could be effectively related to a combination of composition variables and proof strength. This pair of relationships then allowed the prediction of the cyclic stress-strain relationships in the absence of data derived from fatigue tests. Despite the reported relationships between the parameters of the Coffin-Manson form of the cyclic stress-strain relationship and strength, in the present study none of these relationships, nor those with the other available non-fatigue variables, proved to hold. Relationships were, however, found with elastic, plastic and total strain amplitudes at various lives allowing the cyclic strength and cyclic ductility relationships to be estimated. For the fatigue strength line, relationships were found at short and long endurances. At short life, the relationship w a s with tensile strength, while at long life, the relationship was with a combination of composition variables and hardness. Additional relationships were used to identify the locus of the fatigue ductility line. Transition life could be estimated from a relationship with yield strength, and the strain at this life estimated from the fatigue strength relationship. The fatigue ductility relationship could then be estimated either by applying the average value for fatigue ductility exponent, or by estimating the locus of a point at one million cycles, from relationships with total and elastic strain, at this life. This estimation method, while not particularly accurate, w as found to be quite acceptable where no fatigue data were available experimentally. In summary, this study has characterised the fatigue properties of the formable hot rolled strip steels, available in Australia. In addition, methods have been developed, and used to determine the effects of the manufacturing variables, thickness, orientation to rolling direction, and <b>skin-passing,</b> on fatigue performance. Finally, relationships have been developed between fatigue properties and the more readily determined material properties, strength, hardness, composition and microstructure. These relationships provide insight into the best choices for design of fatigue resistant alloys, and allow the prediction of fatigue properties in the absence of fatigue test data...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{chemistry}} and reactivity of skin-passed {{hot dip galvanized}} coating This paper aims at describing surface {{chemistry and}} reactivity of skin-passed hot dip galvanized coatings. GI coatings surfaces are covered by a very thin aluminum oxide 5 nm thick layer that precipitates just immediately after wiping. Anisotropic growing of zinc crystals during solidification induces a strong basal texture in GI coatings.

40|$|AbstractHot rolled, {{annealed}} or galvanized {{low carbon}} steel sheets display yield points in tensile testing. These are associated with deformation heterogeneities along the test specimen, known as Lüders bands, which cause an unacceptable surface appearance in steel sheet formed products. This problem is usually eliminated through a light cold rolling pass (“skin-pass”) in the material as a last step in its industrial manufacturing, imposing a reduction of thickness of about 1 – 2. 0 % on the sheet. Existing experimental results for these strain heterogeneities along the rolling direction are analyzed, as well as corresponding finite element analyses. The constitutive behavior of the material is described by a curve displaying an initial stress peak followed by the work hardening of the material. The FEAs led to distributions and shapes of Lüders bands in the sheets similar to the experimental ones. The bands nucleate intermitently and propagate {{from the surface of}} the sheets, at the initial contact region between the material and the rolls. For low and high friction between the material and the roll and for low sheet thickness reductions (0. 5 % and 1. 0 %), a limited influence of the roll diameter on the Lüders bands distribution was found. For sheet thickness reductions of 2. 0 % and higher, high friction between the roll and the material and large roll diameters, the distribution of LBs in the sheets was different from that obtained for small roll diameters and low friction between the rolls and the material. Increasing thickness reductions in the <b>skin-pass</b> led to changes in the Lüders bands distribution, involving an increasing homogeneity in the deformation. It is suggested that the critical thickness reduction in the <b>skin-pass</b> is associated to a minimum volume fraction of material deformed above a certain strain level...|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} to determine residual stress distribution in sheet material from data collected in a free bending test. It may be used where the residual stress distribution is symmetrical about the mid-surface as {{it is usually the}} case for frequently-used sheet metal post-processing techniques such as <b>skin-pass</b> or temper rolling, tension- and roller leveling. An existing inverse technique is used to obtain a residual stress profile and material constants that provide the best fit in a finite element analysis of bending with the experimentally derived moment-curvature relation. The method is verified for bending of a low-carbon stainless steel using measurement of residual stress by X-ray diffraction. The residual stresses were induced in the sheet by cold rolling. The technique described here can be used industrially as a rapid method of investigating residual stresses in incoming sheet. In processes where the deformation is principally one of bending, such as cold roll forming, it is known that residual stresses have an influence on shape defects and springback and the method presented here can be used to determine whether incoming sheet is suitable for further processing and also as a means of obtaining improved material data input for numerical simulation...|$|E
40|$|During this presentation, two {{numerical}} {{methods for}} managing contact in large stresses/strains problems are described: the Lagrange Multipliers method (available in Cast 3 M - FE code used in LaCaN) and the penalty method (available in Metafor - FE code used at LTAS-MCT - University of Liège). Contact algorithms {{can be divided}} into three steps. The first one - the contact search - is purely geometric and answers the question: which nodes are currently in contact. Main problems and their solutions are discussed. The computation of the normal force is the second step. Non-penetration conditions are applied on the contact nodes. Finally, during the third step, a tangent force due to friction is applied when the nodes are sticking or sliding. Methods are compared in details in the case of metal forming processes. The penalty method seems to be more efficient when a large number of contact nodes are involved during the simulation. The system to be solved is smaller, the convergence is faster and curved analytical surfaces can be easily used for the tools. However, a good penalty coefficient can sometimes be hard to find.

40|$|The {{metal strip}} used in roll forming {{has often been}} preprocessed by (tension or roller) {{leveling}} or by <b>skin-pass</b> rolling, and as a consequence, may contain residual stresses. These stresses are not well observed by the tensile test, but could {{have a significant effect}} on the bending and springback behavior. With the advent of improved process design techniques for roll forming, including advanced finite element techniques, the need for precise material property data has become important. The major deformation mode of roll forming is that of bending combined with unloading and reverse bending, and hence property data derived from bend tests could be more relevant than that from tensile testing. This work presents a numerical study on the effect of skin passing on the material behavior of stainless steel strip in pure bending and tension. A two dimensional (2 -D) numerical model was developed using Abaqus Explicit to analyze the affect of skin passing on the residual stress profile across a section for various working conditions. The deformed meshes and their final stress fields were then imported as pre-defined fields into Abaqus Standard, and the post-skin passing material behavior in pure bending was determined. The results show that a residual stress profile is introduced into the steel strip during skin passing, and that its shape and stress level depend on the overall thickness reduction as well as the number of rolling passes used in the skin passing process. The material behavior in bending and the amount of springback changed significantly depending on the skin pass condition...|$|E
