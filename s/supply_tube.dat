5000|$|Caplow {{invented the}} Vertically Integrated Greenhouse (VIG) with Zakery Ward Adams. The {{invention}} {{is listed as}} Patent US20090307973 and was published in December 2009. [...] The VIG consists of vertically stacked plant trays that can be moved to maximize plant light capture and shade as necessary. In addition to the trays and suspension system, the VIG system includes a water distribution system which consists of a reservoir, a pump, and a water <b>supply</b> <b>tube</b> for growing plants hydroponically. The reservoir holds excess water for recirculation making the system a closed-loop. According to the patent abstract, “the design is particularly well-suited for installation in a double-skin façade of a building, or in an interior atrium, lobby, or similar structure.” Caplow and Adams built and installed prototypes of the VIG on the Science Barge (2008), at PS 333 in Manhattan (2010), and at PS 89 in Brooklyn (2011), and Caplow built an improved VIG at the Miami Museum of Science (2012). The next VIG is slated for PS 84 in Brooklyn, NY (2015).|$|E
50|$|Ultra low volume fogging {{machines}} {{consists of}} a blower, a formulation-holding tank and in some equipment a pump. The machine can have an electric, battery or gasoline engine that drives the blower. The blower creates a low pressure area and forces air through the nozzle of the fog machine. Air pressure can be controlled by adjusting the engine speed. Formulation is delivered by means of either electric, gear, FMI or Diaphragm pump to deliver the formulation to the nozzle of the machine, or in other equipment it is delivered through creating a low air pressure in the formulation tank to force the formulation to the nozzle for easy application.The nozzle of the machine has a very specific shape, which causes a swirling motion of the air stream. The motion is achieved by means of several stationary fins that force the air to rotate. The formulation is delivered to the air {{by means of a}} <b>supply</b> <b>tube</b> that is situated {{in the center of the}} nozzle. The motion of the air shears the liquid formulation into very small droplets and then disperses it into the atmosphere. ULV fogging machines are the most preferred misting machines as the size of the droplets can be controlled by means of machine calibration.|$|E
50|$|Pioneer 4 was a {{cone-shaped}} probe 51 cm {{high and}} 23 cm in diameter at its base. The cone {{was composed of}} a thin fiberglass shell coated with a gold wash to make it electrically conducting and painted with white stripes to maintain the temperature between 10 and 50 degrees Celsius. At {{the tip of the}} cone was a small probe which combined with the cone itself to act as an antenna. At the base of the cone a ring of mercury batteries provided power. A photoelectric sensor protruded {{from the center of the}} ring. The sensor was designed with two photocells which would be triggered by the light of the Moon when the probe was within about 30,000 km of the Moon. At the center of the cone was a voltage <b>supply</b> <b>tube</b> and two Geiger-Müller tubes. A transmitter with a mass of 0.5 kilograms delivered a phase modulated signal of 0.1 W at a frequency of 960.05 MHz. The modulated carrier power was 0.08 W and the total effective radiated power 0.18 W. A despin mechanism consisted of two 7 gram weights which spooled out to the end of two 150 cm wires when triggered by a hydraulic timer 10 hours after launch. The weights were designed to slow the spacecraft spin from 400 rpm to 6 rpm, and then weights and wires were released. Pioneer 4 received a few small modifications over its predecessor, namely added lead shielding around the Geiger tubes and modifications to the telemetry system to improve its reliability and signal strength. The probe had S/N #4, with probe #3 recalled from launch due to technical issues.|$|E

50|$|Pioneer 3 was a {{cone-shaped}} probe 58 cm {{high and}} 25 cm diameter at its base. The cone {{was composed of}} a thin fiberglass shell coated with a gold wash to make it electrically conducting and painted with black and white stripes to maintain the temperature between 10 and 50 degrees Celsius. At {{the tip of the}} cone was a small probe which combined with the cone itself to act as an antenna. At the base of the cone a ring of mercury batteries provided power. A photoelectric sensor protruded {{from the center of the}} ring. The sensor was designed with two photocells which would be triggered by the light of the Moon when the probe was within about 30,000 km of the Moon. Under original plans, the probe would have carried a camera capable of taking a single photograph of the Moon, but after the discovery of the Van Allen Belts by Explorer 1, the camera was replaced with a Geiger counter for radiation measuring. At the center of the cone was a voltage <b>supply</b> <b>tube</b> and two Geiger-Müller tubes. A transmitter with a mass of 0.5 kg delivered a phase-modulated signal of 0.1 W at a frequency of 960.05 MHz. The modulated carrier power was 0.08 W and the total effective radiated power 0.18 W. A despin mechanism consisted of two 7 gram weights which could be spooled out to the end of two 150 cm wires when triggered by a hydraulic timer 10 hours after launch. The weights would slow the spacecraft spin from 400 rpm to 6 rpm and then weights and wires would be released. While the Thor-Able Pioneer probes were designed to go into orbit around the Moon, the Juno Pioneer probes would crash land instead, although given the crude launch vehicle guidance system and direct ascent trajectory, the odds of hitting the Moon were slim. However, a lunar flyby rather than impact would still be considered a successful mission.|$|E

40|$|The Attitude Control Motor (ACM) {{is being}} {{developed}} {{for use in the}} Launch Abort System (LAS) of NASA's Ares I launch vehicle. The ACM consists of a small solid rocket motor and eight actuated pintle valves that directionally allocate. thrust_- 1 t. has-been- predicted-that significant unsteady. pressure. fluctuations. will. exist. inside the-valves during operation. The dominant frequencies of these oscillations correspond to the lowest several acoustic natural frequencies of the individual valves. An acoustic finite element model of the fluid volume inside the valve has been critical to the prediction of these frequencies and their associated mode shapes. This work describes an effort to experimentally validate the acoustic finite model of the valve with an acoustic modal test. The modal test involved instrumenting a flight-like valve with six microphones and then exciting the enclosed air with a loudspeaker. The loudspeaker was configured to deliver broadband noise at relatively high sound pressure levels. The aquired microphone signals were post-processed and compared to results generated from the acoustic finite element model. Initial comparisons between the test data and the model results revealed that additional model refinement was necessary. Specifically, the model was updated to implement a complex impedance boundary condition {{at the entrance to the}} valve <b>supply</b> <b>tube.</b> This boundary condition models the frequency-dependent impedance that an acoustic wave will encounter as it reaches the end of the <b>supply</b> <b>tube.</b> Upon invoking this boundary condition, significantly improved agreement between the test data and the model was realized...|$|E
40|$|This {{engineering}} note contains {{miscellaneous information}} about the rectangular liquid helium <b>supply</b> <b>tube</b> for the D-Zero solenoid. The information is fairly superficial, but {{could be used as}} a starting point for a future engineer who is going to specify and puchase the tubing. The chimney contains 4 conductors attached to an aluminum liquid helium <b>supply</b> <b>tube.</b> Because good thermal contact is desired, the tube will have flat sides. Aluminum is chosen to match the thermal contraction coefficient of the superconductor's aluminum stabilizer. The type of aluminum is chosen as 6061 -T 6 because it's allowable stress in ANSI/ASME B 31. 3 is higher than for other alloys. A different alloy could be chosen for extrusion reasons. The highest pressures this tubing should see will be during a quench. Current calculations predict the peak pressure during a quench to be 520 psi a for one-way relieving and 250 psia for two way relieving. Whatever the final alloy selection, the tubing needs to have a high enough allowable working pressure. There is very little room in the obround section of the chimney. In that portion the shape is rectangular, 12. 7 mm (0. 50 -inch) x 31. 8 mm (1. 25 -inch). A drawing shows the flow path cross section. This also could be changed for extrusion reasons if necessary. The important thing here is to estimate the pressure drop and make sure it is acceptable. Pressure drop estimates for this cross section are acceptable since it only about 10 feet in length...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is simplifying and downsizing of pneumatic system consisting of many pneumatic actuators. For this purpose a new method of multiplex pneumatic transmission for multi-pneumatic servo system is proposed. The pneumatic valve for this system has a simple structure consisting of two vibrators supported by springs. The working principle of the valve is based on vibrator resonance caused by multiplex pneumatic vibration in air supply line and this makes the valve work as an ON/OFF valve without electric wire or independent pneumatic tubes. Valve control needs superimposed only an air <b>supply</b> <b>tube</b> for its independent control, making this pneumatic system suitable for the system having many degrees of freedom.

40|$|A sound {{operated}} {{directional control}} valve (SODC-Valve) is proposed which opens and closes {{in response to the}} sound of a specific frequency propagated inside the gas <b>supply</b> <b>tube</b> and therefore needs no electric wiring to convey the control signals. By using multi-frequency sound, several valves can be controlled simultaneously and resultantly the pneumatic multi-degree wearable system can be constructed compactly. Firstly, the sound-gas pressure converter is proposed and improved so that self-excited vibration can be suppressed. Secondly, the basic characteristic of the sound-gas pressure converter is investigated to show that the back pressure is different depending on whether the sound of specific frequency is added or not. Furthermore, a pilot valve is developed. Because the pilot pressure change of the pilot valve developed is only 20 kPa, a main valve is proposed and developed. Finally, a pneumatic multi-degree-of-freedom wearable power-assist system is constructed by using a Dry Ice Power Cell as the portable gas supply, wearable actuators developed in the previous study, and two sound operated {{directional control valve}}s developed.
