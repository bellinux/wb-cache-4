One application is called a floating <b>static</b> <b>route,</b> where the <b>static</b> <b>route</b> is less preferred than a route from any routing protocol. The <b>static</b> <b>route,</b> which might use a dialup link or other slow medium, activates only when the dynamic routing protocol(s) cannot provide a route to the destination.|$|R
50|$|Manually {{configuring}} {{the administrative}} distance is also required when configuring a floating <b>static</b> <b>route.</b> Floating <b>Static</b> <b>routes</b> {{are used to}} provide an alternate path when a primary link fails. In order for <b>static</b> <b>routes</b> to be configured as a backup, the <b>static</b> <b>route's</b> administrative distance {{would need to be}} adjusted. Otherwise, it will take precedence over all routing protocols and routes issued from a routing protocol will not be inserted into the routing table. The example below shows how to configure the administrative distance to 254 to specify that it should only be used as a last resort.|$|R

The next-hop address could also be on a subnet that is directly connected, and, before the router can determine if the <b>static</b> <b>route</b> is usable, it must do a recursive lookup of the next hop address in the local routing table. If the next-hop address is reachable, the <b>static</b> <b>route</b> is usable, but if the next-hop is unreachable, the route is ignored.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{spite of}} {{inability}} to dynamically adapt to network topology failures and high management overhead, Static Routing still offers robustness to routing convergence failure, external route spoofing and easy prediction. This paper proposes a Static Routing strategy with an objective of extending {{its ability to}} adapt to logical network topology changes, equipment failures or network outages 'on the fly'. This strategy will involve discovery of all possible <b>Static</b> <b>Routes</b> from a specific source router to destination router, analyzing and ordering their applicability using optimality principle based Sink Tree approach. A random subnet composed of fifteen routers is simulated and mapped to Sink Tree and most obvious paths between random source and destination are analyzed. <b>Static</b> <b>Routes</b> are traced to extract information about hop count from source to destination. The hop count information is recorded for each <b>Static</b> <b>Route</b> trace and comparative analysis is performed. Based on this comparison the <b>Static</b> <b>Route</b> are sorted in order of preference as per optimality principle and are offered to router as secondary routes in event of failure of primary preferred <b>Static</b> <b>Route,</b> thereby retaining the benefits of Static Routing while still availing the flexibility of Dynamic Routing to some extent...|$|R

50|$|A remote {{network is}} {{a network that}} is not {{directly}} connected to the router. In other words, a remote network is a network {{that can only be}} reached by sending the packet to another router. Remote networks are added to the routing table using either a dynamic routing protocol or by configuring <b>static</b> <b>routes.</b> Dynamic routes are routes to remote networks that were learned automatically by the router, using a dynamic routing protocol. <b>Static</b> <b>routes</b> are routes to networks that a network administrator manually configured.|$|R

5000|$|The {{routing table}} itself can contain {{information}} {{derived from a}} variety of sources, such as a default or <b>static</b> <b>routes</b> that are configured manually, or dynamic routing protocols where the router learns routes from other routers. A default route is one that is used to route all traffic whose destination does not otherwise appear in the routing table; this is common [...] - &#32; even necessary [...] - &#32; in small networks, such as a home or small business where the default route simply sends all non-local traffic to the Internet service provider.

50|$|Static routing {{is a form}} of routing {{that occurs}} when a router uses a manually-configured routing entry, rather than {{information}} from a dynamic routing traffic. In many cases, <b>static</b> <b>routes</b> are manually configured by a network administrator by adding in entries into a routing table, though this may not always be the case. Unlike dynamic routing, <b>static</b> <b>routes</b> are fixed and do not change if the network is changed or reconfigured. Static routing and dynamic routing are not mutually exclusive. Both dynamic routing and static routing are usually used on a router to maximise routing efficiency and to provide backups in the event that dynamic routing information fails to be exchanged. Static routing can also be used in stub networks, or to provide a gateway of last resort.|$|R
50|$|Each {{connected}} entity {{could add}} specific details of networks {{they want to}} talk to directly to their routers (<b>static</b> <b>routes</b> and bilateral BGP sessions) but this quickly becomes an administrative headache as adds, changes and deletions become time consuming and error prone if more than a few peering sessions are configured.|$|R
50|$|The PowerConnect 6024F was a 24 port, layer 3, all-Gigabit, fiber-optimized switch. It had 24 SFP ports, {{eight of}} which doubled as copper ports. This switch {{was capable of}} routing, with <b>static</b> <b>routes,</b> Routing Information Protocol (RIP), and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF). It was {{replaced}} by the PowerConnect 6224/6248 models.|$|R
5000|$|Administrative overhead: <b>Static</b> <b>routes</b> must be {{configured}} on each router in the network(s). This configuration {{can take}} a long time if there are many routers. It also means that reconfiguration can be slow and inefficient. Dynamic routing on the other hand automatically propagates routing changes, reducing the need for manual reconfiguration.|$|R
5000|$|Control plane: A router {{maintains}} a routing table that lists which route {{should be used}} to forward a data packet, and through which physical interface connection. It does this using internal pre-configured directives, called <b>static</b> <b>routes,</b> or by learning routes using a dynamic routing protocol. <b>Static</b> and dynamic <b>routes</b> are stored in the Routing Information Base (RIB). The control-plane logic then strips non-essential directives from the RIB and builds a Forwarding Information Base (FIB) to be used by the forwarding-plane.|$|R
5000|$|Fault tolerance: Static routing is not fault tolerant. This {{means that}} {{when there is a}} change in the network or a failure occurs between two statically defined devices, traffic will not be re-routed. As a result, the network is {{unusable}} until the failure is repaired or the <b>static</b> <b>route</b> is manually reconfigured by an administrator.|$|R
30|$|Central venous {{catheters}} {{are often}} used for contrast injection. Although there are safety issues related to this such as the risk of catheter rupture, fragmentation, or thromboembolism, these devices can be safely used if appropriate precautions including manufacturer specifications are followed [34]. Studies have shown that vascular enhancement is superior with central venous catheter injections compared to peripheral <b>route</b> <b>injections</b> due to the short time to peak enhancement facilitated by shorter travel distance for contrast bolus. There is also reduced individual patient variability [8]. However, the contrast injection is typically performed slower than peripheral routes due to safety concerns. Since the contrast media will directly opacify the lower SVC or the right atrium and the subsequent cardiovascular structures, the upper SVC and other veins will not be adequately opacified in the first pass as with a peripheral <b>route</b> <b>injection.</b> Hence, if venous visualization is the primary clinical objective, a delayed phase should be obtained {{in addition to the}} arterial phase.|$|R

5000|$|Verifying the {{configuration}} of the administrative distance is done on Cisco equipment using the show ip route command in privileged exec mode on the console of the Cisco router. In the example shown below, the administrative distance is 1. The letter [...] "S" [...] indicates that the <b>route</b> is a <b>static</b> <b>route</b> that has, for all intents and purposes, been added manually to the router process by the administrator and installed into the routing table.|$|R
50|$|Originally, the {{switching}} tables {{could not}} be altered separately from the main executable code, and topology updates {{had to be made}} by deliberately crashing the switch code and forcing a reboot from the network management center.

[...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer ScienceIn this thesis, an {{analytical}} {{discussion of the}} three publicly available Inter-autonomous system Multiprotocol Label Switching Layer- 3 Virtual Private Network (Inter-AS MPLS L 3 VPN) implementations, namely, Back-to-Back Virtual Route Forwarding, Single-Hop MP-BGP with <b>static</b> <b>routes,</b> and Multi-hop External Multiprotocol Border Gateway Protocol (MP-EBGP) between Autonomous System(AS) ’s route reflectors. An analytical model is developed to evaluate the round-trip delay of a packet with respect to these three implementations. These implementations are used to provide MPLS L 3 VPN between Internet Service Providers (ISP) or between different backbone networks within an enterprise. A testbed consisting of Cisco routers and switches is {{used to evaluate the}} three implementations in terms of impact of the design of these three implementation implementations on the round-trip delay. Priority queue is used on all routers in the testbed and the background traffic is assigned with the best-effort service. Priority traffic is marked CE routers. The testbed analysis shows that Single-Hop MP-BGP with <b>static</b> <b>routes</b> is the best among the three implementations with the least round-trip delay.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the interactions between}} routing and inventory-management decisions in a two-level supply chain consisting of a cross-docking warehouse and N retailers. Retailer demand is normally distributed and independent across retailers and over time. Travel times are fixed between pairs of system sites. Every m time periods, system inventory is replenished at the warehouse, whereupon an uncapacitated vehicle departs on a route that visits each retailer once and only once, allocating all of its inventory based {{on the status of}} inventory at the retailers who have not yet received allocations. The retailers experience newsvendor-type inventory-holding and backorder-penalty costs each period; the vehicle experiences in-transit inventory-holding costs each period. Our goal is to determine a combined system inventory-replenishment, routing, and inventory-allocation policy that minimizes the total expected cost/period of the system over an infinite time horizon. Our analysis begins by examining the determination of the optimal <b>static</b> <b>route,</b> i. e., the best route if the vehicle must travel the same route every replenishment-allocation cycle. Here we demonstrate that the optimal <b>static</b> <b>route</b> is not the shortest-total-distance (TSP) route, but depends on the variance of customer demands, and, if in-transit inventory-holding costs are charged, also on mean customer demands. We then examine dynamic-routing policies, i. e., policies that can change the route from one system-replenishment-allocation cycle to another, based on the status of the retailers' inventories. Here we argue that in the absence of transportation-related cost, the optimal dynamic-routing policy should be viewed as balancing management's ability to respond to system uncertainties (by changing routes) against system uncertainties that are induced by changing routes. We then examine the performance of a change-revert heuristic policy. Although its routing decisions are not fully dynamic, but determined and fixed for a given cycle at the time of each system replenishment, simulation tests with N = 2 and N = 6 retailers indicate that its use can substantially reduce system inventory-related costs even if {{most of the time the}} chosen route is the optimal <b>static</b> <b>route.</b> supply chain, routing, inventory allocation, inventory replenishment...|$|R
