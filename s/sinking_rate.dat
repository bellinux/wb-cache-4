This sinking is induced by either {{a loss of}} buoyancy control, the synthesis of mucilage that sticks diatoms cells together, or the production of heavy resting spores. Sinking out of the upper mixed layer removes diatoms from conditions unfavourable to growth, including grazer populations and higher temperatures (which would otherwise increase cell metabolism). Cells reaching deeper water or the shallow seafloor can then rest until conditions become more favourable again. In the open ocean, many sinking cells are lost to the deep, but refuge populations can persist near the thermocline.|$|E

Initial (0 - 2 m deep) and overall <b>sink</b> <b>rates</b> {{of a range of}} line weighting options – each comprising a different combination of weight and leader length (distance between hook and weight) – were compared and several options identified that offer faster <b>sink</b> <b>rates</b> and hence pose reduced risk of seabird bycatch. The effect on catch rates of target and non-target species of placing weights adjacent to the hook was also tested and a new design of lead weight (‘sliding hook leads’) was developed that offers significant economic and safety advantages over traditional leaded swivels. Key findings include that: • the fastest initial and overall <b>sink</b> <b>rates</b> were achieved with weights at the hook; these sank significantly faster than the same weight with any length of leader; • 60 g weight with 1 m leader also performed well, with a significantly faster <b>sink</b> <b>rate</b> than 60 g at 3. 5 m from the hook; • all weights with longer leaders had slowest initial <b>sink</b> <b>rates</b> and thus pose higher risks of seabird bycatch; an...|$|R

Salps are large gelatinous plankton that can vertically migrate 800 meters and eat large amounts of food at the surface. They have a very long gut retention time, so fecal pellets usually are released at maximum depth. Salps are also known for having some of the largest fecal pellets. Because of this they have a very fast <b>sinking</b> <b>rate,</b> small detritus particles are known to aggregate on them. This makes them sink that much faster.

40|$|The {{subsurface}} chlorophyll maximum (SCM) {{is widespread}} in the oligotrophic ocean and significantly contributes to primary production. One reason for the SCM formation {{is believed to be}} the rapid export of phytoplankton from surface layers, which might be caused by aggregation, faster sinking rates under nutrient limitation, or the formation of a resting stage. In this study, these three processes were included in a biological model to investigate their contributions to subsurface chlorophyll. To further identify their individual effects on SCM formation, four modeling experiments were carried out. Three used a simple approach with either (a) density-dependent aggregation, (b) accelerated <b>sinking</b> <b>rate</b> of phytoplankton, or (c) a resting stage. The other experiment combined all three approaches (a-c). A set of observations in the South China Sea was used to optimize the four experiments and compare their abilities to replicate observed values. The results of the experiments with the resting stage showed the best fit to the field observations. All experiments were able to capture major features of the chlorophyll field (e. g. surface bloom and SCM). The experiment with accelerated <b>sinking</b> <b>rate</b> failed to reproduce the observed profile of particulate organic carbon. The experiment with only aggregation predicted lower chlorophyll concentrations in summer than those measured in the field, while experiments with the resting stage reproduced more accurate chlorophyll concentrations. Formulas including the resting stage more successfully captured the timing of phytoplankton export than did those including aggregation and accelerated <b>sinking</b> <b>rate.</b> The processes of aggregation and accelerated <b>sinking</b> <b>rate</b> made small contributions to the SCM formation in the last experiment Overall, these results show that introducing the resting stage improves SCM simulations of the South China Sea. The results of the experiment with only the resting stage showed that the resting cells shift rapidly from the surface water, encounter better nutrient conditions in nutricline layers, partially germinate into vegetative cells, become shade-adapted, and increase subsurface chlorophyll concentrations during summer, which contributes to SCM formation.

40|$|There is {{an energy}} {{requirement}} {{for the maintenance of}} low sinking rates (~ 0. 1 m d-l) in the marine diatom Ditylum brightwellii. The lowest sinking rates occurred when cells were grown under ii-radiances saturating for growth. The highest sinking rates occurred when cells grown at growth-limiting irradiances were placed in the dark, or in cells treated with a respiratory inhibitor. Small cells sank more rapidly than large cells under saturating light, but under severe energy limitation sinking rates were directly proportional to cell volume. When cells were grown under saturating irradiance and then placed in the dark, their <b>sinking</b> <b>rate</b> increased as their respiration rate decreased over time. We suggest that when light is unavailable, a diatom’s ability to use energy gained from respiration may be the principal determinant of its <b>sinking</b> <b>rate.</b> We provide the first estimate of the dependence of cell <b>sinking</b> <b>rate</b> on cell respiration and suggest that the sinking-respiration relationship may be useful in predicting the sinking dynamics of diatoms during a bloom.

Speed, <b>sinking</b> <b>rate</b> and turning angle show uni-formity of variance among treatments, and they are relatively independent. Light level and food level strongly affected swimming behavior. Light and food effects tended to be independent, although there were two instances of synergism (out of 12 possible interactions). Each of the four species (one clone per species) showed a unique response to food and light, which may reflect the diverse environmental origin of each clone. Swimming behavior was consistently different between the small-scale (183 ml) observation chamber and the mesocosm-scale (6400 1) plankton tower, suggesting that container size affects swimming behavior: in the smaller chamber, Daphnia, regardless of species, swam slower, sank slower and tended to move in straighter paths...|$|E
