5|$|On the {{southeast}} and northeast of the Gedhong Gapuro Panggung are two buildings known as Gedhong Temanten. The buildings were formerly used by the castle guard. According to archeological study, on the south <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> building was another building and a garden whose remain cannot be seen anymore and is filled with settlements.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish conquest had as its {{principal}} aims the physical {{incorporation of the}} indigenous peoples of Chiapas into the Spanish Empire, and their spiritual conversion to Christianity. This involved the dismantling of indigenous power structures, the destruction of pagan temples and idols, the concentration of indigenous populations in centralised settlements that could be more easily controlled and evangelised, the incorporation of these new settlements into the Spanish system of tributes and taxes, {{and the introduction of}} Christian imagery. One <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> involved armed struggle and the imposition of Spanish colonial administration by force; the religious <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> struggle was the generally peaceful conversion of indigenous populations to Christianity. In Chiapas, such evangelisation efforts were generally carried out by the Dominican Order. The Dominicans became involved in the concentration of Indians into new settlements, the construction of churches and convents, and the religious instruction of the natives.|$|E
5|$|The {{advance of}} the 18th RCT cleared away the last {{remnants}} of the force defending the E-1 draw. When engineers cut a road up the western <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> draw, it became the main route inland off the beaches. With the congestion on the beaches thus relieved, they were re-opened for the landing of vehicles by 14:00. Further congestion on this route, caused by continued resistance just inland at St. Laurent, was bypassed with a new route, and at 17:00, the surviving tanks of the 741st tank battalion were ordered inland via the E-1 draw.|$|E

5|$|The main {{entrance}} to the station {{is at the bottom}} of the station approach, a ramp off the bridge that carries Fishergate over the railway. The ticket office exists within the small concourse. This concourse gives direct access, down the ramp, to the intercity platforms 3 and 4. There are footbridges on either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> ramp to all other platforms. The eastern footbridge ends at an alternative {{entrance to the}} station on Butler Street, giving closer access to Preston city centre and the station car park. There also exists a subway which provides step-free access to all eight platforms in use at the station and with platform 7, at the south end of which is another entrance serving the station car park.|$|E
5|$|The west front has two {{flights of}} broad, balustraded steps {{leading up to}} the central door. Inside is a full-height hall with a part-hipped valley roof. On either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> are {{octagonal}} turrets with cupolas and delicately pierced parapets. To the left of the hall is the former medieval kitchen with a balustraded parapet and buttresses. To the right is a range of parapetted rooms with a stepped buttress at the corner. The south front was plain, being the inside north wall of the original abbey church which was pulled down, but was rebuilt by William Talbot in 1828 to include bay windows. At this end of the building is Sharington's tower, an octagonal, three-storey tower, topped with a belvedere, balustrade and stair turret.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{buildings}} in the bathing complex. The northernmost building {{was used as the}} resting place and changing room for the daughters and concubines of the sultan. On the south <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> building is a pool known as Umbul Muncar. The pool is divided into two by a central pathway (known as Blumbang Kuras) that runs east-west. The next building on the south is a building with a tower in its center. The right wing of the building was used as the sultan's changing room, the east wing was used as his resting place. The central tower was used by the sultan to observe his daughters and concubines bathing in the pool.|$|E

5|$|Though Gloria {{moved quickly}} through the region, it dropped {{moderate}} rainfall in locations, including 6.04 inches (153 mm) at Baltimore–Washington International Airport. In addition, some unofficial reports in southeastern Virginia indicated amounts of up to 8 inches (200 mm) of rain. Because much of the Mid-Atlantic experienced the western, weaker <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> hurricane, damage was relatively light. High winds downed numerous trees throughout the area, leaving hundreds of thousands without power, including 237,000 in New Jersey, 124,000 in Maryland, and 56,000 in Virginia. Extreme rainfall in Virginia resulted in $5.5 million (1985 USD) in damage. Intense flood waters split Long Beach Island in half {{for a period of}} time.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{inherent}} difficulties in accounting for inflation, several {{attempts have been}} made. Estimates depend on the price index used to adjust the grosses, and the exchange rates used to convert between currencies can also impact upon the calculations, both of which can {{have an effect on}} the ultimate rankings of an inflation adjusted list. Gone with the Wind—first released in 1939—is generally considered to be the most successful film, with Guinness World Records in 2014 estimating its adjusted global gross at $3.4 billion. Estimates for Gone with the Winds adjusted gross have varied substantially: its owner, Turner Entertainment, estimated its adjusted earnings at $3.3 billion in 2007, a few years earlier than the Guinness estimate; other estimates fall either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> amount, with one putting its gross just under $3 billion in 2010, while another provided an alternative figure of $3.8 billion in 2006. Which film is Gone with the Winds nearest rival depends on the set of figures used: Guinness had Avatar in second place with $3 billion, while other estimates saw Titanic in the runner-up spot with first-run worldwide earnings of almost $2.9 billion at 2010 prices. The only other film that all sources agreed grossed in excess of $2 billion at recent prices is Star Wars; according to Guinness it has earned $2.8 billion at 2014 price levels, while other sources from 2010/2011 put its adjusted earnings at $2.2–2.6 billion.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to move city and county {{government}} functions {{out of the state}} capitol, the city purchased a plot of land to build on in 1832. They chose a spot on the edge of De Witt's public square, along Eagle Street at the eastern terminus of Lion Street (later renamed Washington Avenue); the land was bought from St. Peter's Church for $10,295.95 ($ in modern dollars). The design of the new city hall was done by Albany architect Philip Hooker. The cornerstone was laid by Mayor John Townsend amid a Masonic ceremony, however the date of this event is in dispute. The building was completed in 1832 {{at a cost of about}} $92,000 ($ in modern dollars). The new city hall was a Greek Revival structure, built of white marble with an entrance porch supported by four Doric columns. On the roof was a gilded dome. The interior was simple, with little ornamentation, though a full-length statue of Alexander Hamilton stood in the center of the upper hall, between the Court room and the Common Council Chamber. Upon one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> hall was a bas-relief of DeWitt Clinton, with a view of a primitive canal-boat in the distance, and on the opposite wall was a similar figure of Sir Walter Scott. The building was destroyed by fire on February 10, 1880. Plans for a replacement city hall quickly developed.|$|E

5|$|On {{the south}} side of Kenongo Island is a row of small {{buildings}} called the Tajug. These buildings were originally used as air vents for the tunnel located below the lake. This underground tunnel, constructed in 1761,was an alternative way to reach the Kenongo Island other than by a vessel. Also on {{the south side}} of the Kenongo Island is another artificial island called Cemethi Island (Javanese Pulo Cemethi) or Panembung Island (Javanese Pulo Panembung). It is a one-storeyed structure for the Sultan to meditate, or some said, a hiding place for the royal family during an attack. Another name for this island is Sumur Gumantung, because on the south <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> island is a well that hangs above the ground. This place could only be reached via the underwater tunnel. The building of Cemethi Island is now also in ruin. A legend says that there is a secret tunnel that connects the palace with the south sea (Indian Ocean) where Nyai Roro Kidul or the Queen of the South has her palace. The supernatural Queen becomes the spiritual wife of Yogyakarta Sultan for many generations.|$|E
5|$|The {{roots of}} a tree serve to anchor {{it to the ground}} and gather water and {{nutrients}} to transfer to all parts of the tree. They are also used for reproduction, defence, survival, energy storage and many other purposes. The radicle or embryonic root is the first part of a seedling to emerge from the seed during the process of germination. This develops into a taproot which goes straight downwards. Within a few weeks lateral roots branch out of the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> and grow horizontally through the upper layers of the soil. In most trees, the taproot eventually withers away and the wide-spreading laterals remain. Near the tip of the finer roots are single cell root hairs. These are in immediate contact with the soil particles and can absorb water and nutrients such as potassium in solution. The roots require oxygen to respire and only a few species such as the mangrove and the pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens) can live in permanently waterlogged soil.|$|E
5|$|The thighbone is {{straight}} in front view. Seen {{from the same}} direction its head is perpendicular to the shaft, seen from above it is orientated 20° to the front. The greater trochanter is relatively wide and separated from the robust lesser trochanter in front of it, by a fissure. At the front base of the lesser trochanter a low accessory trochanter is present. At {{the lower end of}} the thighbone a distinct front, extensor, groove separates the condyles. At the upper inner <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> groove a rough area is present continuing inwards into a longitudinal ridge, a typical megalosauroid trait. The shinbone, or tibia, is relatively straight, slightly curving inwards. To below, its shaft progressively flattens from front to rear, resulting in a generally oval cross-section. For about an eighth of its length the front lower end of the shaft is covered by a vertical branch of the astragalus. Of the foot, only the second, third and fourth metatarsals are known, the bone elements that were connected to the three weight-bearing toes. They are straight and robust, showing ligament pits at their lower sides. The third metatarsal has no clear condyles at its lower end, resulting in a more flexible joint, allowing for a modicum of horizontal movement. The top inner side of the third metatarsal carries a unique ridge that fits into a groove along the top outer side of the second metatarsal, causing a tighter connection.|$|E

5|$|Business US Highway127 (Bus. US127) is a {{business}} loop of US127 through Jackson that is wholly concurrent with M-50. Its southern end is at an interchange in a rural section of Summit Township. From exit34 on US127, the business loop runs north and northwesterly, crossing the Grand River. North of the river, the roadway is bounded by businesses as it runs along Cooper Street through residential areas on the southeastern side of Jackson. In the downtown area, Bus. US127/M-50 merges with Business Loop Interstate94 (BL I-94) and splits to follow a one-way pairing of streets that form a loop through downtown. Northbound traffic continues along the eastern <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> loop on Cooper Street and crosses the Grand River again. At the intersection with Michigan Avenue, BL I-94/Bus. US127/M-50 turns westward onto Louis Glick Highway around the northern side of downtown. The business loop crosses the Grand River a third and final time along Louis Glick. On {{the western side of}} downtown, the business loop angles southwesterly as Louis Glick Highway merges into Michigan Avenue. (At the same time, the southern half of the one-way loop, Washington Street, also splits from Michigan Avenue.) BL I-94/Bus. US127/M-50 follows Michigan Avenue westward through residential neighborhoods to an intersection with West Avenue, where Bus. US127/M-50 turns northward, separating from BL I-94 (Michigan Avenue). As the business loop approaches its parent highway, it transitions into a commercial area. The northern terminus of Bus. US127 is at the same interchange northwest of Jackson in Blackman Township where the US127 and I-94 freeways merge.|$|E
