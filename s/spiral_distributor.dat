In reduction of iron ore in fluidized bed, ore particles do not sinter on distributor and perhaps clog it or otherwise interfere with gas flow. Distributor also relatively cool. In fluidized-bed production of silicon, inflowing silane does not decompose until within bed of hot silicon particles and deposits on them.

40|$|In this work, three {{matching}} modes (relative positions, catholyte flow sequences, {{and flow}} regimes) of bioelectrochemical module and anaerobic sludge were evaluated and optimized for azo dye {{treatment in the}} integrated system with embedding modular bioelectrochemical system into anaerobic sludge reactor. Results showed that it was favorable to operate this integrated system under the condition of 1 / 4 cathode soaking into sludge with <b>spiral</b> <b>distributor</b> in down-flow direction. Current, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and pH clearly demonstrated {{the important role of}} 1 / 4 soaking in electron/proton transfer. The down-flow direction flowed through electrode zone and then sludge zone could benefit to the efficient use of cathode and improve AO 7 treatment. Furthermore, the positive effect of spiral catholyte distributor might be due to its promoting role in mixing and creating a spiral flow channel around the cathode electrode-microbes-solution interface. These results exhibited great potential for matching modular bioelectrochemical system with anaerobic treatment process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Burning of {{rice husk}} in a {{swirling}} fluidized-bed combustor (SFBC) {{was the focus}} of this experimental study. Swirl motion of a fluidized bed in this combustor was induced by an annular <b>spiral</b> <b>distributor</b> of primary air and also promoted by tangential injection of secondary air into the bed splash zone. "As-received" rice husk was moisturized with the aim to control NO emission from the combustor. The SFBC was tested at a constant fuel feed rate (of about 80 Â kg/h) for six fuel-moisture contents (from 8. 4 % to 35 %). In each test series for the particular fuel quality, excess air was ranged from about 20 % to 80 %. Radial and axial profiles of temperature and gas concentrations (O 2, CO and NO) were plotted for different fuel options and operating conditions with the aim to study pollutants formation and reduction in different regions of the SFBC. With increasing the fuel-moisture content, the emission of NO from the combustor apparently reduced, while the emission of CO was adjusted at a quite low level due to the effects of secondary air. An effective least-cost control of both NO and CO emissions and high (over 99 %) combustion efficiency are achievable when firing moisturized rice husk in this SFBC.

40|$|The present work {{compares the}} CFX and OpenFOAM CFD codes {{with respect to}} the {{prediction}} of the flow in the U 9 Kaplan turbine <b>spiral</b> casing, <b>distributor</b> and draft tube.

40|$|CFD {{has played}} a {{significant}} role to investigate the performance and improve the design of hydraulic turbines; however, the improvement of CFD method demands powerful computer resources including time, CPU, memory, and commercial licenses. In present work, both global and local parameters of a high head Francis turbine were studied using several geometrical and interface modelling approaches. The aim of the work is to find suitable strategy for designers to simulate the hydraulic turbines to balance the numerical accuracy and the requirement of computational resources. The geometrical modelling approaches include combinations of turbine components such as, <b>spiral</b> casing, <b>distributor,</b> runner and draft tube.

40|$|Abstract: An {{innovative}} technology that has potential {{to contribute to}} renewable energy development with reduced impacts on downstream fish passage is the Alden turbine, originally developed by the U. S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) more recently enhanced by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). This turbine is designed to allow the safe passage of fish through the turbine {{eliminating the need for}} expensive screens and bypasses and loss of generation via spillage for fish passage. The turbine features a helical-shaped runner with only three blades. Pilot-scale tests demonstrated that fish survival, when scaled to a full-size field installation, would be in excess of 98 % for many fish species. EPRI, with DOE support, funded Alden and Voith Hydro to enhance the turbine’s conceptual design performance through modification of the hydraulic passageways, including the <b>spiral</b> case, <b>distributor,</b> runner and draft tube. The final stage of the Alden turbine design effort included a model test at Voith Hydro’s hydraulic laboratory in York, PA, in addition to the updated mechanical and balance of plant equipment sizing necessary for an actual field installation. Model testing indicated a maximum calculated prototype efficiency of almost 94 % at conditions corresponding to a prototype net head and flow of 92. 0 ft and 1, 504 cfs, respectively. The next stage in developing the Alden turbine is a field demonstration project. While EPRI had two field demonstration projects in development, both have been cancelled because of economic reasons unrelated t the cost of the turbine. EPRI is now actively seeking a new demonstration site. The conference presentation will review the detailed results of the mechanical, hydraulic and efficiency performance of the model Alden turbine and its predicted field performance and relative cost compared to conventional Kaplan and Francis turbine designs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} the 3 D numerical simulation of unsteady turbulent {{flow in the}} entire flow passage of a water turbine model with CFD technology. A new and available method {{for the design of}} a Francis turbine has been explored. The boundary conditions have been implemented based on the 3 D averaged N-S equations. The governing equations are discreted on space by the finite volume method and on time step by the finite difference method. The 3 D unsteady turbulent flow in an entire Francis turbine model is calculated successfully using the CFX-TASCflow software and RNG k-εturbulence model. Transient flow fields are simulated in the <b>spiral</b> case, the <b>distributor,</b> the runner and the draft tube. It is presented in this paper that the computer simulation of the flow fields in components of the Francis turbine at the optimum operating condition. Meanwhile, the velocity and pressure at any points in the flow fields can be obtained so as to provide the great value on the performance prediction. According to the simulating results, the flow analysis and the design experience, the design of components in a Francis turbine model can be improved and optimized. In this way, designers may decrease numbers of test and shorten the period for a model. Therefore, the cost of research and produce can be reduced...|$|R
40|$|The Alden turbine was {{developed}} through the U. S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) former Advanced Hydro Turbine Systems Program (1994 - 2006) and, more recently, through the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the DOE's Wind & Water Power Program. The {{primary goal of}} the engineering study described here {{was to provide a}} commercially competitive turbine design that would yield fish passage survival rates comparable to or better than the survival rates of bypassing or spilling flow. Although the turbine design was performed for site conditions corresponding to 92 ft (28 m) net head and a discharge of 1500 cfs (42. 5 cms), the design can be modified for additional sites with differing operating conditions. During the turbine development, design modifications were identified for the <b>spiral</b> case, <b>distributor</b> (stay vanes and wicket gates), runner, and draft tube to improve turbine performance while maintaining features for high fish passage survival. Computational results for pressure change rates and shear within the runner passage were similar in the original and final turbine geometries, while predicted minimum pressures were higher for the final turbine. The final turbine geometry and resulting flow environments are expected to further enhance the fish passage characteristics of the turbine. Computational results for the final design were shown to improve turbine efficiencies by over 6 % at the selected operating condition when compared to the original concept. Prior to the release of the hydraulic components for model fabrication, finite element analysis calculations were conducted for the stay vanes, wicket gates, and runner to verify that structural design criteria for stress and deflections were met. A physical model of the turbine was manufactured and tested with data collected for power and efficiency, cavitation limits, runaway speed, axial and radial thrust, pressure pulsations, and wicket gate torque. All parameters were observed to fall within ranges expected for conventional radial flow machines. Based on these measurements, the expected efficiency peak for prototype application is 93. 64 %. These data were used in the final sizing of the supporting mechanical and balance of plant equipment. The preliminary equipment cost for the design specification is $ 1450 /kW with a total supply schedule of 28 months. This equipment supply includes turbine, generator, unit controls, limited balance of plant equipment, field installation, and commissioning. Based on the selected head and flow design conditions, fish passage survival through the final turbine is estimated to be approximately 98 % for 7. 9 -inch (200 -mm) fish, and the predicted survival reaches 100 % for fish 3. 9 inches (100 mm) and less in length. Note that fish up to 7. 9 - inches (200 mm) in length make up more than 90 % of fish entrained at hydro projects in the United States. Completion of these efforts provides a mechanical and electrical design that can be readily adapted to site-specific conditions with additional engineering development comparable to costs associated with conventional turbine designs...|$|R
40|$|Hydropower is a {{versatile}} renewable {{source of power}} generation able to change rapidly operating conditions. Hydropower plants may today work over a larger operating range than designed for due {{to the introduction of}} renewable sources of energy and the deregulation of the electricity market. Such operating conditions may involve large stresses and losses due to complex unsteady and transient flow phenomena, which have {{to be taken into account}} under design or refurbishment phase. The use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in the design and refurbishment process is becoming increasingly popular due to its flexibility, detailed flow description and cost-effectiveness comparing to model testing used since a century in the development of turbines. However, issues have still to be resolved due to the combined flow physics involved in hydropower machines such as partly separated flow at curved surfaces, vortices, unsteadiness, swirl flow, strong adverse pressure gradients, convoluted geometry as well as numerical artefacts. Therefore, experimental data in such complicated systems are required to validate numerical simulations and develop more accurate models. The first part of this thesis is a numerical investigation of the three-dimensional flow of the axial Hölleforsen model <b>spiral</b> casing and <b>distributor,</b> where the influence of the penstock on the flow is analysed using different turbulence models and inlet boundary conditions. Comparisons with experimental results indicate the importance of the penstock to perform accurate simulation in the present case. Therefore, detailed inlet boundary conditions are necessary to simulate accurately the spiral casing flows if the penstock is not included in the simulation. The second part of the thesis focuses on an experimental investigation of an axial hydropower turbine model known as Porjus U 9. The measurements are part of a project aiming to investigate experimentally the flow in different regions of the machine to build a data bank in order to validate numerical simulations and study scale-up efficiency between model and prototype, since the corresponding prototype is available for similar experiments. The investigation was performed at 3 different working points: part load, best efficiency point and high load. The inlet flow of the spiral casing as well as some sections in the spiral casing and draft tube are investigated with a two components laser Doppler anemometer (LDA). To improve the signal quality and measurement accuracy refractive index matching optical box was mounted on the circular pipe of the spiral casing inlet. LDA result of the mean velocities and corresponding RMS are presented to investigate the flow before the runner and at the inlet of the spiral casing, since the flow is influenced by the existence of a bend before the inlet. The results of the draft tube measurements are also presented. Good quality data are obtained for initial boundary conditions at the inlet of the casing and drafttube cone to perform numerical simulations.
