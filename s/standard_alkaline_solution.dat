2500|$|The major {{acids in}} wine are tartaric and malic acid with citric and succinic acids playing a small role. The titratable acidity or [...] "TA" [...] (also {{referred}} to as [...] "total acidity") is {{the measure of the}} tartaric acid in the grapes. This is the most abundant acid and also the one acid that has the most pronounced and long lasting impact on the taste of the wine. The TA is often measured by neutralizing some grape juice with a <b>standard</b> <b>alkaline</b> <b>solution</b> (such as sodium hydroxide) and then using an indicator (such as phenolphthalein) which changes color depending on the acid levels of the solution. The indicator is added to the grape juice followed by incremental amounts of the alkaline solution as the wine changes color until adding more of the solution ceases to promote a color change. At this point the wine has been neutralized with the amount of the alkaline solution needed to neutralize calculated in a formula to give an indication of how much tartaric acid was in the wine. The TA level is then expressed in a percentage of grams per 100 milliliter. As with must weight, the ideal levels for ripeness will vary according to wine style and winemaking preference. For still table wines, TA levels often fall between 0.60-0.80% for red wine grapes and 0.65-0.85 for whites.|$|E

40|$|A spectroscopic {{technique}} for determining AQ in pulping liquor {{was developed to}} effectively separate AQ from dissolved lignin. This technique {{is based on a}} flow analysis system with a Nafion membrane interface. The AQ passed through the membrane is converted into its reduced form, AHQ, using sodium hydrosulfite. AHQ has distinguished absorption characteristics in the visible range, whereas spectral contribution from the small lignin molecules that penetrate through the membrane is insignificant. It was found that AQ can be dissolved in dissolved lignin-enriched <b>alkaline</b> <b>solutions,</b> which makes calibration of AQ using <b>standard</b> aqueous <b>alkaline</b> AQ <b>solutions</b> possible. The solubility of AQ in a lignin-enriched solution is approximately 0. 14 g/L at 90 oC.

40|$|SUMMARY: Treatment of {{the cells}} of various Bacillus spp. with an {{alkaline}} solutbn of sodium hypochlorite resulted in dissolution {{of the cells}} and liberation of the in-tracellular lipid inclusion bodies. Analyses of the isolated and purified inclusions of Bacillus cereus grown {{under a variety of}} cultural conditions showed them to con-tain about 89 yo poly-P-hydroxybutyrate and 11 yo ether-soluble lipid. Parallel esti-mations of the poly-P-hydroxybutyrate content of intact organisms by Lemoigne’s chloroform extraction method showed that all of it was present in the lipid inclusions. These observations form the basis of a simple and rapid method of estimating the poly-/ 3 -hydroxybutyrate content of Bacillus spp. It consists essentially of digesting a washed bacterial suspension with a <b>standard</b> <b>alkaline</b> hypochlorite <b>solution</b> under <b>standard</b> conditions and measuring the residual turbidity. The intracellular lipid inclusions which form such a prominent feature of the large-celled species of BaciEZw have been little studied. Their avidity for 03 -soluble dyes such as Sudan Black clearly indicates their content of ‘fatty’ substances, but little is known of the nature of these or other materials tha...|$|R
40|$|A straightforward, {{high-throughput}} {{method was}} developed and fully validated for the simultaneous determination of the specific tobacco biomarkers nicotine and its main metabolite cotinine in a wide dynamic range and supporting the most common human biological matrices (urine, oral fluid and hair). Sample preparation was performed inside the very HPLC injection vials by pipetting 0. 5 mL of the liquid samples, deuterated internal <b>standards</b> in <b>alkaline</b> <b>solution</b> and dichloromethane as extraction solvent. Solid samples (i. e. around 10 mg hair) were first submitted to alkaline digestion in the HPLC vials and processed accordingly. The organic phase (reached through the upper aqueous layer) was directly injected without further treatment. Instrumental analysis was performed using hydrophilic interaction (HILIC) ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). Total chromatographic time was 2 min. The method covers a wide dynamic range making it fit-for-purpose {{for the analysis of}} samples covering entire populations, irrespective of the level of exposure or tobacco use. Calibration curves (r (2) [*]>[*] 0. 995) covered the range 1 - 2000 ng/mL (or 0. 05 - 100 ng/mg hair) for nicotine and 0. 1 - 2000 ng/mL (or 0. 005 - 100 ng/mg hair) for cotinine. Within-run and between-run precision and accuracy were typically below 10 %, and always below 20 % at the lower limit of quantification. The method was successfully applied to the analysis of samples from different projects involving multiple matrices. The study was funded by Instituto de Salud Carlos III-FEDER, Government of Spain (grant PI 081339 and PI 081436) [25, 31 – 33] and the Spain’s National Committee on Smoking Prevention (grant CNPT 0701) [34]...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) of cocoa pods following treatment of immersing the cocoa pods into different <b>alkaline</b> <b>solution</b> at different length of immersion time. The experiment was carried out in a 5 x 3 factorial arrangement according to completely randomized design. The replication for each treatment combination was three giving the total number of experimental units was 45. The first factor was different <b>alkaline</b> <b>solutions,</b> namely P 1 : water, P 2 : rice husk ash solution 10 %, P 3 : coconut shell ash solution 10 %, P 4 : cocoa pod ash solution 10 % and P 5 : NaOH 6 %.

40|$|Abstract- Annatto is {{a natural}} {{colouring}} agent obtained from the outer coats of {{the seeds of the}} tropical shrub Bixa orellana. The major colour principles of annatto are the carotenoids bixin. Annatto seeds were collected from the local market and it was ground by mortar and pestle. The ground annatto was taken in a steam distillation and evaporated. After the evaporation the sample was dried and ground. The ground annatto seeds are steam distilled in order to remove the odor. It is possible to remove upto 6. 42 % of the volatile substances from the annatto. Then different solvents were put on trial and error basis to get the optimum extract of bixin color.
