40|$|Motivation: In this article, we {{show that}} the {{classification}} of human precursor microRNA (pre-miRNAs) hairpins from both genome pseudo hairpins and other non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) is a common and essential requirement for both comparative and non-comparative computational recognition of human miRNA genes. However, the existing computational methods do not address this issue completely or successfully. Here we present {{the development of an}} effective classifier system (named as microPred) for this classification problem by using appropriate machine learning techniques. Our approach includes the introduction of more representative datasets, extraction of new biologically relevant features, feature <b>selection,</b> <b>handling</b> of class imbalance problem in the datasets and extensive classifier performance evaluation via systematic cross-validation methods. Results: Our microPred classifier yielded higher and, especially, much more reliable classification results in terms of both sensitivity (90. 02 %) and specificity (97. 28 %) than the exiting pre-miRNA classification methods. When validated with 6095 non-human animal pre-miRNAs and 139 virus pre-miRNAs from miRBase, microPred resulted in 92. 71 % (5651 / 6095) and 94. 24 % (131 / 139) recognition rates, respectively.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to determine palaeotemperatures (mean annual surface temperatures) based on measurements of the liquid–vapour homogenisation temperature of fluid inclusions in stalagmites. The aim {{of this study is to}} explore the potential and the limitations of this new palaeothermometer and to develop a reliable methodology for routine applications in palaeoclimate research. Therefore, we have investigated recent fluid inclusions from the top part of actively growing stalagmites that have formed at temperatures close to the present-day cave air temperature. A precondition for measuring homogenisation temperatures of originally monophase inclusions is the nucleation of a vapour bubble by means of single ultra-short laser pulses. Based on the observed homogenisation temperatures (Th(obs)) and measurements of the vapour bubble diameter at a known temperature, we calculated stalagmite formation temperatures (Tf) by applying a thermodynamic model that takes into account the effect of surface tension on liquid–vapour homogenisation. Results from recent stalagmite samples demonstrate that calculated stalagmite formation temperatures match the present-day cave air temperature within ± 0. 2 °C. To avoid artificially induced changes of the fluid density we defined specific demands on the <b>selection,</b> <b>handling</b> and preparation of the stalagmite samples. Application of the method is restricted to stalagmites that formed at cave temperatures greater than 9 – 11 °C...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, I demónstrate how the {{analysis}} of the language of poetic selections could be the basis for TEFL lessons. To illustrate, I use sample selec-tions from the poetry of two Lebanese-American poets namely Ameen Rihani's The Chant of Mystics and Gibran Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet. Nowadays, more arguments support the relevance of using literature to the teaching of a foreign language, and discuss the usefulness of the linguis-tic analysis of literature for pedagogical purposes. The New National Curriculum of Education put into effect in Lebanon beginning academic year 1998 - 1999 differs radically from the oíd one in methodology, approach, and distribution of cycles. The new curriculum adopts the content-based approach, which allows for the possibility of using literary texts as one source of content. My major focus in this paper is on the use of poetry in the secondary cycle of the Lebanese English curriculum. The poet-ic <b>selections</b> <b>handled</b> are rich in their vocabulary and structures, which allows for a variety of activities. Whether we are teaching a foreign language or even a native one, literature is a highly recommended vehicle for a number of rea-sons. In such cases, focus on the language pavés the way for a meaningful and rewarding literary appreciation...|$|R
40|$|Background: Horizontal gene {{transfer}} (HGT) {{is one of}} the major mechanisms contributing to microbial genome diversification. A number of computational methods for finding horizontally transferred genes have been proposed in the past decades; however none of them has provided a reliable detector yet. In existing parametric approaches, only one single compositional property can participate in the detection process, or the results obtained through each single property are just simply combined. It’s known that different properties may mean different information, so the single property can’t sufficiently contain the information encoded by gene sequences. In addition, the class imbalance problem in the datasets, which also results in great errors for the gene detection, hasn’t been considered by the published methods. Here we developed an effective classifier system (Hgtident) that used support vector machine (SVM) by combining unusual properties effectively for HGT detection. Results: Our approach Hgtident includes the introduction of more representative datasets, optimization of SVM model, feature <b>selection,</b> <b>handling</b> of imbalance problem in the datasets and extensive performance evaluation via systematic cross-validation methods. Through feature selection, we found that JS-DN and JS-CB have higher discriminating power for HGT detection, while GC 1 –GC 3 and k-mer (k = 1, 2, …, 7) make the least contribution. Extensive experiments indicated the new classifier could reduce Mean error dramatically, and also improve Recall by a certain level. For the testing genomes...|$|R
40|$|The main {{scientific}} {{characteristic of}} VIMOS (VIsible Multi Object Spectrograph, {{to be placed}} on ESO Very Large Telescope) is its high multiplexing capability, allowing astronomers to obtain up to 800 spectra per exposure. To fully exploit such a potential a dedicated tool, the VIMOS Mask Preparation Software (MPS), has been designed. The MPS provides the astronomer with tools for the selection of the objects to be spectroscopically observed, including interactive object <b>selection,</b> <b>handling</b> of curved slits, and an algorithm for automatic slit positioning that derives the most effective solution in terms of number of object selected per field. The slit positioning algorithm must take into account both the initial list of user's preferred objects, and the constraints imposed either by the instrument characteristics or by the requirement of having easily reduceable data. The number of possible slit combinations in a field is in any case very high (10 ^ 73), and the task of slits maximization cannot be solved through a purely combinational approach. We have introduced an innovative approach, based on the analysis of the function (Number of slits) /(slit length) vs. (slit length). The algorithm has been fully tested with good results, and it will be distributed to the astronomical community for the observation preparation phase.
