It led reservations to be voiced, and not only in Asia, about full and unfettered international capital mobility and about the policy priorities of the International Monetary Fund. This paper discusses the policy challenges posed by the Asian crisis. It starts in Section 1 by reconsidering the controversy over capital mobility. Even before the crisis struck, the IMF was on record as favoring the liberalization of capital flows and had proposed amending its Articles of Agreement to make the promotion of capital account liberalization a purpose of the Fund and to give it jurisdiction over restrictions on capital movements. In the wake of a crisis characterized by volatile financial flows and contagious currency crises, capital mobility is increasingly seen as a mixed blessing. There is a feeling, especially in Asia, that amending the Articles giving the Fund jurisdiction over capital account restrictions would be a bridge too far. The first part of the paper therefore seeks to reconcile the fundamental case for international capital mobility with Asia’s less-than-heartening recen...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The prone {{position}} has been considered the only position for percutaneous access to the kidney for the past 25 years, whereas the supine Valdivia position has recently started to gain acceptance, although it was originally described in the late 1980 <b>s.</b> <b>Even</b> <b>more</b> recently, the Galdakao-modified supine Valdivia position was described. However, {{there is no consensus}} on which is the best position for percutaneous nephrolithotomy, and the choice is currently based on the surgeon's preference. Materials and Methods: The prone, supine, and modified supine positions are described, pointing out the advantages, disadvantages, and results of each technique. Results: A number of potential advantages have been described for the supine over the {{prone position}}: less cardiovascular change; no need for patient repositioning (with less associated risk of central and peripheral nervous system injury); less X-ray exposure to the surgeon; and less risk of colonic injury. The recently described Galdakao-modified supine Valdivia position allows for a simultaneous anterograde and retrograde approach to the renal cavities for the one-stage treatment of complex renal stones or concurrent renal and ureteral calculi. Moreover, the use of a flexible ureteroscope allows for Endovision puncture to achieve perfect access to the kidney. Conclusions: The prone position still represents the standard for percutaneous access to the kidney, and other positions should be compared with this position. However, the supine and the modified supine positions have potentially important advantages for both patients and surgeons that need to be investigated in a large randomised trial to define their superiority over the traditional prone position...|$|E
40|$|Interest in the {{characterization}} {{and assessment of}} de-cisional capacity in medicine began to develop in the mid- 1970 s, {{in the wake of}} the near-universal en-dorsement of the legal doctrine of informed consent earlier in the decade. 1, 2 Early commentaries recog-nized the importance of identifying generally ac-cepted criteria for decisional capacity as a prerequi-site to valid assessment, and for a number of years this was the focus of most scholarly attention. 2 – 4 By the end of the 1980 s, however, a rough consensus had evolved regarding those functions essential for deci-sional capacity: the abilities to understand the rele-vant information, appreciate its implications for one’s own situation, rationally manipulate the infor-mation (often referred to as reasoning), and express a choice. 5 This conceptualization was applied to ca-pacity for treatment- and research-related decisions, and it is likely to be applicable to other kinds of decisional capacity as well. 6 Assessment of capacity, a task often assigned to psychiatrists, had meanwhile evolved in an unsys-tematized fashion, with attending physicians often passing on their idiosyncratic approaches to a new generation of residents. To no one’s surprise, studies suggested poor interrater agreement among physi-cians for these determinations. 7 Efforts to carry out capacity assessments for research purposes were sim-ilarly handicapped by the absence of a standardized approach. Each research team developed its own in-struments, often based on idiosyncratic criteria, making comparisons across studies all but impossible and often leaving readers uncertain how much valid-ity to accord to the methods used and the results reported. The largest study to date of decisional capacity, which focused on consent to treatment by patients with psychiatric and medical disorders, is the MacArthur Competence Assessment Study, which Thomas Grisso and I conducted in the early 1990 <b>s.</b> <b>Even</b> <b>more</b> important than any of the substantive findings of the study, reported in a series of papers in the mid- 1990 s, 8 – 12 were its major spin-offs: th...|$|E

This recent trend has been emphasized greatly by the managed-care movement. While adult facilities have been the focus of many research studies, literature related to treatment programs for adolescents and children has been much more limited. Outcome studies and program evaluations provide information about the efficacy of treatment, which in addition to demonstrating cost-effectiveness to third party payers, allows for treatment to be improved as well. ^ This project was completed at the Youth Opportunity Center, Inc. (YOC) in Muncie, Indiana. The primary focus was the development of a treatment program for a new secure unit. The TASC Unit (Treatment of Adolescents in Secure Care) was built as an addition to the existing YOC residential treatment center for children and adolescents. Procedures for how the treatment program was developed and results of the final program are presented. Strengths and limitations of how this was completed are discussed as well as suggestions for how future projects can be improved. The treatment program designed in this project is currently being used in the 28 -bed TASC Unit, which opened in August 1999. ^ The second part of this project involved creating a plan for studying outcomes for the new unit. There was no data collection or implementation of any study, as the goal of this part of the project was simply to present a plan for a recommended outcome study. Suggestions included tracking more specific information about residents 2 ̆ 7 treatment history, extent of family involvement in the treatment program, and assessment of behavioral changes in residents. The purpose of creating a plan for studying outcomes was to assist YOC in planning for evaluating the effectiveness of the program and to analyze what program components may need to be improved. ...|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves laaves 71 - 83. Just a {{year after}} the invention of the LASER in 1960, it was demonstrated that lasers could be used for the treatment of certain skin abnormalities. At present, lasers are extensively used in a broad range of medical treatments. After the development of femtosecond pulse lasers in the 1980 <b>s,</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> exciting possibilities in a diverse range of fields have been realized. Accordingly, ultrashort pulse lasers are widely used in biological applications in recent years. In parallel to these, fiber laser systems have increasingly been utilized {{in a wide range of}} scientific and biomedical applications, since they are highly compatible systems for being employed for industrial and biomedical applications. Consequently, the aim of this Ph. D. thesis proposal is to develop compact, simpler to operate, and cost-efficient ultrafast fiber lasers with different repetition rates and pulse energies. By using such systems, we demonstrate the biophotonic applications of these lasers on two different biological research fields. As a part of this thesis study, we develop ultrafast fiber lasers and apply them in biomaterial surface modification. We demonstrate that different surfaces with micro- and nano-scale topographies can be generated at high speed, precision and repeatability. The outcomes of biomaterial surface modification with different laser parameters are compared in terms of topographical uniformity and repeatability. Additionally, a variety of topographical modifications are assessed with respect to the efficiency on cell attachment and proliferation on metal implants. As the second part of this thesis, we develop a custom-built ultrafast fiber laser-integrated microscope system for nanosurgery and tissue ablation experiments. Subsequently, we employ this system in order to make high-precision cuts onto different biological specimens ranging from the tissue level to subcellular level, such as a part of an axon or a single organelle. Finally, we improve this integrated system in a way that it becomes capable of generating optical pulses in any desired sequence possible. This is achieved by using acousto-optic modulators (AOM) and custom-developed field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA). Erdoğan, MutluPh. D...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how the American counterinsurgency effort is developing in three provinces of northeastern Afghanistan: Kunar, Nangarhar and Nuristan. Also, it examines what {{features of the}} relationship between Pakistan and the United States that are affecting the counterinsurgency effort there. The focus is not only on internal issues within the provinces but also on whether and how external issues, mainly security issues originating from Pakistan’s border areas, are compounding difficulties to the current counterinsurgency effort in these provinces. Both the military as well as the civilian aspects of the counterinsurgency effort are subject to analysis. The analysis of the military aspects of the effort focuses primarily on problems related to civilian casualties and the location of firefights. The analysis of what can be considered the more civilian aspects focuses mainly on three issues: The engagement of the civilian population in reporting on so-called “improvised explosive devices” (IED), the use of insurgent courts vs. the use of government courts to solve local disputes, and the safety of Afghan government officials in the provinces. Having to deal closely with culture is one of the features of counterinsurgency that differentiates it from other types of military campaigns. Among other things, the analyses of the cultural aspects show the importance of making the civilian population that supports the insurgents “see” that the government is a better alternative than the insurgents. In Afghanistan, the counterinsurgents’ ability to produce visible and viable results, whether those are well-building programs or large governmental programs, {{is at the core of}} making the population that supports the insurgents “see” why the government should be supported. To be able to achieve this mission, the counterinsurgents, which in the case of Afghanistan are outsiders, must be aware of the “human terrain” that they operate within. Finally, the thesis finds that there are a number of interrelated aspects {{of the relationship between}} the U. S. and Pakistan that affect the counterinsurgency efforts in Afghanistan, both directly and indirectly. It seems clear that not only the military, but also the economic support from U. S. to Pakistan, is of indirect importance. There are strong indications that the economic problems facing Pakistan create the soil for recruiting youth to extremist groups. Recruitment to these groups will also have consequences for the operations in Afghanistan, in particular in the eastern provinces that border Pakistan, and where the insurgents operate on both sides. Pakistan’s use of proxy groups, which also operate on both sides of the border, affects the counterinsurgency operations both directly and indirectly, because the U. S. considers the use of proxy groups as a sign of the Pakistani government’s lack of ability or even will to exert political control in their own country. On the other hand, the effect of drone strikes in Pakistan, specifically in the eastern provinces, seems to be that the U. S. undermines its own credibility in the operations in Afghanistan. In short, the instability in the relations between the U. S. and Pakistan seems to contribute to maintaining the political instability within Pakistan, which in turn makes the U. <b>S.</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> reluctant to give military and economic support to Pakistan. This somewhat vicious circle may very well increase the strength of the insurgent groups that have safe havens in Pakistan, and thus worsen the conditions for the counterinsurgency operations in eastern Afghanistan...|$|E

40|$|More than 60 {{million people}} in the world have been {{diagnosed}} with HIV infections since the virus was recognized as the causative agent of AIDS in the 1980 <b>s.</b> <b>Even</b> though <b>more</b> than half of the infected patients have died, effective disease treatment and prevention measures have not been established. ART (antiretroviral therapy) is the only proven HIV treatment that sustains the suppression of patient viraemia. Current routine approaches to treat HIV infections are targeted at developing vaccines that will induce humoral or cell memory immune responses. However, developing an effective vaccine has been challenging because the HIV mutates rapidly, which allows the virus to evade immune surveillances established against the previous strain. In addition, the virus is able to quickly establish a reservoir and treatment is difficult because of the general lack of knowledge about HIV immune response mechanisms. This review introduces common disease symptoms and the progression of HIV infection with a brief summary of the current treatment approaches. Different cellular immune responses against HIV are also discussed, with emphasis on a nanotechnology research that has focused on probing T-cell response to HIV infection. Furthermore, we discuss recent noteworthy nanotechnology updates on T-cell response screening that is focused on HIV infection. Finally, we review potential future treatment strategies based on the correlations between T-cell response and HIV infection...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: From the 1880 s {{until the}} 1970 s, photomechanical {{techniques}} {{played an important}} role in map making. Images created by and for photography were manipulated to form the printing image(s) from which the map was reproduced in multiple copies. After experiments in mapmaking in the 1860 s, photomechanical techniques gained acceptance by the 1880 s and, thereafter, increasingly dominated mapmaking until their rapid decline after the 1970 s, as the shift to computers and electronic technology occurred. When they replaced earlier manual methods in the nineteenth century, photomechanical techniques caused the tools and materials of map production and the roles of personnel to change. Control over image production shifted from the printer to the cartographer as pen-and-ink drafting and associated collage techniques developed in the early 1900 <b>s,</b> and <b>even</b> <b>more</b> so when scribing came into general use in the 1960 s. Having thus assumed more direct responsibility for the end product (the printed map), the cartographer also adopted methods of predicting and controlling its appearance, such as standardized tools and materials, drafting specifications, flow charting, and color proofing. Through the faster and cheaper production of maps whose graphic presentation of information was enhanced by tonal effects and color printing, photomechanical production techniques also contributed to the growth of the map trade and of map use during the twentieth century...|$|R
40|$|The {{share of}} U. S. {{multinational}} firms in world exports of manufactures has remained almost constant at about 17 per cent {{for the last}} 20 years while that of the U. S. as a country has declined substantially. The composition of world manufactured exports shifted toward high-technology or R&D-intensive products during these years and away from low-technology products. The comparative advantage of the U. <b>S.,</b> and <b>even</b> <b>more</b> that of U. S. multinationals, were in high-tech products throughout the period, as was that of Japan. However, the U. S. and its multinationals shifted even further toward such products during the period than did {{the world as a}} whole, and the Asian NIC's exports moved still faster in this direction. With respect to short-run fluctuations, we find that the export shares of U. S. multinationals have been less sensitive to exchange rate fluctuations than those of the U. S. And shares in high-tech exports have been less sensitive than those in low-tech exports. High R&D intensity was a factor raising the competitiveness of U. S. industries and particularly that of U. S. multinationals in those industries. High advertising intensity raised the competitiveness of U. S multinationals but not usually that of their industries. Higher growth in R&D-intensity also led to increase in multinationals' shares of world exports between 1977 and 1982. ...|$|R
