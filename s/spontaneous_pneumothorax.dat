5|$|Spontaneous pneumothoraces {{are divided}} into two types: primary, which occurs {{in the absence of}} known lung disease, and secondary, which occurs in someone with {{underlying}} lung disease. The cause of primary <b>spontaneous</b> <b>pneumothorax</b> is unknown, but established risk factors include male sex, smoking, and a family history of pneumothorax. Smoking either cannabis or tobacco increases the risk. The various suspected underlying mechanisms are discussed below.|$|E
5|$|A primary <b>spontaneous</b> <b>pneumothorax</b> (PSP) {{tends to}} occur in a young adult without {{underlying}} lung problems, and usually causes limited symptoms. Chest pain and sometimes mild breathlessness are the usual predominant presenting features. People who are affected by PSPs are often unaware of potential danger and may wait several days before seeking medical attention. PSPs more commonly occur during changes in atmospheric pressure, explaining to some extent why episodes of pneumothorax may happen in clusters. It is rare for PSPs to cause tension pneumothoraces.|$|E
5|$|If {{pneumothorax}} {{occurs in}} a smoker, this is considered an opportunity to emphasize the markedly increased risk of recurrence in those who continue to smoke, and the many benefits of smoking cessation. It may be advisable for someone to remain off work {{for up to a}} week after a <b>spontaneous</b> <b>pneumothorax.</b> If the person normally performs heavy manual labor, several weeks may be required. Those who have undergone pleurodesis may need two to three weeks off work to recover.|$|E
30|$|Introduction: The catamenial pneumotorax is {{an entity}} of <b>spontaneous,</b> {{recurring}} <b>pneumothorax</b> in women. The relationship with menstruation bleeding defines the catamenial character. It {{has been associated}} with thoracic endometriosis. Nearly half of the patients with thoracic endometriosis have pelvic endometriosis too.|$|R
40|$|A 53 -year-old woman {{presented}} with a <b>spontaneous</b> right-sided <b>pneumothorax.</b> Computed tomography chest scan demonstrated a large bulla involving the right middle lobe. Recurrence of the pneumothorax after initial closed chest tube drainage necessitated thoracotomy and wedge resection. Histopathological examination revealed features consistent with a benign mesenchymal cystic hamartoma. Pneumothorax is a recognized complication of mesenchymal cystic hamartoma, a lesion that also has malignant potential...|$|R
30|$|The {{most common}} {{complication}} with TTB is pneumothorax, which occurs in 0 – 61  % of lung biopsies. Although rare, other complications include pulmonary haemorrhage, haemothorax, gas embolism and cardiorespiratory arrest [16, 20]. In the case series of PPFE, the published patients were submitted to {{surgical lung biopsy}} [1 – 12] with a reported death of one patient following surgical lung biopsy complicated by large bronchopleural fistulae [11]. Becker et al. also postulated that these patients might be prone {{to the development of}} secondary <b>spontaneous</b> <b>pneumothoraxes</b> [11]. In our study the diagnosis of PPFE was made by TTB in all patients. Although all patients had pneumothoraxes, they resolved before discharge with only one patient needing hospitalisation for more than 1  week. This patient needed two biopsies, was the first diagnosed at our institution and had the worst prognosis, dying 20  months after diagnosis. Therefore, TTB can be considered the first choice for the invasive assessment of PPFE, sparing patients a late surgical lung biopsy. However, we only had four patients, and more reports are needed to improve the reliability.|$|R
5|$|In {{secondary}} <b>spontaneous</b> <b>pneumothorax,</b> {{the estimated}} annual AAIR is 6.3 and 2.0 cases per 100,000 person-years {{for males and}} females, respectively, with the risk of recurrence depending on the presence and severity of any underlying lung disease. Once a second episode has occurred, {{there is a high}} likelihood of subsequent further episodes. The incidence in children has not been well studied, but is estimated to be between 5 and 10 cases per 100,000 person-years.|$|E
5|$|Pneumothorax was {{described}} in 1803 by Jean Marc Gaspard Itard, a student of René Laennec, who provided an extensive description of the clinical picture in 1819. While Itard and Laennec recognized that some cases were not due to tuberculosis (then the most common cause), the concept of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>pneumothorax</b> {{in the absence of}} tuberculosis (primary pneumothorax) was reintroduced by the Danish physician Hans Kjærgaard in 1932. In 1941, the surgeons Tyson and Crandall introduced pleural abrasion for the treatment of pneumothorax.|$|E
5|$|A small <b>spontaneous</b> <b>pneumothorax</b> will {{typically}} resolve without {{treatment and}} requires only monitoring. This approach {{may be most}} appropriate in {{people who have no}} underlying lung disease. In a larger pneumothorax, or if there is shortness of breath, the air may be removed with a syringe or a chest tube connected to a one-way valve system. Occasionally, surgery may be required if tube drainage is unsuccessful, or as a preventive measure, if there have been repeated episodes. The surgical treatments usually involve pleurodesis (in which the layers of pleura are induced to stick together) or pleurectomy (the surgical removal of pleural membranes). About 17–23 cases of pneumothorax occur per 100,000 people per year. They are more common in men than women.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} patient with sudden onset {{progressive}} shortness of breath and no history of trauma, who rapidly became haemodynamically compromised with a pneumothorax and pleural effusion seen on chest radiograph. He was treated for <b>spontaneous</b> tension <b>pneumothorax</b> but this was soon revealed to be a tension haemopneumothorax. He underwent urgent thoracotomy after persistent bleeding to explore an apical vascular abnormality seen on CT scanning. To our knowledge {{this is the first}} such case reported...|$|R

5|$|Birt, Hogg, and Dubé {{examined}} {{a family with}} a hereditary thyroid cancer and discovered {{that many of the}} members had fibrofolliculomas, trichodiscomas, and acrochordons, which became defined as the classical symptoms of the eponymous disease. The first case of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>pneumothorax</b> associated with BHD was discovered in 1986; the first case of renal cancer followed in 1993 and the presence of lung cysts in people with BHD was confirmed in 1999. It was formerly thought that people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome were at higher risk for colorectal polyps and neoplasms, but this has been disproven. The BHD Foundation supports research into the syndrome and holds regular symposia in BHD and related disorders for researchers, clinicians, and family members.|$|E
5|$|Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} (BHD), also Hornstein–Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome, Hornstein–Knickenberg syndrome, and fibrofolliculomas with trichodiscomas and acrochordons {{is a human}} {{autosomal dominant}} genetic disorder that can cause susceptibility to kidney cancer, renal and pulmonary cysts, and noncancerous tumors of the hair follicles, called fibrofolliculomas. The symptoms seen in each family are unique, and can include any combination of the three symptoms. Fibrofolliculomas {{are the most common}} manifestation, found on the face and upper trunk in over 80% of people with BHD over the age of 40. Pulmonary cysts are equally common (84%), but only 24% of people with BHD eventually experience a collapsed lung (<b>spontaneous</b> <b>pneumothorax).</b> Kidney tumors, both cancerous and benign, occur in 14–34% of people with BHD; the associated kidney cancers are often rare hybrid tumors.|$|E
5|$|Non-human animals may {{experience}} both spontaneous and traumatic pneumothorax. <b>Spontaneous</b> <b>pneumothorax</b> is, as in humans, classified as primary or secondary, while traumatic pneumothorax {{is divided into}} open and closed (with or without chest wall damage). The diagnosis may be apparent to the veterinary physician because the animal exhibits difficulty breathing in, or has shallow breathing. Pneumothoraces may arise from lung lesions (such as bullae) or from trauma to the chest wall. In horses, traumatic pneumothorax may involve both hemithoraces, as the mediastinum is incomplete {{and there is a}} direct connection between the two halves of the chest. Tension pneumothorax – the presence of which may be suspected due to rapidly deteriorating heart function, absent lung sounds throughout the thorax, and a barrel-shaped chest – is treated with an incision in the animal's chest to relieve the pressure, followed by insertion of a chest tube.|$|E

40|$|<b>Spontaneous</b> primary <b>pneumothorax</b> (SPP) in pregnancy, though rare, {{can be a}} life {{threatening}} but easily treatable cause of pneumothorax. Only few cases have been reported till date. Early recognition and prompt treatment are keystones for preventing maternal and foetal complications. We report {{a case of a}} 32 -year-old pregnant lady who developed right-sided large SPP in the third trimester. This case highlights the limitations of diagnostic aids in pneumothorax, challenges posed to an anaesthesiologist (for operative delivery and definitive lung surgery), and the importance of using multimodal pain management plan to improve the outcome...|$|R
5|$|Other tumors {{can include}} trichodiscomas (tumors {{of the hair}} disc, which may be {{identical}} to fibrofolliculomas), angiofibromas, and perifollicular fibromas. However, angiofibromas are more common in tuberous sclerosis. Along with the tumors, other skin conditions are seen in people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome. Approximately 40% of people or families with the disease have papules in their mouth, which can be located on the cheeks (buccal mucosa), tongue, gums, or lips. Either white or mucosa-colored, they are discrete, small, and soft and consist of fibrous tissue covered in thickened epithelium. Collagenomas of the skin are also found in some families. Many people with BHD have skin lesions {{that appear to be}} acrochordons (skin tags), but may instead be fibrofolliculomas. These lesions are usually found in the armpit, on the eyelids, and in folds of skin. Not all individuals develop the facial tumors; some families with the mutation that causes BHD develop only kidney tumors or <b>spontaneous</b> <b>pneumothorax.</b>|$|E

500|$|The risk of {{contracting}} a first <b>spontaneous</b> <b>pneumothorax</b> is elevated among {{male and female}} smokers by factors of approximately 22 and 9, respectively, compared to matched non-smokers of the same sex. Individuals who smoke at higher intensity are at higher risk, with a [...] "greater-than-linear" [...] effect; men who smoke 10 cigarettes per day have an approximate 20-fold increased risk over comparable non-smokers, while smokers consuming 20 cigarettes per day show an estimated 100-fold increase in risk.|$|E
500|$|Along with fibrofolliculomas {{and kidney}} tumors, {{affected}} individuals frequently develop cysts (blebs or bullae) in the subpleural lung base or intraparenchymal space that may rupture and cause an abnormal collection of {{air in the}} chest cavity (pneumothorax), which {{could result in the}} collapse of a lung. The cysts do not cause other symptoms and lung function is usually normal. More than 83% of people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé have cysts, however, the syndrome does not cause conditions like progressive chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or generalized respiratory failure, though it does cause emphysema. Spontaneous, sometimes recurrent, pneumothorax occurs far more often and at a younger age with Birt–Hogg–Dubé [...] than in the unaffected population. Approximately 24% of people with the disease suffer at least one <b>spontaneous</b> <b>pneumothorax,</b> 30 times the occurrence in unaffected people. Though pneumothorax caused by Birt–Hogg–Dubé often occurs in middle age, at a median age of 38, 17% of affected people have a <b>spontaneous</b> <b>pneumothorax</b> before turning 40. Pneumothoraces have been seen in people as young as 7 and 16 years of age. Some families have a form of BHD that only affects the lungs.|$|E
500|$|A chest tube (or {{intercostal}} drain) is {{the most}} definitive initial treatment of a pneumothorax. These are typically inserted in an area under the axilla (armpit) called the [...] "safe triangle", where damage to internal organs can be avoided; this is delineated by a horizontal line {{at the level of}} the nipple and two muscles of the chest wall (latissimus dorsi and pectoralis major). Local anesthetic is applied. Two types of tubes may be used. In <b>spontaneous</b> <b>pneumothorax,</b> small-bore (smaller than 14F, 4.7mm diameter) tubes may be inserted by the Seldinger technique, and larger tubes do not have an advantage. In traumatic pneumothorax, larger tubes (28F, 9.3mm) are used.|$|E

Subcutaneous emphysema is usually treated conservatively and may only cause minimal symptoms. Even when it is severe, subcutaneous emphysema rarely has pathophysiologic consequences, but it is extremely uncomfortable for the patient. The authors report a case of massive and rapid developing subcutaneous emphysema following chest tube displacement in a patient with <b>spontaneous</b> secondary <b>pneumothorax</b> and large air leak. The emphysema was treated with two subcutaneous drains, inserted using local anesthesia, {{on both sides of}} the chest (antero-superior thoracic wall), connected to drainage bags.

500|$|... 11.5% {{of people}} with a <b>spontaneous</b> <b>pneumothorax</b> have a family member who has {{previously}} experienced a pneumothorax. The hereditary conditions – Marfan syndrome, homocystinuria, EhlersDanlos syndrome, alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency (which leads to emphysema), and Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome—have all been linked to familial pneumothorax. Generally, these conditions cause other signs and symptoms as well, and pneumothorax is not usually the primary finding. Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome is caused by mutations in the FLCN gene (located at chromosome 17p11.2), which encodes a protein named folliculin. FLCN mutations and lung lesions have also been identified in familial cases of pneumothorax where other features of Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome are absent. In addition to the genetic associations, the HLA haplotype A2B40 is also a genetic predisposition to PSP.|$|E
500|$|Chest-wall defects {{are usually}} evident {{in cases of}} injury to the chest wall, such as stab or bullet wounds ("open pneumothorax"). In {{secondary}} spontaneous pneumothoraces, vulnerabilities in the lung tissue are caused {{by a variety of}} disease processes, particularly by rupturing of bullae (large air-containing lesions) in cases of severe emphysema. Areas of necrosis (tissue death) may precipitate episodes of pneumothorax, although the exact mechanism is unclear. Primary <b>spontaneous</b> <b>pneumothorax</b> (PSP) has for many years been thought to be caused by [...] "blebs" [...] (small air-filled lesions just under the pleural surface), which were presumed to be more common in those classically at risk of pneumothorax (tall males) due to mechanical factors. In PSP, blebs can be found in 77% of cases, compared to 6% in the general population without a history of PSP. As these healthy subjects do not all develop a pneumothorax later, the hypothesis may not be sufficient to explain all episodes; furthermore, pneumothorax may recur even after surgical treatment of blebs. It has therefore been suggested that PSP may also be caused by areas of disruption (porosity) in the pleural layer, which are prone to rupture. Smoking may additionally lead to inflammation and obstruction of small airways, which account for the markedly increased risk of PSPs in smokers. Once air has stopped entering the pleural cavity, it is gradually reabsorbed.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSpontaneous {{pneumothorax}} occurs less {{in females}} than in males, {{in contrast to}} the relatively more commonly and incidentally found renal angiomyolipoma (AML).

Three years later, she experienced a life-threatening <b>spontaneous</b> tension <b>pneumothorax</b> and pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), which was diagnosed by chest computed tomography. Clinically, she did not have tuberous sclerosis. Pulmonary LAM and renal AML are related lesions and both of these proliferative lesions occur in sporadic patients without family history and at much higher frequency in patients with tuberous sclerosis.
