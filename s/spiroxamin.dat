30|$|Most of the exceedances were {{determined}} {{in a small}} water body surrounded by vineyards in the canton Geneva. Based on the monitoring results, the canton Geneva implemented locally specific risk mitigation measures to reduce the entry of pesticides and to enhance finally {{the protection of the}} surface water [27]. Exceedances might be caused by an enhanced potential for runoff of some herbicides and fungicides (e.g., terbuthylazine, isoproturon, prochloraz, <b>spiroxamin).</b>|$|E
40|$|Fusarium spp. and Microdochium spp. are {{worldwide}} spread fungi. They {{are serious}} problem {{in all areas of}} winter cereals growing. They can cause seed rot, damping off of seedlings, pink snow mold, foot rot, root rot and head blight. Fusarium head blight and foot rot are the most important diseases caused by Fusarium and Microdochium species. During 1998, 1999 and 2000 extensive survey of foot rot causing fungi in the territory of Czech Republic performed. M. nivale var. nivale was the predominant species in all years, high incidence of M. nivale var. majus was observed only in 1998. The Fusarium species were less represented, only F. avenaceum was observed more frequently. F. graminearum, F. culmorum, F. poae, F. sporotrichioides and F. equiseti were isolated only rarely. Differences in disease severity among varieties were found in all years, variety Hana was the most injured of all. However, statistically significant differences were recorded only for low number of samples. The preceding crop has {{an important role in the}} intensity of infection. Resulrs of survey confirmed a higher risk of wheat as preceding crop, high infection was observed after sunflower, potatoes, perennial lolium, winter rape, red clover and pea too. In 1999 survey of head blight causing fungi of winter wheat and rye started to perform. F. graminearum was the predominant species, high incidence of F. avenaceum was recorded too. F. culmorum, F. poae, F. sporotrichioides, F. tricinctum and M. nivale var. majus were isolated only occasionally. Minimal differences in percentage of fusarium demaged kernels were observed among winter wheat varieties, there were no statistically significant differences recorded. Only winter rye hybrid variety Marder showed lower disease severity. Results of this study confirmed higher risk of some preceding crops, especially perennial lolium, wheat and maize, very low disease severity was recorded after poppy, lucerne and spring barley. Influence of disease severity on milling and baking quality of grain was observed too. High significant correlation was found between percentage of fusarium demaged kernels and proportion of grains < 2, 5 mm and between percentage of fusarium demaged kernels and falling number. In next experiment, sensitivity behaviour of M. nivale and Fusarium spp. isolates to some DMI - fungicides in vitro was evaluated. The highest effectivity of prochloraz and epoxiconazole to M. nivale isolates and prochloraz to Fusarium spp. isolates was recorded. No differences in sensitivity were observed among isolates tested. Laboratory tests were completed with field trials in 1998 and 1999. The aim of this study was to evaluate effectivity of selected fungicides to fusarium head blight and to find the most suitable time of application in relation to time of infection. The lowest effectivity was recorded after preventive application one week before inoculation, no differences between applications one day or one week after inoculation respectively were recorded. The most effective fungicide treatment appeared to be following combinations: tebuconazole + triadimefon (Folicur BT 225 EC), <b>spiroxamin</b> + tebuconazole + triadimenol (Falcon 460 EC) and epoxiconazole + kresoxim - methyl (Juwel). The lowest effectivity was observed after application of azoxystrobin (Amistar) and prochloraz (Sportak HF), especially in reduced doses. All fungicide treated variants showed statistically high significantly lower infection rate then control variantAvailable from STL Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|E
