Thirty two Finnish Ayrshire dairy cows were used in a cyclic change-over experiment with four 21 -day experimental periods and 4 × 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. <b>Silage</b> <b>fermentation</b> was modified with formic acid (FA), which was applied at the rates equivalent to 0 (FA 0), 2 (FA 2), 4  (FA 4) or 6 (FA 6) litres t- 1 grass of pure formic acid (as 100 % FA). Dietary treatments consisted of four silages, a protein supplementation (no supplement or rapeseed meal 1. 8 kg d- 1) and a glucogenic substrate (no supplement or propylene glycol 225 g d- 1). Increasing the application rate of FA restricted <b>silage</b> <b>fermentation</b> curvilinearly, as evidenced by higher concentrations of ammonia N and butyric acid in FA 4 than FA 2 silage. Similarly the use of FA resulted in curvilinear changes in the silage dry matter intake and milk yield. The highest milk and protein yields were achieved with FA 6, while the milk yield with FA 2 was higher than with FA 4. Interactions were observed between silage type and supplementation. Rapeseed meal increased milk yield irrespective of the extent of <b>silage</b> <b>fermentation,</b> but the magnitude of response was variable. Propylene glycol was most beneficial with restrictively fermented silages FA 4 and FA 6. In conclusion, restriction of <b>silage</b> <b>fermentation</b> with a high rate of formic acid is beneficial in milk production. Interactions between silage composition and concentrate types suggest that the responses to supplementary feeding depend on <b>silage</b> <b>fermentation</b> characteristics. ...|$|E

The objectives {{of this study were}} to (i) evaluate the effect of ensilage on the in vitro rumen methane output of perennial ryegrass and (ii) relate the <b>silage</b> <b>fermentation</b> characteristics of grass silages with in vitro rumen methanogenesis. Three pre-harvest herbage-conditioning treatments and seven silage-additive treatments were used in a laboratory-scale silo experiment to produce a diversity of <b>silage</b> <b>fermentation</b> characteristics. Ensilage reduced (P< 0 · 01) the in vitro rumen CH 4 output (mLCH 4 g- 1 dry matter (DM) disappeared). This reflected differences in the direction of rumen fermentation (lower acetic (P< 0 · 05) and higher propionic (P< 0 · 001) acid proportions in volatile fatty acids) rather than major changes in the extent of in vitro rumen fermentation (i. e. mmolVFAg- 1 DM). The magnitude of the decrease in CH 4 output (mLg- 1 DM incubated) owing to ensilage increased as the extent of <b>silage</b> <b>fermentation,</b> and in particular the lactic acid concentration, increased. In contrast, among silages with relatively similar extents of <b>silage</b> <b>fermentation</b> (i. e. total fermentation products), an increase in the proportion of lactic acid in <b>silage</b> <b>fermentation</b> products led to a more extensive in vitro rumen fermentation and thus to a greater CH 4 output (mLg- 1 DM). © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

In terms of yield and ensiling potential, the optimum growth stage for harvesting forage peas occurred at 12 weeks of growth. In contrast, delaying {{the harvest of}} field beans until 14 weeks gave the highest yields of dry matter (DM) and crude protein (CP). Changes in crop maturity {{had little effect on}} the chemical composition of the fresh forages, but between-harvest date differences were observed in the DM, ammonia-N, CP, water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC), acid-detergent fibre (ADF), neutral-detergent fibre (NDF), lactic acid and volatile fatty acids (VFA) concentrations and pH of the corresponding <b>silages.</b> <b>Fermentation</b> was improved by applying an inoculant. In Experiment 2, forage peas and field beans were harvested at 14 weeks after sowing and ensiled as round-bale silage, either untreated or treated with an inoculant. The yields of the crops were similar, and the only difference in the chemical composition of the wilted forages was a higher CP concentration in the field beans. However, after the ensiling process was complete, the forage pea silages were found to have significantly higher DM, WSC, starch and butyric acid concentrations compared with the field bean silages, and lower ammonia-N, CP, ADF, acetic acid and lactic acid concentrations.

The silage treated with urea + benzoate had higher crude protein content and total digestible nutrients when compared with other silages. The type of ration affect neither body weight gain (BWG) nor DM intake, but feed conversion was better for animals that received control ration in relation to those fed ration with inoculated silage (5. 71 vs 6. 45 kg DM/kg BWG) ...|$|R

As such due to copyright restriction they are not included here but can be accessed individually from the publisher. The work involves two main areas, namely advances · the feeding value of forages for ruminant animals and advances in the nutrition of alternative herbivore livestock, mainly red (temperate) deer, sambar (tropical) deer and goats. It is shown that absorption of amino acids limits protein deposition (N retention) in sheep fed fresh perennial ryegrass/white clover pasture ad libitum and that absorption of sulphur-containing amino acids (SAA) limits wool growth (a form of protein deposition) in sheep fed pasture conserved as hay or silage. Correlation analyses were used to show that extensive nitrogen (N) degradation in the <b>silage</b> <b>fermentation</b> process reduced N retention, wool growth, and voluntary feed intake (VFI) in sheep fed sole diets of silage. Methods were developed for reducing forage protein degradation by anaerobic microorganisms, initially using additions of the chemical formaldehyde to forages conserved as hay and silage and secondly by using fresh forages containing condensed tannins. Formaldehyde treatment dramatically reduced protein degradation in the <b>silage</b> <b>fermentation</b> process and when applied at an appropriate rate increased N retention, VFI and body growth in sheep. Formaldehyde treatment also increased wool growth in sheep fed hay or silage, but the responses were shown to be limited by forage SAA content, and increased body growth at constant feed intake...|$|E

This paper concerns a field-scale study designed to investigate: (a) the effects of number of layers (2, 4, 6 or 8) of polyethylene stretch film and the duration of storage (7 vs. 18 months) on the conservation characteristics of baled silage, and (b) the conservation characteristics of baled (4 layers of stretch film) and precision-chop silages. All silages were made following three durations of wilting (0, 24 or 48 h). Wilting restricted <b>silage</b> <b>fermentation,</b> with silage pH being highest (P< 0. 001) and the concentration of fermentation products lowest (P< 0. 001) for the 48 h wilt treatment. Wrapping bales in only 2 layers of polyethylene stretch film resulted in extensive visible mould growth, but mould growth was practically eliminated by the application of 4 or more layers of film. <b>Silage</b> <b>fermentation</b> characteristics were generally improved by wilting, and by 4 compared to 2 layers of stretch film. Extending the storage duration of baled silage from 7 to 18 months reduced (P< 0. 001) the concentration of fermentation products and increased in-silo fresh weight losses (P< 0. 001) and visible mould growth. Whereas 4 layers of conventional stretch film are normally sufficient, 6 layers may be necessary to prevent mould growth when bales of unwilted silage are stored for a second season. Under good farm-management conditions differences observed between baled and precision-chop silages probably result mainly from differences in the concentration of dry matter in herbage at ensiling. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Forage {{conservation}} {{has long}} {{been a part of the}} agricultural scene in some countries in the world. Ensilage is a preservation method for moist forages that is based on natural lactic acid fermentation under anaerobic conditions. There are six phases which occur during ensilage, storage and feed-out of the fermented forages. The technology of silage making is not popular in Indonesia, although ensilage may successfully occurs in tropical area including Indonesia. The reason may be due to limited information available regarding ensilage for the farmers. This review covered <b>silage</b> <b>fermentation</b> process and probiotics effect of feeding silage to the ruminants. The role of lactic acid bacteria is very important both from the preservation and antimicrobial points of view...|$|E
25|$|Maize is a {{major source}} of starch. Cornstarch (maize flour) {{is a major}} {{ingredient}} in home cooking and in many industrialized food products. Maize is also {{a major source of}} cooking oil (corn oil) and of maize gluten. Maize starch can be hydrolyzed and enzymatically treated to produce syrups, particularly high fructose corn syrup, a sweetener; and also fermented and distilled to produce grain alcohol. Grain alcohol from maize is traditionally the source of Bourbon whiskey. Maize is sometimes used as the starch source for beer. Within the United States, the usage of maize for human consumption constitutes about 1/40th of the amount grown in the country. In the United States and Canada, maize is mostly grown to feed livestock, as forage, <b>silage</b> (made by <b>fermentation</b> of chopped green cornstalks), or grain. Maize meal is also a significant ingredient of some commercial animal food products, such as dog food.|$|R
40|$|Two {{plants as}} {{condensed}} tannin (CT) sources were supplemented to protein trash fish silage (TFS) to observe {{their effect on}} in vitro ruminal fermentation product, micobial protein synthesis, and   digestibility. CT supplementation on protein trash fish silage was on control proportion (0), under optimum level (2. 0 %), at optimum level (4. 0 %), and above optimum level (6. 0 %) of g TFS); of protein precipitation of bovine serum albumin (BSA) with CT from L. leucocephala; and under optimum level (1. 5 %), at optimum level (3. 0 %) and above optimum level (4. 5 % of g TFS), BSA protein precipitation with CT from C. calothyrsus. The effect on degradation in ruminal fluid and ruminal fluid followed by incubation in HCl-pepsin was evaluated using a modified two-step in vitro method. The CT level of L. leucocephala and C. calothyrsus was 4 % and 6 %, respectively with protein precipitation BSA was 26. 25 and 31. 77 g BSA/g CT, respectively. CT supplementation to trash fish <b>silage,</b> ruminal <b>fermentation</b> product (NH 3 -N, C 2, C 3, and total VFAs) and digestibility (DM and OM) decreased (P< 0. 01) and increased (P< 0. 01) total CP digestibility (in HCl-pepsin). The difference was attributed to CT source without affecting ruminal microbial protein synthesis. CT of L. leucocephala was better in increasing total protein digestibility (70 %) than that of C. calothyrsus  (15 %). It indicated that CT of C. calothyrsus was less effective in protected TSF protein degradation in rumen {{compared to that of}} L. leucocephala...|$|R
40|$|The best {{available}} external carbon source {{to enhance the}} short-cut nitrification-denitrification (SCND) and denitrifying phosphorus removal via nitrite (DPRN) was investigated using a demonstration sequencing batch reactor (SBR) to treat anaerobic supernatant. The SBR was inoculated with conventional activated sludge and fed with liquid effluent from anaerobic co-digestion of waste activated sludge and organic fraction of municipal solid waste. After the 20 day-long start-up, a stable and reliable via-nitrite pathway was achieved. Then, five {{best available}} carbon sources (acetic acid, glycerol, organic fraction of the municipal solid waste (OFMSW) fresh drainage liquid, OFMSW fermentation liquid, cattle manure and maize <b>silage</b> (CM&MS) <b>fermentation</b> liquid) were investigated. Glycerol did not cause major enhancement on nutrients removal. On the other hand, we found specific denitritation rates in the range 0. 51 - 1. 16 kgNO 2 -NkgVSS - 1 day - 1 for OFMSW and CM&MS related carbon sources. Specific consumptions were 2. 1 - 2. 3 kgCODkgNO 2 -Nrem- 1 for acetic acid and glycerol respectively, while OFMSW and CM&MS involved higher ratios 2. 7 - 3. 1 kgCODkgNO 2 -Nrem- 1. Thanks {{to the presence of}} Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs), namely butyric and propionic acids, the fermentation liquids contemporary enhanced the DPRN up to 0. 81 kgPO 4 -PuptakenkgNO 2 -Nremoved- 1. Thanks to the use of biowaste material, the cost of the external carbon source can be lower than 0. 1 €kgCOD - 1 when OFMSW is fermented. Therefore, the total specific cost for nitrogen removal may decrease of 22 % when the OFMSW fermentation liquid is used instead of methanol. © 2012 Elsevier B. V...|$|R
