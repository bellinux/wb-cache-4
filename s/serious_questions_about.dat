25|$|The Knossos archive was dated by Arthur Evans to the {{destruction}} by conflagration of about 1400 BC, which would have baked and preserved the clay tablets. He dated this event to the LM II period. This view stood until Carl Blegen excavated the site of ancient Pylos in 1939 and uncovered tablets inscribed in Linear B.

40|$|The {{priority}} {{view has}} become very popular in moral philosophy, {{but there is a}} <b>serious</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> how it should be formalized. The most natural formalization leads to ex post prioritarianism, which results from adding expected utility theory to the main ideas of the priority view. But ex post prioritarianism entails a claim which is too implausible for it to be a serious competitor to utilitarianism. In fact, ex post prioritarianism was probably never a genuine alternative to utilitarianism in the first place. By contrast, ex ante prioritarianism is defensible. But its motivation {{is very different from the}} usual rationales offered for the priority view. Given the untenability of ex post prioritarianism, it is more natural for most friends of the priority view to revert to utilitarianism. ...|$|R
25|$|The {{implications}} of people's preference for novelty for human relationships are not straightforward and obvious. Evidence that people desire novelty comes primarily {{from studies of}} people's reactions to art objects and the like. This is different when it concerns human beings and social relationships because people can shift attention away from already familiar novel objects, while doing so in human relationships is difficult or not possible. But novel art objects {{are very different from}} people. If a piece of art becomes overly stimulating, we can simply shift our attention elsewhere. This is not a viable option should our spouse suddenly begin treating us as if we were someone else, for such treatment would pose <b>serious</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> the integrity of people's belief systems. Consequently, people probably balance competing desires for predictability and novelty by indulging the desire for novelty within contexts in which surprises are not threatening (e.g., leisure activities), while seeking coherence and predictability in contexts in which surprises could be costly—such as in the context of enduring relationships.|$|E

500|$|Despite its inaccuracies, the Beviss account had {{a strong}} {{influence}} over the story. For many years, both John Chipp Hamp and Geharty figured prominently in retellings of the massacre. According to several accounts, Hamp's son was also involved in spreading {{the story of his}} father's death, including the story of the head in the camp oven, and that {{he was the one who}} discovered the body. Geharty was also mentioned by a number of those that told the story, but again, there are <b>serious</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> the accuracy of his statements. In 1932, a version of the story was told in The Advertiser in which a party of 200 bushmen drove a group of Aboriginal people to the cliffs, but there was possibly only one victim. The writer claimed he had been told this by Geharty. However, from 1926 onwards, most accounts of the massacre usually referred to the archival and newspaper record and noted that there was no evidence for a massacre on the scale of that claimed by Congreve, Beviss or John Chipp Hamp. In 1936, the historian James Dugald Somerville wrote a series of articles in the Port Lincoln Times regarding early settler life on the Eyre Peninsula, in which he concluded that [...] "it is a certainty that the Waterloo Bay 'massacre', as pictured by H.J.C. ,.. A. Beviss and others did not occur, and that the natives did not cut the head off Hamps' body and place it in the camp oven".|$|E

The article alleged that in September 2012, a group of male fraternity members at the university had attacked and raped a female student as part of an initiation rite at a party at the university's chapter of Phi Kappa Psi. The article further asserted that the university's sexual assault policies were severely lacking and that the university administration did not handle sexual assault cases appropriately. The article attracted significant media attention and made national headlines, leading to the suspension of the university's Greek system and further investigation into the article's claims; these investigations quickly revealed numerous inconsistencies and raised <b>serious</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> the article's veracity. On January 12, 2015, Charlottesville Police Department officials told the University that [...] "their investigation has not revealed any substantive basis to confirm that the allegations raised in the Rolling Stone article occurred at Phi Kappa Psi...so there's no reason to keep them suspended". On January 30, 2015, UVA President Teresa Sullivan acknowledged that the Rolling Stone story was discredited. Charlottesville Police officially suspended their four-month investigation on March 23, 2015, stating that they had no evidence of a gang rape taking place, and that [...] "there is no substantive basis to support the account alleged in the Rolling Stone article."

What can we say about the next outcome if we start learning about the process in conditions of prior ignorance? To answer this question we extend the imprecise Dirichlet model to the case of imperfect observations and we focus on posterior predictive probabilities for the next outcome. The results are very surprising: the posterior predictive probabilities are vacuous, irrespectively of the amount of observations we do, and however small is the probability of doing mistakes. In other words, the imprecise Dirichlet model cannot help us to learn from data when the observational mechanism is imperfect.
