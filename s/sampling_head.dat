50|$|The series {{also had}} some {{sampling}} technology plug ins, and many plug ins of this group used the S-series sampling and pulse generator heads. (The S-series sampling heads {{were used in the}} Tektronix 560-series sampling plug ins such as the 3S2, 3S5, 3S6). The 7S11 sampling unit ($1,780) was intended for a mainframe's vertical axis slot; it would take an S-series head, and that head would determine the bandwidth. The S-1 <b>sampling</b> <b>head</b> ($1,160 in 1983) had a 1 GHz bandwidth; the S-4 <b>sampling</b> <b>head</b> ($2,665) had a 25 ps risetime 12.4 GHz bandwidth traveling-wave sampler. The 7S11 would work in combination with the 7T11 ($4,460 in 1983) or 7T11A sampling sweep units as a time base. The 7T11 could trigger on a 1 GHz signal or it could synchronize to a 1 GHz to 12.4 GHz input. The 7S12 TDR/Sampler ($3,390 in 1983) was a double-wide time domain reflectometry plug in; it needed both a <b>sampling</b> <b>head</b> (such as the S-6 30 ps risetime 11.5 GHz pass through sampler, $2,295 in 1983) and a pulse generator (such as the S-52 25 ps risetime tunnel diode generator, $1,655 in 1983). The 7S12 could also perform as a sampling scope with a <b>sampling</b> <b>head</b> and a trigger recognizer head (S-53). The 7S14 dual trace delayed sweep sampler ($5,235 in 1983) was a complete 1 GHz sampler that did not use any S-series sampling heads.|$|E

40|$|A {{research}} project was recently initiated which requires that water quality samples {{be taken from}} small ponds and lagoons in west-central Illinois. A method for obtaining these pond water samples was desired that could be handled conveniently by one person and would not require a small boat. The pond water sampler described here was developed to satisfy this need. The sampler developed allows one person to obtain a water sample at any desired depth while remaining on the shore. After assembling the device it may be floated to any position on the pond surface, lowered to the desired depth, and a sample taken. It is then retrieved by following the previous steps in reverse order as illustrated in Fig. 1. Water samples have been obtained {{at a distance of}} 40 ft from the pond shore and at a depth of 16 ft below the pond surface. The pond water sampler consists of a telescoping rod, manufactured for window washing units, with a T-handle and fishing rod reels on one end (Fig. 2); and the <b>sampler</b> <b>head</b> (Fig. 3) and float on the other end. Cords run from the operator end of the sampler to the <b>sampler</b> <b>head</b> and float to allow the operator to control the float and <b>sampler</b> <b>head.</b> The <b>sampler</b> <b>head</b> holds the <b>sample</b> bottle and may be triggered to allow sampling to occur when the operator desires. The sampler (Fig. 3) consists of three separate components: the <b>sampler</b> <b>head</b> base, the bottle plate, and the stopper plate. The <b>sampler</b> <b>head</b> base is attached to the telescoping rod and contains the water port through which water enters the sample bottle. An extension to the water port which extends into the sample bottle is attached to the <b>sampler</b> <b>head</b> base. Additionally, the base contains an air escape port. The bottle plate is attached to the <b>sampler</b> <b>head</b> base and is fabricated with threads for the sample bottle. The bottle plate may be easily removed from the <b>sampler</b> <b>head</b> base so that other bottle plates fitting different sample bottles may be used with the same <b>sampler</b> <b>head.</b> The stopper plate with stopper is spring loaded to seal the water port while it is being positioned for sampling and after the sample has been taken. To obtain a sample the rod is extended to the desired length and the bottle is attached to the <b>sampler</b> <b>head</b> on the pond shore (Fig. la). The bottle and <b>sampler</b> <b>head</b> is floated to the desired position on the pond surface with the float held tightly to the sampler end of the rod (Fig. lb). The cord to the float is then released to allow the <b>sampler</b> <b>head</b> and bottle to sink to the desired sampling depth (Fig. lc). When the desired depth is reached, the <b>sampler</b> <b>head</b> cord is pulled and water is allowed to fill the sample bottle (Fig. ld). Pulling the <b>sampler</b> <b>head</b> cord removes the stopper from the water port thus allowing the bottle to fill with water through the water port and extension. The air is allowed to escape through the small air escape port in the <b>sampler</b> <b>head</b> base and is conducted {{a few feet from the}} <b>sampler</b> <b>head</b> through a flexible tube. This reduces the possibility of escaping air changing the oxygen content of the water which is being <b>sampled.</b> The <b>sampler</b> <b>head</b> and bottle are returned to the surface using the float and float cord (Fig. le), and the apparatus is floated back to the shore (Fig. lf) ...|$|R
40|$|Nitrate {{levels in}} farm ponds are {{determined}} {{with the aid}} of a water sampler that can be operated from the shore The quality of pond water in southern and western Illinois is being determined {{with the aid of}} a new type of water sampler developed in the Department of Agricultural Engineering. Work on the sampler began as part of a study of water supplies in Washington County. This study, which is being conducted through the College of Agriculture Council on Environmental Quality, was initiated in the winter of 1970, after high nitrate levels were found in the county 2 ̆ 7 s water supplies. Both ponds and wells are being sampled to determine their acceptability as sources of water. For accurate tests of pond water, samples must be obtained at various depths and distances from the shore. A boat, however, is bulky and difficult for one person to handle. The new sampler was therefore devised so that an investigator can sample pond water at any depth without ever leaving the shore. How the sampler is made The sampler consists of a telescoping rod manufactured for window- washing units; a float, a <b>sampler</b> <b>head,</b> and a bottle at one end of the rod (Fig. 1); and a T-handle and two operating reels at the other end (Fig. 2). One reel contains the cord to the float; the other, the cord that operates the <b>sampler</b> <b>head.</b> Cord guides are attached to the rod sections. The <b>sampler</b> <b>head</b> (Fig. 1) is made up of three components: the <b>sampler</b> <b>head</b> base, the bottle plate, and the stopper plate. The <b>sampler</b> <b>head</b> base is attached to the sampling rod and contains the water port through which water enters the sample bottle. An extension to the water port, which extends into the sample bottle, is attached to the <b>sampler</b> <b>head</b> base. In addition, the base contains an air e cape port. The bottle plate is attached to the <b>sampler</b> <b>head</b> base and is fabricated with threads for the sample bottle. The bottle plate may be easily removed from the <b>sampler</b> <b>head</b> base so that other bottle plates fitting different sample bottles may be used with the same <b>sampler</b> <b>head.</b> The stopper plate with stopper is spring-loaded to seal the water port while it is being positioned for sampling and after the sample has been taken. How the sampler works To obtain a sample, the rod is extended to the desired length and the bottle is attached to the <b>sampler</b> <b>head</b> on the pond shore (Fig. 3 a). The bottle and <b>sampler</b> <b>head</b> are floated to the desired position on the pond surface with the float held tightly to the sampler end of the rod (Fig. 3 b).

40|$|Abstract For {{the task}} of shallow lunar {{regolith}} sampling, we have designed a novel Measuring Tape-like Sampling Arm and Drill (MTS) which {{is a kind of}} flexible robot. The advantages of the sampling arm are that it has a small shrink volume, long working distance, light weight, low power consumption and good adaptivity, which is driven by one motor only. Furthermore, it has a large reverse torque with a short force arm, so the pushing force is large enough for the end-effector to penetrate into the lunar regolith. The <b>sampling</b> <b>head</b> which includes two opposite rotating parts has no-reaction screw force. The vibrator located in the <b>sampling</b> <b>head</b> can vibrate at frequencies ranging from 1 to 42 Hz and can result in resonance of the <b>sampling</b> <b>head.</b> Therefore, it can improve the efficiency of thrusting, sampling and casting throw.

40|$|Purpose is {{to develop}} a rapid surface (concrete, steel) {{contamination}} measurement system that will provide a ``quick-look`` indication of contamination areas, an archival record, and an automated analysis. A bulk sampling oven is also being developed. The sampling device consists of a <b>sampling</b> <b>head,</b> a quick look detector, and an archiving system (sorbent tube). The head thermally desorbs semi-volatiles, such as PCBs, oils, etc., from concrete and steel surfaces; the volatilized materials are passed through a quick-look detector. Sensitivity of the detector can be attenuated for various contaminant levels. Volatilized materials are trapped in a tube filled with adsorbent. The tubes are housed in a magazine which also archives information about sampling conditions. Analysis of the tubes can be done at a later date. The concrete <b>sampling</b> <b>head</b> is fitted with a tungsten-halogen lamp; in laboratory experiments it has extracted model contaminants by heating the top 4 mm of the surface to 250 C within 100 - 200 s.

40|$|The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 * defines {{respirable dust}} as dust {{measured}} with a device approved by the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Health and Human Services [30 USC 842 (e) ]. The approved sampler for respirable coal mine dust is the coal mine dust personal sampler unit (CPSU) [30 CFR 74; Jacobson 1971; Jacobson and Lamonica 1969]. The CPSU is generally called the 10 -mm nylon cyclone, although the 10 -mm nylon cyclone is actually just one component of the CPSU. The CPSU may either be mounted on a worker (with the <b>sampling</b> <b>head</b> positioned in the breathing zone for personal exposure monitoring) or in a fixed location for area sampling [Tomb 1990].
