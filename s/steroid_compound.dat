40|$|THE CYTOCHROME P 450 (CYP) {{superfamily}} {{plays an}} important role in the oxidation of exogenous and endogenous compounds (1). The CYP 11, CYP 17, CYP 19, and CYP 21 families are expressed in steroidogenic tissues such as the adrenal gland, testis, ovary, and placenta. These isoforms are involved in the biosynthetic pathways of endogenous <b>steroid</b> <b>compounds,</b> and their expression levels are, in turn, regulated by some <b>steroid</b> <b>compounds</b> (2 – 6). Recently, several steroidogenic enzymes, such as CYP 11 and 3 �-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 �HSD), have been shown to be expressed in the brain (7 – 11). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the levels of some <b>steroid</b> <b>compounds,</b> such as pregnenolone and dehydroepiandrosterone, are higher in the brain than in the peripheral blood (12, 13). After gonadectomy or adrenalectomy, the levels of steroid hormones in peripheral blood decrease, but the levels of certain steroid hormones in the brain remain unchanged (14, 15). These findings strongly suggest that the central nervous system is, in fact, a steroidogenic tissue, and that several <b>steroid</b> <b>compounds</b> are biosynthesized in the central nervous system, independently of their biosynthesis in peripheral steroidogenic tissues. <b>Steroid</b> <b>compounds</b> that are biosynthesized in the central nervous system and have neural effects are referred to as neurosteroids.

Rates of reduction in neuronal viability, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, disruption of ATP production and oxidative stress were ameliorated in 5 α-androst- 3 β, 5, 6 β-triol pretreated cultures.

The most intensively studied <b>steroid</b> <b>compound,</b> androstadienone {{is known to be}} biologically relevant since it seems to convey information about male mate quality to women. It is unclear if the effects of androstadienone are menstrual cycle related. Methodology/Principal Findings: In the first experiment, heterosexual women were exposed to androstadienone or a control compound and asked to view stimuli such as female faces, male faces and familiar objects while their eye movements were recorded. In the second experiment the same women were asked to rate the level of stimuli attractiveness following exposure to the study or control compound. The results indicated that women at high conception risk spent more time viewing the female than the male faces regardless of the compound administered. Women at a low conception risk exhibited a preference for female faces only following exposure to androstadienone. Conclusions/Significance: We contend that a woman’s level of fertility influences her evaluation of potential competitors (e. g., faces of other women) during times critical for reproduction.

Therefore, in the present study, we asked whether sexually dimorphic hypothalamic responses could be measured when subjects were exposed to lower, more physiologically relevant concentrations of androstadienone. A total of 21 women and 16 men, all heterosexual, participated in our functional magnetic resonance imaging study (fMRI). Three different concentrations of androstadienone diluted in propylene glycol (10 mM "high," 0. 1 mM "medium" and 0. 001 mM "low") were delivered to the subjects' nostrils using a computer-controlled stimulator. When exposed to the "high" androstadienone concentration, women showed stronger hypothalamic activation than men.

Thus, we replicated that smelling the chemo-signal androstadienone elicits a hypothalamic activation.

40|$|<b>Steroid</b> <b>compounds</b> can be {{ranked among}} the most widely marketed {{products}} from the pharmaceutical industry. 1 Highly specific reactions are required to produce functionalized compounds with therapeutic use and commercial value. The complexity of steroid molecules renders the use of biocatalysts particularly interesting, due to the high regio- and stereo-selectivity of the reactions to be performed. In the field the biotrasformations of cortisone (17 α, 21 -dihydroxy- 4 -pregnene- 3, 11, 20 -trione) with various bacterial strains (collection of IEP GmbH) are reported...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{screening}} {{results of the}} secondary metabolites composed in Spathodea campanulata Beauv stem bark, evaluate inhibiting activity of malondialdehyde (MDA) on rat’s cancer model exposed with benzopyrene, and the histology of its lung. The secondary metabolite of the stem bark fraction consisted of alkaloids, flavonoids-phenolic, terpenoid and <b>steroid</b> <b>compounds.</b> The isolated fraction contained of these metabolites significantly indicate bioactivity by reducting of malondialdehyde (MDA) level, and also histology appearance of the lung tissue prepared from the benzopyrene-exposed rat indicated a curative activity...|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{investigation}} {{on the soft}} coral Sarcophyton sp. collected from the South China Sea yielded three new polyhydroxylated <b>steroids,</b> <b>compounds</b> (1 – 3), together with seven known ones (4 – 10). Their structures were established by extensive spectroscopic methods and comparison of their data {{with those of the}} related known compounds. All the isolates possessed the 3 β, 5 α, 6 β-trihydroxylated steroidal nucleus. The cytotoxicities against selected HL- 60, HeLa and K 562 tumor cell lines and anti-H 1 N 1 (Influenza A virus (IAV)) activities for the isolates were evaluated. Compounds 2, 3 and 5 – 8 exhibited potent activities against K 562 cell lines with IC 50 values ranging from 6. 4 to 10. 3 μM. Compounds 1, 6 – 8 potently inhibited the growth of HL- 60 tumor cell lines, and 6 also showed cytotoxicity towards HeLa cell lines. In addition, preliminary structure-activity relationships for the isolates are discussed. The OAc group at C- 11 is proposed to be an important pharmacophore for their cytotoxicities in the 3 β, 5 α, 6 β-triol <b>steroids.</b> <b>Compounds</b> 4 and 9 exhibited significant anti-H 1 N 1 IAV activity with IC 50 values of 19. 6 and 36. 7 μg/mL, respectively...|$|R
