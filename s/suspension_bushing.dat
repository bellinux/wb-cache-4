40|$|The paper {{reports a}} {{feasibility}} study of car suspensions {{equipped with an}} innovative bushing composed by an elastomer having magneto-rheological characteristics {{in order to improve}} the performances in terms of handling and comfort. The analysis focuses on the effects produced by the variations in stiffness due to the magneto-rheological effect on the elastomeric material of the bushing. This magneto- rheological effect is designed to act on the performances of the vehicle particularly during the transients of the dynamic behavior. The performances can be achieved by acting on the characteristics of the <b>suspension</b> <b>bushing</b> on the car body. The desired suspension performances, in terms of camber or steering angle, can be obtained by controlling the characteristics of the magneto-rheological bushings. The diagrams of these characteristics, obtained through an Elasto-kinematic analysis, synthetically show the changes of performances due to the variations in the magnetic field produced by the current applied in the inside coil of the bushing. The feasibility analysis could be particularly considered for industrial application of high performance vehicles...|$|E
50|$|During 1971 {{the spring}} rates and damper {{settings}} were altered {{along with the}} front <b>suspension</b> <b>bushes</b> which reduced the bounciness of the ride and low speed ride harshness which had generated press criticism {{at the time of}} the Cortina Mark III's launch.|$|R
50|$|Although the Bravo/Brava IRS was {{prone to}} <b>suspension</b> <b>bush</b> wear. The engine range, {{particularly}} the 1.2 litre petrol, was also criticised for being underpowered. The car's fuel economy was also seen as poor for its class, {{a result of the}} car's heavy weight and the transmission, which used very long gear ratios. Another point of criticism was the Selespeed gearbox, which was seen as too slow in its reactions and particularly inappropriate for the high-powered Abarth version. Nevertheless, the car won praise for its high levels of grip (aided by the unusually wide tires) and its brakes.|$|R
5000|$|In May 1968 a Mark II {{version was}} launched. This {{featured}} a cheaper and more conventional interior, revised front grilles and other trim, {{and for the}} Austin and Morris models the slim, horizontal rear lights were replaced by vertical [...] "fin" [...] lights which gave a family look along with the smaller ADO16 range. The Wolseley retained its unique rear lights. Other changes included a higher second gear and final drive ratio for the manual transmission, and conventional <b>suspension</b> <b>bushes</b> replaced the far superior roller bearings fitted to the Mark I. The compression ratio was increased and maximum power output boosted by 5 bhp to a claimed 86 bhp. The Mark II also had larger wheels ...|$|R
5000|$|The HT Monaro can be {{distinguished}} from the HK by the adoption of plastic grilles (previously metal), a round speedometer instead of [...] "strip" [...] style allowing for bringing the tachometer into the main instrument cluster {{instead of on the}} floor console, rubber front <b>suspension</b> <b>bushes</b> instead of the HK's sintered bronze, and larger taillights where the turn indicators also wrapped around the now slightly undercut edges. Bodywork 'go-faster' stripe designs (delete options) varied for each series; HK stripes were offset to the driver's side of the bonnet (hood) and bootlid (trunk), the HT had two broad stripes down the centre of the car. HT also had twin air scoops / vents incorporated into their bonnet, which served no real purpose in delivering air into the engine bay.|$|R

50|$|Built by the Ford Motorsport (Ford TeamRS) {{works at}} Boreham, Essex, The Rally Ka was {{designed}} as an entry-level vehicle {{to compete in a}} one-make series as part of the British Mintex rally championship. The Ka Championship in 1997 with just four cars in the debut Granite City Rally event. In 1998 fifteen competitors undertook the Mintex challenge. Ford's Boreham airfield facility provides a complete build service for competitors wishing to rally Ka. Most of the parts supplied are concerned with strengthening the car for rallying. Uprated engine mounts and <b>suspension</b> <b>bushes</b> are all included, as is a front strut brace. Aluminium sump and fuel tank guards, OZ Rally wheels and a Safety Devices bolt-in roll cage are all either fitted by the Boreham works or supplied to individual teams. Performance-enhancing modifications are limited to the addition of a Rally spec engine control unit, camshaft and 4-into-2-into-1 extractor set attached to a free-flowing exhaust. This combination lifts power to , and to cope with it competitors are encouraged to fit the optional uprated drive shafts with larger CV joints. A limited-slip differential and heavier clutch plate are also available. A competition brake package consisting of Mintex pads gripping vented front brake rotors and stronger rear drums is homologated for Rally Ka. Replacing the original shock absorbers is a set of four remote-reservoir Proflex coil-over struts adjustable for compression and rebound damping. These are allied to a lowering kit and adjustable spring platforms to give Ka competitors a wide range of suspension settings including ride height. Inside the Rally Ka is all business. In true rally fashion gone are all but the essentials: the two central eyeball vents are replaced by a tachometer and auxiliary gauge. Even the replacement panels in the dashboard which support the fire extinguisher button and extra switches and gauges required in a rally car are listed in the Boreham parts schedule. A deeply dished rally steering wheel, competition seats and harnesses are all supplied from the kit and replacements are not allowed.|$|R
40|$|The cover {{photograph}} shows {{a finite}} element model of the rear tire and the rear multi-link suspension of the Mitsubishi GALANT. The tire, the wheel, {{the air in the}} tire, the <b>suspension</b> arms, the <b>bushing,</b> the shock absorber and the brake system are modeled. The tire characteristics are modeled taking into account the loading applied by the vehicle weight. And by modeling the air in the tire, cavity-resonance noise is able to simulate. Finite element model also enables to verify easily the effect of structure modification...|$|R
50|$|The {{bodies were}} mounted on an updated pre-war Alvis 12/70 chassis that was widened and {{lengthened}} but retained the rigid-axle leaf spring <b>suspension.</b> Employing Silentbloc <b>bushes</b> (except {{at the front}} of the front springs to maintain steering precision) it is controlled by double acting Armstrong hydraulic dampers. Hypoid bevel final drive was fitted for the first time and greatly reduced the height of the transmission tunnel. Steering is by Marles with a spring spoked steering wheel. Mechanically operated brakes are two-leading-shoe type by Girling. Disc wheels replaced the 12/70's wire wheels and are fitted with larger tyres.|$|R
5000|$|American {{troops and}} commanders did not {{prioritize}} security for cultural sites around Iraq. Peacekeeping {{was seen as}} a lesser job than physically fighting in combat and President <b>Bush’s</b> <b>suspension</b> of former president Clinton’s policies for peacekeeping not only backed up this thought but also made the US’s duties to restore public order unclear. American troops in Iraq didn’t trust Iraqi power of any kind meaning that instead of using and training Iraqi police, the US military took matters of security and policing into their own hands. Essentially the US would act as peacekeepers to train a national army and police force. Special Forces teams would work with regional warlords to keep control of their territories. Allowing warlords to police their own areas has been credited with being a disastrous plan for the archaeological sites in particular.|$|R
5000|$|Changes include {{increased}} {{engine performance}} (from Continental GT Speed), a ZF eight-speed transmission, a redesigned {{body with a}} lower, wider appearance with sharp lines and gently curvaceous surfaces; a new wing vent at the front fenders; new body structure including reinforcement to the B-posts, sills and front crossmembers combined with deformable components in the floorpan for optimal load transfer; a deployable aluminium bonnet that includes both new reinforcement panels and deformation elements; 600 new interior parts, lightweight acoustic underfloor panels, side glazing and both front and rear screens made in acoustic glass; a heating and ventilation system with a new Thermostatic Expansion Valve (with optional Climate Boost function), new 19" [...] tyres with a 12% relative increase in sidewall height, suspension spring rates are softened front and rear by 10% and 13% respectively, anti-roll bars softened by 13% and 15% to improve single wheel impact absorption, <b>suspension</b> lever <b>bushes</b> all-round softened by at least 25% for reduced road noise and vibration, revised continuous damping control (CDC),and new 19-inch Classic wheels in bright-painted or diamond turned finishes (optional 20-inch five-spoke, 21-inch six-spoke and 21-inch ten-spoke wheels).Flying Spur W12 Mulliner includes five additional hides, expanding the number of available shades to 17, five further wood veneers choices, 21-inch five-spoke two-piece alloy wheels, Mulliner name at treadplates and the chrome details on the wing vent, diamond-quilted seats and door panels with perforated hides, drilled alloy sports pedals and a knurled sports gear lever.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} experimentally verified {{computational model}} of the collecting electrodes in electrostatic precipitator (ESP). Discretisation of the whole system, both the beams and the electrodes, is carried out {{by means of the}} modified rigid finite element method (RFEM). The RFEM allows easy to reflect mass and geometrical features of the considered. Moreover, the method is convenient for the introduction of additional concentrated masses which reflects elements such as the joints that fasten the electrodes to the <b>suspension</b> beam, distance-marking <b>bushes,</b> riveted or screw joints, etc [...] . The system of nine electrodes 16 m long and several various positions of an anvil beam in this system are analyzed. Position of the anvil beam in the system has essential influence on tangent and normal accelerations at different points of the plates, and thus on the effectiveness of the dust removal process. The aim of the simulations is to find optimal position of an anvil beam, which guaranties the maximum amplitudes of vibrations and their proper distribution in the plates...|$|R
