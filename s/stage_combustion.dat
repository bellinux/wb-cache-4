40|$|AbstractCool flames are {{commonly}} associated with engine-knock phenomenon in spark ignition engines and autoignition in diesel engines, and results from low temperature partial oxidation of the fuel air mixture that eventually leads to hot flame ignition. However, {{the possibility of a}} cool flame supporting quasi-steady combustion of a fuel droplet has never been speculated, let alone been experimentally observed. Recent microgravity droplet combustion onboard the International Space Station (ISS) under the Flame Extinguishment (FLEX) Experiment Program showed anomalous combustion of n-heptane droplets; high temperature combustion followed by radiative visible extinction and a transition to a second stage burn characterized by loss of visible flame emission. In the second stage the droplet regression continues eventually resulting in extinction diameters characteristic of diffusive extinction. Experimental examples of the two stage burning and extinction characteristics of isolated n-heptane droplets under microgravity conditions are presented and analyzed numerically. Predictions show that the second <b>stage</b> <b>combustion</b> occurs as a result of chemical kinetics associated with classical premixed “Cool Flame” phenomena. In contrast to the kinetic interactions responsible for premixed cool flame properties, those important to cool flame droplet burning are characteristically associated with the temperature range between the turnover temperature and the hot ignition. Initiation of and continuing second <b>stage</b> <b>combustion</b> involves a dynamic balance of heat generation from diffusively controlled chemical reaction and heat loss from radiation and diffusion. Within the noted temperature range, increasing reaction temperature leads to decreased chemical reaction rate and vice versa. As a result, changes of heat loss rate are dynamically balanced by heat release from chemical reaction rate as the droplet continue to burn and regress in size. Factors leading to initiation of the second stage burning phenomena are also investigated. The chemical kinetics dictating the second <b>stage</b> <b>combustion</b> and extinction process is also discussed...|$|E

The application of a two-step hearth setup at primary <b>stage</b> <b>combustion</b> offers wider alternatives for solid phase combustion processes. Initial combustion studies of palm shells by controlled air combustion conditions using these set-ups show promising results for further development.

40|$|Premixed diesel {{combustion}} {{is effective}} for high thermal efficiency and reductions of NOx and PM emissions, but {{a reduction of}} combustion noise is necessary for medium-high load engine operation. The control of the fuel injection has become more accurate because of the technical progress of the common rail fuel injection system, and the target heat release shape, calculated by computation, {{can be achieved by}} control of EGR, boosting, fuel injection timing, and injection quantity of multiple fuel injections. In this paper, the reduction of premixed diesel combustion noise maintaining high thermal efficiency has been investigated by the control of injection timings and heating values of multiple fuel injections. There are two aspects of the combustion noise reduction by multiple fuel injections. One is the reduction of the maximum rate of pressure rise in each combustion cycle, and the other is noise reduction effects by the noise cancelling spike (NCS) combustion. The research was conducted with both engine simulations and experiments. In combustion noise simulations, the heat release history of multiple injections was approximated by Wiebe functions and the simulated combustion noise was calculated from the fitted curve of the heat release and the coherence transfer function. The structural attenuation (SA) of the test engine was calculated from the power spectrum of the FFT analysis of the in-cylinder pressure wave data and the cross power spectrum of the sound pressure of the engine noise by the coherence method, then the combustion noise (CNL) can be calculated from the structural attenuation and cylinder pressure level (CPL) in the simulation, as shown in equation 4. The simulation results were confirmed by the engine tests. First, the combustion noise reduction by two stage fuel injection was investigated. The maximum rate of pressure rise changes depending on the combustion occurring separately in the compression and expansion strokes. One heat release was set at TDC and the second before or after the TDC. In the late two <b>stage</b> <b>combustion</b> as shown in Figure 12 (b), the combustion noise reduction was most effectively achieved when the heating value of Q 2 nd is higher than that of Q 1 st, however in the early two <b>stage</b> <b>combustion</b> in Figure 12 (a), the Q 1 st heat release occurs during the compression stroke and the combustion noise reduction by the early two stage NCS combustion is more effective than the combustion noise reduction by the late two stage NCS combustion. Three <b>stage</b> <b>combustion</b> simulations were also investigated at 0. 6 MPa IMEP and 2000 rpm. The optimum heat release shape for low combustion noise and high indicated thermal efficiency was calculated and the role of each part of the heat release in the three <b>stage</b> <b>combustion</b> is discussed.
