5|$|HIV {{is spread}} {{primarily}} by unprotected sex (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV. Methods of prevention include <b>safe</b> <b>sex,</b> needle exchange programs, treating {{those who are}} infected, and male circumcision. Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow {{the course of the}} disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection is 11years.|$|E
5|$|The {{advisory}} board attempts to remain apolitical and pragmatic in {{its approach to}} selecting new members of the Order of Canada, generally operating without input from ministers of the Crown; political interference has occurred only once, when in 1978 Paul Desmarais's investiture was delayed for six months by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. However, some of the committee's selections have caused controversy. For instance, the admission in 2001 of sex educator Sue Johanson, host of the long-running Sunday Night Sex Show, as a Member stirred controversy among some of Canada's Christian organizations, as Johanson had taught teenagers methods of <b>safe</b> <b>sex</b> alongside abstinence. Similarly, the acceptance of birth control advocate Elizabeth Bagshaw and gay rights campaigner Brent Hawkes also incited debate.|$|E

40|$|Rates {{of sexually}} {{transmitted}} infections (STIs) are increasing in older cohorts in Western {{countries such as}} Australia, the U. K. and the U. S., suggesting a need to examine the <b>safer</b> <b>sex</b> knowledge and practices of older people. This article presents findings from 53 qualitative interviews from the study “Sex, Age & Me: a National Study of Sex and Relationships Among Australians aged 60 +. ” Participants were recruited through an online national survey. We consider how participants understood “safer sex,” the importance of <b>safer</b> <b>sex</b> to them, the <b>safer</b> <b>sex</b> practices they used (and the contexts in which they used them), and the barriers to using <b>safer</b> <b>sex.</b> Older adults had diverse understandings, knowledge, and use of <b>safer</b> <b>sex</b> practices, although participants tended to focus most strongly on condom use. Having <b>safer</b> <b>sex</b> was strongly mediated by relationship context, trust, perceived risk of contracting an STI, concern for personal health, and stigma. Common barriers to <b>safer</b> <b>sex</b> included erectile difficulties, embarrassment, stigma, reduced pleasure, {{and the lack of}} a <b>safer</b> <b>sex</b> culture among older people. The data presented has important implications for sexual health policy, practice, and education and health promotion campaigns aimed at improving the sexual health and wellbeing of older cohorts...|$|R
5|$|The most {{effective}} methods {{of birth control}} are sterilization by means of vasectomy in males and tubal ligation in females, intrauterine devices (IUDs), and implantable birth control. This {{is followed by a}} number of hormone-based methods including oral pills, patches, vaginal rings, and injections. Less effective methods include physical barriers such as condoms, diaphragms and birth control sponges and fertility awareness methods. The least effective methods are spermicides and withdrawal by the male before ejaculation. Sterilization, while highly effective, is not usually reversible; all other methods are reversible, most immediately upon stopping them. <b>Safe</b> <b>sex</b> practices, such as with the use of male or female condoms, can also help prevent sexually transmitted infections. Other methods of birth control do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases. Emergency birth control can prevent pregnancy if taken within the 72 to 120 hours after unprotected sex. Some argue not having sex as a form of birth control, but abstinence-only sex education may increase teenage pregnancies if offered without birth control education, due to non-compliance.|$|E
5|$|As Lois finds Chris and {{his friends}} {{watching}} a pornographic film, she becomes convinced a proper sex-ed class should be taught at his school. Since the sex-ed class at her children's school was removed, Lois decides to become the school's newest sex-ed teacher. In class, she attempts to teach students about <b>safe</b> <b>sex,</b> but her efforts are ruined by a botched attempt of Peter, who wishes to distribute his views on sex as well. Soon after the first sex-ed class, parental protests arise as Lois taught kids about safe ways to perform premarital sex, rather than abstinence. As a result, Lois is subsequently fired. She {{is replaced by a}} reverend who promotes both premarital and marital abstinence, explaining fictional consequences of intercourse with various questionable examples. The idea appeals to most students, including Meg, who starts a relationship with a fellow student named Doug. In a subplot, Stewie loses a tooth and is told about the tooth fairy. Frightened by the fairy tale, Stewie develops a plan to capture the fairy, not knowing she does not exist. He borrows Herbert's false teeth and provokes Brian's girlfriend Jillian to throw up, as she has bulimia nervosa, in order to collect her teeth as well. Brian, overseeing Stewie's increasing obsession with the fairy, reveals to Stewie that she does not exist, but another scene shows a man named T. Fairy, having an apparent tooth fetish, stealing teeth to roll around in them.|$|E

25|$|<b>Safe</b> <b>sex</b> {{commonly}} {{involves the}} use of condoms (also known as male condoms), but female condoms, which give women more control during the <b>safe</b> <b>sex</b> practice, may also be used; both condoms keep semen from coming in contact with the vagina, which can also help prevent unwanted pregnancy. There is, however, little research on whether female condoms are as effective as male condoms at preventing STIs, and they are slightly less effective than male condoms at preventing pregnancy, which {{may be due to the}} female condom not fitting as tightly as the male condom or because it can slip into the vagina and spill semen.|$|E
40|$|Introduction.   Higher {{testosterone}} (T) {{is tied to}} risk‐taking, {{especially in}} financial domains but also in health domains relevant to acquiring sexually transmitted infections (STIs). However, <b>safer</b> <b>sex</b> constructs could themselves carry the possibility of “social risk” due to sexual stigma or embarrassment, or could involve boldness or confidence because they could represent status displays of frequent sexual activity. Aim.   To determine how T and behaviorally relevant attitudes about sexual risk‐taking are linked, to better understand biopsychosocial aspects of sexual health related to STIs. Methods.   In 78 first‐year male college students, we examined correlations between salivary T and behaviorally relevant <b>safer</b> <b>sex</b> attitudes assessed via questionnaires. Main Outcome Measures.   T, via saliva; <b>safer</b> <b>sex</b> attitudes, via a composite and the University of California, Los Angeles Multidimensional Condom Attitudes Scale (MCAS). Results.   Higher T was significantly correlated with {{higher scores on the}} following: <b>safer</b> <b>sex</b> likelihood composite, r (73)  =  0. 33, P  =  0. 003; the MCAS <b>safer</b> <b>sex</b> resilience, r (32)  =  0. 36, P  =  0. 037; and the MCAS condom purchase comfort, r (32)  =  0. 37, P  =  0. 031. Associations between T and <b>safer</b> <b>sex</b> likelihood and resilience were still robust after controlling for potential confounds, though the association between T and purchase comfort diminished to a trend. Conclusions.   Higher T was positively linked with <b>safer</b> <b>sex</b> attitudes, especially those most closely tied to STI risk avoidance. Thus, future research and interventions for STI prevention should address the possibility that <b>safer</b> <b>sex</b> may be paradoxically perceived as a “bold” or “risky” choice even as it decreases STI risk. van Anders SM, Goldey KL, Conley TD, Snipes DJ, and Patel DA.
