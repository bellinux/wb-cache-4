40|$|In {{differentiated}} cells, {{aging is}} associated with hypermethylation of DNA regions enriched in repressive histone post-translational modifications. However, the chromatin marks associated with changes in DNA methylation in adult stem cells during lifetime are still largely unknown. Here, DNA methylation profiling of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) obtained from individuals aged 2 to 92 yr identified 18, 735 hypermethylated and 45, 407 hypomethylated CpG sites associated with aging. As in differentiated cells, hypermethylated sequences were enriched in chromatin repressive marks. Most importantly, hypomethylated CpG sites were strongly enriched in the active chromatin mark H 3 K 4 me 1 in stem and differentiated cells, suggesting this is a cell type-independent chromatin signature of DNA hypomethylation during aging. Analysis of <b>scedasticity</b> showed that interindividual variability of DNA methylation increased during aging in MSCs and differentiated cells, providing {{a new avenue for}} the identification of DNA methylation changes over time. DNA methylation profiling of genetically identical individuals showed that both the tendency of DNA methylation changes and <b>scedasticity</b> depended on nongenetic as well as genetic factors. Our results indicate that the dynamics of DNA methylation during aging depend on a complex mixture of factors that include the DNA sequence, cell type, and chromatin context involved and that, depending on the locus, the changes can be modulated by genetic and/or external factors...|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study to explore the main {{characteristics}} of stochastic behavior of Sri Lankan exchange rate against to US dollar. The study used daily exchange rate time series, Sri Lankan exchange rate, (LKR/USS) and collected from Central Bank, Sri Lanka. The study period covers a time period from 2008 to 2010, which represents 722 trading days. The sample period was divided into two as January 1, 2008 to May 19, 2009 and May 30, 2009 to December 31, 2010 in order to investigate the impact of the war. The results shows that basic statistics properties of Sri Lankan exchange rate series was a nonlinear, non stationary series with stochastic trend, 1 (1), and has fetter tails, random walk nature (unit roots), asymmetric shape, serial dependence, volatility clustering, ARCH effects in both sample periods. In the period I: The exchange rate was depreciating, distribution was positively skewed, larger volatility (50 = 3. 4), non normal, non stationary. But in the period II, exchange rate was appreciating, high persistent (sum of auto correlated coefficient 5 = 32), skewed negatively. The changes of log exchange rate behave as normal with an autoregressive conditional hetero <b>scedasticity</b> process for innovations. The characteristics of exchange rate change indicate the presence of heterogeneity among market participants as well as changing parameters over time. Standard deviation of this distribution dominates the mean value. Variance was also time varying. The results of this study have important implications for exchange rate determination, risk management, forecasting, market efficiency, statistical inference in empirical work...|$|E
