40|$|Due to {{constant}} {{changes of}} business requirements and applications, dynamical reconfiguration of service composition becomes {{an important and}} challenging task. Web service composition may save time and expense in software development. In this paper, we introduce the <b>abstract</b> <b>service</b> hierarchy in the OWL-S Ontology Framework for dynamic web service composition. In our approach, the web services are composed at the <b>abstract</b> <b>service</b> level which is {{a higher level of}} abstraction than concrete services. The super instance of an <b>abstract</b> <b>service</b> is also introduced to help describe the service is attached with an instance pool including all instances of the <b>abstract</b> <b>service</b> to facilitate fail-over and dynamic compositions. An algorithm to populate the concrete services to the instance pool is also provided. We illustrate our approach using a case study. Keywords: <b>abstract</b> <b>service,</b> OWL-S, instance pool, service process, web service composition 1...|$|R

However the composition processes are mostly static and lack of support for runtime redesign. In this paper, we describe our approach to {{the extension of the}} OWL-S ontology framework for dynamic web service composition. We service layer so that web services can be composed at the <b>abstract</b> <b>service</b> level instead of the concrete level. Each <b>abstract</b> <b>service</b> is attached with an instance pool including all instances of the <b>abstract</b> <b>service</b> to facilitate fail-over and dynamic compositions. 1...|$|R
