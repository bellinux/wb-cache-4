Typical S log sub 10 <b>N</b> <b>curves</b> were determined experimentally at 25 C, 75 C, and 115 C. The time-temperature superposition principle was employed to find the shift factors of uniaxial fatigue strength, and a general linear equation of S log sub 10 N for shifting purpose was established. The combined techniques of cyclic creep measurements and optical microscopy upon fatigue failure allow some assessment of the possible physical basis of <b>S</b> log 10 <b>N</b> <b>curve</b> shifting.

40|$|It {{is known}} that a post-solution {{treatment}} stretch gives a finer, more uniformly distributed S-phase when ageing Al-Li-Cu-Mg alloys. Fatigue <b>S</b> - <b>N</b> <b>curves</b> have been determined, and tensile tests {{have been carried out}} on stretched (P) and unstretched (N) samples of 8090 alloy in the peak-aged condition at temperatures of 288 K, 358 K and 425 K. A fractographic comparison has been made of the fatigued samples in the two conditions. It is found that magnitude of the Endurance Ratio (of Endurance Limit to UTS) is relatively high, due to the homogenisation of slip by the S-phase, and is higher in the P than in the N material. A decline in Endurance Ratio with increase in temperature is observed in P material, but not in the N material. The results are discussed in terms of the dislocation interactions in the two microstructures, and is supported by previously observed differences in dynamic recovery characteristics between N and P material...|$|R

This process allows to obtain productivity gains reducing sintering time and hence the cost. In current study it was used a machined substrate in which it is built by sintering the remaining part. The purpose of present work was to study the effect of the substrate material and interface microstructure on the fatigue performance under constant and variable block loadings. The sintering laser parts were manufactured in maraging steel AISI 18 Ni 300, while the substrates of hybrid specimens were produced alternatively in two materials: the steel for hot work tools AISI H 13 and the stainless steel AISI 420. Fatigue strength will be quantified in terms of <b>S</b> - <b>N</b> <b>curves.</b> The results show that tensile properties of sintered specimens and of the hybrid parts was similar. Fatigue strength for short lives, of the sintered specimens and hybrid parts was quite similar. However, the fatigue strength of hybrid parts tends to decrease, for long lives, when compared with single sintered specimens. The fatigue tests under block loadings leads to indicate that the application of Miner's law is adequate to predate fatigue life in hybrid components with sintered implants, despite having been observed a tendency to be conservative for long life...|$|R
40|$|Stress-controlled {{fatigue tests}} were run at {{different}} R ratios (= sigma min / sigma max) up to at most 3 million cycles on a 2. 5 %Cr– 1 %Mo steel (ASTM A 182 F 22) used in riser tubes connectors for offshore oil drilling. The fatigue lives, {{as well as}} the slope of the <b>S</b> – <b>N</b> <b>curves</b> were found to decrease with increasing R and the endurance limit to follow Gerber’s parabola. Surface crack initiation without any defect involved, was most often observed for R=- 1, 0. 5 and 0, while an R ratio of 0. 25 triggered crack initiation from either surface or internal pores or chemically inhomogeneous areas, leading, in the latter case, to fish-eye patterns for relatively low numbers of cycles. A further increase in R ratio to 0. 5 promoted only defect-initiated surface cracks, while no fatigue fracture was observed within 10 million cycles above R= 0. 6. These transitions in crack initiation mode are discussed based on X-ray diffraction analyses of residual stresses, elastic–plastic F. E. computations on a unit cell model containing a pore and some fracture mechanics analyses, with a particular attention to environmental effects. The authors acknowledge the assistance of Dr. E.

40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} {{probabilistic}} and defect tolerant fatigue assessment of wind turbine castings. To this end, {{two types of}} EN-GJS- 400 - 18 -LT ductile cast iron were investigated in this research, clean baseline material {{in the shape of}} casting blocks with different thicknesses and also defective material from a rejected wind turbine hub. To establish the required P–S–N diagrams for safe-life design of wind turbine castings, fatigue specimens with different dimensions machined from baseline casting blocks with different thicknesses. Constant amplitude axial fatigue tests were performed on these specimens at room temperature at R = 0 and R = − 1. Geometrical size effect, wall-thickness effect (technological size effect) and mean stress effect on fatigue strength of baseline EN-GJS- 400 - 18 -LT material were evaluated and analyzed. Statistical analysis of fatigue data was done by means of the Weibull distribution, and P–S–N diagrams were established. The established  P–S–N  diagrams showed that the Weibull distribution is well fit to the scatter of the experimentally obtained fatigue life data. Weibull’s weakest-link method was used to evaluate the size effect. It made a satisfactory prediction of the fatigue strength for specimens with different dimensions. To study damage tolerant design of wind turbine castings, a rejected wind turbine hub was flame cut to several blanks and several defective fatigue specimens were machined from these blanks. Constant amplitude axial fatigue tests were performed on these specimens at room temperature at R = 0 and R = − 1. Fatigue strength of baseline EN-GJS- 400 - 18 -LT was compared with that of defective material from the rejected wind turbine hub. The effect of graphite nodules and defects type, shape, size and position on fatigue strength of defective material was evaluated. The hypothesis that the endurance observed in an S−N test can be predicted based on the analysis of crack growth from casting defects through defect-free ‘base’ material was tested for the analyzed defective material in this research. It was shown that fatigue life of the analyzed defective cast component is controlled by fatigue crack growth and the slope of <b>S</b> − <b>N</b> <b>curve</b> for baseline EN-GJS- 400 - 18 -LT is different than the slope of <b>S</b> − <b>N</b> <b>curve</b> for defective EN-GJS- 400 - 18 -LT. To perform random defect analysis of wind turbine castings, establish the scatter of fatigue life and obtain the probability of failure of these components, 3 D X-ray computed tomography was use to detect defects in defective specimens and find the defect size distribution and density of defects (number of defects per unit volume). The obtained defect size distribution and density for the defective material was used in random defect analysis to establish the scatter of fatigue life for defective specimens. Finally both safe-life and damage-tolerant design philosophies were used to evaluate the fatigue life of an EN-GJS- 400 - 18 -LT ductile cast iron block, representative of heavy-section wind turbine castings. The estimated S−N curves for the analyzed component based on these two methods were compared. It was shown that fatigue design of heavy section wind turbine cast iron components based on safe-life design philosophy may result in non-conservative design of these components PhD i produktutvikling og materialerPhD in Engineering Design and Material...|$|R

Because the existing critical <b>N</b> <b>curve</b> determination methods may overestimate the critical N point, making the designed <b>N</b> <b>curve</b> above the actual one, this study presents an improved method to overcome this drawback. An N experiment was conducted during 2 yr (2010 - 2012) using different winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars in the northwestern plain of Shandong Province, China. Shoot biomass and N concentration were sampled weekly during the growing season. A new method for designing critical <b>N</b> <b>curves</b> was developed based on the existing <b>N</b> <b>curve</b> determination method and the t-test inversion.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of material mechanical properties degradation {{as a result}} of long-term service at cyclic loading, creep temperatures and/or their combination has been performed on the basis of various non-destructive methods. Nevertheless, their main disadvantage {{stems from the fact that}} these methods can give qualitative (and not quantitative) results and thus the remaining lifetime cannot be exactly evaluated. New methods of mechanical testing were developed recently that are based on making use of miniature test specimens (e. g. Small Punch Test). The most important advantage of these method is the nearly non-destructive withdrawal of test material and small size of test specimen what is interesting in cases of remaining lifetime assessment when a sufficient volume of the representative material cannot be withdrawn of the component in question. In opposite, the most important disadvantage of such methods stems from the necessity to correlate test results with the results of classical test procedures and to build up a database of material data in service. The correlations among the miniature test specimen data and the results of classical tensile tests, fracture toughnesss values and time to rupture characteristics at creep temperatures and, of course fatigue <b>S</b> – <b>N</b> <b>curves</b> are necessary for the remainig lifetime {{assessment of}} structure in long-time service.

40|$|Stenamma is a cryptic “leaf-litter” ant genus {{that occurs}} in mesic forest {{habitats}} throughout the Holarctic region, Central America, and part of northwestern South America (Colombia and Ecuador).

Based on this information, a number of known species are excluded from the redefined Proisotoma s. str. {{and moved to the}} genus Scutisotoma Bagnall, 1949, which is again given generic status. The following genera are given more precise definitions: Subisotoma Stach, 1947, Ballistura Borner, 1906, Proisotoma Borner, 1901 and Weberacantha Christiansen, 1951. A new genus, Strenzketoma, is erected for the species "Proisotoma" buddenbrocki Strenzke. Scutisotoma titusi (Folsom), S. muriphila (Grinbergs), and S. ladaki (Denis) are redescribed.
