40|$|The {{enclosure}} to {{this letter}} proposes Technical Specifications changes {{that increase the}} limits on stored fuel enrichment, impose a spent fuel boron concentration requirement whenever fuel is stored in the spent fuel pool, and require that the spent fuel pool boron concentration be verified weekly. The increased enrichment limit is necessary to support flexibility in reactor core design. Crediting soluble boron in the spent fuel pool results in more flexible fuel storage constraints for the Palisades fuel storage racks. Enclosure 1 contains the discussions associated with the proposed changes, the proposed pages, and the existing pages marked to show the proposed changes. Enclosure 2 contains the engineering analyses which form the technical basis for the proposed changes. Consumers Energy requests this Technical Specification change be approved on or before October 1, 2001; and that 90 days be granted after approval for implementation to accomplish the necessary procedure changes.

These documents are used to award and administer a construction contract. The PS&E must be approved as defined in Chapter 3, Becoming Certified to Administer FHWA Projects, before the project can be advertised for construction. PS&E approval is done by the local agency as identified in the Montana Department of Transportation (MDT) / Local Agency Certification Acceptance (CA) Agreement. The approving authority identified on the CA Agreement must approve the plans and specifications, and a professional engineer licensed in the state of Montana must seal and date the plans and specifications. The local agency should use the Project Development Checklist (Chapter 4, Developing Projects Using Local Agency Guidelines) to check for completeness of the contract plans prior to approving them. The local agency should have a commitment file, when applicable, containing a <b>summary</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitments</b> made during project development. The file should be reviewed to ensure that the commitments are incorporated in the PS&E. These commitments typically involve right-of-way or environmental considerations (see Appendix 16. 74 for list of possible required permits). A copy of the bid documents should be furnished to MDT CTEP Engineer prior to advertisement for a check of completeness. Any local agency project with work on state routes shall obtain PS&E approval from MDT CTEP Engineer. On state ad-and-award projects, MDT will review and approve the PS&E prior to printing contract plans. An estimate of the cost of this service can be obtained from the MDT CTEP Engineer.

[URL] growth of cross-border higher education and increase in number of international students in Australia has been remarkable indeed. The reasons for this are complex, but rest mainly on the increasing market-like co-ordination of Australian higher education, funding diversification and the continuing privatisation of the public higher education sector. This paper outlines the development of cross-border higher education in Australia. Section I begins with a detailed discussion of the higher education policy background that is essential {{to an understanding of}} why Australia has become a world leader in international higher education. Next, in Section II the paper briefly examines some of the reasons for Australia’s success in international higher education. Then Section III examines the rise of cross-border higher education in this country with a policy shift from aid to trade with respect to international students. The discussion is loosely organized around the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) four modes of service delivery. Next Section IV gives a <b>summary</b> <b>of</b> Australia’s GATS <b>commitments</b> {{and a few of the}} quality assurance (QA) issues.
