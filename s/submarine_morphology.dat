40|$|International audienceThe Monastir Bay is {{characterized}} by high organic pollution (up to 6 % TOC), along the coastal zone and significant eutrophication. Such degradation seems to be strongly related to both characteristics of the supplied water which is rich in organic particles and the <b>submarine</b> <b>morphology</b> showing a flat extending between Khniss and Lamta {{and a series of}} shoals and sand bars between Ras Dimass and Kuriates Islands. Results of the hydrodynamics modeling have shown that the <b>submarine</b> <b>morphology</b> of the bay is responsible for the transformation of the waves coming from the open sea (N, E, SE) to the coastal zone, where reduced energy contributes to the concentration of pollution. Wave modeling has also shown that such concentration prevails in low-depth (0 to - 3 m depth) areas where both surf and breaking zones are almost absent.

30|$|The <b>submarine</b> <b>morphology</b> of the Sciara del Fuoco valley {{has been}} reconstructed in detail (Marani et al. 2008). Two {{submerged}} scarps delimit the shallower {{portion of a}} broad valley, having a flat bottom. Beyond the 900  m of water depth the deep water eastern margin of the Sciara del Fuoco valley consists of an incision connected to the eastern margin that arches in a northward direction down to 1700  m of water depth, diminishing in relief with depth. The landslide deposit consists of a proximal coarse-grained landslide deposit on the volcano slope and of a distal sandy turbiditic deposit (Marani et al. 2008). The proximal deposit includes two facies; {{the first one is}} a chaotic coarse-grained deposit, while the second one is a sandy facies developing laterally over the coarse-grained deposit.|$|E
40|$|International audienceVolcaniclastic {{successions}} are well-described in volcanic {{arc setting}} but rare in hotspot environments. The present work proposes a facies model of volcaniclastic sedimentation related to basaltic hotspot volcanoes {{as exemplified by}} the Piton de la Fournaise volcano (La Réunion Island). The facies model {{is based on a}} multi-scale approach combining high-resolution multibeam and backscatter data, deep-water photographs, side scan imagery and Kullenberg piston cores. Data show that a wide range of gravity flows and erosional features develop in the active volcaniclastic sedimentary system. Coastal and submarine instabilities are the main processes shaping the volcano's <b>submarine</b> <b>morphology.</b> Meanwhile, the evolution and dynamics of the sedimentary system are strongly linked with the morpho-structural evolution of the subaerial part of the volcano. The proposed model is characterized by a cyclic succession of stages: (1) a growing stage during which sedimentary activity is mainly restricted to proximal and mid-slope areas; (2) a collapse stage that entirely reshapes the morphology of the submarine slopes; and (3) an erosional stage related to a slow down of volcanic activity, enabling the development of large deep-sea fans...|$|E
40|$|Submarine channel levee systems form {{important}} hydrocarbon reservoirs in many deep marine {{settings and}} are often deposited within a structurally active setting. This study focuses on recent submarine channels that developed within a deepwater fold and thrust belt setting from the Levant Basin, eastern Mediterranean Sea. Compressional deformation within the study area {{is driven by the}} up-dip collapse of the Nile cone above the ductile Messinian Evaporites. Structures such as folds and strike slip faults exert a strong control on channel location and development over time. From this study four end-member submarine channel-structure interactions can be defined: Confinement, diversion, deflection and blocking. Each of these channel-structure interactions results in a distinct <b>submarine</b> channel <b>morphology</b> and pattern of development compared to unconfined channel levee systems.

40|$|The {{subject of}} {{small-scale}} marine sediment mechanics {{is an area}} of active research, motivated by its key role in beach and shelf processes. Much of the existing small- scale work has focused on two-phase flows and particle behavior at the sediment interface, and their role in sediment transport and shaping seabed morphology. The study presented here considers the behavior of unconsolidated sediments below the seabed, 100 to 1000 grain diameters deep. Motivated by field observations off La Jolla Shores Beach that suggest dynamical behavior at such depths, a series of laboratory experiments were conducted to study the behavior of unconsolidated, saturated granular assemblies. Careful measurements of the apparent mass at the base of dry and saturated, glass beads pilings were acquired to examine stress redirection effects. The experiment protocol included slowly lowering the piling base to achieve reproducible piling configurations through wall friction mobilization. Results are analyzed using the Janssen and Oriented Stress Linearity (OSL) models, the latter allowing interpretation of the arching behavior in terms of arch direction and friction angle along arches. The data show qualitative similarities between dry and saturated granular assemblies, suggesting a commonality in their underlying physics, but quantitative differences in the intensity of the arching mechanism, probably associated with lubrication effects. Analysis of the piling quasistatic descent shows evidence of a progressive upward decompression punctuated with dynamic piling reconfigurations interpreted as relaxation oscillations. Both features are associated with spatial and temporal stress heterogeneities and have implications for modeling the mechanics of granular assemblies. Granular matter theories are expected to reproduce such observations occurring under minute deformations in these laboratory experiments. This work also describes a study of nearshore sediment accumulation and <b>submarine</b> canyon <b>morphology</b> offshore La Jolla, using new seismic data and bathymetry. Isopach maps of the sedimentary sequences overlying the bedrock reveal the critical role of the tectonic landscape on the spatial distribution of modern stratigraphic units.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The Alamogordo, Nunn, and Tierra Blanca Members of the Lake Valley Formation comprise one of at least four transgressive-regressive sequences found within Mississippian strata of the Sacramento Mountains, south-central New Mexico. Excellent exposures along the dip-trending western escarpment of the Sacramento Mountains, as well as within several strike-trending canyons that dissect the mountain front, provide a three-dimensional view of the stratal relationships and facies components within the Alamogordo-Tierra Blanca Sequence. The Alamogordo Member consists of thick, evenly bedded, skeletal-spiculitic mudstone/wackestone and represents deposition during transgression. Waulsortian-type mud mounds were mostly initiated during Alamogordo deposition. The Nunn-Tierra Blanca interval consists of thin to medium, wavy-bedded skeletal grainstone/packstone with lesser amounts of massive, lithoclastic-skeletal grainstone that prograded over the Alamogordo deposits. Grainy facies grade laterally and downdip into thin to medium bedded skeletal mudstone/wackestone. Deposition by sediment gravity flow processes, particularly by debris flows and sandy debris flows, was dominant during Nunn Tierra Blanca time. The Nunn-Tierra Blanca interval prograded into outer ramp-to-basin areas as lobate carbonate sand bodies that thin and become muddier both along strike and downdip. Internal stratal relationships indicate that these sand lobes prograded across the outer ramp through a complex interaction of sedimentation, erosion and sediment bypass. Progradation of carbonate platform margin and slope facies is commonly thought to occur because the platform margin acts as a "line source" of sediment, whereby platform-derived sediment forms a base-of-slope apron with consistent thickness and facies distribution along depositional strike. In contrast, the low-relief (< 50 m synoptic relief), km-scale (laterally), lobate morphologies and lateral facies distributions within the Nunn-Tierra Blanca interval suggest deposition within systems that were more akin to low-relief <b>submarine</b> fans. Lobate <b>morphologies</b> further suggest that shallow-water carbonate sand was transported to outer portions of the ramp from a series of discrete point sources located (but no longer exposed) updip of the study area...|$|R
40|$|Five {{consecutive}} multibeam bathymetries collected before, during, {{and after}} the 2007 Stromboli eruption, combined with visual inspections, allowed us to document the morphological evolution of an 'a'a lava-fed delta and to reconstruct the main processes acting during its submarine emplacement. The 2007 Stromboli delta extended down to 600 -mwater depth and covered an area of 420 x 103 m 2, with a maximum thickness of 65 m and a total estimated volume of 7 x 106 m 3, i. e., three times larger than its subaerial counterpart. The lava delta grew mainly through the emplacement of discrete lobes about 50 - 150 m in size. Lobes were fed from point sources along the paleoshoreline, and their subaqueous pathways seem to be mainly controlled by the <b>submarine</b> <b>morphology,</b> with flows mostly filling in depressions left by previous lobes. The main controlling factors on the lobe morphology and thickness are the effusion rates and the preeruption morphology, i. e., the geometry and gradients of the basal surface. Data also shows that sudden slope failure of portions of the submarine delta may occur simultaneously with accretion, implying that {{a significant part of}} the delta material can be transported to greater depths by submarine gravity flows. The present study is relevant for future monitoring and hazard assessment during the growth of active lavafed deltas as well as for a better interpretation of ancient volcaniclastic successions inland...|$|E
40|$|Large {{landslides}} {{are common}} processes during {{the evolution of}} volcanoes and individual events can exceed several cubic kilometres in volume. Volcanic slope failures are a significant risk for the neighbouring population due to their huge volumes and great runout distances. Around the Canary archipelago, a total of seventeen deposits of large landslides have been found, and on Tenerife, seven large landslides have affected the subaerial and <b>submarine</b> <b>morphology</b> during the last, 6 Ma. However, the causes of such mass movements are still poorly understood. This work analyses the events around the Canary Islands and focuses on the ones that occurred on Tenerife {{in order to obtain}} new insights into the mechanisms of large volcanic landslides. The study is divided into a first part that includes site investigations examining the general features favouring large-scale failures at volcanoes. The second part describes the laboratory tests used to analyse a residual soil that may be the potential slip surface of the slides on Tenerife. The site investigation revealed that regional tectonics and the climate have a significant influence on the spatial distribution of the landslides. Moreover, morphological and geological features such as deep fluvial canyons, a high coastal cliff and persistent dike intrusion may favour the initiation of slope failure. A typical residual soil sample from the lateral scarp of the La Orotava amphitheatre on Tenerife was studied by carrying out standard laboratory tests.

40|$|Sediment {{sampling}} and shallow seismic profiling {{in the western}} and northern Barents Sea show that the bedrock in regions with less than 300 m water depth is unconformably overlain by only a thin veneer (< 10 m) of sediments. Bedrock exposures are probably common in these areas. The sediments consist of a Holocene top unit, 0. 1 - 1. 5 m in thickness, grading into Late Weichselian glaciomarine sediments. Based on average sedimentation rates (14 C-dating) of the Holocene sediments, the transition between the two units is estimated to 10, 00 ~ 12, 000 B. P. The glaciomarine sediments are commonly 1 - 3 m in thickness and underlain by stiff pebbly mud, interpreted as till and/or glaciomarine sediments overrun by a glacier. In regions where the water depth is over 300 m the sediment thickness increases, exceeding 500 m near the shelf edge {{at the mouth of}} Bj 0 rnByrenna. In Bjbrn 0 yrenna itself the uppermost 15 - 20 m seem to consist of soft glaciomarine sediments underlain by a well-defined reflector, probably the surface of the stiff pebbly mud. Local sediment accumulations in the form of moraine ridges and extensive glaciomarine deposits (20 - 60 m in thickness) are found at 250 - 300 m water depth, mainly in association with submarine valleys. Topographic highs, probably moraine ridges, are also present at the shelf edge. Based on the <b>submarine</b> <b>morphology</b> and sediment distribution, an ice sheet is believed to have extended to the shelf edge at least once during the Pleistocene. Spitsbergenbanken and the northern Barents Sea have also probably been covered by an ice sheet in the Late Weichselian. Lack of suitable organic material in the glacigenic deposits has prevented precise dating. Based on the regional geology of eastern Svalbard, a correlation of this younger stage with the Late Weichselian is indicated...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} and activity of submarine canyons on continental margins is {{strongly influenced by}} temporal and spatial changes in sediment distribution associated with orbitally-forced sea-level cyclicity. On active margins, canyons are also strongly influenced by tectonic processes such as faulting, uplift and earthquakes. Within this framework the role of mass-wasting processes, including sediment failures, bedrock landslides and sediment gravity flows, are to: 1) transport material across the slope; 2) act as intra-slope sediment sources; and 3) shape seafloor morphology. In this project the seafloor-landscape signatures of tectonic and geomorphic processes are analysed to interpret the development of <b>submarine</b> canyon <b>morphology</b> on active margins. Datasets include high-resolution bathymetry data (Simrad EM 300), multichannel seismic reflection data (MCS), high-resolution 3. 5 kHz seismic reflection data, sediment cores, and dated seafloor samples. High-resolution bathymetric grids are analysed using techniques developed for terrain-roughness analysis in terrestrial landscapes to objectively map and interpret features related to seafloor mass-wasting processes. The Hikurangi subduction margin of New Zealand provides world-class examples of the control of tectonic and sedimentary processes on margin development, hosting multiple examples of deeply-incised canyon systems {{across a range of}} scales. Two main study sites, in Poverty Bay and Cook Strait, provide examples of canyon formation. From these examples conceptual and representative models are developed for the spatial and temporal relationships between active tectonic structures, geology, sediment supply, slope- and shelf-incised canyons, slope gully systems, and bedrock mass failures. The Poverty Bay site occurs on the subduction-dominated northern Hikurangi Margin, where the ~ 3000 km² Poverty re-entrant hosts the large Poverty Canyon system, the only shelf-break-to-subduction-trough canyon on the northern margin. The geomorphic development of the re-entrant is affected by gully development on the upper slope, and multi-cubic-kilometre-scale submarine landslides. From this site the study focuses on the initiation and development of upper-slope gullies and the role of deep-seated slope failure in upper-slope evolution. The Cook Strait site occurs on the southern Hikurangi Margin in the subduction-to-strike-slip transition zone. The 1800 km² Cook Strait Canyon incises almost 50 km into the continental shelf, with a multi-branching canyon head converging to a deeply slope-incised meandering main channel fed by multiple contributing slope canyons. Other medium-sized canyons are incised into the adjacent continental slope. Fluvial sediment supply to the coast is relatively low on the southern margin, but Cook Strait is subject to large diurnal tidal currents that mobilise sediment through the main strait area. Prior to the morphostructural analysis of the Cook Strait and Poverty study sites a revision of the tectonic structure was undertaken. In Cook Strait a revision of the available fault maps was undertaken as part of a wider, related tectonic study of the central New Zealand region. In Poverty Bay very limited prior information was available, and as part of this study the structure and stratigraphy of the entire shelf and upper slope has been interpreted. On active tectonic margins submarine canyons respond to tectonics at: 1) margin-setting scales relating to their ability to become shelf incised; 2) regional scales relating to canyon-incision response to base-level perturbations; and 3) local scales relating to propagating structures affecting canyon location and geometry. Interpretation of the spatial distribution of fluid vent sites, gully {{development and}} landslide scars leads to the conclusion that seepage-driven failure is not a primary control on the widespread instances of gully formation and landslide erosion affecting structurally-generated relief across the margin. Rather, the erosion of tectonic ridges is dominated by tectonics by: slope oversteepening; weakening of the rockmass in fault-damage zones; and triggering of slope failure by earthquake-generated cyclic loading. Deep-seated mass failures affect numerous aspects of submarine landscapes and {{play a major role in}} the enlargement of canyon systems. They enable the development of slope gully systems and represent a major intra-slope sediment source. Quantitative morphometric analysis together with MCS data indicate that landslides may evolve to be active complexes where landslide debris is remobilized repeatedly, analogous to terrestrial-earthflow processes. This process has not previously been documented on submarine slopes. A model is presented for the evolution of active margin canyons that contrasts highstand and lowstand canyon activity in terms of channel incision, sedimentary processes and slope-erosion processes. During sea-level highstand intervals, canyons become decoupled from their terrestrial/coastal sediment-supply source areas, while during sea-level lowstand intervals, canyons are coupled to fluvial and littoral sediment-supply sources, and top-down (i. e. shelf-to-lower-slope) sediment transport and channel incision is active. Canyon-head areas are incision dominated during the lowstand while mid to lower canyon reaches experience both a transient increase in sediment in storage and canyon-fill degradation and incision into bedrock. Tectonics influences the canyon landscape through both uplift-controlled perturbations to canyon base-levels and earthquake-triggering of mass movement. Following sea-level rise the sediment supply to canyon heads will be switched off at a certain threshold sea level. From this point canyon heads become aggradational. Mid to lower canyon reaches continue to incise due to continuing tectonic uplift and earthquake-triggered slope instability. Knickpoints are propagated up channel and excavate canyon and sub-canyon channels from the bottom up. Thus, while top-down infilling of non-coupled canyons occurs during sea-level highstands, the lower reaches of active margin canyons continue to incise due the influence of tectonic processes...|$|R
40|$|Terrestrial glacial {{geomorphology}} {{has long}} been {{used to evaluate the}} extent, chronology and dynamics of former glaciers and ice sheets. New marine geophysical methods provide an opportunity to study the glacial <b>submarine</b> <b>morphology</b> of modern continental shelves and fjord systems. This makes it possible to study landform assemblages in the submarine settings that are often better preserved than their terrestrial counterparts. This study focuses mainly on the recent surge history of the tidewater glacier Tunabreen, which calves into Tempelfjorden in Western Spitsbergen. Tunabreen is a small outlet glacier of the Lomonosovfonna ice cap and has experienced severalsurges and terminal retreats during the last century. The multiple surge events havemost likely removed or reworked landform assemblages created by earlier surges,resulting in a complex geomorphological imprint on the bed of Tempelfjorden. Tunabreen has left a specific morphological imprint on the sea floor, consisting of iceflow‐parallel lineations and generally flow‐transverse retreat moraines. Comparisonof retreat moraines mapped from high resolution multibeam bathymetric data andglacier terminal positions, established using remote sensing imagery suggest that themoraines in the inner part of Tempelfjorden are annually formed recessionalmoraines, formed during winter still stands of the glacier margin or during its minorreadvances. Although detailed reconstruction of glacier surge dynamics based solelyon the landform distribution is challenging, it is evident that Tunabreen hasexperienced fast flow during surges and semiannual retreat of the margin after thesurges. The main achievements of this study are a spatial reconstruction of the dynamics ofTunabreen, which has experienced three surges during the last hundred years. Together with the Little Ice Age surge of the adjacent von Postbreen, four recentsurges have been recorded in Tempelfjorden since 1870, which distinguishes thestudy area from earlier studied Svalbard tidewater surge glacier settigs, where theglaciers have been known to surge only once or twice. However a detailedunderstanding of surge triggering mechanisms and their role in controlling thedynamics of the tidewater glaciers in Svalbard is still poor and requires furtherinvestigations. Svalbard, where most of the small outlet glaciers are believed to be ofsurge type, is an excellent natural laboratory for such investigations...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a {{reconstruction of the}} late Weichselian, deglacial and Holocene glacial history of the Svalbard fjords, focusing on eastern Svalbard. The study is based on high-resolution multibeam data, shallow acoustic (chirp) data, marine sediment cores, historical maps and aerial- satellite images. During the Last Glacial Maximum the Svalbard Barents Sea ice sheet reached the shelf edge around Svalbard and was drained by large ice streams along its western and northern margins, located in the same areas as the present day cross-shelf troughs. In northeastern Svalbard, fast- flowing ice converged into the Hinlopen Strait ice stream from the surrounding fjords. Submarine landforms indicate that ice flow velocities increased as ice flowed from the inner- to the outer fjords and the shelf. The deglaciation from the northeastern shelf edge proceeded rapidly by ice lift-off in the troughs and deeper parts of the fjords, whereas the shallower areas experienced slower retreat with minor re-advances. The inner fjords around Nordaustlandet were ice free prior to 11. 3 - 10. 5 ka BP years. During early- to mid-Holocene tidewater glaciers in Mohnbukta and Vaigattbogen experienced at least one surge-type advance. These pre-Little Ice Age surges differentiate the east coast glaciers from the west coast glaciers. The early Holocene advance in Mohnbukta {{has been attributed to}} rapid climatic and environmental change {{at the end of the}} deglaciation, leading to dynamic disequilibrium and an environmentally induced jump into surge-mode. This suggests a more dynamic Holocene glacial history in Svalbard than previously stated, also indicating that the role of climate is more important in the evolution of general surge patterns than previously presumed. Similarly, climatic and environmental changes at the end of the Little Ice Age could explain why many Svalbard glaciers, both on the west and east coasts surged in that time period. Today, the majority of Svalbard’s fjords accommodate tidewater glaciers, of which several have been recorded to surge. Commonly the glaciers have surged at least twice during the Holocene. The surging tidewater glacier landform assemblages share many similarities and can be used to identify past surges in the geological record. In this study the <b>submarine</b> <b>morphology</b> has been used to identify three new surge-type glaciers in Wahlenbergfjorden. The surge history of the Svalbard glaciers is diverse and even though the landform assemblages share many similarities, they all feature differences, suggesting that local conditions are important in the evolution of glacial surges. </p...|$|E
40|$|The Upper Cretaceous {{to lower}} Paleogene Chalk Group of NW Europe is classically assumed to {{represent}} the settlement of homogeneous calcareous ooze from suspension draping <b>submarine</b> <b>morphology</b> under quiet pelagic conditions. Redeposited chalk units have, however, also been identified in the Central North Sea. Recently, the documentation of prominent intra-Chalk and Top Chalk reflection discontinuities on 3 D seismic data led to a revision of some general ideas of the chalk deposition. Several important issues concerning the understanding of highly irregular and discontinuous features of the Upper Cretaceous to lower Palaeogene age Chalk Group in the Danish North Sea are not yet fully understood. These irregular and discontinuous features include: intra-chalk incision features, Top Chalk depression features and a Top Chalk hummocky facies. These irregularities and discontinuities form a marked contrast to the chalk deposited under quiet, homogeneous pelagic conditions. This study tackles the observed geometries {{by focusing on the}} interpretation and analysis of discontinuous chalk reflections detected on a 2000 km² 3 D seismicreflection dataset of the Central Graben, Danish North Sea provided by Maersk Oil and Gas. The 3 D seismic analysis consisted of a horizon interpretation, the selection of chalk target areas for interpretations in detail, and a systematic analysis of the Chalk Group to search for similar features that might have a causal relationship with these discontinuities. The results of these interpretations and analyses are expected to reveal the processes which are responsible for creating the irregular features in the study area. In this thesis it is documented that:(1) Several intra-Chalk channels are preserved in the subsurface of the Danish North-Sea Central Graben. The main channel system trends approximately 25 km in N-S direction between the Bo-Jens Ridge and Adda Ridge into an area west of the Gorm salt structure. Intra-chalk incisions developed in response to strong turbidite currents vs. contour currents affecting the Late Cretaceous “chalk sea”. (2) More than 170 depressions are observed in an interval immediately below and above the Top Chalk surface in the southeastern Danish Central Graben. Based on their plan view geometry and their degree of symmetry, three types of depressions were classified: Type 1, comprising sub-circular and symmetrical depressions, Type 2, elongated and symmetrical depressions and, Type 3, elongated and asymmetrical depressions. The observed depressions on the Top Chalk surface are pockmarks caused by fluid escape. (3) Several areas characterized by a hummocky seismic-reflection facies that occur in an interval from ca. 15 ms below to 25 ms above the Top Chalk surface were identified. Depressions associated with this facies can be recognized as a subcircular, elongate or a lunar features. These depressions at Top Chalk are interpreted as collapse structures formed by fluid or gas escape which was possibly linked to a minor pulse of regional tectonic inversion during Danian times...|$|E
