[...] He said that [...] "like all soap actors," [...] he sticks with the script the majority of the time, [...] "but every now and then he goes off the page," [...] commenting, [...] "You get to direct yourself.

The issue was - should nationalists co-operate with a minority of Irishmen whose political background was so fundamentally different from theirs? The adversaries said no, O’Brien <b>said</b> <b>yes,</b> pointing <b>to</b> the successful Land Conference as the precursor of further partnerships between nationalists and Unionists.|$|R

The studio was adamant to work with Jackson on his next project and, in late 1995, offered him the chance to direct a remake of the 1954 film Creature from the Black Lagoon. He turned down the offer, but Universal became aware of Jackson's obsession with King Kong and subsequently offered {{him the opportunity to}} direct that remake. The studio did not have to worry of lawsuits concerning the film rights from RKO Pictures (the studio behind the 1933 film) because the King Kong character is held in the public domain. Jackson initially turned down the King Kong offer, but he [...] "quickly became disturbed by the fact that someone else would take it over," [...] Jackson continued, [...] "and make it into a terrible film; that haunted me and I eventually <b>said</b> <b>yes</b> <b>to</b> Universal." ...|$|E

Describing her motivation, she states: [...] "I am not an overtly political person. I just want fairness". Ayola believes that black actors receive less recognition than their white counterparts, explaining; [...] "If you get a show with six stars and one is black you are more likely to see interviews with the five white actors. [...] They are not being sold as a reason to watch." [...] She believes that her career would have taken her in a different direction were she not of ethnic origin, stating: [...] "I could not have played any of the roles I have played on TV if I was white [...] I am very aware of where the glass ceiling is and it's still very low and expectations are still very low". She has noted having casting directors accept the notion of characters being both black and Welsh to be a particular problem, explaining that: [...] "I get offered a lot of very different roles, but they're never Welsh. [...] The one time I was asked to play a Welsh character on screen was in Tiger Bay for BBC Wales, but I know if that series had been called Radyr Park or Cyncoed Close I wouldn't have been in it". In 2001, Ayola founded a production company and directed a short film entitled Persephone's Playground. She presented the film at the Cannes film festival, using it as part of her campaign for increased black representation in theatre, films and television. The project, however, was largely unsuccessful, with Ayola stating: [...] "it just made me decide that if there's anything I don't want to do, it's produce films, because I'm rubbish at it. I was so bad with the budget that I just <b>said</b> <b>yes</b> <b>to</b> everything and then had to worry about how to pay for things at the end." [...] In 2008, Ayola offered her support to the [...] campaign Dignity! Period, aiming to provide affordable sanitary protection to Zimbabwean women.|$|E

Universal Pictures passed on the film, leading the duo to take it to Columbia Pictures.

2500|$|A {{survey of}} admissions {{personnel}} suggested that two-fifths had <b>said</b> <b>yes</b> <b>to</b> applicants from minorities despite having lower grades and test scores than other applicants, on average. At the same time, rulings by the Supreme Court have prevented race from becoming an [...] "overriding factor" [...] in college admissions. A report suggested minority {{students have a}} better chance overall at selective colleges. In the case of multiracial students, they have a choice of which box to check since it may be perceived either as [...] "gamesmanship" [...] or reflecting one's racial makeup. Some Asian-Americans have felt loathe to describe themselves as Asian, or to reveal information about their ethnic background, on the supposition that college admissions departments discriminate against them because of their ethnicity and consider them incorrectly to be [...] "boring academic robots", according to several reports. Typically, Asian applicants require a SAT score 140 points above that of a comparable white student, and considerably higher than that of a non-Asian minority, to have a similar chance of admission. Asians get a [...] "raw deal" [...] in Ivy admissions, according to Hernandez, and have to be much better students than the typical white applicant to be admitted.

The admissions practices of Harvard and Princeton were investigated for possible discrimination against Asian-American applicants by the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights.|$|E

In addition Westlife told Digital Spy: [...] "We'd {{wanted to work with}} him for a long time, but all his loyalty was to Take That and he didn't want to work with another boyband," [...] "We'd been asking him and asking, but literally within moments of Take That deciding to go and work with Stuart Price, he <b>said</b> <b>yes</b> <b>to</b> us straight away. Afterwards he said he'd wanted to work with us for a long time, but he just couldn't do the Take That thing and the Westlife thing because they were too close." [...] "John created a sound for us in the same way he created a sound for Take That, a sound for Bon Jovi and a sound for all the other incredible artists he's worked with," [...] "He created a sound for Westlife that we haven't had before - it's not a massive departure, but it's definitely a step up in terms of production." [...] Filan also revealed that the group is currently in the process of selecting 12 or 13 songs for the album's final track listing from a pool of 16, with all but [...] "one or two" [...] likely to be originals. On 22 October 2010, Shanks stated that they have finished the Westlife record, all approved by Cowell. Shanks stated that the album ended up with two covers in it.
