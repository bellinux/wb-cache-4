40|$|Predators {{can affect}} prey {{dispersal}} lethally by direct consumption or non-lethally by making prey hesitate to disperse. These lethal and non-lethal effects are detectable only in systems where prey can disperse between multiple patches. However, most studies have drawn their conclusions concerning {{the ability of}} predatory <b>mites</b> to suppress <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> based on observations of their interactions on a single patch or on heavily infested host plants where <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> could hardly disperse toward intact patches. In these systems, specialist predatory mites that penetrate protective webs produced by <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> quickly suppress the <b>spider</b> <b>mites,</b> whereas generalist predators that cannot penetrate the webs were ineffective. By using a connected patch system, we revealed that a generalist ant, Pristomyrmex punctatus Mayr (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), effectively prevented dispersal of <b>spider</b> <b>mites,</b> Tetranychus kanzawai Kishida (Acari: Tetranychidae), by directly consuming dispersing individuals. We also revealed that a generalist predatory mite, Euseius sojaensis Ehara (Acari: Phytoseiidae), prevented between-patch dispersal of T. kanzawai by making them hesitate to disperse. In contrast, a specialist phytoseiid predatory mite, Neoseiulus womersleyi Schicha, allowed <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> to escape an initial patch, {{increasing the number of}} colonized patches within the system. Our results suggest that ants and generalist predatory mites can effectively suppress Tetranychus species under some conditions, and should receive more attention as agents for conservation biological control in agroecosystems...|$|R
25|$|Slugs and snails {{are serious}} pests {{in some parts}} of the world, {{particularly}} in spring when new growth is emerging through the soil. Earwigs can also disfigure the blooms. The other main pests likely to be encountered are aphids (usually on young stems and immature flower buds), red <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> (causing foliage mottling and discolouration, worse in hot and dry conditions) and capsid bugs (resulting in contortion and holes at growing tips). Diseases affecting dahlias include powdery mildew, grey mould (Botrytis cinerea), verticillium wilt, dahlia smut (Entyloma calendulae f. dahliae), phytophthora and some plant viruses. Dahlias are a source of food for the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including angle shades, common swift, ghost moth and large yellow underwing.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the seasonal population dynamics of <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> [Panonychus ulmi (Koch), Amphitetranychus viennensis (Zacher), Bryobia rubrioculus (Scheuten) ] and their natural enemies [Kampimodromus aberrans (Oudemans), Acari, Phytoseiidae; Zetzellia mali (Ewing), Acari, Stigmaeidae; and Stethorus punctillum Weise, Coleoptera, Coccinellidae] on Golden Delicious and Starking Delicious apple cultivars in three apple orchards of Van, Turkey, during 2002 – 2003. Surveys were carried out weekly from May to November in sprayed and unsprayed apple orchards. The results of study indicated that the population densities of <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> began to increase generally in early May, reached the maximum level from mid June to late August and persisted until late September in both years. During 2002 the dominant species on both apple cultivars was P. ulmi, whereas in 2003 it was A. viennensis. In this two-year period, the population densities of P. ulmi and A. viennensis reached the maximum level of 318. 1 and 427. 2 mites per leaf, respectively, in sprayed orchards. In unsprayed orchard, <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> remained at very low levels because of the presence of K. aberrans which was the only predator of <b>spider</b> <b>mites.</b> On the other hand, in sprayed orchards, although S. punctillum and Z. mali were the most abundant predatory species on <b>spider</b> <b>mites,</b> they could not control them in either apple cultivar and years...|$|R

40|$|This {{project was}} {{focussed}} on {{the establishment of}} predatory mites that are used for the control of <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> and western flower thrips in carnation and potted plants. The waxy layer on carnation leaves seem to hamper predatory mites, as oviposition rates were much lower on carnation leaves than on sweet pepper leaves. A greenhouse trial showed the potential of using a mulch with bark, bran and yeast to maintain populations of prey mites for 11 weeks. However, this did not enhance the establishment of predatory mites in the crop. Several species of predatory mites were released in Chamaedorae with low densities of <b>spider</b> <b>mites,</b> {{but none of them}} established for more than 2 weeks.
