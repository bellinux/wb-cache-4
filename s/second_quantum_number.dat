50|$|The {{azimuthal}} {{quantum number}} is a quantum number for an atomic orbital that determines its {{orbital angular momentum}} and describes {{the shape of the}} orbital. The azimuthal quantum number is the second of a set of quantum numbers which describe the unique quantum state of an electron (the others being the principal quantum number, following spectroscopic notation, the magnetic quantum number, and the spin quantum number). It is also known as the orbital angular momentum quantum number, orbital quantum number or <b>second</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>number,</b> and is symbolized as ℓ.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we study}} the Schrödinger {{equation}} with a non- central modified Kratzer potential plus a ring- shaped like potential, {{which is not}} spherically symmetric. Thus, the standard methods for separation of variables do not quite apply. However {{we are able to}} separate variables using a simple extension of the standard method, which leads to solutions in the associated Laguerre function for the radial part and Jacobi polynomials for the polar angle part. We also introduce an interesting pair of first order ladder operators, which allow us to generate the energy eigenvalues for all states of the system. The obtained results show that the lack of spherical symmetry removes the degeneracy of <b>second</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>number</b> m which completely expected. c ○ Electronic Journal of Theoretical Physics.

50|$|For {{nonlinear}} molecules {{which are}} symmetric rotors (or symmetric tops - see next section), {{there are two}} moments of inertia and the energy also depends on a <b>second</b> rotational <b>quantum</b> <b>number,</b> , which defines the vector component of rotational angular momentum along the principal symmetry axis.

On the basis of our model and the recent vibrational potential [J. Chem. Phys. 115, 3706 (2001) ], we analyze the HCN/CNH isomerizing molecule. We find that HCN/CNH has no monodromy and introduce the <b>second</b> global bending <b>quantum</b> <b>number</b> for this system at all energies where the potential is expected to work.

500|$|Calculations have {{confirmed}} {{the accuracy of}} this simple extrapolation, although experimental verification of this is currently impossible as the half-lives of the known tennessine isotopes are too short. Significant differences between tennessine and the previous halogens are likely to arise, largely due to spin–orbit interaction— the mutual interaction between the motion and spin of electrons. The spin–orbit interaction is especially strong for the superheavy elements because their electrons move faster— at velocities comparable to the speed of light— than those in lighter atoms. In tennessine atoms, this lowers the 7s and the 7p electron energy levels, stabilizing the corresponding electrons, although two of the 7p electron energy levels are more stabilized than the other four. The stabilization of the 7s electrons is called the inert pair effect; the effect that separates the 7p subshell into the more-stabilized and the less-stabilized parts is called subshell splitting. Computational chemists understand the split as a change of the <b>second</b> (azimuthal) <b>quantum</b> <b>number</b> l from 1 to 1/2 and 3/2 for the more-stabilized and less-stabilized parts of the 7p subshell, respectively.

40|$|The {{problem of}} a single {{electron}} in a magnetic field is revisited from first principles. It is shown that the standard quantization, used by Landau, is inconsistent for this problem, whence Landau's wave functions spontaneously break the gauge symmetry of translations in the plane. Because of this Landau's (and Fock's) wave functions have a spurious <b>second</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>number.</b> The one-body wave function of the physical orbit, with only one quantum number, is derived, and expressed as a superposition of Landau's wave functions. Conversely, it is shown that Landau's wave functions are a limiting case of physical solutions of a different problem, where two quantum numbers naturally appear. When the translation gauge symmetry is respected, the degeneracy related to the choice of orbit center {{does not appear in}} the one-body problem.

5|$|The {{main reason}} for the {{predicted}} differences between unbinilium and the other alkaline earth metals is the spin–orbit (SO) interaction—the mutual interaction between the electrons' motion and spin. The SO interaction is especially strong for the superheavy elements because their electrons move faster—at velocities comparable to the speed of light—than those in lighter atoms. In unbinilium atoms, it lowers the 7p and 8s electron energy levels, stabilizing the corresponding electrons, {{but two of the}} 7p electron energy levels are more stabilized than the other four. The effect is called subshell splitting, as it splits the 7p subshell into more-stabilized and the less-stabilized parts. Computational chemists understand the split as a change of the <b>second</b> (azimuthal) <b>quantum</b> <b>number</b> l from 1 to 1/2 and 3/2 for the more-stabilized and less-stabilized parts of the 7p subshell, respectively. Thus, the outer 8s electrons of unbinilium are stabilized and become harder to remove than expected, while the 7p3/2 electrons are correspondingly destabilized, perhaps allowing them to participate in chemical reactions. This stabilization of the outermost s-orbital (already significant in radium) is the key factor affecting unbinilium's chemistry, and causes all the trends for atomic and molecular properties of alkaline earth metals to reverse direction after barium.|$|R

Every previous group 14 element has four electrons in its valence shell, forming a valence electron configuration of ns2np2. In flerovium's case, the trend will be continued and the valence electron configuration is predicted to be 7s27p2; flerovium will behave similarly to its lighter congeners in many respects. Differences are likely to arise; a largely contributing effect is the spin–orbit (SO) interaction—the mutual interaction between the electrons' motion and spin. It is especially strong for the superheavy elements, because their electrons move faster than in lighter atoms, at velocities comparable to the speed of light.
