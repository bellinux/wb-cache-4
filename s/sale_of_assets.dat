The Twin Otter was sold in January 2005 for US$850,000, and the <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> from the airline's offices in Nukuʻalofa and abroad netted US$71,000 and US$8,000 respectively.|$|E

25|$|According to the CBO, {{the major}} reason for {{observed}} rise in unequal distribution of after-tax income {{was an increase in}} market income, that is household income before taxes and transfers. Market income for a household is a combination of labor income (such as cash wages, employer-paid benefits, and employer-paid payroll taxes), business income (such as income from businesses and farms operated solely by their owners), capital gains (profits realized from the <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> and stock options), capital income (such as interest from deposits, dividends, and rental income), and other income. Of them, capital gains accounted for 80% of the increase in market income for the households in top 20%, in the 2000–2007 period. Even over the 1991–2000 period, according to the CBO, capital gains accounted for 45% of the market income for the top 20% households.|$|E

We distinguish between fire <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> by a dealer who, facing a run that could lead to default, sells securities to generate liquidity, and fire <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> by repo investors after a dealer's default has occurred. While fire sales do cause damage no matter how they arise, the tools available to lessen the harm from the two types <b>of</b> fire <b>sales</b> are different.

[...] The settlement reduced Thomas's claims by 93 percent, and Midway continued to operate as a Debtor in Possession. [...] Also on July 10, 2009, the <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> to Warner Bros. was completed. [...] The total gross purchase price for the sale was approximately $49 million, including receivables, and Warner Bros. assumed liabilities. [...] The sale also triggered payments under Midway's Key Employee Incentive Plan of approximately $2.4 million to company executives. [...] The Midway Chicago studio, responsible for the Mortal Kombat series and other games, became part of Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and was later rebranded NetherRealm Studios.|$|E
