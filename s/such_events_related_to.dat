40|$|Campi Flegrei is {{an active}} {{volcanic}} area posing a serious threat over Naples. Half of the city lies inside the caldera rim. The volcano has shown in the last 30 years different episodes of unrest, the most recent is still ongoing. For this reason the monitoring of this volcano is a fundamental task. The current seismic network consists of 8 short period and 5 broadband stations. The seismic monitoring is complemented by 2 infrasonic sensors and 3 dilatometers. The recent seismicity has been characterized by swarms of volcano-tectonic and long-period events. The network geometry allows an accurate location of VT events with a detection threshold of magnitudes less than 1. 0 Some VT events have been recorder also by the infrasonic sensors showing interesting similarities. LP events have been recorded by both short period and broadband stations. The polarization analysis performed over the broadband recordings is an important tool for the real time detection of <b>such</b> <b>events,</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> {{the dynamics of the}} hydrothermal system. The ongoing developments consists in a progressive increasing of the number of broadband digital stations and infrasonic sensors, in improving the accuracy of hypocenter locations by using a 3 D velocity model and in the implementation of new automatic techniques aimed at the detection, classification and analysis of seismic events...|$|E
40|$|Chloroform is a nongenotoxic-cytotoxic {{carcinogen}} in rodents. As <b>such,</b> <b>events</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> cytotoxicity are {{the driving}} force for cancer induction. In this paper we extended an existing physio-logically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for chloroform to describe a plausible mechanism linking the hepatic metabolism of chloroform to hepatocellular killing and regenerative prolifera-tion. The key aspects of this mechanism are (1) the production of damage at a rate proportional to the rate of metabolism predicted by the PBPK model, (2) the saturable repair of the damage, (3) the stimulation of the cell death rate by damage, and (4) the stimula-tion of the cell division rate {{as a function of}} the difference between the control and exposed numbers of cells. This extension allows the simulation of the labeling index and comparison with labeling index data. Data from a previously published chloroform-inhala-tion study with female B 6 C 3 F 1 mice that determined cytolethality and regenerative cellular proliferation following exposures of varying concentrations and exposure durations were used for model calibration. Both threshold and low-dose linear linkages between chloroform-induced damage and cell death rate provided visually good fits to the labeling index data after formal optimi-zation of the adjustable parameters, and there was no statistical difference between the fits of the two models to the data. Biolog-ically motivated computational modeling of chloroform-induced cytolethality and regenerative proliferation is a necessary step in the quantitative evaluation of the hypothesis that chloroform-stimulated cell proliferation predicts the rodent tumor response.

40|$|Prior to the 1980 s, {{arthropod}} {{pest control}} in Queensland strawberries was based entirely on calendar sprays of insecticides (mainly endosulfan, triclorfon, dimethoate and carbaryl) and a miticide (dicofol). These chemicals were applied frequently and spider mite outbreaks occurred every season. The concept of {{integrated pest management}} (IPM) had not been introduced to growers, and the suggestion that {{an alternative to the}} standard chemical pest control recipe might be available, was ignored. Circumstances changed when the predatory mite, Phytoseiulus persimilis Athios-Henriot, became available commercially in Australia, providing the opportunity to manage spider mites, the major pests of strawberries, with an effective biological agent. Trials conducted on commercial farms in the early 1980 s indicated that a revolution in strawberry pest management was at hand, but the industry generally remained sceptical and afraid to adopt the new strategy. Lessons are learnt from disasters and the consequent monetary loss that ensues, and in 1993, <b>such</b> an <b>event</b> <b>relating</b> <b>to</b> ineffective spider mite control, spawned the revolution we had to have.

Grand narratives, which grew exponentially in the mid-nineteenth century, have now been replaced by two different narratives: life narratives and small-scale narratives. He also discusses how small narratives have been expressed in emerging patterns of art, politics, and business; and describes an example of a research project that seeks to address some of the dilemmas present in life history work. The Learning Lives project, which is a large interdisciplinary project funded by the Economic and Social Research Council in Britain from 2004 - 2008, seeks to deepen understanding of the meaning and significance of informal learning in the lives of adults, and aims to identify ways in which the learning of adults can be supported and enhanced. To see learning as located within a life history is to understand that learning is contextually situated and that it also has a history, in terms of (a) the individual's life story, (b) the history and trajectories of the institutions that offer formal learning opportunities, and (c) the histories of the communities and locations in which informal learning takes place.

40|$|The {{peroxisome}} proliferator activated receptor gamma co-activator 1 alpha (PGC 1 α) is an inducible transcriptional co-activator {{with direct}} {{function in the}} induction of mitochondrial biogenesis. In the present report we show that, in SH-SY 5 Y neuroblastoma cells, garlic-derived diallyl disulfide (DADS) is able to increase PGC 1 α expression in a ROS-dependent manner and to induce mitochondrial biogenesis at early stage of treatment that precede cell cycle arrest and apoptosis outcome. In particular, we demonstrate that DADS elicits: i) the increase of PGC 1 α within nuclear compartment; ii) the decrease of PGC 1 α non-active acetylated form; iii) the induction of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes such as TFAM and TFBM 1. We also show an accumulation of PGC 1 α within mitochondria along with an increased association with the regulatory D-Loop region of mtDNA and a concomitant augmented expression of mitochondrial RNA. <b>Such</b> <b>events</b> are <b>related</b> <b>to</b> a prompt elevation of mitochondrial mass, as assessed by evaluating the content of mtDNA. We show that the induction of mitochondrial biogenesis is directed to dampen the cytotoxic effect of DADS. Indeed, PGC 1 α overexpression or down-regulation prevents or exacerbates mtDNA loss and apoptosis. Overall the data highlight an anti-apoptotic role of PGC 1 α-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis in neuroblatoma cells and suggest PGC 1 α as a potential target for enhancing the effectiveness of therapy in aggressive neuroblastoma with high drug-resistance...|$|R

40|$|Keel bone {{damage is}} a wide-spread welfare problem in laying hens. It is unclear so far whether bone quality <b>relates</b> <b>to</b> keel bone damage. The {{goal of the}} present study was to detect {{possible}} associations between keel bone damage and bone properties of intact and damaged keel bones and of tibias in end-of-lay hens raised in loose housing systems. Bones were palpated and examined by peripheral quantitative computer tomography (PQCT), a three-point bending test, and analyses of bone ash. Contrary to our expectations, PQCT revealed higher cortical and trabecular contents in fractured than in intact keel bones. This might be due to structural bone repair after fractures. Density measurements of cortical and trabecular tissues of keel bones did not differ between individuals with and without fractures. In the three-point bending test of the tibias, ultimate shear strength was significantly higher in birds with intact vs. fractured keel bones. Likewise, birds with intact or slightly deviated keel bones had higher mineral and calcium contents of the keel bone than birds with fractured keel bones. Calcium content in keel bones was correlated with calcium content in tibias. Although there were some associations between bone traits <b>related</b> <b>to</b> bone strength and keel bone damage, other factors <b>such</b> as stochastic <b>events</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> housing <b>such</b> as falls and collisions seem to be at least as important for the prevalence of keel bone damage...|$|R

In this paper, we describe a 7 -month exploratory monitoring programme in Dublin Port, demonstrating the value of high frequency data in enhancing knowledge of processes, informing discrete sampling, and ultimately increasing the efficiency of port and environmental management. Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney tests were used to show that shipping operating in Dublin Port has a small–medium effect on turbidity readings collected by in situ sensors. Turbidity <b>events</b> are largely <b>related</b> <b>to</b> vessel activity in Dublin Port, caused by re-suspension of sediments by vessel propulsion systems. The magnitudes of <b>such</b> <b>events</b> are strongly <b>related</b> <b>to</b> water level and tidal state at vessel arrival times.

An integrated account of CTs thus needs to explain how they come to appeal to potential believers, how they spread from one person to the next via communication, and how they motivate collective action. We summarize these aspects under the labels of stick, spread, and action. We propose the Quasi-Religious Hypothesis for CTs: drawing on cognitive science of religion, social representations theory and frame theory. We use cognitive science of religion to describe the main features of the content of CTs that explain how they come to stick: CTs are quasi-religious representations in that their contents, forms and functions parallel those found in beliefs of institutionalized religions. However, CTs are quasi-religious in that CTs and the communities that support them, lack many of the institutional features of organized religions. We use social representations theory to explain how CTs spread as devices for making sense of sudden events that threaten existing worldviews. CTs allow laypersons <b>to</b> interpret <b>such</b> <b>events</b> by <b>relating</b> them <b>to</b> common sense, thereby defusing some of the anxiety that those events generate.

40|$|Abstract. Lakes Prespa and Ohrid, in the Balkan region, are {{considered}} to be amongst the oldest lakes in Europe. Both lakes are hydraulically connected via karst aquifers. From Lake Ohrid, several sediment cores up to 15 m long have been studied over the last few years. Here, we document the first long sediment record from nearby Lake Prespa to clarify the influence of Lake Prespa on Lake Ohrid and the environmental history of the region. Radiocarbon dating and dated tephra layers provide robust age control and indicate that the 10. 5 m long sediment record from Lake Prespa reaches back to 48 ka. Glacial sedimentation is characterized by low organic matter content and absence of carbonates in the sediments, which indicate oligotrophic conditions in both lakes. Holocene sedimentation is characterized by particularly high carbonate content in Lake Ohrid and by particularly high organic matter content in Lake Prespa, which indicates a shift towards more mesotrophic conditions in the latter. Long-term environmental change and short-term <b>events,</b> <b>such</b> as <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the Heinrich <b>events</b> during the Pleistocene or the 8. 2 ka cooling event during the Holocene, are well recorded in both lakes, but are only evident in certain proxies.

40|$|Reading the {{national}} history of Oman {{as a story}} constructed {{for the purpose of}} legitimize the status of the Al Bu Said dynasty, we can find omissions in its context a kind of oblivion to exclude irrelevant historical events to the purpose. In <b>such</b> oblivion, <b>events</b> <b>relating</b> <b>to</b> imams since late 19 ^ century and the Qays branch of the royal family are important to analyze the attitude of today's government of Oman toward legitimizing itself in the historical context. The imamate, politico-religious system based on the principle of the Ibadi islam, had ruled Oman interruptedly since mid 8 ^ century. According to its principle, any ruling powers except imamate could be denied as tyrants. Although starting as an imamate, rulers of the Al Bu Said dynasty changed their status into the secular monarch around late 18 ^ century, and further, from late 19 ^ to mid 20 ^ century, had attacked imamates which revived in 1868 and existed in the mountain range until mid 20 ^ century. Today's ruler of Oman, sultan Qabus is one of descendants such secular rulers. From the fact that the majority of Omani population is Ibadi followers even today, it is supposed that some of Ibadi principles and Ibadi historical views, irrelevant to the Omani government such as tyrant of secular monarch, could be shared by many Omanis and this could create instability of {{the national}} integration of Oman under sultan Qabus. To avoid this situation, the national history of Oman which was constructed by its government excluded <b>events</b> <b>relating</b> <b>to</b> imams since late 19 ^ century. This made further exclusions, i. e., the information about members of royal family. The imamate revival movement had supported by the Qays branch of royal family. Candidates for imam from late 18 ^ to 19 ^ century appeared from this branch, and the Qays branch was so strong that it could rule northern part of Oman and gain the independent status from the secular monarch of Muscat. Excluding the memory of Qays branch, the national history of Oman could avoid narrating not only the imamate story but also the insufficient power of Muscat to rule all Oman which may be required to demonstrate its legitimacy. Although, these oblivions of {{members of the royal family}} and imamate history makes the national history something vacant aside from Al Bu Said secular rulers. To fill this vacancy, the national history of Oman narrates stories concerning to foreign issues, such as the conquest of the coastal area in the East Africa and the dispatch of a courier to the United States, and relationship with France. As a result, the national history of Oman was constructed to legitimate its ruler in the context not of indigenous but of external stories. ...|$|R

That is, the event time (EvT) is anchored to the utterance time (UttT) or some other reference time (RefT) (Enç 1987). In this paper we focus on root sentences where events are anchored to the utterance. When we talk about <b>such</b> <b>events,</b> we <b>relate</b> them <b>to</b> the utterance by asserting when, relative to the utterance, the event happened.

40|$|Increasingly, {{communities}} in regional areas {{are turning to}} sports events of a small scale to bring new money into their local economy, provide employment, and provide intangible benefits such as increased community pride. Sports events held on an irregular basis can attract visitors from outside a host community, thus resulting {{in an increase in}} business during slow periods and possibly promote the host region as a tourist destination after an event has been staged. In many instances, sponsorship has proven to be the financial lifeblood of sport tourism events held in regional areas, and often provides a majority of the revenue necessary to sustain the successful staging of <b>such</b> <b>events.</b> Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) frequently provide the sponsorship necessary to stage <b>such</b> <b>events,</b> owing to the fact that large businesses are sparse in regional areas. The academic community has paid little attention to the sponsorship nexus between SMEs and regional sport tourism events, which this study aimed to address. Grounded in the interpretivist social sciences paradigm, this qualitative study examined five case studies through interviewing five SME owner/managers and five managers of regional sport tourism events. Areas examined included perceptions of sponsorship, reasons why SMEs provided sponsorship to regional sport tourism events, sponsorship leveraging, evaluation of sponsorship effectiveness, and how sponsorships were initiated between SMEs and regional sport tourism events. The results of this research found that the event managers and SME sponsors shared differing perceptions of what constitutes ‘sponsorship’. Volunteer event managers tended to view sponsorship in a somewhat philanthropic manner, while professional event managers were well {{aware of the importance of}} reciprocating a return on investment to their sponsors. Sponsorships in this context were initiated either through formal request or networks of personal contacts between SMEs and event organising committees. The sponsorships studied were found to be highly informal in nature and bound by gentlemen’s agreements, as opposed to legally binding contracts. The primary reasons driving SMEs <b>to</b> sponsor <b>such</b> <b>events</b> were <b>related</b> <b>to</b> supporting their local community and to be seen as socially responsible. Engaging in sponsorship to achieve bottom-line objectives were secondary to community involvement, which confirmed findings from similar studies conducted previously. The results also indicated that sponsorship leveraging and evaluation of sponsorship effectiveness did occur, albeit with varying degrees of success. Both sponsors and event managers tended to exhibit low levels of proficiency in being able to carry out effective sponsorship leveraging and evaluations, and as such leveraging and evaluation techniques employed in these sponsorships tended to be unsophisticated and inexpensive to execute.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the multidisciplinary RECS project and with the aim of describing the particle flux transfer from the continental shelf to the deep basin, an array of five mooring lines equipped with a total of five pairs of PPS 3 / 3 sequential-sampling sediment traps and RCM- 7 / 8 current meters were deployed 30 m above the bottom from March 2003 to March 2004 inside and outside the Blanes Canyon. One mooring line was located in the upper canyon at 600 m depth, one in the canyon axis at 1700 m depth and other two close to the canyon walls at 900 m depth. A fifth mooring line was deployed in the continental open slope at 1500 m water depth. The highest near-bottomdownwardparticle flux (14. 50 g m- 2 d- 1) wasrecorded at the trap located in the upper canyon (M 1), where continental inputs associated with the presence of the Tordera River are most relevant. On the other hand, the downward fluxes (4. 35 g m- 2 d- 1) in the canyon axis (M 2) were of the same order as those found in the western flank (M 3) of the canyon. Both values were clearly higher than the value (1. 95 g m- 2 d- 1) recorded at the eastern canyon wall (M 4). The open slope (M 5) mass flux (5. 42 mg m- 2 d- 1) recorded by the sediment trap located outside the canyon system was three orders of magnitude lower than the other values registered by the inner canyon stations. The relevance of our data is that it explains how the transport pathway in the canyon occurs through its western flank, where a more active and persistent current toward the open ocean was recorded over the entire year of the experiment. Off-shelf sediment transport along the canyon axis showed clear differences during the period of the study, with some important events leading to strong intensifications of the current coupled with large transport of particle fluxes to the deepest parts of the canyon. <b>Such</b> <b>events</b> are primarily <b>related</b> <b>to</b> increases in river discharge and the occurrence of strong storms and cascading events during the winter. In summary, in this study it is shown that the dynamics of thewater masses and the currents in the study area convert the sharp western flank of the Blanes Canyon in a more active region that favors erosion processes than the eastern flank, which has a smoother topography and where the absence of erosional conditions yields to steadier sedimentary processes.
