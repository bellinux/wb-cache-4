40|$|Our {{purpose was}} to {{characterize}} the risks of osteoporosis-related <b>subtrochanteric</b> fractures in bisphosphonate-naive individuals. Baseline characteristics of patients enrolled in the HORIZON-Recurrent Fracture Trial with a study-qualifying hip fracture were examined, comparing those who sustained incident <b>subtrochanteric</b> fractures with those sustaining other hip fractures. Subjects were bisphosphonate-naive or had a bisphosphonate washout period of 6 - 24  months and subsequently received an annual infusion of zoledronic acid 5  mg or placebo after low-trauma hip-fracture repair. In total, 2, 127 {{men and women were}} included. Of the qualifying hip fractures, 5. 2 % were <b>subtrochanteric,</b> 54. 8 % femoral neck, 33. 0 % intertrochanteric, and 7. 1 % other (generally complex fractures of mixed type). Significant baseline (pre-hip fracture) differences were seen between index hip-fracture types, with the percentage of patients with extreme mobility problems being twofold higher in patients with index <b>subtrochanteric</b> fracture (9. 9 %) compared to other patients. The distribution of hip-fracture types was similar between the treatment groups at baseline. No patients with index <b>subtrochanteric</b> fractures and six patients with other qualifying hip fractures reported prior bisphosphonate use. Only one further <b>subtrochanteric</b> fracture occurred in each treatment group over an average 2 -year patient follow-up. <b>Subtrochanteric</b> fractures are not uncommon in bisphosphonate-naive patients.

Case series suggest a potential link between prolonged use of bisphosphonates and low-energy fracture of <b>subtrochanteric</b> or diaphyseal femur {{as a consequence of}} oversuppression of bone resorption. Using health care utilization data, we conducted a propensity score–matched cohort study to examine the incidence rates (IRs) and risk of <b>subtrochanteric</b> or diaphyseal femur fractures among oral bisphosphonate users compared with raloxifene or calcitonin users. A Cox proportional hazards model evaluated the risk of these fractures associated with duration of osteoporosis treatment. A total of 104 <b>subtrochanteric</b> or diaphyseal femur fractures were observed among 33, 815 patients. The estimated IR of <b>subtrochanteric</b> or diaphyseal femur fractures per 1000 person-years was 1. 46 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 11 – 1. 88] among the bisphosphonate users and 1. 43 (95 % CI 1. 06 – 1. 89) among raloxifene/calcitonin users. No significant association between bisphosphonate use and <b>subtrochanteric</b> or diaphyseal femur fractures was found [hazard ratio (HR) = 1. 03, 95 % CI 0. 70 – 1. 52] compared with raloxifene/calcitonin.

40|$|Background: Comminuted <b>subtrochanteric</b> {{fractures}} {{have been}} a challenge for orthopedic {{surgeons in terms of}} appropriate reduction and stable fixation. Numerous methods have been used for the fixation of comminuted <b>subtrochanteric</b> fractures among which some are accompanied with technical difficulties and complications of their own. Regarding the results of previous studies, we decided to evaluate the biological fixation method in comminuted <b>subtrochanteric</b> fractures. Methods: In this prospective study, we evaluated 20 men with comminuted <b>subtrochanteric</b> femoral fractures. The patients underwent indirect reduction with dynamic hip screw (DHS) or dynamic condylar screw (DCS) fixation within one week of injury. The patients were evaluated clinically for pain, hip and knee range of motion, leg-length discrepancy and angular and rotational deformities, in addition the radiographic assessment of the union. Results: According to Seinsheimer's classification of <b>subtrochanteric</b> fractures, four patients had type III, nine had type IV and seven had type V fractures. Fracture fixation was performed by DCS in eight and by DHS in 12 cases. The average time of the operations was 79. 4 (ranging from 60 - 125) minutes. Mean blood loss was 634 (ranging from 340 - 1160) milliliters. Uneventfully, union occurred in all patients with no clinical pain or dysfunction. Conclusion: Submuscular plating with either DCS or DHS is a viable option to treat comminuted <b>subtrochanteric</b> fractures.

Clinical case reports/reviews and case-control studies report this association, but retrospective phase III trial analyses show no increased risk. Bisphosphonate use {{may be associated with}} atypical <b>subtrochanteric</b> fractures, but the case is yet unproven. INTRODUCTION: A Working Group of the European Society on Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis and the International Osteoporosis Foundation has reviewed {{the evidence for}} a causal association between <b>subtrochanteric</b> fractures and long-term treatment with bisphosphonates, with the aim of identifying areas for further research and providing recommendations for physicians. METHODS: A PubMed search of literature from 1994 to May 2010 was performed using key search terms, and articles pertinent to <b>subtrochanteric</b> fractures following bisphosphonate use were analysed. RESULTS: Several clinical case reports and case reviews report a possible association between atypical fractures at the <b>subtrochanteric</b> region of the femur in bisphosphonate-treated patients. Common features of these 'atypical' fractures include prodromal pain, occurrence with minimal/no trauma, a thickened diaphyseal cortex and transverse fracture pattern. Some small case-control studies report the same association, but a large register-based study and retrospective analyses of phase III trials of bisphosphonates do not show an increased risk of <b>subtrochanteric</b> fractures with bisphosphonate use. The number of atypical <b>subtrochanteric</b> fractures in association with bisphosphonates is an estimated one per 1, 000 per year. It is recommended that physicians remain vigilant in assessing their patients treated with bisphosphonates for the treatment or prevention of osteoporosis and advise patients of the potential risks.

30|$|Borden et al. [8] {{presented}} a <b>subtrochanteric</b> valgization osteotomy, {{which is a}} perpendicular osteotomy in the <b>subtrochanteric</b> region just distal to the lesser trochanter. They introduced the concept of end-to-side valgization osteotomy in cases of infantile coxa vara, which presents only a minimal risk of head necrosis due to its extra-articular approach and lack of medialization of the distal femoral shaft. It also requires only one osteotomy with easier insertion of the angled plate, making it less technically demanding than the standard intertrochanteric technique [2]. Percutaneous <b>subtrochanteric</b> osteotomy with external fixation has been reported {{as an alternative to}} internal fixation [9], but that study included only limited follow-up.|$|E
30|$|Successful {{treatment}} of <b>subtrochanteric</b> fractures depends on stable osteosynthesis. However, because <b>subtrochanteric</b> fractures are often comminuted, stable internal fixation {{can be difficult}} to achieve [10]. Also, these fractures extend into diaphyseal bone, which has decreased vascularity and, therefore, poorer healing potential [2]. This predisposes internal fixation of these fractures to high rate of failure. Kyle reported that the compression strains are considerably greater than the tension strains [1]. These large stresses on the medial cortex in the <b>subtrochanteric</b> area make cortical restoration at the time of surgery mandatory to prevent cyclic loading and failure of any device used on the tension side of the femur [10].|$|E

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the risk of <b>subtrochanteric</b> and diaphyseal femur fractures and the persistence of this risk after discontinuation among elderly alendronate users in Taiwan. Methods: This is a population-based, nested case–control study collecting data from the Taiwan's National Health Insurance. The study population consisted of patients aged 65 years or older who were first diagnosed with osteoporosis between 2001 and 2008. Cases of <b>subtrochanteric</b> femoral fractures were defined as such if these individuals were hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of <b>subtrochanteric</b> or diaphyseal femur fractures during the study period. Based on risk-set control sampling, 10 matched controls for each case by age, sex, cohort entry year, and the comorbidities of stroke, diabetes mellitus, and osteoarthritis were obtained. Results: A total of 2859 patients (mean age, 76. 0  ±  6. 7 years; 82 % females) with <b>subtrochanteric</b> femoral fractures were identified. Cases were more likely to use antiosteoporosis drugs, and they tend to use alendronate longer (mean, 236 days vs. 215 days), with higher defined daily dose (243. 28 vs. 219. 95) than controls. Use of alendronate significantly increased the risk for <b>subtrochanteric</b> femoral fractures: 0 – 3 years of follow-up [adjusted odds ratio (OR), 1. 74; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 47 – 2. 06], 3 – 5 years of follow-up (adjusted OR, 1. 74; 95 % CI, 1. 35 – 2. 24), and > 5 years of follow-up (adjusted OR, 1. 50; 95 % CI, 1. 09 – 2. 07). Use of alendronate for > 1 year significantly increased the risk of <b>subtrochanteric</b> femoral fractures (adjusted OR, 1. 64; 95 % CI, 1. 44 – 1. 87); such association persisted longer than expected (3 – 5 years of follow-up: adjusted OR, 1. 67; 95 % CI, 1. 27 – 2. 19; > 5 years: adjusted OR, 1. 50; 95 % CI, 1. 07 – 2. 11).

40|$|Background: Trochanteric {{fractures}} {{of femur}} like intertrochanteric and <b>subtrochanteric</b> fractures are a {{leading cause of}} hospital admissions in elderly people. Conservative methods of treatment results in malunion with shortening and limitation of hip movement as well as complications of prolonged immobilizations such as bed sores, deep vein thrombosis, and respiratory infections. This study is done to analyze the surgical management of trochanteric fractures of the femur using a proximal femoral nail (PFN). Methodology: This is a prospective study of 40 cases of trochanteric and <b>subtrochanteric</b> fractures admitted to Government General Hospital, Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh. Cases were taken according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, i. e., patients with trochanteric fractures femur above the age of 20 years. Medically unsuitable, open fractures and patients not willing for surgery were excluded from the study. Results: Forty percentage of cases were admitted due to slip and fall and with a slight predominance of the right side. Out of 40 cases, 26 were trochanteric, and 14 were <b>subtrochanteric.</b> In trochanteric class, 37. 5 % were body and griffin Type 2, in <b>subtrochanteric</b> class 12. 5 % were sinsheimer Type 3 a and 10 % were 2 b.
