60|$|After all, <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> him unlucky? He {{had escaped}} the snare I had laid for him, and perhaps (such things have been) even a Newnham jury might find him not guilty.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no" [...] gruffly {{answered}} Judge Pyncheon with a harsh frown, {{while his}} brow grew almost a black purple, {{in the shadow}} of the room. [...] "Why <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> you back? Time flies! Bid Clifford come to me!" ...|$|E

"What, then, has led you blindly into snares, {{where all}} your boasted aid would avail you nothing? for, <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> aloud your name, even here, {{in the dark}} and dreary {{passages}} of this obscure edifice, the cry would echo through the country ere the morning, and a whole people would be found in arms to punish your audacity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> you mad," [...] {{returned}} Estella, [...] "I, of all people? Does any one live, {{who knows}} what set purposes you have, half as well as I do? Does any one live, {{who knows what}} a steady memory you have, half as well as I do? I who have sat on this same hearth on the little stool that is even now beside you there, learning your lessons and looking up into your face, when your face was strange and frightened me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why hasn't it been ideal?" [...] he asked. [...] "Kenby is tremendously in {{love with}} her; and I believe she's had a fancy for him from the beginning. If it hadn't been for Rose she would have {{accepted}} him at once; and now he's essential to them both in their helplessness. As for Papa Triscoe and his Europeanized scruples, {{if they have any}} reality at all they're the residuum of his personal resentment, and Kenby and Mrs. Adding {{have nothing to do with}} their unreality. His being {{in love with}} her is no reason why he shouldn't be helpful to her when she needs him, and every reason why he <b>should.</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> it a poem, such as very few people have the luck to live out together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sure," [...] cried Catherine, [...] "I did {{not mean}} to say {{anything}} wrong; but it is a nice book, and why <b>should</b> not <b>I</b> <b>call</b> it so?" ...|$|R

6000|$|The high-spirited entreaties of Eveline, unbent by {{adversity}} and want, gradually lost {{effect on}} the defenders of the castle; and proposals for surrender were urged and discussed by a tumultuary council, into which not only the inferior officers, {{but many of the}} common men, had thrust themselves, as in a period of such general distress as unlooses all the bonds of discipline, and leaves each man at liberty to speak and act for himself. To their surprise, in the midst of their discussions, Damian de Lacy, arisen from the sick-bed to which he had been so long confined, appeared among them, pale and feeble, his cheek tinged with the ghastly look which is left by long illness--he leaned on his page Amelot. [...] "Gentlemen," [...] he said, [...] "and soldiers--yet why <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> you either?--Gentlemen are ever ready to die in behalf of a lady-- soldiers hold life in scorn compared to their honour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After {{the loss}} of the boy I turned upon the Hurons, as you may judge. There have been scrimmages atween one or two of their outlyers and myself; but that is neither here nor there. So, after I had shot the imps, I got in pretty nigh to the lodges without further commotion. Then what should luck do in my favor, but lead me to the very spot where {{one of the most famous}} conjurers of the tribe was {{dressing}} himself, as I well knew, for some great battle with Satan--though why <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> that luck, which it now seems was an especial ordering of Providence! So a judgmatical rap over the head stiffened the lying impostor for a time, and leaving him a bit of walnut for his supper, to prevent an uproar, and stringing him up atween two sapplings, I made free with his finery, and took the part of the bear on myself, in order that the operations might proceed." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{people where}} we were now were not so rich in gold as those {{where we were}} before, but we found them much better stored with provisions; for besides deer, of which they had great plenty and variety, for they had some of a sort which I had never seen before, and besides an {{infinite}} number of those rabbits I have mentioned, which were as big as our hares, and which do not burrow in the ground as our rabbits do, they had also a kind of sheep, large, (like those of Peru, where they are used to carry burdens), and very good. They have no wool nor horns, but are rather hairy like a goat; nor <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> them sheep, but that their flesh eats like mutton, and I knew not what else to call them. The natives called them huttash; but what breed, or from what part of the world, or whether peculiar to this division alone, I know not.|$|E

6000|$|I {{have spoken}} {{of my father}} only as he then {{appeared}} to me, a child--an older chum with many lines about his mobile mouth, the tumbled hair edged round with grey; but looking back with older eyes, I see him a slightly stooping, yet still tall and graceful man, {{with the face of}} a poet--the face I mean a poet ought to possess but rarely does, nature apparently abhorring the obvious--with the shy eyes of a boy, and a voice tender as a woman's. Never the dingiest little drab that entered the kitchen but adored him, speaking always of [...] "the master" [...] in tones of fond proprietorship, for to the most slatternly his [...] "orders" [...] had ever the air of requests for favours. Women, I so often read, can care for only masterful men. But may there not be variety in women as in other species? Or perhaps--if the suggestion be not over-daring--the many writers, deeming themselves authorities upon this subject of woman, may in this one particular have erred? I only know my father spoke to few women whose eyes did not brighten. Yet hardly <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> him a masterful man.|$|E
60|$|When I {{found that}} I could not turn the screw I {{began to be}} much alarmed. Here I was, {{dangling}} in the air, without any means of reaching the ground. I could not expect my wife to return to look for me, as she would naturally suppose I had stopped to speak to some one. I thought of loosening myself from the knapsack, but this would not do, for I should fall heavily, and either kill myself or break some of my bones. I did not dare to call for assistance, for {{if any of the}} simple-minded inhabitants of the town had discovered me floating in the air they would have taken me for a demon, and would probably have shot at me. A moderate breeze was blowing, and it wafted me gently down the street. If it had blown me against a tree I would have seized it, and have endeavored, so to speak, to climb down it; but there were no trees. There was a dim street-lamp here and there, but reflectors above them threw their light upon the pavement, and none up to me. On many accounts I was glad that the night was so dark, for, much as I desired to get down, I wanted no one to see me in my strange position, which, to any one but myself and wife, would be utterly unaccountable. If I could rise as high as the roofs I might get on one of them, and, tearing off an armful of tiles, so load myself that I would be heavy enough to descend. But I did not rise to the eaves of any of the houses. If there had been a telegraph-pole, or anything of the kind that I could have clung to, I would have taken off the knapsack, and would have endeavored to scramble down as well as I could. But there was nothing I could cling to. Even the water-spouts, if I could have reached the face of the houses, were embedded in the walls. At an open window, near which I was slowly blown, I saw two little boys going to bed by the light of a dim candle. I was dreadfully afraid that they would see me and raise an alarm. I actually came so near to the window that I threw out one foot and pushed against the wall with such force that I went nearly across the street. I thought I caught sight of a frightened look on the face of one of the boys; but of this I am not sure, and I heard no cries. I still floated, dangling, down the street. What was to be done? <b>Should</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> out? In that case, if I were not shot or stoned, my strange predicament, and the secret of my invention, would be exposed to the world. If I did not do this, I must either let myself drop and be killed or mangled, or hang there and die. When, {{during the course of the}} night, the air became more rarefied, I might rise higher and higher, perhaps to an altitude of one or two hundred feet. It would then be impossible for the people to reach me and get me down, even if they were convinced that I was not a demon. I should then expire, and when the birds of the air had eaten all of me that they could devour, I should forever hang above the unlucky town, a dangling skeleton with a knapsack on its back.|$|E
5000|$|So you’ve {{become a}} “Great King,” have you? But {{why do you}} still {{continue}} to speak about “brotherhood” and about coming to Mt. Ammana?... For what reason <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> you “brother”?…Do {{those who are not}} on familiar terms with each other call each other “brother”? Why then <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> you “brother”? Were you and I born of the same mother? As my grandfather and my father did not call the King of Assyria “brother,” you should not keep writing to me (about) “coming” and “Great King-ship.” It displeases me. Urhi Teššup ...|$|E

Track 5, Make My Day, makes extensive use of Auto-Tune effects. The last track, Every Morning is the acoustic guitar version of the first track Morning.|$|E
5000|$|UKIP leader Nigel Farage {{referred}} to the matter {{in the context of}} the upcoming British European Union referendum.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} for Science Watch (October 2010), Nathan revealed that the idea to establish Movement Ecology as a new field of research was born in 2002, {{when he was a}} first-year faculty member supervising one student on seed dispersal and another on bird migration, facing the question “what name <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> my research group”? This has led him to wonder why different movement phenomena are studied in isolation from each other, and why there is still no general unifying theory of organismal movement. He then decided to call his research group [...] "movement ecology", and later on noticed this term has already been used in the literature, but very occasionally at the time and never {{in the context of a}} unifying research paradigm.|$|E

The song was so popular that for 5 weeks it stayed in the Top 50 on Radio “Signal Plus”. On 31 August, her new song “Да ти Викна ли Такси” (<b>Should</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> you a Taxi) was leaked, and the video for the song was soon {{released}} on September 11.
