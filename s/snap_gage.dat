50|$|A <b>snap</b> <b>gage</b> {{is a form}} of go/no go gauge. It is a {{limit gage}} with {{permanently}} or temporarily fixed measurement aperture(s) (gaps) which is used to quickly verify whether an outside dimension of a part matches a preset dimension or falls within predefined tolerances.|$|E
50|$|Some vendors who resell a {{different}} measuring instrument, bore gauge, muddy the waters {{by referring to}} them as snap gages, unlike the manufacturer who uses the correct nomenclature. Unlike a <b>snap</b> <b>gage,</b> these measure inside (bore) dimensions, not outside dimensions, and are usually reset for each part measured.|$|E
50|$|Snap gages {{facilitate}} making interchangeable parts. Snap gages {{have been}} in existence and referred to by that name since at least 1898. In a manufacturing plant, snap gages would normally be re-calibrated at scheduled intervals. Often, snap gages will be calibrated by skilled workers and used by semi-skilled workers; the <b>snap</b> <b>gage</b> is faster than a micrometer and requires less skill to use correctly.|$|E
5000|$|The {{surfaces}} which {{define the}} edges of the aperture are the anvils, which may be made of separate pieces of hard material such as tungsten carbide for wear resistance. Two apertures are frequently used to provide Go/No-Go testing and are often arranged such that a part being measured can pass through the two apertures in sequence; a part that is within tolerance will pass through the first maximum size limit aperture but {{will not be able to}} pass through the minimum size limit aperture. A snap gauge usually has a [...] "C" [...] shaped frame with the aperture(s) at the opening of the [...] "C". <b>Snap</b> <b>gages</b> may be machined and ground out of a single block of metal or adjustable <b>snap</b> <b>gages,</b> which have movable anvils that may be adjusted over a limited range of sizes, may be used. They may also be of built up construction in which one or more gage blocks or feeler gauges are sandwiched between two anvils. Adjustable <b>snap</b> <b>gages</b> may be reset to compensate for wear or re-tasked for measuring a different dimension and can be purchased off the shelf and set rather than needing to be fabricated from scratch when a new gage is needed. Gauge blocks would typically be used to initially set the width of the measuring aperture(s).|$|R
50|$|A {{variation}} is the snap indicator gage, which incorporates {{a dial indicator}} or electronic digital indicator {{as one of the}} anvils. This indicator displays the deviation from the preset dimension and the indicator may have high and low tolerance limits marked by means of two extra needles, alteration of the dial face, or programming into an electronic indicator. Another variation adds, in addition to the dial or electronic indicator, a micrometer adjustment on the anvil opposite the indicator anvil. This may be referred to as a <b>snap</b> <b>gage</b> or an indicating micrometer and may be quickly preset for short runs of parts.|$|E
5000|$|Snap gauges {{are often}} used when a large {{quantity}} of work pieces must be inspected. The snap gauge has four anvils or jaws, the first one or pair (outermost) are set using the upper limit (tolerance) of the part and the inner set adjusted to the lower limit of the part. A correctly machined part will pass {{the first set of}} jaws and stop at the second [...] - [...] end of test. In this manner, a part may be checked in one action, unlike the plug gauge that needs to be used twice and flipped to access the second gauge. The first go/no-go <b>snap</b> <b>gage</b> for checking thread rolls was invented in 1943 to speed production of parts during WWII.|$|E
40|$|This bachelor’s thesis {{deals with}} {{measurement}} system analysis in Bühler Company. It {{is focused on}} proposal for a methodology for verification capability of gauges, data collection and evaluation of selected gauges. Selected gauges are analog bore gauge, digital bore gauge, dial <b>snap</b> <b>gage</b> and height gauge. The problem lies in the proposal task and especially in a practical verification methodology for the capability of gauges...|$|E
