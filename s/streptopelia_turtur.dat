40|$|Trichomonas gallinae is an {{emerging}} pathogen in wild birds, linked to recent declines in finch (Fringillidae) populations across Europe. Globally, the main hosts for this parasite are species of Columbidae (doves and pigeons); here {{we carry out}} the first investigation into the presence and incidence of Trichomonas in four species of Columbidae in the UK, through live sampling of wild-caught birds and subsequent PCR. We report the first known UK cases of Trichomonas infection in 86 % of European Turtle Doves <b>Streptopelia</b> <b>turtur</b> sampled, along with 86 % of Eurasian Collared Doves Streptopelia decaocto, 47 % of Woodpigeons Columba palumbus and 40 % of Stock Doves Columba oenas.

To ascertain whether trials of an agri-environment measure designed for a single species had wider biodiversity benefits, we describe monitoring of pollinators (bumblebees and butterflies) on plots of a novel seed mix aimed at providing a source of seed food throughout the breeding season for the rapidly declining European Turtle Dove <b>Streptopelia</b> <b>turtur.</b> We compare pollinator abundance on these turtle dove plots to that on six control habitat types: fallow, grass margins, meadow, nectar flower mixture, wild bird cover and floristically enhanced margins. The abundance of foraging bumblebees and butterflies was higher on turtle dove plots than in fallow and wild bird cover habitats. Surprisingly, foraging bumblebee abundance was higher, and foraging butterfly abundance marginally higher on turtle dove plots than on nectar flower mixture. Whilst the specific mix described here is to be altered to increase access to foraging turtle doves, we suggest that the modified mix, to be rolled out through Higher Level Stewardship, is also likely to provide valuable resources for pollinators, adding to the growing body of literature demonstrating multi-taxa benefits of agri-environment options designed to benefit one species...|$|E

Using miniaturized light-level geolocators we report a comprehensive and detailed year round track of a granivorous trans-Saharan migrant, the European Turtle Dove (<b>Streptopelia</b> <b>turtur).</b> From five recovered loggers, our data provide new insights on migratory journeys and winter destinations of Turtle Doves originating from a breeding population in Western France. Data confirm that Turtle Doves wintered in West Africa. The main wintering area encompassed Western Mali, the Inner Delta Niger and the Malian/Mauritanian border. Some individuals also extended their wintering ranges over North Guinea, North-West of Burkina Faso and the Ivory-Coast. Our results reveal that all individuals did not spend the winter period at a single location; some of them experienced a clear eastward shift of several hundred kilometres. We also found evidence for a loop migration pattern, with a post-breeding migration flyway lying west of the spring route. Finally, we found that on their way back to breeding grounds Turtle Doves needed to refuel after crossing the Sahara desert. Contrary to previous suggestions, our data reveal that birds used stopover sites for several weeks, presumably in Morocco and North Algeria.

In the present work a complete morphobiometrical study of two populations of the genus Tinaminyssus isolated from <b>Streptopelia</b> <b>turtur</b> and Streptopelia decaocto (Aves: Columbiformes) were carried out. Furthermore, the complete internal transcribed spacer 1, 5. 8 S gene and internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITSs) of the ribosomal DNA, and a fragment of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I (COI) from five taxa belonging to Tinaminyssus (Tinaminyssus sp. from S. turtur, Tinaminyssus sp. from S. decaocto, Tinaminyssus melloi, Tinaminyssus columbae and Tinaminyssus minisetosum) were sequenced to examine the level of sequence variation and its utility in phylogeny estimation. Our data show that these molecular markers can help to discriminate between species and populations included in the “melloi complex” (T. streptopeliae and T. streptopelioides), which are morphologically very close and difficult to separate by classic methods. A comparative study with sequences from other rhinonyssid mites previously published was also carried out. The resulting phylogenetic tree inferred from the ITSs and a fragment of the mitochondrial gene COI sequences obtained in this work, shows differences between populations of Tinaminyssus sp. from S. turtur and S. decaocto, so we can considerer they are different species.

European turtle doves <b>Streptopelia</b> <b>turtur</b> feed on seeds collected on the ground, and are readily attracted to supplementary provided grain at feeding stations. Supplementary feeding is a common management practice on hunting estates around the world. This {{study was conducted in}} 40 hunting estates located in central west Spain: 20 sites where supplementary food was provided to attract turtle doves and 20 control sites without feeding stations.

40|$|Background: Understanding how past climatic {{oscillations}} {{have affected}} organismic evolution will help predict {{the impact that}} current climate change has on living organisms. The European turtle dove, <b>Streptopelia</b> <b>turtur,</b> is a warm-temperature adapted species and a long distance migrant that uses multiple flyways to move between Europe and Africa. Despite being abundant, it is categorized as vulnerable because of a long-term demographic decline. We studied the demographic history and population genetic structure of the European turtle dove using genomic data and mitochondrial DNA sequences from individuals sampled across Europe, and performing paleoclimatic niche modelling simulations. Results: Overall our data suggest that this species is panmictic across Europe, and is not genetically structured across flyways. We found the genetic signatures of demographic fluctuations, inferring an effective population size (Ne) expansion that occurred between the late Pleistocene and early Holocene, followed by {{a decrease in the}} Ne that started between the mid Holocene and the present. Our niche modelling analyses suggest that the variations in the Ne are coincident with recent changes in the availability of suitable habitat. Conclusions: We argue that the European turtle dove is prone to undergo demographic fluctuations, a trait that makes it sensitive to anthropogenic impacts, especially when its numbers are decreasing. Also, considering the lack of genetic structure, we suggest all populations across Europe are equally relevant for conservation. Trabajo financiado por: Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.

40|$|Resumen del Workshop celebrado en el XXXth International Union of Game Biologists and Perdix XIII, celebrados en Barcelona (España) del 5 al 9 de septiembre de 2011. Biodiversity loss in Europe is {{critically}} associated to agricultural ecosystems. Recent statistics reported by SEO/Birdlife show that bird populations in Spanish agricultural land are declining during last years. Recent work with red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) in Central Spain and Navarra {{has shown that}} changes in agricultural landscapes and management techniques are the major drivers of long- and short-term wild population declines too, even in areas with such contrasting environmental features. Wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), hares (Lepus spp.), turtle dove (<b>Streptopelia</b> <b>turtur),</b> or common quail (Coturnix coturnix) population changes have also been associated to large-scale habitat changes, even in agricultural lands. Thus, agricultural changes are affecting not only overall biodiversity conservation, but also to game production, an important socio-economic activity in European rural environments. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has recently recognized these facts, and has tried to promote a better role of agriculture in biodiversity conservation through the crosscompliance measures and agri-environmental schemes. However, some implementation failures of these measures and programs have been recently reported too. CAP {{is going to be}} re-formulated again in 2013, so we are at a crucial time to develop sound, rational and feasible guidelines to improve relations between agriculture, game production, and biodiversity conservation in farming areas. This workshop will review available information about the topic, indentifying research subjects that need more attention, and proposing specific measures to improve CAP implementation.

This study investigated bird diversity in three oases of the Northern Algerian Sahara (i. e., Biskra in 2006, Oued Souf in 2008 and Ouargla in 2009), by using the spot-mapping method. Bird density “D” (pairs/ 10 ha), species richness “S” (number species), diversity (Shannon index) “H′” (in bits), and evenness “E” varied from one oasis to another (Biskra: D= 98. 5, S= 47, H′= 4. 49, E= 0. 81; Oued Souf: D= 96, S= 33, H′= 3. 9, E= 0. 77; Ouargla: D= 91. 5, S= 44, H′= 4. 39, E= 0. 80). Differences in bird diversity between the monitored palm groves are due to the ecological characteristics of each environment. Documented literature outlined close taxonomic similarities between bird assemblages {{of the study area}} with many Northern Saharan oases. The Hybrid Sparrow Passer domesticus x Passer. hispaniolensis and some Columbidae species including Columba livia, <b>Streptopelia</b> <b>turtur,</b> Streptopelia senegalensis, and Streptopelia decaocto were the abundant species throughout surveyed oases in which they represented more than half (55. 6 %) of the sum of species densities (D= 286 pairs/ 10 ha). These synthropic species have known a huge expansion of their distribution range throughout Algerian oases. The correspondence analysis allowed the aggregation of both families and species into oasis they belong to. One-way ANOVA was tested to analyse variations of both family and species densities between studied oases. The ANOVA revealed there was no significant variation either in family densities (p= 0. 937) or in bird densities (p= 0. 622) between the surveyed oases because of the small size of bird populations...|$|E
40|$|The Turtle Dove <b>Streptopelia</b> <b>turtur</b> arenicola (E Hartert, 1894) breeds from Morocco east to Tripoli, {{and from}} Iraq and Iran east through Afghanistan, Turkestan and Khirgiz steppes to {{northwest}} China (del Hoyo et al 1997). Within the Arabian peninsula {{it has been}} recorded breeding in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Oman and Yemen in addition to Bahrain. It has not been recorded breeding in Qatar though suitable habitat exists there (Jennings 2010). Turtle Doves are widespread and common migrants throughout Arabia.

Post breeding movements occur July–October {{and there is no}} evidence of wintering in Arabia (del Hoyo et al 1997, Beaman 2 ̆ 6 Madge 1998, Jennings 2010). The earliest record of breeding in Bahrain dates back to 1969, with additional records from 1982, 1985 and 1993 (Nightingale 2 ̆ 6 Hill 1993). The largest estimate was of 30 nests in Al Areen wildlife park in July 1985 (Nightingale 2 ̆ 6 Hill 1993). The colony monitored in the current study is immediately south of Al Areen wildlife park, in a group of mature desert broom Leptadenia pyrotechnica bushes, and may be the only Turtle Dove colony in Bahrain. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this breeding colony has been present annually for several decades at least, though recent evidence of birds breeding within the park was not available. The aims of the study were to gather information on the breeding parameters of this Turtle Dove colony, to estimate colony size and to conduct ringing of the chicks in the hope of getting recoveries to elucidate movement patterns of these Bahrain birds...|$|E
40|$|Disease {{is usually}} ignored as a {{potential}} driver of species decline. This is concerning since disease could have {{a greater impact on}} a species as it becomes vulnerable to other extinction risks. This thesis investigated Trichomonas gallinae infection in the UK’s fastest declining farmland bird, the European Turtle Dove <b>Streptopelia</b> <b>turtur.</b> It employed molecular techniques to acquire data on parasite prevalence and identify strains, and trialled the application of Next Generation Sequencing technology to disease surveillance. Overall, 50 adult Turtle Dove samples from 2011 - 2015 were analysed and temporal variation in strain frequency was revealed. A degree of population structure in T. gallinae infecting different Turtle Dove populations (France 2014, n= 40; Senegal, n= 28) was apparent, along with some evidence of wide-ranging parasite dispersal, indirectly through their host. The potential risk of shared resources as a transmission route of T. gallinae was investigated with 226 food and 117 water samples screened for its presence. Evidence suggested T. gallinae was regularly present in both food and water resources. This has important implications for supplementary feeding being a conservation management tool. The reservoir of T. gallinae in the UK was reviewed by sampling potential hosts of Columbidae (n= 166), Galliformes (n= 13) and Passeriformes (n= 90). The detection of strains other than the finch epidemic strain in free-ranging Passerines revealed a greater level of genetic heterogeneity than previously shown in other studies. There were no significant associations between T. gallinae strain infection or coinfection with haemosporidians and measures of reproduction, body condition or post-fledging survival in Turtle Doves however, sample sizes were small. Overall, this study increases our understanding of the epidemiology of T. gallinae both in the wider bird population and a species of Vulnerable conservation status. It demonstrates how T. gallinae infecting wild birds is a useful model for investigating aspects of host- parasite ecology and encourages further research with this system...|$|E

The European Turtle Dove <b>Streptopelia</b> <b>turtur</b> is an obligate granivorous bird in rapid decline within both the UK (− 96 % since 1970) and across continental Europe (− 77 % since 1980), despite widespread uptake of AES. Here, we assess the efficacy of a potentially new, sown agri-environment option designed to provide abundant, accessible seed for S. turtur during the breeding season. During summer 2011 we compared vegetation structure and seed provision on trial plots to control habitat types (existing agri-environment options thought to potentially provide S. turtur foraging habitat) to assess whether trial plots performed better for foraging S. turtur than control habitats. In September 2011 all trial plots were topped (cut) and half of a subset of trial plots were then scarified (60 % of soil surface disturbed). Vegetation structure on topped, and topped and scarified trial plots was measured during summer 2012 to determine which management regime was most effective in maintaining suitable sward structure and seed provision into the second year. No control habitat type produced as much seed important in S. turtur diet as trial plots at any point during year one. Trial plots provided accessible vegetation structure {{early in the season}} with no difference in vegetation metrics between trial plots and previously published data on S. turtur foraging locations. However, to allow later access, management is required during mid-June to open up the sward through localized topping or scarification. Vegetation structure during year two was generally too dense to attract foraging S. turtur. However, scarifying trial plots during the September following sowing encouraged self-seeding of Fumaria officinalis (a plant species historically forming a significant proportion of S. turtur diet during the breeding season) into the second year, with this species present in 16 % of scarified trial plots compared to only 4 % of topped trial plots during year two. Thus, autumn scarification, possibly followed by topping or scarification of part of the trial plots in June, is necessary for trial plots to provide more seed and access for S. turtur than existing agri-environment options during year two. We recommend modifications to our original seed mix in order to reduce vegetation density and improve vegetation structure. The study provides an example of the need to strike the right balance between food abundance and accessibility, through vegetation structure, when designing agri-environment scheme management options that provide food for birds...|$|E
