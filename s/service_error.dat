In the 2008 NCAA Tournament Nebraska was the No. 4 overall seed having a fairly easy time in the first and second rounds of the NCAA tournament. After making short work of Michigan in the NCAA regional semifinals, the Huskers advanced to the NCAA regional finals facing No. 5 overall seed Washington in Seattle on their home court. [...] After losing the first two sets, it looked as if Nebraska's season would end earlier than they wanted. That was, however, before Nebraska mounted one of the greatest comeback wins {{in the history of the}} NCAA tournament. In set 3, Nebraska rallied to easily take the set 25-17. In set 4, Nebraska looked well on its way to forcing a fifth set but it didn't turn out to be that easy as the Huskies trailed 22-21, and eventually tied the set at 23 and 24. However a Washington <b>service</b> <b>error</b> and a service ace from libero Kayla Banwarth gave the Huskers a 26-24 win in set 4, forcing a fifth set. In set 5, once again the Huskers looked doomed as they fell 9-3, but in a jaw-dropping run of epic proportions Nebraska went on to score 9 consecutive points to take the lead 12-9. Not giving up, the Huskies were able to tie the set at 13, before an attack error set up match point for the Huskers. Senior Jordan Larson ripped an ace paralyzing the Huskies and sending Nebraska into a frenzy at having completed one of the greatest comeback wins in both school and NCAA tournament history advancing the huskers to the Final Four at the Qwest Center in Omaha, the fifth Final Four appearance in the John Cook era. In the NCAA National Semifinals, Nebraska lost to No. 1 overall seed Penn State. Initially down 0-2, the Huskers rallied to deal the Nittany Lions their first 2 set losses of the season, snapping their NCAA record 111 consecutive set wins. In the 5th set, Penn State went on to win 15-11, and ultimately the National Championship over Stanford in straight sets.|$|E

50|$|Error {{codes are}} slowly disappearing from the programmer's {{environment}} as modern object-oriented programming languages {{replace them with}} exceptions. Exceptions {{have the advantage of}} being handled with explicit blocks of code, separate {{from the rest of the}} code. While it is considered poor practice in methodologies that use error codes and return codes to indicate failure, programmers often neglect to check return values for error conditions. That negligence can cause undesirable effects, as ignored error conditions often cause more severe problems later in the program. Exceptions are implemented in such a way as to separate the error handling code from the rest of the code. Separating the error handling code from the normal logic makes programs easier to write and understand, since one block of error handling code can <b>service</b> <b>errors</b> from any number of function calls. Exception handling also makes the code more readable than implementations with error codes, since exception handling does not disrupt the flow of the code with frequent checks for error conditions.|$|R

We propose an adaptive and domain-specific service monitoring approach to detect partner <b>service</b> <b>errors</b> in a cost-effective manner.

The detection of each type of error entails a different monitoring cost in terms of the consumed resources. To reduce costs, we adapt the monitoring frequency for each service and for each type of error based on the measured error rates and a cost model. We introduce an industrial case study from the broadcasting and content-delivery domain for improving the user-perceived reliability of Smart TV systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with real data collected to be relevant for a commercial TV portal application.
