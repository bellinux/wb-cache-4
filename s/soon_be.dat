5|$|As {{early as}} 1914, the British Admiral Percy Scott {{predicted}} that battleships would <b>soon</b> <b>be</b> made irrelevant by aircraft. By {{the end of}} World War I, aircraft had successfully adopted the torpedo as a weapon. In 1921 the Italian general and air theorist Giulio Douhet completed a hugely influential treatise on strategic bombing titled The Command of the Air, which foresaw the dominance of air power over naval units.|$|E

5|$|Researchers are {{investigating}} the clinical significance of c-KIT mutations in AML. These are prevalent, and potentially clinically relevant because {{of the availability of}} tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib and sunitinib that can block the activity of c-KIT pharmacologically. It is expected that additional markers (e.g., RUNX1, ASXL1, and TP53) that have consistently been associated with an inferior outcome will <b>soon</b> <b>be</b> included in these recommendations. The prognostic importance of other mutated genes (e.g., DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2) is less clear.|$|E

In particular, {{the development of the}} state and of the human body are parallel to each other, and England may <b>soon</b> <b>be</b> entering into a decline. However, Swift emphasises that man is imperfect, and that sin is a symbol of this imperfectness.|$|E

5|$|A large {{broadcasting}} {{tower was}} {{needed in the}} Kantō region after NHK, Japan's public broadcasting station, began television broadcasting in 1953.

This communications boom led the Japanese government to believe that transmission towers would <b>soon</b> <b>be</b> built all over Tokyo, eventually overrunning the city. The proposed solution was the construction of one large tower capable of transmitting to the entire region. Furthermore, because of the country's postwar boom in the 1950s, Japan was searching for a monument to symbolize its ascendancy as a global economic powerhouse.|$|E

5|$|According to Vrba's memoir, a Polish kapo by {{the name}} of Yup told him on 15 January 1944 that he was {{part of a group of}} prisoners who were {{building}} a new railway line that would lead straight into the crematoria. Yup said an SS officer had told a million Hungarian Jews would <b>soon</b> <b>be</b> arriving at Auschwitz. Vrba said he also overheard SS guards discuss how they would soon have Hungarian salami. When Jews from the Netherlands arrived, he wrote, they brought cheese, French Jews brought sardines and Greek Jews brought halva and olives. Now it was Hungarian salami. He had to escape not only for himself, he wrote, but also to raise the alarm.|$|E
5|$|Alsos {{interviewed the}} Italian Minister for Communications, the Chief of Naval Ordnance, {{the staff of}} the Italian Naval Academy, and Italian {{scientists}} at the University of Naples, and examined what captured technical documents could be found. There was little information about developments in northern Italy and Germany. The Alsos Mission was attached to Colonel George Smith's S-Force. Built around a Royal Air Force ground reconnaissance squadron equipped with armored cars, this unit contained American, British, French, and Italian technical specialists of various kinds who would enter Rome {{on the heels of the}} advancing Allied forces. The expectation that Rome would <b>soon</b> <b>be</b> captured proved premature, and by March 1944 most of the Alsos Mission had returned to the United States. The Alsos Mission had gathered little of value about nuclear matters, but submitted detailed reports about German rockets and guided missiles.|$|E

Transportation to and from Bermuda resumed in 1940, and Beebe returned there in May 1941, but the environment was slowly being transformed due to the war. The large number of military ships made docking difficult, most of the island's reefs were being destroyed in order to construct an airfield, and the combination of construction activity and pollution made observation of the sea life impossible. Appalled by the destruction, Beebe finally rented his station at Nonsuch Island to a military contractor and returned to New York.|$|E
