Polyols for rigid applications use high functionality initiators such as sucrose (f=8), sorbitol (f=6), toluenediamine (f=4), and Mannich bases (f=4). Propylene oxide and/or ethylene oxide {{is added to}} the initiators until the desired molecular weight is achieved. The order of addition and the amounts of each oxide affect many polyol properties, such as compatibility, water-solubility, and reactivity. Polyols made with only propylene oxide are terminated with secondary hydroxyl groups and are less reactive than polyols capped with ethylene oxide, which contain primary hydroxyl groups. Graft polyols (also called filled polyols or polymer polyols) contain finely dispersed <b>styrene–acrylonitrile,</b> acrylonitrile, or polyurea (PHD) polymer solids chemically grafted to a high molecular weight polyether backbone. They are used to increase the load-bearing properties of low-density high-resiliency (HR) foam, as well as add toughness to microcellular foams and cast elastomers. Initiators such as ethylenediamine and triethanolamine are used to make low molecular weight rigid foam polyols that have built-in catalytic activity due to the presence of nitrogen atoms in the backbone. [...] A special class of polyether polyols, poly(tetramethylene ether) glycols, which are made by polymerizing tetrahydrofuran, are used in high performance coating, wetting and elastomer applications.|$|E
50|$|Commercially {{relevant}} copolymers include {{acrylonitrile butadiene}} styrene (ABS), styrene/butadiene co-polymer (SBR), nitrile rubber, <b>styrene-acrylonitrile,</b> styrene-isoprene-styrene (SIS) and ethylene-vinyl acetate.|$|E
50|$|ASA is {{structurally}} {{very similar}} to ABS. The spherical particles of slightly crosslinked acrylate rubber (instead of butadiene rubber), functioning as an impact modifier, are chemically grafted with <b>styrene-acrylonitrile</b> copolymer chains, and embedded in <b>styrene-acrylonitrile</b> matrix. The acrylate rubber differs from the butadiene based rubber by absence of double bonds, which gives the material about ten times the weathering resistance and resistance to ultraviolet radiation of ABS, higher long-term heat resistance, and better chemical resistance. ASA is significantly more resistant to environmental stress cracking than ABS, especially to alcohols and many cleaning agents. n-Butyl acrylate rubber is usually used, but other esters can be encountered too, e.g. ethyl hexyl acrylate. The latter has lower glass transition temperature than the former, -65 °C vs -45 °C, providing better low-temperature properties to the material.|$|E

Dimerization of acrylonitrile affords adiponitrile, used in the synthesis of certain polyamides. Small amounts are also used as a fumigant. Acrylonitrile and derivatives, such as 2-chloro-acrylonitrile, are dienophiles in Diels-Alder reactions. Acrylonitrile is also a precursor in the industrial manufacture of acrylamide and acrylic acid.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are some}} general {{guidelines}} to follow {{when trying to}} determine a plastic's toughness from its chemical structure. Vinyl polymers like polystyrene and <b>styrene-acrylonitrile</b> tend to fail by crazing. They have low crack initiation and propagation energies. Polymers with aromatic backbones, such as polyethylene terephthalate and polycarbonate, tend to fail by shear yielding with high crack initiation energy but low propagation energy. Other polymers, including poly(methyl methacrylate) and polyacetal(polyoxymethylene), are not as brittle as [...] "brittle polymers" [...] and are also not as ductile as [...] "ductile polymers".|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} gauge the {{toughening}} effects of a dispersed secondary phase, {{it is important to}} understand the relevant characteristics of the continuous polymer phase. The mechanical failure characteristics of the pure polymeric continuous phase will strongly influence how rubber toughened polymer failure occurs. When a polymer usually fails due to crazing, rubber toughening particles will act as craze initiators. When it fails by shear yielding, the rubber particles will initiate shear bands. It is also possible to having multiple mechanisms come into play if the polymer is prone to failing by multiple stresses equally. Polystyrene and <b>styrene-acrylonitrile</b> are brittle materials that are prone to craze failure while polycarbonate, polyamides, and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) are prone to shear yield failure.|$|E

50|$|Polyacrylonitrile (PAN), {{also known}} as Creslan 61, is a synthetic, {{semicrystalline}} organic polymer resin, with the linear formula (C3H3N)n. Though it is thermoplastic, it does not melt under normal conditions. It degrades before melting. It melts above 300 °C if the heating rates are 50 degrees per minute or above. Almost all polyacrylonitrile resins are copolymers made from mixtures of monomers with acrylonitrile as the main component. It is a versatile polymer used to produce large variety of products including ultra filtration membranes, hollow fibers for reverse osmosis, fibers for textiles, oxidized PAN fibers. PAN fibers are the chemical precursor of high-quality carbon fiber. PAN is first thermally oxidized in air at 230 degrees Celsius to form an oxidized PAN fiber and then carbonized above 1000 degrees Celsius in inert atmosphere to make carbon fibers found {{in a variety of}} both high-tech and common daily applications such as civil and military aircraft primary and secondary structures, missiles, solid propellant rocket motors, pressure vessels, fishing rods, tennis rackets, badminton rackets & high-tech bicycles.

40|$|<b>Styrene-acrylonitrile</b> {{copolymers}}, {{like many}} other copolymers containing styrene, exhibit both normal and excimer fluorescence. We {{have shown that the}} ratio of the excimer to monomer fluorescence intensities in random <b>styrene-acrylonitrile</b> copolymers is linearly dependent upon the concentration of styrene-styrene bonds in the copolymer. This observation is consistent with a photophysical model which allows the energy absorbed by styrene units to migrate freely along the copolymer chain. Some of the energy is emitted in the form of normal fluorescence; some of the energy, trapped by neighbouring styrene-styrene pairs suitably oriented to allow excimer formation, is emitted as excimer fluorescence. The fluorescence characteristics of acrylonitrile-styrene copolymers are contrasted with those of methyl methacrylate-styrene copolymers, in which the methylmethacrylate sequences are believed to present partial barriers to energy migration along the copolymer chains...|$|E

A modified Kissinger procedure is proposed to estimate activation energies in polymer systems in which the relative crystallinity - measured at constant heating rates - can be correlated by the Ozawa model with a temperature-independent exponent.

It was observed that the initial notch severity determines {{the duration of the}} crack-initiation stage, while crack propagation does not depend on it. The crack velocity appears to be controlled by the maximum applied stress intensity factor, and the correlation does not depend on the rubber content.

Glass transition behavior depended upon the applied transformation path from the liquid-equilibrium state to the glassy state. From isobaric cooling ramps performed at constant rate and at several pressures, it was possible to determine the glass transition temperature and its dependence upon pressure; whereas from isothermal compressions at various temperatures, it was possible to determine a glass transition pressure and its temperature dependence. Both the dependences were linear, and a correlation was observed between the slopes of the fitting lines.
