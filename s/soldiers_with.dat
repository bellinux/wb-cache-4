5|$|According to Watson, {{the most}} {{dominant}} element in the Rommel myth is Rommel the Superior Soldier, the second being Rommel the Common Man, {{and the last one}} Rommel the Martyr. Rosie Goldschmidt Waldeck, writing in 1943, also takes note of the image of the general who fought with common <b>soldiers,</b> <b>with</b> an indelible youthfulness and apparent invulnerability.|$|E
5|$|French {{physician}} Jean-Baptiste Octave Landry {{first described}} the disorder in 1859. In 1916, Georges Guillain, Jean Alexandre Barré, and André Strohl diagnosed two <b>soldiers</b> <b>with</b> the illness {{and described the}} key diagnostic abnormality—albuminocytological dissociation—of increased spinal fluid protein concentration but a normal cell count.|$|E
5|$|On {{the north}} side of Zion Square stands the Jerusalem Hostel. This lodging opened as the Tel Aviv Hotel in 1926 and later became known as the Ron Hotel. Menachem Begin stood on one of the hotel's {{balconies}} on August 3, 1948, to announce the dissolution of the Irgun and the sign-up of his <b>soldiers</b> <b>with</b> the Israel Defense Forces.|$|E

5|$|Purchase the Namer APC – Seats 9 <b>soldiers</b> <b>with</b> combat {{survival}} rates expected {{slightly higher than}} the GCV, and costs $9 billion less. The Namer has less ability to destroy other enemy vehicles and is less mobile. Production would be conducted in part domestically, but fielding would require collaboration with foreign companies and governments.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{substantial}} hobby devoted to collecting old toy <b>soldiers,</b> <b>with</b> an abundance of small manufacturers, dealers, and toy soldier shows. There are published articles of these figures in some magazines, such as Plastic Warrior Magazine, {{and there are also}} published books totally or partially devoted to these figures.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 72 Virginia and Maryland National Guard <b>Soldiers</b> <b>with</b> the 29th ID {{deployed}} to Afghanistan from December 2010 to October 2011. As {{part of the}} 29th ID Security Partnering Team, the Soldiers were assigned to NATO's International Security Assistance Force Joint Command Security Partnering Team with the mission of assisting with the growth {{and development of the}} Afghan National Security Forces where they served as advisers and mentors to senior Afghan leaders. They were part of a NATO Coalition of 49 troop-contributing nations that Security Partnering personnel interacted with daily across Afghanistan.|$|E

5|$|As {{the weather}} turned colder and rations grew smaller, groups of Texians began to leave, most without permission. Morale was boosted on November 18, {{when the first}} group of volunteers from the United States, the New Orleans Greys, joined the Texian army. Unlike the {{majority}} of the Texian volunteers, the Greys looked like <b>soldiers,</b> <b>with</b> uniforms, well-maintained rifles, adequate ammunition, and some semblance of discipline.|$|E
5|$|Bewick {{was also}} noted {{as having a}} strong moral sense and was an early campaigner for fair {{treatment}} of animals. He objected to the docking of horses' tails, the mistreatment of performing animals such as bears, and cruelty to dogs. Above all, he thought war utterly pointless. All these themes recur in his engravings, which echo Hogarth's attention to moral themes. For example, he shows wounded <b>soldiers</b> <b>with</b> wooden legs, back from the wars, and animals with a gallows in the background.|$|E
5|$|Count Zrinski {{found himself}} besieged by a hostile army {{of at least}} 150,000 <b>soldiers</b> <b>with</b> {{powerful}} artillery. Zrinski had assembled a force of around 2,300 Croatian and Hungarian soldiers prior to the siege. These consisted of his personal forces and those {{of his friends and}} allies. The majority of the defenders were Croatian, with a significant Hungarian contingent represented in both the men-at-arms and the leadership.|$|E

5|$|From the well-fortified {{position}} in the Klis Fortress, the Turks were a constant threat to the Venetians and to the local Croatian population in the surrounding area. In 1647, after the Turkish success at Novigrad, the Turks {{were said to have}} 30,000 troops ready to attack Split. The Signoria send off two thousand <b>soldiers</b> <b>with</b> munitions and provisions to the threatened area. Although Split and Zadar were strong fortresses, they were clearly in danger.|$|E
5|$|In September 1645 a Parliamentary army {{under the}} command of Lord Fairfax and Oliver Cromwell {{advanced}} into Somerset, taking Sherborne, Cary and Shepton Mallet before turning to Nunney. Two regiments of <b>soldiers</b> <b>with</b> cannons surrounded the castle on 18 September; when Richard Prater refused to surrender, the cannons opened fire {{on the north side of}} the castle, breaching the castle wall. Richard continued to resist, hoisting a flag with a Catholic crucifix on it above the castle to taunt the besiegers, but two days later the garrison surrendered.|$|E
5|$|Indianapolis {{residents}} {{continued to}} assist those in need. Veterans programs were initiated to help wounded <b>soldiers</b> <b>with</b> housing, food, and other basic necessities. New orphanages and asylums joined the Indianapolis Orphans' Home, chartered in 1850, to aid women and children. The German Protestant Orphans' Association was organized in 1867. The Indianapolis Asylum for Friendless Colored Children, the state's only orphanage for African American children, {{was established in}} 1870. Other major charitable groups included the Indianapolis Benevolent Society and the Indianapolis Flower Mission, both organized in 1876.|$|E

5|$|Later in 2007, Obama {{sponsored}} {{an amendment}} to the Defense Authorization Act to add safeguards for personality-disorder military discharges. This amendment passed the full Senate in the spring of 2008. He sponsored the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act supporting divestment of state pension funds from Iran's oil and gas industry, which has not passed committee; and co-sponsored legislation to reduce risks of nuclear terrorism. Obama also sponsored a Senate amendment to the State Children's Health Insurance Program, providing one year of job protection for family members caring for <b>soldiers</b> <b>with</b> combat-related injuries.|$|E
5|$|Levels {{consist of}} several missions, {{which are based}} around the {{destruction}} of enemy weapons and installations, as well as rescuing hostages or prisoners of war, or capturing enemy personnel. The Apache is armed with a machine gun, more powerful Hydra rockets and yet more deadly Hellfire missiles. The more powerful the weapon, the fewer can be carried: the player must choose an appropriate weapon for each situation. Enemy weapons range from <b>soldiers</b> <b>with</b> small arms, to anti-aircraft missiles to tanks and armoured cars.|$|E
5|$|McCullen is {{revealed}} to be using the same nanotechnology to build an army of <b>soldiers</b> <b>with</b> {{the aid of the}} Doctor (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), planning on using the warheads to cause worldwide panic and bring about a new world order. Using a tracking device, McCullen locates the G.I. Joe base and sends Storm Shadow (Byung-Hun Lee) and the Baroness to retrieve the warheads, with assistance from Zartan (Arnold Vosloo).|$|E

5|$|More {{than half}} of the state's households, based on an average family size of four persons, contributed a family member to fight in the war, making the effects of the {{conflict}} widely felt throughout the state. More Hoosiers died in the Civil War than in any other conflict. Although twice as many Hoosiers served in World War II, almost twice as many died in the Civil War. After the war, veterans programs were initiated to help wounded <b>soldiers</b> <b>with</b> housing, food, and other basic needs. In addition, orphanages and asylums were established to assist women and children.|$|E
5|$|Now {{with the}} city under Gorgopas' command the {{defenders}} became reinvigorated. The siege was proving more difficult until Flamininus arrived with 4,000 Roman <b>soldiers.</b> <b>With</b> {{the arrival of the}} new soldiers, the allied soldiers were encouraged and began bombarding the city again with their siege engines while the Rhodian and Pergamese fleet continued to put pressure on the Spartans from the sea. The Spartans knew {{that they did not have}} much of a chance of withstanding the renewed allied assault and Gorgopas decided to surrender the city to the Romans under the condition that the garrison was allowed to leave the city unharmed.|$|E
5|$|Opposing the US 24th Infantry at Battle Mountain was the NK 6th Division, {{which had}} been {{engaging}} Task Force Kean since August 5. The division, which had originally numbered 10,000, had suffered 4,000 casualties thus far fighting at the Pusan Perimeter. However it brought in 3,100 South Koreans forcibly conscripted from neighboring towns to replenish its ranks. The South Koreans fought as ordered, though the North Koreans dispatched rearguard <b>soldiers</b> <b>with</b> them to shoot any who attempted to desert, defect, or surrender.|$|E
