5|$|Having {{been elected}} twice to the presidency, Reagan {{reshaped}} the Republican party, led the modern conservative movement, and altered the political {{dynamic of the}} United States. His 1980 presidential campaign stressed some of his fundamental principles: lower taxes to <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy,</b> less government interference in people's lives, states' rights, and a strong national defense.|$|E
5|$|The 1980 presidential {{election}} featured Reagan against incumbent President Jimmy Carter and was conducted amid {{a multitude of}} domestic concerns {{as well as the}} ongoing Iran hostage crisis. Reagan's campaign stressed some of his fundamental principles: lower taxes to <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy,</b> less government interference in people's lives, states' rights, and a strong national defense.|$|E
5|$|The Bush {{campaign}} advertised {{across the}} U.S. against Democratic candidates, including Bush's emerging opponent, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry. Kerry and other Democrats attacked Bush on the Iraq War, and {{accused him of}} failing to <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> and job growth. The Bush campaign portrayed Kerry as a staunch liberal who would raise taxes and {{increase the size of}} government. The Bush campaign continuously criticized Kerry's seemingly contradictory statements on the war in Iraq, and argued that Kerry lacked the decisiveness and vision necessary for success in the War on Terror.|$|E

5|$|The Great Depression, {{although}} negative to {{the local}} economy, also benefited the San Diego State Teachers College, {{as the federal government}} made money available for construction projects in an attempt to <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy.</b> For the campus, some of these construction projects included new buildings (such as a $500,000 stadium completed in 1936 and a $200,000 open air theater completed in 1941), facilities, and art works. Several federal programs were also created to give jobs to students and to increase financial aid.|$|E
5|$|There were fears {{among some}} traders in India that Indian goods {{would find a}} limited outlet in Tibet, while China would {{have access to a}} ready market in Sikkim and West Bengal. The reopening of the pass was {{expected}} to <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> of the region and bolster Indo-Chinese trade, but this has not happened. Figures released by the Tibet Autonomous Regional Bureau of Commerce show that in the 51 days of trading in 2006, only US$186,250 worth of trade passed through Nathu La.|$|E
5|$|Robert E. Hall applied {{rational}} expectations to Friedman's permanent income hypothesis that people base {{the level of}} their current spending on their wealth and lifetime income rather than current income. Hall found that people will smooth their consumption over time and only alter their consumption patterns when their expectations about future income change. Both Hall's and Friedman's versions of the permanent income hypothesis challenged the Keynesian view that short-term stabilization policies like tax cuts can <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy.</b> The permanent income view suggests that consumers base their spending on wealth, so a temporary boost in income would only produce a moderate increase in consumption. Empirical tests of Hall's hypothesis suggest it may understate boosts in consumption due to income increases; however, Hall's work helped to popularize Euler equation models of consumption.|$|E

5|$|The {{arrival in}} New Orleans of Jean-Jacques Blaise d'Abbadie {{as the new}} {{governor}} of Louisiana in June 1763 led to changes in colonial policies. D'Abbadie quickly moved to grant trade monopolies in the middle Mississippi Valley to <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy.</b> Among the new monopolists was Pierre Laclede, who along with his stepson Auguste Chouteau set out in August 1763 to build a fur trading post near {{the confluence of the}} Missouri and Mississippi rivers. The settlement of St. Louis was established at a site south of the confluence on {{the west bank of the}} Mississippi on February 15, 1764, by Chouteau and a group of about 30 men. Laclede arrived at the site by mid-1764 and provided detailed plans for the village, including a street grid and market area.|$|E
5|$|With Brownlee as premier and Reid as Provincial Treasurer, {{government}} deficits ceased: {{the budget}} showed a surplus in {{every year from}} 1925 until 1930, except for 1927. In 1929, Reid predicted that Alberta was {{on the cusp of}} a period of economic expansion; instead, he was soon confronted with the Great Depression. He drastically cut provincial spending and raised taxes, in part by creating a new income tax. He reluctantly accepted that these measures could not prevent a return to deficit spending. His willingness to outspend revenues was due less to any Keynesian desire to <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> than to a belief that there was no further spending to be cut or further taxes that could reasonably be raised. Conversely, he rejected calls from the opposition Liberals to cut taxes as a stimulus measure.|$|E

40|$|On February 17, 2009, {{less than}} thirty {{days after his}} inauguration, President Obama signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). This new law {{was one of many}} {{measures}} from the new administration designed to quickly <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> ailing American <b>economy.</b> <b>The</b> $ 789 billion package was divided between direct government spending, tax reductions and financial relief to states and individuals. The bill contains $ 285. 6 billion in tax reductions, which is about 36. 3 % of the legislation. In this article, I will analyze some of the tax provisions that were written into ARRA, and attempt to assess their effectiveness in <b>stimulating</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy.</b> Will these tax provisions aid in <b>stimulating</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> or will another stimulus package have to be passed next year? The size, scope and timing of the tax provisions of ARRA may actually limit their potential value to an economic recovery...|$|R

50|$|Reflation is <b>the</b> act of <b>stimulating</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> by {{increasing}} <b>the</b> money supply or by reducing taxes, seeking to bring <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> (specifically price level) {{back up to}} the long-term trend, following a dip in the business cycle.
