50|$|In 1901 {{there was}} a fire at Kingston Mill. As a result, {{there was a}} {{universal}} adoption of sprinkler systems. These were fed by water from the water tower, and a <b>supplementary</b> <b>tank</b> on the roof.|$|E
50|$|In a {{press conference}} in Farmingdale, Long Island, he first asked the reporters to check that there was no <b>supplementary</b> <b>tank</b> in the car he had brought. Then he asked one of the reporters to fetch him a bucket of water. He poured greenish liquid into water and filled a gas tank of the car with it. When the car started, it also emitted a strong smell of almonds. Enricht invited the {{witnesses}} to use it in their own vehicles.|$|E
5000|$|Test and {{evaluation}} aircraft, fitted with an auxiliary rocket motor and <b>supplementary</b> fuel <b>tank.</b> Two conversions from FJ-4.|$|R
50|$|Improvements {{including}} a variable-pitch propeller and <b>supplementary</b> fuel <b>tanks</b> were started but in 1943 an Allied air {{raid on the}} Juvisy railway yard also struck the factory, destroying the PA 22.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Potez 28 {{was flat}} sided, with rounded decking and two open cockpits placed well behind the upper wing. There was a cut-out in the trailing {{edge of the}} upper wing to improve the pilot's field of view. Large external <b>supplementary</b> fuel <b>tanks</b> could be carried below the fuselage to extend the range. The sesquiplane was powered by a [...] Renault 12Kg engine, driving a two blade propeller. At the rear the fin was small and roughly quadrantal, topped by the horn of the balanced rudder. It had a fixed tail wheel undercarriage with single main wheels mounted on vertical, streamlined, shock absorbing legs attached to the lower fuselage. These were hinged on trailing struts to the outer lower fuselage and on inner struts to its central lower underside.|$|R
5000|$|The Italian Command {{intended}} {{to employ the}} special SM82s to bomb the English oil plants of Manama, in the Persian Gulf, {{in order to show}} the potential ability of the Italian air force. It was a long and difficult mission involving a 4,000 kilometre flight. Ettore Muti and his comrades spent four days working on a complete revision of the plans and established a complex flight plan....On December 18, at 5.10 pm, after filling both the normal and the <b>supplementary</b> <b>tanks,</b> they loaded three out of four SM82s with 1.5 tons of incendiary and explosive bombs weighing 15, 20 or 50 kilograms. Then the four three-engine bombers took off.In command of the first aircraft, which gained height with difficulty from the Rhodes- Gadurr√† runway because it was overloaded with 19,500 kilograms, was Lieutenant Colonel Muti. He was assisted by Major Giovanni Raina and by Captain Paolo Moci, who had previous experience in flying planes overloaded up to 21 tons.....The SM82s, after gaining height (a manoeuvre which took remarkable efforts because of the enormous weight of the aircraft) headed east, flying over Cyprus, Lebanon and Syria, bending to the southeast as they went past Jordan and Iraq until they reached the Persian Gulf. During the very long outward flight, the role of Muti's SM82 pathfinder proved its essential function in leading the squadron..... At 2.20 am, just before reaching the Bahrain Islands, Lieutenant Colonel Federici's aircraft suddenly lost sight contact with Muti's SM82 and had to drop its bombs on different targets in the vicinity of Manama, while the other planes hit the fixed target. As bombardier Raina later told [...] "the operation of spotting the target was easy thanks to the total illumination of the extractive and refinery plants" [...] which were partially damaged by the bombs (half a dozen wells and some oil deposits were set on fire). As soon as they perceived the glares of the first explosions, the Italian planes made off along the escape route landing to the Zula runway (Eritrea) at 8 8:40.The whole Italian formation had flown 2,400 kilometres in 15.30 hours. At the Eritrean airport, along with a small crowd of Italian aviators, the brave pilots found the fourth SM82 squadron which, in the meantime, had come from Rhodes as a support plane on the way back, should one of the crafts make an emergency landing in the desert.

40|$|Continued {{progress}} in water resources {{development in the}} future will depend upon the utilization of the existing irrigation potential. An irrigation tank is a small reservoir to catch and store water during rainy season and use it for irrigation during dry season. They recharge groundwater, which is not only a major source of drinking water for numerous rural and urban communities, but also serve as a <b>supplementary</b> source for <b>tank</b> water. Due to the loss in tank storage capacities, wells have become an important source of supplementary water. Since farmers initially use tank water for cultivation, the risk associated with getting adequate water, especially late in the season, has encouraged farmers to use wells for supplemental irrigation particularly later in the crop season. Since only a few farmers in the tank command area own wells, and there is a growing demand for well water, the well owners in most cases act like local monopolists. The study was undertaken with the objective to study the water market in the two districts of Tamil Nadu viz., Sivagangai and Coimbatore. Inverse demand function, Output function and Cost function were used to study the monopolistic behavior of water market. The profit maximizing levels of well yield, price of water and hours of pumping are 4. 6 meters, Rs 10 and 8. 6 hours, respectively. Well owners maximize profits from water sales when the water level in the well is at about five meters and the price of pumping hour is Rs. 10 and this correspond to about nine hours of pumping per day from the well. Currently they pump only four hours per day and the water level in the well is about eight meter. Under these conditions, well water output can best be increased by having farmers install more wells and increased competition. With more wells, the demand for water from each individual well will fall, resulting in a lower well water price. Therefore {{there is a need to}} increase the number of wells in the tank command area in the study area up to threshold level...|$|R
