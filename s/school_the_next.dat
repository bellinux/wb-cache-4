500|$|The reforms {{enacted by}} Thomas Arnold, famed headmaster, made Rugby the {{crucible}} of muscular Christianity, a [...] "cult of athleticism" [...] into which Wills was inculcated. Wills took up cricket {{within a week}} of entering Evans House. At first he bowled underhand, but it was considered outdated, so he tried roundarm bowling. He clean bowled a batsman with his first ball using this style and declared: [...] "I felt I was a bowler." [...] Wills soon topped all of his house's cricket statistics. At bat he was a [...] "punisher" [...] with a sound defence; however, in an era when stylish stroke-play was expected of a gentleman cricketer, he was said to have no style at all. In April 1852, aged sixteen, Wills joined the Rugby School XI, and on his debut at Lord's a few months later, against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), he took a match-high 12 wickets. That year his bowling was vital in establishing Rugby as the greatest public school in English cricket. In a prelude to his colonial career, critics stated that Wills ought to be no-balled for throwing—an illegal bowling action. Rugby coach John Lillywhite, the umpire who famously no-balled professional Edgar Willsher, defended his protégé. Wills survived the scandal. He played with, and attracted praise from the leading cricketers of the age, including Alfred Mynn. William Clarke, his hero, invited him to join the All-England Eleven in 1854, but he remained at <b>school.</b> <b>The</b> <b>next</b> year, he became Rugby XI captain.|$|E
