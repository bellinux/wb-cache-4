40|$|The Fertiliser Act {{regulates the}} trade in and use of {{fertilisers}} in the Netherlands. Only designated fertiliserscan be traded freely. In general, the Act prohibits the use of wastes and by-products as fertilisers, assecondary raw materials <b>for</b> <b>fertiliser</b> production or <b>for</b> the production, via co-digestion in a biogas productionplant, of digestate destined <b>for</b> use as <b>fertiliser.</b> However, a statutory provision has been adopted thatpermits the use of approved and designated wastes and by-products as fertilisers or as secondary rawmaterials <b>for</b> <b>fertiliser</b> or digestate production. Before wastes and by-products may be designated, they arereviewed to assess their fertilisation value and any environmental risks associated with these uses.

25|$|In the 1840s, world {{phosphate}} production {{turned to}} the mining of tropical island deposits formed from bird and bat guano (see also Guano Islands Act). These became {{an important source of}} phosphates <b>for</b> <b>fertiliser</b> {{in the latter half of}} the 19th century.|$|R
50|$|The {{first was}} for draught - the cow being {{the mother of}} {{bullocks}} that ploughed the farmer’s fields and pulled his cart. The second was for dung used both as manure <b>for</b> <b>fertiliser</b> application and as fuel. The third was for milk.|$|R

50|$|During the 17th {{century the}} wool and {{knitting}} industry dominated the rural economy.

5000|$|Managing crop {{residues}} {{is important in}} most systems. Some of the nutrients contained in these dead tissues are made available to crops during decomposition, reducing the need <b>for</b> <b>fertiliser</b> inputs.

50|$|For {{the past}} few decades, {{there has also been}} {{increasing}} interest in perennial grain plants. This interest developed due to advantages in erosion control, reduced need <b>for</b> <b>fertiliser,</b> and potential lowered costs to the farmer. Though research is still in early stages, The Land Institute in Salina, Kansas has been able to create a few cultivars that produce a fairly good crop yield.|$|R
50|$|As {{early as}} 1755, Sarehole Mill was leased by Matthew Boulton, {{one of the}} pioneers of the Industrial Revolution and leading figure of the Lunar Society, for {{scientific}} experimentation.

50|$|A Scoubidou is a corkscrew-like {{tool that}} {{is used for the}} {{commercial}} harvesting of seaweed, whose invention is credited to Yves Colin in 1961.

50|$|During {{the early}} 19th century, sealing took place with sealing gangs {{living on the}} island often {{for months at a}} time. There are two graves on the island - one of a sealer buried in 1822, and one of a man named Hardman buried in 1828 by Captain Wishart of the Fairy. Guano was mined on the island until 1861 <b>for</b> <b>fertiliser,</b> being transported to Port Fairy in barges.|$|R
50|$|Horn's Mill was at {{the foot}} of Bullock's Lane.

50|$|Rice {{production}} in Indonesian history {{is linked to}} the development of iron tools and the domestication of Wild Asian Water Buffalo as water buffalo for cultivation of fields and manure <b>for</b> <b>fertiliser.</b> Rice production requires exposure to the sun.

25|$|The {{underlying}} geology of Cambridge {{consists of}} gault clay and Chalk Marl, {{known locally as}} Cambridge Greensand, partly overlaid by terrace gravel. A layer of phosphatic nodules (coprolites) under the marl were mined in the 19th century <b>for</b> <b>fertiliser.</b> It became a major industry in the county, and its profits yielded buildings such as the Corn Exchange, Fulbourn Hospital and St. John's Chapel until the Quarries Act 1894 and competition from America ended production.|$|R
