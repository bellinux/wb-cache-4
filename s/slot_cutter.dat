25|$|To {{create the}} mortise for the biscuit, a biscuit joiner is usually required. There are other methods of cutting the slot, {{such as a}} <b>slot</b> <b>cutter</b> bit in a router, but the biscuit joiner is the most common. Accuracy is not as {{important}} {{in the creation of}} these mortises as the biscuit joint is designed to allow a bit of flexibility during glue up. The mortise must be located at the correct distance {{from the face of the}} joint in both members but the width of the mortise is not as critical.|$|E
50|$|The side-and-face cutter is {{designed}} with cutting teeth {{on its side}} {{as well as its}} circumference. They are made in varying diameters and widths depending on the application. The teeth on the side allow the cutter to make unbalanced cuts (cutting on one side only) without deflecting the cutter as would happen with a slitting saw or <b>slot</b> <b>cutter</b> (no side teeth).|$|E

40|$|Key words: bipolar plate; wave-like flow channel; milling; <b>slotting</b> <b>cutters</b> Abstract. Metallic bipolar {{plates with}} unique wave-like {{microstructure}} {{on the bottom}} of microflow channel have shown promising prospects for the application in proton exchange membrane microfuel cell. A novel method—milling with special thin <b>slotting</b> <b>cutters</b> is developed for fabrication of wave-like microstructure {{on the bottom of}} microflow channels. The special thin <b>slotting</b> <b>cutter</b> is manufactured by removing one or several teeth every one tooth of the traditional <b>slotting</b> <b>cutter</b> regularly. Forming mechanism of wave-like microstructure is presented and experimental tests have been conducted for validation of the feasibility of the novel method. Results show that the wave-like microstructure can be successfully fabricated on the bottom of microflow channel. The bottom of bipolar plates with wave-like microstructure is not a flat plane, but a wavy groove. The wavelength and amplitude of wave-like microstructure increase with the increase of feed speed and the number of removed teeth...|$|R

A new way for the tooth profile modification technology was provided in the paper. The slotting profile modification process was proposed, the formulating methods of the tooth profile modification K diagram was introduced, modification curve fit as the sections of involutes, the modification profile angles of <b>slotting</b> <b>cutter</b> corresponding sections of involutes was deduced using the profile angle error analysis theory and the tooth profile of modification <b>slotting</b> <b>cutter</b> precision was designed. The feasibility and advantages of modification <b>slotting</b> <b>cutter</b> were validated by examples, which indicates the widely use of this technology in high-speed locomotive traction gear...|$|R

40|$|A {{slotting}} {{method for}} cosine gears was proposed {{by using the}} involute cutter based on the conjugate theories of digital surface and gear meshing. The slotting model between the cosine tooth surface represented by discrete points and the cutter figuration determined by analytic function was built for their geometrical relationship and conjugate motion during the machining process. Conjugate points in the cutter section corresponding to the discrete points on the cosine gear tooth surface and the conjugate movements were solved. By using the flexible control of the CNC procedure, the active control of the cutting trace of the <b>slotting</b> <b>cutter</b> was accomplished and the envelop forming of the cosine gear was obtained. Based on the software C++ and Matlab, the computer aided manufacturing (CAM) system of the cosine gear was developed, and the simulation of the slotting process was accomplished. Several examples were provided to illustrate the approach. The result of the simulation demonstrates that the proposed slotting method is feasible. ? 2014 Central South University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} grooves, slots, and pockets in the {{work-piece}} may be produced {{from a variety}} of tool bits. Common tool bit types are: square end cutters, ball end cutters, t-slot cutters, and shell mills. Square end cutters can mill square slots, pockets, and edges. Ball end <b>cutters</b> mill radiused <b>slots</b> or fillets. T-slot cutters mill exactly that: T-shaped <b>slots.</b> Shell end <b>cutters</b> are used for large flat surfaces and for angle cuts. There are variations of these tool types as well.|$|R
40|$|A metal {{shearing}} energy absorber is described. The absorber {{is composed of}} a flat thin strip of metal which is pulled through a <b>slot</b> in a <b>cutter</b> member of a metal, harder than the metal of the strip. The slot's length, in the direction perpendicular to the pull direction, {{is less than the}} strip's width so that as the strip is pulled through the slot, its edges are sheared off, thereby absorbing some of the pulling energy. In one embodiment the cutter member is a flat plate of steel, while in another embodiment the cutter member is U-shaped with the slot at its base...|$|R
