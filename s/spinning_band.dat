40|$|By {{applying}} {{a magnetic field}} whose Zeeman energy exceeds the Kondo energy by {{an order of magnitude}} the ground state of the Friedel-Anderson impurity is a magnetic state. In recent years the author introduced the Friedel Artificially Inserted Resonance (FAIR) method to investigate impurity properties. Within this FAIR approach the magnetic ground state is derived. Its full excitation spectrum and the composition of the excitations is calculated and numerically evaluated. From the excitation spectrum the electron density of states is calculated. Majority and minority d-resonances are obtained. The width of the resonances is about twice as wide as the mean field theory predicts. This broadening {{is due to the fact}} that any change of the occupation of the d-state in one <b>spin</b> <b>band</b> changes the eigenstates in the opposite <b>spin</b> <b>band</b> and causes transitions in both <b>spin</b> <b>bands.</b> This broadening reduces the height of the resonance curve and therefore the density of states by a factor of two.

We find that the ground state of SrNiO 3 always keeps a stable ferromagnetic state (FM), and presents half-metallic property when U is larger than 3. 0 eV. The majority <b>spin</b> <b>band</b> cross the Fermi level, showing a metallic property, while a robust band gap appears around the Fermi level in the minority <b>spin</b> <b>band,</b> showing a insulating behavior.

The idea's genesis came from Niven's attempts to imagine a more efficient version of a Dyson sphere, which could produce the effect of surface gravity through rotation.

After publication of Ringworld, Dan Alderson and Ctien, two fannish friends of Niven, analyzed the structure and told Niven that the Ringworld was dynamically unstable such that if the center of rotation drifts away from the central sun, gravitational forces will not 're-center' it, thus allowing the ring to eventually contact the sun and be destroyed. Niven used this as a core plot element in the sequel novel, The Ringworld Engineers.|$|E

Several examples of systems that meet these criteria to {{a high degree of}} precision are identified.
