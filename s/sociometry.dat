The first textbook in {{social psychology}} by a sociologist appeared in 1908—Social Psychology by Edward Alsworth Ross. The area's main journal was founded as <b>Sociometry</b> by Jacob L. Moreno in 1937. The journal's name changed to Social Psychology in 1978, and to Social Psychology Quarterly in 1979.|$|E

[...] By definition, <b>sociometry</b> {{is the study of}} social relations between individuals—interpersonal relationships. It is, more broadly, a set of ideas and practices that are focused on promoting spontaneity in human relations. Classically, <b>sociometry</b> involves techniques for identifying, organizing, and giving feedback on specific interpersonal preferences an individual has. For example, in a psychodrama session, allowing the group to decide whom the protagonist shall be employs <b>sociometry.</b>|$|E

This study explores the use of spatially meaningful neighbours for PSO. An approach is designed which uses heuristics to leverage the natural neighbours computed with Delaunay triangulation. The approach is compared to standard PSO <b>sociometries</b> and 01 tness distance ratio approaches. Although intrinsic properties of Delaunay triangulation limit the practical application of this approach to low dimensions results show that it is a successful particle swarm optimizer...|$|R

[...] Around 1910, he developed the Theater of Spontaneity, which is based on the acting out of improvisational impulses. The focus of this exercise was not originally on the therapeutic effects of psychodrama; these were seen by Moreno to simply be positive side-effects.|$|E

People go to PageRank for information and are flooded with citations of other authors who also have an opinion on the topic. This creates a social aspect where everything can be discussed and collected to provoke thinking. There is a social relationship that exists between PageRank {{and the people who}} use it as it is constantly adapting and changing to the shifts in modern society. Viewing the relationship between PageRank and the individual through <b>sociometry</b> allows for an in-depth look at the connection that results.|$|E

50|$|Within sociology, <b>sociometry</b> has {{two main}} branches: {{research}} <b>sociometry,</b> and applied <b>sociometry.</b> Research <b>sociometry</b> is action research with groups exploring the socio-emotional networks of relationships using specified criteria e.g. Who {{in this group}} {{do you want to}} sit beside you at work? Who in the group do you go to for advice on a work problem? Who in the group do you see providing satisfying leadership in the pending project? Sometimes called network explorations, research <b>sociometry</b> is concerned with relational patterns in small (individual and small group) and larger populations, such as organizations and neighborhoods. Applied sociometrists utilize a range of methods to assist people and groups review, expand and develop their existing psycho-social networks of relationships. Both fields of <b>sociometry</b> exist to produce through their application, greater spontaneity and creativity of both individuals and groups.|$|E
5000|$|He {{developed}} <b>sociometry</b> {{within the}} new sciences, although its ultimate purpose is transcendence and not science. 'By making choices based on criteria, overt and energetic, Moreno hoped that individuals {{would be more}} spontaneous, and organisations and groups structures would become fresh, clear and lively.' [...] One of Moreno's innovations in <b>sociometry</b> was {{the development of the}} sociogram, a systematic method for graphically representing individuals as points/nodes and the relationships between them as lines/arcs. Moreno, who wrote extensively of his thinking, applications and findings, also founded a journal entitled <b>Sociometry.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The term <b>sociometry</b> {{relates to}} its Latin etymology, socius meaning companion, and metrum meaning measure. Jacob Moreno defined <b>sociometry</b> as [...] "the {{inquiry into the}} {{evolution}} and organization of groups and the position of individuals within them." [...] He goes on to write [...] "As the ...science of group organization, it attacks the problem not from the outer structure of the group, the group surface, but from the inner structure. [...] "Sociometric explorations reveal the hidden structures that give a group its form: the alliances, the subgroups, the hidden beliefs, the forbidden agendas, the ideological agreements, the ‘stars’ of the show." ...|$|E

5000|$|There is {{evidence}} that the methods of J. L. Moreno have held up respectably over time. Subsequent research from the University of Vienna shows the enormous influence that Moreno's theory of the Encounter (Invitations to an Encounter, 1914) had on the development of Martin Buber's I-Thou philosophy, and Buber's influence on philosophy, theology, and psychology. His wife, Zerka Moreno, wrote: [...] "While it is true that Buber broadened the idea of the Encounter, he did not create the instruments for it to occur." [...] Moreno [...] "produced the various instruments we now use for facilitating the human encounter, <b>sociometry,</b> group psychotherapy, psychodrama, and sociodrama". [...] Zerka was herself an expert in psychodrama and <b>sociometry,</b> and continued her late husband's work.|$|E
5000|$|Psychodrama/Sociometry: The {{psychological}} {{approach to}} counseling and exploring issues, {{both personal and}} in a wider social context, was founded by J.L. Moreno in the 1920s. His unique approach to therapy and social change at that time involved using theater and roleplay to assist individuals and groups to change/ improve their life circumstances, and a somewhat lesser known approach, called <b>Sociometry,</b> to measuring social dynamics in groups, and effect change in groups and society. <b>Sociometry</b> measures the connections between individuals in any group, from small groups to world issues. Measuring connections and feelings within a group assists individuals within the group to make desired/ needed changes, and also provides {{a wealth of information}} about the dynamics in any particular group or situation. The Diamond of Opposites is one type of sociometric assessment.|$|E
50|$|Early {{social network}} studies {{can be traced}} back to the end of the nineteenth century. However {{well-documented}} studies and foundation of this field are usually attributed to a psychiatrist named Jacob Moreno.

50|$|This foundation, now in {{the first}} phase of its development, is {{dedicated}} to the teachings of Zerka T. Moreno, co-founder of psychodrama, <b>sociometry</b> and group psychotherapy.
