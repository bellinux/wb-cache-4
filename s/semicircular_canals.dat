5|$|The <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals</b> are contracted, {{and they}} are highly curved. The semicircular system of MCCM-HUE-8741 shows also a basal morphology, because the <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals</b> do not attach to each other.|$|E
5|$|The {{inner ear}} sits within the {{temporal}} bone in a complex cavity called the bony labyrinth. A central area known as the vestibule contains two small fluid-filled recesses, the utricle and saccule. These connect to the <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals</b> and the cochlea. There are three <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals</b> angled {{at right angles to}} each other which are responsible for dynamic balance. The cochlea is a spiral shell-shaped organ responsible for the sense of hearing. These structures together create the membranous labyrinth.|$|E
5|$|Parts of the {{otic vesicle}} in turn form the vestibulocochlear nerve. These form bipolar neurons which supply {{sensation}} {{to parts of}} the inner ear (namely the sensory parts of the <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals,</b> macular of the utricle and saccule, and organ of Corti). The nerve begins to form around the 28th day.|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study is to define the {{diagnostic}} criteria for anterior <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) based on clinical data and the available anatomical and pathophysiological data. Material and methodBetween July 2006 and June 2007, 4320  patients consulting for otoneurological disease were investigated by otological examination, videonystagmography and neurological examination. ResultsBPPV was diagnosed in 1430  patients, involving the posterior <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> in 1325 patients, the horizontal <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> in 85  patients, the posterior <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> and ipsilateral anterior (superior) <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> in 19  patients and the anterior <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> only in one patient. In the 20  patients with anterior <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> BPPV, the Dix-Hallpike (DH) test induced ageotropic horizontal torsional nystagmus beating towards the uppermost ear in the lateral supine position with reversal on standing. The modified Epley manoeuvre was effective in 94. 1 % of cases on the 8 th day and in 97. 5 % of cases at 1 month. Discussion/ConclusionNystagmus beating towards the uppermost ear on the DH test is consistent with BPPV involving the anterior <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> of the uppermost ear. The torsional component of nystagmus and not just the vertical component must be taken into account to facilitate the diagnosis with videonystagmoscopy glasses and identify the affected side. The anterior <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> is rarely affected due to its anatomical position. Settling of otoconia in this canal requires hyperextension of the head. Treatment is simple, consisting of the modified Epley particle repositioning manoeuvre...|$|R
40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONThe {{condition}} superior semi-circular canal dehiscence {{was first}} described by Minor et al. in 1998. PRESENTATION Of CaseWe describe a novel surgical {{approach to the}} management of superior <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> dehiscence. Our surgical technique involves a transmastoid rather than middle cranial fossa approach to the superior <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal.</b> CONCLUSIONWe conclude that the transmastoid approach, if anatomically feasible, carries significant advantages compared to middle cranial fossa craniotomy approach {{for the management of}} superior <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> dehiscence...|$|R
40|$|Multiple <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> dehiscences are {{clinical}} entities characterised by vestibular and cochlear symptoms {{induced by}} enhanced sensitivity of labyrinthine receptors {{due to a}} multiple bone defect of the otic capsule. The case is presented of a 38 -year-old male with bilateral posterior <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> dehiscence associated with unilateral (right) superior <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> dehiscence. The man suffered from vestibular (recurrent Tullio Phenomenon or sound-induced vertigo) and cochlear symptoms (persistent aural fullness associated with mixed hearing loss and disabling tinnitus) ...|$|R
5|$|Around the 33rd day of development, the vesicles {{begin to}} {{differentiate}}. Closer {{to the back}} of the embryo, they form what will become the utricle and <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals.</b> Closer to the front of the embryo, the vesicles differentiate into a rudimentary saccule, which will eventually become the saccule and cochlea. Part of the saccule will eventually give rise and connect to the cochlear duct. This duct appears approximately during the sixth week and connects to the saccule through the ductus reuniens.|$|E
5|$|The human ear {{consists}} of three parts—the outer ear, middle ear and inner ear. The ear canal of the outer ear is separated from the air-filled tympanic cavity {{of the middle ear}} by the eardrum. The middle ear contains the three small bones—the ossicles—involved in the transmission of sound, and is connected to the throat at the nasopharynx, via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube. The inner ear contains the otolith organs—the utricle and saccule—and the <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals</b> belonging to the vestibular system, as well as the cochlea of the auditory system.|$|E
5|$|Inferences about {{behavior}} {{can also be}} drawn from examination of the inner ear. The <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals</b> within the inner ear aid in balance, and the lateral semicircular canal is usually {{parallel to the ground}} when the animal holds its head in an alert posture. When the skull of Majungasaurus is rotated so that its lateral canal is parallel to the ground, the entire skull is nearly horizontal. This contrasts with many other theropods, where the head was more strongly downturned when in the alert position. The lateral canal is also significantly longer in Majungasaurus than in its more basal relative Ceratosaurus, indicating a greater sensitivity to side-to-side motions of the head.|$|E
40|$|Tullio {{phenomenon}} in superior <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> dehiscence syndrome Tullio phenomenon refers to eye movements induced by sound. 1 This unusual examination finding {{may be seen}} in superior <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> dehiscence (SSCD) syndrome. 2 This disorder is due to absent bone over the superior <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> (figure). Patients complain of dizziness triggered by loud sound, aural fullness, autophony, and pulsatile tinnitus. When Tullio phenomenon exists in SSCD syndrome, the patient develops a mixed vertical-torsional nystagmus in which the slow phase rotates up and away from the affected ear (video on the Neurology ® Web site at Neurology. org). This pattern of nystagmus aligns in the plane of the dehiscent <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> and is due to excitation of its afferent nerves...|$|R
40|$|Canal switch is a {{complication}} following canalith repositioning procedure (CRP) for posterior canal benign paroxysmal {{positional vertigo}} (BPPV). Instead of being {{returned to the}} utricle, the loose otoconia migrate into the superior or horizontal <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal.</b> Patients remain symptomatic, and treatment can be ineffective unless the switch is recognized and additional repositioning maneuvers directed toward the appropriate <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> are performed.

40|$|Superior <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> {{dehiscence}} syndrome {{was first}} reported by Lloyd Minor and colleagues in 1998. Patients with a dehiscence {{in the bone}} overlying the superior <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> experience symptoms of pressure or sound-induced vertigo, bone conduction hyperacusis, and pulsatile tinnitus. The initial series of patients were diagnosed based on common symptoms, a physical examination finding of eye movements in {{the plane of the}} superior <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> when ear canal pressure or loud tones were applied to the ear, and high-resolution computed tomography imaging demonstrating a dehiscence in the bone over the superior <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal.</b> Research productivity directed at understanding better methods for diagnosing and treating this condition has substantially increased over the last two decades. We now have a sound understanding of the pathophysiology of third mobile window syndromes, higher resolution imaging protocols, and several sensitive and specific diagnostic tests. Furthermore, we have a treatment (surgical occlusion of the superior <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal)</b> that has demonstrated efficacy. This review will highlight some of the fundamental insights gained in SCDS, propose diagnostic criteria, and discuss future research directions...|$|R
5|$|The {{brain was}} {{slightly}} sigmoidal (S-shaped), without much {{expansion of the}} cerebral hemispheres, more like a crocodile than a bird. This {{is in keeping with}} the overall conservatism of non-coelurosaurian theropod brains. Acrocanthosaurus had large and bulbous olfactory bulbs, indicating a good sense of smell. Reconstructing the <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals</b> of the ear, which control balance, shows that the head was held at a 25° angle below horizontal. This was determined by orienting the endocast so that the lateral semicircular canal was parallel to the ground, as it usually is when an animal is in an alert posture.|$|E
5|$|Dynamic {{balance is}} {{provided}} through the three <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals.</b> These three canals are orthogonal (at right angles) to each other. At {{the end of}} each canal is a slight enlargement, known as the ampulla, which contains numerous cells with filaments in a central area called the cupula. The fluid in these canals rotates according to the momentum of the head. When a person changes acceleration, the inertia of the fluid changes. This affects the pressure on the cupula, and results in the opening of ion channels. This causes depolarisation, which is passed as a signal to the brain along the vestibulocochlear nerve. Dynamic balance also helps maintain eye tracking when moving, via the vestibulo–ocular reflex.|$|E
5|$|In a 2011 {{article for}} the International Journal of Otolaryngology, Jeremy Hornibrook {{discussed}} the inner ear disorder Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). BPPV {{is the most common}} cause of vertigo, a problem attributed to a detached otoconia in one of the <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals.</b> Hornibrook recommended a repositioning treatment for patients with BPPV from the posterior canal location. He wrote that the procedure most often performed for this purpose was a slightly transformed version of the Epley maneuver, and afterwards recommended carrying out a Dix–Hallpike test to assess the status of BPPV. If such a test was positive, Hornibrook recommended using a Magic Wand to deliver vibrations to the area of the mastoid process.|$|E

25|$|In rare cases, the {{crystals}} themselves can {{adhere to a}} <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> cupula, rendering it heavier than the surrounding endolymph.

25|$|The Dix–Hallpike test is {{a common}} test {{performed}} by examiners {{to determine whether the}} posterior <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> is involved. It involves a reorientation of the head to align the posterior <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> (at its entrance to the ampulla) with the direction of gravity. This test will reproduce vertigo and nystagmus characteristic of posterior canal BPPV.|$|R
5|$|The {{senses of}} Psittacosaurus can be {{inferred}} from the endocast. Large olfactory bulbs are present, indicating the genus had an acute sense of smell. The size of these bulbs are comparable to large predatory theropods, although they likely evolved to avoid predators instead of to seek out prey. The sclerotic rings in reptiles directly show {{the size of the}} eyeball. The rings are not well preserved in Psittacosaurus, with one individual preserving them likely contracted postmortem, but if they {{are similar to those of}} Protoceratops, Psittacosaurus would have had large eyes and acute vision. The curvature of the <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals</b> is related to the agility of reptiles, and the large curved canals in Psittacosaurus show that the genus was much more agile than later ceratopsians. Comparisons between the scleral rings of Psittacosaurus and modern birds and reptiles suggest that it may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day and for short intervals at night.|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{can hear}} {{both in the}} air and below water. They do not have {{external}} ears; the eardrums (tympanic membranes) are directly exposed or may be covered by a layer of skin and are visible as a circular area just behind the eye. The size and distance apart of the eardrums is related to the frequency and wavelength at which the frog calls. In some species such as the bullfrog, the size of the tympanum indicates the sex of the frog; males have tympani that are larger than their eyes while in females, the eyes and tympani are much the same size. A noise causes the tympanum to vibrate and the sound is transmitted to the middle and inner ear. The middle ear contains <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals</b> which help control balance and orientation. In the inner ear, the auditory hair cells are arranged in two areas of the cochlea, the basilar papilla and the amphibian papilla. The former detects high frequencies and the latter low frequencies. Because the cochlea is short, frogs use electrical tuning to extend their range of audible frequencies and help discriminate different sounds. This arrangement enables detection of the territorial and breeding calls of their conspecifics. In some species that inhabit arid regions, the sound of thunder or heavy rain may arouse them from a dormant state. A frog may be startled by an unexpected noise but it will not usually take any action until it has located the source of the sound by sight.|$|E

Case reportBilateral <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> aplasia was serendipitously discovered in a 24 -year-old male during assessment of unilateral mixed hearing loss with subnormal contralateral hearing. The deformity was isolated, with no associated syndrome. Discussion/ConclusionIncidence of this isolated entity is unknown, but doubtless greatly underestimated due to the absence of associated symptomatology. To the best of our knowledge, this is only the second report of bilateral aplasia of the entire <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> system involving unilateral hearing loss. A review of the literature focuses on the embryological and molecular aspects...|$|R
25|$|The {{primitive}} lampreys and hagfish, however, have {{a simpler}} system. The inner ear in these species {{consists of a}} single vestibular chamber, although in lampreys, this {{is associated with a}} series of sacs lined by cilia. Lampreys have only two <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals,</b> with the horizontal canal being absent, while hagfish have only a single, vertical, canal.|$|E
25|$|The {{vestibular}} {{system is}} {{the region of the}} inner ear where the <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals</b> converge, close to the cochlea. The vestibular system works with the visual system to keep objects in view when the head is moved. Joint and muscle receptors are also important in maintaining balance. The brain receives, interprets, and processes the information from all these systems to create the sensation of balance.|$|E
25|$|By {{comparison}} with the cochlear system, the vestibular system varies relatively little between the various groups of jawed vertebrates. The {{central part of the}} system consists of two chambers, the saccule and utricle, each of which includes one or two small clusters of sensory hair cells. All jawed vertebrates also possess three <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals</b> arising from the utricle, each with an ampulla containing sensory cells at one end.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} {{to determine if the}} arcuate eminence can be drilled down without opening the <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> to obtain a flatter operative field during an anterior or posterior transpetrosal approach. The depth of the superior <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> {{from the top of the}} arcuate eminence was measured in 43 dry temporal bones. We found that the arcuate eminence was situated approximately 20 mm from the petrosigmoid intersection, and the superior <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> was located 2. 0 mm deep from the top of the arcuate eminence (range, 0. 2 mm to 4. 2 mm). The arcuate eminence consists of either (1) the otic capsule and additional overlying bone, (2) the naked otic capsule of normal thickness, or (3) the thinned otic capsule. In cases strictly selected by preoperative computed tomography, it may be possible to drill down the arcuate eminence with meticulous manipulation. The relationship between opening the <b>semicircular</b> <b>canal</b> and hearing preservation is also discussed...|$|R

The sagittae are largest, found just behind the eyes and approximately level with them vertically. The lapilli and asterisci (smallest of the three) are located within the <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals.</b> The sagittae are normally composed of aragonite (although vaterite abnormalities can occur), as are the lapilli, while the asterisci are normally composed of vaterite.|$|E
25|$|The avian ear {{is adapted}} {{to pick up on}} slight and rapid changes of pitch found in bird song. General avian tympanic {{membrane}} form is ovular and slightly conical. Morphological differences in the middle ear are observed between species. Ossicles within green finches, blackbirds, song thrushes, and house sparrows are proportionately shorter to those found in pheasants, Mallard ducks, and sea birds. In song birds, a syrinx allows the respective possessors to create intricate melodies and tones. The middle avian ear is made up of three <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals,</b> each ending in an ampulla and joining to connect with the macula sacculus and lagena, of which the cochlea, a straight short tube to the external ear, branches from.|$|E
25|$|The braincase of Protoavis {{is similar}} in some respects to Troodon, with an {{enlarged}} cerebellum that shifted the optic lobes ventrolaterally, and also has a large floccular lobe. The inner ear is also pretty similar and bird-like in both taxa. The canalicular systems and the cochlear process differ in both taxa, and the vestibular region is relatively small and located in a ventral position {{to most of the}} anterior and posterior <b>semicircular</b> <b>canals.</b> The anterior semicircular canal is significantly longer than the others, and the cochlear process is a relatively long, vertically oriented tube. However, Protoavis is also remarkedly non-bird like in that it possess only a single exit for the trigeminal. However, these characters are not robust enough to identify Protoavis as a bird.|$|E
