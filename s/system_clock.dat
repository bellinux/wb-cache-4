25|$|Each {{participant}} on the EIB has one 16 byte read {{port and}} one 16 byte write port. The limit {{for a single}} participant is {{to read and write}} at a rate of 16 byte per EIB clock (for simplicity often regarded 8 byte per <b>system</b> <b>clock).</b> Note that each SPU processor contains a dedicated DMA management queue capable of scheduling long sequences of transactions to various endpoints without interfering with the SPU's ongoing computations; these DMA queues can be managed locally or remotely as well, providing additional flexibility in the control model.|$|E
25|$|Players {{discovered}} that the Switch's firmware included an Easter egg to allow players to play the NES Golf title via a built-in emulator. While Nintendo has not confirmed its presence, journalists and players {{believe this is a}} tribute to Nintendo's former president Satoru Iwata; Golf was programmed by Iwata, the game can only be accessed if the <b>system</b> <b>clock</b> is set to July 11, the day that Iwata died, and use the Joy-Con in a motion similar to how Iwata would present in his Nintendo Direct presentations. Some Japanese users referred to this as a omamori (charm) left by Iwata himself.|$|E

25|$|Sony {{confirmed}} {{that there was}} an error and stated that it was narrowing down the issue and were continuing to work to restore service. By March 2 (UTC), 2010, owners of original PS3 models could connect to PSN successfully and the clock no longer showed December 31, 1999. Sony stated that the affected models incorrectly identified 2010 as a leap year, because of a bug in the BCD method of storing the date. However, for some users, the hardware's operating <b>system</b> <b>clock</b> (mainly updated from the internet and not associated with the internal clock) needed to be updated manually or by re-syncing it via the internet.|$|E
25|$|The EIB is {{presently}} implemented as a circular ring consisting of four 16 bytes wide unidirectional channels which counter-rotate in pairs. When traffic patterns permit, each channel can convey {{up to three}} transactions concurrently. As the EIB runs at half the <b>system</b> <b>clock</b> rate the effective channel rate is 16 bytes every two system clocks. At maximum concurrency, with three active transactions {{on each of the}} four rings, the peak instantaneous EIB bandwidth is 96 bytes per clock (12 concurrent transactions * 16 bytes wide / 2 system clocks per transfer). While this figure is often quoted in IBM literature it is unrealistic to simply scale this number by processor clock speed. The arbitration unit imposes additional constraints which are discussed in the Bandwidth Assessment section below.|$|E
25|$|The taskbar {{has seen}} the biggest visual changes, where the old Quick Launch toolbar has been {{replaced}} {{with the ability to}} pin applications to taskbar. Buttons for pinned applications are integrated with the task buttons. These buttons also enable Jump Lists to allow easy access to common tasks. The revamped taskbar also allows the reordering of taskbar buttons. To the far right of the <b>system</b> <b>clock</b> is a small rectangular button that serves as the Show desktop icon. By default, hovering over this button makes all visible windows transparent for {{a quick look at the}} desktop. In touch-enabled displays such as touch screens, tablet PCs, etc., this button is slightly (8 pixels) wider in order to accommodate being pressed by a finger. Clicking this button minimizes all windows, and clicking it a second time restores them.|$|E

2500|$|The VIC-II was {{manufactured}} with 5 micrometer NMOS {{technology and}} was clocked at either [...] (PAL) or [...] (NTSC). Internally, the clock was divided down {{to generate the}} dot clock (about 8MHz) and the two-phase system clocks (about 1MHz; the exact pixel and <b>system</b> <b>clock</b> speeds are slightly different between NTSC and PAL machines). At such high clock rates, the chip generated a lot of heat, forcing MOS Technology to use a ceramic dual in-line package called a [...] "CERDIP". The ceramic package was more expensive, but it dissipated heat more effectively than plastic.|$|E

2500|$|On March 1, 2010 (UTC), {{many of the}} {{original}} [...] "fat" [...] PlayStation 3 models worldwide were experiencing errors related to their internal <b>system</b> <b>clock.</b> The error had many symptoms. Initially, the main problem {{seemed to be the}} inability to connect to the PlayStation Network. However, the root cause of the problem was unrelated to the PlayStation Network, since even users who had never been online also had problems playing installed offline games (which queried the system timer as part of startup) and using system themes. At the same time many users noted that the console's clock had gone back to December 31, 1999. The event was nicknamed the ApocalyPS3, a play on the word [...] and PS3, the abbreviation for the PlayStation 3 console.|$|E

It is possible to construct a new four-dimensional symmetry framework incorporating common time: observers in different inertial frames of reference use one and the same <b>clock</b> <b>system,</b> which is located in any one of the frames. Consequently, simultaneity has a meaning independent of position and independent of frame of reference. A further consequence is that the two-way speeds of light alone are isotropic in any frame. By the choice of <b>clock</b> <b>system</b> there will be one frame in which the one-way speed of light is isotropic. This frame can be arbitrarily chosen. The difference between one-way speeds and two-way speeds of light signals is considered in detail...|$|R
