Such hot spots (which are not tile edges) can persist for several seconds and are more common at the inner divertor, than the outer.

Whereas sub-micron particles are often tungsten spheres, larger ones are agglomerates from tungsten in a boron/carbon matrix. Extrapolation of the measurement yields to 80 mg of carbon and 1200 mg of tungsten in the dust, including 510 mg of tungsten spheres.

40|$|Two {{types of}} H-modes are {{generally}} observed in Alcator C-Mod – ELM free and EDA. ELM-free H-mode {{is characterized by}} the absence of any kind of edge pedestal relaxation mechanisms and, therefore, by an enhanced impurity confinement. Both plasma density and radiated power rise rapidly during an ELM-free H-mode and it terminates in radiative collapse. In contrast, EDA H-mode usually exists {{for as long as the}} auxiliary heating is applied. It is a steady state regime with constant line average density and radiated power, no <b>significant</b> <b>impurity</b> accumulation throughout the discharge, and energy confinement comparable to that of ELM-free H-mode. It was shown previously [1] that in EDA H-mode the enhanced impurity transport across the edge barrier is provided by a quasicoherent electromagnetic mode (QC mode) localized at the pedestal region. The QC mode is clearly seen in EDA as a narrow band (∆f ~ 10 kHz) density fluctuations at ~ 100 kHz. In contrast, ELM-free H-mode is characterized by decreasing level of fluctuation relative to L-mode. It was shown in [1] that the transition to EDA regime occurs at q 95 (q at 95 % flux surface) of about 3. 5 and higher. At lower values of q 95 only ELM-free regime can be obtained.

Both liquid and solid phases are present simultaneously in our simulation volumes. We identify liquid, solid, and interface regions in our simulations using a bond angle metric. In general we find good agreement for the composition of liquid and solid phases between our MD simulations and the semi analytic model of Medin and Cumming. The trace presence of a third component, neon, does not appear to strongly impact the chemical separation found previously for two component carbon and oxygen systems. This suggests that small amounts of 22 Ne may not qualitatively change how the material in white dwarf stars freezes. However, we do find systematically lower melting temperatures (higher Gamma) in our MD simulations compared to the semi analytic model. This difference seems to grow with impurity parameter Q_imp and suggests a problem with simple corrections to the linear mixing rule for the free energy of multicomponent solid mixtures that is used in the semi analytic model.

40|$|Abstract: The {{anticipated}} {{regime of}} ITER is the H-mode {{in which the}} ELMs can significantly deteriorate the operation. The lost plasma is dumped into the SOL and then impacts on the target producing sputtering and vaporization erosion. The following contamination of core plasma by eroded atoms can interrupt the confinement. For tokamak modelling with account for the transients, the tokamak geometry MHD codes FOREV and TOKES have been developed. The FOREV models the processes on the time scale of 1 ms with the CFC wall. The modelling for ITER plasma evolution following the carbon influxes revealed that <b>significant</b> <b>impurity</b> contamination of the edge plasma can occur, which can cause large radiation losses and eventually lead {{to the collapse of}} the confinement at lesser ELM sizes than that determined by armour lifetime limitations. The TOKES is developed for the integrated simulation on the discharge scale (10 3 s), however permitting multiple ELMs. Multi-fluid plasma and corona radiation transport are implemented. In the modelling for ITER with B-C-W wall, the scattered atoms have significant chances to strike secondarily the dome and thus produce sputtered W-atoms even with the CFC wall at the separatrix strike point. The ELMs cause untimely discharge interruption if the ELM energy exceeds the vaporization onset. To validate the codes, dedicated experiments have been carried out. CFC targets manufactured for ITER have been exposed at the plasma gun MK- 200 UG in TRINITI. On the basis of these experiments, significant plasma contamination is expected for ITER transients at the target heat deposition above 0. 5 MJ/m 2, which corresponds to the vapour shield threshold and agrees with the FOREV and TOKES simulations. 1...|$|E

40|$|AbstractStringent {{requirements}} {{are in place}} for the evaluation and registration of new compounds with biocidal or pesticidal activities. However, the registration requirements for established compounds from new suppliers or for established compounds produced by a different manufacturing process have been less clear and ambiguity exists as to how ‘equivalence of health hazards’ can unequivocally be demonstrated analytically and by toxicological assays. The case presented in this analysis focuses on the chiral pyrethroid transfluthrin (TFL) synthesized by esterification of an acid chloride and alcoholic moiety. According to any modifications of the process of synthesis and purification, new potentially highly toxic and yet chemically reactive impurities in low concentrations (< 0. 1 %) may be formed. Amongst these, that with the structural alert ‘organic acid anhydride’ was given heightened concern as the most potent putative toxicologically <b>significant</b> <b>impurity.</b> The course taken in this analysis focused on the comparison of reference TFL with commercialized generic TFL from two alternative manufacturing sources in India and China. Despite their apparent high racemic purity, TFLs from generic sources were biologically less effective, genotoxic in the Ames’ assay, demonstrated sensory lung irritation and lung/skin sensitization in specialized bioassays. While the off-patent reference TFL was unequivocally negative in all assays (anhydride content not detectable, LOQ < 0. 01 %), positive results with high batch-to-batch variability were a frequent outcome in generic TFLs. Tier I analytical assays failed to detect this relevant impurity in the absence of impurity-specific optimized analytical procedures. This finding suggests that a well-balanced combined approach of analytical and toxicological assays provides the best means to assure that all critical impurities are identified and accounted for. Similarly, putative ‘structural alert’-based toxicity tests proved to be more predictive than any indiscriminant battery of standard bioassays commonly applied to demonstrate equivalence, such as acute oral/dermal toxicity and/or eye/skin irritation assays...|$|E

Reprocessing WEEE presents many technical challenges. The combination of metals found in WEEE {{is not the same as}} that found in ores, so the smelting techniques and slag systems that produce good recoveries of valuable metals from concentrates may not also produce high recoveries from WEEE. One attractive option for reprocessing WEEE is to add it to the feed to a secondary copper smelter using the traditional black copper route. Good examples of valuable minor elements in WEEE are tin and indium. The distribution behaviour of tin in common slags in copper smelting, calcium ferrite slag and ferrous silicate slag, is known but the behaviour of tin in ferrous calcium silicate slag is unknown.

40|$|The {{capability}} of Ion Cyclotron Resonance Frequency (ICRF) systems to reliably inject high power levels into ELMy plasmas is essential {{both for the}} JET research program and for future ITER operations. In parallel with the installation and commissioning of the ITER-like antenna (ILA), the conventional ICRF A 2 antenna system has been significantly modified to improve its performance. The ILA consists of a closely packed array of 4 Resonant Double Loops with in-vessel matching capacitors and low impedance Conjugate-T points. It has demonstrated efficient trip-free ELM tolerant operation on ELMy plasmas with high power densities (up to 6. 2 MW/m 2 on L-mode and 4. 1 MW/m 2 on H-mode) and voltages up to 42 kV without <b>significant</b> <b>impurity</b> production. The ILA further provided validation of the ICRF coupling modeling code Topica. This is relevant for antenna design for ITER as it demonstrates that with ITER's presently estimated density proles its proposed ICRF system is able to couple 20 MW with a system voltage below 45 kV. The conjugate-T junction principle was also used by pairing straps from A 2 antennas C and D thus creating 4 conjugate-T points outside the vacuum vessel. Additionally, the load tolerant circuit installed in 2005, based on 3 dB hybrid couplers feeding straps from A 2 antenna arrays A and B in pairs, was updated for more extensive use. Both load tolerant approaches have demonstrated robust and reliable performance during operations {{in a variety of}} plasma loading conditions including on large Type I ELMs. Depending on the plasma scenario, the trip-free time-average power levels coupled to ELMy H-mode plasma during long pulse operations have reached 3. 3 MW for the 3 dB hybrid and 4 MW for the External Conjugate-T (ECT) system.

40|$|Evidence from {{research}} papers supporting {{the hypothesis that}} the exothermic nuclear reactions providing the observed episodes of excess heat in deuterated palladium (Pd) and titanium (Ti) are Oppenheimer-Phillips (OP) reactions between deuterons and nuclei of the host metal, Pd or Ti and their <b>significant</b> <b>impurities.</b> Details of the supporting evidence hinge upon neutron activation analysis (NAA) of metal samples before and after production of excess heat episodes plus observation of gamma ray emissions from plausible products of the OP reactions. One example of an OP reaction in palladium is Pd 108 + d →Pd 109 + p, where d and p represent the deuteron and proton respectively. Thus the neutron half of the deuteron has been “stripped away” from its associated proton, leading to the reaction being named the “deuteron stripping” reaction. The strength of the evidence cited in this paper is surprising in light of the high atomic number on the metal atom side of the reaction equation, 46 for Pd and 22 for Ti. If further confirmed it is clear that some extreme shielding of the coulombic repulsion of the metal atom's high positive charge must be present to allow close enough approach of deuterons to the metal atom nuclei for stripping reactions to occur...|$|R

The microspheres were characterized for drug load, impurity content, and particle size. Further, the microspheres were subjected to in vitro release testing in acetate buffer (pH 4. 0) and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7. 2). In acetate buffer, 3 microsphere batches composed of low molecular weight PLGA 50 ∶ 50, PLGA 85 ∶ 15, and PLA polymers (≤ 10 kDa) showed 100 % release with minimal impurity formation (< 10 %). The high molecular weight PLGA 50 ∶ 50 microspheres (28 kDa) displayed only 70 % cumulative release in acetate buffer with <b>significant</b> <b>impurity</b> formation (∼ 24 %). In PBS (pH 7. 4), on the other hand, only 50 % release was observed with the same low molecular weight batches (PLGA 50 ∶ 50, PLGA 85 ∶ 15, and PLA) with higher percentages of hydrophobic impurity formation (ie, 40 %, 26 %, and 10 %, respectively). In addition, in PBS, the high molecular weight PLGA 50 ∶ 50 microspheres showed only 20 % drug release with ∼ 60 % mean impurity content. The chemically modified peptide impurities inside microspheres were structurally confirmed through Fourier transform-mass spectrometry (FT-MS) and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses after extraction procedures. The adduct compounds were identified as covalently modified conjugates of octreotide with lactic and glycolic acid monomers within polymeric microspheres.

After the start of LHD {{experiment}} in 1998, the magnetic field has been gradually raised up to 2. 89 T. The heating power has been increased, up to 4. 2 MW for NBI, 1. 3 MW for ICRF, and 0. 9 MW for ECRH, Upgrading the key hardware systems has led to the extension of the plasma parameters to (i) higher T_e [T_e(0) = 4. 4 keV at = 5. 3 x 10 ^ 18 m^- 3 and P_abs = 1. 8 MW], (ii) higher confinement [tau_E = 0. 3 s, T_e(0) = 1. 1 keV at = 6. 5 x 10 ^ 19 m^- 3 and P_abs = 2. 0 MW] and (iii) higher stored energy W_p^dia = 880 kJ. High performance plasmas have been realized in the inward shifted magnetic axis configuration (R= 3. 6 m) where the helical symmetry is recovered and the particle orbit properties are improved by trade off of MHD stability properties due to the appearance of the magnetic hill. The energy confinement was systematically higher than that predicted by the Intemational Stellerator Scaling 95 up to a factor of I. 6 and was comparable with ELMy H-mode confinement capability in tokamaks. This confinement improvement is attributed to the configuration control (the inward shift of magnetic axis) and to the formation of the high edge temperature. The achieved average beta value reached 2. 4 % at B= 1. 3 T, the highest beta value ever obtained in helical devices, and so far no degradation of confinement by MHD phenomenon is observed. The inward shifted configuration has also led to successful ICRF minority ion heating. ICRF power up to 1. 3 MW was reliably injected into the plasma without <b>significant</b> <b>impurity</b> contamination and a plasma with a stored energy of 200 kJ was sustained for 5 sec by ICRF alone.

High oxide ion conductivity has been recently reported in the apatite phases La 10 -yM 6 O 26 +/-z (M = Si, Ge). Preliminary work focused on the preparation and characterisation of single phase samples of previously reported phases, e. g. La 9. 33 (Si/Ge) 6 O 26 and La 8 A 2 (Si/Ge) 6 O 26 (A = alkaline earth). Neutron diffraction studies revealed significant disorder within the oxygen channels for systems showing high oxide ion conductivity, namely non-stoichiometric systems containing either cation vacancies, e. g.

Conversely, fully stoichiometric systems, e. g. La 8 Sr 2 Si 6 O 26, showed poor oxide ion conduction, which appears to be associated with oxygen ordering within the channels. A range of doping studies followed in order to optimise the oxide ion conductivity, i. e. La 9. 33 +x/ 3 Si 6 -xMxO 26 (M = Al, B, Ga) and (La/M) 10 -xSi 6 O 26 +/-y (M = Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba). The sample La 9 BaSi 6 O 26. 5 showed the highest conductivity, with a value of 6 x 10 - 3 S cm- 1 at 500 °C, which is significantly higher than that of YSZ at this temperature (1 x 10 - 3 S cm- 1). This sample is therefore a highly promising candidate material for use as an electrolyte in intemiediate temperature SOFCs (500 °C - 700 °C), as well as other technological applications. Similar studies were performed for samples with germanium in place of silicon. High oxide ion conductivity was observed for these systems, although germanium volatility was identified as a significant problem in these cases. In terms of cathode materials research has involved the preparation of a range of perovskite type phases based on YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -x (YBCO). The compositions tested were of formula type YSr 2 Cu 3 -xMxO 7 -y (M = Ga, Co, Fe), and the results indicated that these samples were not promising candidates as replacement cathode materials since, they all showed only moderately high conductivity. Furthermore, the phases were shown not to be chemically compatible with most current or prospective electrolyte materials, with <b>significant</b> <b>impurity</b> phases found to be produced when the electrolyte and cuprate were heated together at SOFC operating temperatures (900 °C - 1000 °C) ...|$|E

As well, the properties of these materials under shock compression are of interest for calculating groundshock propagation. The authors have synthesized, characterized, and performed Hugoniot measurements on monolithic polycrystalline SiO{sub 2 } samples which were predominantly stishovite (a high-pressure polymorph). Synthesis was accomplished in a multianvil press with pyrophyllite gaskets and carbon heaters. The samples had densities ranging from 3. 80 to 4. 07, corresponding to stishovite volume fractions of 0. 7 to 0. 87, a range confirmed by NMR analysis. Electron microprobe and X-ray fluorescence characterizations showed minor carbon contamination (< 1 %), with no other <b>significant</b> <b>impurities.</b> Samples {approximately} 1 mm thick and 3 mm diameter were tested in reverse and forward-ballistics modes on a two-stage light gas gun, using velocity interferometry diagnostics. Impact velocities ranged from 4. 0 to 6. 5 km/sec. Hugoniot stresses for four tests ranged from 65 to 225 GPa. At higher stresses significant uncertainties arise due to impact tilt/nonplanarity issues. Results are consistent with earlier predictions of the stishovite Hugoniot based on quartz-centered Hugoniot data, static-compression (diamond-anvil cell) data and hydrostatic multianvil cell data. Release behavior appears to be frozen. These results are remarkable {{in view of the}} small size of the samples used. Results are compared with current EOS models...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} review reveals current analytical methodologies used for pharmaceutical analysis, their advantages and disadvantages. In this context {{the potential of}} capillary electrophoresis (CE) is established through {{a study of the}} current literature. Capillary electrophoresis method is developed and optimised for alkylxanthines. The achieved separation for these analytes stands out for its high efficiency and especially short analysis time. This work also verifies the potential of CE in the analysis of <b>significant</b> <b>impurities</b> in montelukast sodium - an active ingredient for treatment of bronchial asthma. The obtained method surpasses a chromatographic method currently employed in the pharmaceutical industry in terms of efficiency and time of analysis. Along with the method development this work shows the capability of CE as a fundamental research tool. The determination of the association constants of steroid hormones with cyclodextrins is successfully achieved from the electrophoretic mobilities. A range of different types of natural and derivatised cyclodextrins is investigated. This straightforward approach marks the first time CE has been used for the assessment of steroid/cyclodextrin interaction. For the first time the versatility of CE is demonstrated in the separation of different types of anticancer drugs - anthracyclines and taxanes. The high hydrophobicity of the drugs requires detailed investigation of suitable buffer composition with additives of miscellaneous component and organic phase. The use of these drugs in combination therapy sparked the interest in this application and this study shows the potential of CE for such a challenge. To demonstrate the potential an attempt is made to apply the developed electrophoretic methods to the analysis of plasma samples...|$|R
30|$|One way of {{increasing}} the response speed of semiconductor devices and reducing their power consumption {{is to use a}} semiconductor with a high-carrier mobility. Examples of such materials include Ge as well as its alloys and compounds. However, when a structure is formed by stacking a layer of a semiconductor material on top of a substrate of a different semiconductor, problems may arise. For example, the difference in the lattice sizes of the semiconductor substrate and the overlying layer of a different semiconductor material may cause dislocations, which may have an adverse effect on device performance. Conventionally, in order to fabricate Ge-based semiconductor devices that include a Si substrate, a thicker buffer layer or sacrificial layer (e.g., a Si/Ge buffer layer) is formed on the silicon substrate. Subsequently, a Ge epitaxial layer is grown on the Si/Ge buffer layer. Next, anisotropic and isotropic etching processes are performed sequentially to remove a part of the buffer layer and retain the Ge epitaxial layer. VLSI devices must show a high drive current, low off-state leakage current, and low supply voltage, in order to ensure high performance, including low standby power consumption and reduced dynamic power dissipation. Currently, strain-enhanced mobility, high-k/metal gate, and three-dimensional (3 D) device architecture at the 22  nm node [1] are some of the technologies being used for the continuous scaling of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) devices with a Si channel. In addition to characteristics such as high mobility, new device architectures such as those of gate-all-around (GAA) [2] and ultrathin-body field-effect transistors (FETs) [3] are needed to improve electrostatic control in the sub- 10  nm nodes. Ge-based GAA pFETs [4] and nFETs [5] with inversion-mode (INV) operation have been demonstrated. However, junction formation in Ge INV devices is a critical issue owing to the low dopant solubility, rapid dopant diffusion, and low thermal budget. To solve these issues, junction-less (JL) devices [6] that use a heavy doped channel with the same carrier type as that of the source/drain (S/D) regions have been suggested as alternatives. However, the rapid scaling of transistors requires the development of new and more effective devices that can catch up with modern transistors. In recent years, JL-FETs {{have been found to be}} promising as next-generation transistors. The JL-FET is basically a resistor in which the mobile carrier density can be controlled by the gate. In the ON state, a large body current exists, owing to the relatively high doping concentration in the channel region; the surface accumulation current is added to this current The level of doping in the JL-FET needs to be high in order to achieve a suitable current drive, while the device cross-section needs to be small enough such that the device can be turned off. However, in the case of highly doped JL-FETs, the carriers undergo <b>significant</b> <b>impurity</b> scattering, owing to which the drive current is significantly degraded [7]. Furthermore, JL-FETs have the advantages of being simple to fabricate and have high charge mobility and low gate capacitance, in contrast to INV devices [8 – 12]. Recently, double-gate [13] and body-tied tri-gate [14] Ge JL-FET pMOSFETs were demonstrated on germanium-on-insulator substrates and bulk Si, respectively.|$|E
40|$|The modern coalbed methane {{industry}} {{was born in}} the Black Warrior Basin of Alabama and has to date produced more than 2. 6 trillion cubic feet of gas and 1. 6 billion barrels of water. The coalbed gas industry in this area is dependent on instream disposal of co-produced water, which ranges from nearly potable sodium-bicarbonate water to hypersaline sodium-chloride water. This study employed diverse analytical methods to characterize water chemistry in light of the regional geologic framework and to evaluate the full range of water management options for the Black Warrior coalbed methane industry. Results reveal strong interrelationships among regional geology, water chemistry, and gas chemistry. Coalbed methane is produced from multiple coal seams in Pennsylvanian-age strata of the Pottsville Coal Interval, in which water chemistry is influenced by a structurally controlled meteoric recharge area along the southeastern margin of the basin. The most important constituents of concern in the produced water include chlorides, ammonia compounds, and organic substances. Regional mapping and statistical analysis indicate that the concentrations of most ionic compounds, metallic substances, and nonmetallic substances correlate with total dissolved solids and chlorides. Gas is effectively produced at pipeline quality, and the only <b>significant</b> <b>impurity</b> is N{sub 2 }. Geochemical analysis indicates that the gas is of mixed thermogenic-biogenic origin. Stable isotopic analysis of produced gas and calcite vein fills indicates that widespread late-stage microbial methanogenesis occurred primarily along a CO{sub 2 } reduction metabolic pathway. Organic compounds in the produced water appear to have helped sustain microbial communities. Ammonia and ammonium levels increase with total dissolved solids content and appear to {{have played a role in}} late-stage microbial methanogenesis and the generation of N{sub 2 }. Gas production tends to decline exponentially, whereas water production tends to decline hyperbolically. Hyperbolic decline indicates that water volume is of greatest concern early in the life of a coalbed methane project. Regional mapping indicates that gas production is controlled primarily by the ability to depressurize permeable coal seams that are natively within the steep part of the adsorption isotherm. Water production is greatest within the freshwater intrusion and below thick Cretaceous cover strata and is least in areas of underpressure. Water management strategies include instream disposal, which can be applied effectively in most parts of the basin. Deep disposal may be applicable locally, particularly where high salinity limits the ability to dispose into streams. Artificial wetlands show promise for the management of saline water, especially where the reservoir yield is limited. Beneficial use options include municipal water supply, agricultural use, and industrial use. The water may be of use to an inland shrimp farming industry, which is active around the southwestern coalbed methane fields. The best opportunities for beneficial use are reuse of water by the coalbed methane industry for drilling and hydraulic fracturing. This research has further highlighted opportunities for additional research on treatment efficiency, the origin of nitrogen compounds, organic geochemistry, biogenic gas generation, flow modeling, and computer simulation. Results of this study are being disseminated through a vigorous technology transfer program that includes web resources, numerous presentations to stakeholders, and a variety of technical publications...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the structural and preliminary electrical characterisation of various “shifted” hexagonal B-site deficient perovskites, of generic formula, A 4 B 3 O 12. These ceramics {{are reported to}} possess promising microwave dielectric properties, which are a requirement {{for use in the}} ever evolving mobile telecommunications industry. The 12 R crystal structures of the Ba 3 -xSrxLaNb 3 O 12 series (x = 1 – 3) were refined at variable temperatures using NPD data in space group R- 3 and some interesting behaviour was exhibited. All compositions were found to be antiphase tilted, the extent of which being dependent on the A-cation size. Upon heating, the tilt angle for all members of the series was found to decrease, although no tilt transitions from R- 3 to R- 3 m were witnessed for all phases up to 900 °C, and a change in the magnitude of permittivity at 1 MHz was observed for all members except, BaSr 2 LaNb 3 O 12. Additionally evidence from preliminary low temperature data suggest relaxor ferroelectric type behaviour. Ba 2 SrLaNb 3 O 12 was found to possess the most promising dielectric properties although room exists for further improvement of the quality factor (Q value). To facilitate further tuning of the dielectric properties, specifically Q, the Ba 3 - xSrxLaNb 3 -yTayO 12 series (x = 0 - 3, y = 1 - 2) was investigated, with the introduction of Ta 5 + on the B-site. Some interesting ordering of A- and B-sites was found to occur, and furthermore, Nb 5 + was found to display a preference to inhabit the distorted environment of B(1), adjacent to the “shifted” region, compared to the undistorted B(2) site, in the perovskite block. Unusual microwave dielectric properties were displayed with all compositions exhibiting small and positive temperature coefficient of resonant frequency (TCF) values and significantly small Q values, the reverse of what is expected, thus implying that the B-site has some influence on TCF values in this case. The interesting dielectric properties may be explained by several factors, including, the increased strength associated with the covalency of the Ta-O bond compared to that of Nb-O and the presence of some <b>significant</b> <b>impurity</b> phases, particularly in the intermediate compositions that are richer in Ta 5 +. The LCR data collected revealed similar results as found for the Ba 3 -xSrxLaNb 3 O 12 series (x = 1 – 3), highlighting the limiting nature of the temperature range which did not, in fact reflect the true response of the compositions’ behaviour. All of the compositions are antiphase tilted at room temperature therefore the collection of variable temperature diffraction data is warranted. A range of novel Ta-based intergrowth compounds were synthesised and preliminarily characterised. No detailed structural or electrical data were collected for these compounds, however, the ability to form Ta-based intergrowths, in the first instance, has been established. It is postulated that by the formation of these intergrowth phases, the dielectric properties will be effectively tuned in comparison to those of the parent oxides that they are composed of, due to the regularisation of the octahedral layers that occurs upon the formation of such intergrowth structures. This often leads to improved TCF values, and by the introduction of Ta 5 +, can also give improved Q values. Ta 5 + was substituted for Nb 5 + in the untilted 5 x 6 y (x = 1 – 3, y = 1) layered compounds, however, it was found that to facilitate this, the replacement of Ba 2 + for Sr 2 + was also required on the A-site. This double substitution was a requirement to obtain compositions closer to single phase Ta-rich phases compared to Nb-rich compositions...|$|E

40|$|Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) {{are high}} {{temperature}} solid-state electrochemical devices that convert fuel into {{electricity and heat}} with high efficiency. Many fuels suitable for SOFCs derive from hydrocarbon sources, such as natural gas or biogas; however, these contain <b>significant</b> <b>impurities,</b> most notably compounds containing sulphur, which can poison the nickel electrocatalyst in the anode of the fuel cell. Sulphur removal is usually carried out but it is complicated and expensive to achieve levels below 1 part per million (ppm). An enhanced scientific understanding of chemical interactions {{on the surface of}} SOFC electrodes is critical to the development of robust nickel-based anodes, but the mechanisms and effects of sulphur poisoning are not fully understood. The scope of this thesis is to advance the field of sulphur-poisoning research by studying the effect of current density on the sulphur-induced degradation, and focuses on intermediate-temperature (IT) conditions with nickel-gadolinia doped ceria (Ni-CGO), which is the most promising anode material for IT-SOFCs, operating between 600 – 800 °C. The work of this thesis is aimed at (i) investigating the kinetics of sulphur poisoning, and the effect of current density, by use of a specially built three-electrode electrochemical test rig; (ii) analysis of structural modifications to the anode microstructure as a result of exposure to fuel cell conditions and (iii) development and prototype testing of a miniature SOFC test rig with optical access for in situ Raman spectroscopy. Fuel cell operation at higher current density was found to partially mitigate the sulphur poisoning of up to 3 ppm H 2 S in H 2 fuel, while microstructural analysis found that the presence of as little as 0. 5 ppm H 2 S accelerated restructuring of nickel grain surfaces. Finally, preliminary proof-of-concept results were obtained for the in situ Raman rig, and suggestions for a future design are discussed.
