5|$|It is not {{possible}} to estimate the chances of another very bright Kreutz comet arriving in the near future, but given that at least 10 have reached naked eye visibility over the last 200 years, another great comet from the Kreutz family <b>seems</b> <b>almost</b> certain to arrive at some point. Comet White–Ortiz–Bolelli in 1970 reached an apparent magnitude of 1. In December 2011, Kreutz sungrazer C/2011 W3 (Lovejoy) survived its perihelion passage and had an apparent magnitude of −3.|$|E

I was anxious to secure the cooperation of such a worker as an honor to my corps. I could not be responsible for the field he selected in as much as I pay him no salary and a portion of his expenses. You will see therefore that while it is not a pleasant thing to work in competition with others it <b>seems</b> <b>almost</b> a necessity. You can sympathize.|$|E
5|$|The literary, {{as well as}} the historical, {{value of}} the Historia Augusta has {{suffered}} greatly {{as a result of the}} method of its composition. In the arrangement in categories of the historical material, the authors did but follow the accepted principles of the art of biography as practised in antiquity, but their narratives, consisting often of mere excerpts arranged without regard to connexion or transition, lack grace and even cohesion. The over-emphasis of personal details and the introduction of anecdotal material destroy the proportion of many sections, and the insertion of forged documents interrupts the course of the narrative, without adding anything of historical value or even of general interest. Finally, the later addition of lengthy passages and brief notes, frequently in paragraphs with the general content of which they have no connexion, has put the crowning touch to the awkwardness and incoherence of the whole, with the result that the oft-repeated charge <b>seems</b> <b>almost</b> justified, that these biographies are little more than literary monstrosities.|$|E

25|$|A nuclear renaissance is {{possible}} but cannot occur overnight. Nuclear projects face significant hurdles, including extended construction periods and related risks, long licensing processes and manpower shortages, plus long‐standing {{issues related to}} waste disposal, proliferation and local opposition. The financing of new nuclear power plants, especially in liberalized markets, has always been difficult and the financial crisis <b>seems</b> <b>almost</b> certain to have made it even more so. The huge capital requirements, combined with risks of cost overruns and regulatory uncertainties, make investors and lenders very cautious, even when demand growth is robust.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand, {{commonly}} referred to as the All Blacks, are the most successful team in international rugby. They have a positive winning record against all Test nations, and have a win record of over 74% The first All Blacks Test match was played against Australia at Sydney Cricket Ground on 15 August 1903. New Zealand won 22 - 3, with The Sydney Morning Herald saying, 'The present New Zealand team have shown form so far in advance of every fifteen opposed to them that it <b>seems</b> <b>almost</b> impossible for Australia to put a side into the field with any hope of victory...'.|$|E

25|$|The long fantasies form bridges {{between the}} limerent's {{ordinary}} {{life and that}} intensely desired ecstatic moment. The duration and complexity of a fantasy depend {{on the availability of}} time and freedom from distractions. The bliss of the imagined moment of consummation is greater when events imagined to precede it are possible (though they often represent grave departures from the probable). Not always is it entirely pleasant, and when rejection seems likely the thoughts focus on despair, sometimes to the point of suicide. The pleasantness or unpleasantness of the state <b>seems</b> <b>almost</b> unrelated to the intensity of the reaction. Although the direction of feeling, i.e. happy versus unhappy, shifts rapidly, with 'dramatic surges of buoyancy and despair', the intensity of intrusive and involuntary thinking alters less rapidly, and only in response to an accumulation of experiences with the particular limerent object.|$|E

500|$|Following Burges's {{death in}} 1881, {{work on the}} {{interior}} continued for another ten years. The castle was little used, the Marquess never came after its completion, and its main function was as a family sanatorium, although the Marchioness and her daughter, Lady Margaret Crichton-Stuart, did occupy it for a period {{following the death of}} the Marquess in 1900. In 1950, the 5th Marquess of Bute handed the castle over to the Ministry of Works. McLees views it as [...] "one of the greatest Victorian triumphs of architectural composition", whilst Crook writes of Burges [...] "recreating from a heap of rubble a fairy-tale castle which <b>seems</b> <b>almost</b> to have materialised from the margins of a medieval manuscript." ...|$|E

500|$|Castell Coch's {{external}} features and the High Victorian interiors led the historian David McLees {{to describe it}} as [...] "one of the greatest Victorian triumphs of architectural composition." [...] The exterior, based on 19th-century studies by the antiquarian George Clark, is relatively authentic in style, although its three stone towers were adapted by Burges to present a dramatic silhouette, closer in design to mainland European castles such as Chillon than native British fortifications. The interiors were elaborately decorated, with specially designed furniture and fittings; the designs include extensive use of symbolism drawing on classical and legendary themes. Joseph Mordaunt Crook wrote that the castle represented [...] "the learned dream world of a great patron and his favourite architect, recreating from a heap of rubble a fairy-tale castle which <b>seems</b> <b>almost</b> to have materialised from the margins of a medieval manuscript." ...|$|E

Speaking of the title shortly after its announcement in November 2006, Wentz stated [...] "As for what that means {{in relation to the}} record, we'll just let it unfold when people hear it." [...] While Wentz declined to reveal the relationship between the title and the album's songs, MTV reporter James Montgomery opined that [...] "It's not difficult to see it as a statement about the band rising above detractors and finding strength within themselves." ...|$|E
500|$|Sometime during August 1861, Sam Jr. {{enlisted in}} the Confederate States Army 2nd Texas Infantry Regiment, Company C Bayland Guards, sending Margaret into melancholia. She dreaded that her first-born child would never be home again. [...] "My heart <b>seems</b> <b>almost</b> broken... what shall I do? How shall I bear it? When I first heard the news, I thought I would lie down and die," [...] she wrote to her mother. Houston tried to help out by {{assuming}} care of their other children in between his extended visits to Galveston. Her fears seemed well-founded when her son was critically wounded and left for dead at the April 1862 Battle of Shiloh. A second bullet was stopped by his Bible, bearing an inside inscription from Margaret. He was found languishing in a field by a Union Army clergyman who picked up the Bible and also found a letter from Margaret in his pocket. Taken prisoner and sent to Camp Douglas in Illinois, he was later released in a prisoner exchange and received a medical discharge in October.|$|E

500|$|A popular hymn, still sung in the churches, {{was first}} {{recorded}} in the late [...] It hails King St. Stephen as [...] "radiant star of Hungarians". Ludwig van Beethoven composed his King Stephen Overture for the inauguration of the Hungarian theatre in Pest in 1812. According to musician James M.

Hungarian composer Ferenc Erkel named his last complete opera from 1885, István király ("King Stephen"), after him. In 1938, Zoltán Kodály wrote a choral piece titled Ének Szent István Királyhoz ("Hymn to King Stephen"). [...] In 1983, Levente Szörényi and János Bródy composed a rock opera—István, a király ("Stephen, the King")—about the early years of his reign. Seventeen years later, in 2000, Szörényi composed a sequel called Veled, Uram! ("You, Sir").|$|E

[...] In short it is [...] "a modernist narrative [...] around a modernist event." [...] Reviewers highlighted {{the way in which}} Lord depicted the human side of the Titanic story, which The New York Times called [...] "the core of Mr. Lord's account, and explains its fascination, a pull as powerful in its way as the last downward plunge of the ship itself."

[...] The documentary was highlighted in The Sydney Morning Herald among [...] "The week's best", and critic Greg Hassall characterised it as, [...] "Disturbing, perplexing and very entertaining." [...] The Australia newspaper MX highlighted the documentary favorably, in its column, [...] "Best in show". Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun selected The Most Hated Family in America as his [...] "Top Choice" [...] recommendation. Adams wrote, [...] "A truly disturbing, disgusting and sad documentary. The repellent Shirley Phelps is the outspoken nutbag who got publicity by calling Heath Ledger a 'fag enabler' after his death. This jaw-dropping doco infiltrates Phelps' only-in-America church where her 11 spooky kids regularly picket funerals of US soldiers killed in Iraq – they believe God killed them to show his hatred of how 'depraved' America now is." ...|$|E
