There are stalls of new, various-shaped bread, brown and bright: there are tiny stalls of marvellous native cakes, which I want to taste, {{there is a great}} deal of meat and kid: and there are stalls of cheese, all cheeses, all shapes, all whitenesses, all the cream-colours, on into {{daffodil}} yellow. Goat cheese, <b>sheeps</b> cheese, Swiss cheese, Parmegiano, stracchino, caciocavallo, torolone, how many cheeses I don't know the names of! But they cost about the same as in Sicily, eighteen francs, twenty francs, twenty-five francs the kilo. And there is lovely ham--thirty and thirty-five francs the kilo. There is a little fresh butter too--thirty or thirty-two francs the kilo. Most of the butter, however, is tinned in Milan. It costs the same as the fresh. There are splendid piles of salted black olives, and huge bowls of green salted olives. There are chickens and ducks and wild-fowl: at eleven and twelve and fourteen francs a kilo. There is mortadella, the enormous Bologna sausage, thick as a church pillar: 16 francs: and there are various sorts of smaller sausage, salami, to be eaten in slices. A wonderful abundance of food, glowing and shining. We are rather late for fish, especially on Friday. But a barefooted man offers us two weird objects from the Mediterranean, which teems with marine monsters.|$|E

A total of 18 microsatellite loci have been used for genotyping Indonesian <b>sheep.</b> Total <b>sheep</b> blood 200 samples were extracted from garut <b>sheep</b> of fighting and meat types, purbalingga <b>sheep,</b> batur <b>sheep</b> and jember <b>sheep</b> populations by using a salting out method. Microsatellite loci data were analyzed using POPGENE 3. 2 software. Based on this study obtained 180 alleles from 17 microsatellite loci, while average number of alleles was 6. 10 alleles (6 to 18 alleles) from five Indonesian <b>sheep</b> populations (garut <b>sheep</b> of fighting type, garut <b>sheep</b> of meat type, purbalingga <b>sheep,</b> batur <b>sheep</b> and jember <b>sheep</b> population). The average of observed heterozygosity (Ho) and expected heterozygosity (He) values were 0. 5749 and 0. 6896, respectively, while the genetic differentiation for inbreeding among population (FIS), within population (FIT) and average genetic differentiation (FST) were 0. 1006, 0. 1647 and 0. 0712, respectively. Genetic distance and genetic tree showed that Indonesian <b>sheep</b> population was distinct from garut <b>sheep</b> of fighting and meat types, purbalingga <b>sheep,</b> batur <b>sheep</b> and jember <b>sheep</b> population.

But, first, I must premise a short description of this Specimen, which I have added of this Tribe, in the first Figure of the XII. Scheme, which is nothing else but the appearance of a small white spot of hairy mould, multitudes of which I found to bespeck & whiten over the red covers of a small book, which, it seems, were of <b>Sheeps</b> skin, that being more apt to gather mould, even in a dry and clean room, then other leathers. These spots appear'd, through a good Microscope, to be a very pretty shap'd Vegetative body, which, from almost the same part of the Leather, shot out multitudes of small long cylindrical and transparent stalks, not exactly streight, but a little bended with the weight of a round and white knob that grew on the top of each of them; many of these knobs I observ'd to be very round, and of a smooth surface, such as A, A, &c. others smooth likewise, but a little oblong, as B; several of them a little broken, or cloven with chops at the top, as C; others flitter'd as 'twere, or flown all to pieces, as D, D. The whole substance of these pretty bodies was of a very tender constitution, much like the substance of the softer kind of common white Mushroms, for by touching them with a Pin, I found them to be brused and torn; they seem'd each of them to have a distinct root of their own; for though they grew neer together in a cluster, yet I could perceive each stem to rise out of a distinct part or pore of the Leather; some of these were small and short, as seeming to have been but newly sprung up, of these the balls were for the most part round, others were bigger, and taller, as being perhaps of a longer growth, and of these, for the most part, the heads were broken, and some much wasted, as E; what these heads contain'd I could not perceive; whether they were knobs and flowers, or seed cases, I am not able to say, but they seem'd most likely to be of the same nature with those that grow on Mushroms, which they did, some of them, not a little resemble.|$|E

enough that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying 5/- in the preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and Simon Dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when I sang Maritana with him at Freddy Mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious voice Phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart sweetheart he always sang it not like Bartell Darcy sweet tart goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath O Maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to May Goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now I wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a university professor of Italian and Im to take lessons what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me I ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still I look young in it I wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and me too after all why not I saw him driving down to the Kingsbridge station with his father and mother I was in mourning thats 11 years ago now yes hed be 11 though what was the good in going into mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for me I heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted hed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord Fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw him at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by God yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when I laid out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before I thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned the other way what was the 7th card after that the 10 of spades for a

didnt I dream something too yes there was something about poetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red Indian what do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry when I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not an ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I wonder is he too young hes about wait 88 I was married 88 Milly is 15 yesterday 89 what age was he then at Dillons 5 or 6 about 88 I suppose hes 20 or more Im not too old for him if hes 23 or 24 I hope hes not that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and talking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not a professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John Jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts ad and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like to meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathingplace from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought I could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you I often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face I would too in 1/2 a minute even if some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men I suppose never dream of washing it from I years end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches Im sure itll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age Ill throw them the 1st thing in the morning till I see if the wishcard comes out or Ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out Ill read and study all I can find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and I can teach him the other part Ill make him feel all over him till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our 2

Four groups of <b>sheep</b> consist of Indonesian Thin Tail (ITT) <b>sheep,</b> Merino <b>sheep,</b> backcross <b>sheep</b> (10 families) and F 2 <b>sheep</b> were infected with 300 metacercariae of Fasciola gigantica. The total <b>sheep</b> used in this trial is 621. Those <b>sheep</b> were observed for 12 weeks and the blood samples were collected every 2 weeks after infection. The results showed that total eosinophil counts in all infected <b>sheep</b> increased after two weeks post infection and ITT <b>sheep</b> showed the highest counts. On the other hand, the mean fluke counts on ITT <b>sheep</b> is the lowest compared with the other groups of <b>sheep.</b> Merino and F 2 <b>sheep</b> had the highest mean fluke counts. Three families of backcross <b>sheep</b> had the mean flukes count similar to ITT <b>sheep</b> and the other 7 families were similar to the Merino <b>sheep.</b> In conclusion, the highest total eosinophil count at the early stage of infection on ITT <b>sheep</b> might be related with the genetic resistance, which was showed by the lowest flukes count, and the resistance was inherited to some of the backcross <b>sheep,</b> which had similar flukes count with ITT <b>sheep.</b> ...|$|R

Fleeced <b>sheep</b> maintained higher Tcore and Trumen than shorn <b>sheep</b> in all environmental conditions tested (from thermoneutral up to 33 °C and 55 % relative humidity). Shearing of the fleeced <b>sheep</b> resulted in those <b>sheep</b> having a lower Tcore when exposed to hot conditions, compared to the previously shorn <b>sheep.</b> Respiratory rates of fleeced <b>sheep</b> followed similar patterns and were higher than shorn <b>sheep</b> under all environmental conditions. After the fleeced <b>sheep</b> were shorn, their respiratory rates decreased to rates similar to the previously shorn <b>sheep</b> when under heat load, suggesting heat loss other than respiratory evaporative heat loss was augmented...|$|R

50|$|Despite {{the strong}} adaptations that the Zulu <b>sheep</b> have, {{compared}} to other <b>sheep,</b> many farmers in KwaZulu-Natal adopted the idea of breeding Zulu <b>sheep</b> with other exotic and foreign <b>sheep.</b> Their main goal by cross breeding was to strengthen the various genes of the other <b>sheep</b> with the preferable adaptability traits and better tasting meat of the Zulu <b>sheep.</b> Unfortunately, farmers have started realizing that they still want to have purebred groups of Zulu <b>sheep,</b> but the population has decreased significantly. The extinction threat in purebred Zulu <b>sheep</b> {{is a result of}} the cross breeding of Zulu <b>sheep</b> with other <b>sheep</b> breeds. Some farmers have tried to make efforts to preserve the purebred Zulu <b>sheep</b> by inbreeding the Zulu <b>sheep</b> that they own. A side effect of inbreeding is that the genes of the species start to become damaged. Also, health issues arise such as weaker immune systems and shorter life spans can occur.|$|R

Han is an ILRI authorTo {{determine}} the genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships among Chinese <b>sheep,</b> 10 indigenous breeds and one introduced breed were genotyped for 19 microsatellite loci. The {{mean number of}} alleles per breed ranged from 5. 44 (Guide Black Fur <b>sheep)</b> to 9. 13 (Ujumqin <b>sheep</b> and Hulunbeier <b>sheep),</b> the expected heterozygosity varied from 0. 623 (Guide Black Fur <b>sheep)</b> to 0. 737 (Zhaotong <b>sheep),</b> and the allelic richness ranged from 5. 169 (Guide Black Fur <b>sheep)</b> to 7. 610 (Zhaotong <b>sheep).</b> The deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was statistically significant (P < 0. 05) at three loci (SRCRSP 5, OarAE 129 and DYMS 1) {{in most of the}} breeds. Chinese <b>sheep</b> breeds had maintained a high level of within-population genetic differentiation (95. 23 %), with the remainder explained by differentiation among populations (4. 77 %). The genetic differentiation pattern and genetic relationships among Chinese <b>sheep</b> breeds displayed a high consistency with the traditional classification. Both the Bayesian cluster and principal component analyses showed a reliable clustering pattern, which revealed three major clusters in Chinese indigenous <b>sheep</b> (Mongolian <b>sheep,</b> Kazakh <b>sheep</b> and Tibetan <b>sheep),</b> except Zhaotong and Guide Black Fur <b>sheep.</b> There were probably caused by different breeding history, geography isolation and different levels of inbreeding.
