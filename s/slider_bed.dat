The Bagasse produced in the mills {{is used as a}} fuel to boilers and the generation of steam. The steam thus produced is expanded in turbines and the power is generated. The excess bagasse is then stored in an open area. Lot of human health hazards is taking place due to loading of bagasse. Nowadays, the industries are using the crane systems to load the bagasse into the tippers, which is a very slow task and causing more dust. The bucket conveyors are used to move bulk materials in a vertical or inclined path. Buckets are attached to a cable, chain, or belt. Buckets are automatically unloaded {{at the end of the}} conveyor run. The belt conveyor is used for transporting light- and medium-weight loads between operations, departments, levels, and buildings, providing considerable control over the orientation and placement of the load. The belt is roller or <b>slider</b> <b>bed</b> supported; the <b>slider</b> <b>bed</b> is used for small and irregularly shaped items...|$|E

Chain-slat conveyors predominate, but are expensive and their mechanical components are constantly subjected to the abrasive action of bagasse and sand and are therefore costly to maintain. Slat conveyors also {{have a tendency to}} choke. Trapped foreign materials often cause the slats to break and the chains to stretch non-uniformly, resulting in conveyor breakdown. Consequently, chain-slat conveyor systems often contribute to poor plant availability. Previous belt and plough installations, on the other hand, have experienced operational problems, which has limited their use as an alternative to slat-chain systems. The performance and merits of the ‘Smart-feed™ ’ system, installed at the Hippo Valley Estate Sugar Mill (HVE) in Zimbabwe are evaluated. This installation has successfully demonstrated that the problems experienced with previous designs are eliminated by the “Smart-feed™ ” system, which uniquely integrates ‘Renton Ploughs’, innovative conveyor and chute designs and state-ofthe-art automation and control. Now entering its third season of operation, the HVE ‘Smart-feed™ ’ installation, which includes a 2. 1 m wide and 80 m long <b>slider</b> <b>bed</b> conveyor feeding six adjacent boilers via 23 ploughs, has achieved the anticipated savings in capital and operating costs and has resulted in improved availability and reliability. Improved boiler control has also resulted from the ability to control the fuel flow to individual feeders...|$|E
