Gibberellic acid (GA) and Benzylaminopurine (BA) or their combinations cause dormancy breakage though little information is available on their combined application to dormancy termination. The effects of foliar application of GA and BA on potato tuber sprouting and subsequent yield were studied. Three potato varieties with different tuber dormancy period; ‘Asante ’ (short dormancy), Dutch Robyjn (medium dormancy) and ‘Kenya Sifa ’ (long dormancy) were planted at National Potato Research Centre, Tigoni and sprayed with a factorial combinations of 0, 50, 100, 300 ppm GA and 0, 50, 75, 100 ppm BA separately and combined {{at the rate of}} 1000 lts/ha spray volume towards the end of maturation.

40|$|Nutritional and {{perceived}} health benefits {{have contributed to}} the increasing popularity of raw <b>sprouted</b> <b>seed</b> products. In the past two decades, sprouted seeds have been a recurring food safety concern, with at least 55 documented foodborne outbreaks affecting more than 15, 000 people. A compilation of selected publications was used to yield an analysis of the evolving safety and risk communication related to raw sprouts, including microbiological safety, efforts to improve production practices, and effectiveness of communication prior to, during, and after sprout-related outbreaks. Scientific investigation and media coverage of sprout-related outbreaks has led to improved production guidelines and public health enforcement actions, yet continued outbreaks call into question the effectiveness of risk management strategies and producer compliance. Raw sprouts remain a high-risk product and avoidance or thorough cooking are the only ways that consumers can reduce risk; even thorough cooking messages fail to acknowledge the risk of cross-contamination. Risk communication messages have been inconsistent over time with Canadian and U. S. governments finally aligning their messages in the past five years, telling consumers to avoid sprouts. Yet consumer and industry awareness of risk remains low. To minimize health risks linked to the consumption of sprout products, local and national public health agencies, restaurants, retailers and producers need validated, consistent and repeated risk messaging through a variety of sources...|$|E
40|$|Unpredictable {{flooding}} {{is a major}} constraint to rice production. It {{can occur}} at any growth stage. The effect of simulated flooding post-anthesis on yield and subsequent seed quality of pot-grown rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants was investigated in glasshouses and controlled-environment growth cabinets. Submergence post-anthesis (9 - 40 DAA) for 3 or 5 days reduced seed weight of japonica rice cv. Gleva, with considerable pre-harvest sprouting (up to 53 %). The latter was greater the later in seed development and maturation that flooding occurred. <b>Sprouted</b> <b>seed</b> had poor ability to survive desiccation or germinate normally upon rehydration, whereas the effects of flooding on the subsequent air-dry seed storage longevity (p 50) of the non-sprouted seed fraction was negligible. The indica rice cvs IR 64 and IR 64 Sub 1 (introgression of submergence tolerance gene Submergence 1 A- 1) were both far more tolerant to flooding post-anthesis than cv. Gleva: four days’ submergence of these two near-isogenic cultivars at 10 - 40 DAA resulted less than 1 % sprouted seeds. The presence of the Sub 1 A- 1 allele in cv. IR 64 Sub 1 was verified by gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing. It had no harmful effect on loss in seed viability during storage compared with IR 64 in both control and flooded environments. Moreover, the germinability and changes in dormancy during seed development and maturation were very similar to IR 64. The efficiency of using chemical spray to increase seed dormancy was investigated in the pre-harvest sprouting susceptible rice cv. Gleva. Foliar application of molybdenum at 100 mg L- 1 reduced sprouted seeds by 15 - 21 % following 4 days’ submergence at 20 - 30 DAA. Analyses confirmed that the treatment did result in molybdenum uptake by the plants, and also tended to increase seed abscisic acid concentration. The latter was reduced by submergence and declined exponentially during grain ripening. The selection of submergence-tolerant varieties was more successful than application of molybdenum in reducing pre-harvest sprouting...|$|E

40|$|All {{varieties}} of bean sprouts (mung bean, alfalfa, broccoli, and radish) {{are classified as}} a “super-food” and are common staples for health conscious consumers. Along with the proposed health benefits, {{there is also an}} inherent risk of foodborne illness. When sprouts are cooked, there is little risk of illness. The purpose of this dissertation was to explore novel techniques to minimize or prevent the incidence of foodborne illness associated with the consumption of sprouts. Three areas were investigated: 1) the use of a biocontrol organism, 2) the use of a novel spontaneous carvacrol nanoemulsion, and 3) the influence of the sprouting environment, antimicrobial treatments, and the presence of pathogens on the microbiota of sprouts. Using a novel strain of Serratia plymuthica, the growth of Salmonella spp. or E. coli O 157 :H 7 were either suppressed or inhibited on sprouts that were co-inoculated with S. plymuthica and either pathogen. A novel carvacrol nanoemulsion was developed and tested for its efficacy against contaminated <b>sprouting</b> <b>seeds</b> and storage stability. The initial formulation was able to inactive low levels (≤ 3 log CFU/g) of S. Enteritidis or E. coli O 157 :H 7 on mung beans, alfalfa, and radish <b>sprouting</b> <b>seeds,</b> but not broccoli. It was found that pH and high levels (≥ 10 % v/v) of organic load significantly influenced the antimicrobial properties of the emulsion. With the addition of 50 mM acetic or levulinic acid, the treatment was able to inactivate 4 log CFU/g and 2 log CFU/g of pathogens on mung beans or broccoli seeds, respectively. The emulsion was found to be stable and still effective up to 30 days of storage at room temperature. Microbial population studies, utilizing a terminal restricted fragment length polymorphism analysis, showed that the microbiota differed between <b>sprouting</b> <b>seed</b> varieties. During the course of aseptic germination, there was a population shift which resulted in a less diverse population, mainly compose of Pseudomonadaceae. Sprouts that were commercially germinated had a more diverse population than aseptically germinated <b>sprouts</b> when <b>seeds</b> from the same distributer were used, suggesting that the sprouting environment can influence the final microbiota. The presence of pathogens resulted in a microbiota predominantly composed of Pseudomonadaceae and Enterobacteriaceae. <b>Sprouting</b> <b>seeds</b> that were treated with the carvacrol nanoemulsion resulted in a population comprised of mostly Pseudomonadaceae. Seeds that were initially contaminated with S. Enteritidis and treated with the carvacrol nanoemulsion had no detectable Salmonella restricted fragments or viable cells, suggesting complete inactivation of the pathogen. Sprouts will continue to a food for health conscious consumers. They will also be scrutinized for their chronic correlation with foodborne pathogens such as Salmonella spp. and E. coli O 157 :H 7. It is vital that research continues in the areas of prevention, disinfection, and detection of pathogens on produce...|$|R
