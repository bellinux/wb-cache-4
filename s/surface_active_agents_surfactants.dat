40|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>agents</b> (<b>surfactants)</b> {{are widely}} used to control the {{interfacial}} properties of the gas-liquid and liquid- 1 interfaces in the froth flotation separation process. The dynamic adsorption of the surfactants is critical to flotation which is a kinetics-con trolled process. This paper examines the dynamic adsorption of sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate and Dowfroth 250, which is a commercial mixture of polyglycols used to control the dispersion of air in flotation. The dynamic adsorption process was modelled based on either the diffusion-controlled or kinetics-controlled theories. The numerical computation was applied to solve the non-linear governing equations. The dynamic adsorption of the surfactants was {{measured in terms of}} the dynamic surface tension using the pendant drop method. Comparison between the theoretical results and experimental data shows that the kinetics-controlled model for the surfactant adsorption describes the experimental data better for both surfactant systems. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

30|$|However, the {{production}} conditions of oil show dual nature of impact of watercut on formation of asphaltene-resin-paraffin deposits in well. On the one hand, increase in watercut of mixture increases total heat capacity of upstream, which promotes to raise temperature at the wellhead. This reduces temperature gradients between the bottomhole and wellhead and decreases kinetics of wax precipitation. At the higher watercut (up to 60  % by weight), water performs as the external phase separating oil from surface of tubing and changes the steel surface from oil wet to water wet. In that case, solid asphaltene-resin-paraffin particles being formed in volume do not deposit onto {{surface of the}} downhole equipment. This {{is the case for}} the oil-in-water emulsion only. On the other hand, in case of formation of water-in-oil emulsions, the inhibiting tubes of water droplets presented by natural <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>agents</b> (<b>surfactants),</b> strengthened with three-dimensional structure of wax adhere to the wellbore surface in accordance with its larger free surface and high adhesion factors forming organic deposits that are hard to remediate.|$|E

This can affect the environment especially aquatic environment. Anionic surfactants are the most widely used. Therefore, it is necessary to remove such substances from the environment Adsorption is one of the important and widely used method for removal of substances from aquatic media. In this research, MCM- 41 and its modification were used to adsorb anionic surfactant, sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate. NMR method was used to study the interaction between the surfactant and the adsorbent. MCM- 41 was synthesized hydrothermally at 100 oC and its modification was conducted by silylation of MCM- 41 with trimethylchloro silane (MCM 41 -TMCS) and t-butyldimethylchloro silane, TBDMCS (MCM 41 -TBDMCS). Modified samples had higher capacity to adsorb the surfactant than unmodified MCM- 41. The interaction of the surfactant and MCM 41 -TMCS is due to a hydrophobic interaction between SDBS and the trimethylsilyl group of MCM 41 -TMCS and the t-butyldimethylchloro group of MCM 41 -TBDMCS. It is likely that the alkyl chain tail interacts with the alkylsilyl groups rather than the aromatic head groups...|$|E

Linear Alkyl Benzene Sulfonate (LAS) {{is one of the}} synthetic surfactants that is widely used. Although LAS is biodegradable, its introduction to the environment in big amounts harms water bodies. Research on biodegradation of LAS with 100 ppm, 400 ppm, 700 ppm, 1000 ppm and 1500 ppm concentrations was conducted by using consortium of bacteria comprising of Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus aglomerans, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus alvae.

Electrosynthesis of MnO 2 in the absence or presence of surfactant was carried out from acidic MnSO 4 solution obtained from manganese cake under optimized conditions. A range of characterization techniques, including field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Rutherford back scattering (RBS), and BET surface area/porosity studies, was carried out to determine the structural and chemical characteristics of the EMD.

Rheological behavior of polymer flooding and surfactant was studied. Employing this formulation, the maximum micro emulsion of oil in water occurred.

Rosin, Alkyl Ketene Dimer (AKD) and Alkenyl Succinic Anhydride (ASA) internal sizing agents exist for this purpose. ASA {{is added to the}} papermaking process {{in the form of an}} emulsion. The dispersion of ASA oil, water, and a stabilizing agent (stabilizer) are mixed under shear forces to create the emulsion. In this master’s thesis, different emulsions, emulsification techniques and stabilizers in the process industry were studied. Emulsions in food, medical, petroleum and papermaking processes had potential stabilizers to be used for hydrophobation of paper and board with ASA. The comparison between rosin, AKD and ASA internal sizing agents was also done. The goal was to find optimal emulsification methods and emulsion stabilizers for ASA emulsification.

A somewhat exotic, but nevertheless readily available family of carbohydrates allowing a fascinating chemistry are inositols (cyclohexane- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -hexols). myo-Inositol which is the stereoisomer with one axial hydroxyl group, is commercially available at reasonable prices. Inositols have been used previously as hydrophilic head group in amphiphilic liquid crystals, and recently our group involved myo-inositol in syntheses of <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>agents</b> (<b>surfactants).</b> It seems that one unit of myo-inositol {{is not enough to}} assure a good aqueous solubility for these compounds.

Xuan et al. (2013) studied the effect of surfactants on the heat transfer nature of nanofluids. They used Cu-water nanofluids with three volume fractions and two mass fractions of sodium dodecyl benzoic sulphate (SDBS). They showed that the surfactant remarkably affects transport properties and the convective heat transfer performance of nanofluids and suppresses heat transfer enhancement effect of suspended nanoparticles.

After use, wastes containing surfactants or their degradation products are discharged to wastewater treatment plants or directly into surface waters. Due to their specific properties of SAAs, compounds are able to migrate between different environmental compartments such as soil, sediment, water or even living organisms and accumulate there. Surfactants can have a harmful effect on living organisms. They can connect with bioactive molecules and modify their function. Additionally, {{they have the ability}} to migrate into cells and cause their damage or death. For these reasons investigation of individual surfactants should be conducted. The presented research has been undertaken to obtain information about SAA contamination of sediment from the River Kłodnica catchment caused by selected anionic (linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS C 10 -C 13)) and cationic (alkylbenzyldimethylammonium (BDMA-C 12 - 16), alkyl trimethyl ammonium (DTMA), hexadecyl piridinium chloride (HP) chlorides) surfactants.

40|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>agents</b> (<b>surfactants)</b> {{reduce the}} surface tension of fluid {{interfaces}} and, via surface tension gradients, {{can lead to}} tangential forces resulting in the Marangoni effect. Biological systems {{take advantage of their}} impact on fluids with interfaces, but surfactants are also important for industrial applications such as processes of emulsification or mixing. Surfactants can be soluble in {{at least one of the}} fluid phases and the exchange of surfactants between the bulk phases and the fluid interfaces is governed by the process of adsorption and desorption. One can compute the interfacial surfactant density from the bulk surfactant density by assuming that the interface is in equilibrium with the adjacent bulk phase and imposing a closure relation (known as adsorption isotherm) between the two quantities. The assumption (known as instantaneous adsorption) is valid when the process of adsorption to the interface is fast compared to the kinetics in the bulk phases. However, it is not valid in the context of ionic surfactant systems, or when the diffusion is not limited to a thin layer. In this thesis, we derive two types of mathematical models for two-phase flow with a soluble surfactant that can account for both instantaneous and non-instantaneous adsorption. The first type is a sharp interface model, in which the interface is modelled by moving hypersurfaces. While the second type is a phase field model, in which the interface is a region of small, nonzero thickness where there is some microscopic mixing of the two fluids. Both types of models are shown to satisfy energy inequalities which guarantee thermodynamical consistency. Via a formal asymptotic analysis, we show the phase field models are related to sharp interface models in the limit that the interfacial width tends to zero. Flexibility with respect to the choice of bulk and surface free energies allows us to realise various isotherms and relations of state between surface tension and surfactant. We present some numerical simulations to support the asymptotic analysis and display the effectiveness of the our approach. As a first step towards an analysis of our models, we consider sharp interface and phase field models for soluble surfactants in a static situation. The surfactant equations become a linear elliptic coupled bulk-surface partial differential equation, and our main result is the rigorous convergence of the weak solution of the phase field models to the weak solution of the sharp interface models...|$|E

Such not only increases the time of liquid transportation, but contributes to massive energy dissipation. As a result, efforts are being made to contain these anomalies but a consensus has not been reached. Thus, the initiation of this current research. This work introduces an economically feasible technique for enhancing the drag reduction and mechanical degradation of known polymeric additives through the formation of certain complexes with polar <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>agents</b> (<b>surfactants).</b> Such was achieved by using two polymeric additives: Polyacrylamide and Sodium Carboxyl Methyl Cellulose, two surfactants: Sodium Dodecyl-Benzene Sulfonate (SDS) and Triton X- 45 and Nano particles of Fumed silica to form complexes. Three phases were involved in the experiment-the use of Rotating Disk Apparatus (RDA) to examine drag reduction, mechanical resistance and stability of the additives, the Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) to examine the morphology of the complexes, the drag reduction and shear stability of the investigated solutions using a closed loop pipeline system. Overall, the results obtained from all the stages of the experiment showed that drag reduction increased as the concentration increased. The highest drag reduction for polymer was 48 % at 2000 ppm while the complex of Polyacrylamide and Sodium dodecyl-benzene sulfonate gave 54 % which made complexes better. This showed optimum performance against their 33 % and 35 % respective individual DR. Adding fume silica to this mixture inhibits their degradation and yielded %DR of (47, 48, 51, 54, 58), (45, 48, 54, 55, 57) and (56, 57, 61, 63, 68) for polymer-surfactant-fumed-silica powder at (500, 1000, 1500, 1700, 2000) PPM concentration respectively. However, the pipe results obtained for 2000 ppm was 7826. 618. Results for (PAM-Triton X- 45 -fumed silica) complex was 85. 8 % drag reduction and for fumed silica-Triton X- 45 complex (fumed silica-PAM), it was 79. 2 % and 76. 7 % respectively. Other results such as fumed silica alone, surfactant solution and polymer at 2000 ppm showed 63. 2 %, 62. 6 % and 59. 5 % drag reduction respectively. Overall, about 85. 8 % DR was achieved in the study, which is the power saving possible in transporting the fluid through pipelines. A mathematical expression was developed to delineate the real mechanism of DR. As a conclusion, new, greener DRAs were successfully introduced and their effectiveness in improving the flow was proven experimentally.

40|$|This project uses {{experimental}} {{techniques to}} explore the effects of <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>agent</b> (<b>surfactant)</b> adsorption on a droplet of oil suspended in a flow. The fluorescent surfactant Rhodamine- 6 G was used to enable the use of optical techniques to visualise the build-up of surfactant {{at the rear of}} the droplet and its effects on the internal circulation within the droplet. This was done to enable an exploration of how surfactant accumulates behind a droplet with the aim of predicting the behaviour based on the internal circulation for non- fluorescentt surfactants. An experiment was designed along with calibration procedures in order to utilise the non-intrusive measurement techniques laser-induced fluorescence and particle image velocimetry to measure the volume of surfactant held behind the droplet, the angle of the visible cap caused by the build-up of Rhodamine- 6 G, and the cap angle of the stagnant region obtained by measuring the velocity of the circulation within the droplet. Laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) was used to visualise the development of a surfactant-rich cap that formed {{at the rear of the}} oil droplet as it rose through an aqueous solution, with different bulk concentrations of surfactant. The aqueous solution soluble surfactant, adsorbed to the forwards facing part of the droplet, was transported around to the rear where it accumulated in a surfactant cap before being swept back into the ow behind the droplet. The fluorescent properties of Rhodamine- 6 G were utilised to measure the size of the visible surfactant cap angle and the volume of surfactant stored within the cap. The results showed that increased concentrations of surfactant caused a larger volume of surfactant to be held behind the droplet with larger droplets resulting in smaller surfactant cap angles. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) was used {{to explore the}} effects of surfactant at the interface on the internal circulation within the droplet. As surfactant accumulated an area of very low velocity at the rear of the droplet appeared. This was quantified by measuring the tangential velocity around the droplet with the area of low velocity signifying the presence of a stagnant cap. Measuring the internal velocity around the droplet close to the interface showed that the stagnant cap angle had large growth over the initial region of the tank, with larger droplets resulting in smaller surfactant cap angles. The visible cap angle measured by LIF was related to the stagnant cap angle measured by PIV to compare how the results for each technique developed over the height of the tank. The angles for both techniques exhibited the same trends as the droplet height increased, although they showed different magnitudes revealing that the experimental procedure could be improved in the future to obtain better agreement. ...|$|R
40|$|While the {{structure}} and dynamics of boundary layers on rigid no-slip walls in rotation dominated enclosed flows are still an area of active research, the interactions between rotating or swirling flows with a free surface have received comparatively less attention. For the most part, investigations in this area have been focused on clean free surfaces, which may be treated as stress-free. However, in most practical situations the surface is rarely clean, and even under laboratory conditions, it is quite difficult to achieve a clean free surface. Most impurities in liquids are <b>surface</b> <b>active,</b> and hence the name <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>agent</b> or <b>surfactant.</b> These surfactants tend to establish an equilibrium surface concentration which alters the interfacial tension and interfacial viscoelastic properties of the gas/liquid interface. The coupling between the bulk swirling flow and the interface is provided via the tangential stress balances, and these stresses on the interface are dependent upon the surface concentration of surfactant, {{which in turn is}} altered by the interfacial flow. Forces acting on the interface include surface tension gradients (elastic) and the viscous resistance to shear and dilatation. These viscoelastic properties vary with the surfactant concentration on the surface. Here, we present numerical studies of flow in a cylinder driven by the con. itant rotation of the bottom endwall with the top free surface being contaminated by a Newtonian surfactant. Comparisons with a clean free surface and a noslip stationary top endwall provide added insight into the altered dynamics that result from the presence of a small amount of surfactant. ...|$|R

To enhance its penetration into inaccessible areas of root canals and to improve its overall effect, the addition of surface-active agents has been suggested. The aim {{of this investigation was}} to review the effect of the reduction of the surface tension on the performance of NaOCl in endodontics. A search was performed in the Medline electronic database (articles published up to 28 July 2012, in English) with the search terms and combinations as follows: ‘sodium hypochlorite AND surface tension or interfacial force or interfacial tension or surface-active agent or amphiphilic <b>agent</b> or <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>agent</b> or <b>surfactant</b> or tenside or detergent'.

The search identified 302 publications, of which 11 fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the review. The evidence available suggests that surface-active agents improve the penetration of NaOCl in the main canal and have no effect on its pulp tissue dissolution ability.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{numerical}} simulations of two-phase flows with complex interfaces are presented. Three classes of complex interfaces are considered, namely flows with Marangoni effects, flows with viscous interfaces and flows with insoluble <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>agents</b> (<b>surfactants).</b> We restrict to immiscible incompressible two-phase flow systems. A sharp interface model, {{which consists of}} two-phase Navier-Stokes equations and interfacial conditions, is {{used to describe the}} flow. At the fluid-fluid interface the surface stress tensor is defined, which models surface forces. Three types of surface stress tensors are considered, namely the constant surface tension force, the variable surface tension force and the viscous interface according to the Boussinesq-Scriven law. The surfactant transport is modeled by a convection-diffusion equation on the interface. Constitutive relations, e. g. the linear relation or the Langmuir model, relate the surfactant concentration to the surface tension coefficient. The DROPS package, which is developed at the Chair for Numerical Mathematics at RWTH Aachen University, is used to perform numerical simulations of three dimensional two-phase flow problems. The package provides a framework for such problems, and includes a level set method for capturing the unknown interface, a pair of P 2 -XFEM finite elements for discretizing the two-phase Navier-Stokes equations, a trace finite element method for the surfactant transport equation, a Gauss-Seidel type decoupling scheme for handling the coupled systems, fast iterative solvers etc. The main contributions of this thesis are the following. Numerical methods are developed to treat two-phase flows with complex interfaces. These methods can be categorized into two groups: the numerical treatment of surface stress tensors and the numerical treatment of the nonlinear coupling between fluid dynamics and interface dynamics. By introducing the surface stress tensor and applying the partial integration of the surface force functional, different classes of complex interfaces can be treated with a unified approach. The direct calculation of the mean curvature of the interface, which involves second derivatives, is avoided. Instead we concentrate on the discretization of the projection operator at the interface. The viscous surface force terms, which depend on the velocity unknowns, are discretized and treated implicitly in the momentum equation. The two-phase Navier-Stokes equations and the surfactant equation, coupled through the surface tension coefficient, are solved with a Gauss-Seidel type decoupling scheme. The aforementioned numerical methods are implemented in the DROPS package. A systematic methodology is applied to validate the numerical solver for the three classes of flows with complex interfaces. We construct benchmark problems, in which theoretical predictions exist and can be considered valid, and perform numerical experiments of these model problems. Numerical results are compared with theoretical predictions. Very good agreements have been achieved. We also discuss certain properties of the numerical methods, e. g. the convergence rate of the decoupling schemes and the linear algebra aspects of the trace finite element method etc. At last, a more complex problem, namely the breakup of droplet in a simple shear flow, is numerically investigated. Theoretical analysis is not known for this problem. We compare numerical results with a recent numerical simulation study...|$|E
40|$|Wetting is {{the ability}} of liquids to {{maintain}} contact with solids or other liquids. It is a commonly observed phenomenon in numerous natural and technological processes. Efficient wetting of liquids is crucial to painting, coating, printing, and drug delivery applications. <b>Surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>agents</b> (<b>surfactants)</b> are amphiphilic compounds which can lower the surface tension of liquid solvents. Adding surfactants to liquids is one common method to enhance wetting. Since the 1960 s organomodified trisiloxane surfactants have been recognized as effective wetting agents for aqueous pesticide formulations because they fasten foliar uptake and wet larger leaf surface areas. Trisiloxane surfactants that possess the ability to promote rapid and extensive spreading of water on hydrophobic solids are known as superspreaders, and their wetting phenomenon is referred to as superspreading. Numerous studies have been performed to reveal the peculiar properties of superspreaders and the underlying mechanisms of superspreading. The wetting area of superspreader solutions was found to increase linearly with time within the first several seconds. The highest wetting velocity was observed at a critical surfactant concentration. In the course of the years, the superspreading ability of trisiloxane surfactants was attributed to their molecular structure and to the way they aggregate in solutions. It was proposed that the driving force for superspreading is surface tension gradient over the spreading drop, which can be maintained for longer time by superspreaders than by non-superspreaders. Most of previous experiments were performed with video camera at low speeds (e. g., 500 frames per second or less). However, the investigation of early wetting with time scale of milliseconds is crucial to understand rapid adhesion phenomena. It also allows us to know when surfactants start to become effective in the wetting systems, which helps to understand the wetting mechanisms behind. The goal of this experimental thesis is to shed light on the early wetting stage of aqueous surfactant solutions on hydrophobic solids and water subphases. Different surfactants and solids are used for comparative investigations. The superspreading stage of surfactant solutions is systematically studied by changing the factors that are assumed to influence the surface tension gradient, such as surfactant concentration and relative humidity. The experiments within this thesis are performed using high-speed video imaging with temporal resolution up to 0. 02 milliseconds. The results show that the wetting processes of hydrophobic solids by surfactant-laden drops can be described by one, two, or three stages, depending on physicochemical properties of the surfactants and the solids used. Surfactants do not {{play a role in the}} early wetting stage, which is mainly dominated by inertia. After a characteristic time, inertial wetting goes over in viscous wetting. This stage has also a characteristic duration and is influenced by surfactants. Afterwards a superspreading stage is observed for superspreading drops only. The driving force in this stage is the surface tension gradient, which is influenced by the dynamic surface tension of the spreading drop. The superspreading dynamics depends strongly on the surfactant concentration, on the relative humidity, as well as on the substrate wettabilities. It is found that superspreader solutions only superspread on substrates whose wettability falls within a narrow range. Conversely, on water subphases superspreader and non-superspreader solutions behave similarly. The work in this Ph. D. project completes one gap - early wetting dynamics of surfactant solutions – in prior work. The findings reveal different wetting stages with different characteristic duration. The action times of surfactants during the wetting process have been assessed. Moreover, this study provides more evidence for the surface tension gradient as a driving force in the superspreading stage. Therefore, the findings represent a significant step forward for surfactant-enhanced wetting and superspreading. They can also offer guidance on practical applications, e. g., crop spraying. By using superspreaders under proper conditions, the wetting performance can be maximized and a cost reduction can be achieved. ...|$|E
40|$|Hydrophobic organic {{contaminants}} (HOCs) {{released from}} non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) impose a serious risk on groundwater quality. The concentrations in groundwater of these toxic, cancerogenic and mutagenic compounds are at many sites far above legal limits. The time scale of contaminant emission could be centuries or longer {{due to their}} extremely low water solubility and the diffision limited dissolution. Due to the Same reasons conventional pump and treat remediation techniques can be not successful. <b>Surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>agents</b> (<b>surfactants)</b> are considered to overcome this limitations. Surfactants assemble at the solid-water interface as monomers, monolayers and bilayers (admicelles) depending on the bulk solution surfactant concentration. Above the critical micelle concentration (CMC) they form micelles in the aqueous phase due to their amphiphilic (hydrophilic-hydrophobic) properties. HOCs have a high affinity to the hydrophobic surfactant pseudophases created by the hydrophobic, oil-like moieties of the surfactant molecules either adsorbed to the solid (monolayer, bilayer) or mobile in the aqueous phase (monomers, micelles). The increase of the apparent water solubility of HOCs due to partitioning into micelles is known as solubilization. Analogous, the partitioning into adsorbed surfactant admicelles is known as adsolubilization. Thus, the surfactants can act either to enhance or reduce HOCs sorption to aquifer material from the aqueous solution depending on the surfactant concentration. An understanding of the processes influencing the transport of surfactant and the coupled transport of surfactants and HOCs in groundwater is an essential foundation {{for the design of}} surfactant enhanced subsurface remediation (SESR) technologies. Therefore, laboratory batch and column experiments were performed using phenanthrene as a chemical probe for the HOCs, different anionic, nonionic and cationic surfactants and different natural aquifer materials. The CMC and the surface area per molecule were determined from surface tension measurements. The results show that the CMC of the surfactants in the presence of electrolytes is decreased compared to the CMC in pure water. The surfactant sorption can be described by a typical nonlinear isotherm consisting of a linear part for concentrations below the CMC and an adsorption maximum qmax above the CMC where a complete surfactant bilayer is established. Different qmax values were found for different lithocomponents of the aquifer materials examined. Generally the sandstones show the highest values, followed by Triassic limestones, Jurassic limestones and quartzes. A surfactant specific surface area AWv was calculated from qmax and compared to other specific surface areas. The external surface area Aext, assuming the aquifer grains as ideal, nonporous spheres shows no influence on Asurf i. e. the grain size does not control surfactant adsorption. The comparison son of Asurf with the cumulative surface area determined by N 2 -adsorption (BET) and Hg-intrusion indicates that surfactants can access macropores (> 50 nm) but not mesopores (2 nm - 5 O nm) and micropores (< 2 nm). A comparison of Asurf with BET indicates that in average about 2 % of the BET surface area can be 'seen' by surfactants. The surfactant column experiments indicate that the surfactant transport is close to equilibrium and can be reasonably well predicted by the adsorption isotherm. The surfactant adsorption is completely reversible. The adsolubilization kinetics are fast and can be described by a first order process. To distinguish between the contributions to phenanthrene sorption of surfactant monolayers and bilayers the partitioning of phenanthrene onto the surfactant coated aquifer material was quantified over a wide range of surfactant loading. The bilayer partitioning coefficient (Kbl) was found to be a factor of 3 larger compared to monolayer partitioning coeficient (Kbl). The respective partitioning coefficients to the surfactant pseudophases in the mobile aqueous phase (Kmic, and Kmn) are smaller. The different surfactants show different efficiencies in terms of sorbing phenanthrene from the aqueous phase. However, the coefficients (including literature data) are in a similar range. Thus, the transport behavior of phenanthrene depends strongly On the adsorption behavior of the surfactant present in the System. The retardation of phenanthrene in column experiments increases with increasing surfactant conceniration below the CMC due to the increasing surfactant loading of the aquifer material (enhanced retardation). The phenanthrene retardation decreases again with further increasing surfactant concentration until a facilitated transport can be observed for surfactant concentrations well above the CMC. The phenanthrene distribution coefficients and thus the retardation factors in the presence of surfactants can be reasonably well predicted by a mass balance model. This denotes for the different surfactant pseudophases in the mobile (micelles and monomers) and the immobile (monolayers, bilayers) phase and the respective partitioning coefficients determined in independent equilibrium batch experiments. Transport von Tensiden und gekoppelter Transport von polyzyklischen aromatischen Kohlenwasserstoffen (PAKS) und Tensiden in natürlichem Aquifermaterial - Laborexperimente Organische Flüssigkeiten, die nicht mit Wasser mischbar sind (Non-Aqueous Phase Liquids: NAPLs), wie z. B. Benzin, Hydrauliköl, Teeröl, Kreosot, chlorierte Lösemittel etc. gelangten an vielen Standorten (Tankstellen, Gaswerke, Flughäfen, Raffinerien, militärische Liegenschaften, Industrie etc.) in den Untergrund. Obwohl NAPLs als separate Flüssigphasen im Untergrund vorliegen, lösen sich aus ihnen Inhaltsstoffe, die z. T. giftig, krebserregend oder erbgutverändernd sind (z. B. Benzol oder polyzyklische aromatische Kohlenwasserstoffe), in das vorbeifließende Grundwasser und verursachen Schadstofffahnen im Abstrom. Die Konzentrationen dieser organischen Schadstoffe liegen häufig weit über den zulässigen Werten der Trinkwasserverordnung. NAPLs stellen deshalb eine große Gefahr für die Qualität des Grundwassers dar und können dieses für eine Nutzung als Trinkwasser unbrauchbar machen. Aufgrund der geringen Wasserlöslichkeit der NAPL-bürtigen Schadstoffe und der daraus resultierenden langsamen Lösung bleiben NAPLs und damit die Gefährdung Jahrzehnte bzw. Jahrhunderte bestehen. Die langsame Lösung ist auch dafür verantwortlich, daß konventionelle Sanierungsmaßnahmen, bei denen das Grundwasser zur Entfernung der Schadstoffe abgepumpt wird (pump and treat) in einem ökonomisch vertretbarem Zeitraum (50 nm), nicht aber in Meso- (2 nm - 50 nm) und Mikroporen (< 2 nm) erreichen kann. Im Mittel werden ca. 2 % der BET-Grenzfläche von den Tensiden "gesehen". Die Säulenversuche zeigten, daß der Tensidtransport nahezu unter Gleichgewichtsbedingungen stattfindet und damit aus der Gleichgewichts-Adsorptionsisotheme vorhergesagt werden kann. Die Tensidsorption ist vollständig reversibel. Der Transport von Phenanthren in Anwesenheit von Tensiden wird neben der Sorption am Aquifermaterial durch die Affinität zu den adsorbierten, immobilien Tensiden (Monolagen, Admizellen) und den Tensiden in der mobilen Wasserphase (Monomere, Mizellen) bestimmt. Diese Affinität wurde in Batchexperimenten durch Verteilungskoeffizienten quantifiziert. Der Verteilungskoefizient zu den sorbierten Tensiddoppellagen (Kbl) ist ungeflihr einen Faktor 3 größer als zu den Tensidmonolagen sidmonolagen (Kml). Die Verteilungskoefizienten zu den entsprechenden Tensidpseudophasen im mobilen Wasser (Monomere und Mizellen) sind etwas niedriger. Die verschiedenden untersuchten Tensiden sind unterschiedlich effizient, um Phenanthren zu solubilisieren bzw. adsolubilisieren. Generell liegen die Veteilungskoeffizienten (Literaturdaten eingeschlossen) jedoch in einem ähnlichen Bereich. Der Transport von Phenanthren hängt deshalb sehr stark vom Adsorptionsverhalten des Tensids im Aquifer ab. In Säulenversuchen wurde gezeigt, daß die Retardation von Phenanthren unterhalb der CMC mit steigender Tensidkonzentration und damit steigender Tensidbelegung des Aquifermaterials linear zunimmt (erhöhte Retardation). Die höchste Retardation wird im Bereich der CMC beobachtet. Eine Erhöhung der Tensidkonzentration über die CMC bewirkt die Abnahme der Retardation infolge der Erhöhung der Mizellenkonzentration in der mobilen Phase. Eine höhere Transportgeschwindigkeit von Phenanthren verglichen mit dem tensidfieien System wird erst bei Konzentrationen deutlich über der CMC erreicht. Der Transport von Phenanthren in Säulenexperimenten mit natürlichem Aquifermaterial läßt sich mit einem Massenbilanzmodell, in das die Parameter aus den Batchversuchen eingehen, hinreichend gut vorhersagen...|$|E

The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) at SRS is currently vitrifying the waste in borosilicate glass while the facilities at the Hanford site {{are in the}} design/construction phase. Both processes utilize slurry-fed joule heated melters to vitrify the waste slurries. The rheological properties of the waste slurries limit the total solids content that can be processed by the remote equipment during the pretreatment and melter feed processes. The use of a <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>agent,</b> or <b>surfactant,</b> to increase the solids loading that can be fed to the melters would increase melt rate by reducing the heat load on the melter required to evaporate the water in the feed. The waste slurries are non-Newtonian fluids with rheological properties that were modeled using the Bingham Plastic mod el (this model is typically used by SRNL when studying the DWPF process 1). The results illustrate that altering the surface chemistry of the particulates in the waste slurries can lead to a reduction in the yield stress. Dolapix CE 64 is an effective surfactant over a wide range of pH values and was effective for all simulants tested. The effectiveness of the additive increased in DWPF simulants as the concentration of the additive was increased. No maxi main effectiveness was observed.

40|$|It is {{well known}} {{to the art of}} oil {{recovery}} technique that {{only a fraction of the}} original oil in place can be recovery by primary recovery method. This method allows oil to flow to the surface by means of natural energy forces and pressure. Most of reservoirs, the recovery can slightly be improved by mean of water flooding method. This method is among the famous methods used as secondary oil recovery technique which is inexpensive and available in most of the places around the world, but this technique has its own weakness, water does not displace oil efficiently as it passes through the formation pores, because water and oil are immiscible to each other hence they create high interfacial tension between them. Thus a better method or used of chemical agents that reduce the interfacial tension between fluids is necessary to be used in order to obtain a better oil recovery. The study and use of different <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>agents</b> like <b>surfactant</b> in order to lower the surface tension between water and oil has brought new challenges to the art of oil recovery techniques, this bring us to atertiary oil recovery method, but this technique comes with more improve in oil recovery compare to both primary and secondary recovery methods. The reason behind is that, the injected of fluid that contain <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>agents</b> can penetrate and pass through rock formation much ease than the water alone, therefore making it much easier to push the oil out from its pores and up to the surface. The purpose of the project is to evaluate the efficient of the surfactant developed by SINTEF for enhanced oil recovery using glass beads and compare their results with that of recovery by brine flooding and the numerical simulated recovery. This work, reports the results of a comprehensive experimental study on oil recovery by injection of brine and surfactant at different concentration using glass beads as porousmedia. Results show that a significant amount of trapped oil due to brine flooding could be recovered by surfactant.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Özyeğin University, Graduate School of Sciences and Engineering, Department of Mechanical Engineering, January 2015. The {{aim of the}} {{microelectronics}} {{industry has}} historically been achieving increasing functionality through decreasing the device sizes while simultaneously reducing the unit manufacturing costs. This objective has been achieved by the implementation of multilevel metallization (MLM) based {{on the development of}} advanced photolithography processes and the chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) process that enabled the successful patterning through photolithography by planarization of the wafer surfaces. The projected targets of the Integrated Circuit (IC) manufacturing are facing some physical barriers with the current and forthcoming needs of the semiconductor industry to develop future metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFET). These challenges entail the introduction of new and more difficult materials to achieve better device performance such as use of Germanium due to its higher electron mobility to build faster microprocessors, as well as the use of III-V semiconductors such as GaN, GaAs or InAs which are being tested for high power device applications. Furthermore, new ideas such as reduced power consumption and ability of energy harvesting introduced ferroelectric and magnetic memories, as well as piezoelectric transducers which involve variety of materials harder to integrate to conventional semiconductor manufacturing. Chemical Mechanical Planarization process {{is one of the key}} enablers for the integration of the new materials into the current semiconductor fabrication processes. CMP functions on the principle of chemically modifying the surface to be polished while this surface is continuously abraded mechanically by the Nano-particles homogeneously suspended in the slurry environment. Development of new CMP processes require a robust slurry formulation that can provide high material removal rates (MRR) to promote high volume manufacturing throughput with low dissolution rates (DR) to achieve topographic selectivity and global planarity, in addition to creating minimum surface defectivity surface roughness values. Hence, it is important to understand the chemical and mechanical nature of the CMP process to better control the process and design future processes for the new generation materials. This dissertation focuses on the characterization of the chemically modified thin films which form during the CMP applications through the exposure of the surface to be polished to the slurry chemicals to optimize the process performance at a Nano-scale. The overall study is presented in two main sections the first part focusing on the findings on the chemically formed metal oxide thin films on metal CMP applications and the second part focusing on the chemically modified thin film characterization on the nonmetal CMP applications. On metal CMP applications, chemically modified thin films are required to be protective oxides to achieve topographic selectivity. Therefore, the chemically modified thin films of the metal (tungsten) substrates were characterized for thickness and composition as well as their protective nature by calculating their Pilling-Bethworth (P-B) ratio comparing the volume of oxide to the volume of the metal underneath. The analyses have shown a layered oxide film formation with the very top oxide film was detected to be a hydroxyl compound of the tungsten followed by W/WOx combination in the lower layers until a pure W substrate is reached. Furthermore, it has also been demonstrated that the surface topography of the tungsten wafers tend to change as a function of the oxidizer concentration. The observed changes in the surface topography were also found to affect the wettability and the total surface energy. Hence, it is obvious that the protective nature, as well as the surface nano-topography of the metal oxide thin films need to be studied to assess the metal CMP performance at a nano-scale. Changes in the surface roughness and topography with the oxidizer concentration were also studied through a mathematical modeling approach using Cahn-Hilliard Equation (CHE) approximation. CHE explains the formation of surface nano-structures in terms of reverse diffusion principal and expected to shed light to understanding the changes in the material removal rate mechanisms as a function of the CMP process variables. In the second half of the dissertation, slurry formulations are evaluated to characterize the chemically modified thin films to enhance selectivity for germanium/silica (Ge/SiO 2) CMP systems. The chemically modified thin films are mainly the hydroxyl layers formed by the dissolution of the materials such as silicon, silica or germanium in front end applications of the CMP. To evaluate the impact of chemically modified thin films of the Ge/SiO 2 system, it is necessary to modify these chemically modified films with oxidizers and <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>agents</b> (<b>surfactants)</b> since the function of the chemically modified layers in these applications is to achieve optimal removal rate selectivity. Therefore, initially selectivity analyses were conducted by wear rate responses measured at a single particle-surface interaction level through Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) with and without the use of surfactants. Both anionic (sodium dodecyl sulfate-SDS) and cationic (cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide-C 12 TAB) surfactants were evaluated at their sub-micelle and above critical micelle concentrations (CMC) as a function of pH and oxidizer concentrations. CMP performances of Ge and SiO 2 wafers were evaluated in terms of material removal rates, selectivity and surface quality. This dissertation is composed of seven chapters. The first chapter discusses the importance of nano-scale chemically modified thin films for chemical mechanical planarization process by an introduction to CMP process. Chapter 2 reviews the main components of the CMP process, its integration at the front end, middle section and back end of the line applications, as well as the importance of the characterization of the chemically modified thin films in CMP development. Chapter 3 discusses metal oxide protective thin film characterization for metal CMP applications by focusing on the growth and protective nature of the metal oxide thin films on CVD deposited tungsten wafers pre and post polishing in the presence of an oxidizer. In Chapter 4, CMP performance of the tungsten wafers are evaluated based on the material removal rate and surface quality analyses as a function of the changes in the slurry solids loading and H 2 O 2 concentration as an oxidizer. Chapter 5 focuses on germanium/silica CMP through wear rate testing as a preliminary predictive approach as well as through standard CMP MRR evaluations to define a suitable slurry formulation with sufficient selectivity and removal rate performance. Chapter 6 extends the current knowledge base on the use of surfactant systems from standard shallow trench isolation (STI) CMP to Ge- based STI CMP. CMP results are reported with slurries made of silica particles with 3 wt % solids loading and 200 - 300 nm particle size in the presence of surfactants and 0. 1 M H 2 O 2 as an oxidizer. The optimal conditions for slurry formulations are presented as a function of pH and oxidizer concentration on Ge/SiO 2 selectivity statistically through design of experiments (DOE). Finally, Chapter 7 provides a summary of the reported findings of this dissertation, and the suggested future work.

Sunulan calışma iki ana bölüme ayrılmaktadır, birinci bölüm metal CMP uygulamalarında oluşan kimyasal metal oksit ince filmlere, ikinci bölüm ise metal olmayan CMP uygulamalarında oluşan kimyasal olarak modifiye edilmiş ince filmlerin karakterizasyonuna odaklanmaktadır. Metal CMP uygulamalarında, kimyasal modifiye ince filmlerde topografik seçiciligi sağlamak için koruyucu oksit ince filmlere ihtiyaç duyulmaktadır. Bu nedenle, metal (tungsten) yüzeylerinde kimyasal modifiye ince filmlerin kalınlığı ve kompozisyonu karakterize edilmiştir, hemde yüzeyde oluşan oksit hacminin metal hacmine oranlanmasi ile Pilling-Bedworth (P-B) oranı hesaplanarak koruyucu film olup olmadıkları değerlendirilmiştir. Yapılan analizler en alt katmandaki saf tungsten yüzeyine ulaşana kadar en üst katmandaki oksit filmin tungsten hidroksil bileşiğinden oluştuğunu sonraki katmanların W/Wox kombinasyonları şeklinde devam ettiğini göstermiştir. Ayrıca, tungsten pullarinin yüzey topografisinin oksitleyici konsantrasyonuna bağli olarak değişme eğiliminde olduğu belirlenmiştir, gözlemlenen yüzey topografisi değişiminin yüzey ıslanabilirliğini ve toplam yüzey enerjisinide etkilediği sonucuna varılmıştır. Bundan dolayı, bu filmlerin koruyucu bir yapısı olduğu açıktır, ayrıca metal CMP performansını belirlemek için nano boyutta metal oksit ince filmlerin yüzey nano topografisinin incelenmesi gerekmektedir. Yüzey pürüzlülüğünün ve topografisinin oksitleyici konsantrasyonu ile değişimi ayrica Cahn-Hillard Eşitliği (CHE) yaklaşımı kullanılarak çalışılmıştır.

Kimyasal modifiye ince filmler CMP ön uç uygulamalarında silikon, silika ya da germanyum gibi malzemelerin çözünmesi sonucu başlıca hidroksil katmanlarından oluşmaktadır. Ge/SiO 2 sistemine kimyasal modifiye ince filmlerin etkisini değerlendirmek için, yüzey aktif maddeleri (surfaktan) ve oksitleyiciler ile kimyasal modifiye filmlerin modifikasyonu gereklidir çünkü kimyasal modifiye katmanlar bu uygulamalarda optimum aşınım hızı seçiciliğini sağlamanın bir fonksiyonudur. Bu nedenle, ilk olarak seçicilik analizleri yüzey aktif maddesi kullanmadan Atomik Kuvvet Mikroskubu ile tek partikül-yüzey etkileşimi seviyesinde aşınma hızına bağlı olarak analiz edilmiştir. Hem anyonik (Sodyum Dodesil Sulfat-SDS) hemde katyonik (Setil Trimetil Amonyum Bromur-C 12 TAB) yüzey aktif maddeleri pH ve oksitleyici konsantrasyonunun bir fonksiyonu olarak misel altı ve kritik misel konsantrasyonlarında değerlendirilmiştir. Ge ve SiO 2 pulların CMP performansları malzeme aşınım hızı, seçicilik ve yüzey kalitesi açısından değerlendirilmiştir. Bu savunma yedi bölümden oluşturulmuştur. Birinci bölüm CMP prosesine girişte nano boyutta kimyasal modifiye ince filmlerin CMP prosesinde önemi tartışılmaktadır. İkinci bölüm başlıca CMP prosesi bileşenlerinden, ön uç, orta kısım ve son uç uygulamalarına integrasyonundan, hemde CMP geliştirme calışmalarında kimyasal modifiye ince filmlerin karakterizasyonunun önemine yer verilmiştir. Bölüm 3 oksitleyici varlığında CMP öncesi ve sonrası CVD ile işlenmiş tungten pullar üzerindeki metal oksit koruyucu ince film karakterizasyonu ve koruyucu yapısı üzerine odaklanmıştır. Bölüm 4 ise süspansiyon içinde % olarak partikül konsantrasyonunun ve oksitleyici kimyasal hidrojen peroksitin konsantasyonunun değişiminin bir fonksiyonu olarak yüzey kalitesi ve malzeme aşınım hızı temelinde değerlendirilmiştir. Bölüm 5 'te ise bir ön yaklaşım olarak aşinma hızı testleri Ge/SiO 2 pulları üzerinde uygulanmıştır hem de uygun süspansiyon formülasyonları ile yeterli seçicilik ve malzeme aşınım hızı performansı değerlendirilmiştir. Bölüm 6 da bilinen yüzey aktif madde sistemleri shallow trench isolation (STI) CMP den Ge temelli STI CMP ye genişletilmiştir. CMP sonuçları 3 wt% partkül konsantrasyonu ile 200 - 300 nm partikül boyutlu silika partiküllerinden, yüzey aktif maddesi varlığında ve oksitleyici olarak 0. 1 M H 2 O 2 kullanılarak rapor edilmiştir. Deney dizaynı (DOE) programı ile sayısal olarak Ge/SiO 2 seçiciliği için optimum süspansiyon formülasyonlari sunulmuştur. Son olarak, Bölüm 7 tez calışmasında raporlanmış olan bulguların özetini ve tavsiye edilen gelecek calısmalar hakkında bilgi sağlamaktadır.

Bu nedenle, metal (tungsten) yüzeylerinde kimyasal modifiye ince filmlerin kalınlığı ve kompozisyonu karakterize edilmiştir, hemde yüzeyde oluşan oksit hacminin metal hacmine oranlanmasi ile Pilling-Bedworth (P-B) oranı hesaplanarak koruyucu film olup olmadıkları değerlendirilmiştir. Yapılan analizler en alt katmandaki saf tungsten yüzeyine ulaşana kadar en üst katmandaki oksit filmin tungsten hidroksil bileşiğinden oluştuğunu sonraki katmanların W/Wox kombinasyonları şeklinde devam ettiğini göstermiştir. Ayrıca, tungsten pullarinin yüzey topografisinin oksitleyici konsantrasyonuna bağli olarak değişme eğiliminde olduğu belirlenmiştir, gözlemlenen yüzey topografisi değişiminin yüzey ıslanabilirliğini ve toplam yüzey enerjisinide etkilediği sonucuna varılmıştır. Bundan dolayı, bu filmlerin koruyucu bir yapısı olduğu açıktır, ayrıca metal CMP performansını belirlemek için nano boyutta metal oksit ince filmlerin yüzey nano topografisinin incelenmesi gerekmektedir. Yüzey pürüzlülüğünün ve topografisinin oksitleyici konsantrasyonu ile değişimi ayrica Cahn-Hillard Eşitliği (CHE) yaklaşımı kullanılarak çalışılmıştır. CHE tersine difuzyon prensibine dayanarak yüzeyde nano yapıların oluşumunu açıklamaktadır ve CMP process değişkenlerinin bir fonksiyonu olarak malzeme aşınım hızı mekanizmasındaki degişikliklerin anlaşılmasına ışık tutması beklenmektedir. Tezin ikinci bölümünde ise, suspansiyon formulasyonları germanyum/silika CMP sistemlerinde seçiciliği sağlayabilmek için kimyasal modifiye ince filmlerin karakterizasyonu değlendirilmiştir. Kimyasal modifiye ince filmler CMP ön uç uygulamalarında silikon, silika ya da germanyum gibi malzemelerin çözünmesi sonucu başlıca hidroksil katmanlarından oluşmaktadır. Ge/SiO 2 sistemine kimyasal modifiye ince filmlerin etkisini değerlendirmek için, yüzey aktif maddeleri (surfaktan) ve oksitleyiciler ile kimyasal modifiye filmlerin modifikasyonu gereklidir çünkü kimyasal modifiye katmanlar bu uygulamalarda optimum aşınım hızı seçiciliğini sağlamanın bir fonksiyonudur. Bu nedenle, ilk olarak seçicilik analizleri yüzey aktif maddesi kullanmadan Atomik Kuvvet Mikroskubu ile tek partikül-yüzey etkileşimi seviyesinde aşınma hızına bağlı olarak analiz edilmiştir. Hem anyonik (Sodyum Dodesil Sulfat-SDS) hemde katyonik (Setil Trimetil Amonyum Bromur-C 12 TAB) yüzey aktif maddeleri pH ve oksitleyici konsantrasyonunun bir fonksiyonu olarak misel altı ve kritik misel konsantrasyonlarında değerlendirilmiştir. Ge ve SiO 2 pulların CMP performansları malzeme aşınım hızı, seçicilik ve yüzey kalitesi açısından değerlendirilmiştir. Bu savunma yedi bölümden oluşturulmuştur. Birinci bölüm CMP prosesine girişte nano boyutta kimyasal modifiye ince filmlerin CMP prosesinde önemi tartışılmaktadır. İkinci bölüm başlıca CMP prosesi bileşenlerinden, ön uç, orta kısım ve son uç uygulamalarına integrasyonundan, hemde CMP geliştirme calışmalarında kimyasal modifiye ince filmlerin karakterizasyonunun önemine yer verilmiştir. Bölüm 3 oksitleyici varlığında CMP öncesi ve sonrası CVD ile işlenmiş tungten pullar üzerindeki metal oksit koruyucu ince film karakterizasyonu ve koruyucu yapısı üzerine odaklanmıştır. Bölüm 4 ise süspansiyon içinde % olarak partikül konsantrasyonunun ve oksitleyici kimyasal hidrojen peroksitin konsantasyonunun değişiminin bir fonksiyonu olarak yüzey kalitesi ve malzeme aşınım hızı temelinde değerlendirilmiştir. Bölüm 5 'te ise bir ön yaklaşım olarak aşinma hızı testleri Ge/SiO 2 pulları üzerinde uygulanmıştır hem de uygun süspansiyon formülasyonları ile yeterli seçicilik ve malzeme aşınım hızı performansı değerlendirilmiştir. Bölüm 6 da bilinen yüzey aktif madde sistemleri shallow trench isolation (STI) CMP den Ge temelli STI CMP ye genişletilmiştir. CMP sonuçları 3 wt% partkül konsantrasyonu ile 200 - 300 nm partikül boyutlu silika partiküllerinden, yüzey aktif maddesi varlığında ve oksitleyici olarak 0. 1 M H 2 O 2 kullanılarak rapor edilmiştir. Deney dizaynı (DOE) programı ile sayısal olarak Ge/SiO 2 seçiciliği için optimum süspansiyon formülasyonlari sunulmuştur. Son olarak, Bölüm 7 tez calışmasında raporlanmış olan bulguların özetini ve tavsiye edilen gelecek calısmalar hakkında bilgi sağlamaktadır...|$|E

40|$|A review. Foam {{is common}} in Fe and {{steelmaking}} processes. Fe and steelmaking slags have inherent foaminess but the presence of strong <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> compounds like P 2 O 5, Cr 2 O 3, CaS, V 2 O 5, and CaF 2 make the foam more stable. Stable foam can form only {{in the presence of}} <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>agents.</b> When a bubble rises on the surface of a liquid, the film around it develops a concentration gradient of <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>agents</b> such that Marangoni force acts in upward direction. This prevents liquid drainage from the film. The presence of <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>agents</b> favors formation of smaller bubbles and prevents bubble rupture as well. So a strong <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>agent</b> where ds/dc is high makes the foam very stable. When a bubble comes into contact with a solid surface, the dynamic contact angle is different from the equil. value. If the former is less than the latter, there is a resultant outward force which tries to make the bubble flat. This force is responsible for the collapse of foamy slags in the presence of large carbonaceous particles. This force is not significant for very small bubbles and is not effective when carbon particles are much smaller than the bubble...|$|R
