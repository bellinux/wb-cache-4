5000|$|The second through <b>seventh</b> <b>days</b> of Sukkot (third through <b>seventh</b> <b>days</b> outside Israel) {{are called}} Chol HaMoed ( [...] - [...] "festival weekdays"). These days are {{considered}} by halakha {{to be more}} than regular weekdays but less than festival days. In practice, this means that all activities that are needed for the holiday—such as buying and preparing food, cleaning the house in honor of the holiday, or traveling to visit other people's sukkot or on family outings—are permitted by Jewish law. Activities that will interfere with relaxation and enjoyment of the holiday—such as laundering, mending clothes, engaging in labor-intensive activities—are not permitted.|$|R

The images of Khandoba and Malla are cleaned and worshipped. For six days a fast is observed. On the <b>seventh</b> <b>day</b> the worshippers break their fast by a feast known as the Champasashtliiche parne. An {{invitation}} to this feast is regarded as an invitation from the god Khandoba himself and is harder to refuse.|$|E

5|$|By February17, 80percent of {{the grid}} was restored; however, only 10percent homes were {{actually}} connected. The presence of dead vegetation {{left behind by the}} storm created fire hazards across the island, prompting the government to issue a ban on burning. The <b>Seventh</b> <b>Day</b> Adventist church primary school resumed classes on February15 despite losing a building. All other schools suspended activities until February22; however, the approach of Tropical Depression 11F delayed this until the following day. On February23, the European Union provided US$110,000 in emergency funds to the Cook Islands. Habitat for Humanity later sought to assist in the rebuilding process in April, with a funding goal of NZ$300,000 (US$210,000).|$|E
5|$|By {{the sixth}} or <b>seventh</b> <b>day,</b> all the skin lesions have become pustules. Between seven and ten days the pustules matured and reached their maximum size. The pustules were sharply raised, {{typically}} round, tense, and {{firm to the}} touch. The pustules were deeply embedded in the dermis, giving them {{the feel of a}} small bead in the skin. Fluid slowly leaked from the pustules, {{and by the end of}} the second week the pustules deflated, and started to dry up, forming crusts (or scabs). By day 16–20 scabs had formed over all the lesions, which have started to flake off, leaving depigmented scars.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Failure of anastomotic {{healing is}} one of the major {{complications}} in colorectal surgery. Because histamine plays an important role in immune and inflammatory reactions, we demonstrate the effects of famotidine on the healing of colonic anastomosis in rats. METHODS: Twenty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats were used in the study. Excision and end-to-end anastomosis was performed in the distal colon of the rat. The Famotidine Group received 2 mg/kg/day famotidine; the Control Group received the same amount of saline. Bursting pressure of anastomoses and hydroxyproline content of perianastomotic tissues were evaluated on the third and <b>seventh</b> <b>days</b> following surgery. RESULTS: Bursting pressures and hydroxyproline contents for the Famotidine Group were significantly lower than the equivalent parameters for the Control Group on both the third and <b>seventh</b> <b>days</b> post-surgery. CONCLUSIONS: According to our findings, famotidine exerts detrimental effects on the anastomotic bursting pressure and hydroxyproline content of perianastomotic tissues in the colon of rats...|$|R

5|$|On the <b>seventh</b> <b>day</b> {{after the}} person had died, people celebrated the sjaund (the word {{both for the}} funeral ale and the feast, since it {{involved}} a ritual drinking). The funeral ale {{was a way of}} socially demarcating the case of death. It was only after drinking the funeral ale that the heirs could rightfully claim their inheritance. If the deceased were a widow or the master of the homestead, the rightful heir could assume the high seat and thereby mark the shift in authority.|$|E

As with the launch, this was the first night landing of the program. The Shuttle orbiters had no on-board lights, due to the difficulty of designing landing lights to survive re-entry, and so the runway was lit by high-intensity xenon arc lamps to guide the orbiter in. There was no pressing operational requirement for a night landing, but there was a desire to prove it was possible. Footage of the landing was shown in the 1986 film SpaceCamp.|$|E

In the event, the majority decision was to remain in the city. The Eretrians made no attempt to stop the Persians landing, or advancing, and thus allowed themselves to be besieged.

40|$|PURPOSE: To define {{standard}} values of blood flow velocities and indices in the ophthalmic and central retinal arteries in the neonatal period. METHODS: Forty-two healthy full-term neonates comprised the study population. A color Doppler with mechanical sector probe {{was used for}} measuring blood flow velocity in the ophthalmic and central retinal arteries. Systolic, end diastolic, and mean-enveloped velocities were measured, and the resistance index and pulsatility index were calculated. RESULTS: Ophthalmic artery Doppler velocities were similar on {{the first and third}} days of life, but increased significantly on the fifth and <b>seventh</b> <b>days</b> of life; resistance index significantly increased {{during the first week of}} life, whereas pulsatility index did not change significantly. Doppler velocities of the central retinal artery were similar on the first and third days; they show a delayed increase compared to the ophthalmic artery. Central retinal artery blood flow velocities increased significantly from the third to <b>seventh</b> postnatal <b>day.</b> Resistance index also increased between the first two days and on the fifth and <b>seventh</b> postnatal <b>days,</b> while pulsatility index did not change. CONCLUSION: These data constitute a starting point for studying the possible relationship between eye circulation and pathogenesis of retinopathy of prematurity...|$|R
