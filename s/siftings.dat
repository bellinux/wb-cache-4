Krishnaghur, 130 miles from Calcutta, was the great centre of the worship of Krishna, one of the manifestations of Vishnu. Here two missionaries of the Church Missionary Society had been at work; and when the Bishop was there in 1837, he described them as having made [...] "a little beginning," [...] by keeping schools and holding conferences with the people, but they had then no adult convert. A year after a message was brought by a native, entreating for further help. There were 1,200 seriously inquiring into the doctrine, with many candidates for baptism, and at many places around it was the same. In the year 1840, the Bishop set forth to visit the spot and the adjacent districts, where almost all the villages seemed to be actuated by the same impulse. The missionaries did their utmost to distinguish between mere fashion and hope of gain and a true faith; but after all their <b>siftings,</b> large numbers were ready for baptism, and the hope was so great that the Bishop was full of thankful ecstasy, and could hardly sleep from agitation, joy, and anxiety.

Nowhere for me, in these extensive minings and <b>siftings.</b> Not {{the least of}} probable indication; but contrariwise, here and there, rather definite indications pointing directly the opposite way. [For example ("CORRESPONDENCE WITH FREDERSDORF"),--OEuvres,--xxvii. iii. 145.] Friedrich, in his own utterances and occasional rhymes, is abundantly cynical; now and then rises {{to a kind of}} epic cynicism, on this very matter. But at no time can the painful critic call it cynicism as of OTHER than an observer; always a kind of vinegar cleanness in it, EXCEPT in theory. Cynicism of an impartial observer in a dirty element; observer epically sensible (when provoked to it) of the brutal contemptibilities which lie in Human Life, alongside of its big struttings and pretensions. In Friedrich's utterances there is that kind of cynicism undeniable;--and yet he had a modesty almost female in regard to his own person; [...] "no servant having ever seen him in an exposed state."

Practical [...] "BLASPHEMY," [...] is it not, if you reflect? Strangely possible that sin, even now. And ought to be religiously abhorred by every soul that has the least piety or nobleness.

6000|$|... "I can't believe I was so crude," [...] the Howadji returned, {{with a fine}} annoyance. [...] "That is the {{conclusion}} you have characteristically jumped to without looking before you leap. I was going to approach the fact much more delicately, and I don't know but what by your haste you have shattered my ideal of the conditions. But I'll own that the great stumbling-block to my belief that the means of living in New York are cheaper than in the European capitals is that the house rents here are so incomparably higher than they are there. But I must distinguish and say that I mean flat-rents, for, oddly enough, flats are much dearer than houses. You can get a very pretty little house, in a fair quarter, with plenty of light {{and a good deal}} of sun, for two-thirds and sometimes one-half what you must pay for a flat with the same number of rooms, mostly dark or dim, and almost never sunny. Of course, a house is more expensive and more difficult to 'run,' but even with the cost of the greater service and of the furnace heat the rent does not reach that of a far less wholesome and commodious flat. There is one thing to be said in favor of a flat, however, and that is the women are in favor of it. The feminine instinct is averse to stairs; the sex likes to be safely housed against burglars, and when it must be left alone, it desires the security of neighbors, however strange the neighbors may be; it likes the authority of a janitor, the society of an elevator-boy. It hates a lower door, an area, an ash-barrel, and a back yard. But if it were willing to confront all these inconveniences, it is intimately, it is osseously, convinced that a house is not cheaper than a flat. As a matter of fact, neither a house nor a flat is cheap enough in New York to bear me out in my theory that New York is no more expensive than those Old World cities. To aid efficiently in my support I must invoke the prices of provisions, which I find, by inquiry at several markets on the better avenues, have reverted to the genial level of the earlier nineteen-hundreds, before the cattle combined with the trusts to send them up. I won't prosily rehearse the quotations of beef, mutton, pork, poultry, and fish; they can be had at any dealer's on demand; and they will be found less, on the whole, than in London, less than in Paris, less even than in Rome. They are greater no doubt than the prices in our large Western cities, but they are twenty per cent. less than the prices in Boston, and in the New England towns which hang upon Boston's favor for their marketing. I do not know how or why it is that while we wicked New-Yorkers pay twenty-five cents for our beefsteak, these righteous Bostonians should have to pay thirty, for the same cut and quality. Here I give twenty-eight a pound for my Java coffee; in the summer I live near an otherwise delightful New Hampshire town where I must give thirty-eight. It is strange that the <b>siftings</b> of three kingdoms, as the Rev. Mr. Higginson called his fellow-Puritans, should have come in their great-grandchildren to a harder fate in this than the bran and shorts and middlings of such harvestings as the fields of Ireland and Italy, of Holland and Hungary, of Poland and Transylvania and Muscovy afford. Perhaps it is because those <b>siftings</b> have run to such a low percentage of the whole New England population that they must suffer, along with the refuse of the mills--the Mills of the Gods--abounding in our city and its dependencies.|$|E

I say, here is my LIFE, if I see this by faith without me, through the operation of the Spirit within me: I am safe, I am at peace, I am comforted, I am encouraged, and I know that my comfort, peace, and encouragement is true, and given me from heaven, by the Father of mercies, through the Son of the Virgin Mary (Matt 1:21) who is the way to the Father of mercies (John 14:6), who is able to save to the uttermost, all that come to the Father by him (Heb 7:25). Because he, that very Man, with that very body wherewith he was crucified, is ascended into heaven (Acts 1:9-11), and there ever lives to make intercession for them that come to God by him. This is the rock, sinner, upon which, if thou be built, the gates of hell, nor Ranter, Quaker, sin, law, death, no nor the devil himself, shall ever be able to prevail against thee (Matt 16:16-18). And here I leave thee to the wisdom of the great God, who if he hath chosen thee in his Son, and brought thee to him; and hath made thee by faith to lay hold on him, thou needest not fear the devil with his <b>siftings,</b> snares, wiles, and fiery darts, wherewith he doth destroy thousands; but mayest with the Apostle (if thou live in the power and life of the love of God towards thee) cry out, 'I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord' (Rom 8:38,39).|$|E
60|$|It {{is natural}} and proper {{enough that the}} masses of {{explosive}} ammunition stored up in detective stories and the replete and solid sweet-stuff shops which are called sentimental novelettes should be popular with the ordinary customer. It {{is not difficult to}} realize that all of us, ignorant or cultivated, are primarily interested in murder and love-making. The really extraordinary thing is that the most appalling fictions are not actually so popular as that literature which deals with the most undisputed and depressing facts. Men are not apparently so interested in murder and love-making as they are in the number of different forms of latchkey which exist in London or the time that it would take a grasshopper to jump from Cairo to the Cape. The enormous mass of fatuous and useless truth which fills the most widely-circulated papers, such as Tit-Bits, Science <b>Siftings,</b> and many of the illustrated magazines, is certainly one of the most extraordinary kinds of emotional and mental pabulum on which man ever fed. It is almost incredible that these preposterous statistics should actually be more popular than the most blood-curdling mysteries and the most luxurious debauches of sentiment. To imagine it is like imagining the humorous passages in Bradshaw's Railway Guide read aloud on winter evenings. It is like conceiving a man unable to put down an advertisement of Mother Seigel's Syrup because he wished to know what eventually happened to the young man who was extremely ill at Edinburgh. In the case of cheap detective stories and cheap novelettes, we can most of us feel, whatever our degree of education, that {{it might be possible to}} read them if we gave full indulgence to a lower and more facile part of our natures; at the worst we feel that we might enjoy them as we might enjoy bull-baiting or getting drunk. But the literature of information is absolutely mysterious to us. We can no more think of amusing ourselves with it than of reading whole pages of a Surbiton local directory. To read such things would not be a piece of vulgar indulgence; it would be a highly arduous and meritorious enterprise. It is this fact which constitutes a profound and almost unfathomable interest in this particular branch of popular literature.|$|E
60|$|In {{that form}} at least I see him, and no revival {{of those years}} so puts to me the {{interesting}} question, so often aimlessly returned upon in later life, {{of the amount of}} truth in this or that case of young confidence in a glory to come--for another than one's self; of the likelihood of the wonders so flatteringly forecast. Many of our estimates were monstrous magnifications--though doing us even at that more good than harm; so that one isn't even sure that the happiest histories were to have been those of the least liberal mistakes. I like at any rate to think of our easy overstrainings--the possible flaw in many of which was not indeed to be put to the proof. That was the case for the general, and for every particular, impression of Will Temple, thanks to his early death in battle--at Chancellorsville, 1863; he having, among the quickened forces of the time, and his father's record helping him, leaped to a captaincy in the regular Army; but I cling to the idea that the <b>siftings</b> and sortings of life, had he remained subject to them, would still have left him the lustre that blinds and subdues. I even do more, at this hour; I ask myself, while his appearance and my personal feeling about it live for me again, what possible aftertime could have kept up the pitch of my sentiment--aftertime either of his or of mine. Blest beyond others, I think as we look back, the admirations, even the fondest (and which indeed were not of their nature fond?) that were not to know to their cost the inevitable test or strain; they are almost the only ones, of the true high pitch, that, without broken edges or other tatters to show, fold themselves away entire and secure, even as rare lengths of precious old stuff, in the scented chest of our savings. So great misadventure have too often known at all events certain of those that were to come to trial. The others are the residual, those we must keep when we can, so to be sure at least of a few, sacrificing as many possible mistakes and misproportions as need be to pay but for two or three of them. There could be no mistake about Gus Barker, who threw himself into the fray, that is into the cavalry saddle, as he might into a match at baseball (football being then undreamt of), and my last reminiscence of whom is the sight of him, on a brief leave for a farewell to his Harvard classmates after he had got his commission, crossing with two or three companions the expanse of Harvard Square that faced the old Law School, of which I found myself for that year (1862-63) a singularly alien member. I was afterwards sharply to regret the accident by which I on that occasion missed speech of him; but my present vision of his charming latent agility, which any motion showed, of his bright-coloured wagging head and of the large gaiety of the young smile that made his handsome teeth shine out, is after all the years but the more happily uneffaced. The point of all which connections, however, is that they somehow managed to make in the parental view no straight links for us with the matter-of-course of college. There were accidents too by the aid of which they failed of this the more easily. It comes to me that, for my own part, I thought of William at the time as having, or rather as so much more than having, already graduated; the effect of contact with his mind and talk, with the free play of his spirit and the irrepressible brush of his humour, couldn't have been greater had he carried off fifty honours. I felt in him such authority, so perpetually quickened a state of intellect and character, that the detail or the literal side of the question never so much as came up for me: I must have made out that to plenty of graduates, or of the graduating, nothing in the nature of such appearances attached. I think of our father moreover as no less affected by a like impression; so extremely, so immensely disposed do I see him to generalise his eldest son's gifts as by the largest, fondest synthesis, and not so much proceed upon them in any one direction as proceed from them, as it were, in all.|$|E
6000|$|I am {{ashamed to}} find myself back in England without having {{fulfilled}} the inward vow I took when I received your last good and generous letter--that of writing to you before my long stay on the continent was over. But I almost don't fail of that vow--inasmuch as I returned only day before yesterday. My eight months escape into the happy immunities of foreign life is over and the stern realities of London surround me, {{in the shape of}} stuffy midsummer heat (that of this metropolis has a truly British ponderosity--it's as dull as an article in a Quarterly,) smoke, circulars, invitations, bills, the one sauce that Talleyrand commemorated, and reverberations of the grotesque Jubilee. On the other hand my small house seems most pleasant and peculiar (in the sense of being my own,) and my servants are as punctual as they are prim--which is saying much. But I enjoyed my absence, and I shall endeavour to repeat it every year, for the future, on a smaller scale; that is, to leave London, not {{at the beginning of the}} winter but at the end, by the mid-April, and take the period of the insufferable Season regularly in Italy. It was a great satisfaction to me to find that I am as fond of that dear country as I ever was--and that its infinite charm and interest are one of the things in life to be most relied upon. I was afraid that the dryness of age--which drains us of so many sentiments--had reduced my old tendresse to a mere memory. But no--it is really so much in my pocket, as it were, to feel that Italy is always there. It is rather rude, my dear Grace, to say all this to you--for whom it is there to so little purpose. But if I should observe this scruple about all the places that you don't go to, or are not in, when I write to you, my writing would go very much on one leg. I was back again in Venice--where I paid a second visit late in the season (from the middle of May to July 1st)--when I got your last letter. I was staying at the Palazzo Barbaro, with the Daniel Curtises--the happy owners, to-day, of that magnificent house--a place of which the full charm only sinks into your spirit as you go on living there, seeing it in all its hours and phases. I went for ten days, and they clinging to me, I stayed five weeks: the longest visit I ever paid a [...] "private family." ... In the interval between my two visits to Venice I took again some rooms at the Villa Bricchieri at Bellosguardo--the one just below your old Ombrellino--where I had stayed for three December weeks on my arrival in Florence. The springtime there was enchanting, and you know what a thing that incomparable view is to live with. I really did live with it, and rejoiced in it every minute, holding it to be (to my sensibilities) positively the most beautiful and interesting in the world. Florence was given over to fêtes during most of those weeks--the fêtes of the completion of the façade of the Duomo--which by the way (the new façade) isn't [...] "half bad." [...] It is of a very splendouriferous effect, and there is doubtless too much of it. But it does great honour to the contemporary (as well as to the departed) Italian--and I don't believe such work could have been produced elsewhere than in that country of the delicate hand and the insinuating chisel. I stepped down into the fêtes from my hill top--and even put on a crimson lucco and a beautiful black velvet headgear and disported myself at the great ballo storico that was given at the Palazzo Vecchio to the King and Queen. This had the defect of its class--a profusion of magnificent costumes but a want of entrain; and the success of the whole episode was much more a certain really splendid procession of the old time, with all the Strozzis, Guicciardinis, Rucellais, etc., mounted on magnificent horses and wearing admirable dresses with the childlike gallantry and glee with which only Italians can wear them, riding through the brown old streets and followed by an immense train of citizens all in the carefullest quattro-cento garb. This was really a noble picture and testified to the latent love of splendour which is still in those dear people and which only asks for a favouring chance to shine out, even at the cost of ruining them. Before leaving Italy I spent a week with Mrs. Kemble at Lago Maggiore--she having dipped over there, in spite of torrid heat. She is a very (or at least a partly) extinct volcano to-day, and very easy and delightful to dwell with, in her aged resignation and adoucissements. But she did suggest to me, on seeing her again after so long an interval, that it is rather a melancholy mistake, in this uncertain life of ours, to have founded oneself on so many rigidities and rules--so many <b>siftings</b> and sortings. Mrs. Kemble is toute d'une pièce, more than any one, probably, that ever lived; she moves in a mass, and if she does so little as to button her glove it is the whole of her [...] "personality" [...] that does it. Let us be flexible, dear Grace; let us be flexible! and even if we don't reach the sun we shall at least have been up in a balloon.--I left Stresa on the 15th of this month, had a glorious day on the Simplon amid mountain streams and mountain flowers, and came quickly home.... I shall be here for the rest of the summer--save for little blotches of absence--and I look forward to some quiet months of work. I am trying, not without success, to get out of society--as hard as some people try to get in. I want to be dropped and cut and consummately ignored. This only demands a little patience, and I hope eventually to elbow my way down to the bottom of the wave--to achieve an obscurity. This would sound fatuous if I didn't add that success is easily within my grasp. I know it all--all that one sees by [...] "going out"--to-day, as if I had made it. But if I had, I would have made it better! I think of you on your porch--amid all your creepers and tendrils; and wherever you are, dear Grace, I am your very faithful and much remembering friend, ...|$|E

There he was a printer's devil; from 1907 to 1910 he worked in editorial positions at the Enterprise Ledger (Enterprise, AL), Dothan Daily <b>Siftings,</b> Selma Times, and at the Pensacola Journal, where he wrote editorials in 1910. That year he moved to be {{associate editor of the}} Montgomery Advertiser in the state capital, where he married in 1912, became chief editor in 1926, and was appointed probate judge in 1933.|$|E
5000|$|As {{early as}} 1892, Russell's views and {{management}} style were strongly criticized by certain individuals associated with his ministry. In 1893 a paper was written and circulated to Bible Students in Pittsburgh by associates Otto van Zech, Elmer Bryan, J. B. Adamson, S. G. Rogers, Paul Koetitz, and others. It accused Russell {{of being a}} dictatorial leader, a shrewd businessman who appeared eager to collect funds from the selling of the Millennial Dawn books, of cheating one of them financially, and of issuing thousands of Millennial Dawn books under a female pseudonym. Russell wrote a booklet A Conspiracy Exposed and Harvest <b>Siftings</b> in response, issuing it as an extra to the April 1894 Zion's Watch Tower magazine. He intended to pre-empt efforts by his critics to circulate their views to a wider audience of Bible Students. Russell printed copies of letters he had received from these former associates {{in order to show}} that their claims were false, and that those involved 'were guided by Satan in an attempt to subvert his work' as a [...] "minister of the gospel".|$|E
5000|$|After {{three years}} of {{marriage}} she moved to Stockholm where, in 1868, the count was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs. After {{the death of her}} husband in 1871, she still lived in Sweden for several years. In 1879 the countess began investigating Spiritism and in 1881 joined the London Lodge of the Theosophical Society. She met H.P. Blavatsky in London in 1884. She was an important partner for Blavatsky and essential support for the work of The Secret Doctrine. Some time after Blavatsky had come in 1885 at Wurzburg she was joined by the Wachmeister, who [...] "loyally and lovingly helped in the great work." [...] In 1887 Wachtmeister organized the Theosophical Publishing Co. alongside Bertram Keightley, in order to publish Blavatsky's works. In 1888-95 she was an editor of the Theosophical <b>Siftings.</b> She was secretary and treasurer of the Blavatsky Lodge in London. In 1890 she {{became a member of the}} Inner Group of Blavatsky Lodge. In 1893 Besant and Wachtmeister went to India. In 1894 she had a lecture in New York City on theosophical questions. In 1896 Wachmeister was toured the USA and Australia lecturing on Theosophy.|$|E
5000|$|On July 12, Rutherford {{traveled}} to Pittsburgh and exercised his {{right under the}} society's charter to fill what he claimed were four vacancies on the board, appointing A. H. Macmillan and Pennsylvania Bible Students W. E. Spill, John A. Bohnet and George H. Fisher as directors. Rutherford called {{a meeting of the}} new board on July 17, where the directors passed a resolution expressing [...] "hearty approval" [...] of the actions of their president and affirming him as [...] "the man the Lord has chosen to carry on the work that yet remains to be done." [...] On July 31 he called a meeting of the People's Pulpit Association, a Watch Tower Society subsidiary incorporated in New York, to expel Hirsh and Hoskins as directors {{on the grounds that they}} were opposing the work of the Association. When the resolution failed to gain a majority, Rutherford exercised shareholder proxies provided for the annual meeting in New York the previous January to secure their expulsion. On August 1 the Watch Tower Society published a 24-page journal, Harvest <b>Siftings,</b> subtitled [...] "The evil one again attempts to disrupt the Society", in which Rutherford stated his version of the events and explained why he had appointed the new board members.|$|E
50|$|This {{method of}} typographic {{engraving}} {{was brought to}} a practical form and patented in 1860 by an American wood engraver, Mr. de Witt Clinton Hitchcock. The first step in his process is to reduce French chalk or talc to an extremely fine state of division by repeated grindings, elutriations, and <b>siftings.</b> After this is complete, a layer of the material (over an eighth of an inch in thickness) is forced down upon and made to adhere to a thick zinc plate, the necessary pressure being obtained {{by means of an}} hydraulic press, the platen of which is faced with a polished steel plate, so as to communicate a good surface to the layer of compressed French chalk. The device is now drawn reversed on the prepared block with an ink consisting of a weak solution of glue colored by lamp black or some other pigment. In drawing on the prepared block, care must be taken not to damage the somewhat tender surface of the compressed chalk and the safest instrument with which to apply the glutinous ink is a fine sable brush, but an ordinary pen may be employed if the operation of drawing is performed with caution. A pad of silk velvet or a fitch brush may be used for rubbing the block so as to leave the lines in relief, and it is quite sufficient to continue the friction until a depth equal to the thickness of an ordinary playing card is produced, the spaces corresponding to any extended whites of the engraving being then cut out by means of a tool. A 10% solution of sodium silicate may be used for hardening the block and, when dry, nothing remains but to take a mould from it and to reproduce it in metal.|$|E
40|$|Research {{deals with}} granite <b>siftings</b> as fine {{aggregate}} possibilities {{to be used}} for manufacturing cleaved surface exterior concrete bricks. The article describes the influence of granite <b>siftings</b> on the technological properties of concrete mixture and on the physical mechanical properties of cleaved surface exterior concrete bricks formed using these mixtures and forecasts product durability. The following several compositions of concrete mixture for producing exterior concrete bricks are composed: using only 0 / 4 fraction sand (B 1) as a fine aggregate, using only 0 / 2 fraction granite <b>siftings</b> (B 2), and 50 % of 0 / 4  fraction sand replacing with 0 / 2 fraction granite <b>siftings</b> (B 3) depending on the volume. The products were formed in metal moulds; at a later stage, they were cleaved in half. The technological properties of concrete mixture and the physical mechanical properties of cleaved surface exterior concrete bricks formed using the above introduced mixtures were tested forecasting product durability. The results of the conducted research reveal that due to the properly selected ratio between sand and granite <b>siftings</b> in the fine aggregate, granite <b>siftings</b> may be used for manufacturing cleaved surface exterior concrete bricks.

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{study of}} influence of thermo-electric fly ashes, dolomite <b>siftings,</b> quartz sand and granite fines on {{the properties of}} self-compacting concrete (SCC). During the research a part of cement was replaced by fly ashes (from 5 to 30 %), or quartz sand fines (from 2. 5 to 10 %), or granite fines (from 2. 5 to 10 %) and granulometrical composition of aggregates was modified by dolomite <b>siftings</b> fr. 0 / 2. It was established that fly ash and dolomite <b>siftings</b> did not increase water quantity {{necessary in order to}} make the same consistence of self-compacting concrete. It can be explained that small particles of fly ashes and dolomite <b>siftings</b> are contained among the particles of sand and coarse aggregates, and therefore the granulometrical composition is improved. There was observed no bleeding or segregation in self-compacting concrete with fly ashes, though the input of cement was less. If a part of cement is replaced with quartz sand fines (quartz-sand fines fineness are 1. 28 time more than fineness of cement), the bleeding is observed, because their water absorption is lower. The data of the experiments demonstrates that fly ashes and dolomite <b>siftings</b> positively modify the consistence of self-compacting concrete, increase the compression strength of concrete up to 15 %, when fly ashes was used, and up to 9 %, when dolomite <b>siftings</b> was used. Therefore admixtures of fly ashes and dolomite <b>siftings</b> reduce the shrinkage strains (with fly ashes up to 25. 4 % and with dolomite <b>siftings</b> up to 18 %). There was established, that is rationally to replace 2. 5 … 5 % of cement by quartz sand or granite fines...|$|E
