[...] Judge Scott <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>sadly</b> at luncheon table, {{when his son}} narrated the lesson he had given White Fang. [...] "Once they've got the habit and the taste of blood [...] ." [...] Again he <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>sadly.</b>|$|E
60|$|Lord John gave {{a shrill}} whistle, and Summerlee <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>sadly.</b>|$|E
60|$|He <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>sadly,</b> {{and drew}} back {{again with a}} heavy sigh.|$|E
6000|$|... "You won't {{be at all}} {{beautiful}} if you eat me," [...] he said, <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>sadly.</b> [...] "Handsome is as handsome does, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's awful!" [...] {{said the}} donkey, sitting upon <b>his</b> {{haunches}} and <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>sadly.</b> [...] "What {{do you suppose}} possessed the author to make you so hungry for girls? Do you eat animals, also?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor Tom! I wish I {{did know}} where you have gone!" [...] said Fred, <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>sadly</b> as he gazed on the floor, and taking no notice {{whatever}} of the threatening action of his visitor.|$|R
60|$|Henri, {{who was a}} {{sleek and}} {{handsome}} man, with black moustache and imperial, <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>sadly.</b>|$|E
60|$|He <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>sadly,</b> murmuring, “Too bad, too bad,” {{while the}} hunters burst into guffaws of laughter.|$|E
60|$|Then he told {{as much as}} {{he could}} about his {{stricken}} brother. Anderson Rover <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>sadly.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed," [...] I said, {{mourning}} within {{myself that}} we should not {{be in a position to}} bring about the fulfilment of that prophecy, which, as Hans said, <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>sadly,</b> [...] "was a great pity, a very great pity!" ...|$|R
60|$|The victorious skipper {{looked up}} and down the lonely road, and <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>sadly</b> at the noble steed which had brought him into this mess, tenderly felt his bruised and aching head, and then set off as fast as his foot would permit up the road.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear lady, it {{is nothing}} of the sort," [...] he answered, <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>sadly.</b> [...] "I have felt it growing upon me for years. Besides, it is hereditary. My mother opened a post-office savings bank account for me. At an early age I {{engineered}} a corner in marbles and sold out at a huge profit. I am like the starving dyspeptic at the rich man's feast." ...|$|R
60|$|This was all Samuel Hausermann could tell, and Charles Davis corroborated his statement. Dave <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>sadly.</b>|$|E
60|$|My father <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>sadly</b> as he {{marked his}} dusky face and laboured breathing. 'How of your soul?' he asked.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] {{replied the}} Tongue, <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>sadly,</b> [...] "and yet we {{suffered}} Cat, whom you call Shadrach, to make off {{with that of}} your fat brother; yes, and even {{gave it to him}} after his own beast had been lamed by accident. Well, it is our bad luck, and without doubt Harmac is angry with us to-day. But your answer, O Walda Nagasta, your answer, O Rose of Mur?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Found him?' was the {{instantaneous}} {{question of}} both; but Hardy <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> so <b>sadly,</b> that the Doctor hastily exclaimed, 'What then?' ...|$|R
60|$|One {{beautiful}} {{spring morning}} the King was walking through his gardens with these three sons, gazing with admiration {{at the various}} fruit-trees, {{some of which were}} a mass of blossom, whilst others were bowed to the ground laden with rich fruit. During their wanderings they came unperceived on a piece of waste land where three splendid trees grew. The King looked on them for a moment, and then, <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>sadly,</b> he passed on in silence.|$|R
60|$|Psmith {{watched him}} lounge from the room, and <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>sadly.</b> All {{was not well}} with his {{confidential}} secretary and adviser.|$|E
6000|$|The Knave <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>sadly.</b> 'Do I {{look like}} it?' he said. (Which he {{certainly}} did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Spring!" [...] ejaculated Auchincloss. Then he <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>sadly</b> and a far-away look filmed his eyes. [...] "Reckon you'd call some late." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] commented Sir Andrew, <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>sadly,</b> [...] "if the fellow's {{heart is}} {{hard it is}} honest, so may he be forgiven who has {{something}} to forgive {{like the rest of}} us. Now hearken to me, son and daughter. Wrong, grievous and dreadful, has been done to you both. Yet, until death or the Church levels it, a wall that you may not climb stands between you, and when you meet it must be as friends--no more." ...|$|R
6000|$|Davin {{rose from}} his box and went towards the players, <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>sadly.</b> But in a moment his sadness left {{him and he was}} hotly disputing with Cranly and the two players who had {{finished}} their game. A match of four was arranged, Cranly insisting, however, that his ball should be used. He let it rebound twice or thrice to his hand and struck it strongly and swiftly towards the base of the alley, exclaiming in answer to its thud: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You remind me," [...] pursued Major Fitz-David, <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>sadly,</b> [...] "of another charming {{friend of}} mine--a French friend--Madame Mirliflore. You are {{a person of}} prodigious {{tenacity}} of purpose. Madame Mirliflore is a person of prodigious tenacity of purpose. She {{happens to be in}} London. Shall we have her at our little dinner?" [...] The Major brightened at the idea, and took up the pen again. [...] "Do tell me," [...] he said, [...] "what is your favorite autumn soup?" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was pale}} and excited, and <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>sadly</b> when his many {{employees}} offered their services in any way they could be used.|$|E
60|$|The boy nodded, {{and turned}} away to lead Nora to the stable. The man looked after him a moment, and <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>sadly.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd {{have set}} them two feet wider apart; they're too narrow, old chap, too narrow." [...] Poppleton <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>sadly</b> at the gates.|$|E
60|$|Mrs Verloc, {{with all}} the placidity of an {{experienced}} wife, expressed a confident opinion as to the cause, and suggested the usual remedies; but her husband, rooted {{in the middle of}} the room, <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> lowered <b>head</b> <b>sadly.</b>|$|R
6000|$|He wonderfully glared. [...] "Am I then already {{frightening}} you?" [...] He <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> rather <b>sadly.</b> [...] "I'm not in {{the least}} trying yet. There's something," [...] he added after an instant, [...] "that I do want too awfully to ask you." ...|$|R
60|$|Toby <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> mournfully, as if deploring that depravity {{which could}} cause a boy {{to run away from}} such a tender hearted {{employer}} and from such a desirable position. But even as he <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> so <b>sadly</b> he looked wistfully at the peanuts, and Mr. Lord observed the look.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{will bring}} the others on us," [...] muttered Tamas, and even old Mr. Clifford <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>sadly.</b> But the Molimo only said: ...|$|E
6000|$|He <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>sadly.</b> 'They {{would have}} been even more glad than I am to welcome you home; they were older, and knew you better.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dat so--Won Lung lose fliends on junk--six, seven, ten--don't {{know how}} many yet," [...] and the Chinese officer <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>sadly.</b> [...] "Bad war, bad!" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{asked this}} with kindly {{interest}} as {{he laid his}} strong hand on the sick man's shoulder; but the doctor <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and smiled <b>sadly.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{stranger}} {{gave her}} again a silent smile. He had a kindly mouth and probing eyes. And he <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> a little <b>sadly,</b> it seemed.|$|R
6000|$|All eyes swept {{round to}} Wilding {{who sat in}} silence, listening; Monmouth's were laden with inquiry and some anxiety. Wilding <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> slowly, <b>sadly.</b> [...] "You must not depend upon him," [...] he answered; [...] "Lord Gervase was not yet ripe. A little longer and I think I must have won him for Your Grace." ...|$|R
