5|$|A {{physical}} examination and medical history {{are generally not}} enough to distinguish between infectious and non-infectious bursitis; aspiration of the bursal fluid is often required for this, along with a cell culture and Gram stain of the aspirated fluid. Septic prepatellar bursitis may be diagnosed if the fluid is {{found to have a}} neutrophil count above 1500 per microliter, a threshold <b>significantly</b> <b>lower</b> than that of septic arthritis (50,000 cells per microliter).

5|$|A {{study in}} 1971–72 found that {{although}} Cleveland's crime rate was <b>significantly</b> <b>lower</b> than other large urban areas, most Cleveland residents feared crime.

5|$|In 2011 (the {{last year}} for which {{information}} is available), Phoenix had a slightly younger population than the country as a whole.

Phoenix's percentage of 18.8% in the next age group, 45–64 was also a great deal lower than the national average of 26.6%. This results in 73% of Phoenix's population being 44 or younger, as compared to the national percentage of 60.|$|E

The rating averages 138 where the creek is in Benton and the lowest rating is 115. This rating occurred downstream of the Market Street bridge in Benton.|$|E

5|$|In a {{land where}} {{approximately}} 90% of the original island forest has been destroyed, ruffed lemurs cling to {{only a small fraction}} of their original range. Completely dependent upon large fruiting trees, neither species appears to be flexible with its habitat choice, with selective logging resulting in <b>significantly</b> <b>lower</b> population densities. Although they can survive in very disturbed habitats with lower population densities, they are still especially vulnerable to habitat disturbance. Decreased genetic diversity, in tandem with hunting, natural disasters, predation, and disease, can easily wipe out small populations.|$|E

The density of the cane toad is <b>significantly</b> <b>lower</b> within its native distribution than in places where it has been introduced.
