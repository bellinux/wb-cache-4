5|$|Zinc oxide {{can be used}} in ointments, creams, and lotions {{to protect}} against sunburn and other damage to the skin caused by {{ultraviolet}} light (see <b>sunscreen).</b> It is the broadest spectrum UVA and UVB absorber that is approved for use as a <b>sunscreen</b> by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and is completely photostable. When used as an ingredient in <b>sunscreen,</b> zinc oxide blocks both UVA (320–400nm) and UVB (280–320nm) rays of ultraviolet light. Zinc oxide and the other most common physical <b>sunscreen,</b> titanium dioxide, are considered to be nonirritating, nonallergenic, and non-comedogenic. Zinc from zinc oxide is, however, slightly absorbed into the skin.|$|E
5|$|As bikinis leave most of {{the body}} exposed to {{potentially}} dangerous UV radiation, overexposure can cause sunburn, skin cancer, {{as well as other}} acute and chronic health effects on the skin, eyes, and immune system. As a result, medical organizations recommend that bikini wearers protect themselves from UV radiation by using broad-spectrum <b>sunscreen,</b> which has been shown to protect against sunburn, skin cancer, wrinkling and sagging skin. Certain <b>sunscreen</b> ingredients can cause harm if they penetrate the skin over time.|$|E
5|$|Side effects include {{increased}} skin photosensitivity, dryness, redness {{and occasional}} peeling. <b>Sunscreen</b> use is often advised during treatment, to prevent sunburn. Lower concentrations of benzoyl peroxide {{are just as}} effective as higher concentrations in treating acne but are associated with fewer side effects. Unlike antibiotics, benzoyl peroxide {{does not appear to}} generate bacterial antibiotic resistance.|$|E

40|$|Awareness of {{ultraviolet}} radiation-induced {{skin damage}} creates {{the need for}} the development of broad-spectrum, safe and cosmetically acceptable <b>sunscreens.</b> Being relatively inert, safe, stable and non-irritating, physical <b>sunscreens</b> are particularly useful for patients with sensitive skin who cannot tolerate chemical <b>sunscreens.</b> However, they form a thick visible pigment layer on the skin. To overcome this drawback, microfine oxides have been developed which made the <b>sunscreens</b> virtually transparent when applied on the skin. This article reviews the rationale for the comeback of physical <b>sunscreens</b> by analyzing data from various sources...|$|R
5|$|To {{help keep}} the {{building}} cool, Belluschi added bronze-colored translucent corrugated panel <b>sunscreens</b> to the facade. Supported by a bronze anodized aluminum lattice, the <b>sunscreens</b> are made of Rohm and Haas's principal product, Plexiglas. The use of <b>sunscreens</b> and dark colors gave the facade a textured pattern and overall effect of avoiding making the building appear oversized. Besides the <b>sunscreens,</b> Plexiglas {{was used in the}} board room, in a few of the artistic commissions and light fixtures by designer György Kepes.|$|R
5|$|In 2006, Sara Lee {{spun off}} its {{clothing}} sector into HanesBrands Inc., which now runs the Playtex apparel business. The next year Playtex Products acquired the Hawaiian Tropic <b>sunscreen</b> company for $83 million. Later that year Playtex Products {{was acquired by}} Energizer Holdings for $1.16 billion. Playtex Products was sued in 2008, when a mother accused the company of not adequately disclosing their baby bottles contained bisphenol A. After Canada considered banning the chemical, the company took it out of their bottles the following year. In 2008, Playtex Products was acquired by Energizer Holdings.|$|E

Originally, the museum was planned parallel to the river, but was quickly changed so it would lie perpendicular to the river, for the purpose of providing a better view to visitors. The western façade of the museum is a screen wall composed of laminated glass tiles, providing a <b>sunscreen</b> for the building. The underside {{is constructed}} of aluminum. Some critics dislike the bridge design, saying it looks too much like a trailer on stilts.|$|E
5|$|Playtex is an American {{brand name}} for undergarments, baby products, gloves, {{feminine}} products and <b>sunscreen.</b> The brand began in 1947, when International Latex Corporation (ILC) created a division named Playtex {{to produce and}} sell latex products. Playtex {{was the first to}} advertise undergarments on national television in 1955 and the first to show a woman wearing only a bra from the waist-up in a commercial in 1977.|$|E

5|$|According to Energizer Holdings' 2012 annual report, Playtex Products LLC is {{the largest}} {{producer}} of household gloves, hand wipes and <b>sunscreen,</b> {{as well as the}} second largest producer of tampons in the US. The best-selling Playtex tampon is the Gentle Glide brand, which was first introduced in 1973. It also manufactures the Playtex Sport tampon, which targets young athletes. Both brands are sold in regular, super and super-plus absorbency. Playtex had a 29 percent share of a $550 million market for tampons in 1994 and a 30 percent share of a $780 million market by 2000.|$|E
5|$|An {{elephant}} uses mud as a <b>sunscreen,</b> protecting {{its skin}} from ultraviolet light. Although tough, an elephant's skin is very sensitive. Without regular mud baths {{to protect it}} from burning, insect bites and moisture loss, an elephant's skin suffers serious damage. After bathing, the elephant will usually use its trunk to blow dust onto its body and this dries into a protective crust. Elephants have difficulty releasing heat through the skin because of their low surface-area-to-volume ratio, which is many times smaller than that of a human. They have even been observed lifting up their legs, presumably in an effort to expose their soles to the air.|$|E
5|$|A {{paramedic}} is let into a {{house to}} the sounds of panic. Earlier, the fastidious Angela prepares to host a party for the 79th birthday of her mother, Maggie. Angela's daughter, Katie, heads to her room to complete her homework. When Angela moves a cake, she reveals the head of Jim, her husband. Jim plans to play a trick on Pat—a practical joker and the husband of Angela's sister, Carol (a recovering alcoholic)—by hiding under the cake. Maggie, Carol and Pat—the latter wearing a wolf mask—arrive at the house. As the three settle, Pat plugs in his mobile to charge—something Jim had asked Angela to prevent—and secretly places ice in a bucket. Carol privately drinks from a <b>sunscreen</b> bottle while ostensibly unblocking the toilet after her mother could not flush it. Angela is proud that the party food is from Marks's, but Carol mocks Angela's middle class affectations. Maggie wants a photograph with the food on the table, and Carol lights the cake's candles, which burn towards to the flammable fake cake—under which Jim is still hiding. Katie greets her nana and aunt, with Maggie insisting that she tell the joke from Pat's card. Panicking, Angela blows out the candles. The room clears, and Jim is left frustrated.|$|E
40|$|The Malaysian skincare {{industry}} is growing rapidly {{with a vast}} number of new <b>sunscreens</b> being produced annually. Inadequate skincare regulations and lack of enforcement have resulted in the overrating of sunscreens’ quality. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the local and international <b>sunscreens</b> and {{to determine the effects of}} adding concentrated antioxidants into them. Three local and three internationally manufactured <b>sunscreens</b> were tested for the in vitro Ultraviolet A protection factor (UVAPF), Sun Protection Factor (SPF) and photostability. The creams were spread onto roughened polymethylmethacrylate plates where the absorbance was measured using a spectrophotometer before and after two hours of sunlight irradiation. The procedure was repeated combining available concentrated vitamin C and E creams. International <b>sunscreens</b> were found to have more accurate SPF labels (p= 0. 009) while local <b>sunscreens</b> were found to be more photostable (p= 0. 003). However, both <b>sunscreens</b> had inadequate UVAPF (p= 0. 471). Vitamin C enhanced the SPF values (p= 0. 04) of both groups of <b>sunscreens</b> while vitamin E enhanced their photostability (p= 0. 000). Interestingly, combining vitamins C and E rich creams with the <b>sunscreens</b> had no effect on the SPF and UVAPF values as compared to the use of a single vitamin. More importantly, the combination of vitamins decreased the photostability (p= 0. 002) of <b>sunscreens</b> as compared to the addition of vitamin E alone. In conclusion, photoprotection is best achieved when <b>sunscreens</b> are used together with creams containing either vitamin C or E alone.

40|$|The UVA (320 – 400 nm) {{photoprotection}} of four {{commercially available}} <b>sunscreens</b> with different sun protection factors was evaluated in 8 -methoxypsoralen (8 -MOP) treated mouse epidermis {{with the number}} of sunburn cells (SBCs) as the end-point. SBC production in 8 -MOP sensitized mouse epidermis with and without application of <b>sunscreens</b> is dose-related. The difference between the slopes of the dose-response curves of the control group and the four <b>sunscreens</b> was highly significant (p < 0. 001). It appears that the SBC production was modified both by the dose of the UVA irradiation administered and by the UVA photoprotection of four <b>sunscreens.</b> it could be concluded that the number SBCs in 8 -MOP sensitized mouse epidermis is a useful parameter to quantify the degree of UVA photoprotection of <b>sunscreens...</b>|$|R
5|$|Hydroquinone lightens {{the skin}} when applied topically by {{inhibiting}} tyrosinase, the enzyme responsible for converting the amino acid tyrosine {{to the skin}} pigment melanin, and is used to treat acne-associated postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. By interfering with new production of melanin in the epidermis, hydroquinone leads to less hyperpigmentation as darkened skin cells are naturally shed over time. Improvement in skin hyperpigmentation is typically seen within six months when used twice daily. Hydroquinone is ineffective for hyperpigmentation affecting deeper layers of skin such as the dermis. The use of a <b>sunscreen</b> with SPF15 or higher {{in the morning with}} reapplication every two hours is recommended when using hydroquinone. Its application only to affected areas lowers the risk of lightening the color of normal skin but can lead to a temporary ring of lightened skin around the hyperpigmented area. Hydroquinone is generally well-tolerated; side effects are typically mild (e.g., skin irritation) and occur with use of a higher than the recommended 4% concentration. Most preparations contain the preservative sodium metabisulfite, which has been linked to rare cases of allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and severe asthma exacerbations in susceptible people. In extremely rare cases, repeated improper topical application of high-dose hydroquinone has been associated with an accumulation of homogentisic acid in connective tissues, a condition known as exogenous ochronosis.|$|E
25|$|Medical {{organizations}} {{recommend that}} patients {{protect themselves from}} UV radiation by using <b>sunscreen.</b> Five <b>sunscreen</b> ingredients {{have been shown to}} protect mice against skin tumors. However, some <b>sunscreen</b> chemicals produce potentially harmful substances if they are illuminated while in contact with living cells. The amount of <b>sunscreen</b> that penetrates into the lower layers of the skin may be large enough to cause damage.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>sunscreen</b> lotions {{now include}} {{compounds}} such as titanium dioxide which helps protect against UVA rays. Other UVA blocking compounds found in <b>sunscreen</b> include zinc oxide and avobenzone.|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} photo-protective {{measures}} adopted {{for protection from}} the solar radiation especially the UV radiation spectrum, <b>sunscreens</b> being the main agents. Besides the traditional approach of topical use of <b>sunscreens,</b> both chemical and physical, a new approach has emerged to use systemic agents {{in the form of}} vitamins and minerals.

25|$|In an {{experiment}} by Hanson et al. {{that was published}} in 2006, the amount of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured in untreated and in <b>sunscreen</b> treated skin. In the first 20 minutes, the film of <b>sunscreen</b> had a protective effect {{and the number of}} ROS species was smaller. After 60 minutes, however, the amount of absorbed <b>sunscreen</b> was so high that the amount of ROS was higher in the sunscreen-treated skin than in the untreated skin. The study indicates that <b>sunscreen</b> must be reapplied within 2 hours in order to prevent UV light from penetrating to sunscreen-infused live skin cells.|$|E
25|$|The {{photochemical}} {{properties of}} melanin {{make it an}} excellent photoprotectant. However, <b>sunscreen</b> chemicals cannot dissipate {{the energy of the}} excited state as efficiently as melanin and therefore, if <b>sunscreen</b> ingredients penetrate into the lower layers of the skin, the amount of reactive oxygen species may be increased. The amount of <b>sunscreen</b> that penetrates through the stratum corneum {{may or may not be}} large enough to cause damage.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sunscreen</b> {{appears to}} be {{effective}} in preventing melanoma. In the past, use of sunscreens with a sun protection factor (SPF) rating of 50 or higher on exposed areas were recommended; as older sunscreens more effectively blocked UVA with higher SPF. Currently, newer <b>sunscreen</b> ingredients (avobenzone, zinc oxide, and titanium dioxide) effectively block both UVA and UVB even at lower SPFs. <b>Sunscreen</b> also protects against squamous cell carcinoma, another skin cancer.|$|E
50|$|Certain <b>sunscreens</b> {{in water}} under {{ultraviolet}} light {{can increase the}} production of hydrogen peroxide, which damages phytoplankton. Oxybenzone damages coral.

50|$|Since sunburn and suntan are {{induced by}} the same {{mechanism}} (direct DNA damage), these substances increase the likelihood for sunburn as well. The best known tanning activator is psoralen which is an ingredient of bergamot oil. Psoralen has been present in <b>sunscreens</b> {{in order to allow}} suntanning despite the reduced UV-intensity that acts on the deeper layers of the skin. In Switzerland, a ban was imposed on psoralen containing <b>sunscreens</b> in 1987 but it was loosely enforced for several years. In other countries these substances have been present in <b>sunscreens</b> until the first epidemiological results have shown that users have a fourfold risk of developing melanoma. They were finally banned in 1996. This happened more than 15 years after the photocarcinogenic potential of psoralen had been demonstrated.After the evidence for the photocarcinogenic potential of psoralen emerged, <b>sunscreens</b> which combined UVB filters and psoralen were introduced onto the market. These products were accompanied by campaigns to convince the public and the regulatory authorities that these products were safe or even better than usual <b>sunscreens.</b> These <b>sunscreens</b> were especially recommended to poor tanners.Psoralen tanning lotions were available in France, Belgium and Greece.|$|R

40|$|Reports of {{systemic}} absorption of <b>sunscreens</b> prompted {{a study of}} the effects of emulsions of 3 commonly used <b>sunscreens</b> on cultured human cells; vegetable oil and paraffin oil were used as controls. Ethylhexyl p-methoxycinnamate (EHMC), octyl p-dimethylaminobenzoate (PABA) and oxybenzone (OB) inhibited cell growth and DNA synthesis and retarded cycle progression from G 1 in the dose range 25 - 100 mu g/mL. An extended period of exposure (up to 24 h) was required for maximum uptake of <b>sunscreens</b> and for inhibition of cell growth. Melanocytes and fibroblasts tended to be more resistant than tumor cell lines (melanoma, cervical carcinoma), <b>Sunscreens</b> had no major effects on the transcription of certain genes, as judged by the activity of reporter constructs driven by the p 53, c-fos and metal response (sheep metallothionein Ia promoter) elements and transfected into a human melanoma cell line (MM 96 L). The activity of the cytomegalovirus promoter was also not affected. A cell line (CI 80 - 13 S) with mitochondrial dysfunction was significantly more sensitive to growth inhibition by EHMC and PABA than the other cell lines tested. Treatment of MM 96 L with the mitochondrial inhibitor ethidium bromide sensitized the cells to killing by cotreatment with <b>sunscreens,</b> in association with increased cellular uptake of ethidium bromide, These results established conditions for studying the action of <b>sunscreens</b> on cultured human cells. Further studies are required to determine whether the mitochondrial stress and changes in drug uptake associated with <b>sunscreens</b> in the above cell lines are relevant to their action in vivo...|$|R
