We perform a large-scale analysis of user anonymity choices during their activity on Quora, a popular question-and-answer site. We identify categories of questions for which users are more likely to exercise anonymity and explore several machine learning approaches towards predicting whether a particular answer will be written anonymously. Our findings validate the viability of the proposed approach towards an automatic assessment of <b>data</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> show that <b>data</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is a nuanced measure that should be viewed on a continuum rather than as a binary concept, and advance the idea that machine learning over behavioral data can be effectively used in order to develop product features that can help keep users safe.

40|$|A {{control chart}} is {{proposed}} for monitoring {{the capability of}} a process when <b>sensitivity</b> <b>data</b> {{is all that is}} available on a particular measure of interest, such as the threshold height at which a dropped bottle will break. <b>Sensitivity</b> <b>data</b> is data that is collected as either pass or fail of a sample at a certain level exposure to a control variable, such as drop height. Methodology is presented for selecting a certain quantile of the distribution of the measure of interest and monitoring that quantile with a standard p chart.

40|$|This paper investigates {{sources of}} {{performance}} variability in high velocity testing of automotive crash structures. Sources of variability, or so called noise factors, {{present in a}} testing environment, arise from uncertainty in structural properties, joint positions, boundary conditions and measurement system. A box structure assembly, which is representative of a crash component, is designed and fabricated from a high strength Dual Phase sheet steel. Crush tests are conducted at low and high speed. Such tests intend to validate a component model and material strain rate <b>sensitivity</b> <b>data</b> determined from high speed tensile testing. To support experimental investigations, stochastic modelling is used to investigate the effect of noise factors on crash structure performance variability, and to identify suitable performance measures to validate a component model and material strain rate <b>sensitivity</b> <b>data.</b> The results of the project will enable the measurement of more reliable strain rate <b>sensitivity</b> <b>data</b> for improved crashworthiness predictions of automotive structures...|$|E
