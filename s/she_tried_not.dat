2500|$|Discussing the {{influences}} behind the album and performances, Perri listed [...] "love" [...] as the album's major inspiration. She added that <b>she</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> {{to listen to}} any other music other her current projects to stay inspired and not get distracted. She continued, [...] "Because I write with piano or guitar, I would come in with vocals and one instrument and we'd start {{from the ground up}} and add things." [...] Additional influences of the album include Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, James Taylor, Elton John, and The Beatles. Perri [...] "mushed it all together in my brain and made Lovestrong." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> {{to look at}} him; {{the very}} sight of him filled her with horror--that blotched, gaunt face of his, the fleshy lips, that hideous bandage across his face that hid one of his eyes! <b>She</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> {{to see him and}} not to hear him laugh.|$|E
60|$|Honora was silent. <b>She</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> {{to look at}} the group, {{in which}} there were two women of very {{attractive}} appearance, and another man.|$|E
50|$|Edwards has a {{sense of}} {{regionalism}} towards the Canadian Prairies in her novels which <b>she</b> <b>tries</b> <b>not</b> to limit her appeal to the rest of Canada. Some critics say that Edwards writes in the realist tradition, just like other regional authors.|$|R
25|$|Flynn {{also says}} she is {{influenced}} by the mystery writers Laura Lippman, Karin Slaughter, George Pelecanos, Dennis Lehane, and Harlan Coben. However, <b>she</b> <b>tries</b> <b>not</b> to read any one genre exclusively, and she also admires Joyce Carol Oates, Margaret Atwood, T.C. Boyle, and Arthur Phillips, who are better known as realistic contemporary writers.|$|R
60|$|Warned by {{the example}} of her mother that American women do not grow old gracefully, <b>she</b> <b>tries</b> <b>not</b> to grow old at all and often succeeds. She has {{exquisite}} feet and hands, is always bien chaussee et bien gantee and can talk brilliantly upon any subject, provided that she knows nothing about it.|$|R
60|$|One morning, {{some two}} weeks after that evening of which <b>she</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> to think, Elizabeth, opening the door, found {{immediately}} outside it a folded scrap of paper. She unfolded it.|$|E
60|$|Tildy {{could not}} keep the {{delightful}} secret. When trade was slack she went and stood at Bogle's desk. Her eyes were shining; <b>she</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> to let her words sound proud and boastful.|$|E
60|$|At home <b>she</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> {{merely to}} keep her mother from being lonely, but {{actually}} to make her happy, to coax her {{to break into the}} formidable city. She arranged summer-evening picnics with the Sessionses.|$|E
5000|$|Child {{demonstrates}} withholding {{behavior in}} which he or <b>she</b> actively <b>tries</b> <b>not</b> to pass a bowel movement.|$|R
50|$|Shanmugham has {{a friend}} Giri (Vishnupriyan), {{who is also}} a rowdy, but gets him married to a nice girl Gauri (Mallika). She wants to {{separate}} him from this rowdy group and get settled, for which <b>she</b> <b>tries</b> <b>not</b> to send him for their encounters. After much thought, Shanmugham lets them go separately, but Murugavel kills Giri in an encounter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I never!" [...] <b>she</b> exclaimed, <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> to {{show that}} she guessed his errand. [...] "Fancy you here at this time o' morning!" ...|$|R
60|$|Daisy {{accepted}} passively the tokens of affection, with {{a little}} sad smile. <b>She</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> to be unsympathetic. Mrs Griffith led her daughter into the sitting-room where George and Edith were sitting. George was very white.|$|E
60|$|He {{knew that}} she did, and the words had no serious intent; but she was surcharged with emotion, and winced like a wounded animal. Though <b>she</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> to shed tears, she could not help showing one or two.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> to hate Déroulède. She {{wished to}} judge him coldly and impartially, or rather to indict {{him before the}} throne of God, and to punish him for the crime he had {{commited}} ten years ago. Her personal feelings must remain out of the question.|$|E
5000|$|Megumi Katagiri (Katagiri Megumi) : A {{reserved}} and precocious girl. Because <b>she</b> <b>tries</b> hard <b>not</b> {{to display}} her feelings, she {{is hard to}} read. CV:Yuria Hokuto ...|$|R
500|$|Lane is also {{involved}} in several charities, including Heifer International, which focuses on world hunger, and Artists for Peace and Justice, a Hollywood organization that supports Haiti relief. However, <b>she</b> <b>tries</b> <b>not</b> {{to draw attention to}} her humanitarian efforts: [...] "Sometimes I give with my heart. Sometimes I give financially, but there's something about [...] that I think ought to be anonymous. I don't want it to be a boastful thing." ...|$|R
5000|$|Yoru Kazato (Kazato Yoru): Yoru is Asa's twin. She has a cool {{personality}} and is rather indifferent about others {{with her head}} up in the clouds. <b>She</b> <b>tries</b> <b>not</b> to become close to others but is emotionally attached to her twin. Because she is a genius and does not like doing pointless things, she is rather pessimistic {{in regards to the}} Soaring Club. Their grandfather is the chairman of Keifuu Academy[...]|$|R
60|$|Little Dorrit {{could not}} gainsay it. <b>She</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> to show it, but she recoiled with dread {{from the state}} of mind that had burnt so {{fiercely}} and lasted so long. It presented itself to her, with no sophistry upon it, in its own plain nature.|$|E
60|$|At {{the office}} Una was {{transferred}} to S. Herbert Ross's department, upon Walter's leaving. She sometimes took S. Herbert's majestic, flowing dictation. <b>She</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> merely to obey his instructions, but also to discover his unvoiced wishes. Her wage was raised from eight dollars a week to ten. She again determined {{to be a real}} business woman. She read a small manual on advertising.|$|E
60|$|She {{remained}} {{in her room}} much longer than {{she thought it would}} have taken her aunt to explain what she had to say. At last, however, she heard footsteps in the corridor, and Griffiths knocked at the door. Her aunt would be obliged by her stepping into her room. <b>She</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> to look disconcerted, and asked if Lord Cashel were still there. She was told that he was; and she felt that she had to muster up all her courage to encounter him.|$|E
6000|$|... (<b>She</b> <b>tries</b> hard <b>not</b> to smile, but {{she smiles}} and he smiles, and they make comic faces at each other, as they have done in similar {{circumstances}} since she first opened her eyes.) ...|$|R
60|$|Catherine {{turns her}} face {{from him to}} the Court. The courtiers see that <b>she</b> is <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> to laugh, and know by {{experience}} that she will not succeed. They rise, relieved and grinning.|$|R
60|$|He stopped. He {{could not}} go on. The {{possibility}} that anything of the sort could happen had never crossed his mind. Then he saw that her lips were trembling, and <b>she</b> was <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> to cry.|$|R
60|$|What I {{have just}} said are Caroline's {{ideas of the}} pair. She felt what has just been described. In thus feeling <b>she</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> to suffer, but {{suffered}} sharply nevertheless. She suffered, indeed, miserably. A few minutes before her famished heart had tasted a drop and crumb of nourishment, that, if freely given, would have brought back abundance of life where life was failing; but the generous feast was snatched from her, spread before another, and she remained but a bystander at the banquet.|$|E
60|$|Kapus Benkó, in his invalid's chair, sat some {{distance}} away from his daughter, {{the other side of}} Klara Goldstein. Elsa could not even exchange glances with him or see whether he had everything he wanted. Thus she seemed cut off from everyone she cared for; only Andor was near her, and of Andor she must not even think. <b>She</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> to meet his gaze, tried hard not to feel a thrill of pleasure every time that she became actively conscious of his presence beside her.|$|E
60|$|Some of {{the girls}} still nodded amiably, but never invited her to visit them; others merely dropped their eyelids, and went by without speaking, while a good many ignored her as entirely {{as if she had}} been invisible. These things hurt Polly more than she would confess, for at home every one worked, and every one was {{respected}} for it. <b>She</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> to care, but girls feel little slights keenly, and more than once Polly was severely tempted to give up her plan, and run away to the safe shelter at home.|$|E
5000|$|The lady {{in orange}} {{discusses}} {{a relationship that}} left her heartbroken. She says that ever since she realized that someone would call a [...] "colored girl an evil woman a bitch or a nag," [...] (56) <b>she</b> has <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> to be that person. <b>She</b> <b>tries</b> and <b>not</b> only give joy, but receive it as well. She finds herself in what she believes {{to be a real}} and honest relationship. Yet, the guy keeps going back to his ex-lover. The lady in orange tried to move on by finding another lover, but she wasn't satisfied. <b>She</b> <b>tried</b> to avoid sadness, but she found herself heartbroken by this man. She could not stand being [...] "sorry & colored at the same time / it’s so redundant in the modern world".|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> would <b>try</b> <b>not</b> to {{show her}} weariness, the nervous strain of these two men's {{antagonism}} around her person which {{was the cause of}} her languid attitudes. For {{as a matter of fact}} the sea agreed with her.|$|R
5000|$|Claudia begins {{accompanying}} Warehouse Agents on missions from Season 2's [...] "Mild Mannered", {{although her}} first official mission, as Warehouse Apprentice, is in [...] "For the Team". At first she attempts {{to be more}} mature and business-like in her approach to being an agent, but soon realizes that she is more effective just being herself. During the time that Myka leaves the Warehouse, Claudia apparently steps up to full-time agent status alongside Pete and Artie. With the addition of Steve Jinks to the Warehouse, Claudia is partnered with him and has seniority over him (a fact <b>she</b> <b>tries</b> <b>not</b> to let Jinks forget).|$|R
60|$|Still {{there was}} no one else, and with her usual {{determination}} she forced her well-schooled mind to dismiss all those thoughts of her husband which were disparaging to him. <b>She</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> to see him as she had done a little while ago, giving himself over so readily to the artificial life of this Court of Versailles and its enervating etiquette, yielding to the whispered flatteries of Irène de Stainville, pandering to her vanity, admiring her femininity no doubt in direct contrast to his wife's more robust individuality.|$|E
60|$|In the meantime, Grace {{walked home}} {{thinking}} hard. Kit was Railton's friend, {{but he had}} used some tact, until she forced him {{to tell her the}} truth. This, however, was not important, because she had got a jar. It looked as if Osborn had consented to a cruel plot; a landlord ought to help his tenants and not take advantage of their need. <b>She</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> to blame him; he had a bad agent, who used a dangerous influence. She must try to protect him from the fellow and, in a way, from his own carelessness.|$|E
60|$|No {{sooner had}} the {{visitors}} departed {{than the others}} now out of quarantine appeared at Vale Leston. Angela was anxious to {{spend a little time}} there, and likewise to have Lena overhauled by Tom May. The child had never really recovered, and was always weakly; and whereas on the journey, Lily, now in high health, was delighted with all she saw, though she could not compare Penbeacon to Adam's Peak, Lena lay back in Sister Angela's arms, almost a dead weight, hardly enduring the bustle of the train, though <b>she</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> to whine, as long as she saw her pink Ben looking happy in his cage.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him at last, with a long silent gaze, which, {{in spite of her}} pride and her resolution, uttered part of the appeal <b>she</b> had <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> to make. Her father's cold grey eye sounded her own, and he insisted on his point.|$|R
60|$|But Elsa stood quite still. <b>She</b> did <b>not</b> <b>try</b> to {{run after}} the train.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> did <b>not</b> <b>try</b> to {{draw out}} Fern's story; Fern insisted on telling it.|$|R
