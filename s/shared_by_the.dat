5|$|A thick-line {{version of}} the map, {{released}} as part of Metro's Rush Plus plan, showed the Silver Line spurring off the Orange Line between the Ballston and East Falls Church stations in a northwesterly direction, with five unlabeled stops (the Phase I stations). The final map released for the Silver Line's Phase I opening features the stations <b>shared</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> three lines as normal stations, with the dots signifying stations located on the colored line {{in the center and}} small white stubs extending from the center dots into the adjoining colored lines.|$|E
5|$|Additional common {{features}} are <b>shared</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> palaces of Pylos, Mycenae and Tiryns; a large court with colonnades lies {{directly in front}} of the central megaron, while a second, but smaller, megaron is also found inside these structures. The staircases in the palace of Pylos indicate that the palaces had two stories. The private quarters of the members of the royal family were presumably located on the second floor.|$|E

5|$|American {{alligators}} {{have been}} documented using lures to hunt prey such as birds. This means {{they are among the}} first reptiles recorded to use tools. By balancing sticks and branches on their heads, American alligators are able to lure birds looking for suitable nesting material to kill and consume. This strategy, which is <b>shared</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> mugger crocodile, is particularly effective during the nesting season, in which birds are more likely to gather appropriate nesting materials.|$|E
5|$|Because {{feathers}} {{are often}} associated with birds, feathered dinosaurs are often touted as the missing link between birds and dinosaurs. However, the multiple skeletal features also <b>shared</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> two groups represent another important line of evidence for paleontologists. Areas of the skeleton with important similarities include the neck, pubis, wrist (semi-lunate carpal), arm and pectoral girdle, furcula (wishbone), and breast bone. Comparison of bird and dinosaur skeletons through cladistic analysis strengthens {{the case for the}} link.|$|E
5|$|Covalent bonding {{takes place}} {{when one of}} the {{constituent}} atoms loses one or more electrons, with the other atom gaining the electrons, resulting in an electron cloud that is <b>shared</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> molecule as a whole. In both ionic and covalent bonding the location of the ions and electrons are constrained relative to each other, thereby resulting in the bond being characteristically brittle.|$|E

In the end, the rival MiG-29K was opted for, because of the Su-33's outdated avionics. The size of the Su-33 reportedly led to concerns over potential difficulties in operating it off the Indian carriers, a constraint not <b>shared</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> smaller MiG-29K.|$|E

5|$|Metallic bonding can be {{classified}} {{as a type of}} covalent bonding for which the constituent atoms of the same type and do not combine with one another to form a chemical bond. Atoms will lose an electron(s) forming an array of positive ions. These electrons are <b>shared</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> lattice which makes the electron cluster mobile, as the electrons are free to move as well as the ions. For this, it gives metals their relatively high thermal and electrical conductivity as well as being characteristically ductile.|$|E

The leader in Catania, De Felice, also maintained contact with leading anarchists like Amilcare Cipriani. On these and other important issues there was much friction between Catania and Palermo.|$|E
