40|$|This study {{established}} the cumulative incidence per season of ball carrier <b>spearing</b> and concurrent defensive <b>spearing</b> by tacklers on a New Jersey {{high school football}} team. <b>Spearing,</b> which involves flexing the neck and initiating contact with {{the top of the}} helmet, is a significant cause of injury to the head and neck of a football player. To reduce the risk of head and neck injuries in football, all avenues of <b>spearing</b> must be explored. Nine game films from the 1989 football season were reviewed to determine the incidence of ball carrier <b>spearing</b> and concurrent defensive <b>spearing.</b> There were 167 incidents of ball carrier <b>spearing</b> (1 per 5. 1 plays) and 72 incidents of concurrent defensive <b>spearing</b> (1 per 2. 3 ball carrier <b>spears),</b> although no <b>spearing</b> penalties were called. This study detected a surprisingly high cumulative incidence of ball carrier <b>spearing</b> and concurrent defensive <b>spearing,</b> along with poor enforcement of the rule banning <b>spearing...</b>|$|R

5|$|Bliege Bird et al. {{observed}} turtle {{hunting and}} <b>spear</b> fishing patterns in a Meriam {{community in the}} Torres Strait of Australia, publishing their findings in 2001. Here, only some Meriam men were able to accumulate high caloric gains {{for the amount of}} time spent turtle hunting or <b>spear</b> fishing (reaching a threshold measured in kcal/h). Since a daily catch of fish is carried home by hand and turtles are frequently served at large feasts, members of the community know which men most reliably brought them turtle meat and fish. Thus, turtle hunting qualifies as a costly signal. Furthermore, turtle hunting and <b>spear</b> fishing are actually less productive (in kcal/h) than foraging for shellfish, where success depends only on the amount of time dedicated to searching, so shellfish foraging is a poor signal of skill or strength. This suggests that energetic gains are not the primary reason men take part in turtle hunting and <b>spear</b> fishing. A follow-up study found that successful Meriam hunters do experience greater social benefits and reproductive success than less skilled hunters.|$|E
