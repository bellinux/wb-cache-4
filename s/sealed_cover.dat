5000|$|When {{there is}} {{occasion}} to procure a dispensation that exceeds {{the powers of}} the ordinary, or when there are special reasons for direct recourse to the Holy See, procedure is by way of supplica (petition) and private rescript. The supplica need not necessarily be drawn up by the petitioner, nor even at his instance; it does not, however, become valid until he accepts it. Although, since the Constitution [...] "Sapienti", all the faithful may have direct recourse to the Roman Congregations, the supplica is usually forwarded through the ordinary (of the person's birthplace or domicile, or since the Decree [...] "Ne temere" [...] the residence of one of the petitioners), who transmits it to the proper Congregation either by letter or through his accredited agent; but if there is question of sacramental secrecy, it is sent directly to the Penitentiaria, or handed to the bishop's agent under a <b>sealed</b> <b>cover</b> for transmission to the Penitentiaria. The supplica ought to give the names (family and Christian) of the petitioners (except in secret cases forwarded to the Penitentiaria), the name of the Ordinary forwarding it, or the name of the priest to whom, in secret cases, the rescript must be sent; the age of the parties, especially in dispensations affecting consanguinity and affinity; their religion, at 1east when one of them is not a Catholic; the nature, degree and number of all impediments (if recourse is had to the Congregatio de Disciplinâ Sacramentorum or to the Holy Office in a public impediment, and to the Penitentiaria {{at the same time in}} a secret one, it is necessary that the latter should know of the public impediment and that recourse has been had to the competent Congregation). The supplica must also contain the causes set forth for granting the dispensation and other circumstances specified in the Propaganda Fide Instruction of 9 May 1877 (it is no longer necessary, either for the validity or liceity of the dispensation, to observe the paragraph relating to incestuous intercourse, even when probably this very thing had been alleged as the only reason for granting the dispensation). When there is question of consanguinity in the second degree bordering on the first, the supplica ought to be written by the bishop's own hand. He ought also to sign the declaration of poverty made by the petitioners when the dispensation is sought from the Penitentiaria in formâ pauperum; when he is in any way hindered from so doing he is bound to commission a priest to sign it in his name. A false declaration of poverty henceforth does not invalidate a dispensation in any case; but the authors of the false statement are bound in conscience to reimburse any amount unduly withheld (regulation for the Roman Curia of 12 June 1908). For further information on the many points already briefly described see the special canonical works, wherein are found all necessary directions as to what must be expressed so as to avoid nullity. When a supplica is affected (in a material point) by obreption or subreption it becomes necessary to ask for a so-called [...] "reformatory decree" [...] in case the favour asked has not yet been granted by the Curia, or for the letters known as [...] "Perinde ac valere" [...] if the favour has already been granted. If after all this a further material error is discovered, letters known as [...] "Perinde ac valere super perinde ac valere" [...] must be applied for.|$|E

40|$|Today, {{the phase}} {{shifting}} technique {{is still the}} fastest and most accurate measurement method for laser scanners in the meter and some 10 meters range. A major handicap for outdoor applications such as railway measurement systems is the influence of optical cross talk caused by pollution of the optical surfaces.

It is shown that optical cross talk is a major cause for nonlinearities when dark objects are measured. To overcome this disadvantage a <b>sealed</b> <b>cover</b> with light traps was designed for a 350 degree scanner to protect the most critical surface of the scan mirror and to absorb the stray light from the polluted outer surfaces. The sampling rate of this system can be doubled without loss of measurement accuracy by using a new scan geometry with two fibre coupled measurement heads on each end of a hollow scan axis with a double sided scan mirror...|$|E

40|$|Aims: Although the {{long-term}} outcomes of hypospadias surgery are considered important for psychosexual development, {{only a few}} {{attempts have been made}} to evaluate patient psico-pathology. Material and Methods: 20 out 40 patients who received under <b>sealed</b> <b>cover</b> two envelopes - the first containing the assessment tools, the other empty and prepaid for the answer – joined the study. The results came from the analysis of anamnestic interview specially created in order to gather information on how to access to surgery and the degree of information that the parents had from the surgeon, from the analysis of the CBCL (Child Behavior CheckList 2001 : 4 - 16 years) and TMA (Multidimensional self-esteem Test: the Italian version of the MSCS Multidimensional Self-Concept Scale). Of the 20 patients recruited, 15, aged from 9 to 18 years (mean age 12. 5), age at operation between 2 and 5 years (mean age 3. 3 yrs), have returned the questionnaires correctly compiled. Patient data were compared with those of a control group not suffering from genital pathology. Results: From the CBCL: the area of the identification of the problems showed no significant differences between the study group and the control. The area of competence, altered in both groups, did not show statistically significant differences. From the analysis of TMA: there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in sub-domains: Social, Competence, Affect, Family and Physical. Within the subdomain school the two groups differed significantly for low self-esteem in the group of surgical patients. Conclusion: The MST test indicate that hypospadias surgery does not change the global self-esteem but, surprisingly, at least in this patient population, only a lower self-esteem in school performance in the age group considered. This study may indicate the importance of psychological support during the transition from adolescence to adulthood...|$|E
