An example of an interference analysis between two systems is fully carried out. The paper also points out the inherent problems when comparing systems with different access schemes.

In this paper, we propose to use the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) as a unifying criterion, and to share resources so as to keep the MOS of the various flows above an acceptable threshold whenever possible. We present four different resource sharing policies: Preemptive, Non-preemptive, MOS-driven Fairness and Revenue Optimization. We analyze the different approaches through simulation, comparing their performance in terms of end-user Quality of Experience and revenue. Our results show that our scheme reacts to the changing traffic scenarios so as to achieve the pre-specified objective, thus achieving an effective exploitation of the limited bandwidth resources...|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we provide a novel {{characterization}} of the proportionally fair bandwidth allocation of network capacities, {{in terms of the}} Fenchel– Legendre transform of the network capacity region. We use this characterization to prove stability (i. e., ergodicity) of network dynamics under proportionally fair sharing, by exhibiting a suitable Lyapunov function. Our stability result extends previously known results to a more general model including Markovian users routing. In particular, it implies that the stability condition previously known under exponential service time distributions remains valid under so-called phase-type service time distributions. We then exhibit a modification of proportional fairness, which coincides with it in some asymptotic sense, is reversible (and thus insensitive), and has explicit stationary distribution. Finally we show that the stationary distributions under modified proportional fairness and balanced fairness, a <b>sharing</b> <b>criterion</b> proposed because of its insensitivity properties, admit the same large deviations characteristics. These results show that proportional fairness is an attractive bandwidth allocation criterion, combining the desirable properties of ease of implementation with performance and insensitivity...|$|E

Three different criteria were also made available through the three studies: equivalent to a private pilot’s license (PPL) course via the RAF UAS, basic training success for Chile (representing 84 hours of flight), and flying screening success for Italy and Portugal (representing a total of 18 missions for Italy and 7 missions for Portugal).
