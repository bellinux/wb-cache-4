5|$|Lenis {{stops in}} Wagiman <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> English voiced stops and are {{therefore}} written using the Roman alphabet letters b, d and g. Fortis stops, however, sound more like voiceless stops in English, but are slightly longer than lenis stops. They are written with two voiceless letters, pp, tt and kk when they occur between two vowels.|$|E
5|$|Outside the Final Fantasy franchise, Lightning {{features}} in a minigame in , {{was part of}} a collaboration between the Final Fantasy series and Puzzle & Dragons alongside other established series characters, and versions of her outfit from XIII may be worn by protagonist Aya Brea in The 3rd Birthday and a character from arcade shooter Gunslinger Stratos 2. Maaya Sakamoto, who portrays both Aya and Lightning, voiced Aya to <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> Lightning when the outfit is equipped.|$|E
5000|$|... {{homonyms}} for unpleasant topics (examples: [...] "clock" [...] <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> [...] "the funeral ritual", green hats because [...] "wear a green hat" [...] <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> [...] "cuckold", [...] "handkerchief" [...] <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> [...] "goodbye", [...] "pear" [...] <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> [...] "separate", and [...] "umbrella" [...] <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> [...] "disperse").|$|R

5|$|The game {{uses the}} visual effect of {{applying}} pre-rendered video footage to a polygon, specifically the game's pre-recorded {{shows on the}} television. IGN writer Anoop Gantayat praised this effect's implementation, although he did note some minor graphical issues visible in the transition from distanced to full-screen viewing. Also unusual for the Pokémon video game series, the Pokémon's voices are borrowed from the anime and <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> their names.|$|E
5|$|The idea {{going in}} was to {{juxtapose}} my singing style with a hardcore hip-hop sensibility {{and have the}} finished product still <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a Madonna record. I began the process by meeting with the hip-hop producers whose work I most admired. It was important, if I were to {{use a variety of}} collaborators, that the end product sound cohesive and thematically whole. I wasn't interested in the variety pack approach.|$|E
5|$|The shells {{are made}} of cast iron, {{as large as a}} bowl and shaped like a ball. Inside they contain half a pound of 'magic' gunpowder. They are sent flying towards the enemy camp from an eruptor; and when they get there a <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a thunder-clap is heard, and flashes of light appear. If ten of these shells are fired {{successfully}} into the enemy camp, the whole place will be set ablaze...|$|E

5|$|Tinnitus is {{the hearing}} of sound when no {{external}} sound is present. While {{often described as}} a ringing, it may also <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a clicking, hiss or roaring. Rarely, unclear voices or music are heard. The sound may be soft or loud, low pitched or high pitched and appear {{to be coming from}} one ear or both. Most of the time, it comes on gradually. In some people, the sound causes depression, anxiety, or concentration difficulties.|$|E
5|$|Voice casting was {{managed by}} Kris Zimmerman, who chose voice actors {{that seemed to}} suit certain roles: the Matoran were voiced by young adults, while the Turaga were voiced by older actors. The voice actors and their {{performances}} were chosen so they would not <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> they came from a specific area of the world, instead <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> they came from and belonged in the Bionicle universe. A notable event during recording was a behind-the-scenes incident between Michas and Francis: originally cast in the respective roles of Jaller and Takua, Michas came into a recording session in a muddled state and began reading Takua's lines by mistake. When Francis came in, he read Jaller's lines: when the staff heard them and were favourably impressed, the actors permanently switched roles. Voice acting for the project was mostly done in 2002, but dialogue was re-recorded during Additional Dialogue Recording (ADR) into 2003: approximately 30% of the final film's dialogue was done during ADR. Audio and music post-production was handled by Hacienda Post. The company's president Tim Borquez served as sound supervisor. Mask of Light {{was the first time}} in any media that Bionicle characters spoke.|$|E
5|$|When {{writing for}} Vince the writers blanked {{out all of}} the {{characters}} swearing like it is done on the show, {{but when it came to}} recording the programme the swear words had to be put in for Kaye to read them. During read-throughs of the scripts, a toy horn was honked whenever Kaye swore to give an idea of what it would <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> during the programme.|$|E
5000|$|The number 7 (七, [...] ) in Mandarin <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> [...] "even" [...] in Mandarin (齊, [...] ), {{so it is}} a {{good number}} for relationships. It also <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> [...] "arise" [...] (起, [...] ) and [...] "life essence" [...] (氣, [...] ) in Mandarin.Seven can also be {{considered}} an unlucky number since the 7th month (July) is a [...] "ghost month". It also <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> [...] "to deceive" [...] (欺, [...] ) in Mandarin.In Cantonese, 7 (...) <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> 𨳍 (...) , which is a vuger word of saying [...] "penis".|$|R

5|$|A noisy species, {{the female}} has the deep quack stereotypically {{associated}} with ducks. Male mallards {{make a sound}} phonetically {{similar to that of}} the female, a typical quack, but it is a deep and raspy and can also <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> breeeeze. When incubating a nest, or when offspring are present, females vocalise differently, making a call that sounds like a truncated version of the usual quack. They hiss if the nest or offspring are threatened or interfered with. When taking off, the wings of a mallard produce a characteristic faint whistling noise.|$|E
5|$|Bond later {{scales the}} walls to the Whyte House's top floor to confront Whyte. He is instead met by two {{identical}} Blofelds, who use an electronic device to <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> Whyte. Bond kills one of the Blofelds, {{which turns out to}} be a look-alike. The real Blofeld pulls a gun on Bond, and instructs him into a elevator, where he is knocked out by gas. He is picked up by Wint and Kidd, and taken out to Las Vegas Valley, where he is placed in a pipeline and left to die. The pipeline is buried the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Chris Brandkamp {{produced}} most of {{the ambient}} and incidental sounds in the game. To make sure the sounds fit, Brandkamp {{had to wait until}} the game's visuals were placed in context. Sound effects were drawn from unlikely sources; the noise of a fire in a boiler was created by driving slowly over stones in a driveway, because recordings of actual fire did not <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> fire burning. The chimes of a large clock tower were simulated using a wrench, then transposed to a lower pitch.|$|E
5000|$|... 48: Any 3 digit {{numbers that}} ends with 48 <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> [...] "wealthy for X lifetimes", for example, 748 (...) <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> [...] "七世發" [...] (...) meaning [...] "wealthy for 7 lifetimes".|$|R
5000|$|... {{is raised}} to [...] (so cattle <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> kettle); [...] is raised to [...] (so that mess <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> miss); and, most prominently, [...] is raised to [...] (so fish <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> feesh). This mirrors {{the second and}} third stages of the Southern Vowel Shift (see under [...] "Newer phonology"), despite this {{particular}} accent never participating in the very first stage of the shift.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oho! A talking goat, do you say? That {{certainly}} <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> magic; {{and it also}} <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> the Land of Oz, {{where all}} the animals talk," [...] said Kaliko, with a doubtful expression.|$|R
5|$|Designed to <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a 1980s record, Love. Angel. Music. Baby. was {{influenced}} by artists such as the Cure, Depeche Mode, Cyndi Lauper and Madonna. The album incorporates a diverse range of genres, including electropop, dance-rock, new wave, R, hip hop, soul, and disco, while lyrically, most of its songs are about fashion and wealth. Promotion of the album included the release of six commercially successful singles and the North American Harajuku Lovers concert tour. While promoting, Stefani was often accompanied by back-up dancers called the Harajuku Girls.|$|E
5|$|George Holdcroft {{composed}} the score for The FP. He {{was invited to}} a screening of the film by producer Christian Agypt, {{and asked if he}} could compose the music for it. Holdcroft, who lived in Chicago at the time, spent 12 hours a day composing the score and e-mailed his compositions to the Trost brothers. To emulate the sound of a choir for one song, Holdcroft sang the same segment more than 200 times using different voices and melodies to achieve the desired result. For another song, he sang in falsetto and altered the pitch of his voice to make himself <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a woman.|$|E
5|$|Heartstrings, {{like the}} first record, was very much {{influenced}} by film, and is recognized for its cinematic quality. Juanita indicated that they deliberately made the album to <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a soundtrack to a movie. Howling Bells along with the production team watched Paris, Texas and Blue Velvet, {{in an effort to}} replicate the mood, emotion, and atmosphere of these two films in particular. Other films that {{played a significant role in}} the making of Heartstrings include, Badlands, Bonnie and Clyde, Klute, , Nashville, Pleasantville, The Last Picture Show, and Vivre sa vie.|$|E
5000|$|Bel: [...] "this Emperor's Voice thing <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> {{something}} out of a fairy tale, to me. Until I got to the fine print. Then it <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> {{something out}} of a really gruesome fairy tale." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "This <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> an old ska tune by Prince Buster. I think it's good fun, but I would {{probably}} not miss it if it mysteriously fell off the album and something else which <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> Prince Buster popped up instead. 3/5".|$|R
5000|$|It has a loud stride whistle {{that sounds}} double-syllabled and <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> [...] "sweee weee." [...] When under stress, it {{releases}} a lowering series of whistles that <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> [...] "swee wee wee wee" [...] along with fast paced wing sounds.|$|R
5|$|This {{species at}} its {{breeding}} sites gives a long mournful call like the hooting of a tawny owl, {{and a much}} less frequent <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> the whimpering of a pup. It is silent at sea. The breeding calls {{are very similar to}} those of Fea's petrel, and Bretagnolle's analysis of the calls of the soft-plumaged petrel complex led him to suggest in 1995 only a two-way species split, with the northern forms madeira, feae and deserti all as subspecies of Fea's petrel.|$|E
5|$|The 19-year-old Geoff Emerick was {{promoted}} to replace Norman Smith as engineer on the first session for the Revolver album. This started at 8pm on 6 April 1966, in Studio Three at Abbey Road. Lennon told producer Martin {{that he wanted to}} <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a hundred chanting Tibetan monks, which left Martin the difficult task of trying to find the effect by using the basic equipment they had. The effect was achieved by using a Leslie speaker. When the concept was explained to Lennon, he inquired if the same effect could be achieved by hanging him upside down and spinning him around a microphone while he sang into it. Emerick made a connector to break into the electronic circuitry of the cabinet and then re-recorded the vocal as it came out of the revolving speaker.|$|E
5|$|The {{localization}} {{was done}} by the philosophy of keeping true to the spirit of the original Japanese, making dialogue <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> what a native speaker of English would say instead of strictly adhering the original's exact wording. The localization editor, Ben Bateman, did this by looking at the writing from a wider view, line by line or scene by scene rather than word by word or sentence by sentence, and thinking about how to convey the same ideas in English. Most parts of the game that include a joke in the localization also have a joke in the Japanese version, but a different one; Bateman did however try to make similar types of jokes, with similar contents and ideas. The game's use of Japanese language puns led to problems, as many of them relied on Japanese dialects to function; for these, Bateman replaced them with new puns in English. He was given mostly free rein in what he could change or add, as long as it did not disrupt the plot.|$|E
5000|$|The number 6 (六, [...] ) in Mandarin <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> [...] "to flow" [...] (流, [...] ), {{therefore}} six {{is considered}} a good number for business. But in Cantonese, 6 (...) <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> [...] "to go down" [...] or [...] "decline" [...] (落, [...] ).|$|R

[...] —Minaj describing the concept behind [...] "Pills n Potions". Minaj first mentioned the song in her promo single, [...] "Yasss Bish" [...] which features Soulja Boy. She stated that the single would be released in two weeks. She revealed the title of the song at the 2014 Billboard Music Awards and afterwards hosted a Q&A on Twitter where she revealed information regarding the single. In an interview for Rap-Up, she stated that [...] "Pills n Potions" [...] was [...] "uplifting" [...] and [...] "very soulful". Speaking to Billboard, she explained: [...] "It <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> urgency, It <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> betrayal. It <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> running. It <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> fainting. It <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> love. It <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> - *gasp!*" [...] On May 19, 2014, Minaj revealed the single's cover art on Instagram.|$|R
