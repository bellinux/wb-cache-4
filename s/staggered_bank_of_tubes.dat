One of the most cost-effective ways of improving the efficiency of a high pressure steam boiler is to install an economizer on the boiler. An economizer is a heat exchanger, which transfers heat from the stack gases to the incoming feedwater. Typically, on a high pressure water tube boiler, the efficiency improvement with an economizer is 2 to 4 %, depending on firing rate. On a high pressure fire tube boiler, the improvement is 2 to 3. 5 %, depending on boiler size and firing rate. The economizers are located in the boiler stack close to the stack gas outlet of the boiler. They may be supported from overhead or from the floor. A feedwater line, which serves the boiler, is piped to the unit. No additional feedwater control valves or stack gas dampers are required. Presently in NTPC stage II units there are <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>tubes</b> in economizer.

25|$|The Thornycroft boiler is {{a variant}} that splits the usual central furnace into two. There are four drums: two main drums {{vertically}} in the centre – a steam and a water drum – also two wing drums {{at the outside}} edges of the furnace. The design was notable for its early use of the water-wall furnace. The outer <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>tubes</b> was shallow, consisting of only two rows <b>of</b> <b>tubes.</b> These rows were spaced closely, so that the tubes formed a solid wall, without gasflow between them. The inner <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>tubes</b> was similar: the two rows <b>of</b> <b>tubes</b> closest to the furnace formed a similar water wall. These tubes were splayed apart at their base, so as to provide space for gasflow between them. Within the tube bank, gas flow is mostly parallel to the tubes, similar to some early designs, but contrary to the crossflow design of later three-drum boilers. The exhaust gas emerged into the heart-shaped space below the upper central drum, exiting to the funnel through the rear wall.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a frost numerical model for predicting the frosting behavior {{in terms of}} the correlation of the heat transfer coefficient, Nusselt number. In this work the correlations of the Nusselt number from various references is examined and compared with experimental data. In this study, a mathematical model that can predict the behavior of the frost growth on a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> triangularly arranged <b>tubes</b> is developed. Because of the complex heat transfer during frost formation on a tube bank, this subject is receiving much attention.

40|$|The {{most part}} of energy losses in heat & power system {{is due to}} the heat {{released}} by the exhaust gas to atmosphere. The exhaust gas consists of non-condensable gas and steam with sensible and latent heat. As a lot of latent heat is included in the exhaust gas, its recovery is very important to improve the system efficiency. Based on the previous basic studies, a thermal hydraulic prediction method for latent heat recovery exchangers was proposed. Two kinds of compact heat exchanger with <b>staggered</b> <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> large and small diameter tubes were designed and fabricated based on the prediction method. In the calculations varying the various parameters, approximately the same heat recovery rate was obtained with both the heat exchangers. The more compactness was obtained with the small tubes at a desired heat recovery rate. The pressure loss in gas side was slightly smaller and that in water side was significantly larger incase <b>of</b> the small <b>tube.</b> By adapting the single header instead of conventional multi header, the pressure loss in the water side could be significantly reduced but the reduction rate of heat recovery was only between 40 to 10 %...|$|R

40|$|Heat {{exchangers}} are {{devices in}} which heat {{is transferred from}} one fluid to another at different temperatures with wide applications in many field of engineering such as power generation, chemical processing, electronics cooling, automotive, refrigeration and air-conditioning. They are classified typically according to type operation, construction and flow arrangement into shell-and-tube, double-pipe, compact, cross-flow, etc. The heat transfer from <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>tubes</b> depends on geometric arrangement, Reynolds number and the position <b>of</b> <b>tube</b> in the <b>bank.</b> However, {{the determination of the}} number <b>of</b> <b>tube</b> rows required to enhance heat transfer {{has been one of the}} major challenge in exchanger design.

A multi-row <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>tubes</b> could provide adequate heating area, without this complexity. Tubes also became straighter, mostly to ease their cleaning. Yarrow had demonstrated that straight tubes did not cause any problems with expansion, but circular drums and perpendicular tube entry were both valuable features for a long service life. Where tubes entered drums at an angle, heating and cooling tended to bend the tube back and forth, leading to leaks. A perpendicular entry was easier to expand the tubes for a reliable seal and to avoid these sideways stresses. It was worth the compromise of the Admiralty boiler's bent tube ends to keep these two features, and these tubes were still simple enough in shape to clean easily.|$|R
