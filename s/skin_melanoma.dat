40|$|Abstract: The {{major role}} of 24 -hydroxylase (CYP 24 A 1) is to {{maintain}} 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 (1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3) homeostasis. Recently, it has been discovered that CYP 24 A 1 also catalyses the hydroxylation of 20 (OH) D 3, producing dihydroxy-derivatives that show very effective antitumorigenic activities. Previously we showed a negative correlation of vitamin D receptor (VDR) and CYP 27 B 1 expression with progression, aggressiveness and overall or disease-free survivals of <b>skin</b> <b>melanomas.</b> Therefore, we analyzed CYP 24 A 1 expression in relation to clinicopathomorphological features of nevi, <b>skin</b> <b>melanomas</b> and metastases.

40|$|Background. Cutaneous {{melanoma}} is {{an aggressive}} form of skin cancer. It {{has become an}} increasingly common neoplasm in the most developed countries, especially among individuals of European origin. Patients and methods. Anonymous data of patients with cutaneous melanoma were collected from the diagnostic database of the University Hospital of Trieste from 1 January 1990 to 10 December 2013. Our study {{is based on a}} population which was constant over the period of observation; it was also well-defined and characterised by unrestrained sun exposure. Results. The number of cutaneous melanomas increased during the period of observation with a seasonality trend and gender related differences both for anatomical sites distribution and stage of the disease. Moreover, 6 % of our cohort developed multiple melanomas. Conclusions. In a well-defined population devoted to excessive sun exposure the frequencies of <b>skin</b> <b>melanomas</b> roughly doubled from 1990 to 2013 following a seasonal trend. In that population, prevention efforts according to gender specific risk behaviour, as well as follow-up programmes both for evaluation of metastatic spreading and for early diagnosis of additional <b>skin</b> <b>melanomas,</b> are crucial due to gender specific differences and to the occurrence of multiple melanomas. © 2015 Serena Bonin et al., published by De Gruyter Open...|$|R

40|$|Background: In many tumors {{and also}} in melanomas a high {{expression}} of different growth factor receptors is sometimes present, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr) and oncogene c-erbB 2 are often involved. Recently a tumor suppressor gene, called MTS 1, has been identified. MTS 1 may have an important function in many tumors {{like those of the}} lung, breast, bone, ovary and <b>skin</b> <b>melanomas.</b> Objectives: In our study we analyzed the expression at mRNA level of EGFr, c-erbB 2 and MTS 1 in biopsied paraffin-embedded tissues of <b>skin</b> <b>melanomas</b> at different stages of Breslow and according to {{the presence or absence of}} metastatic spreading during follow-up. Methods: The relative quantitation of the mRNA was performed from histological sections cut from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues after RT-PCR. Eighteen patients with melanoma were studied at mRNA expression level of EGF-receptor, c-erbB 2 oncogene and MTS 1 tumor suppressor gene. The expression has been correlated with the Breslow stage of skin infiltration and the presence of recurrences during the follow-up period. Results: The level of expression of EGFr was connected with the level of skin infiltration; in Breslow stages 1 and 2 the expression is low and dearly higher in Breslow 3. But a higher expression is not directly correlated with the presence of recurrences. On the other hand higher levels of c-erbB 2 and MTS 1 mRNA are related, particularly in stage 3 of <b>skin</b> infiltration <b>melanomas,</b> with absence of recurrences. In this case c- erbB 2 seems to be a variable independent of Breslow stage. Conclusions: Our study suggests in a preliminary way that a high level of expression of c- erbB 2 or MTS 1 could be connected with infiltrative melanomas, Breslow stage 3, that do not tend to cause recurrences. On the other hand the EGFr expression is related to the stage of the skin infiltration of the tumors...|$|R

40|$|The {{major role}} of 24 -hydroxylase (CYP 24 A 1) is to {{maintain}} 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 (1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3) homeostasis. Recently, it has been discovered that CYP 24 A 1 also catalyses the hydroxylation of 20 (OH) D 3, producing dihydroxy-derivatives that show very effective antitumorigenic activities. Previously we showed a negative correlation of vitamin D receptor (VDR) and CYP 27 B 1 expression with progression, aggressiveness and overall or disease-free survivals of <b>skin</b> <b>melanomas.</b> Therefore, we analyzed CYP 24 A 1 expression in relation to clinicopathomorphological features of nevi, <b>skin</b> <b>melanomas</b> and metastases. In melanocytic tumors, the level of CYP 24 A 1 was {{higher than in the}} normal epidermis. The statistically highest mean CYP 24 A 1 level was found in nevi and early stage melanomas. With melanoma progression, CYP 24 A 1 levels decreased and in advanced stages were comparable to the normal epidermis and metastases. Furthermore, the CYP 24 A 1 expression positively correlated with VDR and CYP 27 B 1, and negatively correlated with mitotic activity. Lower CYP 24 A 1 levels correlated with the presence of ulceration, necrosis, nodular type and amelanotic phenotypes. Moreover, a lack of detectable CYP 24 A 1 expression was related to shorter overall and disease-free survival. In conclusion, the local vitamin D endocrine system affects melanoma behavior and an elevated level of CYP 24 A 1 appears to have an important impact on the formation of melanocytic nevi and melanomagenesis, or progression, at early stages of tumor development...|$|R
