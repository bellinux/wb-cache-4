40|$|Asymmetrical {{separation}} of a severely overexpanded supersonic nozzle flow can cause un- wanted lateral pressure forces, or <b>side-loads,</b> {{acting on the}} nozzle structure. Some empirical models for <b>side-load</b> estimation exist but provide only moderate accuracy.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a novel 2 D MOT beam source for cold 6 Li atoms. The source is <b>side-loaded</b> from an oven operated at {{temperatures in the}} range 600 <T< 700 K. The performance is analyzed by loading the atoms into a 3 D MOT located 220 mm downstream from the source. The maximum recapture rate of ~ 10 ^ 9 /s is obtained for T= 700 K and results {{in a total of}} up to 10 ^ 10 trapped atoms. The recaptured fraction is estimated to be 30 (10) % and limited by beam divergence. The most-probable velocity in the beam (alpha_z) is varied from 18 to 70 m/s by increasing the intensity of a push beam. The source is quite monochromatic with a full-width at half maximum velocity spread of 11 m/s at alpha_z= 36 m/s, demonstrating that side-loading completely eliminates beam contamination by hot vapor from the oven. We identify depletion of the low-velocity tail of the oven flux as the limiting loss mechanism. Our approach is suitable for other atomic species. Comment: 13 pages, 9 figures, submitted to Phys.

The frame ends are turned up as tabs and each provided with openings in alignment {{with each other and}} the mid-width center of the roller surface. The tab openings are sized to accommodate welding wire and each extends to a side edge of the tab, both opening {{on the same side of}} the frame, whereby welding wire can be <b>side-loaded</b> onto the frame.

The thumb is positioned atop the wire so it can be moved from the back of the frame across the roller, and towards the front. In doing so, the wire is advanced at a steady rate in axial alignment with the tab openings and roller. To accommodate different wire diameters the frame is bendable about its center in the plane of the frame axis and wire so as to keep the wire in sufficient tension against the roller and to keep the wire fixed when the frame is tilted and thumb pressure released...|$|E
40|$|The {{propagation}} of an atomic beam through a 1. 7 m long magnetic guide with magnetic field gradient {{of up to}} 2. 7 kGauss/cm has been demonstrated. The guide is <b>side-loaded</b> with an atomic beam from a Pyramidal MOT Low-velocity Intense Source. The atomic beam observed {{at the end of}} the guide has a flux of 3 × 10 e 7 atoms/s with a velocity of 1. 2 m/s, a transverse temperature of 420 ± 40 μK and a longitudinal temperature of 1 mK. The guided atomic beam was mode-filtered by selective removal of high-energy atoms using radio-frequency coupling to magnetically untrapped states. We found that the phase-space density of the atomic beam was very low for evaporative cooling to be functional. An imaging technique was developed to characterize the guided atomic flow in the presence of a high magnetic field gradient. This technique utilizes the open-channel transition to obtain nearly constant photon yield per atom independent of the location of the atom in the guide, providing a mapping of the fluorescence images to the atomic-density profiles. This technique was theoretically studied using Quantum Monte-Carlo Simulations and validated. A Zeeman slower was constructed and characterized to be used as the primary source of atoms to the magnetic guide. The Zeeman slower output atomic beam has a flux of 3 × 10 e 11 atoms/s at a velocity of 40 m/s. We have designed a new injection scheme to transfer atoms from the Zeeman slower to the magnetic guide efficiently. The details of a new method to evaporatively cool atoms in the magnetic guide using surface adsorption are described. Finally, a new guide geometry based on a spiral structure is discussed...|$|E

40|$|The current paper {{discusses}} the exhaust flow features {{and the various}} unsteady flow separation characteristics in subscale overexpanded nozzles that lead to generation of <b>side-loads.</b> While a DiMR type of Mach reflection features in the exhaust of a truncated ideal contour nozzle an InMR occurs in a thrust optimized parabolic nozzle. The main contributor towards generation of sideloads in a parabolic nozzle {{is known to be}} the flow transitions (free shock separation →restricted shock separation and vice-versa) and the shock unsteadiness preceding them. However, in a truncated ideal contour nozzle (that features only FSS condition) the strongest cause of <b>side-load</b> origin are seen to be (i) the asymmetry of separation front around the nozzle circumference, (ii) length of separation region and, (iii) length of back-flow region. The flow asymmetry causes variations in pressure rise at separation and hence, in the local value of rms fluctuations. The length of separation region also shows considerable variations with NPR and tends to peak at NPR similar to those at which peaks in (σ w/Pw) max value and strain-gauge signal occur. Data therefore suggests that that the necessary condition for <b>side-load</b> generation in a TIC nozzle is not just the flow asymmetry but also the length of separation region which shows significant variation as the separation front gradually approaches the nozzle exit. The length of back-flow region, on the other hand, also seems to control the large-scale fluctuations of the separation front. As the extent of back-flow region decreases, the oscillations of separation shock die down with a subsequent drop in the <b>side-load</b> signal even when the separation front exhibits circumferential asymmetry...|$|R

40|$|Flow {{separation}} in nozzles of rocket engines is undesired {{because it}} can lead to dangerous lateral forces, which might damage the nozzle. The origin of <b>side-loads</b> is not fully clear, although different possible origins were identified in the past. Meanwhile, it seems to be clear that in thrust-optimized or parabolic nozzles, a major <b>side-load</b> is due to the transition of separation pattern from free shock separation to restricted shock separation and vice versa. After a literature review, the reasons for the transition between the separation patterns are discussed, and the cap shock pattern, which is identified to be the cause of this transition, is closely analyzed. It turns out that this pattern can be interpreted as an inverse Mach reflection of the internal shock at the centerline. The separation and <b>side-load</b> behavior of thrust-optimized and parabolic nozzles is described in detail. In {{order to be able to}} predict the pressure ratio pc/pa at which the transition of separation patterns occurs, a model is developed which uses TDK-data as an input.
