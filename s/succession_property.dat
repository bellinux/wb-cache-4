50|$|The modern Italian Civil Code {{contains}} 2969 {{articles and}} {{is divided into}} six books categorized under the headings Persons and Family, <b>Succession,</b> <b>Property</b> Obligations, Labor, and Protection of Rights. The Civil Code was adopted in 1942 whereas the Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure have been formally used by Italy since 1931. However all of these codes have since been extensively amended and the Code of Criminal Procedure has undergone significant modification based on decisions made in the Italian Constitutional Court. In 1988 a new Code of Criminal Procedure was adopted in realization of the constitutional principles.|$|E
50|$|Obligations did not {{originally}} {{form part}} of Roman Law, which mostly concerned issues of <b>succession,</b> <b>property,</b> and family relationships. It developed {{as a solution to}} a gap in the system, when one party committed a wrong against another party. These situations were originally governed by a basic customary law of revenge. This undesirable situation eventually developed into a system of liability where people were at first encouraged and then essentially forced to accept monetary compensation from the wrongdoer or their family instead of seeking vengeance. This signaled an important shift in the law away from vengeance and towards compensation. The state supported this effort by standardizing amounts for certain wrongs. Thus the earliest form of Obligation law derives out of what we would today call Delict.|$|E
50|$|The Futa Toro {{stretches}} {{for about}} 400 kilometers, {{but of a}} narrow width of up to 20 kilometers {{on either side of}} the Senegal River. The western part is called Toro, the central and eastern parts called Futa. The central portion include Bosea, Yirlabe Hebbyabe, Law and Hailabe provinces. The eastern Futa includes Ngenar and Damga provinces. The region north and east to Futa Toro is barren Sahara. Historically, each of the Futa Toro geographical provinces were fertile pockets of land due to the waalo flood plains present, and the control of this resource was driven by kin-based families. The long stretch meant the whole region was divided among many families, and the <b>succession</b> <b>property</b> rights from one generation to next led to many family disputes, political crises and conflicts.|$|E

5000|$|... a) The first {{legal text}} ruling the “Merindad” (County) of Durango, Biscay, was {{enacted by the}} King of Navarre Sancho the Wise and written in a missal {{of the church of}} Saint Agustin of Echevarria {{approximately}} in 1.200 b.c. Circa 1.342 b.c. the Charter of the County of Durango was written, including the custom and usage about <b>succession,</b> <b>property,</b> Criminal law, etc., till then orally transmitted. This Charter lasted till the enforcement of the Charter of Biscay, which was not initially accepted by the people of Durango, who preserved for a while the application the aforementioned own legal text. b) The Charter of Abellaneda of 1394. The Charter of Custom and Usages in force in the County of “Las Encartaciones” was written in 1394, 58 years before the redaction of the Biscay Charter. This Encartaciones first Ordinance or Charter, edited under the impulse of the Mayor appointed by the King Gonzalo Moro, had 45 articles or epigraphers. Inspired by the Brotherhood Ordinance of Biscay, was led by a preface, changed some penalties, inserted some original provisions and added some civil regulations. d) The Old Charter of 1452. This Charter is divided into 210 chapters or norms (unnumbered, Astuy´s edition aside) that rule diverse issues: The oath of the Lord, trade freedom, fiscal freedoms, process warranties, etc. as well as a vast number of civil provisions. In 1506-02-11, by means of the Mayor appointed by the King Vázquez de Acuña application, a revision of some regulation was held, the most interesting one, the provision, {{in order to avoid the}} application of Roman or Canonical sources in the interpretation of the Biscayan Law, the latter literal interpretation. e) The Charter of the Encartaciones in 1503 includes 111 chapters or provisions. The last 38 ones are the Common Law charter, mainly Civil Law. The text also comprehends the Neighbours’s Charter applicable on Salcedo and Gordejuela valleys. f) The New Charter of 1526 includes 36 epigraphs divided into an unbalanced number of norms. It is an incomplete text since its ignores many institutions, something logical in some cases due to the subsidiary enforcement of the Law of Castile, but not about some Biscayan deep-rooted customs, specifically in the Public Law area, where, as a matter of fact, it is remarkable the absence of any regulation about the notification and functioning of the Biscay County Assembly. However, the Charter rules the utmost important institutions, and mainly, the essential freedoms that constitute the Charter regulation.|$|E

40|$|Articles 2 (a) -(f) and 16 (1) (h) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) {{prohibit}} {{discrimination and}} enjoin State parties to ensure substantive equality {{between men and}} women in marriage and family relations. To ensure compliance with the CEDAW, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW Committee) examines State parties' periodic reports and makes pertinent observations. In 1985 by ratifying the CEDAW without any reservations, Uganda willingly undertook to make her laws and institutions regulating rights of <b>succession</b> to <b>property</b> compliant with the CEDAW. On 9 th August 2002 the CEDAW Committee expressed concern over the country's state-made and non-state-made laws of marriage and succession. Uganda was called upon to remove, in family relations, among others, de jure discrimination and eliminate de facto discrimination against her women. With the above concerns in mind, this dissertation primarily measures Uganda's laws and institutions regulating rights of <b>succession</b> to <b>property</b> with the standards set by the CEDAW. To clarify rights of <b>succession</b> to <b>property,</b> however, laws and institutions regulating rights to property in marriage and upon divorce are also juxtaposed against the said CEDAW standards. The dissertation suggests reforms with a view to making Uganda's said laws and institutions compliant with Articles 2 (a) -(f) and 16 (1) (h) of the CEDAW. Whilst some of the law reform propositions are based on intuition, given that countries rarely improve their laws without looking at what other jurisdictions are doing, this dissertation has sought progressive ideas from the English, Scots and South African laws and institutions regulating rights to property in marriage, upon divorce and upon the death of a spouse. While there is legal pluralism in Uganda's laws and institutions regulating women's rights to property in marriage, upon divorce and upon the death of a spouse, such pluralism should not prevail over compliance with Articles 2 (a) -(f) and 16 (1) (h) of the CEDAW, as an international legal imperative: women's rights to property in Uganda may be regulated by state-made, customary and Islamic family laws and institutions so long as compliance with Articles 2 (a) -(f) and 16 (1) (h) of the CEDAW is guaranteed...|$|R
