40|$|AbstractReverse Engineering and Rapid Prototyping are {{extensively}} used technologies by both {{research and}} industrial community for rapid developments in various industrial {{as well as}} Bio-medical applications. Recent advances in computer technology and Bio-medicines enabled Computer Aided Design (CAD) to find many novel applications in Bio-medical engineering and integration of CAD and Bio-medical technology is usually referred as Bio-CAD. The major objective of the current research work is to generate an efficient algorithm for generation of free form surface from non-invasive CT scan images. Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery (MISS) have enabled spinal surgeons to select patients and treat several spinal disorders like degenerative disc disease, herniated disc, fractures, tumors, infections, instability, deformity, etc. with less disruption of muscles, which enables patient towards faster recovery to normal functions, reduces operative blood loss. In this paper, it is proposed to extract point cloud data from stalk of non-invasive CT scan images by using Image Processing techniques and Reverse Engineering approach. This point cloud data is to be processed for noise reduction, point cloud data segmentation and CAD model generation. This image-based CAD modeling approach begins with the acquisition of CT scan in DICOM 3. 0 format. The point cloud estimation is based on threshold techniques and edge detection method. This point cloud data is used for construction of 3 D CAD model by fitting free form NURB surface between theses points and then fitting surface between these curve networks by <b>swept</b> <b>blend</b> technique. An efficient and robust algorithm has been developed for generation of curves from unorganized point cloud data...|$|E
50|$|The Su-27's {{basic design}} is aerodynamically {{similar to the}} MiG-29, but it is {{substantially}} larger. The <b>swept</b> wing <b>blends</b> into the fuselage {{at the leading edge}} extensions and is essentially a cropped delta (the delta wing with tips cropped for missile rails or ECM pods). The Su-27 is also an example of a tailed delta wing configuration, retaining conventional horizontal tailplanes, though it is not a true delta.|$|R
50|$|Sharing {{its origins}} in the {{original}} PFI requirements issued by TsAGI, the MiG-29 has broad aerodynamic similarities to the Sukhoi Su-27, however, there are some notable differences. The MiG-29 has a mid-mounted <b>swept</b> wing with <b>blended</b> leading-edge root extensions (LERXs) swept at around 40Â°; there are swept tailplanes and two vertical fins, mounted on booms outboard of the engines. Automatic slats are mounted on the leading edges of the wings; they are four-segment on early models and five-segment on some later variants. On the trailing edge, there are maneuvering flaps and wingtip ailerons.|$|R
40|$|Aprocedure for reconstructing solid {{models of}} {{conventional}} engineering objects from a multiple-view, 3 D point cloud is described. (Conventional means bounded by simple analytical surfaces, <b>swept</b> surfaces and <b>blends.)</b> Emphasis {{is put on}} producing accurate and topologically consistent boundary representation models, ready {{to be used in}} computer aided design and manufacture. The basic phases of our approach to reverse engineering are summarised, and related computational difficulties are analysed. Four key algorithmic components are presented in more detail: efficiently segmenting point data into regions; creating translational and rotational surfaces with smooth, constrained profiles; creating the topology of B-rep models; and finally adding blends. The application of these algorithms in an integrated system is illustrated by means of various examples, including a well-known reverse engineering benchmark. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to realistic hand modeling and deformation with real-time performance. We model the underlying shape of a human hand by means of sweeps which follow a simplified skeleton. The resulting <b>swept</b> surfaces are <b>blended,</b> and an auxiliary surface is then bound to the swept representation in the palm region. In the areas of this palm-control surface where bulges occur in certain poses of a real hand, the vertices are given their own trajectories, so that the palm forms realistic shapes as the joints bend. Palm lines can also be modeled as valleys in the skin by sketching them on a displacement map on the palmcontrol surface, and activating them when appropriate joint movements take place. Self-intersections and collisions are detected using geometric primitives that are automatically generated from, and deform with, the sweeps and palm surface. Our algorithm runs in real time, and the naturalism of its results are demonstrated by comparative images of modeled and real hands, including several challenging poses...|$|R
