5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1992 Parry favoured a deal with ITV, but thought the network <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> to pay up towards £30 million for live football. At a meeting in January 1992, Dyke made it clear ITV would not be positioned as they were already paying too much for football. He and executive director Trevor East commented on BSkyB's debt and felt the company {{would be forced to}} increase their borrowing if they were awarded a contract. This did not dissuade Quinton, who urged Murdoch to bid. Quinton even informed Chisholm that there were no bidding rules.|$|E
5|$|All {{apprentices}} were to {{be educated}} in reading, writing and arithmetic {{for the first four}} years of their apprenticeship. The Act specified that this should be done every working day within usual working hours but did not state how much time should be set aside for it. Educational classes should be held {{in a part of the}} mill or factory designed for the purpose. Every Sunday, for one hour, apprentices {{were to be}} taught the Christian religion; every other Sunday, a divine service should be held in the factory, and every month the apprentices should visit a church. They <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> for confirmation in the Church of England between the ages of 14 and 18 and must be examined by a clergyman at least once a year. Male and female apprentices were to sleep separately and not more than two per bed.|$|E
5|$|Although Kepler's {{calculations}} {{indicated that}} the 1631 transit of Venus would best be visible from the American continent, he was not fully confident of his prediction, and advised that European astronomers <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> to observe the event. Gassendi and others in Europe watched for it but, as predicted, the Sun was below the horizon during the transit. According to modern calculations, observers in much of Italy and along the eastern Mediterranean {{should have been able}} to view the last stage of the transit, but no such observations were recorded. Kepler had predicted a near miss for a Venus transit in 1639 and, as the next full transit was not expected for another 121years, Gassendi and the other astronomers concentrated their efforts in other areas.|$|E

25|$|According to Judaism, Jews that voluntarily {{convert to}} Islam commit a treacherous act of heresy in abandoning the Torah. There is a view, {{held by the}} Radvaz and Ritva, that a Jew <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> to take his own life rather than convert to another religion, but the Rambam, also known as Maimonides, expresses {{that it is not}} {{necessary}} that a Jew take his own life if he is forced to convert but privately follows the Torah.|$|E
25|$|In December 2005, as {{the trials}} began, it was {{reported}} that tensions were building between the Bali Nine drug mules and Sukumaran and Chan. Several days later, lawyers acting for some members of the Bali Nine initially sought the support of the Director of Public Prosecutions to intervene and lay charges for conspiracy to import drugs, so that the nine could be extradited and charged under Australian law. However, the judges hearing the trial matters in Bali called for Australia not to intervene in Indonesia's right to impose capital punishment;. Lawyers acting for Stephens claimed that the fairness of his trial was in jeopardy following comments made in the media by Indonesian Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda that Australians <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> for members of the Bali Nine to receive a death sentence, if found guilty.|$|E
25|$|The diver has a {{very limited}} ability to survive without a supply of {{breathing}} gas. Any interruption to that supply must be considered a life-threatening emergency, and the diver <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> {{to deal effectively with}} any reasonably foreseeable loss of breathing gas. Temporary interruptions due to flooding or dislodging the demand valve are recoverable by recovery and clearing of the demand valve. More permanent interruptions require other strategies. An obvious response which is appropriate in some circumstances is to ascend to the surface. This response is appropriate when the consequences are acceptable. When the surface is near enough to easily be reached, and the diver has no significant risk of decompression sickness as a consequence of a direct ascent, an emergency free ascent may be a suitable response. If the surface is too far to reach with confidence, or if the risk of decompression sickness is unacceptable, other responses would be preferable. These involve getting an alternative supply of breathing gas, either from an alternative source carried by the diver, or from another diver.|$|E
50|$|The {{rule of thirds}} is a rule {{of thumb}} used when {{planning}} for the deployment and usage of a military organisation, according to which one third of the total military forces involved <b>should</b> <b>be</b> available for operations, one third <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>preparing</b> for operations and the final third, having <b>been</b> on operations, <b>should</b> <b>be</b> recuperating.

25|$|Similar {{dangerous}} {{soil conditions}} and insufficiently resistant buildings {{are also on}} the southern, western and northern boundaries of San Francisco and San Pablo bays and would also be severely affected by a major earthquake on the Hayward fault. As that portion includes the so-called Silicon Valley, the potential economic disruption due to destruction of works in progress and the dismantling of microelectronics fabrication plants could have an economic effect extending worldwide. The current estimates of the probability of a major earthquake on any of the numerous regional faults range up to 70 percent within the thirty-year period 2000–2029. A recent quiet period following many years of minor activity is considered to be particularly ominous by many, although geologists have not yet been able to predict earthquakes with any useful accuracy. They do warn that all residents of the region <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> for a large event and its subsequent effects (e. g., lack of water, firefighting, first aid, electricity, motor and heating fuels, etc.) and that much life-safety protective work remains to be done.|$|E
25|$|In 1640 CharlesI {{ordered that}} the Tower of London <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> for conflict. Platforms for cannons were built and 21 {{installed}} {{on top of}} the White Tower with three additional mortars. Despite the new defences the Parliamentarians captured the Tower of London without the cannon being used. In January 1642, CharlesI attempted to arrest five Members of Parliament. When this failed he fled the city, and Parliament retaliated by removing Sir John Byron, the Lieutenant of the Tower. The Trained Bands had switched sides, and now supported Parliament; together with the London citizenry, they blockaded the Tower. With permission from the King, Byron relinquished control of the Tower. Parliament replaced Byron with a man of their own choosing, Sir John Conyers. By the time the English Civil War broke out in November 1642, the Tower of London was already in Parliament's control. By 1657 the entire building apart from the chapel was being used to store gunpowder. Storing both gunpowder and government records in the White Tower was not ideal, and there were repeated suggestions in 1620, 1718, and 1832 to move the gunpowder to a new location, although the proposals were unsuccessful.|$|E

[...] Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, during a discussion about terrorism, torture and the law, took offense at a Canadian judge's remark that Canada, [...] "thankfully", did not consider what Jack Bauer would do when setting policy. He reportedly responded with a defense of Bauer, arguing that law enforcement officials deserve latitude in times of great crisis, and that no jury would convict Bauer in those types of situations.|$|E

[...] Although she approved of its attitude to race, she {{believed that the}} example of Nazi Germany was not one that should be emulated because of its totalitarian structure and alliance with capitalists. Instead she expressed favorable comments regarding the economically left-wing policies of the early Benito Mussolini government in Italy, and of the Strasserite National Bolshevik factions within Germany's Nazi Party.

500|$|Coloman's father {{ascended the}} throne in 1074. Because Coloman and Álmos were minors {{when he died}} on 25April 1077, Géza's brother Ladislaus I succeeded him. The new king decided that Coloman <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> {{for a career in}} the Church. The king's {{decision}} was unusual as Coloman was older than Álmos and elder brothers were rarely ordained priests. The 14th-century Illuminated Chronicle stated that Coloman was [...] "of mean stature, but astute and quick of apprehension", adding that he was [...] "shaggy and hirsute, half-blind and humpbacked, and he walked with a limp and stammered in his speech". If the chronicle preserved genuine tradition of his appearance, his physical deformity may have influenced his uncle's decision. However, modern scholars tend to refute this view, emphasizing that the chronicle was completed in the reigns of kings descending from Álmos.|$|E
500|$|There was a {{widespread}} expectation that Ida McKinley would not long survive her husband; one family friend stated, as William McKinley lay dying, that they <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> {{for a double}} funeral. This did not occur; {{the former first lady}} accompanied her husband on the funeral train. Leech noted [...] "the circuitous journey was a cruel ordeal for the woman who huddled in a compartment of the funeral train, praying that the Lord would take her with her Dearest Love". She was thought too weak to attend the services in Washington or Canton, although she listened at the door to the service for her husband in her house on North Market Street. She remained in Canton for the remainder of her life, setting up a shrine in her house, and often visiting the receiving vault, until her death at age 59 on May 26, 1907. She died only months before the completion of the large marble monument to her husband in Canton, which was dedicated by President Roosevelt on September 30, 1907. William and Ida McKinley are interred there with their daughters, atop a hillside overlooking the city of Canton.|$|E
500|$|Work in Gibraltar began {{immediately}} under Commander Geoffrey Birley and {{his chief}} engineer Colonel Fordham. The site chosen at Lord Airey's Battery {{on the southern}} tip of the Rock already had an existing tunnelling scheme for a shelter. Extensive trials of the equipment began in January 1942 under the eye of MI6 radio expert Colonel Richard Gambier-Parry. Much thought was also given to the type of men needed for such a strange and demanding task. A member of Scott’s ill-fated expedition to the Antarctic, George Murray Levick was called up as Surgeon-Commander to advise on survival techniques. There were practical matters such as diet, exercise, sanitation, and clothing to consider as well as vital [...] "psychology of the personnel". The full team was in place by the end of summer 1942 and their cavern fully equipped and ready for occupation. A comprehensive manual was prepared on all aspects of the operation and it was considered that similar secret lookout posts <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> throughout the world in the event of future wars. However, Operation Tracer was never needed, as Adolf Hitler turned his attention away from Gibraltar and towards the Eastern Front.|$|E
