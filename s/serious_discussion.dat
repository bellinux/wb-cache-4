5|$|The {{idea for}} a tunnel under Loveland Pass existed {{at least since the}} 1940s. <b>Serious</b> <b>discussion</b> began when the state of Colorado lobbied for the Interstate Highway System to route a transcontinental highway across Colorado. After a round of {{negotiations}} with Utah officials, it was decided the best option was to follow the U.S. Route 6 corridor. Engineers recommended to tunnel under the pass, rather than attempt to build a route across it that conformed to Interstate Highway standards.|$|E

Michael soon learns that it is a cold sore, and he over-reacts, thinking he has herpes. With some prodding from Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), Michael decides to tell his former lovers he has herpes, despite not yet having gone to a doctor. He calls Donna (Amy Pietz) first, abruptly telling her to get tested. Michael then calls Holly Flax (Amy Ryan), joking around with her before they have a more <b>serious</b> <b>discussion.</b> Much to Michael's dismay, she claims that he over-romanticized their relationship, and he hangs up without telling her about the herpes. Michael and Dwight drive out to tell Carol Stills (Nancy Carell), Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin), and Pam's mother, Helene Beesly (Linda Purl).|$|E

500|$|The Careless Husband was a {{great success}} {{on the stage and}} {{remained}} a repertory play throughout the 18th century. Although it has now joined Love's Last Shift as a forgotten curiosity, it kept a respectable critical reputation into the 20th century, coming in for <b>serious</b> <b>discussion</b> both as an interesting example of doublethink, and as somewhat morally or emotionally insightful. In 1929, the well-known critic F. W. Bateson described the play's psychology as [...] "mature", [...] "plausible", [...] "subtle", [...] "natural", and [...] "affecting".|$|E
500|$|In contrast, {{the renowned}} 20th century Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges, who {{admitted}} Poe {{as a strong}} influence, praised the novel as [...] "Poe's greatest work". H. G.

Even so, most scholars did not engage in much <b>serious</b> <b>discussion</b> or analysis of the novel until the 1950s, though many in France recognized the work much earlier. In 2013, The Guardian cited The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket {{as one of the}} greatest novels ever written in English, and noted its influence on later authors such as Henry James, Arthur Conan Doyle, B.

500|$|Magazines {{devoted to}} the <b>serious</b> <b>discussion</b> of popular music first {{developed}} in the 1960s and 1970s, with some formative rock critics suggesting that enduring pop music art was made by singer-songwriters using traditional rock instruments on long-playing albums, and that pop hits reside on a lower aesthetic plane {{as a source of}} [...] "guilty pleasure". The term [...] "rockism" [...] was coined in 1981 by English rock musician Pete Wylie and soon became a pejorative used humorously by self-described [...] "anti-rockist" [...] critics in the British press. Originally coinciding with the rise of New Pop in the early 1980s, the term was not generally used outside the confines of small music magazines until the mid 2000s, partly due to the increasing number of bloggers who used it more seriously in analytical debate.|$|E

500|$|Himmler's diary, {{which he}} kept {{intermittently}} {{from the age}} of ten, shows that he took a keen interest in current events, dueling, and [...] "the <b>serious</b> <b>discussion</b> of religion and sex". In 1915, he began training with the Landshut Cadet Corps. His father used his connections with the royal family to get Himmler accepted as an officer candidate, and he enlisted with the reserve battalion of the 11th Bavarian Regiment in December 1917. His brother, Gebhard, served on the western front and saw combat, receiving the Iron Cross and eventually being promoted to lieutenant. In November 1918, while Himmler was still in training, the war ended with Germany's defeat, denying him the opportunity to become an officer or see combat. After his discharge on 18 December, he returned to Landshut. After the war, Himmler completed his grammar-school education. From 1919–22, he studied agronomy at the Munich Technische Hochschule (now Technical University Munich) following a brief apprenticeship on a farm and a subsequent illness.|$|E
500|$|Her 1923 annual {{performance}} at Aeolian Hall entitled [...] "Recital of Ancient and Modern Music for Voice" [...] became a historic occasion when she presented {{the works of}} George Gershwin, the first time his works were performed by a classical singer in concert. The {{first half of the}} programme presented works considered serious music at the time. She performed both classical works by Vincenzo Bellini and Henry Purcell, mixing them with modernist and neoclassical works by Béla Bartók, Paul Hindemith, Arnold Schoenberg, Arthur Bliss, Darius Milhaud, Maurice Delage, and Swan Hennessy. The second half of her performance would upset the musical establishment, however. She opened with Alexander's Ragtime Band by Irving Berlin, then performed works by Jerome Kern and Walter Donaldson, and finally finished with three works by George Gershwin: I'll Build a Stairway to Paradise, Innocent Ingénue Baby, and Swanee. Gershwin played the piano for these pieces. Important figures in the audience included Ernestine Schumann-Heink, Virgil Thomson, and Paul Whiteman. [...] Although some musical critics panned her decision to include Jazz music, the performance was overall a huge success, and provoked <b>serious</b> <b>discussion</b> among conservative audiences whether jazz music could be considered serious art.|$|E

Bonnie Stiernberg of Paste magazine noted that, despite Andy's regression to [...] "his old ways", it was beneficial for the episode and allowed for many jokes to be played out. Furthermore, Stiernberg applauded the subtle drama that ran throughout the entry, writing Darryl, Erin, and Pete's interactions with Andy were important to the overall storyline. Mark Trammell of TV Equals named it [...] "the best episode of the final season of The Office to date" [...] because it [...] "played to the show's strengths". Furthermore, he complimented the character development of Nellie, writing that she [...] "really started to grow on me this week" [...] and that his favorite line was Darryl's [...] "words of wisdom" [...] to Jim: [...] "It's not real until your wife is on board." [...] Michael Tedder of New York magazine gave the episode a positive review and noted that [...] "It's been a while since The Office was this surprising and moving." [...] He wrote that the main plot allowed for [...] "overdue development" [...] in regards to other characters and applauded the continued drama involving Pam and Jim; he called the last shot [...] "quietly heartbreaking". He did, however, call it a [...] "particularly overstuffed episode", and felt that Erin's subplot could have been saved for a different episode.|$|E
