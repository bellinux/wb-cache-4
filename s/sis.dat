5|$|In 1983 {{the site}} was bought by {{property}} developers Regalian Properties. A competition to develop {{the site was}} won by architect Terry Farrell, with an urban village as Farrell's original proposal. A scheme of office blocks was subsequently developed for the site, with a government agency as their occupier. The building had been sold for £130million in 1989, with construction planned to take three years, built by John Laing. <b>SIS</b> ultimately became the occupiers of the building. Farrell's design for the <b>SIS</b> building was influenced by 1930s industrial modernist architecture such as Bankside and Battersea Power Stations and Mayan and Aztec religious temples.|$|E
5|$|In August 2010 two {{men from}} North Wales were arrested after a parcel bomb {{was found at}} the <b>SIS</b> building's postal {{handling}} centre.|$|E
5|$|Lightfoot <b>Sis</b> showed classic short {{speed in}} her pedigree, {{although}} she was unraced due to an injury as a filly that left her blind in one eye. Her sire was the Thoroughbred stallion Very Wise, and her dam was a Quarter Horse mare named Clear Track.|$|E
5|$|Regalian {{approached}} {{the government in}} 1987 to assess their interest in the proposed building. In 1988 Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher approved {{the purchase of the}} new building for the <b>SIS.</b> The NAO put the final cost at £135.05million for site purchase and the basic building or £152.6million including the service's special requirements.|$|E
5|$|Sir Paul Dukes {{was born}} in Bridgwater, an alumnus of Caterham School, {{and went on to}} be the premier <b>SIS</b> agent in pre-revolution Russia. Known as the Man with a Hundred Faces, he eluded Bolshevik capture and is still the only man to be knighted based on his {{exploits}} as a spy.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond's wife, Sybil, {{wanted to}} secure Antioch for her son, William, with the {{assistance}} of Leo of Cilicia (whose wife, Isabel, was her niece). Leo invited Bohemond and his family to Bagras, saying that he wanted to start negotiations regarding the surrender of the fortress either to Antioch or to the Templars in early 1194. The meeting was a trap: Bohemond was captured and taken to Leo's capital, <b>Sis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Featured on {{the cover}} of Sports Illustrated. He has {{appeared}} as the main subject {{on the cover}} eight times in total; seven with the Giants and once with the Pirates. He has also appeared in an inset on the cover twice. He was the most recent Pirate player to appear on the cover, until Jason Grilli was featured in <b>SIs</b> edition of July 22, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Strangways, the British Intelligence (<b>SIS)</b> Station Chief in Jamaica, is killed. In response, British agent James Bond—also {{known as}} 007—is sent to Jamaica to {{investigate}} the circumstances. During his investigation Bond meets Quarrel, a Cayman fisherman, {{who had been working}} with Strangways around the nearby islands to collect mineral samples. One of the islands was Crab Key, home to the reclusive Dr. No.|$|E
5|$|The pre-title {{sequence}} {{begins in}} Bilbao, Spain, featuring the Guggenheim Museum. After the opening scene, the film moves to London, showcasing the <b>SIS</b> Building and the Millennium Dome on the Thames. Following the title sequence, Eilean Donan castle in Scotland {{is used by}} MI6 as a location headquarters. Other locations include Baku, Azerbaijan, the Azerbaijan Oil Rocks and Istanbul, Turkey, where Maiden's Tower and Küçüksu Palace are shown.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the fall}} of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia in 1375, the See of <b>Sis</b> {{experienced}} decline and disarray. The Catholicosate of Aghtamar and the locally influential Syunik bishops enhanced the importance of the region around Etchmiadzin. In 1441 a general council of several hundred religious figures met in Etchmiadzin and voted to reestablish a catholicosate there. The cathedral was restored by Catholicos Kirakos (Cyriacus) between 1441 and 1443. At that time Etchmiadzin was {{under the control of the}} Turkic Kara Koyunlu, but in 1502, Safavid Iran gained control of parts of Armenia, including Etchmiadzin, and granted the Armenian Church some privileges.|$|E
5|$|For {{security}} reasons, GCHQ {{moved its}} own computers and technical infrastructure to the Doughnut, which caused {{the cost of}} its move to increase from £41m to £450m over two years. The moves of MI5 and the <b>SIS</b> to new buildings had also cost {{more than three times}} their original estimates due to issues with transferring computers. HM Treasury paid £216m toward a newly agreed budget of £308m, having initially refused to finance the original high figure. The final cost of GCHQ's move to their new headquarters was more than seven times the original estimate.|$|E
5|$|In 1988 Regalian Properties {{purchased}} the site, and appointed Terry Farrell as architect. Farrell designed a self-contained community of shops, housing, offices and public spaces for the site. Regalian disliked the proposals and requested Farrell design a single large office block. Despite containing 50% more office space than the rejected Green Giant proposal, the design was accepted. The government then bought {{the site and}} design as a future headquarters for the Secret Intelligence Service, and the design was accordingly modified to increase security. In 1995 the <b>SIS</b> Building was opened on the site, and today dominates other buildings {{in the vicinity of}} the bridge.|$|E
5|$|The site {{on which}} the <b>SIS</b> {{building}} stands had been {{the location of the}} Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens in the 19th century. Several industrial buildings were subsequently built on the site after the demolition of the pleasure gardens in the 1850s, including a glass factory, a vinegar works and a gin distillery. Archeological excavation of the site during building found the remains of seventeenth century glass kilns, as well as barge houses and an inn called The Vine. Evidence was also found for a river wall on the site.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as using}} events from his past, Fleming also used names of {{individuals}} he knew {{for some of}} his characters. The editor of The London Magazine, Alan Ross, had provided Fleming with details {{about the effects of}} the electroshock therapy that Bond went through and, by way of thanks, the novel's <b>SIS</b> station chief in Jamaica, Commander Ross, was named after him. Similarly, Fleming used the name of the secretary of the Royal St George's Golf Club, Mark Nicholson, for the CIA representative at the hotel. Tony Hugill, the sugar planter mentioned in the novel, was named after a member of Fleming's 30 AU unit who managed the Tate & Lyle plantations in West Indies after the war and the book's main villain, Francisco Scaramanga, was named after George Scaramanga, an Etonian contemporary of Fleming's: the pair are said to have fought at school.|$|E
25|$|Since 1995, <b>SIS</b> {{has been}} {{headquartered}} in the <b>SIS</b> Building in London, on the South Bank of the River Thames.|$|E
25|$|After the sacking of Hromkla by the Mamluks in 1293, the Catholicosate was {{transferred}} to <b>Sis,</b> {{the capital of the}} Cilician Kingdom. Again, in 1441, long {{after the fall of the}} kingdom, the Armenian Catholicos of <b>Sis,</b> Grigor IX Musabekiants, proclaimed the union of the Armenian and Latin churches at the Council of Florence; this was countered by an Armenian schism under Kirakos I Virapetsi, who moved the See of the Catholicos to Echmiadzin, and marginalized <b>Sis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sir John Sawers became {{head of the}} <b>SIS</b> in November 2009, {{the first}} {{outsider}} to head <b>SIS</b> in more than 40 years. Sawers came from the Diplomatic Service, previously having been the British Permanent Representative to the United Nations.|$|E
25|$|<b>SIS</b> {{members were}} present in Afghanistan during the 2001 {{invasion}} following the September 11 attacks; after members of the 22nd SAS Regiment returned to the UK in mid-December 2001, members of both territorial SAS regiments remained {{in the country to}} provide close protection to <b>SIS</b> members.|$|E
25|$|Simeon {{was the son}} of a shepherd. He {{was born}} in <b>Sis,</b> now the Turkish town of Kozan in Adana Province. <b>Sis</b> was in the Roman {{province}} of Cilicia. After the division of the Roman Empire in 395 CE, it became part of the Eastern Roman Empire. Christianity developed quickly there.|$|E
25|$|Most {{cases of}} <b>SIS</b> have {{occurred}} in young people, who {{are thought to be}} particularly vulnerable. In order to prevent <b>SIS,</b> guidelines have been established to prohibit athletes from returning to a game prematurely. For example, professionals recommend that athletes not return to play before symptoms of an initial head injury have resolved.|$|E
25|$|Richard B. Tinsley, <b>SIS</b> officer, station chief during WWI.|$|E
25|$|Another {{allegation}} {{is that in}} 2011, the Prime Minister's office {{facilitated the}} release of confidential Security Intelligence Service (<b>SIS)</b> documents to Cameron Slater so he could use them to embarrass Phil Goff. Slater made an Official Information Act (OIA) request to the <b>SIS</b> for confidential documents which confirmed the <b>SIS</b> had briefed Phil Goff about suspected Israeli spies who left the country after the second Christchurch earthquake – after Goff had said publicly he was not briefed. Slater was given access to documents within 24 hours – long before other media outlets who had also asked for them. Slater's emails described in Dirty Politics suggest {{he knew what was}} in the documents before they were released and that the OIA would be expedited in unusually quick time. Goff believes this inside information could only have come from the <b>SIS</b> director Warren Tucker or from staff in the prime minister's office.|$|E

25|$|Second-impact {{syndrome}} (<b>SIS)</b> {{occurs when}} the brain swells rapidly, and catastrophically, after a person suffers a second concussion before symptoms from an earlier one have subsided. This second blow may occur minutes, days or weeks after an initial concussion, and even the mildest grade of concussion can lead to <b>SIS.</b> The condition is often fatal, and almost everyone who is not killed is severely disabled. The cause of <b>SIS</b> is uncertain, but {{it is thought that}} the brain's arterioles lose their ability to regulate their diameter, and therefore lose control over cerebral blood flow, causing massive cerebral edema.|$|E
25|$|Several {{years before}} the Libyan Civil War, a UK Special Forces unit was formed called E Squadron which was {{composed}} of selected members of the 22nd SAS Regiment, the SBS and the SRR. It was tasked by the Director Special Forces to support MI6's operations (akin to the CIA's SAD – a covert paramilitary unit for <b>SIS).</b> It was not a formal squadron within the establishment of any individual UK Special Forces unit; previously, <b>SIS</b> relied primarily on contractor personnel. In early March 2011, during the Libyan Civil War, a covert operation in Libya involving E Squadron went wrong: a team consisting of six E Squadron members and two <b>SIS</b> officers were flown into Libya by an RAF Special Forces Flight Chinook when <b>SIS</b> decided {{to make contact with}} some key rebel leaders; the team was detained by rebel forces until they established who they were.|$|E
25|$|The Secret Intelligence Service (<b>SIS),</b> {{commonly}} known as MI6, is the foreign intelligence service {{of the government of}} the United Kingdom, tasked mainly with the covert overseas collection and analysis of human intelligence (HUMINT) in support of the UK's national security. <b>SIS</b> {{is a member of the}} country's intelligence community and its Chief is accountable to the country's Foreign Secretary.|$|E
25|$|The most {{significant}} {{failure of the}} service during the war {{was known as the}} Venlo incident, named for the Dutch town where much of the operation took place. Agents of the German army secret service, the Abwehr, and the counter-espionage section of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD), posed as high-ranking officers involved in a plot to depose Hitler. In a series of meetings between <b>SIS</b> agents and the 'conspirators', SS plans to abduct the <b>SIS</b> team were shelved due to the presence of Dutch police. On the night of 8–9 November 1939, a meeting took place without police presence. There, the two <b>SIS</b> agents were duly abducted by the SS.|$|E

25|$|In the {{immediate}} post-war years under Sir Mansfield George Smith-Cumming and {{throughout most of}} the 1920s, <b>SIS</b> was focused on Communism, in particular, Russian Bolshevism. Examples include a thwarted operation to overthrow the Bolshevik government in 1918 by <b>SIS</b> agents Sidney George Reilly and Sir Robert Bruce Lockhart, as well as more orthodox espionage efforts within early Soviet Russia headed by Captain George Hill.|$|E

25|$|During {{his first}} year in office, Toledo {{replaced}} previous health-insurance programs aimed at the poor with a more comprehensive free insurance program, Seguro Integral de Salud (<b>SIS).</b> The program aimed to provide Peruvians without health insurance with improved access to health care. By the end of his term, <b>SIS</b> covered more than 11million Peruvians living on the outskirts of cities or in rural areas. However, {{about a third of the}} country remained without health coverage.|$|E
25|$|Formed in 1909 as {{a section}} of the Secret Service Bureau specialising in foreign intelligence, the section {{experienced}} dramatic growth during World War I and officially adopted its current name around 1920. The name MI6 (meaning Military Intelligence, Section 6) originated as a flag of convenience during World War II, when <b>SIS</b> was known by many names; it is still commonly used today. The existence of <b>SIS</b> was only officially acknowledged in 1994 with the introduction of the Intelligence Services Act 1994 (ISA), which placed the organisation on a statutory footing {{for the first time and}} provides the legal basis for its operations. Today, <b>SIS</b> is subject to public oversight by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal and the Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee.|$|E
25|$|Two years later, in 1991, The Deceiver was published. It {{includes}} four short stories reviewing {{the career of}} British secret agent Sam McCready. At {{the start of the}} novel, the Permanent Under-Secretary of State (PUSS) of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office requires the Chief of the <b>SIS</b> to push Sam into early retirement. The four stories are presented to a grievance committee in an attempt to allow Sam to stay on active duty with the <b>SIS.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Zimbardo {{began working}} with Sarah Brunskill and Anthony Ferreras on a new theory called the social {{intensity}} syndrome (<b>SIS).</b> <b>SIS</b> is a new term coined to describe and normalize the effects military culture has on the socialization of both active soldiers and veterans. Zimbardo and Brunskill presented the new theory and a preliminary factor analysis of it accompanying survey at the Western Psychological Association in 2013. Brunskill finished the data collection in December 2013. Through an exploratory component factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency and validity tests demonstrated that <b>SIS</b> was a reliable and valid construct of measuring military socialization. Fifty-eight items were deemed viable and six factors were identified; military friends (16 items), family (11 items), gender social preference (7 items), social bonding (11 items), nostalgia (9 items) and drug use (4 items). Identifying and standardizing <b>SIS</b> was the first step, further research has identified that 4 demographic categories within the military; active and have been deployed (AD), active and never been deployed (AND), inactive and have been deployed (ID) and inactive and never been deployed (IND). These are important categories to better understand how service members are affected leaving the military.|$|E
