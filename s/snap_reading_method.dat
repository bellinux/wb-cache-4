The scores {{of participants who}} read three comparable passages in three ways (oral, silent and subvocalizing) were compared.

Oral reading had the greatest effect on comprehension performance among the three <b>reading</b> <b>methods</b> examined. All groups reported that oral reading was the most preferred <b>reading</b> <b>method</b> with the majority of respondents feeling the style best supported comprehension. Feedback suggested that oral reading was preferred specifically because it helps in memorizing words and texts, concentration, and practicing and pronouncing words for real world encounters.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the <b>reading</b> <b>methods</b> that pedagogues, active in classes 1 - 3, use in the first stage of learning to read and how they consider their own choices of methods. In the theoretical background I sort out the basic differences between synthetic and analytic methods of acquiring the skills of reading. The analytic <b>reading</b> <b>method</b> means that the skills of reading starts with the complete text in order to later analyze the parts of the text. The synthetic method approach is based on a <b>reading</b> <b>method</b> where the parts are linked as a whole. The two methods are considered antipodes but can also be looked upon as complements in the current governing documents. In order to find the answer  to the {{purpose of this}} study a qualitative survey has been realized where the pedagogues have had the opportunity to motivate their choices of <b>reading</b> <b>methods.</b> The survey was designed in order to investigate if the pedagogues make their choices using the guidelines in the Swedish curriculum about individualized tuition. The result of the survey can be summarized as follows, the majority of the pedagogues claim that they make a conscious choice of the skills of <b>reading</b> <b>methods</b> through an individualized perspective in order to be able to meet each and every pupil’s different qualifications/conditions and needs...|$|R

40|$|In the past, many {{researchers}} {{have attempted to}} provide direc-tion {{for the improvement of}} reading instruction by focusing their efforts on discovering the most effective <b>reading</b> <b>method</b> for all students. This avenue of study has yielded contradictory results. For example, although J. Chall (1967) found that code-emphasis methods produced the best reading growth, G. L. Bond and R. Dykstra (1967), and N. Silberberg, I. Iverson, and J. Goins (1973), concluded that no single method is superior to all others. More recently educators have begun to explore and research a diagnostic-prescriptive approach to improving reading instruc-tion. After diagnostic testing, <b>reading</b> <b>methods</b> and materials are prescribed for the individual student based on that young-ster's learning strengths (Sabatino and Dorfman 1974, Spache 1976, Ekwall 1976). This shift in focus from attempts to dis-cover the best <b>reading</b> <b>method</b> for all students, toward efforts to find the most effective <b>reading</b> <b>method(s)</b> for a particular young-ster, based upon accurate diagnosis of individual needs, can have a far-reaching and positive effect on the quality of reading instruction in the future.

HeermanThis {{study is}} a {{follow-up}} to Al-Fadda's (2004) investigation of middle school teacher's perceptions {{of the importance of}} <b>reading</b> <b>methods.</b> The primary research question to be addressed in this study was: What are ELL and LD teachers' perceptions of the importance of specific reading strategies for their respective types of students? To address this question the researcher developed a survey with five demographic questions and 44 <b>reading</b> <b>methods</b> based on the framework of the COBRA model developed by Heerman (2002). The researcher administered the survey to public middle and junior high school ELL and LD teachers from Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas and compared the two groups' perceptions of the importance of several reading strategies. Analysis of the results showed that there was a 60 % agreement rate between the two teacher groups (no significant differences) for three of the COBRA goals (background knowledge, comprehension, and study and application) and a 40 % difference rate between the two teacher groups (significant differences) for two of the COBRA goals (experiential learning and vocabulary). For the 44 survey items, there was an agreement rate of 82. 82 %, and a difference rate of 17. 18 %. The researcher concludes that there were more similarities than differences between ELL teachers' and LD teachers' perceptions {{of the importance of the}} surveyed <b>reading</b> <b>methods,</b> however, there were also real differences. The researcher found justification for the belief that ELL and LD teachers should be considered specialist teachers when it comes to rating the relative importance of <b>reading</b> <b>methods.</b> ELL teachers appear to be inclined to use <b>reading</b> <b>methods</b> related to language, experience, and vocabulary methods. The results also reveal that LD teachers appear to be inclined to use <b>reading</b> <b>methods</b> related to intervention strategies with conferencing, coaching, compensatory methods, specific skills development and memory processes. In addition, the researcher noted a large number of methods with small mean differences, showing the certain levels of agreement between the two teacher groups. In terms of the five teacher variables, percentage of ELL students, percentage of low-income students and school enrollment proved to be the least active variables but the teacher variables of teachers' education levels and teachers' experience levels were more active...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper studies, from a sociological perspective, the {{historical}} and social aspects of reading as a (social and personal) practice {{in relation to the}} “place” where it is performed. This place is either in the public or private. After the terms reading practices, main <b>reading</b> <b>methods,</b> <b>reading</b> place and reading habits have been defined, the main <b>reading</b> <b>methods</b> are presented–i. e. intensive and extensive reading– and the main reading practices – i. e. out loud, whispering, silent. Then the <b>reading</b> <b>methods</b> and <b>reading</b> practices that were prevalent in each era are presented, along with the places where the act of reading usually took place. These places are as follows: primary public places or places of public reading (i. e. gathering places), public reading places or reading rooms and public libraries, semi-public places in monasteries, private domestic places and personal places. After associating the main <b>reading</b> practices and <b>methods</b> with the social and physical places where reading was performed, we ascertain that, from antiquity to the present day, we have gradually moved from public-centred to self- centred reading habits, particularly in the early 20 th century and afterwards. And this, of course, is associated with the general shift of our society from socio-centred to self-centred models...|$|R

This work aims to evaluate the performance of this measurement method, in terms of reliability, reproducibility and dependence on technical settings. METHODS: Data have been gathered from 13 clinical studies on antihypertensive drugs, using the Finapres device for measuring the response to exogenous angiotensin challenges. The agreement between simultaneous recordings at different fingers {{and the influence of}} the <b>reading</b> <b>method</b> are assessed. A literature review addresses the question of the concordance between results obtained noninvasively and through arterial cannulation. RESULTS: The relative precision of {{blood pressure}} monitoring by photoplethysmography allows reproducible determination of angiotensin-induced blood pressure peaks (agreement limits for systolic and diastolic peaks: 12 and 6 mmHg respectively). The <b>reading</b> <b>method</b> influences the results to a similar extent.

This study focused on preservice teachers' theoretical orientations to the reading process and examined the relationship of undergraduate coursework and the senior student teaching experience to these orientations. Theoretical orientations to the reading process were determined through the administration of DeFord's Theoretical Orientation to Reading Profile (TORP). Subjects included 35 undergraduate elementary education majors enrolled in <b>reading</b> <b>methods</b> courses and student teaching across three semesters, and the 35 cooperating teachers of the student subjects. Three hypotheses were tested during the five phases of the study. Hypothesis 1 examined the relationship between subjects' theoretical orientations to reading and their <b>reading</b> <b>methods</b> coursework. Hypothesis 2 focused on the student teaching experience and the theoretical orientations of the cooperating teachers. Hypothesis 3 examined changes that may have occurred in the subjects' theoretical orientations from pre-coursework to post-student teaching. Three conclusions can be drawn from the data analyses. First, {{more than half of the}} subjects in the study experienced no significant changes in theoretical orientations during the course of the study. The <b>reading</b> <b>methods</b> courses and the student teaching experience provided only a modest influence on the theoretical orientations of the preservice teachers. Second, for those students who did experience a change in theoretical orientations, the <b>reading</b> <b>methods</b> coursework appeared to have had a greater influence than did the student teaching experience. The third conclusion concerned the instrument used in the study. DeFord's Theoretical Orientation to Reading Profile was not sensitive to the nuances of instructional philosophies. Based on comments by respondents in the study, responses to TORP statements were frequently reflective of specific teaching situations rather than guided by existing philosophies or theoretical orientations...|$|R
