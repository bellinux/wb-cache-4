He <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> interview prior to the games that the trip for the children was more important than his own, and related it to being introduced to being introduced to skiing on a school trip of his own at the age of six years old.|$|E
5|$|Anup Rubens was {{selected}} to compose the film's music and background score in mid March 2013 marking his second collaboration with both Kumar and Chaitanya after Ishq (2012) and Autonagar Surya (2014) respectively. Kumar read the script to Rubens without revealing the film's cast. After Rubens accepted {{a role in the}} film, both met Nagarjuna. Rubens <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> interview that he worked for fewer days when compared to his previous works and added that Kumar had a small story to tell within every song in the film. Due to Nageswara Rao's death, a song's tune was replaced with another tune and a few lines of the song Nenu Puttanu from the film Prem Nagar (1971).|$|E
5|$|Before {{taking the}} role, Capaldi {{said that he}} had to seriously {{consider}} the increased visibility that would come with the part. He <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> interview with Entertainment Weekly that he had been invited to audition for the role of the Eighth Doctor in 1995 before the production of the 1996 TV film, but did not go because he was unsure if he would get the part and did not wish {{to be part of a}} large group of actors turned down for the role.|$|E

In fact Abhishek Bachchan was being cast as Shekhar and Saif Ali Khan as Girish. However Abhishek {{walked out of the}} project and Saif readily was accepted as a replacement. This fact was corroborated by Saif in an interview when he said that even though Sarkar had faith in his abilities, Chopra was not too keen on having him.|$|E
5|$|Critics say the MFP formula discourages {{high levels}} of local, rather than state, funding. Louisiana House Speaker Jim Tucker <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> {{interview}} with Louisiana Public Broadcasting that the MFP formula keeps districts from levying higher taxes because districts with high local taxes receive lower state funding payments. Tulane University's Cowen Institute was founded in 2007 {{to examine the effects}} of local tax initiatives on the MFP. Tara O'Neill, Cowen Institute Policy Manager, said districts receive extra incentive funding from the state when they raise high amounts of funding at the local level. O'Neill said districts get this extra money whether they tax a low tax base at a high rate or tax a healthy tax base at a low rate.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{statements}} from bandmembers, that Lamb of God planned {{to enter the}} studio in 2014 to begin recording their eighth studio album, hoping to complete it {{by the end of}} the same year, Chris Adler <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> interview with The Virginian-Pilot that besides the large amount legal fees the band encountered from Randy Blythe's trial, the band's inactivity during the trial meant no new income coming in, which eventually depleted the band's funds.|$|E

She considers the remaining band members extremely talented and wishes all the best for them and their subsequent lead singer Anette Olzon.|$|E
5|$|Development of Jedi Knight {{was led by}} Justin Chin, who {{had also}} worked on the {{previous}} game. The most significant developments for Jedi Knight are the use of The Force and the lightsaber. The Force plays an integral role in how the player plays the game and shapes the way the game is played. The method of allocating credits to Force powers was designed with a role-playing video game style in mind, allowing the player the choice of which powers to improve. Chin <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> early interview that progress in the game {{is based upon the}} abilities the player develops.|$|E

He added that two types of camera– the Alexa XT and the Red Dragon– were being used to film a number of mild movement shots throughout the film. On 17June 2015, Siva told the media that all filming except for a week of patchwork was finished. By then, a song sequence focusing on the lead pair was being filmed at Ramoji Film City.|$|E

A joint official investigation by the United Kingdom and the United States later concluded that her fatal injuries were inflicted by a grenade thrown by one of her rescuers. A February 2011 coroner's narrative verdict reported that Norgrove died during the failed rescue attempt. In October 2012, one of her colleagues <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> interview that the captors had told Norgrove that they had no intention of killing her.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the first}} two {{installments}} of the Final Destination series, Final Destination 3 was shot in Vancouver.

The cast members often rehearsed with each other for better on-screen chemistry. Filming concluded in July but due to negative reception towards the ending in early screenings, a new ending sequence featuring a subway train derailment was filmed in November.|$|E

Jagannadh did not cast Brahmanandam and Ali because of Mahesh's specific characterisation; he added that Mahesh's voice had changed when compared to his performance in Pokiri. Mahesh also convinced Jagannadh to give up smoking, since he himself was trying to give up after being a chain smoker.|$|E
5|$|Morrison {{took three}} years to release a {{follow-up}} album. After a decade without taking time off, he <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> interview, {{he needed to get}} away from music completely and ceased listening to it for several months. Also suffering from writer's block, he seriously considered leaving the music business for good. Speculation that an extended jam session would be released either under the title Mechanical Bliss, or Naked in the Jungle, or Stiff Upper Lip, came to nothing, and Morrison's next album was A Period of Transition in 1977, a collaboration with Dr. John, who had appeared at The Last Waltz concert with Morrison in 1976. The album received a mild critical reception and marked the beginning of a very prolific period of song making.|$|E
