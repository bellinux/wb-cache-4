25|$|On December 9, 2016, Obama {{ordered the}} U.S. Intelligence Community to {{investigate}} Russian {{interference in the}} election and report before he left office on January 20, 2017. U.S. Homeland Security Advisor and chief counterterrorism advisor to the president Lisa Monaco announced the study, and said foreign intrusion into a U.S. election was unprecedented and would necessitate investigation by subsequent administrations. The intelligence analysis would cover malicious cyberwarfare occurring between the 2008 and 2016 elections. CNN reported that an unnamed <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> <b>official</b> {{told them that the}} White House was confident Russia interfered in the election. The official said the order by President Obama would be a lessons learned report, with options including sanctions and covert cyber response against Russia.|$|E

2500|$|Clinton Administration {{officials}} told the New York Times that US support for Suharto was [...] "driven by a potent mix of power politics and emerging markets." [...] Suharto was Washington's favoured {{ruler of the}} [...] "ultimate emerging market" [...] who deregulated the economy and opened Indonesia to foreign investors.

2500|$|The Boston Globe quoted an {{anonymous}} <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> <b>official</b> saying, [...] "Of course {{the president has}} the obligation to follow this law, (but) he also has the obligation to defend and protect the country as the commander in chief, and he will have to square those two responsibilities in each case. We are not expecting that those two responsibilities will come into conflict, but it's possible that they will".|$|E
2500|$|The 2007 NIE report, contradicted the {{previous}} 2005 NIE conclusion which asserted that Iran had {{an active and}} on-going nuclear weapons program in 2005. According to a <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> <b>official,</b> in a January 2008 conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Israeli and other foreign officials asked President Bush to explain the 2007 NIE. Bush [...] "told the Israelis that he can't control what the intelligence community says, but that (the NIE's) conclusions don't reflect his own views". After Bush seemed {{to distance himself from}} the report, the White House later said Bush endorses the [...] "full scope" [...] of the US intelligence findings on Iran.|$|E
50|$|In June 2008, the GCBDP {{organised}} a fast-unto-death hunger strike, {{demanding the}} release of Bangshibadan Barman and 55 other followers of the party (who had been arrested at a 2005 GCPA meeting).

50|$|Murder at 1600 (1997), {{starring}} Wesley Snipes. <b>Senior</b> <b>administration</b> <b>officials</b> {{and military}} leaders attempt to engineer {{the resignation of the}} President.

2500|$|On October 20, 2010, the US State Department {{notified}} Congress of {{its intention}} to make the biggest arms sale in American history—an estimated $60.5 billion purchase by Saudi Arabia, trumping the former US-Saudi AWACS sale. The package represents a considerable improvement in the offensive capability of the Saudi armed forces. Israel did not raise objections to the sale, {{except to say that}} it was [...] "not thrilled about it." [...] At the time, a <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> <b>official</b> stressed: [...] "This is a big development, because it's part of a larger regional strategy and the maintenance of a strong US presence in the region. We're paying attention to the needs of our allies and what everyone in the region believes is a flexing of muscles by a more aggressive Iran. One way to deal with that is to make our allies and friends strong." ...|$|E
2500|$|Israeli {{officials}} said the British informed them Friday {{that they would be}} withdrawing the monitoring team but did not provide a date. U.S. {{officials said}} the Israelis and the Palestinians were notified as the three British guards on duty at the time departed. Stuart Tuttle, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, said that [...] "The withdrawal decision was made on the ground and not in coordination with the Israelis". Senior U.S. {{officials said the}}y {{had no choice but to}} abandon the facility, even though they realized it might undermine the Palestinian Authority, and that they did not make public their concerns because they believed publicity would have made the U.S. and British personnel the targets of attacks. A <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> <b>official</b> said: [...] "That is the price we pay. Our first responsibility is the safety of American and British monitors". State Department spokesman J. Adam Ereli denied any coordination with Israel and said: [...] "Such accusations are baseless and ignore the facts, quite frankly".|$|E
2500|$|On July 3, 2009, he {{reportedly}} traveled to Pakistan and {{is believed to}} have visited Peshawar, often a gateway for foreign visitors to join up with jihadist groups in the militant-occupied Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), and stayed there from July 7 to July 22. Peshawar's legacy for blackmarket terror goes back to the Soviet–Afghan War when it was a center for the Mujahideen parties and their US & Gulf patrons. The Center for Strategic and International Studies describes the FATA as: [...] "ground zero in the U.S. Jihadist war, and home to many al-Qaeda operatives, especially the numerous foreigners from the Arab world, Central Asia Muslim areas of the Far East, and even Europe who flock to this war zone for training [...] indoctrination." [...] A <b>senior</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>official</b> said it appears he had an attack in mind when he went there, and he went there seeking help for the attack.|$|E
5000|$|... "There's {{plenty of}} {{blame to go}} around. The main {{problem was that the}} <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> <b>officials</b> have what I call faith-based {{intelligence}}. They knew what they wanted the intelligence to show. They were really blind and deaf to any kind of countervailing information the intelligence community would produce. I would assign some blame to the intelligence community and most of the blame to the <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> officials." ...|$|R

5000|$|In addition, the Reagan {{administration}} {{criticized the}} elections because Arturo Cruz, the candidate nominated by the Coordinadora Democrática Nicaragüense, refused to run. However, the U.S. reportedly urged Cruz to avoid participation. Several <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> <b>officials</b> told the New York Times that [...] "the administration never contemplated letting Cruz {{stay in the}} race because then the Sandinistas could justifiably claim that the elections were legitimate".|$|R
2500|$|I {{was curious}} why a {{high-ranking}} official in President Bill Clinton's National Security Council (NSC) was given this assignment. Wilson {{had become a}} vocal opponent of President Bush's policies in Iraq after contributing to Al Gore {{in the last election}} cycle and John Kerry in this one. During a long conversation with a <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> <b>official,</b> I asked why Wilson was assigned the mission to Niger. He said Wilson had been sent by the CIA's counter-proliferation section at the suggestion of one of its employees, his wife. It was an offhand revelation from this official, who is no partisan gunslinger. When I called another official for confirmation, he said: [...] "Oh, you know about it." [...] The published report that somebody in the White House failed to plant this story with six reporters and finally found me as a willing pawn is simply untrue. At the CIA, the official designated to talk to me denied that Wilson's wife had inspired his selection but said she was delegated to request his help. He asked me not to use her name, saying she probably never again will be given a foreign assignment but that exposure of her name might cause [...] "difficulties" [...] if she travels abroad. He never suggested to me that Wilson's wife or anybody else would be endangered. If he had, I would not have used her name. I used it in the sixth paragraph of my column because it looked like the missing explanation of an otherwise incredible choice by the CIA for its mission.|$|E

2500|$|Wilson {{never worked}} for the CIA, but his wife, Valerie Plame, is an agency {{operative}} on weapons of mass destruction. Two <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> <b>officials</b> told me that Wilson's wife suggested sending him to Niger to investigate the Italian report. The CIA says its counter-proliferation officials selected Wilson and asked his wife to contact him. [...] "I will not answer any question about my wife," [...] Wilson told me.|$|R
50|$|He {{maintains}} {{close relationships}} with numerous {{members of the}} United States Congress, <b>senior</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>officials</b> and leaders in the international community, including a number of heads of state and government.

50|$|<b>Senior</b> <b>administration</b> <b>officials</b> {{said the}} new policy {{is based on the}} theory that Iran will back down from its nuclear ambitions if the United States hits it hard in Iraq and elsewhere, {{creating}} a sense of vulnerability among Iranian leaders.

However, on December 21, 2006, the US military detained two Iranian diplomats in Baghdad for alleged weapons smuggling and released them on December 29, 2006.|$|R

50|$|In 1974 Ziegler became Assistant to the President.
