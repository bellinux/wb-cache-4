50|$|Upon {{receiving}} the package, the client will download appropriate metadata, and possibly (dependent on both package and client configurations) {{some or all}} of the package components. The client is designed to utilize a <b>streaming</b> <b>file</b> system that operates much like local file paging activity. This allows for starting the application without all of the file(s) present in the cache locally. When the application requires a file portion not present, an operation called a stream-fault is performed that retrieves the needed file portion. The streamed package contents are cached by the client in memory for the duration of the application session, and may be retained in a local disk cache for future use.|$|E

There are inefficiencies as well: if a file is present in just one tree, it is still retrieved by the command, although all its contents will be discarded.|$|E

30|$|Broadcast and {{multicast}} offer {{a significant}} improvement of spectrum utilization, and become particularly important where information channels are shared among several users. Mobile cellular environments are expected to evolve with the technological approaches necessary to facilitate the deployment of multimedia services, such as <b>streaming,</b> <b>file</b> download, and carousel services. The perspective that video streaming in wireless networks services is an attractive service to end-users has spurred the research in this area. To provide for a video delivery platform in UMTS, the third generation partnership project (3 GPP) addressed this problem {{with the introduction of}} the multimedia broadcast and multicast services (MBMS) in 3 GPP Release 6. In this document we analyse several effective radio resource management techniques to provide MBMS, namely, use of nonuniform QAM constellations, multicode, and macrodiversity to guarantee the optimal distribution of QoS depending on the location of mobiles.|$|E
