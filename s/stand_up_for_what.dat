At one {{particular}} monument, she overhears a corrupt congressman, Bob Arnold, taking a bribe from {{a representative of}} a logging industry to demolish Springfield Forest. Heartbroken and disillusioned by the dishonesty of government officials, Lisa tears up her essay and writes a more painful yet truthful essay to show the patriotic judges. The new essay, entitled [...] "Cesspool on the Potomac", disdains and condemns the government system of corruption and greed, and mentions {{the names of those}} involved in the bribery. Lisa's essay causes a ruckus and elicits a hostile reaction from the judges and audience. Messages are quickly sent around the capital regarding Lisa's speech and Arnold is expelled from his job, arrested and sent to prison. Lisa's essay does not win because of its content, but with the news of arresting the congressman and having become a born-again Christian while in prison, her faith in government is restored, while the contest winner commends Lisa for her courage and honesty. The episode ends with Bart slingshotting the annoying pianist that performed at the contest and he tells Lisa that {{she was the one who}} inspired him to <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> he believes in.|$|E

These women were unafraid to <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> they believed in and refused to back down from the long and tedious [...] "battle". [...] Murray continued her praise for black women when she stated that [...] "...one cannot help asking: would the Negro struggle have come this far without the indomitable determination of its women?" [...] The [...] "Negro struggle" [...] was able to progress partly because of [...] "...the indomitable determination of its women." [...] African-American women were vital to the Civil Rights Movement and pushed it forward with their own might. They were just as important to the black struggle for racial justice as their male counterparts. Their work ethic and persistence defined African-American women as important to a long fight against racism in America.|$|E
