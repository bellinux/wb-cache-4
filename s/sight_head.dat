5|$|With the CSBS the {{sighting}} system and calculator {{were the same}} device, which required the bombsight to be fairly large. With this restriction removed, the <b>sight</b> <b>head</b> was much smaller and lighter than the older versions. The resulting <b>sight</b> <b>head</b> was easy to mount on a stabilizer system, adapted from the same Sperry gyroscope as earlier experiments. With the <b>sight</b> <b>head</b> stabilized, the bomb aimer could continue to measure drift even as he indicated turns to the pilot, eliminating the need to correct, re-measure and correct again. The remote console and second operator eliminated {{the need for the}} bomb aimer to look away from the sights, to make adjustments while on the bomb run. As a result of these changes, short aiming periods of a few seconds would be enough for an accurate drop.|$|E
5|$|As the Mk. XIV could {{calculate}} {{the effects of}} a shallow climb or dive (or glide as it is referred to in bombing), the computor included its own levelling mechanism. This was added to the range angle calculated by the computor to move the <b>sight</b> <b>head.</b> Levelling the system required adjustment of both the computor and the <b>sight</b> <b>head.</b> Since these were in a fixed relationship to each other, levelling could be carried out on the ground and then left alone. Any adjustments required were recorded on a card fixed {{to the front of the}} computor.|$|E
5|$|As the {{computor}} {{held the}} level line and was sending angle commands to the sight, it eliminated {{the need for}} a two-axis gyro in the sighting head itself. The gyro on the <b>sight</b> <b>head</b> only adjusted for rotation of the aircraft around its roll axis.|$|E
5|$|The Mk. XIV {{consisted}} of two independent parts, the <b>sighting</b> <b>head</b> and the computor. The <b>sighting</b> <b>head</b> was located in the bomb aimer's window {{at the front of}} the aircraft. The separate computor cabinet was assembled with the operating knobs positioned on the right side of the case, so it had to be placed on the left side of the fuselage. The two were connected via two flexible cable drives.|$|R
50|$|The Mk. III used {{a number}} of {{components}} from the Mk. XIV, as well as much of its basic layout. Like the Mk. XIV, the Mk. III was built in two separate components, the computor that calculated the range angle, and the <b>sighting</b> <b>head</b> that displayed this for the bomb aimer. The <b>sighting</b> <b>head</b> was located in the bomb aimer's window {{at the front of}} the aircraft. The separate computor cabinet was positioned on the left side of the fuselage, and two units were connected via an electrical cable.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinder}} {{was also}} connected to an electrical mechanism that output a varying current {{based on the}} settings. This was fed into a motor on the <b>sighting</b> <b>head.</b> The motor was calibrated to turn at a fixed speed depending on the output fed to it from the computor. The motor turned a ring with lines inscribed on it, positioned {{in front of a}} projector system. The entire mechanism was housed on a large triangular case on the left of the <b>sighting</b> <b>head,</b> which was the primary mechanical difference between it and the Mk. XIV, which lacked this projector.|$|R
5|$|The inputs {{operated}} by the bomb-aimer's mate drove a mechanical calculator inside the console, or computor. The output of the calculator drove flexible shafts that rotated the <b>sight</b> <b>head</b> to the proper angles in azimuth and altitude, representing the wind drift and range angle. The <b>sight</b> <b>head</b> replaced the older wire crosshairs with a modern reflector sight that {{was easy to see}} at night. The sight could be rotated manually to view objects well in front of the aircraft, allowing the bomb aimer to select among a wider variety of objects to use for drift measurements.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the bomb}} run {{the pilot was}} {{directed}} to fly the aircraft in several different directions in sequence, preferably about 120 degrees apart. On each leg, the bomb aimer used the reticle to measure the drift angle, either by rotating the wind direction dial on the computor to get the <b>sight</b> <b>head</b> to the right angle, or by unlocking the azimuth control from the computor and turning the sight manually. The drift angle was whatever angle the <b>sight</b> <b>head</b> was pointing when objects on the ground could {{be seen to be}} moving along the line on the sight. Once measured, the angle of the aircraft and the angle of the drift (measured either from the dial on the computor or the scale on the sight) were recorded. Using the Mk. III Navigation Computor, the RAF's version of the modern E6B, the three sets of angles were entered on the wind calculator face. This normally resulted in a small triangular area forming where the three lines came close to meeting, and the centre of this triangle revealed the wind speed and direction. This value was then entered into the computor.|$|E
5|$|Although {{existing}} sources do not record {{when the}} Mk. XIV went into {{production in the}} UK, they do record that operational testing started in January 1942 and production examples started reaching squadrons in March. It was manufactured by small machine shops and instrument makers, such as the Aron Meter Company. Production was too slow to meet the demand; between July and October, fewer than a hundred a month were being delivered. As the design was finalized, automated production was undertaken and by mid-1943, 900 a month were available. This was enough to equip the heavy bombers as they arrived from the production lines and by late 1942 the Handley Page Halifax was being delivered with the <b>sight</b> <b>head</b> already installed.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: The Low Level Bombsight Mk. III {{consisted}} of two parts, the computor, and the <b>sighting</b> <b>head,</b> shown here. The bomb aimer looked through the glass plates to see an image of moving horizontal lines, and released the bombs when their motion matched {{the motion of the}} target.|$|R
5000|$|Information was {{relayed to}} the Japanese that two British {{destroyer}} squadrons had been <b>sighted</b> <b>heading</b> towards them. Again, they reversed course {{to return to}} the Malacca Strait. This change had been anticipated, however, and the 26th Destroyer Flotilla ( [...] , , , , and [...] ), commanded by Captain Manley Laurence Power (in Saumarez) steamed to intercept.|$|R
5|$|The two {{companies}} made some basic {{changes to the}} design {{to make it easier}} to produce and a final design was ready in May 1942. The Sperry T-1 was fully compatible with UK-built versions and a T-1 computer could be used with a Mk. XIV <b>sight</b> <b>head</b> or vice versa. Full production commenced at the AC plant in Flint, Michigan, in November and T-1s arrived in the UK from March 1943. The sights were sent to medium bombers like the Wellington, while UK-built versions were sent to the heavy bombers. In August 1943, George Mann of AC Spark Plug visited the UK for a period of about a year, liaising with RAE Farnborough, Boscombe Down and the Ministry of Aircraft Production.|$|E
500|$|The <b>sight</b> <b>head</b> {{was mounted}} {{on top of}} a square platform, with screw {{adjustments}} {{that could be used to}} level the platform. A spirit level on the sight allowed it to be checked. The normally periodic and minor changes required to level the sighting head could be performed by removing the cover over the [...] spirit level and then turning a small adjusting screw on the mount. Pressing the release lever unlocked the sighting head from the mounting shaft on the left of the platform, allowing the sight to be removed and then re-attached simply by sliding it back onto the shaft, maintaining the level setting between missions.|$|E
500|$|The Mk. XV was {{a version}} {{designed}} for the Royal Navy and Coastal Command for attacking submarines. As these operations took place at low altitudes, even small changes of altitude air pressure could lead to large errors in calculations. The Mk. XV allowed the altitude input to be taken directly from a radar altimeter, eliminating these inaccuracies and any instrument lag. The Mk. XVII was a Mk. XV modified for the very high attack speeds of the Naval Mosquito at more than [...] As the Naval Mosquito {{did not have a}} bomb aimer's position, the <b>sight</b> <b>head</b> was unstabilized and mounted in front of the pilot.|$|E
25|$|The Norden bombsight {{consisted}} of two primary parts, the gyroscopic stabilization platform on the left side, and the mechanical calculator and <b>sighting</b> <b>head</b> on the right side. They were essentially separate instruments, connecting through the sighting prism. The sighting eyepiece was located in the middle, between the two, in a less than convenient location that required some dexterity to use.|$|R
50|$|First, {{the manual}} {{calculator}} {{was replaced by}} an external box operated by a new crew member. The box contained the inputs needed to drive the vector calculator, as well as copies of the various aircraft instruments displaying required information. The operator simply had to keep the input dials set so their indicators overlapped those on the instruments. This drove the machine to calculate the correct angles, as on the earlier CSBS models, and fed them directly into a remote sighting unit, the <b>sighting</b> <b>head.</b> This provided practically instant updates of the sighting angles. The wire sights of the earlier models were replaced by reflector sights indicating the location the bombs would hit if dropped at that instant. As the <b>sighting</b> <b>head</b> lacked the vector computer it was much smaller than earlier models, which allowed it to be easily mounted on a stabilized platform. This allowed the sights to be used even while the aircraft was maneuvering, and required only 10 seconds to settle.|$|R
50|$|At 15:00 {{the first}} CH-53s were <b>sighted</b> <b>heading</b> towards the DAO Compound at Tan Son Nhut. Major Kean {{contacted}} the Seventh Fleet to advise them of his airlift requirements, {{until that time}} the fleet believed that all evacuees had been bussed from the embassy to the DAO Compound and that only 2 helicopters {{would be required to}} evacuate the Ambassador and the Marines from the embassy.|$|R

5000|$|On 1 February 1943, a large {{force of}} Japanese destroyers was <b>sighted</b> <b>heading</b> for [...] "Ironbottom Sound." [...] Tracy, as task group leader, led [...] and [...] in laying {{a field of}} 300 mines between Doma Reef and Cape Esperance. That night, [...] struck one of these mines and was damaged so badly that she was scuttled. Nevertheless, the Japanese managed to extricate their {{garrison}} from Guadalcanal.|$|R
5|$|Reflector sights as {{aircraft}} gun-sights {{have many}} advantages. The pilot/gunner need not position their head to align the sight line precisely {{as they did}} in two-point mechanical <b>sights,</b> <b>head</b> position is only limited to that determined by the optics in the collimator, mostly by the diameter of the collimator lens. The sight does not interfere with the overall view, particularly when the collimator light is turned off. Both eyes may be used simultaneously for sighting.|$|R
50|$|A vector bombsight {{where the}} bomb aimer input {{details of the}} bombload, target {{altitude}} and wind direction and the analogue computer then continuously calculated the trajectory of the bombs and projected an inverted sword shape onto a sighting glass on the <b>sighting</b> <b>head.</b> Assuming the <b>sight</b> was set correctly, when the target was in the cross hairs of the sword shape, the bomb aimer {{would be able to}} accurately release the bombs.|$|R
