40|$|The {{motivation}} {{for the creation of}} PIT metal gate PMOS process transistors was to investigate and prove the work function of molybdenum can be changed through reactive sputtering and thermal processing. The <b>existing</b> <b>PIT</b> metal gate PMOS process was adapted to form Molybdenum and Molybdenum-Nitride PMOS transistors. Processing of the molybdenum films affected the final composition of the gate electrode and ultimately its work function. Through theoretical and real analysis, the work functions of Mo and MoN gates were extracted and compared with one another as well as to Al. Examination of the extracted work functions revealed the presence of other phenomena accountable for 1. 5 - 2. 0 V shift in Vt from one gate type to another. While no single mechanism is identified as the source of extra charge, contamination of the Mo/SiO 2 interface, oxidation of the Mo, work function difference, or some combination of all three are likely to explain the shifts in threshold voltages...|$|R

Our main result is a new randomized algorithm that tests whether two given polynomials are shift equivalent. Our algorithm runs in time polynomial in the circuit size of the polynomials, {{to which it is}} given black box access. This complements a previous work of Grigoriev [Gri 97] who gave a deterministic algorithm running in time nO(d) for degree d polynomials. Our algorithm uses randomness only to solve instances of the Polynomial Identity Testing (PIT) problem. Hence, if one could de-randomize PIT (a long-standing open problem in complexity) a de-randomization of our algorithm would follow. This establishes an equivalence between de-randomizing shift-equivalence testing and de-randomizing PIT (both in the black-box and the white-box setting).

Using primary household survey data and microbiological water test for Escherichia coli, we use various estimation methods to quantify the impacts of water quality and sanitation behavior on diarrhea incidence among children under five years old. Our results show that uncontaminated household storage water and safe child stool disposal decrease incidence of child diarrhea by 16 % and 23 % respectively. In contrast, neighborhood concentration of pit latrine increases incidence of child diarrhea by 12 %. The latter result casts serious doubt on the assumed health and social benefits of moving from open to fixed-location defecation. Creating open defecation free communities in rural areas {{is not enough to}} achieve the desired health benefits of sanitation. To protect rural households from the risk of contracting communicable diseases, <b>existing</b> <b>pit</b> latrines should be upgraded to make them safer to use - fly-proofed and hygienic. There is a need for appropriate policy actions to improve household drinking water quality and to change people's behavior towards safe sanitation practices. Increasing access to clean water supply and providing means for safe excreta disposal will bring significant health and social gains. Moreover, promotion of hygiene education campaigns about household water treatment, safe water storage and handling, washing hands with soaps at critical times, and adequately removing child feces from the domestic environment can also help ensure that people preserve good health in their household and their community...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the current practices of segregation approaches, storage arrangements, collection and disposal {{systems in the}} teaching hospitals of Karachi. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in eight teaching hospitals of Karachi, using convenient sam-pling technique. The instrument of research was a self administered questionnaire, with four sections, relating to the general information of the institution, administrative information, information regarding Health Waste Management personnel and a check-list of Hospital Waste Management activities. Results: Out of eight hospitals visited 2 (25 %) were segregating sharps, pathological waste, chemical, infec-tious, pharmaceutical and pressurized containers at source. For handling potentially dangerous waste, two (25 %) hospitals provided essential protective gears to its waste handlers. Only one (12. 5 %) hospital arranged training sessions for its waste handling staff regularly. Five (62. 5 %) hospitals had storage areas but mostly it was not protected from access of scavengers. Five (62. 5 %) hospitals disposed off their hazardous waste by burning in incinerators, two (25 %) disposed off by municipal landfills and one (12. 5 %) was burning waste in open air with-out any specific treatment. No record of waste was generally maintained. Only two (25 %) hospitals had well doc-umented guidelines for waste management and a proper waste management team.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{some aspects}} ofthe {{processes involved in}} the development of high-quality probabilistic models for corrosion loss and for maximum pit depth for steels exposed to marine environments. Such models increasingly are required for advanced infrastructure life-cycle management to predict likely future levels of deterioration and for the setting of rational inspection regimes. Most models currently available are empirical. They have high levels of uncertainty. The models described herein are based on appropriate levels of representation of underlying corrosion science fundamentals, including the recognition of the important role of microbiological activity and model calibration using a probabilistic approach to data interpretation. This requires careful interpretation of existing literature data and has required obtaining new data to elucidate particular aspects. A brief overview of this work is given with emphasis on the modeling of maximum pit depth using extreme value distributions. Reinterpretation of <b>existing</b> <b>pit</b> depth data was found to be necessary for consistency with new observations of pit depth development in actual in-situ tests (as distinct from laboratory observations). As a result, the new model provides maximum pit depth as a function of time based on understanding of the underlying pitting process with time. It has shown also that long-term pit depth is most appropriately represented by the Frechet extreme value distribution since {{this is consistent with the}} underlying corrosion and bacterial processes. This new interpretation of data provides estimates of pit depth uncertainty as a function of exposure time. It is shown that this can be applied even for existing data sources that were not designed to elucidate probabilistic estimates of uncertainty. The conventional application of the Gumbel extreme value distribution can lead to serious errors in long-term extreme pit depth predictions...|$|R
