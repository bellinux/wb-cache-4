At first, heat exchange experiment {{has been done in}} the case when the spring fin has been inserted as extended heat exchange surface into the heat exchange channel. Within the experimental ranges studied, the small diameter spring achieves the largest heat exchange performance with the smallest pressure loss penalty. Especially, an optimum <b>spring</b> <b>pitch</b> may exist at the p/d value less than 10. Such a desirable spring fin shows large heat exchange performance than inner fin and louvered fin elements. Secondly, an experimental set-up based on the unsteady method that can quickly evaluate the heat transfer performance has been explained. Thirdly, new idea of dynamic heat exchanger unit based on an impinging jet has been introduced...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Physics, Washington State UniversityFluid-filled springs are {{capillary}} {{channels that}} can be used as liquid acquisition devices to passively separate two-phase systems in microgravity. However, these channels must be primed and connected to a pressure reservoir with the desired fluid in order to take advantage of their separating abilities. Several experiments were developed to connect a low-pressure reservoir to a test section consisting of two manifolds bridged by water-filled springs in order to support drop absorption and capillary pumping back to the low-pressure reservoir during brief periods microgravity. Microgravity experiments include the use of both parabolic flights and drop towers, where both droplet absorption at varying Weber number and system priming is examined. In addition, several 1 -g experiments were conducted to investigate other import variable including impact parameter, channel pressure, and <b>spring</b> <b>pitch.</b> Washington State University, Physic...|$|E
40|$|The {{transmission}} of acoustic waves through a fuel rod (in {{the part of}} the tube without UO 2 pellets) may be used to measure the pressure and composition of the fission gas accumulating in the rod. But precise measurements can be obtained only if the effect of the coil spring placed inside the tube can be corrected. We are presenting an experimental and theoretical study of the disturbance of the standing waves inside the tube cavity, due to the presence of an helical spring. We show that at high frequency, the coherent diffraction can be neglected, and the scattering by the spring wires reduces as a simple shadowing effect. Moreover, the reflecting surface of the wires scatters the waves incoherently, and enlarges the observed resonances, acting as an additional loss mechanism. The factor called coherent transmission can be used to quantify all the scattering effects. An analytical expression for this factor is given, which fits correctly the effect of the <b>spring</b> <b>pitch...</b>|$|E

40|$|Spring {{actuators}} {{are essential}} components in vehicles {{as they are}} used for climate control, braking ventilation, engine control and fuel management. However, commercially available spring actuators are heavy and expensive {{and need to be}} replaced by lower-weight SMA spring actuators. Potential applications of the particularly promising NiTi shape memory alloys (SMA) in automotive spring actuators is currently limited due to low awareness. Recently, laser processing has been used to make processing monolithic NiTi wires more flexible than ever by locally changing the wire composition to achieve multiple functional properties. Using laser-processing to add multiple memories in a monolithic NiTi spring wire would allow for the fabrication of a novel self-biasing spring actuator which would lead to lower equipment costs, reduced weight and enhanced flexibility. To obtain a successful self-biasing spring, processing and spring fabrication techniques for NiTi wires need to be studied. The first part of the study involved investigating the effect of incrementing the number of laser pulses per spot and post-processing heat treatment temperatures on the composition of Ni- 49. 2 at. % Ti SMA wires. This was achieved by performing Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) analysis and observing the shift in phase transformation temperatures. Results revealed that increasing the number of laser pulses increased the transformation temperatures up to a point at which the samples become Ti-rich and there is negligible effect on composition. Heat treatment study showed that heat treatment temperature {{had a significant impact on}} the transformation temperature peaks resulting in distinct peaks for base material and laser-processed samples. Mechanical properties of different heat-treated samples were examined using tensile test plots to determine the optimal heat treatment temperature for shape-setting springs. In the second part of the study, the effect of spring geometry on spring force and the effect of incorporating multiple memory in a spring actuator was studied. A unique spring-shape setting fixture was used to fabricate springs with consistent <b>spring</b> <b>pitch</b> and diameter. Results showed that increasing the <b>spring</b> <b>pitch</b> and decreasing the mean coil diameter increased the spring force, which conforms to the established spring force equation. Incorporating multiple memories in a monolithic spring enabled thermally-induced self-biasing spring actuation due to various austenitic transformation temperatures triggering unique functional properties...|$|E
40|$|The proper {{functioning}} of many organs and tissues containing smooth muscles greatly {{depends on the}} intricate organization of the smooth muscle cells oriented in appropriate directions. Consequently controlling the cellular orientation in three-dimensional (3 D) cellular constructs {{is an important issue}} in engineering tissues of smooth muscles. However, the ability to precisely control the cellular orientation at the microscale cannot be achieved by various commonly used 3 D tissue engineering building blocks such as spheroids. This paper presents the formation of coiled spring-shaped 3 D cellular constructs containing circumferentially oriented smooth muscle-like cells differentiated from dedifferentiated fat (DFAT) cells. By using the cell fiber technology, DFAT cells suspended in a mixture of extracellular proteins possessing an optimized stiffness were encapsulated in the core region of alginate shell microfibers and uniformly aligned to the longitudinal direction. Upon differentiation induction to the smooth muscle lineage, DFAT cell fibers self-assembled to coiled spring structures where the cells became circumferentially oriented. By changing the initial core-shell microfiber diameter, we demonstrated that the <b>spring</b> <b>pitch</b> and diameter could be controlled. 21 days after differentiation induction, the cell fibers contained high percentages of ASMA-positive and calponin-positive cells. Our technology to create these smooth muscle-like spring constructs enabled precise control of cellular alignment and orientation in 3 D. These constructs can further serve as tissue engineering building blocks for larger organs and cellular implants used in clinical treatments...|$|E

30|$|Two main options {{exist to}} {{manipulate}} Eqs. (7) and (8) to meet iso-elasticity and adaptability requirements. These are adjustable spring constants or a novel geometry, respectively. In [16], variable stiffness springs are used, which allows adjustment {{of the point}} of equilibration. The design {{is based on a}} nut with pitch equal to the spring. By changing the location of the nut {{along the length of the}} spring, sections of the spring are inactivated. This is a viable solution if the adjustment can be made while the spring is not elongated. For variable loaded springs (i.e. variable elongated <b>springs),</b> the <b>pitch</b> changes and therefore the adjustment of the stiffness is not easily possible.|$|R
