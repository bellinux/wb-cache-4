[...] "The problem now [...] is whether or not, assuming the Japanese do not capitulate, to continue dropping them every time one is made and shipped out there or whether to hold them... and then pour them all on in a reasonably short time. Not all in one day, but over a short period. And that also takes into consideration the target that we are after. In other words, <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>not</b> concentrate on targets that will be of the greatest assistance to an invasion rather than industry, morale, psychology, and the like? Nearer the tactical use rather than other use." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wilson, {{a disciple}} of Walter Bagehot, {{considered}} the United States Constitution to be cumbersome {{and open to}} corruption. Wilson favored a parliamentary system for the United States {{and in the early}} 1880s wrote, [...] "I ask you to put this question to yourselves, <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>not</b> draw the Executive and Legislature closer together? <b>Should</b> <b>we</b> <b>not,</b> on the one hand, give the individual leaders of opinion in Congress a better chance to have an intimate party in determining who should be president, and the president, on the other hand, a better chance to approve himself a statesman, and his advisers capable men of affairs, in the guidance of Congress." ...|$|E

Oppression makes wise men mad; but their distemper {{is still the}} madness of the wise, which {{is better than the}} sobriety of fools. Their cry is the voice of sacred misery, exalted not into wild raving, but into the sanctified phrensy of prophecy and inspiration - in that bitterness of soul, in that indignation of suffering virtue, in the exaltation of despair, would not persecuted English loyalty cry out, with an awful warning voice, and denounce the destruction that waits on Monarchs? ...|$|E

50|$|Many medieval {{philosophers}} {{made use}} {{of the idea of}} approaching a knowledge of God through negative attributes. For example, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> say that God exists in the usual sense of the term, all we can safely say is that God is <b>not</b> nonexistent. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> say that God is wise, but we can say that God is not ignorant (i.e. in some way God has some properties of knowledge). <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> say that God is One, but we can state that there is no multiplicity in God's being.|$|R
2500|$|Why then <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>not</b> {{much more}} {{say in the}} Supper, [...] "This is my body", even though bread and body are two {{distinct}} substances, and the word [...] "this" [...] indicates the bread? Here, too, out of two kinds of objects a union has taken place, which I shall call a [...] "sacramental union", because Christ's body and the bread are given {{to us as a}} sacrament. This is not a natural or personal union, {{as is the case with}} God and Christ. It is also perhaps a different union from that which the dove has with the Holy Spirit, and the flame with the angel, but it is also assuredly a sacramental union.|$|E

[...] If Generals Feng and Wang do not cease military operations now, after saving China's military honour, the overall situation in China {{will once again}} worsen. [...] It is very dangerous to send an army deep into a strange country, and nothing is certain in warfare. [...] Even if we are successful, Vietnam {{does not belong to}} us. [...] But Taiwan is a part of China. [...] If money and reinforcements fail to get through to Taiwan, we will lose it and never get it back. [...] It will then be difficult both to fight on and to make peace, so why should we consider it? [...] Why <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>not</b> end the war now, after having won a victory? ...|$|E
2500|$|Rabbah {{interpreted}} [...] {{to report}} that Caleb won the people over with his words, for he saw that when Joshua began to address them, they disparaged Joshua for failing to have children. So Caleb took a different tack and asked, [...] "Is this all that Amram's son [...] has done to us?" [...] And as they thought that Caleb was about to disparage Moses, they fell silent. Then Caleb said, [...] "He brought us out of Egypt, divided the sea, and fed us manna. If he were to ask us to get ladders and climb to heaven, <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>not</b> obey?

2500|$|Summing {{up while}} {{alluding}} to the politically motivated attacks that prevented Hunt's fuller acceptance as a major literary figure in his time, Hazlitt draws a comparison with certain gentleman-poets of an earlier age, integrating this with what he has noted of Hunt's personal vanity: [...] "We have said that Lord Byron is a sublime coxcomb: why <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>not</b> say that Mr. Hunt is a delightful one? ... He is the only poet or literary man we ever knew who puts us in mind of Sir John Suckling or Killigrew or Carew; or who united rare intellectual acquirements with outward grace and natural gentility. ... A wit and a poet, Mr. Hunt is also distinguished by fineness of tact and sterling sense: he has only been a visionary in humanity, the fool of virtue." [...] And here Hazlitt brings in {{the main reason for}} the hostile politically oriented attacks on him in Tory periodicals, his notorious criticism of the Prince Regent in his own periodical: [...] "What then is the draw-back to so many shining qualities, that has made them useless, or even hurtful to their owner? His crime is, to have been Editor of the Examiner ten years ago ...".|$|E
