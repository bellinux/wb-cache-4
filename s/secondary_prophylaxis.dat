Endoscopic therapies for varices aim to reduce variceal wall tension by obliteration of the varix.

The advantages of EST are that it is cheap and easy to use, and the injection catheter fits through the working channel of a diagnostic gastroscope.

40|$|Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic {{heart disease}} (RHD) are auto-immune {{conditions}} resulting from infection with group A streptococcus. Current management of these conditions includes secondary antibiotic prevention. This comprises regular 3 to 4 weekly long-acting intramuscular benzathine penicillin injections. Secondary antibiotic prevention aims to protect individuals against reinfection with group A streptococcus, thereby preventing recurrent ARF {{and the risk of}} further damage to the heart valves. However, the uptake of benzathine penicillin can be poor leaving patients at risk of avoidable and progressive heart damage. This review utilizes the Chronic Care Model as a framework to discuss initiatives to enhance the delivery of <b>secondary</b> antibiotic <b>prophylaxis</b> for ARF and RHD.

METHODS: We analyzed episodes of recurrent P. carinii pneumonia in 325 HIV-infected patients (275 men and 50 women) in eight prospective European cohorts. Between October 1996 and January 2000, these patients discontinued <b>secondary</b> <b>prophylaxis</b> during treatment with at least three anti-HIV drugs after they had at least one peripheral-blood CD 4 cell count of more than 200 cells per cubic millimeter. RESULTS: <b>Secondary</b> <b>prophylaxis</b> was discontinued at a median CD 4 cell count of 350 per cubic millimeter; the median nadir CD 4 cell count had been 50 per cubic millimeter. The median duration of the increase in the CD 4 cell count to more than 200 per cubic millimeter after discontinuation of <b>secondary</b> <b>prophylaxis</b> was 11 months. The median follow-up period after discontinuation of <b>secondary</b> <b>prophylaxis</b> was 13 months, yielding a total of 374 person-years of follow-up; for 355 of these person-years, CD 4 cell counts remained at or above 200 per cubic millimeter.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{treatment}} of portal hypertension {{is complex and}} the the best strategy depends on the underlying disease (cirrhosis vs. schistosomiasis), patient's clinical condition and time on it is performed (during an acute episode of variceal bleeding or electively, as pre-primary, primary or <b>secondary</b> <b>prophylaxis).</b> With the advent of new pharmacological options and technical development of endoscopy and interventional radiology {{treatment of}} portal hypertension has changed in recent decades. AIM: To review the strategies employed in elective and emergency treatment of variceal bleeding in cirrhotic and schistosomotic patients. METHODS: Survey of publications in PubMed, Embase, Lilacs, SciELO and Cochrane databases through June 2013, using the headings: portal hypertension, esophageal and gastric varices, variceal bleeding, liver cirrhosis, schistosomiasis mansoni, surgical treatment, pharmacological treatment, <b>secondary</b> <b>prophylaxis,</b> primary prophylaxis, pre-primary prophylaxis. CONCLUSION: Pre-primary prophylaxis doesn't have specific treatment strategies; the best recommendation is treatment of the underlying disease. Primary prophylaxis should be performed in cirrhotic patients with beta-blockers or endoscopic variceal ligation. There is controversy regarding the effectiveness of primary prophylaxis in patients with schistosomiasis; when indicated, it is done with beta-blockers or endoscopic therapy in high-risk varices. Treatment of acute variceal bleeding is systematized in the literature, combination of vasoconstrictor drugs and endoscopic therapy, provided significant decline in mortality over the last decades. TIPS and surgical treatment are options as rescue therapy. <b>Secondary</b> <b>prophylaxis</b> plays {{a fundamental role in}} the reduction of recurrent bleeding, the best option in cirrhotic patients is the combination of pharmacological therapy with beta-blockers and endoscopic band ligation.
