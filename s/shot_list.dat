5|$|Agent Carter {{was filmed}} over five days, with Gabriel Beristain serving as cinematographer. The budget {{did not allow}} for a {{storyboard}} artist to be hired, so D'Esposito, Winderbaum, and Beristain worked together to plan a <b>shot</b> <b>list</b> for the production using stand-in actors. The stunts were also pre-filmed to show the actors. D'Esposito explained that having the shots planned helped with planning the visual effects for the film. The mid-credits scene with Neal McDonough as Dum Dum Dugan was planned to show the character in a pool, but had to be changed on set to taking place beside the pool when {{it was found that}} the muscle suit McDonough wears to portray the character could not get wet.|$|E

Rivette {{disposed}} of a script, <b>shot</b> <b>list</b> and specific direction, experimenting with scenarios and groups of actors. On a limited budget, he shot the film in five weeks. After seeing performances by director Marc'O's experimental-improvisational theater group, Rivette cast Marc'O actors Jean-Pierre Kalfon and Bulle Ogier as the leads; other Marc'O performers appeared in supporting roles. According to the director, he cast Kalfon because of his dissimilarity to Rivette since he was self-conscious about the character's autobiographical aspects.|$|E

500|$|... "John Doe" [...] was co-executive MacLaren's directorial debut. Although she {{had never}} helmed an episode before, MacLaren {{utilized}} information that she had gathered by working with Kim Manners, one of the series' prolific directors. She later noted, [...] "Kim taught me how he breaks down a script and prepares his <b>shot</b> <b>list.</b> The most powerful thing {{he said to me}} was that he imagines the show all cut together and sees the movie in his head and really visualizes it." [...] Gilligan later said that MacLaren [...] "really rose to the occasion and really did her homework." [...] The bus crash scene was created with the use of elaborate [...] "smoke and mirrors", according to Gilligan. Over nine cameras were used to film the entire scene. Several of the cameras were under-cranked in order to give the illusion that the bus was going faster than it really was. A steel ramp was buried in the ground to flip the bus. However, the scene was reportedly torpid to film. Gilligan later joked that [...] "You could have stood there and had a sandwich while the thing was backing up: it was so slow." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} not storyboarded and was made without a <b>shot</b> <b>list.</b> The camp fire scene was {{originally}} a short, three-page scene that Phoenix re-wrote into an eight-page scene where Mike professes {{his love for}} Scott {{so that it was}} more apparent that his character was gay whereas Van Sant had originally made it more ambiguous. Reeves reportedly was not comfortable with this aspect of the film as he said in an interview, [...] "I'm not against gays or anything, but I won't have sex with guys. I would never do that on film.

40|$|Ranked <b>shot</b> <b>lists</b> from 39 {{automated}} LSCOM-Lite concept classifiers are investigated {{with respect}} to 24 TRECVID 2006 topics. Selecting the best fitting concept or pair of concepts produces the shot set with greatest utility, rather than drawing fewer shots from a larger set of concepts. Mean average precision measures show concept-based shot sets have great utility for topics when perfectly traversed by a user. Using empirical data, however, shows that realistic ability to separate relevant shots from irrelevant ones and recall all the relevant ones is topic-dependent and far from perfect. Concept-based strategies including user-driven selection strategies not using idealized oracle prioritization are also discussed, with implications for query-by-concept in interactive video retrieval as concept spaces grow from tens to thousands. 1...|$|R
