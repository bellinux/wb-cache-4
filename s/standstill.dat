40|$|This paper {{presents}} a model analyzing {{the potential for}} an International Court with powers to declare <b>standstills</b> to mitigate the coordination problem inherent to roll-overs in sovereign debt markets. It is shown that, regardless {{of the quality of}} the information handled by such an Institution, the scale of the coordination problem is reduced since its mere existence forces investors to focus on the Court's course of action rather than on other investors' beliefs. Furthermore, the model shows that, in order to avoid moral hazard, the right of recourse to the Court should be made conditional. sovereign debt, liquidity runs, <b>standstills,</b> effort...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, we {{appear to}} have entered an era of capital account crises. In response, {{a number of new}} crisis {{resolution}} ideas have been put forward, including the establishment of supranational institutions such as an international lender of last resort or an international bankruptcy court, temporary payments <b>standstills</b> and the inclusion of collective action clauses in debt contracts. This paper assesses these proposals using a theoretical model of crisis. The model underscores the importance of adapting policy interventions {{to the nature of the}} crisis at hand. For example, it finds that payments <b>standstills</b> and last-resort lending are an equally efficient means of dealing with liquidity crises, both ex-ante and ex-post, while creditor committees are second-best. It finds that debt-write-downs are a preferred means of dealing with solvency crises than subsidized IMF financing because of the negative moral hazard implications of the latter tool. And it finds that international bankruptcy court proposals may be superior to contractual approaches in securing such write-downscrisis resolution, international lender of last resort, <b>standstills,</b> IMF...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Astronomy {{always used}} to be a typical {{application}} field of geometry. Monumental structures like Stonehenge and the Egyptian or Central American pyramids were also giant observa-tories for the evidently strange motions in the sky. The author will show that the alignments of those structures not only had to do with sun positions, but might also have been influenced by hard-to-comprehend extreme moon positions (lunar <b>standstills)</b> and special positions of the Pleiades. Some special constellations allowed different archaic societies on three continents to precisely determine long periods of time with Stone Age methods, e. g., the length of a year or the time in-between lunar <b>standstills...</b>|$|R

House relents and Cuddy sets the rules, although House has Foreman do the team reviews instead.|$|E

Very little work occurred following this, as Druckmann stated in April 2016 that the film had entered development hell.

40|$|Is {{sovereign}} borrowing {{so different}} from corporate debt {{that there is no}} need for bankruptcystyle procedures to protect debtors? With the waiver of immunity, sovereign debtors who already face severe disruption from short-term creditors grabbing their currency reserves are also exposed to litigious creditors trying to seize what assets they can in a ‘race of the vultures’. Shielding sovereign debtors from inter-creditor conflict by authorised <b>standstills</b> on payments doubt-less runs some risk of debtor’s moral hazard. But the lack of an orderly procedure for resolving sovereign liquidity crises means that the IMF is de facto forced to bail out countries in trouble. This leads to both debtor and creditor moral hazard, as investors lend without monitoring, knowing that their investments are essentially guaranteed. The strategic case for legalising <b>standstills</b> is to rescue the international financial system from this ‘time consistent’ trap. JEL Classification: F 34, D 82, G 1...|$|R

Lancaster became {{the head of}} the royal council in 1316, promising to take forward the Ordinances through a new reform commission, but he appears to have abandoned this role soon afterwards, partially because of disagreements with the other barons, and possibly because of ill-health. Lancaster refused to meet with Edward in parliament for the next two years, bringing effective governance to a <b>standstill.</b> This stymied any hopes for a fresh campaign into Scotland and raised fears of civil war. After much negotiation, once again involving the Earl of Pembroke, Edward and Lancaster finally agreed to the Treaty of Leake in August 1318, which pardoned Lancaster and his faction and established a new royal council, temporarily averting conflict.|$|E
