5|$|According to {{the disputed}} <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ancient writers and some modern scholars, in Athens Aspasia became a hetaera and {{probably}} ran a brothel. Hetaerae were professional high-class entertainers, {{as well as}} courtesans. Besides displaying physical beauty, they differed from most Athenian women in being educated (often to a high standard, as in Aspasia's case), having independence, and paying taxes. They were the nearest thing perhaps to liberated women; and Aspasia, who became a vivid figure in Athenian society, was probably an obvious example. According to Plutarch, Aspasia was compared to the famous Thargelia, another renowned Ionian hetaera of ancient times.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{and again}} in 2008, the Mekong River flooded its banks, {{damaging}} hundreds of rural villages. Living River Siam joined with other NGOs to form the Thai People's Network for Mekong, which pointed to dams in China as {{the primary cause of}} the flooding. An intergovernmental working group called the Mekong River Commission opposed these claims, saying China's dams {{had little to do with}} the flood, although they also pressed China for data on the floodwaters. The back-and-forth was covered heavily in Thai press, which gave ample space to the <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> People's Network.|$|E

5|$|In Reformed theology, the Lord's Supper or Eucharist is {{a sacrament}} that spiritually nourishes Christians and {{strengthens}} their union with Christ. The outward or physical {{action of the}} sacrament is eating bread and drinking wine. Reformed confessions, which are official <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beliefs of Reformed churches, teach that Christ's body and blood are really present in the sacrament, but that this presence is communicated in a spiritual manner rather than by his body being physically eaten. The Reformed doctrine of real presence is sometimes called mystical real presence or spiritual real presence.|$|E

5|$|The Reformed {{confessions of}} faith, {{official}} <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beliefs of Reformed churches, followed {{the view that}} Christ is really present in the Supper. They either took Calvin's view that the signs of bread and wine are instrumental in communicating grace, or Bullinger's symbolic parallelism. Some of the German-language Reformed confessions seem hesitant to make the sacrament a means of grace, but they all maintain {{that there is a}} union between the outward signs of the sacrament and the inward grace signified. Reformed orthodox theologians also continued to insist on Christ's real presence in the Supper, while denying against Lutherans that his body is locally present.|$|E

5|$|Advaita {{literally}} means non-duality, {{and it is}} a monistic {{system of}} thought. It deals with the non-dual nature of Brahman and Atman. Advaita is considered the most influential sub-school of the Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy. Gaudapada {{was the first person to}} expound the basic principles of the Advaita philosophy in a commentary on the conflicting <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Upanishads. Gaudapada's Advaita ideas were further developed by Shankara (8th century CE). King states that Gaudapada's main work, Māṇḍukya Kārikā, is infused with philosophical terminology of Buddhism, and uses Buddhist arguments and analogies. King also suggests that there are clear differences between Shankara's writings and the Brahmasutra, and many ideas of Shankara are at odds with those in the Upanishads. Radhakrishnan, on the other hand, suggests that Shankara's views of Advaita were straightforward developments of the Upanishads and the Brahmasutra, and many ideas of Shankara derive from the Upanishads.|$|E
5|$|In theses 67–80, Luther {{discusses}} {{further the}} problems with the way indulgences are being preached, as he had done in the letter to Archbishop Albert. The preachers have been promoting indulgences as the greatest of the graces available from the church, but they actually only promote greed. He points out that bishops have been commanded to offer reverence to indulgence preachers who enter their jurisdiction, but bishops are also charged with protecting their people from preachers who preach contrary to the pope's intention. He then attacks the belief allegedly propagated by the preachers that the indulgence could forgive one who had violated the Virgin Mary. Luther states that indulgences cannot take away the guilt of even the lightest of venial sins. He labels several other alleged <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> indulgence preachers as blasphemy: that Saint Peter could not have granted a greater indulgence than the current one, and that the indulgence cross with the papal arms is as worthy as the cross of Christ.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Geetha starts an {{investigation}} when she realises {{that her son}} has gone missing. After a preliminary investigation, Geetha calls Rambabu and his family in for questioning. Rambabu, predicting that this would happen, coaches his family on how to present their alibi. As a result, when questioned individually, their responses are consistent. They also produce the restaurant receipt, the movie tickets and the tickets of the bus journey as proof of their alibi. The <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people who own the establishments that the family visited in Vizianagaram further solidify Rambabu's alibi. However, after a thorough investigation, Geetha realises that Rambabu had acquired the tickets and the receipt {{on the day of}} the incident, made an acquaintance with the owners, and had only actually taken the trip a day later with his family.|$|E

5|$|The Secretary of State Nguyễn Đính Thuan and Interior Minister Bùi Văn Lương {{were caught}} off guard by the attacks. The initial {{perception}} was that the military establishment had suddenly cracked down on the Buddhists because they were deemed {{to be a threat}} to the war effort. The government propagated a theory which held that the military felt compelled to take action after pro-Buddhist student unrest on 17–18 August. In Huế, student protestors had turned on an ARVN officer after he fired in their direction. The attacks were preceded by a large rally at Xá Lợi during which some monks had called for the overthrow of the Diệm regime and denounced the anti-Buddhist <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> de facto first lady Madame Nhu. However, observers dismissed government claims that the raids were spontaneous.|$|E
5|$|The {{report found}} that the {{tendency}} of the evidence presented in the programme was to suggest the terrorists had been unlawfully killed, and {{that it did not}} explore alternative explanations in any depth. Nevertheless, Windlesham and Rampton believed that the programme presented evidence for one possible explanation, but sought to raise questions rather than reach a conclusion. In analysing the content of the programme, they found that it allowed the witnesses to give their accounts in their own words rather than presenting them as established fact. Thus, they found that the content did not infringe any requirement for neutrality. The report scrutinised in detail the <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eyewitnesses who spoke on camera, including the parts of the interviews that {{were not included in the}} broadcast version of the programme. It found, with two exceptions, that the witnesses' statements were fairly represented in the programme. The exceptions were that the programme suggested that Bullock had not heard a warning, when he was in no position to hear whether such a warning was given or not; and that the commentary implied that all four witnesses who appeared on the programme had seen no threatening movements from the IRA members, when only two had been asked whether they witnessed such movements. Windlesham and Rampton also considered Asquez's statement and the journalists' decision to incorporate it into the programme. The report considered that the journalists acted reasonably in using the statement, despite Asquez's refusal to sign it, on the grounds that Asquez had given two separate, near-identical statements (including one to a lawyer), and that they considered it unlikely that somebody would invent such a dramatic account. Nonetheless, the report criticised the programme for not informing viewers of Asquez's refusal to sign the statement.|$|E
