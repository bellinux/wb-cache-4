In Egypt, <b>spent</b> <b>grain</b> has no value and is available at no cost all year. Incubation and germination experiments were conducted to assess the potential of using <b>spent</b> <b>grain</b> and compost to increase soil fertility and squash (Cucurbita pepo L.) growth in a calcareous soil. Amendments were two rates of <b>spent</b> <b>grain</b> (13. 5, 26. 7 gkg− 1), two rates of compost (24. 7, 49. 4 gkg− 1), a blend of lowest rates of compost and <b>spent</b> <b>grain</b> and a control. Treatments were mixed with calcareous soil, placed in pots and incubated anaerobically under field conditions for one month. After incubation 15 squash seeds were planted in the soil pots. Highest rate of <b>spent</b> <b>grain</b> most effectively increased soil water holding capacity, organic matter, macronutrients, micronutrients, germination parameters, and reduced soil pH. Mixing compost with <b>spent</b> <b>grain</b> was more effective than high rate of compost in increasing water holding capacity, soil nutrients, and decreasing soil pH.

The <b>spent</b> <b>grain</b> charcoal contains fixed carbon of 81 % and ash of 12 %, and the ash content is fairly high {{compared with that}} in the sawdust charcoal.

Feed DM intakes and growth rates were reduced as the dietary levels of <b>spent</b> <b>grain</b> were increased, with the effect being more marked in the finishing phase. Contrasting results were obtained for feed DM conversion, with apparently better conversion on the diets with <b>spent</b> <b>grain</b> in the growing phase, but poorer conversion on these diets in the finishing phase. A 30 % replacement level appeared to give the best economic return. An on-farm trial was conducted with 4 households with 4 pigs in each with initial weights of 40 to 46 kg.
