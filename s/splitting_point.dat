But it was pointed out to him that just at present the Liberal party was the party of a young man's opportunity; sooner or later the swing of the pendulum which would weed the Conservatives and proliferate Liberals was bound to come, there was always more demand and opportunity for candidates on the Liberal side, the Tariff Reformers were straining their ministerial majority to the <b>splitting</b> <b>point,</b> and most of the old Liberal leaders had died off during the years of exile. The party was no longer dominated; it would tolerate ideas. A young man who took a distinctive line--provided it was not from the party point of view a vexatious or impossible line--might go very rapidly far and high. On the other hand, it was urged upon him that the Tariff Reform adventure called also for youth and energy. But there, perhaps, there was less scope for the distinctive line--and already they had Garvin. Quite a number of Benham's friends pointed out to him the value of working out some special aspect of our national political interests. A very useful speciality was the Balkans. Mr. Pope, the well-known publicist, whose very sound and considerable reputation was based on the East Purblow Labour Experiment, met Benham at lunch and proposed to go with him in a spirit of instructive association to the Balkans, rub up their Greek together, and settle the problem of Albania. He wanted, he said, a foreign speciality to balance his East Purblow interest. But Lady Beach Mandarin warned Benham against the Balkans; the Balkans were getting to be too handy for Easter and summer holidays, and now that there were several good hotels in Servia and Montenegro and Sofia, they were being overdone. Everybody went to the Balkans and came back with a pet nationality. She loathed pet nationalities. She believed most people loathed them nowadays. It was stale: it was GLADSTONIAN. She was all for specialization in social reform. She thought Benham ought to join the Fabian Society and consult the Webbs. Quite a number of able young men had been placed {{with the assistance of the}} Webbs. They were, she said, [...] "a perfect fount...."

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} choosing <b>split</b> <b>points</b> for continuous predictor variables in a decision tree. Previous approaches to this problem typically either (1) discretize the continuous predictor values prior to learning or (2) apply a dynamic method that considers all possible <b>split</b> <b>points</b> for each potential split. In this paper, we describe a number of alternative approaches that generate {{a small number of}} candidate <b>split</b> <b>points</b> dynamically with little overhead. We argue that these approaches are preferable to pre-discretization, and provide experimental evidence that they yield probabilistic decision trees with the same prediction accuracy as the traditional dynamic approach. Furthermore, because the time to grow a decision tree is proportional to the number of <b>split</b> <b>points</b> evaluated, our approach is significantly faster than the traditional dynamic approach. ...|$|R

[...] "I think it comes down to Bella as human and Bella as vampire", she said, hinting at a potential <b>splitting</b> <b>point.</b> She thought that Condon would probably disagree with the statement, explaining that the decision is ultimately up to him. Later in January 2011, Godfrey confirmed that the Part 1 will cover the wedding, honeymoon, pregnancy and birth and ends just before her transformation into a vampire as the filmmakers wanted to [...] "take the audience through the emotional part of Bella's journey as she becomes a vampire". Part 2 will follow her transformation, the [...] "first exhilarating moments" [...] of her vampire life and the final confrontation with the Volturi. Godfrey also confirmed that Part 1 will follow the book's storyline as it breaks away from Bella and switches into Jacob's perspective. [...] "There is a sense that as Bella and the Cullens (Edward's makeshift vampire clan) deal with her pregnancy, the world is still turning outside with Jacob", he explains.

40|$|The {{most popular}} {{approach}} for analyzing survival data is the Cox regression model. The Cox model may, however, be misspecified, and its proportionality assumption {{is not always}} fulfilled. An alternative approach is random forests for survival outcomes. The standard split criterion for random survival forests is the log-rank test statistics, which favors splitting variables with many possible <b>split</b> <b>points.</b> Conditional inference forests avoid this <b>split</b> <b>point</b> selection bias. However, linear rank statistics are utilized in current software for conditional inference forests to select the optimal splitting variable, which cannot detect non-linear effects in the independent variables. We therefore use maximally selected rank statistics for <b>split</b> <b>point</b> selection in random forests for survival analysis. As in conditional inference forests, p-values for association between <b>split</b> <b>points</b> and survival time are minimized. We describe several p-value approximations and {{the implementation of the}} proposed random forest approach. A simulation study demonstrates that unbiased <b>split</b> <b>point</b> selection is possible. However, there is a trade-off between unbiased <b>split</b> <b>point</b> selection and runtime. In benchmark studies of prediction performance on simulated and real datasets the new method performs better than random survival forests if informative dichotomous variables are combined with uninformative variables with more categories and better than conditional inference forests if non-linear covariate effects are included. In a runtime comparison the method proves to be computationally faster than both alternatives, if a simple p-value approximation is used...|$|R

This algorithm uses MapReduce technology to realize the parallel processing of the best <b>split</b> <b>point,</b> thereby improving the efficiency of the algorithm. Assume that N Mapper tasks are used to process the scan statistics, so that each Mapper task only processes 1 /Nth of the training data set. The information aggregation and split-point calculation are performed through the Reducer, which returns the best split information and the split property.|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that the prediction accuracy of decision tree models is invariant under any strictly monotone transformation of the individual predictor variables. However, this statement may be false when predicting new observations with values that were not seen in the training-set and {{are close to the}} location of the <b>split</b> <b>point</b> of a tree rule. The sensitivity of the prediction error to the <b>split</b> <b>point</b> interpolation is high when the <b>split</b> <b>point</b> of the tree is estimated based on very few observations, reaching 9 % misclassification error when only 10 observations are used for constructing a split, and shrinking to 1 % when relying on 100 observations. This study compares the performance of alternative methods for <b>split</b> <b>point</b> interpolation and concludes that the best choice is taking the mid-point between the two closest <b>points</b> to the <b>split</b> <b>point</b> of the tree. Furthermore, if the (continuous) distribution of the predictor variable is known, then using its probability integral for transforming the variable ("quantile transformation") will reduce the model's interpolation error by up to about a half on average. Accordingly, this study provides guidelines for both developers and users of decision tree models (including bagging and random forest) ...|$|R

40|$|The Pontic shad {{lives in}} the northwestern part of the Black Sea. It migrates in the Danube River for spawning. The larvae drift passively towards the sea when they reach the life stage ranging from pre-larvae to post-larvae. During the larval stage the Pontic shad is floating, mainly in the 0 - 50 cm upper layer of river. Upstream of the Danube Delta, in the {{straight}} sector of the river, alosids are distributed mostly towards {{the middle of the}} river, where the water velocity is higher. In the curved section of the river, upstream of the location of the Danube River splitting in the delta’s branches, the water current is outwardly pushing the shad larvae to the right shore, the Romanian, respectively. Therefore, Tulcea branch (Romanian) takes over 60 - 80 % from the total of Danubian larvae, even its water flow is smaller (40 %) than Chilia branch (the border of Romania and Ukraine). The distribution of larvae at the <b>splitting</b> <b>point</b> influences the repartition of adult migratory catch, at return for spawning, between Saint George branch (Romania) and Chilia branch.
