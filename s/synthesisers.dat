5|$|From {{the early}} 1970s, the band's sound {{included}} synthesizers, particularly on Who's Next and Quadrophenia. Although groups had used synthesizers before, the Who {{were one of}} the first to integrate the sound into a basic rock structure. In By Numbers the group's style had scaled back to more standard rock, but <b>synthesisers</b> regained prominence on Face Dances.|$|E

25|$|During the Brain Salad Surgery tour of 1974, Emerson's {{keyboard}} setup {{included the}} Hammond C-3 organ, run through multiple Leslie speakers driven by HiWatt guitar amplifiers, the Moog 3C modular <b>synthesiser</b> (modified by addition of various modules and an oscilloscope) with ribbon controller, a Steinway concert grand piano with a Minimoog <b>synthesiser</b> {{on top of}} it, an upright acoustic-electric piano that was used for honky-tonk piano sounds, a Hohner Clavinet and another Minimoog <b>synthesiser.</b> Emerson also used a prototype polyphonic <b>synthesiser</b> produced by Moog, which was the test bed for the Moog Polymoog polyphonic <b>synthesiser.</b> The original <b>synthesiser</b> setup as envisioned by Moog was called the Constellation, and consisted of three instruments – the polyphonic <b>synthesiser,</b> called the Apollo, a monophonic lead <b>synthesiser</b> called the Lyra, and a bass-pedal <b>synthesiser,</b> called the Taurus, but Emerson never used the Taurus.|$|R
5|$|Following on {{from the}} success of their debut album, they {{released}} Talk on Corners and In Blue in 1997 and 2000 respectively. Originally Talk on Corners met with lukewarm success, until a remix version was released, when it topped the charts in many countries, and reached platinum status in the United Kingdom and Australia. In Blue moved towards mainstream pop, placing heavy emphasis on electronic <b>synthesisers.</b> It was successful, and was No. 1 in its first sales week in the UK, Ireland, Australia, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria and debuted at No. 2 in France and Norway. It climbed to the top position during its second week in Sweden and Spain.|$|E
5|$|Led Zeppelin's next album, Houses of the Holy, was {{released}} in March 1973. It featured further experimentation by the band, who expanded their use of <b>synthesisers</b> and mellotron orchestration. The predominantly orange album cover, designed by the London-based design group Hipgnosis, depicts images of nude children climbing the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland. Although the children are not shown from the front, the cover was controversial {{at the time of}} the album's release. As with the band's fourth album, neither their name nor the album title was printed on the sleeve.|$|E
5|$|On 2 June 2009, it was {{announced}} that the new album title would be In This Light and on This Evening and that they would be the first band to play at the new O2 Academy Birmingham. Through producer Flood's heavy usage of <b>synthesisers,</b> the album provided a synthpop/post-punk sound to Editors' production. Flood, who is famous for collaborating with electronic music influenced bands like U2, Depeche Mode, The Killers and Erasure, helped develop synthetic elements on the album, which resulted in a mixed reception from long-term fans as to the group's new direction.|$|E

5|$|Other {{recordings}} {{have been}} made by opera companies such as Gilbert and Sullivan for All, and Australian Opera, among many others. Ad hoc companies of operatic singers conducted by Sir Malcolm Sargent in the 1950s and 60s and Sir Charles Mackerras in the 1990s have made audio sets of several Savoy operas, and in the 1980s Alexander Faris conducted video recordings of most of the operas with casts including show-business stars as well as professional singers. The long-running Broadway production of The Pirates of Penzance presented by Joseph Papp, re-orchestrated with <b>synthesisers</b> replacing the strings, was put on record in 1981. Since 1994, the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival has released numerous professional and amateur CDs and videos of its productions and other Sullivan recordings.|$|E
5|$|The {{experimentation}} {{evident on}} Somewhere in Time continued on their next album, entitled Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, which {{was released in}} 1988. A concept album, based on the 1987 novel Seventh Son by Orson Scott Card, {{this would be the}} band's first record to include keyboards, performed by Harris and Smith, as opposed to guitar <b>synthesisers</b> on the previous release. After his contributions were not used for Somewhere in Time, Dickinson's enthusiasm was renewed as his ideas were accepted for this album. Another popular release, it became Iron Maiden's second album to hit No.1 in the UK charts, although it only achieved a Gold certification in the US, in contrast to its four predecessors.|$|E

25|$|As synthesiser {{technology}} evolved, Emerson {{went on to}} use {{a variety}} of other <b>synthesisers</b> made by Moog and other companies, including the Minimoog, the Yamaha GX-1 used on ELP's Works Volume 1 album, and several models by Korg (see Instrumentation).|$|E

40|$|Modern speech {{synthesis}} systems attempt to produce speech utterances {{from an open}} domain of words. In some situations, the <b>synthesiser</b> {{will not have the}} appropriate units to pronounce some words or phrases accurately but it still must attempt to pronounce them. This paper presents a hybrid machine translation and unit selection {{speech synthesis}} system. The machine translation system was trained with English as the source and target language. Rather than the <b>synthesiser</b> only saying the input text as would happen in conventional synthesis systems, the <b>synthesiser</b> may say an alternative utterance with the same meaning.
