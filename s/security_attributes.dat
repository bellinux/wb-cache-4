50|$|In {{computer}} security, mandatory {{access control}} (MAC) refers to a type of access control by which the operating system constrains {{the ability of a}} subject or initiator to access or generally perform some sort of operation on an object or target. In practice, a subject is usually a process or thread; objects are constructs such as files, directories, TCP/UDP ports, shared memory segments, IO devices, etc. Subjects and objects each have a set of <b>security</b> <b>attributes.</b> Whenever a subject attempts to access an object, an authorization rule enforced by the operating system kernel examines these <b>security</b> <b>attributes</b> and decides whether the access can take place. Any operation by any subject on any object is tested against the set of authorization rules (aka policy) to determine if the operation is allowed. A database management system, in its access control mechanism, can also apply {{mandatory access control}}; in this case, the objects are tables, views, procedures, etc.|$|E

5000|$|Silverlight CoreCLR uses an {{attribute-based}} security model, {{as opposed}} to the Code Access Security (CAS) model of the desktop version of [...]NET Framework. Assemblies are marked with a <b>security</b> <b>attribute,</b> which can be transparent (SecurityTransparentAttribute), safecritical (SecuritySafeCriticalAttribute) or critical (SecurityCriticalAttribute). Methods in transparent assemblies run with partial trust, and codes within such assemblies cannot call critical methods (methods which can cause system-wide changes); neither can transparent assemblies contain unverifiable code (use the unsafe C# keyword or use pointers) or invoke system functions by means of P/Invoke. Code in both critical and safecritical assemblies run with full trust, and are therefore not subject to such limitations. However, a transparent method can call a safecritical method, and a safecritical method can call a critical method. In such a case, the safecritical method will verify that the call is both safe and within the limited rights of the caller; if so, then the safecritical method will proxy the call to the requested critical method. In fact, the IsoStorage APIs are exposed as safecritical methods. An assembly whose <b>security</b> <b>attribute</b> is unset is run as a transparent method. Analogous limitations also apply to type-inheritance; namely, in the cases of virtual-method calls and interface-method calls. Silverlight assemblies can contain members that are not usable by CoreCLR, {{as long as they can}} be processed by the [...]NET Framework CLR; such methods will not be loaded when the assembly is being executed by CoreCLR.|$|R
