Near the end of the video, Royce and Eminem try to <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of each other for attention. The video ends with them being pushed out of the way by the Bad Meets Evil logo. The video became notable for its humorous content.|$|E
5|$|Ferranti {{began work}} on {{building}} the computer on 1 December 1950, with engineer Raymond Stuart-Williams adapting the design by Bennett into a working machine. Development was completed by 12 April 1951, resulting in a device twelve feet wide, nine feet deep, and five feet tall. The majority of the volume was taken up by vacuum tubes and the light bulbs that displayed {{the state of the}} game, with the actual computer taking up no more than two percent of the total volume of the machine. The Nimrod took the form of a large box with panels of lights, with a raised <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of it with buttons corresponding with the lights, which in turn represented the objects the player could remove.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} starts with multi colored, digital waves which then merge into {{a scene where}} Aguilera is sat in an editing suite {{overlooking}} a sound and edit board. Pressing flashing buttons, multiple large screens <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the desk and correspond to her choice of button selected. The first images shown on the screens feature Aguilera as Catwoman, a futuristic blue haired character, and a 1960s influenced hippie before focusing on the 60's inspired character. The blond character is shown to be holding an old fashioned handheld video camera filming scenes of high rise buildings, all the while showing shots of Aguilera editing the on screen projection. The blond hippie inspired character is then seen in a second setting, riding a bicycle through a grassy field at times performing dance movements to the song and lip-synching.|$|E

5|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by Andy Morahan and Eric Watson, and consists of shots of the duo around London. At {{the beginning of the}} video, noises from the city can be heard, a camera passes Lowe on the street, and focuses on two vintage dolls in a shop window. Then appears a sequence of quick cuts with shots of the city's different sub-cultures; the video freezes and cuts to Tennant and Lowe, who walk through an empty Wentworth Street in Petticoat Lane Market. They <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of a red garage door; Tennant is in front dressed with a long coat, white shirt and dark necktie, directly addressing the camera, with Lowe standing behind him with a blank expression. Lowe is filmed in double-exposure and appears almost ghostlike. In other shots, Tennant walks imperiously while Lowe follows behind.|$|E
5|$|Temple 3 (also {{known as}} Structure 3) is a pyramid-temple {{located on the}} east side of Plaza A, {{opposite}} Temple 2, and is similar in form to that building. The stairway climbs the west (plaza) side of the temple platform. In front of the stairway, at the level of the plaza, is a small rectangular platform. A large amount of ceramic remains were found associated with this building, these were pieces of large cylindrical incense-burners, of which more than twelve were used in the temple. One represented an elderly god emerging from the jaws of a serpent, another two show the same deity in a standing position. They may represent one of the patrion deities of the Kaqchikel, B'elehe-Toh or Hun-Tihax. The incense burners were found exactly where the Kaqchikels had left them when they abandoned Iximche. Some of these incense-burners bore a suspended solar disc with modelled rays. Fragments of an Early Postclassic plumbate ware vessel were recovered scattered around three sides of the temple that were probably the remains of a relic from within the temple itself. There is no evidence of such early occupation at Iximche and may have been plundered from Zaculeu, a city with a long occupational history that was conquered by the K'iche'-Kaqchikel alliance. A sacrificial flint knife was also recovered from Structure 3. Two low platforms <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the temple, they were likely to have been used either as altars or as dance platforms.|$|E

25|$|Nowadays {{it appears}} that the almshouses rival the inmates in their decayed circumstances, for, while the black and white paint-work is tidy, the facade shows an {{alarming}} inclination to land at the feet of those who <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> to admire it. This is a good little build¬ing, adding much to the town's seafront, and worthy of careful renovation. Happily the James Butcher Housing Association is now undertaking this work.|$|E

25|$|The mantic {{calendar}} {{has proven}} to be particularly resistant to the onslaughts of time (that is, of colonial repression, liberalism, ethnocide, and free market). Nowadays, a 'daykeeper', or divinatory priest, may <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of a fire, and pray in Maya to entities such as the 260 days; the cardinal directions; the ancestors of those present; important Mayan towns and archaeological sites; lakes, caves, or volcanoes; and deities from the Popol Vuh.

25|$|The stone work of {{the two-story}} {{platform}} exhibits a superb sense of architectural organization and advanced building methods. Two stone pagodas <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the main hall of the temple. The simpler Seokgatap located {{to the left of}} the court represents Buddha's manifestation in a transcendent calm. It has three stories with two pedestal layers and a total height reaching about twenty-five feet. The pagoda consists of simple undecorated pedestal slabs and three-story stupa each of which has five stepped eaves and truncated roofs. These characteristics constitute a typical form of the Korean stone pagodas.|$|E
25|$|In July 1924, Matthews {{left for}} the USA to market his invention. When he was offered $25,000 to {{demonstrate}} his beam to the Radio World Fair at Madison Square Garden, he again refused and claimed, without foundation, {{that he was not}} permitted to demonstrate it outside England. US scientists were not impressed. One Professor Woods offered to <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the death ray device to demonstrate his disbelief. Regardless, when Matthews returned to Britain, he claimed that the USA had bought his ray but refused to say who had done it and for how much. Matthews moved to the USA and began to work for Warner Bros.|$|E

25|$|Actor Andrew Buchan said {{cast members}} were told {{little about the}} plot, except on a {{need-to-know}} basis as they prepared for their performances in each episode. The actors also received only parts of scripts and only two scripts {{at a time to}} ensure {{that they did not know}} story details too far in advance. Cinematographer John Conroy said the cast and crew did not know how series two ended until three weeks before shooting began on the final two scripts. Two former Coldstream Guards were hired to <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of news reporters when they visited the set, to block possible photographs of the filming. Several different endings for series two were filmed, the cast was not permitted to see completed episodes of the series, and Chibnall said that cast members will remain in the dark about the programme's outcome until the final episode airs.|$|E
25|$|Until the {{initiation}} ceremony and induction into {{the society and}} the receiving of the word, the horseman who were not {{members of the society}} but potential candidates would have trouble with horses. This would often be caused by older ploughmen who were members of the society tampering with their horses. They would put things like tacks under the horse's collar to cause it to behave irrationally. This would be unknown to the potential candidate as the techniques for training and controlling the horses were not yet given to him. Most of these techniques were based on the horse's sharp sense of smell. Foul substances placed in front of the horse or on the animal itself would cause it to refuse to move forward. This technique is known as jading and is still used by horse trainers today. There were also pleasant smelling things that were used to make a horse move forward or calm down. If the substance was an oil it could be wiped on the trainer's forehead, they would then <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the animal and the smell would draw it towards them. This practice was often used in taming unruly horses. There were also pleasant smelling and inviting materials, such as sweets, that the horseman could keep in their pocket in order to calm, attract, and subdue a crazed horse. Keeping these techniques secret, along with the myth that there was a word that only the horseman knew that gave them and them alone power over horses helped guarantee their reputation, prestige, job security, and pay. The same type of logic and protection of trade secrets can be seen among modern magicians who keep their tricks secret and only share them with other members of their trade.|$|E
