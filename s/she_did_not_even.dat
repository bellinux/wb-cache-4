25|$|DSHS {{was most}} {{concerned}} about Biryukova's mental health, given her OCD diagnosis and past hospitalizations, following a complaint from the person who delivered the child. They also found the father, Alan Morgan, a convicted felon, problematic. Authorities in Florida had taken a child from his home there. The month the two were married Biryukova reported him to the police in Redmond for allegedly assaulting her and got a no-contact order; she nevertheless visited him regularly in jail in Issaquah, where he was when she gave birth, under assumed names. Both claimed to investigators they did not live together despite giving them the same address; Biryukova {{said at one point}} <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> know who the father was even though his name was on the child's birth certificate.|$|E
25|$|Winifred Banks – {{the wife}} of George Banks, and mother to Jane and Michael. In the musical and film, she is {{presented}} as a society woman. In the film, she is a suffragette and involved in social causes. In the musical, she is a former actress. Her family and maiden name are not mentioned, however in the books, she has two aunts that are mentioned, Aunt Flossie and Aunt Caroline. In the musical, Winifred is shown to be confused and overwhelmed with her family and her role in it. It is hinted that she did not grow up in the same strict manor as her husband, perhaps <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> have a nanny as a child, and is not from this area, which makes it difficult for her to connect and make friends. In the original books, she has five children instead of two, including the twins, John and Barbara, and later a baby, Annabel.|$|E

It was alleged that Gaga asked Lopez for a credit on [...] "Invading My Mind" [...] to [...] "cover her tracks", with Francescatti's lawyer claiming that <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> {{contribute to the}} song. The lawsuit claimed to have uncovered text messages between Gaga and RedOne proving that she had stolen the sample loop used in both [...] "Judas" [...] and [...] "Invading My Mind".|$|E

500|$|Ryan's singing talent came as {{something}} of a surprise to her family, given that she was an award-winning tap dancer as a child. Ryan said <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> attempt to sing until she was eight years old and started enjoying LeAnn Rimes and country music. Shawn Ryan started sharing his record collection with his daughter, and Bianca [...] "fell in love" [...] with rhythm and blues and soul music. Eventually, she began rehearsing nightly with her father. Ryan convinced him to take her to an audition for Star Search, where her performance of [...] "Think" [...] impressed the judges and shocked her father. [...] "I'd never heard her sing like that." [...] During the Junior Singers competition, Bianca Ryan lost to Spensha Baker. Ryan later won Amateur Kids Night on Showtime at the Apollo.|$|E
500|$|Arular {{was to be}} {{released}} in September 2004, but was delayed. M.I.A.'s record label stated that the delay was caused by problems obtaining permission to use an unspecified sample. Revised release dates of December 2004 and February 2005 were publicised, but the album remained unreleased; at one point, Pitchfork announced that it had been shelved indefinitely. It was eventually released on 22 March 2005, when XL Recordings made it available in the US, albeit with the track [...] "U.R.A.Q.T." [...] omitted as the issues with a sample had not been resolved. The UK edition was released the following month with the track included, and this edition was released in the US by Interscope Records on 17 May. Arular sparked internet debates on the rights and wrongs of the Tamil Tigers. By the time it was released, a [...] "near hysterical buzz" [...] on the internet had created [...] "slavish anticipation" [...] for the album. Despite this, M.I.A. claimed in late 2005 that she had little comprehension of her prior popularity with music bloggers, stating that <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> own a computer.|$|E
500|$|Nichols had a {{supporting}} role in The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 (2008), playing a jealous friend of America Ferrera's character. Overall, the film was well received by critics. Roger Ebert commented that Nichols as her character Julia [...] "proves a principle that {{should be in the}} Little Movie Glossary: If a short, curvy, sun-kissed heroine [...] has a tall, thin blond as a roommate, that blond is destined to be a bitch. No way around it." [...] Stephen Holden, writing for The New York Times, similarly said, [...] "It falls to Ms. Nichols to play the movie's designated blond baddie, a cold, arrogant vixen who tries to undermine [...] triumphs in romance and onstage." [...] Nichols was cast in Star Trek (2009) in November 2007, but due to the project's secrecy her role was initially unknown even to her; she said that month <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> know her character's name. It was speculated that she would play Janice Rand, but she would actually play an Orion cadet at Starfleet Academy, as revealed by TrekMovie.com the following month.|$|E

500|$|Marie and her siblings, Prince Alfred (b. 1874), and Princesses Victoria Melita (b. 1876, {{known as}} [...] "Ducky"), Alexandra (b. 1878, known as [...] "Sandra") and Beatrice (b. 1884, known as [...] "Baby Bee"), {{spent much of}} their early life at Eastwell Park, which their mother {{preferred}} instead of Clarence House, their official residence. In her memoirs, Marie would remember Eastwell fondly. The Duke of Edinburgh was largely absent from his children's lives, due to his position in the British Royal Navy, and their life was governed by their mother. Marie would later state that <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> know the colour of her father's hair until she looked at later portraits of him, believing it to be much darker than it actually was. When he was at home, the Duke would often play with his children, inventing many games for them. Of all her siblings, Marie was closest to her sister Victoria Melita, who was one year younger, but whom everyone {{believed to be the}} older girl because of her stature, much to the princesses' dismay. The Edinburgh children were all baptised and raised in the Anglican faith; this upset their Russian Orthodox mother.|$|E
500|$|Nixon gave {{a speech}} from the rear {{platform}} of the train. He praised {{the size of the}} crowd, stating, [...] "There are four times as many people here than live in the town and more than the number that were here in 1960." [...] The candidate asserted that though his opponent, Vice President Humphrey, claimed that Americans had never had it so good, he should tell that to the farmer. Nixon pledged that he would give special attention to agricultural issues and would make the Secretary of Agriculture a farmer's advocate to the White House. He promised to restore order: [...] "The most important civil right is the right to be free from [...] violence." [...] He noted the many youths in the crowd, stating, [...] "Young Americans know their future is at stake. They don't want four more years of the same." [...] He recalled that his father had hailed from Ohio: [...] "his roots are here and mine are too!" [...] As Nixon spoke, Cole observed him, and thought he was a good family man, looking warm and friendly and appearing much as she expected him to. She later stated that <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> look at the sign until she was teased about it by a classmate, who suggested the sign, [...] "Bring Us Together Again" [...] was about boys, not politics. She kept the dress, but told the media she threw away the sign.|$|E

Madhubala married Kishore Kumar in 1960 [...] and according to Leena Chandavarkar (Kishore's fourth wife): [...] "When she realized Dilip was not going to marry her, on the rebound and just to prove to him that she could get whomsoever she wanted, she went and married a man <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> know properly." [...] B. K.

2500|$|Lola and Karol Felix were liberal Jews: {{they did}} not observe Jewish customs, {{including}} not keeping a kosher home (in fact, Kitty states that <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> know what kosher was until after her family had fled to Lublin); and the family only attended synagogue at occasions. Despite this, they were {{very much a part}} of the Jewish community: the majority of people the family mixed with were Jews, with Kitty herself frequenting Jewish social clubs. Additionally, Kitty also attended a Jewish primary school, and following this, was a pupil at the Convent School of Notre Dame for a year (after which the war broke out), which although not a Jewish school, was predominantly attended by Jews. The school was a private all-girls school, and people came from miles around to attend it, as it was very prestigious, with alumni including a set of twins who were descended from the Habsburg dynasty.|$|E
2500|$|When Blackwell {{arrived at}} the college, she was rather nervous. Nothing was familiar– the surroundings, the {{students}} and the faculty. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> know where to get her books. However, she soon found herself at home in medical school. [...] While she was at school, she was looked upon as an oddity by the townspeople of Geneva. She also rejected suitors and friends alike, preferring to isolate herself. In the summer between her two terms at Geneva, she returned to Philadelphia, stayed with Dr. Elder, and applied for medical positions in the area to gain clinical experience. The Guardians of the Poor, the city commission that ran Blockley Almshouse, granted her permission to work there, albeit not without some struggle. Blackwell slowly gained acceptance at Blockley, although some young resident physicians still would walk out and refuse to assist her in diagnosing and treating her patients. During her time there, Blackwell gained valuable clinical experience, but was appalled by the syphilitic ward and those afflicted with typhus. Her graduating thesis at Geneva Medical College ended up being on the topic of typhus. The conclusion of this thesis linked physical health with socio-moral stability– a link that foreshadows her later reform work.|$|E

2500|$|Gibb met Scottish {{pop singer}} Lulu through Colin Petersen. Lulu recalls about Maurice, [...] "I thought Maurice was cute, so I said, 'In that case, {{tell him to}} stop talking about me and take me out', He did just that, I never {{expected}} much to come from this, but in fact our relationship grew, after a fashion. Going steady is quite {{the wrong way to}} describe what was happening between us. Going unsteady might better sum up the way we fell in and out with each other". According to Lulu, she, Maurice and Robert Stigwood watched Pink Floyd at the Saville Theatre in London. Later, after his relationship with Lulu had become public knowledge, he said: [...] "Lulu and I met on the Top of the Pops TV show three months ago, and then at the Saville Theatre in London last month". Later in 1968, Lulu was seen out on the town with Davy Jones of The Monkees, Jones was also a friend of Maurice's. As Gibb recalled, [...] "Davy Jones was a good friend of mine, I broke it off with Lulu over the phone and Davy called me up and said 'I am going to ask Lu to dinner with some friends, is that all right?' I said, 'Yes, I am not going out with her anymore, have a ball' and threw the phone down. They then took so many photos of them and made it look like a six-month romance, but she had only been out with him that one night, <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> want to go out. She phoned me the next day and she was crying, saying she was sorry". Maurice later regretted not accepting her apology, [...] "We just grew up, that's all," [...] Maurice admitted. [...] "We were miserable apart and when we started going out again, it got so that I didn't want to be with anyone. I used to phone her up from Los Angeles about twice a day. Then she'd call me back. We used to make about 90 minute calls".|$|E
