40|$|Abstract. Flatness of blanked parts is {{important}} {{as well as}} the cut edge quality and often becomes worse when blanking the low stiffness parts such as narrow shim rings. In this study, the affecting factors on the flatness of shim rings in conventional blanking were investigated through the experiments varying the ring widths and materials. Flatness was evaluated with the deflection angle. It was found that the <b>shim</b> <b>ring</b> with a smaller width and the material having a larger n value exhibited larger deflection angles. Deformation during blanking was analyzed by FE simulation and the experimental results were explained based on the strain distributions...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, {{infrared}} (IR) space instruments {{have been}} focused by iterating {{with a number}} of different thickness shim rings in a thermal vacuum chamber until the focus meets requirements. This has required a number of thermal cycles that are very expensive as they tie up many integration and test (I&T) / environmental technicians/engi neers work ing three shifts for weeks. Rather than creating a test shim for each iteration, this innovation replaces the test shim and can focus the instrument while in the thermal vacuum chamber. The focus tool consists of three small, piezo-actuated motors that drive two sets of mechanical interface flanges between the instrument optics and the focal- plane assembly, and three optical-displacement metrology sensors that can be read from outside the thermal vacuum chamber. The motors are used to drive the focal planes to different focal distances and acquire images, from which it is possible to determine the best focus. At the best focus position, the three optical displacement metrology sensors are used to determine the shim thickness needed. After the instrument leaves the thermal vacuum chamber, the focus tool is replaced with the precision-ground <b>shim</b> <b>ring.</b> The focus tool consists of two sets of collars, one that mounts to the backside of the interface flange of the instrument optics, and one that mounts to the backside of the interface flange of the focal plane modules. The collars on the instrument optics side have the three small piezo-actuated motors and the three optical displacement metrology systems. Before the instrument is focused, there is no <b>shim</b> <b>ring</b> in place and, therefore, no fasteners holding the focal plane modules to the cameras. Two focus tooling collars are held together by three strong springs. The Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO) mission spectrometer was focused this way (see figure). The motor described here had to be moved five times to reach an acceptable focus, all during the same thermal cycle, which was verified using pupil slicing techniques. A focus accuracy of. 20. 100 microns was achieved...|$|E
40|$|The main magnet in a {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) system creates a static magnetic field that determines the final imaging quality. In a permanent MRI system, <b>shimming</b> <b>rings</b> are commonly used to improve field homogeneity. However, the optimization of the ring structure is challenging owing to the nonlinear properties of the ferromagnetic material. To design a small permanent magnet system, this study explores the application of sensitivity analysis (SA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for the optimization of <b>shimming</b> <b>rings.</b> SA is used to identify the most important parameter of the <b>shimming</b> <b>rings</b> that affects {{the quality of the}} magnetic field to simplify the optimization process and improve optimization accuracy and efficiency. PSO is used to solve the complex and nonlinear optimizations of the magnetic field. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a specific permanent MRI magnet was modeled. The results show that the inner radius of the <b>shimming</b> <b>ring</b> crucially affects magnetic field quality, with ring height having relatively smaller impact. Compared with the PSO-only optimization procedure, the combined SA-PSO optimization more rapidly converges to a better solution. The optimized <b>shimming</b> <b>rings</b> significantly improve the magnetic field uniformity (~ 10 fold) compared with that of the initial magnet without <b>shimming</b> <b>rings...</b>|$|R
40|$|The main magnet, an {{important}} part of an MRI system, is used to produce the static magnetic field in the imaging area. In a permanent MRI magnet, there is a widespread end effect that causes a non-uniform magnetic field distribution and affects the imaging quality. In this paper, we have designed an H-type permanent magnet for small-sized MRI applications; in particular, the novel design has been realized by adding a <b>shimming</b> <b>ring</b> outside the pole piece to improve the magnetic field uniformity. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to solve the complex and nonlinear optimization problems. The simulation results show that the magnet optimized by the proposed method generates a homogeneous magnetic field that can be easily implemented in practice and at a low cost...|$|R
