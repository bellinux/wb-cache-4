5|$|Huge {{flocks of}} more than a million common {{starlings}} may be observed just before sunset in spring in southwestern Jutland, Denmark over the seaward marshlands of Tønder and Esbjerg municipalities between Tønder and Ribe. They gather in March until northern Scandinavian birds leave for their breeding ranges by mid-April. Their swarm behaviour creates complex shapes <b>silhouetted</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> sky, a phenomenon known locally as sort sol ("black sun").|$|E
5|$|The radar {{contacts}} were, in fact, {{the approaching}} 31 Japanese torpedo bombers, who circled {{around to the}} south of TF18 so that they could attack from the east, with the black backdrop of the eastern sky behind them. From this direction, the Japanese bombers were hidden by the night sky, but Giffen's ships were <b>silhouetted</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> twilight of the western horizon. The 705AG aircraft attacked first, beginning at 19:19. Nakamura's aircraft missed with all of their torpedoes and one was shot down by anti-aircraft fire from Giffen's ships.|$|E
5|$|At {{about the}} same time, Winnie Johnson sent Hindley another letter, again {{pleading}} with her to assist the police in finding the body of her son Keith. In the letter, Johnson was sympathetic to Hindley over the criticism surrounding her first visit. Hindley, who had not replied to the first letter, responded by thanking Johnson for both letters, explaining that her decision not to reply to the first resulted from the negative publicity that surrounded it. She claimed that, had Johnson written to her 14years earlier, she would have confessed and helped the police. She also paid tribute to Topping, and thanked Johnson for her sincerity. Hindley made her second visit to the moor in March 1987. This time, the level of security surrounding her visit was considerably higher. She stayed overnight in Manchester, at the flat of the police chief in charge of GMP training at Sedgley Park, Prestwich, and visited the moor twice. She confirmed to police that the two areas {{in which they were}} concentrating their search—Hollin Brown Knoll and Hoe Grain—were correct, although she was unable to locate either of the graves. She later remembered that as Pauline Reade was being buried she had been sitting next to her on a patch of grass and could see the rocks of Hollin Brown Knoll <b>silhouetted</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> night sky.|$|E

25|$|The Swift's initial {{position}} was below, behind, {{and to the}} right of the DC-6, so the Swift's pilot should have easily been able to see the large DC-6 overhead and to his left. From the viewpoint of the DC-6 flight crew, the Swift may have been in a blind spot created by the DC-6 nose structure; if not, the small silver-grey plane would be hard to see <b>silhouetted</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> ground.|$|E
25|$|Mesopelagic {{fish are}} adapted for an active life under low light conditions. Most {{of them are}} visual predators with large eyes. Some of the deeper water fish have tubular eyes with big lenses and only rod cells that look upwards. These give {{binocular}} vision and great sensitivity to small light signals. This adaptation gives improved terminal vision {{at the expense of}} lateral vision, and allows the predator to pick out squid, cuttlefish, and smaller fish that are <b>silhouetted</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> gloom above them.|$|E

25|$|It is {{not unusual}} in Somers to see some (introduced) koalas and the suburb {{is well known for}} its Koala Walk. The {{distinctive}} growl of Koalas can often be heard in the town. Travellers are advised to take care, as koalas frequently cross local roads, and show little road sense. Occasionally echidnas have been seen in the area around The Promenade. Bushy-tail and ring- tail Possums are commonplace, and can often be seen soon after nightfall, scurrying along powerlines and thus <b>silhouetted</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> night sky.|$|E
25|$|O'Keeffe {{traveled}} to New Mexico by 1929 {{with her friend}} Rebecca Strand and stayed in Taos {{at the home of}} Mabel Dodge Luhan, who provided the women with studios. O'Keeffe went on many pack trips, exploring the rugged mountains and deserts of the region that summer and later visited the nearby D. H. Lawrence Ranch, where she completed her now famous oil painting, The Lawrence Tree, currently owned by the Wadsworth Athenaeum in Hartford, Connecticut. O'Keeffe visited and painted the nearby historical San Francisco de Asis Mission Church at Ranchos de Taos. She made several paintings of the church, as had many artists, and her painting of a fragment of it <b>silhouetted</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> sky captured it from a unique perspective.|$|E
25|$|The new tactic {{outlined}} in Herrmann's report envisaged {{the use of}} free-ranging day fighters (and {{to a lesser extent}} night fighters) to counter Bomber Command. The single-engined fighters were to supplement the ground controlled Himmelbett (four-poster bed) technique, by co-operation with searchlight crews, mostly over the target. Pyrotechnic and other visual means were to guide the fighters in operations known as Wilde Sau (Wild Boar). After the fighters had reached the combat zone, pilots tried to identify and intercept enemy bombers visually; searchlights were to be used to illuminate the sky. Initial tests using former flying instructors experienced in blind-flying techniques, suggested the ideal weather conditions were when a certain (not too thick) lower level cloud cover prevailed, since then the bomber would be <b>silhouetted</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> back-lit clouds and the high-flying German fighters could easily spot their targets.|$|E

500|$|Cinematographer James Wong Howe shot Hud in {{black-and-white}} to [...] "elevate its dramatic propensities". Filmed in Panavision, Howe used {{high contrast}} with unbalanced {{light and dark}} tones. He highlighted the white ground and clear skies, making the shadows black. Dark tones were [...] "overpowered" [...] by light ones, creating a sense of [...] "infinite space". For faces and structures, Howe used light reflected from the ground. The contrast between the environment and objects <b>silhouetted</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> background provides a sense of depth. Ritt's biographer, Carlton Jackson, wrote that in Hud [...] "the scenery becomes {{a part of the}} thematic development itself". According to Texas Monthly, [...] "Howe's austere rendition of Texas landscapes remains one of the film's most distinctive pleasures".|$|E
500|$|Traditionally the Upper Ward {{was judged}} to be [...] "to all intents and {{purposes}} a nineteenth-century creation... the image of what the early nineteenth-century thought a castle should be", {{as a result of the}} extensive redesign of the castle by Wyatville under George IV. The walls of the Upper Ward are built of Bagshot Heath stone faced on the inside with regular bricks, the gothic details in yellow Bath stone. The buildings in the Upper Ward are characterised by the use of small bits of flint in the mortar for galletting, originally started at the castle in the 17th century to give stonework from disparate periods a similar appearance. The skyline of the Upper Ward is designed to be dramatic when seen from a distance or <b>silhouetted</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> horizon, an image of tall towers and battlements influenced by the picturesque movement of the late 18th century. Archaeological and restoration work following the 1992 fire has shown the extent to which the current structure represents a survival of elements from the original 12th-century stone walls onwards, presented within the context of Wyatville's final remodelling.|$|E

500|$|When Homer {{calls the}} National Fatherhood Institute, he {{is put on}} hold and Harry Chapin's song [...] "Cat's in the Cradle" [...] plays in the {{telephone}} while he waits. Cast member Harry Shearer based the voice of Dave, {{the director of the}} Fatherhood Institute, on actor Mason Adams. At the institute, Dave gives Homer a copy of the book Fatherhood by American actor Bill Cosby. In a subsequent episode, [...] "Dog of Death", Homer throws the book into the fireplace as replacement for wood. When Homer and Bart build the soapbox racer, Mac Davis's song [...] "Watching Scotty Grow", sung by Bobby Goldsboro, plays in the background. The whipping and spikes coming out of Nelson's racer are a reference to the chariot race in the film Ben-Hur. The idea of Nelson's racer being [...] "armed with every dirty trick in the book" [...] was based on the 1973 Soap Box Derby World Championship scandal, when a 14-year-old boy was stripped of his title two days after winning the national race for cheating. During the final race, Homer stands up in the crowd to cheer on Bart and his body is <b>silhouetted</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> sun, a reference to a scene in the film The Natural. The theme song from The Natural plays in the scene.|$|E
500|$|Beatty's battlecruisers led the British fleet in its attack, casting {{south into}} the North Sea {{to find the}} enemy during the {{afternoon}} of 31 May 1916. At 14:15, scouting cruisers spotted the German vanguard and Beatty closed to attack the enemy with his main force. Given time to prepare, Hipper was ready for Beatty with his battlecruisers in line to face Beatty's approaching ships with their full broadsides. Hipper was also encouraged by the main German battleship fleet under Vice-Admiral Reinhard Scheer, which was steaming northwards close behind him. At 15:45 Beatty came within range of the German fleet and the vanguards engaged one another with their opening fusillades. As the two squadrons closed, the Germans found the range better and faster than the British, who were <b>silhouetted</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> sun. As a result, German shells pounded the British ships while the German ships remained untouched for the first 10minutes of the engagement. During {{this stage of the}} battle Lion was hit by nine shells from [...] One shell at 16:00 struck the right upper corner of the left hand gun port at the junction of the face plate and the roof, and punched a piece of the 9-inch face plate into the turret before detonating, blowing off the armoured roof of the turret and starting a fire, which a damage control party working from outside the turret fought to put out.|$|E
500|$|Moran led his ships {{between the}} Seribuat Archipelago and {{the coast of}} Johor in {{brilliant}} moonlight and then altered course northeast to search the area north of the archipelago. When dark clouds obscured the moon at 01:51, he turned southwestwards at a speed of [...] for Endau, keeping Tioman Island behind him to ensure that his ships were not <b>silhouetted</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> horizon. At 02:37, Vampire saw a Japanese destroyer (probably Amagiri), but was not spotted in return and the Allied ships continued on their course. Three minutes later, they located another Japanese ship (the minesweeper W-4) dead ahead at point-blank range. Moran decided to attack, as discovery was inevitable at such short range, and increased his speed to , simultaneously firing two of his three torpedoes {{at a distance of}} [...] One torpedo missed ahead by [...] and the other passed underneath the minesweeper. W-4, in the middle patrol zone, was trying to identify the two destroyers when Moran attacked, but failed to alert any other Japanese ships to the Allied presence in their midst for 20 minutes before giving a location [...] away. W-4 did not return fire and Moran resumed his search for the transports, reducing his speed again to 15 knots to reduce the visibility of his wakes. A half-hour later, with shallow water approaching, and no transports spotted, the Allied destroyers altered course to the north to clear the shallows and increased speed to 25 knots at 03:13 before turning southeast by east.|$|E
50|$|The helmet {{design was}} unique for a {{professional}} football team.

2500|$|The Atlantic Ocean {{was a major}} {{strategic}} battle zone (the [...] "Battle of the Atlantic") {{and when}} Germany declared war on the U.S., the East Coast of the United States offered easy pickings for German U-boats (referred to as the [...] "Second Happy Time"). After a highly successful foray by five Type IX long-range U-boats, the offensive was maximized {{by the use of}} short-range Type VII U-boats, with increased fuel stores, replenished from supply U-boats called Milchkühe (milk cows). From February to May 1942, 348 ships were sunk, for the loss of two U-boats during April and May. U.S. naval commanders were reluctant to introduce the convoy system that had protected trans-Atlantic shipping and, without coastal blackouts, shipping was <b>silhouetted</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> bright lights of American towns and cities such as Atlantic City until a dim-out was ordered in May.|$|E
2500|$|The signal or [...] "hinterland" [...] fence (Signalzaun) was {{the first}} of the border fences, {{dividing}} the Sperrzone from the more heavily guarded protective strip (Schutzstreifen) adjoining the actual border. Its purpose was to provide the guards with an early warning of an escape attempt. The fence itself was not a particularly formidable obstacle, standing only [...] high. At the top, middle and bottom, rows of electrified barbed wire strands were attached to insulators. Cutting the wires or pulling them out of place resulted in an alarm being activated, alerting the guards to a possible breach of the fence. In practice, though, the border guards found that the fence frequently malfunctioned. The signal fence also had a [...] control strip on its eastern side. The fence was built on open high ground wherever possible, to ensure that intruders would be <b>silhouetted</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> sky and thus be more easily spotted. By mid-1989, [...] of signal fencing had been constructed along the border.|$|E
2500|$|Upon the {{outbreak}} of World War II, Lieutenant Commander Lent and Triton were assigned to Submarine Division 62. Triton made a training cruise to Midway from August 30 to September 15, then participated in local and fleet operations in the Hawaiian area. On November 19, Lent headed west to conduct a practice war patrol and arrived off Wake Island on November 26. On December 8, he saw columns of smoke rising over the island but assumed it was caused by construction work being done ashore. That night, when he surfaced to charge batteries, he was informed by radio Wake and Pearl Harbor had been bombed and was ordered {{to stay out of}} range of Wake's guns. The next morning, Lent observed the Japanese bombing the island. On the night of December 10, [...] he was surfaced, charging batteries, when flashes of light from Wake revealed a destroyer or light cruiser on a parallel course. The submarine was <b>silhouetted</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> moon, and the enemy ship turned towards. Lent went deep and began evasive action.|$|E
