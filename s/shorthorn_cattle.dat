6000|$|What man has {{effected}} within {{recent times}} in England by methodical selection is clearly shown by our exhibitions of improved quadrupeds and fancy birds. With respect to cattle, sheep, and pigs, we owe their great improvement {{to a long}} series of well-known names--Bakewell, Coiling, Ellman, Bates, Jonas Webb, Lords Leicester and Western, Fisher Hobbs, and others. Agricultural writers are unanimous on the power of selection: any number of statements to this effect could be quoted; a few will suffice. Youatt, a sagacious and experienced observer, writes (20/2. 'On Sheep' 1838 page 60.) the principle of selection is [...] "that which enables the agriculturist, not only to modify the character of his flock, but to change it altogether." [...] A great breeder of Shorthorns (20/3. Mr. J. Wright on <b>Shorthorn</b> <b>Cattle</b> in 'Journal of Royal Agricult. Soc.' volume 7 pages 208, 209.) says, [...] "In the anatomy of the shoulder modern breeders have made great improvement on the Ketton shorthorns by correcting the defect in the knuckle or shoulder-joint, and by laying the top of the shoulder more snugly in the crop, and thereby filling up the hollow behind it...The eye has its fashion at different periods: at one time the eye high and outstanding from the head, and at another time the sleepy eye sunk into the head; but these extremes have merged into the medium of a full, clear and prominent eye with a placid look." ...|$|E
60|$|Boyd Dawkins {{believes}} that the park-cattle are descended from anciently domesticated, and not truly wild animals; and from the occasional appearance of dark-coloured calves, it is improbable that the aboriginal Bos primigenius was white. It is curious what a strong, though not invariable, tendency there is in wild or escaped cattle to become white with coloured ears, under widely different conditions of life. If the old writers Boethius and Leslie (3/52. Boethius was born in 1470; 'Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.' volume 2 1839 page 281; and volume 4 1849 page 424.) can be trusted, the wild cattle of Scotland were white and furnished with a great mane; but the colour of their ears is not mentioned. In Wales (3/53. 'Youatt on Cattle' 1834 page 48: See also page 242, on <b>shorthorn</b> <b>cattle.</b> Bell in his 'British Quadrupeds' page 423 states that, after long attending to the subject, he has found that white cattle invariably have coloured ears.), during the tenth century, some of the cattle are described as being white with red ears. Four hundred cattle thus coloured were sent to King John; and an early record speaks of a hundred cattle with red ears having been demanded as a compensation for some offence, but, if the cattle were of a dark or black colour, 150 were to be presented. The black cattle of North Wales apparently belong, as we have seen, to the small longifrons type: and as the alternative was offered of either 150 dark cattle, or 100 white cattle with red ears, {{we may presume that}} the latter were the larger beasts, and probably belonged to the primigenius type. Youatt has remarked that at the present day, whenever cattle of the shorthorn breed are white, the extremities of their ears are more or less tinged with red.|$|E
60|$|During the {{formation}} or improvement of a breed, its members {{will always be}} found to vary much in those characters to which especial attention is directed, and of which each slight improvement is eagerly sought and selected. Thus, with short-faced tumbler-pigeons, the shortness of the beak, shape of head and plumage,--with carriers, {{the length of the}} beak and wattle,--with fantails, the tail and carriage,--with Spanish fowls, the white face and comb,--with long-eared rabbits, the length of ear, are all points which are eminently variable. So it is in every case; and the large price paid for first-rate animals proves the difficulty of breeding them up to the highest standard of excellence. This subject has been discussed by fanciers (21/55. 'Cottage Gardener' 1855 December page 171; 1856 January pages 248, 323.), and the greater prizes given for highly improved breeds, in comparison with those given for old breeds which are not now undergoing rapid improvement, have been fully justified. Nathusius makes (21/56. 'Ueber Shorthorn Rindvieh' 1857 s. 51.) a similar remark when discussing the less uniform character of improved <b>Shorthorn</b> <b>cattle</b> and of the English horse, in comparison, for example, with the unennobled cattle of Hungary, or with the horses of the Asiatic steppes. This want of uniformity in the parts which at the time are undergoing selection chiefly depends on the strength of the principle of reversion; but it likewise depends to a certain extent on the continued variability of the parts which have recently varied. That the same parts do continue varying in the same manner we must admit, for if it were not so, there could be no improvement beyond an early standard of excellence, and we know that such improvement is not only possible, but is of general occurrence.|$|E
