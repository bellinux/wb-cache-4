40|$|Air {{traffic demand}} has been {{increasing}} {{over the years and}} is still expected to grow. At airports where capacity is scarce, the current practice is to quantify it in terms of “slots” and is allocated, especially in Europe, following administrative procedures and best practices. The current slot allocation process is long, non optimised, and requires a large amount of communications among airspace users and <b>slot</b> <b>coordinators.</b> In this paper, we propose SOSTA, an integer linear programming model for optimisation of the slot allocation process on the European scale. In addition to applying all the regulations and best practices currently in use, SOSTA deals with all airports simultaneously, which may strongly increase the effectiveness of the early allocation phases. In an experimental analysis based on the real data of the busiest day in 2013 air traffic, we show the benefits of this simultaneous allocation, along with the capabilities of SOSTA and its extremely good computational performance...|$|R
30|$|Civil air {{transportation}} {{is an example}} of a complex socio-technical system. Each airport comprises of interactions between a variety of facilities, users, technical systems, human resources, rules, and procedures, and is embedded in a large network of other airports, multiple airlines, and ATM centers. This type of complex socio-technical systems is characterized by a large number of interconnected parts, the difficulty to predict the behavior, and the existence of many different stakeholders (Forrester 1971; 6061). Moreover, in civil {{air transportation}}, different parties are involved in the operation of an airport with varying boundaries of responsibility per region or country. At Amsterdam Airport Schiphol for instance, the parties involved in air transport related operations include the airport operator, the airport authority, the ministry of infrastructure and environment, the <b>slot</b> <b>coordinators,</b> the air navigation service provider, the airlines, as well as the general public (Deregee 2006). All these stakeholders have a certain viewpoint on performance which adds to the airport complexity (Bouarfa et al. 2012). In addition, each airport is characterized by a number of runways, taxiways, navigational aids, stop-bars, markings, and so on. Technology plays a central role in the airport system as does the social context within which the system is operating. This makes major airports by their very own nature complex socio-technical systems.|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} slot allocation mechanism, {{based on}} the International Air Transport Association (IATA) system and its complementary version of the European Union (EU) regulation, produces rather poor capacity allocation outcomes for congested EU airports since it fails to properly match slots requested with slots allocated to airlines. Inefficiencies during the initial allocation are mainly due to the problem complexity in conjunction to limited decision support available to <b>slot</b> <b>coordinators.</b> On the other hand, substantial inefficiencies give rise to severe slot misuse and unreasonably low utilisation of airport resources running already into scarcity. The objective {{of this paper is}} to develop an optimisation-based model implementing the existing EU/IATA rules, operational constraints, and coordination procedures with the ultimate objective to better accommodate airlines’ preferences at coordinated airports through the minimisation of the difference between the requested and the allocated slot times to airlines. The results of the model are assessed and compared vis-à-vis the allocation outcome produced according to current slot coordination practice in three regional Greek airports. The proposed model produces very promising results and demonstrates that there is large room for improvement of the efficiency of the current allocation outcome in a range between 14 % and 95 %. The discussion of the model results is complemented by a sensitivity analysis highlighting the importance of declared capacity and the magnitude of its influence on slot allocation efficiency...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} two {{stochastic programming}} {{models for the}} allocation of time slots over a network of airports. The proposed models address three key issues. First, they provide an optimization tool to allocate time slots, which takes several operational aspects and airline preferences into account; second, they execute the process on a network of airports; and third they explicitly include uncertainty. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, these are the first models for time slot allocation to consider both the stochastic nature of capacity reductions and the problem's network structure. From a practical viewpoint, the proposed models provide important insights for the allocation of time slots. Specifically, they highlight the tradeoff between the schedule/request discrepancies, i. e., the time difference between allocated time slots and airline requests, and operational delays. Increasing schedule/request discrepancies enables a reduction in operational delays. Moreover, the models are computationally viable. A set of realistic test instances that consider the scheduling of four calendar days on different European airport networks has been solved within reasonable - for the application's context - computation times. In one of our test instances, we were able to reduce the sum of schedule/request discrepancies and operational delays by up to 58 %. This work provides <b>slot</b> <b>coordinators</b> with a valuable decision making tool, and it indicates that the proposed approach is very promising and may lead to relevant monetary savings for airlines and aircraft operators. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Targeting {{the medical}} {{monitoring}} applications of wireless body area networks (WBANs), a hybrid {{medium access control}} protocol using an interrupt mechanism (I-MAC) is proposed to improve the energy and time slot utilization efficiency and to meet the data delivery delay requirement at the same time. Unlike existing hybrid MAC protocols, a superframe structure with a longer length is adopted to avoid unnecessary beacons. The time slots are mostly allocated to nodes with periodic data sources. Short interruption slots are inserted into the superframe to convey the urgent data and to guarantee the real-time requirements of these data. During these interruption <b>slots,</b> the <b>coordinator</b> can break the running superframe and start a new superframe. A contention access period (CAP) is only activated when there are more data {{that need to be}} delivered. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed MAC protocol in WBANs with low urgent traffic...|$|R
30|$|The IEEE 802.15. 4 e {{standard}} {{defines the}} LLDN that {{is described as}} follows: a superframe is divided into a beacon slot and timeslots of equal length which are assigned to specific nodes. A coordinator periodically transmits beacons for synchronization with the superframe structure. Each timeslot is able to be assigned to exactly one node, called a slot owner, which has access privilege in the timeslot, namely, it transmits without using CSMA. Provided {{that more than one}} node wishes to transmit in a timeslot, which is referred to as a shared group timeslot, any nodes except a coordinator transmit using CSMA. In a shared group time <b>slot,</b> a <b>coordinator</b> broadcasts a clear to send (CTS) shared group frame to indicate that the timeslot is not used by the slot owner. Then, a node sends a request to send (RTS) frame and waits for a CTS frame from the coordinator in a response to it. After data transmission of other nodes, the coordinator can fully or partly occupy a timeslot for data transmission as well.|$|R
30|$|A popular MAC {{standard}} {{described by}} IEEE 802.15. 4 for {{wireless sensor networks}} and actuator networks defines two operating modes: non-beacon-enabled mode where the receivers are always awake to receive a frame and beacon-enabled mode which describes super frames where the nodes are only awake during {{a small part of}} a super frame and they sleep quite often. In the second mode, significant traffic results in frequent collisions and packet losses which causes an increase in energy consumption and low throughput. To operate IEEE 802.15. 4 with low duty cycles needs MAC parameter adjustment to attain low energy consumption. The beacon-enabled mode behavior is analyzed in [38] to define the main performance bottlenecks. The adaptation method is referred to as ABE where a coordinator observes the number of idle slots before a transmission starts. However, a node consumes energy to observe idle slots because it needs to be awake. This problem is solved by delegating tracking of idle <b>slots</b> to the <b>coordinator</b> that always needs to stay awake during the active period. ABE is compared with the IEEE 802.15. 4 standard configured with static backoff exponent which specifies the size of the contention window values. Results show that ABE provides optimal throughput without considering the number of nodes. The value of the contention window which optimizes throughput is found by the coordinator in ABE. The adaptation mechanism in ABE which adjusts the optimal contention window values yields high throughputs along with low duty cycles, leading to low energy dissipation.|$|R
40|$|The master {{thesis is}} a {{prototyping}} project of a wireless body area network (WBANs) for patient monitoring in hospitals. The {{goal of this}} project was to study various technologies suitable for wireless body area networks, complete a requirement analysis, design a WBAN suitable to achieve the requirements and to test and evaluate the system against the requirements. Seven sensor end nodes are chosen to monitor seven vital signs for patient monitoring. After studying different technologies suitable for WBANs, IEEE 802. 15. 4 j was chosen because it communicates in a special allocation of medical spectrum of 2360 to 2400 MHz. A coordinator or master will {{be the center of}} the network using a star topology. Due to certain limitations in the firmware of the NXP FRDMKW 40 Z, IEEE 802. 15. 4 j had to be dropped and IEEE 802. 15. 4 was the final chosen technology because the only difference between IEEE 802. 15. 4 j and IEEE 802. 15. 4 is the difference in the physical layer, while the developed application remains the same, making the shift back to IEEE 802. 15. 4 j, in the future, simple. There have been several projects working on the same idea with IEEE 802. 15. 4, but they do not combine multiple sensors to form a network and the total throughput requirements for this thesis project are much higher. The beacon mode and the non-beacon mode of IEEE 802. 15. 4 are studied. Non beacon mode is unpredictable due to the use of carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) to access the medium. When multiple end nodes compete to get access to the medium, unreliability is introduced into the system. In the beacon mode, because of the slotted CSMA access of sixteen equally spaced time slots for communication, there is a restriction of the size of a time slot and thus, the high throughput requirement of the system is not met. The solution proposed in the thesis project is to develop a custom time slot system in the non-beacon mode, where each end node is granted a reserved time slot of a specific length as required by the end node. There is a timer mechanism which makes sure that the time slots for each device maintain the time limit on the time slot, {{on the side of the}} main master/coordinator of the network and on the side of the end node. The protocol for an end node to join a personal area network (PAN) is called as the association process. The association process enables the end node to be a part of a PAN to exchange its sensor data. Traditionally, in IEEE 802. 15. 4, the end nodes scan the sixteen IEEE 802. 15. 4 channels and when an appropriate coordinator is found, the end node initiates the association process with the coordinator. The solution proposed for the formation of the network by the association process is to use two different technologies. The end nodes and the coordinator exchange information using near field communication (NFC) technology by a simple tapping mechanism. The end node has an active NFC tag while the coordinator has an NFC reader. During the tap between the two devices, first the coordinator reads the end node data from the active tag. This data is required to form the custom time <b>slot.</b> Next the <b>coordinator</b> writes all association information into the active tag. After the NFC data exchange is done, the end node initiates the traditional IEEE 802. 15. 4 association protocol to join the coordinator’s PAN. Similarly after seven end nodes are associated to the coordinator, the network begins to function. All the end nodes communicate their data to the coordinator. The coordinator collects all the sensor data from the seven end nodes and may send the cumulative sensor data to the backend database servers which may be viewed by the medical authorities, this part is not included in the current version of the project. Several tests are run on this system to evaluate the requirements of latency, throughput and quality of service with two different ranges of 20 cm and 250 cm. The latency of association between the coordinator and end node is 632 ms. The required throughput is met by the network. The packet delivery rate of the system is always above 99 %. The graphs for packet delivery rates for all the sensors with a range of 20 cm and 250 cm are shown in the appendices. The probabilities for the packet delivery rates greater than 90 %, 99 %, 99. 9 % and 99. 99 % are also graphically shown using a normal distribution in the appendices...|$|R
