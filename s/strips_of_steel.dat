5|$|The aircraft's {{construction}} was a novelty for the time. In {{contrast to the}} monoplane described in the July 1910 patent application, the exhibit was a sesquiplane which complicated the construction, but in return solved lateral stability control issues. The cantilevered wings were held in place at three points by tubular steel struts without any bracing from flying wires. According to Coandă's description the wings were built with metal spars, but existing photographs of the construction show a completely wooden internal structure. The trailing edges of the upper wing could be twisted separately or together for lateral control or braking during landing, and were controlled by pedals in the two-seat open cockpit. The fuselage, painted reddish-brown and highly polished, was described by The Technical World magazine as having a framework of steel, though the construction photographs indicate {{that it had a}} wooden framework. This was triangular in cross-section with convex ribs edged with <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel,</b> and strengthened with a covering of heat-shaped moulded plywood. Tubular radiators for engine cooling were located {{on either side of the}} cockpit. The vertical struts from the wings were secured to the fuselage with steel collars fixed with screws. The fuselage terminated in a cruciform empennage with control surfaces at 45° angles to vertical and horizontal. Four triangular surfaces at the rear of the tail were controlled using a pair of large Antoinette VII-style steering wheels mounted outside of the cockpit, one on each side, and were used for pitch and directional control. It was an early instance of what are now known as ruddervators. Forward of the tail was a small horizontal stabiliser. The fuel tank was located in the fuselage between the engine and the cockpit.|$|E
25|$|The Land Rover was {{designed}} to only be in production {{for two or three}} years to gain some cash flow and export orders for the Rover Company so it could restart up-market car production. Once car production restarted, however, it was greatly outsold by the off-road Land Rover, which developed into its own brand that remains successful today. Many of the defining and successful features of the Land Rover design were in fact the result of Rover's drive to simplify the tooling required for the vehicle and to use the minimum amount of rationed materials. As well as the aluminium alloy bodywork (which has been retained throughout production despite it now being more expensive than a conventional steel body due to its ideal properties of light weight and corrosion resistance) other examples include the distinctive flat body panels with only simple, constant-radius curves (originally used because they could be cut and formed by hand from aluminium sheet on a basic jig) and the sturdy box-section ladder chassis, which on Series vehicles was made up from four <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> welded at each side to form a box, thus cutting down on the complex welding operations required when making a more conventional U- or I-section frame.|$|E
2500|$|The {{initial impact}} {{was at a}} point [...] below water at the [...] "Scola piccola" [...] , the most seaward exposed rock of Le Scole, which tore a [...] gash in the ship's port side below the water line. The impact sheared two long <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> from the ship's hull; these were later found on the seabed [...] from the main island.

50|$|Before the mid 19th {{century when}} cheap mild steel became {{available}} due to {{new methods of}} steelmaking, knives (and other edged tools) were made by welding a <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> on to the piece of iron {{that was to be}} formed into a knife, or sandwiching a <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> between two pieces of iron. This was done because steel was then a much more expensive commodity than iron. Modern blades are sometimes laminated, but for a different reason. Since the hardest steel is brittle, a layer <b>of</b> hard <b>steel</b> may be laid between two layers of a milder, less brittle steel, for a blade that keeps a sharp edge well, and is less likely to break in service.|$|R

50|$|John Wesley Hyatt was {{a printer}} by trade and a {{prolific}} inventor who secured over 250 patents, the first issued in 1861 for a knife grinder. His chemical experiments {{led to the}} invention of celluloid.In 1888 {{he was working on}} a mill for crushing sugar cane, but lacked adequate bearings. His solution was a roller bearing where the rollers were made from coiled <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel,</b> and he patented his invention.The helical-shaped rollers made from flat spring steel were more flexible than solid-cylinder rollers, did not heat up and lock due to friction, and lasted longer.Later Hyatt introduced refinements, with the bearings assembled within a closed cage.|$|E
50|$|A {{shaker screen}} {{consists}} of the following parts:*Screen Frame- Much like a canvas for painting a screen has to be supported on a frame {{in order to do}} its job, this frame differs between manufacturers in both material and shape. Screen frames can be made from materials such as, square steel tubing, flat steel sheets, plastic type composites or they can just be supported on the ends with <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> (similar idea to a scroll). These frames consist of a rectangular shaped outer perimeter which is divided into small individual inner panels. These smaller panels differ in shape from manufacturer to manufacturer and have been known to come in shapes such as square, hexagonal, rectangular and even triangular.|$|E

50|$|The {{track was}} made by bolting seven layers of wood. In most places on the ride, there were two layers of {{southern}} yellow pine, which sat atop five layers of Douglas-Fir. Older sections of track still had seven layers of Douglas-Fir (mostly on the lift) and there were refurbished sections of track with seven layers of southern pine. A 7 in <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> was bolted onto {{the top layer of}} wood track and three-inch-wide pieces <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> were bolted onto the sides.|$|R

5000|$|The {{inventor}} of cat's eyes was Percy Shaw of Boothtown, Halifax, West Yorkshire, England. When the tram-lines were removed {{in the nearby}} suburb of Ambler Thorn, he realised {{that he had been}} using the polished <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> to navigate at night. The name [...] "cat's eye" [...] comes from Shaw's inspiration for the device: the eyeshine reflecting from the eyes of a cat. In 1934, he patented his invention (patent No. 436,290 and 457,536), and on 15 March 1935, founded Reflecting Roadstuds Limited in Halifax to manufacture the items. The name Catseye is their trademark. The reflective lens had been invented six years earlier for use in advertising signs by Richard Hollins Murray, an accountant from Herefordshire and, as Shaw acknowledged, they had contributed to his idea.|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss the}} work done at MISG 2004 on the {{mathematical}} modelling of a long, electric radiant furnace used to anneal <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel.</b> The strip is passed continuously through the furnace. The annealing process involves heating the steel to certain temperatures and then cooling it, resulting in {{a change in the}} crystalline structure of the steel. The furnace settings are often changed to cater for products with different metallurgical properties and varying dimensions. The mathematical model is desired to optimise the running of the furnace, especially during periods of change in furnace operation. 1...|$|E
30|$|The high {{temperatures}} within a steel annealing furnace preclude any reliable {{way to take}} measurements of the temperature; hence the need for mathematical models so that the temperature can be computed. We model an electric radiant annealing furnace with length of order 100 metres through which <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> sheet pass at speeds of up to 130 metres per minute {{in order to achieve}} the strip temperatures required for annealing. A schematic diagram of the furnace is shown in Fig. 4. The temperature along the furnace is controlled by varying the power supplied to the heating elements and the line speed through the furnace is reduced for strips of large thickness and width in order to achieve the required temperatures within the steel strips. At the beginning of the annealing–coating line there is an automatic welding process which welds {{the beginning of a new}} coil of steel sheet to the end of its predecessor, allowing the line to run continuously.|$|E
50|$|Attempts {{were made}} to record the transits of a star {{photographic}}ally.

The exposing shutter was a thin <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel,</b> fixed to the armature of an electromagnet. The plate thus recorded a series of dots or short lines, and the vertical wires were photographed on the plate by throwing light through the objective lens for one or two seconds.|$|R
5000|$|Belbroughton was at {{the core}} of the North Worcestershire scythe-making district. [...] Many of the mills of the area were {{formerly}} blade mills used for sharpening them, after a scythesmith had forged them from iron, with a thin <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> along the cutting edge. From the late 18th century until about 1870, the Waldron family of Field House Clent were the leading manufacturers. They were succeeded by Isaac Nash, whose business finally closed in about 1970. Scythes were formerly not just made in Belbroughton, but also several adjacent parishes, including Chaddesley Corbett.|$|R
50|$|The first wobbly web wheel was {{a design}} for a pulley centre, circa 1884. A {{straight}} <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel,</b> with width the radius of the wheel, was folded into sharp corrugations. This accordion pleat was then fanned into a circle, the inner folds being closer than the outer. This disc was then cast into an iron hub and folded tabs {{on the outside of}} the sheet riveted to the pulley rim. These pulleys were produced by J & E Hall of Dartford. Plans were also made to develop this into a railway wheel, with the corrugations pressed into the shape of a half-torus.|$|R
40|$|A {{large scale}} {{atmospheric}} corrosion trial extending {{over five years}} is currently being conducted at Belmont Beach near Newcastle, Australia. The intent is to obtain information {{about the effects of}} orientation, height and bold exposure versus shielding effects as well as detailed chronological observations and variability data for nominally identical exposures. Such comprehensive data has not previously been obtained for the one site and under the one local climatic regime for all coupons. This provides a much better and more controlled environment in which to compare the various effects. Failure to achieve this in previous studies renders the study of such influences problematic. Also, variability of nominally identically exposed coupons has not previously been given attention. The paper deals with the three-year results and compares these with information available in the literature. After three years most of the boldly exposed coupons have completely corroded but most of the single sided coupons remain in varying degrees. A comparison is given between individual coupons exposed at different heights and single <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> exposed over the same vertical distance...|$|E
40|$|Comprehensive {{new data}} {{for the effects of}} orientation, height and bold {{exposure}} versus shielding effects and detailed chronological observations and variability data for nominally identical exposures of mild steel coupons all exposed at one site is presented. Previous investigations have been reported only for different sites and this raises difficulties in making comparisons and deductions. The present results have been obtained under the one local climatic regime for all coupons, thus providing a much more controlled environment within which to compare various effects. The present paper deals with the five-year results and compares these with information available in the literature. After three years most of the boldly exposed double-sided coupons had completely corroded but many singlesided coupons remained viable. The difference in corrosion behaviour between individual coupons exposed at different heights and vertical continuous single <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> is described. Moreover, the difference in corrosion losses for a continuous strip and for a series of coupons oriented in different directions is described. Furthermore, variability of nominally identically exposed coupons is reported...|$|E
40|$|The {{accurate}} {{control of}} springback {{in the cold}} forming of narrow strips of integrated circuit leadframes becomes highly essential for the semi-conductor industry {{in order to be}} able to meet stringent requirements for very high lead count packages. However, most of the studies on the problems of the springback of sheet metals are based on wide strips. In the present study, a special cantilever-type forming jig has been designed to investigate the springback of narrow <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> and copper alloy at various die radii, die angles and die gaps. This forming jig is equipped with an advanced on-line automated imaging system to measure the springback angle of the strips. The springback was found to increase with increase of the die radius, the die angle and the die gap. Significant anisotropy in the sheet materials led to different springback behaviours for different sheet orientations. The findings of this paper can be used as a guideline for designers in the design of tools for the roller forming of integrated circuit leadframes.

This paper describes the fabrication of a demonstrator motor and presents experimental results to validate the theoretical calculations. Experimental motor performance results are also reported and compared with those of a slotted motor that fits within the same active radial dimensions as the slotless motor.
