5|$|Other {{immunotherapy}} treatments {{interfere with}} the binding of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) protein with its ligand PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1). Signaling through PD-1 inactivates T cells. Some cancer cells appear to exploit this by expressing PD-L1 in order to <b>switch</b> <b>off</b> T cells that might recognise them as a threat. Monoclonal antibodies targeting both PD-1 and PD-L1, such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab are currently in clinical trials for treatment for lung cancer.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the highly}} skilled nature {{required}} for playing the agung, {{it is not uncommon}} to see agung players have friendly rivalries during a performance, using tricks in an attempt to throw others off-beat. For instance, if the p’nanggisa’s elaborations are so elusive that the p’mals has a hard time ornamenting or if the reversed happens and the p’mals ornaments to the point the p’nanggisa’s performance is engulfed, the player that cannot keep up is usually embarrassed, becoming the butt of jokes. Normally agung players <b>switch</b> <b>off</b> after each piece, but during instances like this where one player cannot handle the part being played, players either remain at their gongs or switch during the performance. It is also possible for agung players to switch places with the dabakan after two pieces. Even though the players compete, they still understand they are a single entity, closely accompanying the melody, employ different variations without destroying the music’s basic patterns.|$|E
5|$|McCudden's {{tenure at}} the aerodrome began ominously. The same day he was granted a request to travel as an {{observer}} in a Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2, disaster struck which could conceivably have ended his career. Instructed to familiarise himself with the aircraft around the airfield he examined a Caudron Type A, and proceeded {{to turn over the}} engine. The aircraft was listed as unserviceable and McCudden saw no danger in leaving the throttle fully open. Suddenly the engine started and it accelerated out of the hangar and into a Farman MF.11. McCudden watched as the propeller chewed the wing to pieces and damaged his Commanding Officer's car which had been parked nearby. He was able to reach the cockpit and <b>switch</b> <b>off</b> the ignition but not before extensive damage had been done. For this misdemeanor he was brought before Colonel Frederick Sykes, commanding the RFC Military Wing. Sykes was pleased with his overall progress, which likely saved him, but sentenced McCudden to seven days detention and a forfeiture of 14 days pay for the incident. Five years later Sykes again met McCudden—then {{at the height of his}} fame—and chaffed him on the episode, even jokingly threatening to send him a bill for the car.|$|E

25|$|Supporters {{say that}} the total {{electricity}} generated from a large-scale array of dispersed wind farms, located in different wind regimes, cannot be accurately described as intermittent, {{because it does not}} start up or <b>switch</b> <b>off</b> instantaneously at irregular intervals.

25|$|RCDs are {{designed}} to disconnect the circuit {{if there is a}} leakage current. By detecting small leakage currents (typically 5–30 mA) and disconnecting quickly enough (<30 ms), they may prevent electrocution.

Tyne Tees was the penultimate region to cease broadcasting in analogue, which occurred during September 2012. Tyne Tees took over the relay transmitter at Berwick-upon-Tweed in December 2006 from Border Television in order to extend the deadline of the town's upgrade to digital TV by four years, since Border was the first to <b>switch</b> <b>off</b> its analogue signal in 2008.|$|E

25|$|Once a {{fault is}} detected, the circuit breaker {{contacts}} must open {{to interrupt the}} circuit; This is commonly done using mechanically stored energy contained within the breaker, such as a spring or compressed air to separate the contacts. Circuit breakers may also use the higher current caused by the fault to separate the contacts, such as thermal expansion or a magnetic field. Small circuit breakers typically have a manual control lever to <b>switch</b> <b>off</b> the load or reset a tripped breaker, while larger units use solenoids to trip the mechanism, and electric motors to restore energy to the springs.|$|E
25|$|Apart from {{restoring}} staff morale, Dyke laid {{claim to}} two major achievements during his office. In 2002, he introduced the Freeview terrestrial digital transmission platform with six additional BBC channels, and persuaded Sky TV {{to join the}} consortium. Previously this was an ITV subscription service that had closed with major losses, but by mid-2007 it could be seen {{by more than half}} the population. After leaving the BBC, he said that he always realised that the introduction of Freeview helped to prevent a subscription funding model for the BBC gain traction, because it is impossible for broadcasters to <b>switch</b> <b>off</b> the signal to individual Freeview boxes.|$|E
