5000|$|In 1967 Hydranautics, now Bardex Corporation, designed, patented, {{manufactured}} {{and delivered}} the first shiplift using chain instead of wire rope. These Shiplifts differ distinctly {{in the use}} of hydraulic Chain Jacks and <b>Stud</b> <b>Link</b> Anchor Chain to lift commercial ships, naval vessels and submarines. [...] The five distinct advantages to the Bardex Chain Jack Shiplift are: 1) Chain is inherently less susceptible to corrosion and bending fatigue as any chain corrosion is visible on the outside surfaces as opposed to wire rope. For this reason, Lloyd’s shipping register requires 20% of wire ropes to be removed and destructively tested each year with all wire ropes to be replaced every 5-10 years. Lloyd’s does not stipulate any specific duty life limitations for chains which have been known to last for over 20 years in operation.2) Traditional wire rope shiplift systems rely on synchronous motors powering the winches. These motors cause a large power demand on the system when started. Hydraulic systems start at no load so there is no excessive inrush current demand.3) The use of dual chains for redundancy in lieu of a single wire rope at each hoist provides extra safety and reliability.4) Use of chain allows incremental mechanical synchronization of the entire lift operation. The chain links are made to very tight fabrication tolerances so that after each jacking stroke, the platform is set down on the next set of chain links and the level has been “reset”. Wire rope hoist by comparison can become cumulatively unsynchronized over the duration of a lift requiring the operation to stop and be adjusted.4) At all times the shiplift and the vessel are mechanically held by chain resting on support pins not relying on a braking system. 5) Holding the rigid shiplift platform at the correct elevation for Transfer Operations is a locked mechanical function as the chain is pinned in position without the deflection inherent in wire rope systems. A Bardex Shiplift has never dropped a vessel.|$|E

The effects of this imposed twist can seriously affect strength and fatigue endurance. In order to predict the torsional interactions between components {{it is necessary to}} quantify the tension/torsion behavior of all the different categories of mooring line component, not just the six strand rope.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to develop a}} methodology for assessing the structural integrity of mooring components for offshore applications. Finite element calculations were performed {{in order to determine the}} stress levels in studless and <b>stud</b> chain <b>links</b> as well as to evaluate the critical regions of the links. A study was also developed based on the concept of critical volume associated with the material volume susceptible to a certain critical crack size. The results showed that the studless chain links present a higher critical volume than that related to the <b>stud</b> chain <b>links,</b> fact that confirms the beneficial effect of the stud. According to the crack assessment procedure the critical crack length is smaller for the <b>stud</b> chain <b>links.</b> However, the critical association between volume and crack size turns the studless chain links more susceptible to brittle fracture than the <b>stud</b> chain <b>links...</b>|$|R

40|$|Mooring {{systems of}} {{floating}} structures consist of long lengths of chain, rope or wire, {{or a combination}} of these elements. As part of a station-keeping system, the mooring lines have to keep the movements of the structure to a minimum. The mooring lines have to withstand the loads acting on the moored structure in addition to loads acting directly on the mooring components. If a mooring line fails, the floating structure can lose station and cause severe damage to structures and environment as well as economic losses and loss of lives. Awareness of corrosion, wear, fatigue and relevant loading conditions during design will improve the design and extend the service life of the structural components. The overall goal {{of this study is to}} find out how mooring chains work as structural components. The theory part of the report includes a study of offshore loading conditions, different types of mooring systems, causes of mooring line failure, failure detection of mooring lines and fatigue. However, there is a special focus on mooring chains. Offshore standards and recommended practices provide common chain link designs and minimum mechanical properties of links, but in order to study chain links as structural components, the stresses and strains are of importance. Normal stresses in chain links are calculated analytical using classic beam theory and curved beam theory. In addition, three-dimensional elastoplastic finite element models are applied for a more detailed investigation on the stress distribution in chain links. The presented analyses are limited to chains subjected to pure tension, although torsion and bending due to interlink friction may occur. Both <b>stud</b> <b>links</b> and studless links are analyzed in the computer program Abaqus 6. 12. Mooring components as chain links enter in operation with a residual stress field created by the required proof test. However, traditional design of mooring chains does not consider the presence of residual stresses [1 - 3]. This study shows that residual stresses play an important role. When residual stresses are added to the operational stresses, the resulting maximum tensile stress is 3. 65 and 3. 30 times the nominal stress for <b>stud</b> <b>links</b> and studless links respectively. The maximum tensile stress is located at the link surface at the crown section. Such tensile stress concentrations at the surface of a material are unfavorable due to fatigue crack propagation. Both whole links and worn links are modeled with Abaqus 6. 12, using solid elements. The worn links have a reduction of cross-sectional diameter of 2. 6 % to 13. 2 %. Wear will reduce the cross-sectional area and cause some sharp edges, but at the same time increase the contact area. The positive effects of wear seem to surpass the negative effects of wear when the wear is moderate. </p...|$|R

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The study {{involved}} a detail empirical {{investigation into the}} different road studs in use on South Africa’s national road network and how they performed on the network under different road conditions {{in order to establish}} which road stud, under what conditions, offers best value for money in terms of life-cycle cost for the South African National Roads Agency Limited. These main questions were asked: What is the most cost-effective/value-for-money stud option for SANRAL to choose for each of the specified road categories? Under which conditions do the studs perform differently and what is the most likely mode of failure of specific <b>studs</b> <b>linked</b> to a specific road condition and road category? The South African and Australian road stud standards were reviewed to gain understanding of which criteria one has to consider when evaluating road studs and what information would be needed for the research. Similar studies on road studs were reviewed to compare the criteria that were looked at, namely Guidelines for the use of Raised Pavement Markers, developed by the Department of Transport in the United States, and Feasibility of using accelerated pavement testing to evaluate the long term performance of raised pavement markers, a research paper by the Florida Department of Transport. This research made use of a standardised questionnaire containing questions on various elements found to be key to the road stud performance. The study was done on approximately 4 659 km of roads in SANRAL’s Western region, consisting of the Western Cape and Northern Cape. From the literature review, it was identified {{that there is a need}} for the SABS standards to be updated to include the testing of structural properties of studs. SANRAL should look at the lack in specification requirements when asking for the installation of road studs. From the data available it was observed that the preferred studs were the Ferro Lynx followed by the STA+ 52 stud. They are predominantly used on the roads that were included in the survey. They perform well on the national roads. The data suggests that these two studs and the Rhino stud are the best-performing studs with the least dislodgement and loss in reflectivity. The STA+ 52 and Rhino stud, however, are fairly new on the market and more data for theirs full life cycle should be obtained for further monitoring The regression analysis indicated that 36 per cent of the variation in the reflectivity of the Ferro Lynx stud can be explained by the surface width of the road, the traffic volume measured as ELVS and the period installed. All the coefficients were significant with a 5 per cent significance. The prediction tables on the weighted data set, indicated that one should always consider width of road when choosing a road stud and that the reflectivity of studs deteriorates most on the narrower roads...|$|R

Beatrice was seated next Grier, and on her other side was a young man of the type which Tavernake detested, partly because it {{inspired}} him with a reluctant but insistent sense of inferiority.

His evening clothes fitted him perfectly, his <b>studs</b> and <b>links</b> were of the latest mode, his white tie arranged as though by the fingers of an artist. And yet he was no tailor's model.

Beatrice laughed often into his face. She admired him, of course. How could she help it! Grier sat at her other side. He, too, talked to her whenever he had the chance. It was a new fever which Tavernake was tasting, a new fever burning in his blood. He was jealous; he hated the whole party below. In imagination he saw Elizabeth with her friends, supping most likely in that other, more resplendent restaurant, only a few yards away. He imagined her the centre of every attention. Without a doubt, she was looking at her neighbor as she had looked at him. Tavernake bit his lip, frowning. If he had had it in his power, in those black moments, to have thrown a thunderbolt from his place, he would have wrecked every table in the room, he would have watched with joy the white, startled faces of the revelers as they fled away into the night.

40|$|Unpredictable {{fracture}} of round steel link chains reduce the economic {{efficiency of the}} machines they are used in and increase the hazard potential for the operating personnel. In order to reduce such incidents appropriate measures for early detection are needed to determine an optimum time of repair or replacement. By steadily increasing strain, the currently applied, discontinuous and manually performed control processes does not present a satisfactory solution. They should be supplemented with new, {{the current state of}} the art considering approaches. This thesis addresses these issues and depicts the evaluation results of an individually developed measurement system for chains including the acquisition and processing of lifetime related variables. The focus hereby lies on standardized round steel link chains, which are preferably used in mining or in the hoisting equipment. Relevant damages to chains can be largely attributed to mechanical overstress of the base material. Typical damage patterns are fatigue fractures and forced fractures that are favoured depending on the environmental conditions, through wear and corrosion. As well-proven approach to estimate the remaining lifetime, the method of calculation of service strength was established. In adaptation to the use case chain, a component specific S-N curve and a nominal-stress-time-curve associated to collective stress are required. Subsequently, both are linked by the linear damage accumulation hypothesis. The chain specific S-N curve was created on the basis of previous trials of WBK Seilprüfstelle. The conducted dynamic fatigue trials respect a wide range of standardized chain sizes and rely on two different load assumptions. Thus a weighted consideration of the real load conditions is possible. By using the two parametric Markov counting algorithm, the collective normal stress will be calculated. Essential for this is an accurate load-time-curve that comprises of the real surrounding conditions precisely. For an accurate determination of the replacement state, the generated collective must represent the complete history of the chain link. This important requirement can only be achieved by a constantly working measurement system, which is directly connected to the focused link over the entire service life. A market research concerning established and free accessible measurement systems for chains revealed no satisfactory solution also complying with the elaborate chain specific requests. For this purpose, the development of a customized measurement system was focus of the public funded research project i-MaSS (integrated machine sensor system). For the integration of the miniaturized and energy-efficient prototypes in the chain strand, customized adapters are required. With regard to the minimal installation space available a conceptual division respective to the layout took place here. For chains with a wire gauge ≥ 30 mm (preferable mining chains) the developed adapter element looks like a <b>stud</b> chain <b>link</b> with a borehole in the middle. Wire gauges < 30 mm (e. g. hoisting chains) can not house the measurement systems directly as a consequence of the filigree geometry. In this regard an alternative solution was designed which can be mounted in the flow of force at the end of the chain strand. The testing of each adapter variant was performed on different test rigs for mining and hoisting chains separately. For the considered use case mining chain static test series were carried on a horizontally operating tension testing machine; dynamic analyses on a close to reality but unloaded armoured face conveyor test bench. The results obtained depict a linear and reproducible transmission behaviour of the complete measurement chain. The for chain hoists designed concept was trialled on a seven meter high test tower under realistic conditions. Hereby, the performed static and dynamic test series reveal a satisfying transmission behaviour, which is furthermore repeatable and analytically traceable. All test bench trials achieved acceptable results for both developed measurement concepts. Therefore, they can be used as a practicable tool for determining the load-time-curve of adequate quality. In conjunction with the deduced and for chains adapted calculation of service strength, it is now possible to estimate the remaining life time of standardized round link chains of different size more precisely...|$|R
