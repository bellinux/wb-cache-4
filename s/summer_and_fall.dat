The loss of glaciers will also reduce the aesthetic visual appeal that glaciers provide to visitors.|$|E

5|$|The 1910 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season was the period during the <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> of 1910 in which tropical cyclones {{formed in the}} North Atlantic Ocean. The season was fairly inactive, with only five storms; however, three grew into hurricanes and one became a major hurricane. The season {{got off to a}} late start with the formation of a tropical storm in the Caribbean Sea on August 23. September saw two storms, and the final tropical cyclone—Hurricane Five—existed during October. All but one of the storms made landfall, and the only cyclone which remained at sea had some effects on the island of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|The 1911 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season was relatively inactive, with only six known tropical cyclones forming in the Atlantic during the <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> <b>fall.</b> There were three suspected tropical depressions, {{including one that}} began the season in February and one that ended the season when it dissipated in December. Three storms intensified into hurricanes, two of which attained Category 2 status on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale.
