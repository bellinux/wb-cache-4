The Incredible Hulk and Dragon Challenge, both at Universal's Islands of Adventure, were closed in 2015 and 2017 respectively.

5|$|Claudius was a heretic in {{the view}} of Dungal and Jonas of Orléans, who later wrote to refute some of his teachings {{at the request of the}} emperor. The last {{recorded}} act of Claudius is in a charter of the monastery of St Peter at Novalesa in May 827. He was dead by the time Dungal finished his Responsa contra peruersas Claudii Taurinensis episcopi sententias late in 827, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> presumed that he died that year.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} is preventable. This includes {{by individual}} efforts such as removing lead-containing {{items from the}} home, workplace efforts such as improved ventilation and monitoring, and nationwide policies such as laws that ban lead in products such as paint and gasoline, reduce allowable levels in water or soil, and provide for cleanup of contaminated soil. The major treatments are removal {{of the source of}} lead and the use of medications that bind lead <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> eliminated from the body, known as chelation therapy. Chelation therapy in children is recommended when blood levels are greater than 40–45µg/dl. Medications used include dimercaprol, edetate calcium disodium, and succimer.|$|E

5|$|On April 8, 2014, Microsoft {{released}} the Windows 8.1 Update, which included all past updates plus new features. It was unveiled by Microsoft vice president Joe Belfiore at Mobile World Congress on February 23, 2014, and detailed in full at Microsoft's Build conference on April 2. Belfiore {{noted that the}} update would lower the minimum system requirements for Windows, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> installed on devices with as little as 1GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. Unlike Windows 8.1 itself, this cumulative update is distributed through Windows Update, and must be installed {{in order to receive}} any further patches for Windows 8.1.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} {{to have a sense}} of unpredictability <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> played without confining the player to rules. To achieve this, the company added the breaching system, which adds more varieties of combat and gives players more choices when dealing with the artificial intelligence. The breaching system, which originated as a mini-game, {{was designed to}} be simple so it would not interrupt the flow of gameplay. Instead of being purely a first-person shooter, the game features action-adventure elements that allow players to choose their progression and tasks them with solving environmental puzzles.|$|E
5|$|There {{were rumors}} that Joseph McClure, the Chief Justice who had sworn him into office, {{intended}} to have Baxter either arrested or killed, ostensibly because Baxter had replaced W. W. Wilshire, a Minstrel, with Robert C. Newton, an ex-Confederate, {{as head of}} the state militia. U.S. Attorney General Williams contacted Baxter and suggested that he ask for federal troops for protection again. A letter from President Grant followed, offering protection. The Grant administration usually followed Powell Clayton's lead where Arkansas matters were concerned, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> concluded that the former governor was still supporting Baxter. The Republican Party of Arkansas, still controlled by the Minstrel faction, issued a statement denouncing Brooks' attempt to contest the election, which was published in the Little Rock Republican on October 8, 1873 and signed by all the major members of the party, including Clayton. However, the Minstrels would soon turn on Baxter for not following the party line.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} of Piers Gaveston's early years; even his year of birth is unknown. He and Prince Edward of Caernarfon (born 25 April 1284) {{were said to be}} contemporaries (coetanei), <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> assumed that he was born in or around 1284. Though one chronicle claims he {{accompanied}} his father to England in 1297, the first reliable reference to him is from Gascony later that year, when he served in the company of Edward I. In 1300 he sailed to England with his father and his older brother, Arnaud-Guillaume de Marsan. It was at this time that he {{became a member of the}} household of the young Prince Edward – the future Edward II. The King was apparently impressed by Gaveston's conduct and martial skills, and wanted him to serve as a model for his son. In 1304, the King awarded Gaveston the wardship of Roger Mortimer of Wigmore, after the death of Roger's father, on the request of Edward, Prince of Wales. This put Gaveston in charge of Mortimer's possessions during the latter's minority, and served as proof of the King's confidence in his son's companion.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, many {{specimens}} of a previously unidentified dinosaur were found associated {{together in the}} same bed and locality: a pebbly stratum near a route to Cerro Condor. The specimens were first described by Jose Bonaparte in 1979. For the fossil he erected the genus Patagosaurus, as well as its type species P. fariasi. The generic name of Patagosaurus comes from the location of its find in Patagonia, {{and the fact that it}} is a reptile. The specific name honours Ricardo Farias, on whose land the initial discovery was made. The genus was originally known from an almost complete postcranial skeleton lacking a skull as the holotype, and many referred specimens however in 2003 it was found that a dentary was referable to the species, so more specimens are probably this taxon. Its skeleton was found near those of Piatnitzkysaurus and Volkheimeria in the Callovian to Oxfordian aged Patagonian deposits of the Cañadón Asfalto Formation. Patagosaurus is almost completely known, with many articulated specimens found covering almost all of the skeleton, including parts of the skull. Over twelve specimens have been referred to the species, although some of the material is probably from a unique taxon. Bonaparte (1986) assigned three specimens other than the holotype PVL 4170, PVL 4076, MACN CH 934, and MACN CH 933 to the genus. While the holotype includes a post cranial skeleton, the others are known from cranial material and a nearly complete juvenile skeleton and skull. MACN CH 933 is directly comparable with the type material of Patagosaurus, which confirms its association with the genus. A specimen first referred to Patagosaurus in 2003, MPEF-PV 1670 (which includes just a lower jaw), is also very similar to MACN CH 934, and differences can be associated with age, so therefore, MPEF-PV 1670 presumably represents adult cranial material. However, the teeth of MACN CH 934 are very different from those of both lower jaws (MACN CH 933 and MPEF-PV 1670), <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> identified as another sauropod from the same deposit as Patagosaurus. Thus, the taxon only certainly includes PVL 4170, MACN CH 933, and MPEF-PV 1670.|$|E
