5|$|After the {{conflict}} ended, Themistocles continued his pre-eminence among Athenian politicians. However, he aroused the hostility of Sparta by ordering the re-fortification of Athens, and his perceived arrogance began to alienate {{him from the}} Athenians. In 472 or 471BC, he was ostracised, and went into exile in Argos. The Spartans now saw an opportunity to destroy Themistocles, and implicated him in the alleged treasonous plot of 478 BC of their own general Pausanias. Themistocles thus fled from Greece. Alexander I of Macedon (reigned 498-454 BC) temporarily gave him sanctuary at Pydna before he traveled to Asia Minor, where he entered the <b>service</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Persian king Artaxerxes I (reigned 465-424 BC). He was made governor of Magnesia, and lived there {{for the rest of}} his life.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{a bronze}} {{memorial}} plaque, inscribed {{with the name}} of the deceased alongside Britannia and a lion, and a scroll, sent to the next of kin of those had died in the <b>service</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British Empire. Honour rolls in Canada were very popular, particularly immediately {{after the end of the}} war, although the decision on which names to include on them proved contentious: should accidental deaths, for example, be included? Where it was impractical to inscribe names in churches, usually due to the number of casualties and available space, books of names were often recorded instead.|$|E

Despite this hospitality, the Tayy now went north and sought to enter the <b>service</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine Empire. Emperor Basil II accepted their request, and a few months later, in autumn 983, the Tayy fought alongside the Byzantines under the doux of Antioch, Bardas Phokas, when he went to relieve Aleppo from an attack by Bakjur, who had rebelled against Sa'd al-Dawla.|$|E
