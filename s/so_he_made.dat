5|$|By {{the terms}} of his parole, Mallory was not {{permitted}} to hold public office, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> a living by reopening his old law practice. Nominally excluded from politics, he managed to make his views known by writing letters and editorials for Florida newspapers. At first he urged acceptance of the reconstituted Union and acquiescence in the policies of Reconstruction, but he soon came out in opposition, particularly against black suffrage.|$|E
5|$|After the Olympics, Kerry took an {{extended}} break from competitive swimming. He {{was asked to}} return for the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> a comeback, but only did two weeks of solid training and missed selection, failing to win either of the backstroke events. In 1983, he began preparing for the Olympics, but did not start serious work until October. Kerry was confident {{in his ability to}} perform at international standards with sporadic preparation after long sabbaticals. He attributed this to his technique and ability to keep his 190cm, 80kg body in shape while not training.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the trial}} judge had criticized the police investigation, Essex Police held an {{internal}} inquiry, conducted by Detective Chief Superintendent Dickinson. Bamber alleged this report confirmed that evidence had been withheld by the police, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> a formal complaint, which was investigated in 1991 by the City of London Police. This process uncovered more documentation, which Bamber used to petition the Home Secretary in September 1993 for a referral back to the Court of Appeal, refused in July 1994.|$|E

5|$|Cornwallis was {{sensitive}} {{to the fact that}} Tipu was likely to deny the invading army access to local forage and provisions, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> arrangements for a large supply of provisions and arranged for the use of elephants to assist in the movement of the army's siege equipment. He also encouraged the Marathas and the Nizam to step up their advances to join his army as quickly as possible so that he could take advantage of their cavalry.|$|E
5|$|In July 2004, it was {{announced}} Paramount Pictures would produce Watchmen, and they hired Darren Aronofsky to direct Hayter's script. Gordon and Levin remained attached, collaborating with Aronofsky's producing partner, Eric Watson. Eventually, Aronofsky left to focus on The Fountain, and Paramount replaced him with Paul Greengrass, with a target release date of summer 2006. At this time, Paddy Considine, was involved in negotiations for Rorschach. Jude Law (a fan of the comic) and Tom Cruise both lobbied for Ozymandias. Greengrass wanted Joaquin Phoenix for Dan Dreiberg and Hilary Swank as Laurie. To publicize the film, Paramount launched a now-defunct Watchmen teaser website that had a message board as well as computer wallpaper available to download. Graphic artist Tristan Schane drew designs of Dr. Manhattan for the film, which depicted him with visible intestines. Gilliam read Greengrass's revision of Hayter's script and liked it, but told the director {{he did not think}} the studio would greenlight such a dark film. In March 2005, with rumors that high-profile projects, including Watchmen, were in danger of being cut, Paramount's CEO Donald De Line began urging a reduction in Watchmens budget so the film could get the greenlight. When Brad Grey took over as Paramount’s CEO, Levin feared potential budget cuts, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> plans to move the project outside the UK in an effort to save money. Before he could, Paramount placed Watchmen in turnaround, again.|$|E
5|$|While visiting Ghana in 1960, Du Bois {{spoke with}} its {{president}} about {{the creation of}} a new encyclopedia of the African diaspora, the Encyclopedia Africana. In early 1961, Ghana notified Du Bois that they had appropriated funds to support the encyclopedia project, and they invited Du Bois to come to Ghana and manage the project there. In October 1961, at the age of 93, Du Bois and his wife traveled to Ghana to take up residence and commence work on the encyclopedia. In early 1963, the United States refused to renew his passport, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> the symbolic gesture of becoming a citizen of Ghana. While it is sometimes stated that he renounced his U.S. citizenship at that time, and he did state his intention to do so, Du Bois never actually did. His health declined during the two years he was in Ghana, and he died on August 27, 1963, in the capital of Accra at the age of 95. Du Bois was buried in Accra near his home, which is now the Du Bois Memorial Centre. A day after his death, at the March on Washington, speaker Roy Wilkins asked the hundreds of thousands of marchers to honor Du Bois with a moment of silence. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, embodying many of the reforms Du Bois had campaigned for his entire life, was enacted almost a year after his death.|$|E
50|$|Jan van Oort {{studied the}} violin on the conservatorium where he {{graduated}} in 1940, and became violinist with the Amsterdam Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. During the Dutch famine of 1944, the orchestra was decommissioned, allowing Van Oort more time for drawing. While living {{at the time in}} <b>Soest,</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> twelve designs of gnomes, and let his wife Kitty Sijmons pick the best one. This one he elaborated to a full-blown children's book character and named him Paulus.|$|R

However, the race shifted again on February 7, when Santorum swept all three Midwestern states voting that day.

25|$|Captain Whitby married Catherine Dorothea Inglefield, the commissioner's {{youngest}} daughter, {{around the}} end of 1805. Whitby wanted to stay in Halifax <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> an exchange into the 50-gun fourth rate HMS Leander. Captain John Talbot of Leander took command of Centaur on 5 December and sailed her home. Because of the damage she had suffered, Centaur missed joining Nelson and therefore being at the Battle of Trafalgar.|$|E

25|$|Saichō {{spent the}} next several months copying various Buddhist works with the {{intention}} of bringing them back to Japan with him. While some works existed in Japan already, Saichō felt that they suffered from copyist errors or other defects, and <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> fresh copies. Once the task was completed, Saichō and his party returned to Ningbo, but the ship was harbored in Fuzhou at the time, and would not return for six weeks.|$|E
25|$|The {{experimental}} apparatus {{consisted of}} a torsion balance {{with a pair of}} 2-inch 1.61-pound lead spheres suspended from the arm of a torsion balance and two much larger stationary lead balls (350 pounds). Cavendish intended to measure the force of gravitational attraction between the two. He noticed that Michell's apparatus would be sensitive to temperature differences and induced air currents <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> modifications by isolating the apparatus in a separate room with external controls and telescopes for making observations.|$|E
25|$|Reiffel {{made his}} first class umpiring debut in the 2004/2005 season after first umpiring in Melbourne grade cricket in 2002.

In 2008, he {{became a member of}} the International Cricket Council International Panel of Umpires and Referees, the first former Australian Test cricketer to do <b>so.</b> <b>He</b> <b>made</b> his {{international}} on-field umpiring debut in a One Day International match between Australia and New Zealand on 6 February 2009.

25|$|Burns said in {{his speech}} {{that he had no}} idea that he would be a {{candidate}} for the electorate, and therefore did not have enough time to prepare a speech, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> it up along the way. He stated that if he became a Member of Parliament for Bruce, he would endeavour to act in a straightforward manner. In response to questions, Burns stated that he was an advocate for free trade. He also stated that he was against separationism, the act of dividing the North and South Islands, and that although he supported the use of income tax, he was against a stamp act or newspaper postage.|$|E
25|$|In Sögubrot af nokkrum fornkonungum, Sigurd is the {{paternal}} {{nephew of}} the Danish king Harald Wartooth, and presumably (the part of Sögubrot where {{this would have}} been narrated expressly has not been preserved) the son of Randver, who in his turn is the son of Harald's mother Auðr the Deep-Minded and her husband king Raðbarðr of Gardariki. Harald Wartooth was beginning to feel old, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> Sigurd the king of Sweden and Västergötland. Sigurd beat his uncle at the colossal Battle of Bråvalla, and became the ruler of Denmark as well. He made a shieldmaiden the ruler of Denmark (cf. Chronicon Lethrense, below).|$|E
25|$|At {{the height}} of his success, Worth {{reformed}} the highly popular trend, the crinoline. It had grown increasingly large in size, making it difficult for women to manage even the most basic activities, such as walking through doors, sitting, caring for their children, or holding hands. Worth wanted to design a more practical silhouette for women, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> the crinoline more narrow and gravitated the largest part to the back, freeing up a woman’s front and sides. Worth’s new crinoline was a major success. Eventually, Worth abandoned the crinoline altogether, creating a straight gown shape without a defined waist that became known as the princess line.|$|E

25|$|In early 1984, Ben Baker was {{planning}} on starting a BBS for the newly forming computer club at the McDonnell Douglas automotive division in St. Louis. Baker {{was part of the}} CP/M special interest group within the club. He intended to use the seminal, CP/M-hosted, CBBS system, and went looking for a machine to run it on. The club's president told Baker that DEC would be giving them a Rainbow 100 computer on indefinite loan, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> plans to move the CBBS onto this machine. The Rainbow contained two processors, an Intel 8088 and a Zilog Z80, allowing it to run both MS-DOS and CP/M, with the BBS running on the latter. When the machine arrived, they learned that the Z80 side had no access to the I/O ports, so CBBS could not communicate with a modem. While searching for software that would run on the MS-DOS side of the system, Baker learned of Fido through Madil.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, Mills {{decided to}} speak about his inner experiences, but only if asked to do <b>so.</b> <b>He</b> <b>made</b> this {{agreement}} after he received the same message from two different sources: “You must learn to speak the Word again.” Then, people began seeking him out - sometimes arriving unexpectedly on his doorstep - asking about their deepest questions and concerns. Mills found himself speaking spontaneously to these seekers. When their number became too large to speak with individually, Mills began giving lectures. He defined his spontaneous speaking, which he called Unfoldment, as “an impromptu performance under the impelling of divine ideas. It is a projection from another dimension or plane of consciousness, causing those prepared to hear to awaken to the higher or greater possibilities of living {{beyond the limits of}} three dimensions and translating {{what seems to be the}} ordinary into another level of consideration.” He also often spoke in poetry, offering some 3,000 extemporaneous poems during his lifetime.|$|E
25|$|Booker T began teaming with Chris Benoit, eying the United States Championship again. Meanwhile, after {{a series}} of matches with MNM, Sharmell {{introduced}} some villainous tactics, to which Booker feigned ignorance. Benoit was allowed to pick his next challenger to see who would face him at No Mercy, so Booker, Christian, and Orlando Jordan tried to impress Benoit by winning matches. He could not choose, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> it a fatal four-way for No Mercy, where Benoit successfully defended his title. On the October 21 episode of SmackDown, Booker T defeated Benoit for the United States Championship, due to unseen help from Sharmell. Theodore Long later showed footage of Sharmell interfering in Booker's matches. Booker went to apologize to Benoit and give him a rematch, but then attacked Benoit, busting him open with the U.S. title belt. Turning heel once again {{for the first time since}} 2004, Booker cemented his heel turn boasting that he had been fully aware of what Sharmell had been doing and had been playing dumb to fool everyone.|$|E
