Simpson questioned why Hill met, dined, and spoke by phone with Thomas on various occasions after they no longer worked together.|$|E
500|$|At 11:30am on 18October1968, {{the flat}} was raided by Sgt. Norman Pilcher, of Scotland Yard's Drugs Squad. In 1974, Lennon remembered that Ono {{answered}} {{the front door}} as a female voice had <b>said</b> (<b>over</b> <b>the</b> intercom), {{that there was a}} message from the Apple office. Ono opened the door and saw the female with five men, who were all dressed in plain-clothes. She panicked and closed the door, thinking they were Beatles' fans. Meanwhile, at the back window, another person was banging on the window and holding up a search warrant for Lennon to read. As Lennon was also panicking—not knowing at that point that they were all police officers—the raid consisted of seven police officers and two police dogs—he played for time and refused to open the window. Because of this, Pilcher later accused Lennon of obstruction of justice, which was a crime. Inside the flat, the police searched every room thoroughly, even though Lennon was supposed to accompany them whilst they did so, according to the law. Pilcher then summoned Lennon and pointed to a binocular case on a mantelpiece, asking him, [...] "Is this yours?" [...] Lennon replied in the affirmative, and was then shown 219grams of hashish, which was in the case.|$|E

2500|$|Opposition to Barberi {{was also}} present here where on his {{journeys}} to the Mass centre local youths would throw rocks at him, though two youths {{took to the}} decision to become Catholics when they were greatly edified to see Barberi kiss each rock that hit him {{and place it in}} his pocket. During many of these frequent attacks Barberi barely escaped death. Local Protestant ministers often held anti-Catholic lectures and sermons to ward the people away from Barberi and the Catholics. Wilson records how one of these ministers followed Barberi along a street shouting out various arguments against transubstantiation, Barberi was silent, but as the man was about to turn off, Barberi retorted: [...] "Jesus Christ <b>said</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> consecrated elements, [...] "This is my body" [...] you say [...] "No. It is not his body!"

2500|$|Overnight, roving {{bands of}} youth set 10 fires {{and engaged in}} {{sporadic}} looting. Civilian patrols were unable to control the looting, much of which was done by young adults and teenagers (some as young as 10 years of age). Against Mayor Stokes' direct orders, several white police officers and National Guardsmen violated the cordon during the night and responded to reports of looting. This created such a tense situation at a furniture store at E. 123rd Street and St. Clair Avenue that Law Director Buddy James had to race to the scene and intervene. White Cleveland Police were deeply embittered by Stokes' decision {{to keep them out}} of the affected area. When a plea for an ambulance for a heart attack victim came in, an anonymous policeman <b>said</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> police radio, [...] "White or nigger? Send the Mayor's Committee." [...] When a child in the cordoned-off area fell from a second-floor balcony, an anonymous policeman radioed, [...] "Tell the Mayor's Committee to handle it." [...] When a police dispatcher asked for police to respond to a fire, an anonymous policeman radioed, [...] "Tell the Mayor to go piss on it." [...] Repeatedly, when asked to do their duty, anonymous policemen would radio back [...] "Fuck that nigger Mayor!" [...] When police at the Fifth District Headquarters (which encompassed the affected area) were told they could not carry rifles while patrolling the perimeter, those police present [...] "responded in a flurry of curses and epithets" [...] directed at Stokes. The anger at Stokes lasted throughout the evening, creating great tension at the Fifth District.|$|E

2500|$|He {{passed out}} briefly, {{and his second}} pilot, Flight Sergeant L.A. Hyder, who was also seriously wounded, managed {{to regain control of}} the {{plunging}} plane at 800 feet and drop the bombs, before receiving first aid from the other crew. Middleton regained consciousness in time to help recover control of his stricken bomber. [...] Middleton was in great pain, was barely able to see, was losing blood from wounds all over his body, and could breathe only with difficulty. [...] He must have known that his own chances of survival were slim, but he nonetheless determined to fly his crippled aircraft home, and return his crew to safety. [...] During the return flight he frequently <b>said</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> intercom [...] "I'll make the English Coast. I'll get you home". After four hours of agony and having been further damaged by flak over France, Middleton reached the coast of England with five minutes of fuel reserves. [...] At this point he turned the aircraft parallel to the coast and ordered his crew to bail out. Five of his crew did so and landed safely, but his front gunner and flight engineer remained with him to try to talk him into a forced landing on the coast, something he must have known would have risked extensive civilian casualties. He steered the aircraft out over the sea, off Dymchurch, and ordered the last two crew to bail out. They then too bailed out, but did not survive the night in the English Channel. Middleton stayed with the aircraft, which crashed into the Channel. [...] His body was washed ashore on 1 February 1943.|$|E
2500|$|The French {{government}} became {{informed about}} the events. Balladur <b>said</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> telephone to Prime Minister of Algeria Mokdad Sifi that the French government would hold the Algerian government responsible for the outcome {{if it did not}} allow the French government to become involved in the crisis. Several French publications stated that the Algerian government wanted to allow the plane to depart if France resumed arms shipments to Algeria. Before midnight, Balladur told President of Algeria Liamine Zéroual that France was ready to receive the Air France flight. As a result of Balladur's demands, 39 hours after the start of the hijacking, Zeroual allowed the aircraft to leave Algiers. Claude Burgniard, a flight attendant, recalled that the occupants on board were relieved that the aircraft was departing and they believed the crisis was over. Since the auxiliary power unit, which uses four tonnes of fuel per day, ran throughout the crisis, the aircraft did not have sufficient fuel to reach Paris. Therefore, the aircraft was scheduled to arrive at Marseille Provence Airport in Marseille and refuel there. Captain Delhemme confronted Yahia and asked him if the aircraft would be blown up between Algiers and Marseille. Yahia insisted it would not and that the plane would go to Marseille, be refuelled then fly to Paris for the press conference. Delhemme believed him and prepared for takeoff. In an interview, Delhemme said {{that he did not know}} if the hijackers would have given him the same answer if he was in the stage between Marseille and Paris. The hijackers would probably have said the same so that the crew wouldn't take action against them. Burgniard recalled that the hijackers, in the cockpit, seemed excited and [...] "like kids".|$|E
