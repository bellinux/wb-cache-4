60|$|Every {{great artist}} {{has been such}} by synthesis. Our {{strength}} is transitional, alternating; or, shall I say, a thread of two strands. The seashore, sea seen from <b>shore,</b> <b>shore</b> seen from sea; the taste of two metals in contact; and our enlarged powers at the approach and at the departure of a friend; the experience of poetic creativeness, which is not found in staying at home, nor yet in traveling, but in transitions {{from one to the}} other, which must therefore be adroitly managed to present as much transitional surface as possible; this command of two elements must explain the power and charm of Plato. Art expresses the one, or the same by the different. Thought seeks to know unity in unity; poetry to show it by variety; that is, always by an object or symbol. Plato keeps the two vases, one of aether and one of pigment, at his side, and invariably uses both. Things added to things, as statistics, civil history, are inventories. Things used as language are inexhaustibly attractive. Plato turns incessantly the obverse and the reverse of the medal of Jove.|$|E

North of Merrillville the road enters Gary and passes through a mix of residential and commercial properties, staying as a four-lane undivided highway with a center turn lane. The road crosses a signal railroad track and has a traffic light at Ridge Road (old US 6). North of 33rd Avenue the road becomes a four-lane undivided highway without a center turn lane, as the road passes through a mostly wooded area. The route has an interchange with Borman Expressway (Interstate 80 (I-80) and I-94). The highway heads north towards downtown Gary passing three single track railroad crossings. In downtown Gary the route has an intersection with the one-way streets of Fifth Avenue, eastbound US 12/US 20 and Fourth Avenue, westbound US 12/US 20. North of Fourth Avenue the road passes under the <b>Shore</b> <b>Shore</b> line, a Commuter rail line.

40|$|This {{study is}} carried out to analyze the delays in {{physical}} distribution in Sony Supply Chain Solution Malaysia (SSCSM). The objectives of this research are to identify the factors that cause the product delivery delay to the customers, to analyze the causes that may contribute to product delivery delay and to suggest the solution to overcome the problems occurred in product delivery delay in SSCSM. The structured interview {{was done with the}} respective workers and was supported from documents review in order to support the analysis. The interviewees selection are very keen to carry out as the researcher only choose the experience workers who are directly involve in this product distribution. The structured interview can be analyzed using tools: Cause and Effect Diagram and Pareto chart. The finding revealed that the tools can determine the delays in terms of factors and causes through systematical analysis with more accurately. The finding also reveals that the factor that contributes to the delays in physical distribution is due to the inefficient of transportation system and the cause is due to vessel delay. In order to avoid this problem occurred in the future, the researchers recommended SSCSM to have integration of information technology and logistics management with shipping liners, to suggest port terminal to implement the usage of Electronic Port Clearance to increase their port productivity and efficiency, implementation of a system for maritime exchange of information from ship to <b>shore,</b> <b>shore</b> to ship and between all stakeholders, using service such as Long Range Identification and Tracking (LRIT) and Automatic Identification System (AIS) will facilitate safer and more expedient navigation and logistic operations, whereby improving maritime transport integration with other transport modes, measuring port performance based on Port Performance Indicators (PPI) and targeting towards training program development...|$|E
