500|$|Along with The Dark Knight Returns, Tim Burton has {{mentioned}} that The Killing Joke influenced his film adaptation of Batman: [...] "I {{was never a}} giant comic book fan, but I've always loved the image of Batman and the Joker. The reason I've never been a comic book fan — and I think it <b>started</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was a child — is because I could never tell which box I was supposed to read. I don't {{know if it was}} dyslexia or whatever, but that's why I loved The Killing Joke, because for the first time I could tell which one to read. It's my favorite. It's the first comic I've ever loved. And the success of those graphic novels made our ideas more acceptable." ...|$|E
500|$|Maia Ahmad, at {{the time}} wife of the {{musician}} Ahmad Dhani, had been a background singer for her husband's band Dewa 19 since 1993. She had been musically inclined since childhood and had formed a band while a teenager. She intended to be like her husband and enter the music industry as a headline performer. In a later interview, she explained her motivations: [...] "I wasn't following {{on the success of}} Krisdayanti dan Anang, a husband and wife who had made an album together. I just <b>started</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> did. Dhani only gave me the time then, as our children were getting older and I could focus on my music." [...] With Dhani's guidance, in 1999 Maia decided to form a duo consisting of a singer and a musician, with the name Ratu. The concept was based on that of international bands like Roxette and Savage Garden. Maia set herself as a keyboardist, then began to look for a vocalist.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006 he {{reflected}} on his career saying [...] "Those {{who have been}} doing for this for 40 years {{would like to think}} that it's a kind of Darwinian survival of the talented. But I think that's half the picture. It has as much as to do with the survival of temperament. There are few people still working now that <b>started</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> did. Not many people have the temperament to deal with that." ...|$|E
60|$|He gave such a <b>start</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{put my hand}} {{upon his}} shoulder, that he made me start too.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's so," [...] Naomi remarked <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had {{repeated}} the words. [...] "I couldn't help <b>starting</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> heard what Silas had said; and I thought you noticed me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I will; but {{mind you}} are a very good girl, and don't be afraid of me. Don't <b>start</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> chance to speak rather sharply; it's so provoking." ...|$|R
2500|$|Williams {{would later}} comment {{that she was}} one of five {{minority}} contestants that year, noting that ballet dancer Deneen Graham [...] "had already had a cross burned on her front yard because she was the first black Miss North Carolina [...]" [...] She also pointed out that [...] "Suzette Charles was the first runner-up, and she was biracial. But when the press <b>started,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> would go out on the - on the tour and do my appearances, and people would come up and say they never thought they'd see the day that it would happen; when people would want to shake my hand, and you'd see tears in their eyes, and they'd say, I never thought I'd see it in my lifetime - that's when, you know, it was definitely a very special honor." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{few years}} later, Vanessa Williams (Miss New York 1983) won {{the title of}} Miss America 1984 on September 17, 1983, making her the first African American woman to wear the crown. Williams later commented that {{she was one of}} five {{minority}} contestants that year, noting that ballet dancer Deneen Graham [...] "had already had a cross burned on her front yard because she was the first black Miss North Carolina [...]" [...] She also pointed out that [...] "Suzette Charles was the first runner-up, and she was biracial.

[...] Williams' reign as Miss America was not without its challenges and controversies, however. For the first time in pageant history, a reigning Miss America was the target of death threats and hate mail. Williams was forced to resign seven weeks prior to the end of her time as Miss America, however, after the unauthorized publication of nude photos in Penthouse. First runner-up, Miss New Jersey 1983, Suzette Charles replaced her for the final weeks of Williams' reign., The New York Times, September 19, 1983. Accessed December 4, 2007. [...] "Her home is in Mays Landing, 15 miles west of Atlantic City, the site of the contest." ...|$|E
60|$|Leslie <b>started</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{entered the}} room, but seeing only me, {{he leaned forward}} again, resting his arms on his knees, looking in the fire.|$|E
6000|$|... "Queer country this, isn't it?" [...] {{he remarked}} pleasantly. [...] "Do you know, I never heard you come in. It gave me quite a <b>start</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> found that I had a fellow-passenger." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] I said, [...] "I don't care if I do. All I bargain is {{that you}} {{keep your mouth shut}} and don't let on who I am, so that I may have a fair <b>start</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> get there." ...|$|R
6000|$|Dick {{put down}} the drawing-board {{and looked at him}} steadily. [...] "It's very bad taste. In fact, I find myself in a very awkward situation. Your father gave me a fresh <b>start</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> needed it badly, and agreed when your sister put you in my charge." ...|$|R
60|$|But she was gone. I, too, {{left him}} without ceremony, {{to speak to}} Mrs. Manners, who was {{standing}} apart, looking shoreward. She <b>started</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> spoke, and I saw that tears were in her eyes.|$|E
60|$|I {{dare say}} I did wrong--indeed, judging by later events, I know I did wrong. But I could not view the affair seriously {{enough to hold}} out against Mr. Engelman {{in the matter of}} the nosegay. He <b>started</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{mentioned}} the widow's name.|$|E
60|$|Joc. He <b>started</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{told him}} your intent, Replying, {{what he knew}} of that affair Would give no {{satisfaction}} to the king; Then, falling on his knees, begged, as for life, To be dismissed from court: He trembled too, As if convulsive death had seized upon him, And stammered in his abrupt prayer so wildly, That had he been the murderer of Laius, Guilt and distraction could not have shook him more.|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe, if I {{had just}} then started from her, {{she would have}} despised me. Thanks to the phlegm of my nature, <b>I</b> rarely <b>start.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> am well-off, bien, comfortable, I am not soon stirred. Bien I was--très bien--consequently immutable. No muscle moved. I hardly looked to the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope so too, Blagrove. I {{feel that}} I deserve what I have got, {{and it will}} be a lesson that I shall not forget. You have taken me down a great many pegs in my own estimation, and I shall try and make a fresh <b>start</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> am about again." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I think <b>I</b> {{was joking}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> said that," [...] Butler said. [...] "I <b>started</b> dreaming <b>when</b> <b>I</b> got to college. It shows you {{anything}} can happen." ...|$|R
60|$|Even Mr. Jaggers <b>started</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{said those}} words. It was the {{slightest}} start that could escape a man, the most carefully repressed {{and the sooner}} checked, but he did start, though he made it {{a part of the}} action of taking out his pocket-handkerchief. How Wemmick received the announcement I am unable to say; for I was afraid to look at him just then, lest Mr. Jaggers's sharpness should detect that there had been some communication unknown to him between us.|$|E
60|$|When a man writes {{any work}} of genius, or invents some {{creative}} action, {{is it not}} because some knowledge or power has come into his mind from beyond his mind? It is called up by an image, as I think; all my birds' adventures <b>started</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> hung a little saucer at {{one side of the}} cage, and at the other a bundle of hair and grass; but our images must be given to us, we cannot choose them deliberately.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{a bureau}} cover I <b>started</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was at Pratt's," [...] she said, as she {{straightened}} {{it over her}} knees. [...] "It's a copy of an expensive one. I never had the patience to finish it, {{but one of the}} sales-ladies there, who was an expert, told me it was pretty good: She taught me the stitch, and I had a notion at that time I might make a little money for dresses and the theatre. I was always clever with my hands." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Do {{you think}} you could do {{something}} useful for me? You see yourself that everyone who lives in the monastery is useful. Well, if I am called away, as I often am, while I am reading, don't you go too; stay here on the spot I mark with my finger, so that I'll know exactly where to <b>start</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> come back.

6000|$|... "Yesterday morning I {{was seated}} in my office at the bank when a card {{was brought in to}} me by one of the clerks. I <b>started</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> saw the name, for it was that of none other than--well, perhaps even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name which is a {{household}} word all over the earth--one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England. I was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.|$|E
60|$|Looking back, I always {{consider}} that {{my career as}} a dog proper really <b>started</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was bought for the sum of half a crown by the Shy Man. That event {{marked the end of}} my puppyhood. The knowledge that I was worth actual cash to somebody filled me with a sense of new responsibilities. It sobered me. Besides, it was only after that half-crown changed hands that I went out into the great world; and, however interesting life may be in an East End public-house, it is only when you go out into the world that you really broaden your mind and begin to see things.|$|E
6000|$|She <b>started</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{came up with}} her, {{and turned}} her head away from me. Not looking {{me in the face}} being another of the proceedings, which, as head of the servants, I never allow, on principle, to pass without inquiry--I turned her round my way, and saw that she was crying. My {{bandanna}} handkerchief--one of six beauties given to me by my lady--was handy in my pocket. I took it out, and I said to Rosanna, [...] "Come and sit down, my dear, on the slope of the beach along with me. I'll dry your eyes for you first, and then I'll make so bold as to ask what you have been crying about." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{approached}} very quietly, {{and dragged}} the dogs away from him, one by one. His eyes followed me always.

But he made no motion; only his eyes had a wonderful light in them <b>when</b> <b>I</b> dragged his last enemy, the one he had killed himself, from under his very head and threw it after the others. Then I sat down quietly in the snow, and we were face to face at last.|$|R
5000|$|Dialogues {{written for}} and uttered by Kalyan's {{character}} in the film were linked {{to the politics of}} Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Comments such as [...] "Nenu time ki Raavadam Kaadu Tammudu, Nenu Vachake time avutondi" [...] ("I don't come on time; time <b>starts</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> come") and [...] "Samardhulu Intlo undipothe Asamardhulu Rajyamelutaru" [...] ("The unskilled will rule if the skilled stay at home") appeared to refer to the change in government and Kalyan's own entry into politics.|$|R
6000|$|... "They tell me," [...] she whispered, [...] "that from Boston you {{can take}} a train right across the Continent, {{thousands}} of miles. I am going to take the very first one that <b>starts</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> land, and I am going to hide somewhere in the furthest corner of the world I can get to. To live in such fear would drive me mad, and I am not a coward. Let us walk; he will not think so much of our being together then." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{places which}} I have {{described}} may seem strange and remote to my townsmen,--indeed, from Boston to Provincetown {{is twice as}} far as from England to France; yet step into the cars, and in six hours you may stand on those four planks, and see the Cape which Gosnold {{is said to have}} discovered, and which I have so poorly described. If you had <b>started</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first advised you, you might have seen our tracks in the sand, still fresh, and reaching {{all the way from the}} Nauset Lights to Race Point, some thirty miles,--for at every step we made an impression on the Cape, though we were not aware of it, and though our account may have made no impression on your minds. But what is our account? In it there is no roar, no beach-birds, no tow-cloth.|$|E
60|$|It was Dartmoor Prison! There it stretched, {{grim and}} hideous, within a furlong of me. Had I run {{on for a}} few more minutes in the dark, I should have butted my shako against the wall. I was so taken aback at the sight, that I could {{scarcely}} realize what had happened. Then it all became clear to me, and I struck my head with my hands in my despair. The wind had veered from north to south during the night, and I, keeping my face always towards it, had run ten miles out and ten miles in, winding up where I had <b>started.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> thought of my hurry, my falls, my mad rushing and jumping, all ending in this, it seemed so absurd, that my grief changed suddenly to amusement, and I fell among the brambles, and laughed, and laughed, until my sides were sore. Then I rolled myself up in my cloak and considered seriously what I should do.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, with pleasure," [...] said I. There {{being no}} music about, and no piano, I {{concluded}} naturally that my friends amused themselves with solo songs without accompaniment of an evening, {{and having a}} good tenor voice I was not unwilling to lead off with a song. Clearing my rusty throat with a ghrr-ghrr-hram which made them all jump, I launched forth with the [...] "Vicar of Bray"--a grand old song and a great favorite of mine. They all <b>started</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> commenced, exchanging glances, and casting astonished looks towards me; but it was getting so dusky in the room that I could not feel sure that my eyes were not deceiving me. Presently some that were near me began retiring to distant seats, and this distressed me so that it made me hoarse, and my singing became very bad indeed; but still I thought it best to go bravely on to the end. Suddenly the old gentleman, who had been staring wildly at me for some time, drew up his long yellow robe and wrapped it round his face and head. I glanced at Yoletta, sitting at some distance, and saw that she was holding her hands pressed to her ears.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then you'll pull through. Them as {{is anxious}} and willing always do. I didn't {{have much to}} <b>start</b> on <b>when</b> <b>I</b> settled in the city. Only six months' pay at sixteen dollars a month." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was mighty nigh {{being one}} of that crowd," [...] Jerry said when he told the story to Tom, as they sat over the camp-fire that night. [...] "I heard of their <b>start</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> got back to Salt Lake City, after being away for some time among the hills. I legged it arter them as fast as I could, but <b>I</b> found <b>when</b> <b>I</b> got to the last {{settlement}} that they had gone on ten days before, and as I {{did not know what}} line they had followed, and did not care to cross the pass alone, I gave it up.

60|$|I {{followed}} suit at Carlsruhe, by stealing a bicycle. I {{did not mean}} to steal the bicycle; I was merely trying to be useful. The train was on the point of <b>starting</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> noticed, as I thought, Harris's bicycle still in the goods van. No one was about to help me. I jumped into the van and hauled it out, only just in time. Wheeling it down the platform in triumph, I came across Harris's bicycle, standing against a wall behind some milk-cans. The bicycle I had secured was not Harris's, but some other man's.|$|R
