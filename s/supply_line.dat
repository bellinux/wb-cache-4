5|$|Hindman set to {{work and}} issued a series of harsh {{military}} edicts, instituting conscription, authorizing guerrilla warfare and requisitioning supplies {{for the defense of}} the State. Hindman also commenced a campaign of misinformation designed to mislead Federal authorities about the strength of the state's defenses. He also diverted Texas troops bound for Virginia for use in defense of Arkansas. This series of events, combined with harassing tactics, confused the Federal authorities, causing them to fear {{that they did not have}} an adequate <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> to conquer the state and soon diverted from a course towards the capital and instead moved to Helena to reestablish a solid <b>supply</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
5|$|After Resaca de la Palma, Mexican {{forces were}} cleared from the Texan {{side of the}} Rio Grande, but {{additional}} operations were required to force Mexico {{to agree to the}} border. The Mexican commander, General Mariano Arista, withdrew his forces to Linares, with Taylor in pursuit for sixty miles before returning to Fort Brown for reinforcements. He then marched against Monterrey. The heavily fortified city had a 10,000-man garrison under Arista's replacement, General Pedro de Ampudia, but its <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> running south to Saltillo was vulnerable. Lacking the heavy artillery needed for a siege, Taylor planned a double envelopment, with one division executing a turning movement to cut the <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> and attack from the west and south, and his other two divisions assaulting {{the north side of the}} city.|$|E
5|$|After {{the capture}} of Sevastopol, Hitler felt Manstein was the right man to command the forces at Leningrad, which had been under siege since September 1941. With {{elements}} of the 11th Army, Manstein {{was transferred to the}} Leningrad front, arriving on 27 August 1942. Manstein again lacked the proper forces to storm the city, so he planned Operation Nordlicht, a bold plan for a thrust to cut off Leningrad's <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> at Lake Ladoga.|$|E

Only {{a small number of}} residents {{have access to}} legal water <b>supply</b> <b>lines.</b> However, these connections are not acquired through a legitimate process and are done illegally. Moreover, 50 per cent of the population has gas <b>supply</b> <b>lines.</b> The remaining population depends on gas cylinders for cooking and other purposes.|$|R
50|$|Operation Stranglehold was {{a bombing}} mission {{conducted}} on May 22, 1969 during the Vietnam War. Operation Stranglehold was planned to bomb and damage NVA <b>supply</b> <b>lines</b> along Route 6 and 7 and ruin the NVA <b>supply</b> <b>lines</b> in the Plain of Jars. They planned a hundred bombing runs daily, mostly in mid-afternoon, {{where most of}} the equipment is moving about. However, this did not deter the NVA's will to fight and damage their <b>supply</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R

5|$|By 17 February, the Khmer Republic {{abandoned}} {{attempts to}} reopen the Mekong <b>supply</b> <b>line.</b> In future, all supplies for Phnom Penh {{would have to come}} in by air to Pochentong Airport. The United States quickly mobilised an airlift of food, fuel and ammunition into Phnom Penh, but as US support for the Khmer Republic was limited by the Case–Church Amendment, BirdAir, a company under contract to the US Government, controlled the airlift with a mixed fleet of C-130 and DC-8 planes, flying 20 times a day into Pochentong.|$|E
5|$|Forces of the South Korean Republic of Korea Army, {{supported}} by the United States Navy and United States Air Force, defended the eastern coast {{of the country as}} a part of the Pusan Perimeter. When several divisions of the North Korean People's Army crossed through mountainous terrain to push the UN forces back, a complicated battle ensued in the rugged terrain around P'ohang-dong, which contained the vital <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> to the main UN force at Taegu.|$|E
5|$|In December 1944 the United States Navy's {{high command}} became {{concerned}} that the IJN would attempt to cut the <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> to the planned beachhead at Lingayen Gulf. On 26 December a Japanese naval force operating from Cam Ranh Bay in Japanese-controlled French Indochina shelled the Allied beachhead at Mindoro, but inflicted no damage. One of the Japanese destroyers involved in this operation was sunk, {{and all of the}} remaining ships were damaged by Allied air and naval attacks before returning to Cam Ranh Bay.|$|E

5|$|In {{an effort}} to cut Grant's <b>supply</b> <b>line,</b> Confederates in Louisiana under Major General John G. Walker {{attacked}} Milliken's Bend up the Mississippi on June 7. This was mainly defended by recently enlisted United States Colored Troops. Despite having inferior weaponry, they fought bravely and finally repulsed the Confederates with help from gunboats, although at horrible cost; the defenders lost 652 to the Confederate 185. The loss at Milliken's Bend left the Confederates with no hope for relief but from the cautious Johnston.|$|E
5|$|Judas {{was killed}} in 160BCE and succeeded by his brother Jonathan, who {{attempted}} to build a barrier {{to cut off the}} Acra's <b>supply</b> <b>line.</b> Jonathan had already assembled the manpower required for the task when he was forced to confront the invading army of Seleucid general Diodotus Tryphon at Beth Shan (Scythopolis). Having invited Jonathan to a friendly conference, Tryphon had him seized and murdered. Jonathan was succeeded by another brother, Simon, who besieged and finally captured the Acra in 141BCE.|$|E
5|$|After Chickamauga, Rosecrans and his Army of the Cumberland {{retreated to}} {{fortified}} Chattanooga. Bragg held an ineffective siege against Chattanooga, {{but refused to}} take any further action as the Union forces there were reinforced by Ulysses S. Grant and reopened a tenuous <b>supply</b> <b>line.</b> Many of Bragg's subordinates, including Buckner, advocated that Bragg be relieved of command. Thomas L. Connelly, historian of the Army of Tennessee, believes that Buckner {{was the author of}} the anti-Bragg letter sent by the generals to President Jefferson Davis. Bragg retaliated by reducing Buckner to division command and abolishing the Department of East Tennessee.|$|E

50|$|Each {{side had}} three overall {{objectives}} in this battle. The first was {{to attack the}} <b>supply</b> <b>lines</b> of the other side.

50|$|Nobunaga enlisted Kuki Yoshitaka {{to set up}} a {{blockade}} and disrupt the fortress' <b>supply</b> <b>lines.</b> In August 1576, in the first Battle of Kizugawaguchi, the blockade failed. But Kuki Yoshitaka returned two years later with massive new battleships and, in the second Battle of Kizugawaguchi, he broke the Mōri <b>supply</b> <b>lines</b> for good.|$|R
5|$|Bergonzoli {{knew that}} if Bardia and Tobruk held out, a British advance further into Libya {{eventually}} must falter under the logistical difficulties of maintaining a desert force using an extended overland <b>supply</b> <b>line.</b> Not knowing how long he had to hold out, Bergonzoli was forced to ration his stocks {{of food and water}} so that O'Connor could not simply starve him out. Consequently, hunger and thirst adversely affected the morale of the Italian defenders that had already been shaken by the defeat at Sidi Barrani. So too did medical conditions undermine morale, particularly lice and dysentery, the results of poor sanitation.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with the}} sudden attacks by Chinese {{forces in the}} Eighth Army sector, General Douglas MacArthur ordered the Eighth Army to launch the Home-by-Christmas Offensive. To support the offensive, MacArthur ordered the X Corps to attack west from the Chosin Reservoir and to cut the vital Manpojin—Kanggye—Huichon <b>supply</b> <b>line.</b> As a response, Major General Edward M. Almond, {{commander}} of the US X Corps, formulated a plan on 21 November. It called for the US 1st Marine Division to advance west through Yudami-ni, while the US 7th Infantry Division would provide a regimental combat team to protect the right flank at Sinhung-ni. The US 3rd Infantry Division would also protect the left flank while providing security in the rear area. By then the X Corps was stretched thin along a 400-mile front.|$|E
5|$|In December, the {{regiment}} saw its first combat of their second enlistment during the Goldsboro Expedition. The {{objective of this}} maneuver was to disrupt the Confederate <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> along the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad by destroying the Goldsboro Bridge. Over {{the course of this}} expedition, the unit marched 180 miles and took part in the Battles of Kinston, White Hall and Goldsboro Bridge. During the latter engagement on December 15, 1864, the Goldsboro Bridge was destroyed by Union troops. On December 17, the expedition began its return march to New Bern while the 5th Massachusetts was posted to act as rear guard. In meeting these orders, they withstood heavy fire for two hours and repulsed one infantry charge. At the close of the expedition, {{the regiment}} had suffered light casualties of eight wounded.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the growing Confederate activity in the area, Grant decided to dispatch troops from the Vicksburg trenches across the river. The presence of Maj. Gen. John G. Walker's Confederate division on the Louisiana side was of particular concern; its presence could possibly aid a Confederate escape from Vicksburg. Therefore, Brig. Gen. Alfred W. Ellet's Mississippi Marine Brigade and Joseph A. Mower's brigade from Sherman's corps were ordered to the vicinity of Milliken's Bend. Mower and Ellet were to cooperate against Walker's division, which was stationed {{in the vicinity of}} Richmond, Louisiana. Richmond also happened to be an important <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> providing Vicksburg with food from Louisiana. On June 15, Ellet and Mower defeated Walker and destroyed Richmond, Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{submarines}} resumed {{operations in}} Australian waters in January 1943. I-21 made {{a highly successful}} patrol in January and February, during which she sank five ships, and two other submarines operated off Sydney and Brisbane in March. A force of five boats from the IJN's 3rd Submarine Squadron subsequently attacked shipping along {{the full length of}} the Australian east coast during April and May in an attempt to disrupt the Allied <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> to New Guinea. This marked the peak of the Japanese submarine offensive against Australia and nine ships were sunk off the east coast within a month. In contrast with 1942, several successful attacks were made against ships travelling in convoys.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Halleck's command was {{enlarged}} through {{consolidation of}} Grant's and Buell's armies and renamed the Department of the Mississippi. With Buell's Army of the Ohio under his command, Halleck ordered Buell to concentrate with Grant at Savannah. Buell began a march {{with much of}} his army from Nashville, Tennessee, and headed southwest toward Savannah. Halleck intended to take the field in person and lead both armies in an advance south to seize Corinth, Mississippi, where the Mobile and Ohio Railroad linking Mobile, Alabama, to the Ohio River intersected the Memphis and Charleston Railroad. The railroad was a vital <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> connecting the Mississippi River at Memphis, Tennessee to Richmond, Virginia.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Hood ordered Lt. Gen. William J. Hardee's corps on a march {{around the}} Union left flank, had Maj. Gen. Joseph Wheeler's cavalry march near Sherman's <b>supply</b> <b>line,</b> and had Maj. Gen. Benjamin Cheatham's corps attack the Union front. However, it took longer than {{expected}} for Hardee {{to get his}} men into position, and, during that time, McPherson had correctly deduced a possible threat to his left flank, and sent XVI Corps, his reserve, to help strengthen it. Hardee's men met this other force, and the battle began. Although the initial Confederate attack was repulsed, the Union left flank began to retreat. About this time, McPherson, who had ridden to the front to observe the battle, {{was shot and killed}} by Confederate infantry.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the Japanese counterattack and the brief US pursuit that {{followed}} in April, the focus of Japanese operations on Bougainville turned largely to subsistence as the incidence of illness began to rise {{as a result of the}} severance of the <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> from Rabaul. For their part, the US forces on the island also assumed a largely defensive posture, fortifying their perimeter around Torokina, and apart from limited patrolling, they did not pursue an offensive campaign throughout 1944 preferring to contain the Japanese rather than attempting to destroy them. This situation began to change in late 1944, when the Australian II Corps, under the command of Lieutenant General Stanley Savige, began relieving the US forces, who were transferred to the Philippines. After taking over the US base around Torokina, the Australians subsequently began a three-pronged offensive to secure the island, with heavy fighting taking place from December 1944 around Pearl Ridge until close to the end of the war, with major actions being fought around Slater's Knoll, Tsimba Ridge, Porton Plantation, Ratsua, and along the Hongorai River.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} months of 1941, British and Belgian colonial forces {{attacked}} Italian East Africa from the colony of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. By the end of March, they had seized the town of Gambela and begun containing retreating Italian forces, which were massing on a plateau in the mountain town of Saïo (presently Dembidolo) under the command of General Carlo De Simone and later General Pietro Gazzera. The British forces withdrew the following month and the Belgians advanced down the road to Saïo. The Italians repelled them and they were forced to hold their positions along a nearby brook. Almost no fighting took place in May as heavy rain bogged down the Belgians and turned their <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> from Sudan into mud, creating a food shortage. In early June, reinforcements arrived via river and the Belgians besieged the Italian supply depot at Mogi. Aggressive patrolling, combined with the actions of the Ethiopian resistance and raids from the South African Air Force put increased pressure upon the Italian garrison.|$|E
