5|$|About 50–80% of {{salicylate}} in {{the blood}} is bound to albumin protein, while the rest remains in the active, ionized state; protein binding is concentration-dependent. Saturation of binding sites leads to more free salicylate and increased toxicity. The volume of distribution is 0.1–0.2 L/kg. Acidosis increases the volume of distribution because of enhancement of tissue penetration of <b>salicylates.</b>|$|E
5|$|Both {{dogs and}} horses are {{susceptible}} to the gastrointestinal side effects associated with <b>salicylates,</b> {{but it is a}} convenient treatment for arthritis in older dogs, and has shown some promise in cases of laminitis in horses. It is no longer commonly used for cases of laminitis, as it could be counterproductive for treatment. Aspirin should be used in animals only under the direct supervision of a veterinarian; in particular, cats lack the glucuronide conjugates that aid in the excretion of aspirin, making it potentially toxic. No clinical signs of toxicosis occurred when cats were given 25mg/kg of aspirin every 48 hours for 4 weeks.|$|E
50|$|<b>Salicylate</b> sensitivity, {{also known}} as <b>salicylate</b> {{intolerance}}, is any adverse effect that occurs when a usual amount of <b>salicylate</b> is ingested.

40|$|Plasma <b>salicylate</b> {{concentration}} was monitored in 42 {{children on}} long-term <b>salicylate</b> therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. A given dose of <b>salicylate</b> per kg resulted in large variations in plasma levels, both between individuals {{and for a}} single individual at different times. The factors responsible for such variations were studied; in 6 cases urinary metabolites of <b>salicylate</b> were analysed. The relation between <b>salicylate</b> dosage and plasma half-life accounts {{for the fact that}} small changes in dosage can result in large changes in plasma concentration.

5|$|Aspirin {{is known}} to {{interact}} with other drugs. For example, acetazolamide and ammonium chloride are known to enhance the intoxicating effect of <b>salicylates,</b> and alcohol also increases the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with these types of drugs. Aspirin {{is known to}} displace a number of drugs from protein-binding sites in the blood, including the antidiabetic drugs tolbutamide and chlorpropamide, warfarin, methotrexate, phenytoin, probenecid, valproic acid (as well as interfering with beta oxidation, {{an important part of}} valproate metabolism), and other NSAIDs. Corticosteroids may also reduce the concentration of aspirin. Ibuprofen can negate the antiplatelet effect of aspirin used for cardioprotection and stroke prevention. The pharmacological activity of spironolactone may be reduced by taking aspirin, and it is known to compete with penicillin G for renal tubular secretion. Aspirin may also inhibit the absorption of vitamin C.|$|E
5|$|Other {{laboratory}} abnormalities {{may suggest}} poisoning, especially {{the presence of}} a metabolic acidosis, particularly if it is characterized by a large anion gap. Large anion gap acidosis is usually present during the initial stage of poisoning. However, acidosis has a large number of differential diagnosis, including poisoning from methanol, <b>salicylates,</b> iron, isoniazid, paracetamol, theophylline, or from conditions such as uremia or diabetic and alcoholic ketoacidosis. The diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning should be considered in any patient with a severe acidosis. Urine microscopy can reveal needle or envelope-shaped calcium oxalate crystals in the urine which can suggest poisoning; although these crystals may not be present until the late stages of poisoning. Finally, many commercial radiator antifreeze products have fluorescein added to enable radiator leaks to be detected using a Wood's lamp. Following ingestion of antifreeze products containing ethylene glycol and fluorescein, a Wood's lamp may reveal fluorescence of a patient’s mouth area, clothing, vomitus, or urine which can help to diagnose poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Salicylate medicines—including salicin, {{salicylic}} acid, {{and sodium}} salicylate— were difficult and wasteful to extract from plants, and in 1860 Hermann Kolbe {{worked out a}} way to synthesize salicylic acid. Throughout the late 1800s use of <b>salicylates</b> grew considerably, and physicians increasingly knew what to expect from these medicines: reduction of pain, fever, and inflammation. However, the unpleasant side effects, particularly gastric irritation, limited their usefulness, as did their intense bitterness. By the 1880s, the German chemical industry, jump-started by the lucrative development of dyes from coal tar, was branching out to investigate the potential of new tar-derived medicines. The turning point was the advent of Kalle & Company's Antifebrine, the branded version of the well-known dye derivative acetanilide—the fever-reducing properties of which were discovered by accident in 1886. Antifebrine's success inspired Carl Duisberg, the head of research at the small dye firm Friedrich Bayer & Company, to start a systematic search for other chemical fever-reducers. Bayer chemists soon developed Phenacetin, followed by the sedatives Sulfonal and Trional.|$|E
40|$|Treatment {{following}} <b>salicylate</b> ingestion {{is determined}} by clinical evidence of toxicity. Previous {{studies have shown that}} routine measurement of plasma <b>salicylate</b> concentrations in all overdose patients is unnecessary except in those with clinical features suggestive of <b>salicylate</b> poisoning or in those who are unable to give an accurate history [1]. This retrospective study evaluates whether plasma <b>salicylate</b> concentrations are appropriately measured. A retrospective study of all plasma <b>salicylate</b> concentrations measured in St Thomas’ Hospital Accident and Emergency department from 1 February 2001 to 31 January 2002 was conducted. Admission record cards were surveyed for history of <b>salicylate</b> ingestion, clinical features suggestive of a toxic <b>salicylate</b> concentration requiring treatment and the diagnosis recorded. Details of the <b>salicylate</b> overdose, concentrations and treatments were recorded. Of the 737 patients who had plasma <b>salicylate</b> concentrations measured, notes were available for review for 612 (82. 7 %) of patients. Sixteen records were excluded as <b>salicylate</b> concentrations had been measured inappropriately. 52. 3 % of patients were male. Fifty (6. 8 %) patients had a detectable <b>salicylate</b> concentration; three of these patients did not have notes available for review...|$|R
40|$|Sodium <b>salicylate</b> was {{administered}} to anesthetized dogs in doses sufficient to produce concentrations in plasma comparable to those common in human <b>salicylate</b> toxicity. <b>Salicylate</b> administration increased the rates of excretion of water, sodium, and chloride in the urine. <b>Salicylate</b> administration also increased the rate of excretion of potassium so that its clearance often exceeded that of creatinine. This enhancement of potassium excretion was dissociated from the alkalosis that accompanies salicyate toxicity. Administration of 5 % CO 2 in inspired gas did not attenuate the excretion of potassium; injection of <b>salicylate</b> into one renal artery caused a unilateral kaliuresis. Phosphate excretion increased progressively after administration of <b>salicylate.</b> On several occasions the clearance of phosphate equalled that of creatinine. <b>Salicylate</b> reduced renal tubular glucose reabsorption. When <b>salicylate</b> was injected into a renal artery, a glycosuria occurred ipsilaterally at filtered loads of glucose far below the reabsorptive capacity of the dog kidney. <b>Salicylate</b> administration also was associated with early elevation of glucose, phosphate, and potassium concentration in plasma. <b>Salicylate</b> administration reduced the content of adenosine triphosphate in the renal medulla. <b>Salicylate</b> was concentrated within the medulla between 1. 5 and 3 {{times that of the}} cortex, a gradient equal to that for chloride...|$|R
40|$|<b>Salicylate</b> {{is a small}} {{amphiphilic}} molecule {{which has}} diverse effects on membranes and membrane-mediated processes. We have utilized micropipette aspiration of giant unilamellar vesicles to determine <b>salicylate's</b> effects on lecithin membrane elasticity, bending rigidity, and strength. <b>Salicylate</b> effectively reduces the apparent area compressibility modulus and bending modulus of membranes in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations above 1 mM, but does not greatly alter the actual elastic compressibility modulus at the maximal tested concentration of 10 mM. The effect of <b>salicylate</b> on membrane strength was investigated using dynamic tension spectroscopy, which revealed that <b>salicylate</b> increases the frequency of spontaneous defect formation and lowers the energy barrier for unstable hole formation. The mechanical and dynamic tension experiments are consistent and support a picture in which <b>salicylate</b> disrupts membrane stability by decreasing membrane stiffness and membrane thickness. The tension-dependent partitioning of <b>salicylate</b> was utilized to calculate the molecular volume of <b>salicylate</b> in the membrane.

5|$|<b>Salicylates</b> are {{excreted}} {{mainly by}} the kidneys as salicyluric acid (75%), free salicylic acid (10%), salicylic phenol (10%), and acyl glucuronides (5%), gentisic acid (< 1%), and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid. When small doses (less than 250 mg in an adult) are ingested, all pathways proceed by first-order kinetics, with an elimination half-life of about 2.0 h to 4.5 h. When higher doses of salicylate are ingested (more than 4 g), the half-life becomes much longer (15 h to 30 h), because the biotransformation pathways {{concerned with the}} formation of salicyluric acid and salicyl phenolic glucuronide become saturated. Renal excretion of salicylic acid becomes increasingly important as the metabolic pathways become saturated, because it is extremely sensitive to changes in urinary pH. A 10- to 20-fold increase in renal clearance occurs when urine pH is increased from 5 to 8. The use of urinary alkalinization exploits this particular aspect of salicylate elimination.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{should not}} be taken by people who are {{allergic}} to ibuprofen or naproxen, or who have salicylate intolerance or a more generalized drug intolerance to NSAIDs, and caution should be exercised in those with asthma or NSAID-precipitated bronchospasm. Owing to its effect on the stomach lining, manufacturers recommend people with peptic ulcers, mild diabetes, or gastritis seek medical advice before using aspirin. Even if none of these conditions is present, the risk of stomach bleeding is still increased when aspirin is taken with alcohol or warfarin. People with hemophilia or other bleeding tendencies should not take aspirin or other <b>salicylates.</b> Aspirin is known to cause hemolytic anemia in people who have the genetic disease glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, particularly in large doses and depending on the severity of the disease. Use of aspirin during dengue fever is not recommended owing to increased bleeding tendency. People with kidney disease, hyperuricemia, or gout should not take aspirin because it inhibits the kidneys' ability to excrete uric acid, thus may exacerbate these conditions. Aspirin {{should not be}} given to children or adolescents to control cold or influenza symptoms, as this has been linked with Reye's syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Reye's syndrome, a rare but severe illness {{characterized}} by acute encephalopathy and fatty liver, can occur when children or adolescents are given aspirin for a fever or other illness or infection. From 1981 through 1997, 1207 cases of Reye's syndrome in people younger than 18 {{were reported to}} the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of these, 93% reported being ill in the three weeks preceding the onset of Reye's syndrome, most commonly with a respiratory infection, chickenpox, or diarrhea. <b>Salicylates</b> were detectable in 81.9% of children for whom test results were reported. After the association between Reye's syndrome and aspirin was reported, and safety measures to prevent it (including a Surgeon General's warning, and changes to the labeling of aspirin-containing drugs) were implemented, aspirin taken by children declined considerably in the United States, as did the number of reported cases of Reye's syndrome; a similar decline {{was found in the}} United Kingdom after warnings against pediatric aspirin use were issued. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration now recommends aspirin (or aspirin-containing products) should not be given to anyone under the age of 12 who has a fever, and the British Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency recommends children who are under 16 years of age should not take aspirin, unless it is on the advice of a doctor.|$|E

40|$|Heavily {{encapsulated}} Klebsiella pneumoniae (serotypes 1 and 2) was cultured in {{the presence}} of sodium <b>salicylate.</b> The addition of <b>salicylate</b> (2 to 30 micrograms/ml) progressively decreased the amount of capsular polysaccharide produced by all strains without significantly inhibiting cell growth. Further addition of <b>salicylate</b> (50 to 200 micrograms/ml) was progressively inhibitory to cell growth and decreased the production of polysaccharide only slightly. The optimal concentration of <b>salicylate</b> that could reduce the polysaccharide production of heavily encapsulated, virulent strains by 50 % or more was 30 micrograms/ml. Mutants of these bacteria that produced less capsule were affected by <b>salicylate</b> to a lesser degree. All concentrations of <b>salicylate</b> tested were physiologically achievable in humans and within the therapeutic range of aspirin. The addition of calcium and magnesium partially reversed the effects of <b>salicylate</b> on polysaccharide production. Chelating agents, particularly EGTA [ethylene-bis(oxyethylenenitrile) tetraacetic acid], reduce capsule production as <b>salicylate</b> did. Thus, the chelation of calcium and magnesium by <b>salicylate</b> could account, at least in part, for the reduction of capsule.
