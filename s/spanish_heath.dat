5|$|Invasive weeds are {{prevalent}} in, {{and damaging}} to, the park. Species common in other formerly occupied {{parts of the}} foothills are also common in the park. Of significant concern, largely for their impact on native flora, are bridal creeper (Asparagus asparagoides), boneseed (Chrysanthemoides monilifera), artichoke thistle (Cynara cardunculus), varieties of broom, <b>Spanish</b> <b>heath</b> (Erica lusitanica), fennel (Foeniculum vulgare), olives, blackberries, common gorse (Ulex europaeus) and dog rose (Rosa canina). In July 2001, Phytophthora cinnamomi, a significant cause of plant disease in the Adelaide Hills, {{was found in the}} park. Mechanical countermeasures, in the form of boot scrubbing stations, have been introduced to control its spread.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{invasive}} plant species inhabit the Peter Murrell Conservation Area and threaten native vegetation. These invasive plant species include gorse (Ulex europeaus), <b>Spanish</b> <b>heath</b> (Erica lusitanica), English broom (Cytisus scoparius), canary broom (Genista monspessulana), boneseed (Chrysanthemoides monilifera), blackberry (Rubus fruticosus), blue-butterfly-bush (Psoralea pinnata) and introduced wattles (Acacia spp.). Invasive {{species such as}} these can threaten ecosystems as they can displace native species, contribute to land degradation and lessen overall productivity.|$|E
50|$|Erica lusitanica is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the family Ericaceae, known by the common names Portuguese heath and <b>Spanish</b> <b>heath.</b> It is native to Spain, Portugal and southwestern France. It is named for Lusitania, a historical region encompassing most of modern Portugal and parts of western Spain.|$|E
60|$|Again. There is {{a little}} pink {{butterwort}} here in the bogs, which grows, too, in dear old Devonshire and Cornwall; {{and also in the}} south-west of Scotland. Now, when I found that too, in the bogs near Biarritz, close to the Pyrenees, and knew that it stretched away along the Spanish coast, and into Portugal, what could my common sense lead me to say but that Scotland, and Ireland, and Cornwall, and Spain were all joined once? Those are only a few examples. I could give you a dozen more. For instance, on an island away there to the west, and only in one spot, there grows a little sort of lily, which is found I believe in Brittany, and on the <b>Spanish</b> and Portuguese <b>heaths,</b> and even in North-west Africa. And that Africa and Spain were joined not so very long ago at the Straits of Gibraltar there is no doubt at all.|$|R

50|$|Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve {{is under}} {{considerable}} threat from such events as altered hydrology, declining native vegetation, pest animals and plant, and inappropriate fire regimes. Conservation {{management of the}} reserve is complex, {{with half of the}} original vegetation in patchy distribution. Invasive weeds include blackberry, gorse, <b>Spanish</b> <b>heath,</b> ragwort and St John’s wort, and introduced predators such as foxes, Fallow and Samba deer. A major threat to the helmeted honeyeater comes from another native bird, the bell miner (Manorina melanophrys).|$|E
50|$|In the 1983 concept plan, 413 {{plant species}} were identified, {{including}} 124 {{that were not}} native to the park. The park was noted {{as one of the}} few remaining significant areas of bushland in the foothills. By 2006, the flora list contained 411 species, with 107 of these non-native. Five of the native species were then noted as rare or vulnerable, including Prasophyllum pallidum (pale leek-orchid). The park has significant stands of pink gums (Eucalyptus fasciculosa) and long-leafed box (Eucalyptus goniocalyx). button daisy, pussy tail (Ptilotus macrocephalus), needlebush (Hakea sericea), silky guinea flower (Hibbertia sericea) and black rapier sedge (Lepidosperma carphoides) are common. black-boys (Xanthorrhoea), hop bush (Dodonaea viscosa ssp. spatulata) and tea-tree form the understory in parts of the park. The area around the ruins of Newman's Nursery is noted for its spring orchid display. Quarry floors have large plants typical of much of the Mount Lofty Ranges. Golden wattle (Acacia pycnantha) and drooping sheoak (Allocasuarina verticillata), as well as red gums (Eucalyptus camaldulensis), native pine (Callitris preissii) and blue gum (Eucalyptus leucoxylon) are common.Invasive weeds are prevalent in, and damaging to, the park.

40|$|Virgin {{olive oil}} {{phenolic}} compounds have been {{revealed to be}} potent antioxidants {{as part of the}} Mediterranean diet. To test the hypothesis that these phenolics can modulate the serum and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) triacylglycerol concentrations in humans, a double-blind, randomized, crossover trial was designed. Thirty-three participants received 25 mL/d of refined olive oil (devoid of phenolic content [PC]), common olive oil (PC = 370 mmol/kg), and virgin olive oil (PC = 825 mmol/kg) in a Latin square design. The 3 olive oils were administered over 3 periods of 3 weeks, each one preceded by 2 -week washout periods. All analyses were carried out on an intention-to-treat basis. The interventions did not modify the concentrations of serum and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triacylglycerol; but they exerted changes in the cholesterol, triacylglycerol, and phospholipid content of VLDL. The virgin olive oil consumption led to increased oleic and palmitic acids, as well as decreased linoleic acid, in VLDL. The main outcome was the significant dose-dependent linear trend between the PC in the olive oils and the palmitic (16 : 0) and linoleic (18 : 2 n- 6) acid and their corresponding triacylglycerol molecular species in VLDL. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.
