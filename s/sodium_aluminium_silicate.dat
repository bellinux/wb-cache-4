40|$|Milling is a {{ubiquitous}} {{process in}} the glass industry for both feed and recycled materials. A good example of materials of interest is silica, which is available in natural quartzite rock as well as fused silica. Such materials are hard, tough and stiff and require considerable energy for their size reduction. So it {{is of a great}} interest to establish the most efficient size reduction method for both amorphous and crystalline structures of such materials. Three sets of silicate materials were chosen for this study: set 1 : fused silica (SiO 2) and quartzite; set 2 : amorphous lithium silicate and crystalline lithium silicate (Li 2 Si 2 O 5); set 3 : amorphous <b>sodium</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicate</b> and crystalline <b>sodium</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicate</b> (NaAl(SiO 4)). The test materials properties were characterised for their physical, chemical and mechanical properties. The milling behaviour was studied using a Retsch single ball mill. This was chosen as its dynamics has previously been extensively investigated. The milling results were analysed using a first order rate equation. The milling rate constant (Kp) and grinding limit size (Dl) were determined as a function of humidity. It was found that humidity had no effect on the milling rate. The Rosin-Rammler distribution was found to fit best for the mono mode cumulative particle size distribution. The test materials were cut and prepared in the cube form with a linear dimension of about 7. 5 mm. The process of breakage was closely observed. At the start of the milling process, the cubes underwent chipping at the edges and corners. As the process continued, micro-cracks began to propagate through the body of the cube due to fatigue. This resulted in rapid fragmentation and disintegration of the cube, quickly reaching the grinding limit size. For the quartzite and <b>sodium</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicate</b> materials crack propagation took place through inter-crystalline boundaries. After this stage individual grains started to reduce in size until they reached the grinding limit size. In the case of crystalline lithium silicate the spherulitic microstructure causes adhesion of fines to the milling media. The crushed particles do not detach easily from the mother particle and form a thick coating on its surfaces, thereby protecting it. Also the fine powder covers the surfaces of the capsule and stainless steel ball. A new method of milling should be explored, which reduces the adhesion of fines to surfaces. The energy consumption in the shaking ball milling calculated with EDEM simulation. It was found that the input power can be increased with the size of stainless steel ball. At 30 Hz, 11. 97 mm steel ball and 1 g of cube samples are calculated the input power as 1. 89 W. The mechanical properties of hardness and toughness were characterised by various methods and the breakability index (H/(Kc^ 2)) was calculated. It was found that the milling rate correlated well with the breakability index for all the tested materials. The breakability index provides a methodology whereby the milling performance, i. e. milling rate and energy utilization can be predicted from the characterisation of mechanical properties. ...|$|E

The smectite group refers to a family of non-metallic clays primarily composed of hydrated <b>sodium</b> calcium <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicate,</b> a group of monoclinic clay-like minerals with general formula (Ca, Na, H)(Al, Mg, Fe, Zn) 2 (Si, Al) 4 O 10 (OH) 2 ·nH 2 O (Grim 1962).

The basic structural unit is a layer consisting of two inward-pointing tetrahedral sheets with a central alumina octahedral sheet. The layers are continuous in the length and width directions, but the bonds between these layers are weak and have excellent cleavage, allowing water and other molecules to enter between the layers causing expansion in the highness direction. Isomorphous substitution gives the various types of smectite and causes a net permanent charge balanced by cations in such a manner that water may move between the sheets of the crystal lattice, giving a reversible cation exchange and very plastic properties (Grim 1962).|$|R

40|$|With {{increase}} {{in the growth of}} industrialization, proper disposal of wastes {{is one of the major}} issues nowadays that has to be handled with seriously Research has sprung to full pace in recent years on utilization of wastes. Geopolymerization is the latest trend in that path. The requirements for the synthesis of any geopolymer are alkali solution and aluminosilicate material. So the by-products which are rich in Silica and Alumina can be used as aluminosilicate sources. In the present work, four by-products namely ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS), fly ash, rice husk ash (RHA) and red mud were taken as raw materials. All the materials except rice husk ash constitute alumina along with silica. These materials were activated by NaOH with varying percentages i. e. 5 %, 10 %, 15 % of raw material. Light compaction tests were conducted for each addition of chemical to the raw material. The effect of different percentages of NaOH on the strength of raw materials was investigated by unconfined compressive tests. For each combination of raw material and percentage of NaOH, three samples were prepared at optimum moisture content (OMC) and maximum dry density (MDD) and kept for curing at ambient temperature for prefixed periods (i. e. 0 day, 7 days, and 28 days). Mineralogical analysis of the samples was done by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The results show that with {{increase in}} percentages of NaOH, the strength of GGBFS and fly ash increases. But the strength of alkali activated RHA on 7 th day of curing decreases from the immediate strength due to presence of carbon in the material. The strength of red mud with 5 % NaOH on 7 th day is higher than the immediate strength and for other percentages, the strength decreases. The reaction between alkali and slag is quick which completes with 7 days of curing.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Sodium in coal {{has been}} {{associated}} with the fouling of heat transfer surfaces of boilers for many years even though its role has not been understood in detail. Currently, a theoretical and experimental study has been undertaken to investigate the reactions and reaction mechanisms of sodium with sulphur species and with inherent silica and kaolin during coal combustion and the cooling of the combustion gases. The dependence of these reactions on the form of the sodium in the coal and the combustion temperature has also been assessed. The experimental investigations involved combusting synthetic coals in which the concentrations, the size and the distribution of the inorganic constituents were controlled. These coals were prepared by adding into a slurry of demineralised Loy Yang brown coal, known quantities of inorganic constituents - sodium as a solution of sodium chloride or sodium acetate and as required, size graded silica or kaolin. The slurry was dried, pulverised and sieved to obtain the 63 - 90 μm size fraction used in the experiments. The coals were combusted in a drop tube furnace and the supra micron product ash was collected in a heated cyclone, upstream of a filter to collect the submicron condensed sodium salts. As well as coal composition, other experimental variables examined, were the furnace wall temperatures of 1000 °C, 1200 °C and 1400 °C, coal feed rates of 5. 5 g/h and 2. 7 g/h, position and temperature at which the reaction products were quenched and collected, and the addition of gaseous sulphur dioxide with the secondary air equivalent to 3 % sulphur in the dry coal. The collected ash was analysed by wet chemical methods, examined by electron microscope and sized by a Malvern laser diffraction particle size analyser. The experimental program included the determination of coal particle temperatures by combusting a synthetic coal with inherent ash which was stable under combustion conditions and had a sharp melting point. The data from these experiments was used as input to a combustion model to establish the char reactivity which was then used in the same model to predict combustion parameters for the range of conditions employed in the other experiments. The experiments to investigate the reactions of sodium chloride with sulphur oxides in combustion gases, showed that below 1000 °C, the sulphation of sodium chloride was kinetically limited for times which are normally available in p. c. fired boilers. For temperatures above 1100 °C, the extent of sulkphation was found to be greater than that predicted at the thermodynamic equilibrium for the overall system, possibly due to the formation of the radicals NaSO₂ and NaSO₃ during combustion. From the experiments to study the reactions of sodium with silica, it was found that sodium silicates formed almost exclusively during coal combustion, probably due to the progressive agglomeration and coalescence of the ash reducing the surface of silica available for reaction. The rate of silicate formation increased with temperature but this was largely offset by a parallel reduction in combustion time, resulting in only small changes in the extent of formation with temperature. Generally, the extent of silicate formation was greatest at 1200 °C and least at 1000 °C. The presence of chlorine and to a much lesser extent sulphur, reduced the formation of sodium silicate. By firing coals which contained a mixture of two separately prepared coals, one with a sodium salt and the other with only silica, it was shown that at gas temperatures of 1200 °C- 1400 °C, sodium was completely released from the coal {{prior to the start of}} silicate formation. At 1000 °C, both organic sodium and sodium chloride were probably not fully released before silicate formation commenced. Exploratory experiments with kaolin evidenced that sodium, as sodium chloride, reacted to a greater extent with kaolin than with silica. Qualitative agreement was found between the experimental results and the thermodynamic equilibrium predictions of the influence of chlorine, sulphur, alumina and sodium concentration on the extent of sodium silicate or <b>sodium</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicate</b> formation. Equilibrium calculations indicated that calcium or magnesium would reduce the extent of combination of sodium with silica. Theoretical predictions of the release rate of sodium from coal, during combustion, also agreed in general with experimental results. A theoretical model was developed to study the reaction of organic sodium with silica during coal combustion. From this model it was concluded that the reaction rate was controlled initially by the diffusion of sodium hydroxide in the char boundary layer but as combustion proceeded, the diffusion of sodium oxide in the product silicate melt combined with the diffusion of sodium hydroxide through the porous char increasing influenced the reaction rate. The results of the study show that the influence of sodium on the severity of fouling in boilers is dependent on the form and concentration of the sodium in the coal, the composition of the coal's other inorganic constituents and the combustion and furnace conditions...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} has been to {{evaluate}} and understand the effect of caustic alkali solution of varying composition on the behaviour of expansive soil containing mixed layered minerals. Mixed layered minerals are formed {{of two or more}} kinds of inter grown layers, not physical mixtures. Illite - smectite is the most abundant and wide spread of the mixed layered clay minerals in sedimentary rocks and soils and also more common than either discrete illite or smectite. In geotechnical engineering much attention has not been paid to the behaviour of soils containing mixed layered minerals. Much less is known about the behaviour of these soils in polluted environment. Mixed layered minerals are more susceptible to environmental changes as the structural linkages between the layer minerals are weak compared to normal layered phyllosilicates. One important pollutant that can have considerable effect on the behaviour of soils is the caustic alkali contamination released from various industries. Recent {{studies have shown that the}} behaviour of even stable minerals is affected by alkali contamination. However, the effect of caustic alkali contamination on the behaviour of soils containing mixed layered minerals is not known and has been chosen for detailed study. Also to understand the mechanism of their interaction with alkali, it is necessary to study the effect of alkali solutions on the constituent clay minerals viz., montmorillonite and illite under similar conditions. To elucidate the mechanism of soil alkali interaction limited tests were conducted with simple electrolyte solution, as the alkali solution also acts as electrolyte apart from being alkaline. To confirm the mechanism of interaction, tests are also conducted on these soils with industrial spent liquor containing high caustic alkali and suspended alumina obtained from an alumina extraction plant treating bauxite with high alkali solutions at high temperatures. The results obtained in the laboratory are compared with the soil samples contaminated with leaking industrial Bayer's liquid in the field. Studies are also conducted to suggest remedial measures to control the adverse effects of alkali solutions on soil containing mixed layer minerals. The content of the thesis is broadly divide into 8 Chapters - viz., Introduction, Background and overview, Experimental program and procedures, Behaviour of soils containing mixed layer mineral illite - smectite (BCSI), Behaviour of montmorillonite and illite, Influence of Bayer's liquor and study on the field contaminated soils, Measures to control the influence of alkali contamination on BCSI and Summary and conclusions. The broad outline of these chapters is given in Chapter 1. A review of literature on the behaviour of soils containing different types of clay minerals with emphasis on mixed layer minerals has been presented in Chapter 2. The influence of different inorganic contaminants on the properties of soils in terms of their physical and chemical characteristics as well as their concentration has been summarized. The importance of changes in surface characteristics of soil particles and the changes in the thickness of diffuse double layer in altering the property of soils at low concentration of contaminants and changes in the mineralogy with high concentrated contaminants such as acids and alkalis has been highlighted. This forms the background information necessary to bring out the scope of the study. Four soils having different mineralogy have been used in this study. These soils are, black cotton soil containing predominantly mixed layer mineral illite - smectite mineral called rectorite, illite, montmorillonite (common smectite) and black cotton soil containing predominantly montmorillonite. The properties of the soils used are described in Chapter 3. Caustic alkali solutions of 1 N, 4 N concentration prepared in the laboratory and industrial alkali-spent liquor are used as contaminants. The spent Bayer's liquor had about 4 N alkali concentration and 10 % alumina in suspension. To simulate the effect of suspended alumina, two more caustic alkali solutions of 1 N and 4 N solutions containing 10 % alumina by weight of solutions are also prepared. To isolate the effect of electrolyte solutions from that of alkali solution, two electrolyte solutions of 1 N and 4 N sodium chloride solutions are also used. Test procedures for conducting various tests such as pH, water adsorption characteristics, X-ray diffraction studies, SEM studies, thermal characteristics and geotechnical properties such as Atterberg limits, Oedometer tests and Shear Strength are given in this chapter. The test procedures are modified, wherever necessary, to bring out the effect of contaminants, particularly the effect of duration of interaction on the properties of soils. The source and properties of black cotton soil are presented in Chapter 4. Detailed x-diffraction studies have confirmed the presence of inter layered illite-smectite mineral viz., rectorite, which is uncommon in Indian expansive soils, and is classified as CH (Clay of high compressibility) as per ASTM soil classification. Effect of alkali and salt solutions of 1 N and 4 N concentration on all physico chemical and geotechnical properties are studied in this chapter. As it is known that presence of certain elements such as aluminium influence the soil alkali interaction, the effect of suspended alumina along with alkali solution has also been investigated. The effect of contaminating fluids such as 1 N NaOH, 4 N NaOH with and without alumina, 1 N NaCl and 4 N NaCl on the geotechnical properties of the soil has been studied. Mineralogical changes were observed by XRD and thermal studies in the soil treated with 4 N NaOH solution and 4 N NaOH + 10 % alumina. The interlayer potassium of illite is released and potassium hydroxide is formed in soil treated with 4 N NaOH. Swelling compounds such as <b>sodium</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicate</b> hydroxide hydrate (SASH) has formed due to attack of 4 N NaOH + 10 % alumina on silica rather than on rectorite. Thus the studies clearly bring out that the rectorite present in the soil is dissociated only in the presence of strong alkali solutions of concentration of about 4 N. The liquid limit of soil decreased with increase in the electrolyte concentration in the case of NaCl solutions. With 1 N NaOH, the liquid limit of soil increased due to increase in the thickness of diffuse double layer due to increased pH. However, Proctor's maximum dry density increased and optimum moisture content decreased with 1 N NaOH. With increase in the concentration of alkali solution to 4 N, the rectorite dissociates into constituent minerals with the formation potassium hydroxide. The liquid limit of soil decreased probably due to the dominating influence of electrolyte nature of hydroxide solution over the effect of increased negative charge on clay particles due increase in the pH on the constituent minerals. Proctor's maximum dry density decreased and optimum moisture content increased with 4 N NaOH. Sediment volume and oedometer free swell at seating/nominal surcharge load of 6. 25 kPa of soil increased in 1 N and 4 N caustic alkali solutions, though by different mechanisms. The increase with 1 N solution is essentially due to increased negative charges on clay mineral surface. However, the increase in swelling with 4 N solution is associated with the dissociation of rectorite mineral and occurs in two distinct phases unlike in the case of 1 N solution. While the first phase can be attributed to the effect of alkaline nature of the solution after reduction in its concentration due to reaction with rectorite and the consequent reduction in its electrolyte nature. The second phase is due to the swelling of the separated constituent minerals in the presence of excess of alkali and occurs after much delay. Consolidation behaviour of rectorite in 1 N and 4 N alkali solutions has been studied in two ways: 1). Loading without waiting for the second stage of swelling to occur, as in standard consolidation procedure and 2). Loading after completion of second stage of swelling which is occurring after considerable delay as explained earlier. Normally one would initiate loading after equilibrium is reached at the end of first stage of swelling and second stage of swelling is not suspected. As there is no second stage of swelling with 1 N solutions, these two types of consolidation tests produced the same results. Abnormal rebound is observed during unloading with 4 N solution in which loading cycle is initiated without waiting for second stage of swelling to complete. It is interesting to note that while the liquid limit of soil decreased with increase in the concentration of alkali solution, the swelling increased. The testing procedure and period of interaction as well as the concentration of alkali solution during the test in these two tests are different. The effects of alkali solution are more severe in case of liquid limit because of thorough mixing and consequent effective reaction during testing. Similarly, the volume changes in soil that has already reacted with 4 N alkali solution when exposed to further to alkali contamination are considerably less compared to uncontaminated soil exposed to fresh contamination. The shear strength of soil treated with 4 N-alkali solution has increased particularly after long period of interaction. This indicates that the soil after mineralogical changes posses good strength. Chapter 5 presents the effect of alkali and salt solutions on the physico chemical and geotechnical properties of component minerals of mixed layered illite/smectite. For this study, commercially obtained montmorillonite (bentonite), naturally occurring black soil containing montmorillonite and commercially pure illite are used. It was observed that montmorillonite alkali reactions would not produce significant mineralogical changes where as illite is dissociated into smectite with the formation of potassium silicate by the interaction of released potassium with soluble silica. This confirms that the ultimate products of rectorite with alkali solutions would be smectite and compounds of potassium. In the absence of mineralogical alterations the liquid limit of montmorillonite decreases due to suppression of diffuse double layer thickness due to dominating influence of alkali solutions on this highly active clay. However a small increase in liquid limit is observed in illite with alkali solutions. Thus the net effect of alkali on rectorite is to decrease the liquid limit with increase in alkali concentration. While the free swell and oedometer swelling of montmorillonite generally decreases with increase in the alkali concentration, they increase in illite. However, in both the minerals the swelling occurs only in one phase. Thus the second phase of swelling that has been observed in rectorite can be attributed to delayed swelling of montmorillonite that has been released by the attack of alkali on rectorite. The behaviour of black soil containing mixed layer mineral contaminated in the field and laboratory by leaking Bayer's spent liquor in an alumina extraction plant has been studied in Chapter 6. The Atterberg limits of the samples treated with liquor are reduced and sediment volume increased. Similarly the swelling at seating load in consolidation test is higher in sample compacted with water and inundated with liquor. X-ray diffraction studies showed that the mineralogical changes are similar to those occurred with 4 N caustic alkali solution. The mineralogical and micro structural changes in the soil samples that are contaminated by leaked spent liquor in the field are relatively more marked. Also the behavior of highly montmorillonite clay, bentonite, has been studied contaminated with liquor in the laboratory. The study on the effect of high concentrated alkali solutions on montmorillonite can be useful to study the effect of interaction on the dissociated montmorillonite. These studies are helpful to suggest some possible remedial measures to control the adverse effect of alkali on soils. Possible Remedial schemes that can be adopted before and after contamination of the soil to control the adverse effect of alkali solutions on the black cotton soil containing mixed layered mineral are listed and their effectiveness examined in Chapter 7. The suggested remedial measures include flushing with water to dilute the effect of alkali, neutralisation with dilute hydrochloric acid, stabilisation of soil with lime and calcium chloride and use of impervious membrane to separate the foundation soil from alkali solution. The effectiveness of different measures as well as the method of their application has been described. Efforts are made to understand the mechanism of remedial action. Consolidation tests conducted on soil contaminated with 4 N alkali solution and inundated with water showed increased swelling due to dilution of the alkali concentration. Though the swelling of contaminated soil can be controlled by passing dilute hydrochloric acid (1 N), the method is not advocated as it can lead to ground water contamination. Mixing the soil with solutions containing up to 5 % by weight of calcium compound in water could not prevent the alkali induced heave in the long run when inundated with 4 N alkali solution. This was due to dissolution of silica by the strong alkali solutions and formation of swelling compounds such as <b>sodium</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicate</b> hydroxide hydrate (SASH). The formation of sodium aluminates occurred only when the alkali solution contained alumina or soil contained calcium compounds. There are no significant variations in the effects of calcium chloride or calcium hydroxide on contaminated soil. Replacing the foundation soil with soil thoroughly contaminated with 4 N alkali solutions and controlling the migration of contaminants into the foundation soil using high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geosynthetic membranes can be an effective measure to control the heaving in alkali contaminated foundation soil containing interstratified illite – smectite.

The strength development and mineralogical changes of {{this class of}} concretes were evaluated over a three-year period, using an equivalent conventional Grade N 40 (40 MPa) ordinary Portland cement (OPC) concrete as the reference product. The initial strength gain of the metakaolin samples was high, as the concrete reached 57 MPa at seven days compared to 11 MPa for the fly ash samples. However, the overall strength gain for fly ash samples at three years was about 64 % {{higher than that of}} OPC concretes, and 8 % higher than the corresponding metakaolin concrete. Also, binders used in all concretes fell well below the 0. 1 % expansion threshold in standard accelerated ASR tests. After three years of curing, the early-age reaction products of inorganic polymer samples appeared to be mainly amorphous solid solutions of <b>sodium</b> potassium <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicate</b> structures. However, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) results suggested that the resulting compounds were gradually becoming more ordered with time. Clear similarities in respect of the position of the X-ray amorphous band - characteristic of the gel phase - could be established for concretes made with metakaolin and fly ash; although marginal differences were evident in the evolution of isolated crystalline peaks between the two formulations.

40|$|The {{production}} of alumina from bauxite by the Bayer process generates a {{large volume of}} residue (red mud). This residue contains a percentage of complex zeolitic <b>sodium</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicates,</b> formed by the precipitation of silica from the Bayer liquor and are known as the desilication product or DSP. The presence of DSP in red mud contributes significantly to making the residue highly alkaline and high in sodium and therefore a potential environmental hazard upon disposal. This thesis documents {{the findings of a}} study with the objective of examining the nature and behaviour of a DSP-type mineral, determining its stability, including {{the way in which the}} release of sodium occurs and the potential for cation exchange. By so doing, a clearer picture of the DSP in red mud and its reaction to environmental factors, such as the pH of water percolating through the red mud disposal sites, was sought. An insight into the possibility of predisposal treatments, such as mixing the mud with acid waste or with material that would induce a favourable cation exchange was similarly gained. A laboratory-synthesised DSP mineral was used in these studies, because of the difficulty of working with red mud, in which DSP is cloaked with other residue minerals. The similarity of various synthetic DSPs (including the synthetic material used for this work) to that found in red mud was examined. It was found that the DSP formed at Alcoa's Kwinana plant (Western Australia) was a composite of the minerals noselite/nosean and sodalite, with sulphate being the main anion incorporated into the DSP. The synthetic mineral used in the study was therefore a mixture of the three aforementioned minerals. The sensitivity of synthetic and non-synthetic DSP to the citrate-bicarbonate-dithionite CBD method, used in leaching away the iron oxide that masks the DSP in red mud was examined. No significant effect on the DSP after leaching by CBD was observable. This confirmed that studies of DSP in red mud after removal of iron oxides by the CBD method were valid. In the study of DSP stability, its behaviour at various levels of acidity and alkalinity was noted, to determine under what disposal conditions the potentially harmful release of sodium is most likely to occur and to provide information relevant to acid-waste treatment of red mud before or at disposal. Synthetic DSP samples were subjected to a range of pH conditions, from very alkaline to very acidic, over a range of time periods up to three weeks duration. The results of these tests indicated that DSP is stable to pHs as low as 8. 5, with no significant release of sodium to the environment after 3 weeks. The study of cation exchange behaviour in DSP was undertaken to determine if exchanging sodium (which is toxic to plants) for some likely cations such as potassium or ammonium (plant nutrients) may feasibly be used to rehabilitate red mud, since zeolitic minerals like those in DSPs are noted for their ion exchange properties. The exchange of sodium from within synthetic DSP for potassium, ammonium and calcium ions was investigated. It was concluded that the cubic crystal habit of the DSP examined restricted the exchange of sodium ions with cations such as calcium, but allowed other cations (particularly potassium) to penetrate and replace up to 30...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to investigate the use of propranolol-magnesium <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicate</b> intercalated complexes as drug reservoirs in hydroxypropylmethylcellulose tablets. The matrix tablets containing the complexes were prepared and characterised with respect to propranolol release and were subsequently compared with those loading propranolol or a propranolol-magnesium <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicate</b> physical mixture. Additionally, the effects of varying viscosity grades of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, compression pressures and calcium acetate incorporation on the drug release characteristics of the complex-loaded tablets were also examined. The results showed that the complex-loaded tablets have higher tablet hardness than those containing propranolol or a physical mixture. The drug release from the complex-loaded tablets followed a zero-order release kinetic, whereas an anomalous transport was found in the propranolol or physical mixture tablets. The drug release rate of the complex tablet significantly decreased with increasing hydroxypropylmethylcellulose viscosity grade. Increase in the compression pressure caused a decrease in the drug release rate of the tablets. Furthermore, the incorporation of calcium ions could accelerate propranolol release, particularly in acidic medium, because calcium ions could be exchanged with propranolol molecules intercalated in the silicate layers of magnesium <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicate.</b> These findings suggest that propranolol-magnesium <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicate</b> intercalated complexes show strong potential for use as drug reservoirs in matrix tablets intended for modifying drug release...|$|R
