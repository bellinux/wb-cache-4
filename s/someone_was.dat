5|$|During a video {{interview}} at Gamescom, {{most of the}} setlist was inadvertently leaked because <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> scrolling through the setlist in the background. Harmonix released a video response to the leak the next day, officially denying the rumored setlist, while once again showing the setlist {{in the background and}} confirming additional songs. The full setlist was formally announced on August 25 on the Rock Band website.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1975, Ochs {{took on the}} {{identity}} of John Butler Train. He told people that Train had murdered Ochs, and that he, John Butler Train, had replaced him. Train was convinced that <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> trying to kill him, so he carried a weapon at all times: a hammer, a knife, or a lead pipe.|$|E
5|$|A badly wounded Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) {{returns to}} camp {{and tells the}} others about Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan), and that other people live on the island, besides the plane {{survivors}}. Locke looks on from the shadows with his arms crossed. Hurley reveals to Jack {{that one of the}} survivors is not listed on the flight manifest, which means that <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> already on the island when the plane crashed. Claire's contractions begin to stop. Claire and Charlie are then met by Ethan, who looks at them ominously.|$|E

A manĝonto <b>is</b> <b>someone</b> who will eat. Also, a manĝito <b>is</b> <b>someone</b> who <b>was</b> eaten, a manĝato <b>is</b> <b>someone</b> who <b>is</b> being eaten, and a manĝoto <b>is</b> <b>someone</b> who will <b>be</b> eaten.|$|R

3000|$|It will be {{instructive}} {{to see how}} these results {{can be applied to}} the case of malicious pleasure (‘Schadenfreude’) which has been a notorious problem of axiologists ever since Brentano. In a recent discussion of it which draws on Brentano’s, Ross’s and Chisholm’s related views, Noah Lemos concludes that “we may say that the property of being pleased that <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> suffering is not an intrinsically good-making property (…) [but] it hardly follows that the property of being pleased is not (…). These are, after all, distinct properties, since one can have the latter without having the former. (…) The fact that <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> pleased is different from the fact that <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> pleased that <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> suffering [...]...|$|R
5|$|Between May 1917 and May 1918, Mackinnon {{worked at}} the University War Hospital in Southamptom with William Fletcher from the Royal Army Medical Corps, {{focussing}} on the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} dysentery. The pair focussed on two forms of Shigella dysenteriae which had been identified by Simon Flexner and Kiyoshi Shiga. They discovered that the Flexner bacillus could go into intermission and be undetectable for periods of four to five weeks, making it very difficult to say when <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> no longer a carrier. They also found that men who were carriers of Shiga's bacillus would be prone to depression and would be no longer fit to be soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The {{illness of}} Augustus in 23BC brought {{the problem of}} {{succession}} {{to the forefront of}} political issues and the public. To ensure stability, he needed to designate an heir to his unique position in Roman society and government. This was to be achieved in small, undramatic, and incremental ways that did not stir senatorial fears of monarchy. If <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> to succeed Augustus' unofficial position of power, he would have to earn it through his own publicly proven merits.|$|E
5|$|The {{immediate}} effect of Peterloo was {{a crackdown on}} reform. The government instructed the police and courts {{to go after the}} journalists, presses and publication of the Manchester Observer. Wroe {{was arrested and charged with}} producing a seditious publication. Found guilty he was sentenced to twelve months in prison and fined £100. Outstanding court cases against the Manchester Observer were rushed through the courts and a continual change of sub-editors was not sufficient defence against a series of police raids, often on the suspicion that <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> writing a radical article. The Manchester Observer closed in February 1820.|$|E

5|$|Those {{with more}} serious {{injuries}} {{had to be}} carried down the track. The usual {{decision as to whether}} it was safe to move <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> simplified by the Japanese, who killed all the wounded they encountered. Only those near death were abandoned. Casualties were held at the aid posts and dressing stations until they could walk, or the Japanese threatened. It took eight or ten Papuan carriers to move each man. Army stretchers rotted and fell apart; the Papuans improvised stretchers from blankets, copra bags and timber cut along the Track. The pace of the withdrawal was dictated by the rate at which casualties could be evacuated.|$|E
5|$|By the 18th century, {{the prison}} had {{separate}} areas for its {{two classes of}} prisoner: the master's side, which housed about 50rooms for rent, and the common or poor side, consisting of nine small rooms, or wards, into which 300people were confined from dusk until dawn. Room rents on the master's side were ten shillings a week in 1728, with most prisoners forced to share. John Baptist Grano paid 2s 6d (two shillings and six pennies) for a room with two beds on the master's side, shared with three other prisoners: Daniel Blunt, a tailor who owed £9, Benjamin Sandford, a lighterman from Bermondsey who owed £55, and a Mr. Blundell, a jeweller. Women prisoners who could pay the fees were housed in the women's quarters, known as the oak. The wives, daughters and lovers of male prisoners were allowed to live with them, if <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> paying their way.|$|E
5|$|People were {{purchasing}} bulbs {{at higher}} and higher prices, intending to re-sell them for a profit. However, such a scheme could not last unless <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> ultimately willing to pay such high prices and take possession of the bulbs. In February 1637, tulip traders could no longer find new buyers willing to pay increasingly inflated prices for their bulbs. As this realization set in, the demand for tulips collapsed, and prices plummeted—the speculative bubble burst. Some were left holding contracts to purchase tulips at prices now ten times greater than those on the open market, while others found themselves in possession of bulbs now worth {{a fraction of the}} price they had paid. Mackay claims the Dutch devolved into distressed accusations and recriminations against others in the trade.|$|E

50|$|The {{power to}} stop <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> often {{confused}} {{with the power to}} arrest someone. The power to stop <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> the power of the police to make someone stand still, so that the police can ask for his name and address.|$|R

5|$|Shackleton {{hoped to}} recruit a strong {{contingent}} from the Discovery Expedition and offered his former comrade Edward Wilson {{the post of}} chief scientist and second-in-command. Wilson refused, citing his work with the Board of Agriculture's Committee on the Investigation of Grouse Disease. Further refusals followed from former Discovery colleagues Michael Barne, Reginald Skelton and finally George Mulock, who inadvertently revealed to Shackleton that the Discovery officers had all committed themselves to Scott and his as yet unannounced expedition plans. The only Discovery hands to join Shackleton were the two Petty Officers, Frank Wild and Ernest Joyce. Apparently Shackleton spotted Joyce on the top deck of a bus as it passed the expedition's London offices, whereupon <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> sent to find him and bring him in.|$|E
5|$|Piper {{reported}} {{that as he}} was leaving Exchange Buildings to return to Houndsditch he saw a man acting suspiciously {{in the shadows of the}} cul-de-sac. As the policeman approached him, the man walked away; Piper later described him as being approximately , pale and fair-haired. When Piper reached Houndsditch he saw two policemen from the adjoining beats—constables Woodhams and Choate—who watched 120 Houndsditch and 11 Exchange Buildings while Piper went to the nearby Bishopsgate Police Station to report. By 11:30 seven uniformed and two plain clothes policemen had gathered in the locality, each armed with his wooden truncheon. Sergeant Bentley from Bishopsgate police station knocked at number 11, unaware that Piper had already done so, which alerted the gang. The door was answered by Gardstein, who made no response when Bentley asked if anyone was working there. Bentley asked him to fetch someone who spoke English; Gardstein left the door half-closed and disappeared inside. Bentley entered the hall with Sergeant Bryant and Constable Woodhams; as they could see the bottom of his trouser legs, they soon realised that <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> watching them from the stairs. The police asked the man if they could step into the back of the property, and he agreed. As Bentley moved forward, the back door opened and one of the gang exited, firing from a pistol as he did so; the man on the stairs also began firing. Bentley was shot in the shoulder and the neck—the second round severing his spine. Bryant was shot in the arm and chest and Woodhams was wounded in the leg, which broke his femur; both collapsed. Although they survived, neither Bryant or Woodhams fully recovered from their injuries.|$|E

25|$|Some languages, {{including}} several Southeast Asian languages, use {{a form of}} passive voice to indicate that an action or event was unpleasant or undesirable.
