40|$|Ground anchors are a form {{of ground}} {{improvement}} technique that strengthens and stabilises structures to the surrounding ground, whether it be in soil or rock. Steel strand ground anchors have many advantages when transferring applied loads into the surrounding sub-base; however the environments {{in which they can}} be constructed in are aggressive and can cause corrosion and premature failure of the anchor should they not be adequately protected. Current ground anchor best practices require a complex double protection boundary layer system to encase the bond length, free length and the anchor head and may not guarantee complete protection against corrosion. Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) materials in the construction and infrastructure industry has seen significant interest and development in recent years. Unfortunately these developments have not extended to the ground anchor industry. As such, little is known about material performance under adverse ground anchoring conditions, where exposure to extreme alkaline, acidic or briny environments is not uncommon. This thesis investigated two different types of Carbon Fibre CFRP strands to assess if they are suitable for ground anchor applications and what environments they a can perform safely and successfully unprotected. Absorption, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), spectroscopy and tensile performance tests were conducted in aggressive alkaline and acidic groundwater environments and neutral solution for a period up to six months at elevated temperatures of 30 degrees Celcius and 60 degrees Celcius. These tests were conducted unstressed and stressed. Results showed that although absorption of aggressive environments were observed and localised penetration of the aggressive solution had occurred (without damage or deterioration of the composite structure) the tensile performance of the CFCC product was unaffected by the aggressive ground environments in both a stress-cured or unstressed-cured state. Absorption levels and penetration of aggressive solutions were higher for the HS 25 x 2 material. This penetration showed signs of composite and fibre breakdown over the six months curing. Tensile performance was still efficient, with most results performing better than control results; however, inconsistencies in the tensile results were reported as a result of gripping issues developed during material curing. Ground anchor bond assessment was conducted under confined conditions on a single CFRP strand over various bond lengths, bonded using a standard ground anchor cementitious based grout mixture with no additives. Pull-out tests were conducted on both CFCC and HS 25 x 2 materials. Results identified the minimum bond length required to induce strand rupture for the CFCC specimens was calculated to be 775 mm. No minimum bond length was established for the HS 25 x 2 due to a large scatter and variance in results over the numerous bond lengths tested. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was conducted on the CFCC strand to develop greater understanding of the progressive debonding during axial loading and bond stress distribution along the bonded length of strand. FEA model was able to predict ultimate loads capacity and bond slip prior to failure accurately. FEA model was compared to full scale test results and strong linearity between bond stresses and progressive debonding distribution were identified. No FEA modelling was developed for the HS 25 x 2 product {{as a result of the}} inconsistent bond pull-out results. CFRP anchors are restricted with the methods available to lock the anchor off and the head. Bond type anchor heads are good reliable method for anchorage, but minimum bond length requirements are long and restrictive for ground anchor applications. This project identified the issues with current bond type anchor heads and developed a reliable and compact “modified bond type” anchor head system suitable to CFRP material similar to the profile of CFCC strand. The anchor head was successfully tested on CFCC strand where a four and 10 <b>strand</b> <b>anchor</b> head assessment was conducted. Results from the test identified specimen failure occurred as a result of strand rupture in the bond length and no movement or cracking at the distal end of the anchor head. The success of this anchor head enabled the development of a full scale gun barrel test to be conducted. Using the anchor head technology developed a four strand CFCC gun barrel test was conducted with a 3. 0 meter bond length and 2. 0 m free length. Testing was conducted as per an acceptance test program for steel strand ground anchors with cyclic loading over 10 equal load increments up to proof load of 800 kN. Results showed a linear elastic extension over each load increment. Creep was observed at each cycles peak load (held for 50 minutes). The net anchor extension was a direct result of the creep. There were no signs of strand deformation from the data collected. No strand movement was observed at the anchors distal end, nor any movement, cracking or pull-out of the wires within the anchor head system. Strain gauges mounted along the strands free and bond lengths plotted load and bond stress distribution along the strand throughout the loading process. Bond stress distribution results replicated FEA model results obtained from the single strand bond model. An apparent free length of 3. 5 meters was calculated. Progressive debonding of each strand throughout the test was established. Strain results verified the calculated apparent free length of 3. 5 meters. The research conducted of CFRP strand identified that there are limitations for exposure to aggressive ground environments and bond strengths for selected FRP material. CFRP strand which can be securely anchored (using bond or other methods) and resist aggressive ground environments, such as CFCC, could perform as a permanent ground anchor in an unprotected state for the duration of the anchors design life. Guidelines and standards needs to be urgently developed to assist in designers utilising the knowledge developed in research the superior performance of CFRP strand in aggressive environment compared to steel strand ground anchors...|$|E

40|$|A {{preparation}} of a practically feasible technological design of permanent prestressed <b>strand</b> ground <b>anchors</b> {{with a different}} concept of bond lengths, contained within joint polyethylene cover, is the main idea of this thesis. Anchors with increased stiffness of bond length (RCP/D-K), multiple anchors with staggered anchor units based on Barlay's anchors SBMA, only that all anchor units are placed within common polyethylene cover (RCP/D-Z) and anchors with variable stiffness of bond lengths after the patent of Škrabl (RCP/D-I) have been used. In the thesis description of testings, performed on the testing field of the retaining wall OZ- 05, as well as descriptions of results of behaviour analysis of modified anchor types at investigation tests are given and compared with the behaviour of original RCP/D anchors. The software tool of open design for simultaneous evaluation of anchors' behaviour parameters at investigation tests has been prepared, whereat analysis of the whole anchor, anchor units {{as well as individual}} strands is feasible. The separation of pulled individual <b>strand</b> of an <b>anchor</b> is also possible. For each anchor competent interval creep displacement rates k_int were determined after four different methods. The pull-out resistance R_a of the anchor as a whole has been evaluated with averaging of displacements of all strands, and compared with the sum of pull-out resistances of individual <b>strands</b> of the <b>anchor.</b> Requirements for the definition of the common characteristic pull-out resistance of the productional anchor R_ak are not evidently defined in the valid regulation. Therefore different approaches has been used for the determination of R_ak values, whereat statistical methods and available historical data of numerous investigation tests, performed in the last decade, have been used. Admissible creep displacement rate k_adm for the retaining wall OZ- 05 production anchors has been defined {{on the basis of the}} investigation tests. However, values of k_int for production anchors in practice are not always smaller than k_adm. With the anaylsis of investigation tests results of four anchored structures, carried out in practice, reasons for such behaviour of anchors has been found out. By means of the two types of laboratory testings reasons for high values of creep displacement rates at low force levels of investigation tests has been found out. Investigations of eccentric positions of ring load cell as for anchor tendon on measured forces, as well as investigations of the influence of isothermal relaxation on the behaviour of a strand, have been performed. In both cases of testings the procedure of an investigation test of prestressed ground anchors has been used. For this reason the results of laboratory testings can be directly compared with the results of investigation tests. Guidelines for effective realization of modified types of permanent prestressed <b>strand</b> <b>anchors</b> as well as the proposals for the performance and analysis of investigation tests are suggested in the conclusion of this thesis.

The backbone of this essential process is the assembly of SNAREs from opposite membranes into tight four helix bundles forcing membranes in close proximity. With model systems resembling SNAREs with reduced complexity we aim to understand how these proteins work at the molecular level. Here, peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) are used as excellent candidates for mimicking the SNARE recognition motif by forming well-characterized duplex structures.

Molecular walkers are nano-machines designed for this task- they are structures that can attach {{and move on}} some substrate. There have been several preliminary experiments for DNA walkers. However, none of these walker designs are “programmable”. These walkers either require adding an extra DNA strand for each step of walker movement [3, 4] or just repeat the same action such as moving towards a fixed direction [6, 5] or moving randomly on a two-dimensional surface [1]. Sahu et al. [2] proposed a walker that simulates a restricted class of finite automata. However, not all finite state automata can be implemented in their design.

40|$|Asymmetric {{building}} blocks afford assembly of more complex, sophisticated materials than their homogeneous counterparts. Phase separation of mixed membranes produces asymmetric surface textures in lipid vesicles. Membranes that demix into coexisting liquid phases ripen {{such that the}} vesicle domain morphology exhibits a Janus-like texture. DNA is commonly used in material science as a molecular glue. Hydrophobically modified DNA <b>strands</b> <b>anchor</b> to the membranes of vesicles such that the DNA is free to bind its complement. When DNA amphiphiles are anchored to phase separated vesicles, they thermodynamically partition between coexisting domains. This results in asymmetric surface distributions of adhesive functionalities. We enhance the partitioning of cholesteryl-anchored DNA into liquid ordered (Lo) domains of Janus-like vesicles by incorporating highly unsaturated lipids into membrane mixtures. We find that cardiolipin (CL) drives the strongest enrichment of DNA into Lo domains with apparent surface concentrations at least {{an order of magnitude}} greater than in coexisting liquid disordered domains. We also examine the partitioning of DNA with a lipid-like anchor in Janus-textured vesicles; the inclusion of CL also drives a very strong enhancement into Lo domains. The culmination of this work is the study of superstructures that form when populations of these Janus vesicles, functionalized by complementary DNA strands, are mixed. Unlike their homogeneous counterparts, which can form uncontrollably large clusters, size-limited multicompartmental architectures are observed. The DNA-rich Lo domains saturate in adhesion plaques of the clusters. This predominantly leaves DNA-depleted Lα phase accessible on the exterior surface of these structures, which does not favor binding of further vesicle...|$|R

Specimens with non-conjugated VEGF adsorbed to ODN <b>anchor</b> <b>strands</b> and to blank SAE surfaces served as controls. Specific binding of conjugated VEGF exhibited the highest percentage of immobilised VEGF (71. 0 %), whereas non-conjugated VEGF only achieved 53. 2 and 30. 7 %, respectively. Cumulative release reached 54. 0 % of the immobilised growth factor in the group of specifically bound VEGF after 4 weeks, whereas non-conjugated VEGF adsorbed to ODN strands released 78. 9 % and VEGF adsorbed to SAE Ti surfaces released 97. 4 %. Proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was significantly increased on the surfaces with specifically bound VEGF compared to the control surfaces and SAE Ti surfaces without VEGF. Moreover, the released conjugated VEGF exhibited biological activity by induction of von Willebrand Factor (vWF) in mesenchymal stem cells. It is concluded that the angiogenic functionalisation of SAE titanium surfaces can be achieved by conjugation of VEGF to ODN strands and hybridisation to complementary ODN <b>strands</b> that are <b>anchored</b> to the titanium surface.

40|$|Membrane fusion is {{essential}} for nerve-cell communication, for protein transport between cell organelles and the cell-membrane and for enabling the merger between virus and host membranes during virus infection. We have demonstrated that short DNA oligonucleotides, membrane-attached via CH in an orientation that mimics the overall zipperlike architecture of fusion-inducing proteins, induce fusion of both suspended vesicles and vesicles site-specifically tethered to SLBs. The site-specific surface-based assay is attractive for membrane-protein array applications. Model systems for membrane fusion have been generated from lipid vesicles, which are artificial spherical cell membranes encapsulating liquid compartments. In the bulk assay, two vesicle populations were decorated with complementary DNA strands which hybridize in a zipper-like fashion to bring about membrane fusion. The DNA <b>strands</b> were <b>anchored</b> in the lipid membranes of the vesicles via a hydrophobic moiety, cholesterol (CH), covalently attached {{at one end of}} the DNA strands. The lipid rearrangements taking place as a consequence of the forced bilayer contact and subsequent fusion were investigated using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between donor and acceptor dyes. Total lipid mixing, inner leaflet mixing as well as content mixing was monitored. In order to design a DNA zipper with improved fusion properties, we have assessed how parameters such as length of the DNA <b>strands,</b> <b>anchoring</b> strategy and DNA surface coverage affect the ability of DNA to induce fusion. The results reveal that the use of two CH anchors {{is essential}} to prevent complementary DNA strands from shuttling between differently modified lipid vesicles. A surface coverage of 6 - 13 DNA strands per lipid vesicle was a precondition for efficient fusion, whereas fusion was insensitive to DNA length within the tested range. Implementation of the DNA-controlled fusion concept into a site-specific surface-based assay, by fusing the vesicles to a SLB, brings the concept towards site-specific delivery of membrane constituents and thus further towards the realization of a protein array bio-sensor. The geometry of the surface-based system resembles that of native vesicles fusing with the cell membrane better than do the vesicle-vesicle fusion assay. The surface-based fusion assay also provides details and heterogeneities of the fusing vesicle population, as it allowed us to study single vesicle fusion events. From the results we learn that fusion is observed for a specific range of 10 - 16 DNA strands per vesicle, and from studies of the diffusion of the tethered vesicles prior to fusion, together with the vesicle docking time prior to fusion, a possible scenario for the zipper-DNA induced vesicle-SLB fusion machinery is proposed. Future applications and upcoming projects are also discussed...|$|R

The blocks were thereafter transferred to a critical-point drying apparatus, via steps of increased gradients up to 100 % amyl acetate. By this method five different gonococcal colony types could be distinguished analogous to light microscopic observations made by others. At higher magnifications an abundance of intercellular strands {{was found between the}} cells in virulent type 1 and 2 colonies, but not in the avirulent types 3 through 5. These <b>strands</b> seemed to <b>anchor</b> the cells {{to each other and to}} the agar surface. The presence of such structures probably explains the highly convex surface of virulent colonies and explains why colonies of avirulent strains exhibit a radial extension and a flat upper surface. The nature of these filamentous intercellular strands is discussed...|$|R
40|$|This {{pedagogical}} portfolio {{presents a}} curriculum {{designed specifically for}} fifth through twelfth grade English Language Arts students. Story Circle is a writing program dedicated to encouraging students to find their authentic voices through storytelling. While participating in Story Circle, students engage in meaningful interactive games, answer thought-provoking prompts using both oral and written activities, and build a motivational and stimulating community environment. As speakers, they tell their unique story and learn to command their powerful individual voice. As active listeners, they practice concentration skills and reinforce each other's ability to communicate. Story Circle cultivates a meaningful education by providing learning objectives such as connection, empathy, respect, compassion, and diversity. The framework for student's academic learning outcomes in this project follows the Common Core <b>Anchor</b> <b>Strands.</b> The basis for success depends upon connections students make when linking the literary themes discussed in the instructional classroom with their own personal stories in Story Circle...|$|R
50|$|Martineau {{was closely}} {{associated}} with George Birkbeck and the London Mechanics' Institution. He attended the meeting in early November 1823 at the Crown and <b>Anchor,</b> <b>Strand,</b> attended by about 50 people, representing with Bryan Donkin and Alexander Galloway employers {{with an interest in}} technical training of their staff. He {{was a member of the}} Provisional Committee of 15, with Richard Taylor, brother of Philip. After the mass meeting at the Crown and Anchor on 11 November, there followed a tense and confrontational meeting of 22 November at which the question of subscriptions to the Institution was debated. Joseph Clinton Robertson and Thomas Hodgskin argued the case for rejecting outside subscription, on the grounds that the autonomy of the mechanics to run their own affairs would be limited by accepting the money. They were supported by the architect Robert McWilliam. Martineau and Taylor sided with Birkbeck and Francis Place, in backing the subscription scheme brought forward by William Bayley, which was carried.|$|R
40|$|A central {{tenet of}} {{molecular}} biology {{holds that the}} function of a protein is mediated by its structure. An inactive ground-state conformation may nonetheless be enjoined by the interplay of competing biological constraints. A model is provided by insulin, well characterized at atomic resolution by x-ray crystallography. Here, we demonstrate that {{the activity of the}} hormone is enhanced by stereospecific unfolding of a conserved structural element. A bifunctional β-strand mediates both self-assembly (within β-cell storage vesicles) and receptor binding (in the bloodstream). This <b>strand</b> is <b>anchored</b> by an invariant side chain (PheB 24); its substitution by Ala leads to an unstable but native-like analog of low activity. Substitution by d-Ala is equally destabilizing, and yet the protein diastereomer exhibits enhanced activity with segmental unfolding of the β-strand. Corresponding photoactivable derivatives (containing l- or d-para-azido-Phe) cross-link to the insulin receptor with higher d-specific efficiency. Aberrant exposure of hydrophobic surfaces in the analogs is associated with accelerated fibrillation, a form of aggregation-coupled misfolding associated with cellular toxicity. Conservation of PheB 24, enforced by its dual role in native self-assembly and induced fit, thus highlights the implicit role of misfolding as an evolutionary constraint. Whereas classical crystal structures of insulin depict its storage form, signaling requires engagement of a detachable arm at an extended receptor interface. Because this active conformation resembles an amyloidogenic intermediate, we envisage that induced fit and self-assembly represent complementary molecular adaptations to potential proteotoxicity. The cryptic threat of misfolding poses a universal constraint in the evolution of polypeptide sequences...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBasal keratinocytes {{attach to}} the {{underlying}} dermal stroma through an ultrastructurally unique and complex basement membrane zone. Electron-dense plaques along the basal surface plasma membrane, termed hemidesmosomes, appear to attach directly to the lamina densa of the basement membrane through fine <b>strands,</b> called <b>anchoring</b> filaments. The lamina densa is secured to the stroma through a complex of type VII collagen containing anchoring fibrils and anchoring plaques. We have identified what we believe is a novel antigen unique to this tissue region. The mAbs to this antigen localize to the anchoring filaments, just below the basal-dense plate of the hemidesmosomes. In cell culture, the antigen is deposited upon the culture substate by growing and migrating human keratinocytes. Addition of mAb to the cultures causes the cells to round and detach, but does not impair them metabolically. Skin fragments incubated with antibody extensively de-epithelialize. These findings strongly suggest that this antigen is intimately involved in attachment of keratinocytes to the basement membrane. This antigen was isolated from keratinocyte cultures by immunoaffinity chromatography. Two molecules are observed. The most intact species contains three nonidentical chains, 165, 155, and 140 kD linked by interchain disulfide bonds. The second and more abundant species contains the 165 - and 140 -kD chains, but the 155 -kD chain has been proteolytically cleaved to 105 kD. Likewise, two rotary-shadowed images are observed. The larger of the two, presumably corresponding to the most intact form, appears as an asymmetric 107 -nm-long rod, with a single globule {{at one end and}} two smaller globules at the other. The more abundant species, presumably the proteolytically cleaved form, lacks the distal small globule. We propose the name "kalinin" for this new molecule.
