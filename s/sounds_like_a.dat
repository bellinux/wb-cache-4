5|$|A noisy species, {{the female}} has the deep quack stereotypically {{associated}} with ducks. Male mallards {{make a sound}} phonetically {{similar to that of}} the female, a typical quack, but it is a deep and raspy and can also sound like breeeeze. When incubating a nest, or when offspring are present, females vocalise differently, making a call that <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> truncated version of the usual quack. They hiss if the nest or offspring are threatened or interfered with. When taking off, the wings of a mallard produce a characteristic faint whistling noise.|$|E
5|$|The {{black stork}} has {{a wider range}} of calls than the white stork, its main call being a chee leee, which <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> loud inhalation. It makes a hissing call as a warning or threat. Displaying males produce a long series of wheezy raptor-like {{squealing}} calls rising in volume and then falling. It rarely indulges in mutual bill-clattering when adults meet at the nest. Adults will do so as part of their mating ritual or when angered. The young clatter their bills when aroused.|$|E
5|$|In a B plot, Andy (Chris Pratt) {{is doing}} well in his new job as the Pawnee shoeshiner, and Ron pays for a shine. Ron is {{impressed}} when Andy actually eases the pain from his bunion, and he later purposely scuffs his shoe {{so he can get}} a second shine. Andy is initially flattered, but starts to grow uncomfortable when Ron returns for a third shoeshine. This time, Ron makes an involuntary noise that <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> sexual moan, seriously embarrassing both men. After a day of avoiding each other, Ron and Andy discuss the noise and decide {{it would be best to}} simply pretend it never happened.|$|E

5|$|Stewie is {{in terrible}} pain from {{teething}} and cannot find comfort anywhere. When his mother Lois {{tells him that}} his pain will ultimately pass, it gives him the idea to build a machine that will move time forward {{to the point where}} his teething will have already stopped. Meanwhile, Lois tells Peter to drive their other son Chris to his soccer match, then come right back to look after Stewie. However, Peter's friend Quagmire is there, and has brought beer, so Peter decides to ignore Lois and stay at the game. While there, another member of the crowd insults Chris. Enraged, Peter punches this person in the face, only to discover that it is a pregnant woman who looks and <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> man.|$|E

25|$|It was {{revealed}} by Matthew Reilly that the Black Knight {{was meant to}} be a dark double to Scarecrow; he also has an eye problem and has had his disagreements with the US government. This is even mentioned in the book, when Mother (upon hearing his biography) remarks that he <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Shane Schofield gone wrong.|$|E

5000|$|Jay Osmond said, [...] "The {{song was}} {{recorded}} at MGM in Hollywood and we added that distinctive “Wah! Wah!” intro sound afterwards.

25|$|Willy DeVille's Backstreets of Desire stands tall as his {{masterpiece}} as both {{a singer}} and a songwriter. DeVille's considerable reputation in Paris buoyed him up to make this disc... With guest spots by Dr. John, Zachary Richard, and David Hidalgo, DeVille creates a tapestry of roots rock and Crescent City second line, traces of 1950s doo-wop, and elegant sweeping vistas of Spanish soul balladry, combined with lyrics full of busted-down heroes, hungry lovers, and wise men trying {{to get off the}} street. The sound of the album balances Creole soul and pure rock pyrotechnics. DeVille <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> man resurrected, digging as deep as the cavernous recesses of the human heart.|$|E
25|$|Stereotypical pirate accents are {{modeled on}} those of Cornwall, South Devon or the Bristol Channel area in South West England, though {{they can also}} be based on Elizabethan era English or other parts of the world. Pirates in film, {{television}} and theatre are generally depicted as speaking English in a particular accent and speech pattern that <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> stylized West Country accent, exemplified by Robert Newton's performance as Long John Silver in the 1950 film Treasure Island. A native of the West Country in south west England from where many famous English pirates hailed, Newton also used the same strong West Country accent in Blackbeard the Pirate (1952).|$|E
25|$|A {{very rare}} form {{includes}} the diaphragmatic flutter, the Belly Dancer's Syndrome, or Van Leeuwenhoek's disease. It was first described by Antony van Leeuwenhoek in 1723, {{who suffered from}} it. The condition characterizes spoken communication that <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> short-breathed hiccup. These muscle spasms can recur dozens of times per day. Rate of diaphragmatic contraction ranges between 35 and 480 contractions per minute, with the average rate found to be 150. Studies show that possible causes include disruptions within the central or peripheral nervous systems, anxiety, nutritional disorder, and certain pharmaceuticals. No single treatment has proven effective, though blocking or crushing of the phrenic nerve can provide instantaneous relief when pharmacologic treatment has proven ineffective.|$|E

25|$|The boat {{is first}} {{directly}} addressed in chapter 43; there Gangleri asks that, if Skíðblaðnir {{is the best}} of ships, what {{there is to know about}} it, and asks if there is no other ship as good or as large as it. High responds that while Skíðblaðnir is the finest ship and the most ingeniously created, the biggest ship is in fact Naglfar, which is owned by Muspell. The Sons of Ivaldi, who High adds are dwarfs, crafted the ship and gave it to Freyr. High continues that the ship is big enough for all of the gods to travel aboard it with wargear and weapons in tow, and that, as soon as its sail is hoisted, the ship finds good wind, and goes wherever it need be. It is made up of so many parts and with such craftsmanship that, when it is not needed at sea, it may be folded up like cloth and placed into one's pocket. Gangleri comments that Skíðblaðnir <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> great ship, and that it must have taken a lot of magic to create something like it.|$|E
25|$|The Barranca Arroyo {{is a small}} canyon {{structure}} {{about an}} hour and a half from the municipal seat. The water flows year round with several areas where it pools, but the water is cold. The area is surrounded by large mountains with abundant vegetation. There is camping, hiking and picnicking. The Peña de la Viuda is a natural monolith which falls directly into an arroyo. The area has abundant vegetation, and activities such as skiing, camping and hiking. La Escondida is an area in mountainous forest with a permanent fresh water spring. It permits camping and hiking. El Cidral is an area with cedar trees surrounding a clearing for camping and hiking. The Peña de la Glora waterfall is surrounded by thick vegetation. The lowest part has a natural spring and the upper part has a deep, unexplored cave. The Cueva de los Riscos (Cave of the Crags) is named after the crags which appear in various of its chambers. The entrance begins with a rocky descent then levels out to an area with sand. The center has a hillock with looks like a monolith rock. This can be climbed to observe the various crags with contain ice. One of these in the shape of a pulpit and another is called the “bell tower” because if it is struck it <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bell.|$|E

[...] Jon Caramainca of The New York Times wrote that the production of [...] "Party" [...] recalls the early work of New Edition. James Reed of The Boston Globe commented that its music arrangement <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> parody by The Lonely Island or Flight of the Conchords. Roberts Randall of the Los Angeles Times found that [...] "Party" [...] <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> half-speed remix of a Human League song, and Kevin O'Donnell of Spin magazine found the song to be reminiscent of Prince in his 1980s prime.

500|$|Musically, {{the album}} is more {{electronic}} and beat-driven than preceding releases, with reviewers commenting that its sound is at times reminiscent of KMFDM. This {{has been attributed to}} Sköld, {{who was a member of}} that band immediately prior to his arrival in Marilyn Manson. It is also not as metallic as their earlier work, with Manson explaining to MTV that he wanted to create music which was dissimilar to the nu metal being played on radio at the time. He also noted the influence of early industrial rock acts such as Ministry, Big Black and Nitzer Ebb on the material. Early twentieth-century German composer Kurt Weill was also claimed as an influence, along with the lucid dreams Manson was having during the album's production, elaborating that he would [...] "wake up and say, 'I want to write a song that <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> stampeding elephant' or 'I want to write a song that <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> burning piano'." ...|$|E

According to Entertainment Weeklys Evan Serpick: [...] "Along with recent success stories like System of a Down and up-and-comers like the Dillinger Escape Plan, Lightning Bolt, and Coheed and Cambria, the Mars Volta create incredibly complex and inventive music that <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> heavier, more aggressive version of ’70s behemoths such as Led Zeppelin and King Crimson." ...|$|E

500|$|Chris Willman of the Los Angeles Times gave an {{unfavorable}} review. Although sex in popular music {{is considered a}} standard concept, Willman states the only reason the album would cause a reaction is because of Jackson's well-known conservative nature. He comments: [...] "So be it. Jackson's first album in four years is destined for a long ride at No. 1, not because it's any great piece of work, but largely for its aphrodisiacal aspirations." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly stated that [...] "f musical variety and daring lyrics were all that mattered, Janet would make the grade. But the album {{has a lot to}} prove. It is the first delivery under her $40 million contract with Virgin, and its title—which translates as 'Janet, period'—is meant as a declaration of independence from her oddball siblings... She still <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> young woman from a male-dominated family who is searching for her identity and voice. Mostly, though, Janet <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> mess—period." [...] David Sinclair of The Times wrote: [...] "In the steamy, post-Madonna climate of the 1990s, Jackson is not about to let thoughts of love {{get in the way of}} the mechanics of lust, and like many of her superstar contemporaries she tends to confuse sex with soul." ...|$|E
