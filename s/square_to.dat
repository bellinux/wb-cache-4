5|$|Soule was {{promptly}} given the task by <b>Square</b> <b>to</b> score Secret of Evermore. The finished game features an untraditional score incorporating ambient background sounds (like wind blowing and ocean waves) {{into the music}} and utilizing a more mellow orchestral sound. Part {{of the reason for}} this was that the sound program used in Evermore was not up to the technical challenge of what Soule wanted to do with it, forcing him to work creatively within his limitations. When Ron Gilbert of LucasArts left to form his own company, Humongous Entertainment, and Square moved from Seattle to Los Angeles, Soule quit <b>Square</b> <b>to</b> score Gilbert's children's adventure game series, Putt-Putt; he was the company's third employee. Soule composed the soundtracks to 11 children's games over the next three years, with multiple titles in the Putt-Putt, Pajama Sam, Freddi Fish and Spy Fox series.|$|E
