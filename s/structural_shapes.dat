In the first one, the <b>structural</b> <b>shape</b> is optimized by simulating the growth process of natural structures.

The proposed approach, called Morphologic Evolutionary Structural Optimization (MESO), combines these two design paradigms and leads to optimize simultaneously <b>structural</b> <b>shape</b> and <b>structural</b> topology. The extension of the proposed procedure to evolutionary optimization of non-homogeneous structures is also presented. The effectiveness of the procedure is shown through applications...|$|R

For instance, the wing structural weight and elastic deformations couple to aerodynamic loads and aircraft performance through drag.

Decomposition methods for optimization and sensitivity analysis allow the specialized disciplinary methods to be used while the disciplines are temporarily decoupled, after which the interdisciplinary couplings are restored at the system level. Application of decomposition methods to structures-aerodynamics coupling in aircraft is outlined and illustrated with a numerical example of a transport aircraft.
