25|$|Its {{first case}} {{did not occur}} until early in the Court's third term, with West v. Barnes (1791). The Court had an early {{opportunity}} to establish the principle of judicial review in the United States with the case, which involved a Rhode Island state statute permitting the lodging of a debt payment in paper currency. Instead of grappling with {{the constitutionality of the}} law, however, the Court unanimously decided the case on procedural grounds, strictly interpreting <b>statutory</b> <b>requirements.</b>|$|E

25|$|As {{there are}} no further <b>statutory</b> <b>requirements</b> in {{relation}} to the flag, the Department of the Taoiseach takes general responsibility over matters relating to the flag. In its advisory role, the Department has issued guidelines to assist persons in their use of the national flag. The flag should be rectangular in shape and its length should be two times its width, translating into an aspect ratio of 1:2. The three coloured pales— green, white and orange— should be of equal size, and vertically disposed.|$|E
25|$|The Department of the Taoiseach {{has issued}} {{guidelines}} to assist persons in giving {{due respect to}} the national flag.

The Department has general responsibility in relation to the national flag and this is primarily concerned with the protocol for the flying of the flag. The Department's role, therefore, is an advisory one.|$|E

The senate has around 100 members and meets {{at least four times}} a year and advises on areas such as student entry, assessment and awards.

The Senate in turn reports to the Council, which is the supreme governing body of the university, setting strategic direction, ensuring compliance with <b>statutory</b> <b>requirements</b> and approving constitutional changes. The Council meets four times a year, and comprises a broad representation of lay members drawn from commercial, community and professional organisations.|$|E

25|$|In 2005 {{the school}} was criticised in the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted) report for lacking 'a daily act of {{collective}} worship' and not reporting pupils' ICT progress in years 10 and 11, {{both of which are}} <b>statutory</b> <b>requirements.</b> All maintained English schools must provide daily worship that is broadly Christian, although parents can remove their children and sixth formers may decline to attend. Since the school is now an academy (not a maintained school) this requirement does not necessarily apply. The report also found that not all subject department heads have good enough monitoring systems {{to improve the quality of}} teaching and learning.|$|E
25|$|Freedom Passes are {{generally}} issued {{on what is}} in technical terms an Oyster card, though it does not bear that name. Freedom passes are free travel passes available to Greater London residents who are over a specified age (60 until March 2010, increasing in phases to 66 from March 2020) or with a disability specified in the Transport Act 2000; individual London boroughs have exceptional discretion to issue Freedom Passes to disabled {{people who do not}} meet the national <b>statutory</b> <b>requirements</b> (though they have to fund them). Travel is free at all times on the Tube, DLR, buses and Tramlink, and after 09:30 on most National Rail journeys entirely within the Greater London boundary. Holders cannot put any money or ticket products on a Freedom Pass; to travel outside these times, a separate Oyster card or other valid ticket is required.|$|E

[...] Congressman Vito Marcantonio, who opposed the war in Korea, argued that [...] "when we agreed to the United Nations Charter we never agreed to supplant our Constitution with the United Nations Charter.

2500|$|In {{light of}} Ex Parte Lundgren, the USPTO has issued interim {{guidelines}} for patent examiners {{to determine if}} a given claimed invention meets the <b>statutory</b> <b>requirements</b> of being a process, manufacture, composition of matter or machine (35 USC 101). These guidelines assert that a process, including a process for doing business, must produce a concrete, useful and tangible result in order to be patentable. [...] It does not matter if the process is within the traditional technological arts or not. [...] A price for a financial product, for example, {{is considered to be a}} concrete useful and tangible result (see State Street Bank v. Signature Financial Group).|$|E

50|$|Original {{plans for}} the (Weetumuw Wôpanâak) Charter School with plans to open in August 2015 were shelved citing {{inability}} to meet the <b>statutory</b> <b>requirement</b> to serve students in the lowest tenth percentile of MCAS scores. According to Jennifer Weston, who serves as the Immersion School Developer and as the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe Language Department Director, stated, 'Since we didn't meet that <b>statutory</b> <b>requirement,</b> our application's fate rested on two other groups being approved first.' The decision was also influenced by the conflicting political climate, with Republican Governor Charlie Baker's proposal to lift the cap on charter schools and a bill popular with teacher's unions and public opinion hoping for a moratorium.|$|R

[...] It {{identified a number of}} specific findings, among them that the IRB had approved research without ensuring risk to patients was minimized, had failed to prepare required written procedures or retain required documentation, and had failed to conduct required continuing reviews for studies, among others. [...] The Institute was given fifteen days to identify the steps it would take to prevent future violations.|$|E
2500|$|For many years, the USPTO {{took the}} {{position}} that [...] "methods of doing business" [...] were not patentable. [...] With the emergence in the 1980s and 1990s of patent applications on internet or computer enabled methods of doing commerce, however, USPTO {{found that it was}} no longer practical to determine if a particular computer implemented invention was a technological invention or a business invention. [...] Consequently, they took {{the position that}} examiners would not have to determine if a claimed invention was a method of doing business or not. [...] They would determine patentability based on the same <b>statutory</b> <b>requirements</b> as any other invention.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "waiver" [...] {{is used to}} {{describe}} these programs as they waive traditional Medicaid <b>statutory</b> <b>requirements</b> regarding the setting in which long-term care services are provided. [...] The enactment of these waiver programs ushered in a major paradigm shift for the long-term care industry and the individuals served by these programs. The goal of waivers {{is to improve the}} quality of life of those receiving long-term care. The mission of such waivers is [...] "to live in the most integrated community setting appropriate to individual support requirements and preferences." [...] Since enactment, many individuals living in institutional settings have transitioned back into the community. Today, HCBS programs represent the preferred method of services delivery rather than institutionalization.|$|E
