[...] And the singing, the organ, the Queen, just everything and everybody. [...] It's really been out of this world. [...] Just to hear Zadok the Priest, I think, has lifted me to Cloud Nine, because it's something that I love. [...] And to hear that and to have the Queen pass so close to me.

When given another opportunity to answer the same question, <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> and said, [...] "My family is my inspiration".|$|E

The press came to refer to the three, who made numerous joint public appearances, as the [...] "Movement widows". Evers-Williams and King were frequent guests at Medgar Evers College, and Shabazz occasionally visited the King Center in Atlanta. Writing about Shabazz, Evers-Williams described her as a [...] "free spirit, in the best sense of the word. When she laughed, she had this beauty; when <b>she</b> <b>smiled,</b> it lit up the whole room." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{the role}} was being cast, actress Annabeth Gish {{received}} a call from her agent, who informed her that the producers of The X-Files were looking for a new female character. Gish applied for the part, but her audition consisted of a meeting with writers Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz. Spotnitz considered Reyes to be like Mulder in her optimism, faith and enjoyment of being open to beliefs, while still being somewhat different as she was more spiritual and subscribed to a more New Age-like view than Mulder had. Reyes was seen as different from both Mulder and the other main characters as she was somewhat more neurotic, scattered, and quirky. <b>She</b> <b>smiled</b> and laughed more than the other characters, having a nature that writer Frank Spotnitz felt was lighter, sunnier, brighter, warmer and more [...] "overtly sexy".|$|E
500|$|Alexandra {{undertook}} {{many public}} duties; {{in the words}} of Queen Victoria, [...] "to spare me the strain and fatigue of functions. She opens bazaars, attends concerts, visits hospitals in my place... she not only never complains, but endeavours to prove that she has enjoyed what to another would be a tiresome duty." [...] She took a particular interest in the London Hospital, visiting it regularly. Joseph Merrick, the so-called [...] "Elephant Man", was one of the patients whom she met. Crowds usually cheered Alexandra rapturously, but during a visit to Ireland in 1885, she suffered a rare moment of public hostility when visiting the City of Cork, a hotbed of Irish nationalism. She and her husband were booed by a crowd of two to three thousand people brandishing sticks and black flags. <b>She</b> <b>smiled</b> her way through the ordeal, which the British press still portrayed in a positive light, describing the crowds as [...] "enthusiastic". As part of the same visit, she received a Doctorate in Music from Trinity College, Dublin.|$|E

500|$|Little {{was heard}} from Katsura {{for many years}} after the 1961 world championship. McGoorty lamented her retirement, stating various {{theories}} {{that he had heard}} bandied about in billiard circles, such as that her husband (who died in June 1967) kept her from playing for various reasons. In 1976 Katsura made an impromptu appearance at Palace Billiards in San Francisco. She borrowed a cue from someone present and proceeded to run 100 points at straight rail without problem. Prolific pool and billiard author Robert Byrne wrote that after Katsura finished that 100-point run, [...] "without a miss <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> and bowed to the applauding crowd, stepping away from the spotlight, and disappeared forever from the American billiard stage." [...] Katsura returned to Japan in or about 1990 to live with her sister, Noriko, where she said she planned to live out her days. Katsura died in 1995. In September 2002 a memorial tournament for Katsura, billed as Katsura Memorial: The First Ladies Three Cushion Grandprix, was held in Japan and aired on SKY PerfecTV! ...|$|E
500|$|Critics commented {{positively}} on {{the development}} of Will and Emma's relationship; TV Guide Natalie Abrams wrote that she had been waiting for them to kiss since the pilot episode. Flandez felt that the kiss made the [...] "poignant moment" [...] of the glee club's final performance [...] "even more dear", and hoped {{that it would not be}} the last between them, while Aly Semigran of MTV praised the development and called the kiss [...] "sweet [...] longing". Goldman wrote: [...] "Schue and Emma finally coming together was very hard to not feel good about, even though you know it just won't be that easy when the show returns". Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times opined that it was clear Ken and Emma would not marry, and added that when Will kissed Emma: [...] "I died". In discussing Will and Emma's conversation about how she would have left Ken if Will had shown any interest in her, Pardue commented: [...] "That's maybe the sweetest and the saddest thing I've ever heard." [...] She called the kiss between Will and Emma [...] "romantic" [...] commenting that it made her [...] "heart happy". Entertainment Weekly Dan Snierson commented that although there was satisfaction in the episode ending on the kiss, it may have been [...] "more intriguing" [...] to conclude with Will finding Emma's office empty, or [...] "before <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> approvingly after their kiss", questioning whether it was too soon for the two of them to begin a relationship, or [...] "about freakin' time".|$|E
500|$|Simon Price from The Independent {{said that}} the tour [...] "is a triumph of hydraulics, bungee rope {{acrobatics}} and cutting-edge choreography." [...] However, {{he felt that the}} setlist consisting of mainly current songs implied that Madonna was doing [...] "a paranoid attempt to frame herself as part of the present and not the past? The irony here is that, given the ever-decreasing spirals of pop revivalism, in order to be truly contemporary, rather than eschewing her past, Madonna would need to be ripping herself off circa 1984." [...] John McAlley from Entertainment Weekly commented that the music was [...] "loud, energetic, well-sung, and perhaps a little too often beside the point" [...] and that [...] " [...] struggle to rise above its [...] theatrics." [...] He added that one will be [...] "awed by Madonna's palpable life force and intelligence. [...] There are plenty of reasons to bow at this artist's feat." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times said that [...] "through the concert, Madonna made a display of arrogance, tossing off profanities, striking tough postures and glaring more often than <b>she</b> <b>smiled.</b> She represents self-love backed by plenty of gym time and a whole troupe of devoted flunkies, all laboring to delight an audience she only seems to disdain. Music makes the people come together, she sang in the finaleâ€“ together, that is, if Madonna is clearly in charge." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian felt that [...] "with its perfect dance routines, special effects, devoted audience and hint of bullish arrogance, the Drowned World show befits the world's most famous woman." ...|$|E

500|$|At Fotheringhay on {{the evening}} of 7 February 1587, Mary was told that she was to be {{executed}} the next morning. She spent the last hours of her life in prayer, distributing her belongings to her household, and writing her will and a letter to the King of France. The scaffold that was erected in the Great Hall was two feet high and draped in black. It was reached by two or three steps and furnished with the block, a cushion for her to kneel on and three stools, for her and the earls of Shrewsbury and Kent, who were there to witness the execution. The executioners (one named Bull and his assistant) knelt before her and asked forgiveness, as it was typical for the executioner to ask the pardon of the one being put to death. She replied, [...] "I forgive you with all my heart, for now, I hope, you shall make an end of all my troubles." [...] Her servants, Jane Kennedy and Elizabeth Curle, and the executioners helped Mary to remove her outer garments, revealing a velvet petticoat and a pair of sleeves in crimson-brown, the liturgical colour of martyrdom in the Catholic Church, with a black satin bodice and black trimmings. As she disrobed <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> and said that she [...] "never had such grooms before... nor ever put off her clothes before such a company". She was blindfolded by Kennedy with a white veil embroidered in gold, knelt down on the cushion in front of the block, on which she positioned her head, and stretched out her arms. Her last words were, [...] "In manus tuas, Domine, commendo spiritum meum" [...] ("Into thy hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit").|$|E

2500|$|Her {{audition}} process {{consisted of}} two readings for the producers, before Ryan was asked {{to come in to}} talk through the part with the executive producers, Jeri Taylor, Rick Berman and Brannon Braga. Following this, she tested for the network and was told that her option had been picked up. She remarked of her experience of joining the team on Voyager, [...] "It was a little awkward since the cast had been together for three years already. And one of the original characters was being written out pretty much at the same time I was being added. But the cast was terrific, and very welcoming." [...] Although she wore extensive make-up for her first appearances, including an eye-piece that fell off when <b>she</b> <b>smiled,</b> her typical make-up regime took around 45 minutes, with the attachment of the Borg appliance above her eye taking an additional 15 minutes. Her hairstyling usually took as long as that combined.|$|E

2500|$|With Democrats facing {{possible}} large {{losses in}} the 2010 midterm elections and President Obama struggling in opinion polls, idle speculation in Washington media circles concerning Obama's chances in the 2012 presidential election led {{to the notion that}} Clinton would take over as Obama's vice-presidential running mate in 2012 to add to his electoral appeal. Some versions of this idea had Vice President Biden replacing her as Secretary of State if Obama won. That it would ever happen was unlikely, but did not stop the chatter; when the job swap idea was mentioned in public to Clinton, <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> and shook her head. A couple of months later, Obama shot down the idea, saying the notion was [...] "completely unfounded" [...] and that [...] "they are both doing outstanding jobs where they are." [...] (In late 2011, however, with Obama's popularity on the decline, White House Chief of Staff William M. Daley did conduct some research into the idea of Clinton replacing Biden, but the notion was dropped when the results showed no appreciable improvement for Obama.) ...|$|E
2500|$|After school Evans would {{entertain}} {{customers at}} his various jobs, including Fresh Farm Poultry in the Italian Market on Ninth Street {{and at the}} Produce Market, with songs and jokes. It was his boss at the Produce Market, Tony A., who gave Evans the nickname [...] "Chubby". The store owner of Fresh Farm Poultry, Henry Colt, was so impressed by Ernest's performances for the customers that he, along with his colleague and friend Kal Mann, {{who worked as a}} songwriter for Cameo-Parkway Records, arranged for young Chubby to do a private recording for American Bandstand host Dick Clark. It was at this recording session that Evans got his stage name from Clark's wife, who asked Evans what his name was. [...] "Well", he replied, [...] "my friends call me 'Chubby'". As he had just completed a Fats Domino impression, <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> and said, [...] "As in Checker?" [...] That little play on words ("chubby" [...] describing a degree of fatness and [...] "checkers" [...] being, like [...] "dominoes", a game) got an instant laugh, and stuck: from then on, Evans would use the name [...] "Chubby Checker".|$|E
2500|$|MacDonald {{suffered}} in her later years with heart trouble. She worsened in 1963 and underwent an arterial transplant at Methodist Hospital in Houston, Texas. [...] She had been signed {{to play the}} role of the Mother Abbess in the film version of The Sound of Music, but died before she could fulfill this commitment (the role went to Peggy Wood). [...] Nelson Eddy, in Australia on a nightclub tour, pleaded illness and returned to the States at word of MacDonald's surgery. [...] After the operation, she developed pleurisy and was hospitalized for two-and-a-half months. [...] Her friends kept the news from the press until just before her release. [...] Her large home was sold and she moved into a Los Angeles apartment that would not require so much of her energies. [...] Her husband moved into an adjoining apartment. Nelson Eddy took his own apartment in the opposite building. MacDonald was again stricken in 1964. Nelson Eddy was with her when she was admitted to UCLA Medical Center, where on Christmas Eve, she was operated on for abdominal adhesions. She was able to go home for New Year's, but in mid-January, husband Raymond flew her back to Houston. It was hoped that pioneer heart surgeon Dr. Michael DeBakey, who had recently operated successfully on the Duke of Windsor, could perform the same miracle for her. She checked in on January 12, and a program of intravenous feedings was begun to build her up for possible surgery. MacDonald died two days later on January 14 at 4:32 pm, with her husband at her bedside. According to press reports, MacDonald's last words to Raymond while he massaged her feet were [...] "I love you". [...] He replied [...] "I love you, too"; <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> and succumbed.|$|E

2500|$|Wray {{was also}} a member {{of one of the most}} famous B-movie units at work during what is now viewed as the 'Golden Age' of Hollywood -- a group whose {{creative}} energy and inventiveness made Lewton's success possible. She spoke about working with the group in a conversation with her daughter many years later, a recollection that shines a clear light on the group's chemistry and skill, and the special place it held in Wray's heart:She rarely spoke about her early career or the McCarthy era. [...] But when I asked once what it was like working with Lewton, <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> -- thought about it for a long moment -- and then told me about the night the group spent figuring out how to build to the first murder in The Leopard Man. [...] The scene she had written was pure psychological terror, trading on very basic fears -- of the dark, of being punished unjustly, locked out of your own home, abandoned by people you trust -- and at the same time it sets up the mystery that is the premise of the entire film. [...] They were under pressure to get this sequence right, and almost everyone was there that night. The session went well into the small hours of the morning, was filled with laughter, and included a hilarious riff as one of them experimented with a set of castanets, which turned out to be the key to building the tension and suspense. They worked their way through a dozen different shot sequences before they were satisfied and, listening to her, I had the very strong impression that they would have come up with that same elegant, powerful scene even if they had been working with an A-movie budget and had more time. [...] As Agee so famously observed about Lewton, these were people who understood film and cared about human beings. [...] I can still see the smile on her face as she recalled that night. [...] -- Stefani Warren, September 2016 ...|$|E
