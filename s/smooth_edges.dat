5|$|Characteristics often vary by habitat, between shade-dwelling genera (such as Prosartes, Tricyrtis, Cardiocrinum, Clintonia, Medeola, Prosartes, and Scoliopus) and sun loving genera. Shade-dwelling genera {{usually have}} broader leaves with <b>smooth</b> <b>edges</b> and net venation, and fleshy fruits (berries) with animal-dispersed seeds, rhizomes, and small, {{inconspicuous}} flowers while genera native to sunny habitats usually have narrow, parallel-veined leaves, capsular fruits with wind-dispersed seeds, bulbs, and large, visually conspicuous flowers.

5|$|The sand devil has a flattened, {{moderately}} {{narrow body}} with greatly enlarged pectoral and pelvic fins. The skin folds {{along the sides}} of the head have smooth margins, without lobes. The large eyes are placed on top of the head and have prominent spiracles behind. The nostrils bear thin, pointed barbels with smooth or slightly fringed margins. The wide mouth is positioned terminally on the head. The jaws contain 10 upper and 9 lower tooth rows on each side, with toothless gaps at the middle. Each tooth has a broad base and a single pointed cusp with <b>smooth</b> <b>edges.</b> There are five pairs of gill slits located {{on the sides of the}} head.|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesTo {{compare the}} quality of {{duodenal}} and ileal samples obtained with different biopsy forceps. MethodsFifteen dogs were included in a prospective ex vivo study. After euthanasia, the duodenum and the ileum were sampled with four different forceps and evaluated according to a standardised scoring system. The biopsy forceps evaluated had alligator jaws or cups with <b>smooth</b> <b>edge</b> {{with or without a}} needle. ResultsThe global quality of the biopsies was better in the ileum that in the duodenum regardless of the biopsy forceps. Biopsy forceps with <b>smooth</b> <b>edge</b> including a needle resulted in fewer artefacts than biopsy forceps with <b>smooth</b> <b>edge</b> but no needle in both sites and those with alligator jaws without a needle provided deeper biopsies than those with <b>smooth</b> <b>edge</b> without a needle only in the duodenum. There was no effect of the biopsy forceps type {{on the size of the}} biopsies. Clinical SignificanceOur findings may aid in choosing the appropriate type of forceps for intestinal biopsy...|$|R

Historically, milling also served to discourage coin clipping.|$|E
25|$|As its {{common name}} suggests, the daggernose shark {{has a very}} long, {{flattened}} snout with a pointed tip and an acutely triangular profile from above. The eyes are circular and minute in size, with nictitating membranes (a protective third eyelid). The nostrils are small, without prominent nasal skin flaps. There are short but deep furrows {{at the corners of}} the mouth on both jaws. The tooth rows number 49–60 and 49–56 in the upper and lower jaws respectively. Each tooth has a single narrow, upright cusp; the upper teeth are slightly broader and flatter than the lower teeth, with serrated rather than <b>smooth</b> <b>edges.</b>|$|E
25|$|His stigmata, {{regarded}} {{as evidence of}} holiness, were studied by physicians whose independence from the Church is not known. The observations were unexplainable and the wounds never became infected. His wounds healed once but reappeared. They were examined by Luigi Romanelli, chief physician of the City Hospital of Barletta, for about one year. Dr. Giorgio Festa, a private practitioner, also examined them in 1920 and 1925. Professor Giuseppe Bastianelli, physician to Pope Benedict XV, agreed that the wounds existed but made no other comment. Pathologist Dr. Amico Bignami of the University of Rome also observed the wounds but could make no diagnosis. Both Bignami and Dr. Giuseppe Sala commented on the unusually <b>smooth</b> <b>edges</b> of the wounds and lack of edema. Dr. Alberto Caserta took x-rays of Padre Pio's hands in 1954 and found no abnormality in the bone structure.|$|E

500|$|Reaching [...] in length, the Australian weasel shark has a slender, {{spindle-shaped}} {{body and}} a moderately long head with a thick, rounded snout. The large, oval eyes possess nictitating membranes and have notched posterior rims. Tiny spiracles are located behind and above the eyes. The large nostrils are preceded by fairly long, triangular flaps of skin. The short, curved mouth bears prominent furrows at the corners. There are 28–30 upper and 46–52 lower tooth rows, which are not visible when the mouth is closed; the upper teeth are broad and angled with large serrations on the trailing edge only, whereas the lower teeth are thin and upright with <b>smooth</b> <b>edges.</b> There are five pairs of fairly short gill slits.|$|E
500|$|Szczerbiec (...) is the {{coronation}} sword {{that was used}} in crowning ceremonies of most Polish monarchs from 1320 to 1764. It is currently on display in the treasure vault of the Royal Wawel Castle in Kraków as the only preserved piece of the medieval Polish Crown Jewels. The sword is characterized by a hilt decorated with magical formulas, Christian symbols and floral patterns, as well as a narrow slit in the blade which holds a small shield with the coat of arms of Poland. Its name, derived from the Polish word [...] meaning a gap, notch or chip, is sometimes rendered into English as [...] "the Notched Sword" [...] or [...] "the Jagged Sword", although its blade has straight and <b>smooth</b> <b>edges.</b>|$|E
500|$|On 17 October 2007, {{designer}} Justin Cook {{revealed in}} an interview with PC Zone that the then-untitled project was in designing stages, with the entire core team from the original Banjo-Kazooie giving it full-time attention. During development, Mayles asserted that getting the in-game editor powerful enough to ensure that players could build [...] "what they liked". For re-designing the characters of Banjo and Kazooie, Mayles and Bryan were tasked with finding a suitable way to update the two characters. Initially, they designed high-resolution characters for the protagonists, however Bryan recalled that they lacked [...] "the charm" [...] the original game held. Later during development, Bryan suggested that the characters in the game should appear cuboid, and thus finalised the designs with <b>smooth</b> <b>edges,</b> whilst retaining the two characters' original appearances. Due to the game revolving around the theme of construction, the team went to lengths to ensure that the game's aesthetics look like [...] "everything was constructed" [...] with patchwork, to give the illusion that [...] "everything was patched together". Mayles stated that all of the voice-work from the characters were performed in-house by Rare staff; Banjo-Kazooie lead programmer Chris Sutherland reprised his role of voicing Banjo and Kazooie.|$|E

50|$|The main {{advantage}} of this technique over conventional anti-aliasing {{is that it does}} not require large amounts of computing power.

In addition it <b>smooths</b> <b>edges</b> in all pixels on the screen, including those inside alpha-blended textures and those resulting from pixel shader effects, which were previously immune to the effects of multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA).|$|R
