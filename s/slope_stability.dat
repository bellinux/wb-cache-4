5|$|The Saint Paul City Council {{decided in}} late 1974 to support I-35E, {{possibly}} {{due to the}} influence of proponents. R.I.P. 35E proposed an alternative to the original plan, and convinced the city council to go along with it. The plan included a four-lane boulevard upgrade of Pleasant Avenue (the street chosen for the I-35E alignment), with another route such as Shepard Road or the nearby Lafayette Freeway forming part of I-35E. The group opposed any direct connection of this parkway to I-94 near the State Capitol, where I-35E and I-94 were to merge. The EIS was completed in early 1975, identifying noise pollution, air pollution, vibrations, and <b>slope</b> <b>stability</b> as the main concerns. In addition to the nearby location of historic districts, hospitals were worried about the effects of vibrations on sensitive operations; the MHD solved this problem while the report was being developed. The EIS identified the primary benefit of completing I-35E as connecting downtown Saint Paul to the Interstate Highway System, and determined that the original Pleasant Avenue corridor was the best choice, but with minor changes such as lowering the freeway below Grand Avenue and Ramsey Street.|$|E

A previously stable slope may be initially affected by preparatory factors, making the slope conditionally unstable.

Mass movements can be caused by increase in shear stress, such as loading, lateral pressure, and transient forces. Alternatively, shear strength may be decreased by weathering, changes in pore water pressure, and organic material.|$|E

However, SWCCs exhibit high uncertainty because of complex influencing factors, {{which has not been}} previously considered in <b>slope</b> seepage and <b>stability</b> analysis under conditions of rainfall. This study aimed to evaluate the uncertainty of the SWCC and its effects on the seepage and stability analysis of an unsaturated soil slope under conditions of rainfall. The SWCC model parameters were treated as random variables. An uncertainty evaluation of the parameters was conducted based on the Bayesian approach and the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Observed data from granite residual soil were used to test the uncertainty of the SWCC. Then, different confidence intervals for the model parameters of the SWCC were constructed.

40|$|As {{pressure}} to develop on hillsides underlain by landslides increases, detailed pre-development geological and geotechnical-engineering {{studies are needed}} to understand landslide stability. Research on historical landslides by the Utah Geological Survey (UGS) provides insights into landslide behavior, and the results of detailed pre-development landslide-stability studies should be consistent with these research results. Specifically, historical landslide behavior contradicts some geologic evidence commonly cited to demonstrate the stability of pre-existing landslides, such as subdued geomorphic expression and natural buttressing. Similarly, although geotechnical-engineering analyses in Utah commonly indicate that Holocene-age landslides have adequate stability for development, historical landsliding indicates that Holocene landslides are commonly near a threshold of instability where slight increases in ground-water levels induce movement. Also, relative to determining minimum safe setback distances above and below landslides, historical landsliding has demonstrated that damaging deformation may occur downslope beyond the toe of the landslide, landslides may enlarge upslope beyond a setback based on main-scarp stability, and multiple failure types must generally be considered in estimating runout distances and setbacks from the base of <b>slopes.</b> <b>Stability</b> analyses of landslides must objectively assess the likelihood of renewed movement, including relatively minor but still damaging movement.
