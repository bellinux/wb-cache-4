5|$|His {{government}} {{was recognized by}} the western Allies. Nonetheless Sikorski's government struggled to get its point of view heard by France and the United Kingdom. The western Allies refused to recognize the Soviet Union as an aggressor, despite the <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Poland on 17 September 1939. Furthermore, he struggled to secure resources needed to recreate the Polish Army in exile.|$|E
5|$|In January 1980, in {{response}} to the <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Afghanistan, President Carter postponed consideration of the SALT-2 Treaty and imposed a trade embargo.

5|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, the USSR {{had built up}} a {{military}} arsenal and army surpassing that of the United States. Soon after the <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Afghanistan, president Carter began massively building up the United States military. This buildup was accelerated by the Reagan administration, which increased the military spending from 5.3 percent of GNP in 1981 to 6.5 percent in 1986, the largest peacetime defense buildup in United States history.|$|E
5|$|However, another {{obstacle}} arose {{with the}} <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Afghanistan, {{which resulted in}} a boycott of the Games by {{a large part of the}} Western World, led by the United States. The Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser was also the patron of the Australian Olympic Committee, and significant political pressure came to bear on the athletes to boycott the Games. Tonelli, however, realised that only the sportspeople would suffer from a boycott and that trade relations would continue unabated. He took a leadership role among the athletes to fight for their right to compete.|$|E
5|$|In 1903 {{a statue}} of Żółkiewski was built in Źółkiew, but it was {{demolished}} in 1939 by Soviet troops {{in the aftermath of}} the <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Poland.

As of 2011, the St. Lawrence's Church and castle in Źółkwia were being renovated by a team of Polish and Ukrainians conservators.|$|E
5000|$|Though he {{initially}} supported Khrushchev's reforms, he cited his experience surrounding the [...] "Secret Speech" [...] and the <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasions</b> <b>of</b> Hungary and Czechoslovakia, as experiences which changed him politically, and later {{acknowledged that he}} was troubled by his own credulity in reporting the Slánský show trial.|$|R

5|$|It {{was during}} this period that the Soviets started to assert {{themselves}} in several new theaters of action, in particular through Cuban proxies during the Angolan Civil War starting in 1975 and the <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Afghanistan in 1979. U.S. strategy to this point had been focused on containing Communism and preparation for war in Europe. The new Soviet actions revealed that the military lacked capability outside these narrow confines.|$|E
5|$|She was {{commissioned}} into the Pacific Fleet in 1943. She {{was ordered to}} prepare for transfer to the Soviet Northern Fleet via the Northern Sea Route on 24 April 1943 and extensive preparations were made for the voyage.

The transfer was canceled without explanation on 1 June 1943, but the alterations remained in place until 1944. She remained inactive during the <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Manchuria in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Thatcher's first {{foreign policy}} crisis {{came with the}} 1979 <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Afghanistan. She {{condemned}} the invasion, said it showed the bankruptcy of a détente policy, and helped convince some British athletes to boycott the 1980 Moscow Olympics. She gave weak support to US President Jimmy Carter who tried to punish the USSR with economic sanctions. Britain's economic situation was precarious, and most of NATO was reluctant to cut trade ties. The Financial Times reported that her government had secretly supplied Saddam Hussein with military equipment since 1981.|$|E

5|$|The {{fortress}} {{also plays}} a part in Operation Garbo, a three-volume novel written by Harry Winter, a pseudonym for an undisclosed number of people. The techno-thriller novel is about a <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Sweden, and while Boden Fortress is not a {{main part of the}} story, one chapter in the first volume briefly mentions Södra Åberget Fort, and two chapters in the second volume are devoted to events at and around the forts, Södra Åberget and Mjösjöberget Forts are mentioned by name while Rödberget Fort is described more in detail.|$|E
5|$|Early during Kosygin's tenure, the Brezhnev–Kosygin {{attempt to}} create {{stability}} was failing on various fronts. From 1969 to 1970 discontent within the Soviet leadership had grown {{to such an extent}} that some started to doubt both former and current Soviet policies. Examples include the handling of the <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Czechoslovakia (which Kosygin initially resisted), the decline in agriculture production, the Sino–Soviet border conflict (he advocated restraint), the Vietnam War, and the Soviet–American talks on the limitation of strategic missiles. Two summit conferences between the US and the USSR were held: the Warsaw Pact Summit Conference and the Moscow Summit Conference; both failed to gain support for Soviet policies.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, {{the ship}} was requisitioned by the War Shipping Administration, which {{transferred}} her to the Soviet Union {{under the terms of}} Lend-Lease in December 1942.

She delivered cargo and troops in support of the <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Japanese-held territories in August 1945. After the war, the ship remained a part of the Soviet merchant fleet until 1966. She was transferred to North Korea at that time to become a fish processing facility, and was scrapped in 1969.|$|E
25|$|Had it {{not been}} for the Soviet-German treaty and the <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion,</b> all <b>of</b> prewar Poland would have likely been {{captured}} by Nazi Garmany already in 1939.|$|R
50|$|Based on Hautamäki's findings, the Soviet Union did {{not only}} intend to occupy Finland, but Finland {{was just a}} part of a much greater <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> plan <b>of</b> Europe.|$|R
50|$|Kurdybań Warkowicki, or Kurdyban-Warkowicki, was a Polish {{village in}} Wołyń Voivodeship (1921-1939) before the joint Nazi German and <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasions</b> <b>of</b> Poland in 1939.
