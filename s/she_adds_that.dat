5|$|As Ziva and Tony {{drive home}} from the airport, she divulges the reason for her resentment of the new director: Orli Elbaz {{was the reason for}} her parents' divorce. She {{discloses}} that she had always believed that it was a political strategy on Elbaz's part in attempt to advance her rank in Mossad, though she now thinks that it is possible that Elbaz had loved Eli. When <b>she</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> she believes that she would be a different person were it not for Elbaz, Tony expresses thankfulness that things occurred the way they did.|$|E
5|$|According to Pulitzer Prize winner Jhumpa Lahiri, Narayan's {{short stories}} {{have the same}} {{captivating}} feeling as his novels, with most of them less than ten pages long, and taking about as many minutes to read. <b>She</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> between the title sentence and the end, Narayan provides the reader something novelists struggle to achieve in hundreds more pages: a complete insight {{to the lives of}} his characters. These characteristics and abilities led Lahiri to classify him as belonging to the pantheon of short-story geniuses that include O. Henry, Frank O'Connor and Flannery O'Connor. Lahiri also compares him to Guy de Maupassant for their ability to compress the narrative without losing the story, and the common themes of middle-class life written with an unyielding and unpitying vision.|$|E
5|$|In January 2012, Denise Fox (Diane Parish) gives Marsden {{a letter}} incriminating Phil {{in the death}} of a {{homeless}} man, who died when he torched the car lot in an insurance scam in 1994; <b>she</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> Phil also murdered Stella Crawford (Sophie Thompson), and Marsden thanks Denise for the information. Marsden arrives in Walford and begins trailing Phil. She asks Denise not to tell Phil that she is in town, wanting to ensure Phil's imprisonment. Marsden then targets Phil's son Ben (Joshua Pascoe), interviewing him about Stella's death. Ben was abused by Stella and finds Marsden's questions distressing; however, she continues to press him. After a falling-out with Phil Ben changes his statement, telling Marsden that Phil told Stella to jump off a building or he would push her. Marsden then arrests Phil for murder, and Ben reveals he was stalking him. She informs Phil's partner, Shirley, that he has been charged with Stella's murder. Ben pleads with Marsden to keep his statement a secret from the Mitchells, but she tells him he must accept that his father will learn about Ben's involvement in his arrest eventually. After discovering Ben's lies about Phil, Ian then passes this information on to Marsden and Ben is arrested. On the day of Phil's release he helps Ben hide his involvement in Heather's murder; Marsden tells Phil at the police station she will contact him about Ben's accusations. The charges against Ben are dropped; Marsden visits Phil, taunting him that he will eventually slip up, and suggests that Ben may ultimately bring Phil down.|$|E

25|$|Stewart, having earlier {{heard from}} Nicola that {{she no longer}} needs a flat, tries to apologise to Charlotte, saying he will {{understand}} if she wishes to take the matter further. Charlotte responds by saying that, as a Christian, it is in her nature to forgive, and therefore she forgives him. But <b>she</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> there is evil {{in all of them}} and Stewart must never do this again. Then, to bury the hatchet, she gives Stewart another video. Stewart takes {{the rest of the day}} off sick, and again fast forwards through the faith programme. This time, however, there is nothing after the programme but static, which Stewart sits watching.|$|E
25|$|Charlotte drives Dolores {{to summer}} camp, where Dolores will be staying for three weeks, and leaves Humbert {{a letter in}} which she confesses that she has {{fallen in love with}} him. <b>She</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> if he doesn't love her back he must move out immediately. Humbert's {{solution}} to this dilemma is to marry Charlotte, not because he loves her but to stay close to Dolores. Later, Charlotte voices her plan to send Dolores to a boarding school when she returns from camp. Humbert then contemplates murdering Charlotte to remain close to Dolores but stops before carrying it out. A few days later, Charlotte finds Humbert's diary and furiously confronts him, telling him he will never see Dolores again. Charlotte then runs out of the house to mail letters she's written to friends about Humbert's obsession with Dolores but is killed by a passing car. Humbert recovers the letters from the accident scene and then burns them. Later, he convinces Charlotte's friends and neighbors that he is Dolores's biological father from a previous affair.|$|E
25|$|The police {{eventually}} {{identify the}} victim's clothing as being of French manufacture. Emma tells {{the police that}} she had received a letter claiming to be from Martine, a French girl whom her brother Edmund had wanted to marry. He had written about Martine and their impending marriage days {{before his death in}} the retreat to Dunkirk in 1940. The letter purporting to be from Martine claims that she was pregnant when Edmund died and that she now wishes their son to have all of the advantages to which his parentage should entitle him. The police conclude that the body in the sarcophagus is that of Martine but this proves not to be the case when Lady Stoddart-West, mother of James Stoddart-West, reveals that she is Martine. Although she and Edmund had intended to marry, Edmund died before they could do so and she later married an SOE officer and settled in England. <b>She</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> she would not have come forward until learning from her son of the forged letter to Emma.|$|E

500|$|Hilda Ellis Davidson says that, {{regarding}} valkyries, [...] "evidently {{an elaborate}} literary picture {{has been built}} up by generations of poets and storytellers, in which several conceptions can be discerned. We recognise something akin to Norns, spirits who decide destinies of men; to the seeresses, who could protect men in battle with their spells; to the powerful female guardian spirits attached to certain families, bringing luck to youth under their protection; even to certain women who armed themselves and fought like men, for whom there is some historical evidence from the regions round the Black Sea". <b>She</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> {{there may also be}} a memory in this of a [...] "priestess of the god of war, women who officiated at the sacrificial rites when captives were put to death after battle." ...|$|E

[...] However, in her biography of Bewick, <b>she</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> [...] "The country might be beautiful but it also stank: in his vignettes men relieve themselves in hedges and ruins, a woman holds her nose as she walks between the cowpats, and a farmyard privy shows that men are as filthy as the pigs they despise." ...|$|E

[...] <b>She</b> <b>added</b> <b>that</b> Dixon was [...] "forced to kill his hero to cleanze the novel's idealized white world."

500|$|Leslie (Amy Poehler) excitedly {{prepares to}} present the parks {{department}} budget proposal, or [...] "master plan". However, city manager Paul (Phil Reeves), announces due to Pawnee's huge budget deficit, all proposals will be postponed indefinitely. State auditors have been sent by the governor to solve the impasse, which makes Leslie fear severe cuts. Ron (Nick Offerman) is delighted because he hates any government spending, which leads him to heated arguments with Leslie. Meanwhile, April (Aubrey Plaza) is turning 21 and is having her birthday party at Tom's (Aziz Ansari) favorite nightclub, the Snakehole Lounge. Andy (Chris Pratt) debates whether to ask April to be his girlfriend, but worries about the age difference because he is 29. Ann (Rashida Jones) has broken up with Mark (Paul Schneider), and they meet at the diner to discuss {{the end of their}} relationship. Mark is quietly stunned by Ann's decisions and says [...] "We never even fought", but Ann points out that NEVER fighting was a bad thing because it meant their relationship had no passion, and <b>she</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> Mark isn't used to dating anyone {{for a long period of}} time and over-stated the relationship's strength for that reason.|$|E
500|$|Levinson {{proposes that}} {{citizenship}} education {{can provide the}} [...] "cultural coherence" [...] that may be missing from a [...] "detached" [...] school—which would be a diverse community that prioritizes [...] "critical thinking, tolerance, and reflectiveness". She argues for a constitutional mandate to establish the [...] "autonomy-promoting aim of education" [...] regardless of public support, and asks for a [...] "culture change". Levinson distinguishes between parental and child rights, as laws exist for parents who do not act in their children's best interests. <b>She</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> children are limited by the restricted scope of their parents' knowledge, and that the state should intervene to combat this small-mindedness {{in the interests of}} children. Specifically, she cites Christian criticism of curricular neutrality as a tactic to justify the imposition of their own [...] "limited and restrictive" [...] worldview, and that external knowledge increases the odds of their children not adopting their worldview. Her argument is that the limited worldviews resulting from [...] "excessive paternalism" [...] consequently stunt children's ability to develop adult autonomy or make rational decisions. Thus, state and parental paternalism should be limited where it will hurt individual [...] "capacity for autonomy".|$|E
500|$|German {{scholars}} such as Brigitte Schön and Gerald Willms have {{commented that}} rhetoric dominates public discourse around Scientology in Germany: in their view, efforts to [...] "frame" [...] information {{in such a way}} as to shape opinion have long been more important than the underlying realities. In Schön's words, this includes both the [...] "efforts of German politicians to enhance their popularity with strong-worded statements" [...] and [...] "Scientology's efforts to present itself as the victim of unjust persecution"; commenting on foreign reporting on Scientology in Germany, <b>she</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> [...] "the American press may prefer sensationalist news to boring investigation and may frame the issue according to American stereotypes". Both Willms and Schön assert that the situation is compounded by the general paucity of scientific studies of Scientology. Schön as well as Irving Hexham, Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Calgary in Canada, have remarked in particular on the lack of academic studies by German scholars. Hexham attributes this situation to the strong influence of the Christian churches in Germany, which has made German academics wary of approaching the subject, because they fear repercussions for their research funding and for their prospects of future employment if they involve themselves in the debate.|$|E

[...] <b>She</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> [...] "with each blow that life delivers [...] bobs back up again, almost asking for more trouble, more pain, more suffering." [...] Dot is renowned for being a hypochondriac, her Christian faith and quoting from the Bible.

According to Kingsley, [...] "nothing shakes Dot's view that the world is good because the creator made it so. Her faith sustains her through the most appalling ordeals." [...] The character once expressed {{part of the reason for}} her faith on-screen in 2000, commenting to a vicar, [...] "I couldn't manage without my faith, not with the life I've had"; former executive producer of EastEnders, John Yorke, has stated that this is his favourite line of EastEnders' entire existence. Author Antony Slide has noted that Dot's religious beliefs have given her solace, but has given her an excuse to be prejudiced against her neighbours, and to deal with the criminal antics of her wayward son.

500|$|Historians have {{advanced}} various views as to why, even though Müller was {{generally regarded as}} the superior scholar, he lost to Williams. Beckerlegge suggests several possible factors: unlike Williams, Müller {{was known as a}} writer and translator rather than a teacher of Sanskrit, he did not have links to the East India Company or the Indian Civil Service that he could call upon for supporters, and he had not been educated at Oxford. In his obituary of Müller, Arthur Macdonell (Boden professor 1899–1926) said that the election [...] "came to turn on the political and religious opinions of the candidates rather than on their merits as Sanskrit scholars", adding that [...] "party feeling ran high and large numbers came up to vote." [...] Similarly, Dowling has written that [...] "in the less cosmopolitan precincts outside Oxford... the argument that Müller was 'not English' told heavily against him" [...] since [...] "the argument was (and was meant to be, of course) unanswerable." [...] <b>She</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> Tories opposed him for his liberal political views, traditionalist factions within Oxford rejected [...] "Germanizing" [...] reform, and [...] "the Anglican clergy... detected unbelief lurking in his umlaut". The American historian Marjorie Wheeler-Barclay takes the view that the three motives for people voting against Müller cannot be disentangled. Those who supported Indian missionary work, Dowling writes, saw it as the key to continued British rule, and {{there was no need to}} take a chance by electing Müller, who had [...] "a reputation for unsound religious opinions", since Williams was a scholar [...] "of distinction known for his conservatism and piety." ...|$|E
