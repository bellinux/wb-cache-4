5|$|Since {{bupropion}} is metabolized to hydroxybupropion by the CYP2B6 enzyme, {{drug interactions}} with CYP2B6 inhibitors are possible: this includes medications like paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, diazepam, clopidogrel, and orphenadrine. The expected {{result is the}} increase of bupropion and decrease of hydroxybupropion blood concentration. The reverse effect (decrease of bupropion and increase of hydroxybupropion) can be expected with CYP2B6 inducers, such as carbamazepine, clotrimazole, rifampicin, ritonavir, St John's wort, phenobarbital, phenytoin and others. Conversely, because bupropion is itself a <b>strong</b> <b>inhibitor</b> of CYP2D6 (Ki = 21μM), as is its active metabolite, hydroxybupropion (Ki = 13.3μM), it can slow the clearance of other drugs metabolized by this enzyme. As an example, the ratio of dextromethorphan (a drug that is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6) to its major metabolite dextrorphan increased approximately 35-fold when it was administered to people being treated with 300mg/day bupropion, indicative of a major drug interaction with a common over-the-counter medicine.|$|E
25|$|Nitrazepam {{interacts with}} the {{antibiotic}} erythromycin which is a <b>strong</b> <b>inhibitor</b> of CYP3A4, which affects concentration peak time. This interaction is not believed to be clinically important. However, anxiety, tremor, and depression have been documented in a case report following administration of nitrazepam and triazolam. Following administration of erythromycin to the patient, repetitive hallucinations and abnormal bodily sensations developed. The patient had acute pneumonia and renal failure. Coadministration of benzodiazepine drugs at therapeutic doses with erythromycin may cause serious psychotic symptoms, especially in those with other significant physical complications.|$|E

40|$|The Eco R 1 {{restriction}} enzyme {{can be shown}} to be inhibited by nucleotides which correspond to any part of its known site of phosphodiesterase activity. A series of di-, tetra-, and hexa-nucleotide fragments were synthesized and their effect on the activity of the enzyme upon superhelical Co 1 E 1 DNA studied. The inhibition caused by the individual mononucleotides were also studied. In general all the nucleotide fragments showed some form of interaction with the enzyme system. Tetranucleotides were <b>stronger</b> <b>inhibitors</b> than dinucleotides, which in turn were <b>stronger</b> <b>inhibitors</b> than the mononucleotides. Within each category of inhibitors, those containing the phosphodiester bond which is acted upon by the enzyme were the <b>strongest</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> Only those fragments which were consistent with the enzymes site of activity showed competitive inhibition kinetics. Nucleotides which do not fit within the site of phosphodiesterase activity show non-competitive inhibition kinetics...|$|R

50|$|Cytoplasmic MCD {{is thought}} {{to play a role}} in the {{regulation}} of cytoplasmic malonyl-CoA abundance and, therefore, of mitochondrial fatty acid uptake and oxidation.

50|$|Diabetes: Acarbose, an {{alpha-glucosidase}} inhibitor, competitively and reversibly inhibits alpha-glucosidase in the intestines. This inhibition {{lowers the}} rate of glucose absorption through delayed carbohydrate digestion and extended digestion time. Acarbose may {{have the capability to}} stop developing diabetic symptoms. Hence, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (like acarbose) are used as anti-diabetic drugs in combination with other anti-diabetic drugs. Luteolin {{has been found to be}} a <b>strong</b> <b>inhibitor</b> of alpha-glucosidase. The compound can inhibit the enzyme up to 36% with a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. As of 2016, this substance is being tested in rats, mice and cell culture.|$|E
50|$|STRA6 {{has also}} been {{associated}} with facilitating insulin resistance. This is because STRA6 signaling results in activation of transcription factor STAT5 target genes. One of these target genes is a suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) which is a <b>strong</b> <b>inhibitor</b> of insulin signaling. As a result, STRA6 signaling suppresses the response to insulin by inhibiting the phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, IR, by an influx of insulin. In other words, increased levels of the RBP in obese animals (which will increase STRA6 activity) can facilitate insulin resistance. Due to this close relationship between STRA6 and insulin resistance, it has been demonstrated that single nucleotide polymorphisms in STRA6 are associated with Type 2 Diabetes.|$|E

50|$|Two {{types of}} trypsin {{inhibitor}}s {{are found in}} soy: the Kunitz trypsin inhibitor (KTI) and the Bowman-Birk inhibitor (BBI). KTI is a large (20,100 daltons), <b>strong</b> <b>inhibitor</b> of trypsin, while BBI is much smaller (8,000 daltons) and inhibits both trypsin and chymotrypsin. Both inhibitors have significant anti-nutritive effects in the body, affecting digestion by hindering protein hydrolysis and activation of other enzymes in the gut. In soy, KTI is found in much larger concentrations than BBI is soy, however, to achieve the highest nutritional value from this ingredient, both of these inhibitors must be denatured in some way. Whole soybeans {{have been reported to}} contain 17-27 mg of trypsin inhibitor per gram.|$|E
50|$|Ritonavir, a peptidomimetic HIV {{protease}} inhibitor, was marketed in 1996. It {{was designed}} to fit the C2-symmetry in the binding site of the protease. The developers of ritonavir, Abbott Laboratories, started with compounds that were active against the virus but had poor bioavailability. Some improvements were made, for example the terminal phenyl residues were removed and pyridyl groups put instead to add water solubility. The final product of these improvements was ritonavir. Significant gastrointestinal side effects and a large pill burden are ritonavir's main drawbacks and is therefore not used as a single treatment. However, it is a <b>strong</b> <b>inhibitor</b> of the cytochrome P450 enzyme mediated metabolism {{and it is only}} used in a combination therapy with other protease inhibitors for pharmacokinetic boosting.|$|E
50|$|This gene {{belongs to}} the family of reticulon-encoding genes. Reticulons are {{associated}} with the endoplasmic reticulum, and are involved in neuroendocrine secretion or in membrane trafficking in neuroendocrine cells. The product of this gene is a potent neurite outgrowth inhibitor that may also help block the regeneration of the central nervous system in higher vertebrates. Alternatively spliced transcript variants derived both from differential splicing and differential promoter usage and encoding different isoforms have been identified. There are three isoforms: Nogo A, B and C. Nogo-A has two known inhibitory domains including amino-Nogo, at the N-terminus and Nogo-66, which makes up the molecules extracellular loop. Both amino-Nogo and Nogo-66 are involved in inhibitory responses, where amino-Nogo is a <b>strong</b> <b>inhibitor</b> of neurite outgrowth, and Nogo-66 is involved in growth cone destruction.|$|E
