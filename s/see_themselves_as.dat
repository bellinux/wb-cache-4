5|$|Impression Management {{is defined}} as when an {{individual}} attempts to present an acceptable image to those around him or her verbally or nonverbally (480). This definition is based on Goffman’s idea that individuals <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> others view them, so in essence they attempt to <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> if they are outside looking in (480). Goffman also dedicating this work to discover the subtle ways humans present acceptable images by concealing information that may conflict with the images for a particular situation. For instance, concealing tattoos when applying {{for a job in}} which tattoos would be inappropriate, or hiding a bizarre obsession such as collecting/interacting with dolls which society as a whole may see as abnormal.|$|E
5|$|An {{anonymous}} {{review of}} Srigala Item in the Surabaya-based daily Soerabaijasch Handelsblad was positive, predicting the film {{would be a}} commercial success. This prediction was fulfilled, as Srigala Item reached extensive audiences– mostly lower-class natives. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran credits this success to escapism. He writes that the film's theme of an oppressed, financially destitute youth {{who is able to}} control his destiny by becoming a masked vigilante, allowed viewers to be able to <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> the Black Wolf, and thus take revenge against those who had wronged them.|$|E
5|$|Modern Syria {{was first}} {{established}} in 1920 as the Arab Kingdom of Syria under King Faisal. This state was {{planned to be}} a new Arab kingdom, and not just Syrian, and the state espoused Arab nationalism and pan-Islamic policies. However the British, who had helped establish the state after World War I, made a secret agreement with France and established the French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon. The area thereby functioned as one of France's colonies, and the newly established state was viewed unfavorably by most Syrians, with many of them regarding it as a vessel of European imperialism. At this stage, some movements tried to establish a Syrian identity, most notably the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, or became advocates of communism and Islamism. The majority of Syrians continued to <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> Arabs rather than Syrians.|$|E

5|$|The {{conquest of}} the Danelaw by West Saxon kings had united England in a single kingdom for the first time, {{enabling}} kings from Æthelstan onwards to <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> heirs of the Carolingian emperors; the regulation of monasteries by a uniform Benedictine rule was designed to unite the kingdom ideologically and enhance royal prestige. The monks depended on the king {{in a way that}} the local ealdormen did not, so their loyalty could be trusted and they could act as a counterbalance to powerful local families. The Regularis Concordia required that psalms be said for the king and the queen in monasteries several times a day, and specified that royal consent must be obtained for the election of abbots. The reformers aimed to enhance the Christian character of kingship, and one aspect of this was to raise the status of the queen; Edgar's last wife, Ælfthryth, was the first king's consort to regularly witness charters as regina.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{intensely}} closeted {{nature of}} Miami's gay community at that time, many voters {{who were not}} swayed by Bryant's rhetoric were persuaded instead by her campaign's point that the law was unnecessary; {{they were unable to}} see the problem of discrimination. Unlike blacks or Cubans, gay men and lesbians were able to find jobs, although they faced dismissal upon their supervisors learning of their sexual orientation. In order to see a complaint through, they would have to remain out, and many lived in constant fear of exposure. Since the advent of second wave feminism earlier in the decade, many lesbians in the U.S. were unable to <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> part of the same community with gay men. Accusations from Save Our Children were almost all directed at the behavior of men. As a result, much of the response by gay men was angry and many lesbians took issue with the misogynistic tone gay men used. However, with Bryant representing a common adversary, {{for the first time in}} years, gay men and lesbians united to work together on the campaign.|$|E
25|$|May 2009 Taiwan's (Republic of China) Department of the Interior {{published}} a survey examining whether people in Taiwan <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> Taiwanese, Chinese or both. 64.6% <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> Taiwanese, 11.5% as Chinese, 18.1% as both and 5.8% were unsure.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are several}} groups of Martins or Macmartins in Scotland. The MacMartins of Letterfinlay {{appear to have}} allied {{themselves}} to the Clan Cameron in the late 14th century, and finally merged with the Camerons after the Battle of Lochaber in 1429. The MacMartins, who became a sept of Clan Cameron, {{are said to have}} been amongst the most loyal and valuable followers of Cameron of Lochiel. In the Jacobite rising of 1745, the MacMartins were [...] "out with" [...] Lochiel's regiment. According to the Oxford Companion to Scottish History, the MacMartins of Letterfinlay who were a sept of the Clan Cameron would have <b>seen</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> distinct within their own lands, but would have also <b>seen</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> Camerons if operating elsewhere outside of Lochaber.|$|R

25|$|Northern Ireland {{was created}} in 1921, when Ireland was {{partitioned}} between Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland by the Government of Ireland Act 1920. Unlike Southern Ireland, which would become the Irish Free State in 1922, the majority of Northern Ireland's population were unionists, who wanted to remain within the United Kingdom. Most of these were the Protestant descendants of colonists from Great Britain. However, a significant minority, mostly Catholics, were nationalists who wanted a united Ireland independent of British rule. Today, the former generally <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> British and the latter generally <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> Irish, while a distinct Northern Irish or Ulster identity is claimed both by a large minority of Catholics and Protestants and by {{many of those who}} are non-aligned.|$|E

40|$|Extract: Generally, {{humans have}} <b>seen</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> {{the centre of}} existence, with the world around of value {{only to the extent}} that it is useful to them.

50|$|In {{the context}} of Scottish clans, septs are {{families}} that followed another family's chief. These smaller septs would then comprise, and be part of, the chief's larger clan. A sept might follow another chief if two families were linked through marriage; or, if a family lived on the land of a powerful laird, they would follow him whether they were related or not. Bonds of manrent were sometimes used to bind lesser chiefs and his followers to more powerful chiefs. According to the Oxford Companion to Scottish History, the MacMartins of Letterfinlay who were a sept of the Clan Cameron would have <b>seen</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> distinct within their own lands, but would have also <b>seen</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> Camerons if operating elsewhere outside of Lochaber. Bonds of manrent and friendship tied obviously non-related kin groups into a wider military, political, and land/food resource sharing clanship.|$|R
25|$|Orthodox Judaism. Orthodox Jews {{generally}} <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> practicing normative Judaism, {{rather than}} {{belonging to a}} particular movement.

50|$|The {{development}} of television brought many previously isolated communities into mainstream British {{culture in the}} 1950s and 1960s. The Internet continues this integration, further eroding the town/country divide. In the 21st century British country people are less frequently seen as yokels. In the British TV Show The Two Ronnies, it was asserted that despite political correctness, {{it is possible to}} poke fun at yokels <b>as</b> no-one <b>sees</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> being one.|$|R
25|$|In the 1650s {{after the}} Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, Catholics were banned from {{dwelling}} {{within the city}} limits under the vengeful Cromwellian settlement but this law was not strictly enforced. Ultimately, this religious discrimination led to the Old English community abandoning their English roots and coming to <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> part of the native Irish community.|$|E

40|$|Today {{there is}} an {{increasing}} interest in the benefits of using art {{in the field of}} health-care. This interest is to be welcomed and applauded - the work done by artists within health settings has for too long been dismissed as merely discretionary, or worse still, upsetting. This increased appeal, however, is also creating divisions. Divisions between those who <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> primarily <b>as</b> artists and those who <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> primarily <b>as</b> therapists.

In 1949, the United National Party (UNP) government stripped the Indian Tamils of their nationality, including their right to vote. Prominent Tamil political leaders such as S. J. V.

25|$|Under {{the reign}} of Ivan the Great (1462–1505), Moscow became a major {{regional}} power, and the annexation of the vast Republic of Novgorod in 1478 laid the foundations for a Russian national state.

25|$|Between the 1840s and the 1930s, some 900,000 French Canadians {{emigrated to}} the New England region. About half of them {{returned}} home.
