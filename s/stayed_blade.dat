50|$|The Blood <b>Stays</b> on the <b>Blade,</b> {{released}} on May 12, 2008 through Thirty Days of Night Records, {{is the second}} EP and third release from the St Albans-based hardcore punk band Your Demise. It is the follow-up to their debut full-length You Only Make Us Stronger.|$|R
5000|$|Reynolds 531 [...] "was the {{standard}} of excellence for many decades" [...] among bicycle frame-building materials. And because {{of the availability of}} a wide range of butting, diameters and thicknesses of tubes, along with different <b>stays</b> and fork <b>blades,</b> it became the tubing of choice for most frame builders.|$|R
50|$|The {{band was}} formed in 2003. Various demos and EPs were {{recorded}} and handed out for free {{over the next couple}} of years until You Only Make Us Stronger was recorded and self-released by the band. This was followed by The Blood <b>Stays</b> on the <b>Blade,</b> released by Thirty Days of Night Records in 2008.|$|R
5000|$|... 531 tubing {{became the}} tubing-of-choice for most framebuilders {{at least partly}} because of the huge range of butting, diameters and {{thicknesses}} of tubes along with different <b>stays</b> and fork <b>blades</b> available - helped by the willingness of Reynolds to make special tubes for certain manufacturers. Reynolds also made up complete 'sets' of tubing for different cycling applications - for example 531c (Competition), 531st (Special Tourist), 531ATB (All Terrain Bike) and so-on. This flexibility made 531 still competitive even after the introduction of more advanced alloys. The widespread use of TIG and MIG welding in cycle manufacture became a problem as 531 reacted poorly to the higher temperatures produced and 531 has been gradually phased out as a result.|$|R
50|$|Mela Lee is an American voice {{actress and}} singer in the Los Angeles area. She first got into voice acting when she auditioned for Vampire Princess Miyu, but the {{director}} had her read for Saint Tail, {{and she was}} cast as the title character Meimi Haneoka, whom assumes the secret identity of Saint Tail. She would later land the vampire role of Yuki Cross in the Vampire Knight series and Rin Tosaka, the heroine of the Fate/stay night series. Outside of voice acting, Lee {{has been involved in}} a band called Magnolia Memoir where she composes the music and lyrics. She and fellow voice actress Erica Lindbeck host their own web series called Lindbeck and Lee with local voice actor guests. She has reprised her role of Rin in Fate <b>Stay</b> Night: Unlimited <b>Blade</b> Works.|$|R
50|$|Your Demise were a British {{hardcore}} punk {{band from}} St Albans, England, formed in 2003. They shared stages and toured worldwide {{with the likes}} of Comeback Kid, Basement, Trapped Under Ice, Man Overboard, Enter Shikari, Parkway Drive, A Day to Remember and Bring Me the Horizon. On 22 September 2008, the band confirmed that they had signed a deal with Visible Noise. The band played their final gig at The London Underworld on 15 March 2014, after announcing in 2013 that they would be parting ways in March. A New Farewell was announced on 30 April to mark ten years of the band {{and there will be a}} re-release of The Blood <b>Stays</b> on the <b>Blade</b> on vinyl with unreleased B-Sides, as well as a UK tour with founding member George Noble on vocals.|$|R
50|$|Kocur rose to promimence {{playing for}} the Saskatoon Blades of the Western Hockey League. He showed {{impressive}} numbers in the 1987-88 season scoring 71 points in 69 games. The Detroit Red Wings took notice and drafted Kocur in hopes he would {{follow in the footsteps}} of his cousin, Joe Kocur. He <b>stayed</b> with the <b>Blades</b> for one more season earning his most impressive numbers to date with 102 points in just 66 games. In 1989 Kocur was brought up to the Adirondack Red Wings of the American Hockey League in hopes that he would continue to produce big numbers. For two years he helped add goals for Adirondack, but never reached the level that the Red Wings organization wanted. In 1991, he was moved to the Fort Wayne Komets of the International Hockey League where he returned to form, albeit on a weaker team. Kocur would return to the Adirondack Red Wings in 1992 for two games before retiring from professional hockey, having never reached the NHL.|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{behavior}} of structural systems may be strongly {{characterized by the}} occurrence of multiple internal resonances for particular combinations of the mechanical parameters. The linear models governing these resonant or nearly-resonant systems tend to exhibit high sensitivity of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors to small parameter modifications. This pathologic condition is recognized {{as a source of}} relevant phenomena, such as frequency veering and mode localization or hybridization. The paper presents the generalization of uniformly valid perturbation methods to perform eigensolution sensitivity analyses in N-dimensional Hamiltonian systems with a generic number of close eigenvalues. The leading idea is to systematically treat nearly-resonant systems as multi-parameter perturbations of a perfectly-resonant, non-defective [...] though a priori unknown [...] reference system. Given a single nearly-resonant system, a multi-parameter perturbation method is presented to achieve a twofold objective: first, identify a close resonant system suited to serve {{as a starting point for}} sensitivity analyses (inverse problem); second, asymptotically approximate the eigensolution of all the nearly-resonant systems which may arise from its generic perturbation (direct problem). The direct problem solution is analyzed with a focus on the eigensolution sensitivity to parameter perturbations with different physical meanings, such as a slight geometric disorder or weak elastic coupling in periodic structures. Besides the particular class of periodic systems, the work findings apply to a number of internally-resonant engineering structures in which components with different stiffness properties are assembled together, as may happen when a rigid main structure is joined with a set of flexible identical sub-structures. Typical examples in the civil and mechanical engineering fields are cable-stayed bridges, made of a rigid deck supported by several flexible cable <b>stays,</b> and <b>bladed</b> disks, in which several flexible radial blades are attached to a rigid rotor-dis...|$|R
5000|$|Kite-power systems {{dedicated}} to operating without its energy-harvesting elements flying to crosswind are not CWKPS. Examples help {{to clarify the}} two branches of kite-power systems. A simple symmetrical two-stick diamond kite let out to downwind flight while the system's tether pulls to turn an at-ground generator shaft is producing energy for use by flying downwind without flying to crosswind; such is a non-CWKPS. Some hefty downwind kite-power systems (DWKPS) are proposed by serious researchers; some DWKPS instruction {{is found in the}} patent literature; one trend involves the opening and closing of pilot-kite-lifted opening-and-closing parachutes to drive generators. Notice that some CWKPS, such as Jalbert parafoil working in figure-8 patterns to turn a ground-stationed generator, could be commissioned to operate fully without flying to crosswind, and the resultant kite-power system would then be a DWKPS. Differently, the CWKPS proposed by users of the autorotating <b>blades</b> <b>stay</b> necessarily as CWKPS. Magenn Power's flip-wing kite-balloon is a DWKPS. [...] Similar flip-wing rotating wings are DWKPS, e.g. that taught in Edwards and Evan patent. Benjamin Franklin's legendary pond-crossing by kite power was a simple DWKPS; he was merely dragged downwind by a downwind-flying kite. A non-CWPKS is historically illustrated by a kite-power harvesting system such as was used by Samuel Franklin Cody for man-lifting with the involved wings set in stable downwind flight without flying to crosswind.|$|R
5000|$|The Kilij, as a {{specific}} type of sabre associated with the Ottoman Turks and the Mamluks of Egypt, was recognisable by the late 15th century. The oldest surviving examples sport a long blade curving slightly from the hilt and more strongly in the distal half. The width of the <b>blade</b> <b>stays</b> narrow (with a slight taper) up until the last 30% of its length, at which point it flares out and becomes wider. This distinctive flaring tip is called a [...] "yalman" [...] (false edge) and it greatly adds to the cutting power of the sword. Ottoman sabres of the next couple of centuries were often of the Selchuk variety, though the native kilij form was also found; Iranian blades (that did not have the yalman) were fitted with Ottoman hilts. These hilts normally had slightly longer quillons to the guard, which was usually of brass or silver, and sported a rounded termination to the grips, usually made of horn, unlike that seen on Iranian swords (Iranian swords usually had iron guards and the grip terminated in a hook-shape often with a metal pommel sheathing). The finest mechanical damascus and wootz steel were often used in making of these swords. In the classical period of the Ottoman Empire, Bursa, Damascus and the Derbent regions became the most famous swordsmithing centers of the empire. Turkish blades became a major export item to Europe and Asia.|$|R
40|$|The {{primary focus}} {{of this paper is}} to {{investigate}} the effect of rotor tip gap size on how the rotor unsteady tip clearance flow structure changes in a low speed one and half stage axial compressor at near stall operation (for example, where maximum pressure rise is obtained). A Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is applied to calculate the unsteady flow field at this flow condition with both a small and a large tip gaps. The numerically obtained flow fields at the small clearance matches fairly well with the available initial measurements obtained at the Johns Hopkins University with 3 -D unsteady PIV in an index-matched test facility which renders the compressor blades and casing optically transparent. With this setup, the unsteady velocity field in the entire flow domain, including the flow inside the tip gap, can be measured. The numerical results are also compared with previously published measurements in a low speed single stage compressor (Maerz et al. [2002]). The current study shows that, with the smaller rotor tip gap, the tip clearance vortex moves to the leading edge plane at near stall operating condition, creating a nearly circumferentially aligned vortex that persists around the entire rotor. On the other hand, with a large tip gap, the clearance vortex <b>stays</b> inside the <b>blade</b> passage at near stall operation. With the large tip gap, flow instability and related large pressure fluctuation at the leading edge are observed in this one and a half stage compressor. Detailed examination of the unsteady flow structure in this compressor stage reveals that the flow instability is due to shed vortices near the leading edge, and not due to a three-dimensional separation vortex originating from the suction side of the blade, which is commonly referred to during a spike-type stall inception. The entire tip clearance flow is highly unsteady. Many vortex structures in the tip clearance flow, including the sheet vortex system near the casing, interact with each other. The core tip clearance vortex, which is formed with the rotor tip gap flows near the leading edge, is also highly unsteady or intermittent due to pressure oscillations near the leading edge and varies from passage to passage. For the current compressor stage, the evidence does not seem to support that a classical vortex breakup occurs in any organized way, even with the large tip gap. Although wakes from the IGV influence the tip clearance flow in the rotor, the major characteristics of rotor tip clearance flows in isolated or single stage rotors are observed in this one and a half stage axial compressor...|$|R
40|$|The {{turbocharger}} is {{a performance}} enhancing device which uses the {{hot exhaust gas}} mixture from the engine exit to spin the turbine blades for driving the compressor blades to compress the ambient air from the atmosphere. During the operation, the turbine blade surfaces will have severe contaminated deposit accumulations due to the usage of the low-grade diesel fuel for the engine combustion. Hence, this will adversely impact on the turbocharger operating efficiency with some significant performance losses. In this aspect, the development of efficient and cost-effective deposit removal techniques {{has become one of}} the urgent tasks for the turbocharger design and manufacture industries. Apparently, an engineering solution to the problem is to apply a built-in “online” water washing system for diesel turbocharger deposits removal. While this method has been used for a while now, the system performance is not entirely satisfactory and further improvements are very demanding. The intention of this study is to review the current know-how industry practice of deposit removal techniques, in particular the “online” water washing technique, in order to understand the underlying mechanisms. The objective is to provide detailed information and flow characteristics for turbocharger designers to improve the system performance. To achieve these targets, a research programme of combining numerical simulation and experimental test has been proposed and carried out on a medium sized diesel turbocharger model to investigate both single-phase gas mixture flow and two-phase gas/liquid flow characteristics. In the latter case, the study is focused on the droplet trajectory, the size distribution and the water droplet coverage area on the blade ring. The experimental tests were based on an in-house test rig at Napier Turbochargers. The measurements were conducted over a wide range of working conditions with and without water washing injections. The test results were used for data analysis and validation of numerical predictions. It was found that in general the water coverage area decreases with the increase of turbocharger loading speed. By using three water injectors evenly distributed in a circumferential direction, maximum ten blades have been washed (i. e. “wetted” blades), while the remaining fourteen <b>blades</b> <b>stayed</b> “dry”. This indicated that more water injectors might be needed to increase the water coverage area on the blade ring. It was also noted that the test rig employed has some limitations of test loading speeds and temperature range, preventing its application to wider operation conditions. The numerical simulations of single-phase gas mixture flow and two-phase gas/liquid flow have been carried out using a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software ANSYS-CFX with ‘ad hoc’ subroutines of the CFX Command Language (CCL). For a single-phase gas mixture flow, the numerical predicted blade leading-edge temperatures were in good agreement with the experimental measurements with max 1...|$|R
