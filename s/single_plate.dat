5|$|Millipede bodies may be {{flattened}} or cylindrical, and {{are composed}} of numerous metemeric segments, each with an exoskeleton consisting of five chitinous plates: a <b>single</b> <b>plate</b> above (the tergite), one at each side (pleurites), and a plate on the underside (sternite) where the legs attach. In many millipedes, these plates are fused to varying degrees, sometimes forming a single cylindrical ring. The plates are typically hard, being impregnated with calcium salts. Because they lack a waxy cuticle, millipedes are susceptible to water loss and must {{spend most of their}} time in moist or humid environments.|$|E
25|$|For {{passenger}} vehicle registrations, U.S. states require vehicles to display either {{one or two}} license plates (e.g., {{at the rear of}} the vehicle only or on the front and rear). In states that require two plates, limited exceptions may exist that allow for only a <b>single</b> <b>plate</b> to be displayed, such as for registration of commercial vehicles, government owned vehicles, dealer owned vehicles, or historic vehicles. In Missouri, a two plate jurisdiction, certain truck registrations actually require a <b>single</b> <b>plate</b> to be displayed, on the front of the vehicle only, leaving the rear with no license plate.|$|E

25|$|Wollaston made {{improvements}} to the galvanic battery (named after Galvani) in the 1810s. In Wollaston's battery, the wooden box was replaced with an earthenware vessel, and a copper plate was bent into a U-shape, with a <b>single</b> <b>plate</b> of zinc placed {{in the center of}} the bent copper. The zinc plate was prevented from making contact with the copper by dowels (pieces) of cork or wood. In his single cell design, the U-shaped copper plate was welded to a horizontal handle for lifting the copper and zinc plates out of the electrolyte when the battery was not in use.|$|E
25|$|The holotype, JMP-V-05-8-01, was {{discovered}} at Hengdaozi, in Sihetun, in Liaoning Province, from the Jianshangou Beds of the Yixian Formation {{dating from the}} Barremian-Aptian, about 125 million years old. It consists of a nearly complete skeleton with skull, compressed on a <b>single</b> <b>plate,</b> of an adult individual. Extensive remains of protofeathers have been preserved. In 2012 a second specimen was described, CAGS-IG-T1, of an individual larger than the holotype. The skull was about 10% longer, the feet about a third, a difference explained by positive allometry. The specimen consists of a partial skull, tail, hands, feet and ribcage. It shows filaments on the tail.|$|E
25|$|By 1837 pewter had {{replaced}} copper as a medium, and Berthiaud gives an account with an entire chapter devoted to music (Novel manuel complet de l'imprimeur en taille douce, 1837). Printing from such plates required a separate inking {{to be carried}} out cold, and the printing press used less pressure. Generally, four pages of music were engraved on a <b>single</b> <b>plate.</b> Because music engraving houses trained engravers through years of apprenticeship, very {{little is known about the}} practice. Fewer than one dozen sets of tools survive in libraries and museums. By 1900 music engravers were established in several hundred cities in the world, but the art of storing plates was usually concentrated with publishers. Extensive bombing of Leipzig in 1944, the home of most German engraving and printing firms, destroyed roughly half the world's engraved music plates.|$|E

25|$|Few archaeological {{specimens}} of helmets attributable to Byzantine manufacture {{have been discovered}} to date, though {{it is probable that}} some of the helmets found in pagan graves in the Ukrainian steppe are of ultimately Byzantine origin. A rare find of a helmet in Yasenovo in Bulgaria, dating to the 10th century, may represent an example of a distinctively Byzantine style. This rounded helmet is horizontally divided: with a brow-band constructed for the attachment of a face-covering camail, above this is a deep lower skull section surmounted by an upper skull-piece raised from a <b>single</b> <b>plate.</b> The upper part of the helmet has a riveted iron crosspiece reinforcement. A high-quality Byzantine helmet, decorated in gilt brass inlay, was found in Vatra Moldovitei in Rumania. This helmet, dating to the late 12th century, is similar to the Yasenovo helmet in having a deep lower skull section with a separate upper skull. However, this helmet is considerably taller and of a conical 'pear shape', indeed it bears some similarity in outline to the later bascinet helmets of Western Europe. The helmet has a decorative finial, and a riveted brow-reinforce (possibly originally the base-plate of a nasal). A second helmet found in the same place is very like the Russian helmet illustrated here, having an almost identical combined brow-piece and nasal, this helmet has a single-piece conical skull, which is fluted vertically, and has overall gilding. It has been characterised as a Russo-Byzantine helmet, indicative of the close cultural connection between Kievan Russia and Byzantium. A remarkably tall Byzantine helmet, of the elegant 'Phrygian cap' shape and dating to the late 12th century, was found at Pernik in Bulgaria. It has a single-piece skull with a separate brow-band and had a nasal (now missing) which was riveted to the skull.|$|E

40|$|Objective â To {{compare the}} {{incidence}} of implant failure and pelvic canal narrowing in cats after repair of ilial fractures with a single or double lateral plate technique. Study design â Retrospective clinical study. Animals â Cats (n= 80) with ilial fractures. Methods â Medical records (1996 - 2010) and radiographs were reviewed. Retrieved data included fracture type, age, weight, gender, implant type and implant failure. Pelvic canal narrowing was assessed radiographically using the Sacral Index (SI). Thirty-five fractures (42 %) were treated with a <b>single</b> lateral <b>plate</b> and 48 (58 %) with double lateral plates. Results - Significantly more implant failure (P= 0. 001) occurred in the group treated with a <b>single</b> lateral <b>plate.</b> Mean pelvic canal narrowing was significantly less (P= 0. 04) in the double lateral plates group between postoperative and follow-up radiography compared with the <b>single</b> lateral <b>plate</b> group.
