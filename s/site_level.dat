5000|$|Walter Taylor was {{the founder}} of conjunctive {{archaeology}}. He was born in Chicago and studied at Yale. He saw archaeology as a discipline that was multifaceted, and {{tried to focus on}} Anthropology and Archaeology to form a well-balanced and all-consuming study. He was frustrated by the focus of his contemporaries on typologies, chronological reconstructions, and other elements of archaeology that he saw as formalist and restricting. He put forward his polemical ideas in A Study of Archaeology, which served as a critique of culture-historical archaeology and put forward his prescription of a conjunctive archaeology. Taylor was reacting to what he saw as his contemporaries' limited use of artifacts to produce culture chronologies and identify groups as opposed to their stated goals of reconstructing prehistory. In response, he offered that archaeologists should focus more on quantitative data and spatial distributions of artifacts and features within sites. Part of this new focus on sites as units of analysis would require the collection of what might have appeared as trivial data, as well as paying better attention to things like paleoenvironmental data. All this was done with the aim of developing comparative approaches at the <b>site</b> <b>level</b> and beyond.|$|E
50|$|Trade unions, if they exist, are {{generally}} strongest {{on the plant}} or <b>site</b> <b>level</b> where the collection of membership dues takes place. The majority of union funds is also spent on this level. The most transparent finances are those of Solidarnosc. Membership subscriptions are distributed as follows: 60 per cent go to the Plant/Site Commission, 25 per cent to the Regional Board, 8 per cent to the National Commission (umbrella organisation), 5 per cent to the strike fund and 2 per cent to the sector union. OPZZ and FZZ Forum also have great problems with financing their activities. In both cases a part of subscriptions of 7 cent per month and member goes to central offices. This is by far not {{enough to keep the}} work of the umbrella organisations on a sufficiently high level. During the last few years especially Solidarnosc and OPZZ were forced to cut down on costs by closing offices and reducing staff. OPZZ seems to be in a better material situation than Solidarnosc, as it took over the larger part of the properties of trade unions dating from before 1989 (urban office properties, sanatoriums and holiday homes) and thus for years functioned on the basis of earnings from renting and leasing them. Some affiliated unions of OPZZ and Forum have similar financial sources as they have their own properties.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{not unusual}} to find Cenococcum geophilum {{mycelium}} and ectomycorrhizas in high relative frequency in soil where ectomycorrhizal tree hosts are present. Unlike many ectomycorrhizal fungi, Cenococcum geophilum readily colonizes the fine roots of most ectomycorrhizal hosts. It {{may be found in}} all forest successional stages. Unlike most ectomycorrhizal fungal species, Cenococcum geophilum appears to have no distinct vertical distribution in the organic horizons of soil [...] though it appears to prefer organic horizons to mineral soil. Cenococcum geophilum also appears to have an even horizontal spatial distribution pattern at the microscale [...] and <b>site</b> <b>level.</b> This unusual distributional pattern {{may be the result of}} wide niche breadth of Cenococcum geophilum and/or genetic variation within the species. [...] A factor that may contribute to this wide niche breadth is the species ability to tolerate a wide range of stressors. Cenococcum geophilum isolates have been shown to tolerate freezing, salinity, and heavy metal [...] stressors, but is probably best known for its ability to tolerate water stress. [...] Hasselquist et al. (2005) found evidence that suggests that increased colonization of fine roots of Douglas fir seedlings by C. geophilum may alleviate water stress of the host plant during periods of low water availability. [...] Melanin biosynthesis, which is quite high in C. geophilum, gives its hyphae the “jet-black” appearance, and has been linked with stress tolerance in fungi. [...] It may thus be a key functional trait reducing water stress in C. geophilum. Other potential traits that C. geophilum may employ for water stress tolerance include the production and accumulation of compatible osmolytes [...] and the production of heat shock proteins. Nitrogen fertilization appears to have negative effects on the abundance of C. geophilum, which may be the result of host trees allocating less carbon to ectomycorrhizal symbiosis when nitrogen in the soil becomes non-limiting to the plant growth.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} on the Australian coal industry has highlighted the difficulties the industry faces arising from reduced world coal prices, escalating production costs and overall declining levels of profitability, despite strong demand for coal – a situation that {{has been described as}} one of ‘profitless prosperity’. In response to these difficulties, management in the industry have sought, via enterprise bargaining, to increase labour flexibility and productivity and weaken union control at the mine <b>site</b> <b>level.</b> This paper seeks to empirically investigate these changes at the mine <b>site</b> <b>level</b> by examining the contents of certified agreements struck in the coal mining districts of NSW and Queensland since 1995. The analysis focuses on bargaining outcomes with respect to changing work organisation, external labour arrangements, union security and retrenchment provisions and other relevant industrial relations issues which, collectively, illustrate the extent of industrial relations change in the coal industry. We argue that the frontier of control at the mine <b>site</b> <b>level</b> has shifted considerably in favour of management during the 1990 s, although not to the extent expected...|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedPublic schools within California {{continue}} to struggle with meeting state and national accountability standards, despite recent reductions in funding and fewer resources. This study used a purposeful sample of three large suburban high schools and analyzed how each of them applied <b>site</b> <b>level</b> resources to meet the overall instructional vision not only with reduced resource, but leadership change at the superintendent level, and political turmoil within the school board. Each of the three schools was analyzed based Odden’s (2009) Ten Strategies for Doubling Student Performance, and the Evidence-Based resource allocation model (EBM) developed by Odden and Picus (2008). The research was conducted through a multi-methods approach of principal interviews, <b>site</b> <b>level</b> resource allocation data, and overall student achievement on state and national tests. The findings indicate fewer <b>site</b> <b>level</b> resources than recommended by the EBM which contributed to fewer applications of Odden’s (2009) strategies. However, the findings also support the development of high performing teacher lead teams, using common formative assessment data, to withstand political and budgetary changes {{in order to improve}} student learning...|$|E
