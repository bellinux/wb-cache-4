We <b>study</b> abstract <b>classe</b> of functions monoids for the inf-convolution struture {{and gives a}} complete description {{of the group of}} unit of such monoids. We then apply this results to obtain various versions of the Banach-Stone theorem for the inf-convolution struture in the group framework. We also give as consequence an algebraic proof of the Banach-Dieudonée theorem. Our techniques are based on a new optimization result...|$|R

40|$|Abstrac/- Time {{synchronization}} {{is essential}} for several ad-hoc network protocols and applications, such as TDMA scheduling, dolo aggregation, caching, object tracking, and security checking. Prior work on synchronization in wire-less networks has not adequately addressed rapid conver· gence and scalability requirements in dense networks serv-ing time-sensitive applications, such as sensor networks. In this paper, we propose a distributed clustering-based high-level time synchronization framework for multi-hop od-hoc networks that builds a two-tired. synchronized network. We do not make any assumptions about node capabilities (e. g.) being GPS-enabled), or the presence of reference nodes in the network. Thus, global consensus on one time value is not our goal. Rather, we assume Lhat relative node synchronization is sufficient. We <b>study</b> both <b>classe...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Bourguiba {{was first}} {{admitted}} in classe de première {{thanks to the}} help of his brother Mahmoud who solicited the headmaster's secretary, Tahar Zouiten. There, Bourguiba found, with great pleasure, his old Sadiki friend, Tahar Sfar, who <b>studied</b> in another <b>classe</b> de première. Two or three weeks later, he was summoned by Tahar Zouiten who announced the decision to downgrade him to classe de seconde. Bourguiba stated years later: [...] "Despite the chagrin caused by this downgrade, I executed the decision. But three months later, I visited Mr. Zouiten to tell him how much I was thankful to his initiative which helped me learn new disciplines I did not master in Sadiki College. I had just discovered Mathematics. I did not learn algebra or geometry in Sadiki where we were spending our mathematics classes laughing and having fun".|$|R

Mohamed lived with an Italian nurse who welcomed young Habib properly and had an important part in his improvement, by [...] "filling in his emotional void", according to Souhayr Belhassen and Sophie Bessis. His journey in there, which lasted 21 months from January 1920, was a major turning point in his life. The inhabitants of the city helped him integrate: He learned how to play cards, discussed military strategies, got interested in Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and also visited his other brother, Ahmed, in Thala where he learned horse riding. He also participated in theatrical activities. Bourguiba rehearsed with his brother, who had a passion for theater and performed on stage. The foundation of the Destour party while he was in Kef, increased Bourguiba's interest in Tunisian nationalism. He expressed his will to pursue his secondary studies and thus, study law in France, so he could struggle against the colonial power. The family council that was held to discuss this matter was a complete failure, his brothers considering him as [...] "unsuccessful" [...] and were not ready to finance his studies. Only his thirty years old single brother, Mahmoud, promised to aid him. With his support, Bourguiba was enrolled in Lycée Carnot of Tunis, in classe de seconde, because he was too weak to <b>study</b> in <b>classe</b> de première.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of khâgneux B/L and A/L go on studying {{at the university}} once they completed the khâgne, though more and more khâgneux get nowadays enrolled in grandes écoles such as business schools or engineer schools (ENSAE, ENSAI, etc.). During their <b>studies</b> at the <b>classe</b> préparatoire, students are also immatriculated at a university so that the years spent at the classe prépa are acknowledged by universities: a student having completed the hypokhâgne is acknowledged as {{being able to get}} enrolled immediately as a sophomore student at university in a chosen subject; a student having completed the khâgne can immediately enter the third and last year of the French bachelor's programme in a chosen subject. After having repeated the khâgne, the student may be granted a partial or a total bachelor's diploma equivalence. In the case of a student who has passed the written exam but failed the oral part, there is the possibility of studying any subject they have done in the written exam at post-graduate level.Besides grandes écoles and IEPs, khâgne students can also get enrolled into selective university programmes, such as magistères.|$|R
