40|$|Lakes are {{important}} water resources and integral {{parts of the}} natural ecosystem, and it is of great significance to study the evolution <b>of</b> <b>lakes.</b> The area <b>of</b> each <b>lake</b> increased and decreased {{at the same time}} in natural condition, only but the net change of lakes’ area is the result of the bidirectional evolution <b>of</b> <b>lakes.</b> In this paper, considering the effects of net fragmentation, net attenuation, swap change and spatial invariant part in lake evolution, a comprehensive evaluation indexes <b>of</b> <b>lake</b> dynamic evolution were defined,. Such degree contains three levels of measurement: 1) the swap dynamic degree (SDD) reflects the space activity <b>of</b> <b>lakes</b> in the study period. 2) the attenuation dynamic degree (ADD) reflects the net attenuation <b>of</b> <b>lakes</b> into non-lake areas. 3) the fragmentation dynamic degree (FDD) reflects the trend <b>of</b> <b>lakes</b> to be divided and broken into smaller <b>lakes.</b> Three levels <b>of</b> dynamic measurement constitute the three-dimensional "Swap - attenuation – fragmentation" dynamic evolution measurement system <b>of</b> <b>lakes.</b> To show its effectiveness, the dynamic measurement was applied to lakes in Jianghan Plain, the middle Yangtze region of China for a more detailed analysis <b>of</b> <b>lakes</b> from 1984 to 2014. In combination with spatial-temporal location characteristics <b>of</b> <b>lakes,</b> the hidden information in lake evolution in the past 30 years can be revealed...|$|R
