500|$|As {{with the}} Mr. Hooper episode, [...] "Snuffy's Parents Get a Divorce" [...] was studied {{extensively}} for comprehension and attention. After it was filmed, it was screened before a test audience of 60 children in four daycare centers. The results found several unintended negative effects. As The Christian Science Monitor said, [...] "it bombed". Despite Gordon's reassuring the Muppets Elmo, Big Bird, and Telly, children {{believed that their}} parents' arguments would lead to their divorce. They also were unsure that Snuffy and his little sister Alice's parents loved them despite the divorce, were unclear where the characters' parents lived (especially their father, who had never appeared on the show before). Many viewers also thought that Snuffy and Alice would never see their father again. According to Singer, [...] "The kids came away with negative messages... The kids misunderstood arguments. They said arguments did mean divorce. Some thought Snuffy's parents were moving away even though we <b>said</b> <b>just</b> the opposite. A number said the parents {{would no longer be}} in love with them".|$|E

2500|$|According to the Talmud, {{the reading}} of the Shema morning and evening fulfils the commandment [...] "You shall meditate therein day and night".

The reciting of the first verse of the Shema is called [...] "the acceptance of the yoke of the kingship of God" [...] (kabalat ol malchut shamayim) (Mishnah Berachot 2:5).

Richie Phillips apparently was upset when Dave Phillips called the Philadelphia Phillies' Ricky Jordan out on strikes in the fourth inning, and a replay showed the pitch to be about 6inches outside.

2500|$|Sources differ as to {{how much}} money the {{foundation}} had raised by 2007. The Palm Beach Daily News <b>said</b> <b>just</b> $20 million in April 2006.

By this time, the Newark Star-Ledger said in May 2007, Pope had pledged $8 million of her own (not LIFE Foundation) money, the DAV had pledged another $3 million, and the DAV's affiliates were raising contributions. It was also unclear just how much money was needed. [...] Sources continued to put the figure at $65 million in 2006 and early and mid-2007, although that figure had not risen appreciably in nearly five years despite inflation. Nevertheless, the ADVLMF continued to claim it would have enough money on hand to break ground on the memorial in 2008 and dedicate it in 2010.|$|E
