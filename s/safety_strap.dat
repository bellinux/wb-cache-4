25|$|Inside {{there are}} two {{platforms}} above ground level, accessed by near-vertical timber steps and hatchways in the floors. The tower framework features original components, including: 140mm x 100mm timber stud work; circular girts made from beech; a combination of diagonal timber bracing and steel spiral strapping; timber floor joists on each level supported on a circular steel angle; and floors lined with wide tongue and groove boards. A small number of timber components were replaced after the 1999 move when the tower was damaged, and some steel bracket work was installed. The steel, angled bottom plate and tie-down brackets bolting the structure to the slab also date from , with some original brackets remaining as examples. Some early timber shelving remains, {{as well as some}} of the 1940s electrical conduit, wiring and switches (no longer in use).

2500|$|Despite Wolfe's rule {{never to}} leave the brownstone on business, the stories find him leaving his home on several occasions.

[...] Although he occasionally ventures by car into the suburbs of New York City, he is loath to travel, and clutches the <b>safety</b> <b>strap</b> continually on the occasions that Archie drives him somewhere. He does not trust trains to start or to stop. As Archie says of Wolfe in The Doorbell Rang, [...] "he distrusted all machines more complicated than a wheelbarrow." ...|$|E
50|$|Most uniformed police {{officers}} usually wore {{a variation of}} the Jordan holster: sturdily designed, with no leather over the trigger guard or shrouding the hammer, and with a metal shank inside a drop loop to position the holster well below the waist so the gun butt stood away from the body and was angled forward and could easily be drawn in a big hurry when necessary. This was an excellent type of holster for quick-draw because it was difficult for the shooter to jam the gun in the holster during the draw. This type of holster usually had an over-the-hammer <b>safety</b> <b>strap</b> to lock the gun into the holster. The student was expected to unsnap the <b>safety</b> <b>strap</b> whenever he might be approaching a dangerous situation; but, if desired, McDaniel could teach him how to unsnap the <b>safety</b> <b>strap</b> {{as an integral part of}} the quick-draw without ever slowing his hand. The currently popular thumb-break <b>safety</b> <b>strap</b> is not suitable for quick-draw, because it requires the shooter to stop his hand completely while popping the strap.|$|E

50|$|For {{practicing}} quick-draw extensively, {{the very}} best bet is a Jordan holster sewn to a wide stout belt, with tie-down straps to secure {{the bottom of the}} holster firmly to your leg. It is best to prep a new quick-draw holster by putting the gun inside of six or seven gallon-size Ziploc bags and sealing each one, then wetting the holster thoroughly in a bucket of warm water with a little soap in it and jamming the gun into the holster to shape it, then letting the holster dry completely. Without the bags, the gun will be a loose fit in the holster. For uniformed police-officers, it does them good to learn how to unsnap the <b>safety</b> <b>strap,</b> which is snapped across the hammer to lock the gun into the holster, {{as an integral part of}} the quick-draw, without slowing or stopping the hand in that process. (Do not use a thumb-break <b>safety</b> <b>strap</b> for quick-draw.) A shoe-repair shop can sew a small bent-up piece of sheet metal to the bottom of the tag-end of the <b>safety</b> <b>strap</b> to hold it away from the holster and enable the extended fingers sweeping up the side of the holster to pop the snap on the <b>safety</b> <b>strap</b> so that it will fly up out of the way as the hand draws the gun.|$|E

This includes guardrails that are at least two inches on all sides, concave changing surfaces, and <b>safety</b> <b>straps.</b> Authorities also recommend keeping all necessary supplies within arms reach and to inspect the changing table before placing the child on the table. It is also important for parents to utilize safe procedures, such as proper lifting technique and using height-appropriate changing tables.|$|R
5000|$|John Netley was {{described}} as a [...] "carman" [...] (i.e. a goods wagon driver) in the census returns for the period. He was employed by Messrs Thompson, McKay and Co., who described Netley as [...] "very steady". Netley died in an accident when the wheel of his van hit an obelisk in London's Park Road, where it joins onto Baker Street, near to Clarence Gate in Regent's Park. He was thrown from his van under the hooves of the horses where his head was crushed by a wheel.

50|$|The {{two main}} {{categories}} voice prosthesis {{can be divided}} into are ‘non-indwelling’ and ‘indwelling’ voice prostheses. ‘Non-indwelling’ voice prostheses can be replaced by the patients themselves, whereas ‘indwelling’ prostheses have {{to be replaced by a}} medical professional. A non-indwelling voice prosthesis has a <b>safety</b> <b>strap</b> and may also have a string with a special safety medallion that is too wide to fall into the tracheostoma. It comes in different sizes and lengths and often has a noticeable color, e.g. blue or white to enhance visibility for self-replacement and maintenance. Disadvantages of the non-indwelling prosthesis are a certain amount of risk when inserting them by oneself and the devices have a shorter lifetime and need to be changed more often. In general it takes some practice to insert the prosthesis and the ability to take excellent care of the device. Indwelling devices have sturdier flanges and can only be replaced by a medical professional. The <b>safety</b> <b>strap</b> is cut off after insertion. The choice between ‘non-indwelling’ and ‘indwelling’ devices is really individual, depending on physical condition, maintenance and cost and can be alternated over a period of time to find out which one is most suitable.|$|E
50|$|The Sperry ball turret {{was very}} small {{in order to reduce}} drag, and was {{typically}} operated by the smallest man of the crew. To enter the turret, the turret was moved until the guns were pointed straight down. The gunner placed his feet in the heel rests and occupied his cramped station. He would put on a <b>safety</b> <b>strap</b> and close and lock the turret door. There was no room inside for a parachute, which was left in the cabin above the turret. A few gunners wore a chest parachute.|$|E
50|$|At around 6 pm on 5 August, Inspectors Ranchin and Culioli {{recovered}} a Rock-Ola M1 carbine {{from the river}} Durance. It was broken in two and had clearly been in very poor condition even before being thrown into the river. Several pieces were missing and repairs had been made using makeshift knick-knacks: the sight {{had been replaced by}} half of a 1-franc coin, while the wooden forearm covering the barrel was missing. The lever had been replaced by a Duralumin ring taken from a bicycle's identity plaque, which was fixed to the wood by a screw. The <b>safety</b> <b>strap</b> was missing and the bolt stop was broken. Therefore, {{it was more of a}} DIY handyman's weapon than that of a seasoned killer.|$|E
50|$|For Group 2/3 seats {{there is}} a system called ISOFIT which anchors the seat to the vehicle so it cannot slide around when not in use. In the case of Isofit, the child is held into the seat using the vehicle's {{existing}} seat belt system, not the <b>safety</b> seat's <b>straps.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{lower link}} {{itself is not}} {{designed}} to carry normal acceleration and braking forces, so it is located by two radius arms that run forward from each lower link to points on the (unitary construction) vehicle body, beneath the rear passenger compartment. Each radius arm attaches to its lower link at a point just outboard of the bottom spring mountings and pivots vertically about its fixing bolt. The fixing bolts pass through a small Metalastik bush, which consist of a metal sleeve held within a rubber bush. Where the radius arm meets the vehicle body, it is attached by a vertical bolt passing through a large Metalastic bush that is pressed into the forward end of the radius arm. <b>Safety</b> <b>straps</b> retain the radius arms in proximity to the vehicle body should one of the front securing bolts happen to come loose.|$|R

5000|$|In October 1914 Strange {{invented a}} <b>safety</b> <b>strap</b> {{allowing}} the observer of his Avro 504 to [...] "stand up and fire all round {{over top of}} plane and behind". He also designed and fitted a machine gun mounting to the 504, consisting of a crossbar between the central struts over which was slung a rope, allowing the Lewis to be pulled up into a position from which the observer, seating in the front cockpit, could fire backwards over Strange's head. On 22 November 1914 it was with this arrangement that Strange claimed his first victory; with Lieutenant F. Small as gunner, he attacked an Aviatik two-seater and forced it down from over Armentières to make a bumpy landing in a ploughed field just behind the British lines.|$|E
5000|$|In July 1968, four UH-1F's and 10 pilots {{from the}} 20th Helicopter Squadron, [...] "E" [...] Flight, [...] "Green Hornets," [...] arrived from Nha Trang. The [...] "new" [...] Pony Express Hueys flew {{virtually}} all the same missions as the H-3's. There were {{a few of the}} H-3 missions in Northern Laos that the Hueys were not involved in due to the extreme distance and limited range of the UH-1. On occasion, the Huey would carry a 55-gallon barrel of fuel in the cabin. If the Huey required the extra fuel, the crewchief would hook up his <b>safety</b> <b>strap,</b> step out onto the chopper's skid and hold the refueling hose as the other crewman pumped the fuel into the Huey's fuel tank. This was done at cruising altitude.|$|E
50|$|McDaniel {{broke the}} quick-draw, from a hip holster with the <b>safety</b> <b>strap</b> {{out of the}} way, down into two {{separate}} and distinct moves. In the first move, the hand sweeps in from the shooter's side to a point just beneath the gun butt, and without stopping, then changes direction and moves upward to scoop the gun {{up out of the}} holster. To accomplish this, as the student moves his hand in toward the holstered gun, he shapes his hand exactly the way little children used to do when they were playing cops-and-robbers, and pretended that their right hands were guns: the index finger (the barrel) is pointed straight ahead, the thumb (the hammer) is cocked above the index finger, and the bottom three fingers (the gun butt) are pressed together and bent 90 degrees or more to the left.|$|E
5000|$|IM (1943-1944): A {{mixture of}} Gasoline and an {{incendiary}} compound thickener. It was ignited with an M3 fuze {{attached to the}} bottle with a Timmerman <b>strap</b> <b>safety.</b> The M3 Igniter fuze assembly consisted of a fuze body, a striker, and a [...]38-caliber Blank cartridge. The Timmerman Strap was a metal band under tension around {{the surface of the}} grenade that was hooked up to a striker safety in the fuse body. (If the bottle broke prematurely, the Timmerman <b>strap</b> <b>safety</b> would prevent the striker from going off on impact.) The user pulled the safety pin from the fuse assembly and threw the bottle against the target. When the bottle broke, the Timmerman strap fell off, deactivating the <b>strap</b> <b>safety</b> and allowing the striker to engage. The fuze spring in the fuze body activated the striker, which struck the cartridge. The blank cartridge set off a flash, which ignited the liquid filler.|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} {{crampons}} is studied and a new, more comfortable, flexible crampon design is proposed. A {{brief history of}} crampons is provided and then {{the current state of}} crampon design is discussed. Two major problems in modern crampons were identified. The first big problem was that the crampons are extremely hard to use and adjust especially in cold, wet conditions. The second problem was the comfort of the crampons on the hikers feet. While this issue may seem somewhat trivial, when hikers are on a multi-day expedition they need to keep their feet in the best possible condition. Therefore, a crampon design that makes use of larger <b>safety</b> <b>straps</b> operable by a person wearing gloves is proposed. The center of the crampon itself is flexible, being made from spring steel. This allows the crampon to flex with a hiker's foot, thereby improving walking comfort. by Nicholas Fahey. Thesis (S. B.)

50|$|The {{general design}} of voice {{prosthesis}} is quite consistent, {{even though there}} are unique characteristics. A voice prosthesis has retaining flanges at each end, the ‘tracheal flange’ and ‘esophageal flange’. Those flanges can vary in size and rigidity, e.g. indwelling prostheses have larger and more rigid flanges for stability and facilitate long-term placement. The flange near the food pipe (esophageal flange) is more rigid than the tracheal flange, near the windpipe. The one-way valve can be molded in one piece with the prosthesis and is often supported by a fluoroplastic valve seat (a colored ring that is tightly secured into the shaft of the prosthesis, adding rigidity and which is radiopaque). All voice prostheses have a <b>safety</b> <b>strap,</b> which is cut off in indwelling devices after the prosthesis is put in place; in non-indwelling devices the strap is not removed and is taped to the neck. A voice prosthesis has a one-way valve near the esophageal flange that enables pulmonary air to pass into the esophagus and pharynx for sound production and prevents content from the food pipe, such as liquids or saliva, from entering the trachea.|$|E
5000|$|Models with IM filler (Gasoline {{mixed with}} an {{incendiary}} thickener) or NP filler (a mixture {{of gasoline and}} Naphtha Palmate) were fuzed with an M3 Igniter fuze attached to the bottle with a Timmerman <b>strap</b> <b>safety.</b> The M3 Igniter fuze assembly consisted of a fuze body, a striker, and a [...]38-caliber Blank cartridge.

The fuze spring in the fuze body activated the striker, which struck the cartridge. The blank cartridge set off a pyrotechnic flash, which ignited the thickened gasoline filler.|$|R
50|$|The Tower crown {{representing}} the bent of a striped ribbon façade {{consists of two}} big 41m span twisted steel arches with interim steel supports cantilevered from the central cylindrical RC core walls and 4 smaller arches-props supporting the white steel ribbons-stripes (tubular frames filled with perforated steel sheets). The twisted steel arches were designed and manufactured in Piedmont, Italy , and then delivered to Moscow in pieces by trucks and then finally assembled on the roof (bolted from inside). The parapet glazing surrounding roof open observation deck on Level 52 is made of cold bent (tempered triplex) glass with motorized foldable top elements for easy access of the BMU cradle over the parapet. The bespoke BMU system with three articulated arms crane and 300kg auxiliary hoist follows the complex twisting form of the façade in order to guarantee the proper access for maintenance and cleaning of the curtain wall. The special cradle {{has been designed to}} reach all the positions along the façade without physical impact on the curtain wall with support of <b>safety</b> <b>straps,</b> push locks and sockets incorporated in each curtain wall unit, special sticks and soft rubber rollers preventing any scratches or other damage from cradle contacts with fragile envelope of glass, pressure caps and soft aluminum cladding.|$|R
500|$|Structural fatigue was {{accelerated}} {{by at least}} a factor of eight in a low-altitude flight profile over that of high-altitude flying, requiring costly repairs to extend service life. In the early 1960s, the three-phase High Stress program was launched to counter structural fatigue, enrolling aircraft at 2,000 flying hours. Follow-up programs were conducted, such as a 2,000-hour service life extension to select airframes in 1966–1968, and the extensive Pacer Plank reskinning, completed in 1977. The wet wing introduced on G and H models was even more susceptible to fatigue, experiencing 60% more stress during flight than the old wing. The wings were modified by 1964 under ECP 1050. This {{was followed by a}} fuselage skin and longeron replacement (ECP 1185) in 1966, and the B-52 Stability Augmentation and Flight Control program (ECP 1195) in 1967. Fuel leaks due to deteriorating Marman clamps continued to plague all variants of the B-52. To this end, the aircraft were subjected to Blue Band (1957), Hard Shell (1958), and finally QuickClip (1958) programs. The latter fitted <b>safety</b> <b>straps</b> that prevented catastrophic loss of fuel in case of clamp failure. The B-52's service ceiling is officially listed as 50,000feet, but operational experience shows this is difficult to reach when fully laden with bombs. According to one source: [...] "The optimal altitude for a combat mission was around 43,000feet, because to exceed that height would rapidly degrade the planes range." ...|$|R
50|$|To {{fasten the}} binding, the spring {{assembly}} was lifted, sliding on a plastic disk. After being raised slightly it could move forward, releasing all {{tension on the}} clips. A metal clip prevented it from moving under the boot area, while also acting as a mounting spot for a <b>safety</b> <b>strap.</b> The boot could then be forced onto the angled upper area of the clips, forcing them to open outward, and then fastened by pushing the spring back down to re-apply tension. Step-in action in the S-2/3/4 series was accomplished by a small spring-loaded pin catch on the cams. When the spring assembly was lifted, the pin was forced upward into a hole on the T-arm running to the spring, holding it forward. When the skier stepped in, the pin would be pushed down and release the arm, springing the clips closed. The S-9 model improved on this using a large lever over the spring assembly that released spring pressure by pushing the spring forward when it was pushed down with a ski pole. The lever also had a finger that pressed up on the sole of the boot, helping it pop open the clips. This gave the system true step-in, step-out behaviour.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence for}} the parachute {{dates back to the}} Renaissance period. The oldest parachute design appears in an anonymous manuscript from 1470s Renaissance Italy (British Museum Add. MSS 34,113, fol. 200v), showing a free-hanging man clutching a cross bar frame attached to a conical canopy. As a <b>safety</b> measure, four <b>straps</b> run from the ends of the rods to a waist belt. The design is a marked improvement over another folio (189v), which depicts a man trying to break the force of his fall by the means of two long cloth streamers fastened to two bars which he grips with his hands. Although the surface area of the parachute design appears to be too small to offer effective resistance to the friction of the air and the wooden base-frame is superfluous and potentially harmful, the revolutionary character of the new concept is obvious.|$|R

As a <b>safety</b> measure, four <b>straps</b> run from {{the ends of the}} rods to a waist belt. Around 1485, a more advanced parachute was sketched by the polymath Leonardo da Vinci in his Codex Atlanticus (fol. 381v), which he scales in a more favorable proportion to the weight of the jumper. Leonardo's canopy was held open by a square wooden frame, altering the shape of the parachute from conical to pyramidal. The Venetian inventor Fausto Veranzio (1551-1617) modifies da Vinci's parachute sketch by keeping the square frame, but replacing the canopy with a bulging sail-like piece of cloth. This he realized decelerates the fall more effectively. Claims that Veranzio successfully tested his parachute design in 1617 by jumping from a tower in Venice cannot be substantiated; since he was around 65 years old at the time, it seems unlikely.|$|R
