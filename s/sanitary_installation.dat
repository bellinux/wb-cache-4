40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} water-related human activities, contaminative behaviour, house location, education and socio-economic status on endemic Schistosoma mansoni infection. The {{study was conducted in}} a hilry non-irrigated area of rural northeast Brazil amongst a defined population of subsistence farmers, of whom 93 % were infected by age 20. The area was mapped, water bodies were surveyed, and a detailed questionnaire was performed on each household. Infection was assessed by duplicate stool examinations using the sensitive Bell technique to quantify egg excretion. For each household, and index of intensity of infection was computed by grouping individual log-transformed egg counts as an age-sex adjusted Z score. Few households had a <b>sanitary</b> <b>installation</b> or a domestic water supply. However, neither water-contact nor contaminative behavior were indiscriminate. The people made considerable effort to defaecate far from a water source, to obtain household drinking water from the cleanest source, and to bathe only at certain sites where privacy is assured. Land ownership and literacy correlated poorly with the household index of intensity of infection. The key influence on infection status was the relative location of the house and snail-free or snail colonized water sources. In this area, a safe domestic water supply is the critical input needed to achieve definitive control of endemic Schistosomiasis...|$|E

40|$|Requirements {{regarding}} efficient {{energy use}} in buildings {{are becoming more}} and more strict. New ideas and technologies are constantly sought to face the challenge of reducing global CO 2 emissions. The building sector accounts for a large part of energy use. The potential for more efficient energy use in this sector is significant and will also contribute towards reduced CO 2 emissions. This master thesis is a continuation of a project work report written in collaboration with Ida Karin Aur&# 229;en during the fall semester of 2012. A prototype of a leisure home was developed where <b>sanitary</b> <b>installations</b> were kept frost proof throughout the year without the use of primary energy. This was achieved by placing <b>sanitary</b> <b>installations</b> within well-insulated internal zones, and by using an active solar heating system and heat exchange with the ground. The goal of this thesis is to improve the model developed in the project work report. The main focus is to improve the design of the solar heating system to better approximate a realistic situation. Aur&# 229;en&# 146;s master thesis focused on the interaction between the leisure building and surrounding ground, and the ground model developed in her report is further used in this thesis. The leisure building consists of two floors and is constructed of poorly insulated log walls. Each floor has a thermally insulated internal zone where <b>sanitary</b> <b>installations</b> are deemed installed. The goal is to maintain frost proof conditions throughout the year within the internal zones to avoid damages to <b>sanitary</b> <b>installations.</b> The idea is to promote seasonal heat storage by storing heat collected during sunny periods in thermal mass located below the building. The desired effect is that the heat transfer is reversed during cold, dark winter months, so that stored heat is released upwards and into the leisure building, preventing formation of frost in the internal zones. The dynamic simulation tool ESP-r (Environmental System Performance Research) is used to analyze the leisure building. The interactions between the building and the ground are modeled using a submerged basement zone defined with a BASESIMP configuration. BASESIMP performs quasi 3 -dimensional heat transfer calculations between a building and the ground. BASESIMP does not account for heat storage. The heat storage potential in the ground is analyzed through the internal ground floor construction. The floor is modeled as a thermally massive concrete slab with high density and high specific heat capacity. Heat storage calculations are performed based on heat stored in this concrete slab. The solar heating system is built up using the plants and systems network in ESP-r. The system contains three components; flat plate solar collector, circulation pump and hydronic floor. The hydronic floor component is a water-based floor heating circuit and is embedded within the concrete slab. Heat from the solar collector is transferred to the hydronic floor heating the slab below the internal zones. Towards the end of the winter, the remaining energy stored in the slab, and the incoming solar radiation injected to the slab, are too limited to make a significant heat contribution to the internal zones. Therefore, heat collected from January 1 st to April 30 th is injected directly to zone air of the internal first floor. The leisure home is planned located in southern mountain regions in Norway. ESP-r does not have available climate data for this area, and therefore climate data from &# 214;stersund, Sweden has been used as an approximation. The building has also been tested with climate data from Fornebu, Norway which is a typical coastal region in the south of Norway. Different parameters have been altered to optimize the model with regards to raising the minimum temperatures in the internal zones. Results show that the internal zones maintain much more stable conditions throughout the year than the outer zones. This shows that isolating <b>sanitary</b> <b>installations</b> within well-insulated internal zones can be a major advantage in the design process to reduce the amount of energy needed to keep the facilities frost free. A south-oriented solar collector with an area of 2 m 2, and an slope of 70 &# 176; achieves sufficient energy for frost proof conditions for both locations. The minimum temperatures in the internal ground- and first floor are 5. 29 &# 176;C and 3. 10 &# 176;C with &# 214;stersund climate data. The delivered energy from the hydronic floor component to the concrete slab, turns out to be 482 kWh with &# 214;stersund climate data, and 547 kWh with Fornebu climate data, with a collector efficiency of 68 %. Results show that heat collected in the spring and summer significantly affect the minimum temperatures occurring around mid-February in the following year. For further studies and optimization of the model, the interactions between the heat storage and surrounding ground should be studied more thoroughly. The effect which snow may have on the ground conditions should also be studied. Evacuated tube solar collectors are probably more suited for Scandinavian climate than flat plate collectors as used in this thesis. The plant database in ESP-r has no option to model evacuated tube collectors. The effect of such could be studied with another simulation tool. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{extensive}} use of centrifugal pumps in mining, potable water supply and <b>sanitary</b> <b>installations</b> potentially present an opportunity for energy savings through pump efficiency monitoring.

40|$|Abstract Background Stenotrophomonas maltophilia ubiquitously {{occurs in}} the {{hospital}} environment. This opportunistic pathogen can cause severe infections in immunocompromised hosts such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients. Between February and July 2016, a cluster of four patients on the HSCT unit suffered from S. maltophilia bloodstream infections (BSI). Methods For epidemiological investigation we retrospectively identified the colonization status of patients admitted to the ward during this time period and performed environmental monitoring of shower heads, shower outlets, washbasins and toilets in patient rooms. We tested antibiotic susceptibility of detected S. maltophilia isolates. Environmental and blood culture samples were subjected to whole genome sequence (WGS) -based typing. Results Of four patients with S. maltophlilia BSI, three {{were found to be}} colonized previously. In addition, retrospective investigations revealed two patients being colonized in anal swab samples but not infected. Environmental monitoring revealed one shower outlet contaminated with S. maltophilia. Antibiotic susceptibility testing of seven S. maltophlia strains resulted in two trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resistant and five susceptible isolates, however, not excluding an outbreak scenario. WGS-based typing did not result in any close genotypic relationship among the patients’ isolates. In contrast, one environmental isolate from a shower outlet was closely related to a single patient’s isolate. Conclusion WGS-based typing successfully refuted an outbreak of S. maltophilia on a HSCT ward but uncoverd that <b>sanitary</b> <b>installations</b> can be an actual source of S. maltophilia transmissions...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{occurrence}} of slimy black biofilms on water taps was reported from various drinking water supply areas in Germany. In {{the course of the}} investigations presented here, the herpotrichiellaceous black yeast Exophiala lecanii-corni could be identified as the main contributor to these biofilms. This species could not be detected in any sample taken from corresponding public drinking water production, treatment and distribution facilities, but was found to be common in sinks of <b>sanitary</b> <b>installations.</b> Thus, retrograde contamination of the water taps as it is known for Pseudomonas aeruginosa appears to be likely. An important cofactor {{in the formation of the}} respective biofilms seems to be volatile organic compounds from indoor air, which serve the fungi as carbon and energy source. Comparative nephelometrically recorded growth kinetics with E. lecanii-corni showed that acetic acid and ethanol, common components of cleaning agents (descalers) and disinfectants, can be utilized by this fungi already at low concentrations. Lab experiments under otherwise optimal nutrient conditions revealed a growth-promoting effect of phosphate at a concentration of 0. 75 mg/L PO 43 - and higher. SDS turned out to be a very effective alternative to conventional aggressive disinfectants for biofilm control and elimination.
