5|$|The pieces {{relating}} to Ireland {{are those of}} a public nature; in which the Dean appears, as usual, in the best light, because they do honour to his heart {{as well as to}} his head; furnishing some additional proofs, that, though he was very free in his abuse of the inhabitants of that country, as well natives as foreigners, he had their interest sincerely at heart, and perfectly understood it. His sermon upon Doing Good, though peculiarly adapted to Ireland and Wood's designs upon it, contains perhaps the best motives to patriotism that were ever delivered within <b>so</b> <b>small</b> a compass.|$|E
5|$|The {{primitive}} early mines of Cornwall and Devon {{probably were}} operated by local extended families, with the men, {{women and children}} all working. Men and boys probably worked both above the surface and below ground, and women and girls worked only above ground; there is no archaeological evidence for women and children working underground in Bronze Age Britain, although some mines from the period contain tunnels <b>so</b> <b>small</b> that only children or very short adults could have worked in them.|$|E

5|$|Tornadoes {{normally}} rotate cyclonically (when {{viewed from}} above, this is counterclockwise {{in the northern}} hemisphere and clockwise in the southern). While large-scale storms always rotate cyclonically due to the Coriolis effect, thunderstorms and tornadoes are <b>so</b> <b>small</b> that the direct influence of the Coriolis effect is unimportant, as indicated by their large Rossby numbers. Supercells and tornadoes rotate cyclonically in numerical simulations even when the Coriolis effect is neglected. Low-level mesocyclones and tornadoes owe their rotation to complex processes within the supercell and ambient environment.|$|E
5|$|Denning {{was born}} on 23 January 1899 in Whitchurch, Hampshire, to Charles Denning, a draper, and his wife Clara Denning (née Thompson). He was one of six children; his older brother Reginald Denning later became a noted staff officer with the British Army, {{and his younger brother}} Norman Denning became Director of Naval Intelligence and Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Intelligence). Denning was born two months earlier than {{expected}} and almost died at birth; he was <b>so</b> <b>small</b> and weak that he was nicknamed 'Tom Thumb' and could fit in a pint pot. He was named after Alfred the Great by his sister Marjorie, and was baptised on 23 April 1899 at All Hallows Church, Whitchurch.|$|E
5|$|Granule cells receive all {{of their}} input from mossy fibers, but outnumber them by 200 to 1 (in humans). Thus, the {{information}} in the granule cell population activity state is the same as {{the information in the}} mossy fibers, but recoded in a much more expansive way. Because granule cells are <b>so</b> <b>small</b> and so densely packed, it is difficult to record their spike activity in behaving animals, so there is little data to use as a basis for theorizing. The most popular concept of their function was proposed in 1969 by David Marr, who suggested that they could encode combinations of mossy fiber inputs. The idea is that with each granule cell receiving input from only 4–5 mossy fibers, a granule cell would not respond if only a single one of its inputs were active, but would respond if more than one were active. This combinatorial coding scheme would potentially allow the cerebellum to make much finer distinctions between input patterns than the mossy fibers alone would permit.|$|E

A US plane attempted the drop, but the perimeter was <b>so</b> <b>small</b> and the slopes so steep that virtually all the supplies went into North Korean hands. The men in the perimeter did, however, recover from a drop made later at 19:00 some supplies and ammunition. Private First Class Joseph R. Ouellette, of H Company, left the perimeter to gather weapons, ammunition, and grenades from the North Korean dead. On several occasions he was attacked, and on one such occasion a North Korean soldier suddenly attacked Ouellette, who killed the North Korean in hand-to-hand combat.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people with}} TBI who die do so {{within minutes of}} the injury, due to {{complications}} such as pneumothorax and insufficient airway and to other injuries that occurred at the same time. Most late deaths that occur in TBI are attributed to sepsis or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). If the condition is not recognized and treated early, serious complications {{are more likely to}} occur; for example, pneumonia and bronchiectasis may occur as late complications. Years can pass before the condition is recognized. Some TBI are <b>so</b> <b>small</b> {{that they do not have}} significant clinical manifestations; they may never be noticed or diagnosed and may heal without intervention.|$|E

His wife Deborah Nadoolman purchased most of the costumes at local thrift stores, and she and Judy Belushi made the party togas. Landis and Bruce McGill staged a scene for reporters visiting the set where the director pretended to be angry at the actor for being difficult on the set. Landis grabbed a breakaway pitcher and smashed it over McGill's head. He {{fell to the ground}} and pretended to be unconscious. The reporters were completely fooled, and when Landis asked McGill to get up, he refused to move.|$|E

50|$|The island {{served as}} a major trading depot, {{unloading}} goods from Saint-Domingue (Haiti), Mexico, Cuba and France, and collecting furs in a short-lived fur trade. Mobile Bay itself, before a channel was dredged, was too shallow, and its sand bars too shifting and treacherous, for ocean-going vessels to travel up the bay and Mobile River to Fort Louis de La Louisiane. <b>So,</b> <b>smaller</b> boats carried cargo within Mobile Bay to and from Dauphin Island.|$|R
5|$|The last pair of {{protected}} cruisers {{built by the}} Italian Navy was intended for colonial service, and were based on experience from Calabria. They were given a relatively heavy main battery for their small size and a long cruising range, {{at the expense of}} armor protection and speed. The ships were <b>so</b> <b>small</b> that they could be built on the same slipway and launched the same day. Since they had been launched less than a week before hostilities broke {{out at the end of}} July 1914, fitting-out work was delayed by a steel shortage, particularly after Italy entered the war. Campania and Basilicata initially served in Libya; neither had eventful careers. The latter vessel was destroyed by a boiler explosion in Tewfik on 13 August 1919. Campania was reclassified as a gunboat in 1921 and became a training ship in 1932. She ultimately was sold for scrap in 1937.|$|E
5|$|To {{record the}} album, Jackson {{suggested}} a small studio located outside of Washington, D.C. in Silver Spring, Maryland. The sessions {{took place in}} September and October 1973 at Silver Spring's D Sound Studios. According to Scott-Heron, the studio's main room was <b>so</b> <b>small</b> that when the two musicians recorded, Jackson was forced out next to the cooler, playing flute in the studio's hallway while Scott-Heron sang in the main room. However, Scott-Heron felt comfortable in the small studio. Jose Williams was enlisted as the recording engineer for the album. Williams assisted Scott-Heron and Jackson, who were credited for production under the title Perpis-Fall Music, Inc., with production, and he engineered the album's recordings entirely himself.|$|E
5|$|Toriyama was {{commissioned}} {{to illustrate the}} characters and monsters for the first Dragon Quest video game (1986) in order to separate it from other role-playing games of the time. He has since worked on every title in the series. For each game Yuji Horii first sends rough sketches of the characters with their background information to Toriyama, who then re-draws them. Lastly, Horii approves the finished work. Toriyama explained in 1995 that for video games, because the sprites are <b>so</b> <b>small,</b> {{as long as they}} have a distinguishing feature so people can tell which character it is, he can make complex designs without concern of having to reproduce it like he usually would in manga. Besides the character and monster designs, Toriyama also does the games' packaging art and, for , the boats and ships. The series' Slime character, which has become a sort of mascot for the franchise, is considered to be one of the most recognizable figures in gaming.|$|E

5|$|Rupture of the trachea or {{bronchus}} is {{the most}} common type of blunt injury to the airway. It is difficult to determine the incidence of TBI: in as many as 30–80% of cases, death occurs before the person reaches a hospital, and these people may not be included in studies. On the other hand, some TBI are <b>so</b> <b>small</b> that they do not cause significant symptoms and are therefore never noticed. In addition, the injury sometimes is not associated with symptoms until complications develop later, further hindering estimation of the true incidence. However, autopsy studies have revealed TBI in 2.5–3.2% of people who died after trauma. Of all neck and chest traumas, including people that died immediately, TBI is estimated to occur in 0.5–2%. An estimated 0.5% of polytrauma patients treated in trauma centers have TBI. The incidence is estimated at 2% in blunt chest and neck trauma and 1–2% in penetrating chest trauma. Laryngotracheal injuries occur in 8% of patients with penetrating injury to the neck, and TBI occurs in 2.8% of blunt chest trauma deaths. In people with blunt trauma who do reach a hospital alive, reports have found incidences of 2.1% and 5.3%. Another study of blunt chest trauma revealed an incidence of only 0.3%, but a mortality rate of 67% (possibly due in part to associated injuries). The incidence of iatrogenic TBI (that caused by medical procedures) is rising, and the risk may be higher for women and the elderly. TBI results about once every 20,000 times someone is intubated through the mouth, but when intubation is performed emergently, the incidence may be as high as 15%.|$|E
