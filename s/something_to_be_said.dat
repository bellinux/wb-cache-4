500|$|But Eustace Roskill {{cautions}} that [...] "It {{would be wrong}} to judge Stevenson simply by the notoriety of a few cases.... he showed great mercy to those whom he saw to be victims rather than aggressors." [...] In the early 1970s, while conducting training sessions in sentencing for newly appointed recorders, Stevenson summed up his attitude: [...] "You sentence off the top of your head. If the man's a shit, down he goes. If there's <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for him, you do your best not to put him inside." [...] Despite his stern and authoritarian reputation, in the 1970s he sometimes submitted letters to the Court of Appeal supporting the reduction of his sentences.|$|E

[...] She also stated that although the song is not [...] "groundbreaking" [...] it is [...] "a lively and exuberant track that people are bound to bop away to". Redman concluded {{that it is better}} than Pitbull's [...] "We Are One (Ole Ola)", which serves as the official song of the tournament. Mike Wass of website Idolator wrote, [...] "there's <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for consistency and Ricky sure knows how to knock out a summery smash with generic Spanglish lyrics that probably sound pretty inspiring after a couple of Coronas."

500|$|Critics {{applauded the}} growing {{relationship}} between Andrea and Shane, {{as well as}} Dale's confrontation with Shane. Despite describing them as an [...] "unlikely pairing", Meslow asserted that it was superior to the storyline between Andrea and Dale. [...] "There's <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for the occasional post-apocalyptic tryst, which allows two characters who've experienced almost nothing but misery to have, even for a moment, something that resembles joy," [...] he articulated. Meslow retorted that it was wise to underplay the tryst between Shane and Andrea, which he predicted would not lead to anything serious. Venable wrote: [...] " [...] Dale’s lack of personality traits, beyond being the wise sage who gets in everyone’s business, makes him an unpredictable foe in my book, and could be as interesting as Shane’s violent selfishness." [...] Morgan Jeffrey of Digital Spy avouched that Shane continued {{to be an interesting}} character; [...] "Just as we were beginning to like him again, he murdered Otis in cold blood. And it seems like his downward spiral is set to continue—he's threatening poor Dale and embarking on an ill-advised affair with Andrea." ...|$|E

500|$|Regarding the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards performance, Billboards Brad Wete said: [...] "There’s <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> about {{simplicity}} when whatever’s {{simply being}} done is awesome. Bruno Mars never moved {{more than three}} steps in any direction during his performance. His voice soared and his passion was palpable as he performed". He concluded, [...] "when his time came, Mars left his mark". Mathew Jacobs of The Huffington Post believes that [...] "the jazzy new song marked one of the night's tamer moments". He praised Mars performance by saying he [...] "offered a brand of artistry unmatched by {{the bulk of the}} telecast." [...] Grading the performances of the show, the staff from Entertainment Weekly gave Mars' performance an A-, describing it as [...] "The most elegantly designed and executed performance of the evening". MTV News' Brenna Ehrlich classified the 2013 MTV Europe Music Awards performance as a [...] "show that rivaled anything you'd find in the city's famous — and infamous — Red Light District". The UK edition of The Huffington Post commented that despite Mars' voice being on top form, it was the pole-dancer performance who stole the show. Other performers, such as Ed Sheeran and Adam Lambert praised the interpretation by calling it an amazing performance and noticing Mars' vocals, respectively. Hilary Duff called [...] "Gorilla" [...] a [...] "straight baby making music".|$|E

Cherry revealed, [...] "they {{come on the}} street; they seem like nice people — but they've got a secret. And it's pretty gothic. It's real and human and awful {{all at the same}} time." [...] Another scene featuring the Applewhite family, in which Betty brings food to a prisoner in their basement, was cut from this episode but was used in the second season premiere, [...] "Next". Cherry's inspiration for the Lynette storyline came from his own childhood experience when his mother returned to work. He commented: [...] "The predicament of any working woman is that you can love your career, but there is <b>something...</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for getting to stay home every day with your kids, and you don't want anyone else to be better at it than you are. Felicity Huffman expressed satisfaction with how her storyline was handled, explaining that Lynette [...] "didn't deal with [...] in the most straightforward way, but she was fighting for her family. They were noble motives." [...] While discussing the courtroom scene in which Carlos attacks John, Ricardo Antonio Chavira commented: [...] "People can see the full rage that is in my character. I'm yelling at him, 'I'm gonna kill you'... Then I broke into Spanish: [...] "Yo voy a matar!"... I just went for it... Then I looked, and Jesse [...] had the most honest look of sheer terror. I think I scared the living shit out of him." ...|$|E
500|$|Alan Scherstuhl of The Village Voice {{wrote in}} a {{positive}} review that [...] "this [...] pushes right past competent into mostly legitimately enjoyable" [...] but added that [...] "the movie is still dumb as catbutt. It's an honest and accomplished dumbness, however, where the stupidest stuff seems to be there because the movie would be less fun without it." [...] The Hollywood Reporters Todd McCarthy was critical about the film's use of 3D and accurate reflection of the franchise's comic book and cartoon origins, but predicted it would still earn better than its predecessor, [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a grade of [...] "B-", calling it [...] "well-executed technocratic action fluff" [...] and commented: [...] "In its dehumanized and trivial way, it's a triumph of razor-sharp, hyper-violent style over formulaic substance ... Hollywood has now evolved {{to the point that}} it can deliver these kinds of thrills with maximum brute force and keep the impact so light that the result can still be regarded as a 'harmless' diversion for 14-year-olds." [...] Glen Heath Jr. of Slant Magazine gave it two out of four stars, criticizing the film's [...] "cut-happy style" [...] and plot, but lauding the action sequences and Chu's direction as [...] "poetry in high-speed motion." [...] Writing for Indiewire's The Playlist Blog, Todd Gilchrist gave the film a [...] "B-" [...] and wrote: [...] "As one might expect, there are more than a handful of loose ends once justice has been served, but there’s <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for a film which aims to please in a sincere and straightforward way, without attempting to be the biggest ever.

In Suede's early days when Justine Frischmann was still a member and was dating Blur's Damon Albarn, the lyrics of her ex-partner Anderson were conveying a more depressing meaning. He has noted that the songs [...] "Pantomime Horse" [...] and B-side [...] "He's Dead" [...] were {{the product of an}} unhappy mind and that he could not have written such songs if he had been happy. Anderson states, [...] "when it comes to writing, there's <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> about being unhappy.

2500|$|During {{the years}} of the Republic, Augustus claimed he [...] "found the city in brick and left it in marble". While chances are high that this was an exaggeration, there is <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for the influx of marble use in Roman Forum from 63 BC onwards. During Augustus reign, the Forum was {{described}} to have been [...] "a larger, freer space than was the Forum of imperial times." [...] The Forum began to take on even more changes upon the arrival of Julius Casear who drew out extensive plans for the market hub. While Casear's death came prematurely, the ideas himself, as well as Augustus had in regards to the Forum proved to be the most influential for years to come. According to Walter Dennison's The Roman Forum As Cicero Saw It, the author writes that [...] "the diverting of public business to the larger and splendid imperial fora erected in the vicinity resulted in leaving the general design of the Forum Romanum".|$|E

Clash gave Skeleton Tree a nine-out-of-ten rating, with reviewer Josh Gray praising Cave and Ellis' songwriting and arrangements and summarising the album as [...] "a stark, beautiful rendering of deep, profound pain." [...] Paula Mejia wrote in Paste that [...] "Skeleton Tree strips down embellishments and brings to the forefront sinister bass lines and a synthesizer that will widen the tear in your heart a little more with every note"; Mejia concluded that [...] "there's <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> about Skeleton Tree and its starkness, which is as familiar as life and death, an elegy, and a hell of a thing to forget", rating the album nine out of ten.

[...] Discussing all the Titans rookies (including Ringer), offensive coordinator Mike Heimer-dinger said [...] "Right now, you can tell they're all rookies. But that's about it." [...] Ringer was one of three Titans rookies who remained unsigned trough July 20. Bruce Tollner, Ringer's agent, said of signing Ringer “We are continuing to talk with the Titans, and hopefully we should have something done pretty soon." [...] However, Ringer and the Titans agreed to a multi-year deal on July 21, 2009. His base salary is expected to be $310,000. Titans' running backs coach Earnest Byner said of the running backs, “Each one knows that they're competing for playing time and a position on this team, so there's <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> about that.” He also said of Ringer, “Bringing in Javon has definitely added to the mix because, right away, guys know he's something to reckon with because they see what he's done out here." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 20 Y.O. is {{composed}} by eleven songs, an introduction, three interludes and an outro. It starts off with Jackson stating [...] "There's <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for not saying anything. I've covered {{a lot in}} my 20 years. And I've uncovered a lot" [...] in its intro. The opening song, second single [...] "So Excited" [...] featuring rapper Khia, is a hip hop track which samples the drum break and turntable scratches from Herbie Hancock's 1983 song [...] "Rockit". In the song, Jackson promises submission for her lover, singing, [...] "If you like it then I’ll do it/I’ll go head to toe" [...] and [...] "I'm-a keep your body thumping, baby". [...] "Show Me" [...] follows, with Jackson spelling its title throughout the song. The fourth song, [...] "Get It Out Me", is a dance song which was noted to feature Jackson's vocals sounding like her brother Michael's ones. [...] The following song is [...] "Do It 2 Me". It marks a return to Jackson's conversational style; in the song, She is searching for her lover: [...] "My first and only call is to you, time after time, babe, throughout my life". Its music is punctuated by handclaps and by low swoops of a string section. Sixth song [...] "This Body" [...] lyrically is about men who have appreciation with Jackson's appearances in magazines. She addresses her fans in the line [...] "Just had to buy me, had to try me, oooh, you're {{in love with the}} hottest girl in the magazine". The song brings sinuous and dark beats incorporating a rhythmic pattern of heavy breathing and the sound of a jet taking off, which was noted to be a metaphor.|$|E
