This entire discrepancy between one social fact and all those which accompany it, and the radical opposition between its nature and the progressive movement which is the boast of the modern world, and which has successively swept away everything else of an analogous character, surely affords, to a conscientious observer of human tendencies, serious matter for reflection. It raises a primâ facie presumption on the unfavourable side, far outweighing any which custom and usage could in such circumstances create on the favourable; and should at least suffice to make this, like the choice between republicanism and royalty, a balanced question.|$|E

60|$|No {{criticism}} upon either Mr. Carlyle or {{any other}} modern historian, possessed of speculative quality, would be in any sense complete which should leave out of sight {{his view of the}} manner and significance of the break-up of the old European structure. The historian is pretty sure to be guided in his estimate of the forces which have contributed to dissolution in the past, by the kind of anticipation which he entertains of the probable course of reconstruction. Like Comte, in his ideas of temporal reconstruction, Mr. Carlyle goes back to something like the forms of feudalism for the model of the industrial organisation of the future; but in the spiritual order he is as far removed as possible from any semblance of that revival of the old ecclesiastical forms without the old theological ideas, which is the corner-stone of Comte's edifice. To the question whether mankind gained or lost by the French Revolution, Mr. Carlyle nowhere gives a clear answer; indeed, on this subject more even than any other, he clings closely to his favourite method of simple presentation, streaked with dramatic irony. No writer shows himself more alive to the enormous moment to all Europe of that transaction; but we hear no word from him on the question whether we have more reason to bless or curse an event that interrupted, either subsequently to retard or to accelerate, the transformation of the West from a state of war, of many degrees of <b>social</b> <b>subordination,</b> of religious privilege, of aristocratic administration, into a state of peaceful industry, of equal international rights, of social equality, of free and equal tolerance of creeds. That this process was going on prior to 1789 is undeniable. Are we really nearer to the permanent establishment of the new order, for what was done between 1789 and 1793? or were men thrown off the right track of improvement by a movement which turned exclusively on abstract rights, which dealt with men's ideas and habits as if they were instantaneously pliable before the aspirations of any government, and which by its violent and inconsiderate methods drove all these who should only have been friends of order into being the enemies of progress as well? There are many able and honest and republican men who in their hearts suspect that the latter of the two alternatives is the more correct description of what has happened. Mr. Carlyle is as one who does not hear the question. He draws its general moral lesson from the French Revolution, and with clangorous note warns all whom it concerns, from king to churl, that imposture must come to an end. But for the precise amount and kind of dissolution which the West owes to it, for the political meaning of it, as distinguished from its moral or its dramatic significance, we seek in vain, finding no word on the subject, nor even evidence of consciousness that such word is needed.|$|E

40|$|Knowledge {{is one of}} the key {{determinants}} in {{the growth}} and competitiveness of modern enterprises. Hence, it is essential to analyse the factors that induce employees to exchange knowledge. The problem of sharing an intangible asset — in this case, the knowledge of individuals — can be viewed from many perspectives: psychological, economic, organisational, sociological and technological. The aim of this article is to explore selected social psychology theories and to analyse the incentives for people to share knowledge. The article attempts to interpret the willingness to share knowledge through the Social Exchange Theory, the Social Impact Theory, the Theory of Reasoned Action and the Theory of Planned Behaviour. This analysis leads to the following conclusions: •we share our knowledge and expect a return; •we share our knowledge when we believe that the benefits of this action outweigh the costs; •we are pushed to share knowledge by the power of empathy; •workers’ willingness to share knowledge is influenced by three <b>social</b> processes: <b>subordination,</b> identification and internalisation; •the decision to share knowledge is preceded by an intention formed under the influence of an individual attitude towards that behaviour, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control; and •the decision to share knowledge is also influenced by additional components, including the knowledge and skills to implement this behaviour, environmental limitations, behavioural emphasis and habits...|$|R

In this essay we examine the representation of migrants and the migration process from the viewpoints of both origin and destination. A content analysis of newspaper articles published in Guatemala and in Los Angeles revealed that the Guatemalan media present emigration to the United States as a process embedded in global economic circumstances. Migration is depicted as an option of escape Guatemala’s economic crisis. American media, on the other hand, pay little attention these global circumstances but present migration mostly as a national and local issue. While immigrants are valued as labor, they are rejected as human beings. We suggest that these representations play a role in mobilizing the departure of migrants from Guatemala and in legitimating the <b>social</b> and economic <b>subordination</b> of the same migrants in the United States. ...|$|R

50|$|There seems {{no doubt}} that the tenure of the praetorian prefecture, the quintessential office of the Imperial autocracy, {{together}} with full membership of the Senate was regarded as deeply transgressive of social norms as established by the constitutional settlement of Augustus by which the Emperor nominally shared his authority with the Roman Senate. During the High Empire (i.e. prior to the reign of Diocletian) the extent to which individual princes maintained the <b>social</b> <b>subordination</b> of the men they entrusted with the Equestrian Prefectures to the senatorial holders of the Great Magistracies inherited from the Republic and especially to the consulate, was regarded as a measure of their fidelity to the legacy of the first Emperor.

[...] Yet counters De Beauvoir that despite having the same human-being status as men, women have a unique sexual identity different from men. In feminist definition, Women are the Other (but not the Hegelian Other) and are not existentially defined by the demands of Man. Women are the social Other who unknowingly accept subjugation as part of subjectivity.

The main objective of this paper is that of adapting and validating the Social Dominance Orientation Scale, in order to analyze its dimensionality and thus verifydifferences in accordance with the gender of participants. To this end, we collected a non-probabilistic sample of college students from Buenos Aires (N= 1201), with different gender and age.

40|$|Via a {{wide range}} of case studies, this book {{examines}} new forms of resistance to social injustices in contemporary Western societies. Resistance requires agency, and agency is grounded in notions of the subject and subjectivity. How do people make sense of their subjectivity as they are constructed and reconstructed within relations of power? What kinds of subjectivities are needed to struggle against forms of dominance and claim recognition? The participants in the case studies are challenging forms of dominance and subordination grounded in class, race, culture, nationality, sexuality, religion, age, disability and other forms of social division. It is a premise of this book that new and/or reconstructed forms of subjectivity are required to challenge <b>social</b> relations of <b>subordination</b> and domination. Thus, the transformation of subjectivity as well as the restructuring of oppressive power relations is necessary to achieve social justice. By examining the construction of subjectivity of particular groups through an intersectional lens, the book aims to contribute to theoretical accounts of how subjects are constituted and how they can develop a critical distance from their positioning...|$|R

50|$|The HPA axis is {{a feature}} of mammals and other vertebrates. For example, {{biologists}} studying stress in fish showed that <b>social</b> <b>subordination</b> leads to chronic stress, related to reduced aggressive interactions, to lack of control, and to the constant threat imposed by dominant fish. Serotonin (5HT) {{appeared to be the}} active neurotransmitter involved in mediating stress responses, and increases in serotonin are related to increased plasma α-MSH levels, which causes skin darkening (a social signal in salmonoid fish), activation of the HPA axis, and inhibition of aggression. Inclusion of the amino acid L-tryptophan, a precursor of 5HT, in the feed of rainbow trout made the trout less aggressive and less responsive to stress. However, the study mentions that plasma cortisol was not affected by dietary L-tryptophan. The drug LY354740 (also known as Eglumegad, an agonist of the metabotropic glutamate receptors 2 and 3) has been shown to interfere in the HPA axis, with chronic oral administration of this drug leading to markedly reduced baseline cortisol levels in bonnet macaques (Macaca radiata); acute infusion of LY354740 resulted in a marked diminution of yohimbine-induced stress response in those animals.|$|E

Upon setting a foundation regarding the history and constitutional underpinnings of immigrant detention and presenting a snapshot of the current state of detention, the Article then focuses on the corporatization of incarceration and immigration detention. Further, the profiteering—immigration detention intersection is placed within the context of subordination theory.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recommended}} to group-house male laboratory mice {{because they are}} ‘social animals’, but male mice do not naturally share territories and aggression can be a serious welfare problem. Even without aggression, not all animals within a group {{will be in a}} state of positive welfare. Rather, many male mice may be negatively affected by the stress of repeated <b>social</b> defeat and <b>subordination,</b> raising concerns about welfare and also research validity. However, individual housing may not be an appropriate solution, given the welfare implications associated with no social contact. An essential question is whether it is in the best welfare interests of male mice to be group- or singly housed. This review explores the likely impacts—positive and negative—of both housing conditions, presents results of a survey of current practice and awareness of mouse behavior, and includes recommendations for good practice and future research. We conclude that whether group- or single-housing is better (or less worse) in any situation is highly context-dependent according to several factors including strain, age, social position, life experiences, and housing and husbandry protocols.

Recently, these legal advantages - which include, but are not limited to, economic support such as tax and pension benefits - have been extended in some areas of Canadian law to unmarried cohabiting heterosexual couples.

The present study used group-housed, adult, ovariectomized rhesus monkeys {{to test the hypothesis}} that exposure to psychosocial stress, imposed by <b>social</b> <b>subordination,</b> would enhance estradiol (E 2) -negative feedback inhibition of LH. Because polymorphisms in the gene encoding the serotonin transporter (SLC 6 A 4) may contribute to individual differences in response to adverse environments, we determined whether subordinate females with the short-pro-moter-length allele (s-variant) would show greater suppression of LH. Subordinate females, particularly those with the s-variant SLC 6 A 4 genotype, received significantly higher rates of noncon-tact aggression from more dominant cage mates and had consistently lower body weights. Serum LH was not influenced by social status in the absence of E 2. In contrast, subordinate females were hypersensitive to E 2 -negative feedback inhibition of LH. Furthermore, serum LH in subordinate females with s-variant SLC 6 A 4 genotype was maximally suppressed by Day 4 of treatment, whereas nadir concentrations were not reached until later in treatment in other females. Finally, pharmacological elevation of serum cortisol potentiated E 2 -negative feedback inhibition in all females. The current data suggest that infertility induced by psychosocial stressors may be mediated by hyper-sensitivity to E 2 -negative feedback and that polymorphisms in the SLC 6 A 4 gene may contribute to differences in reproductive compromise in response to chronic stress. behavior, estradiol, luteinizing hormone, serotonin transporter polymorphism, <b>social</b> <b>subordination,</b> stres...|$|E
