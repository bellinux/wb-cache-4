40|$|Means {{of escape}} of {{transportation}} facilities should be effective for evacuees including disabled persons. It is, therefore, important to develop methods {{for evaluating the}} effectiveness of means of escape for such persons to maintain evacuation safety. One way for the evaluation is an evacuation simulation. We already developed an evacuation simulation in passenger ships for general passengers. It can estimate evacuation time and optimal evacuation routes. Now we are improving it taking disabled people into account. We are carrying out some experiments to investigate data and algorithms for describing the behaviors of a wheelchair user and related persons. In several experiments, we observed the behaviors that pedestrians and a wheelchair user escaped in basic conditions on land. A numerical simulation model for movement of pedestrian group overtaking a wheelchair user has been developed. Then we are investigating how crewmembers escort a simulated wheelchair user onboard. Focusing {{the behavior of a}} wheelchair user during <b>ship</b> listing and <b>dynamic</b> <b>ship</b> motion <b>conditions,</b> we have made a motion platform. Through those experiments we are getting information for the evacuation simulation.

40|$|The {{survival}} {{capability of}} damaged <b>ships</b> under <b>dynamic</b> sea <b>conditions</b> {{has been the}} subject of technical investigations since the early 1 9 W's. Building upon this base of knowledge, a research program was initiated in Canada to investigate the prime factors affecting the survival of Ro-Ro passenger ferries when flooded symmetrically after damage at midship. This effort would form an initial phase in the development of criteria for assessing Ro-Ro capsize safety after damage in sea states. A comprehensive model test program was devised to systematically examine the capsize phenomenon in sea states up to 7 metres significant wave height, using a model which replicated the design characteristics and proportions of large Canadian flag ferries. The vertical centre of gravity of the model was varied over a range of test conditions which met SOLAS 90 damage stability criteria. Using time history traces and summary data sheets, the test results were analysed to identify patterns of repeatable behaviour. Examined were the maximum upright and minimum capsize conditions of the ship in each test case. Prime variables used to make assessments under <b>dynamic</b> sea <b>conditions</b> are metacentric height and dynamic stability in the damaged condition. conclusions are drawn using these prime variables with respect to their relationship to residual freeboard after damage, freeing port area and presence of a centreline casing. In addition, findings are made on the behaviour of water accumulation on the vehicle deck which may assist in establishing criteria serving to design for capsize prevention in the future.

40|$|The role {{of memory}} in visual search has lately become a {{controversial}} issue. Horowitz and Wolfe (1998) observed that {{performance in a}} visual search task was little affected by whether the stimuli were static or randomly relocated every 111 ms. Because a memory-based mechanism, such as inhibition of return, would be of no use in the <b>dynamic</b> <b>condition,</b> Horowitz and Wolfe concluded that memory is likewise {{not involved in the}} static condition. However, Horowitz and Wolfe could not effectively {{rule out the possibility that}} observers adopted a different strategy in the <b>dynamic</b> <b>condition</b> than in the static condition. That is, in the <b>dynamic</b> <b>condition</b> observers may have attended to a subregion of the display and waited for the target to appear there (sit-and-wait strategy). This hypothesis is supported by experimental data showing that performance in their <b>dynamic</b> <b>condition</b> does not differ from performance in another <b>dynamic</b> <b>condition</b> in which observers are forced to adopt a sit-and-wait strategy by being presented with a limited region of the display only. ...|$|R
40|$|Horowitz and Wolfe (1998, 2003) have {{challenged}} {{the view that}} serial visual search involves memory processes that keep track of already inspected locations.

In addition to measuring search reaction times, observers' eye movements were recorded. For target-present trials, the search rates were near-identical in the two search conditions, replicating Horowitz and Wolfe's findings. However, the number of fixations and saccade amplitude were larger in the static than in the <b>dynamic</b> <b>condition,</b> whereas fixation duration and the latency of the first saccade were longer in the <b>dynamic</b> <b>condition.</b> These results indicate that an active, memory-guided search strategy was adopted in the static condition, and a passive “sit-and-wait” strategy in the <b>dynamic</b> <b>condition...</b>|$|R

40|$|This work investigates a new error {{source for}} angular {{velocity}} or attitude-based transfer alignment, {{which is caused}} by the coupling influence of <b>dynamic</b> flexure with <b>ship</b> angular motion. Most traditional studies do not consider this coupling error, as they often assume that <b>dynamic</b> flexure and <b>ship</b> angular motion are uncorrelated. However, the correlation between the dynamic flexure and the ship angular motion generally exists, which will cause a static error in measurements. We adopt the Bernoulli-Euler beam as a simplified ship vibration model to obtain the phase and amplitude relationships for the <b>ship</b> <b>dynamic</b> flexure angle and the ship angular motion. Simulation experiments are then conducted to test the phase delay on alignment accuracy based on the angular velocity matching approach. It is found that the estimation error has a strong correlation with this phase delay, and the error behaves like a sin wave function with the phase delay angle variation. The coupling error of <b>ship</b> <b>dynamic</b> flexure with <b>ship</b> angular velocity is deduced based on the spatial geometric modelling method, and the analysis demonstrates that this coupling error exists in angular velocity or attitude matching systems, which depends on the phase delay and amplitude ratio of <b>ship</b> <b>dynamic</b> flexure and angular velocity...|$|R

Patients: Six children with hemiplegia and 6 young adults. Methods: Kinematics of the trunk and arm were studied using an optoelectronic system. In the <b>dynamic</b> <b>condition</b> the target object, a cup, was moved by the robotic device along clockwise and counterclockwise circular trajectories. Results: Two main strategies were used to study the onset and offset of shoulder and elbow movements and their maximum velocities. The hand velocity profile was bell-shaped in the static condition and compatible with ramp movements for the more affected side in the <b>dynamic</b> <b>condition.</b> The time to object contact was higher for the more affected side in the <b>dynamic</b> <b>condition.</b> The temporal coordination index illustrated an immature and less flexible behaviour in children’s reaching in all the examined conditions.

40|$|The {{attitude}} {{accuracy of}} star sensors decreases rapidly when star images become motion-blurred under <b>dynamic</b> <b>conditions.</b> To improve {{the performance of}} star sensors, the attitude-correlated frames (ACF) approach concentrating on {{the features of the}} attitude transforms of the adjacent star image frames, was proposed recently. It is effective in removing random noises and improving the attitude accuracy of the star sensor under different <b>dynamic</b> <b>conditions</b> and noise gray levels. In this paper, a further research on the performance analysis of the ACF approach for star sensors is presented to show its advantages and clarify its application limitations as well. With the ACF method, a much larger star image frame is obtained through the combination of adjacent frames. By increasing the number of frames N, much more information of star frames can be applied to estimate the attitude, the ACF approach therefore can output the attitude information continuously when the current techniques fail to work under highly <b>dynamic</b> <b>conditions.</b> However, the increase of computational consumption is small and acceptable for the star sensor. Since the distribution features of noises will change during the process and the error of the strap down gyro unit increases with the correlation time, an accuracy limitation will occur. The analyses are validated with simulations and experimental data. As a result, the attitude accuracy and robustness of a star sensor increase under highly <b>dynamic</b> <b>conditions.</b> These performance improvements can allow the use of star sensors during maneuvering and other <b>dynamic</b> <b>conditions</b> for satellites, spacecraft, ballistic missiles, and ships...|$|R

The <b>dynamic</b> <b>conditions</b> differed with respect to isokinetic shortening velocity (25, 50 and 75 mm/s) of the muscle-tendon complex and in constancy of force (isotonic) and velocity (isokinetic) during shortening. Muscle geometry was characterized by fibre length and angle as well as aponeurosis length and angle. At high isokinetic shortening velocities (50 and 75 mm/s) small differences in geometry were found with respect to isometric conditions: aponeurosis lengths differed maximally by - 2 %, fibre length only showed a significant increase (+ 3. 2 %) at the highest shortening velocity. The isotonic condition only yielded significant differences of fibre angle (- 4. 5 %) in comparison with isometric conditions. No significant differences of muscle geometry were found when comparing isotonic with isokinetic conditions of similar shortening velocity. The small differences of geometry between isometric and <b>dynamic</b> <b>conditions</b> are presumably due to the lower muscle force in the <b>dynamic</b> <b>condition</b> and the elastic behaviour of the aponeurosis.
