50|$|It is {{possible}} using a particle accelerator {{to generate a}} short pulse of high energy electrons, these electrons are used to create X-rays by braking radiation.http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/AccelConf/p01/PAPERS/WOAA008.PDF. The X-rays are detected using a <b>semiconductor</b> <b>detector,</b> which is an array of silicon diodes. Such equipment {{has been used for}} the X-ray version of high speed flash photography. For example, diesel fuel that has been doped with cerium has been used to investigate the operation of fuel injectors in a diesel engine.https://web.archive.org/web/20060907150218/http://www.chess.cornell.edu/Test/pubs/2002/research/microsecond.pdfhttp://www.dxcicdd.com/05/PDF/Jin_Wang_1.pdf.|$|E
50|$|The {{point-contact}} <b>semiconductor</b> <b>detector</b> {{was subsequently}} resurrected around World War II {{because of the}} military requirement for microwave radar detectors. Vacuum-tube detectors do not work at microwave frequencies. The small area of the point contact minimized minority carrier storage and capacitance, making these diodes fast enough to function at radar frequencies. Silicon and germanium point-contact diodes were developed. Wartime research on p-n junctions in crystals {{paved the way for}} the invention of the point-contact transistor in 1947.|$|E
5000|$|If a {{gamma ray}} is emitted from a {{radioactive}} element within {{the human body}} due to radioactive decay, and its energy is sufficient to escape then it can be detected. This would be by means of either a scintillation detector or a <b>semiconductor</b> <b>detector</b> placed {{in close proximity to}} the body. Radioactive decay may give rise to gamma radiation which cannot escape the body due to being absorbed or other interaction whereby it can lose energy; so account must be taken of this in any measurement analysis.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{method to}} perform {{preferential}} sensing of single-polarity charge carriers in ionization detectors is presented. It achieves the same function as Frisch grids commonly employed in gas ion chambers but uses a coplanar electrode configuration that {{allows it to}} be applied to <b>semiconductor</b> <b>detectors.</b> Through the use of this method, good energy resolution can be obtained from room-temperature compound <b>semiconductor</b> <b>detectors</b> despite their poor hole-collection characteristics. Experiment using a CdZnTe detector demonstrates the effectiveness of this technique. Schemes to correct for electron trapping and to obtain position information are also described...|$|R
5000|$|The energy {{required}} to produce electron-hole-pairs is very low compared to the energy {{required to}} produce paired ions in a gas detector. Consequently, in semiconductor detectors the statistical variation of the pulse height is smaller and the energy resolution is higher. As the electrons travel fast, the time resolution is also very good, and is dependent upon rise time. [...] Compared with gaseous ionization detectors, the density of a <b>semiconductor</b> <b>detector</b> is very high, and charged particles of high energy can give off their energy in a semiconductor of relatively small dimensions.|$|E
50|$|The {{characteristic}} X-rays {{are used}} for chemical analysis. Specific X-ray wavelengths or energies are selected and counted, either by wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (WDS) or energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). WDS utilizes Bragg diffraction from crystals to select X-ray wavelengths of interest and direct them to gas-flow or sealed proportional detectors. In contrast, EDS uses a solid state <b>semiconductor</b> <b>detector</b> to accumulate X-rays of all wavelengths produced from the sample. While EDS yields more information and typically requires a much shorter counting time, WDS is generally a more precise technique with lower limits of detection because its superior X-ray peak resolution and greater peak to background ratio.|$|E
50|$|The {{value of}} {{optically}} coupling a solid state light emitter to a <b>semiconductor</b> <b>detector</b> {{for the purpose}} of electrical isolation was recognized in 1963 by Akmenkalns,et al. (US patent 3,417,249). Photoresistor-based opto-isolators were introduced in 1968. They are the slowest, but also the most linear isolators and still retain a niche market in audio and music industry. Commercialization of LED technology in 1968-1970 caused a boom in optoelectronics, {{and by the end of}} the 1970s the industry developed all principal types of opto-isolators. The majority of opto-isolators on the market use bipolar silicon phototransistor sensors. They attain medium data transfer speed, sufficient for applications like electroencephalography. The fastest opto-isolators use PIN diodes in photoconductive mode.|$|E

40|$|The {{advent of}} <b>semiconductor</b> <b>detectors</b> has {{revolutionized}} the broad field of X-ray spectroscopy. <b>Semiconductor</b> <b>detectors,</b> originally developed for particle physics, are now widely used for X-ray spectroscopy {{in a large}} variety of fields, as X-ray fluorescence analysis, X-ray astronomy and diagnostic medicine. The success of <b>semiconductor</b> <b>detectors</b> is due to several unique properties that are not available {{with other types of}} detectors: the excellent energy resolution, the high detection efficiency and the possibility of development of compact detection systems. Among the <b>semiconductors,</b> silicon (Si) <b>detectors</b> are the key detectors in the soft X-ray band ( 15 keV) {{and will continue to be}} the choice for laboratory-based high performance spectrometers. However, there has been a continuing desire for ambient temperature and compact detectors with the portability and convenience of a scintillator but with a significant improvement in resolution. To this end, numerous high-Z and wide band gap compound semiconductors have been exploited. Among the compound semiconductors, cadmium telluride (CdTe) and cadmium zinc telluride (CdZnTe) are very appealing for hard X-ray detectors and are widely used for the development of spectrometer prototypes for medical and astrophysical applications. Beside the detector, the readout electronics also plays a key role in the development of high resolution spectrometers. Recently, many research groups have been involved in the design and development of high resolution spectrometers based on <b>semiconductor</b> <b>detectors</b> and on digital pulse processing (DPP) techniques. Due to their lower dead time, higher stability and flexibility, digital systems, based on directly digitizing and processing of detector signals (preamplifier output signals), have recently been favored over analog electronics ensuring high performance in both low and high counting rate environments. In this chapter, we review the research activities of our group in the development of high throughput and high resolution X-ray spectrometers based on compound <b>semiconductor</b> <b>detectors</b> and DPP systems. First, we briefly describe the physical properties and the signal formation in <b>semiconductor</b> <b>detectors</b> for X-ray spectroscopy. Second, we introduce the main properties and critical issues of a X-ray detection system, highlighting the characteristics of both analog and digital approaches. Finally, we report on the spectroscopic performance of a high resolution spectrometer based on a CdTe detector and a custom DPP system. As an application, direct measurements of mammographic X-ray spectra by using the digital CdTe detection system are also presented...|$|R
25|$|<b>Semiconductor</b> <b>detectors,</b> {{also called}} {{solid-state}} detectors, are {{fundamentally different from}} scintillation detectors: They rely on detection of the charge carriers (electrons and holes) generated in semiconductors by energy deposited by gamma ray photons.|$|R
50|$|HEXITEC ASICs are {{flip-chip}} {{bonded to}} a direct conversion <b>semiconductor</b> <b>detector</b> using a low temperature (~100oC) curing silver epoxy and gold stud technique in a hybrid detector arrangement. The X-ray detector layer is a semiconductor, typically cadmium telluride (CdTe) or {{cadmium zinc telluride}} (CdZnTe), between 1 - 3 mm thick. The detectors consist of a planar cathode and a pixelated anode and are operated under a negative bias voltage. X-ray and Ύ-rays interacting within the detector layer form charge clouds of electron-hole pairs which drift from the cathode to the anode pixels. The charge drifting across the detectors induce charge on the ASIC pixels as described by the Shockley-Ramo theorem which form the detected signal. The detectors are capable of measuring an X-ray/Ύ-ray photo-peak FWHM of the order 1 keV in the energy range 3 - 200 keV.|$|E
50|$|X-ray {{spectroscopy}} is {{a powerful}} experimental technique that provides qualitative information about the elemental composition and internal stresses and strain within a specimen. High energy X-rays {{have the ability to}} penetrate deeply into materials allowing the examination of dense objects such as welds in steel, geological core sections bearing oil or gas or for the internal observation of chemical reactions inside heavy plant or machinery. Different experimental techniques such as X-ray fluorescence imaging and X-Ray diffraction imaging require X-ray detectors that are sensitive over a broad range of energies. Established <b>semiconductor</b> <b>detector</b> technology based on silicon and germanium have excellent energy resolution at X-ray energies under 30 keV but above this, due to a reduction in the material mass attenuation coefficient, the detection efficiency is dramatically reduced. To detect high energy X-rays, detectors produced from higher density materials are required.|$|E

40|$|The {{non-contact}} {{measurement of}} temperature {{by using the}} emitted thermal radiation has been an innovative field of measurement science and fundamental physics {{for more than a}} hundred years. It saw the first highlight in Gustav Kirchhoff's principle of a blackbody with ideal emission characteristics and culminated in Max Planck's formulation of the law of thermal radiation, the so-called Planck's law, forming the foundation of quantum physics. A boost in accuracy was the development of <b>semiconductor</b> <b>detectors</b> and the cryogenic electrical substitution radiometer in the late 1970 s. <b>Semiconductor</b> <b>detectors,</b> namely photodiodes, deliver an electrical current proportional to the absorbed optical radiation. Due to the measurements of thermal radiation over a wide range of temperature and wavelength, thermodynamic temperature measurements with radiometric methods have set benchmarks to all, the electrical, dimensional and optical metrology.

Response linearity, sensitivity, spatial resolution and its depth dependence, organ thickness {{dependence of the}} measured count rate and tumour detectability were assessed for two intraoperative gamma detectors. The two detectors (a scintillation and a <b>semiconductor</b> <b>detector)</b> showed differences in technical performance. For example, the sensitivity was higher for the scintillation detector, while the spatial resolution was better for the <b>semiconductor</b> <b>detector.</b> Regarding organ thickness dependence and tumour detectability, similar results were obtained for both detectors, and even relatively small simulated tumours of low tumour-to-background activity concentration ratios could be detected.|$|E
