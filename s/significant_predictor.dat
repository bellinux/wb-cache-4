25|$|According to this model, {{substance}} abuse problems may arise under two different personality traits: low BIS and high BAS. Since the BAS promotes {{the individual to}} pursue actions that may result in reward, BAS sensitivity {{is involved in the}} initiation of addiction. Significant associations have been found between high BAS such as alcohol misuse in school girls, hazardous drinking in men, illicit drug abuse, and tobacco use. BAS sensitivity is a <b>significant</b> <b>predictor</b> of reactivity to substance cues, or cravings. Conversely, BIS sensitivity is involved in avoiding negative situations or affect (such as withdrawal). Low BIS has been positively associated with continuing the addiction to relieve feelings of withdrawal, or for continued use to alleviate negative affect.|$|E

40|$|One {{important}} step in regression analysis is to identify <b>significant</b> <b>predictors</b> {{from a pool of}} candidates so that a parsimonious model can be obtained using these <b>significant</b> <b>predictors</b> only. However, most of the existing methods assume linear relationships between response and predictors, which may be inappropriate in some applications.

Therefore, this method has no problem of model misspecification, and it is suitable for selecting <b>significant</b> <b>predictors</b> at the preliminary stage of data analysis.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether nuclear morphometric data can predict survival, disease progression, and chemotherapeutic response in ovarian serous carcinoma. Nuclear morphometric parameters were determined from archival hematoxylin and eosin sections of 132 serous tumors. Clinicopathologic and morphometric parameters were evaluated as to their individual and independent prognostic value and prediction of chemotherapy response. Nuclear parameters were found to strongly correlate with extent of disease residuum, tumor grade, and FIGO stage. Univariate analysis revealed stage, grade, preoperative CA 125, presence of ascites, extent of disease residuum, standard deviation of nuclear area (SDNA), nuclear perimeter (NP), SDNP, nuclear length (NL), nuclear breadth (NB), orthoferet, and equivalent diameter (ED) to be <b>significant</b> <b>predictors</b> of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Grade, stage, extent of disease residuum, presence of ascites, SDNA, NP, NL, NB, and orthoferet were found to be <b>significant</b> <b>predictors</b> of chemotherapy response.

The TAPAS test aims to assess various aspects of recruit behavior that are not captured by typical screening tests, such as schooling and the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) along with other observable characteristics measured at entry. This thesis estimates whether the TAPAS scores predict recruit attrition in the Delayed Entry Program (DEP), while controlling for schooling, AFQT scores, and demographics.

The two variables accounted for 65 % {{of the variance in the}} model. In the case of lower-level group, L 2 phonological modification knowledge and L 1 working memory capacity emerged as the <b>significant</b> <b>predictors</b> of L 2 listening comprehension.

During follow-up, some ICD recipients experience the sensation of ICD discharge {{in the absence of an}} actual discharge (phantom shock). The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and predictors of phantom shocks in ICD recipients. Methods Medical records of 629 consecutive patients with ischaemic or dilated cardiomyopathy and prior ICD implantation were studied. Results With a median follow-up of 35 months, phantom shocks were reported by 5. 1 % of ICD recipients (5. 7 % in the primary prevention group and 3. 7 % for the secondary prevention group; p=NS). In the combined group of primary and secondary prevention, there were no <b>significant</b> <b>predictors</b> of the occurrence of phantom shocks. However, in the primary prevention group, phantom shocks were related to a history of atrial fibrillation (p= 0. 03) and NYHA class <III (p= 0. 05).
