It was started due to a perceived need for faster response times than the county fire station some 10 mi away in Morgan could provide. A separate fire station was built in 1973. In 1997, the Insurance Services Office evaluated the Mountain Green Fire District and gave it a Fire Suppression Rating <b>Schedule</b> <b>rating</b> of class 6, equal to the grade of the Morgan Fire Department.|$|E

40|$|During one {{component}} of a multiple schedule, pigeons were trained on a discrete-trial concurrent variable-interval variable-interval schedule in which one alternative had a high <b>scheduled</b> <b>rate</b> of reinforcement {{and the other a}} low <b>scheduled</b> <b>rate</b> of reinforcement. When the choice proportion between the alternatives matched their respective relative reinforcement frequencies, the obtained probabilities of reinforcement (reinforcer per peck) were approximately equal. In alternate components of the multiple schedule, a single response alternative was presented with an intermediate <b>scheduled</b> <b>rate</b> of reinforcement. During probe trials, each alternative of the concurrent schedule was paired with the constant alternative. The stimulus correlated with the high reinforcement rate was preferred over that with the intermediate rate, whereas the stimulus correlated with the intermediate rate of reinforcement was preferred over that correlated with the low rate of reinforcement. Preference on probe tests was thus determined by the <b>scheduled</b> <b>rate</b> of reinforcement. Other subjects were presented all three alternatives individually, but with a distribution of trial frequency and reinforcement probability similar to that produced by the choice patterns of the original subjects. Here, preferences on probe tests were determined by the obtained probabilities of reinforcement. Comparison of the two sets of results indicates that the availability of a choice alternative, even when not responded to, affects the preference for that alternative. The results imply that models of choice that invoke only obtained probability of reinforcement as the controlling variable (e. g., melioration) are inadequate...|$|R

40|$|Grid {{scheduling}} {{is one of}} {{the vital}} tasks in grid environment, which maps tasks to resources. More recently, a Reputation based scheduling method based on Reliability was proposed for workflow applications to overcome the deficiencies of the existing reputation methods. The method was focused on only computational-intensive tasks. Other recent effort to improve reliability of the scheduling include RDGS (Reliable Distributed Grid Scheduler), which attempts to enhance the Successful <b>Schedule</b> <b>Rate</b> of the mixed tasks by using rescheduling concept. The RDGS method considers various parameters (Priority, Deadline, and CCR) for both computational and communication intensive mixed tasks (Hard, firm, and soft). In this paper we propose a novel method which exploits the merits of both Reliability based reputation method and RDGS. We conducted exhaustive simulation experiments to prove the superiority of the proposed method as compared to other existing methods (GDS, RDGS).

The data in sensor networks have different levels of priority and hence their criticality differs. In order {{to keep up the}} real time commitment, the applications need higher transmission rates and reliability in information delivery. In this work we propose a multipath routing algorithm which enables the reliable delivery of data. By controlling the <b>scheduling</b> <b>rate,</b> it is possible to prevent congestion and packet loss in the network. The algorithm provides an efficient way to prevent the packet loss at each node. This results in congestion management in the sensor networks. This protocol prevents packet clustering and provides smoothness to the traffic.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{quantitative}} {{study was to determine}} the impact of high school schedule type on instructional effectiveness and student achievement in mathematics. An analysis was prepared to determine the schedule types currently used in math classes, whether significant differences exist between schedule types on the percent of students meeting or exceeding on the 2011 PSAE math test, how teachers rate the effectiveness of a schedule they currently use versus how others that use a different <b>schedule</b> <b>rate</b> the same <b>schedule</b> for various student outcomes in mathematics, and whether significant differences exist in the effectiveness ratings between schedule types on various student outcomes in mathematics. The research design involved a population of 350 lead math teachers or math department chairs currently teaching at a 9 â 12 high school in Illinois. Teachersâ beliefs on the effectiveness of the different schedule types on various student outcomes were collected using a 23 -item survey. Statistical analysis of the data included descriptive analysis for selected items, means, and standard deviations. A one-way ANOVA was used to test whether significant differences existed between schedule types on the percentage of students meeting or exceeding standards on the 2011 PSAE math test, and a comparison of the mean ratings for each schedule type was used to determine how teachers rated the effectiveness of a schedule type they currently use versus how others who use a different <b>schedule</b> type <b>rated</b> the same <b>schedule.</b> Repeated measures one-way ANOVAs were used to determine whether significant differences existed in the effectiveness ratings between schedule types on various student outcomes in mathematics. Significance was identified at the. 05 level. In all, 91 lead math teachers or math department chairs of high schools in Illinois responded to the survey instrument, which questioned the perceived level of effectiveness of the traditional schedule, AB block schedule, 4 x 4 block schedule, and trimester schedule for 11 different student outcomes in mathematics. As a result of the analysis, there were no significant differences found in the percent of students meeting or exceeding standards on the 2011 PSAE between schools on a block schedule versus those on a traditional schedule. The analysis showed that teachers currently on a traditional <b>schedule</b> <b>rated</b> the traditional <b>schedule</b> higher than those currently teaching on a block schedule. Teachers currently teaching on a block <b>schedule</b> <b>rated</b> the block <b>schedule</b> more favorably than teachers currently teaching on a traditional schedule. However, teachers currently teaching on a block <b>schedule</b> <b>rated</b> the traditional <b>schedule</b> as the most effective overall for most of the student outcomes. When analyzing the responses of all of the respondents, the traditional schedule was perceived to be more effective than all other schedule types for eight of the 11 student outcomes while the AB block <b>schedule</b> was <b>rated</b> most effective for only one outcome.
