5000|$|IBM's Intel based server lines, {{including}} IBM System x and IBM BladeCenter {{were sold}} to Lenovo in 2014. Lenovo says it will gain access to more enterprise customers, improve its profit margins, and develop a closer relationship with Intel, the maker of most server processors, through its acquisition of IBM's x86-based server business. On 1 October 2014, Lenovo closed its acquisition of IBM’s server division, with the final price put at $2.1 billion. Lenovo said this acquisition came in at a price lower than the previously announced $2.3 billion partially because {{of a change in}} the value of IBM inventories. The deal has been already approved by Europe, China and the United States. The United <b>States</b> Department of <b>Treasury</b> <b>Committee</b> on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) was reportedly the last hurdle for Lenovo, since the United States has the strictest policies. According to Timothy Prickett-Morgan from Enterprise Tech, the deal still awaits [...] "approval of regulators in China, the European Commission, and Canada." ...|$|R

50|$|For instance, United <b>States</b> <b>Treasury</b> {{notes and}} United <b>States</b> <b>Treasury</b> bonds are often {{assumed to be}} risk-free bonds. Even though investors in United <b>States</b> <b>Treasury</b> {{securities}} do in fact face {{a small amount of}} credit risk, this risk is often considered to be negligible. An example of this credit risk was shown by Russia, which defaulted on its domestic debt during the 1998 Russian financial crisis.|$|R
40|$|Following the {{financial}} crisis of 2008, the <b>Treasury</b> <b>Committee</b> of the UK House of Commons undertook an inquiry into the lessons that might {{be learned from the}} banking crisis. Paul Moore, head of group regulatory risk at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) during 2002 – 2005, provided evidence of his experience of questioning HBOS policies which resulted in his dismissal from HBOS. The problems that surfaced at HBOS during {{the financial}} crisis were so serious that it was forced to merge with Lloyds TSB, another UK bank, to form the Lloyds Banking Group in which the government took a significant stake. Moore’s evidence to the <b>Treasury</b> <b>Committee</b> revealed that long before {{the financial crisis}}, he had raised major concerns with the management of HBOS and with the Financial Services Authority (FSA), the UK financial services regulator. Moore’s evidence led to the submission of further disclosures, replies and rejoinders as evidence to the <b>Treasury</b> <b>Committee.</b> Moore’s case is therefore of considerable interest to researchers of whistleblowing because it is a rare instance of high-level whistleblowing, the details of which subsequently entered the public domain. The information revealed in evidence to the <b>Treasury</b> <b>Committee</b> sheds light on the process of whistleblowing {{in the context of the}} governance and regulation of a major UK bank that subsequently had to be rescued by government intervention during the financial crisis. The paper makes a contribution to the wider literature on whistleblowing, and to a greater understanding of aspects of the financial crisis...|$|R
