500|$|The two-lane highway {{runs through}} the Pere Marquette State Forest and over the Manistee River, {{crossing}} {{the southeast corner of}} Grand Traverse County. It meets the southern end of M-113 in Walton, where it runs parallel to the Great Lakes Central Railroad. Passing through Fife Lake, US131 crosses into Kalkaska County and to South Boardman. The area around South Boardman is marked by farmland as the trunkline crosses the Boardman River in the small unincorporated community. The road once again runs parallel to the railroad as it meets M-66/M-72 south of Kalkaska. The three highways join and run concurrently through downtown. North of town M-72 turns west toward Traverse City and US131/M-66 continues north through farmland into Antrim County. About [...] north of town, standing {{on the west side of}} the road, is the <b>Shoe</b> <b>Tree.</b> A local icon since shortly after the turn of the 21st century, the origins of the landmark are unknown.|$|E
50|$|The former Rice <b>Shoe</b> <b>Tree</b> {{was located}} in Rice, a former town around a Santa Fe Railroad siding in the valley. The <b>Shoe</b> <b>Tree</b> burned down in 2003, and was 'replaced' by the present day 'Rice Shoe Garden' along a fence.|$|E
50|$|<b>Shoe</b> <b>trees</b> {{may also}} be made of plastic or stamped sheet metal, {{with or without a}} coiled steel spring stem; these are {{typically}} cheaper, lighter, and are better suited for travelling. Types lacking a flexing steel spring may use extension springs or adjustable two-piece stems having an over-centre mechanical action to wedge them in place. Plastic <b>shoe</b> <b>trees</b> maintain the shape of your shoes, but lack the moisture absorbing qualities of wooden <b>shoe</b> <b>trees.</b>|$|R
50|$|You should insert <b>shoe</b> <b>trees</b> {{once you}} take your shoes off {{so that they can}} absorb the {{moisture}} from your sweat and dry out your shoe in the correct shape. This will prevent lining rot and creases from taking hold of your leather. You should also insert <b>shoe</b> <b>trees</b> if you wet your shoes so that they can dry out faster. While some recommend having a pair of <b>shoe</b> <b>trees</b> for every <b>shoe,</b> others believe they are unnecessary once they have done their job of absorbing moisture, typically after 24 hours of 'rest'.|$|R
50|$|Mid-range <b>shoe</b> <b>trees</b> {{have a full}} {{articulated}} (usually rounded) {{heel and}} sometimes have ventilation slots in the toe to help moisture evaporate. These are usually made of 3 parts: a heel, a head, and a smaller toe piece. These approximate the shape of your feet, so they are better at maintaining the structural integrity of your shoe compared to generically shaped <b>shoe</b> <b>trees.</b>|$|R

50|$|Higher quality shoe {{trees are}} made from solid wood, usually cedar, which helps control odor and absorb moisture. Other {{materials}} include beech, lime and alderwood. Although most <b>shoe</b> <b>tree</b> manufacturers claim that cedarwood is superior, {{there is really no}} difference as long as the <b>shoe</b> <b>tree</b> is made of unfinished wood.|$|E

50|$|Perhaps more {{important}} than maintaining the shape, <b>shoe</b> <b>trees</b> also play {{a crucial part of}} wicking away leather-damaging moisture from the inside. This is especially important when shoes are worn without socks, as the sweat absorbed by the leather can lead to lining rot.|$|R
50|$|Boot <b>trees</b> are <b>shoe</b> <b>trees</b> for boots. Creases {{that form}} in the calves of boots can {{eventually}} cause zips to break, and a zip replacement can be an expensive repair. By investing {{in a pair of}} boot trees a repair like this can easily be avoided.|$|R

50|$|United Cigar Stores was {{the largest}} chain of cigar stores in the United States. Though {{initially}} specializing in cigars, it eventually sold many other items, such as Mickey Mouse watches and <b>shoe</b> <b>trees.</b> The chain was founded in 1901. The chain represented {{the interests of the}} Consolidated Tobacco Company, the tobacco trust that controlled the American Tobacco Company and others. In September 1903 a settlement was reached with the chain's competitors and all competition ended. By 1926 the chain had close to 3000 retail stores.|$|R

5000|$|Located {{in front}} of Pogue Library on the Quad is a tree with many pairs of shoes nailed to the trunk. The {{tradition}} {{is that if a}} couple gets married after meeting at Murray State, they return to the Quad and each one nails a shoe to the [...] "Shoe Tree." [...] Many of the shoes include names and dates written on them. If the couple has a baby, the baby's shoes are then sometimes also nailed to the tree. The <b>shoe</b> <b>tree</b> tradition originated in the 1960s. It should be noted that this tree (due to a high zinc content from the nails) is a common target of lightning and has caught fire in the past. The original <b>shoe</b> <b>tree</b> is gone as a result of fire; however, the tradition continues through the second <b>shoe</b> <b>tree.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cedar {{wood and}} cedar oil {{are known to}} be a natural {{repellent}} to moths, hence cedar is a popular lining for modern-day cedar chests and closets in which woolens are stored. This specific use of cedar is mentioned in The Iliad (Book 24), referring to the cedar-roofed or lined storage chamber where Priam goes to fetch treasures to be used as ransom. However, the species typically used for cedar chests and closets in North America is Juniperus virginiana, which is different from the true cedars (note also common confusion with Thuja spp. below). Cedar is also commonly used to make <b>shoe</b> <b>trees</b> as it can absorb moisture and deodorise.|$|R

50|$|A <b>shoe</b> <b>tree</b> is {{a device}} {{approximating}} {{the shape of}} a foot that is placed inside a shoe to preserve its shape, stop it from developing creases and thereby extend the life of the shoe. It is a reusable alternative to wadded rags or newspapers.|$|E
50|$|Oddball inventions: Tom's {{father has}} invented a <b>shoe</b> <b>tree</b> that can cool or heat up a shoe; a woman whom Tom and Pete meet has invented a glass, {{attached}} around her aged mother's neck, that {{allows her to}} see if she's still breathing.

50|$|The {{cheapest}} are wooden <b>shoe</b> <b>tree</b> {{without a}} full heel. Although they help with odor, {{and will help}} preserve the original shape {{at the front of}} the shoe, the narrow knob on the heel puts excess pressure on one section of the heel and prolonged use may deform the shoe.|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a three-dimensional foot scanner which can form images or three-dimensional data records of feet of human bodies {{and is used}} for the manufacturing <b>shoe</b> <b>trees.</b> The three-dimensional foot scanner comprises a foot scanning device and a foot image analysis system, wherein the foot scanning device is used for shooting a medial border image, a lateral border image and a sole image of a foot; and the foot image analysis system is used for analyzing the medial border image, the lateral border image and the sole image of the foot so as to acquire three-dimensional foot data. In the three-dimensional foot scanner, the medial border image, the lateral border image and the sole image of the foot are shot by a plurality of cameras, the images are corrected and spliced, integrated outlines of the medial border, the lateral border and the sole of the foot are extracted, and standard three-dimensional foot data is combined so as to generate a foot three-dimensional model. By using the three-dimensional foot scanner, the scanning time and production cost are greatly reduced on the premise of ensuring certain precision. 本发明涉及一种三维足部扫描仪，该三维足部扫描仪能形成人体足部的图像或三维数据记录，用于鞋楦的制作。该三维足部扫描仪包括：足部扫描装置，用于拍摄足部内侧图像、足部外侧图像和足部底部图像；以及足部图像分析系统，用于对所述足部内侧图像、足部外侧图像和足部底部图像进行分析以获取三维足部数据。本发明首先利用多个摄像头拍摄足部内侧、外侧和底部的图像，再对图像进行校正和拼接，并提取完整的足部内侧、外侧和底部轮廓，结合标准三维足部数据生成足部三维模型。本发明在保证一定精度的前提下，减少扫描所需时间，并且大大降低生产成本。Institute of Textiles and ClothingInventor name used in this publication: 张一帆Inventor name used in this publication: 马啸Title in Traditional Chinese: 三維足部掃描儀Chin...|$|R
50|$|Geographically, modern Xanth {{resembles the}} state of Florida in the United States in shape, but has {{landmarks}} that mimic well known geographical features from around the world. One major {{example of this is}} the Gap Chasm, an enormous canyon a mile wide which completely bisects the country, paralleling the DMZ of the Korean Peninsula. The position of the Chasm could also correspond with the Cross Florida Barge Canal, which, similar to the chasm, is generally forgotten except for those who stumble upon it. The Gap is guarded by a resident dragon, known as Stanley Steamer, and is crossed by means of treacherous bridges. Many of Xanth's other geographical features are puns on those of Florida (for example, Lake Ogre-Chobee and the Kiss-Mee River). The Florida Keys also exist, though they are, in Xanth, actual keys. Other punnish features include the Isle of View ("I love you"), Mount Ever-Rest (Mount Everest) and the Centaur Aisle (center aisle) created by a magician from the Centaur Isle. The moon is close enough that flying creatures may land there; the back side is sweet and honeyish, the visible side has turned sour and become curdled cheese, due to observing what has happened on Earth and Xanth. Plants may bear fruit of all descriptions (pie <b>trees</b> and <b>shoe</b> <b>trees</b> are common) or they may be carnivorous (such as the tangle trees), making travel in Xanth risky.|$|R
50|$|Shoe tossing, the act {{of using}} shoes as {{projectiles}} or improvised weapons, is a constituent {{of a number of}} folk sports and practices.
