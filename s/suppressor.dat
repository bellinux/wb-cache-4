40|$|Sixty {{independent}} UGA <b>suppressors</b> of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{have been}} studied. They are dominant and {{are divided into}} 16 groups (loci) by recombination. <b>Suppressors</b> representing these loci are divided into two classes by action spectra; four in class 1 (a broad action spectrum) and 12 in class 2 (a narrow action spectrum). Class 1 <b>suppressors</b> are less frequent in terms of not only total number but also number per locus than class 2 <b>suppressors,</b> indicating difference in either or both mutation frequency and selective pressure between <b>suppressors</b> of the two classes. Two of the class 1 <b>suppressors,</b> SUP 152 and SUP 161, do not recombine with SUP 28 and SUP 33, leucine-inserting UAA <b>suppressors,</b> respectively, indicating that they are mutations in genes coding for tRNA(UUA) (Leu). Of the remaining two class 1 <b>suppressors,</b> SUP 160 which causes lethality in the ψ(+) cytoplasm is mapped on chromosome XV {{very close to the}} centromere, and SUP 165 on the right arm of chromosome XIV 44 cM distal to lys 9. Of the class 2 <b>suppressors,</b> ten do not recombine with one or another of previously known UGA <b>suppressors.</b> The remaining two class 2 <b>suppressors,</b> SUP 154 and SUP 155, are mapped on the left and right arms of chromosome VII, respectively...|$|R

5|$|An {{important}} pathophysiological {{mechanism of}} leukemogenesis in AML is the epigenetic induction of dedifferentiation by genetic mutations that alter {{the function of}} epigenetic enzymes, such as the DNA demethylase TET2 and the metabolic enzymes IDH1 and IDH2, which lead to the generation of a novel oncometabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate, which inhibits the activity of epigenetic enzymes such as TET2. The hypothesis is that such epigenetic mutations lead to the silencing of tumor <b>suppressor</b> genes and/or the activation of proto-oncogenes.|$|E
5|$|DNA damage, due to {{environmental}} factors and normal metabolic processes inside the cell, occurs {{at a rate}} of 10,000 to 1,000,000 molecular lesions per cell per day. While this constitutes only 0.000165% of the human genome's approximately 6 billion bases (3 billion base pairs), unrepaired lesions in critical genes (such as tumor <b>suppressor</b> genes) can impede a cell's ability to carry out its function and appreciably increase the likelihood of tumor formation and contribute to tumour heterogeneity.|$|E
40|$|Approximately 290 omnipotent <b>suppressors,</b> which enhance {{translational}} misreading, {{were isolated}} in {{strains of the}} yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae containing the ψ(+) extrachromosomal determinant. The <b>suppressors</b> could be assigned to 8 classes by their pattern of suppression of five nutritional markers. The <b>suppressors</b> were further distinguished by differences in growth on paromomycin medium, hypertonic medium, low temperatures (10 °), nonfermentable carbon sources, α-aminoadipic acid medium, and by their dominance and recessiveness. Genetic analysis of 12 representative <b>suppressors</b> resulted in the assignment of these <b>suppressors</b> to 6 different loci, including the three previously described loci SUP 35 (chromosome IV), SUP 45 (chromosome II) and SUP 46 (chromosome II), as well as three new loci SUP 42 (chromosome IV), SUP 43 (chromosome XV) and SUP 44 (chromosome VII). <b>Suppressors</b> belonging to the same locus had {{a wide range of}} different phenotypes. Differences between alleles of the same locus and similarities between alleles of different loci suggest that the omnipotent <b>suppressors</b> encode proteins that effect different functions and that altered forms of each of the proteins can effect the same function...|$|R
50|$|Unlike tumor <b>suppressors,</b> most {{metastasis}} <b>suppressors</b> are downregulated {{in clinical}} tumor samples rather than mutated.

40|$|<b>Suppressors</b> of ICR-induced {{mutations}} that exhibit behavior {{similar to}} bacterial frameshift <b>suppressors</b> {{have been identified}} in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The yeast <b>suppressors</b> have been divided into two groups. Previous evidence indicated that <b>suppressors</b> of one group (Group II: SUF 1, SUF 3, SUF 4, SUF 5 and SUF 6) represent mutations in the structural genes for glycyl-tRNA's. <b>Suppressors</b> of the other group (Group III: SUF 2 and SUF 7) were less well characterized. Although they suppressed some ICR-revertible mutations, they failed to suppress Group II frameshift mutations. This communication provides a more thorough characterization of the Group III <b>suppressors</b> and describes the isolation and properties of four new <b>suppressors</b> in that group (SUF 8, SUF 9, SUF 10 and suf 11). ——In our original study, Group III <b>suppressors</b> were isolated as revertants of the Group III mutations his 4 – 712 and his 4 – 713. All <b>suppressors</b> obtained as ICR-induced revertants of these mutations mapped at the SUF 2 locus near the centromere of chromosome III. <b>Suppressors</b> mapping at other loci were obtained in this study by analyzing spontaneous and UV-induced revertants of the Group III mutations. SUF 2 and SUF 10 suppress both Group III his 4 mutations, whereas SUF 7, SUF 8, SUF 9 and suf 11 suppress his 4 – 713, but not his 4 – 712. All of the <b>suppressors</b> except suf 11 are dominant in diploids homozygous for his 4 - 713. The <b>suppressors</b> fail to suppress representative UAA, UAG and UGA nonsense mutations. ——SUF 9 is linked to the centromere of chromosome VI, and SUF 10 is linked to the centromere of chromosome XIV. A triploid mapping procedure was used to determine the chromosome locations of SUF 7 and SUF 8. Subsequent standard crosses revealed linkage of SUF 7 to cdc 5 on chromosome XIII and linkage of SUF 8 to cdc 12 and pet 3 on chromosome VIII...|$|R

5|$|The P90 has {{provisions}} for mounting {{a number of}} different types of accessories, including tactical lights and laser aiming devices. A sling can be attached to the P90 for greater ease of carry, or it can be fitted with various sound suppressors such as the Gemtech SP90, which was designed specifically for the weapon in cooperation with FN Herstal. This stainless steel <b>suppressor</b> with a black oxide finish is built according to MIL-SPECs, including saltwater corrosion resistance. It has a length of 184mm (7.2in), a diameter of 35mm (1.4in) and a weight of 680 g (1.5lb). When subsonic ammunition is used in conjunction with the <b>suppressor,</b> it reduces the sound signature of the P90 by 33dB. A small case collector pouch for the P90 is available which fits over the ejection port and collects spent cases as they are ejected downward; the pouch will collect up to one hundred cases before filling.|$|E
5|$|The Tower domain {{adopts a}} {{secondary}} structure {{consisting of a}} pair of long, antiparallel alpha-helices (the stem) that support a three-helix bundle (3HB) at their end. The 3HB contains a helix-turn-helix motif and is similar to the DNA binding domains of the bacterial site-specific recombinases, and of eukaryotic Myb and homeodomain transcription factors.

Versions of FLCN have been found in other animals, including fruit flies, German shepherds, rats, and mice. The disease was discovered in 1977, but the connection with FLCN was not elucidated until 2002, after kidney cancer, collapsed lungs, and pulmonary cysts were all definitively connected to BHD.|$|E

Sound <b>suppressors</b> slow the expansion of gases, allowing it to cool and reducing the rate at which it escapes to prevent a shockwave from forming.|$|R
40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{are small}} noncoding RNAs which play {{essential}} roles in many important biological processes. Therefore, their dysfunction {{is associated with}} a variety of human diseases, including cancer. Increasing evidence shows that miRNAs can act as oncogenes or tumor <b>suppressors,</b> and although there is great interest in research into these cancerassociated miRNAs, little is known about them. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of putative human miRNA oncogenes and tumor <b>suppressors.</b> We found that miRNA oncogenes and tumor <b>suppressors</b> clearly show different patterns in function, evolutionary rate, expression, chromosome distribution, molecule size, free energy, transcription factors, and targets. For example, miRNA oncogenes are located mainly in the amplified regions in human cancers, whereas miRNA tumor <b>suppressors</b> are located mainly in the deleted regions. miRNA oncogenes tend to cleave target mRNAs more frequently than miRNA tumor <b>suppressors.</b> These results indicate that these two types of cancer-associated miRNAs play different roles in cancer formation and development. Moreover, the patterns identified here can discriminate novel miRNA oncogenes and tumor <b>suppressors</b> {{with a high degree of}} accuracy. This study represents the first large-scale bioinformatic analysis of human miRNA oncogenes and tumor <b>suppressors.</b> Our findings provide help for not only understanding of miRNAs in cancer but also for the specific identification of novel miRNAs as miRNA oncogenes and tumor <b>suppressors.</b> I...|$|R

5|$|In 10–20% of endometrial cancers, mostly Grade3 (the highest histologic grade), {{mutations}} {{are found}} in a tumor <b>suppressor</b> gene, commonly p53 or PTEN. In 20% of endometrial hyperplasias and 50% of endometrioid cancers, PTEN suffers a loss-of-function mutation or a null mutation, making it less effective or completely ineffective. Loss of PTEN function leads to up-regulation of the PI3k/Akt/mTOR pathway, which causes cell growth. The p53 pathway can either be suppressed or highly activated in endometrial cancer. When a mutant version of p53 is overexpressed, the cancer tends to be particularly aggressive. P53 mutations and chromosome instability are associated with serous carcinomas, which tend to resemble ovarian and Fallopian carcinomas. Serous carcinomas are thought to develop from endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|PTEN and p27 loss of {{function}} mutations {{are associated with a}} good prognosis, particularly in obese women. The Her2/neu oncogene, which indicates a poor prognosis, is expressed in 20% of endometrioid and serous carcinomas. CTNNB1 (beta-catenin; a transcription gene) mutations are found in 14–44% of endometrial cancers and may indicate a good prognosis, but the data is unclear. Beta-catenin mutations are commonly found in endometrial cancers with squamous cells. FGFR2 mutations are found in approximately 10% of endometrial cancers, and their prognostic significance is unclear. SPOP is another tumor <b>suppressor</b> gene found to be mutated in some cases of endometrial cancer: 9% of clear cell endometrial carcinomas and 8% of serous endometrial carcinomas have mutations in this gene.|$|E
5|$|Several {{experimental}} and clinical {{studies have indicated}} that aberrations and deregulations of the UPS contribute to the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative and myodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Pick's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, and motor neuron diseases, polyglutamine (PolyQ) diseases, Muscular dystrophies and several rare forms of neurodegenerative diseases associated with dementia. As part of the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS), the proteasome maintains cardiac protein homeostasis and thus plays a significant role in cardiac Ischemic injury, ventricular hypertrophy and Heart failure. Additionally, evidence is accumulating that the UPS plays an essential role in malignant transformation. UPS proteolysis {{plays a major role in}} responses of cancer cells to stimulatory signals that are critical for the development of cancer. Accordingly, gene expression by degradation of transcription factors, such as p53, c-Jun, c-Fos, NF-κB, c-Myc, HIF-1α, MATα2, STAT3, sterol-regulated element-binding proteins and androgen receptors are all controlled by the UPS and thus involved in the development of various malignancies. Moreover, the UPS regulates the degradation of tumor <b>suppressor</b> gene products such as adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) in colorectal cancer, retinoblastoma (Rb). and von Hippel-Lindau tumor <b>suppressor</b> (VHL), as well as a number of proto-oncogenes (Raf, Myc, Myb, Rel, Src, Mos, Abl). The UPS is also involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses. This activity is usually attributed to the role of proteasomes in the activation of NF-κB which further regulates the expression of pro inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-β, IL-8, adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, P selectine) and prostaglandins and nitric oxide (NO). Additionally, the UPS also plays a role in inflammatory responses as regulators of leukocyte proliferation, mainly through proteolysis of cyclines and the degradation of CDK inhibitors. Lastly, autoimmune disease patients with SLE, Sjogren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) predominantly exhibit circulating proteasomes which can be applied as clinical biomarkers.|$|E

We report here the isolation of a set of second-site conformational <b>suppressors</b> which alleviate the defect in such folding mutants. The <b>suppressors</b> were selected for their ability to correct the defects of missense tailspike polypeptide chains, generated by growth of gene 9 amber mutants on Salmonella host strains inserting either tyrosine, serine, glutamine or leucine at the nonsense codons.
