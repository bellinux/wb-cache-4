25|$|The {{centre of}} a lava flow is {{commonly}} massive and crystalline, flow banded or layered, with microscopic groundmass crystals.

25|$|The {{morphology}} of breccias {{associated with}} ore deposits varies from tabular <b>sheeted</b> veins and clastic dikes associated with overpressured sedimentary strata, to large-scale intrusive diatreme breccias (breccia pipes), or even some synsedimentary diatremes formed solely by the overpressure of pore fluid within sedimentary basins. Hydrothermal breccias are usually formed by hydrofracturing of rocks by highly pressured hydrothermal fluids. They {{are typical of}} the epithermal ore environment and are intimately associated with intrusive-related ore deposits such as skarns, greisens and porphyry-related mineralisation. Epithermal deposits are mined for copper, silver and gold.|$|E

25|$|Parachartergus fraternus nests {{are covered}} by a {{protective}} envelope which characterizes this species. The envelope often has only one opening to the soil which protects against ants, the wasp's main enemy. The wasp envelope is gray and constructed of long fibers. It is also single <b>sheeted</b> and has horizontal ridges. Peduncles are usually 6mm wide and 7mm long and are composed of vegetal fibers that {{are attached to the}} base of the nest with saliva. The nests have several layers of cells that are fixed to leaves or branches that branch out to a lateral stalk. The openings to the cells in the nest are directed downwards and have hexagonal walls. Although the sizes of nests vary, the diameter of these cells is usually around 4mm while the height is around 10mm. Some colonies have two combs with 98 cells while others may have 12 combs with 1751 cells.|$|E

The northern room is utilised by the St John's Ambulance Service and has been divided by <b>sheeted</b> partitions into cubicles. Facilities include an early iron-framed, wheeled ambulance stretcher. The southern room has been converted into an English-style pub, complete with appropriately decorated entry. There are toilets located at each end of the subfloor, accessed from the front – the men's toilet at the southern end and the women's at the northern end. The men's toilet retains an early lead-light fanlight above the entrance door, but both facilities have been remodelled internally.|$|E
25|$|Fuselage {{structure}} was typical for the period, being welded chrome-moly tubing with light wood strips to fair the shape in {{and covered with}} fabric. Wings were built around two solid spruce spars with the airfoil formed from trussed ribs made from plywood and spruce. The leading edge was covered in aluminum sheeting and the whole assembly covered in fabric. Ailerons were interconnected with a strut mounted to the trailing edge and on some versions were <b>sheeted</b> with ribbed aluminum. Most models were not fitted with flaps – the VKS-7F, built for the Civilian Pilot Training Program (CPTP) being the exception. It was fitted with split flaps only on the undersides of the upper wings and at mid chord, inboard and {{just ahead of the}} ailerons. Wing bracing was with a canted N strut joining upper and lower wings, assisted by a single strut bracing the lower wing to the upper fuselage longeron, there being no bracing wires. Elevators and rudder were built up from welded steel tubing braced with wire cables, and both could be trimmed, the elevators in flight and the rudder with a ground adjustable tab. Normally the main undercarriage was made up of a pair of vees, sprung with oleo/spring struts and provided with brakes as standard equipment, and a free-castoring tailwheel sprung with triangulated shock cords. was fitted to most aircraft, although a small number for Brazil were fitted with a tail skid. Floats were also offered as an option, starting with the UIC which had Edo P-3300 floats. Later types (including the UKC, YKC and CJC) were offered with Edo 38-3430 floats.|$|E

2500|$|The term {{ophiolite}} {{was originally}} used by Alexandre Brongniart [...] for {{an assemblage of}} green rocks (serpentine subgroup, diabase) in the Alps; Gustav Steinmann later modified its use to include serpentine, pillow lava, and chert ("Steinmann's trinity"), again based on occurrences in the Alps. The term was little-used in other areas until the late 1950s to early 1960s, with the recognition that this assemblage provided another term for oceanic crust {{and the process of}} seafloor spreading. This recognition was tied to two events: (1) the observation of magnetic anomaly stripes on the seafloor, parallel to oceanic ridge systems, interpreted by Frederick Vine and Drummond Matthews [...] to represent the formation of new crust at the oceanic ridge and its subsequent symmetric spreading away from that ridge, and (2) the observation of a <b>sheeted</b> dyke complex within the Troodos Ophiolite (Cyprus) by Ian Graham Gass and co-workers, which must have formed by repetitive extension of crust and intrusion of magma, resulting in a formation consisting of 100% dikes with no older wall rocks preserved within the complex. Moores and Vine concluded that the <b>sheeted</b> dike complex at Troodos could form only by a process similar to the seafloor spreading proposed by Vine and Matthews. Thus, it became widely accepted that ophiolites represent oceanic crust that had been emplaced on land.|$|E
