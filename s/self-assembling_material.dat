40|$|Renewable energy {{conversion}} and storage, and greenhouse gas emission-free technologies {{are within the}} primary tasks and challenges for the society. Hydrogen fuel, produced by alkaline water electrolysis is fulfilling all these demands, however the technology is economically feeble, limited by the slow rate of oxygen evolution reaction. Complex metal oxides were suggested to overcome this problem being low-cost efficient catalysts. However, the insufficient long-term stability, degradation of structure and electrocatalytic activity are restricting their utilization. Here we report on a new perovskite-based <b>self-assembling</b> <b>material</b> BaCo 0. 98 Ti 0. 02 O 3 -δ:Co 3 O 4 with superior performance, showing outstanding properties compared to current state-of-the-art materials without degeneration of its properties even at 353 K. By chemical and structural analysis the degradation mechanism was identified and modified by selective doping. Short-range order and chemical composition rather than long-range order are factors determining the outstanding performance. The derived general design rules {{can be used for}} further development of oxide-based electrocatalytic materials.

40|$|This thesis investigates ways {{in which}} a {{nanoscale}} production line may be built from synthetic DNA components. One property of a production line is motion, the coordinated movement of components, in this case strands of DNA, between specific locations. Another property {{is the ability to}} assemble a product, where smaller molecular building blocks are attached to D A and react when brought together by the DNA assembly line. An important fea- ture of either task is the ability of the mechanism to proceed with minimum user interaction: it is preferable that the assembly line be autonomous. The challenges and design principles of molecular machines working in nano- scale environments are first considered. Previous studies demonstrating the use of synthetic DNA not only as a <b>self-assembling</b> <b>material</b> to build nano- structures, but also to coordinate motion, are summarized. All DNA nano- machines that operate through the exchange of DNA strands are coordinated by toeholds. A 'split toehold', one that combines two smaller toeholds on distal sections of DNA held in proximity, is proposed as a way to allow a single cargo strand to interact with many different components. A molecular motor is then developed that transports a cargo between track locations. The fuel strands are hairpins, that carry instructions directing the cargo to the next anchorage. The switching of cargo direction in response to the chemical environment is also investigated. Two mechanisms that may allow the autonomous assembly of components are investigated, one of which is demonstrated using DNA-linked cleavable molecular building blocks. Further extensions to the mechanism are investi- gated, for example, the ability to use the DNA mechanism itself as a barcode containing information on the order of assembled ingredients.

Natural materials are continuously active with dynamic processes occurring, such as growth, shrinkage and transport mechanisms under the consumption of energy. Extending the knowledge on out-of- equilibrium self-assembly will open new opportunities for programmable and self-healing materials. In this thesis a new design approach for out-of-equilibrium formed <b>self-assembled</b> <b>materials</b> is described and tested experimentally.

40|$|The {{importance}} of noncovalent interactions {{in the realm}} of biological materials continues to inspire efforts to create artificial supramolecular polymeric architectures. These types of <b>self-assembled</b> <b>materials</b> hold great promise as environmentally stimuli-responsive materials because they are capable of adjusting their various structural parameters, such as chain length, architecture, conformation, and dynamics, to new surrounding environments upon exposure to appropriate external stimuli. Nevertheless, in spite of considerable advances in the area of responsive materials, it has proved challenging to create synthetic <b>self-assembled</b> <b>materials</b> that respond to highly disparate analytes and whose environmentally induced changes in structure can be followed directly through both various spectroscopic and X-ray diffraction analyses. Herein, we report a new set of artificial <b>self-assembled</b> <b>materials</b> obtained by simply mixing two appropriately chosen, heterocomplementary macrocyclic receptors, namely a tetrathiafulvalene-functionalized calix[4]pyrrole and a bis(dinitrophenyl) -meso-substituted calix[4]pyrrole. The resulting polymeric materials, stabilized by combination of donor–acceptor and hydrogen bonding interactions, undergo dynamic, reversible dual guest-dependent structural transformations upon exposure to two very different types of external chemical inputs, namely chloride anion and trinitrobenzene. The structure and dynamics of the copolymers and their analyte-dependent responsive behavior was established via single crystal X-ray crystallography, SEM, heterocomplementary isodesmic analysis, 1 - and 2 D NMR, and dynamic light scattering spectroscopies.

40|$|A {{detailed}} study of the supramolecular organization of two series of peptide-based diblock oligomers is reported.

The unique feature of these rod-coil molecules is that the conformation of the α-helical peptide rod is sensitive to temperature. As a result, the supramolecular organization of these rod-coil oligomers can be manipulated not only via changes in the block length ratio or chemical composition but also via temperature-induced conformational changes in the rod segments.

40|$|The {{presence}} of regular patterns in natural and technological phenomena is pervasive, often being present in both time and space. To increase {{our understanding of}} many phenomena where patterns are present, measurable quantities or metrics are typically defined and used for quantitative analysis. In many fields of study, methods for robustly computing these metrics do not exist, impeding further progress in these areas. <b>Self-assembled</b> <b>materials</b> is one area where significant advances in microscopy techniques have enabled the generation of detailed imaging of self-assembled domains. Unfortunately, image analysis methods to quantify self-assembly patterns in this imaging data either do not exist or are severely limited in their applicability. With the ability to acquire this data but not quantify it, scientists and engineers face significant challenges in determining relationships between structure and properties of these materials. In this work, a generalized method for the quantitative analysis of pattern images is developed which addresses many of the existing challenges, specifically for the field of <b>self-assembled</b> <b>materials.</b> The presented method is based upon a family of localized functions called shapelets and is fundamentally different from existing approaches. The method is composed of sets of shapelets reformulated to be "steerable" filters and a guided machine learning algorithm.

The orientation and periodicity of the resulting array of spherical microdomains are governed by the commensurability between the block copolymer period and the template period and is accurately described by a free-energy model.
