5|$|The main ISMB {{conference is}} usually held over {{three days and}} {{consists}} of presentations, poster sessions and keynote talks. Most presentations are given in multiple parallel tracks; however, keynote talks are presented in a single track and are chosen to reflect outstanding research in bioinformatics. Notable ISMB keynote speakers have included eight Nobel laureates. The recipients of the ISCB Overton Prize and ISCB Accomplishment by a <b>Senior</b> <b>Scientist</b> Award are invited to give keynote talks {{as part of the}} programme. The proceedings of the conference are currently published by the journal Bioinformatics.|$|E
5|$|The 1969 Mansfield Amendment, {{which ended}} {{military}} funding of non-military research, {{the end of}} the Vietnam War, and {{the end of the}} Apollo program reduced ARC's funding from DARPA and NASA. SRI's management, which disapproved of Engelbart's approach to running the center, placed the remains of ARC under the control of artificial intelligence researcher Bertram Raphael, who negotiated the transfer of the laboratory to a company called Tymshare. Engelbart's house in Atherton, California burned down during this period, causing him and his family further problems. Tymshare took over NLS and the lab that Engelbart had founded, hired most of the lab's staff including its creator as a <b>Senior</b> <b>Scientist,</b> renamed the software Augment, and offered it as a commercial service via its new Office Automation Division. Tymshare was already somewhat familiar with NLS; when ARC was still operational, it had experimented with its own local copy of the NLS software on a minicomputer called OFFICE-1, as part of a joint project with ARC.|$|E
5|$|The {{completion}} {{of all the}} major objectives, {{as well as some}} that were not considered vital, upgraded the telescope to its most technologically advanced state since its launch nineteen years ago, and made it more powerful than ever. The upgrades will also help Hubble to see deeper into the universe, and farther into the past, closer to the time of the Big Bang. Hubble's importance to science is not just seen in the dramatic images it provides, but also in the volume of work it has generated – an average of fourteen scientific articles are published each week based on data gathered from the telescope. Officially, the upgrades should extend Hubble's life through 2014, but Hubble Space Telescope <b>Senior</b> <b>Scientist</b> David Leckrone noted prior to the mission that if all of the mission's objectives were successful, the telescope could easily last longer than that. The next large telescope scheduled to be launched is the James Webb Space Telescope in 2018, which is infrared-only, so to have Hubble, which has ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared capabilities, still operational after 2018 would be of great benefit to the scientific community.|$|E

In this paper, we propose a model to analyze the determinants of a <b>senior</b> <b>scientist’s</b> decisions about allocating time between these tasks. The results of this decision depend upon the characteristics of the research project, the <b>senior</b> <b>scientist’s</b> concern for training and the expected innate ability of the junior scientist involved. We analyze the role that a regulator can play in defining both the value of scientific projects and the future population of independent scientists...|$|R

40|$|Using a new dataset {{encompassing}} {{more than}} 2, 000 inventions made by Max Planck Society researchers from 1980 to 2004, we study {{the effects of}} information asymmetry and imperfect knowledge transfer on the licensing and successful commercialization of technologies from public research, distinguishing among types of licensees as well as invention and inventor characteristics. Technologies licensed to foreign firms and spin-offs are less often commercialized, while collaborative inventions are more often commercialized. <b>Senior</b> <b>scientists</b> are more successful in licensing, but their inventions are less often commercialized. Our findings suggest a specific role of spin-offs in transferring technologies invented by <b>senior</b> <b>scientists...</b>|$|R

25|$|Daniel Nepstad, a <b>Senior</b> <b>Scientist</b> at the Woods Hole Research Center {{which focuses}} on {{tackling}} two deforestation issues in Brazil has demonstrated that Brazil's deforestation rates have been cut nearly in half in recent years {{through a combination of}} government intervention and economic trends. Since 2004 the country has established more than 200,000 square kilometres of parks, nature reserves, and national forests in the Amazon rainforest. These protected areas, if fully enforced, aim to prevent an estimated one billion tons of carbon from being transferred to the atmosphere through deforestation by the year 2015. The academic evidence suggests that the creation of public lands, through the assignment of property rights, reduces incentives to deforest land for agricultural conversion and has contributed to reduction in land related conflict.|$|E
