40|$|Previous study {{strongly}} suggests that <b>silicotic</b> <b>fibrosis</b> is mediated by macrophages and their soluble mediators. The biochemical properties of the mediators involved in <b>silicotic</b> <b>fibrosis,</b> however, are as yet ill defined. The current study, therefore, determined whether human monocyte-macrophages treated with fibrogenic silica dust released factors capable of activating fibroblasts as measured {{by an increase in}} fibroblast proliferation. Silica, but not nonfibrogenic diamond dust, stimulated the release of fibroblast proliferation factors. Moreover, the level of fibroblast proliferation activity was comparable with the level of thymocyte proliferation (interleukin- 1) activity in the same culture supernatants. The factors responsible for these seemingly diverse activities were found to behave identically when analyzed by gel filtration chromatography, size exclusion chromatography, isoelectrofocusing, ion exchange chromatography, and hydrophobic chromatography. Moreover, the response of these factors to four different proteases and heat (56 degrees C) was also identical, which shows that their comigration on various separation media could not be explained by noncovalent interaction between otherwise unrelated species. The data demonstrate that a monocyte-derived thymocyte proliferation factor having the molecular properties of interleukin 1 is capable of regulating fibroblast proliferation. In silicosis and other fibrotic diseases, the local release of interleukin 1 may contribute to abnormal connective tissue deposition by stimulating fibroblast proliferation, and thereby, amplifying other signals stimulating the synthesis of connective tissue components...|$|E
40|$|A left lung {{allotransplantation}} {{was performed}} on a 42 -year-old man dying from hypertrophic emphysema, massive <b>silicotic</b> <b>fibrosis,</b> and tuberculosis with intractable cor pulmonale. His condition improved {{for the first five}} days, then the transplant became more and more difficult to ventilate. Lung scans performed on the last five days showed the transplant was better perfused than the remaining lung. This ventilation-perfusion imbalance resulted in anoxic heart arrest on the 11 th day. Postmortem examination showed the transplant was compressed by the remaining lung. Although the edematous load was identical in both lungs, compliance of the transplant was only half that of the other. Desquamative pneumonitis, found in the transplant, could represent infection or rejection. © 1971, American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

40|$|To clarify any causal {{relationship}} between lung cancer and silicosis, we studied clinicopathological findings in 50 men, mainly tunneling workers, aged from 47 to 85 years with both diseases. The histological types were : squamous cell carcinoma, 29 cases; small cell carcinoma, 10; adenocarcinoma, 6; large cell carcinoma, 4; and adenosquamous carcinoma, 1. The high frequency of cancer, particularly squamous and small cell cancer, in sites of <b>silicotic</b> <b>fibrosis</b> suggested a {{causal relationship}}, perhaps via a carcinogen. If a weak carcinogen accumulastes in fibrotic leasions, its prolonged presence may induce cancer. We believe that silica alone is rarely carcinogenic, {{but it may}} interact with polycyclin aromatic hydrocarbons from cigarette smoking or from pyrolysis, or with other substances encountered in occupational environments...|$|E
40|$|A 43 -year-old {{man with}} a long history of dyspnea which had {{progressively}} worsened over the preceding month is presented. He had worked in an antimony mine for 3 years. Radiologically, there were diffuse reticulonodular shadowing opacities in both lung parenchymas. Histopathologic examination of the open-lung biopsy specimen revealed alveolar spaces filled with dust-laden macrophages and amorphous proteinaceous semifluid, the latter being immunoreactive for Human Surfactant Apoprotein A, associated with marked interstitial accumulation of the similar-looking macrophages along the bronchovascular bundles and mild interstitial <b>fibrosis.</b> <b>Silicotic</b> nodules or mixed dust fibrosis were not seen. The patient was diagnosed as silicoproteinosis with unusual histopathological features because he had worked in an antimony mine for only 3 years and had 86 % silica in a mineralogical analysis. Pneumoconiosis is a rare lung disease which may be confused with other interstitial lung diseases. Clinical, radiological and unusual histopathologic features of this rare case are presented and discussed with the differential diagnosis, especially of mixed dust pneumoconiosis.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} pulmonary lymphocytes in regulating the secretion by alveolar macrophages (AM) of mitogenic activity for lung fibroblasts, in an experimental model of {{the initial stages of}} <b>silicotic</b> inflammation and <b>fibrosis.</b> Following intratracheal instillation of silica, pulmonary parenchymal lymphocytes produced a lymphokine(s) that caused modest stimulation of the secretion of mitogenic activity by normal AM. Co-culture of small numbers of lymphocytes from silica-injected animals with AM induced enhanced secretion of fibroblast growth factor activity which was comparable to the maximal response elicited by recombinant interferon-gamma. Lymphocytes from animals given non-fibrogenic titanium dioxide exhibited no such effects. The stimulatory effect of lymphocytes from silica-treated animals in co-culture with macrophages was abrogated when the cells were separated by a microporous membrane. Our findings demonstrate that lymphocytes participating in the response to pulmonary deposition of silica are able to induce the secretion of a growth factor(s) for fibroblasts by pulmonary macrophages, possibly via lymphokines expressed on the cell surface or secreted at sites of cell-to-cell contact...|$|R
30|$|Unlike the {{previously}} {{reported cases of}} SCC presenting as GGNs, the present case is unique in that the patient had underlying pneumoconiosis. In the background lung, <b>fibrosis,</b> <b>silicotic</b> nodules, and macules which are characteristic of pneumoconiosis were identified. Also, focal emphysema {{was found in the}} background lung which seemed to secondary to smoking or pneumoconiosis. Pneumoconiosis increases the risk of lung cancer, SCC being the most frequent type of associated lung cancer [11]. Inhalation of carcinogens {{may play a role in}} the pathogenesis of lung cancer [12]. It has been reported that SCC arising in patients with pneumoconiosis are significantly more frequently of the peripheral type than those in patients without pneumoconiosis. Peripheral-type SCC also arise preferentially in the lower lobes of patients with pneumoconiosis [11]. In the present case, given that the histologic tumor type was SCC and the tumor arose from a lower lobe, pneumoconiosis may have contributed to its development. SCC should be included in the differential diagnosis of peripherally located GGNs, especially in patients at high risk of SCC of the lung such as those with pneumoconiosis.|$|R
40|$|Objective 　To {{investigate}} the changes of N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (Ac-SDKP) and {{angiotensin converting enzyme}} (ACE) /angiotensin Ⅱ(Ang Ⅱ) /angiotensin Ⅱtype 1 receptor (AT 1 R) axis {{and their impact on}} the development and progression of <b>silicotic</b> <b>fibrosis.</b> Methods 　Sixty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 6 groups (n= 10). The rats inhaled dust for 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks (w) respectively to reproduce silicosis model. HE staining was performed to observe the pathological changes of the lung tissue. The expression of αsmooth muscle actin (α-SMA), collagen Ⅰ(Col Ⅰ), fibronectin (Fn), ACE and AT 1 R were measured by Western blotting. The levels of Ac-SDKP and Ang Ⅱin lung tissue were detected by ELISA. Results 　Macrophage infiltration and widened alveolar wall were observed by HE staining in the silicosis 2 -w group. Isolated cell lesions which composed of macrophages were seen in silicosis 4 -w group. The alveolar wall widened obviously and the number of silicotic nodules increased at 8 w and 12 w. The fusion of silicotic lesions, interstitial fibrosis and fibrous lesions were observed at 16 w. Compared with control group, the expressions of α-SMA, Col Ⅰand Fn protein in silicosis 4 -, 8 -, 12 -, and 16 -w group increased gradually. In silicosis 2 -, 4 -, 8 -, 12 -, 16 -w group, the expressions of ACE, Ang Ⅱand AT 1 R gradually increased compared to the control. The level of Ac-SDKP in the lung tissue of silicosis 2 -w group was significantly higher than that in control group, and then decreased gradually, and significantly lower in the silicosis 12 -and 16 -w group than the control (P< 0. 05). Conclusion 　Along with the development and progression of silicosis, ACE, Ang Ⅱ, and AT 1 R expressions gradually increase in local lung tissue, while the expression of Ac-SDKP gradually decreases. Ac-SDKP and Ang Ⅱsignal would participate the <b>silicotic</b> <b>fibrosis</b> process in rats. 		 		DOI: 10. 11855 /j. issn. 0577 - 7402. 2016. 09. 0...|$|E

Effect {{of general}} dietary {{deficiency}} and protein malnutrition on the fibrogenesis caused by silica dust in rats. In {{order to determine}} whether the dietary deficiency, which may occur in miners in India, is likely to influence their response to silica dust, two experiments were carried out on rats. In both experiments rats were exposed to silica dust by intratracheal inoculation of saline suspension, the dose being sufficient to cause marked fibrosis in normal rats. In the first experiment rats were fed on a multiple deficient diet and in the second on a diet grossly deficient in protein but otherwise adequate. Although these diets caused other evidence of dietary deficiency, in neither group was there any difference in the extent of <b>silicotic</b> <b>fibrosis</b> as assessed by histological or biochemical methods...|$|E
40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to {{determine}} whether the diffusion chamber technique can be used to decide the validity of the silica solubility theory of the pathogenesis of silicosis. Small chambers were constructed from membranes of a pore size which allowed free passage of colloidal silicic acid and tissue fluids but which prevented the entry of host cells and the exit of the larger silica particles. Significant fibrosis failed to develop around chambers containing five different forms of silicon dioxide when inserted subcutaneously and intraperitoneally in rats and rabbits. All five forms of silica were actively fibrogenic when brought into direct contact with peritoneal tissues. However, in vitro experiments suggest that colloidal silicic acid, the form which may be involved in <b>silicotic</b> <b>fibrosis,</b> does not escape from the chambers. Thus the biological results obtained by this technique do not necessarily invalidate the silica solubility theory of the pathogenesis of silicosis...|$|E

In addition to its primary tasks phagocyte and destroyer of microorganisms the macrophage plays a pivotal role in the genesis of <b>silicotic</b> <b>fibrosis,</b> and it is possible that similar mechanisms may hold for a variety of cryptogenic fibroses.

40|$|The {{cytotoxic}} {{action of}} quartz (DQ 12) particles on cultures of rat peritoneal macrophages, as {{estimated by the}} inhibition of the TTC-reductase activity, is considerably reduced by preincubation with glutamic acid and by adding sodium glutamate (15 mg/ml) to the drinking water of the rats donating the macrophages. This increase in macrophage resistance {{under the influence of}} glutamate is the most probable cause of the delay in the development of <b>silicotic</b> <b>fibrosis</b> shown in several experiments on rats intratracheally injected with quartz and then treated by prolonged administration of glutamate. This effect is probably connected with the influence of glutamate on the stability of the macrophage membranes, which can in its turn be explained by different mechanisms, including the influence on the synthesis and phosphorylation of adenosine nucleotides. Such an influence was shown in rats receiving glutamate by the change of the ATP/ADP ratio in macrophages, but not in erythrocytes. The resistance of rat erythrocytes to the haemolytic action of quartz is also not influenced by the action of glutamate neither in vitro nor in vivo. Such differences in the influences of glutamate on two types of cells, equally susceptible to quartz cytotoxicity but considerably differing in the character of energy metabolism, is an indirect proof {{of the role of the}} latter in the realisation of the anticytotoxic, and thereby antifibrogenic, effect of glutamate...|$|E
40|$|The {{activation}} of collagen synthesis during development of <b>silicotic</b> <b>fibrosis</b> was studied in rats exposed, in dusting chambers, to respirable SiO 2 for periods of 2, 4, 6 or 12 months. Control animals were exposed similarly to clean air or TiO 2. Development of fibrosis {{was followed by}} histological examination, measurement of lung weight and determination of lung collagen content (as hydroxyproline). A steady increase in lung weight and collagen content together with changes in cellularity and metabolic activity of the lungs, as ascertained by chemical determination of DNA and RNA, were measured in the lungs of the SiO 2 -exposed animals. Hybridization of total lung RNA, extracted at each time point, with cDNA probes specific for type I and type III procollagen mRNA levels showed {{that the development of}} fibrosis was associated with increased levels, as compared to age matched controls, of pulmonary procollagen mRNAs. Interestingly, the highest levels of procollagen mRNAs were observed in young (pretreatment control) animals, suggesting that during pulmonary development collagen metabolism in lungs is even greater than during development of fibrosis. In rats exposed to SiO 2 the increase in type III procollagen mRNA occurred earlier than the increase in type I procollagen mRNAs. These observations demonstrate both age-dependent and silicosis-related changes in pulmonary procollagen mRNA levels. The results suggest that development of silicosis is associated with an altered capacity of the lungs to regulate collagen accumulation...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Two stonemasons working {{together}} in an environment with high concentrations of quartz pursued very different clinical courses; one died of rapidly progressive silicosis and the other developed hilar adenopathy and, later, early massive fibrosis. The exposures to quartz of these two men were investigated to allow comment on the pathogenesis of severe silicosis relative to concentrations of dust. METHODS: Estimates of exposure were based on previously taken personal dust samples, detailed lifetime occupational histories, and semiquantitative exposure modelling. RESULTS: One {{of the men who}} died had a 30 year exposure estimated to have averaged < 0. 1 mg/m 3, leading to hilar node fibrosis and calcification, followed by a five year exposure to about 2 mg/m 3 which proved fatal. Estimates of exposure tallied with postmortem measurement of lung burden, suggesting retention of all dust deposited in the lungs over his final period of work. The younger man, working from the start of his apprenticeship alongside the older one, had a six year exposure to about 1. 5 mg/m 3, which caused hilar node enlargement and subsequent calcification but minimal lung involvement. CONCLUSIONS: Exposures to relatively low concentrations of quartz may be capable of causing hilar node fibrosis, impairing the clearance of any quartz inhaled subsequently. The findings support the concept that destruction of the hilar nodes by <b>silicotic</b> <b>fibrosis,</b> impairing lung clearance, has an important pathogenic {{role in the development of}} massive fibrosis, and in men subsequently exposed to very high concentrations of respirable quartz, rapidly progressive silicosis...|$|E

Paradoxically, destruction of collagen by the dual mechanisms of phagocytosis and the secretion of lytic enzymes may also occur. The relevance of this secretory function of the macrophage to the pathogenesis of destructive diseases of the lung such as emphysema remains to be determined. A title as general as "The Pulmonary Macrophage " allows considerable latitude of approach. Since the topic has been reviewed recently (1, 2), I will limit my remarks to an {{overview of}} the subject as seen by a pathologist and try to pose some of the many questions that remain unanswered. The macrophagic component of pulmonary clearance has an impressive adaptive capacity that can cope with very large particulate and aerosol loads. On occasion, however, either by virtue of an excessive load or the toxic nature of the particles, the macrophages may be overwhelmed. Such breaches of the defenses are seen in the black lung of the coal miner, farmer's lung, and the nodular fibrosis induced by the inhalation of silica. I propose to analyse some of these parameters and to examine the proposition that the macrophage itself may initiate, or at least participate in, the genesis of certain destructive and fibrotic diseases of the lung. In this context we will look at the macrophage and its interrelationships with other cells...|$|E
