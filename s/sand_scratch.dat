5000|$|Sanding {{is carried}} out before {{finishing}} to remove defects from the wood surface that will affect the appearance and performance of finishes that are subsequently applied to the wood. These defects include cutter marks and burns, scratches and indentations, small glue spots and raised grain. Sanding {{should not be used}} to eliminate larger defects such as gouges, and various forms of discolouration. Other techniques are used to remove these defects (see below). The key to preparing a defect free surface is to develop a sanding schedule that will quickly eliminate defects and leave the surface smooth enough so that tiny <b>scratches</b> produced by <b>sanding</b> cannot be seen when the wood is finished. A sanding schedule usually begins with sandpaper that is coarse enough to remove larger defects (typically 80 or 100 grit, but sometimes higher if the surface is already quite smooth), and progresses through a series of sandpaper grades that gradually remove the <b>sanding</b> <b>scratches</b> created by the previous sanding steps. A typical sanding schedule prior to wood finishing might involve sanding wood along the grain with the following grades of sandpaper, 80, 100, 120, 150 and finishing with 180 and sometimes 220 grit. The precise sanding schedule is a matter of trial and error because the appearance of a sanded surface depends on the wood you are sanding and the finish that will subsequently be applied to the wood. According to Nagyszalanczy, coarse grained woods with large pores such as oak hide <b>sanding</b> <b>scratches</b> better than fine grained wood and hence with such species {{it may be possible to}} use 180 or even 150 grit sandpaper as the final step in the sanding schedule. Conversely, <b>sanding</b> <b>scratches</b> are more easily seen in finer grained, harder woods and also end-grain, and hence, they require finer sandpaper (220 grit) during the final sanding stage. The sandpaper selected for the final sanding stage affects the colour of stained wood, and therefore when staining is part of finishing avoid sanding the wood to a very smooth finish. On the other hand, according to Nagyszalanczy if you are using an oil-based finish, it is desirable to sand the wood using higher grit sandpaper (400 grit) because oil tends to highlight <b>sanding</b> <b>scratches.</b> <b>Sanding</b> is very good at removing defects at wood surfaces, but it creates a surface that contains minute scratches in the form of microscopic valleys and ridges, and also slivers of wood cell wall material that are attached to the underlying wood. These sanding ridges and slivers of wood swell and spring-up, respectively, when sanded wood is finished with water-based finishes, creating a rough fuzzy surface. This defect is known as grain raising. It can be eliminated by wetting the surface with water, leaving the wood to dry and then lightly sanding the wood to remove the ‘raised grain’.|$|R
60|$|They {{made their}} retreat pretty well {{for about half}} the way, when, on a sudden, they saw they were not pursued only, but surrounded, {{and that some of}} their enemies were before them. This made them double their pace, and, seeing no remedy, they {{resolved}} to break through those that were before them, who were about eleven or twelve. Accordingly, as soon as they came within pistol shot of them, one of our men having, for want of shot, put almost a handful of gravel and small stones into his piece, fired among them, and the gravel and stones scattering, wounded almost all of them; for they being naked from the waist upwards, the least grain of <b>sand</b> <b>scratched</b> and hurt them, and made them bleed if it only entered the skin.|$|R

60|$|The {{wind was}} not a Sirocco or Simoon, such as we {{associate}} with the desert, but a New England northeaster,--and we sought shelter in vain under the sand-hills, for it blew all about them, rounding them into cones, and was sure to find us out on whichever side we sat. From time to time we lay down and drank at little pools in the sand, filled with pure fresh water, all that was left, probably, of a pond or swamp. The air was filled with dust like snow, and cutting sand which made the face tingle, and we saw {{what it must be}} to face it when the weather was drier, and, if possible, windier still,--to face a migrating sand-bar in the air, which has picked up its duds and is off,--to be whipped with a cat, not o' nine-tails, but of a myriad of tails, and each one a sting to it. A Mr. Whitman, a former minister of Wellfleet, used to write to his inland friends that the blowing <b>sand</b> <b>scratched</b> the windows so that he was obliged to have one new pane set every week, that he might see out.|$|R
50|$|Wood can be stained {{to change}} its colour or left unstained before {{application}} of lacquer, or other types of top-coats. Staining should enhance the appearance of wood by reducing colour variation between and within sapwood and heartwood. It also provides a way of giving bland looking woods such as poplar, the appearance of prized furniture woods such as ebony, mahogany or walnut. Wood can be stained using dyes or pigmented finishes. These finishes are available {{in a wide variety}} of colours, many of which are not part of the natural colour palette of wood, for example, blues and greens. Pigmented stains tend to highlight the grain (and also <b>sanding</b> <b>scratches),</b> whereas dyes do not have this effect and are more transparent. Wood can also be coloured by exposing it to chemicals that react with the wood to form coloured compounds. Chemical staining of wood is rarely carried out because it is easier to colour wood using dye or pigmented stain, however, ammonia fuming is a chemical staining method that is still occasionally used to darken woods such as oak that contain a lot of tannins. Staining of wood is difficult to control because some parts of the wood absorb more stain than others, which leads to problems such as blotchiness and streaking. For this reason, as pointed out by Flexner, many people prefer to omit the staining step when finishing wood.|$|R
5000|$|..."I am {{a painter}} {{with a simple}} ambition… to create {{beautiful}} paintings. I make large, contemporary, figurative works. I am passionate about colour, shocking, vibrant and intense, continually exploring the power it has to invade our senses and influence our emotions. I work on large sheets of prefabricated aluminium, priming the surface then throwing, rubbing, pouring and dripping inks and dyes, glitter and glosses, to form a background. This is then <b>sanded,</b> <b>scratched</b> and distressed, depending on what image will be overlaid. I continually experiment with a multitude of materials, seduced by their substances, fascinated with their movement, individual textures and how they respond to one another. As the painting evolves, I become intrigued with the marks, how the line within a magnified face or body, organically flows. It is as though the image has, at this stage, become a vehicle for the marks. Selecting elements from a photograph and magnifying them to such an extent, creates a new dynamic. The finished pieces are stylised and ordered, the line defining the independent sections of colour and texture. My subjects exist on many levels, portraying innocence yet also the lack of it. The children are story book beautiful, their unique spirit captured and immortalised in that perfect state. By securing a tender moment or snatches of childhood memories, they are incredibly sensual, captivating, reaching out to their viewer. My nudes are sensually erotic, beautifully demure yet subtly provocative. Influenced by Utamaro and the artists of the ‘floating world’ and more recently their influence on the Art Deco period of the early 20th century I am a painter in love with painting; with a passion and urgent need to create.""" ...|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} to keep laminate clean, as dust, dirt, and <b>sand</b> particles may <b>scratch</b> the surface over time in high-traffic areas. It is also important to keep laminate relatively dry, since sitting water/moisture can cause the planks to swell, warp, etc., though some brands are equipped with water-resistant coatings. Water spills aren't a problem if they're wiped up quickly, and not allowed to sit for a prolonged period of time.|$|R
50|$|Dust on {{the image}} plane is a {{constant}} issue for photographers, and especially so in digital photography. DSLR cameras are especially prone to dust problems because the sensor remains in place, whereas a film advances through the camera for each exposure. Debris in the camera, such as dust or <b>sand,</b> may <b>scratch</b> the film; a single grain of sand can damage a whole roll of film. As film cameras age, they can develop burs in their rollers. With a digital SLR, dust is difficult to avoid but is easy to rectify using a computer with image-editing software. Some digital SLRs have systems that remove dust from the sensor by vibrating or knocking it, sometimes in conjunction with software that remembers where dust is located and removes dust-affected pixels from images.|$|R

40|$|Creating {{a robust}} superhydrophobic surface on the {{conventional}} engineering materials at mass production {{is of great}} importance for self–cleaning, anti–icing, non–wetting surface and low flow resistance in industrial applications. Herein, we report a roll–to–roll strategy to create durable and robust superhydrophobic surfaces with designed micro–/nano– scale hierarchical structures on many conventional engineering materials by combining electrical discharge machining, coating of carbon nanoparticles, and followed by oil penetration and drying. The treated surface shows good superhydrophobic properties with static water contact angle of 170 ± 2 o and slide angle of 3 ± 1 o. The treated surface also exhibits good resilience and maintains the performance after tested in various harsh conditions including water flushing for several days, <b>sand</b> abrasion, <b>scratching</b> with sandpapers and corrosive solution. Significantly, the superhydrophobic surfaces also shows a high efficiency of self–cleaning properties even after oil–contamination during applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{tribological}} {{properties of}} two powder metallurgical (PM) tool steels, {{high and low}} nitrogen containing, are investigated by means of three different wear tests: ball-on-disc, rubber wheel and scratch test. The ball-on-disc tests showed two distinct friction curves corresponding to each material. In order to simulate the tribosystem existing in metal powder compaction dies, the rubber wheel and the scratch test were modified. The rubber wheel test was performed using ferrous powder instead of <b>sand,</b> and <b>scratch</b> testing {{was carried out by}} sliding a powder compact over the tool steels. The scratch tests indicated a higher steady-state coefficient of friction for the low nitrogen containing PM steel as compared with the high nitrogen containing alloy. Additionally, the results from the rubber wheel tests were in agreement with industrial experiences, showing the low nitrogen containing tool steel to suffer from severe galling.

25|$|Already in his patent {{application}} of 1886 Pollak {{wrote that the}} capacitance of the capacitor increased if {{the surface of the}} anode foil was roughened. A number of methods have since been developed for roughening the anode surface, mechanical methods like <b>sand</b> blasting or <b>scratching,</b> and chemical etching with acids and acid salts forced by high currents. Some of these methods were developed in the CD factory between 1931 and 1938. Today (2014), electro-chemically etching of low voltage foils can achieve up to a 200 fold increase in surface area compared to a smooth surface. Progress relating to the etching process is the reason for the ongoing reduction in the dimensions of aluminum electrolytic capacitors over the past decades.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the selection of bedding material by broiler chickens during the rearing period and whether the choice was determinant to their performing a specific behavior. To achieve this objective, a choice test was designed. A choice pen was constructed where birds could move freely around the four selected materials (straw, wood shavings, rice hulls and sand). Chickens were introduced in this pen in four groups of eight birds, three days a week for one hour per day and group, for four weeks. The location and the activity performed by each broiler were recorded every five minutes. Results showed a preference for sand compared with the other three substrates. However, differences between the behaviors performed in each bedding material were shown mainly for resting (preferably performed on wood shavings and straw), dust bathing (on <b>sand),</b> pecking and <b>scratching</b> (on rice hulls). Other factors, such as the time of day, were also found to have effects on fighting and drinking, and changes in behavioral patterns (resting, preening, eating, standing and pecking) were also detected as broilers grew older...|$|R
