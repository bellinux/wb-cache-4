If any of these ever get out of hand, and there is no legal justification for banning, the Judges simply impose a heavy tax on them, restricting them to only the few very wealthy citizens.|$|E

50|$|Equipment failure rarely causes {{fatalities}} and injuries. Approximately one in 750 deployments of a {{main parachute}} {{result in a}} malfunction. Ram-air parachutes typically spin uncontrollably when malfunctioning, and must be jettisoned before deploying the reserve parachute. Reserve parachutes are packed and deployed differently; they are also designed more conservatively and built and tested to more exacting standards so they are more reliable than main parachutes, but the real safety advantage comes from the probability of an unlikely main malfunction multiplied by the even less likely probability of a reserve malfunction. This yields an even smaller probability of a double malfunction although {{the possibility of a}} main malfunction that cannot be cutaway causing a reserve malfunction is a very real risk.Parachuting disciplines such as BASE jumping or those that involve equipment such as wing suit flying and <b>sky</b> <b>surfing</b> have a higher risk factor due to the lower mobility of the jumper and the greater risk of entanglement. For this reason, these disciplines are generally practiced by experienced jumpers.|$|E
5000|$|Oz, officially the Sydney-Melbourne Conurbation, is {{a fictional}} mega-city in the Judge Dredd comic, {{located in the}} south east of Australia. It was the main setting for the Judge Dredd strip Oz. Like most of the mega-cities of the time Oz is ruled by a Judge system. According to the Judge Dredd D20 RPG Oz was where the sport of <b>sky</b> <b>surfing</b> began. Characteristics: The Judges of Oz are shown in the Judge Dredd story to be {{involved}} in gambling and are shown to be only half-heartedly trying to prevent the 'Supersurf' race.Geography: The Mega-city of 'Oz' or 'Sydney-Melbourne Conurbation' occupies the greater part of the territory currently occupied by the Australian states of New South Wales and Victoria. The Sydney Opera House is still standing when Judge Dredd visits Oz, and later in the story it is shown that the Australian outback has become to Oz what the 'Cursed Earth' is to the Mega Cities of the North American Continent. The megalith uluru also features prominently in the story 'Oz'.|$|E

40|$|Extreme {{sports such}} as {{mountain}} and rock climbing, kayaking, mountain biking, flying small airplanes, off-road vehicles, white water rafting and <b>sky</b> <b>surfing</b> are often perceived as outlets beneficial to citizens of first world countries where risk is not a habitual part of everyday life. It is a common perception that the participation in these extreme sports is valuable for physical, spiritual, emotional, and cultural reasons. However, the perspective of local/native people and wildlife {{is one that has}} not been taken into account when considering the implications of extreme sports. It is a perspective that will affect the lives of all humans and all wildlife if not fully discussed. This paper will address the environmental impact of extreme sports, risk-taking, and adventure racing, and the growing encroachment upon wilderness areas in relation to fuel use, erosion, pollution, and waste disposal...|$|E
