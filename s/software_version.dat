5|$|When Rovio {{began writing}} new {{versions}} of the game for other devices, new issues came to light. As the team began working on a version for Android systems, they observed {{the large number of}} configurations of device types and {{versions of the}} Android software. The number of combinations of <b>software</b> <b>version,</b> processor speed and even user interfaces was significantly larger than that for the iOS version. Ultimately, the team settled on a minimum set of requirements, even though that left nearly 30 types of Android phones unable to run the game, including some newly released phones. It was released on October 15, 2010. One month after the initial release on Android, Rovio Mobile began designing a lite version of the game for these other devices.|$|E

25|$|Photo Gallery is an {{optional}} application to view, create and group photos from PS3, which is installed {{separately from the}} system software at 105MB. It was introduced in system <b>software</b> <b>version</b> 2.60 and provides a range of tools for sorting through and displaying the system's pictures. The key feature of this application {{is that it can}} organize photos into groups according to various criteria. Notable categorizations are colors, ages, or facial expressions {{of the people in the}} photos. Slideshows can be viewed with the application, along with music and playlists. The software was updated with the release of system <b>software</b> <b>version</b> 3.40 allowing users to upload and browse photos on Facebook and Picasa.|$|E

25|$|According to Microsoft, {{the most}} {{up-to-date}} firmware version is 4.5 (114) for the Zune HD, which replaces the original player firmware that ships on the device, 4.0 (356). In {{the case of}} the Zune 4, 8, 16, 30, 80, and 120 players, the most current player <b>software</b> <b>version</b> is 3.3, which provides compatibility with Zune 4.2. Version 3.3 was primarily a bug fix release and was released on January 26, 2010.|$|E
25|$|Starting with system <b>software</b> <b>version</b> 3.90, PSP-2000, PSP-3000 and PSP-N1000 {{can use the}} Skype VoIP service. The PSP-2000 {{requires}} a headset for this feature while the microphone {{is built into the}} PSP-3000 and PSP-N1000. Due to hardware constraints, {{it is not possible to}} use the VoIP service on PSP-1000. The service allows Skype calls to be made over Wi-Fi and on the PSP Go over the Bluetooth Modem feature. Users must purchase Skype credit in order to make calls to non Skype devices such as a landline or mobile phone.|$|E

25|$|Microsoft {{claims that}} audio encoded with WMA sounds better than MP3 {{at the same}} bit rate; Microsoft also claims that audio encoded with WMA at lower bit rates sound better than MP3 at higher bit rates. Double blind {{listening}} tests with other lossy audio codecs have shown varying results, from failure to support Microsoft's claims about its superior quality to supremacy over other codecs. One independent test conducted in May 2004 at 128kbit/s showed that WMA was roughly equivalent to LAME MP3; inferior to AAC and Vorbis; and superior to ATRAC3 (<b>software</b> <b>version).</b>|$|E
25|$|From the {{fifth-generation}} iPod on, Apple {{introduced a}} user-configurable volume limit {{in response to}} concerns about hearing loss. Users report that in the sixth-generation iPod, the maximum volume output level is limited to 100dB in EU markets. Apple previously had to remove iPods from shelves in France for exceeding this legal limit. However, users who have bought a new sixth-generation iPod in late 2013 have reported a new option {{that allowed them to}} disable the EU volume limit. It has been said that these new iPods came with an updated software that allowed this change. Older sixth-generation iPods, however, are unable to update to this <b>software</b> <b>version.</b>|$|E
500|$|Released in 2011 by Georg Duffner, EB Garamond {{is a free}} <b>software</b> <b>version</b> of Garamond {{released}} {{under the}} Open Font License and available through Google Fonts. Duffner based the design on a specimen printed by Egelnoff-Berner in 1592, with italic and Greek characters based on Robert Granjon's work, {{as well as the}} addition of Cyrillic characters and OpenType features such as swash italic capitals and schoolbook alternates. It is intended to include multiple optical sizes, as of 2014 including fonts based on the 8 and 12 point forms on the 1592 specimen. It has been described as [...] "one of the best open source fonts" [...] by prominent typeface designer Erik Spiekermann.|$|E

Production and software revision codes were imprinted as stamps on the back label to correspond with the <b>software</b> <b>version</b> and producer. All licensed NTSC and PAL cartridges are a standard shade of gray plastic, {{with the exception of}} The Legend of Zelda and , which were manufactured in gold-plastic carts. Unlicensed carts were produced in black, robin egg blue, and gold, and are all slightly different shapes than standard NES cartridges. Nintendo also produced yellow-plastic carts for internal use at Nintendo Service Centers, although these [...] "test carts" [...] were never made available for purchase. All licensed US cartridges were made by Nintendo, Konami and Acclaim. For promotion of , Capcom sent 150 limited-edition gold NES cartridges with the original game, featuring the Remastered art as the sticker, to different gaming news agencies.

The gearbox can be set to Drive, Neutral, Reverse and Park. The infotainment control touchscreen is a [...] multi-touch panel divided into four areas. A top line displays status symbols and provides shortcuts to Charging, HomeLink, Driver Profiles, vehicle information (<b>software</b> <b>version</b> and the Vehicle identification number) and Bluetooth. The second line provides access to several apps including Media, Nav (driven by Google Maps, and thus is separate from the Nav on {{instrument panel}}), Energy, Web, Camera and Phone. The central main viewing area displays the (two) active apps, subdivided into upper and lower areas. (Most apps can be expanded {{to take up the}} entire area). At the bottom is access to various controls and settings for the vehicle such as doors, locks and lights as well as temperature controls and a secondary volume control.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} Kindle and Kindle 2 did {{not allow}} the user to organize books into folders. The user could only select what type of content to display on the home screen and whether to organize by author, title, or download date. Kindle <b>software</b> <b>version</b> 2.5 allowed for the organization of books into [...] "Collections" [...] which behave like non-structured tags/labels: a collection can not include other collections, and one book may be added to multiple collections. These collections are normally set and organized on the Kindle itself, one book at a time. The set of all collections of a first Kindle device can be imported to a second Kindle device that {{is connected to the}} cloud and is registered to the same user; as the result of this operation, the documents that are on the second device now become organized according to the first device's collections. There is no option to organize by series or series order, as the AZW format does not possess the necessary metadata fields.|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} some of {{the challenges}} of <b>software</b> <b>versioning</b> in an SOA environment and provides guidance on how {{to meet these challenges}} by following industry guidelines and recommended practices. Managing change in software systems becomes more difficult as the software increases in size, complexity, and dependencies. Part of this task is <b>software</b> <b>versioning,</b> in which version identifiers are assigned to software artifacts for the purpose of managing their evolution. However, <b>software</b> <b>versioning</b> is not a self-contained task. Versioning decisions affect a wide range of processes that fall under the broad heading of change management. With the advent of service-oriented architecture (SOA) as a software-development paradigm, <b>software</b> <b>versioning</b> has become even more en¬twined with the software life cycle, mainly due to the highly distributed nature, multiproduct outcome, and multilayer implementation of service-oriented systems. The report describes typical items that a versioning policy for a service-oriented system should contain, including which artifacts to version, how to apply version control, and the impact of versioning on each phase of the life cycle within an SOA infrastructure...|$|R

2500|$|In the UK, Bristol's Children of Technology {{developed}} a dedicated immersive video lightshow using the Virtual Light Machine (VLM) called AVLS or Audio-Visual-Live-System during 1992 and 1993. The VLM was a custom built PC by video engineer Dave Japp using super-rare transputer chips and modified motherboards, programmed by Jeff Minter (Llamasoft & Virtual Light Co.). The VLM {{developed a}}fter Jeff's earlier Llamasoft Light Synthesiser programme. With VLM, DI's from live musicians or DJ's activated Jeff's algorithmic real-time video patterns, {{and this was}} real-time mixed using pansonic video mixers with CGI animation/VHS custom texture library and live camera video feedback. Children of Technology developed their own [...] "Video Light" [...] system, using hi-power and low-power video projection to generate real-time 3D beam effects, simoultaneous with enormous surface and mapped projection. The VLM {{was used by the}} Shamen, The Orb, Primal Scream, Obsession, Peter Gabriel, Prince and many others between 1993 and 1996. A <b>software</b> <b>version</b> of the VLM was integrated into Atari's Jaguar console, in response to growing VJ interest. In the mid-90s, Audio reactive pure synthesis (as opposed to clip-based) software such as Cthugha and Bomb were influential. [...] By the late 90s there were several PC based VJing software available, including generative visuals programs such as MooNSTER, Aestesis, and Advanced Visualization Studio, as well as video clip players such as FLxER, and VJamm.|$|E
