30|$|In summary, {{the filters}} {{developed}} in [30, 33, 34] are mainly steerable analysis filters or SPTs with <b>steerability</b> but without scalability. Although the filters designed in [30, 31] have both <b>steerability</b> and scalability, {{they do not}} incorporate synthesis filters for reconstruction and thus cannot be considered as PTs. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, no PTs with shift-invariance, <b>steerability,</b> and scalability {{have been reported in the}} literature. In the interest of counteracting RST in robust image watermarking, we are motivated to extend the SPT with shift-invariance and <b>steerability</b> to include scalability. This is termed the DPT for convenience. To this end, we adopt the SPT with perfect reconstruction developed in [34]. The steerable filters of this SPT are represented in a polar-separable form, where the angular components are designed so as to achieve the <b>steerability.</b> This implies that scaling the steerable filters would be equivalent to dilating the radial component. Thus, according to the shiftability framework in [29], we can take the radial component of the SPT's steerable filters as the kernel for constructing the scalable filters. Furthermore, combining the scalable and steerable filters derived from the radial and angular components, respectively, gives rise to the scalability and <b>steerability</b> of the DPT. Its shift-invariance is inherited from the SPT by retaining undecimated high-pass and band-pass coefficients. In this way, we construct a DPT with shift-invariance, <b>steerability,</b> and scalability.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} ability of dissipative passive actuators to generate control effects on a passive haptic interface. A haptic display is a human-machine interface that constructs a sensation of touch for the human operator. Applications {{can be found in}} various industries, space, medicine and construction etc. A dissipative passive haptic display contains passive actuators that can remove energy from the system by resisting motions in the system. The advantage of a dissipative passive haptic display is better safety compared to an active display. Its disadvantage is the limited control ability from the passive actuators. This research starts with the identification of the control ability and limitations of dissipative passive haptic interfaces. The ability is identified as the <b>steerability,</b> the ability to redirect motions of a manipulator. The force generation analysis of each individual actuator is then selected as an approach to evaluate the <b>steerability.</b> <b>Steerability</b> metrics are defined to evaluate the <b>steerability.</b> Even though non-redundant manipulators dont have desired <b>steerability,</b> optimal steering configurations are found for the best operation. <b>Steerability</b> is improved by redundancy in serial or parallel structures. A theorem is developed to evaluate <b>steerability</b> for redundant manipulators. The influence of system dynamics on their steerabilities is discussed. Previously developed haptic interfaces are evaluated based on their steerabilities. <b>Steerability</b> analysis of three-dimensional haptic interfaces is also given to a limited extent {{as an extension of the}} two-dimensional cases. Brakes and clutches are the two types of dissipative passive actuators in this research. Ph. D.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{and study}} the notion of <b>steerability</b> for channels. This generalizes the notion of <b>steerability</b> of bipartite quantum states. We discuss a key conceptual difference between the case of states and the case of channels: while state steering deals {{with the notion of}} "hidden" states, <b>steerability</b> in the channel case is better understood in terms of coherence of channel extensions, rather than in terms of "hidden" channels. This distinction vanishes in the case of states. We further argue how the proposed notion of lack of coherence of channel extensions coincides with the notion of channel extensions realized via local operations and classical communication. We also discuss how the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism allows the direct application of many results about states to the case of channels. We introduce measures for the <b>steerability</b> of channel extensions. Comment: 8 page...|$|E

As the first application of this framework, we study the <b>steerability</b> of two-qubit Werner states. We show strong numerical evidence that these states are unsteerable with POVMs up to a mixing probability of 1 / 2 within an accuracy of 10 ^- 3. This supports the conjecture that POVMs and projective measurements are equivalent in steering two-qubit Werner states. We also study <b>steerability</b> for the more general set of T-states (Bell-diagonal states). The results suggest that the equivalence between POVMs and projective measurements again holds.

30|$|In this paper, we have {{presented}} a DPT-based robust image watermarking scheme resilient to rotation, scaling, and translation. We first constructed a DPT with shift-invariance, <b>steerability,</b> and scalability by extending an SPT represented {{in a closed}} and polar-separable form. The radial component of the SPT's basis filters was taken as the kernel for designing the scalable basis filters. These were further combined with the steerable basis filters corresponding to the angular components of the SPT's basis filters, resulting in joint scalability and <b>steerability.</b> The shift-invariance was inherited from the SPT by retaining undecimated high-pass and band-pass basis subbands. We also derived interpolation functions for <b>steerability</b> and scalability. These allow the interpolation of any filter (response) at an arbitrary orientation and scale via a linear combination of the DPT's basis filters (responses). By exploiting the characteristics of shift-invariance, <b>steerability,</b> and scalability, we further derived the theoretical synchronization mechanisms for translation, rotation, and scaling.|$|E

40|$|In this Letter, we mainly {{investigate}} the dynamic behavior of quantum steering {{and how to}} effectively recover the lost <b>steerability</b> of quantum states within non-Markovian environments. We consider two different cases (one-subsystem or all-subsystem interacts with the dissipative environments), and obtain that the dynamical interaction between system initialized by a Werner state and the non-Markovian environments can induce the quasi-periodic quantum entanglement (concurrence) resurgence, however, quantum steering cannot retrieve in such a condition. And we can obtain that the resurgent quantum entanglement cannot be utilized to achieve quantum steering. Subsequently, we put forward a feasible physical scheme for recovering the <b>steerability</b> of quantum states within the non-Markovian noises by prior weak measurement on each subsystem before the interaction with dissipative environments followed by post weak measurement reversal. It is shown that the <b>steerability</b> of quantum states and the fidelity can be effectively restored.

40|$|We study Gaussian quantum {{steering}} and its asymmetry {{in the background}} of a Schwarzschild black hole.

We find that thermal noise introduced by Hawking effect will destroy the <b>steerability</b> between an inertial observer Alice and an accelerated observer Bob who hovers outside the event horizon, while it generates <b>steerability</b> between Bob and a hypothetical observer anti-Bob inside the event horizon. Unlike entanglement behaviors in curved spacetime, here the steering from Alice to Bob suffers from a "sudden death" and the steering from anti-Bob to Bob experiences a "sudden birth" with increasing Hawking temperature. We also find that the Gaussian steering is always asymmetric and the maximum steering asymmetry cannot exceed 2, which means the state never evolves to an extremal asymmetry state. Furthermore, we obtain the parameter settings that maximize steering asymmetry and find that (i) s=arccosh(^ 2 r/ 1 -^ 2 r) is the critical point of steering asymmetry, and (ii) the attainment of maximal steering asymmetry indicates the transition between one-way <b>steerability</b> and both-way <b>steerability</b> for the two-mode Gaussian state under the influence of Hawking radiation.
