I mean the stuff they talked about in tabloids {{and the things that}} were so overly exaggerated, that's one aspect. I also went through a lot of personal <b>stuff,</b> <b>a</b> lot of family stuff this year. Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's brought me to another place. People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you say I can make it through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you believe you can get through whatever you're going through, you can get to the other side.|$|E

In 1962, the United States Postal Service honored the Mercury-Atlas 6 flight with a Project Mercury commemorative stamp, the first U.S. postal issue to depict a manned spacecraft. On film, the program was portrayed in The Right <b>Stuff</b> <b>a</b> 1983 adaptation of Tom Wolfe's 1979 book of the same name.

25|$|Beria and all {{the other}} {{defendants}} were sentenced to death on 23 December 1953. When the death sentence was passed, Beria pleaded on his knees for mercy before collapsing to the floor and wailing and crying, but to no avail. The other six defendants were executed by firing squad on the same day the trial ended. Beria was executed separately. He was shot through the forehead by General Pavel Batitsky who had to <b>stuff</b> <b>a</b> rag into Beria's mouth to silence him. His final moments bore great similarity to those of his own predecessor, NKVD Chief Nikolai Yezhov, who begged for his life before his execution in 1940. His body was subsequently cremated and the remains buried in a forest near Moscow.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Cesar Millan {{launched}} Cesar’s Way {{magazine in}} the United States and Canada, {{for which he was}} the Editorial Director. The magazine combined advice from Millan along with articles about the relationship between dogs and humans. Cesar Millan's Leader of the Pack was an American documentary television series on the Nat Geo Wild channel which ran from January 5, 2013 to March 26, 2013. The next year, 2014, saw the premiere of Millan's new series, Cesar 911, on the Nat Geo WILD channel; in non-American markets, it’s known as Cesar to the Rescue. In 2015, he teamed up with children's television veterans Sid and Marty Krofft to create Mutt & <b>Stuff,</b> <b>a</b> preschool television show for the Nickelodeon channel. Millan's son Calvin stars on the series. In early 2017, Cesar and his older son Andre will appear in the all-new series Dog Nation, premiering March 3.|$|E
25|$|Prisoners {{developed}} {{hand signals}} to communicate {{things they did}} not want the guards or other prisoners to hear. When a prisoner wanted to pass a note down to a girlfriend, he would attach a little bundle {{to the end of a}} long rope woven from mattress fibers and throw the bundle down into the street. The girlfriend down below would run to catch the bundle and take out the note. This would also give her an opportunity to <b>stuff</b> <b>a</b> note, cigarettes, drugs, a photograph of their child, a weapon, into the bundle, which the inmate could then hoist back up through the hole in the wall, before the guards came running to intercept the line. They called these rope and bundle setups palomas ("pigeons") and apparently, at any given time, seven or eight palomas could be flying down into the street, or back up to the prison, attached to their makeshift ropes.|$|E

500|$|Other reviews were mixed. Pitchfork Media's Tom Breihan {{wrote that}} [...] "Keith himself is {{responsible}} {{for all of the}} album's good moments. Even when he's in unhinged-rant mode, Keith's imagery often remains lucid. And so the album's best song is [...] "Ants," [...] where he comes off frantic but omnipotent...It's dense and fascinating <b>stuff,</b> <b>a</b> tantalizing glimpse of what might've happened if Keith hadn't treated the reemergence of his most popular persona like an easy payday." [...] PopMatters writer Michael Frauenhofer wrote that [...] "The Return of Dr. Octagon is still better than anything Kool Keith's done in a little while, but apart from its best tracks, it's not close to the level of his finest work of the past, and it doesn't really build much on the legend of Dr. Octagon, which still rests most firmly on the good doctor's debut." ...|$|E

It’s not anything too over the top; it’s just right where it needs to be." [...] During a chat with fans on Ustream.tv on September 27, 2010, Brown said that {{the song was}} written in 15minutes; [...] "We actually got the beat and we did it in no time. It was effortless. It was fun. It was sort of like when we wrote 'Forever', so I hope you guys like that record. It's more of a pop record, in the club record." ...|$|E

500|$|Jayma Mays commented {{of their}} relationship: [...] "Oh no! I don’t know if I can say! That’s a hard {{question}} {{because when you}} see the scenes of Emma and Will, you obviously think 'Oh of course they’re supposed to be together, of course, of course!' but the fact is, is that he’s a married man and Emma knows that’s wrong, and she doesn’t want to be a homewrecker. She doesn’t want to ruin a relationship. So I guess in a perfect world, she could find someone like Will, or maybe Ken Tanaka (laughs) can become a little bit more like Will. But maybe it’s all about respect. Maybe if she can respect Ken enough, that will develop into true love." [...] She also commented of her co-star Matthew Morrison (Will): [...] "We were friends. We knew each other before we started this job. We worked together once before. So, that’s always helpful when you know the person that you’re working with, and you already feel comfortable around them. But yeah, he’s a really good friend, so that makes that <b>stuff</b> <b>a</b> little bit easier." ...|$|E
500|$|Exploitation {{movies in}} the {{original}} sense continued to appear: 1961's Damaged Goods, a cautionary tale about a young lady whose boyfriend's promiscuity leads to venereal disease, comes complete with enormous, grotesque closeups of VD's physical effects. At the same time, the concept of fringe exploitation was merging with a related, similarly venerable tradition: [...] "nudie" [...] films featuring nudist-camp footage or striptease artists like Bettie Page had simply been the softcore pornography of previous decades. As far back as 1933, This Nude World was [...] "Guaranteed the Most Educational Film Ever Produced!" [...] In the late 1950s, as more of the old grindhouse theaters devoted themselves specifically to [...] "adult" [...] product, a few filmmakers began making nudies with greater attention to plot. Best known was Russ Meyer, who released his first successful narrative nudie, the comic Immoral Mr. Teas, in 1959. Five years later, Meyer came out with his breakthrough film, Lorna, which combined sex, violence, and a dramatic storyline. Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! (1965), made for about $45,000, would ultimately become {{the most famous of}} Meyer's sexploitation pictures. Crafted for constant titillation but containing no nudity, it was aimed at the same [...] "passion pit" [...] drive-in circuit that screened AIP teen movies with wink-wink titles like Beach Blanket Bingo (1965) and How to <b>Stuff</b> <b>a</b> Wild Bikini (1966), starring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon. Roger Corman's The Trip (1967) for American International, written by veteran AIP/Corman actor Jack Nicholson, never shows a fully bared, unpainted breast, but flirts with nudity throughout. The Meyer and Corman lines were drawing closer.|$|E

2500|$|Beach Party {{films were}} an American 1960s genre of feature films which often starred Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon. Walt Disney reluctantly consented to Funicello, a former main cast member of The Mickey Mouse Club, wearing a bikini. The series was {{originally}} {{intended as a}} low-budget imitation of both the Elvis Presley musical and the Doris Day sex comedy, aimed at the teen market, but they ended up taking {{on a life of}} their own. The [...] "classic" [...] series was produced by American International Pictures (AIP), and imitated in turn by numerous other studios. AIP produced a series of seven beach films:Beach Party (1963), Muscle Beach Party (1963), Bikini Beach (1964), Pajama Party (1964), Beach Blanket Bingo (1965), How to <b>Stuff</b> <b>a</b> Wild Bikini (1965), and The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini (1966).|$|E
2500|$|With {{tensions}} between Reed and Cale growing, Reed gave an ultimatum to Morrison and Tucker, declaring that unless Cale was fired, he would quit the band.

In September 1968, Cale played his final gig with the Velvets at the Boston Tea Party and according to Tucker, [...] "When John left, it was really sad. I felt really bad. And of course, this was gonna really influence the music, 'cause, John's a lunatic (laughs). I think we became a little more normal, which was fine, it was good music, good songs, it was never the same though. It was good <b>stuff,</b> <b>a</b> lot of good songs, but, just, the lunacy factor was... gone." [...] After his dismissal from the band, Cale was replaced by Doug Yule, a singer, bassist and organist.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first series}} of Hustle, {{broadcast}} from 24 February to 30 March 2004, attracted generally favourable reviews and audience figures. The Guardian {{described it as}} [...] "defiantly high-concept, tightly plotted, knowing <b>stuff...</b> <b>a</b> laugh; slick, glossy, and smart certainly, but a laugh all the same", and The Times remarked that it had [...] "the snap and style of a series that has been cryogenically frozen in the 1960s and brought back to life, like The Clangers... The wonderfully absurd result is a drama series that takes itself far less seriously than almost anything since The Persuaders". A later review from the same paper summarised the series as [...] "an engaging, well-acted, snappily directed drama... sleekly edited, flatteringly lit, and stylishly executed... Will you remember a single moment of it five minutes after you’ve watched an episode? Probably not. But who cares?" [...] The first three episodes attracted an average audience of 6.2 million, peaking at over 30% of the total audience.|$|E

2500|$|Fortune is {{reversed}} again in Season Six as Starfleet re-captures Deep Space Nine {{in the closing}} episodes of the opening arc, [...] "Favor the Bold" [...] and [...] "Sacrifice of Angels". The USS Defiant stands alone {{in an attempt to}} hold back thousands of Dominion ships entering through the Wormhole. An intervention from the Wormhole Prophets, considered gods by the Bajorans, leads characters to ponder questions of faith and destiny. Writer Hans Beimler wished to include mythological allusions, stating, [...] "It's tragic hero <b>stuff.</b> <b>A</b> hero [...] takes on things for others, but doesn't necessarily find any peace himself in the result." [...] Ira Steven Behr compares Sisko to the Biblical figure Moses, who fails to reach the Promised Land, and to the character of Ethan Edwards from the 1956 Western film The Searchers, who neglects to return to his family once his task is complete. It was determined that this facet to Sisko's character justified the use of divine intervention to resolve the Dominion threat: the fleet disappears and the Federation regains control of Deep Space Nine. The defeat costs Dukat his mental health, the life of his daughter, Tora Ziyal, and his status as Cardassian leader. Dukat is the first, but not the only, character in Season Six to face the pain of loss in conflict. Later, in the season six finale [...] "Tears of the Prophets", Worf loses his wife Jadzia Dax when she is killed by Dukat.|$|E
2500|$|The modern bikini {{made its}} debut in 1946, and since then it has caught the popular {{imagination}} becoming probably the most popular women's swimsuit, and not necessarily for swimming. Today, bikinis appear in competitions, films, magazines, music, literature, magazines and even video games. Despite the easy availability of more revealing glamour imagery, bikini modeling remains popular and can still create controversy. Portrayals of the bikini in popular culture led, to a large extent, to its acceptance by Western society at large. In 1960, Brian Hyland's pop song [...] "Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini" [...] inspired a bikini-buying spree. The white bikini worn by Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder in the 1962 James Bond film Dr. No has been cited {{as one of the}} most famous bikinis of all time and an iconic moment in cinematic and fashion history. By 1963, the movie Beach Party, starring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon, led a wave of films that made the bikini a pop-culture symbol. Playboy first featured a bikini on its cover in 1962. The Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue debuted two years later. This increasing popularity was reinforced by its appearance in contemporary movies like How to <b>Stuff</b> <b>a</b> Wild Bikini featuring Annette Funicello and One Million Years B.C. (1966) featuring Raquel Welch. Raquel Welch's fur bikini in One Million Years B.C. gave the world the most iconic bikini shot of all time in that period and the poster image became an important iconic moment in cinema history. Hollywood stars such as Marilyn Monroe, Jayne Mansfield, Gina Lollobrigida and Jane Russell helped the growing popularity of bikinis further. Pin up posters of Monroe and Mansfield, as well as Hayworth, Bardot and Raquel Welch distributed around the world contributed significantly to the popularity of the bikini.|$|E

[...] In the late 1950s, as more of the old grindhouse theaters specifically devoted themselves to [...] "adult" [...] product, a few filmmakers began making nudies with some greater semblance of plots. Best known was Russ Meyer, who released his first successful narrative nudie, The Immoral Mr. Teas, in 1959. Five years later, on a sub-$100,000 budget, Meyer came out with Lorna, [...] "a harder-edged film that combined sex with gritty realism and violence." [...] Meyer would build an underground reputation as a talented director with movies such as Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! (1965) and Vixen! (1968), the sort of films, virtually ignored by the mainstream press, that had become known as sexploitation pictures. Another leading director in the genre was Joseph Sarno, who had his first commercial success in 1963 with Sin in the Suburbs. Many of his subsequent films, including the artistically crafted Red Roses of Passion (1966) and Odd Triangle (1968), examined the hesitant transformation of sexual mores among the American middle class. Films such as Meyer's and Sarno's—though not sexually explicit during this period—were largely relegated to the fringe circuit of [...] "adult" [...] theaters, while AIP teen movies with wink-wink titles like Beach Blanket Bingo (1965) and How to <b>Stuff</b> <b>a</b> Wild Bikini (1966), starring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon, played drive-ins and other relatively reputable venues.
