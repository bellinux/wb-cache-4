5|$|Guitar Method (subtitled 1996–1999) is {{the only}} album by indie {{supergroup}} Kid Kilowatt, initially released by <b>Second</b> <b>Nature</b> Recordings on vinyl in 2003, and later on CD by Hydra Head Records in 2004. It consists of material recorded {{over a period of}} three years, including after the band's breakup. Still, it did not see release as a whole for over four years after the last track was recorded.|$|E

25|$|All of the {{viewpoint}} characters were born under the Nazis, {{and maintaining the}} masquerade is <b>second</b> <b>nature.</b> The greatest danger is {{when a child is}} told of his or her true identity, usually at age of ten: considered old enough to keep the secret. Children often are shocked, since, like all German children, they grew up exposed to constant anti-Semitism from teachers and children's books. The adults soften the shock by teaching the children to feel privileged to belong to such a secret society.|$|E

She is the first female artist to win two consecutive Classical BRIT Awards: her second album, <b>Second</b> <b>Nature,</b> reached number 16 in the UK Albums Chart, and was Album of the Year in the 2005 BRIT Awards.|$|E
25|$|Most {{recreational}} {{scuba diving}} is done using a half mask which covers the diver's eyes and nose, and a mouthpiece {{to supply the}} breathing gas from the demand valve or rebreather. Inhaling from a regulator's mouthpiece becomes <b>second</b> <b>nature</b> very quickly. The other common arrangement is a full face mask which covers the eyes, nose and mouth, and often allows the diver to breathe through the nose. Professional scuba divers {{are more likely to}} use full face masks, which protect the diver's airway if the diver loses consciousness.|$|E
25|$|Shyness {{may involve}} the {{discomfort}} of difficulty in {{knowing what to}} say in social situations, or may include crippling physical manifestations of uneasiness. Shyness usually involves {{a combination of both}} symptoms, and may be quite devastating for the sufferer, in many cases leading them to feel that they are boring, or exhibit bizarre behavior in an attempt to create interest, alienating them further. Behavioral traits in social situations such as smiling, easily producing suitable conversational topics, assuming a relaxed posture and making good eye contact, may not be <b>second</b> <b>nature</b> for a shy person. Such people might only affect such traits by great difficulty, or they may even be impossible to display.|$|E

25|$|The {{underwater}} {{environment is}} unfamiliar and hazardous, {{and to ensure}} diver safety, simple, yet necessary procedures must be followed. A certain minimum level of attention to detail and acceptance of responsibility for one's own safety and survival are required. Most of the procedures are simple and straightforward, and become <b>second</b> <b>nature</b> to the experienced diver, but must be learned, and take some practice to become automatic and faultless, just like the ability to walk or talk. Most of the safety procedures are intended {{to reduce the risk}} of drowning, and many of the rest are {{to reduce the risk of}} barotrauma and decompression sickness. In some applications getting lost is a serious hazard, and specific procedures to minimise the risk are followed.|$|E
25|$|Neutral {{buoyancy}} in a diver is {{an unstable}} state. It is changed by small differences in ambient pressure {{caused by a}} change in depth, and the change has a positive feedback effect. A small descent will increase the pressure, which will compress the gas filled spaces and reduce the total volume of diver and equipment. This will further reduce the buoyancy, and unless counteracted, will result in sinking more rapidly. The equivalent effect applies to a small ascent, which will trigger an increased buoyancy and will result in accelerated ascent unless counteracted. The diver must continuously adjust buoyancy or depth {{in order to remain}} neutral. Fine control of buoyancy can be achieved by controlling the average lung volume in open circuit scuba, but this feature is not available to the closed circuit rebreather diver, as exhaled gas remains in the breathing loop. This is a skill which improves with practice until it becomes <b>second</b> <b>nature.</b>|$|E
500|$|Predating Guitar Method {{by three}} years, <b>Second</b> <b>Nature</b> Recordings {{released}} a 7-inch Kid Kilowatt single entitled Hit Single in 2001.

500|$|It {{should be}} emphasized, however, that for Whitehead God is not {{necessarily}} tied to religion. [...] Rather than springing primarily from religious faith, Whitehead saw God as necessary for his metaphysical system. [...] His system required that an order exist among possibilities, an order that allowed for novelty {{in the world and}} provided an aim to all entities. [...] Whitehead posited that these ordered potentials exist in what he called the primordial nature of God. [...] However, Whitehead was also interested in religious experience. [...] This led him to reflect more intensively on what he saw as the <b>second</b> <b>nature</b> of God, the consequent nature. [...] Whitehead's conception of God as a [...] "dipolar" [...] entity has called for fresh theological thinking.|$|E
500|$|Ki {{was mixed}} by Townsend, and {{features}} very little compression, {{in contrast with}} his usual wall-of-sound production style. Townsend explained that he originally [...] "tried doing the wall-of-sound with it and {{it just kind of}} ruined it...it turned it into a not-so-good Strapping record." [...] The album deliberately eschews the loudness wars, the recent music industry practice of competitively mastering audio to seem as loud as possible. [...] "I officially pull my hat out of the loudness wars", Townsend told his mastering engineer. The album's songs were primarily written in open C tuning, except for [...] "A Monday", [...] "Trainfire", and [...] "Disruptr" [...] in open B, [...] "Heaven's End" [...] and [...] "Winter" [...] in open B, and [...] "Quiet Riot" [...] in standard tuning. Townsend has cited <b>Second</b> <b>Nature</b> by The Young Gods, Paul Horn, Chants of India by Ravi Shankar, and Ween as influences on the album.|$|E

500|$|Nevertheless, Twain {{remained}} frightened that Foster would {{dislike the}} song or her voice. To qualm her fears, Twain approached the session {{as if she}} were introducing [...] "Today Is Your Day" [...] as a songwriter, rather than a singer. Twain and Foster recorded the demo of [...] "Today Is Your Day" [...] at Foster's home studio in Los Angeles, California. They created the musical arrangement as the session progressed. Background vocals were provided by Twain and her sister, Carrie Ann Twain, using a handheld microphone. Foster then suggested for Twain to record lead vocals in his home's vocal booth. After agreeing, Twain nervously approached the recording session. Once immersed in the process, she began to enjoy it. The singer considered her session with Foster a [...] "landmark moment in [...] journey" [...] through Why Not? with Shania Twain and described it as <b>second</b> <b>nature,</b> as if she never put her musical career to a halt. Twain later recorded the studio version of [...] "Today Is Your Day" [...] and co-produced it along Foster and Nathan Chapman. The song made Twain feel comfortable recording music again, thus she began to work on her forthcoming fifth studio album.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Mantle played Maynard in Ben Bolt's TV movie, <b>Second</b> <b>Nature,</b> which starred Alec Baldwin in {{the leading}} role, and {{appeared}} in the first episode of the series Fortysomething. He portrayed Percy, described as a [...] "big, bashful Northern mill-worker who lives with his mum", in Patrick Sanford's stage production of Rattle of a Simple Man at the Clwyd Theatr Cymru in Mold, Flintshire. Gail Cooper of the Western Mail praised his performance and said: Mantle, better known as dishy and confident consultant Mike Barrett in Casualty, is cast completely against type as Percy, the 42-year-old virgin who admits to being only 35. His body language is superb: awkward, self-effacing, obsessively tidy – Coronation Street fans should think Roy Cropper {{if they want to}} imagine the sort of man Percy is. In 2003, Mantle began filming The Bingo Club, one of five specially commissioned one-hour plays which were screened in January 2004 on BBC1. Co-starring Paula Wilcox and John McArdle, The Bingo Tales relates the story of three women facing romantic hardship and growing old. During production, Mantle fell on his face while shooting a fencing scene and was rushed to Selly Oak Hospital with a ruptured ligament in his leg.|$|E
