2500|$|Like other skates, {{the common}} skate is a bottom feeder. Its diet {{consists}} of crustaceans, clams, oysters, snails, bristle worms, cephalopods, and small to medium-sized fish (such as <b>sand</b> <b>eel,</b> flatfish, monkfish, catsharks, spurdog, other skates). The {{size of the}} individual can affect its diet. Larger ones eat larger things like fish. The bigger the skate is the more food that {{will be needed to}} sustain its large body size. The activity level determines how much it eats; the more active it is the more it eats. [...] The common skate does not only feed on creatures {{at the bottom of the}} ocean, as some do ascend to feed on mackerel, herring, and other pelagic fish, which are caught by rapidly moving up from the seabed to grab the prey.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of {{overfishing}} of the Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> the <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> fishery in the North Sea {{off the coast of}} Scotland was closed down in 2000.An observed decline in Atlantic puffins was linked to reduced numbers of <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> prey and the fishery was closed in the hope to recover the puffin population. After the closure the numbers of Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> increased and benefited many top predators including the black-legged kittiwake. The fishery continues to be closed except for a small area carefully managed to make assessments of the <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> stock.These previous problems with Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> fisheries and the concerns for seabirds, commercially valuable fish and marine mammals have led to calls for better management and monitoring of <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> abundance.|$|E
50|$|The Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> {{is found}} across the Northeast Atlantic Ocean and is {{particularly}} {{abundant in the}} North Sea. They live in both the shallow open ocean and coastal waters. Four other species of <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> are also distributed {{in this part of}} the Atlantic. The fisheries here are dominated by Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> suggesting the Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> is the most abundant in the area.|$|E
50|$|Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eels</b> feed {{mainly on}} zooplankton. By {{consuming}} zooplankton {{they act as}} a link through to the higher trophic level predators that eat <b>sand</b> <b>eels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The three genera {{listed above}} all {{fall within the}} family Ammodytidae, the sand lances. Members of these genera found in other oceans are not usually called <b>sand</b> <b>eels,</b> and species {{from other parts of}} the world are known as <b>sand</b> <b>eels</b> are usually less closely related. None of the <b>sand</b> <b>eels</b> is related to the true eels.|$|R
50|$|Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eels</b> {{breed in}} December and January when they briefly leave their winter burrows in the sediment.They {{lay their eggs}} in the sand which {{incubate}} there until they hatch in February and March. The hatched <b>sand</b> <b>eels</b> live in the open water above the sediment until metamorphosis. After this, they return to burrow in the sediment.Most Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eels</b> live for only 3 or 4 years as they have {{a high level of}} natural death.|$|R

50|$|Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> (Ammodytes marinus), {{also known}} as the lesser <b>sand</b> <b>eel,</b> is a small semi-pelagic ray-finned fish found in the North Atlantic Ocean. The Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> is member of the Ammodytidae family which {{includes}} all 31 species of sand eels, often referred to as sand lances. Contrary to their name sand eels, including Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel,</b> are not true eels and instead belong to the order of “perch-like” fishes, the Perciformes.|$|E
50|$|Fisheries of <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> {{can also}} be harmful to seabird colonies. Fishing the Raitt's <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> means there are less {{available}} to be eaten by the seabirds. Populations of Atlantic puffin and black-legged kittiwake have declined in response to decreased prey levels of <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> in the sea.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sand</b> <b>eels</b> form an {{important}} part of the diet of many sea birds. Excessive fishing of <b>sand</b> <b>eels</b> on an industrial scale in the North Sea has been linked to a decline in the breeding success of kittiwakes, terns, fulmars, and shags.|$|R

50|$|The Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> {{is known}} from fishing records to have regular {{population}} fluctuations. Overfishing, {{climate change and}} food web effects have all {{been shown to have}} contribute to these fluctuations. As the Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> is found in the North Atlantic Ocean its climate is altered by the North Atlantic Oscillation. This weather fluctuation can alter the recruitment of <b>sand</b> <b>eel.</b> Warmer temperatures decrease the number of <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> juveniles that survive to adulthood and so yearly changes to temperature can cause fluctuating population size. Changes to the abundance of species connected to the Raitt's <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> in the food web has also caused variable population size. Calanus copepods are an important prey item for sand eels. The population of Raitt's <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> has been related to changes in the availability of this prey. Young Raitt’s sand eels have lower survival when copepods are less abundant.|$|E
50|$|Sand eels {{have been}} fished since the 1950s. However, {{this was not}} done for {{industrial}} purposes until the 1970s when the fishing fleet for <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> increased rapidly. The Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> is the most abundant species of <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> in these fisheries and makes up over 90% of the catch. In 1977 the <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> fishery became the largest fishery in the North Sea, with landings regularly exceeding 1 million tonnes. This high level of fishing caused a decline in stocks over time as the fishery became unsustainable. This led to both financial losses for the fishing industry and negative environmental consequences.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} {{boundary of}} the Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> is predicted to move further North in the future due to climate change. The Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> survives better in cooler waters and may move North to avoid warming sea temperatures.|$|E
50|$|It eats zooplankton, larvae of fish, crustaceans, {{and other}} smaller invertebrates.

5000|$|The great <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> can be {{distinguished}} from the lesser <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> because the origin of its long dorsal fin is located behind {{the level of the}} pectoral fin. Corbin's <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> (Hyperoplus immaculatus) is very similar to the greater <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> in the way that it lacks a protrusible upper jaw and its similar size. However, it can {{be distinguished}} by the lack of the black spot on the snout, but it does have a black chin. Its dorsal fin has 59 to 62 rays. The overall color is darker than the other sand eels, it is found offshore, and tends to be found more on the western side of the United Kingdom ...|$|E

50|$|Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> {{have very}} {{specific}} habitat requirements. They are specialised {{to live in}} waters high in oxygen but {{with low levels of}} silt and clay.These requirements mean the Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> is found in distinct patches across the North Atlantic and instead of one continuous population.|$|E
50|$|The common dab's diet {{consists}} of zoobenthos organisms such as marine worms, molluscs, <b>sand</b> <b>eels,</b> amphipods, crustaceans, echinoderms and {{small pieces of}} fish.|$|R
50|$|As adults, {{the fish}} feed on much larger food: Arctic squid, <b>sand</b> <b>eels,</b> amphipods, Arctic shrimp, and {{sometimes}} herring, and the fishes' size increases dramatically.|$|R

50|$|The Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> is a {{keystone}} {{species in the}} North Sea food web. They are the prey of {{a significant number of}} species including seabirds, marine mammals and larger fish. Seabirds in particular rely heavily on the Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> to feed their chicks. When the sand eels leave their burrows to feed seabirds dive into the water to catch them and then return to their nests. Atlantic puffin, black-legged kittiwake, common guillemot and razorbills are all known predators of this species. Common guillemots feed exclusively on Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> during the breeding season.|$|E
50|$|The {{impacts of}} intense Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> fishing has been debated. Census data {{has shown that}} seabird populations as a whole are not {{negatively}} impacted by <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> fisheries. Some {{has suggested that the}} observed declines in seabirds such as puffins were isolated incidences that do not represent the whole population.|$|E
50|$|The diet of the Atlantic halibut {{consists}} {{mainly of}} other fish, e.g. cod, haddock, herring, pogge, <b>sand</b> <b>eels</b> and capelin, {{but it will}} also eat cephalopods, large crustaceans and other benthos organisms.|$|R
5|$|In the Shetland Islands, <b>sand</b> <b>eels</b> (Ammodytes marinus) {{normally}} form {{at least}} 90% {{of the food}} fed to chicks. It was found that, in years where the availability of <b>sand</b> <b>eels</b> was low, breeding success rates fell, with many chicks starving to death. In Norway it is the herring (Clupea harengus) that is the mainstay of the diet. When herring numbers dwindled, so did puffin numbers. In Labrador the puffins seemed more flexible and when the staple forage fish capelin (Mallotus villosus) declined in availability, {{they were able to}} adapt and feed the chicks on other prey species.|$|R
25|$|Adult cod {{are active}} hunters, feeding on <b>sand</b> <b>eels,</b> whiting, haddock, small cod, squid, crabs, lobsters, mussels, worms, mackerel, and molluscs, supplementing their diets. Young cod eat the same but avoid larger prey.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to their}} lifestyle, {{it has been}} very {{difficult}} to estimate the population size of the Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel.</b> Most monitoring techniques are inappropriate and cannot detect the burrowed sand eels.Biological indicatiors, or bioindicators are now being used to assess the size of the Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> population. The main indicator used for sand eels are black-legged kittiwake seabirds. These coastal breeding birds are heavily reliant on sand eels and therefore their population size changes in response to the amount of Raitt's <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> present. This can give a lot of information about the abundance of sand eels in the area.|$|E
