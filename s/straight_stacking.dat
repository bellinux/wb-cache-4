40|$|A {{status is}} made of the {{understanding}} of the martensitic transformation based on studies of the bcc-hcp model systems. The results of first principle calculations and recent neutron scattering experiments will be compared. Dynamical precursor phenomena are found in the purest available systems. An incomplete softening of elastic constants is observed supporting the mechanism for the martensitic first order transition in terms of a free energy expansion in uniform and in internal strains. The construction of simple analogue spin models is critically discussed and results of Monte Carlo simulations presented. Finally, is the result of studies of the domain growth kinetics after quenches to low temperature discussed. New, slow growth laws appear in the context, where there exist both <b>straight</b> <b>stacking</b> faults and curved soliton domain walls.

40|$|Conventional <b>straight</b> <b>stacking</b> {{has proved}} to be an {{effective}} tool to extract the signal from a multichannel seismic record. However, it maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio only when a rather simple and generally rare model of the record is true. For this reason, some authors try to optimize stacking using more complicated record models. They assume that either the signal amplitudes are allowed to vary from trace to trace in any manner with the noise variances being constant or vice versa. However, in practice, it is commonly the case that these model assumptions are seriously violated. Then, methods based on them become ineffective or even deleterious. We show that these methods produce signal estimates distorted to a considerable extent right up to being absolutely uncorrelated with the sought-for actual signal. This fact motivates our search for new methods for better estimating seismic signals. We therefore introduce a more realistic model that supposes a signal with an identical shape on each trace to be embedded in spatially uncorrelated irregular noise. The signal amplitudes and the noise autocorrelations are allowed to vary across the traces in an arbitrary manner. Given this model, a solution to the maximum likelihood estimation of the signal shape is derived...|$|E

Single-cylinder engine data were obtained using three <b>straight</b> <b>stacks</b> 25, 44, and 108 inches in length; an S-shaped stack, a 90 degree bend, a 180 degree bend, and a short <b>straight</b> <b>stack</b> having a closed branch faired into it. Each stack was fitted with nozzles varying in exit area from 0. 91 square inch to the unrestricted area of the stack of 4. 20 square inches. The engine was generally operated over a range of engine speeds from 1300 to 2100 r. p. m, inlet-manifold pressures from 22 to 30 inches of mercury absolute, and a fuel-air ratio of 0. 08. The loss in engine power, the jet thrust, and the gain in net thrust are correlated in terms of several simple parameters. An example is given for determining the optimum nozzle area and the overall net thrust...|$|R

30|$|Participants {{completed}} this task <b>straight</b> after the <b>stack</b> viewing task. Participants {{were instructed to}} inspect the images freely and decide whether they believed a tumour was present or absent. Each trial started with a fixation cross in {{the centre of the}} screen upon which participants had to fixate for the test stimuli to appear. Test stimuli were presented for 5 s after which participants had to provide a diagnosis (i.e. tumorous or clear) and confidence rating (in this case: Guess, Maybe, Probably, Definitely). All participants were instructed to freely inspect the images and then provide a diagnostic decision by moving a mouse over a centrally located array which had the response options within. Participants were not required to localise the tumour because we did not want the response procedure to interfere with scanning patterns. The testing session took approximately 40 min.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} {{a model of a}} direct {{methanol}} fuel cell stack. The model is based on our recent model of a single cell with parallel <b>straight</b> channels. The <b>stack</b> model accounts for voltage loss due to in-plane currents in the bipolar plates and local 'spots' of contact resistance. A 100 cell stack with a various number of spots is simulated. The effect of spots is twofold: they (i) increase local current and polarization voltages in the unaffected part of the cells, and (ii) induce in-plane parasitic current in bipolar plates. The growth of local current in the unaffected part of the cells reduces limiting current density of the stack. The stronger stack contamination with the spots, the lower the limiting current density. In the studied range of parameters, voltage loss in the bipolar plates is negligible...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{crystallization}} {{behavior and}} crystalline {{structure of a}} series of chlorine-containing polyethylenes (PEs) with either a random or a precise placement of the Cl atom on each and every 21 st, 19 th, 15 th, and 9 th backbone carbon have been studied by DSC, NMR, Raman spectroscopy, WAXD, SAXS and AFM in samples cooled from the melt at 1 °C/min. All precision Cl-substituted PEs crystallize as homopolymers based on their DD/MAS solid-state 13 C NMR spectra that reveal a uniform distribution of the content of halogen between crystalline and noncrystalline regions. In addition, unique WAXD crystallographic patterns that differ from those of the linear PE and random polymers, relatively large crystal thicknesses, and sharp crystallization and melting peaks also support this homopolymer pattern in precision systems. In contrast, a high concentration of Cl in the noncrystalline regions {{in the case of the}} random systems suggest that the crystallization process for randomly substituted samples is being led by the selection of the most crystalline sequences, resulting in broad thermal transitions and lower crystallinities. Increasing chlorine content in both precision and random systems decreases crystallinity, melting temperature, heat of fusion, and crystallite thicknesses suggesting that Cl atoms are defects that hinder the crystallization of these polyolefins. Both systems are found to exhibit a lamellar crystalline morphology. Precision substituted polyethylenes form long, <b>straight,</b> and <b>stacked</b> lamellae with axialitic (PE 21 Cl, PE 19 Cl, and PE 15 Cl) or spherulitic (PE 9 Cl) organization as typical of homopolymers of similar molar mass.

50|$|The penhold grip is so-named {{because one}} grips the racket {{similarly}} {{to the way}} one holds a writing instrument. The style of play among penhold players can vary greatly from player to player. The most popular style, usually {{referred to as the}} Chinese penhold style, involves curling the middle, ring, and fourth finger {{on the back of the}} blade with the three fingers always touching one another. Chinese penholders favour a round racket head, for a more over-the-table style of play. In contrast, another style, sometimes referred to as the Japanese/Korean penhold grip, involves splaying those three fingers out across the back of the racket, usually with all three fingers touching the back of the racket, rather than stacked upon one another. Sometimes a combination of the two styles occurs, wherein the middle, ring and fourth fingers are <b>straight,</b> but still <b>stacked,</b> or where all fingers may be touching the back of the racket, but are also in contact with one another. Japanese/Korean penholders will often use a square-headed racket for an away-from-the-table style of play. Traditionally these square-headed rackets feature a block of cork on top of the handle, as well as a thin layer of cork on the back of the racket, for increased grip and comfort. Penhold styles are popular among players originating from East Asian regions such as China, Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea.|$|R
