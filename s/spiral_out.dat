5|$|Scaramanga then {{proposes a}} pistol duel with Bond on the beach; {{the two men}} stand back to back and are officiated by Nick Nack to take twenty paces, but when Bond turns and fires, Scaramanga has vanished. Nick Nack leads Bond into Scaramanga's Funhouse where Bond stands {{in the place of}} a {{mannequin}} of himself; when Scaramanga walks by, Bond outwits and kills him.

Bond and Goodnight celebrate their mission by romancing each other.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation found}} a {{simulated engine failure}} procedure was being conducted, which involved {{a member of the}} crew pulling back the throttle lever for engine No. 4 prior to taking off. Investigators found that if the throttle lever was pulled back too far, it would cause the propeller to reversea feature designed to slow the aircraft upon landing. Once the landing gear was raised, the crew would have to raise a metal flag in the cockpit to bring the propeller blades back into the correct position, since a safety device prevented electric power from operating the rotating mechanism at the roots of the blades unless the aircraft was on the ground or the flag was manually raised. The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) concluded one of the flight crew applied full power to No. 4 engine, thinking this would bring the aircraft out of the increasing bank. Because the blades were reversed and the flag was not raised, that increased the reverse thrust from No. 4 engine, causing the DC-6 to <b>spiral</b> <b>out</b> of control. Since the plane was so close to the ground, the suddenness of the bank and dive meant the flight crew had no chance to recover the aircraft before impact.|$|E

25|$|Chainfire {{continues}} {{the story of}} Richard {{in his attempt to}} teach the people that their lives are theirs alone, and that they can be free of the Imperial Order. Richard is gravely injured from an enemy's arrow. He is brought to Nicci, a sorceress and former Sister of the Dark, who heals him using Subtractive Magic; this causes unforeseen events to <b>spiral</b> <b>out</b> of control. When Richard awakens, he discovers that his wife, Kahlan Amnell, the Mother Confessor, is missing. Furthermore, no one around him seems to remember her. Nicci and Cara both attribute Richard's memory of Kahlan to dreams and delusions brought on by his injury and possibly an unintended effect of the Subtractive Magic used in healing Richard. Despite Richard's attempts to explain {{the events of the last}} several years could not have happened without Kahlan, the paradoxes are explained away as Richard remembering things inaccurately.|$|E
25|$|Pope County in West Central Arkansas {{had been}} the scene of several {{politically}} motivated assassinations following the civil war. In 1872 it appeared that another round of assassinations of county officials was imminent and local officials convinced the Governor Ozra A. Hadley, who had been installed by Governor Powell, who was now a senator, to allow the raising of a militia company {{to deal with the}} troubles. This militia company arrested the suspected assassins but was then accused itself of murdering its prisoners. As the situation continued to <b>spiral</b> <b>out</b> of control and more killings followed Adjutant General Daniel Phillips Upham was sent to investigate. Following a round of shoot outs and killings in Dover and threats to burn the town, martial law was declared and a regiment of the mostly black state militia was sent in to maintain the peace. A Captain George R. Herriot, in command of the black troops in Pope county, was subsequently murdered in the county court house, but his killer was never brought to trial.|$|E
25|$|Season 3 creates many dynamic {{changes with}} regards to {{relationships}} and power within the characters' society. Firstly, Marissa is expelled from the Harbor School. The Cooper family, left with little money, is forced {{to move into a}} trailer park. Julie Cooper-Nichol, once one of the richest women in all of Newport, struggles to {{put food on the table}} for her daughters. Marissa's life begins to <b>spiral</b> <b>out</b> of control, as she struggles with alcohol and drug abuse, as well as dealing with the loss of her close friend Johnny. Similarly, Kirsten confronts her alcohol addiction and eventually leaves rehab, only to encounter more problems when she begins business with a con artist. The other characters look towards college, with Seth and Summer competing for a spot at Brown University. Sandy's moral compass becomes imperiled when a past love interest makes her way back into his life, and he takes over Caleb's old position as head of The Newport Group, pursuing a project to establish more low-income housing in Newport. Ryan also attempts to resolve his individual relationships with his mother, and with his childhood friend Theresa Diaz. He also pursues the idea of a post-secondary education, with encouragement from both Sandy and Kirsten to visit Berkeley. Ryan's life is quickly put on hold when, in the season 3 finale, Ryan decides to drive Marissa to the airport, and they are run off the road by Kevin Volchok, Marissa's most recent love affair gone wrong. In the last few minutes of the episode, Ryan pulls Marissa out from the burning car, only to watch her die in his arms.|$|E

500|$|Piracy against American {{merchant}} shipping {{had not been}} a problem before 1776, when ships from the Thirteen Colonies were protected by British warships and treaties (nor was it a problem during the revolution, as the French Navy assumed the responsibility as part of the alliance treaty). Only after the U.S. achieved its independence did Barbary pirates begin capturing American ships, and demanding ransom or tribute. Additionally, once the French Revolution started, the British Navy began intercepting American merchant ships suspected of trading with France, and France began intercepting American merchant ships suspected of trading with Great Britain. Defenseless, the American government could do little to resist. Even given these events there was great resistance in Congress to formation of a naval force. Opponents asserted that payment of tribute to the Barbary states was a better solution than building a navy, which they argued would only lead to calls for a navy department, and the staff to operate it. This would then lead to more appropriations of funds, which would eventually <b>spiral</b> <b>out</b> of control, giving birth to a [...] "self-feeding entity." [...] Then, in 1793, a truce negotiated between Portugal and Algiers ended Portugal's blockade of the Strait of Gibraltar, freeing the Barbary pirates to roam the Atlantic. Within months, they had captured 11 American vessels and more than a hundred seamen.|$|E
500|$|The {{performance}} was universally panned by critics. Jeff Leeds of The New York Times said that [...] "no one {{was prepared for}} Sunday night’s fiasco, in which a listless Ms. Spears teetered through her dance steps and mouthed only occasional words in a wan attempt to lip-synch her new single". Vinay Menon of the Toronto Star commented Spears [...] "looked hopelessly dazed. She was wearing the expression of somebody who had been deposited at the Palms Casino Resort by a tornado, one that promptly twisted away, taking her clothing and sense of purpose. [...] lumbering, in slow motion, as if somebody had poured cement into her streetwalker boots". David Willis of BBC stated her performance would [...] "go down {{in the history books}} as being one of the worst to grace the MTV Awards". The day after the performance, American blogger Chris Crocker posted a video in YouTube titled [...] "Leave Britney alone!", in which he cried and defended Spears's performance, explaining {{that he did not want}} her to <b>spiral</b> <b>out</b> of control like Anna Nicole Smith, who had died in February 2007. Within the first 24 hours of its posting, the video accumulated over 2 million views. [...] "Leave Britney alone!" [...] turned Crocker into an internet celebrity, and was featured on television shows such as The View and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. It was also parodied by dozens of other YouTube users, most famously by actor Seth Green. An editor for YouTube said [...] "the melodramatic two-minute clip made Crocker an instant YouTube star" [...] and named it one of the top videos of 2007. Wired named it the top video of 2007.|$|E

2500|$|As {{described}} above, Washington's climate varies {{greatly from}} west to east. An oceanic climate (also called [...] "west coast marine climate") predominates in western Washington, {{and a much}} drier semi-arid climate prevails east of the Cascade Range. Major factors determining Washington's climate include the large semi-permanent high pressure and low pressure systems of the north Pacific Ocean, the continental air masses of North America, and the Olympic and Cascade mountains. In the spring and summer, a high pressure anticyclone system dominates the north Pacific Ocean, causing air to <b>spiral</b> <b>out</b> in a clockwise fashion. For Washington this means prevailing winds from the northwest bring relatively cool air and a predictably dry season.|$|E
