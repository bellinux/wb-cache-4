40|$|<b>Suicidal</b> <b>behaviors</b> (deliberate self-injury {{with the}} intent to hurt or kill oneself) have been little {{examined}} outside the West. The aims of this study were to (a) determine the correlates of <b>suicidal</b> <b>behaviors,</b> and (b) examine whether depression and suicide ideation moderated the effects of exposure to completed and attempted suicide on <b>suicidal</b> <b>behaviors</b> among a community sample of Hong Kong youth ages 12 - 17. Adolescents responded to questions regarding self-injurious behaviors, and also indicated presence of intention to hurt or kill themselves in the past 12 months. Based on their responses, two groups of interest were formed: 96 youths reported both self-injurious behaviors and the intent to hurt or kill themselves, and formed the "suicidal behaviors" group; and, 1213 adolescents reported neither self-injurious behaviors nor intent to hurt self or die, and formed the control group. The participants also responded to questions about depressive symptoms, anxiety, suicidal ideation and attempt, alcohol/drug use, stressful life events, and family relationships. They indicated whether anyone they knew had attempted or completed suicide in the previous 12 months. Logistic regression indicated that depressive symptoms, stressful life events, suicidal ideation and exposure to suicide attempt (but not completed suicide) contributed unique variance to the presence of <b>suicidal</b> <b>behaviors,</b> after controlling for demographic variables. Depression (and at trend levels, suicidal ideation) moderated the effect of exposure to suicide attempt by others on <b>suicidal</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Our results indicate that completed suicide in the social network increases risk for <b>suicidal</b> <b>behaviors,</b> but not when other risk factors are controlled. By contrast, a suicide attempt independently increases risk for <b>suicidal</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Furthermore, those youths who experience depressive symptoms or suicidal ideation are at particularly high risk for engaging in <b>suicidal</b> <b>behaviors</b> when an exposure to suicide attempt occurs. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{describe}} and assess-as well as identify and rectify gaps in-intervention and prevention initiatives that specifically address poor mental health outcomes and <b>suicidal</b> <b>behaviors</b> in lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) populations in Australia. It begins with an overview of the evidence base for heightened vulnerability to <b>suicidal</b> <b>behaviors</b> among LGBTI people in Australia. It then provides a discussion on the public health implications for LGBTI-targeted mental health initiatives and the prevention of and timely intervention in LGBTI <b>suicidal</b> <b>behaviors.</b> We conclude that the literature supports an increased risk for poorer mental health outcomes and <b>suicidal</b> <b>behaviors</b> in LGBTI populations in the Australian context. Psychological distress and <b>suicidal</b> <b>behaviors</b> in LGBTI people in Australia have social determinants that can and have been addressed through the provision of interventions with a strong evidence base in reducing these outcomes, implemented at a nationwide level, including training of health professionals and gatekeepers to mental health services and the general public.

This study aimed to estimate independent associations of childhood bullying victimization with <b>suicidal</b> <b>behaviors</b> among U. S. Army soldiers. Methods: Soldiers reporting for basic training completed a cross-sectional survey assessing mental disorders, <b>suicidal</b> <b>behaviors,</b> and childhood adversities including two types of bullying victimization: (1) Physical Assault/Theft and (2) Bullying Comments/Behaviors. Associations of childhood bullying experiences with <b>suicidal</b> <b>behaviors</b> were estimated using discrete-time survival analysis of person–year data from 30, 436 soldiers. Models adjusted for sociodemographic factors, childhood maltreatment by adults, and mental disorders.

It is characterized by qualitative impairment in social interaction, by stereotyped and restricted patterns of behavior, activities and interests, and by no clinically significant delay in cognitive development or general delay in language. Intense preoccupation with a narrow subject, one-sided verbosity, restricted prosody, and physical clumsiness are typical of the condition, but are not required for diagnosis. <b>Suicidal</b> <b>behavior</b> appears to occur at rates similar to those without ASD.|$|E
5|$|Paradoxical reactions, such as {{increased}} seizures in epileptics, aggression, violence, impulsivity, irritability and <b>suicidal</b> <b>behavior</b> sometimes occur. These reactions have been explained as consequences of disinhibition {{and the subsequent}} loss of control over socially unacceptable behavior. Paradoxical reactions are rare in the general population, with an incidence rate below 1% and similar to placebo. However, they occur with greater frequency in recreational abusers, individuals with borderline personality disorder, children, and patients on high-dosage regimes. In these groups, impulse control problems {{are perhaps the most}} important risk factor for disinhibition; learning disabilities and neurological disorders are also significant risks. Most reports of disinhibition involve high doses of high-potency benzodiazepines. Paradoxical effects may also appear after chronic use of benzodiazepines.|$|E

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} are to examine (1) whether reasons for living predict self-damaging and <b>suicidal</b> <b>behaviors,</b> (2) the {{associations}} of reasons for living with coping strategies and depressive personality disorder (PD), and (3) the unique predictive validity of reasons for living in a multivariate predictor model. Reasons for living (RFL), coping strategies, and depressive personality disorder were measured at baseline in 38 patients who met DSM-IV criteria for borderline personality disorder (BPD). Frequency of self-damaging and <b>suicidal</b> <b>behaviors</b> in the 6 -month period following baseline was measured prospectively at 3 - and 6 -month follow-ups. The RFL has only one subscale that predicts parasuicidal behaviors (i. e. Survival and Coping Beliefs [SCB]). Participants who scored low on this subscale were 6. 8 times more likely to exhibit self-damaging and <b>suicidal</b> <b>behaviors</b> in the follow-up period than their high-scoring counter-parts. However, SCB was substantially correlated with the coping strategies "reassuring thoughts," "active coping," and "palliative reaction pattern," as well as with depressive personality traits. In a multivariate model, the predictive power of SCB appeared to be accounted for by reassuring thoughts and depressive PD. Coping scales might be preferable over the RFL as a predictor of self-damaging and <b>suicidal</b> <b>behaviors</b> in borderline patient...|$|R

40|$|Suicide is {{the third}} {{leading cause of death}} among {{adolescents}} in the USA. The suicide rate for individuals 15 - 19 years of age, while having declined since the early 1990 s, has recently shown signs of an increasing trend. The prevalence of being overweight has also steadily risen among adolescents, and has tripled since 1960. This study utilizes data from the Youth Risk Behavioral Surveillance System (1999 - 2007) to explore the relationship between the perception of being overweight and <b>suicidal</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Studies have shown a high degree of correlation between overweight status, depressive disorders, and <b>suicidal</b> <b>behaviors.</b> This study analyzes these indicators in conjunction with individuals' perception of their weight. The empirical methodology is based on simultaneous-equations models and stratified samples to gauge whether the link between overweight indicators and suicide is causal or whether it is driven by other factors. Results indicate that body dissatisfaction, as measured by the perception of being overweight, has a strong impact on all <b>suicidal</b> <b>behaviors</b> for girls. It raises the risk of suicide ideation by 6. 1 percentage points, suicide attempt by 3. 6 percentage points, and a serious suicide attempt by 0. 5 percentage points. Results are generally insignificant for males. Conditional on overweight perception, actual weight does not generally have an independent effect on <b>suicidal</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Policies aimed at reducing the prevalence of overweight among adolescents may further reduce <b>suicidal</b> <b>behaviors</b> by limiting overweight perception, especially among girls.

Materials and Methods: Data {{were obtained from the}} 2006 Korean Youth Risk Behavior Survey, a nationally representative sample of {{middle and high school students}} (32, 417 males and 31, 467 females) in grades seven through twelve. Bivariate and multivariate logistic analyses were conducted. Several important covariates, such as age, family living structure, household economic status, academic performance, current alcohol drinking, current cigarette smoking, current butane gas or glue sniffing, perceived body weight, unhealthy weight control behaviors, subjective sleep evaluation, and depressed mood were included in the analyses. Results: Both male and female preteen initiators of each problem behavior were at greater risk for <b>suicidal</b> <b>behaviors</b> than non-initiators, even after controlling for covariates. More numerous concurrent problematic behaviors were correlated with greater likelihood of seriously considering or attempting suicide among both males and females. This pattern was more clearly observed in preteen than in teen initiators although the former and latter were engaged in the same frequency of problem behavior. Conclusion: Early initiation of alcohol drinking, cigarette smoking, and sexual intercourse, particularly among preteens, represented an important predictor of later suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in both genders. Thus, early preventive intervention programs should be developed and may reduce the potential risks for subsequent <b>suicidal</b> <b>behaviors...</b>|$|R
40|$|Suicide is {{a leading}} cause of death worldwide. Although {{research}} has made strides in better defining <b>suicidal</b> <b>behaviors,</b> there has been less focus on accurate measurement. Currently, the widespread use of self-report, single-item questions to assess suicide ideation, plans and attempts may contribute to measurement problems and misclassification. We examined the validity of single-item measurement and the potential for statistical errors. Over 1, 500 participants completed an online survey containing single-item questions regarding a history of <b>suicidal</b> <b>behaviors,</b> followed by questions with more precise language, multiple response options and narrative responses to examine the validity of single-item questions. We also conducted simulations to test whether common statistical tests are robust against the degree of misclassification produced by the use of single-items. We found that 11. 3 % of participants that endorsed a single-item suicide attempt measure engaged in behavior that would not meet the standard definition of a suicide attempt. Similarly, 8. 8 % of those who endorsed a single-item measure of suicide ideation endorsed thoughts that would not meet standard definitions of suicide ideation. Statistical simulations revealed that this level of misclassification substantially decreases statistical power and increases the likelihood of false conclusions from statistical tests. Providing a wider range of response options for each item reduced the misclassification rate by approximately half. Overall, the use of single-item, self-report questions to assess the presence of <b>suicidal</b> <b>behaviors</b> leads to misclassification, increasing the likelihood of statistical decision errors.
