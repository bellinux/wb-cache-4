5|$|Over-hunting {{also caused}} a severe {{population}} bottleneck {{in the northern}} elephant seal in the 19th century.

5|$|The {{islands are}} frequented by marine mammals, {{such as the}} <b>southern</b> <b>elephant</b> <b>seal</b> and the South American fur seal, and various types of cetaceans; {{offshore}} islands house the rare striated caracara. The Falklands are also home to five different penguin species {{and a few of}} the largest albatross colonies on the planet. Endemic fish around the islands are primarily from the genus Galaxias. The Falklands are treeless and have a wind-resistant vegetation predominantly composed of a variety of dwarf shrubs.|$|E
5|$|All {{pinnipeds}} are carnivorous and predatory. As a whole, {{they mostly}} feed on fish and cephalopods, followed by crustaceans and bivalves, and then zooplankton and endothermic ("warm-blooded") prey like sea birds. While most species are generalist and opportunistic feeders, {{a few are}} specialists. Examples include the crabeater seal, which primarily eats krill, the ringed seal, which eats mainly crustaceans, the Ross seal and <b>southern</b> <b>elephant</b> <b>seal,</b> which specialize on squid, and the bearded seal and walrus, which feed on clams and other bottom-dwelling invertebrates. Pinnipeds may hunt solitarily or cooperatively. The former behavior is typical when hunting non-schooling fish, slow-moving or immobile invertebrates or endothermic prey. Solitary foraging species usually exploit coastal waters, bays and rivers. An exception to this is the northern elephant seal, which feeds on fish at great depths in the open ocean. In addition, walruses feed solitarily but are often near other walruses in small or large groups that may surface and dive in unison. When large schools of fish or squid are available, pinnipeds such as certain otariids hunt cooperatively in large groups, locating and herding their prey. Some species, such as California and South American sea lions, may forage with cetaceans and sea birds.|$|E

25|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>{{elephant}}</b> <b>seal</b> (Mirounga leonina) {{is one of}} the {{two species}} of elephant seals. It is both the largest living pinniped and member of the order Carnivora, as well as the largest marine mammal after the cetaceans. It gets its name from its great size and the large proboscis of the adult male, which is used to make extraordinarily loud roaring noises, especially during the mating season. About 40 percent heavier than the male northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) and more than twice as heavy as the male walrus (Odobenus rosmarus), the bull <b>southern</b> <b>elephant</b> <b>seal</b> is without rival the largest carnivoran alive. An average adult male <b>southern</b> <b>elephant</b> <b>seal</b> weighs six to seven times more than the largest terrestrial carnivorans, the polar bear (Ursus maritimus) and Kodiak bear (Ursus arctos middendorffi). Additionally, it rivals the extinct giant walrus Pontolis, whose estimated weight in life was similar, as the largest carnivoran ever known.|$|E

25|$|As far as duration, depth, and the {{sequence}} of dives, the <b>southern</b> <b>elephant</b> <b>seal</b> is the best performing seal. In many regards, they exceed even most cetaceans.

40|$|<b>Southern</b> <b>elephant</b> <b>seals</b> {{spend two}} periods on land each year, during {{breeding}} and moult, exposed to intensive UV radiation.

40|$|Sexual {{segregation}} in habitat use {{occurs in a}} number of animal species, including <b>southern</b> <b>elephant</b> <b>seals,</b> where differences in migration localities and dive behaviour between sexes have been recorded. Due to the extreme sexual size dimorphism exhibited by <b>southern</b> <b>elephant</b> <b>seals,</b> it is unclear whether observed differences in dive behaviour are due to increased physiological capacity of males, compared to females, or differences in activity budgets and foraging behaviour. Here we use a mixed-effects modelling approach to investigate the effects of sex, size, age and individual variation on a number of dive parameters measured on <b>southern</b> <b>elephant</b> <b>seals</b> from Marion Island. Although individual variation accounted for substantial portions of total model variance for many response variables, differences in maximum and targeted dive depths were always influenced by sex, and only partly by body length. Conversely, dive durations were always influenced by body length, while sex was not identified as a significant influence. These results support hypotheses that physiological capability associated with body size is a limiting factor on dive durations. However, differences in vertical depth use appear {{to be the result of}} differences in forage selection between sexes, rather than a by-product of the size dimorphism displayed by this species. This provides further support for resource partitioning and possible avoidance of inter-sexual competition in <b>southern</b> <b>elephant</b> <b>seals...</b>|$|R
25|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>elephant</b> <b>seal</b> is {{distinguished}} from the northern elephant seal (which does not overlap in range with this species) by its greater body mass and a shorter proboscis. The southern males also appear taller when fighting, due to their tendency to bend their backs more strongly than the northern species. This seal shows extreme sexual dimorphism in size, seemingly the largest of any mammal by mass, with the males typically five to six times heavier than the females.|$|E
25|$|Sealing at Heard Island {{came to an}} end in {{the late}} 19th century, after the seal populations there had either become locally extinct or reduced to levels too low to exploit economically. Since then the populations have {{generally}} increased and are protected. Seals breeding on Heard include the <b>southern</b> <b>elephant</b> <b>seal,</b> the Antarctic fur seal and the subantarctic fur seal. Leopard seals visit regularly in winter to haul-out though they do not breed on the islands. Crabeater, Ross and Weddell seals are occasional visitors.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} {{large-scale}} seal hunting in the 19th century, the <b>southern</b> <b>elephant</b> <b>seal</b> recovered to a sizable population in the 1950s; since then, an unexplained decline in the subpopulations of the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean has occurred. The population {{now seems to be}} stable; the reasons for the fluctuation are unknown. Suggested explanations include a phenomenon of depression following a rapid demographic rebound that depletes vital resources, a change in climate, competition with other species whose numbers also varied, or even an adverse influence of scientific monitoring techniques.|$|E

500|$|Pinnipeds {{range in}} size from the [...] and [...] Baikal seal to the [...] and [...] <b>southern</b> <b>elephant</b> <b>seal.</b> Overall, they tend to be larger than other carnivorans; the <b>southern</b> <b>elephant</b> <b>seal</b> is the largest carnivoran. Several species have male-biased sexual {{dimorphism}} that correlates with the degree of polygyny in a species: highly polygynous species like elephant seals are extremely sexually dimorphic, while less polygynous species have males and females that are closer in size. In lobodontine seals, females are slightly larger than males. Males of sexually dimorphic species also tend to have secondary sex characteristics, such as the prominent proboscis of elephant seals, the inflatable red nasal membrane of hooded seals and the thick necks and manes of otariids. Despite a correlation between size dimorphism and the degree of polygyny, some evidence suggests that size differences between the sexes originated due to ecological differences and prior to the development of polygyny.|$|E
500|$|Seals {{range in}} size from the [...] and [...] Baikal seal to the [...] and [...] <b>southern</b> <b>elephant</b> <b>seal,</b> which is also the largest carnivoran. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism. They have {{streamlined}} bodies and four limbs that are modified into flippers. Though not as fast in the water as dolphins, seals are more flexible and agile. Otariids use their front limbs primarily to propel themselves through the water, while phocids and walruses use their hind limbs. Otariids and walruses have hind limbs that can be pulled under the body and used as legs on land. By comparison, terrestrial locomotion by phocids is more cumbersome. Otariids have visible external ears, while phocids and walruses lack these. Pinnipeds have well-developed senses—their eyesight and hearing are adapted for both air and water, and they have an advanced tactile system in their whiskers or vibrissae. Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. They have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin to keep warm in the cold water, and, other than the walrus, all species are covered in fur.|$|E
