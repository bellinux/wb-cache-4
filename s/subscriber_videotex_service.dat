5000|$|In fact, {{the most}} {{successful}} online services of the period were not <b>videotex</b> <b>services</b> at all. Despite the promises that videotex would appeal to the mass market, the <b>videotex</b> <b>services</b> were comfortably out-distanced by Dow Jones News/Retrieval (begun in 1973), CompuServe and (somewhat further behind) The Source, both begun in 1979. [...] None were <b>videotex</b> <b>services,</b> nor did they use the fixed frame-by-frame videotex model for content. Instead all three used search functions and text interfaces to deliver files that were {{for the most part}} plain ASCII. Other ASCII-based services that became popular included Delphi (launched in 1983) and GEnie (launched in 1985).|$|R

5000|$|One of {{the sources}} of CitiNet's success was that it was [...] "FREE, EASY and ASCII". This {{compared}} to some of the more graphically based systems that required special hardware to access. Viewtron, an early <b>videotex</b> <b>service</b> offered by Knight-Ridder and AT&T required a special $900 terminal called a Sceptre for access.|$|R
50|$|Viewtron was {{an online}} service offered by Knight-Ridder and AT&T from 1983 to 1986. Patterned after the British Post Office's Prestel system, {{it started as}} a <b>videotex</b> <b>service</b> {{requiring}} users {{to have a special}} terminal, the AT&T Sceptre. As home computers became important in the marketplace, the development focus shifted to IBM, Apple, Commodore and other personal computers.|$|R

It first began selling books online through an early <b>videotex</b> <b>service</b> called [...] "Trintex," [...] {{a joint venture}} between Sears and IBM, but the company's website was not launched until May 1997. According to B&N's website, it now carries over 2 million titles.|$|R
50|$|In {{a strict}} definition, {{videotex}} is any system that provides interactive content and displays it {{on a video}} monitor such as a television, typically using modems to send data in both directions. A close relative is teletext, which sends data in one direction only, typically encoded in a television signal. All such systems are occasionally referred to as viewdata. Unlike the modern Internet, traditional <b>videotex</b> <b>services</b> were highly centralized.|$|R
50|$|Australia's {{national}} public <b>Videotex</b> <b>service,</b> Viatel, was launched by Telecom Australia on 28 February 1985. It {{was based on}} the British Prestel service. The service was later renamed Discovery 40, in reference to its 40 column screen format, as well as to distinguish it from another Telecom service, Discovery 80.The Viatel system had a very rapid take up in its first year due to the efforts of GEC Manager Terry Crews and his pioneering work on home banking for the Commonwealth Bank.|$|R
50|$|The Minitel was a <b>Videotex</b> online <b>service</b> {{accessible}} through telephone lines, and {{is considered}} one of the world's most successful pre-World Wide Web online services.|$|R
5000|$|A 1982 {{study by}} The New York Times {{described}} a technology assessment {{study by the}} Institute for the Future, [...] "peering into the future of an electronic world". The study focused on the emerging videotex industry, formed by the marriage of two older technologies, communications and computing. It estimated that 40 percent of American households will have two-way <b>videotex</b> <b>service</b> {{by the end of}} the century. By comparison, it took television 16 years to penetrate 90 percent of households from the time commercial service was begun.|$|R
50|$|The CRC {{was able}} to {{interest}} the Department of Communications (DoC), their superiors within the federal government, to fund development of their system into {{the basis for a}} <b>videotex</b> <b>service.</b> Unlike the systems being developed in Europe and in Japan, the Canadian system would offer high-quality 2D graphics, higher-speed, and could be used for one-way fixed or menued displays (teletext), two-way systems based on modems (videotex), or they could combine the two, allowing information to be sent to the customer in the video signal, and returned via modem.|$|R
50|$|The largest {{efforts were}} made in the United States. After the Venture One {{experiments}} in 1982/3, AT&T decided not to pursue a <b>videotex</b> <b>service</b> of its own, but instead provide service and support to other companies who wanted to. CBS invested considerable capital in the development of their ExtraVision service, which also included closed captioning and channel information along with more traditional Telidon information. Affiliate stations could also insert their own content into the streams, although the high cost of the systems needed to do this made it relatively rare.|$|R
50|$|Alex was {{the name}} of an {{interactive}} <b>videotex</b> information <b>service</b> offered by Bell Canada in market research from 1988 to 1990 and thence to the general public until 1994.|$|R
50|$|In the Netherlands {{the then}} {{state-owned}} phone company PTT (now KPN) operated two platforms: Viditel and Videotex Nederland. From the user perspective {{the main difference}} between these systems was that Viditel used standard dial-in phone numbers where Videotex used premium-rate telephone numbers. For Viditel you needed a (paid) subscription {{and on top of that}} you paid for each page you visited. For <b>Videotex</b> <b>services</b> you normally didn't need a subscription nor was there the need to authenticate: you paid for the services via the premium rate of the modem-connection based on connection time, regardless of the pages or services you retrieved.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} U.S. {{companies}} also expressed an interest, and started plans {{for their own}} Telidon-based teletext systems. As early as 1978, AT&T Corporation and CBS had been experimenting {{with the idea of}} a <b>videotex</b> <b>service,</b> and were drawn towards the Telidon efforts. In 1982 they introduced an experimental system known as [...] "Venture One" [...] in Ridgewood, New Jersey, equipping some homes with stand-alone terminals from AT&T, and others with set-top boxes. The test ran for seven months from 1982 to 83, and was considered a success, so much so that AT&T publicly announced plans to introduce a commercial system in 1984.|$|R
50|$|Datanet 1 was {{the public}} {{switched}} data network {{operated by the}} Dutch PTT Telecom (now known as KPN). Strictly speaking Datanet 1 only referred to the network and the connected users via leased lines (using the X.121 DNIC 2041), the name also referred to the public PAD service Telepad (using the DNIC 2049). And because the main <b>Videotex</b> <b>service</b> used the network and modified PAD devices as infrastructure the name Datanet 1 was used for these services as well. Although this use of the name was incorrect all these services were managed {{by the same people}} within one department of KPN contributed to the confusion.|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} digital {{technologies}} brings {{a whole new}} dimension to human-tohuman communication. From postal delivery system to telegraph, from telegraph to telephone, from telephone to television, technologies {{change the way we}} communicate with each other. Whether one-to-one or one-to-many, the information medium has changed from text to voice, from voice to images. The demand in bandwidth grows with the enrichment of information content. Issues in technology, policy and economics make visual communication nowhere near the ubiquitousness voice communication- telephone. Are we anywhere near that goal? What are the key technological, political and economical issues that we have to overcome to make that happen? This project examines past attempts of picturephone and <b>videotex</b> <b>services,</b> and try to shed some light into a future visual communication system...|$|R
50|$|In 1983, JCPenney {{discontinued}} its appliance, {{hardware and}} auto center departments, and also sold its automotive centers to Firestone. Also in 1983, JCPenney began selling online through the Viewtron <b>videotex</b> <b>service.</b> In 1984, JCPenney acquired the First National Bank of Harrington, Delaware and renamed it JCPenney National Bank. With the bank the company became able to issue its own MasterCard and Visa cards. The company also began accepting American Express cards. Also that year, Thrift Drug began co-locating stores with Weis Markets, and acquired many former Pantry Pride properties. In April 1987, {{the company announced}} that it was moving its headquarters to Dallas, Texas. After several years of development, the JCPenney Television Shopping Channel appeared on cable systems beginning in 1989.|$|R
50|$|His {{began his}} career as a radio and TV {{producer}} in the BBC, and was a founder of the Open University. Between 1972 and 1977 he was Director of NDPCAL, National Development Programme in Computer Aided Learning, a government funded project that ran from 1973 until 1977, costing £2.5M and supporting some 35 projects covering schools, colleges, universities, industrial and military training. At BT he ran the world’s first commercial <b>videotex</b> <b>service,</b> Prestel. He ran the pan-European satellite television channel Super Channel owned by the ITV companies. He was Chairman of the Radio Authority from 2000 to 2003, Deputy Chairman of Ofcom from 2002 to 2005, and Chairman of Informa from 2005 to 2007.He carried out the independent review of the Royal Mail for Peter Mandelson and Vince Cable which recommended privatisation.|$|R
50|$|As {{said the}} <b>Videotex</b> Nederland <b>services</b> offered access via several primary rate {{numbers and the}} information/service {{provider}} could choose the costs for accessing his service. Depending on the number used, the tariff could vary from ƒ 0,00 to ƒ 1,00 Dutch guilders (which is between €0.00 and €0.45 euro) per minute.|$|R
50|$|By December 1985 Captain had 650 {{information}} providers, and {{the next}} year was rolled out to 245 cities. However, by March 1992 the system still only had 120,000 <b>subscribers.</b> Like other <b>videotex</b> systems worldwide (with the exception of the French Minitel), it never broke though to achieve mass-market usage.|$|R
50|$|As {{the use of}} {{computers}} that supported color and graphics, such the Atari 800, Commodore 64, Texas Instruments TI-99/4A, the Apple II series and early IBM PC compatibles, increased, online services gradually developed framed or partially graphical information displays. Early services such as CompuServe added increasingly sophisticated graphics-based front end software to present their information, though they continued to offer text-based access for those who needed or preferred it. In 1985 Viewtron, which began as a <b>Videotex</b> <b>service</b> requiring a dedicated terminal, introduced software allowing home computer owners access. Beginning in the mid-1980s graphics based online services such as PlayNET, Prodigy, MSN, and Quantum Link (aka Q-Link) were developed. Quantum Link, which was based on Commodore-only Playnet software, later developed AppleLink Personal Edition, PC-Link (based on Tandy's DeskMate), and Promenade (for IBM), all of which (including Q-Link) were later combined as America OnLine.|$|R
5000|$|The Sceptre was {{initially}} offered at $600, an [...] "introductory discount" [...] on an intended list price of $900. (It {{was said that}} each one cost AT&T $1200 to manufacture). [...] Specifying the Sceptre gave the <b>videotex</b> <b>services</b> {{the advantage of a}} single graphics standard to design their pages to, and it positioned the services squarely as aiming for the more general domestic consumer-electronics customer, rather than a more specialist computing sector. But there were few takers at the price, and sales were not helped by the further subscription and access connection charges, the leisurely speed of the system, and the relatively uninvolving nature of the information on the service. In May 1984 Viewtron responded by offering combined rental of the Sceptre and subscription for $39.95 a month, but take-up was still slight, and in May 1985 Viewtron belatedly opened the service to microcomputers.|$|R
5000|$|CitiNet was a {{prototype}} of the future Internet portals, with daily content, online shopping, and social activities. Some of the early advertisers were several local employment agencies, auto leasing agencies, magazine publishers such as Byte Magazine and a large movie theater chain (Sack Theaters). Online vendors sold cheese, cookies, music disks, VCRs, fax machines, and groceries. One {{of the more popular}} services was the Daily Horoscope by astrologer Lillian Bono. A partnership made CitiNet the [...] "official online service for the Boston Computer Society (BCS)", also, the official <b>videotex</b> <b>service</b> of the World Trade Center (Boston). Sports was covered by reporters (like today's bloggers) and Richard Koch could be found in the Boston Celtics or Red Sox locker rooms and posting updates from the press box using a TRS-80 Model 100. Then as now, social interaction led the day, with free email, multi-user chat, and dozens of forums (from cat lovers to vcr help).|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the Harris Group joined other media organizations, {{including}} such giants as Knight-Ridder and Times Mirror, in {{experimenting with a}} <b>videotex</b> news <b>service,</b> which was available to personal computers via phone modem. Harris Electronic News was launched in Hutchinson in 1982, then moved to Kansas City the next year. The service offered a varied menu of on-line information, ranging from agricultural and weather data to sports and recipes.|$|R
40|$|Anne-Marie Loffler-Laurian : « Machine {{translation}} : its use by {{the public}} at large » The SYSTRAN machine translation system, which is widely used at the Commission of the European Community and in several large research centers and industrial firms, has been implemented on the French public <b>videotex</b> <b>service,</b> Minitel. We study the output of this system from a linguistic point of view. It clearly emerges that a system based on and aimed at technical translation (including technologies and administration) cannot be used by {{the public at large}} without a great amount of development, if ever. The linguistic features of general speech are different from those of specialized discourses, therefore rules are not easily transferrable {{and the quality of the}} results of this machine translation are of a far lower quality than those obtained when it is used in technical environment.

50|$|The first {{attempts}} at a general-purpose <b>videotex</b> <b>service</b> {{were created in}} the United Kingdom in the late 1960s. In about 1970 the BBC had a brainstorming session {{in which it was}} decided to start researching ways to send closed captioning information to audience. As the Teledata research continued the BBC became interested in using the system for delivering any sort of information, not just closed captioning.In 1972, the concept was first made public under the new name Ceefax. Meanwhile, the General Post Office (soon to become British Telecom) had been researching a similar concept since the late 1960s, known as Viewdata. Unlike Ceefax which was a one-way service carried in the existing TV signal, Viewdata was a two-way system using telephones. Since the Post Office owned the telephones, this was considered to be an excellent way to drive more customers to use the phones. Not to be outdone by the BBC, they also announced their service, under the name Prestel. ITV soon joined the fray with a Ceefax-clone known as ORACLE.|$|R

40|$|These essays {{analyze the}} {{technology}} and possible new services resulting from the creation and introduction of new information <b>services</b> offered by <b>videotex</b> systems. The bare existence of these services and of the uses that this novel technology offers is far from sufficient to guarantee success. One has {{to take into account}} all relevant relationships with other services, which creates a "selection environment" that finally determines the acceptance of the new technology. It is extremely difficult to predict the market penetration and rate of diffusion of <b>videotex</b> <b>services,</b> factors that would be of significance for decision and policy makers. The authors examine the penetration of other, associated technologies (such as radio and television) in different countries and cultures and relate them to economic and social factors. New information services will be an important component of future society; indeed, they already have several definite features, whereas those of the future society are not yet discernible. Dr. Sebestyen addresses this problem, which transcends the macroeconomic impact of information technology and is a subject for study in the social sciences. Policies cannot be designed successfully without taking due account of all economic and social impacts of new technology. This is the overall message of these essays, together with an illustration of which uncertainties and risks a researcher in this field has to face...|$|R
