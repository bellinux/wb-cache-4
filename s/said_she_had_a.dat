5|$|Manning is a trans woman who, in a {{statement}} the day after sentencing, <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> female gender identity since childhood, wanted {{to be known as}} Chelsea, and desired to begin hormone replacement therapy. Reaction to Manning's disclosures, arrest, and sentence was mixed. Her biographer, Denver Nicks, writes that the leaked diplomatic cables were seen by some (but disputed by others) as a catalyst for the Arab Spring that began in December 2010, and that she was viewed by some as a 21st-century Tiananmen Square Tank Man and by others as an embittered traitor.|$|E

Lennon asked {{a real estate broker}} to put in an offer for it in February 1975. Lennon and Pang were also {{planning}} on visiting Paul and Linda McCartney in New Orleans in February 1975, where Wings were recording the Venus and Mars album, but Lennon reconciled with Ono the day before the planned visit, after Ono <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> new cure for Lennon's smoking habit.|$|E

Some criticised she had had pro-British background while some <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> close friendship with former Chief Secretary, Anson Chan.

25|$|Geeknet (formerly VA Linux) - A {{provider}} of built-to-order Intel systems based on Linux and other open source projects.

500|$|However, writer Breanne Fahs {{describes}} Solanas as {{a contradiction}} which [...] "alienates {{her from the}} feminist movement." [...] Fahs argues that Solanas {{never wanted to be}} [...] "in movement" [...] but she nevertheless fractured the feminist movement by provoking N.O.W. members to disagree about her case. Many contradictions are seen in her lifestyle (a lesbian who sexually serviced men, claim of being asexual, confusion), a rejection of queer culture, and a non-interest in working with others despite a co-dependency on others. Fahs also brings into question the contradictory stories of Solanas's life. Solanas's life is described as one of a victim, a rebel, a desperate loner, yet Solanas's cousin says she worked as a waitress in her late 20s and 30s, not primarily as a prostitute, and friend Geoffrey LaGear <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> [...] "groovy childhood." [...] Solanas also kept in touch with her father throughout her life, which makes one question and complicate the notion that Solanas hated her father and acted out this hatred in the shooting/manifesto. Fahs believes that Solanas embraced these contradictions as a key part of her identity.|$|E
500|$|Chopra {{described}} her character Sweety as [...] "feisty and vivacious". She said, [...] "Sweety is very busy, {{and does not}} have time {{to take care of her}} looks and apply make up. Her only aim in life is to bunk her lectures and visit her boyfriend's college or stay in his hotel, and eventually marry him." [...] Chopra described both her character and herself as being [...] "outspoken and fun loving" [...] as well as honest and unable to [...] "hide something that is wrong". She <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> different cultural background to Sweety, and found it challenging to convincingly portray a Maharashtrian Marathi girl. She had to adopt body language and a Maharashtrian accent to suit the character. She learnt the Marathi language to make the character as authentic as possible, which she found difficult as a Punjabi. Chopra said: [...] "I am speaking a lot of Marathi in the film. It was difficult for me because it's a difficult language and I am not good at Marathi. But I think it's my luck that through Kaminey I got to learn one more language." ...|$|E

500|$|Through her Twitter account, Fantasia {{discussed}} {{how she feels}} a strong connection between her music career and her Christian faith.

500|$|Anne exerted a {{powerful}} charm {{on those who}} met her, though opinions differed on her attractiveness. The Venetian diarist Marino Sanuto, who saw Anne when Henry VIII met Francis I at Calais in October 1532, described her as [...] "not one of the handsomest women in the world; she is of middling stature, swarthy complexion, long neck, wide mouth, bosom not much raised... eyes, which are black and beautiful". Simon Grynée wrote to Martin Bucer in September 1531 that Anne was [...] "young, good-looking, of a rather dark complexion". Lancelot de Carle called her [...] "beautiful with an elegant figure", and a Venetian in Paris in 1528 also reported that {{she was said to}} be beautiful. The most influential description of Anne, but also the least reliable, was written by the Catholic propagandist and polemicist Nicholas Sanders in 1586, half a century after Anne's death: [...] "Anne Boleyn was rather tall of stature, with black hair, and an oval face of a sallow complexion, as if troubled with jaundice. It is <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> projecting tooth under the upper lip, and on her right hand six fingers. There was a large wen under her chin, and therefore to hide its ugliness she wore a high dress covering her throat... She was handsome to look at, with a pretty mouth". Sanders held Anne responsible for Henry VIII's rejection of the Catholic Church, and writing fifty years after her death, was keen to demonise her. Sanders's description contributed to what biographer Eric Ives calls the [...] "monster legend" [...] of Anne Boleyn. Though his details were fictitious, they have formed the basis for references to Anne's appearance even in some modern textbooks.|$|E

2500|$|June 25, 1980: Franklin used a [...]44 Ruger pistol to kill two hitchhikers, Nancy Santomero (19) and Vicki Durian (26), in Pocahontas County, West Virginia.

Jacob Beard of Florida was convicted and imprisoned in 1993 on these charges. He was freed in 1999 and a new trial was ordered based on Franklin's confession.|$|E
2500|$|Before Smith was born, {{his mother}} Lucy Mack Smith {{went to a}} grove near her home in Vermont and prayed about her husband Joseph Smith, Sr.'s {{repudiation}} of evangelical religion. That night she <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> dream which she interpreted as a prophecy that Joseph, Sr., would later accept the [...] "pure and undefiled Gospel of the Son of God." [...] She also stated that Smith, Sr. {{had a number of}} dreams or visions between 1811 and 1819, the first vision occurring when his mind was [...] "much excited upon the subject of religion." [...] Joseph Sr.'s first vision confirmed to him the correctness of his refusal to join any organized religious group.|$|E

[...] After being pushed by Jarrett, Gayda slapped him and then went after his valet, Gail Kim. The following week, Gayda came out again to confront Jarrett. After pushing and slapping, the two had to be pulled apart by officials. At Turning Point, {{the same thing happened}} in the main event match, but Gayda was restrained by officials. On the December 31 show, Don West tracked down Gayda for an interview. She said her being there {{had nothing to do with}} a love affair, but rather that Jarrett had promised her a spot on the TNA Roster, but while she was stuck at home, she turned on the television to see Kim in her place. She <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> big secret about Jarrett that TNA Management would love to hear, but did not reveal what it was.|$|E
