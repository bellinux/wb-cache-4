This method of energy storage is used, for example, by the Solar Two power station, allowing it to store 1.44TJ in its 68m³ storage tank, enough to provide full output for close to 39 hours, with an efficiency of about 99%.|$|E

50|$|In 1872 and 1875, Weber {{published}} two noteworthy {{papers in}} the Annalen der Physik on determining the <b>specific</b> <b>heats</b> of carbon, boron, and silicon at various temperatures (Weber 1872, 1875). Working in Helmholtz’s refurbished Berlin laboratory, Weber measured the <b>specific</b> <b>heats</b> of these three elements and showed them to be noticeably smaller at low temperatures than predicted by the Dulong - Petit law; moreover, he found that, {{with an increase in}} temperature, their <b>specific</b> <b>heats</b> increased extraordinarily rapidly. Only when he increased the temperature beyond 1,000 degrees Celsius did the <b>specific</b> <b>heats</b> again follow the predictions of Dulong and Petit. For nearly thirty years Weber’s empirical findings remained an anomaly until one of his students presented a new explanation (Weiss 1912, pp. 49 - 50; Pais 1982, pp. 391 - 392).|$|R

5|$|Helium is {{the second}} least {{reactive}} noble gas after neon, and thus the second least reactive of all elements. It is chemically inert and monatomic in all standard conditions. Because of helium's relatively low molar (atomic) mass, its thermal conductivity, <b>specific</b> <b>heat,</b> and sound speed in the gas phase are all greater than any other gas except hydrogen. For these reasons and {{the small size of}} helium monatomic molecules, helium diffuses through solids at a rate three times that of air and around 65% that of hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Einstein {{proposed}} {{a model of}} matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator. In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently—a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator. Einstein was aware that getting {{the frequency of the}} actual oscillations would be difficult, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the <b>specific</b> <b>heat</b> problem in classical mechanics.

5|$|Beryllium is a steel {{gray and}} hard metal that is brittle at room {{temperature}} and has a close-packed hexagonal crystal structure. It has exceptional stiffness (Young's modulus 287 GPa) and a reasonably high melting point. The modulus of elasticity of beryllium is approximately 50% {{greater than that of}} steel. The combination of this modulus and a relatively low density results in an unusually fast sound conduction speed in beryllium – about 12.9km/s at ambient conditions. Other significant properties are high <b>specific</b> <b>heat</b> (1925 J·kg−1·K−1) and thermal conductivity (216 W·m−1·K−1), which make beryllium the metal with the best heat dissipation characteristics per unit weight. In combination with the relatively low coefficient of linear thermal expansion (11.4×10−6 K−1), these characteristics result in a unique stability under conditions of thermal loading.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} quantum effects to be {{explicitly}} noticed (but not understood at the time) was a Maxwell observation involving hydrogen, half a century before full quantum mechanical theory arrived. Maxwell observed that the <b>specific</b> <b>heat</b> capacity of H2 unaccountably departs {{from that of a}} diatomic gas below room temperature and begins to increasingly resemble that of a monatomic gas at cryogenic temperatures. According to quantum theory, this behavior arises from the spacing of the (quantized) rotational energy levels, which are particularly wide-spaced in H2 because of its low mass. These widely spaced levels inhibit equal partition of heat energy into rotational motion in hydrogen at low temperatures. Diatomic gases composed of heavier atoms do not have such widely spaced levels and do not exhibit the same effect.|$|E
5|$|Paul Drude in 1900 {{proposed}} the first theoretical {{model for a}} classical electron moving through a metallic solid. Drude's model described properties of metals {{in terms of a}} gas of free electrons, and was the first microscopic model to explain empirical observations such as the Wiedemann–Franz law. However, despite the success of Drude's free electron model, it had one notable problem: it was unable to correctly explain the electronic contribution to the <b>specific</b> <b>heat</b> and magnetic properties of metals, and the temperature dependence of resistivity at low temperatures.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze the effects of friction and heat transfer with considerations of variable <b>specific</b> <b>heats</b> of working fluid on the performance of a Miller cycle Diesel engine. The variations in power output and thermal efficiency with compression ratio, and the relations between the power output and the thermal efficiency of the Miller cycle Diesel engine are presented. The results show that the power output as well as the efficiency where maximum power output occurs will decrease with the increase of heat loss. The temperature-dependent <b>specific</b> <b>heats</b> of working fluid have a significant influence on the performance. The power output and the working range of the Miller cycle Diesel engine increase with the increase of <b>specific</b> <b>heats</b> of working fluid, while, the efficiency decreases with the increase of <b>specific</b> <b>heats</b> of working fluid. The influence of the parameter b related to the friction loss has a negative effect on the performance. Therefore, the power output and efficiency of the cycle decrease with increasing b. Note that the effects of heat transfer with considerations of variable <b>specific</b> <b>heats</b> of working fluid and friction loss on the performance are significant and should be considered in practice cycle analysis...|$|R
5|$|The Atlantic Ocean has a moderating {{effect on}} {{temperature}} in Jersey, as water {{has a much}} greater <b>specific</b> <b>heat</b> capacity than air and tends to heat and cool slowly throughout the year. This has a warming influence on coastal areas in winter and a cooling influence in summer. The highest temperature recorded was 36.0°C (96.8°F) on 9 August 2003, and the lowest temperature recorded was −10.3°C (13.5°F) on 5 January 1894. By comparison, higher temperatures are found in mainland United Kingdom, which achieved 38.5°C (101.3°F) in Faversham, Kent on 10 August 2003. The impact of the Atlantic Ocean and coastal winds ensure that Jersey is slightly cooler than the southern and central parts of England during the summer months.|$|E
25|$|<b>Specific</b> <b>heat,</b> {{also called}} <b>specific</b> <b>heat</b> capacity, {{is defined as}} the amount of energy that has to be {{transferred}} to or from one unit of mass (kilogram) or amount of substance (mole) to change the system temperature by one degree. <b>Specific</b> <b>heat</b> is a physical property, which means that it depends on the substance under consideration and its state as specified by its properties.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} the equipartition theorem is {{intertwined}} with that of <b>specific</b> <b>heat</b> capacity, {{both of which were}} studied in the 19th century. In 1819, the French physicists Pierre Louis Dulong and Alexis Thérèse Petit discovered that the <b>specific</b> <b>heat</b> capacities of solid elements at room temperature were inversely proportional to the atomic weight of the element. Their law was used for many years as a technique for measuring atomic weights. However, subsequent studies by James Dewar and Heinrich Friedrich Weber showed that this Dulong–Petit law holds only at high temperatures; at lower temperatures, or for exceptionally hard solids such as diamond, the <b>specific</b> <b>heat</b> capacity was lower.

40|$|<b>Specific</b> <b>heats</b> {{of quantum}} systems with {{symmetric}} and asymmetric double-well potentials have been calculated. In numerical calculations of their <b>specific</b> <b>heats,</b> we {{have adopted the}} combined method which takes into account not only eigenvalues of ϵ_n for 0 ≤ n ≤ N_m obtained by the energy-matrix diagonalization but also their extrapolated ones for N_m+ 1 ≤ n < ∞ (N_m= 20 or 30). Calculated <b>specific</b> <b>heats</b> are shown to be rather different from counterparts of a harmonic oscillator. In particular, <b>specific</b> <b>heats</b> of symmetric double-well systems at very low temperatures have the Schottky-type anomaly, which is rooted to a small energy gap in low-lying two-level eigenstates induced by a tunneling through the potential barrier. The Schottky-type anomaly is removed when an asymmetry is introduced into the double-well potential. It has been {{pointed out that the}} specific-heat calculation of a double-well system reported by Feranchuk, Ulyanenkov and Kuz'min [Chem.
