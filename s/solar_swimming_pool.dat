The heater and the manual had {{to be based on}} the research literature, since there were no solar energy texts at the time. The history of the project, of the hardware, and of the technology is discussed, and comments are included on the next manual edition being prepared, and on the educational objectives for the two manual editions...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this bachelor’s thesis is to evaluate the possibilities of using <b>solar</b> collectors for <b>swimming</b> <b>pool</b> heating. The <b>solar</b> pool heating is often combined with solar water heating. The thesis examine technical parameters, effectivity and purchase cost of the thermal solar systems for both mentioned applications. The {{first part of the}} study is focused on general description of the solar radiation, its availability and potential of usage. The next part is dealing with collectors’ energy budget, their efficiency and means of their insulation. Further, there are described the most used types of the thermal solar collectors and various constructions of the thermal solar systems of nowadays. The last part is dedicated to specific project of thermal solar system for pool heating and its price budget...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work, a {{theoretical}} model is presented concerning the various energy fluxes in a <b>solar</b> heated outdoor <b>swimming</b> <b>pool,</b> with a bare or covered surface. The analysis considers the instantaneous energy balance using actual climatological data, special attention being focussed on setting up equations for {{the calculation of}} the turbulent heat-mass transfer energy fluxes. Thus, the net heat loss can be calculated under constant water temperature conditions, {{paving the way for}} the determination of the needed solar collector heat power and/or conventional heating. A computer program is written and developed to implement the analysis. To check the validity of the model, experimental work has been carried out at the Athens Olympic (25 × 50 m) <b>swimming</b> <b>pool,</b> which is heated by a solar collector array consisting of flat plate plastic panels. A vast monitoring campaign is undertaken, involving the installation of the sensing instruments and the data acquisition and reduction system. All the relevant parameters were continuously recorded and conveniently averaged over 1 h intervals. For the first year of operation, the agreement between experimental results and theoretical calculations (on an hourly basis) is promising for the days tested. From a comparison of the magnitudes of the individual flux losses, it is concluded that the higher loss contributor is the evaporative one. © 1987...|$|R

40|$|Title: The Analysis of Selected <b>Swimming</b> <b>Pools</b> in Prague Objectives: The aim of {{my thesis}} {{is to create}} an {{analysis}} of selected <b>swimming</b> <b>pools</b> and to compare them to each others. Furthermore, the thesis should show the threats and opportunities of the selected <b>swimming</b> <b>pools.</b> Methods: The case analysis was chosen as the main research method. In the preparation of this analysis other methods were applied, such as intentional selection, document analysis and semi-structured interview. Based on the results the SWOT analysis was developed. Through this method the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the selected <b>swimming</b> <b>pools</b> are shown. The final comparison of all the <b>swimming</b> <b>pools</b> was made using all the previously mentioned methods. Results: The analysis shows that we can label all the selected <b>swimming</b> <b>pools</b> in Prague as functional <b>swimming</b> <b>pools.</b> Functional <b>swimming</b> <b>pools</b> do not lose money, nor do they profit. However, it was proved that none of the chosen <b>swimming</b> <b>pools</b> would be able to function without getting some form of grants.
