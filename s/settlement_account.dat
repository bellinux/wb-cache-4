5000|$|CHATS, {{like other}} RTGS systems, settles payment {{transactions}} on a [...] "real time" [...] and [...] "gross" [...] basis—payments are not subjected to any waiting period and each transaction is settled in a one-to-one manner {{such that it}} is not bunched with other transactions.

Payments are final, irrevocable, and settled immediately if there is sufficient funds in the participant's <b>settlement</b> <b>account</b> with the clearing house. Daylight overdraft is not offered in CHATS; payments that cannot be settled due to insufficient funds are queued. Banks are able to alter, cancel, and re-sequence payments in their queues.|$|E

50|$|Each Settlement Member holds {{a single}} {{multi-currency}} account with CLS. At {{the start and}} end of a normal settlement day, each Settlement Member has a zero balance on its account.

50|$|Most {{registered}} banks hold settlement {{accounts at}} the Reserve Bank, {{which are used}} to settle obligations with {{each other at the}} end of the day. For example, if you write out a cheque or make an EFT-POS payment, the money is paid by your bank to the bank of the recipient. Many hundreds of thousands of such transactions are made every day. The Bank pays interest on <b>settlement</b> <b>account</b> balances, and charges interest on overnight borrowing, at rates related to the OCR. These rates are reviewed from time to time, as is the OCR. The most crucial part of the system is the fact that the Reserve Bank sets no limit on the amount of cash it will borrow or lend at rates related to the OCR.|$|E

50|$|Later, in June 2011, Hans-Werner Sinn and Timo Wollmershaeuser {{compiled}} {{the first}} panel database of the Eurozone's Target balances. The authors {{point out that}} the additional creation of money by the central banks of the crisis-stricken countries was provided by a lowering of the standards for the collateral that commercial banks have to provide to their national central banks to obtain refinancing credit. Furthermore, they showed that the commercial banks of the Eurozone's core countries used the incoming liquidity to reduce the refinancing credit they drew from their national central bank, even lending the surplus liquidity to this central bank, which implies that the Target balances indirectly also measure the reallocation of refinancing credit among the countries of the Eurozone. The authors showed that the national central banks of the northern countries became net debtors to their own banking systems. Sinn and Wollmershaeuser argue that the euro crisis is a balance-of-payments crisis, which in its substance is similar to the Bretton Woods crisis. Moreover, they show the extent to which Target credit financed current account deficits or capital flight in Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy. They also show that the current account deficits of Greece and Portugal were financed for years by refinancing credits of their national central banks and the concomitant Target credit. They document as well the Irish capital flight and the capital flight from Spain and Italy, which began in earnest in summer 2011. Following Sinn, the authors compare the Target balances of the Eurosystem with the corresponding balances in the US settlement system (Interdistrict <b>Settlement</b> <b>Account)</b> and point out that US balances relative to US GDP have decreased thanks to a regularly performed settlement procedure in which ownership shares in a common Fed clearing portfolio are reallocated among the various District Feds comprising the US Federal Reserve System. They advocate the establishment of a similar system in Europe to end the ECB's role as a provider of international public credit that undercuts private market conditions. Hans-Werner Sinn addressed the Target balances issue again in a special edition of 'ifo Schnelldienst' and made it the main topic of his book ‘Die Target-Falle‘ ("The Target Trap"), published in early October 2012.|$|E

The structure is safe to carry the applied loads. The settlement is measured using the single point of <b>settlement</b> <b>account</b> meter and calculated using the norm codes. The results showed a new field measurement method to calculate the compressed layer thickness which is considered as a difficult task to monitor in the field. The final results calculated for the settlement of the pile foundation needed correction of factors to be conservative for the measurement of the project. The correction factors are proposed to modify the codes calculation within the permissible ranges...|$|E
40|$|Prefectures and {{municipalities}} (cities, towns, and villages) are principal actors in various administrative areas, including school education, welfare and public health, {{police and fire}} services, {{and the construction of}} such public works as roads and sewerage systems. They {{play a major role in}} national life. This brochure will introduce the state of local public finance, which is an assemblage of the finances of individual local governments, with particular focus on the state of settlements for fiscal 2006 and efforts toward financial soundness of the local public entities centered on the ordinary account. Although the accounts of local governments are divided into general accounts and special accounts, the account classification of each local government is not uniform. Therefore, we have adopted a uniform method in the <b>settlement</b> <b>account</b> statistics by classifying accounts as an ordinary account, which covers the general administrative sector, and other accounts (public business accounts). This enables us to clarify the financial condition of local governments as a whole and to make a statistical comparison among local governments...|$|E

40|$|Monetary {{policy can}} be {{implemented}} effectively without reserve requirements as long as cost incentives ensure a predictable demand for settlement balances. A central bank can then achieve the level of short-term interest rates that it desires, using market-oriented instruments only.
