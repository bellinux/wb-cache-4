500|$|In {{line with}} the McGregor's ideal of unified workers was a [...] "quest" [...] to make order from the chaos around him. Throughout Marching Men distinctions between order and {{disorder}} are put forward both as ruminations of the narrator and as elements of the plot. Examples of comparisons in the plot begin early on when miners in disarray are compared with organized soldiers. Later, an unbridled Chicago is contrasted with McGregor's orderly routine. Finally, the frustrated mass of job-seekers McGregor encounters upon his arrival to the city is seen against the neat groups of marching men that excite a young reporter in Book VI. Beyond plot points, phrases such as [...] "In the heart of all men lies sleeping the love of order..." [...] and speaking of McGregor, [...] "His body <b>shook</b> <b>with</b> {{the strength of his}} desire to end the vast disorder of life", among others [...] also work to set up the dichotomy of order and chaos.|$|E
500|$|The {{concerts in}} England and Ireland {{received}} mixed feedback from critics. Kitty Empire (The Observer) was not {{impressed with the}} show at Windsor Hall. Empire wrote, [...] "It's easy to sneer at boy bands, but always worth considering their appeal. It {{goes without saying that}} One Direction are slick, and often bland. With the exception of their persuasive No 1 single, [...] "What Makes You Beautiful", their songs aren't wildly distinctive". For the concert at the HMV Hammersmith Apollo in London, James Robertson (Daily Mirror) gave the band a positive review. He states, [...] "The room <b>shook</b> <b>with</b> hair raising, ear drum piercing and (if there had been windows) glass-shattering screams. Each took a turn walking forward to embrace the cries from the sold-out Hammersmith Apollo while singing the lame-named Na, Na, Na. It was impossible to tell which one of the five boys had the biggest ovation but the loudest cheer came when Niall played acoustic guitar as they sang solo around an artificial camp fire". Another glowing review was done by Alexandra Ryan (Evening Herald) for the concert at Dublin's The O2. She says, [...] "THEY came, they saw, they conquered. Dreams came true for thousands of Irish female fans as their pop idols One Direction took to the stage at the O2. Swarms of screaming girls flocked to the sold-out venue last night as Zayn, Harry, Louis, Liam and Mullingar teen Niall Horan performed for 14,000 fans".|$|E

500|$|Mother's Milk {{instantly}} garnered {{more attention}} than the band's previous records and, as such, the venues the band performed in were able to accommodate far larger crowds. For {{the first time the}} band also upgraded to a full-fledged tour bus and added backup musicians and singers. Longtime friend, Keith [...] "Tree" [...] Barry was added to play horns and backup singers Kristen Vigard and Vicki Calhoun (who appeared in the video for [...] "Knock Me Down") also joined the tour. When the band hit England, roadie Robbie Allen (nicknamed Rob Rule) would open for the band providing a comedy performance in which he would pretend to cut off his own penis. Allen would later become one of the band's backup singers on the One Hot Minute tour. The album's official launch, however, was held in New York City at a club called Tramps; following this, Red Hot Chili Peppers embarked on an introductory European tour which included a free show in Amsterdam's Dam Square that attracted over 10,000 attendees. On September 8, 1989 the band commenced their North American leg in Seattle. The leg saw an overwhelmingly positive response from critics across the country; following a concert in Portland, journalist John Foyston of The Oregonian noted the [...] "Hollywood-based quartet fomented an audience reaction that had to be seen to be believed. The stage-divers started rushing the stage from the moment the band walked on. Once on stage, it was an issue of luck and chutzpah." [...] Todd Caudle of the Colorado Springs newspaper The Gazette said the Chili Peppers' performance at the Colorado Indoor Sports Complex was [...] "the kind of place where kids could be kids, and no one cared if soft drinks stuck to the floor and the rafters <b>shook</b> <b>with</b> a stunning barrage of decibels. People in the audience, steeped in sweat and pressing against the barricade in front of the stage, threw their arms up in unison and barked out approval of one fast, furiously-played song after another." ...|$|E
2500|$|That evening, {{doctors at}} the North Ottawa Hospital in Ottawa, Kansas, amputated Bennett's left leg just above the ankle and his right leg just above the knee. In June 1894, he was fitted with {{artificial}} limbs, but his baseball career was over. [...] In August 1894, a benefit {{to raise money for}} Bennett was held at Boston's South End Grounds; the event included a baseball game between the Boston team and a team of collegiate players as well as foot races and other attractions. [...] The boxing champion Gentleman Jim Corbett attended and briefly played in left field with the Boston team. The benefit was attended by nearly 9,000 people and raised $6,000 for Bennett. [...] Bennett walked to home plate during the event, aided by crutches and artificial limbs, and bowed to the crowd [...] "until the grounds fairly <b>shook</b> <b>with</b> cheers." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} possible {{employment of}} volley fire for firearms occurred in late 14th century China during a military conflict between Ming and Mong Mao forces. Volley fire was also possibly implemented with firearms in 1414 during the Yongle Emperor's campaigns against the Mongols, and possibly again in another expedition in 1422. However {{the language used}} in these sources is unclear {{as to whether or}} not repeating fire was part of the technique implemented. For example, during the 1388 anti-insurrection war waged against the Mong Mao by the Ming general Mu Ying, the Ming troops equipped with guns and fire arrows were arrayed in three lines. The general Mu Ying explained this was so that [...] "when the elephants advance, the front line of guns and arrows will shoot all at once. If they do not retreat, the next line will continue this. If they still do not retreat, then the third line will continue this." [...] When the armored war elephants broke into a run, charging the Ming lines, the Ming forces stood their ground, [...] "shooting arrows and stones, the noise shaking the mountains and vallies. The elephants <b>shook</b> <b>with</b> fear and ran." [...] According to the Ming Shilu, half the elephants were killed while 37 were captured, and of the 100,000 strong insurrection force, at least 30,000 were killed, and 10,000 were captured. Andrade and other historians have interpreted this passage as evidence of volley fire, however he admits that it is ambiguous {{as to whether or not}} the Ming lines practiced repeated fire and reloading, so at best it can only be considered a limited form of volley fire.|$|E

2500|$|Queensland {{political}} scientist Rae Wear described Bjelke-Petersen as an authoritarian who treated democratic values with contempt and was intolerant and resentful of opposition, yet who also demonstrated a down-home charm and old-fashioned courtesies {{as well as}} kindness to colleagues. Those who worked closely with him described him as stubborn with a propensity to fly into rages {{in which he would}} [...] "rant and rave like Adolf Hitler", creating [...] "fantastic performances" [...] as he <b>shook</b> <b>with</b> rage, becoming increasingly incoherent. Many of his National Party colleagues were in terror of him on such occasions. Raised by migrant parents in spartan rural surroundings, he combined a strong work ethic with an ascetic lifestyle that was strongly shaped by his Lutheran upbringing. As a young man Bjelke-Petersen lived alone for 15 years in an old cow bail with a leaky bark roof and only the most basic of facilities. He had a lifelong habit of hard work and long days and while premier often slept for just four hours a night. He valued [...] "the School of Life, the hard knocks of life" [...] more than formal education and showed little respect for academics and universities, although he accepted an honorary doctorate of Laws from Queensland University in May 1985, prompting criticism from both students and staff. Wear dismissed Bjelke-Petersen's claim that he was a reluctant and accidental entrant into state politics, concluding that he [...] "seized opportunity whenever it presented and held tenaciously to power", and was later willing to use any device to remain premier. She said that although Bjelke-Petersen denied ever knowing anything about corruption, [...] "the evidence suggests this is untrue. He ignored it because to acknowledge its presence was to hand a weapon to his political enemies and because he was prepared to trade off corruption for police loyalty".|$|E
2500|$|Late in the {{day they}} heard , the Big Giant, approaching. [...] His {{footsteps}} shook the canyon walls. Then they saw him come to the water's edge and stoop down to drink. He drank deeply four times, until most of the water was gone from the lake. Then he saw {{the reflection of the}} twins in the water, and stood and stared at them. [...] he shouted. The twins did not understand, but answered, [...] Then [...] paced back and forth and said, [...] "What are the two beautiful things that I see, and how shall I kill them?" [...] The twins shouted back, [...] "What beautiful Big Thing is walking about? [...] And how shall we kill it?" [...] , the Wind came to them and whispered in their ear that since Big Giant was their elder he should be given right of first strike, as they were destroying the child of the Sun. Then suddenly , the Wind, called [...] "Akóóh! Beware! Jump!" [...] and suddenly the twins found themselves standing {{on the end of a}} rainbow, just as , the Big Giant, hurled his great black knife at them. The rainbow raised up, and the knife passed just below their feet. [...] , the Wind, whispered [...] "Keep low now!" [...] and [...] hurled his great blue knife. [...] It passed over them. [...] The Wind said, [...] "Jump to the right!" [...] and the great yellow knife of [...] passed just to their left. [...] "This is his last weapon," [...] whispered the Wind. [...] "Jump to the left. Now!" [...] The twins leapt to the left, just as the white knife with many points passed to the right of them." [...] The twins were about to use one of their own weapons when a blinding flash of lightning came out of the sky and struck [...] the Giant on the side of the head. [...] The heavens <b>shook</b> <b>with</b> the thunder, and the Giant shook but stayed on his feet. [...] Then the elder of the two brothers shot a chain-lightning arrow at [...] [...] The Giant dropped to his knee, but stood again. [...] The second brother then shot an arrow of sheet lightning which struck the giant in the chest. [...] He fell to both knees and began to fall forward, catching himself with his hands. [...] Then the first brother shot a deadly sunbeam arrow and hit the Giant in the head. [...] fell face down on the ground. [...] Blood flowed in great streams from the Giant's mouth, and , the Wind said, [...] "Stop the blood before it reaches the water! It will become alive!" [...] The twins ran to block the flow of blood and it remains on the ground today near the spring at the foot of , the Blue Bead Mountain.|$|E
