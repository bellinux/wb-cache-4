5|$|On February 12, 2002, U.S. <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Energy</b> Spencer Abraham {{made the}} {{decision}} that this site was suitable to be the nation's nuclear repository. The governor of Nevada had 90days to object and did so. However, the United States Congress overrode the objection. If the governor's objection had stood the project would have been abandoned and a new site chosen. In August 2004, the repository became an election issue, when Senator John Kerry (D) said that he would abandon the plans if elected.|$|E

The <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Energy,</b> Shirley Abbott (Dianne Wiest), is actively warning various politicians and the president that the power grid is too outdated to handle real natural disasters and that it is too vulnerable to attack. Dan London (Ari Cohen), the chief engineer of Lexer, has also repeatedly warned Lexer that their systems are too vulnerable to hackers, but the company is only interested in going with the cheapest options. He decides to blow the whistle on the company to Harkin, but as he refuses to appear on camera, Harkin's boss will not allow the piece to air.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{strategy}} is to identify the Fiscal Year (FY) 2001 Hanford Site waste reduction, sanitary recycling and affirmative procurement goals and identify the action required {{to ensure that the}} <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Energy's</b> FY 2005 pollution prevention and the FY 2001 Hanford Site goals are met. The strategy and plan to ensure that the <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Energy's</b> routine waste reduction, recycling, cleanup/stabilization waste and affirmative procurement goals are met consists of four phases. The first phase is to ensure that the infrastructure is in place to support planning and organization. This phase involves ensuring that roles and responsibilities are identified; requirement documents are current; goals and successes are communicated; and accurate and current waste information is available. Roles and responsibilities are identified and the RL requirement documents (i. e., the Hanford Site Waste Minimization and Pollution Prevention Awareness Program Plan and Hanford Site Guide for Preparing and Maintaining Generator Group Pollution Prevention Program Documentation) will specify the <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Energy's</b> goals. Goals will be communicated formally and informally via the Hanford Reach, training sessions, meetings and correspondence. Sharing of pollution prevention successes and goal progress are encouraged at the Pollution Prevention/Waste Minimization (PZ/WMin) quarterly meetings. Existing site waste generation databases will be utilized to provide current waste generation data. The second phase of the strategy and plan is to establish and allocate goals by prime contractor (i. e. Fluor Hanford, Inc. (FH), Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Bechtel Hanford Inc. (BHI), and CH 2 MHill Hanford Group (CHG)). This requires determining current status toward meeting the <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Energy's</b> goals; establishing the Hanford Site FY goals, and allocating waste reduction goals by prime contractor. The third phase of the strategy and plan is goal implementation. This phase involves the identification and implementation of corrective actions for problem areas identified either during the development of the Hanford Site goals or during monthly monitoring of the goals. Areas of concern identified during the development of the goals were the Mixed Low Level Waste (MLLW), Hazardous, and cleanup waste goal. The fourth phase of the strategy and plan is measuring results. This phase consists of: Measuring Results; Development of performance measures; and Reporting progress quarterly. The performance measures have been developed for the tracking of the waste reduction, sanitary recycling, affirmative procurement, and toxic chemical release goals. The first quarter performance measures tracking the recommended goals will be issued by January 3 I, 2001...|$|R
