30|$|MWCNTs were {{obtained}} from Hodogaya Chemical Company (MWCNT- 7, lot no. 061220 - 31). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250 – 300  g) were exposed to a MWCNT aerosol (5  mg/m 3) for 5  h. Rats were placed individually in <b>sealed</b> <b>cages</b> which were connected to the main exposure chamber (used as a mixing chamber for this study) through anti-static flexible tubing. Gilian gilair- 5 R basic air sampling pumps (Sensidyne, St. Petersburg, FL 33716 USA) were attached to the <b>sealed</b> <b>cages</b> to pull either aerosol of MWCNTs from the main exposure/mixing chamber or filtered air (control group) into the <b>sealed</b> <b>cage</b> at a flow rate of 1.25  l/min. Particle mass size distribution of MWCNT aerosol in the <b>sealed</b> <b>cage</b> was determined by a cascade impactor (MOUDI, Models 110 and 115, MSP Co., Shoreview, MN). The MWCNT mass concentration was determined by a physical gravimetric analysis with Teflon filters. The aerosol generation system, exposure chamber, and physical characterization of the MWCNT aerosol have been described elsewhere [10, 18, 19]. Using a deposition fraction of 1.5 or 2.7 % and an average minute ventilation of 186  ml/min [5], the total lung burden with our exposure scheme is calculated as 5  mg/m 3 (exposure concentration)[*]×[*]  186  ml/min (minute ventilation)[*]×[*]  10 −[*] 6  m 3 /ml (volume conversion)[*]×[*]  300  min (exposure duration)[*]×[*] 1.5 or 2.7 % (alveolar deposition fraction), which is approximately equal to 4.2 or 7.5  μg MWCNTs in rats. It only takes 14 – 25  days of exposure to reach the same lung burden if a worker exposed to MWCNTs {{at a level of}} 40  μg/m 3, which is a feasible human occupational exposures [19, 20].|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the role of matrix metallo-proteinases (MMPs) in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury induced by hyperoxia. Twenty-three pigs were exposed in <b>sealed</b> <b>cages</b> tow 80 % oxygen (for 24 – 120 h) or room air. Correlation between MMP- 2 /MMP- 9 activity, measured by gelatin zymo-graphy in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and the histological findings and pathological parameters were examined in detail. Sources of these MMPs in the hyperoxic lung were analysed by immunohistochemistry. The histological progression of acute lung injury in this model ranged from the early exudative to the early proliferative phase of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). MMP- 2 and- 9 activities were elevated under prolonged hyperoxic exposure. MMP- 9 activity correlated significantly with the oxygen tension in arterial blood/inspiratory oxygen fraction, the lung wet-to-dry weight ratio, and the number of neutrophils in BALF, whereas MMP- 2 activity did not correlate at all with these factors. MMP- 9 activity correlated more closely with the pathological findings of DAD than did MMP- 2 activity. Strong MMP- 9 expression was observed in neutrophils, alveolar macrophages as well as alveolar lining epithelial cells. These results suggest that matrix metalloproteinase, which may derive from neutrophils recruited into airspaces, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of hyperoxic diffuse alveolar damage...|$|R
40|$|Sieve {{tubes are}} {{transport}} conduits {{not only for}} photoassimilates but also for macromolecules and other compounds {{that are involved in}} sieve tube maintenance and systemic signalling. In order to gain sufficient amounts of pure phloem exudates from barley plants for analyses of the protein and mRNA composition, a previously described stylectomy set-up was optimized. Aphids were placed in <b>sealed</b> <b>cages,</b> which, immediately after microcauterization of the stylets, were flooded with water-saturated silicon oil. The exuding phloem sap was collected with a capillary connected to a pump. Using up to 30 plants and 600 aphids (Rhopalosiphum padi) in parallel, an average of 10 [*]μl of phloem sap could be obtained within 6 [*]h of sampling. In first analyses of the macromolecular content, eight so far unknown phloem mRNAs were identified by cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism. Transcripts in barley phloem exudates are related to metabolism, signalling, and pathogen defence, for example coding for a protein kinase and a pathogen- and insect-responsive WIR 1 A (wheat-induced resistance 1 A) -like protein. Further, one-dimensional gel electrophoresis and subsequent partial sequencing by mass spectrometry led to the identification of seven major proteins with putative functions in stress responses and transport of mRNAs, proteins, and sugars. Two of the discovered proteins probably represent isoforms of a new phloem-mobile sucrose transporter. Notably, two-dimensional electrophoresis confirmed that there are > 250 phloem proteins awaiting identification in future studies...|$|R
50|$|Most {{chastity}} cages {{are intended}} for long-term wear and may include a lock with keys retained by a key-holder, or a plastic locking device which incorporates an identity number so that the wearer may be locked by a remote key-holder. When combined with such a tamper-evident plastic <b>seal,</b> plastic chastity <b>cages</b> permit easier access through airport security or other security restricted areas that require passage through metal detectors.|$|R

One of the {{efficient}} effortsto fulfill the needs is broiler farming business. Besides getting the expected results in the cage at the farm there are some bacteria such as Salmonella pullorum and Escherichia colithatcause diseasesin poultry which make economically lossesand are zoonotic. This study aimed {{to determine the effects}} of temperature, humidity and sanitation to the presence of bacteria Salmonella pullorum and Escherichia coli in the broiler farm. This research used True Experimental Research with research design of post-test only control group design. Samples were taken from the water jars in the treated cage and control cage. The results showed that after treated with opened lid cage within 6, 7, 8 hours and <b>sealed</b> <b>cage</b> there was only one positive sample bacterium Escherichia coli found in the 5 th of repetition. Based on the data normality test using Shapiro Wilk temperature and humidity had a p-value> 0. 05, it indicates that the data was normally distributed. Based on One Way Annova test for the temperature in the cage a significant value of 1, 000 was obtained, which means no effect of temperature on the presence of bacteria Escherichia coli and Salmonella pullorum and for humidity the significance values was 0, 990, means there was no influence of humidity on the presence of bacteria Salmonella pullorum and Escherichia coli. It can be concluded that the temperature and humidity in this study had no effect on the presence of the Escherichia coli and Salmonella pullorum bacteria on treated cage as well as in the control cage, so that the cage conditions are assumed to be healthy cage...|$|R

Enamored with the archangel, Rowena offers herself to join him, only to get herself killed once Lucifer confirms that she is the only one capable of <b>sealing</b> the <b>Cage.</b> Thanks to a spell she placed on her body, she is resurrected and vows to take revenge against Lucifer by teaming up with the Darkness, whose vessel she restores. Fearing for her power, Rowena bows out of the deal soon after and joins the Winchesters, Lucifer, Crowley and God in combating the Darkness. In season 12, Rowena is asked by Crowley for help in finding Lucifer, who was incapacitated by the Darkness earlier and now possesses a rockstar’s body.

5000|$|Alastair (Andrew Wheeler, with Christopher Heyerdahl soon {{taking over}} the role) returns in [...] "Death Takes a Holiday", seeking to kill reapers to break another <b>seal</b> to Lucifer's <b>cage.</b> Though Alastair {{utilizes}} spell-work to prevent angels from actively interfering with his task, he is stopped by the Winchesters and captured by Castiel. Dean tortures him on Castiel and Uriel's orders in the following episode for information about a string of angel murders, but the demon refuses to disclose any information on that and instead reveals that Dean torturing souls in Hell broke the first seal. Alastair is eventually set free of his bonds by an unseen force and seizes the opportunity to attack Dean and Castiel, but is incapacitated and tortured by Sam, who forces him to admit that demons {{are not involved in}} the angel murders. When Alastair dares Sam to exorcise him, Sam uses his growing powers to kill the demon instead. It is later revealed that Uriel had freed Alastair; the one who has been killing angels, he had released Alastair in the hopes that the demon would kill Dean, and that demons would remain the suspects for the angel murders.|$|R
25|$|The {{energy of}} the nuclear {{explosion}} is released in one microsecond. In the following few microseconds, the test hardware and surrounding rock are vaporised, with temperatures of several million degrees and pressures of several million atmospheres. Within milliseconds, a bubble of high-pressure gas and steam is formed. The heat and expanding shock wave cause the surrounding rock to vaporise, or be melted further away, creating a melt cavity. The shock-induced motion and high internal pressure cause this cavity to expand outwards, which continues over several tenths of a second until the pressure has fallen sufficiently, to a level roughly comparable {{with the weight of}} the rock above, and can no longer grow. Although not observed in every explosion, four distinct zones (including the melt cavity) have been described in the surrounding rock. The crushed zone, about two times the radius of the cavity, consists of rock that has lost all of its former integrity. The cracked zone, about three times the cavity radius, consists of rock with radial and concentric fissures. Finally, the zone of irreversible strain consists of rock deformed by the pressure. The following layer undergoes only an elastic deformation; the strain and subsequent release then forms a seismic wave. A few seconds later the molten rock starts collecting {{on the bottom of the}} cavity and the cavity content begins cooling. The rebound after the shock wave causes compressive forces to build up around the cavity, called a stress containment <b>cage,</b> <b>sealing</b> the cracks.|$|R
