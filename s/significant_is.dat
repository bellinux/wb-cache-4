5|$|Erie is home {{to several}} {{professional}} and amateur performing-arts groups. The most <b>significant</b> <b>is</b> the Erie Philharmonic, in continuous existence since 1913 (with the exception of an interregnum during World War II). This group of professional musicians also has a full chorus and a Junior Philharmonic division that tours the area. The Lake Erie Ballet is a professional company that performs well-known programs throughout the year. The Erie Civic Music Association attracts, sponsors, and books performances by professional musicians, singers, entertainers, and ensembles from around the world.|$|E
5|$|The {{second reason}} the {{district}} is <b>significant</b> <b>is</b> its collection of buildings and their architectural styles (Criterion C). Most of these buildings were constructed during the Indiana Gas Boom in the late 19th century or early 20th century, and have many of their original features. Three styles of architecture, Italianate, Renaissance Revival, and Romanesque Revival are all well represented, and additional styles can also be found.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} listed {{buildings}} {{are located in}} and around the town centre. Arguably the most <b>significant</b> <b>is</b> Crow Hall, a Grade II* listed building, is an early 18th-century sandstone and ashlar, one-room deep building at Crowhall Lane. The adjacent Crow Hall Cottage and gate piers are Grade II listed buildings. At Victoria Terrace stands Felling post office; a two-story course sandstone building with quoins and a Welsh slate roof. Close by is the Imperial Bingo Club, built as a dance hall in 1927 and converted to a bingo hall in 1930, at Victoria Square. Both are Grade II listed buildings. Also a Grade II listed building is Ardallan; the first house built at Holly-Hill field in Felling constructed of sandstone and with three sash windows. The gates, gate piers and walls are also Grade II listed. Almost immediately next door stands a house and shop at 35 Davison Street; another Grade II listed building.|$|E

30|$|Thereby, if {{the test}} <b>was</b> <b>significant,</b> there <b>was</b> a linear {{dependence}} between {{the dependent variable}} and the independent ones selected. Therefore, all independent variables, for which the test <b>was</b> not <b>significant,</b> <b>were</b> removed. The Fisher test was then applied which allows to check {{if the number of}} independent variables is sufficient to describe the dependent variable.|$|R
5|$|The Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) {{restricts the}} use of Highway 82 through the pass. Most <b>significant</b> <b>is</b> the winter closure. The road is {{typically}} closed after the first significant winter snowfall, or by November 7 at the latest (but there have been exceptions.). CDOT tries to reopen just before Memorial Day weekend in late May, the traditional beginning of summer in the United States, when enough of the accumulated snowpack has melted {{to make it possible}} to clear and repair the road. Some years, after light winters, the pass has reopened as early as May 12. Two gates, just east of Aspen on the west end and west of the remaining buildings of the stage stop of Everett on the east, prevent motor vehicles from passage. When the road is closed, Aspen is isolated from the east and Highway 82 up the valley from Glenwood Springs becomes the only vehicular access to the city during its busy ski season.|$|E
25|$|Also <b>significant</b> <b>is</b> {{that the}} Wanister Bog, {{an area of}} seasonally-flooded wetland on the {{south-east}} side of the fell, is the only valley-mire in lowland County Durham.|$|E
25|$|The {{working of}} coal in Wales' various coalfields {{began in earnest}} with the {{initiation}} of the Industrial Revolution. Easily the most <b>significant</b> <b>is</b> the South Wales Coalfield though the contiguous Flintshire and Denbighshire Coalfields were of importance to the economy of northeast Wales. A rather smaller coalfield was worked in Pembrokeshire and a tiny one in Anglesey.|$|E

25|$|In the April 1957 West Freugh {{incident}} in Scotland, {{named after the}} principal military base involved, two unidentified objects flying high over the UK were tracked by radar operators. The objects were reported to operate at speeds and perform maneuvers beyond the capability of any known craft. Also <b>significant</b> <b>is</b> their alleged size, which– based on the radar returns – was closer {{to that of a}} ship than an aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Bexley {{has been}} the home of many {{prominent}} citizens, including {{the former governor of}} Ohio, Ted Strickland, U.S. Senator George Voinovich, Bob Greene—the former Chicago Tribune columnist who wrote Be True to Your School, children's author R. L. Stine, cartoonist Paul Palnik, and Limited Brands founder Leslie Wexner. Also <b>significant</b> <b>is</b> amateur meteorologist William Jefferson Hoyer, founder of Lakeside, Ohio and Michael Jeffries, Former Chief Executive Officer of Abercrombie & Fitch.|$|E
25|$|Belize's social {{structure}} {{is marked by}} enduring differences {{in the distribution of}} wealth, power, and prestige. Because of the small size of Belize's population and the intimate scale of social relations, the social distance between the rich and the poor, while <b>significant,</b> <b>is</b> nowhere as vast as in other Caribbean and Central American societies, such as Jamaica and El Salvador. Belize lacks the violent class and racial conflict that has figured so prominently in the social life of its Central American neighbours.|$|E

25|$|The Agua Fria River and New River are {{the only}} rivers that flow through Peoria. The Agua Fria River is usually dry due to the New Waddell Dam that holds back Lake Pleasant in the {{northern}} end of the city. The New River is usually dry due to flood control measures and New River Dam. There are multiple washes and creeks that flow through the city as well, one of the most <b>significant</b> <b>is</b> the Skunk Creek due to its trails and connectivity with nearby Glendale.|$|E
25|$|Of course, brutal scenes – witness The Massacre of the Innocents – {{have been}} {{important}} and regularly visited motifs {{in the history of}} art. What makes Helnwein's art <b>significant</b> <b>is</b> its ability to make us reflect emotionally and intellectually on the very expressive subjects he chooses. Many people feel that museums should be a refuge in which to experience quiet beauty divorced from the coarseness of the world. This notion sells short the purposes of art, the function of museums, and the intellectual curiosity of the public.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{evidence}} of conflict between Ertebølle settlements: an arrowhead in a pelvis at Skateholm, Sweden; a bone point in a throat at Vedbæk, Zealand; a bone point in the chest at Stora Biers, Sweden. More <b>significant</b> <b>is</b> evidence of cannibalism at Dyrholmen, Jutland, and Møllegabet on Ærø. There human bones were broken open to obtain the marrow. As cannibalism is not practiced to obtain food, the next most likely {{explanation is that the}} warlike Ertebølle population ritually devoured its enemies in order to ingest their powers.|$|E

25|$|Given {{the date}} of {{erection}} (earlier than for most other public schools built on the Island) Ponce High School emerges, {{as one of the}} earlier American government-sponsored construction efforts at such a large scale on the Island. Strikingly <b>significant</b> <b>is</b> the fact that with the choice of building vocabulary (strongly reminiscent of Mc Kim, Mead & White's Pennsylvania Station in New York) the use of the neoclassical style for educational structures was introduced in Puerto Rico. Ponce High School is today one of the most dignified and imposing structures in the city, a fact underlined by its architectural style, scale and overall architectural merits.|$|E
25|$|The {{second reason}} Hacienda Buena Vista is <b>significant</b> <b>is</b> that it offers {{one of the}} best {{remaining}} examples of a Puerto Rican coffee plantation. This is important because {{in the latter part of}} the nineteenth century the coffee produced in Puerto Rico and exported to Europe and the United States was considered among the finest in the world. It is said to have even been the favorite at the Vatican at the time. Hacienda Buena Vista is also significant because it shows the evolution of the coffee industry in the region. Various periods can be appreciated. These range from the cultivation of produce such as plantains (1833–1845); to the production of flour (from rice and corn) (1847–1872). These products were staples for the subsistence of the local population.|$|E
25|$|Methane is nontoxic, {{yet it is}} {{extremely}} flammable and may form explosive mixtures with air. Methane is violently reactive with oxidizers, halogen, and some halogen-containing compounds. Methane is also an asphyxiant and may displace oxygen in an enclosed space. Asphyxia may result if the oxygen concentration is reduced to below about 16% by displacement, as most people can tolerate a reduction from 21% to 16% without ill effects. The concentration of methane at which asphyxiation risk becomes <b>significant</b> <b>is</b> {{much higher than the}} 5–15% concentration in a flammable or explosive mixture. Methane off-gas can penetrate the interiors of buildings near landfills and expose occupants to significant levels of methane. Some buildings have specially engineered recovery systems below their basements to actively capture this gas and vent it away from the building.|$|E

25|$|How the {{infinite}} variety {{of plant leaves}} is generated is a subject of intense research. Some common themes have emerged. One of the most <b>significant</b> <b>is</b> the involvement of KNOX genes in generating compound leaves, as in tomato (see above). But this again is not universal. For example, pea uses a different mechanism for doing the same thing. Mutations in genes affecting leaf curvature can also change leaf form, by changing the leaf from flat, to a crinky shape, like the shape of cabbage leaves. There also exist different morphogen gradients in a developing leaf which define the leaf's axis. Changes in these morphogen gradients may also affect the leaf form. Another very important class of regulators of leaf development are the microRNAs, whose role in this process has just begun to be documented. The coming years should see a rapid development in comparative studies on leaf development, with many EST sequences {{involved in the process}} coming online.|$|E
25|$|Recall {{memory is}} linked with {{instincts}} and mechanisms {{in order to}} remember how an event happened to learn from it or avoid the agitator, connections are made with emotions. For instance, if a speaker is very calm and neutral, the effectiveness of encoding memory is very low and listeners get the gist of what the speaker is discussing. On the other hand, if a speaker is shouting and/or using emotionally driven words, listeners tend to remember key phrases {{and the meaning of}} the speech. This is full access of the fight or flight mechanism all people have functioning in the brain, but based on what triggers this mechanism will lead to better recall of it. People tend to focus their attention on cues that are loud, very soft, or something unusual. This makes the auditory system pick up the differences in regular speaking and meaningful speech, when something <b>significant</b> <b>is</b> spoken in the discussion people home in on the message at that part of the speech but tend to lose {{the other part of the}} discussion. Our brains sense differences in speech and when those differences occur the brain encodes that part of speech into memory and the information can be recalled for future reference.|$|E
25|$|Today the IWW {{still exists}} in Australia, in larger numbers than the 1940s, {{but due to}} the nature of the Australian {{industrial}} relations system, it is unlikely to win union representation in any workplaces in the immediate future. More <b>significant</b> <b>is</b> its continuing place in the mythology of the militant end of the Australian labour movement. As an extreme example of the integration of ex-IWW militants into the mainstream labour movement one might instance the career of Donald Grant, one of the Sydney Twelve sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment for conspiracy to commit arson and other crimes. Released unbowed from prison in August 1920 he would soon break with the IWW over its anti-political stand, standing for the NSW Parliament for the Industrial Socialist Labour Party unsuccessfully in 1922 and then in 1925 for the mainstream Australian Labor Party (ALP) also unsuccessfully. However, this reconciliation with the ALP and the electoral system did not prevent him being imprisoned again in 1927 for street demonstrations supporting Sacco and Vanzetti. He would eventually represent the ALP in the NSW Legislative Council in 1931–1940 and the Australian Senate 1943–1956. No other member of the Australian IWW actually entered Parliament but Grant's career is emblematic in the sense that the ex-IWW militants by and large remained in the broader labour movement, bringing some greater or lesser part of their heritage with them.|$|E
