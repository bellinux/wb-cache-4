5|$|Darla {{appears in}} twenty Angel episodes, mainly as an evil antagonist. The {{character}} {{is known for}} dying {{the most in the}} Buffy The Vampire Slayer franchise. Benz later emphasized: I just didn't know how it was going to happen. So when they sent me the script —which I basically had to sign my life away to read—I was <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> trailer and I just started to cry. I thought it was such a beautiful ending, it was the payoff and just really brought her whole life kind of to that one moment. So I was really upset my last day of filming because I really thought it was over to me.|$|E
500|$|Folklorists Iona and Peter Opie {{point out}} in The Classic Fairy Tales (1999) that the tale has a [...] "partial analogue" [...] in [...] "Snow White": the lost princess enters the dwarfs' house, tastes their food, and falls asleep {{in one of their}} beds. In a manner similar to the three bears, the dwarfs cry, [...] "Someone's been <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> chair!", [...] "Someone's been eating off my plate!", and [...] "Someone's been {{sleeping}} in my bed!" [...] The Opies also point to similarities in a Norwegian tale about a princess who takes refuge in a cave inhabited by three Russian princes dressed in bearskins. She eats their food and hides under a bed.|$|E
500|$|Larter {{promotes}} natural beauty. At the 2007 Emmy Awards, Larter styled her {{own hair}} {{as opposed to}} using her hair-styling team. This {{was part of the}} Dove Hair's [...] "Real Beauty" [...] challenge which required her to use Dove's new moisturizing shampoos, conditioners and treatments. She also states that she refuses to conform to the idea of the perfect Hollywood body. In an interview with Allure, Larter revealed she once was asked by producers, by faxes sent out to her agent and manager, to lose weight. [...] "I just remember <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> trailer hysterically crying from the embarrassment I felt about myself, my body – and that no one could talk to me directly." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't be stu-stu-stupid," [...] gasped Mrs. Hatchard. [...] "He--he's <b>sitting</b> downstairs <b>in</b> <b>my</b> {{room with}} a paper cap {{on his head and}} a fire-shovel in his hand, and he--he says he's the--the Emperor of China." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{thought of}} her <b>sitting</b> there. <b>In</b> <b>my</b> mind I saw the beautiful, soft brown eyes, the red lips; her mouth was exquisite, very delicately shaped, with {{wonderful}} curves. It was for such a mouth as hers that the simile of Cupid's bow had been invented.|$|R
500|$|Lowell {{returned}} to the United States and began his duties at Harvard {{in the summer of}} 1856. Still grieving the loss of his wife, however, he avoided Elmwood, lodging instead in an area known as Professors' Row on Kirkland Street in Cambridge along with his daughter Mabel and her governess Frances Dunlap. Lowell and Dunlap married in 1857. After the death of Lowell's father in January 1861 due to a heart attack, he moved back to Elmwood with his family. Despite avoiding the home for so long, he was pleased to be back. He wrote to his friend Charles Frederick Briggs: [...] "I am back again to the place I love best. I am <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> old garret, at my old desk, smoking my old pipe... I begin to feel more like my old self than I have these ten years". However, Elmwood's expenses drained him, with taxes at $1,000 a year. As early as 1867, he considered renting out Elmwood and moving into a smaller home elsewhere but never did. Instead, to ease his financial plight, he began to sell off land in 1870 until only two and a half acres remained.|$|E
500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1857, The Atlantic Monthly was established, and Lowell was its first editor. With its first issue in November of that year, he at once gave the {{magazine}} the stamp of high literature and of bold speech on public affairs. In January 1861, Lowell's father {{died of a heart}} attack, inspiring Lowell to move his family back to Elmwood. As he wrote to his friend Briggs, [...] "I am back again to the place I love best. I am <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> old garret, at my old desk, smoking my old pipe... I begin to feel more like my old self than I have these ten years." [...] Shortly thereafter, in May, he left The Atlantic Monthly when James Thomas Fields took over as editor; the magazine had been purchased by Ticknor and Fields for $10,000 two years before. Lowell returned to Elmwood by January 1861 but maintained an amicable relationship with the new owners of the journal, continuing to submit his poetry and prose {{for the rest of his}} life. His prose, however, was more abundantly presented in the pages of the North American Review during the years 1862–1872. For the Review, he served as a coeditor along with Charles Eliot Norton. Lowell's reviews for the journal covered a wide variety of literary releases of the day, though he was writing fewer poems.|$|E
2500|$|The music {{came from}} Brian Wilson's first {{psychedelic}} experience. He was quoted saying in 1986, [...] " [...] something I'm {{very proud of}} in a sense because it represents the Beach Boys really greatest record production we’ve ever made. It goes back to 1965 when I was <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> apartment, wondering {{how to write a}} song about girls, because I love girls. I mean, everybody loves girls." [...] He added in 2007, [...] "I was thinking about the music from cowboy movies. And I sat down and started playing it, bum-buhdeeda, bum-buhdeeda. I did that for about an hour. I got these chords going. Then I got this melody, it came pretty fast after that." [...] Inspiration came from the rhythm of [...] "Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring". In 2015, he explained: [...] "'California Girls' had that beat — it's called a shuffle beat — and that's definitely a Bach influence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{appeal to}} your friends," [...] he said, [...] "they will, perhaps, not mind <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> {{judgement}} on <b>my</b> case. By the way, {{you have not}} introduced me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What! Punished {{for being}} ill!" [...] I exclaimed, <b>sitting</b> bolt upright <b>in</b> <b>my</b> bed. [...] "What do you mean, Edra? I never heard such {{outrageous}} nonsense <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life!" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{came to me}} unexpectedly. I had {{returned}} to town that evening, and next morning as I was <b>sitting</b> down <b>in</b> <b>my</b> study to answer some unimportant questions Maxwell Hartington had sent me, my parlormaid appeared. [...] "Can you speak," [...] she asked, [...] "to Lady Mary Justin?" ...|$|R
2500|$|On June 25, 2009, American {{recording}} artist, Michael Jackson, {{died from}} cardiac arrest {{at the age}} of 50, later revealed to be from a drug intoxication of the anesthetic drug Propofol (also known as [...] "Diprivan"). Jackson was friends with musicians Chris Brown, Diddy, Boyz II Men and The Game. Aside from being friends with some of the musicians involved on the song, others involved had also respected and admired Jackson. According to The Game, prior to Jackson's death Jackson, Diddy and Eminem had tried to end the feuding and tension between rapper 50 Cent and The Game in 2005. The Game stated that in 2005, Jackson called him and offered to help end the feud, remembering [...] "I was on tour in Canada, <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> room, cutting my hair [...] I was messing my hair up. Then my road manager knocks on my door. Boom, boom, boom. He told me, I got MJ on the phone. I ran and snatched up the phone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scorpion yells {{one of two}} taunts at {{his opponents}} when he hits them with his spear. They were voiced by Boon in the games (up until Mortal Kombat X) and both feature films, but {{only one of them}} ("Come here!") was {{included}} in the home ports of MK and MKII due to memory constraints. According to Boon, the second of the character's phrases originated because he thought [...] "it would be funny to have him yell out 'Get over here!' when he ," [...] and he was thus encouraged to get behind the studio microphone and record the taunts. Twenty years after the first MK game's release, Boon included creating the spear move as well as the character itself among his personal high points of the franchise's history, adding: [...] "I remember people <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> office all day just doing this uppercut [...] again and again, like 'Oh my God, that feels so good.' It just became the cornerstone of [...]" [...] MKII saw the debut of the popular phrase [...] "Toasty!", which was voiced by series sound designer Dan Forden during a variation of Scorpion's [...] "Flaming Skull" [...] Fatality or at random when any of the game's characters landed an uppercut. According to Tobias, it first originated as [...] "You're Toast!", which was a taunt bandied among the designers during game-testing sessions.|$|E

60|$|It was {{a strange}} {{condition}} of things, the honeymoon being over, and the bridesmaids gone home, when I found myself <b>sitting</b> down <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own small house with Dora; quite thrown out of employment, as I may say, in respect of the delicious old occupation of making love.|$|R
6000|$|Early in July--the 9th or 10th of the month, I think--I was <b>sitting</b> alone <b>in</b> <b>my</b> gallery, looking ruefully {{enough at}} the last two sovereigns <b>in</b> <b>my</b> purse, when a gentleman was {{announced}} who wanted a lesson. [...] "A private lesson," [...] he said, with emphasis, looking {{at the man who}} cleaned and took care of my weapons.|$|R
60|$|His coming was so unexpected. I was <b>sitting</b> alone <b>in</b> <b>my</b> room this afternoon--I believe I was moping--when Bessie {{brought up}} his card. I gave it one rapturous look and tore downstairs, passing Alicia {{in the hall}} like a whirlwind, and burst into the drawing-room in a most undignified way.|$|R

6000|$|... "And {{then came}} the missionary. That missionary! What a Guy! Gummy! It was in the afternoon, and I was <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> state <b>in</b> <b>my</b> outer temple place, sitting on that old black stone of theirs, when he came. I heard a row outside and jabbering, and then his voice {{speaking}} to an interpreter. 'They worship stocks and stones,' he said, and I knew what was up, in a flash. I had one of my windows out for comfort, and I sang out straight away {{on the spur of}} the moment. 'Stocks and stones!' I says. 'You come inside,' I says, 'and I'll punch your blooming Exeter Hall of a head.' ...|$|R
6000|$|I took it up {{and glanced}} at it. [...] "Mr. Victor Hatherley, {{hydraulic}} engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor)." [...] That was the name, style, and abode of my morning visitor.

6000|$|I've been <b>sitting</b> here <b>in</b> <b>my</b> bedroom {{writing to}} you ever since, till my candle's almost gone.

The night is so quiet--I haven't heard a sound; is she asleep, awake, crying, triumphant? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And here I am. Cheer up, George! Whatever is the matter? I've been <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> room {{looking at}} you, {{and you have}} been simply prowling. What has gone wrong?" ...|$|E

60|$|To-night I {{have had}} another shock! I was <b>sitting</b> alone <b>in</b> <b>my</b> room down-stairs, dreaming over the fire, when a {{footstep}} sounded upon the stairs. At first I {{thought that it}} might be Paul, and I sprang up, and stood listening intently. What a little fool I was! I felt the colour burning <b>in</b> <b>my</b> cheeks, and my heart was beating. I listened to the tread, and the madness passed away. It was a man's footsteps, but not Paul's.|$|R
6000|$|... "Last night I was <b>sitting</b> here <b>in</b> <b>my</b> room {{at eleven}} o'clock {{writing a letter}} to Shirley. Every one else was in bed, except father, who was out.

60|$|MY DEAR MOTHER,--I am here at last, <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> room, without coat or waistcoat, {{and with}} both window and door open, and yet perspiring like a terra-cotta jug or a Gruyère cheese.|$|E
60|$|There {{were four}} of us—George, and William Samuel Harris, and myself, and Montmorency. We were <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> room, smoking, {{and talking about}} how bad we were—bad from a medical point of view I mean, of course.|$|E
60|$|And then I {{awoke to}} reality, and found I had been <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> chair longer than I had intended. The band-stand was empty, {{the sun had}} set; I rose and made my way home through the {{scattered}} crowd.|$|E
60|$|They both {{hurried to}} my side. I was <b>sitting</b> up <b>in</b> <b>my</b> chair, pointing, my eyes fixed with surprise. I {{do not know}} even now why the {{incident}} should so much have alarmed me, {{but it is a}} fact that for the moment I was palsied with fear. There had been murder in the man's eyes, loathsome things in his white unkempt face. My tongue clove to the roof of my mouth. They gave me more brandy, and then I spoke.|$|R
5000|$|I {{had come}} back to New York, and I was staying <b>in</b> <b>my</b> old room at my parents' house. Artie was living at his parents' house, too.
