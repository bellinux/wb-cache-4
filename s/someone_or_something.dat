5|$|Varno said he {{received}} uncredited assistance from {{his friends and}} fellow screenwriters Jerome Bixby and Harold Jacob Smith, the latter of whom won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for the film The Defiant Ones (1958). Varno ran lines and ideas by both men and sought advice. Smith in particular inspired lines for the speech made by the monster {{at the end of}} the film, in which the creature discusses how the human characters consider him the embodiment of evil simply because he is different from them. Varno said much of that dialogue from Smith, however, ended up getting cut from the final film. One of the primary themes of the film, as embodied in John Corcoran's attempts to defend the alien creature, was that simply because <b>someone</b> <b>or</b> <b>something</b> is ugly or different does not necessarily make it evil. However, the script also followed a common trait of most horror films of the 1950s that even somewhat understandable monsters are not entirely sympathetic, and the Blood Beast creature proves itself evil by impregnating Corcoran against his will and pursuing world domination.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1969 novel Slaughterhouse-Five, Kurt Vonnegut {{used the}} phrase [...] "So it goes" [...] as a {{transitional}} phrase to another subject, as a reminder, and as comic relief. Generally the phrase was used after every time <b>someone's</b> (<b>or</b> <b>something's)</b> death is described or mentioned in the novel.|$|R

50|$|The genetic fallacy (also {{known as}} the fallacy of origins or fallacy of virtue) is a fallacy of {{irrelevance}} where a conclusion is suggested based solely on <b>someone's</b> <b>or</b> <b>something's</b> history, origin, <b>or</b> source rather than its current meaning or context. This overlooks any difference {{to be found in}} the present situation, typically transferring the positive or negative esteem from the earlier context.|$|R
50|$|Jah Hut {{varies from}} other Mon-Khmer {{languages}} {{in that it}} contains little-to-no phonetic vowel length. It also uses Causative prefixes that are composed by p- or -r-. By using this, the speaker is able to indicate that a specific <b>something</b> <b>or</b> <b>someone</b> causes <b>something</b> <b>or</b> <b>someone</b> to be <b>or</b> do <b>something</b> else.|$|R
25|$|Grief is a {{multifaceted}} response to loss, {{particularly to the}} loss of <b>someone</b> <b>or</b> <b>something</b> that has died, to which a bond or affection was formed. Although conventionally focused on the emotional response to loss, it also has physical, cognitive, behavioral, social, cultural, and philosophical dimensions. While the terms are often used interchangeably, bereavement refers to the state of loss, and grief is the reaction to that loss.|$|E
25|$|In {{the basic}} {{assumption}} of fight-flight, the group behaves {{as though it}} has met to preserve itself at all costs, and that this can only be done by running away from someone or fighting <b>someone</b> <b>or</b> <b>something.</b> In fight, the group may be characterized by aggressiveness and hostility; in flight, the group may chit-chat, tell stories, arrive late or any other activities that serve to avoid addressing the task at hand. The leader {{for this sort of}} group is one who can mobilize the group for attack, or lead it in flight.|$|E
25|$|Forgiveness in Hinduism {{does not}} {{necessarily}} require that one reconcile with the offender, nor does it rule out reconciliation in some situations. Instead forgiveness in Hindu philosophy is being compassionate, tender, kind and {{letting go of the}} harm or hurt caused by <b>someone</b> <b>or</b> <b>something</b> else. Forgiveness is essential for one to free oneself from negative thoughts, and being able to focus on blissfully living a moral and ethical life (dharmic life). In the highest self-realized state, forgiveness becomes essence of one's personality, where the persecuted person remains unaffected, without agitation, without feeling like a victim, free from anger (akrodhi).|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} paper the notion divination is used not only for making {{statements}} about <b>someone's</b> <b>or</b> <b>something's</b> future, but for obtaining any information by the means of or through supernatural sphere. Motif is a cultural category of classification for associating mentally hindered sections in sequenced actions, operations, situations and phenomena. The putative motifs of divination are observed in regilaul (folk song in Kalevala metre) in the religious context of North Eurasian peoples...|$|R
5000|$|The main {{characters}} {{of this book}} are three Lymen siblings: Ayna, Ceri and Gair. Both Ayna and Ceri are blessed with [...] "Gifts". Ayna can tell the future, and Ceri can find anything that has been lost and can put thoughts on people. Putting thoughts on people is like controlling <b>someone</b> <b>or</b> <b>something's</b> actions by putting a hex on it. Gair is supposedly without a Gift but later on is revealed to have one.|$|R
50|$|According to practises in folklore, {{knowledge}} of a true name allows one to affect another person or being magically. It is stated that knowing <b>someone's,</b> <b>or</b> <b>something's,</b> true name therefore gives the person (who knows the true name) power over them. This effect is used in many tales, {{such as in the}} German fairytale of Rumpelstiltskin: within Rumpelstiltskin and all its variants, the girl can free herself from the power of a supernatural helper who demands her child by learning its name.|$|R
25|$|Even {{though the}} Greek text is legible {{on the whole}} (see {{transcription}} on the right), much of it remains incomprehensible due to grammatical and syntactical peculiarities, such as they were frequent in magical amulets, and some letter sequences cannot be made any sense of. Nonetheless, one can infer from the intelligible parts that the god Phoebus Apollo is being invoked {{in order to raise}} his arms against <b>someone</b> <b>or</b> <b>something,</b> probably to the advantage of the amulet owner. The wording does not correspond to any other ancient epigraphic and literary texts, providing further evidence that the gold foil is genuine and not a modern forgery.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{things can}} be causes of one another, causing each other reciprocally, as hard work causes fitness and vice versa, {{although}} {{not in the same}} way or function, the one is as the beginning of change, the other as the goal. (Thus Aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect.) Moreover, Aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects; its presence and absence may result in different outcomes. Simply it is the goal or purpose that brings about an event. Our two dominoes require <b>someone</b> <b>or</b> <b>something</b> to intentionally knock over the first domino, because it cannot fall of its own accord.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{the harp}} was {{frequently}} seen surmounted by a crown. In this case, the depiction is as heraldic badge, a device used to indicate allegiance to or {{the property of}} <b>someone</b> <b>or</b> <b>something.</b> Elizabeth I used the badge as her second Great Seal of 1586. This motif had earlier featured of the coins of the Lordship of Ireland during the Tudor period and continued to be used on the coins of the Kingdom of Ireland. Following {{the creation of the}} United Kingdom, the device was used on the cap badges of the Royal Irish Constabulary and later the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The badge can be seen today on the cap badge of the Royal Irish Regiment of the British Army. The harp, unsurmounted by a crown, is used as a badge in the Republic of Ireland today, but the harp surmounted by a crown is also found (e.g. in 'colours' ties of Trinity College sports teams).|$|E

500|$|The verb to pluto (preterite {{and past}} participle: plutoed) was coined in the {{aftermath}} of the 2006 IAU decision. In January 2007, the American Dialect Society chose plutoed as its 2006 Word of the Year, defining to pluto as [...] "to demote or devalue <b>someone</b> <b>or</b> <b>something,</b> as happened to the former planet Pluto when the General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union decided Pluto no longer met its definition of a planet." ...|$|E

Themes explored on the album included the brothers' experiences, Darrell commented, [...] "the crumbling of one empire and then starting over...

[...] This is exemplified in the songs [...] "Reborn", [...] "Wake up", and [...] "Breathing New Life". [...] "Blunt Force Trauma" [...] is about when <b>someone</b> <b>or</b> <b>something</b> comes up behind you when you least expect it, [...] "it could be a situation in your life, it could be a person you know with a beer bottle".|$|E

50|$|More generally, {{a pillow}} {{book is a}} {{collection}} of notebooks or notes which have been collated to show a period of <b>someone</b> <b>or</b> <b>something's</b> life. In Japan such kind of idle notes are generally referred to as the zuihitsu genre. Other major works from the same period include Kamo no Chōmei's Hōjōki and Yoshida Kenkō’s Tsurezuregusa. Zuihitsu rose to mainstream popularity in the Edo period, when it found a wide audience in the newly developed merchant classes. Furthermore, it gained a scholarly foothold, as Japanese classical scholars began customarily writing in the zuihitsu style. Reputable authors from this movement include Motoori Norinaga, Yokoi Yayu, and Matsudaira Sadanobu.|$|R

500|$|Martin has explained, [...] "'Yellow' {{refers to}} {{the mood of the}} band. Brightness and hope and devotion." [...] The {{references}} in some of the lyrics, including swimming and drawing a line, [...] "are all metaphorical slants on the extent of his emotional devotion". The drawing of a line refers to Martin's habit of writing lists, and underlining those important things on the list. Martin has commented that the song is about devotion, referring to his unrequited love for <b>someone</b> <b>or</b> <b>something.</b> Despite its lyrical theme, many fans have considered [...] "Yellow" [...] to be an upbeat track, although it is often interpreted as melancholy as well. The song is written in the key of B major with a tempo of 88 beats per minute.|$|E
500|$|The actor {{was more}} {{successful}} in 2006 with his role opposite Jamie Foxx in Michael Mann's action crime drama, Miami Vice. The film grossed $164million worldwide on a budget of $135million, and TimeOut New York ranked it among the top 50 movies of the decade. (The DVD, released the same year, also managed to sell over a million copies (equivalent to $7.91 million in pirated versions) in its first week alone., and, as of 11 February 2007, had grossed over $36.45million in rentals. A. O. Scott criticised Farrell's work: [...] "When he's not on screen, you don't miss him, and when he is, you find yourself, before long, looking at <b>someone</b> <b>or</b> <b>something</b> else." [...] Conversely, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was enthusiastic. The actor also reportedly took a slight pay cut to make friend and recent Oscar winner Jamie Foxx happy: His salary was initially larger than Foxx's.|$|E
500|$|Andy Gill of The Independent {{gave the}} album three stars out of five, commenting that [...] "Williams' albums have {{increasingly}} come to focus upon the singer himself, which has consequently made them {{less and less}} appealing to those not entirely smitten with his charms." [...] This sentiment was echoed by Rosie Swash from The Observer who also gave the album three stars out of five. She said that [...] "Reality Killed the Video Star is littered with references to his fall from grace, most of which hinge {{on the premise that}} <b>someone</b> <b>or</b> <b>something</b> else is truly responsible for his diminishing popularity." [...] Swash said that [...] "If there's a theme here it's not obvious, but it turns out Williams can be quite interesting when he moves off the topic of himself." [...] Swash concluded that the album swings between [...] "mawkish strings and piano overproduction" [...] and [...] "flashes of genuine pop frivolity".|$|E
30|$|Aggressive {{behavior}} can be comprehended as any behavior intended to inflict harm on <b>someone</b> <b>or</b> damage <b>something</b> (Berkowitz 1993; Dodge & Coie 1987). However, this complex and multi-determined phenomenon has not yet achieved a consensual definition. When not modulated or, when intense and persistent, these behaviors may lead to psychosocial losses {{over the course of}} life (Borsa & Bandeira 2014 a).|$|R
