They are formulated in a uniform manner, and in fact prove q-analogues of the ordinary and <b>shifted</b> <b>hook</b> formulas. The proofs proceed by combining the ordinary, respectively shifted, Hillman [...] Grassl algorithm and Stanley's (P; !) -partition theorem with the involution principle of Garsia and Milne. 1. Introduction. A few years ago there had been {{a lot of interest in}} finding a bijective proof of Frame, Robinson and Thrall's [1] hook formula for the number of standard Young tableaux of a given shape. This resulted in the discovery of three different such proofs [2, 10, 14], none of them is considered to be really satisfactory. Closest to being satisfactory is probably the proof by Franzblau and Zeilberger [2]. However, while the description of their algorithm is fairly simple, it is rather difficult to show that it really works. Also, i [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{bijective}} {{proof of the}} hook-length formula for shifted standard tableaux of a fixed shape based on a modified jeu de taquin and {{the ideas of the}} bijective proof of the hook-length formula for ordinary standard tableaux by Novelli, Pak and Stoyanovskii. In their proof Novelli, Pak and Stoyanovskii define a bijection between arbitrary fillings of the Ferrers diagram with the integers $ 1, 2, [...] .,n$ and pairs of standard tableaux and hook tabloids. In our shifted version of their algorithm the map from the set of arbitrary fillings of the shifted Ferrers diagram onto the set of shifted standard tableaux is analog to the construction of Novelli, Pak and Stoyanovskii, however, unlike to their algorithm, we are forced to use the 'rowwise' total order of the cells in the shifted Ferrers diagram rather than the 'columnwise' total order as the underlying order in the algorithm. Unfortunately the construction of the <b>shifted</b> <b>hook</b> tabloid is more complicated in the shifted case. As a side-result we obtain a simple random algorithm for generating shifted standard tableaux of a given shape, which produces every such tableau equally likely. Comment: 47 page...|$|R

A mostly minimalist and sparse landscape of sheer terror and spine-ripping controlled noise explosion". Guy Peters stated [...] "some moments come close to chamber music, but others employ the cut up-techniques or seem to function as an imaginary soundtrack. Another option is that you consider it an experiment in aural terror and not because it's a very alienating, extreme or demanding album throughout, but because it skilfully uses mood and <b>shifts</b> to <b>hook</b> you up {{with a feeling of}} unease".|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn a 1977 {{paper by}} J. Herman and F. Chung, several {{families}} of counterexamples to the conjecture that a tableau shape is uniquely determined (up to reflection, i. e. conjugation) by its multiset of hook numbers were presented. They {{also showed that}} by extending the definition of hook length a tableau shape is uniquely determined (up to conjugation) by its extended multiset of hook numbers. Here we provide an infinite family of counterexamples to the conjecture that a shifted tableau shape is uniquely determined by its multiset of <b>shifted</b> <b>hook</b> numbers. Regarding this uniqueness question, {{there is a great}} contrast between tableau shapes and shifted tableau shapes. Indeed, the first author had conjectured that there was just one example of nonuniqueness (the two shifted shapes consisting of three cells given by the partitions (2, 1) and (3)) in the shifted case. It was the view of the second author that this conjecture was quite unlikely. The fact is that in the first five million cases, there is only one other pair of examples {{and there seems to be}} reason to believe that the next example of nonuniqueness follows after just about a mole (about 6 × 1023) of distinguishable cases. This statement is based on our construction of an infinite family of pairs of shifted shapes possessing the property that for each pair the shapes are different but the multiset of hook numbers are the same, and the fact that a computer search revealed no further examples. It is for these reasons that the conjecture, which seemed unlikely (and indeed was false), should be thought all the more remarkable for being so very nearly true. We are lead to push our luck and conjecture once again that no additional examples exist. The result (Theorem 6) of Section 6 is in this direction...|$|R

40|$|On {{the eating}} {{reaction}} of fishes to each hook {{in the small}} long-line gear attached with 5 -hooks, the following results were obtained by some experiments made in the fishing pond of Sakurashima aquarium. 1) In some experiments in which the main line of the gear was kept straight, almost {{no difference in the}} eating reaction of fishes to each hook of the gear was to be observed. 2) But in some experiments in which the main line of the gear was shortened, the formation of a kind of catenary was observed in the line, and the more the main line shortening increased, near both ends of the main line, the less became the eating reaction to the hook. 3) The main cause of the above mentioned fact was considered to be attributed to the <b>shifting</b> of each <b>hook</b> in the catenary formed main line. 今回の実験結果によれば,延縄漁具において幹縄が常に緊張している場合には,その漁具の各釣針は,いずれも幹縄上で形状的に同じ状態となり,魚類の摂餌反応の条件もほとんど同様になるので,各釣針の摂餌回数がほぼ平均化するようになるものと思考する。しかし,その幹縄が短縮すると,水中でほぼCatenry形状をなし,幹縄の両端近くの釣針は周囲の縄類に近接するようになり,その釣針に対する摂餌障害度を増すので,その摂餌回数が減少するようになったものと思考する。なお,この減少傾向は,釣針が縄端のものになるほど,また,幹縄の短縮が増加するほど顕著になるようである。更に,魚種別,時季別の実験結果によれば,このような各釣針の摂餌現象は,いずれの場合も同様な傾向となるので,魚類の生態的な理由によるものでなく,延縄漁具そのものの水中における状態に原因するものであると思考される...|$|R

[...] Dave de Sylvia of Sputnikmusic shared this sentiment, stating that [...] "Crash Love smashes precedent to pieces, but, far from being a regression, it’s the best move they could have made at this stage in their career." [...] He also praised Puget's guitar work and Havok's lyrics, remarking of the latter that [...] "while Crash Love never quite hits the lyrical highs of Sing the Sorrow, it’s earthier and more relatable on a human level." [...] Though he felt that the album occasionally sounds disjointed, with fun uptempo tracks placed next to more subtle ones, he concluded that it was [...] "a more intricate and well-constructed album" [...] than its platinum-selling predecessor Decemberunderground, and [...] "an unexpectedly focused affair". Barry Thomson of The Phoenix called the album [...] "easily A.F.I.'s best since 2003's Sing the Sorrow, and the cheeky pop-punk chorus of 'Too Shy to Scream' is their first successful decree to boogie the night away." [...] Chris Fallon of AbsolutePunk rated the album an 83%, calling [...] "Cold Hands" [...] "painfully cheesy" [...] and [...] "Veronica Sawyer Smokes" [...] "the album's most overwhelming misfire, <b>shifting</b> from massive <b>hooks</b> to a jangly indie-pop mentality", but praised each band member's performance and concluded that the album is [...] "by no means a work of art, but it's a nice step-up from the mildly enjoyable 2006 release Decemberunderground".|$|R
40|$|Bycatch, defined here as catch {{discarded}} for regulatory, {{economic or}} personal reasons, from pelagic longline fisheries {{has contributed to}} wide spread population declines of sharks and sea turtles. Opportunities to reduce impacts in these fisheries occur throughout the fishing process and depend upon the fishing practices within fleets, and upon the behaviour of target and bycatch species. The overall objective of this thesis was to identify bycatch mitigation opportunities within the Canadian Atlantic pelagic longline fishery, which targets swordfish (Xiphias gladius), warm-water tunas (bigeye, Thunnus obesus; yellowfin T. albacares; and albacore, T. alalunga) and mahi-mahi (Coryphaena hippurus). Bycatch includes common sharks and rays (blue shark, Prionace glauca; pelagic stingray, Pteroplatytrygon violacea), and endangered sea turtles (leatherback Dermochelys coriacea; loggerhead, Caretta caretta). Bycatch mitigation approaches such as <b>shifting</b> to circle <b>hooks,</b> increased the likelihood that shark bycatch would be released alive and with less severe hooking injuries. Shorter longline soak times also increased hooking survival among most of the common bycatch species. Shorter soak times would not decrease catch {{of the most common}} landed species (swordfish), but this shift in fishing practices could negatively impact fisher safety. Interviews with active longline captains revealed operational difficulties and unintended ecological impacts with proposed bycatch mitigation approaches. Longline captains also reported innovative uses of bycatch mitigation tools that could increase post-release survival of common bycatch species in this and other pelagic longline fleets. Finally, the combined analysis of fisheries observer data, qualitative data from fishers' knowledge interviews, and concurrent environmental data suggested that high blue shark catch rates were related to local oceanography - and did not reflect behavioural differences between blue shark and swordfish. Clearly, there are opportunities for bycatch mitigation within the Canadian pelagic longline fishery for swordfish and tunas. However, the process of interviewing pelagic longline captains revealed both interest in reducing bycatch, but also suspicion of research efforts. Such trust issues will need to be addressed in subsequent research as the combined use of fishery assessments, detailed oceanographic data, practical fishing knowledge, and on-the-water observations will be needed to decrease the amount of and harm to discarded bycatch...|$|R
