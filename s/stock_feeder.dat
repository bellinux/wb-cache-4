50|$|The Parker-Hickman Farm {{includes}} the oldest standing log structure in Buffalo National River. The farm was homesteaded in the 1840s by settlers from Tennessee. It embodies an agricultural landscape with farmstead, extant fields (bench and bottomland), fencerows, roads, cattle gates, garden and orchard plots, wooded slopes and springs. Unlike most {{farms in the}} Ozarks the landscape is remarkably intact and provides insights and evidence spanning portions of two centuries of Ozark history; not randomly chosen, it conveys a feeling of enclosure and exemplifies adaptive use of topography. Among farms {{of its kind in}} Missouri and Arkansas it was once typical but now survives as a rare baseline example for Ozark yeomanry farms of mixed economies. Parker-Hickman was an agricultural enterprise that continuously operated until 1982 from a farmstead which exemplifies the entire period, and a rare one for the Ozarks since it survives. Clustered around the farmstead are several structures: barns, sheds smokehouse, privy, fences, <b>stock</b> <b>feeders</b> and house that represent a cross-section of rural vernacular architecture still in their original location.|$|R

40|$|In the Oosterschelde estuary, primary {{production}} has decreased by 50 % {{in the last}} 15 years. Nutrient concentrations are low but {{primary production}} is nutrient limited only for short periods during the growing season. Dominant bivalve filter <b>feeder</b> <b>stocks</b> consist of mussels (Mytilus edulis), cockles (Cerastoderma edule) and the introduced Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas). The mussel stock, which is under control of the mussel farmers, has decreased due to shortage of mussel seed, cockle stocks have maintained and oysters have expanded. Total filtration capacity has increased, also due to the invasion of Ensis americanus. Bivalve growth and condition are food limited, as shown by a negative correlation between average mussel meat content and bivalve filter <b>feeder</b> <b>stock</b> size in a certain year. The annual growth of cockles has decreased, and the fraction picoplankton is now up to 30 % of total phytoplankton. Food limitation, high filtration capacity, picoplankton abundance, and only short-term bottom-up control of primary production by nutrient limitation, point to overgrazing {{as a cause of}} primary production decline.

50|$|The {{bananaquit}} {{is known}} for its ability to adjust remarkably to human environments. It often visits gardens and may become very tame. Its nickname, the sugar bird, comes from its affinity for bowls or bird <b>feeders</b> <b>stocked</b> with granular sugar, a common method of attracting these birds. The bananaquit builds a spherical lined nest with a side entrance hole, laying up to three eggs, which are incubated solely by the female. It may also build its nest in human-made objects, such as lampshades and garden trellises. The birds breed all year regardless of season and build new nests throughout the year.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Weaned rabbits {{fed with}} a maize based diet {{supplemented}} with Guatemala grass {{were used in}} a factorial experiment to compare the effects of stocking rate (5 vs 10 per m) and feeder type on production parameters and mortality over an 8 week period under Cameroon conditions. Stocking rate did not affect (P> 0. 05) feed intake, feed conversion efficiency or mortality rates. Increasing the number of animals from 2 to 4 in a cage resulted in {{a significant decrease in}} daily weight gain (P 0. 05) effect on feed intake, growth rate, feed conversion efficiency or mortality rate. However, feed wastage was significantly (P 0. 05) any of the parameters measured. The interaction between sex, feeder type, and cage density had a significant (P< 0. 01) effect only on feed wastage. The results of the study showed that rearing rabbits in pairs per cage and using a cylindrical metallic tin feeder would enhance faster growth and reduce the amount of feed wasted.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} Dutch Smart Dairy Farming {{project is}} to develop {{decision}} support models for operational support in farm management. This project started in 2012 and involves collaboration between several institutions and companies in the dairy chain. The project has three focus areas: animal health, fertility and feeding. The objective of the 'animal health' focus area is to optimise young stock rearing {{as a basis for}} extending the life of cows. Lowering the annual replacement rate, which is currently about 30 %, has a significant positive impact on financial results. The main objectives of this young stock rearing project were to develop state-of-the-art tools which would help the farmer to optimise growth and development of young <b>stock.</b> Milk <b>feeders</b> and water drinkers combined with weighing scales were used for data collection at individual calf level. Daily data about milk intake, milk feeder visits, water intake and body weight were used to build detection models that generate alerts when measured values deviate and indicate a possible health problem. Body weight measurements were also used to determine the growth rate of a calf and to produce an alert if this deviated too much from a desired growth rate. All alerts were translated into messages with work instructions for the farmer. Weekly feedback from the farmer indicated that almost 60 % of the messages were correct. It is suggested that the large number of wrong messages (false positives) can be reduced by applying more advanced analysis techniques...|$|R

40|$|For {{extensive}} shellfish culture, the trophic {{capacity of}} the culture system is a major production factor and this {{is determined by the}} primary production, the flux of food to the culture sites and the role of competing filter feeders. Various control mechanisms play a role in these processes: bottom-up control of primary production may shift to top-down control at increasing filter <b>feeder</b> <b>stocks.</b> Nutrient limitation, hence bottom-up control, may decrease through enhanced nutrient regeneration, while increased grazing pressure will reduce phytoplankton biomass to the benefit of picoplankton and macro-algae. To evaluate the production capacity of a given ecosystem, as well as the potential and the impact of expanding shellfish culture, {{there is a need for}} simple parameters, in addition to the development of more sophisticated simulation models. Efforts have been made to develop indices for shellfish culture capacity evaluation, such as the ratios of clearance conjunction with a massive invasion of exotic oysters and razor clams; the outcomes will be discussed. time, residence time, primary production time and nitrogen turnover time, and the ratio between pico- en microphytoplankton.

40|$|Farmers {{who follow}} the markets know that {{livestock}} and grain prices vary from month to month {{with a certain amount}} of regularity. Drouths, business depressions and booms may alter or distort seasonal price movements in any individual year. But farmers know that on the average some prices are highest in the winter while others are highest in the summer. Marketings of farm products, purchases of <b>feeder</b> <b>stock,</b> average weights of market receipts, cold storage holdings and feeding ratios also follow definite seasonal patterns. The wise farm manager knows it will pay him to study these seasonal market patterns and plan his production in their light. It isnât always wise to plan production so as to hit the market in the season of highest prices. In many cases such a production plan would increase costs more than enough to offset the gain from higher prices. But a careful study of seasonal variations in prices and supplies will help farmers plan production so as to hit the market which ordinarily offers the greatest opportunity for profits, considering both production costs and probable sale prices.

40|$|Predation by adult {{bivalves}} oil bivalve larvae {{has been}} suggested to reduce larval abundance in areas with high bivalve filter-feeder biomass. Although the occurrence of larviphagy is well-studied in the laboratory, its effects in the field have scarcely been studied. We studied larviphagy at different spatial scales in the Oosterschelde estuary. On the scale of individuals, we confirmed that larviphagy occurs in Crassostrea gigas and Mytilus edulis in the Oosterschelde estuary, by examining stomach contents of adult bivalves. On a local scale, we studied effects of larviphagy by a Pacific oyster (C gigas) bed on presence of larvae in the overlying water column by sampling larvae with fixed plankton nets. Abundance of blue mussel (M. edulis) larvae was significantly reduced by the oyster. Abundance of C gigas larvae {{did not seem to}} be reduced by the oyster bed, but spawning by the adult oysters during the sampling period may have affected the results. On estuary-scale, the effect of larviphagy on larval abundance of C gigas and M. edulis was studied using existing monitoring data over 6 years for M. edulis and 13 years for C. gigas. Numbers of M. edulis larvae showed no significant trend over the 6 years studied. Abundance of C gigas larvae declined with an increasing filter <b>feeder</b> <b>stock</b> (that was mainly caused by an increase in C gigas stock). This decline may be due to direct effects of larviphagy or indirect effects such as lowered food levels, and was not compensated by an increased larval production. All results combined, complemented with a theoretical estimate of the effect of larviphagy on estuary-scale, strongly suggest that larviphagy is major source of mortality for bivalve larvae in the Oosterschelde estuary.

40|$|The {{potential}} of periphyton-based aquaculture in South Asia {{is under investigation}} in an extensive research program. This paper is a further analysis of data from four experiments carried out in that framework, to explore periphyton, fish and fertilizer dose effects on water quality. Factor analysis and ANOVA models applied to a data matrix of water quality parameters in ponds with and without artificial substrates (bamboo poles and kanchi sticks), with and without fish (filter feeders catla and rohu, with and without bottom feeder kalbaush), and with a standard or 50 % increased fertilizer dose, allowed us to identify the underlying ecological processes governing this novel periphyton-based pond system, and construct conceptual graphic models of the periphyton-environment relationships observed. We clearly established that the phosphorus flow is mainly linked to phytoplankton activity {{in the water column}} and decomposition on the pond bottom, while nitrogen flow is mainly linked to autotrophic (photosynthesis) and heterotrophic (decomposition and nitrification) processes that take place in the periphyton in addition to the water column and pond bottom. Consequently, disruption of the pond bottom by bottom feeding fish primarily promoted phosphate cycling and phytoplankton, while periphyton development on the supplied substrates and fertilization mainly improved oxygen balance and nitrogen related processes developing in the water column. The use of bamboo poles led to better results than kanchi sticks, related to the greater autotrophic periphyton development on bamboo and to the larger surface of bamboo poles that facilitate fish grazing and periphyton dislodgment that in turn have a renewal effect on periphyton. Stocking bottom feeding fish produces a fertilizing effect through the food web that benefits the filter-feeding fish and that makes it unnecessary to increase the dose of inorganic and organic fertilizers applied to the ponds. Thus, the output of this analysis will help the fish farmers in resource constrained countries to improve their production in periphyton-based ponds just by choosing bamboo substrates, <b>stocking</b> a bottom <b>feeder</b> fish together with the filter feeders, and saving money on fertilizers...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} episodes {{in the history of the}} western Canadian cattle industry occurred during the years 1942 - 48 when the Canadian government imposed an embargo on Canadian cattle entering the United States. This unprecedented measure was a reaction to the extraordinary demands of the national war effort, and was accepted conditionally by the cattle industry as a necessary patriotic gesture. However, official wartime policies respecting this embargo, and its retention beyond the war until late 1948 were neither anticipated nor appreciated by western Canadian stockmen. Their efforts to restore a market deemed crucial to their industry 2 Ì 7 s survival, and the government 2 Ì 7 s seeming failure to appreciate the stockmen 2 Ì 7 s position, clearly showed that the 2 Ì 2 price of patriotism 2 Ì 2 went beyond merely fighting a war. Since its inception in the early 1880 s, the western Canadian cattle industry depended on export markets. Although home consumption accounted for about ninety percent of Canadian cattle marketings, it was the exportable ten percent that determined domestic prices and defined the quality standard for Canadian beef. ! Over the years only two markets absorbed this annual surplus of between 15 Q, 000 and 200, 000 head. The first was in Great Britain where demand for Canadian cattle helped nurture the western Canadian ranching industry up to 1907. This market was eclipsed after 1914 when relaxation of the American tariff encouraged the southward movement of Canadian cattle. This new American outlet for both fat <b>stock</b> and <b>feeder</b> cattle was so profitable that by 1920 it had become axiomatic among Canadian cattlemen that their industry 2 Ì 7 s survival depended upon its availability. 2 As such, much of the Canadian stockmen 2 Ì 7 s economic travail between 1921 and 1935 was blamed on the renewed American tariffs of 1921 - 22 and 1930, that imposed daunting levies of between two and three cents per pound and which, especially during the years 1921 - 25 and 1930 - 34, made it virtually impossible to ship cattle profitably to United States points. 3 Despite its popularity among western Canadian cattlemen, the American market did not figure highly in the emerging Canadian agricultural policies of the period. It was perceived as unstable and subject to tariff volatility. More important, however, was the Canadian federal government 2 Ì 7 s commitment to the British market as the most dependable and permanent outlet for its agricultural products. Especially after the Imperial Conference of 1932, when Britain formally abandoned her century-old commitment to free trade in favor of a system of imperial preference, Canadian policymakers became convinced that they had at last secured a market to absorb the nation 2 Ì 7 s growing agricultural surpluses. That these agricultural policies were built around the British need for wheat and pork, and not cattle, mattered little in the new scheme of things. Cattle exports emerged as an add-on entity, one not really needed nor even wanted by Great Britain and certainly not a factor to the Canadian beef producer who realized that the British market was simply not viable in normal circumstances, and was but a pale replacement for the country 2 Ì 7 s natural market in the United States...|$|R
40|$|The Big Horn Mountains are a geologically complex {{range that}} extends over 500 square km in west-central Arizona. Three major lithologic terranes outcrop: (1) Proterozoic amphibolite, phyllite, schists, gneiss, and granite; (2) Mesozoic {{monzonite}} to diorite intrusives; and (3) Cenozoic mafic to silicic volcanic rocks and clastic rocks. The entire area {{is in the}} upper plate of a detachment fault and, consequently, contains many low- to high-angle normal faults. Each lithologic terrane has its associated mineral occurrences. The Big Horn district is exclusively hosted in the pre- Tertiary terrane. Most of its mineral occurrences are spatially related to the Late Cretaceous intrusive rocks. One occurrence, the Pump Mine, may be a metamorphic secretion deposit, and therefore, would be middle Proterozoic. The {{vast majority of the}} mineral occurrences in the Big Horn Mountains are middle Tertiary in age and occur in three districts: the Tiger Wash barite - fluorite district; the Aguila manganese district; and the Osborne base and precious metal district. Fluid inclusions from Tiger Wash fluorite (T(h) 120 to 210 Â° C, NaCl wt. equivalent 17 to 18 percent not corrected for COâ) and nearby detachment - fault- hosted Harquahala district fluorite (T(h) 150 to 230 Â° C., NaC 1 wt. equivalent 15. 5 to 20 percent not corrected for COâ) suggest cooling and dilution of fluids as they are presumed to evolve from the detachment fault into the upper plate. Mass-balance calculations suggest that the proposed evolution of fluids is sufficient to account for the observed tonnage of barite and fluorite. The Tiger Wash occurrences grade directly into calcite- gangue-dominated manganese oxides of the Aguila district. A wide range of homogenization temperatures (T(h) 200 to 370 Â° C.), an absence of COâ and low salinities (NaC 1 wt. equivalent 1 to 2 percent) in the Aguila district calcite-hosted fluid inclusions argue for distillation of fluids during boiling or boiling of non saline-meteoric waters. Mass - balance calculations modeling the evolution of Ca and Mn during potassium metasomatism of plagioclase in basalt suggest that little if any influx of these cations is necessary to form the calcite âdominated manganese oxide tonnage observed. The Aguila district grades directly to the east into the base-metal and precious-metal occurrences of the Osborne district. Preliminary data describing geological settings, fluid inclusions, and geochemistry suggest that the Osborne district has a continuum between gold-rich to silver-rich epithermal occurrences. The gold-rich systems have dominantly quartz gangue, with or without fluorite, and are hosted in a variety of rocks, but are proximal to Precambrian phyllite or mid-Tertiary rhyolite. Fluid inclusions from two occurrences representative of the gold -rich systems spread across a minor range (T(h) 190 to 230 Â° C., NaC 1 wt. equivalent 17 to 23 percent not corrected for COâ). Dilution of highly saline fluids is the inferred mechanism for precipitation of gold in the gold-quartz systems. The silver-rich systems have dominantly calcite gangue with or without quartz, and are hosted in mid-Tertiary basalt. Calcite fluid inclusions from a representative high-silver occurrence display a wide range of homogenization temperatures and salinities (T(h) 120 to 370 Â° C., NaC 1 wt. equivalent 7 to 23 percent). Boiling and consequent neutralization of acidic solutions is the inferred mechanism for the silver-rich, calcite gangue systems. A model inferring a regional fluid-flow regime and local sources of metals is proposed. Four possible regional and local causes of fluid flow in upper-plate detachment regimes are proposed: (1) regional elevation of geothermal gradients as a result of middle-crustal, lower-plate rocks rising to upper crustal levels; (2) meteoric water recharge along the southeast flank of the Harquahala antiform and consequent displacement of connate waters in the upper-plate of the Big Horn Mountains; (3) local emplacement of <b>feeder</b> <b>stocks</b> to rhyolitic flows; (4) and tilting of major upper-plate structural blocks...|$|R
