5|$|The Montreal Laboratory {{had been}} a {{fruitful}} and successful international venture, although the Canadians had on occasion been resentful of British actions that were perceived as high-handed and insensitive. One such action came in November 1945 when the British government suddenly announced that Cockcroft {{had been a}}ppointed {{the head of the}} new Atomic Energy Research Establishment in Britain without any prior consultation {{and at a time when}} the NRX reactor was still under construction. Cockcroft did not depart Canada until September 1946, but it was a <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> of waning British interest in collaboration with Canada. The British suggested he be replaced by the British physicist Bennett Lewis, who was eventually appointed, but only after the Canadian-born Walter Zinn turned the job down.|$|E
5|$|Wine was {{considered}} the basic drink, consumed at all meals and occasions by all classes and was quite inexpensive. Cato the Elder once advised cutting his rations in half to conserve wine for the workforce. Many types of drinks involving grapes and honey were consumed as well. Drinking {{on an empty stomach}} was regarded as boorish and a <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> for alcoholism, the debilitating physical and psychological effects of which were known to the Romans. An accurate accusation of being an alcoholic was an effective way to discredit political rivals. Prominent Roman alcoholics included Marcus Antonius, and Cicero's own son Marcus (Cicero Minor). Even Cato the Younger was known to be a heavy drinker.|$|E
5|$|As Bradley's term {{drew to a}} close, {{potential}} Republican {{candidates to}} succeed him were initially few. Some saw Kentucky's 18,000-vote plurality for William Jennings Bryan in the 1896 presidential election as a <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> that the state would vote Democratic in 1899. Others {{were not interested in}} being on the defensive against the inevitable Democratic attacks on Bradley's administration. Still others were intimidated by the prospect of being defeated by the machinery of the Goebel Election Law. Sitting attorney general William S. Taylor was the first to announce his candidacy and soon secured the support of Senator Deboe. Later candidates included Hopkins County judge Clifton J. Pratt and sitting state auditor Sam H. Stone. The former was Bradley's choice, but Taylor was a skilled political organizer and was able to create a strong political machine amongst the county delegations. He seemed the favorite to win the nomination.|$|E

5|$|Despite the poetics {{attached}} to Germanicus by ancient authors, it is accepted by historians such as Anthony Barrett that Germanicus was an able general. He {{fought against the}} Pannonians under Tiberius, quelled the mutiny in the Rhine, and led three successful campaigns into Germania. As for his popularity, he was popular enough that the mutinous legions of the Rhine attempted to proclaim him emperor in AD 14; however, he remained loyal and led them against the German tribes instead. Tacitus and Suetonius claim that Tiberius was jealous of Germanicus' popularity, but Barrett suggests their claim might be contradicted by the fact that, following his campaigns in Germany, Germanicus was given command of the eastern provinces – a <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> he was intended to rule. In accordance with the precedent set by Augustus, Agrippa had been given command of those same provinces in the east when Agrippa was the intended successor to the empire.|$|E
5|$|Henry VIII's first {{marriage}} had {{its origins in}} 1502 when his elder brother, Arthur, died. Their father, Henry VII, then betrothed Arthur's widow, Catherine of Aragon, to the future king. The betrothal immediately raised questions related to the biblical prohibition (in Leviticus 18 and 20) against marriage to a brother's wife. The couple married in 1509 and {{after a series of}} miscarriages, a daughter, Mary, was born in 1516. By the 1520s, Henry still did not have a son to name as heir and he took this as a <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> of God's anger and made overtures to the Vatican about an annulment. He gave Cardinal Wolsey the task of prosecuting his case; Wolsey began by consulting university experts. From 1527, in addition to his duties as a Cambridge don, Cranmer assisted with the annulment proceedings.|$|E
5|$|Potential Republican gubernatorial {{candidates}} were initially few. Some saw Kentucky's 18,000-vote plurality for William Jennings Bryan in the 1896 presidential election as a <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> {{that the state}} would vote Democratic in 1899. Others {{were not interested in}} being on the defense against the inevitable Democratic attacks on the Bradley administration. Still others were intimidated by the prospect of being defeated by the machinery of the Goebel Election Law. Party leaders were encouraged, however, by the deep Democratic divisions at the Music Hall Convention. Sitting attorney general William S. Taylor was the first to announce his candidacy and soon secured the support of Republican senator William Deboe. Later candidates included Hopkins County judge Clifton J. Pratt and sitting state Auditor Sam H. Stone. The former was the choice of Governor Bradley, while the latter was supported by Lexington Herald editor Sam J. Roberts. Taylor, like Goebel, was a skilled political organizer. He was able to create a strong political machine amongst the county delegations and seemed the favorite to win the nomination.|$|E

25|$|In 1834, Goncharov {{graduated}} from the University and returned home to enter the chancellery of Simbirsk governor A. M. Zagryazhsky. A year later, he moved to Saint Petersburg and started working as a translator at the Finance Ministry's Foreign commerce department. Here, in the Russian capital, he became friends with the Maykov family and tutored both Apollon Maykov and Valerian Maykov in the Latin language and in Russian literature. He {{became a member of}} the elitist literary circle based in the Maykovs' house and attended by writers like Ivan Turgenev, Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Dmitry Grigorovich. The Maykovs' almanac Snowdrop featured many of Goncharov's poems, but he soon stopped dabbling in poetry altogether. Some of those early verses were later incorporated into the novel A Common Story as Aduev's writings, a <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> that the author had stopped taking them seriously.|$|E
25|$|Shen Teh is {{rewarded for}} her hospitality, as the gods {{take it as}} a <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> of goodness. They give her money and she buys a humble tobacco shop which they intend as both gift and test: will Shen Teh be able to {{maintain}} her goodness with these newfound means, however slight they may be? If she succeeds, the gods' confidence in humanity would be restored. Though at first Shen Teh seems {{to live up to the}} gods' expectations, her generosity quickly turns her small shop into a messy, overcrowded poorhouse which attracts crime and police supervision. In a sense, Shen Teh quickly fails the test, as she is forced to introduce the invented cousin Shui Ta as overseer and protector of her interests. Shen Teh dons a costume of male clothing, a mask, and a forceful voice to take on the role of Shui Ta. Shui Ta arrives at the shop, coldly explains that his cousin has gone out of town on a short trip, curtly turns out the hangers-on, and quickly restores order to the shop.|$|E

West also enjoyed the love triangle for being [...] "so skillfully kept as the subplot it should be. It {{is as much}} due to the light touches of the three actors as to the writers... It's refreshing that Jim and Karen have mostly been so mature and honest, but that's a <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> that the relationship will devolve, because the setup for the success for most long-term TV romances requires miscommunication and no confrontation."

500|$|Walton's {{house in}} London was {{destroyed}} by German bombing in May 1941, after which {{he spent much of}} his time at Alice Wimborne's family house at Ashby St Ledgers in the countryside of Northamptonshire in the middle of England. While there, Walton worked on projects that had been in his mind for some time. In 1939 he had been planning a substantial chamber work, a string quartet, but he set it aside while composing his wartime film scores. In early 1945 he turned again to the quartet. Walton was conscious that Britten, with Les Illuminations (1940), the Sinfonia da Requiem (1942), and Peter Grimes in 1945, had produced a series of substantial works, while Walton had produced no major composition since the Violin Concerto in 1939. Among English critics and audiences, the Violin Concerto was not at first rated one of Walton's finest works. Because Heifetz had bought the exclusive rights to play the concerto for two years, it was not heard in Britain until 1941. The London premiere, with a less famous soloist, and in the unflattering acoustics of the Royal Albert Hall, did not immediately reveal the work as a masterpiece. The String Quartet in A minor, premiered in May 1947, was Walton's most substantial work of the 1940s. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, calls it one of his finest achievements and [...] "a <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> that he had thrown off the trammels of his cinema style and rediscovered his true voice." ...|$|E
500|$|For these concerts, Bache {{programmed}} five of Liszt's symphonic poems, the Faust and Dante symphonies, the Thirteenth Psalm and the Legend of St. Elisabeth. Works of Berlioz, Schumann and Wagner {{were also}} featured, but Liszt's compositions predominated. While {{the performances of}} the Faust and Dante symphonies were British premieres, the symphonic poems had previously been introduced at the Crystal Palace; nevertheless, Bache felt that offering repeat performances of the symphonic poems was important in making them familiar to audiences. Les préludes was performed three times at the Bache concerts, Mazeppa, [...] Festklänge and Orpheus each twice and Tasso once. Part of this strategy of familiarity was {{the inclusion of the}} two-piano arrangements of the symphonic poems as a way to prepare audiences for the orchestral versions. Bache had begun this practice with his first concert in 1865, when he and Dannreuther presented the two-piano arrangement of Les préludes. Another part of this strategy was supplying learned, well-considered and thoroughly detailed essays for program notes. Sometimes Bache wrote them himself; at other times, he relied on prominent theorists such as Carl Weitman and Frederick Niecks. According to musicologist Alan Walker, they [...] "are filled with insights that were both new and original for their time, and they are lavishly illustrated with music examples—a <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> that they were aimed at a sophisticated public and were intended to have a potential life after the concert was over." [...] According to Walker, they still are worth study for Liszt scholars as many of the ideas, while transmitted through members of Liszt's inner circle, probably originated with the composer himself. These notes, along with the inclusion of the two-piano arrangements and what musicologist Michael Allis calls [...] "a thoughtful approach to programming ... all contributed to an aggressive marketing of Liszt's new status as a composer".|$|E

500|$|Jamie Waylett of The Advocate {{was more}} critical, saying [...] "Madonna {{delivers}} the worst performance {{in recent memory}} as the heroine of an attempt at screwball comedy. Watching her try to look like Marilyn Monroe and sound like Betty Boop, though, is a <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> that this film was a disaster in the making. At the same time, it seems inconceivable that anyone would sit down and plan something so dreadful." [...] Carole Kass of the Richmond Times-Dispatch felt that since [...] "Madonna is the idol of teen-agers. If they imitate her hair and her makeup, these 'wanna-bes' {{who want to be}} like Madonna and dress like Madonna may be cute. But, as a popular personality, Madonna has a responsibility to her fans. And shoplifting is something not to promote. Nor is smoking." [...] Dan Dinicola of The Schenectady Gazette felt that [...] "Who's That Girl is not simply an awful film, it is positively unbearable. It's a movie without a head or a brain, a picture of such crass stupidity that it can't even make you angry. Instead it numbs you to death with its moronic platitudes, its pretensions to comedy. [...] It's a vanity project which is so amateurly produced and conceived that it makes you want to cringe in shame. [...] Madonna {{is no more than a}} novelty item." [...] Johanna Steinmetz of the Chicago Tribune complimented Dunne's acting and said: [...] "Fortunately the film has Griffin Dunne. Dunne, working in a domain once ruled by Cary Grant, manages to be stuffy, naive and vulnerable but never undignified as Loudon Trott, the New York lawyer." [...] Jean Rosenbluth of Rolling Stone was harsh about the film, saying [...] "The question posed by the film's title was Who's that girl? The answer provided by the box-office receipts was, alas, 'The same one who appeared in Shanghai Surprise and bored us to death'." ...|$|E

2500|$|The dermis {{generating}} the horn is {{anchored to the}} boss by interpenetration between rugosities – various irregularities of bone, which it creates by deposition.

The author states that rugosity is [...] "a bony signature of dermal armor". Cranial rugosity is an indication, but not a <b>sure</b> <b>sign,</b> of a horn.

2500|$|A <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> of the {{presence}} of mopane worms is defoliation of mopane woodland - sometimes around ninety per cent of leaves.

Some farmers therefore view the mopane worm as competition for their livestock, and attempt to eradicate the [...] "pest" [...] with insecticides and the like. However, the caterpillar season is short, and the trees sprout the new, tender foliage which browsers prefer, so this problem can be managed in other ways, for example, by working to mutual benefit with the local caterpillar harvesters who will control the worms by harvesting them.|$|E

[...] Besom welts can be of self fabric or trimmed with the lapel's silk facing, though classic menswear scholar Nicholas Antongiavanni suggests that for the English this latter touch [...] "is a <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> of hired clothes."

6000|$|... 3. The {{third thing}} I {{take notice of}} from hence is, that a sinful life and a quiet death annexed to it is the ready, the open, the beaten, the common highway to hell: there is no <b>surer</b> <b>sign</b> of damnation than {{for a man to}} die quietly after a sinful life. I do not say that all wicked men that are molested at their death with a sense of sin and fears of hell do {{therefore}} go to heaven, for some are also made to see, and are left to despair, not converted by seeing, that they might go roaring out of this world to their place. But I say there is no <b>surer</b> <b>sign</b> of a man's damnation than to die quietly after a sinful life; than to sin and die with his eyes shut; than to sin and die with an heart that cannot repent. 'He hath blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart' (John 12:40).
