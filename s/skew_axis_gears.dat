The change in the participation of the clean energy in the energy balance may be done not only by the erection of new and renovation of the already existing plants, but also through an improvement of their energetic efficiency.

For this propose {{the effects of}} density and crop ratios in row intercropping on grain and biomass yield of grain sorghum, (promising line, M 5) and common bean (Talash cultivar) were investigated.

30|$|Computational stereo is in {{the fields}} of {{computer}} vision and photogrammetry. In the computational stereo and surface reconstruction paradigms, {{it is very important to}} achieve appropriate epipolar constraints during the camera-modeling step of the stereo image processing. It has been shown that the epipolar geometry of linear pushbroom imagery has a hyperbola-like shape because of the non-coplanarity of the line of sight vectors. Several studies have been conducted to generate resampled epipolar image pairs from linear pushbroom satellites images; however, the currently prevailing methods are limited by their pixel scales, <b>skewed</b> <b>axis</b> angles, or disproportionality between x-parallax disparities and height. In this paper, a practical and unified piecewise epipolar resampling method is proposed to generate stereo image pairs with zero y-parallax, a square pixel scale, and proportionality between x-parallax disparity and height. Furthermore, four criteria are suggested for performance evaluations of the prevailing methods, and experimental results of the method are presented based on the suggested criteria. The proposed method is shown to be equal to or an improvement upon the prevailing methods.|$|R
40|$|The {{topology}} {{of parallel}} <b>axis</b> <b>gears,</b> such as {{spur and helical}} gears is modified to produce quieter and more smoothly operating gear sets with more uniform load distribution. A finite element analysis of the gear in its operating mode is made to produce a plot of radial and tangential deflections of the pinion and gear tooth surfaces which will occur when the gears are loaded during operation. The resultant plot is then inverted to produce a plot, or set of coordinates, which will define the path of travel of the gear tooth grinding wheel, which path is {{a mirror image of}} the plot of the finite element analysis. The resulting gears, when subjected to operating loads, will thus be deflected tangentially and radially to their optimum operating, or theoretical true involute, positions so as to produce quieter, smoother, and more evenly loaded gear trains...|$|R
40|$|The {{tooth contact}} {{stiffness}} is very often included in dynamic mathematical models of gear drives. It {{is an important}} value for calculation of torsion eigenfrequencies as w ell as the dynamic properties of the whole transmission systems. Planetary gear drives have several advantages over simple parallel <b>axis</b> <b>gears,</b> especially due to theirs compact design and great torque-to-weight ratio caused by multiple parallel paths. However, the dimensional or mounting errors can cause that some planets have the tendency to take more load than the others. One of the ways how to improve load sharing is the application of flexible planetary pins or by using a free central wheel. However in such cases, the wheels motion is defined in one rotation coordinate and two translation coordinates — tangential and radial. The reaction force at radial change of axis distance is usually neglected. The focus of this contribution is to derive the stiffness of this radial connection and to analyse the influence of radial stiffness on planetary gear dynamics...|$|R
40|$|The SOVA {{algorithm}} {{was originally}} developed under the Resilient Systems and Operations Project of the Engineering for Complex Systems Program from NASA s Aerospace Technology Enterprise as {{a conceptual framework}} to support real-time autonomous system mission and contingency management. The algorithm and its software implementation were formulated for generic application to autonomous flight vehicle systems, and its efficacy was demonstrated by simulation within the problem domain of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle autonomous flight management. The approach itself {{is based upon the}} precept that autonomous decision making for a very complex system can be made tractable by distillation of the system state to a manageable set of strategic objectives (e. g. maintain power margin, maintain mission timeline, and et cetera), which if attended to, will result in a favorable outcome. From any given starting point, the attainability of the end-states resulting from a set of candidate decisions is assessed by propagating a system model forward in time while qualitatively mapping simulated states into margins on strategic objectives using fuzzy inference systems. The expected return value of each candidate decision is evaluated as the product of the assigned value of the end-state with the assessed attainability of the end-state. The candidate decision yielding the highest expected return value is selected for implementation; thus, the approach provides a software framework for intelligent autonomous risk management. The name adopted for the technique incorporates its essential elements: Strategic Objective Valuation and Attainability (SOVA). Maximum value of the approach is realized for systems where human intervention is unavailable in the timeframe within which critical control decisions must be made. The Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) satellite, launched in 1999, has been collecting science data for eight years. [1] At its beginning of life, FUSE had six gyros in two IRUs and four reaction wheels. Over time through various failures, the satellite has been left with one reaction wheel on the vehicle <b>skew</b> <b>axis</b> and two gyros. To remain operational, a control scheme has been implemented using the magnetic torque rods and the remaining momentum wheel. [2] As a consequence, there are attitude regions where there is insufficient torque authority to overcome environmental disturbances (e. g. gravity gradient torques). The situation is further {{complicated by the fact that}} these attitude regions shift inertially with time as the spacecraft moves through earth s magnetic field during the course of its orbit. Under these conditions, the burden of planning targets and target-to-target slew maneuvers has increased significantly since the beginning of the mission. [3] Individual targets must be selected so that the magnetic field remains roughly aligned with the <b>skew</b> wheel <b>axis</b> to provide enough control authority to the other two orthogonal axes. If the field moves too far away from the <b>skew</b> <b>axis,</b> the lack of control authority allows environmental torques to pull the satellite away from the target and can potentially cause it to tumble. Slew maneuver planning must factor the stability of targets at the beginning and end, and the torque authority at all points along the slew. Due to the time varying magnetic field geometry relative to any two inertial targets, small modifications in slew maneuver timing can make large differences in the achievability of a maneuver...|$|R
40|$|Forearm {{rotation}} (pro-/supination) {{involves a}} non-trivial combination of rotation and trans-lation of two bones, namely, radius and ulna, relatively to each other. Early works regarded this relative motion as a rotation about a fixed (<b>skew)</b> <b>axis.</b> However, this assumption turns {{out not to}} be exact. This thesis regards a spatial-loop surrogate mechanism involving two de-grees of freedom with an elastic coupling for better forearm motion prediction. In addition, the influence of the bone morphology and position of elbow on kinematics are also consid-ered. The model parameters are not measured directly from the anatomical components, but are fitted by reducing the errors between predicted and measured values in an optimization loop. For non-invasive measurement of bone position, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is employed. We present a method to self-calibrate the arm position in the MRI scanning tube and to fit the model parameters from a few, coarse MRI scans.

A practical differential planetary gear train, which combines two inputs and one output, is studied using multi-body dynamics software. Backlash between the sun gear and planet gears are precisely specified to avoid teeth interference and undercut. In order to calculate accurate impact forces, an impact model is chosen. Tooth geometry errors are created on the sun gear. Constraints and contact forces to the model are applied {{as close as possible to}} real operating conditions. Torsional vibration induced by backlash and tooth geometry errors is shown to cause teeth separation and doublesided impacts in unloaded and lightly loaded gearing drives. Planetary gears with only backlash errors are compared to those containing both backlash and tooth defects under different kinematic and loading conditions. Time domain results show that the dynamic responses due to the combination of backlash and tooth defects depend on the interaction of many components of the differential planetary system...|$|R
