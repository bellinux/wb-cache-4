5000|$|There can be many {{variations}} on the shell and tube design. Typically, the ends of each tube are connected to plenums (sometimes called water boxes) through holes in tubesheets. The tubes may be straight or bent {{in the shape of}} a U, called U-tubes. [...] In nuclear power plants called pressurized water reactors, large heat exchangers called steam generators are two-phase, shell-and-tube heat exchangers which typically have U-tubes. They are used to boil water recycled from a surface condenser into steam to drive a turbine to produce power. Most shell-and-tube heat exchangers are either 1, 2, or 4 pass designs on the tube side. This refers to the number of times the fluid in the tubes passes through the fluid in the shell. In a <b>single</b> <b>pass</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger,</b> the fluid goes in one end of each tube and out the other. [...] Surface condensers in power plants are often 1-pass straight-tube heat exchangers (see Surface condenser for diagram). Two and four pass designs are common because the fluid can enter and exit on the same side. This makes construction much simpler. There are often baffles directing flow through the shell side so the fluid does not take a short cut through the shell side leaving ineffective low flow volumes. These are generally attached to the tube bundle rather than the shell in order that the bundle is still removable for maintenance.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the common}} {{assumptions}} in basic design theory is that fluid be distributed uniformly at the inlet of the exchanger on each side fluid side and through out the core. However, in practice, flow maldistribution is more common and significantly reduces the desired heat exchanger performance. Maldistribution is the nonuniform distribution of mass flow rate on one or both fluid sides in the heat exchanger core. The major feature of gross flow maldistribution is that non uniform flow occurs at the macroscopic level due to poor header design or blockage of some flow passages during manufacturing, including brazing or operation. Maldistribution causes {{a significant increase in}} heat exchanger pressure drop and some reduction in heat transfer rate. In this study, the commercial computational fluid dynamic (CFD) package, Fluent was utilized for modeling the tubular <b>single</b> <b>pass</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> with different tube arrangements namely four tube in-line arrangement, two tube in-line arrangement and square pitch tube arrangement. In each arrangement both flow maldistribution and uniform mass flow distribution are considered. In heat transfer terminology there appear two mean temperatures namely crosssectional mean temperature and adiabatic mean temperature. The cross-sectional temperature is the arithmetic mean of all tube side temperatures and the adiabatic mean temperature is weighted mean of tube side temperatures. The purpose of this investigation is to study the cross sectional mean temperature and adiabatic mean temperature profiles in the computational domain, tubular <b>single</b> <b>pass</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> for flow maldistribution or uniform mass flow distribution on tube side and ideal plug flow on shell side. It is investigated that for uniform mass flow distribution on tube side and ideal plug flow on shell side, there is no difference the cross-sectional mean temperature and adiabatic mean temperature. But for maldistribution with out back flow on tube side and ideal plug flow on shell side, the two mean temperatures have same value at the cross-section ξ= 0. For maldistribution with back flow on tube side and ideal plug flow on shell side, the temperature jump occurs {{at the beginning of the}} calculation domain. viA large computational effort is involved for the memory access of the computers and computing time for the simulation of the complex geometries associated with the dense grids. The available computational fluid dynamics software package FLUENT is applied to determine the related problems.

These streams will contain entrained solvent. A {{significant portion of the}} Strip Effluent (SE) pipeline (i. e., acid stream containing Isopar{reg_sign} L residues) length is within one inch of a sludge stream. Personnel envisioned the sludge stream temperature may reach 100 C during operation. The nearby SE stream may receive heat from the sludge stream and reach temperatures that may lead to flammability issues once the contents of the SE stream discharge into a larger reservoir. To this end, personnel used correlations from the literature to estimate the maximum temperature rise the SE stream may experience if the nearby sludge stream reaches boiling temperature. Several calculation methods were used to determine the temperature rise of the SE stream. One method considered a heat balance equation under steady state that employed correlation functions to estimate heat transfer rate. This method showed the maximum temperature of the acid stream (SE) may exceed 45 C when the nearby sludge stream is 80 C or higher. A second method used an effectiveness calculation used to predict the heat transfer rate in <b>single</b> <b>pass</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> By envisioning the acid and sludge pipes as a parallel flow pipe-to-pipe heat exchanger, this method provides a conservative estimation of the maximum temperature rise. Assuming the contact area (i. e., the area over which the heat transfer occurs) is the whole pipe area, the results found by this method nearly matched the results found with the previous calculation method. It is recommended that the sludge stream be maintained below 80 C to minimize a flammable vapor hazard from occurring...|$|E

Hence, it is important to develop simulation strategies for plate <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> accurately. This analysis represents the dynamic behaviour of the <b>single</b> <b>pass</b> plate <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers,</b> considering flow maldistribution from port to channel. In addition to maldistribution the fluid axial dispersion is used to characterise the back mixing and other deviations from plug flow. Due to unequal distribution of the fluid, the velocity of the fluid varies from channel to channel and hence the heat transfer coefficient variation is also taken into consideration. Solutions to the governing equations have been obtained using the method of Laplace transform followed by numerical inversion from frequency domain. The results are presented on the effects of flow maldistribution and conventional <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> parameters on the temperature transients of both U-type and Z-type configurations. It is found that the effect of flow maldistribution is significant and it deteriorates the thermal performance as well as the characteristic features of the dynamic response of the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> In contrast to the previous studies, here the axial dispersion describes the inchannel back mixing alone, not maldistribution, which is physically more appropriate.

With {{the introduction of new}} HFC refrigerants to replace CFC refrigerants, the understanding and modeling of heat transfer coefficient characteristics is important in designing more efficient evaporators for refrigeration and air conditioning applications. In the present work experimental data for two-phase {{evaporation heat}} transfer of refrigerant R- 134 a in a plate <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> (Yan and Lin, 1999 b) is compared with relevant published correlations (Yan and Lin, 1999 b; Kandlikar, 1991) in order to explore a proposed correlation scheme to best predict the data set. Experimental data for the evaporation heat transfer of refrigerant R- 134 a in a plate <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> could only be found published by Yan and Lin (1999 b). Their work utilizes a <b>single</b> <b>pass</b> plate <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger,</b> consisting of three plates, to collect two-phase flow data. In the present work, resulting correlations proposed by Yan and Lin (1999 b) are found to have large discrepancies from the data for both a single-phase water-to-water experiment and the two-phase experiment for evaporation heat transfer coefficient of refrigerant R- 134 a in a plate <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> Research of other literature revealed the Kandlikar (1991) model for correlating flow boiling heat transfer in augmented tubes and compact evaporators to have relevance in the present study. In the present work one correlation for the single-phase water-to-water experiment, and two correlation schemes for the two-phase refrigerant R- 134 a experiment are proposed which best fit the experimental data presented by Yan and Lin (1999 b) for the plate <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> The new single-phase correlation provides an accurate prediction to the data. The first proposed two-phase correlation utilizes augmentation factors similar to those proposed by Kandlikar (1991). Results for this correlation are within 17 % of the experimental data. Augmentation factors are ignored in the second proposed two-phase correlation, which predicts the data within 16 %. Both correlations provide better results than the Kandlikar model (Kandlikar, 1991), which predicts the data within 20 % for vapor quality between 0. 2 and 0. 8, and the correlation proposed by Yan and Lin (1999 b), which yields a large discrepancy from the data. The second improved two-phase correlation shows only nominal improvement over the first, and lacks a theoretical base.

40|$|Much of {{research}} and development work has been dedicated to implement the heat and mass transfer using microchannel technology; however, it is not yet cost effective and is limited to higher end applications such as electronics cooling and selected applications in automotive and aircraft <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers.</b> The work on mass transfer application of micro channels also has been very limited, despite the very high potential contribution of micro channels for mass transfer enhancement. Scaling up of microchannel equipment presents several manufacturing and process organization challenges such as flow distribution inside microchannels, cost, fouling, high pressure drops etc. This thesis presents the development of a cost effective and compact tubular manifold microchannel <b>heat</b> and mass <b>exchanger</b> (MMHX) for industrial applications. A novel design for the flow distribution manifolds has been proposed. The proposed manifold helps in the enhancement of heat and mass transfer by creating better flow mixing. The MMHX is designed {{in such a way that}} the manifold causes the flow to break into multiple passes of very short flow lengths in the microchannels. These flow lengths are short enough such that the flow in the channels is always into entry zone (developing laminar zone) both hydrodynamically as well as thermally, resulting in higher heat transfer than that in the fully developed laminar flow in conventional microchannel <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers.</b> The pressure drop in the device is low as the fluid flow length into the microchannels is very short. While the manifold design helps in flow distribution, very short flow length inside the microchannels mitigates the problems of flow instability of two-phase heat transfer applications such as that in evaporators and condensers. The mass transfer in gas liquid reaction applications is enhanced due to the multiple passes where continuous breaking of the gas liquid interface as well as mixing of the bulk liquid occurs. A multi-pass microchannel <b>heat</b> and mass <b>exchanger</b> prototype was designed, fabricated and was experimentally tested for the performance as liquid-liquid <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger,</b> evaporator, condenser and gas- liquid absorber. Experiments were carried out by changing the liquid and gas flow rates, geometry of the microchannels and the size of the manifold. Flow visualization studies were also performed to study two phase flow distribution and flow pattern in the manifold. Experimental results have shown that the mass transfer coefficient (using CO 2 and DEA-water solution) for the microchannel absorber is 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than the conventional absorber. This increase in mass transfer is mainly attributed to high interfacial area to volume ratio of microchannels and good mixing in the manifold. Similarly, heat transfer coefficient for the single phase heat transfer as well as for two phase heat transfer (evaporator and condenser) is about 3 to 8 times higher than the conventional <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> such as shell and tube or plate type <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> High transfer rates enable us to design compact heat and mass transfer devices for the industrial applications. Industrial processes, such as carbon capture, which are not economically viable due to their high cost, can be feasible with the development of these next generation heat and mass transfer equipment. Due to the simplicity of the component design and the assembly, cost of the industrial scale equipment can be substantially lower as compared other compact <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers.</b> Current work is the continuation of heat and mass transfer work being carried out at the S 2 TS lab in University of Maryland.
