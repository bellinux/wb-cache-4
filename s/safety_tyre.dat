40|$|Tyre wear is {{a complex}} phenomenon. It depends non-linearly on {{numerous}} parameters, like tyre compound and design, vehicle type and usage, road conditions and road surface characteristics, environmental conditions (e. g., temperature) and many others. Yet, tyre wear has many economic and ecological implications. The possibility to predict tyre wear is therefore of major importance to tyre manufacturers, fleet owners and governments. Analogous observations {{can be made for}} road wear prediction due to the high road maintenance costs and traffic <b>safety</b> implications. <b>Tyre</b> and road wear are strongly related; the energy that wears the road is the energy that wears the tyre. There is therefore much to gain from an integrated approach to studying the mechanisms behind both wear phenomena. Based on these observations, in 2000 we started the three-year 5 th framework EU project TROWS (Tyre and ROad Wear and Slip assessment). The results include tools to analyse tyre wear and road polishing. These will be combined in a suitable wear prediction environment. This paper focuses on the followed methods and results sofar of TROWS for truck tyre wear. Several types of tests were performed to obtain insight in the mechanisms behind the truck tyre wear phenomenon. These include material tests on tyre compounds, carousel tests with truck tyres, and tests with an articulated MAN truck on a public road course in Italy. Truck tyre wear mechanisms are presented and explained in relation to results from the performed tyre wear tests. Some modelling activities are discussed, as well as the wear prediction environment (Prolinx) that was developed to integrate the vast amount of test and modelling results from partners working at different locations with different tools. The relation between tyre and road wear is briefly touched upon. A discussion on the remaining challenges in predicting tyre wear concludes this paper...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, the Finite Element (FE) Analysis of {{aircraft}} tyres is presented. The modelling and simulations of detailed construction of tyre enable tyre manufacturers to evaluate new designs and development before a prototype is fabricated, and aim {{to reduce the}} research costs and efforts to optimise the current tyre design of tyres. The material properties is key in the FE modelling and analysis, a number of sample from the rubber compounds and reinforcement were used to characterise the elastic, hyperelastic and viscoelastic behaviour of material. In this research, two aircraft tyres were employed for correlation study {{to a number of}} design checks and standard tests such as profile growth, sidewall deformation, footprint, contact pressure, and load-deformation data. The burst simulation was carried out to investigate when and where the failure in tyre occurs and compares it with what happens in real-world burst test as an important procedure in <b>tyre</b> <b>safety</b> certification by aviation authorities. As a result, the virtual testing would shorten the design procedure by checking the design parameters in advance of tyre prototyping. Moreover, the FE parameters such as mesh size and tyre geometry are investigated for optimisation of the runtime and accuracy and improvements in the FE results. A number of simulations were run to determine generated forces and moments across the contact patch using a steady-state approach in presence of air as the tyre inflator to obtain a higher accuracy in prediction of the vertical stiffness and footprint area. In addition, the tyre was freely rolled on the runway using an explicit approach to investigate the energy dissipation and heat build-up per tyre rotation due to the tyre viscoelasticity. Finally, TAIS (Tyre Analysis Interface System) development is explained in response to the design requirements from Dunlop Aircraft Tyres...|$|R
40|$|In aircraft, {{the main}} landing gear wheels skid on the runway {{at the moment of}} {{touchdown}} because of high slip. A slipping tyre generates enough heat to melt its rubber. Melted rubber is easily eroded by the friction force between the tyre and runway; and part of eroded rubber stays on the runway, and other is burnt off as smoke. Since the early days of airplane use, a number of ideas have been patented to improve <b>tyre</b> <b>safety</b> and decrease the substantial wear and smoke during every landing by spinning the gear wheels before touchdown. In this thesis, there are three parts of research work. First part is to find the effectiveness of the technique of pre-spinning the wheel to reduce the tyre tread heat and wear, and then choosing the initial wheel rotation speed that prevent the tread rubber from melting temperature. For achieving this, a coupled structural – thermal transient analysis in ANSYS has been used to model a single wheel {{main landing gear}} as a mass-spring system. This model has been chosen to analyze the wheel’s dynamic behaviour and tyre tread temperature and wear during the short period from static to a matching free-rolling velocity in which the wheel is forced to accelerate by the friction between the tyre and ground. The tyre contact surface temperature and wear have been calculated for both the initially static and pre-spun wheels in order to compare the temperature and wear levels for different initial rotation speeds. In the second part, the required torque to spin the aircraft wheel to the required angular speed at approach speed has been calculated using ANSYS CFX, which is used to determine the wheel aerodynamic forces developed by simulation of fluid flows in a virtual environment. In the last part, several types of wind turbines have been simulate...|$|R

40|$|The Institute for Road Safety Research SWOV {{carried out}} an {{inspection}} of the tyres of approximately 6000 cars in the Netherlands during November 1976 {{in order to measure}} their tread-depths. The sample was taken at the parking lots of roadside restaurants, motels, and modern shopping centres and showed a slight bias in favour of newer cars. By weighting the sample a representative picture was obtained for all cars used on the roads. The weighting was carried out using data from the monthly car survey of the central bureau of statistics in the Netherlands. The percentage of cars with smooth tread tyres was much smaller than obtained by other inspections of select samples. Only 1. 3 per cent of the cars had one or more tyres with a tread-depth of less than 1 mm (the legal minimum); a further 4. 9 per cent had one or more tyres with a tread-depth of 1 to 1. 6 mm. These percentages were slightly lower than the results which the SWOV obtained in 1974 during a comparable inspection. There are indications that the situation in 1979 hardly differs from that in 1976. Although the percentage of smooth tread tyres is small, the annual number of fatal and injury accidents in the Netherlands would decline by about 500 if all tyres with a tread-depth of less than 1. 6 mm were to be replaced. The SWOV emphasizes that an insufficient tread-depth is not the only tyre aspect which threatens the safety of car occupants. Other tyre characteristics which can {{have a negative effect on}} road <b>safety</b> are: low <b>tyre</b> pressure, dried-out tyres, holes and tears, irregular wear, and combining diagonal-ply and radial-ply tyres on the same car...|$|R
40|$|One {{important}} part of driver education is to convince the candidates to use the safety equipment in the car such as safety belts and airbags in a correct manner. If there is an accident, the injuries will be less severe if the safety equipment are not only used but also used in a correct way. There are, however, findings showing that there are gaps in the current driver education {{when it comes to}} convincing candidates to use safety equipment. At some of the skid tracks in Sweden, an additional educational concept has been developed that is focusing on convincing drivers to use the safety equipment in the car. The concept is named "Safety halls" where the main aim is to provide knowledge about the different safety equipment of the car and how it should be used in order to create highest possible safety. Candidates doing the mandatory skid training at these skid tracks will also attend this new training. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the possible effects of safety halls on the candidates' knowledge, attitudes and self reported behaviour regarding the areas <b>safety</b> belts, <b>tyres,</b> sitting posture, load, airbag, and speed. The study was carried out at the eight skid tracks in Sweden that had a safety hall at the time of the evaluation. At all skid tracks, candidates were randomly distributed into an experiment group (skid training and safety hall) and a control group (only skid training). At the arrival to the skid track all candidates filled out a questionnaire (before measurement). The same candidates also filled out the same questionnaire directly after finishing the education programme (after measurement 1). Four and a half months later a similar questionnaire was sent by post to the same candidates (after measurement 2). A total of 1, 326 candidates (658 in the experiment group and 668 in the control group) filled out all three questionnaires and thus formed the sample for the overall analyses. In the questionnaires, questions were asked about background factors such as age, gender, highest education in the family etc. There were also knowledge questions, attitude questions and questions about self reported behaviour. In general, the findings show that the extra education in safety halls increases the knowledge, improves the attitudes about traffic safety and strengthen the intentions to behave safe. The improvements are largest when measured directly after the education, but effects still remain after 4 ½ months. Some of the areas covered shows better results (in the experiment group compared to the control group) than others. Above all, the two areas safety belts and load showed the best results on knowledge, attitudes and intentions, both in a short and long term. The evaluation has also shown that there is a need for improvement of the current education in the safety halls if the expected effects should be improved...|$|R
5000|$|At the 2015 Belgian Grand Prix, during practice, Rosberg {{suffered}} a dangerous tyre delamination at 200 mph. Rosberg said {{the incident was}} [...] "quite a shock". During the subsequent drivers briefing double world champion Lewis Hamilton, raised concerns in about <b>tyre</b> <b>safety</b> following the high-speed blow-out suffered by team-mate Nico Rosberg. Concerns were also brought up by four-time world champion Vettel, and double world champion Alonso. Pirelli relied on race director, Charlie Whiting, to defend Pirelli's record in the meeting. During the race a tyre on Vettel's car suffered from a blowout at 200 mph. The four time world champion described the failure an [...] "unacceptable", and added that Pirelli's tendency to blame failures either on debris on track or a driver going over a kerb for tyre failures was incorrect, confirming that [...] "I didn't go off the track {{and out of the}} blue the tyre explodes". Following the race Rosberg was critical of the poor quality of Pirelli tyres, saying [...] "Vettel exploding his tyre is really poor. It shouldn't happen and that it keeps on happening, in other categories as well and today with us, and with me on Friday both of us were just so lucky". The Grand Prix Drivers' Association chairman said: [...] "We need to stop the sudden explosions." [...] Immediately after the race Pirelli claimed that excessive wear caused the blowout, blaming Ferrari for running the tyre too long. However, following a more detailed analysis Pirelli said that in fact wear was not to blame, but instead a cut had caused the tyre failure. To counteract further problems at the next Grand Prix, Monza, Pirelli wanted to insist that teams run the tyres at high pressure, beyond their design parameters. However, double world champion Lewis Hamilton described these rules as a [...] "disaster" [...] and double world champion Fernando Alonso described them as [...] "strange" [...] so Pirelli was forced to backtrack on their proposal. After these comments, Pirelli attempted to censor the drivers by asking them to not criticise the tyres in public in the future.|$|R
