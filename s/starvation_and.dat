40|$|Investigations {{into the}} genetic basis of {{longevity}} variation have shown life span to be {{positively correlated with}} <b>starvation</b> resistance <b>and</b> negatively with female fecundity, both of which rely on lipid content. To assess the firmness of this relation, we assayed correlated responses in age-specific relative fat content (RFC) <b>and</b> <b>starvation</b> resistance in lines successfully selected for divergent virgin life span. We have previously demonstrated that genetic differentiation in female fecundity between our selection lines had disappeared during relaxation of selection. Therefore, we also expected genetic differences in lipid content <b>and</b> <b>starvation</b> resistance to have disappeared. However, RFC <b>and</b> <b>starvation</b> resistance were still significantly lower in short-lived flies than in control flies. Surprisingly, also in long-lived flies RFC <b>and</b> <b>starvation</b> resistance were mostly, but not invariably, {{found to be significantly}} lower than in control flies. These results indicate that the genetic correlation of RFC <b>and</b> <b>starvation</b> resistance with reproduction has broken down. Furthermore, the relationship between life span <b>and</b> <b>starvation</b> resistance appears to be more complex than previously anticipated. Also, we could demonstrate that differences in RFC were not brought about by differences in lipid accumulation during adult life, but were already present at eclosion.

5|$|Modern {{scholars}} thus generally {{attribute the}} numbers {{given in the}} ancient sources to the result of miscalculations or exaggerations {{on the part of}} the victors, or disinformation by the Persians in the run up to the war. The topic has been hotly debated but the modern consensus revolves around the figure of 300,000500,000. Nevertheless, whatever the real numbers were, it is clear that Xerxes was anxious to ensure a successful expedition by mustering overwhelming numerical superiority by land and by sea, and also that much of the army died of <b>starvation</b> <b>and</b> disease, never returning to Asia.|$|E

5|$|Where {{pelicans}} {{interact with}} fishers, through either {{sharing the same}} waters or scavenging for fishing refuse, they are especially vulnerable to being hooked and entangled in both active and discarded fishing lines. Fish hooks are swallowed or catch in {{the skin of the}} pouch or webbed feet, and strong monofilament fishing line can become wound around bill, wings or legs, resulting in crippling, <b>starvation,</b> <b>and</b> often death. Local rescue organisations have been established in North America and Australia by volunteers to treat and rehabilitate injured pelicans and other wildlife.|$|E
5|$|A {{different}} {{school of}} thought developed {{almost half a century}} later, with palaeontologist David Weishampel suggesting that the skeletons from the lower layers stemmed from a herd that died catastrophically in a mudflow, while those in the upper layers accumulated over time.

This theory was erroneously attributed to Seemann in a popular account of the plateosaurs {{in the collection of the}} Institute and Museum for Geology and Palaeontology, University of Tübingen, and has since become the standard explanation on most internet sites and in popular books on dinosaurs. Rieber proposed a more elaborate scenario, which included the animals dying of thirst or <b>starvation,</b> <b>and</b> being concentrated by mudflows.|$|E

5|$|After Germany {{occupied}} Hungary in March 1944, the genocidal {{policies of}} the authorities were applied comprehensively. Hungarian Jews were subjected to <b>starvation</b> <b>and</b> death marches, and those that had remained {{in the occupied territories}} were transported to extermination camps. From 26 April 1944, the remaining Jews in Bačka and Baranja, mostly women, but including children and the elderly, were rounded up into local concentration camps then moved to larger camps in Hungary proper. Between 14,000 and 15,000 Jews from Bačka, Baranja and other parts of Hungary were collected at Baja and Bácsalmás then transported to Auschwitz where most were killed. In September 1944, the workforce of the Bor mine was force-marched for several weeks back to extermination camps where the survivors were killed. One of the two groups of workers numbered 2,500, but only a few survived.|$|E
5|$|Although the 9th Corps Army {{was one of}} China's elite formations, {{composed}} of veterans and former POWs from the Huaihai Campaign, several deficiencies hampered its ability during the battle. Initially the 9th Army {{was intended to be}} outfitted in Manchuria during November, but Mao suddenly ordered it into Korea before that could happen. As the result, the 9th Corps Army had almost no winter clothing for the harsh Korean winter. Similarly, poor logistics forced the 9th Corps Army to abandon heavy artillery, while working with little food and ammunition. The food shortage forced the 9th Corps Army to initially station a third of its strength away from the Chosin Reservoir as reserve, and <b>starvation</b> <b>and</b> exposure broke out among the Chinese units since foraging was not an option at the sparsely populated reservoir. By the end of the battle, more Chinese troops had died from the cold than from combat and air raids.|$|E

5|$|During the Japanese {{occupation}} of Hong Kong, the Japanese army committed atrocities against civilians and POWs, {{such as the}} St. Stephen's College massacre. Local residents also suffered widespread food shortages, limited rationing and hyper-inflation arising from the forced exchange of currency from Hong Kong dollars to Japanese military banknotes. The initial ratio of 2:1 was gradually devalued to 4:1 and ownership of Hong Kong dollars was declared illegal and punishable by harsh torture. Due to <b>starvation</b> <b>and</b> forced deportation for slave labour to mainland China, the population of Hong Kong had dwindled from 1.6 million in 1941 to 600,000 in 1945, when the United Kingdom resumed control of the colony on 2 September 1945.|$|E
5|$|Fearing the Greeks might {{attack the}} bridges across the Hellespont and trap his army in Europe, Xerxes now retreated {{with much of}} the Persian army back to Asia, though nearly all of them died of <b>starvation</b> <b>and</b> disease on the return voyage.

However, under pressure from the Athenians, the Peloponnesians eventually agreed to try to force Mardonius to battle, and they marched on Attica. Mardonius retreated to Boeotia to lure the Greeks into open terrain, and the two sides eventually met near the city of Plataea. At the Battle of Plataea, the Greek army won a decisive victory, destroying much of the Persian army and ending the invasion of Greece. Meanwhile, at the near-simultaneous naval Battle of Mycale, they also destroyed much of the remaining Persian fleet, thereby reducing the threat of further invasions.|$|E
5|$|Healthy {{pelicans}} {{can usually}} {{cope with their}} lice, but sick birds may carry hundreds of individuals, which hastens their demise. The pouch louse Piagetiella peralis, which occurs in the pouch and therefore cannot be removed by preening, is usually not a serious problem, even when present in such numbers that it covers the whole interior of the pouch, but sometimes inflammation and bleeding may harm the host. The brown pelican has a similarly extensive range of parasites. The nematodes Contracaecum multipapillatum and C. mexicanum and the trematode Ribeiroia ondatrae have caused illness and mortality in the Puerto Rican population, possibly endangering the pelican on this island.

40|$|Malnutrition is an {{umbrella}} term that includes <b>starvation,</b> sarcopenia, <b>and</b> cachexia; however, differentiating between these terms is infrequent in clinical practice. Given that {{the effectiveness of}} treatment depends on the aetiology of unintentional weight loss, {{it is important that}} clinicians are aware of the defining characteristics. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether Australian dietitians understand and use the terms <b>starvation,</b> sarcopenia, <b>and</b> cachexia and provide targeted treatment strategies accordingly. Members of the Dietitians Association of Australia were surveyed to gain information on practices and attitudes to diagnosis and treatment of adult malnutrition. In addition, three case studies were provided to examine understanding of <b>starvation,</b> sarcopenia, <b>and</b> cachexia. 221 dietitians accessed the survey. 81 respondents (43 %) indicated the use of at least one alternate term (starvation, sarcopenia, and/or cachexia). Muscle wasting was the most commonly used diagnostic criterion. High-energy high-protein diet was the most common therapy prescribed. Correct diagnoses for case studies were recorded by 6 % of respondents for starvation, 46 % for sarcopenia, and 21 % for cachexia. There is a need for increased awareness of the existence of <b>starvation,</b> sarcopenia, <b>and</b> cachexia amongst Australian dietitians and research into appropriate methods of identification and treatment for each condition...|$|R
40|$|Background & aims: Clinical {{signs of}} malnutrition, <b>starvation,</b> {{cachexia}} <b>and</b> sarcopenia overlap, {{as they all}} imply muscle wasting to a various extent. However, the underlying mechanisms differ fundamentally and therefore distinction between these phenomena has therapeutic and prognostic implications. We aimed to determine whether dietitians in selected European countries have 'sufficient knowledge' regarding malnutrition, <b>starvation,</b> cachexia <b>and</b> sarcopenia, and use these terms in their daily clinical work. Methods: An anonymous online survey was performed among dietitians in Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. 'Sufficient knowledge' was defined as having mentioned {{at least two of}} the three common domains of malnutrition according to ESPEN definition of malnutrition (2011) : 'nutritional balance', 'body composition' and 'functionality and clinical outcome', and a correct answer to three cases on <b>starvation,</b> cachexia <b>and</b> sarcopenia. Chi-square test was used to analyse differences in experience, work place and number of malnourished patients treated between dietitians with 'sufficient knowledge' vs. 'less sufficient knowledge'. Results: 712 / 7186 responded to the questionnaire, of which data of 369 dietitians were included in the analysis (5 %). The term 'malnutrition' is being used in clinical practice by 88 % of the respondents. <b>Starvation,</b> cachexia <b>and</b> sarcopenia is being used by 3 %, 30 % and 12 % respectively. The cases on <b>starvation,</b> cachexia <b>and</b> sarcopenia were correctly identified by 58 %, 43 % and 74 % respectively. 13 % of the respondents had 'sufficient knowledge'. 31 % of the respondents identified all cases correctly. The proportion of respondents with 'sufficient knowledge' was significantly higher in those working in a hospital or in municipality (16 %, P < 0. 041), as compared to those working in other settings (7 %). Conclusions: The results of our survey among dietitians in four European countries show that the percentage of dietitians with 'sufficient knowledge' regarding malnutrition, <b>starvation,</b> cachexia <b>and</b> sarcopenia is unsatisfactory (13 %). The terms <b>starvation,</b> cachexia <b>and</b> sarcopenia are not often used by dietitians in daily clinical work. As only one-third (31 %) of dietitians identified all cases correctly, the results of this study seem to indicate that nutrition-related disorders are suboptimally recognized in clinical practice, which might have a negative impact on nutritional treatment. The results of our study require confirmation in a larger sample of dietitians. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism. All rights reserved...|$|R
