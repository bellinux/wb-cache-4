40|$|Minimum {{miscibility}} pressure (MMP), {{which plays}} an important role in miscible flooding, is a key parameter in determining whether crude oil and gas are completely miscible. On the basis of 210 groups of CO 2 -crude oil <b>system</b> <b>minimum</b> miscibility pressure data, an improved CO 2 -crude oil <b>system</b> <b>minimum</b> miscibility pressure correlation was built by modified conjugate gradient method and global optimizing method.

Compared to the eleven most popular and relatively high-accuracy CO 2 -oil system MMP correlations in the previous literature by other nine groups of CO 2 -oil MMP experimental data, which have not been used to develop the new correlation, it is found that the new empirical correlation provides the best reproduction of the nine groups of CO 2 -oil MMP experimental data with a percentage average absolute relative error (%AARE) of 8 % and a percentage maximum absolute relative error (%MARE) of 21 %, respectively...|$|E

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of convective system populations in West Africa {{and the western}} Pacific tropical cyclone basin were analyzed to investigate whether interannual variability in convective activity in tropical continental and oceanic environments is driven by variations {{in the number of}} events during the wet season or by favoring large and/or intense convective systems. Convective systems were defined from TRMM data as a cluster of pixels with an 85 GHz polarization-corrected brightness temperature below 255 K and with an area at least 64 km 2. The study database consisted of convective systems in West Africa from May Sep for 1998 - 2007 and in the western Pacific from May Nov 1998 - 2007. Annual cumulative frequency distributions for <b>system</b> <b>minimum</b> brightness temperature and system area were constructed for both regions. For both regions, there were no statistically significant differences among the annual curves for <b>system</b> <b>minimum</b> brightness temperature. There were two groups of system area curves, split by the TRMM altitude boost in 2001. Within each set, there was no statistically significant interannual variability. Sub-setting the database revealed some sensitivity in distribution shape {{to the size of the}} sampling area, length of sample period, and climate zone. From a regional perspective, the stability of the cumulative frequency distributions implied that the probability that a convective system would attain a particular size or intensity does not change interannually.
