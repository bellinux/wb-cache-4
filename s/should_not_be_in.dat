5|$|In 1803, Secretary of War Henry Dearborn {{appointed}} Scott and Governor James Garrard {{to evaluate}} sites in Kentucky {{on which to}} construct a replacement for Fort Washington. Garrard, a central Kentucky native, insisted that the fort should be built at Frankfort. Scott disagreed, contending that the fort <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the state's interior and that the hilly terrain around Frankfort was unsuitable for constructing a fort. He waited several days for an appointment with Garrard to try and reach an agreement, {{but when he was}} unable to secure one, he asked Dearborn for permission to act alone. Dearborn granted the request and accepted Scott's recommendation of a site in Newport, Kentucky. In 1804, Scott was again chosen a presidential elector with minimal opposition.|$|E

25|$|With {{the arrival}} of the P-61 Black Widow, it was decided to move the school to California. This would situate the school closer to the Northrup {{manufacturing}} plant at Hawthorne, and was more efficient because the new squadrons programmed for Operational Training would be deploying to either the Pacific or CBI Theaters and would depart from the US west coast. In addition, the Air Staff had decided that the School of Applied Tactics <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the training business, although the SCR-720 radar training program would remain at Orlando due to its proximity to the basic Radar School at Boca Raton Army Airfield. The 481st NFOTU and its training squadrons were moved to Hammer Field, near Fresno California on 1 January 1944 and were placed under Fourth Air Force IV Fighter Command.|$|E
25|$|In Japan, {{especially}} within conservative {{media outlets}} (the most vocal ones being Sankei Shimbun and Bungei Shunju), {{it is argued}} that countries which oppose commercial whaling altogether <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the IWC at all and allege that the anti-whaling side has subverted the purpose of the IWC by exploiting the (lack of) membership requirements. Moreover, they point out that the anti-whaling lobby within the IWC are also led by wealthy developed nations and are equally susceptible to accusations of vote-buying and influence-peddling. The anti-whaling side within IWC are accused of using conservation as a cover for their ideological opposition to whaling itself, which mirrors the accusation from the anti-whaling side that Japan's scientific whaling is a cover for commercial whaling. Since 2000, 29 new countries have joined the IWC, 18 of them pro-whaling, 11 anti. Japan notes that major anti-whaling nations such as the U.S. Australia, UK and New Zealand also donate aid to poor countries on the IWC and wield far more influence than Japan alone and thus they could easily be accused of the same tactics. Moreover, Japan is pushing to have secret ballot voting. Had the allegations of vote-buying been true, such proposal would run counter to its alleged objective because it is impossible to monitor so called client members' vote. From Japan's point of view, secret ballot voting {{is the only way to}} counter the influence pedling of anti whaling side which Japan see as having more powerful collective influence within the IWC. One of the new 2006 members, Israel, voted consistently with the anti-whaling bloc, was asked specifically to join by the US. Belize, a country previously accused of having their vote bought and paid for by Japan by a number of countries and NGO's, shifted side and consistently voted with the anti-whaling block at the 2006 IWC meeting. Anti-whaling nations oppose secret ballot voting on the grounds that it is without precedent in other international bodies and would have removed accountability and made behind-the-scenes deals between delegations more likely. St Kitts and Nevis Commissioner, Cedric Liburd, pointed out to various anti whaling counties during debate on the secret ballot vote on the first day of the 2006 meeting in St Kitts that it was extremely hypocritical of such countries to pontificate on the need for transparency within the IWC by open voting when such countries quite happily voted via secret ballot in CITES, a similar management body.|$|E

500|$|In 1930, Australia toured England once more. Before the Test series, Chapman {{was not a}} {{unanimous}} choice among press correspondents; several critics believed he <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the team {{on account of his}} rapidly increasing weight—former England captain Pelham Warner suggested he needed to lose at least two stone—and concern over his poor batting form. However, Chapman began the season well, impressing commentators with his batting, fielding and captaincy, and was named as England captain for the first Test match. In the first innings, he scored 52 in 65 minutes, and England won the match by 93 runs on the fourth day. The Wisden correspondent wrote: [...] "Chapman, with his resources limited, managed his bowling well and himself fielded in dazzling fashion." [...] This was Chapman's sixth successive victory over Australia and he had won all nine of the Tests in which he was captain. However, it was to be his last Test victory.|$|E
500|$|Jed Gottlieb of the Boston Herald argues that, {{although}} Is This It provided substantial musical influence, {{its biggest}} success was in revamping {{the music industry}} and making A delegates scout and promote alternative bands. Gunn links the success of alternative music in British charts throughout the 2000s to the album, but notes that [...] "the copyists" [...] could never match the attention to detail and heartfelt emotion of the Strokes. Mulholland adds that even the pop stars of that decade who rediscovered disco, electro, and synthpop owe a debt to the record, because its commercial success [...] "made every forgotten art-pop experiment of the late 70s and early 80s instantly hip and ripe for reinvention". Hamish MacBain of NME writes that [...] "the western world has moved on, and is now swinging {{to the tune of}} Is This It", while Pitchforks Joe Colly suggests that [...] "you only capture this kind of a lightning in a bottle once". Gunn concludes that, while the status of the album as the 2000s' most influential guitar record may be [...] "a double-edged sword" [...] because of poor quality copyists, its status as the decade's best pop album <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> doubt.|$|E
500|$|The {{session on}} 25 April was almost cancelled, due to Jones {{becoming}} ill from colitis. Beforehand, {{it had been}} agreed that this session would be dedicated to transferring their previously recorded, 4-track recordings onto Studio 3's newer 8-track machine, for further overdubs in later sessions. At Jones' suggestion, and despite warnings the producer had received that Barrett <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the studio unaccompanied. Barrett went in on his own {{to carry out the}} mixing. It had been decided that nearly all of the tracks that were recorded up to that point needed further overdubbing except for [...] "No Man's Land" [...] and [...] "Here I Go". At this point, Barrett considered placing [...] "Opel" [...] on the album, Jones calls it among Barrett's [...] "best and most haunting" [...] songs. On the session for 3 May, three tracks on the album were overdubbed by Robert Wyatt, Hugh Hopper and Mike Ratledge, all members of the band Soft Machine: The three songs were [...] "Love You", (now dropping [...] "It's") [...] "No Good Trying", and [...] "Clowns and Jugglers". Even after the Soft Machine members added overdubs to [...] "Clowns and Jugglers", Barrett wished to add bass and drums to it.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{generally}} responded warmly to the episode, {{but some}} felt it compared poorly {{to others in}} the series. David Chater, writing for The Times, felt that [...] "The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge" [...] was dissimilar from any previous episode of Inside No. 9, but that it was [...] "equally accomplished", while in sister publication The Sunday Times, critics suggested that the change in style showed the writers' versatility. Neela Debnath, writing for The Independent, called [...] "The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge" [...] a [...] "hilariously dark little half-hour of quintessentially British comedy". Rupert Hawksley, writing for The Daily Telegraph, was more critical. He awarded [...] "The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge" [...] three out of five stars, saying that [...] "despite a starry cast and a delightful twist and counter-twist, [...] was nothing like as effective" [...] as [...] "La Couchette" [...] and [...] "The 12 Days of Christine", the previous two episodes of the series. The episode, he claimed, was indicative of a [...] "mid-series lull". The freelance journalist Dan Owen felt the episode was [...] "entertaining fare, but too predictable and clichéd to prove genuinely memorable", awarding it two out of four stars. He, too, said the episode felt like [...] "a mid-series misstep". Shearsmith was unhappy with those who thought the episode a [...] "dud" [...] or a [...] "misfire", confessing that it was his favourite episode of the second series. Pemberton felt {{it was going to be}} difficult to follow [...] "The 12 Days of Christine", but Shearsmith was of the view that the episodes <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> competition with each other.|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding Manhunt reached a peak on July 28, 2004, {{when the game}} {{was linked to the}} murder of 14-year-old Stefan Pakeerah by his 17-year-old friend Warren Leblanc in Leicestershire, England. Initial media reports claimed that police had found a copy of the game in Leblanc's bedroom, which police had seized as evidence, and Giselle Pakeerah, the victim's mother, stated [...] "I think that I heard some of Warren's friends say that he was obsessed by this game. To quote from the website that promotes it, it calls it a psychological experience, not a game, and it encourages brutal killing. If he was obsessed by it, it could well be that the boundaries for him became quite hazy." [...] Stefan's father, Patrick, added [...] "they were playing a game called Manhunt. The way Warren committed the murder this is how the game is set out, killing people using weapons like hammers and knives. There is some connection between the game and what he has done." [...] Patrick continued [...] "The object of Manhunt is not just to go out and kill people. It's a point-scoring game where you increase your score depending on how violent the killing is. That explains why Stefan's murder was as horrific as it was. If these games influence kids to go out and kill, then we do not want them in the shops." [...] A spokesman for the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers' Association (ELSPA) responded to the accusations by stating [...] "We sympathize enormously with the family and parents of Stefan Pakeerah. However, we reject any suggestion or association between the tragic events and the sale of the video game Manhunt. The game in question is classified 18 by the British Board of Film Classification and therefore its copies <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the possession of a minor. Simply being in someone's possession does not and should not lead to the conclusion that a game is responsible for these tragic events." ...|$|E

[...] This implies that he will try to take advantage of Meg and when she arrives at Quagmire's house, it seems even more likely; he tells her to sit down and says [...] "Soon it'll all become clear", puts on seductive music, dims the lights, strips down to a speedo and sits down beside her; but suddenly, Quagmire (uncharacteristically) begins to have a serious heart-to-heart talk with Meg, telling her that her entire life is still ahead of her and she <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> such a hurry to grow up before assuring her that she will find the right person one day. To help Meg, Quagmire gives her his copy of The Missing Piece to help give her a better perception of things, and sends her away feeling much better.
