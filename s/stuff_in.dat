It turned into a stratified thing 'cause we were mixing everything together all the way through. There was no plan. – John Power.|$|E

They made many of the Italian dry cured salted meats such as salame (Cured or cooked <b>stuffed</b> <b>in</b> an intestine casing), capocollo (cured neck meat made spicy and non spicy), mortadella (Cooked, baloney like meat with large fat chunks), zampino (Cooked, salami like meat, <b>stuffed</b> <b>in</b> the pork skin of the leg casing rather than an intestine casing), testa (head cheese.

25|$|Another {{flagship}} programme, {{the long-running}} quiz show, University Challenge was originally aired between 1962 and 1987. It was revived by the BBC in 1994 (produced by Granada). The company produced The Krypton Factor, between 1977 and 1995 (revived by ITV in 2009). One of Granada's longest-running programmes, What The Papers Say, was broadcast by Granada in 1956, {{was taken over}} by the BBC in the early 1990s, and was shown by Channel 4. The programme introduced the idea of discussing what the newspapers were reporting, continued by Sunday Supplement and The Wright <b>Stuff.</b> <b>In</b> the 1970s, Granada produced situation comedies, often based around life in the north west including Nearest and Dearest, The Lovers and The Cuckoo Waltz, followed by Brothers McGregor and Watching in the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Cooper's accomplishments (along {{with his}} widely noted and {{appealing}} personality) were {{depicted in the}} 1983 film The Right <b>Stuff</b> <b>in</b> which he was portrayed by actor Dennis Quaid. Cooper {{worked closely with the}} production company on this project and reportedly, every line uttered by Quaid is attributable to Cooper's recollection. Quaid met with Cooper before the casting call and rapidly learned his mannerisms. Quaid also had his hair cut and dyed to match how the former astronaut's hair looked during the 1950s and 1960s. Cooper was later depicted in the 1998 HBO miniseries From the Earth to the Moon, in which his character was played by Robert C. Treveiler. Cooper appeared as himself in an episode of the television series CHiPs and during the early 1980s made regular call-in appearances on Late Night with David Letterman. The Thunderbirds character Gordon Tracy was named after him.|$|E

25|$|I {{have not}} seen Chas. Greville's book, but have read {{a good deal of}} it. It is a social outrage. And {{committed}} by one who was always talking of what he called ‘perfect gentlemen.’ I don't think he can figure now in that category. I knew him intimately. He was the vainest being—I don't limit myself to man—that ever existed; and I don't forget Cicero and Lytton Bulwer; but Greville wd. swallow garbage, and required it. Offended selflove is a key to most of his observations. He lent me a volume of his MS. once to read; more modern than these; I found, when he was not scandalous, he was prolix and prosy—a clumsy, wordy writer. The loan was made à propos of the character of Peel, which I drew in George Bentinck's Life, and which, I will presume to say, is the only thing written about Peel wh. has any truth or <b>stuff</b> <b>in</b> it. Greville was not displeased with it, and as a reward, and a treat, told me that he wd. confide to me his character of Peel, and he gave me the sacred volume, wh. I bore with me, with trembling awe, from Bruton St. to Grosr Gate. If ever it appears, you, who have taste for style and expression, will, I am sure, agree with me that, as a portrait painter, Greville is not a literary Vandyke or Reynolds; a more verbose, indefinite, unwieldy affair, without a happy expression, never issued from the pen of a fagged subordinate of the daily press.|$|E

500|$|Filming {{commenced}} on 20 August 1968 after {{a summer}} of pre-production. Director Ken Turner, who headed the location unit, recalled that The Secret Service became a complex series to shoot because it incorporated three design elements (studio puppet filming, studio special effects filming and live-action location filming). In a reversal to the practice used on earlier Supermarionation productions, location filming needed to be completed first before work could start at the Century 21 Studios. In Turner's words, [...] "We felt that somebody {{had to take the}} location stuff by the balls, get it shot and then hand it over to the director to fit his puppet <b>stuff</b> <b>in.</b> I suppose that seemed a bit back to front but with that programme it was what worked out best." ...|$|E
