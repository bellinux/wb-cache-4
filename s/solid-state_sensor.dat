40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the image receptors' influence on exposure levels, image accuracy, and quality for periodontal diagnosis. Periodontal defects from cadaver specimens were imaged using two intra-oral conventional films (E-, F/E-speed), four indirect receptors (Digora 8  bit, Vistascan 12  bit with/without filter, Vistascan 16  bit), and two <b>solid-state</b> <b>sensors</b> (Sigma 12  bit, VistaRay 14  bit) at rising exposure (20 - 160  ms). Three observers assessed the standardized radiographs for alveolar bone measurements (1, 732, 31 sites) and for subjective rating of lamina dura, contrast, trabecularization, crater, and furcation involvements. The measurements were compared to the gold standard. For the imaging plates, highest measurement accuracy was found with Vistascan 16  bit (100 % within 0. 5  mm) and for <b>solid-state</b> <b>sensors</b> with VistaRay 14  bit (100 %, 0. 5  mm), although the latter are mostly not significantly different. Higher contrast resolution imaging plates require up to 50 % less exposure time, but for <b>solid-state</b> <b>sensors,</b> the dose remains unchanged. For the latter, a higher bit depth does seem to provide more accurate depiction of the alveolar crest, counteracting blooming artifacts. The use of a dedicated periodontal filter contributes to higher accuracy at all exposure times (p[*]<[*] 0. 05 - 0. 0001). Accuracy of periodontal diagnosis increases with higher contrast resolution. Digital exposure levels are thus dependent of image receptor as well as X-ray generator. status: publishe...|$|R

30|$|In silicon based <b>solid-state</b> <b>sensor</b> image acquisition, when a {{photo-diode}} receives {{too much}} radiant energy, {{the maximum number}} of electrons per pixel is reached [20]. This refers to saturation, and extra information is lost. In addition, the overloaded photo-site distributes charges into adjacent pixels, generating blooming (especially for CCD technology) [21, 22]. On the other hand, if a photo-diode does not receive sufficient photons, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the electrical signal generated is too low compared to the global noise level [23]. Thus, when integration time is fixed, the sensor performance is optimal only within a given range of intensities according to its sensitivity. In a gray-level intensity sensor, pixels have a similar sensitivity and it is relatively easy to set an optimal integration time [24, 25].|$|E
