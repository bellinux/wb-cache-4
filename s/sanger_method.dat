The subsequent development of chain-termination DNA sequencing in 1977 by Frederick Sanger improved the efficiency of sequencing {{and turned it into a}} routine laboratory tool. An automated version of the <b>Sanger</b> <b>method</b> was used in early phases of the Human Genome Project.|$|E
25|$|By May 1983 Mullis {{synthesized}} oligonucleotide probes for {{a project}} at Cetus to analyze a sickle cell anemia mutation. Hearing of problems with their work, Mullis proposed an alternative technique based on Sanger's DNA sequencing method. Realizing the difficulty in making the <b>Sanger</b> <b>method</b> specific to a single location in the genome, Mullis then modified the idea to add a second primer on the opposite strand. Repeated applications of polymerase {{could lead to a}} chain reaction of replication for a specific segment of the genome – PCR.|$|E
25|$|An {{expressed}} sequence tag (EST) is a short {{nucleotide sequence}} generated from a single RNA transcript. RNA is first copied as complementary DNA (cDNA) by a reverse transcriptase enzyme before the resultant cDNA is sequenced. The <b>Sanger</b> <b>method</b> of sequencing was predominant until the advent of high-throughput methods such as sequencing by synthesis (Solexa/Illumina). Because ESTs don't require prior knowledge of the organism from which they come, {{they can also be}} made from mixtures of organisms or environmental samples. Although higher-throughput methods are now used, EST libraries commonly provided sequence information for early microarray designs, for example, a barley GeneChip was designed from 350,000 previously sequenced ESTs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sanger</b> <b>methods</b> achieve read {{lengths of}} {{approximately}} 800bp (typically 500-600bp with non-enriched DNA). The longer read lengths in <b>Sanger</b> <b>methods</b> display significant advantages over other sequencing methods especially {{in terms of}} sequencing repetitive regions of the genome. A challenge of short-read sequence data is particularly an issue in sequencing new genomes (de novo) and in sequencing highly rearranged genome segments, typically those seen of cancer genomes or in regions of chromosomes that exhibit structural variation.|$|R

25|$|Studies of {{individual}} transcripts were being performed several decades before any transcriptomics approaches were available. Libraries of silkmoth mRNAs were collected and converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) for storage using reverse transcriptase {{in the late}} 1970s. In the 1980s, low-throughput Sanger sequencing began {{to be used to}} sequence random individual transcripts from these libraries, called Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs). The <b>Sanger</b> <b>method</b> of sequencing was predominant until the advent of high-throughput methods such as sequencing by synthesis (Solexa/Illumina). ESTs came to prominence during the 1990s as an efficient method to determine the gene content of an organism without sequencing the entire genome. Quantification {{of individual}} transcripts by Northern blotting, nylon membrane arrays, and later Reverse Transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) were also popular, but these methods are laborious and can only capture a tiny subsection of a transcriptome. Consequently, the manner in which a transcriptome as a whole is expressed and regulated remained unknown until higher-throughput techniques were developed.|$|E
25|$|For {{much of its}} history, the {{technology}} underlying shotgun sequencing was the classical chain-termination method or 'Sanger method', {{which is based on}} the selective incorporation of chain-terminating dideoxynucleotides by DNA polymerase during in vitro DNA replication. Recently, shotgun sequencing has been supplanted by high-throughput sequencing methods, especially for large-scale, automated genome analyses. However, the <b>Sanger</b> <b>method</b> remains in wide use, primarily for smaller-scale projects and for obtaining especially long contiguous DNA sequence reads (>500 nucleotides). Chain-termination methods require a single-stranded DNA template, a DNA primer, a DNA polymerase, normal deoxynucleosidetriphosphates (dNTPs), and modified nucleotides (dideoxyNTPs) that terminate DNA strand elongation. These chain-terminating nucleotides lack a 3'-OH group required for the formation of a phosphodiester bond between two nucleotides, causing DNA polymerase to cease extension of DNA when a ddNTP is incorporated. The ddNTPs may be radioactively or fluorescently labelled for detection in DNA sequencers. Typically, these machines can sequence up to 96 DNA samples in a single batch (run) in up to 48 runs a day.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to his seminal work on the amino acid sequence of insulin, Frederick Sanger and his colleagues {{played a key role}} in the development of DNA sequencing techniques that enabled the establishment of comprehensive genome sequencing projects. In 1975, he and Alan Coulson published a sequencing procedure using DNA polymerase with radiolabelled nucleotides that he called the Plus and Minus technique. This involved two closely related methods that generated short oligonucleotides with defined 3' termini. These could be fractionated by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel (called polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and visualised using autoradiography. The procedure could sequence up to 80 nucleotides in one go and was a big improvement, but was still very laborious. [...] Nevertheless, in 1977 his group was able to sequence most of the 5,386 nucleotides of the single-stranded bacteriophage φX174, completing the first fully sequenced DNA-based genome. The refinement of the Plus and Minus method resulted in the chain-termination, or <b>Sanger</b> <b>method</b> (see below), which formed the basis of the techniques of DNA sequencing, genome mapping, data storage, and bioinformatic analysis most widely used in the following quarter-century of research. In the same year Walter Gilbert and Allan Maxam of Harvard University independently developed the Maxam-Gilbert method (also known as the chemical method) of DNA sequencing, involving the preferential cleavage of DNA at known bases, a less efficient method. For their groundbreaking work in the sequencing of nucleic acids, Gilbert and Sanger shared half the 1980 Nobel Prize in chemistry with Paul Berg (recombinant DNA).|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} {{investigation}} of microbial genomics, {{it was difficult}} and costly to obtain sequence information for any pathogen. In 1995, the first pathogen genome, that of Haemophilus influenza, was sequenced by traditional <b>Sanger</b> <b>methods.</b> <b>Sanger</b> <b>methods,</b> however, were slow and costly. The emergence of second-generation high-throughput sequencing technologies has allowed for microbial sequence information to be obtained much more quickly and at a considerably lower cost. Largely thanks to second-generation sequencing methods, {{tens of thousands of}} pathogen genomes have been sequenced since 1995. The emergence of second-generation high-throughput sequencing technologies has allowed for microbial sequence information to be obtained much more quickly and at a considerably lower cost. This influx of information is also due to the capacity of sequencing platforms to generate the sequences of many organisms in parallel.|$|R

50|$|Dideoxynucleotides are chain-elongating inhibitors of DNA polymerase, {{used in the}} <b>Sanger</b> <b>method</b> for DNA sequencing. They {{are also}} known as 2',3' dideoxynucleotides, and {{abbreviated}} as ddNTPs (ddGTP, ddATP, ddTTP and ddCTP).|$|E

5000|$|Allan Maxam and Walter Gilbert {{published}} a DNA sequencing method in 1977 based on chemical modification of DNA and subsequent cleavage at specific bases.

50|$|The chain-termination method {{developed}} by Frederick Sanger and coworkers in 1977 soon became {{the method of}} choice, owing to its relative ease and reliability.

25|$|Traditional DNA {{sequencing}} {{techniques such}} as Maxam-Gilbert or <b>Sanger</b> <b>methods</b> used polyacrylamide gels to separate DNA fragments differing by a single base-pair in length so the sequence could be read. Most modern DNA separation methods now use agarose gels, except for particularly small DNA fragments. It is currently most often used {{in the field of}} immunology and protein analysis, often used to separate different proteins or isoforms of the same protein into separate bands.
