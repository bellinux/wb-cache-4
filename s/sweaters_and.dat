5|$|Before the Beatles {{achieved}} nationwide {{success in}} Britain, Epstein had permitted a company (run by his cousins and initially catering to fan club members), to produce Beatles' sweaters for 30 shillings (£1.50) and badges for 6 pence (6d) (2½p). It sold 15,000 <b>sweaters</b> <b>and</b> 50,000 badges as the group's popularity grew. When Beatlemania swept the UK in November 1963, Epstein was besieged by novelty goods companies desperate {{to use the}} Beatles' name on plastic guitars, drums, disc racks, badges, belts and other merchandise. Epstein refused to allow the Beatles to endorse any product directly, but through NEMS Enterprises he granted discretionary licences to companies {{who were able to}} produce quality products at a fair price, even though many companies were already selling products without a licence.|$|E

25|$|With the {{involvement}} of future Olympian Stacy Wilson, various women at Acadia University formed a women's hockey team in 1984. There was no varsity hockey team at the university so the team was a club team. The team wore used Acadia varsity men's hockey <b>sweaters,</b> <b>and</b> raised funds {{to play in a}} few tournaments. Wilson and her teammates were part of two Nova Scotia provincial championships. In addition, the Acadia club team represented Nova Scotia at the Women's National Championship in 1986 and 1987.|$|E

The shop manager eventually got close to the Gambinos, and officials were able to plant a bug in their office. The Gambinos, rather than being charged with extortion – which was hard to prove – were charged with antitrust violations. Joseph and Thomas Gambino, the latter being an extremely high-ranking member, and two other defendants took the deal and avoided jail by pleading guilty, paying $12 million in fines and agreeing {{to stay out of}} the business.|$|E

25|$|Since 1805 was a {{bad year}} for fishing, he instead took loads of coal from Suðuroy across the Atlantic to Bergen and Copenhagen, trying to open up direct trading, but was {{prevented}} from importing goods to the Faroes by the Danish Royal Trade Monopoly authorities. Instead, by vaccinating members of his crew successively using material from the previous man, he succeeded in bringing the first smallpox vaccine back to the Faroes, {{and with the help}} of one of his brothers spread vaccination through the islands. The following year, after again attempting to trade directly, he was convicted and fined on two charges of contravention of the trading laws, but cleared of smuggling goods back to the Faroes, having sold them to a Swedish ship in the Kattegat. He reacted by counter-suing the Tórshavn district sheriff, Joen Christiansen Øre, for large-scale smuggling; the Monopoly officials appear to have been conducting personal trading on the side. However, he seems to have dropped the lawsuit. In 1807, after a year's effort to overcome refusals by the local government in the Faroes and by the Monopoly, he sailed to Copenhagen on Royndin Fríða as one of a deputation of five presenting a popularly supported proposal for a three-year experimental lifting of the trade restrictions. They had to illegally sell 2,600 knitted <b>sweaters</b> <b>and</b> other merchandise to a Norwegian merchant to finance the voyage, but Crown Prince Frederick, who was governing as regent for his father, and others in Copenhagen were sympathetic, and trade would have been opened up if war with England had not begun.|$|E
25|$|On the Canadian home front, {{there were}} {{many ways in which}} women could {{participate}} in the war effort. Not only did women help raise money; they rolled bandages, knitted socks, mitts, <b>sweaters,</b> <b>and</b> scarves for the men serving overseas. Women raised money to send cigarettes and candy overseas and comfort the fighting men. Canadian women were encouraged to marshal support for the war by persuading wives and mothers to allow their men and sons to enlist. During the war, an immense amount of pressure was laid on women to do their part. One of women’s largest contributions to the war was in the form of voluntary organisations. Through different organisations women volunteered millions of hours of unpaid labour. One of the biggest organisations that middle class women participated in was the Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire. The IODE strongly advocated imperialist sentiment. By World War I the IODE was of the largest Canadians women’s voluntary associations. The IODE organised writing competitions to raise awareness of the war and bring patriotic feeling to Canadian children. Lois Allan joined the Farm Services Corps in 1918, to replace the men who were sent to the front. Allan was placed at E.B. Smith and Sons where she hulled strawberries for jam. Jobs were opened up at factories as well, as industrial production increased. Work days for these women consisted of ten to twelve hours, six days a week. Because the days consisted of long monotonous work, many women made of parodies of popular songs to get through the day and boost morale. Depending on the area of Canada, some women were given a choice to sleep in either barracks or tents at the factory or farm that they were employed at.|$|E

I've always been an 8"); and one about your mother's tastes in clothes ("I don't understand, you could look so good if you tried").

500|$|Until late 1959, Fischer [...] "had dressed atrociously for a champion, {{appearing}} {{at the most}} august and distinguished national and international events in <b>sweaters</b> <b>and</b> corduroys." [...] A director of the Manhattan Chess Club had once banned Fischer for not being [...] "properly accoutered", forcing Denker to intercede to get him reinstated. Now, encouraged by Pal Benko to dress more smartly, Fischer [...] "began buying suits {{from all over the}} world, hand-tailored and made to order." [...] He told journalist Ralph Ginzburg that he had 17 hand-tailored suits and that all of his shirts and shoes were handmade.|$|E
500|$|... "Dinner Party" [...] {{was written}} by Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky. Other writers for the series also added various {{background}} gags to the episode, such as Andy wearing two <b>sweaters</b> <b>and</b> holding a coat, all of the photos in the condo being of Jan with other men, and Michael's garage having both a Soloflex and a Bowflex back to back because [...] "Michael is completely taken by late-night infomercials". The song featured in the episode supposedly performed by Jan's former assistant, Hunter, {{was written by}} the episode writers Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky and Todd Fancey of The New Pornographers; Eisenberg and Stupnitsky wrote the lyrics, and Fancey wrote the music. The song was sung by Fancey. Eisenberg and Stupnitsky later explained that, despite the suggestive lyrics, the song is [...] "left to interpretation".|$|E
500|$|Time Team {{was first}} {{broadcast}} in 1994, and would attract around four million viewers per episode, with Aston becoming [...] "an icon to the viewing public."

Aston acted as chief archaeological {{adviser to the}} programme {{until the end of}} series nineteen, starring in almost every episode, although he would later comment that when it first started he had no idea it would continue for so long. Aston enjoyed working with the Time Team crew, commenting that they were [...] "a great gang... There are some real party people." ...|$|E

She returned to stripping {{in the small town}} of McMinnville, Oregon, where she was recognized by customers at the bar. This prompted Love to go into isolation, so she relocated to Anchorage, Alaska, where she lived for three months to [...] "gather her thoughts," [...] supporting herself by working at a strip club frequented by local fishermen. [...] "I decided to move to Alaska because I needed to get my shit together and learn how to work", she said in retrospect. [...] "So I went on this sort of vision quest. I got rid of all my earthly possessions. I had my bad little strip clothes and some big <b>sweaters,</b> <b>and</b> I moved into a trailer with a bunch of other strippers." ...|$|E
500|$|Johnson's {{performance}} {{has also been}} praised. In 2004, ESPN released {{a list of the}} top 100 Simpsons sport moments, ranking his appearance at number 27. Sports Illustrated listed Johnson's cameo as the fifth best athlete guest appearance on The Simpsons. Meyers wrote that the episode [...] "makes a lot of good points about the public making heroes in a rash, hysterical manner," [...] and this point is made [...] "with an amusing cameo by Earvin 'Magic' Johnson". The San Diego Unions Fritz Quindt said the animators [...] "did [...] likeness good," [...] and noted that in the game the [...] "colors on the Lakers jerseys and the Forum court were correct. Chick Hearn and Stu Lantz were almost lifelike, announcing at courtside in Sunday-color-comics <b>sweaters.</b> <b>And</b> Chick's play-by-play was so real Stu couldn't get a word in." [...] Johnson's appearance was broadcast on CNN's Sports Tonight the day before the episode originally aired, and host Fred Hickman stated that he did not find it humorous.|$|E
500|$|When UGA renewed {{its program}} in 1919, their student body staged a parade which mocked Tech's {{continuation}} of football {{during times of}} war. The parade featured a tank-shaped float marked [...] "Argonne" [...] with a sign [...] "Georgia in France 1917" [...] followed by an automobile with three people in Tech <b>sweaters</b> <b>and</b> caps bearing a sign [...] "Tech in Atlanta". A printed program was subsequently distributed in the stands with a similar point. While the Tech faculty was able to prevent a riot, no apology was made, and this act led directly to Tech cutting athletic ties with UGA and canceling several of UGA's home football games at Grant Field (UGA commonly used Grant Field as its home field). [...] Tech and UGA did not compete in athletics until the 1921 Southern Conference basketball tournament. Despite intense pressure on Tech to make amends, Matheson stated {{that he would never}} change his mind unless [...] "due apologies" [...] were offered, and if he was overruled, he would resign. Regular season competition did not renew until after Matheson's retirement, in a 1925 agreement between the two institutions negotiated by athletic directors J. B. Crenshaw and S. V. Sanford.|$|E
