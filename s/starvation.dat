5|$|Almost {{all of the}} {{men died}} of thirst or <b>starvation,</b> or were killed.|$|E
5|$|Camden County Coroner Robert J. Blake ruled {{her death}} an accident; {{a case of}} <b>starvation</b> with {{exposure}} as a contributing factor. A spokesman for the coroner said Barker became trapped in the closet, and died of fright and <b>starvation.</b> Due to {{a hole in the}} closet, she could not have suffocated.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the civilians}} {{died because of}} {{deliberate}} genocide, massacres, mass-bombings, disease, and <b>starvation.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to eliminating Jews, the Nazis also planned {{to reduce the}} population of the conquered territories by 30 million people through <b>starvation</b> in an action called the Hunger Plan. Food supplies would be diverted to the German army and German civilians. Cities would be razed and the land allowed to return to forest or resettled by German colonists. Together, the Hunger Plan and Generalplan Ost would have led to the <b>starvation</b> of 80 million people in the Soviet Union. These partially fulfilled plans resulted in the democidal deaths of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|Players must eat, {{drink and}} sleep, to avoid <b>starvation,</b> {{dehydration}} and exhaustion; {{failure to do}} so confers a steady decrease in certain skills and eventually leads to death if untreated.|$|E
5|$|The study {{provided}} {{valuable insights}} into hunger and <b>starvation</b> {{and the results}} were made available to all major relief agencies concerned with postwar food and nutrition problems, helping to inspire the Marshall Plan.|$|E
5|$|An RNA {{thermometer}} (or RNA thermosensor) is a temperature-sensitive non-coding RNA molecule which regulates gene expression. RNA thermometers often regulate genes required during {{either a}} heat shock or cold shock response, {{but have been}} implicated in other regulatory roles such as in pathogenicity and <b>starvation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another theory {{states that}} {{chromosomal}} toxin-antitoxin systems {{are designed to}} be bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal. RelE, for example, is a global inhibitor of translation during nutrient stress, and its expression reduces the chance of <b>starvation</b> by lowering the cell's nutrient requirements. A homologue of mazF toxin called mazF-mx is essential for fruiting body formation in Myxococcus xanthus.|$|E
5|$|Between 1939 and 1945, the Schutzstaffel (SS), {{assisted}} by collaborationist governments and recruits from occupied countries, {{was responsible for}} the deaths of at least eleven million people, including 5.5 to 6 million Jews (representing two-thirds of the Jewish population of Europe), and between 200,000 and 1,500,000 Romani people. Deaths took place in concentration and extermination camps, ghettos, and through mass executions. Many victims of the Holocaust were gassed to death, while others died of <b>starvation</b> or disease or while working as slave labourers. In addition to eliminating Jews, the Nazis planned to reduce the population of the conquered territories by 30 million people through <b>starvation</b> in an action called the Hunger Plan. Food supplies would be diverted to the German army and German civilians. Cities would be razed and the land allowed to return to forest or resettled by German colonists. Together, the Hunger Plan and Generalplan Ost would have led to the <b>starvation</b> of 80 million people in the Soviet Union. These partially fulfilled plans resulted in the democidal deaths of an estimated 19.3million civilians and prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|Camp {{survivor}} Simone Veil {{was later}} elected President of the European Parliament, serving from 1979–82. Two Auschwitz victims—Maximilian Kolbe, a priest {{who volunteered to}} die by <b>starvation</b> {{in place of a}} stranger, and Edith Stein, a Jewish convert to Catholicism—were later named saints of the Roman Catholic Church.|$|E
5|$|For {{twenty-four years}} the Indonesian {{government}} subjected {{the people of}} East Timor to routine and systematic torture, sexual slavery, extrajudicial executions, massacres, and deliberate <b>starvation.</b> The 1991 Santa Cruz Massacre caused outrage around the world, and reports of other such killings were numerous.|$|E
5|$|In 1944 and 1945, as the German {{situation}} deteriorated, {{provision of}} food to POW camps became more sporadic and <b>starvation</b> became a problem. As Soviet troops advanced westwards, camps in the east were evacuated and moved on foot, in so-called death marches, away from the front in extremely poor conditions.|$|E
5|$|In AD 1525 {{the city}} was {{attacked}} by Spanish conquistadors under Gonzalo de Alvarado y Contreras during a siege that lasted several months. Kayb'il B'alam, the city's last ruler, finally surrendered to the Spanish due to <b>starvation.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, the M. schencki prefers {{to feed the}} P. rebeli during times of food shortage. Thus, in periods of <b>starvation,</b> P. rebeli {{caterpillars}} overall exhibit a higher survival rate {{than those of the}} M. schencki larvae.|$|E
5|$|Senator Joseph S. Clark's and Senator Robert F. Kennedy's {{tour of the}} Mississippi Delta {{occurred}} on April 10, 1967. At the behest of civil rights lawyer Marian Wright, Clark and Kennedy, together with two other Senators, traveled to Mississippi to investigate reports of extreme poverty and <b>starvation.</b> Following a field hearing, they drove from Greenville to Clarkesdale, stopping and touring impoverished communities as they went. Deeply disturbed by what they saw, the senators returned to Washington D.C. and began pushing {{for a series of}} reforms to alleviate the situation. Extensive media coverage of the event exposed the American public to real instances of malnutrition and <b>starvation.</b> The country was shocked and hunger became an important topic nationwide as people began looking for solutions. Efforts by the government and political action groups ultimately resulted in the problem being largely reduced by the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The {{citizens}} of the society act as the player's primary resource. Keeping them healthy, happy and well-fed are pivotal to making the town prosper. Hazards in the game {{come in the form}} of harsh weather conditions, fires, depression, <b>starvation,</b> and an ageing population.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{condition of}} the country had deteriorated so drastically that recovery to pre-conflict levels was not achieved until 1925. The most acute crisis was in the food supply, already deficient in 1917, though <b>starvation</b> had been avoided in southern Finland. According to the Red and White militants, the Civil War would solve all past problems, but instead the power struggle led to <b>starvation</b> in southern Finland too. Late in 1918, Finnish politician Rudolf Holsti appealed for relief to Herbert Hoover, the American chairman of the Committee for Relief in Belgium: Hoover arranged for food shipments and persuaded the Allies to relax their blockade of the Baltic Sea, which had obstructed food supplies to Finland, to allow the food in.|$|E
5|$|The {{food supply}} of the country {{depended}} on cereals produced in southern Russia, while the Finns had specialized in milk and butter production. The cessation of the cereal imports from disintegrating Russia led to food shortages in Finland. The Senate responded by introducing rationing and price controls. The farmers opposed the state control; a black market with sharply rising food prices formed and export to free market of the Petrograd area increased. Food supply, prices, {{and in the end}} the fear of <b>starvation</b> became emotional political issues between farmers and industrial workers, in particular the unemployed ones. The common people, their fears exploited by the politicians and the political media, took to the streets. Despite the food shortages, no large-scale <b>starvation</b> hit southern Finland before the civil war and the food market remained a secondary stimulator in the power struggle of the Finnish state.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{increases}} in force, breaking the mast, tearing the sails and flooding the hold. All four manage to survive by lashing {{themselves to the}} hull. As the storm abates, they find themselves safe for the moment, but without provisions. Over the following days, the men face death by <b>starvation</b> and thirst.|$|E
5|$|World War II was {{the deadliest}} {{conflict}} in human history, marked by 50 million to 85 million fatalities, {{most of which}} were civilians in the Soviet Union and China. It included massacres, the deliberate genocide of the Holocaust, strategic bombing, <b>starvation,</b> disease and the first use of nuclear weapons in history.|$|E
5|$|A Saxon–Prussian {{alliance}} {{fought the}} War of the Bavarian Succession (July 1778 – 21 May 1779) against the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy {{to prevent the}} Habsburgs from acquiring the Electorate of Bavaria. Although the war consisted {{of only a few}} minor skirmishes, thousands of soldiers died from disease and <b>starvation,</b> earning the conflict the name Kartoffelkrieg (Potato War) in Prussia and Saxony; in Habsburg Austria, it was sometimes called the Zwetschgenrummel (Plum Fuss).|$|E
5|$|A few adult beetles may {{overlap between}} {{the spring and}} summer populations, but most adults from the earlier {{emergence}} die before the end of summer. Both adult and larval tansy beetles are unble to detect their host plant, or each other, at a distance, either by smell, sight or a combination of the two. <b>Starvation</b> is thus likely to be a major contributor to mortality when beetles wander away from their host and become lost.|$|E
5|$|As a prisoner, he battled <b>starvation,</b> {{receiving}} {{only a small}} meal of mush {{served in}} a tin cup—a utensil he kept {{for the rest of}} his life. With a weight below , Buckles developed beriberi, and led fellow captives in calisthenics to counter the effects of imprisonment. Their captors showed little mercy, but Buckles was allowed to grow a small garden, which he often used to help feed children who were imprisoned there.|$|E
5|$|Conservation {{measures}} have included attempts to breed them in captivity {{and to reduce}} fatalities to young at their natural nesting sites. Nearly 15% of the chicks are killed when they fall off the nests and die of <b>starvation,</b> so some conservationists have used nets positioned below the nests to prevent injuries to falling young and then raising these fallen birds in enclosures for about five months before releasing them to join their wild siblings.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{suspicion}} of foul play, the death was ruled an accident; {{a case of}} <b>starvation</b> and exposure as Barker was unable to escape the closet. Investigators concluded that Barker died on February 28, three days after her disappearance. As a result, the mayor ordered closet doors to open more easily. The press surrounding the Barker case also led to the first calls about the Boy in the Box.|$|E
5|$|Diseases, accidents, hunters, automobiles, and <b>starvation</b> are {{the other}} leading causes of death. Juveniles show high {{mortality}} shortly after leaving their mothers, while still perfecting their hunting techniques. One study of 15 bobcats showed yearly survival rates for both sexes averaged 0.62, in line with other research suggesting rates of 0.56 to 0.67. Cannibalism has been reported; kittens may be taken when prey levels are low, but this is very rare and does not much influence the population.|$|E
5|$|During the American Revolution, border raids from British-allied Iroquois tribes harried the {{settlers}} on the frontier. George Washington ordered Sullivan's Expedition, Rangers, to enter Central New York and suppress the Iroquois threat. More than 40 Iroquois villages were destroyed and their winter stores, causing <b>starvation.</b> In {{the aftermath of}} the war, numerous European-American settlers migrated into the state and this western region from New England, especially Connecticut.|$|E
5|$|During the Malayan Emergency (1948–1960), Britain was {{the first}} nation to employ the use of {{herbicides}} and defoliants to destroy bushes, trees, and vegetation to deprive insurgents of concealment and targeting food crops {{as part of a}} <b>starvation</b> campaign in the early 1950s. A detailed account of how the British experimented with the spraying of herbicides was written by two scientists, E.K. Woodford of Agricultural Research Council's Unit of Experimental Agronomy and H.G.H. Kearns of the University of Bristol.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the landing}} at Saidor, the Japanese elected to retreat rather than fight, and withdrew over {{the foothills of}} the rugged Finisterre Range. For the Japanese {{soldiers}} involved, the march was a nightmare, as they struggled through the jungles, across the swollen rivers, and over cliffs and mountains. Men succumbed to fatigue, disease, <b>starvation,</b> drowning, and even exposure, the nights in the Finisterres being bitterly cold. Hampered by the rugged terrain, inclement weather, signal failures, misunderstandings, over-caution, and above all the resolute and resourceful Japanese, US troops were unable to prevent large numbers of the retreating Japanese from slipping past them.|$|E
5|$|For {{every seven}} {{soldiers}} who escaped through Dunkirk, {{one man was}} left behind as a prisoner of war. The majority of these prisoners were sent on forced marches into Germany. Prisoners reported brutal treatment by their guards, including beatings, <b>starvation,</b> and murder. Another complaint was that German guards kicked over buckets of water {{that had been left}} at the roadside by French civilians for the marching prisoners to drink.|$|E
5|$|Frequent {{cyclones}} also pose a threat, {{particularly to}} concentrated or small populations. In late January 1997, Cyclone Gretelle destroyed 80% of the Manombo forest canopy. With their habitat, including {{most of their}} food resources, effectively destroyed, the ruffed lemurs of the forest broadened their diet, remaining surprisingly frugivorous. Their body weights dropped and no births were reported for four years, but they managed to stave off <b>starvation.</b> This event demonstrated not only their flexibility {{in the face of}} natural disasters, which may highlight the evolutionary reasons behind their reproductive capacity and litter size, but also the threat faced by already stressed populations.|$|E
5|$|From {{the top of}} Mount Austin at , {{panoramic}} {{views of}} the north coastal plains, Savo and Florida islands, and the battlefields of World War II can be seen. The Japanese had held this hilltop {{in the second half}} of 1942 and showered artillery fire on American troops at the Henderson airfield below the hill. Eventually the hill was captured but the Japanese held on to the Gifu, Sea Horse, and Galloping Horse ridges for about a month. Most of the Japanese died of <b>starvation,</b> banzai assaults or direct killing.|$|E
5|$|Gertrude was {{released}} from police custody shortly after the incident. She was sent to Chicago with $7 and was never heard from again. The hydrochloric acid that Carlton ingested failed to kill him, but did badly burn his esophagus, which {{made it difficult for}} him to ingest food. Carlton was indicted on August 16 and was charged with the murder of Mamah Borthwick, the only death that was directly witnessed by a survivor. Carlton entered a not guilty plea. Forty-seven days after the fire, before the case could be heard, Carlton died of <b>starvation</b> in his cell.|$|E
5|$|Graendal's {{hiding place}} is {{traced to a}} remote palace. Confirming her presence, Rand uses the Choedan Kal, a {{powerful}} magical artifact, to eliminate the entire building with balefire, a magic that wipes the target from time. This horrifies Min and Nynaeve al'Meara and they turn to Cadsuane for help. Giving up on saving Arad Doman from the Seanchan and <b>starvation,</b> Rand returns {{to the city of}} Tear.|$|E
5|$|His campaigns conquered much French territory, but by 1374, all {{the gains}} had been lost. Edward's reign was also {{marked by the}} further {{development}} of Parliament, which came to {{be divided into two}} Houses. In 1377, Edward III died, leaving the Crown to his 10-year-old grandson Richard II. Like many of his predecessors, Richard II conflicted with the nobles by attempting to concentrate power in his own hands. In 1399, while he was campaigning in Ireland, his cousin Henry Bolingbroke seized power. Richard was deposed, imprisoned, and eventually murdered, probably by <b>starvation,</b> and Henry became king as Henry IV.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the Colony Collapse Disorder Working Group, based {{primarily}} at Pennsylvania State University, was established. Their preliminary report pointed out some patterns, but drew no strong conclusions. A survey of beekeepers early in 2007 indicated most hobbyist beekeepers believed that <b>starvation</b> {{was the leading}} cause of death in their colonies, while commercial beekeepers overwhelmingly believed invertebrate pests (Varroa mites, honey bee tracheal mites, and/or small hive beetles) were {{the leading cause of}} colony mortality. A scholarly review in June 2007 similarly addressed numerous theories and possible contributing factor, but left the issue unresolved.|$|E
