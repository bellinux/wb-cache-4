It is based on the recursive application of a <b>simple</b> <b>tile</b> sample procedure that can be implemented efficiently using rejection sampling.

40|$|AbstractThe {{first and}} third authors and others [2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] have studied sets of “tiles” (a {{generalization}} of pixels or voxels) in two and three dimensions that have a property called strong normality (SN) : For any tile P, only finitely many tiles intersect P, and any nonempty intersection of these tiles must also intersect P. This paper presents extensions of the basic results about SN sets of tiles to n dimensions. One of our results is that if SN holds for every n + 1 or fewer tiles in a locally finite set of tiles in Rn, then the entire set of tiles is SN. Other results are that SN is equivalent to hereditary local contractibility, that simpleness of a tile in an SN set of tiles is equivalent to contractibility of its shared subset, and that deletion of a <b>simple</b> <b>tile</b> in an SN set of tiles preserves the homotopy type of the union of all the tiles...|$|E

I study tilings in this context, where <b>tiles</b> have <b>simple</b> geometries and the complexity {{arises from the}} combinatorial interactions of these <b>simple</b> <b>tiles.</b> Fix a lattice in Euclidean space and let Λ denote its cells. (Here we consider the triangular lattice in R 2 and the cubic lattice in Rn.) A tile is a finite subset of Λ. Let T be a set of tiles, called a tileset. Let R be a region, a possibly infinite subset of Λ. A tiling of R by T is a collection pi of translated 1 copies of tiles in T so that the tiles τ ∈ pi are pairwise disjoint and R = τ∈pi τ. We say that R is tileable (by T) when a tiling exists. The main driving principle of my research program is that <b>simple</b> <b>tiles</b> can exhibit complex behaviors.

Based on the property, we develop an algorithm to handle the puzzle, and our algorithm succeeded to enumerate all convex shapes that can be made by the puzzle pieces.

40|$|Abstract. The tile {{assembly}} {{model has}} allowed {{the study of the}} nature’s process of self-assembly and the development of self-assembling systems for solving complex computational problems. Research into this model has led to progress in two distinct classes of computational systems: Internet-sized distributed computation, such as software architectures for computational grids, and molecular computation, such as DNA computing. The design of large complex tile systems that emulate Turing machines has shown that the tile assembly model is Turing universal, while the design of small tile systems that implement simple algorithms has shown that tile assembly can be used to build private, fault-tolerant, and scalable distributed software systems and robust molecular machines. However, in order for these types of systems to compete with traditional computing devices, we must demonstrate that fairly <b>simple</b> <b>tile</b> systems can implement complex and intricate algorithms for important problems. The state of the art, however, requires vastly complex tile systems with large tile sets to implement such algorithms. In this paper, I present SFS, a tile system that decides 3 -SAT by creating O ⋆ (1. 8393 n) nondeterministic assemblies in parallel, while the previous best known solution requires Θ(2 n) such assemblies. In some sense, this tile system follows the most complex algorithm implemented using tiles to date. I analyze that the number of required parallel assemblies is O ⋆ (1. 8393 n), that the size of the system’s tileset is 147 = Θ(1), and that the assembly time is nondeterministic linear {{in the size of the}} input. This work directly improves the time and space complexities of tile-inspired computational-grid architectures and bridges theory and today’s experimental limitations of DNA computing. ...|$|E
40|$|How {{life began}} {{is still a}} mystery. While various {{theories}} suggest that life began in deep sea volcanic vents or that a world where life consisted predominantly of RNA molecules preceded us, there is no hard evidence to give shape to the {{chain of events that}} led to cellular life. Perhaps the fundamental enigma of our origins is how life began to self-replicate {{in such a way that}} evolution could produce Earth's "endless forms most beautiful. " With the exception of biological organisms, we have no examples of self-replicating, evolving chemical systems, despite an extensive research program with the goal of identifying them. In this thesis, I construct a chemical system that is capable of the most basic self-replication and evolution. The system uses no enzymes or biological sequences, can support and replicate a combinatorial genome, and is completely autonomous. There are no fundamental obstacles to the replication by this system of much more complex sequences or to open-ended evolution. The design of the system is inspired by the work of Graham Cairns-Smith, who has proposed that life began with clay. Clays are tiny layered crystals; some clay crystals can contain one of several different patterns of atoms or molecules in each layer. The choice of patterns for the layers could be viewed as a sort of genome: it would be copied as the clay grew, and if the crystal broke, each new piece would inherit its pattern from the old piece and could replicate it in the same manner. If some patterns of layers could grow and reproduce faster than other patterns, crystals with faster-growing patterns would be selected for. Instead of the atoms or small molecules of which clay consists, I use molecules consisting of 4 - 6 interwoven, synthetic DNA strands called DNA tiles to construct crystals that replicate and evolve as Cairns-Smith imagined. While the choice of construction material was influenced by ease of use [...] in contrast to clay crystals, DNA tile crystals have been previously characterized and are easy to crystallize and image in the laboratory [...] the choice was fundamentally made because DNA tile monomers are programmable, allowing us to create novel crystal morphologies rationally. The crystals I construct, termed "zig-zag ribbons", contain a sequence of information ("a genome") in each row. Growth of the ribbon adds rows, one at time, each of which contain an arrangement of DNA tiles that encode the same information sequence as the previous row. Altering the set of tiles used to assemble ribbons allows us to alter the alphabets for and the permitted lengths of sequences that can be copied. I describe how to design tile sets that can replicate genomes with different alphabets and the kind of sequence evolution that is in theory possible with some <b>simple</b> <b>tile</b> sets. Altering the tile set can not only change the kinds of sequences that may be replicated, it can also make growth and splitting more robust. I show how to make changes to the crystals' design to prevent errors during growth and splitting and to reduce the rate of spontaneous generation of new crystals. It has been previously shown that DNA tile crystallization can be used to perform universal computation; I show that in theory crystals that can compute can undergo open-ended evolution as they try to produce more and more complex programs to take advantage of available growth resources. This mechanism is simple enough to potentially observe in the laboratory in the near future. In experiments, I demonstrate a much more basic kind of replication and evolution, in which zig-zag ribbons maintain a preference for a certain width into a second generation. This work suggests that the concept of a self-replicating chemistry is closely related to the concept of a chemistry that can store information and compute. It is only by clearly understanding how chemistry can perform these latter tasks that we can hope to understand how self-replication and evolution can occur, and by implication, understand how life might have begun. ...|$|E

There are several different types of cartograms and – for some – algorithms to automatically construct them exist.

Mosaic cartograms communicate well data that consist of, or can be cast into, small integer units (for example, electorial college votes). In addition, they allow users to accurately compare regions and can often maintain a (schematized) version of the input regions’ shapes. We propose the first fully automated method to construct mosaic cartograms. To do so, we first introduce mosaic drawings of triangulated planar graphs. We then show how to modify mosaic drawings into mosaic cartograms with low cartographic error while maintaining correct adjacencies between regions. We validate our approach experimentally and compare to other cartogram methods...|$|R
