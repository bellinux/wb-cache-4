Furthermore, it also can be decorated using patination technique, which will produced <b>colours</b> on the <b>surface</b> of metal. In Malaysia, many individuals are not recognized this patination technique. Therefore, the main practical objective of this research is to test the feasibility by introducing the alternative material' and the appropriateness of the integration ofzinc and patination technique in craft items. This research was conducted by experimental project on zinc and the surface treatment Surface treatment can be divided into two techniques, which is surface finishes and <b>surface</b> <b>colours</b> technique. There are four types of surface finishes that applied on zinc and seven techniques or recipes of patination for <b>surface</b> <b>colours.</b> Experiments on patination technique were carried out with the application of chemical onto zinc surface. The results from the experiments were used to create a craft product and as a reference materials on the application of the integrated process. A questionnaire is also been used in gathering a data on consumer knowledge and view on zinc as an alternative material and patination technique as well as their preference on craft products, patterns, surface finishes and <b>surface</b> <b>colours.</b> An interviews and observation are also utilized to establish the local craft development in terms of craft producers and items in Malaysia's market. Zinc is able to be an alternative material in producing craft items such as jewellery, household and souvenir in Malaysia. The uses of zinc in making craft items and the application of patination are simple and suitable to be practiced in craft industry either for small or medium scale. The project's findings from the research process proved that zinc can be integrated with patination technique as a decorative process in craft items. Moreover, these findings are not to compete with the current material or metal used in producing craft, but {{to pave the way for}} a new alternative material in Malaysian craft item and indirectly to up grade the economy and social challenges in the future...|$|R

These data were collected in four observing runs; two using the 3. 6 m NTT in Chile, and two using the 2. 5 m INT {{on the island of}} La Palma. From the time-series photometry rotation rates and elongations were measured, and from these constraints were placed on the bulk density and porosity of nuclei. Multi-filter imaging was performed to enable measurement of their <b>surface</b> <b>colours.</b> In addition, a large amount of ‘snap-shot’ imaging was performed during these observing runs, and taken with the time-series data is used to measure nuclei sizes. These results are compared with other data from the literature to study the general properties of JFC nuclei. A size distribution is measured which is consistent with that predicted for a population of collisional fragments, while the distribution in rotation rates is found to be flat and non-collisional. The low minimum densities measured for all comets imply that the true bulk density of nuclei is low, and the porosity is high. These properties are shown to have similar values in the Kuiper Belt Object (KBO) population, which is the supposed parent population for JFCs. The <b>surface</b> <b>colours</b> of JFCs are shown to match the blue end of the KBO distribution, and can be derived from the observed KBO distribution under the assumption of a de-reddening function that preferentially depletes the reddest surfaces...|$|R

Twenty six colour centres were selected and twenty one pairs of chromaticity difference were prepared surrounding each colour centre. Each pair was assessed using ratio method against a grey and a black background {{by a group of}} 20 normal colour vision observers. Both white and coloured lighting stimuli were used; corresponding to specifications for the solid state white lighting products and part of the MacAdam colour centres respectively. The latter defined the fundamental research for visual sensitivities known as just noticeable difference (JND). The results were used to test colour spaces and chromaticity diagrams as well as to evaluate colour difference predictions of various colour difference formulae and colour appearance models. It was found that u'v' chromaticity diagram can represent colour discrimination data for lighting colour stimuli more uniformly. Moreover, CIELUV colour difference formula performed better in predicting colour differences for lighting stimuli; especially when using black background. It performed better than CIEDE 2000 and CAM 02 -UCS formulae, which were derived based on <b>surface</b> <b>colours,</b> even though it has been shown in the previous studies that these perform well when simulating <b>surface</b> <b>colours</b> on display.

The work of this committee is limited only {{to the study of the}} <b>colour</b> appearance of <b>surface</b> <b>colours</b> and does not include the appearance of self-luminous colours, aperture colours, or comparison between different media or modes of appearance. This limitation has been imposed to find the best methods for predicting the colour appearance of objects while leaving complexities such as the cognitive interpretation of coloured stimuli for future work. The visual interpretation of non-object-colour stimuli is complex and ill-defined. The plan of work of TC 1 - 34 includes the analysis of colour appearance models using available data and the publication of these guidelines for coordinated research for additional testing of colour-appearance models. The purpose of these guidelines is to encourage researchers around the world to perform experiments that will provide useful data for evaluating the performance of colour appearance models. The guidelines are not intended to limit researchers to a prescribed experimental design, but rather to provide guidance regarding minimal data and viewing conditions that should be included in all experiments to provide useful intercomparison data. Experiments that reach beyond the minimal requirements outlined in these guidelines are certainly encouraged.

Two well-known colour constancy algorithms – the Grey-World and Gamut-Mapping – are applied to frame sequences containing significant variations in the colour temperature of the illuminant.

Sometimes nearly the totality of rays is transmitted across the surface withoutsignificant changes of direction or chromaticity, {{as in the case of}} air; sometimes only light ata certain wavelength is transmitted, as for coloured glass.Perceptually, the problem of transparency is much more challenging: both the light rayscoming from the transparent surface and those coming from the object behind it do reach thesame retinal location, triggering a single sensorial process. The system somehow maps thisinformation onto a perceptual representation of two different objects.Physical transparency was shown to be neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition forperceptual transparency.
