The efficiency of Telenomus busseolae Gahan (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) used alone or in combination with silicon fertilization was investigated for controlling the sugarcane <b>stalk</b> <b>borers</b> under field conditions. The treatments were: a combination of silicon plus multiple releases of 2, 500 T. busseolae, and multiple releases of 5, 000, 2, 500 and 1, 250 T. busseolae alone. Plots receiving no soil amendment or parasites were included as the controls. Three weeks after the first application of each treatment, 100 shoots were selected randomly from each plot {{and the percentage of}} dead heart was determined. Then, three months after the first application of parasites, the percentage of stalks damaged, the percentage of internodes bored, and the level of parasitism were determined. Finally, at harvest the percentage of stalks damaged, the percentage of internodes bored, and sugarcane quality characteristics were determined. Results indicated that the efficiency of parasitism increased when combined with an application of silicon fertilizer. The release of 2, 500 T. busseolae followed by an application of silicon fertilizer decreased dead hearts to 4 %, while 12 % dead hearts was observed in the control plots. For the combination treatment, the percentages of stalk damage were 1. 5 % and 17. 2 %, at 3 weeks and 3 months after time release, respectively. However, the percentages of stalk damage were 35. 2 % and 51 % when no treatment was applied. Cane quality was significantly higher with the application of silicon fertilizer plus the release of 2, 500 T. busseolae, followed by releasing 5, 000 Hymenoptera. The level of parasitism was also greater when parasites were released in combination with an application of silicon. We conclude that biological control by egg parasitoids can be enhanced with concurrent applications of silicon fertilizer as a soil amendment and thereby creating a more robust, Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program of <b>stalk</b> <b>borers</b> in Iranian sugarcane fields...|$|R
40|$|<b>Stalk</b> <b>borers</b> {{are highly}} {{destructive}} {{to a large}} number of important graminaceous crops all over the world. Some examples of economically important <b>stalk</b> <b>borers</b> and a general description of their life-cycle are mentioned in chapter 1. In the same chapter difficulties in controlling the insects are described. The crucial role of aestivation- diapause in the life history of tropical <b>stalk</b> <b>borers</b> is elucidated and the importance of further research on this subject is demonstrated. Aestivation-diapause in two Pyralid <b>stalk</b> <b>borers,</b> Chilopartellus (Swinhoe) and Chilo orichalcociliella (Strand) was investigated under field and laboratory conditions. The relation between diapause and climate during three consecutive years is described in chapter 2. Yearly and seasonal fluctuations in the larval and pupal populations of the two <b>stalk</b> <b>borers</b> in maize appeared to be considerable. As long as the water conditions for plant growth were suitable, insects had a continuous development. Under these conditions larvae had pigmented spots and could not survive dry conditions. Soon after cessation of the rains (or irrigation) rates of pupation decreased. At that time larvae lost their cuticular pigmentation and became resistant to drought. Comparison of the incidence of aestivation in the field with the prevailing climatic conditions showed that only lack of rain could be associated with the arrested larval development. No effects of temperature, relative humidity or photoperiod could be found. These results indicate that the host plant may be involved in the induction of diapause. Chapter 3 is concerned with characteristics of pre-diapause and diapause larvae. Evidence was obtained that under natural conditions larvae do not feed during diapause {{as long as they are}} not disturbed. The physiological condition of field-collected stem borer larvae changed considerably upon entering diapause: a decreased rate of oxygen consumption, rate of heart beat and water content, an increased fat content, and arrested development of the testes were found. These changes normally occurred before larvae were turning unspotted and/or were becoming resistant to drought. The condition of the host plant in relation to diapause induction is described in chapter 4. Diapause could be induced inside maize plants of different developmental stages. It was shown that the first (physiological) signs of the diapause syndrome appear in larvae feeding in stems containing 70 - 80 % water and very little (&lt; 1. 3 % of the fresh wt.) protein. The considerable variation in the sugar content of stems containing pre-diapause larvae suggests that sugar is not important in the induction of diapause. Marked differences were found in the consumption and utilization of stems of maize plants in different developmental stages. Its possible relevance to diapause is discussed. In chapter 5 experiments are described on the induction of aestivation-diapause by varying the food condition. Most early 5 th instar larvae of C. partellus entered diapause after being introduced into aged maize stems containing 75 % water, 8 % sugar and 1. 3 % protein (fresh wt.). Pupation rate, cuticular pigmentation, QO 2 and water content of these larvae werecomparable to values obtained from field-collected aestivating larvae. Larvae which had developed beyond the early 5 th instar were less sensitive to the diapause inducing factors of the aged maize stem : most of them pupated. Test of 30 different diets with varying protein, sugar and water contents, indicated that diets containing 0. 9 - 1. 1 % protein and 70 % water were best in inducing diapause. Early 5 th instar larvae on diets with the above mentioned protein content grew slowly (but reached normal weights), moulted into the unspotted form and had a retarded rate of pupation. Larvae on diets with lower protein contents hardly developed at all, whereas on diets with higher protein contents larvae pupated normally. Larvae reared on diets in which the water content had been reduced from the normal level of 86 % to 70 %, resulted in areduction of the larval water content and respiratory rate, close to values normal for field-collected diapause larvae. Evidence was obtained that larvae reared on diapause inducing diets attained a certain degree of drought resistance. Early 5 th instar or younger larvae were the most sensitive stages to diapause induction by diet. Many larvae on aged maize stems and artificial diets turned unspotted even though pupating soon thereafter. The relevance of the cuticular pigmentation as a criterion for aestivation-diapause is discussed. The endocrine involvement in the aestivation- diapause is described in chapter 6. From juvenile hormone titre determinations and ligation experiments evidence was obtained that the diapause is regulated by an intermediate level of JH. Application of JH to non-diapause larvae prevented pupation of these larvae but did not evoke other aspects of the diapause syndrome...|$|R

The average injury rating for a plot declined 0. 332 ± 0. 033 points per leaf stage. In years of adequate rainfall, yields declined linearly as plants were attacked later in development. Injury profiles were developed to describe feeding injury. Plot yield losses seem to be moderated by the ability of uninfested or slightly injured plants to compensate for severe <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> injury. Regression models were developed to predict plot yield and individual plant yield. Models for individual plant yield were combined with injury profiles to predict grain yield as a function of percentage of plants injured and corn development stage.

40|$|Background: There are {{different}} kinds of Bt corn, * depending on which Bt genes have been inserted into the corn using molecular engineering. Some Bt genes protect against <b>stalk</b> <b>borers,</b> others help prevent leaf and ear damage from various caterpillars including corn earworm and fall armyworm. Still other genes protect the roots from western corn rootworm. These genes are bundled together in various combinations, with or without herbicide tolerance genes. Bt corn is really a form of crop insurance that comes in the seed bag. The presence {{of one or more}} Bt genes in a corn hybrid will not increase yield potential. Instead, the gene(s) prevent yield losses from certain insects. Therefore, {{the most important thing to}} remember is that if the population of the target insect in your field or area is high enough, Bt corn will pay off.

30|$|It {{is thought}} that the highly {{effective}} plant biomass degrading capacity found in intestines of many insect herbivores constitutes {{one of the most}} efficient naturally occurring bioreactors and could provide an important and interesting biotechnology source of microorganisms and enzymes for cellulose degradation (Sun and Scharf 2010). The sugarcane <b>stalks</b> <b>borer</b> Diatraea saccharalis is the major sugarcane pest in Argentina causing considerable damage to infested plants, which facilitates secondary fungal and/or bacterial infections, resulting in important economic losses to producers. Due to the high and rapid sugarcane feeding capacity of larvae of this species, we hypothesized that larvae only fed on sugarcane, could have developed a consortium community of symbiotic-bacteria possessing an enzyme arsenal which efficiently degrade sugarcane plant tissue. Supporting this theory are recently published studies where a comparison among gut microbiota from Coleoptera, Lepidoptera and Orthoptera species, show correlation between the cellulolytic enzyme activities in the insect gut with the lignocellulosic biomass composition in the food consumed by the insect (Shi et al. 2011; Cardoso et al. 2012). These results suggest that larvae fed on a specific plant species develops or carries symbiotic bacteria possessing a highly efficient enzyme arsenal that allows the insect to rapidly process a specific plant biomass. Thus, we wanted to isolate cellulolytic bacteria from larvae feeding on sugarcane in order to explore their potential as a source of enzymes for efficient sugarcane biomass degradation that could be employed in second generation bioethanol production or other biomass treatments.|$|R
40|$|Importance {{of maize}} and {{production}} constrains Maize Lethal Necrosis (MLN) disease is “a looming threat unlike anything farmers have ever faced before”i {{especially in the}} Eastern and Central Africa (ECA) region where maize is an important staple and food security crop.

The abiotic factors include drought, low use of farm inputs especially fertilizers, low soil fertility, low rates of adoption of new technologies and in-appropriate agronomic practices. The main biotic factors include infestation by weeds particularly striga spp and insect pests such as the maize <b>stalk</b> <b>borers,</b> soil pests like termites, nematodes, cutworms, and chaffer grubs. Diseases include Grey leaf spot, Northern leaf blight, rusts, different types of rots (root, stalk and ear), smuts, Maize streak virus and Maize Lethal Necrosis (MLN) disease.

Growers of maize, Zea mays(corn), are challenged with a number of pests, but the most important are lepidopteran larvae (i. e., caterpillars) that are <b>stalk</b> <b>borers,</b> ear or leaf feeders, and coleopteran larvae (i. e., beetle grubs) that feed on roots. The European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis, for example, was nicknamed the 2 ̆ 2 billion dollar bug 2 ̆ 2 because it cost growers over a billion dollars annually in insecticides and lost crop yields (Figure 1). Most maize growers rely on traditional crop protection practices to manage these insects, including cultural, biological or chemical (insecticide) methods or a balance of these methods that aims to minimize environmental impact called integrated pest management (IPM) (Hellmich et al. 2008). However, in 1996 USA growers were introduced to commercial maize that was genetically engineered (GE) with resistance to European corn borer and other lepidopteran maize pests. In 2003 another GE maize was introduced that killed corn rootworm larvae (beetle grubs), especially larvae of the western corn rootworm,Diabrotica virgifera virgifera, another 2 ̆ 2 billion dollar bug 2 ̆ 2 (Figure 2).

Rural farmers due to their linkage to agriculture activities {{and the fact that they}} are considered as custodians of agricultural indigenous knowledge were selected as respondents. Only maize producing and IsiXhosa speaking people were chosen to contribute. Main focus was on the demography of respondents, crop production activities and insect pest control. Pretesting of the questionnaire in order to assess the appropriateness of questions and comprehension by both farmers and enumerators was done. Data was analysed using descriptive statistics. Fifty five percent (55 %) of the respondents were females and the highest number of participants was from the Chris Hani District Municipality. Majority of the people were unemployed or pensioners. Most had only attended primary school and the mean age was 59 years. Apart from maize, respondents were cultivating other crops such as cabbage, Swiss chard, potatoes etc. <b>Stalk</b> <b>borers</b> followed by cutworms were the main pests of maize in these areas. Respondents used mainly insecticides, followed by alternative substances, which also included cultural control methods such as planting date manipulation. Few respondents used plants as control agents for insect pests. Some people did not control pests even though they were a problem in their fields. The most used plant was Chenopodium ambrosiodes L, while the most used substance was Madubula (a detergent). The most used insecticide was carbaryl from the carbamite family. Respondents listed different preparation techniques for all the control methods mentioned. These techniques revealed different times of preparation, quantities of ingredients, amounts applied on plants, modes of application and intervals of application. Rural farmers in the study areas used different atypical methods which may play a significant role in pest management today. Some of the products may have a positive influence on agriculture, while some are dangerous to humans and environmental health. Further research which will investigate their potential use in pest control needs to be done...|$|R
40|$|Stalk rots {{are among}} the most serious {{diseases}} of corn, causing yield loss through reduced grain fill, premature death, and lodging. Because of the interactions between stalk-boring insects and stalk rot fungi, Bt hybrids have the potential to provide a side benefit in terms of reduced stalk rot. But stalk rot fungi enter corn plants through several different pathways, so the influence of European corn <b>borers</b> on <b>stalk</b> rot can range from none to great, depending on the specific field conditions. For the last 2 years we have evaluated stalk rot in Bt hybrids and near-isogenic non-Bt hybrids in Ames and other locations. In December, Dale Farnham reported yield performance for Bt hybrid trials conducted with ISU Extension field specialists throughout the state. In several of those locations, data also were collected on <b>stalk</b> rot. Corn <b>borer</b> infestations in those plots were naturally occurring and were not severe...|$|R
