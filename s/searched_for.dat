5|$|The Choiseul pigeon was not <b>searched</b> <b>for</b> {{again until}} briefly in 1927 {{and again in}} October 1929, when five veteran {{collectors}} belonging to the Whitney South Seas Expedition dedicated three months to searching for the pigeon in multiple locations across Choiseul without success. The indigenous people interviewed by this expedition largely believed that the pigeon was extinct in 1929. The last reported indigenous sighting was sometime in the early 1940s near Sasamungga by the Kolombangara River, although this sighting was never confirmed. Searches of the small, cat-free islands of Rob Roy Island and Wagina off Choiseul's southeast coast and Choiseul's forested coastal swampland in the 1960s by British ornithologist Shane A. Parker did not discover any signs of the pigeon. American scientist Jared Diamond <b>searched</b> <b>for</b> the bird in 1974 without success.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Although several {{theories}} {{assert that}} understanding the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> meaning {{in life is}} important, empirical research on this construct is sparse. Three studies provide the first extensive effort to understand the correlates of the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> meaning in a multistudy research program. Assessed were relations between <b>search</b> <b>for</b> meaning and wellbeing, cognitive style, and the Big Five, Big Three, Approach/Avoidance, and Interest models of personality, with a particular emphasis on understanding the correlates of <b>search</b> <b>for</b> meaning that are independent of presence of meaning. Conceptual models {{of the relation between}} search and presence were tested. Findings suggest that people lacking meaning <b>search</b> <b>for</b> it; the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> meaning did not appear to lead to its presence. Study 3 found that basic motive dispositions moderated relations between <b>search</b> <b>for</b> meaning and its presence. Results highlight the importance of basic personality dispositions in understanding the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> meaning and its correlates. Several investigations have recently reaffirmed the link between meaning in life and well-being (e. g., King, Hicks, Krull, & Del...|$|R
