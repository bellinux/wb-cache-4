Half of the numbers in a given range end in 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 {{and the other half}} in 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> sense to include 0 with the other even numbers. However, in 1977, a Paris rationing system led to confusion: on an odd-only day, the police avoided fining drivers whose plates ended in 0, because they did not know whether 0 was even. To avoid such confusion, the relevant legislation sometimes stipulates that zero is even; such laws have been passed in New South Wales and Maryland.|$|E

[...] "In this sort of current climate of music, we stand out simply because I think there are bands that are avoiding the question. <b>So,</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> us sort of an anomaly and I think that’s where we get the tag 'protest music' or 'political punk rock'". He also noted how the band's lyrics discuss social topics in general terms, instead of delving into the specifics. In a 2006 interview, McIlrath said: [...] "I {{think that a lot}} of the problems we deal with today in the world are the ones that have been plaguing society for centuries and probably will be here a hundred years from now...There's a bigger picture than just the Bush administration and specific problems of 2006, and I want people to relate to that, even if they're listening to [...] 10 years from now."

[...] Also, they felt they were not properly servicing Angie's character, instead [...] "just sticking her in scenes just to be there," [...] resulting in the decision to ultimately not bring Angie back for the season as planned.

Jon Pareles of The New York Times believed that Jackson [...] "muttered" [...] lyrics such as [...] "They thought they really had control of me".

500|$|Upon release, {{the track}} {{was met with}} {{critical}} acclaim. Hugh McIntyre from Forbes considered [...] "Ghosttown" [...] as a favorite from the album. Dean Piper from The Daily Telegraph considered the song as Madonna's best chance at achieving a radio hit from the album, comparing the composition to the singer's previous studio album, Ray of Light (1998). This view was shared by Gregory Ellwood of HitFix who considered it to be Madonna's [...] "most commercially friendly ballad" [...] of the 2010s, while Jon Lisi from PopMatters called it [...] "arguably the most haunting love song of [...] career. The Dallas Morning News Hunter Hauk complimented Madonna's [...] "natural" [...] vocal delivery {{in spite of the}} vocal effects added, also considering it to be a probable radio hit for Madonna. Daryl Deino from The Inquisitr also praised Madonna's vocals in [...] "Ghosttown", along with [...] "Devil Pray" [...] and [...] "Living for Love". Bernard Zuel from The Sydney Morning Herald found Madonna to be reliving her older ballads like [...] "Live to Tell", and found the electronic arrangements to be complimenting her vocals. Amy Pettifer from The Quietus observed that the chorus could have been sung by any other singer, but Madonna, [...] "despite being a weaker singer, licks it in the emotional truth stakes, particularly on this more melancholy end of the spectrum. Singing with a tremulous tonality, her voice hangs in uncluttered space, the lyrics positioning her as the dark-glowing, guiding light. A brilliant, desperate and rousing anthem." [...] Along with comparing Madonna's vocals in Ghosttown to that of Karen Carpenter, Farber also observed that it was her most [...] "rich sounding" [...] voice since her Evita soundtrack, comparable to [...] "Live to Tell" [...] and also [...] "Crazy for You". Digital Spy's Lewis Corner rated it four out of five stars, noting that Madonna sounded [...] "significantly more subdued and reflective compared to her handbag bangers of recent years, but by doing <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> the biggest possible impact." ...|$|E

2500|$|The primary {{mechanism}} {{for the world to}} tackle global warming is through a process established under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) treaty. The current state of global warming politics is that there is frustration over a perceived lack of progress with the establish UNFCCC overall process which has progressed over eighteen years but which has been unable to curb global greenhouse gas emissions. [...] Todd Stern—the US Climate Change envoy—has expressed the challenges with the UNFCCC process as follows, [...] "Climate change is not a conventional environmental issue ...

This is an economic issue every bit as it is an environmental one." [...] He went on to explain that, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is a multilateral body concerned with climate change and can be an inefficient system for enacting international policy. Because the framework system includes over 190 countries and because negotiations are governed by consensus, small groups of countries can often block progress.|$|E
2500|$|That is, {{to combine}} n data points with total {{precision}} of nτ (or equivalently, total variance of n/σ2) and mean of values , derive a new total precision simply {{by adding the}} total precision of the data to the prior total precision, and form a new mean through a precision-weighted average, i.e. a weighted average of the data mean and the prior mean, each weighted by the associated total precision. This makes logical sense if the precision is thought of as indicating the certainty of the observations: In {{the distribution of the}} posterior mean, each of the input components is weighted by its certainty, and the certainty of this distribution is the sum of the individual certainties.
