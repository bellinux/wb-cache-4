40|$|Environmental and {{political}} concerns centered on energy use from gasoline {{have led to}} a great deal of research on ethanol production. The goal of this thesis is to determine if it is profitable to produce ethanol in Texas using <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> juice. Four different areas, Moore, Hill, Willacy, and Wharton Counties, using two feedstock alternatives, <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> only and <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> and corn, will be analyzed using Monte Carlo simulation to determine the probability of economic success. Economic returns to the farmers {{in the form of a}} contract price for the average <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> yield per acre in each study area and to the ethanol plant buying <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> at the contract price will be simulated and ranked. The calculated <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> contract prices offered to farmers are $ 9. 94, $ 11. 44, $ 29. 98, and $ 36. 21 per ton in Wharton, Willacy, Moore, and Hill Counties, respectively. The contract prices are equal to the next most profitable crop returns or ten percent more than the total cost to produce <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> in the study area. The wide variation in the price is due to competing crop returns and the <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> growing season. Ethanol production using <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> and corn is the most profitable alternative analyzed for an ethanol plant. A Moore County ethanol plant has the highest average net present value of $ 492. 39 million and is most preferred overall when using <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> and corn to produce ethanol. <b>Sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> ethanol production is most profitable in Willacy County but is not economically successful with an average net present value of $- 11. 06 million. Ethanol production in Hill County is least preferred with an average net present value of $- 712. 00 and $ 48. 40 million when using <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> only and <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> and corn, respectively. Producing unsubsidized ethanol from <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> juice alone is not profitable in Texas. <b>Sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> ethanol supplemented by grain is more economical but would not be as profitable as producing ethanol from only grain in the Texas Panhandle.

While the stalk juice from <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> used for ethanol production, its grain is used for food and the bagasse as animal feed. The investigation had four objectives: 1) to popularize <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> as food, feed and fuel crop; 2) to identify promising <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> cultivars under on-farm conditions for use as animal feed; 3) to study the associationships between cane yield and stalk sugar traits; and 4) to assess the options for utilizing stover and fresh/dried bagasse as livestock feed. <b>Sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> cultivation is feasible and profitable under rainfed conditions {{in the study area}} with the hybrid CSH 22 SS. Results from on-farm evaluation of elite <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> hybrids and varieties and correlation studies indicated that dryland farmers gain from whole plant use of <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> as there is no significant tradeoff between grain yield and sugar/stover yields. The genetic enhancement of <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> is justifiable as the food and fodder value of the crop is not compromised by its improvement for bio-fuel value.

40|$|<b>Sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> (Sorghum bicolor) has {{potential}} as a bioenergy feedstock due to its high yield potential {{and the production of}} simple sugars for fermentation. <b>Sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> cultivars are typically tall, high biomass types with juicy stalks and high sugar concentration. These sorghums can be harvested, milled, and fermented to ethanol using technology similar to that used to process sugarcane. <b>Sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> has advantages in that it can be planted by seed with traditional planters, is an annual plant that quickly produces a crop and fits well in crop rotations, and it is a very water-use efficient crop. Processing <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> is capital intensive, but it could fit into areas where sugarcane is already produced. <b>Sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> could be timed to harvest and supply the sugar mill during the off season when sugarcane is not being processed, be fit into crop rotations, or used in water limiting environments. In these ways, <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> could be used to produce ethanol in the Southern U. S and other tropical and subtropical environments. Traditionally, <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> has been grown as a pureline cultivar. However, these cultivars produce low quantities of seed and are often too tall for efficient mechanical harvest. <b>Sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> hybrids that use grain-type seed parents with high sugar concentrations are one way to overcome limitation to seed supply and to capture the benefits of heterosis. There are four objectives of this research. First to evaluate the importance of genotype, environment, and genotype-by-environment interaction effects on the <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> yield and composition. The second objective is to determine the presence and magnitude of heterosis effects for traits related to sugar production in <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum.</b> Next: to study the ability of <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> hybrids and cultivars to produce a ratoon crop and determine the contribution of ratoon crops to total sugar yield. The final objective is to evaluate variation in composition of <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> juice and biomass. <b>Sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> hybrids, grain-type <b>sweet</b> seed parents, and traditional cultivars that served as male parents were evaluated in multi-environment trials in Weslaco, College Station, and Halfway, Texas in 2007 and 2008. Both genotype and environment influenced performance, but environment had a greater effect than genotype on the composition of <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> juice and biomass yield. In comparing performance, elite hybrids produced fresh biomass and sugar yields similar to the traditional cultivars while overcoming the seed production limitations. High parent heterosis was expressed among the experimental hybrids for biomass yield, sugar yield and sugar concentration. Additional selection for combining ability would further enhance yields and heterosis in the same hybrid. Little variation was observed among hybrids for juice and biomass composition suggesting that breeding efforts should focus on yield before altering plant composition...|$|R

The <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> trials were conducted at Ukulinga research farm (University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg) and Hatfield experimental farm (University of Pretoria, Pretoria), South Africa. Field trials were conducted in two successive seasons, viz., 2010 / 11 and 2011 / 12. Seasonal water use was estimated using eddy covariance and surface renewal methods. Fresh and dry aboveground biomass yield, stalk yield and stalk Brix % were measured at final harvest. Theoretical ethanol yield was calculated from fresh stalk yield and Brix %. Water use for the two growing seasons was 415 mm at Ukulinga and 398 mm at Hatfield. The ethanol water use efficiency (WUE) values for the <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> at Ukulinga were 0. 27 and 0. 60 L∙m- 3 for 2010 / 11 and 2011 / 12 growing seasons, respectively.

In this paper, we quantify the logistics cost of corn stover and <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> in China under different scenarios. We analyze three scenarios of corn stover logistics from northeast China and three scenarios of <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> stalks logistics from Inner Mongolia in China. The case study {{estimates that the}} logistics cost of corn stover and <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> stalk to be $ 52. 95 /dry metric ton and $ 52. 64 /dry metric ton, respectively, for the current labor-based biomass logistics system. However, if the feedstock logistics operation is mechanized, the cost of corn stover and <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> stalk decreases to $ 36. 01 /dry metric ton and $ 35. 76 /dry metric ton, respectively. The study also includes a sensitivity analysis to identify the cost factors that cause logistics cost variation. Results of the sensitivity analysis show that labor price has the most influence on the logistics cost of corn stover and <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> stalk, with a variation of $ 6 to $ 12 /dry metric ton. biomass; logistics system; modeling; corn stover; <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> stalk...|$|R
40|$|<b>Sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> has {{substantial}} {{potential as}} a biofuel feedstock, with advantages in some environments over alternatives such as sugarcane or maize. Gene technologies {{are likely to be}} important to achieve yields sufficient for food, fuel and fibre production from available global croplands, but sorghum has proven difficult to transform. Tissue culture recalcitrance and poor reproducibility of transformation protocols remain major challenges for grain sorghum, and there has been no reported success for <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum.</b> Here we describe a repeatable transformation system for <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum,</b> based on (1) optimized tissue culture conditions for embryogenic callus production with > 90 % regenerability in 12 -week-old calli, and (2) an effective selection regimen for hygromycin resistance conferred by a Ubi-hpt transgene following particle bombardment. Using this method, we have produced sixteen independent transgenic lines from multiple batches at an overall efficiency of 0. 09 % transformants per excised immature embryo. Co-expression frequency of a non-selected luciferase reporter was 62. 5 %. Transgene integration and expression were confirmed in T(0) and T(1) plants by Southern analysis and luciferase assays. This success using the major international <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> cultivar Ramada provides a foundation for molecular improvement of <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> through the use of transgenes.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Biological and Agricultural EngineeringKyle Douglas-MankinOpportunities for {{alternative}} biofuel feedstocks are widespread {{for a number}} of reasons: increased environmental and economic concerns over corn production and processing, limitations in the use of corn-based ethanol to 57 billion L (15 billion gal) by the Energy Independence and Security Act (US Congress, 2007), and target requirements of 136 billion L (36 billion gal) of renewable fuel production by 2022. The objective {{of this study was to}} select the most promising among currently available crop models that have the potential to model <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> biomass production in the central US, specifically Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas, and to develop and test <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> crop parameters for this model. Five crop models were selected (CropSyst, CERE-Sorghum, APSIM, ALMANAC, and SORKAM), and the models were compared based on ease of use, model support, and availability of inputs and outputs from <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> biomass data and literature. After reviewing the five models, ALMANAC was selected as the best suited for the development and testing of <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> crop parameters. The results of the model comparison show that more data are needed about <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> physiological development stages and specific growth/development factors before the other models reviewed in this study can be readily used for <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> crop modeling. This study used a unique method to calibrate the <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> crop parameter development site. Ten years of crop performance data (Corn and Grain Sorghum) for Kansas Counties (Riley and Ellis) were used to select an optimum soil water (SW) estimation method (Saxton and Rawls, Ritchie et al., and a method that added 0. 01 m m [superscript]- 1 to the minimum SW value given in the SSURGO soil database) and evapotranspiration (ET) method (Penman-Montieth, Priestley-Taylor, and Hargraeves and Samani) combination for use in the <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> parameter development. ALMANAC general parameters for corn and grain sorghum were used for the calibration/selection of the SW/ET combination. Variations in the harvest indexes were used to simulate variations in geo-climate region grain yield. A step through comparison method was utilized to select the appropriate SW/ET combination. Once the SW/ET combination was selected the combination was used to develop the <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> crop parameters. Two main conclusions can be drawn from the <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> crop parameter development study. First, the combination of Saxton and Rawls (2006) and Priestley-Taylor (1972) (SR-PT) methods has the potential for wide applicability in the US Central Plains for simulating grain yields using ALMANAC. Secondly, from the development of the <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> crop model parameters, ALMANAC modeled biomass yields with reasonable accuracy; differences from observed biomass values ranged from 0. 89 to 1. 76 Mg ha [superscript]- 1 (2. 8 to 9. 8 %) in Kansas (Riley County), Oklahoma (Texas County), and Texas (Hale County). Future research for <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> physiology, Radiation Use Efficiency/Vapor Pressure Deficit relationships, and weather data integration would be useful in improving <b>sweet</b> <b>sorghum</b> biomass modeling...|$|R

Tamarind and <b>Sweet</b> <b>Sorghum</b> really have   big potentials  for reaching the public and showcasing its benefits, thus this study could encourage growers to raise more Tamarind and <b>Sweet</b> <b>Sorghum</b> in their areas not only as  food but as a raw material in the production of natural products which are for health and wellness. Both Tamarind and <b>Sweet</b> <b>Sorghum</b> possess skin healing effect which may be attributed to their biologically active components. Tamarind  possess to have bioflavonoids and alkaloids which occur in its leaves, pulp and bark. The bark contains  tannin which are recommended for treatments of inflammation, ulceration and skin disease. Tamarind has  Tartaric acid that makes it possible for tamarind to works wonders on oily skin with pimples and on sun-damaged.   <b>Sweet</b> <b>Sorghum</b> on the other hand contains emulsion, a substance that can give a moisturizing effect on the skin. the majestic phytochemistry of Tamarind and <b>Sweet</b> <b>Sorghum</b> encouraged the researcher  to produce and test  the acceptability, efficacy and safety of different skin care products that are commonly needed by the community. The Tamarind Leaves soap was proven to be highly acceptable in terms of its color, odor, texture, hardness and overall appearance. Both the Tamarind soap and the <b>Sweet</b> <b>Sorghum</b> soap were safe and free from insoluble soap and fatty acid soap. The percent reduction of acne in using Tamarind soap, <b>Sweet</b> <b>Sorghum</b> and Commercial soap have similar effect on the tenth and twelve days of use. The initial means of the treatments ranges from 10. 00 pustule to 2. 00 pustule. After 12 days of treatment the mean decrease is zero or equivalent to 100 % {{decrease in the number of}} acne. The result of this study maybe explained with the result on antibacterial property test (against Staphylococcus A.) of Tamarind soap and <b>Sweet</b> <b>Sorghum</b> Soap. Tamarind soap with 8 % extract was found to be most effective in reduction of pimples. The Tamarind shower gel and <b>Sweet</b> <b>Sorghum</b> shower gels were effective against Staphylococcus Aurous. Tamarind Bark Ointment was an effective anti – inflammatory agent particularly on swelling and redness as well as for wound healing. Tamarind scrub salt, shower gel  and liniment  were also highly acceptable and found to be safe and effective. Result on the acceptability of <b>Sweet</b> <b>Sorghum</b> natural products are comparable to the acceptability of Tamarind natural products.   The development of technology for the Production of Natural  Products from Tamarind and <b>Sweet</b> <b>Sorghum</b> is timely, considering the growing consciousness of consumers on safe, organic and healthy natural products.
