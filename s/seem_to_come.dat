25|$|After {{determining}} {{that the subject}} is cooperative, the reader will make a number of probing statements or questions, typically using variations of the methods noted below. The subject will then reveal further information with their replies (whether verbal or non-verbal) and the cold reader can continue from there, pursuing promising lines of inquiry and quickly abandoning or avoiding unproductive ones. In general, while revelations <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from the reader, most of the facts and statements come from the subject, which are then refined and restated by the reader so as to reinforce {{the idea that the}} reader got something correct.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, {{scholars}} have posited various mechanisms other than massive demographic change by which pre-migration Celtic place-names {{could have been}} lost. Scholars have stressed that Welsh and Cornish place-names from the Roman period seem {{no more likely to}} survive than English ones: 'clearly name loss was a Romano-British phenomenon, not just one associated with Anglo-Saxon incomers'. Other explanations for the replacement of Roman period place-names include adaptation of Celtic names such that they now <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from Old English; a more gradual loss of Celtic names than was once assumed; and new names being coined (in the newly dominant English language) because instability of settlements and land-tenure.|$|E

25|$|Many first-round {{candidates}} {{endorsed the}} second-round candidates, but some made public statements regarding {{the second round}} but did not endorse. Dragan Primorac made several public statements - he initially tried to stay completely neutral, but later released one where he listed some characteristics of the future president that he would want, without naming a candidate, but focusing on the fight against corruption. The reception was mixed – Večernji list said he chose no one, while Jutarnji list said that he chose Josipović, reading between the lines. The Josipović campaign later decided to include Primorac in their endorsement list and Primorac did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> forward with a public rebuttal. On the other hand, Josip Jurčević made a late public statement telling voters to void their ballot.|$|E
25|$|Episode one, 'Tony', is an {{ensemble}} piece that introduces {{the characters and}} the format. We meet the effortlessly attractive, popular and intelligent Tony as he arranges for his friends to attend a party held by upper-class girl Abigail Stock (Georgina Moffat). The second episode, 'Cassie', focuses on Cassie's final visit to an eating disorder clinic {{under the supervision of}} Abigail's mother Dr Stock. In her day-to-day life, she hallucinates messages instructing her to eat which <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from Sid, for whom she develops feelings. Jal's episode follows her attempt to win BBC Young Musician of the Year, and her strained relationship with her famous musician father. When a drug dealer 'Mad Twatter' smashes her clarinet as pay back for Sid not giving him money for drugs he bought, Jal's father sees to it he will not bother the gang again. In 'Chris', Chris' mother abandons him, leaving £1,000 in cash. He blows the money on a party, and is eventually helped into temporary student accommodation by his psychology teacher, Angie (Siwan Morris). Episode five, 'Sid', shows Sid's struggle with his parents' break-up while Tony organises a scheme to set him up with Michelle. A heartbroken and fragile Cassie attempts suicide by drug overdose.|$|E

500|$|Most of the album's {{tracks are}} about {{rock and roll}} itself–Angus stated, [...] "Certain songs just <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to life when you add that phrase". However, other themes served as inspiration. [...] "Money Made" [...] is a {{criticism}} on how, according to Angus, in the US [...] "everything is money these days". [...] "War Machine" [...] {{was based on a}} documentary on Hannibal, which led {{to the conclusion that the}} military has not changed since Ancient Rome. [...] "Wheels" [...] tells about Johnson's passion for motorcars. He described the album's release as the [...] "best one we've done", he felt that while Back in Black was great for its time, Black Ice shows the band's versatility. Angus also said he admired the album's diversity, saying [...] "It is sufficiently varied to please people in varied moods".|$|E
500|$|Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune {{gave the}} film {{three and a}} half stars (out of four), saying [...] "War of the Worlds {{definitely}} wins its battle, but not the war." [...] Wilmington stated the film brought the viewers on a wild journey through two sides of Spielberg: the dark and the light. He also said the film contained a core sentiment similar to that of Spielberg's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. About.com's Rebecca Murray gave a positive review, stating, [...] "Spielberg almost succeeds in creating the perfect alien movie", with criticism only for the ending. Jonathan Rosenbaum of Chicago Reader praised the special effects and Cruise's performance. Roger Ebert criticized the [...] "retro design" [...] and considered that despite the big budget, the alien invasion was [...] "rudimentary" [...] and [...] "not very interesting", regarding the best scenes as Ray walking among the airliner wreckage and a train running in flames, declaring that [...] "such scenes <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from a kind of reality {{different from that of the}} tripods." ...|$|E
500|$|Ten {{features}} a two-part track entitled [...] "Master/Slave" [...] that both opens {{and closes the}} album. The first part begins the album, before [...] "Once" [...] starts, {{and the second part}} closes the album, after [...] "Release". It begins about ten seconds after the album's closer [...] "Release" [...] as a hidden track, but both count as one track on the CD. The song is entirely instrumental (except for random unintelligible words Vedder utters throughout) with a dominant fretless bass line makes up the core of the song (which Ament referred to in a 1994 Bass Player magazine interview as [...] "my tribute to (fretless bass instrumentalist) Mick Karn"), along with some guitar and sounds that <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from the drums. Producer Rick Parashar stated in 2002, [...] "As I recall, I think Jeff had, like, a bass line...I heard the bass line and then we kind of were collaborating on that in the control room, and then I just started programming on the keyboard all this stuff; he was jamming with it and it just kind of came about like that." ...|$|E

500|$|Beyoncé {{begins the}} first verse {{of the song}} in a near-whisper, [...] "I thought that things like this get better with time / But I still need you / Why is that?" [...] The latter rhetorical {{question}} reappears throughout the song. In the chorus lines, she questions herself, [...] "I miss you / But if I got with you, could it feel the same?" [...] From the second verse and onwards, the song finds Beyoncé [...] "vocalizing an internal battle, alternately desperate and calm", as stated by Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle. She starts to sing in a double voice; her lower vocal notes are set as the song's base, while her voice in a heightened key is played over it. In the second verse, she sings, [...] "The words don’t ever <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out right / But I still mean em", pining for her ex-love interest and feeling self-conscious for doing so, [...] "It hurts my pride {{to tell you how}} I feel, but I still need to" [...] before asking again, [...] "Why is that?". The bridge features Beyoncé chanting, [...] "No matter who you are / It is so simple / A feeling / But it’s everything." ...|$|E

2500|$|Regarding Callas's soft singing, Celletti says, [...] "In these soft passages, Callas <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> {{use another}} voice altogether, because it {{acquired}} a great sweetness.

The formation is very rare exposed and of interest to economic geologists, as it contains many of the possibly gold-bearing intrusive areas. It is colored light blue on the map.|$|E
2500|$|The Mint states that, {{with normal}} wear and tear, the colour should remain {{for a number}} of years, {{although}} this claim was quickly disproved [...] The colouration compounds are attached to the metal on a specially prepared 'dimpled' section of the coin, and <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> off easily if deliberately rubbed.

2500|$|One very {{important}} point was that when Hitler attacked Russia, he did so with his entire military might. Practically everyone who lived through it remembered the event as an instantaneous shock of tremendous power. None of this comes out in the symphony. The [...] "invasion" [...] theme begins very softly in the strings, pianissimo. It eventually becomes a howling monster, but only gradually.

2500|$|The Subordinate Courts have no [...] "jurisdiction {{relating}} to the judicial review of any act done or decision made by any person or authority", {{and do not have}} the power to grant prerogative orders. Like the High Court, the Subordinate Courts may grant declarations of rights. However, as Magistrate's Courts have no jurisdiction to hear matters that do not involve monetary claims, they cannot declare legislation unconstitutional. On the other hand, it appears that District Courts may {{be able to do so}} as no such limitation applies to them, and declaring legislation to be void does not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> within the words [...] "judicial review of any act done or decision made by any person or authority".|$|E
2500|$|Sparks {{encountered}} difficulties; it [...] "just didn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> together". For Sparks, {{there should}} be an [...] "element that [...] the characters apart in order to have drama". Throughout Sparks' career, he has attempted to not use the same element twice, so it had become harder for him to write each new novel. He comments, [...] "If I don't have the 'conflict', I don't have the story, and for the life of me, I couldn't come up with something new to keep the characters apart.... I also wanted to write a story using older characters, again because it's something I haven't done (with the exception of The Notebook, in which they're elderly, not middle-aged)." ...|$|E
