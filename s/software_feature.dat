It is found that: (i) although the GPL requires firms open the codes of features, firms have incentives to invest in <b>software</b> <b>features</b> under private optimum; (ii) the firm with high software usability has much higher incentive to invest in <b>software</b> <b>features,</b> sets higher price, obtains more market share and profit than the one with low software usability does; (iii) firms invest too little in <b>software</b> <b>features</b> under GPL from a public policy perspective...|$|R

50|$|These routers were repackaged {{versions}} of the 2500 specifically to be sold through channel partners to small and medium businesses that needed a greater ease of setup. They were offered at a reduced price due to their reduced <b>software</b> <b>feature</b> set. They are characterized by a light grey/cream colored case compared to the standard dark grey colouring.|$|E
50|$|While a {{deprecated}} <b>software</b> <b>feature</b> {{remains in}} the software, its use may raise warning messages recommending alternative practices; deprecated status may also indicate the feature will be removed in the future. Features are deprecated rather than immediately removed, to provide backward compatibility, and to give programmers time to bring affected code into compliance with the new standard.|$|E

WAP uses Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) for pre-authenticated access to internally hosted corporate web applications such as SharePoint.|$|E
50|$|A key <b>software</b> <b>feature</b> with QLab is its {{ease of use}} in live {{playback}} situations. The designer of a cue sheet can save their show file, and lock it, preventing any changes to the cues. After doing so, an untrained user can run the software in a playback situation. By default, a cue is triggered by clicking a large GO button on the screen, or by pressing the space bar.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes {{mobile network}} {{operators}} restrict handsets that they sell {{for use with}} their own network. This is called locking and is implemented by a <b>software</b> <b>feature</b> of the phone. A subscriber may usually contact the provider to remove the lock for a fee, utilize private services to remove the lock, or use software and websites to unlock the handset themselves. It is possible to hack past a phone locked by a network operator.|$|E

50|$|In the {{standard}} firmware, telnet shell access {{is available in}} earlier versions (up to 6.2.2.6) on the BT Home Hub 1.0 with appropriate user permissions. This {{is identical to the}} custom shell used in the SpeedTouch range of routers and provides an almost identical <b>software</b> <b>feature</b> set, with a few notable exceptions (e.g. PPP authentication is locked on the BT firmware). This is not the case in the unlocked versions, as full telnet access is available.|$|E
50|$|Incremental computing, {{also known}} as {{incremental}} computation, is a <b>software</b> <b>feature</b> which, whenever a piece of data changes, attempts to save time by only recomputing those outputs which depend on the changed data. When incremental computing is successful, it can be significantly faster than computing new outputs naively. For example, a spreadsheet software package might use incremental computation in its recalculation feature, to update only those cells containing formulas which depend (directly or indirectly) on the changed cells.|$|E
50|$|In computing, version {{targeting}} is {{a technique}} that allows a group of (presumably knowledgeable) users (including software developers) to utilise some advanced <b>software</b> <b>features</b> that were introduced in a particular software version while allowing users accustomed to the prior versions to still utilise the same software as if the new features were never added to the software. It {{is a way to}} ensure backward compatibility when new <b>software</b> <b>features</b> would otherwise break it.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive statistical {{research on the}} effect of construction cost estimating <b>software’s</b> <b>features</b> towards estimating job performance. The objectives of this study are identification of cost estimating <b>software</b> <b>features,</b> analyzing the significant relation of cost estimating <b>software’s</b> <b>features</b> towards job performance, Explore the problem faced during the implementation and lastly propose a plan to improve the cost estimating software usage among contractors in Malaysia. The study statistically reveals four features of cost estimating software that significantly impact towards changes in cost estimating job performance. These features were refined by performing interview to focus group of respondent to observe the actual possible problems during the implementation. Eventually, the proposed improvement plan was validated by the focus group of respondents to enhance the cost estimating software implementation among contractors in Malaysia. ...|$|R
