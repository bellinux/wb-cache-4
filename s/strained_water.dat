50|$|During the 1998 public {{hearings}} {{held by the}} PR Environmental Quality Board and the PR Planning Board for both projects’ environmental impact statements (EIS’s) and site permits, respectively, different stakeholders started exchanging contact information in order to collaborate in halting {{the approval of the}} project’s EIS’s and site permits. They considered that the official documents presented by the project’s proponents were substantially weak and incomplete. For example, San Miguel Resort’s EIS indicated that the NEC’s rivers flowed into the “Pacific Ocean”, instead of the “Atlantic Ocean”. These groups also contended that both EIS's did not consider general public access to the coast nor their significant cumulative environmental impacts, especially towards the already <b>strained</b> <b>water</b> supply in Puerto Rico’s northeast coast. The initial NEC campaign’s message focused on how the proposed residential and tourism projects were going to: (1) deplete the limited water supplies needed by local communities, affecting {{the quality of life of}} thousands of citizens in the eastern region of Puerto Rico; (2) promote more urban sprawl throughout El Yunque National Forest's coastal buffer zone; and (3) severely limit public access to local beaches, public lands and other public natural resources.|$|E

40|$|With growing infrastructural {{pressure}} {{induced by}} urban densification combined with rural {{development and the}} increasing demands of industrialisation, South Africa is facing two related challenges. The first {{is a lack of}} sufficient energy to satisfactorily fulfil the needs of the expanding economy. The second is that South Africa has limited access to water. Electricity generation using the traditional coal-burning power stations requires vast amounts of water, for amongst other things, steam generation to drive the turbines and water is also used in the cooling process. Thus, as the demand for electricity grows, so too does the pressure on the country's <b>strained</b> <b>water</b> supplies. The growing demand for electricity favours the building of new traditional coal- burning power stations, which emit vast amounts of pollutants into the atmosphere, negatively affecting the environment. This leads to a degree of conflict between stakeholders, namely the energy producers, government bodies, and environmentalists. This paper uses Hirshleifer’s Conflict Success Function to highlight the ‘urgency ’ of replacing traditional fuel-based power stations with alternative renewable energy generators, using South Africa as a case study...|$|E

40|$|Potable reuse is {{implemented}} {{in several countries}} around the world to augment <b>strained</b> <b>water</b> supplies. This article presents a public health perspective on potable reuse by comparing the critical infrastructure and institutional capacity characteristics of two well-established potable reuse schemes with conventional drinking water schemes in developed nations that have experienced waterborne outbreaks. Analysis of failure events in conventional water systems between 2003 and 2013 showed that despite advances in water treatment technologies, drinking water outbreaks caused by microbial contamination were still frequent in developed countries and can be attributed to failures in infrastructure or institutional practices. Numerous institutional failures linked to ineffective treatment protocols, poor operational practices, and negligence were detected. In contrast, potable reuse schemes that use multiple barriers, online instrumentation, and operational measures were found to address the events that have resulted in waterborne outbreaks in conventional systems in the past decade. Syndromic surveillance has emerged as a tool in outbreak detection and was useful in detecting some outbreaks; increases in emergency department visits and GP consultations being the most common data source, suggesting potential for an increasing role in public health surveillance of waterborne outbreaks. These results highlight desirable characteristics of potable reuse schemes from a public health perspective with potential for guiding policy on surveillance activities...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} challenges in the anthropocentric age is the sustainable management of the planet's increasingly <b>strained</b> <b>water</b> resources. In this avenue, {{there is a need to}} advance holistic approaches and objective tools which allow policy makers to better evaluate system-level properties and trade-offs of water resources. This research contributes to the expanding literature in this area by examining the changes to system-level network configurations of the middle reaches of the Heihe River basin from 2000 to 2009. Specifically, through the ecological network analysis (ENA) approach, this research examines changes to the system-level properties of efficiency, redundancy, and evaluates the trade-offs to the resiliency of ecosystem water services of the middle reaches of the Heihe River basin. Our results indicate that while the efficiency of the middle reaches has increased from 2000 to 2009 by 6 % and 78 % more water is released to the lower reaches, the redundancy of the system has also decreased by 6 %. The lower level of redundancy, particularly due to the changes in the groundwater body levels, has critical long-term consequences for the resilience of the water ecosystem services of the middle reaches. In consideration of these holistic trade-offs, two hypothetical alternative scenarios, based on water recycling and saving strategies, are developed to improve the long-term health and resilience of the water system...|$|E
40|$|Climate {{change and}} rapidly rising global water demand are {{expected}} to place unprecedented pressures on already <b>strained</b> <b>water</b> resource systems. Successfully planning for these future changes requires a sound scientific understanding of the timing, location, and magnitude of climate change impacts on water needs and availability—not only average trends but also interannual variability and quantified uncertainties. In recent years, two types of large-ensemble runs of climate projections have become available: those from groups of more than 20 different climate models and those from repeated runs of several individual models. These {{provide the basis for}} novel probabilistic evaluation of both projected climate change and the resulting effects on water resources. Using a broad range of available ensembles, this research explores the spatial and temporal patterns of high confidence as well as uncertainty in projected river runoff, irrigation water requirements, basin storage yield, and cost estimates of adapting regional water systems to maintain historical supply. Projections of river runoff show robust between-ensemble agreement in regional drying (e. g., southern Africa and southern Europe) and wetting trends (e. g., northeastern United States). By integrating runoff over space and time, the economic effects of adapting supply systems to 2050 water availability show still broader trend agreement across ensembles. That agreement, obtained across such a wide range of multiple-member climate model ensembles in some locations, suggests a high degree of confidence in direction of change in water availability and provides clearer signals for longer-term investment decisions in water infrastructure...|$|E

40|$|The {{forests of}} Monteverde, Costa Rica are renowned for their {{biological}} diversity {{and the many}} rare and endemic species that inhabit them. Originally protected for water supply, these forests attract ecologists and tourists to the small community on the leeward slope of the Cordillera de Tilaran. While economically beneficial, the growth associated {{with the rise of}} ecotourism has <b>strained</b> <b>water</b> resources. Water for supply is taken directly from streams and springs in these forests with little or no storage, and stream chemistry is significantly affected by the direct discharge of graywater. The community is strongly dependent on precipitation for both water supply and to ensure adequate dilution of its wastewater. Climate in this mountainous region is controlled by the migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and the steep topography leads to significant spatial variability in precipitation inputs. The rainy season, May through October, is characterized by intense convective events that deliver to Monteverde an average of 2000 mm of rain during these six months. For the remainder of the year, the trade winds increase in strength and carry moisture up from the Caribbean Sea. This orographic uplift keeps the highland forests immersed in clouds and fog, and average rainfall is approximately 600 mm during these drier months. While the dominant input of water occurs during the rainy season, our stable isotope analyses indicate that orographic precipitation maintains stream baseflow during critical periods of the drier season. Combined with recent climate modeling work that predicts an increase in cloud-base height and a concomitant decrease in dry-season precipitation, this indicates a susceptibility of the water resources of Monteverde to a changing climate...|$|E
40|$|The water {{resources}} of the Southwestern United States are under significant stress. The historical record of the Colorado River indicates that the commitment allocations (7. 5 million acre-feet to both the Upper and Lower Colorado basin states, and 1. 5 maf for Mexico) have overestimated the average available streamflow. Compounding the supply problem, the Bureau of Reclamation has projected an average decrease of 9 % in the Colorado River streamflow between the years 2011 - 2060. Improving forecasts of climate and streamflow, at nearly all time scales, is imperative to most effectively manage these <b>strained</b> <b>water</b> resources. Given the challenges confronting the Southwest, three research studies are presented {{that could be used}} to assist water managers. The first study targets the lack of skill seen in seasonal forecasts of precipitation across the US issued by the Climate Prediction Center (CPC). An objective and concise methodology is shown to improve overall seasonal forecast skill as an alternative to forecasts made by the CPC. This methodology uses a combined linear and nearest neighbor model to make forecasts, with the NINO 3. 4 index as the only predictor. The second study shows skillful forecasts of decadal Colorado streamflow using the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) indices as predictors. However, even though the instrumental record showed statistically significant skillful forecasts, the reconstructed records of AMO, PDO and streamflow appear to challenge these results. Lastly, the third study investigates the effects of climate change in the 21 st century on the Salt, Verde and Rio Grande river basins. Two dynamically downscaled General Circulation Models (GCMs) are first bias-corrected. Then, the output of these models is used as the climatic forcings for the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model. Results suggest that future streamflows are projected to decrease by 22 % and 37 %, for the respective GCMs, averaged across the basins...|$|E
40|$|South Africa's water {{resources}} are unequally distributed over {{space and time}} to a high degree and our already stressed {{water resources}} situation will only be exacerbated by climate change if current predictions are correct. The potential for conflict over increasingly <b>strained</b> <b>water</b> resources in South Africa is thus very real. In {{order to deal with}} these complex problems national legislation is demanding that water resource management be decentralized to the local level where active participation can take place in an integrated manner in accordance with the principles of IWRM. However, administrative and political boundaries rarely match those of catchments as, throughout South Africa, rivers have been employed extensively to delineate administrative and political boundaries at a number of spatial scales. The aim of this research is to determine if rivers act as dividing or uniting features in a socio-political landscape and whether topography will influence their role in this context. By considering sections of the Orange-Senqu River, some of which are employed as political or administrative boundaries, this project furthermore aims to consider the implications of this for catchment management in South Africa. South Africa's proposed form of decentralized water management will have to contend with the effects of different topographies on the way in which rivers are perceived and utilized. The ability of a river to act as a dividing or uniting feature is dependent on a number of interrelated factors, the effects of which are either reduced or enhanced by the topography surrounding the river. Factors such as the state of the resource, levels of utilization, local histories and the employment of the river as a political or administrative border are all factors that {{determine the extent to which}} a river unites or divides the communities along its banks, and are all influenced by topography. The implications of this for the management of catchments in South Africa are significant. Local water management institutions will have to contend with a mismatch in borders and in many cases bridge social divides that are deeply entrenched along the banks of rivers. Importantly, the need for a context specific approach to catchment management is highlighted. ...|$|E
