40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} recall of media reports about vitamin D and {{associated}} factors. Methods: Analysis of cross-sectional telephone interview data (2, 001 Queensland adults, 18 - 70 years) on vitamin D and personal sun protection, recall of media reports and participant characteristics. Results: 83. 7 % of participants had heard of vitamin D, 47. 5 % through the media. Only 513 (25. 6 %) participants recalled the media content within four main themes: vitamin D is beneficial/comes from the sun (47. 0 %); some people aren't getting enough vitamin D, need more sun (27. 9 %); need to balance sun exposure and skin protection (11. 5 %); or other (13. 6 %). Only 65 of the 950 participants (6. 8 %) reported a change to their behaviour(s) due to the media report. Conclusion: Although the media were {{the main source of}} information about vitamin D for almost 50 % of participants, recall of the content and direct effect on behaviour was low. Only a small minority recalled a balanced media report of beneficial and harmful aspects of sun exposure. Implications: Health professionals often <b>supply</b> <b>media</b> with background information. To achieve best public health practice for sun protection and vitamin D, information to foster balanced media reports should be provided. © 2010 Public Health Association of Australia...|$|E

40|$|The Internet {{provides}} a highly suitable infrastructure for sharing multimedia meeting records, especially as multimedia technologies become more lightweight and workers more mobile. LiteMinutes {{is a system}} that uses both the Web and email for creating, revising, distributing, and accessing multimedia information captured in a meeting. Supported media include text notes taken on wireless laptops, slide images captured from presentations, and video recorded by cameras in the room. At the end of a meeting, text notes are sent by the note taking applet to the server, which formats them in HTML with links from each note item to the captured slide images and video recording. Smart link generation is achieved by capturing contextual metadata such as the on/off state of the media equipment and the room location of the laptop, and inferring whether it makes sense to <b>supply</b> <b>media</b> links to a particular note item. Note takers can easily revise meeting minutes after a meeting by modifying the email message sent to them and mailing it back to the server's email address. We explore design issues concerning preferences for email and Web access of meeting minutes, as well as the different timeframes for access. We also describe the integration with a comic book style video summary and visualization system with text captions for browsing the video recording of a meeting.

40|$|Surfaces and {{interfaces}} have {{a special}} significance to nanotechnology because the surface/volume ratio of nanomaterials is larger than for bulk materials. Therefore, interfaces of nanomaterials are usually {{more important to the}} properties of nanomaterials than for larger scale materials. Furthermore, crystal growth occurs at the interfaces between the growing crystals and the <b>supply</b> <b>media.</b> An understanding of the interfaces is therefore essential to understanding growth. Nanoscale crystal growth of three, two, and to some extent one-dimensional crystals has been explained in the context of crystalline interfaces. This understanding has helped improve production of nanostructures and devices that are both scientifically and commercially beneficial. This dissertation expands on the importance of interfaces and atomistic processes occurring at these interfaces; explaining the growth and control of different nanocrystals. A brief review of crystal growth terminology and theory is given. A new technology recently developed to produce compound semiconductor quantum dots is described {{within the context of the}} interfaces involved. The majority of the dissertation will focus on explaining and understanding growth of one-dimensional nanostructures, called nanowires, grown in a three-phase system. The currently accepted growth mechanism for nanowires of this type is the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism. The VLS and similar mechanisms lack details about the atomistic processes involved in wire growth. When these atomistic processes are examined, it is revealed that there are several different names describing what are proposed to be ?different? mechanisms that in reality rely on the same atomistic processes. The key to understanding nanowire growth lies in understanding the atomistic processes occurring at the interfaces. Due to the fundamental similarities in the mechanisms with different names, the name ?Preferential Phase-Boundary Nucleation? (PPBN) is suggested as a replacement for the many different names. Unlike previous names this name is relevant to the processes as well as emphasizing the importance of the phases and the interfaces. A better understanding of interfaces and the processes that occur at them leads to a greater understanding and control of the growth of crystalline nanostructures...|$|E
