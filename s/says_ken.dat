50|$|Terence Stamp <b>says</b> <b>Ken</b> Loach was {{inspired}} to write the film after meeting Carol White during Cathy Come Home:But he really didn’t write it; we didn’t really have a script.

And, consequently, it had to be Take One because each of us had cameras on us. So before a take, he’d say something to Carol, and then he would say something to me, and we only discovered once the camera was rolling that he’d given us completely different directions. That’s why he needed two cameras, because he needed the confusion and the spontaneity.|$|E

What would Bishop <b>Ken</b> <b>say?</b> Sometimes even she recollected the strange theory which had made him crave execution from the late King, seven years, yes, a little more than seven years ago, and marvel whether at that critical epoch he had indeed between life and death been snatched away to his native land of faery.

5000|$|It {{was chosen}} for opening night of Ebertfest 2010. Rotten Tomatoes {{currently}} ranks the film with a critics review of 70% rating (based on 20 reviews). Danny Peary wrote that the [...] "picture is unrelentingly downbeat and at times repulsive ... but I don't find it unwatchable - {{which is more than}} I could <b>say</b> if <b>Ken</b> Russell had directed this. The cinematography by Peter Biziou is extremely impressive {{and a few of the}} individual scenes have undeniable power." [...] Waters has expressed deep reservations about the film, saying that the filming had been [...] "a very unnerving and unpleasant experience ... we all fell out in a big way." [...] As for the film itself, he said: [...] "I found it was so unremitting in its onslaught upon the senses, that it didn't give me, anyway, as an audience, a chance to get involved with it," [...] although he had nothing but praise for Geldof's performance. David Gilmour stated (on the [...] "In the Studio with Redbeard" [...] episodes of The Wall, A Momentary Lapse of Reason and On an Island) that the conflict between him and Waters started with the making of the film. Gilmour also stated on the documentary Behind The Wall (which was aired on the BBC in the UK and VH1 in the US) that [...] "the movie was the less successful telling of The Wall story as opposed to the album and concert versions." [...] Although the symbol of the crossed hammers was a creation of the film and not related to any real racist group, it was adopted by white supremacist group the Hammerskins in the late 1980s. It earned its creators two British Academy Awards; 'Best Sound' for James Guthrie, Eddy Joseph, Clive Winter, Graham Hartstone & Nicholas Le Messurier; and 'Best Original Song' for Waters.|$|R

George Lanius, who was lead singer for the quintet, told Wayne Jancik in The Billboard Book of One-Hit Wonders that a Nashville DJ named Noel Ball discovered the group playing talent shows. [...] "He took us to Nasco Records. And he gave us 'Oh, Julie' to record. The label <b>says</b> Ball and <b>Ken</b> Moffit wrote it, but if the truth were to be known, it was Moffit's song."

The song featured backing vocals by Janice Green, {{who happened to be}} auditioning at the recording studio where the single was recorded. They recorded two more singles for Nasco which flopped, then disbanded by 1959.

Reese testified, [...] "I was told that when he was brought in, he was combative, that they took him up to the room and during the interrogation he passed." [...] Reese stated the corpse was locked in a shower room overnight, which is where he first saw him. Reese says he was first told the man had died of a heart attack, but when he saw him he [...] "was bleeding from the head, nose, mouth".

60|$|Rilla {{hung up the}} 'phone {{and flew}} to Jims. But she did not wring that injured infant's neck.

After this Jims was relieved to find that she returned to sanity, gave him {{the rest of his}} dinner properly, and tucked him away for his afternoon nap with the little lullaby he loved best of all. She sewed at Red Cross shirts {{for the rest of the}} afternoon and built a crystal castle of dreams, all a-quiver with rainbows. Ken wanted to see her--to see her alone. That could be easily managed. Shirley wouldn't bother them, father and mother were going to the Manse, Miss Oliver never played gooseberry, and Jims always slept the clock round from seven to seven. She would entertain Ken on the veranda--it would be moonlight--she would wear her white georgette dress and do her hair up--yes, she would--at least in a low knot at the nape of her neck. Mother couldn't object to that, surely. Oh, how wonderful and romantic it would be!

6000|$|The {{ceremonial}} of the Sabbath meetings {{was very}} strict. The Foul Fiend was very rigid in exacting the most ceremonious attention from his votaries, {{and the title}} of Lord when addressed by them. Sometimes, however, the weird sisters, when whispering amongst themselves, irreverently spoke of their sovereign {{by the name of}} Black John; upon such occasions the Fiend rushed on them like a schoolmaster who surprises his pupils in delict, and beat and buffeted them without mercy or discretion, <b>saying,</b> [...] "I <b>ken</b> weel eneugh what you are saying of me." [...] Then might be seen the various tempers of those whom he commanded. Alexander Elder, in Earlseat, often fell under his lord's displeasure for neglect of duty, and, being weak and simple, could never defend himself save with tears, cries, and entreaties for mercy; but some of the women, according to Isobel Gowdie's confession, had more of the spirit which animated the old dame of Kellyburn Braes. Margaret Wilson, in Auldearne, would [...] "defend herself finely," [...] and make her hands save her head, after the old Scottish manner. Bessie Wilson could also speak very crustily with her tongue, and [...] "belled the cat" [...] with the devil stoutly. The others chiefly took refuge in crying [...] "Pity! mercy!" [...] and such like, while Satan kept beating them with wool cards and other sharp scourges, without attending to their entreaties or complaints. There were attendant devils and imps, who served the witches. They were usually distinguished by their liveries, which were sad-dun, grass-green, sea-green, and yellow. The witches were taught to call these imps by names, some of which might belong to humanity, while others had a diabolical sound. These were Robert the Jakis, Saunders the Red Reaver, Thomas the Feary, Swein, an old Scandinavian Duerg probably; the Roaring Lion, Thief of Hell, Wait-upon-Herself, MacKeeler, Robert the Rule, Hendrie Craig, and Rorie. These names, odd and uncouth enough, are better imagined at least than those which Hopkins contrived for the imps which he discovered--such as Pyewacket, Peck-in-the-Crown, Sack-and-Sugar, News, Vinegar-Tom, and Grizell Greedigut, the broad vulgarity of which epithets shows what a flat imagination he brought to support his impudent fictions.|$|R
60|$|So Thursday sixteenth June Patk. Dignam laid in clay of an {{apoplexy}} {{and after}} hard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water a fifty mile or thereabout with turf saying the seed won't sprout, fields athirst, very sadcoloured and stunk mightily, the quags and tofts too. Hard {{to breathe and}} all the young quicks clean consumed without sprinkle this long while back as no man remembered to be without. The rosy buds all gone brown and spread out blobs and on the hills nought but dry flag and faggots that would catch at first fire. All the world saying, for aught they knew, the big wind of last February a year that did havoc the land so pitifully a small thing beside this barrenness. But by and by, as said, this evening after sundown, the wind sitting in the west, biggish swollen clouds {{to be seen as}} the night increased and the weatherwise poring up at them and some sheet lightnings at first and after, past ten of the clock, one great stroke with a long thunder and in a brace of shakes all scamper pellmell within door for the smoking shower, the men making shelter for their straws with a clout or kerchief, womenfolk skipping off with kirtles catched up soon as the pour came. In Ely place, Baggot street, Duke's lawn, thence through Merrion green up to Holles street a swash of water flowing that was before bonedry and not one chair or coach or fiacre seen about but no more crack after that first.

Mulligan a gentleman's gentleman that had but come from Mr Moore's the writer's (that was a papish but is now, folk say, a good Williamite) chanced against Alec.

Bloom there for a languor he had but was now better, be having dreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll with red slippers on in a pair of Turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be for a change and Mistress Purefoy there, that got in through pleading her belly, and now on the stools, poor body, two days past her term, the midwives sore put to it and can't deliver, she queasy for a bowl of riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks, they say, but God give her soon issue.
