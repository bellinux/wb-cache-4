Specifically {{the focus is on}} emerging vertical ties between NPOs and ruling and governing elites. Drawing on qualitative data collected from health and education NPOs in three industrial regions, we find that in establishing such vertical ties the role of organisations and individuals within is changing ? they have moved away from ignored outsiders towards accessing the circles of power and being tasked with managing the boundary between the state and civil society. In exploring these arrangements this paper highlights that in the post-soviet space, NPOs and the state are closely intertwined resembling co-optation. As a result the democratisation potential of human <b>service</b> <b>NPOs</b> is constrained. In discussing these insights we also draw parallels to contexts in which the state has outsourced welfare service to human <b>service</b> <b>NPOs.</b> publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This journal {{issue is}} Special Issue: Symposium on Collaborative Governance in Mainland China and Hong Kong: Issues and PerspectivesThis article {{examines}} the factors influencing network formation among social <b>service</b> nonprofit organizations (<b>NPOs)</b> in Hong Kong and aims to illustrate the value of comparative studies of network formation. We argue that two distinct funding regimes, namely a statist-corporatist regime and a liberal regime, are present in Hong Kong. Based {{on the characteristics of}} these funding regimes, we examine five factors affecting the size of networks: organizational size, joint-action experience, resource dependency, program needs, and environmental uncertainty. Our study shows that social <b>service</b> <b>NPOs</b> that were formed in two different historical time periods display markedly different operational behavior in networking. While the joint-action experience and program needs of an organization demonstrate a consistent influence on the network formation of NPOs, the effects of organizational size and resource dependency on network size are moderated by environmental uncertainty. We contend that, due to historical and political contexts that are unique to this region, hybridity may be a characteristic of state-nonprofit relations in Greater China. Such unique contexts give rise to patterns of network formation and collaborative governance that may have important implications for state-nonprofit relations and civil society development. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Adopting a process-based HRM lens, {{this study}} {{addresses}} how nonprofit workers perceive their HR practices {{and the ways}} in which these perceptions of HRM impact their wellbeing. Drawing on a multiple case study of eight social <b>services</b> <b>NPOs</b> in the UK, the impact of the employment relationship on the psychological, social and physical dimensions of wellbeing is examined in this climate of austerity. The findings highlight the increasing precariousness of this employment relationship alongside relatively weak HR systems characterized by low consistency and consensus, leading to variation in the interpretation and application of HR practices at the level of line managers and the front-line. Moreover, the analysis shows how these divergent perceptions amongst HR system features manifest themselves in unintended consequences. By examining employee perceptions of HR practices, this study contributes to ongoing debates on why nonprofit employees view HRM in unintended ways and why HR practices may fail to bring about their intended effects.

30|$|These two {{analytical}} approaches can {{be grouped}} under two names: “dualism” and “holism.” The {{relationship between the}} state and civil society, in general, requires a switch from confrontation to cooperation (Yu, 2005). With the prevalence of the new managerialism and neo-liberalism, the government and NPOs cooperate crossing the boundaries in order to increase efficiency in both problem-solving and public resource usage. In this context, a new public management theory has emerged over time (Zhou and Dang 2013). But operation of this mechanism often requires cooperation between the government and social organizations, and this is only possible after eliminating the state-society boundary so as to promote cross-sectoral cooperation. The Western governments aim to reduce the transaction costs and promote the interdependence of organizations within the market by blurring boundaries (Kettle 2009 : 157). Some governments, as service purchasers, provide budgeted funds to the <b>NPO</b> that provides <b>service.</b> <b>NPOs</b> are best identified as “policy entrepreneurs” that influence policy-making and execution (Najam 2000). Yet the organizations also need to protect themselves from being controlled by their partners (Kettle 2009 : 157). At the present stage, the boundaries between the public, nonprofits, and for-profit enterprises are not clear.|$|R

40|$|Decreases in {{government}} funding for welfare {{and social services}} in Australia have accelerated the emergence of non-profit organisations (NPOs), particularly community NPOs. Community NPOs are integral components of Australian society, particularly in Queensland. They provide essential services {{with the help of}} volunteers. Hence, this study was undertaken to understand how workplace relationships affect volunteers’ attitudes and behaviours such as job satisfaction, affective commitment and intention to stay in community NPOs. This understanding will help managers in the community NPOs to plan their volunteer retention strategies, reduce high dropout rates, and attract new volunteers. Using social exchange theory as an analytical lens, this study examined the impact of its constructs (perceived organisational support (POS) and leader member exchange (LMX)) on volunteers’ job satisfaction, affective commitment and intention to stay. Social exchange theory provides {{a better understanding of the}} impact of management on workplace outcomes. A model was developed that shows the relationships between the independent variables and dependent variables, with motive fulfilment represented in the model as a mediator. Using a quantitative approach, a cross-sectional survey technique was applied to collect data from five community <b>service</b> <b>NPOs</b> in Queensland, Australia. The data collected from 218 participants were analysed with SPSS 22. 0. Simple linear regression and multiple regression analysis were used to examine the hypotheses. The results show that the independent variables (perceived organisational support and leader-member exchange) had a significant impact on the dependent variables (volunteer job satisfaction, affective commitment and intention to stay) in the community NPOs investigated. In addition, the fulfilment of most of the motives partially mediated the influence of the independent variables on the dependent variables. These results confirm previous findings and contribute new knowledge about the impact of workplace relationships on volunteers’ attitudes and behaviours, especially as they relate to the influence of motive fulfilment in the relationship between POS and LMX and the identified workplace outcomes in this study...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedThis {{dissertation}} breaks new grounds by {{investigating the}} role {{of different types of}} nonprofits in influencing the environmental policy outcomes. It explores {{the role of}} environmental ethics of nonprofits in their influence on environmental policy outcomes. Using Environmental Response Inventory (ERI) survey instrument (McKechnie, 1974), it empirically approximates the values for the environmental ethics of five types of nonprofits (environmental, fraternal, professional, religious and social services). It shows that social services nonprofits which are slightly more ecocentric than other types of nonprofits are significantly related to reduced levels of air pollution over time at the local level. The efforts of environmental NPOs at the state and federal levels seem to support and are supported by the implementation efforts of social <b>services</b> <b>NPOs</b> at the local level to improve environmental quality.; On the methodological front, this research employs the amount of carbon monoxide in air as the dependent variable and a measure of policy outcomes. Developing a comprehensive empirical model which includes most of the variables indicated by the literature to impact air quality, as well as the nonprofits at the local level, it shows that nonprofits are significantly related to levels of carbon monoxide pollution in air at the local level. Using a time series model extended over 5 years, it demonstrates that social services nonprofits in particular are strongly related to the improvement in carbon monoxide pollution in air at the zip code level.; Although ample literature exists on the role of nonprofits in policy formulation, not much is reported on the role of nonprofits in policy implementation. Drawing from the policy implementation theories of top-down (Mazmanian and Sabatier, 1989) and bottom-up (Lipsky, 1980), this research demonstrates, using data from Southern California, that nonprofits employ different combinations of both top-down and bottom-up channels of influencing policy implementation at the individual level. At the network level nonprofits of different kinds use the strategies of collaboration, confrontation and networking with public agencies to influence policy implementation. The differences in strategies of different types of NPOs are attributable to the differences in the emphasis of their service delivery and advocacy efforts...|$|R
40|$|Aging {{population}} {{has become an}} important issue and challenge in most Western Europe countries. This substantive change is likely to deeply affect the structure and the way our societies work (European commission, 2012 a). Furthermore, aging population and its consequences are now a sensitive topic in policy at both European and national levels, especially concerning budget discussions and the increased societal costs linked to the phenomenon (European commission, 2012 b). However, at more local scales, the topic is not fully integrated in urban or regional policies yet. This situation {{can be seen as}} a paradox since local collectivities will have to concretely deal with the impacts and the growing needs linked to ageing (Mercenier and Mérette, 2001; Rosenberg and Everitt, 2001). This current action research was initiated by the subregional comity for employment and training for the Verviers district. It primarily aims at bringing out the needs and wishes of the aging population living in the French-speaking part of Verviers district (20 municipalities and 200. 000 inhabitants). Considering the number and the diversity of territorial actors involved (services providers, public institutions, politicians, training <b>services,</b> <b>NPOs,</b> public transportation, labor and employer unions, etc.) and topics (housing, nursing and health care, home services, mobility etc.), the project managers naturally leaned toward territorial intelligence methods and participatory governance models. Additionally, demographic models predict a 10. 000 people over 65 year-olds growth in the district for the next ten years, which equals a 25 % growth compared to the actual population (Gédap UCL and IWEPS, 2012). This massive increase, caused by the postwar baby-boom, also highlights the necessity of a strategic and proactive research. In this context, SEGEFA-ULg was integrated to the project for its expertise in territorial intelligence (Breur et al., 2009; Breuer et al., 2010) as well as the added-value of its potential partnership with ThéMa (UFC) to implement the Catalyse toolkit (Girardot and Masselot, 2006; Girardot and Masselot, 2009) and the GDRI-INTI network. The project was articulated around the collaboration between partners to identify economically viable and socially fair development actions. In a first step, this lecture will discuss the implementation of the project, the collaboration between the partners and how the Catalyse tools were applied. In the second, we will present the main results of the project and the Catalyse method, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the territorial intelligence methodology applied to the topic of aging population. ...|$|R

Numerous NPOs involved mostly their activities in cross-organizational cooperation with the governments and the private enterprises. However, due to the ambiguous marketing and vague organizations’ vision, NPOs faced challenges in accessing more funds. This study explores the causal relationships among of organizational vision, management strategies, and human resource management on NPOs’ service performance in order to discover the reasonable management methods. This study combined the interview and structural relationship method (SEM) to explore the relationships of vision, strategies, human resource and <b>service</b> performance on <b>NPO</b> management. A total of 529 participants from five NPOs volunteered {{to participate in the}} study. All of them are employees whose works are related to foreign affairs. Questionnaires were used to collect the quantitative data, and AMOS software was used for the SEM analysis. Interview results showed that because of the limitation of funds, NPOs must maintain their excellent quality in services, and in advance, focus on maintaining the best public image to get additional funds from the government and other enterprises. Internally, they must focus on the management efficiency and make innovative business strategies to ensure a good impression. For human resource management, based on the different characteristics and willingness of employees in jobs, NPOs should assign suitable works for individuals {{in order to keep the}} organization's morale and coherence. Furthermore, based on the SEM, the organization's vision has a positive significant impact on management strategies, and management strategies have a positive significant impact on human resource management. However, the vision, strategies and human resources have no noticeable influence on <b>service</b> performance in <b>NPOs...</b>|$|R
40|$|This article {{argues that}} the nonprofit case for {{corporate}} volunteering is complex, requiring a multi-level perspective on the outcomes for nonprofit organizations (NPOs). To develop this perspective, we adopted an inductive research approach, conducting 39 exploratory semi-structured interviews with NPO staff. We argue that NPO scholars and practitioners should disentangle individual and organizational-level outcomes resulting from interactions between corporate volunteers and NPO staff, as such micro-dynamics ultimately affect <b>NPO</b> <b>services.</b> Moreover, these outcomes are subject to conditions at the organizational level (e. g., involvement of intermediaries), {{as well as at}} the individual level (e. g., type of assignment). Our study highlights the complexity that should be considered when addressing the fundamental question of whether corporate volunteering contributes to the ability of NPOs to provide their services, and under what conditions. We therefore propose that corporate volunteer management within NPOs is inherently, albeit contingently, intertwined with the services that these organizations provide...|$|R

40|$|Traditional ways {{of funding}} not-for-profit organisations (NPOs) to deliver {{programs}} that address complex social problems {{are struggling to}} keep up with demand. Despite record high levels of government funding for NPOs, there is still a significant level of unmet need and new approaches to funding NPOs are being explored. There is increasing international interest in the potential of one particular type of social finance – social impact bonds (SIBs). A SIB restructures the relationships between government agencies, not-for-profit service delivery organisations and social investors such as charitable foundations and high net worth individuals. Under a SIB, a bond-issuing organisation raises capital from investors based on a contract with government to deliver improved social outcomes that generate future government costs savings. These savings are used to pay investors a reward in addition to the repayment of the principal, if the agreed outcomes are achieved. SIBs support social innovation by providing a mechanism for investors to fund programs based on early intervention, prevention or breaking the cycle of dependence. They offer the potential to achieve significantly better social outcomes and deliver future costs savings for government. SIBs provide a new model for the sharing of risk between government, NPOs and social investors. They utilise commercial investment expertise and market discipline for the delivery of public <b>services</b> by <b>NPOs.</b> SIBs, it should be emphasised, are not a panacea. Their use should complement existing modes used to fund community benefit goals. In this report, the Centre for Social Impact   has addressed two key questions: 1. Whether the SIB concept is feasible in a New South Wales (NSW) context; and 2. Whether NSW has the necessary ingredients: market conditions, NGO capacity, social investment interest and government preparedness, for this new approach to funding. To answer these questions, CSI held detailed discussions with and considered the perspectives of NPOs, social investors/philanthropists and government agencies. The overarching conclusions are that CSI believes that the SIB concept is feasible and NSW does have the necessary ingredients, although there is much work to be done to deliver a SIB pilot...|$|R

This changed {{in the summer of}} 2008 when from June 1, 2008, until August 24, 2008, the Netherlands Public Broadcasting (NPO) organisations made their primary channel, NPO 1 temporary available in HD. This made it possible to broadcast Euro 2008, the 2008 Tour de France, and the 2008 Summer Olympics in HD and additionally allowed them to test their systems before the scheduled launch of their permanent HD service in early 2009. The NPO planned to launch their permanent HD service with HD versions of their three channels NPO 1, NPO 2, and NPO 3. Most of the programming in the early stages will consists of upscaled material from their parent channels as in time more programs will become available in HD. Technicolor Netherlands, the company responsible for the technical realisation of the broadcasts of the NPOs television and radio channels, began the summer 2008 test broadcast of NPO 1 HD in 720p/50 as the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) recommends.

40|$|With {{the help}} of {{appropriate}} IT support, health care services can be executed in a more effective and secure way. In Sweden, the NPÖ (National Patients’ Översikt) stands for National Patients’ Overview. It is a platform where authorized health care providers can access comprehensive and continuous information about health care and patients’ situation, based on which care providers can offer safe and qualified <b>services.</b> The <b>NPÖ</b> project is focusing on the information sharing phase. In order to improve the efficiency and correctness of care services, {{the next step is}} that health care systems can offer clinical suggestions and warnings with the existing patients’ data and medication information. Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) are aimed to offer such assistance and are necessary to be integrated. But by now, there is no explicit architecture to guide Swedish government to implement the integration. Although some architectures have been proposed for integrating CDSSs in health information systems, those architectures are developed for certain use cases and cannot be adopted directly in NPÖ. An integration architecture which takes full consideration of NPÖ-adopting data types, message structures and interface types is needed. This thesis adopts constructive research method, which contains three main phases. First, related backgrounds about national electronic health care system, clinical decision supports system and integration techniques are introduced. Second, the integration architecture is constructed following service-oriented principles. Third, theoretical valuation work is finished by assessing system features and making interviews. This thesis takes advantage of service-oriented architecture to design an architecture with Clinical Decision Support (CDS) middleware for health care information system integration. With this structure, national electronic health care systems, such as NPÖ, can have interaction with various types of CDSSs to provide more efficient and secure health care. It offers united interfaces which enable different CDSSs with different developing platforms to communicate without obstacles. Unlike the existing CDSS integration architectures, the new one with CDS Middleware can provide maximized scalability. Evaluation work has been done from two aspects. Feature criteria and interviews with national health care system developers indicate that the architecture can {{contribute to the development of}} NPÖ, and future works such as involving security agents can be continued to optimize the results...|$|R
40|$|Formal {{succession}} planning strategies for retiring Baby Boomer {{generation of leaders}} in nonprofit organizations (NPOs) are nonexistent in many NPOs, including faith-based NPOs. Top NPO leaders possess vital organizational knowledge and experience. The lack of strategic {{succession planning}} adversely affects organizational sustainability and mission fulfillment. Guided by the conceptual framework of knowledge transfer, the current study supplies a description of succession planning strategies used in faith-based organizations that have Boomer leaders. This multiple case study included 3 faith-based NPOs in Miami-Dade and Broward Counties in Florida and their top-level leaders. They supplied descriptions of formal succession planning strategies through semistructured interviews and through related organizational documents. An inductive {{analysis of the data}} revealed that (a) key leaders were the initiators for developing a strategic plan for succession, (b) boards of directors were critical to the process, and (c) leadership transition, planned or unplanned, required preparation and documented policies that must be reviewed at regular intervals. Leadership development is a valuable practice, which contributes to succession planning strategy. Influential leaders and board members of NPOs may receive inspiration to engage in succession planning strategies to maintain capable and prepared leaders at the top levels of the organizations as a means to ensure organizational sustainability and mission fulfillment. Positive social change happens in communities by encouraging a positive societal culture and identity through uninterrupted <b>NPO</b> <b>services</b> and programs.

40|$|Abstract: The current {{economic}} climate of funding stringency has intensified {{the need for}} non-profit organisations (NPOs) to find new delivery models of their services {{as a way of}} creating greater efficiencies and reducing costs. Consideration of improvement to their back-office operations is one way of addressing overheads associated with delivery functions of NPOs so that they can continue to focus on their core business activities. The overheads for back-office functions are much larger for smaller NPOs (by about 10 - 15 percent) than the larger ones and interest in sharing services could appeal to that sector. One approach to reduce overhead costs is for two or more NPOs to collaborate in sharing office space and office equipment and, in some instances, outsourcing some functions, for example, human resources and information technology. Currently, in New Zealand, there is very little engagement by <b>NPOs</b> in sharing <b>services,</b> particularly back office computing services. It was against this background that meetings with representatives of eight NPOs in Wellington, New Zealand, identified the challenges they were facing. These included funding, client management, compliance with reporting (financial and non-financial), financial management and control, governance, marketing and promotion and retention and management of staff and volunteers. Wellington City Council, as a significant funding agent of some local NPOs, commissioned an online survey with the aim of understanding the interest and readiness of NPOs in adopting shared computing services. The survey was developed collaboratively with the council, a computing charitable trust and a local university. The objectives of the survey were: to provide a snapshot of computing usage within the organisations, identify significant issues challenging the sector and understand their perceptions of shared computing services. The perceptions of the Wellington region NPO representatives (147 valid surveys) regarding shared services are reported in this paper. Results reveal the factors that drive the uptake of shared services within the non-profit sector, the benefits, barriers and priorities of sharing computing services and respondents’ views on their willingness to pay for a shared <b>services</b> arrangement. <b>NPOs</b> were positive regarding potential benefits of a shared services arrangement but recognised potential barriers of privacy and security, a need for contractual relationships, shared vision and compliance and standardisation. Priorities for a proposed shared services model were identified as finance and management of data and knowledge. The majority of respondents indicated they were willing to pay up to five percent of their budget for a shared services arrangement. These results provide a basis for further study as to the type of shared services model that organisations would find acceptable and render efficiencies and cost savings.

40|$|This study {{explored}} the financial sustainability of NPOs within the South African context, post the 2008 economic crisis. The overall {{aim was to}} understand the factors which affect NPOs ability to financially sustain themselves. Trends of NPO income and expenditure were analysed and measures taken to address changes in the financial situation examined. The study explored different funding agencies and their role in supporting NPOs. Lastly, perceptions of governance, funding practice, and current situations in organisations were explored and recommendations made for the future. A quantitative methodology was adopted using the online survey tool Survey Gizmo. Secondary data in the form of financial statements were requested from NPOs. The Inyathelo data base of organisations made up the population of 469 organisations and responses were received from 101 organisations. This was a satisfactory 21, 5 % response rate. Data was analysed by calculating descriptive statistics. These were represented in a narrative and visually in the form of graphs and tables. Financial data was captured and analysed in order to corroborate the data. The research found that income to NPOs is not increasing to keep up with inflation. Demand for <b>NPO</b> <b>services</b> has increased due to the global economic crisis and as a result NPOs experience increasing pressure on their financial resources. NPOs are perceived to be critical to the well being of society but the sector is under pressure, with many showing a financial deficit. The sector is looking to government and corporates to help strengthen it, but are also wanting to become less dependent on external sources for their financial sustainability. NPOs are of the opinion that they need to find new strategies to ensure their sustainability. The following are key recommendations: NPOs must be creative about managing increased demand for their services;; NPOs should collaborate to advocate for changes in relationships with major financial contributors and work together to promote philanthropy in the country;; funders should adjust their funding models in order to strengthen the NPO sector while still focussing on the needs of beneficiaries...|$|R
