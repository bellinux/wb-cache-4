25|$|Transverse {{leaf spring}} and <b>solid</b> <b>axle</b> front {{suspension}} of early Ford cars.|$|E
25|$|Mk1 Introduced March 1984, the SA Swift was {{front wheel}} drive, with a <b>solid</b> <b>axle</b> and drum brakes on the rear, with front disc brakes.|$|E
25|$|The Alfa Romeo Spider {{was based}} on Giulia mechanicals, {{including}} its Alfa Romeo twin cam inline-four, independent front and <b>solid</b> <b>axle</b> rear suspension, and unibody construction, incorporating the relatively new principles of crumple zones into the front and rear. Following the evolution the other Giulia sport variants, the Spider was powered by a 1.6L engine, later received the 1.3L 1300, 1.8L 1750 and finally 2.0L 2000 engines. Unlike any other Giulia derivative, it was upgraded and continued to sell through four decades, into the 1990s.|$|E

50|$|Suspension: <b>solid</b> <b>axles,</b> leaf springs, {{rear wheels}} at balance-cart.|$|R
25|$|The Fairlane/Torino {{continued}} to be constructed with unit-construction like the 1967 models. The new car {{continued to}} use the same suspension as 1967 models, which was coil springs pivot mounted on an upper control arm and a strut stabilized lower control arms in front, with long semi-elliptical leaf springs on a <b>solid</b> <b>axle</b> in rear. A heavy-duty suspension option was available for V8 powered cars, and included extra-heavy-duty springs and shocks. Steering was recirculating ball system, with power steering optional. All cars came standard with four-wheel drum brakes, although front disc brakes and power assist were options.|$|E
25|$|The {{independent}} {{rear suspension}} Duntov created for Sting Ray was essentially a frame-mounted differential with U-jointed half-shafts tied together by a transverse leaf spring – a design derived from the CERV I concept. Rubber-cushioned struts carried the differential, which reduced ride harshness while improving tire adhesion, especially on rougher roads. The transverse spring was bolted {{to the rear of}} the differential case. A control arm extended laterally and slightly forward from each side of the case to a hub carrier, with a trailing radius rod mounted behind it. The half-shafts functioned like upper control arms. The lower arms controlled vertical wheel motion, while the trailing rods took care of fore/aft wheel motion and transferred braking torque to the frame. Shock absorbers were conventional twin-tube units. Considerably lighter than the old <b>solid</b> <b>axle,</b> the new rear suspension array delivered a significant reduction in unsprung weight, which was important since the 1963 model would retain the previous generation's outboard rear brakes. The new model's front suspension would be much as before, with unequal-length upper and lower A-arms on coil springs concentric with the shocks, plus a standard anti-roll bar. Steering remained the conventional recirculating-ball steering design, but it was geared at a higher 19.6:1 overall ratio (previously 21.0:1). Bolted to the frame rail at one end and to the relay rod at the other was a new hydraulic steering damper (essentially a shock absorber), which helped soak up bumps before they reached the steering wheel. What's more, hydraulically assisted steering would be offered as optional equipment for the first time on a Corvette – except on cars with the two most powerful engines – and offer a faster 17.1:1 ratio, which reduced lock-to-lock turns from 3.4 to just 2.9.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{benefit of}} <b>solid</b> <b>axle</b> {{vehicles}} is {{they tend to}} be easier and cheaper to [...] "lift" [...] with aftermarket suspension systems. This increases the distance between the axle and chassis of the vehicle. By increasing this distance, larger tires can be installed, which will increase the ground clearance, allowing it to traverse even larger and more difficult obstacles. In addition to higher ground clearance, many owners aim to increase suspension articulation or [...] "flex" [...] to give their Jeeps greatly improved off-road capabilities. Good suspension articulation keeps all four wheels in contact with the ground and maintains traction.|$|E
50|$|The 3Ro used {{a ladder}} frame and leaf spring-suspended <b>solid</b> <b>axles</b> front and rear.|$|R
5000|$|Rear axle: Special {{attachment}} points, {{integral to}} the rear quick release skewer or bolted onto <b>solid</b> <b>axles,</b> hold dropouts cut into the trailer hitch.|$|R
25|$|<b>Solid</b> <b>axles</b> {{were used}} at both ends. Pressed metal discs {{were used for}} all 4 wheel rims (very modern for the time). Braking was by drums.|$|R
2500|$|Station wagons {{now used}} a unique [...] {{wheelbase}} and were larger than ever before. Station wagons {{continued to use}} unique model names. The Kingswood Estate wagon {{was considered to be}} equivalent to the Chevrolet Caprice being the top level wagon. Unlike previous years, station wagons used unique rear suspension using a <b>solid</b> <b>axle</b> with leaf springs as opposed to coil springs and trailing arms on sedans and coupes. Also new was the [...] "Glide-Away" [...] clam shell style disappearing tailgate. This design had the glass upper portion of the tailgate slide into the roof, and the lower steel portion slide into a compartment under the floor, providing a completely open space with no tailgate in sight.|$|E
2500|$|The {{biggest change}} for the Torino was the switch to body-on-frame {{construction}} from the unit-construction of the 1971 models. The new chassis was a perimeter design {{that was used to}} help give the Torino a quieter and more isolated ride. It featured an energy absorbing [...] "S" [...] shaped front end, torque boxes to isolate road shock, fourteen rubber body mounts and five solid cross members. The front suspension used an unequal length control arm design, with a computer selected coil spring mounted on the strut stabilized lower control arm, much like the fullsize Ford LTD. The rear used the [...] "Stabul" [...] four link suspension with a computer selected coil spring mounted on a <b>solid</b> <b>axle.</b> The new suspension and chassis had a wheel track at least [...] wider than the 1971 models. [...] Motor Trend stated the [...] "road isolation and vibrational dampening is superb" [...] in its test of a 1972 Gran Torino Brougham 4-door. Ford offered two suspension options, the heavy-duty and competition suspension. The heavy-duty suspension included a larger front sway bar, and heavy-duty springs and shocks. [...] Competition suspension, only available in two-door models, included the most heavy-duty springs and shocks, heavy duty rear upper control arms and bushings, a larger front sway bar, and the addition of a rear sway bar. This was the first year that a rear sway bar was offered in the Torino and was only available with competition and police suspension options. Front disc brakes became standard on all Torinos, which no other American intermediate (other than its sister car the Mercury Montego) offered in 1972, however, power brakes remained an option. [...] The only exceptions were that power brakes were standard on the Gran Torino Squire station wagons and a mandatory option for all [...] powered models. The power steering was revised to be integral in the steering box, rather than the external booster style used in previous years. All Torinos used 14-inch wheels, while 15-inch wheels were used for exclusively by police and taxi models.|$|E
2500|$|The Type E {{made its}} first {{straight}} hops on 26 April 1912 at the Handley Page field at Fairlop and was soon performing well enough to fly to the works at Barking, piloted by Edward Petre. [...] On 27 July it flew from Fairlop to Brooklands on a complicated 55 mile route avoiding the built-up parts of London. [...] In late September, after {{a period in which}} Handley Page were preoccupied with the military trials of the Type F and the move of their works from Barking to Cricklewood, the Type E was flown to Hendon by Wilfred Parke and then used to carry some 28 passengers on joy flights, including two children together. [...] It was also flown by other, non-company pilots until sustaining minor damage. [...] During repair the rectangular fin was replaced by a triangular one. [...] Handling was improved and several flights were made with three passengers before the aircraft was spruced up for its appearance at the Olympia Show in February 1913, where it was inspected by King George V. [...] Immediately afterwards a new wing was fitted with the wing warping system replaced by ailerons formed by hinging the outer trailing edge extensions; the earlier side-to-side rolling characteristic was cured. [...] The Type E flew exhibitions, demonstrations and joy rides through the Summer of 1913, mostly in the north of England. [...] It was then modified for use as an advanced single-seat trainer for a flying school at Hendon. [...] The fuselage was shortened by 14 in (356mm) and the separate pairs of fuselage struts that carried the wing bracing wires were replaced by a four-strut pyramid. The earlier undercarriage was replaced by a simpler arrangement of the kind used on the B.E.2c, with a <b>solid</b> <b>axle</b> and two skids. [...] It flew in that form on 4 July 1914 and was in use to the start of World War I, when it was first impressed, then discarded. [...] The aircraft did not fly again, but made a few celebratory outings and survived until 1940, when it was destroyed to make space in the Radlett factory. [...] In the retrospective type redesignation of 1924, the Yellow Peril or Type E became the H.P.5.|$|E
5000|$|The car had two leaf-sprung <b>solid</b> <b>axles</b> and four-wheel {{hydraulic}} brakes. It {{was available}} as four-door [...] "Limousine" [...] (sedan) or two-door convertible. 76 were made.|$|R

50|$|The <b>solid</b> <b>axle</b> Dana 50 {{was used}} in the Ford F-250 and the F-350 from 1998 to 2002. This axle was also the only OEM axle used in Four-wheel drive Ford Excursions. The GAWR of a <b>solid</b> <b>axle</b> Dana 50 is 5000 lbs.|$|E
50|$|The {{transmission}} was a 4-speed gearbox with a multi-plate wet clutch.The chassis was {{a conventional}} ladder frame, with <b>solid</b> <b>axles</b> sprung on semi-elliptic front and three-quarter-elliptic rear leaf springs. The brakes {{were on the}} transmission and on the rear wheels.|$|R
50|$|The 105 {{carried over}} the {{majority}} of its chassis and powertrain from the 80-series with coil suspended <b>solid</b> <b>axles</b> front and rear, and straight-6 petrol and diesel engines. These models were only sold in African, Australian, Russian, and South American markets.|$|R
