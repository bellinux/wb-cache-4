Films made in the 1960s were often influenced by Japanese yakuza films, dealing with internal conflict between members of a gang or external conflict with other gangs. The gangsters' code of conduct and loyalty are important elements. Starting in the 1970s, strict censorship caused decline in the number and quality of gangster movies, and none were made in the 1980s.In the late 1980s and early 1990s there was a <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> <b>imports</b> of action movies from Hong Kong.The first of the new wave of important home grown gangster movies was Im Kwon-taek's General's Son (1990). Although this movie followed the earlier tradition, it was followed by a series of sophisticated gangster noirs set in contemporary urban locations, such as A Bittersweet Life (2005).|$|E
50|$|While {{the time}} before World War II was filled with issues {{regarding}} price, the post war era consisted of increasing oil imports {{partly due to the}} price support established during the 1920s and 1930s. The artificially high domestic prices led to a <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> <b>imports</b> from lower priced foreign producers. In 1955, a clause was added to the Reciprocal Trade Act Amendments which gave the president the power to limit imports of a specific commodity, if that particular commodity was harmful to the security of the nation. This clause allowed Eisenhower to enact oil import quotas in 1959 which ultimately caused international oil prices to decline. These import quotas restricted international oil companies from the US market, and led them to form OPEC. During the 1970s, Richard Nixon put in place many phrases of price controls. After many new regulations that altered the original price control system, President Carter eventually began removing these controls in 1979. During the Carter administration, in response to an energy crisis and hostile Iranian and Soviet Union relations, President Jimmy Carter announced the Carter Doctrine which declared that any interference with U. S. interests in the Persian Gulf would be considered an attack on U.S. vital interests. Ronald Reagan later expanded this doctrine. Since the 1990s, the oil market has been free of most regulations.|$|E

The macroeconomic counterpart {{of this is a}} decline in private savings. This paper discusses the impact of policy uncertainty on private savings. The author uses the Ordinal Certainty Equivalence approach to establish that trade policy uncertainty by itself will further reduce savings if: (a) there is a positive risk aversion; and (b) the intertemporal substitution elasticity exceeds 1. The result shows that, with positive risk aversion, policy uncertainty will in fact reinforce the negative savings impact of an anticipated policy reversal, especially when that negative impact is strong. This suggests that with high risk aversion and high intertemporal substitution, a rapid trade reform that is not fully credible may depress private savings significantly, with attendant negative impact on the current account.

About the inquiry On 21 June 2013, the Australian Government asked the Commission to inquire into whether safeguard action under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules is justified against imports of selected processed fruit products falling within subheading 2008 of the Australian Customs Tariff. The subheading is defined as: Fruit, nuts and other edible parts of plants, otherwise prepared or preserved, {{whether or not containing}} added sugar or other sweetening matter or spirit, not elsewhere specified or included. As specified in the terms of reference, the inquiry covers products under the following tariff classifications: 	 2008. 30. 00 (citrus) 	 2008. 40. 00 (pears) 	 2008. 50. 00 (apricots) 	 2008. 70. 00 (peaches) 	 2008. 97. 00 (mixtures) 	 2008. 99. 00 (other).

40|$|Dumping is {{generally}} considered an unfair practice and through the Antidumping Agreement of the GATT many governments offer protection to domestic producers against dumped goods. In 1992 and 1998 large amounts of steel entered the U. S. at low prices, and large amounts of antidumping investigations were initiated in order to curb the <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> <b>imports</b> flooding the country. The increase in steel imports in 1992 {{was related to the}} laps of the voluntary export restraints, while the increase in 1998 was a result of the collapse of the Asian markets in 1997. “The 1998 U. S. Steel Crisis” that followed the significant increase in steel imports caused domestic turmoil in the U. S., but there is reason to question if there really was a major crisis. Further, the U. S. steel sector has been receiving considerable amounts of protection during the last three decades and the difficulties it has been facing may well be due to inefficiency in the U. S. sector rather unfair trade practices in foreign markets. Japanese iron and steel exports have traditionally been a major target of U. S. antidumping investigations. Significant amounts of antidumping investigations were initiated in both 1992 and 1999, in an attempt to hinder iron and steel imports from Japan and provide protection to the domestic producers. The success was however recognized as limited, mainly due to the specific nature of the antidumping measure. Trade data shows the trade effects of antidumping investigations on targeted trade were far from negligible and {{there is reason to believe}} the investigations caused trade diversion and speculation, which in turn suggest the antidumping measure tends to seal off markets and is likely to increase uncertainty in world trade...|$|E

About the inquiry On 21 June 2013, the Australian Government asked the Commission to inquire into whether safeguard action under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules is justified against imports of processed tomato products falling within tariff subheading 2002. 10. 00. 60 of the Australian Customs Tariff. The terms of reference are reprinted {{at the beginning of}} this report. Safeguard action is temporary, ‘emergency action’ (using tariffs, tariff-quotas or quotas) implemented in situations where a <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> <b>imports</b> causes or threatens to cause serious injury to a domestic industry. Safeguard measures may be applied for up to four years, and may be extended for a further four years, subject to several conditions (Commonwealth of Australia Special Gazette No. S 297, 1998). The Commission is to provide a report to the Australian Government by 20 December 2013 on whether safeguard measures are justified. In addition, the Commission is to provide an ‘accelerated report’ by 20 September 2013, as to whether provisional safeguard measures should be put in place. According to Article 6 of the WTO Agreement on Safeguards, provisional measures may be implemented: [i]n critical circumstances where delay would cause damage which it would be difficult to repair … pursuant to a preliminary determination that there is clear evidence that increased imports have caused or are threatening to cause serious injury. The terms of reference require the Commission to conduct the safeguards inquiry in line with the criteria set out in the Commonwealth of Australia Special Gazette No. S 297, as amended by No. GN 39 (reprinted in appendix B). These criteria largely mirror the terms of the WTO Agreement on Safeguards. They stipulate that before recommending any safeguard measures, the Commission must: 	determine whether safeguard measures would be justified under the WTO Agreement and, if so, 	consider what measures would be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and to facilitate adjustment. Australia’s procedures for safeguard inquiries go beyond what is essential under the WTO Agreement. In assessing whether measures should be implemented, the Commission must also have regard to the Government’s requirements for assessing the impact of regulation which affects business. This requires the Commission to subject any proposed measures to a regulatory impact assessment of the community-wide costs and benefits, before making a recommendation. Under WTO rules, a government can only take safeguard action (whether final or provisional) if its ‘competent authority’ finds that action is justified. Although the government can choose not to act, if it does take action it cannot impose measures greater than those considered appropriate by the authority (in this case, the Productivity Commission) ...|$|E

40|$|A {{century has}} passed since the Government of Canada adopted the first {{recorded}} antidumping law in 1904. The Canadian legislation was soon followed by similar legislation {{in most of the}} major trading nations in the industrialized world prior to and after World War I. Antidumping provisions were later incorporated into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) following World War II. Nowadays, virtually all of the industrialized and developing countries in the world economy have adopted antidumping legislation. In view of the long and increasingly widespread use of antidumping measures, we marked the centennial of Canada’s 1904 legislation with a symposium at the University of Michigan on March 12, 2004. The symposium papers document the experiences with antidumping and then ask whether and how antidumping can be reformed. Although we all would probably agree that the best solution would be to retract all antidumping legislation, this is unlikely to happen in the foreseeable future. Antidumping laws serve a variety of purposes, and powerful political forces {{stand in the way of}} eliminating these laws. Antidumping provides a stronger and more focused means of safeguards protection against <b>surges</b> <b>of</b> <b>imports</b> than GATT-legal safeguards laws permit. Antidumping also formalizes a meaning for “unfair trade” that, though essentially meaningless from an economic standpoint, strikes a chord in public perception. And finally, in spite of its appearance of being constrained by objective administrative rules, antidumping in practice is a potent political tool that governments are able to manipulate in order to satisfy powerful constituents. With all this going for it, antidumping is unlikely ever to be relinquished as an economic policy tool by governments. ...|$|R
40|$|Korean {{competitiveness}} {{in rural}} communities and agriculture has considerably diminished due to the 'market opening' for agricultural products: sudden <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> <b>imported</b> agricultural products [...] > oversupply of domestic agricultural products and a fall in their prices [...] > aggravation of farm incomes [...] > weakening of agricultural sector basis. As a result, there is a decline in rural farm income and population. Therefore, the conditions of settling in rural areas have become worse {{in the chain of}} vicious circle. As part of an increasing farm diversification to solve the crisis of the Korean agricultural sector, nowadays the agri-tourism attracts considerable public attention. The meaning of 'agri-tour' as a social phenomenon is a process of switching the resources of agricultural amenities into lucrative market values. Thus, the cultural, natural and environmental resources scattered all over the countryside, - which have existed and still exist regardless of consumers' will to pay for them - have been programming into more systematic tour experiences, eco-friendly products, accommodations and agricultural events & festivals. etc. Korean agri-tourism is in the stage of quantitative growth, but it is now a turning point from quantitative growth into further qualitative development. Thus, new objective and strategy are needed, and they can be epitomized into 'international strategy' in a word. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate the international strategy of Korean agri-tourism through the various examples of Western countries (France, UK, etc.) as benchmark models in this analyze. The internationalization of agri-tourism can be divided into two categories: quality improvement and expanding induction of foreign tourists.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{attempts}} a {{quantitative assessment of}} the impact of recently signed ASEAN-India FTA (AIFTA) for selected plantation commodities (coffee, tea and pepper) in India. We use partial equilibrium modeling approach (SMART model and gravity model) to simulate the likely <b>import</b> increase <b>of</b> the plantation commodities under the proposed tariff reduction schedule of the AIFTA. Overall, the results suggest that the AIFTA will cause significant increase in India’s <b>import</b> <b>of</b> plantation commodities. The increase in imports is mostly driven by trade creation rather than trade diversion. From the economic efficiency point of view, trade creation improves welfare as the new imports replace the high-cost domestic production. The analysis shows that the proposed tariff reduction may lead to significant tariff revenue loss to the government. However, the gain in consumer surplus (due to the fall in domestic price and the consequent reduction in dead-weight loss) outweighs the loss in tariff revenue leading to net welfare gain. By and large, the simulations based on the SMART and gravity models provide similar results on the magnitude of total increase in <b>imports.</b> The <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> new <b>imports</b> may have adverse impact for the livelihood of the Indian farmers engaged in the production of these commodities.

The result was a sharp decline in manufacturing output, low productivity levels, factory closures and massive job losses across the sector. The blow to the industry was exasperated by the <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> cheap <b>imports,</b> both legal and illegal, primarily coming from China. The poor performance and consequent contraction of the industry {{had a profound impact on}} the predominately female workers.

It finds that although the Western Cape clothing industry was the most severely hit by the challenges of global competition, it is now doing relatively well. Furthermore, it argues that the sector is upgrading and providing increased opportunities for women in terms of employment and skills development. This can be attributed to the changes in policy approach by government as well as new and improved production methodologies that are being adopted by firms.

The studies on the issue addressed increasing <b>import</b> dependency <b>of</b> the manufacturing sector in Turkey. This paper has attempted to scrutinize the reasons behind this phenomenon by looking {{not only at the}} manufacturing sector as the past studies did, but also at the other sectors of the economy. Using 1998 and 2002 Input -Output Tables, import requirement ratios have been calculated for 12 aggregate sectors. The results demonstrate that the contribution of the “wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and household goods” sector to the increasing import dependency, hence to significantly rising imports, is greater than that of the manufacturing sector.

40|$|Although many {{countries}} have adopted freer trade regimes {{or are in}} the pro-cess of reforming quantitative restrictions, such reforms are not without short-term costs. Sudden removal of quantitative restrictions can release a <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> demand for <b>imports</b> that can deplete foreign exchange reserves and force rapid adjustment by domestic industries. Five methods to more gradually liberalize quantitative restrictions are discussed: raising quota ceilings until they are non-binding; eliminating quotas product by product; converting quotas to equiva-lent tariffs and then reducing them; auctioning quota licenses; and converting quotas to tariff quotas, and then liberalizing these. The various instruments are evaluated according to their implications for the adjustment period, for gov-ernment revenue, for the balance of payments, and for {{the extent to which}} they are likely to produce political disruptions. M any developing countries have resorted to trade restrictions to limit imports as a whole, to ration scarce foreign exchange (limiting it to payments for essential imports), or to protect particular domestic in-dustries as part of a development program. Countries have used a seemingly baffling variety of policy instruments that have constrained and distorted trade: lists <b>of</b> banned <b>imports,</b> tariffs, surcharges, stamp fees, prior import de-posits, import quotas, tariff quotas, discretionary import licensing, foreign ex-change controls, multiple exchange rates, and local content requirements. And even this list is not exhaustive. Several factors have prompted countries to liberalize their trade regimes. One important influence has been the high rates of growth achieved by th...|$|R
40|$|Fiji {{has been}} {{experiencing}} current account deficits in its {{balance of payments}} since the late 1990 s, despite {{the emergence of a}} boom in remittances. The deficits have become increasingly more pronounced since 2001 due to a decline in the country's traditional exports of sugar, a sharp fall in the exports of garments following the expiry of the Multifibre Agreement, and a decrease in the exports of gold following operational problems. On the other hand, there was a <b>surge</b> in <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> capital goods and machinery for the building and construction industry, due mainly to expansionary fiscal policies pursued by the government since 2001. Additionally, a steep rise in private sector credit in the post-coup years of 2000 ensued, contributing to a further widening of current account deficit. This paper seeks to investigate whether the popular twin deficit hypothesis is relevant in the case of Fiji...|$|R
50|$|Despite {{persistently}} low {{investment in}} research by all five Central Asian republics, national development strategies are nonetheless focusing on developing knowledge economies and new high-tech industries. However, just five Kazakh patents were registered at the US Patent and Trademark Office between 2008 and 2013, compared to three for Uzbek inventors and {{none at all}} for the other three Central Asian republics, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.Kazakhstan is Central Asia’s main trader in high-tech products. Kazakh imports nearly doubled between 2008 and 2013, from US$2.7 billion to US$ 5.1 billion. There has been a <b>surge</b> in <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> computers, electronics and telecommunications; these products represented an investment of US$ 744 million in 2008 and US$ 2.6 billion five years later. The growth in exports was more gradual - from US$ 2.3 billion to US$ 3.1 billion - and dominated by chemical products (other than pharmaceuticals), which represented two-thirds of exports in 2008 (US$ 1.5 billion) and 83% (US$ 2.6 billion) in 2013.|$|R
40|$|Despite a {{substantial}} {{literature on the}} anti-dumping process and its consequences, the circum-stances surrounding the initiation of an anti-dumping petition are not well documented. While {{this is likely to}} be a many faceted decision, we isolate a number of common features associated with petitions using detailed monthly U. S. trade data preceding a filing. This detail allows the very precise measurement <b>of</b> <b>imports</b> and their changes. Specifically, we are able to decompose imports along a number of margins including price, quantity, number of shipments and number of customs districts served. Surprisingly, we find very little evidence <b>of</b> <b>import</b> <b>surges,</b> or <b>of</b> large reductions <b>of</b> <b>import</b> prices (typically both are relatively flat). Instead, there are significant re-allocations <b>of</b> <b>import</b> market shares toward countries named in a petition. These increases are driven by both more shipments (rather than larger shipments) and an increase in geographical scope (more customs districts served). Measures <b>of</b> <b>import</b> quantities and extensive margins of trade are also important for predicting the countries that are filed against. After controlling for such effects we find that poor countries in general, and China in particular, are especially susceptible to being named in an anti-dumping case. ...|$|R
