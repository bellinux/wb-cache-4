The effects of EGF on two in vitro passages of a human endometrial carcinoma cell line (RL 95 - 2), designated early (250, estrogen receptor negative), were studied with respect to their growth, morphology and invasive properties. The early passage was heterogeneous in population, while the late passage was more homogeneous and exhibited several transformed characteristics. EGF had differential effects depending on the <b>seeding</b> <b>density.</b> At high <b>seeding</b> <b>density,</b> EGF stimulated growth of early passage cells at all concentrations used; EGF stimulated growth of late passage cells at 16. 6 pM concentration while it inhibited their growth at 4. 98 nM and 20 nM concentrations. At low <b>seeding</b> <b>density,</b> only 20 nM EGF significantly inhibited growth of early passage cells, while the effects of EGF significantly inhibited growth of early passage cells, while the effects of EGF on late passage cells were similar to those at high <b>seeding</b> <b>density.</b> Marked morphological alterations occurred upon addition of 20 nM EGF to RL 95 - 2 cells at low <b>seeding</b> <b>densities.</b> Further, EGF (20 nM) increased the invasive potential of cells of both passages at high <b>seeding</b> <b>density,</b> while it decreased the invasive potential at low <b>seeding</b> <b>density.</b> The decrease in invasive potential correlated with extension of elongated processes by the cells, which could hinder their motility. The increase in invasive potential at high <b>seeding</b> <b>density</b> correlated with an increase in enzymic activity of cell-associated plasminogen activator, which could facilitate degradation of the reconstituted basement membrane matrix in vitro, and with an alteration in morphology and F-actin distribution, which could render the cells more motile. Further studies exploring a possible mechanism for the differential growth response of RL 95 - 2 to EGF at high <b>seeding</b> <b>density</b> indicated that early and late passage cells differed in the number and affinity of EGF receptors. The late passage cells exhibited a 5 -fold increase in receptor number over early passage cells and had both high (K(d) of 4. 47 x 10 ⁻¹¹ M) and low affinity receptors (K(d) of 9. 37 x 10 ⁻⁹ M), while the early passage cells had only a single class of high affinity receptors (K(d) of 5. 67 x 10 ⁻¹⁰ M).

If the <b>seed</b> <b>density</b> is too high and planted too early, there is increased exposure to the plant pathogen. This seeding practice also creates an ideal environment for the pathogen because the plants often produce larger canopies and experience more lodging, which creates a close, high-humidity environment ideal for the pathogen.

Six constructs per cell <b>seeding</b> <b>density</b> group were implanted. Histological and immunohistochemical evaluation was performed via hematoxylin and eosin, von Gieson, and α-sarcomeric actin staining protocols. Linear contractile force measurements were obtained for each construct following 4 weeks of in vivo implantation. After an implantation period of 4 weeks, the newly formed cardiac constructs contained within the chambers were harvested. The femoral vessels within the constructs were found to be patent in all cases.

50|$|Leymus arenarius {{can grow}} {{exponentially}} {{in terms of}} height and root growth {{in the presence of}} nitrogen. Leymus arenarius is known to take up nitrogen into its root system. Raising nitrogen concentrations can aid in growth as over time plant mass above to surface will not change, but will accumulate in the root system. The roots themselves also retain nitrogen as they come in contact with it and in the surrounding un-vegetated areas. This assists in primary succession with surrounding flora and fauna, and a decrease in soil erosion. After volcanic events L. arenarius causes dunes and their soil depth to grow exponentially over time. Nitrogen increases seed production, raising the yield of seeds as much as 70% in Icelandic L. arenarius. The <b>seed</b> <b>density</b> also increased with the addition of nitrogen, in comparison to phosphorus and potassium which only produce marginal increases for both seed yield and density.

In this dissertation I assessed the effects of tallgrass prairie plant diversity and <b>seeding</b> <b>density</b> on the provision of ecological functions and services including: 1) resistance to invasive plant species, 2) abundance and diversity of predatory invertebrates, 3) herbivory levels on two perennial forbs, and 4) soil development. In the spring of 2006, twenty-four 55 m 2 -plots were planted to six replicates in each of four treatments: high diversity sites of 97 species typically planted by The Nature Conservancy planted at a lower <b>seeding</b> <b>density,</b> high diversity sites at twice this seeding rate, and low diversity sites using a Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Conservation Reserve Program mix (CP 25; 15 species), at low and high <b>seeding</b> <b>densities.</b> This study is among the first to compare the ecological functions provided by grassland seed mixes commonly used by practitioners. Increasing plant community diversity was found to be more important than increasing <b>seeding</b> <b>density</b> for enhancing resistance to invasion by unsown perennial forbs and legumes and in reducing inflorescence production by Bromus inermis. There was a significant positive relationship between plant community diversity and the abundance of coccinellid beetles, but the abundance of ants, carabid beetles, and spiders showed no significant response to diversity or <b>seeding</b> <b>density.</b> <b>Seeding</b> <b>density</b> had a positive effect on carabid beetle and spider species richness and Shannon-Weaver diversity. Year was the main significant effect for explaining levels of herbivory damage in Ratibida columnifera and Solidago canadensis and there was a significant negative relationship between diversity and levels of soil nitrate. Overall, results indicate increasing diversity may be more important than increasing <b>seeding</b> <b>density</b> for provision of the ecological functions studied. ...|$|R
40|$|Studies on the {{importance}} of seed arrival for community richness and composition have not considered the number of seeds arriving and its effect on species richness and composition of natural communities is thus unknown. A series of experimental dry grassland communities were established. All communities were composed of the same 44 species in exactly the same proportions on two substrates using three different seed densities. The results showed that <b>seed</b> <b>density</b> had an effect on species richness only {{at the beginning of the}} experiment. In contrast, the effects on species composition persisted across the entire study period. The results do not support the prediction that due to higher competition for light in nutrient-rich soil, species richness will be the highest in the treatment with the lowest <b>seed</b> <b>density.</b> However, the prevalence of small plants in the lowest <b>seed</b> <b>density</b> supported the expectation that low <b>seed</b> <b>density</b> guarantees low competition under high soil nutrients. In the nutrient-poor soil, species richness was the highest at the medium <b>seed</b> <b>density,</b> indicating that species richness reflects the balance between competition and limitations caused by the availability of propagules or their ability to establish themselves. This medium <b>seed</b> <b>density</b> treatment also contained the smallest plants. The results demonstrate that future seed addition experiments need to consider the amount of seed added so that it reflects the amount of seed that is naturally found in the field. Differences in <b>seed</b> <b>density,</b> mimicking different intensity of the seed rain may also explain differences in the composition of natural communities that cannot be attributed to habita...|$|E

Cells at young and mid-passage levels were subcultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10 % fetal bovine serum at 0. 005, 0. 01, 0. 03, 0. 1, 0. 3, 1, and 2 X 10 (4) cells/cm 2. Flasks were equilibrated before and after seeding with 1 of 10 gas mixtures containing the desired oxygen tension (9 - 591 mm Hg) and placed in incubators that measure and maintain a preset oxygen tension. The partial pressure of oxygen (PO 2) in media of all flasks was determined at harvest. Cells were shielded from light of wavelength less than 500 nm. Cell growth varied inversely with oxygen tension and <b>seeding</b> <b>density.</b> At 50 cells/cm 2, growth was maximal at PO 2 9 and 16 mm Hg. Growth was progressively inhibited as the oxygen tension was increased. The population doubling increase at 14 d was 8. 6 for PO 2 9 and 16 mm Hg, 5. 8 for PO 2 42 mm Hg, 3. 8 for PO 2 78 mm Hg, 3. 8 for PO 2 104 mm Hg, and 3 for PO 2 138 mm Hg. As the <b>seeding</b> <b>density</b> was increased, the differences in growth at PO 2 less than 140 mm Hg were progressively minimized, such that at <b>seeding</b> <b>densities</b> of 10 (4) cells/cm 2 there was little difference in the rate of exponential growth or the final saturation density of cells cultivated between PO 2 9 and 96 mm Hg. At all <b>seeding</b> <b>densities</b> tested, growth was progressively inhibited when the PO 2 was increased greater than 140 mm Hg. The <b>seeding</b> <b>density</b> dependence of oxygen's influence on cellular growth is not explained by oxygen consumption of higher density cultures. Oxygen acts directly on the cells and not by destroying some essential medium component. We have found that oxygen regulates the growth of human cells under pressures of oxygen physiologic to humans, and that oxygen toxicity contributes to the <b>seeding</b> <b>density</b> dependence of cellular growth commonly seen in cell culture...|$|R

However, as they are found in very low numbers in adult tissue, expansion in vitro is required to produce desired MSC numbers for clinical application.

This review investigates how factors, age and gender of donor, as well as <b>seeding</b> <b>density</b> can affect MSC expansion. Age and gender of donor have received mixed results from studies, whereas <b>seeding</b> <b>density</b> studies have produced consistent results for numerous MSC sources, favouring lower <b>seeding</b> <b>densities.</b> Further research is required {{to reduce the risk of}} infection, loss of cell characterisation in cell culture, and making cell-based therapies more cost effective through creating rapid expansion of MSCs regardless of patient factors...|$|R
