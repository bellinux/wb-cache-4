5|$|The film {{features}} the first aquatic Skynet robot, the Hydrobot, which Laing modeled on eels, and {{was built by}} the animatronics crew with its exterior made of metal-looking rubber <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> used in the aquatic scenes.|$|E
5|$|A service ramp at {{the rear}} of the {{basement}} led to a sliding door that opened into an alley; the police found the door had been tampered with <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> opened without unlocking it. Later examination found bloody fingerprints on the door, as well as a metal pipe that had been used as a crowbar. Some evidence at the crime scene was improperly handled by the police investigators: a trail in the dirt (from the elevator shaft) along which police believed Phagan had been dragged was trampled; the footprints were never identified.|$|E
5|$|Adrienne's head {{is split}} open by a {{swinging}} pendulum blade in one death scene, an effect that took several hours to set up. A fake head was created from a model cast of actress Victoria Morsell's head, with pumps installed to pump fake blood into it, and strings attached {{to either side}} <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> pulled apart. The crew only had one head model, {{so they had to}} keep putting it back together and reusing it over and over for each take. After filming was completed, the crew put the head back together and took a picture of Morsell with it.|$|E

The Incredible Hulk and Dragon Challenge, both at Universal's Islands of Adventure, were closed in 2015 and 2017 respectively. Hulk was scrapped <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> rebuilt completely in 2016 and Dragon Challenge will be dismantled {{so it can}} be replaced by an unknown coaster in 2019. Lightning at Kuwait Entertainment City is currently closed due to its park being closed for a refurbishment. Some have been relocated and renamed.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Navy had {{conducted}} {{trials in}} 1913 with a modified cruiser, , {{to evaluate the}} ability of seaplanes {{to work with the}} fleet. They were successful enough that the Admiralty allocated £81,000 in the 1914–1915 Naval Programme to purchase a merchant ship for a more thorough modification than had been possible with Hermes to better accommodate seaplanes. A tramp steamer was purchased in 1914 that had just begun construction at the Blyth Shipbuilding Company <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> easily modified to suit its new role.|$|E
5|$|The {{street was}} named Bow Street in 1638 after its basic shape. It {{was always the}} Earl's {{intention}} to extend {{it as far as}} Long Acre, but this was delayed. It was eventually connected by his son, William Russell, 1st Duke of Bedford, who gave ownership of the street over to the Paving Commissioners of St. Martin in the Fields, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> a public right of way.|$|E

5|$|During its TGS 2014 presentation, the {{real-time}} demonstration footage {{was dubbed}} Final Fantasy XV: The Overture, which demonstrated the graphic capabilities in Luminous Studio {{and the effect}} of environmental changes on gameplay. While it was intended as a one-off presentation, the team said they were considering creating a second demo for release in Japan based on The Overture. A demo featuring the battle against the Astral Titan was featured at E3 2016: while drawing on a part of the game, the fight was tailored for the demo <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> completed within a ten-minute window, with the full version having different victory requirements. A Japan-exclusive commercial demo dubbed Judgement Disc was released on November 11. Spanning the game's events up {{to the middle of the}} first chapter, it was designed to allow players to judge the game's merits.|$|E
5|$|During {{the next}} few weeks, the Navy set up twenty-one large winches on the island to turn the Oklahoma upright <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> re-floated and patched before being scrapped. Coral was piled between the ship and the island so the ship would roll upright, instead of sliding toward the shore. Despite {{recovery}} efforts and patching, the Oklahoma sank during a mid-Pacific storm while it was being towed to the scrapyard. Nevada, California, West Virginia and the minelayer USS Oglala were re-floated and salvaged by the Navy. The entire salvage operation took 20,000 man-hours underwater and 5,000 dives to recover human remains, weapons, ammunition and artifacts of historic or military importance.|$|E
5|$|On 18 April the Mediterranean Fleet sortied to bombard {{the primary}} Axis supply port of Tripoli and was {{attacked}} {{by a pair of}} torpedo-carrying SM.79s from Rhodes. They were intercepted by a pair of Fulmars that damaged one bomber badly enough that it crash-landed back at its base, although one Fulmar was also forced to crash-land aboard Formidable. The next day Fulmars from 806 Squadron shot down one CANT Z.1007 bomber flying from Cyrenica to Sicily and a pair of Junkers Ju 52 transports flying fuel to North Africa. On the morning of 21 April, the carrier's aircraft dropped flares to illuminate the port <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> shelled by three battleships and a light cruiser. On the way home, a pair of Fulmars shot down a Dornier Do 24 flying boat.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} Lowestoft raid, Scheer began {{planning}} another {{foray into the}} North Sea. He had initially intended to launch the operation in mid-May, by which time the mine damage to Seydlitz {{was scheduled to be}} repaired—Scheer was unwilling to embark on a major raid without his battlecruiser forces at full strength. On 9 May, several battleships developed problems with their engines, which delayed the operation further, to 23 May. By 22 May, Seydlitz was still not fully repaired and the operation was again postponed, to 29 May. At noon on 29 May, the repairs to Seydlitz were finally completed, and the ship returned to the I Scouting Group. The plan called for Hipper's battlecruisers to steam north to the Skagerrak, with the intention of luring out a portion of the British fleet <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> destroyed by Scheer's waiting battleships.|$|E
5|$|The state's first governor's mansion was {{constructed}} during the gubernatorial tenure of James Garrard. According to tradition, future governors Thomas Metcalfe (a stonemason) and Robert P. Letcher (who worked at his father's brickyard) {{participated in the}} construction of the first governor's mansion. After the construction of the present governor's mansion, the old governor's mansion became the official residence of the lieutenant governor. Lieutenant governor Steve Henry vacated the mansion in 2002 <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> renovated; following the renovation, it became a state guest house and official entertainment space for the governor. For many years, the mansion was the oldest official residence still in use in the United States. Located at 420 High Street in Frankfort, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the Lowestoft raid, Admiral Reinhard Scheer began planning another foray into the North Sea. He had initially intended to launch the operation in mid-May, by which time the mine damage to Seydlitz {{was scheduled to be}} repaired—Scheer was unwilling to embark on a major raid without his battlecruiser forces at full strength. On 9 May, however, several battleships developed problems with their engines, which delayed the operation further, to 23 May. On 22 May, Seydlitz was still not fully repaired, and the operation was again postponed, this time to 29 May. At noon on 29 May, the repairs to Seydlitz were finally completed, and the ship returned to the I Scouting Group. The plan called for Hipper's battlecruisers to steam north to the Skagerrak, with the intention of luring out a portion of the British fleet <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> destroyed by Scheer's waiting battleships.|$|E

5|$|As {{the series}} {{production}} of the PS-2 gun was delayed, the Main Artillery Agency of the RKKA gave preference to a new gun. It {{was developed by the}} Artillery Design Office of the Bolshevik Factory, constructed from parts taken from the previously purchased German 37mm anti-tank gun developed by Rheinmetall and the PS-2 gun. This system was successfully tested and the Artillery Factory No. 8 named after M. Kalinin started its series production under the designator B-3 (5K). The B-3 gun had less recoil and a smaller breech compared to the PS-2, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> easily mounted in the normal machine gun turret of the T-26. The first twin-turreted T-26 was armed with a B-3 gun in the right turret in late 1931. Unfortunately, series {{production of the}} B-3 gun proceeded slowly due to poor production standards (none of 225 guns produced in 1931 were accepted by army representatives; it took until 1933 to complete the original order for 300 guns placed in August 1931). Completed B-3 guns were mounted on BT-2 light tanks after mid-1932. This meant that twin-turreted T-26 tanks continued to be equipped with old 37mm Hotchkiss (PS-1) guns. As production of the PS-1 gun had ended, some guns were taken from military supply depots and scrapped MS-1(T-18) tanks.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, the {{military}} rulers in Burma undertook renovation {{work on the}} Mahamuni Pagoda. During this period, the Mahamuni Buddha image was damaged in 1997 when a hole appeared {{in the belly of}} the Great Image. It was believed that thieves had drilled the hole in an attempt to steal jewels believed to be secreted within the image. It was reported that a military officer had requested to open the temple in the night, resulting in a meeting of all the senior monks from major monasteries in the area to discuss the matter. Whilst the meeting was in progress, attention was diverted to a purported rape incident committed by a Muslim man on a Buddhist girl. A major riot broke out but it turned out afterward that the Buddhist girl had not been raped at all. It was a coverup to divert attention away from the Buddha <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> repaired. However, the mystery remains as to whether any jewellery did exist and was actually removed from the Great Image at all.|$|E
