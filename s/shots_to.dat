5|$|Technique-wise, Sjumandjaja {{used the}} camera to emphasise the narrative. Bajangan, his first work, used long <b>shots</b> <b>to</b> show the main character's lonesomeness. He would often use several <b>shots</b> <b>to</b> show the {{psychological}} issues faced by his characters, focusing on both the characters and the space around them. He also used references to well-known cultural works; a scene in Kartini was framed so to reflect Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper.|$|E
5|$|The player {{controls}} the protagonist Leon S. Kennedy from a third-person perspective. The gameplay focuses on action and shootouts involving crowds of enemies in large open areas but still features some Horror elements. The camera is placed behind Leon and zooms {{in for an}} over-the-shoulder view when aiming a weapon, or a first-person view when aiming with a sniper rifle. There is no crosshair for firearms, instead, every firearm has a laser sight. Unlike previous games where players can only shoot straight, up or down, players have more options. For example, <b>shots</b> <b>to</b> the feet can cause enemies to stumble, <b>shots</b> <b>to</b> the arms can make them drop their weapons, and headshots instantly kill most human enemies. Players can shoot down projectiles like thrown axes or scythes.|$|E
5|$|Acting {{also plays}} a key role in Szabó’s films, as he values {{psychological}} complexity in his central characters. In his first several features, he tended to use the same lead actors over and over—first András Bálint, then Klaus Maria Brandauer. Consistent with this focus on acting, he frequently employs long close-up <b>shots</b> <b>to</b> emphasize the play of emotions on the faces of his characters.|$|E
50|$|There are {{accounts}} of four different methods {{used by the}} German troops. The victims were either beaten to death, killed with a bayonet, killed with a hammer, or <b>shot</b> <b>to</b> death. The professors themselves were <b>shot</b> <b>to</b> death.|$|R
5000|$|Pathologist Derrick Pounder {{said that}} police had [...] "simply got it wrong" [...] in their {{accounts}} of the shooting. Pounder testified that Duggan was hit first by a non-fatal <b>shot</b> <b>to</b> the arm, then killed by a second <b>shot</b> <b>to</b> his chest.|$|R
40|$|The NX 2 plasma {{focus has}} been {{operated}} in repetitive mode to investigate the effect of repetition rate on neutron emission stability of the device. For novel applications, requiring short pulses of neutrons, {{the stability of the}} <b>shot</b> <b>to</b> <b>shot</b> neutron yield may also be important. The stability of neutron emission for a range of repetitive rates from 1 / 5 to 3 Hz has been investigated. The <b>shot</b> <b>to</b> <b>shot</b> yield was estimated using a beryllium activation counter which detects neutrons with energy> 1 MeV. The <b>shot</b> <b>to</b> <b>shot</b> variation for 50 focus shots were analyzed for a given repetition rate. <b>Shot</b> <b>to</b> <b>shot</b> variation in neutron yield is high with typical standard deviation approximately equal to average yield which is similar to the one found in single shot foci. It was, however, found that there was no significant change in average yield over 50 shots without gas change. I...|$|R
5|$|Chelsea, of the Premier League, {{began their}} League Cup {{campaign}} in the third round, where they were drawn at home against Bolton Wanderers of the Championship. Defender Kurt Zouma, making his debut, opened the scoring, but Bolton equalised six minutes later through a Matt Mills header. Ten minutes {{after the start of}} the second half, Oscar put Chelsea back into the lead and they won 2–1, dominating the match with 28 <b>shots</b> <b>to</b> Bolton's 3.|$|E
5|$|In each of {{the cases}} above, the actual score is irrelevant; the {{projectiles}} simply have to hit the target sheet within the circles. Also in each case, the applicant is allowed 3 test <b>shots</b> <b>to</b> familiarize with the particular firearm used for the test. The shotgun is an exception to this, where only one round is allowed as a test shot.|$|E
5|$|On November 28, 2015, Hardy {{lost the}} WrestleCade Championship to Jeff Jarrett at WrestleCade IV in Winston-Salem, NC after taking two guitar <b>shots</b> <b>to</b> the head, which opened a six-inch gash on his head, and {{required}} 38 stitches to close. Hardy regained the Wrestlecade Championship in a triple-threat cage match against Jarrett and Ethan Carter III in Hickory, NC on May 20, 2016.|$|E

5|$|Robinson made {{a splash}} {{in his first}} season of play at Michigan. He led the Big Ten Conference in three point {{shooting}} percentage from the beginning of conference play in December until early February. In both of Michigan's wins in the 2016 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament, Robinson made three point <b>shots</b> <b>to</b> tie the score with less than a minute remaining.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} used Asylum Visual Effects {{to create}} digital effects for Friday the 13th. Although director Marcus Nispel is {{a proponent of}} practical effects, Asylum had to digitally create some <b>shots</b> <b>to</b> protect the actors and to allow the director to achieve a specific look. Visual effects supervisor Mitchell Drain assigned ten crew members {{to work on the}} visual effects; they first analyzed the script in pre-production to decide which shots would need digital effects. Asylum worked on 25 shots for the film.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{argued that}} Bamber {{had not received}} {{a telephone call from}} his father, that Nevill was too badly injured after the first <b>shots</b> <b>to</b> have spoken to anyone, that there was no blood on the kitchen phone that had been left off the hook, and that Nevill would have called the police before calling Bamber. They also argued that, had Bamber really received such a call, he would have dialled 999, alerted the farm workers, then made his way quickly there himself.|$|E

5|$|The {{scene where}} Donna and the Doctor {{investigate}} Adipose {{was difficult to}} film. The scene took thirty <b>shots</b> <b>to</b> complete, and Tennant and Tate experienced problems avoiding each other on-screen. The scene was filmed in Picture Finance's call centre {{on the outskirts of}} Newport on an early Sunday morning, with the company's telephonists serving as extras.|$|E
5|$|Aronofsky's {{first two}} films, Pi and Requiem for a Dream, were low-budget and used montages of {{extremely}} short shots, {{also known as}} hip hop montages. While an average 100-minute film has 600 to 700 cuts Requiem for a Dream features more than 2,000. Split-screen is used extensively, along with extremely tight closeups. Long tracking shots, including those shot with an apparatus strapping a camera to an actor, called the Snorricam, and time-lapse photography are also prominent stylistic devices. Often with his films, Aronofsky alternates between extreme closeups and extreme wide <b>shots</b> <b>to</b> {{create a sense of}} isolation.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{began on}} June 26, 1997, and ended on September 30 of that year, {{primarily}} {{taking place at}} Leavesden Film Studios in England. Leavesden was leased for a {{two and a half}} years so the production company could leave the sets intact and return after principal photography had been completed. The forest scenes on Naboo were filmed at Cassiobury Park in Watford, Hertfordshire. Pick-ups were shot between August 1998 and February 1999 after Lucas screened a rough cut of the film for friends and colleagues in May 1998. Most of the action and stunts were filmed by Roger Christian's second unit, which worked alongside the main unit instead of afterwards because of the high number of <b>shots</b> <b>to</b> be completed daily.|$|E

5|$|Following release, {{some players}} {{reported}} getting motion sickness due {{a combination of}} the narrow field of view used by the game and the bobbing of the player's viewpoint simulating motions during walking. Blow stated they are working on a patch to allow players to adjust their field of view, disable the head bobbing, and enable faster movement options. In August 2016, the Microsoft Windows version was updated to provide support for Nvidia's Ansel extension, which allows players to compose <b>shots</b> <b>to</b> be rendered in ultra-high resolutions or for 3D and virtual reality devices. Following Sony's announcement of the PlayStation 4 Pro, Blow affirmed they will patch the game for that console to support 4k resolutions without sacrificing framerate. Blow is also working to support devices with high dynamic range (HDR) for both PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 4 Pro versions.|$|E
5|$|Hughes faced BJ Penn on November 20, 2010, in {{a rubber}} match at , after their {{previous}} two fights at UFC 46 and UFC 63. Penn came out {{strong in the}} first few seconds of the opening round, catching one of Hughes' kicks and knocking him off balance with a counter hook. Penn then connected with an overhand right that dropped Hughes, following up with three clean <b>shots</b> <b>to</b> the jaw. The bout was ended at 21 seconds into the first round, with Hughes trilogy against Penn ending at 1-2. The fight marked the first time Hughes had been knocked out (he had previously lost via technical knockout). Post-fight Hughes hinted that the loss moved him one step closer to retirement.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970 NHL Expansion Draft, Sabres General Manager Punch Imlach drafted Tom Webster {{from the}} Boston Bruins and {{promptly}} dealt {{him to the}} Red Wings for Crozier. Crozier started the Sabres' first NHL game on October 10, 1970 against the Pittsburgh Penguins. He stopped 35 of 36 <b>shots</b> <b>to</b> earn the franchise's first victory, 2–1. On December 6, 1970, Crozier earned the franchise's first shutout in a 1–0 win over the Minnesota North Stars. By late December however, Crozier was deeply exhausted {{and the majority of}} the Sabres' goaltending duties were transferred to goalies Joe Daley and Dave Dryden. Crozier finished the season with a 9–20–7 record (win-loss-tie) and a 3.68 GAA. The Sabres also missed the playoffs, finishing fifth in the East Division. Adding to Crozier's continuing health problems, his gallbladder was removed during the off-season.|$|E

5|$|June's {{body and}} {{clothing}} were heavily bloodstained; {{she was found}} in her nightdress with bare feet. The police believe she had been sitting up during part of the attack, based on the pattern of blood on her clothing. She was found {{lying on the floor}} by the door of the master bedroom. She had been shot seven times. One shot to her forehead, between her eyes, was fired from under one foot away. That and another shot to the right side of her head would both have caused her death quickly, the court heard. There were also <b>shots</b> <b>to</b> the right side of her lower neck, her right forearm, and two injuries {{on the right side of}} her chest and right knee.|$|E
5|$|Kukunoor had not visited Rajasthan or Himachal Pradesh before, but he {{felt that}} he would find great {{locations}} there. Salooni in Chamba district is considered for shooting in Himachal Pradesh. In spite of this geographical inexperience, all went as per the plans while shooting in Rajasthan. However, minor modifications in the script were allowed for the surroundings. Though Panag had been in Rajasthan, she felt the scorching summer heat unbearable at times. She liked the only continuous shooting schedule and said that it provided consistency in look and performance. In Himachal, it was slightly different when the crew had hard time framing the mountains correctly. On seeing the captured frames, they shifted all the interior <b>shots</b> <b>to</b> outside.|$|E
5|$|Method and Luma {{both worked}} on {{creating}} the various ants {{seen in the}} film, with Method creating the several species of ants, to share among the vendors. Luma also handled many of the scenes at Pym Technologies when Ant-Man attempts to acquire the Yellowjacket. ILM worked on the Falcon fight sequence, having done Falcon visual effects in The Winter Soldier. Using practical suit pieces built by Legacy Effects, ILM mixed live-action shots with digital take-overs and fully digital <b>shots</b> <b>to</b> create the sequence. ILM also handled the sequences in the quantum realm, providing an array of microscopic and largely psychedelic imagery for the subatomic shrinking, taking advantage of procedural fractal rendering techniques the studio had utilized on Lucy.|$|E
