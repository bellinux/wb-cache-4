50|$|It is {{believed}} that the bright colors, arranged in usually roughly concentric markings, at a casual glance resemble {{the eyes of a}} predatory animal, such as a cat. An underwing moth, well camouflaged in its daytime resting spot on a tree trunk or branch, will suddenly flash open the hindwings when disturbed. A bird or other small predator that is not used to this display is likely to be frightened, allowing the moth to escape. However, unlike some other bright-colored moths which are bad-tasting or even poisonous to predators, underwing moths are well palatable at least to some birds (e.g. the blue jay, Cyanocitta cristata). To assist in avoiding nocturnal predators such as bats, these moths also possess (like many of their relatives) <b>fairly</b> <b>well-developed</b> hearing organs.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The use of {{piezoelectric}} ceramic materials for structural actuation is a <b>fairly</b> <b>well-developed</b> practice that has found {{use in a}} wide variety of applications. However, just as advanced composites offer many benefits over traditional engineering materials for structural design, actuators that utilize the active properties of piezoelectric fibers can improve upon many of the limitations encountered with monolithic piezoceramic devices used to control structural dynamics. This paper discusses the Macro Fiber Composite (MFC) actuator, which utilizes piezoceramic fibers, for example, lead zirconate titanate (PZT), embedded in an epoxy matrix for structural actuation. An overview of the MFC assembly process is presented, followed by a cure kinetics model that describes the behavior of the thermosetting epoxy matrix. This empirical model is seen to agree closely with the experimental data. KEY WORDS: macro fiber composite, manufacturing, cure kinetics, DSC...|$|R

According to the Failure Theory, infinite regress arguments can be used to demonstrate that a certain solution fails to solve an existentially or universally quantified problem (e. g. to demonstrate that a certain solution fails to settle all discussions, or that it fails to settle even one discussion).

Later, when virus-modified protein synthesis begins, larger polyribosomes {{appear in the}} cytoplasm of infected cells. Ribosomes in these new aggregates are linked by longer messenger RNA, in this case viral RNA molecules (2, 3, 6, 7, 9) and usually have a conventional arrangement (1).

One-loop calculations in AdS can be compared successfully to results derived in field theory using the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation.

A speculative idea is proposed for solving the cosmological constant problem based on non-gravitational strings that become light as the universe expands.

40|$|Is there {{anything}} special or distinctive about fiduciary relationships? Or {{is the term}} 2 ̆ 2 fiduciary 2 ̆ 2 {{nothing more than a}} label that obscures rather than clarifies? Recently, several law-and-economics scholars, building on the economic literature on agency costs, have argued that nothing categorically distinguishes fiduciary from nonfiduciary legal relationships. So-called fiduciary relationships, they argue, are nothing more or less than contractual relationships. This Essay hypothesizes that courts possess a <b>fairly</b> <b>well-developed</b> schema of the fiduciary role, but have not developed a comparable schema for ordinary contracting parties. The fiduciary role-schema often makes courts more likely to over-interpret behavior of fiduciaries than in the case of conventional contracts. This attribution of qualities to fiduciaries strongly influences how judges analyze the causes of losses to beneficiaries. In some cases, the fiduciary schema alone produces this attribution effect. In others, additional cognitive biases that behavioral decision theorists have identified and analyzed reinforce the schema. In the final Part of this Essay, I will discuss how the fiduciary schema may work together with the well-known hindsight bias to expose fiduciaries to an unusually high risk of liability...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyses}} the economical {{and commercial}} development of Holland {{in the late}} Middle Ages, focusing on the fuel market and fuel trade. Energy was of vital importance to this society in which industry, trade and export were expanding rapidly. The brisk commercial and industrial development of Holland between the 13 th and 16 th centuries coincided with demographic growth and increasing urbanisation. Fuel markets in Holland developed in the 15 th and 16 th century from local to regional and inter-regional markets. Transaction costs were low, {{partly as a result}} of a <b>fairly</b> <b>well-developed</b> justice system and partly because an excellent infrastructure minimised the transport costs of these high volume products. Fuels other than peat were preferred only because of certain technological requirements or superior properties. Fuel markets in 16 th century Holland were well integrated due to the import and export processes and a well-developed transport infrastructure. Municipal autonomy in Holland had led to inefficiencies in measuring systems, trade restrictions and tax advantages for certain groups. However by the 16 th century many such impediments were reduced or removed. Promotores: W. P. Blockmans, C. A. Davids, Co-promotor: P. J. E. M. van DamWith Summary in Englis...|$|R

This article is based upon a talk given at Tulane that was aimed at a fairly general audience, including faculty members in other areas and graduate students who had taken the usual entry level courses.

Since this was an hour talk, it was also not feasible to describe every single piece of published mathematical work that Terry Lawson has ever written; in particular, some papers like [42] and [50] would require lengthy digressions that are not easily related to the central themes in his main lines of research.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to help fill this informational gap by identifying specified characteristics of referential material used in 20 sample issues of the JII (and its predecessor, the JIIP). Major findings were that (a) over 80 percent of all references were to the insurance or finance area; (b) journal articles are easily the predominant form of material cited; (c) the Journal of Risk and Insurance is the unchallenged leader among journals cited; and (d) JII authors seem to have depended less on newer publications in recent years.

Many of the relevant articles are not insurance specific, but focus instead on some aspect of scholarly communication in the broader field of finance. The research typically has dealt with ranking journals, with measuring the “productivity ” of individual contributors, with the institutions that employ the contributors, and with the institutions from which they received their highest degree. “Productivity ” is usually defined to include output in a particular journal or group of journals.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the factors determining the distribution, length scale, magnitude {{and structure of}} mesoscale oceanic eddies in an eddy-resolving primitive equation simulation of the Southern Ocean (MESO). In particular, we investigate {{the hypothesis that the}} primary source of mesoscale eddies is baroclinic instability acting locally on the mean state. Using local mean vertical profiles of shear and stratification from the MESO simulation, we integrate the forced-dissipated quasi-geostrophic equations in a doubly periodic domain at various locations. We also perform a linear stability analysis of the profiles. The scales, energy levels and structure of the eddies found in the MESO simulation are compared to those predicted by the linear analysis, {{as well as to the}} eddying structure of the quasi-geostrophic simulations,. This allows us to quantitatively estimate the role of local non-linear effects and cascade phenomena in the generation of the eddy field. We find that typically there is a modest transfer of energy (an ‘inverse cascade’) to larger scales in the horizontal, with the length scale of the resulting eddies typically comparable to or somewhat larger than the wavelength of the most unstable mode. The eddies are, however, manifestly nonlinear and in many locations the turbulence is <b>fairly</b> <b>well-developed.</b> Coherent structures also ubiquitously emerge during the non-linear evolution of the eddy field. There is a near universal tendency toward the production of grave vertical scales, with the barotropic an...|$|R
