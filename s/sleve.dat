This is the simplest instance of a subdividable linear efficient variety enclosure, short <b>sleve.</b> We develop general criteria, that certify correctness of a global, polygonal enclosure built from a sequence of individual bounding boxes by extending and intersecting their edges.

40|$|Abstract: Smooth {{vertical}} coordinate {{levels in}} atmospheric models can considerably reduce numerical {{errors in the}} simulation of flow past complex topography. In this {{paper we propose a}} new Smooth LEvel VErtical (<b>SLEVE)</b> coordinate formulation with a modified vertical decay of topography, leading to a more uniform level thickness near the ground while preserving the fast transition to smooth levels in the upper atmosphere. Using numerical simulations of flow past complex topography, we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach. As a result, the new formulation allows for generally thinner near-surface levels of almost constant thickness and thus a better resolution of the boundary layer compared to the <b>SLEVE</b> coordinate, while retaining its advantages over classical sigma-coordinates at upper levels...|$|E

Intruductiori During the last few years extensive research has been [~~rried out to develop a thin film gas sensor using microelectronic technology. This approach has obvious advantages over conventionally fabricated sensors on ceramic substrates, e. g. small size,low costs due to automatic and batch production, low energy consumption, and the possibility of integration with electronics. However, the preparation of the most important of part of the gas sensor, its gas-sensitive layer, is not able to be fabricated. Truly thin-film gas sensors, deposited by conventional thin film methods, have generally shown poor gas selectivit...|$|R
40|$|This paper surveys a new, {{computationally}} efficient {{technique for}} linearizing curved spline geometry, bounding such geometry {{from one side}} and constructing curved spline geometry that stays {{to one side of}} a barrier or inside a given channel. Combined with a narrow error bound, these reapproximations tightly couple linear and nonlinear representations and allow them to be substituted when reasoning about the other. For example, a subdividable linear efficient variety enclosure (<b>sleve,</b> pronounced like Steve) of a composite spline surface is a pair of matched triangulations that sandwich a surface and may be used for interference checks. The average of the <b>sleve</b> components, the mid-structure, is a good max-norm linearization and, similar to a control polytope, has a welldefined, associated curved geometry representation. Finally, the ability to fit paths through given channels or keep surfaces near but outside forbidden regions, allows extending many techniques of linear computational geometry to the curved, nonlinear realm...|$|E
