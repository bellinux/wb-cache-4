In 1947, Greenshields wrote a paper that characterized “green time consumed” by “car-in-line-number” that ultimately was called headway. Average headway is one of principles used by the highway capacity manual to estimate <b>saturation</b> flow <b>rate</b> at signalized intersections. However, the current analytical techniques calculate a deterministic value for <b>saturation</b> flow <b>rate</b> that does not consider the stochastic variation of <b>saturation</b> flow <b>rate.</b> This paper reviews techniques used to estimate <b>saturation</b> flow <b>rate,</b> and proposes enhanced calculation methods to group <b>saturation</b> flow <b>rate</b> estimates by queue length. Grouping <b>saturation</b> flow <b>rate</b> estimates by queue length provides a convenient framework to evaluate <b>saturation</b> flow <b>rate</b> reliability. The inter-quartile range (25 % - 75 %) of <b>saturation</b> flow <b>rates</b> was calculated to be 1000 vph based on Greenshields’ calculation techniques. Using the proposed enhanced calculation characterizing <b>saturation</b> flow <b>rate,</b> the inter-quartile range of <b>saturation</b> flow <b>rate</b> was shown to decrease from approximately 400 vph with 5 cars in a queue to 300 vph with 10 cars in queue. Because <b>saturation</b> flow <b>rate</b> is a fundamental input to volume-to-capacity performance measures, characterizing the stochastic variation of <b>saturation</b> flow <b>rates</b> provides a basic input for assessing how reliably one can estimate important performance measures such as volume-to-capacity ratios, as well as other performance measures that build upon volume-to-capacity ratios...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSaturation {{flow rate}} {{as one of}} the {{important}} characteristics of traffic flow plays a key role to determine the capacity and delay in signalized intersections. So far, various studies have been done to evaluate the <b>saturation</b> flow <b>rate</b> at nearside legs of intersections which is fit to geometrical dimensions, traffic flow characteristics and the behaviour of the drivers. However, despite the deference between the above specifications, no study has been conducted on the <b>saturation</b> flow <b>rate</b> at far-side legs and considering the difference between the <b>saturation</b> flow <b>rate</b> at nearside and far-side legs in case of reducing the number of lanes, lane width and other effective factors, it seems to be necessary to determine the <b>saturation</b> flow <b>rate</b> at far-side legs. In the present study, using field data collection at five signalized intersections in Rasht city, the <b>saturation</b> flow <b>rate</b> is estimated and analyzed by macroscopic and microscopic methods, considering the existing lane width at nearside and far-side legs of the intersections. The results indicate that the values of <b>saturation</b> flow <b>rate</b> at far-side legs using the microscopic method are higher than the similar values in nearside legs. Also there is a primarily linear relationship (R 2 = 0. 957) between the lane width and <b>saturation</b> flow <b>rate</b> at far-side legs using the macroscopic method. There is an exponential non-linear relationship at far-side legs (R 2 = 0. 859) and a logarithmic non-linear relationship at nearside legs (R 2 = 0. 105) between the lane width and <b>saturation</b> flow <b>rate</b> using the microscopic method. In regard to far-side leg's R 2, it seems that the main criterion in determining the <b>saturation</b> flow <b>rate</b> is the lane width, while at nearside leg more effective parameters need to be used to determine the values of <b>saturation</b> flow <b>rate...</b>|$|R

Prospective observational study. Multidisciplinary intensive care unit in a university hospital. Seventy-three critically ill adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit. None.

Near-infrared spectroscopy {{was used to measure}} thenar tissue oxygen saturation, tissue oxygen <b>saturation</b> deoxygenation <b>rate,</b> and tissue oxygen <b>saturation</b> recovery <b>rate</b> after the vascular occlusion test. Measurements included heart rate, mean arterial pressure, forearm-to-fingertip skin-temperature gradient, and physical examination of peripheral perfusion with capillary refill time. Patients were stratified according to the condition of peripheral circulation (abnormal: forearm-to-fingertip skin-temperature gradient ≥ 4 and capillary refill time > 4. 5 secs). The outcome was defined based on the daily Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and blood lactate levels. Upon intensive care unit admission, 35 (47. 9 %) patients had abnormal peripheral perfusion (forearm-to-fingertip skin-temperature gradient > 4 or capillary refill time > 4. 5 secs). With the exception of the tissue oxygen <b>saturation</b> deoxygenation <b>rate,</b> tissue oxygen <b>saturation</b> baseline and tissue oxygen <b>saturation</b> recovery <b>rate</b> were statistically lower in patients who exhibited abnormal peripheral perfusion than in those with normal peripheral perfusion: 72 ± 9 vs. 81 ± 9; p =. 001 and 1. 9 ± 0. 7 vs. 3. 2 ± 0. 9; p =. 001, respectively. When a mixed-model analysis was performed over time for estimate (s) calculation, adjusted to the condition of disease, we did not find a significant clinical effect between vascular occlusion test-derived tissue oxygen saturation measurements (as response variables) and mean systemic hemodynamic variables (as independent variables) : tissue oxygen saturation vs. heart rate: s (95 % confidence interval) = 0. 007 (- 0. 08; 0. 09); tissue oxygen saturation vs. mean arterial pressure: s (95 % confidence interval) = - 0. 02 (- 0. 12; 0. 08); tissue oxygen <b>saturation</b> deoxygenation <b>rate</b> vs. heart rate: s (95 % confidence interval) = 0. 002 (- 0. 0004; 0. 006); tissue oxygen <b>saturation</b> deoxygenation <b>rate</b> vs. mean arterial pressure: s (95 % confidence interval) - 0. 0007 (- 0. 003; 0. 004); tissue oxygen <b>saturation</b> recovery <b>rate</b> vs. heart rate: s (95 % confidence interval) = - 0. 009 (- 0. 02; - 0. 0015); tissue oxygen <b>saturation</b> recovery <b>rate</b> vs. mean arterial pressure: s (95 % confidence interval) = 0. 01 (0. 002; 0. 018). However, there was a strong association between tissue oxygen saturation baseline and tissue oxygen <b>saturation</b> recovery <b>rate</b> with abnormal peripheral perfusion: tissue oxygen saturation vs. abnormal peripheral perfusion: s (95 % confidence interval) = - 10. 1 (- 13. 9; - 6. 2); tissue oxygen <b>saturation</b> recovery <b>rate</b> vs. abnormal peripheral perfusion: s (95 % confidence interval) =- 10. 1 (- 13. 9; - 6. 2); tissue oxygen <b>saturation</b> recovery <b>rate</b> vs. abnormal peripheral perfusion: s (95 % confidence interval) = - 1. 1 (- 1. 4; - 0. 81).

40|$|AbstractThis article {{describes}} {{the results of a}} comprehensive <b>saturation</b> flow <b>rate</b> analysis at signalized intersections in motorcycle dependent cities. Most of current capacity analysis methods for signalized intersections consider vehicles moving on lanes, and they assume lane discipline and high driver discipline regarding traffic regulations. Moreover, for modeling mixed traffic conditions, the not lane-based heterogeneous real traffic flow is transferred into lane-based homogeneous flow by using Passenger Car Units. So far, available methods of capacity analysis do not consider the specific conditions of driver behaviour and traffic flow which are dominant e. g. in Vietnam or other countries where motorcycles have the major share in traffic. Consequently, {{there is a need to}} develop a proper method to allow such <b>saturation</b> flow <b>rate</b> analysis. The methodology of this research was developed with consideration of the specific traffic situation in Hochiminh City, Vietnam, a motorcycle dependent city. First, the {{article describes}} the unique aspects of traffic flow and <b>saturation</b> flow <b>rate</b> analysis under such mixed traffic conditions compared with car-dominated traffic, using data collected by observations of saturated flow conditions at 12 signalized intersections. Then, <b>saturation</b> flow <b>rate</b> models using a regression method are presented and described. The term of Motorcycle Unit (MCU) is introduced, and a set of factors which mainly affect the saturation flow in such mixed conditions is developed. These factors reflect major differences between the traffic flows under saturated conditions at signalized intersections in motorcycle dependent cities and car-dominated cites. For example, this includes the influence of the approach width, the impact of four-wheel vehicles (including car, bus, and truck) on motorcycles, the very specific interactions of left-turning and opposite straight-moving traffic streams, the relationship between right-turning 4 -wheel vehicles and motorcycles moving straight in the same direction, and the phenomenon of capacity drop within the green time. Finally, a procedure to calculate the <b>saturation</b> flow <b>rate</b> for specific traffic situations is provided, and the application of the proposed model is depicted. The conducted research indicates that the proposed <b>saturation</b> flow <b>rate</b> analysis model is an appropriate approach to calculate the <b>saturation</b> flow <b>rate</b> for traffic streams at signalized intersections under such mixed traffic conditions. The set of motorcycle equivalent units used for analysis is also proved to be suitable for this model.

If we were to apply the conventional wisdom gained from conventional Shannon-Nyquist uniform sampling, then we would scale down the analog signal amplitude (and therefore increase the quantization error) to avoid the gross saturation errors that occur when the signal amplitude exceeds the quantizer’s dynamic range. In stark contrast, we demonstrate that a CS system achieves the best performance when it operates at a significantly nonzero <b>saturation</b> <b>rate.</b> We develop two methods to recover signals from saturated CS measurements. The first directly exploits the democracy property by simply discarding the saturated measurements. The second integrates saturated measurements as constraints into standard linear programming and greedy recovery techniques. Finally, we develop a simple automatic gain control system that uses the <b>saturation</b> <b>rate</b> to optimize the input gain...|$|E

In the euphotic layer, the fluvial discharge from the Amazon river favored the distribution of phosphate, TPP and DOP. In the aphotic layer, the phosphate concentration increased due to the decomposition of DOP and TPP. This increase {{is due to the}} absence of photosynthetic processes...|$|E

40|$|The dynamic lane {{assignment}} at signalized intersections is {{a possible}} countermeasure to address the traffic demand variability problem. However, the operational efficiency {{is affected by the}} unfamiliarity of the drivers. This paper evaluates the operational efficiency of the intersections with dynamic lane assignment using field data collected at five intersections in China. A total of 63488 vehicles were captured, which were divided into four groups according to the lanes they drive on: Group 1, the variable approach lane; group 2, the lane adjacent to the variable lane with the same lane-use; group 3, the lane adjacent to the variable lane with different lane-use of the variable lane; and group 4, the lanes with the same lane-use as the variable lane at other approaches of the intersection. The statistical analysis was conducted to identify the difference of <b>saturation</b> flow <b>rate</b> among the four groups. A <b>saturation</b> flow <b>rate</b> adjustment model was established accordingly. Results indicate that the using of the dynamic lane assignment decreases the <b>saturation</b> flow <b>rate</b> of the variable lane and the adjacent lane with different lane-use 22. 86 % and 9. 80 %, respectively. For the variable lane, the reduction of the <b>saturation</b> flow <b>rate</b> comes from three aspects: the unequal distribution of traffic (8. 9 %), the mandatory lane-changing (10. 7 %), and the lane blockage (4. 9 %) ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{numerical}} {{investigation into}} the thermo-hydro-mechanical behaviour of a single deposition-hole in a nuclear waste repository is presented. In particular, two simulations are presented modelling first a deposition-hole in largely unfractured rock, and a second including a discrete fracture of 2 m in radius intersecting the deposition-hole. The impact upon the hydraulic phase is discussed in detail and compared with experimental results from the Prototype Repository Project undertaken in Äspö, Sweden. It is found that the results correlate well, picking up the key differences in the <b>saturation</b> <b>rates</b> in the buffer material, especially {{in close proximity to}} the fracture represented. 1...|$|R
