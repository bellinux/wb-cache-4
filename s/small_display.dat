5|$|As of 2011, 69 Albanians {{have been}} {{recognized}} by Yad Vashem as Righteous Among the Nations for their role in helping Jews in Albania survive the Holocaust. The only public space in Albania dedicated to the Holocaust is a <b>small</b> <b>display</b> at the National Historical Museum in Tirana. Consisting of photographs, texts, maps, and wartime documents, it was opened on 29 November 2004.|$|E
5|$|Reception {{towards the}} device was {{generally}} positive, with some outlets considering {{it to be the}} best smartphone available on the market due to its upgraded hardware, Touch ID, and other changes introduced by iOS 7. Some criticized the iPhone 5S for keeping the design and <b>small</b> <b>display</b> of the iPhone 5, and others expressed security concerns about the Touch ID system. Nine million units of the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C were sold on their weekend of release, breaking Apple's sales record for iPhones. The iPhone 5S was the best selling phone on all major U.S. carriers in September 2013.|$|E

25|$|The Artists Market: A <b>small</b> <b>display</b> of {{arts and}} craft booths is set up {{concurrently}} with the Farmer's Market each Saturday from the first weekend in June through the last weekend in August. It is located in Cheapside Park adjacent to the Lexington Farmer's Market.|$|E
25|$|There is a <b>small</b> <b>display</b> of {{artefacts}} in the Majestic Hotel, {{where the}} team stayed after the match. These include a menu card signed by 14 of the players, including the eight who were killed, a photograph {{taken at the}} meal and a match ticket. The menu card was acquired by the then British ambassador to Yugoslavia and was auctioned by his son in 2006.|$|E
25|$|In the narthex a <b>small</b> <b>display</b> case {{contains}} {{items of}} significance from the church's history: the first communicants' tablet, {{and a letter}} from George Washington thanking the congregation for its hospitality to him on a 1782 visit (This is reportedly his only writing during the entire eight years of the Revolutionary War that mentions any religious institution.) Across from the main entrance three round-arched doors corresponding to those on the outside lead into the main sanctuary.|$|E

25|$|A recent area of {{research}} is {{in the field of}} bionic lenses. These are visual displays that include built-in electric circuits and light-emitting diodes and can harvest radio waves for their electric power. Bionic lenses can display information beamed from a mobile device overcoming the <b>small</b> <b>display</b> size problem. The technology involves embedding nano and microscale electronic devices in lenses. These lenses will also need to have an array of microlenses to focus the image so that it appears suspended in front of the wearer’s eyes. The lens could also serve as a head-up display for pilots or gamers.|$|E
25|$|San Francisco is {{currently}} used for user interface across all of Apple's product line, including watchOS, macOS and iOS. It {{was first introduced}} alongside the Apple Watch, where it was used for enhanced legibility and taller x-heights for easy reading on a <b>small</b> <b>display.</b> The design references {{a number of different}} other typefaces, notably FF DIN (used in the UI of the Camera app in iOS 7 and above), Helvetica (used in the UI in iOS 6 and below), Helvetica Neue (used in the UI of iOS 7 and OS X Yosemite), Roboto (Google's new UI typeface), and Univers (used on Apple's early keyboard designs).|$|E
25|$|Grosmont {{railway station}} was the railway's {{permanent}} northern terminus until 2007, when trains began operating into Whitby {{on a regular}} basis. The locomotive sheds are situated here, {{just south of the}} tunnel through which trains run en route for Goathland and beyond. The station itself has been restored to the British Railways style circa 1952. It has full facilities including a shop, café serving cooked meals, toilets including disabled, a ticket office and a waiting room. The shed area has facilities to provide water and coal for the engines, as well as stabling. The 'running shed' is usually open to public access at one end, where stationary engines can be viewed. These are usually either operational but not in service that day, or undergoing light repair work. Also open to the public is the 'deviation shed' which houses locomotives and stock owned by NELPG as well as a <b>small</b> <b>display</b> {{about the history of the}} organisation. A number of other sheds not available for public access are used for the maintenance and overhaul of the engines. At Grosmont, the line connects with the Network Rail operated Esk Valley Line, where passengers may change trains to travel to the coast at Whitby, or inland to Middlesbrough and the rest of the national network. Thus, platform one of the station is served by Northern Rail services, whilst platforms two, three and four are used by the NYMR.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{development of}} a large-format panoramic display environment. Unlike the “window-on-the-world” metaphor associated with <b>small</b> <b>displays,</b> immersive environments foster a sense of “being-in-the-world”. That raises a question: Which aspects of human-computer interaction and information perception scale up or change substantially from <b>small</b> <b>displays</b> to immersive environments? The paper first describes implementation of our display environment, projects being explored in it, and motivates a focused research agenda. Finally, the paper describes an experiment to study differences in spatial judgments by subjects while working in traditional and immersive environments...|$|R

50|$|Deepfish was an {{experimental}} browsing software system for Windows Mobile devices that used a zooming user interface, being developed at Microsoft Live Labs. It aimed {{to provide a}} consistent browsing experience on desktops and mobile devices, to display content on the <b>small</b> mobile <b>displays</b> in the same layout as larger displays, and to avoid the need to recode the web-page for <b>small</b> <b>displays.</b>|$|R
500|$|After the war, a <b>small</b> <b>display</b> to {{the memory}} of Thomas Crisp Sr. was set up in Lowestoft free library and another in Lowestoft Maritime Museum. The former {{contained}} a specially commissioned painting and parts of the sunken Nelson, which were dredged up years later. This display was destroyed during the Second World War when the building was gutted in the Blitz. A new display featuring a replica of the Victoria Cross awarded to Tom Crisp currently stands in Lowestoft town hall. The original is held secure by the local council after the family of Skipper Crisp felt his interests would not be served if the medal were held privately. It can be viewed on request of Waveney District Council's Chief Executive. Thomas Crisp's name is inscribed on the Chatham Naval Memorial for those lost at sea during the First World War, as well as two church memorials in Lowestoft to the town's war dead, St. John's and St. Margaret's. The latter church also contains a [...] "VC Bell" [...] dedicated to Thomas Crisp's memory. Tom Crisp Way, a street in his native Lowestoft, is named in his honour.|$|E

2500|$|One useful small sonar {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to a waterproof flashlight. The head is pointed into the water, a button is pressed, and the device displays {{the distance to the}} target. Another variant is a [...] "fishfinder" [...] that shows a <b>small</b> <b>display</b> with shoals of fish. Some civilian sonars (which are not designed for stealth) approach active military sonars in capability, with quite exotic three-dimensional displays of the area near the boat.|$|E

60|$|On {{the evening}} in question, the housekeeper's room was {{arranged}} with particular care, and the housekeeper herself was very smartly dressed. The preparations, however, were {{not confined to}} mere showy demonstrations, as tea was prepared for three persons, with a <b>small</b> <b>display</b> of preserves and jams and sweet cakes, which heralded some uncommon occasion. Miss Benton (my housekeeper bears that name) {{was in a state}} of great expectation, too, frequently going to the front door and looking anxiously down the lane, and more than once observing to the servant-girl that she expected company, and hoped no accident had happened to delay them.|$|E
6000|$|So Becky, who {{had arrived}} in the {{diligence}} from Florence, and was lodged at an inn in a very modest way, got a card for Prince Polonia's entertainment, and her maid dressed her with unusual care, and she went to this fine ball leaning on the arm of Major Loder, with whom she happened to be travelling at the time--(the same man who shot Prince Ravoli at Naples the next year, and was caned by Sir John Buckskin for carrying four kings in his hat besides those which he used in playing at ecarte [...] )--and this pair went into the rooms together, and Becky saw a number of old faces which she remembered in happier days, when she was not innocent, but not found out. Major Loder knew a great number of foreigners, keen-looking whiskered men with dirty striped ribbons in their buttonholes, and a very <b>small</b> <b>display</b> of linen; but his own countrymen, it might be remarked, eschewed the Major. Becky, too, knew some ladies here and there--French widows, dubious Italian countesses, whose husbands had treated them ill--faugh--what shall we say, we who have moved among some of the finest company of Vanity Fair, of this refuse and sediment of rascals? If we play, let it be with clean cards, and not with this dirty pack. But every man who has formed one of the innumerable army of travellers has seen these marauding irregulars hanging on, like Nym and Pistol, to the main force, wearing the king's colours and boasting of his commission, but pillaging for themselves, and occasionally gibbeted by the roadside.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} new Web page {{transformation}} method for browsing on mobile devices with <b>small</b> <b>displays.</b> In our approach, an original web page {{that does not}} fit into the screen {{is transformed into a}} set of pages, each of which fits into the screen. This transformation is done through slicing the original page. The resulting set of transformed pages form a multi-level tree structure, called a slicing*-tree, in which an internal node consists of a thumbnail image with hyperlinks and a leaf node is a block from the original web page. Our slicing*-tree based Web page transformation eases Web browsing on <b>small</b> <b>displays</b> by providing screen-fitting visual context and reducing page scrolling effort...|$|R
