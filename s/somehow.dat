5|$|Chrysippus is {{the first}} Stoic for whom the third of the four Stoic categories, i.e. the {{category}} <b>somehow</b> disposed is attested. In the surviving evidence, Chrysippus frequently makes use of the categories of substance and quality, but makes little use {{of the other two}} Stoic categories (<b>somehow</b> disposed and <b>somehow</b> disposed in relation to something). It is not clear whether the categories had any special significance for Chrysippus, and a clear doctrine of categories may be the work of later Stoics.|$|E
5|$|Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} suggest that H3 and H6 were <b>somehow</b> {{different from the}} other events.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{dinoflagellates}} {{are known to}} have two nuclei. Unlike other multinucleated cells these nuclei contain two distinct lineages of DNA: one from the dinoflagellate and the other from a symbiotic diatom. The mitochondria and the plastids of the diatom <b>somehow</b> remain functional.|$|E
5|$|It is {{important}} not to over-interpret these diagrams. Nothing is implied about how a particle gets from one point to another. The diagrams do not imply that the particles are moving in straight or curved lines. They do not imply that the particles are moving with constant speeds. The fact that the photon is often represented, by convention, by a wavy line and not a straight one does not imply that it is thought that it is more wavelike than is an electron. The images are just symbols to represent the actions above: photons and electrons do, <b>somehow,</b> move from point to point and electrons, <b>somehow,</b> emit and absorb photons. The theory does not explain how these things happen, but it does tell us the probabilities of these things happening in various situations.|$|E
5|$|The {{cultural}} {{process was}} <b>somehow</b> intensified in Sophiatown, as in Soho, the Greenwich Village, the Quartier Latin or Kreuzberg. It was akin to what Harlem was to New York in the 1920s Harlem Renaissance and is {{sometimes referred to}} as the Sophiatown renaissance.|$|E
5|$|This {{bird with}} its <b>somehow</b> crow-like aspect gave {{foot to the}} naming of the Quebrada de los Cuervos (Crows Ravine) in Uruguay, where they dwell {{together}} with the black vulture and the turkey vulture.|$|E
5|$|A classic {{victory was}} within his grasp {{but he could}} almost feel his adversary's breath on his neck. <b>Somehow</b> Garin held on to his lead of two metres, two little metres for a legendary victory. The stands {{exploded}} and the ovation united the two men. Garin exulted under the cheers of the crowd. Cordang cried bitter tears of disappointment.|$|E
5|$|Bart and Lisa {{begin to}} suspect that Sideshow Bob <b>somehow</b> rigged the {{election}}. Lisa goes through the voting records but is unable to find any proof that the election was rigged. Lisa receives a message from Smithers telling her to find a voter named Edgar Neubauer, who will lead them to evidence of electoral fraud.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the steep}} slope {{on which the}} {{building}} is situated, {{it had to be}} specially designed out of concrete to fit into its foundations correctly. From the front, the building appears to have only three floors. However, from the rear, all of its six floors can be seen. One part of the building's foundation was made of concrete piles, and the other as a continuous foundation. Usually, these two approaches do not mix well but Horodecki <b>somehow</b> succeeded in overcoming this technical problem.|$|E
5|$|Gabriel Logan and {{his partner}} Lian Xing {{investigate}} a series of biological outbreaks triggered by international terrorist Erich Rhoemer. When fellow agent Ellis loses contact during a mission in Costa Rica, the top-secret Agency dispatches Gabe and Lian to find him. They discover Ellis is dead, and Rhoemer's suspected drug operation is a cover for the viral operation. Another outbreak in Nepal leads to more questions when an infected person who should have died <b>somehow</b> survived.|$|E
5|$|Gordon Cole (David Lynch) calls Cooper at the sheriff's station, {{offering}} {{insight into}} Laura's autopsy. Brennan brings in his sketch, which Cooper identifies {{as the man}} from his dream. He also receives a call from Deputy Hawk (Michael Horse), who has located the one-armed man they believe is <b>somehow</b> involved; the group find him at a motel. The man, Philip Michael Gerard (Al Strobel) is a traveling salesman, who denies any involvement or that he knows BOB.|$|E
5|$|He {{was little}} known {{personally}} to the English public. His absence at sea, and on travels and duty with his regiment, {{kept him out}} of the general eye... at times, there was a sallowness of hue, which much increased the grave aspect... not only in the metropolis, but throughout the country, <b>somehow,</b> it was always said, 'He will never come to the throne.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Foliot (c. 1155– 7 August 1234) was {{a medieval}} Bishop of Hereford. Related <b>somehow</b> to his {{predecessor}} at Hereford, {{he served as}} a priest and papal judge as well as being an unsuccessful candidate as Bishop of St David's in Wales. In 1219, he was appointed Bishop of Hereford. During his time in office, he mostly attended to ecclesiastical duties, but did occasionally serve as a royal administrator. He helped found a hospital and a priory, and died in 1234 after a months-long illness.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, Brown {{traveled}} to Egypt and Syria with Arabian expert Carl Raswan {{in search of}} desertbred horses. According to Brown's wife, the two apparently did not get along well, and the five horses purchased during their journey <b>somehow</b> {{never made it to}} America. Following that trip, Brown wrote The Horse of the Desert, still considered {{to be one of the}} best works written about the Arabian horse.|$|E
5|$|In 1985 {{biochemist}} David Dolphin {{proposed a}} link between the rare blood disorder porphyria and vampire folklore. Noting that the condition is treated by intravenous haem, he suggested that the consumption of large amounts of blood may result in haem being transported <b>somehow</b> across the stomach wall and into the bloodstream. Thus vampires were merely sufferers of porphyria seeking to replace haem and alleviate their symptoms.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, the {{assumption}} of the subspecies' extinction was challenged when a hunter shot an adult female, proving the species had <b>somehow</b> survived the war. In 1989, scientists surveyed Vietnam's southern forests to search for evidence of other survivors. Fresh tracks belonging to up to 15 rhinos were found along the Dong Nai River. Largely because of the rhinoceros, the region they inhabited {{became part of the}} Cat Tien National Park in 1992.|$|E
5|$|In {{stories of}} higher caste Hindus (especially Brahmins), Nandanar is a Brahmin or God himself <b>somehow</b> {{trapped in the}} body of an {{untouchable}} and whose true form is revealed by the fire trial. Other tales focus on his strict adherence to caste norms, his obedience of his Brahmin master and his refusal to enter the holy temple as an untouchable.|$|E
5|$|Loading an {{oil tanker}} {{consists}} primarily of pumping cargo into the ship's tanks. As oil enters the tank, the vapors inside the tank must be <b>somehow</b> expelled. Depending on local regulations, the vapors can be expelled {{into the atmosphere}} or discharged back to the pumping station {{by way of a}} vapor recovery line. It is also common for the ship to move water ballast during the loading of cargo to maintain proper trim.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{realised}} that normal, globe-shaped hot {{air passenger}} balloons {{were subject to}} the whim of {{the direction of the}} winds. He then thought that perhaps a passenger balloon could be controlled <b>somehow</b> to move against the flow. His first step in an evolution to a controllable balloon was the design of a large elongated spindle instead of a sphere. His theory was that a symmetrical wave line spindle body would have less head resistance when passing through the air than did a blunt globe.|$|E
5|$|On Enterprise, Sub-Commander T'Pol {{is called}} to the command center by Captain Archer. Archer tells her that he has located a nearby planet that the Xindi {{recently}} visited. Both then travel down to the surface with Lieutenant Reed and Ensign Sato. They discover a Xindi shuttle along with two dead crewmembers, one of whom has been incinerated. With little warning, Archer, Sato and Reed suddenly begin to transform physically into a new species, but T'Pol seems <b>somehow</b> resistant to the changes.|$|E
5|$|Stylistically, many {{commentators}} have described The Oceanides as either an outright example of Impressionism or <b>somehow</b> derivative of that art movement. Others have countered that Sibelius's active {{development of the}} two subjects, his sparing use of scales favored by Impressionists, and his prioritization of action and structure over ephemeral, atmospheric background distinguish the piece from quintessential examples, such as Debussy's La mer.|$|E
5|$|The House of the Trident {{contains}} peristyle panels {{with the}} motif of a black dolphin situated around a red anchor and black tridents against a white background. The theme suggests that {{the owners of the}} house were <b>somehow</b> connected to maritime pursuits. These simple, two-dimensional mosaics stand in contrast to the multicolored, finely-detailed, three-dimensional Hellenistic mosaics of figures and motifs. They are perhaps comparable or even linked to the black-and-white pavement mosaics that appear in Roman Italy some decades later.|$|E
5|$|The actual superconducting {{material}} is often written as YBa2Cu3O7–d, where d must {{be less than}} 0.7 for superconductivity. The {{reason for this is}} still not clear, but it is known that the vacancies occur only in certain places in the crystal, the copper oxide planes, and chains, giving rise to a peculiar oxidation state of the copper atoms, which <b>somehow</b> leads to the superconducting behavior.|$|E
5|$|The endosymbiotic {{relationship}} of mitochondria with their host cells was popularized by Lynn Margulis. The endosymbiotic hypothesis suggests that mitochondria descended from bacteria that <b>somehow</b> survived endocytosis by another cell, and became {{incorporated into the}} cytoplasm. The ability of these bacteria to conduct respiration in host cells that had relied on glycolysis and fermentation would have provided a considerable evolutionary advantage. This symbiotic relationship probably developed 1.7 to 2 billion years ago.|$|E
5|$|In Alexandria, Virginia, sixteen-year-old Dara Kernof (Emily Perkins), a {{severely}} {{mentally and physically}} disabled girl confined to a wheelchair, <b>somehow</b> manages to leave her house {{in the middle of}} the night, soon after her baptism. Her father, Lance (Eric Keenleyside), finds her {{in the middle of the}} street, with her arms raised upward, kneeling before a Dark Figure. Suddenly, lightning flashes and the Dark Figure disappears. When Lance reaches Dara, he realizes she is dead and that her eyes are gone, as if having been burned out of their sockets.|$|E
5|$|The film Casablanca was a {{plot device}} in the science-fiction {{television}} movie Overdrawn at the Memory Bank (1983), based on John Varley's story. It {{was referred to}} in Terry Gilliam's dystopian Brazil (1985). Warner Bros. produced its own parody in the homage Carrotblanca, a 1995 Bugs Bunny cartoon. In Casablanca, a novella by Argentine writer Edgar Brau, the protagonist <b>somehow</b> wanders into Rick's Café Américain and listens to a strange tale related by Sam. The 2016 musical film La La Land contains multiple allusions to Casablanca in the imagery, dialogue, and plot.|$|E
25|$|The SwiSpot tool <b>somehow</b> covers {{both the}} groups, as it uses {{conformational}} predictions {{to assess the}} presence of riboswitches.|$|E
25|$|<b>Somehow,</b> all {{the wheels}} and both {{cylinders}} (assumed {{to be the}} original one not those from the 1833 rebuild) survived.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea that}} gravity causes (or <b>somehow</b> influences) the wavefunction {{collapse}} {{dates back to}} the 1960s and was originally proposed by Károlyházy.|$|E
25|$|Glowing though Charlton’s praise is, it was <b>somehow</b> {{fitting that}} Juventus {{provided}} {{the most moving}} tribute when their former talisman died in 2004.|$|E
25|$|In {{any case}} {{it would have}} been necessary, <b>somehow,</b> to cut or evade the chain boom, or else be {{detained}} under the Paraguayan artillery indefinitely.|$|E
25|$|Another {{theory is}} that Earhart and Noonan was {{captured}} by Japanese forces, perhaps after <b>somehow</b> navigating to somewhere within the Japanese South Pacific Mandate.|$|E
25|$|The Gunlords of Omega Ceti {{try to kill}} Skizz by {{travelling}} back in {{time but}} <b>somehow</b> end up in 22nd century Australia where they met Dredd.|$|E
25|$|Casson's {{idea was}} to iterate this {{construction}} {{an infinite number of}} times, {{in the hope that the}} problems about double points will <b>somehow</b> disappear in the infinite limit.|$|E
25|$|Ding-dong. Müller {{suggested}} what {{he called}} the Ding-Dong theory, which states that all things have a vibrating natural resonance, echoed <b>somehow</b> by man in his earliest words.|$|E
25|$|This {{philosophy}} of Platonist mathematical realism {{is shared by}} many mathematicians. It {{can be argued that}} Platonism <b>somehow</b> comes as a necessary assumption underlying any mathematical work.|$|E
