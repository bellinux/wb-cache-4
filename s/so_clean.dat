5|$|Irish actor Wilfrid Brambell, {{who played}} Paul McCartney's fictional {{grandfather}} John McCartney, was already well-known to British audiences as co-star of the British sitcom Steptoe and Son. The recurring joke {{that he was}} <b>so</b> <b>clean</b> reflects a play on his sitcom role, where he was always {{referred to as a}} dirty old man. In other roles, Norman Rossington played the Beatles' manager Norm, John Junkin played the group's road manager Shake, and Victor Spinetti played the television director. Brian Epstein, the group's real manager, had an uncredited bit part.|$|E

25|$|At about 10.30 Mr. Alderman Gilpin, {{chairman}} of the company, and several other directors made their appearance, {{and a few minutes}} later the car, drawn by a couple of powerful horses, went sliding along Carrington-street to the Midland and nearly to the Great Northern Railway Stations. Pleased with the sight, the people ran {{by the side of the}} car and not a few hailed the conductor to stop and take them up. Having returned to the end of Station-street, the car was run along Arkwright-street to the Trent Bridge. Considering that the metals are new and not <b>so</b> <b>clean</b> as they will be kept in a few days, the car went along very pleasantly indeed.|$|E

500|$|The band {{immediately}} started {{to search for}} a replacement vocalist and found Howard Jones of Blood Has Been Shed. Jones disliked the band's sound when he first heard it. He commented, [...] "I was like, 'Meh.' I come from hardcore and dirtier metal, and Killswitch sounded <b>so</b> <b>clean.</b> But the more I listened to it, I realized there's some really good songs here". After hearing about Leach's vocal problems, Jones contacted the band and was accepted as the replacement. Philip Labonte of All That Remains tried out for lead vocals but lost to Jones, who had to quickly memorize seven songs for his debut at the 2002 Hellfest.|$|E
500|$|While Sherwood Smith {{originally}} wrote Crown Duel as {{two separate}} books entitled Crown Duel (1997) and Court Duel (1998), she considered them as [...] "one story." [...] Both novels explore the fictional land of Sartorias-deles, {{the world she}} has been writing about since her youth. Smith grew up wondering why [...] " [...] the way [...] " [...] for instance observing, [...] "Why were the cities <b>so</b> <b>clean,</b> I wondered when I was a kid. I knew about sewers, etc. Why {{is it safe to}} drink from a stream there, and not here?". She conceived Sartorias-deles as a world where, {{over the course of several}} centuries, humans of many different races entered through [...] "worldgates" [...] and were influenced by the culture of its indigenous beings. According to Smith, while her invented world was not perfect, it contains fewer problems than Earth has endured, such as disease and overpopulation. She wrote, [...] "basically, the indigenous life forms, appalled by these things that came through and started multiplying and spreading out, carrying their diseases and wars, tried to fix things for the humans... Their history is not all happy, it's very strange, and humans still have many human problems, but in other ways they are somewhat different from [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Visual {{effects were}} done by Rocket Science VFX and Mr. X Inc. Paul Jones {{served as the}} special effects creator, who {{previously}} designed the Nemesis character in Resident Evil: Apocalypse. The production team planned to use extras to portray 300 zombies at once, but time restraints prevented that. Around 150 zombies were eventually used and Mr. X Inc's visual effects supervisor, Dennis Berardi, added more in post-production. For Alice's clones they shot motion control photography for multiple passes of Jovovich. For the wide shots they took digital photo doubles. Visual effects production manager Eric Robertson described {{the look of the}} film, [...] "interesting contrasts, pure whites, which is a staggering look. It's <b>so</b> <b>clean</b> and tight along with some real darkness too that may evoke a bit of a feel of Silent Hill. So we've got the extremes, but it's definitely a unique look for this incarnation and it's been fun to see those looks." [...] A burned cityscape with ash and smoke in the sky was created to depict a postapocalyptic Los Angeles, in which most of the film is set. Bolt described this approach as, [...] "In a world that has gone to hell in a handbasket, there's no control and no fire service, so clearly, what's going to happen to LA is it's going to get burned." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to the European Cities Monitor 2010, Stockholm is {{the best}} city in terms of freedom from pollution. Surrounded by 219 nature reserves, Stockholm has around 1,000 green spaces, which {{corresponds}} to 30% of the city's area. Founded in 1995, the Royal National City Park is the world's first legally protected [...] "national urban park". For {{a description of the}} formation process, value assets and implementation of the legal protection of The Royal National Urban Park, see [...] The water in Stockholm is <b>so</b> <b>clean</b> that people can dive and fish in the centre of the city. In fact the waters of downtown Stockholm serve as spawning grounds for multiple fish species including trout and salmon. As for carbon dioxide emissions, the government goal was to have only clean vehicles in the city by 2011.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{cutting fluids}} {{are used in}} aerosol (mist) form (air with tiny {{droplets}} of liquid scattered throughout). The main problems with mists have been that they are rather bad for the workers, who have to breathe the surrounding mist-tainted air, and that they sometimes don't even work very well. Both of those problems come from the imprecise delivery that often puts the mist everywhere {{and all the time}} except at the cutting interface, during the cut—the one place and time where it's wanted. However, a newer form of aerosol delivery, [...] (minimum quantity of lubricant), avoids both of those problems. The delivery of the aerosol is directly through the flutes of the tool (it arrives directly through or around the insert itself—an ideal type of cutting fluid delivery that traditionally has been unavailable outside of a few contexts such as gun drilling or expensive, state-of-the-art liquid delivery in production milling). MQL's aerosol is delivered in such a precisely targeted way (with respect to both location and timing) that the net effect seems almost like dry machining from the operators' perspective. The chips generally seem like dry-machined chips, requiring no draining, and the air is <b>so</b> <b>clean</b> that machining cells can be stationed closer to inspection and assembly than before. MQL doesn't provide much cooling in the sense of heat transfer, but its well-targeted lubricating action prevents some of the heat from being generated in the first place, which helps to explain its success.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the age of}} 9, Tull {{was brought}} up in the (Methodist) Children's Home and Orphanage (now known as Action for Children) in Bethnal Green, London, along with his brother, Edward, {{following}} the death of their parents. He joined Tottenham in the summer of 1909. His first senior games were in Argentina and Uruguay on the club's close season tour to South America. He made his home Football League debut against FA Cup holders, Manchester United, in front of over 30,000. His excellent form in this opening part of the season promised a great future. However, at a match away to Bristol City in October 1909 Tull was the target of vicious racist abuse. So incensed was the 'Football Star' reporter, DD, that his match report was headlined 'Football and the Colour Prejudice'. This is possibly the first time racial abuse was headlined in a football report. DD was keen to emphasis how Tull remained professional and composed despite the intense provocation. 'He is Hotspur's most brainy forward ... <b>so</b> <b>clean</b> in mind and method as to be a model for all white men who play football ... Tull was the best forward on the field'. However, soon after he was soon dropped from the first team and found it difficult to get a sustained run back in the side in which he started so well. He played most of his subsequent games for the reserves and was eventually transferred to Herbert Chapman's Northampton Town in 1911, where he made 111first-team appearances. Interestingly, Chapman – also a Methodist – was a former Spurs player and had played as a young man with Arthur Wharton at Stalybridge Rovers. He went on to manage both Huddersfield Town and Arsenal to FA Cup wins and League championships and is recognised {{as one of the great}} managers in the history of the Football League.|$|E

50|$|In Layers (2011), she {{presents}} her self-portrait in two large-scale simultaneous projections which move in coordinated timing. In {{the first}} projection she applies clay {{to her face}} and covers {{the surface of the}} face while in the second projection she wipes her face with her hand and, in doing <b>so,</b> <b>cleans</b> its surface to reveal her face underneath. In this symmetrical composition, which can be aggressively confrontational, she employs clay as a metaphorical tool for articulating transformation of internal and external selves. By exploring the notion of masking identity, Haleh focuses on alienation and transformation of one's self. Masking alludes to one of the iconic characteristics of identity perceived in a different cultural context as means of transforming, disguising or displaying identity.|$|R
