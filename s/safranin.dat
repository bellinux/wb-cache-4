5|$|E. coli stains Gram-negative {{because its}} cell wall is {{composed}} of a thin peptidoglycan layer and an outer membrane. During the staining process, E. coli picks up {{the color of the}} counterstain <b>safranin</b> and stains pink. The outer membrane surrounding the cell wall provides a barrier to certain antibiotics such that E. coli is not damaged by penicillin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Safranin</b> {{typically}} has {{the chemical}} structure shown at right (sometimes described as dimethyl <b>safranin).</b> There is also trimethyl <b>safranin,</b> {{which has an}} added methyl group in the ortho- position of the lower ring. Both compounds behave essentially identically in biological staining applications, and most manufacturers of <b>safranin</b> do not distinguish between the two. Commercial <b>safranin</b> preparations often contain a blend of both types.|$|E
50|$|Counterstaining with <b>safranin.</b> Carbol fuchsin is {{sometimes}} substituted for <b>safranin</b> since it more intensely stains anaerobic bacteria, {{but it is}} less commonly used as a counterstain.|$|E
50|$|<b>Safranin</b> (also <b>Safranin</b> O or basic red 2) is a {{biological}} stain used in histology and cytology. <b>Safranin</b> {{is used as}} a counterstain in some staining protocols, colouring all cell nuclei red. This is the classic counterstain in both Gram stains, and endospore staining. It can also be used for the detection of cartilage, mucin and mast cell granules.|$|E
50|$|<b>Safranin</b> is {{also used}} as redox {{indicator}} in analytical chemistry.|$|E

5000|$|For example, {{crystal violet}} stains only Gram-positive {{bacteria}} in Gram staining. A <b>safranin</b> counterstain is applied that stains all cells, allowing identification of Gram-negative bacteria.|$|E
5000|$|Use of sample-staining {{methods for}} use in microbiology, such as simple stains (methylene blue, <b>safranin,</b> crystal violet) and {{differential}} stains (negative stains, flagellar stains, endospore stains).|$|E
50|$|Also in Gram staining, {{crystal violet}} stains only Gram-positive bacteria, and <b>safranin</b> counterstain is applied which stains all cells, {{allowing}} {{the identification of}} Gram-negative bacteria as well. An alternative method uses dilute carbofluozide.|$|E
50|$|The Chlamydiaceae and Mycoplasmataceae lack a {{peptidoglycan}} layer so do not retain {{crystal violet}} or <b>safranin,</b> resulting in no color. Ricketsiaceae are technically Gram-negative, but {{are too small}} to stain well, so are often considered atypical.|$|E
50|$|Malachite green (also {{known as}} diamond green B or {{victoria}} green B) {{can be used}} as a blue-green counterstain to <b>safranin</b> in the Gimenez staining technique for bacteria. It can also be used to directly stain spores.|$|E
50|$|After decolorization, the gram-positive cell remains {{purple and}} the gram-negative cell loses its purple color. Counterstain, {{which is usually}} {{positively}} charged <b>safranin</b> or basic fuchsine, is applied last to give decolorized gram-negative bacteria a pink or red color.|$|E
50|$|The Schaeffer-Fulton stain is a {{technique}} designed to isolate endospores by staining any present endospores green, and any other bacterial bodies red. The primary stain is malachite green, and the counterstain is <b>safranin,</b> which dyes any other bacterial bodies red.|$|E
50|$|One {{commonly}} recognizable use {{of differential}} staining is the Gram stain. Gram staining uses two dyes: Crystal violet and Fuchsin or <b>Safranin</b> (the counterstain) {{to differentiate between}} Gram-positive bacteria (large Peptidoglycan layer on outer surface of cell) and Gram-negative bacteria.|$|E
50|$|Gram-positive {{bacteria}} have a thick peptidoglycan {{layer in}} their cell wall, which retains the crystal violet during Gram staining, {{resulting in a}} purple color. Gram-negative bacteria have a thin peptidoglycan layer which does not retain the crystal violet, so when <b>safranin</b> is added during the process, they stain red.|$|E
50|$|E. coli stains Gram-negative {{because its}} cell wall is {{composed}} of a thin peptidoglycan layer and an outer membrane. During the staining process, E. coli picks up {{the color of the}} counterstain <b>safranin</b> and stains pink. The outer membrane surrounding the cell wall provides a barrier to certain antibiotics such that E. coli is not damaged by penicillin.|$|E
5000|$|Gram-positive {{bacteria}} have a thick mesh-like {{cell wall}} made of peptidoglycan (50-90% of cell envelope), {{and as a}} result are stained purple by crystal violet, whereas gram-negative bacteria have a thinner layer (10% of cell envelope), so do not retain the purple stain and are counter-stained pink by <b>safranin.</b> There are four basic steps of the Gram stain: ...|$|E
50|$|Gram {{staining}} is used {{to determine}} gram status to classify bacteria broadly. It {{is based on the}} composition of their cell wall. Gram staining uses crystal violet to stain cell walls, iodine as a mordant, and a fuchsin or <b>safranin</b> counterstain to mark all bacteria. Gram status is important in medicine; {{the presence or absence of}} a cell wall changes the bacterium's susceptibility to some antibiotics.|$|E
50|$|Gram-negative {{bacteria}} cannot {{retain the}} violet stain after the decolorization step; alcohol {{used in this}} stage degrades the outer membrane of gram-negative cells making the cell wall more porous and incapable of retaining the crystal violet stain. Their peptidoglycan layer is much thinner and sandwiched between an inner cell membrane and a bacterial outer membrane, causing them {{to take up the}} counterstain (<b>safranin</b> or fuchsine) and appear red or pink.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} other {{staining}} techniques {{that have been used}} to selectively stain cells and cellular components. One of these techniques involves marking peripheral tumors or surgical margins, in which a certain color of dye is applied to the posterior border of a sample, another to the anterior, etc., so that one can identify the location of a tumor or other pathology within a specimen. Other compounds used to color tissue sections include <b>safranin,</b> Oil Red O, Congo red, Fast green FCF, silver salts, and numerous natural and artificial dyes that usually originated from the development of dyes for the textile industry.|$|E
50|$|The most {{commonly}} used stain in histopathology {{is a combination of}} hematoxylin and eosin (often abbreviated H&E). Hematoxylin is used to stain nuclei blue, while eosin stains cytoplasm and the extracellular connective tissue matrix pink. There are hundreds of various other techniques which have been used to selectively stain cells. Other compounds used to color tissue sections include <b>safranin,</b> Oil Red O, congo red, silver salts and artificial dyes. Histochemistry refers to the science of using chemical reactions between laboratory chemicals and components within tissue. A commonly performed histochemical technique is the Perls' Prussian blue reaction, used to demonstrate iron deposits in diseases like Hemochromatosis.|$|E
50|$|Using an aseptic technique, {{bacteria}} {{are placed on}} a slide and heat fixed. The slide is then suspended over a water bath {{with some sort of}} porus paper over it, so that the slide is steamed. Malachite green is applied to the slide, which can penetrate the tough walls of the endospores, staining them green. After five minutes, the slide is removed from the steam, and the paper towel is removed. After cooling, the slide is rinsed with water for thirty seconds. The slide is then stained with diluted <b>safranin</b> for two minutes, which stains most other microorganic bodies red or pink. The slide is then rinsed again, and blotted dry with bibulous paper.|$|E
50|$|Gram {{staining}} differentiates bacteria by {{the chemical}} and physical properties of their cell walls by detecting peptidoglycan, which {{is present in the}} cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria. Gram-negative cells also contain peptidoglycan, but a very small layer of it that is dissolved when the alcohol is added. This is why the cell loses its initial colour from the primary stain. Gram-positive bacteria retain the crystal violet dye, and thus are stained violet, while the Gram-negative bacteria do not; after washing, a counterstain is added (commonly <b>safranin</b> or fuchsine) that will stain these Gram-negative bacteria a pink color. Both Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria pick up the counterstain. The counterstain, however, is unseen on Gram-positive bacteria because of the darker crystal violet stain.|$|E
5000|$|The {{work that}} gained Gram an {{international}} reputation was his {{development of a}} method of staining bacteria, {{to make them more}} visible under a microscope. The stain later {{played a major role in}} classifying bacteria. Gram was a modest man, and in his initial publication he remarked, [...] "I have therefore published the method, although I am aware that as yet it is very defective and imperfect; but it is hoped that also in the hands of other investigators it will turn out to be useful." [...] A Gram stain is made using a primary stain of crystal violet and a counterstain of <b>safranin.</b> Bacteria that turn purple when stained are called 'Gram-positive', while those that turn red when counterstained are called 'Gram-negative'.|$|E
5000|$|Numerous niche {{applications}} {{exploit the}} intense color of MG. It {{is used as}} a biological stain for microscopic analysis of cell biology and tissue samples. In the Gimenez staining method, basic fuchsin stains bacteria red or magenta, and malachite green {{is used as a}} blue-green counterstain. Malachite green is also used in endospore staining, since it can directly stain endospores within bacterial cells; here a <b>safranin</b> counterstain is often used. Malachite green can also be used as a saturable absorber in dye lasers, or as a pH indicator between pH 0.2-1.8. However, this use is relatively rare. Leuco-malachite green (LMG) is used as a detection method for latent blood in forensic science. Hemoglobin catalyzes the reaction between LMG and hydrogen peroxide, converting the colorless LMG into malachite green. Therefore, the appearance of a green color indicates the presence of blood.|$|E
5000|$|Safranines are the azonium {{compounds}} of symmetrical 2,8-dimethyl-3,7-diamino-phenazine. They {{are obtained}} by the joint oxidation of one molecule of a para-diamine with two molecules of a primary amine; by the condensation of para-aminoazo compounds with primary amines, and {{by the action of}} para-nitrosodialkylanilines with secondary bases such as diphenylmetaphenylenediamine. They are crystalline solids showing a characteristic green metallic lustre; they are readily soluble in water and dye blue or violet. They are strong bases and form stable monacid salts. Their alcoholic solution shows a yellow-red fluorescence. Phenosafranine is not very stable in the free state; its chloride forms green plates. It can be readily diazotized, and the diazonium salt when boiled with alcohol yields aposafranine or benzene induline, C18H12N3. F. Kehrmann showed that aposafranine could be diazotized in the presence of cold concentrated sulfuric acid, and the diazonium salt on boiling with alcohol yielded phenylphenazonium salts. Aposafranone, C18H12N2O, is formed by heating aposafranine with concentrated hydrochloric acid. These three compounds are perhaps to be represented as ortho- or as para-quinones. The [...] "safranine" [...] of commerce is an ortho-tolusafranine. The first aniline dye-stuff to be prepared on a manufacturing scale was mauveine, which was obtained by Sir William Henry Perkin by heating crude aniline with potassium bichromate and sulfuric acid. Mauveine was converted to parasafranine (1,8-dimethyl Safranine) by Perkin in 1878 by oxidative/reductive loss of the 7-N-para-tolyl group.Another well known <b>safranin</b> is phenosafranine (C.I. 50200, 3,7-diamino-5-phenylphenazinium chloride)widely used as histological dye, photosensitizer and redox probe.|$|E
40|$|The textile {{industries}} generates {{extremely high}} amount of colour waste water, which are mainly poisons. A traditional biological treatment {{process is not}} helpful in treating the dye effluent because of low biodegradability of dyes. The presence of <b>safranin</b> (O) dye causes distinct acute impact on health therefore the removal of this dye from aqueous solution is highly desirable. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the efficiency of photo-degradation of safanin (O) dye with application of nanoparticles of TiO 2 as a photocatalyst. For this purpose nanoparticles of TiO 2 were synthesized by a very simple sol-gel method with absence of additives and hydrolysing agents. The synthesized nanoparticles of TiO 2 were characterized by FTIR, XRD, SEM, BET and UV-vis spectroscopy. It was found that change in polymorphic phase occurs as temperature changes from 600 to 800 0 C and also the crystallinity of TiO 2 increases with annealing temperature. The application of prepared TiO 2 nanoparticles for photocatalytic degradation of <b>safranin</b> (O) dye from aqueous solution was explored. It was determined that anatase phase TiO 2 shown highest photo-degradability of <b>safranin</b> (O) dye. The blank tests investigated for light irradiated to <b>safranin</b> (O) dye solution without TiO 2 catalyst and for the suspension carrying TiO 2 and <b>safranin</b> (O) dye in the dark that revealed both the photocatalyst and light energy were required for the photo-degradation of <b>safranin</b> (O) dye. The effect of several factors such as catalyst dose, initial concentration, pH of solution and temperature, was studied on the photocatalytic degradation of <b>safranin</b> (O) dye and optimized it. Results indicated that photo-degradation of <b>safranin</b> (O) dye increases at higher alkaline pH. The photo-degradation rate was strongly influenced by activation of TiO 2 photocatalyst with photon and production of hydroxyl radicals’ hence suggested optimum catalyst dose and initial concentration of dye for photo-degradation process. ...|$|E
40|$|Cross-sections of leaf {{blades and}} {{petioles}} of different strawberry genotypes exhibiting {{different levels of}} resistance to Chaetosiphon fragaefolii were studied using the paraffin method, and staining with <b>safranin,</b> crystal violet and light green. Besides thicker cell walls of the cortex collenchyma in the more resistant genotypes, and a proportionally wider collenchyma than parenchyma in the cortex, their midribs are also encircled by a ring of more intensely stained lignified cells forming a physical ring. This stain reaction of cells to <b>safranin</b> and crystal violet occurs also in lateral vascular bundles, {{as well as in}} leaf palisade tissue. The tissue cross-sections of the sensitive genotypes revealed a predominance of green on the cellulose cell walls and protoplasts due to the reaction to light green SF, while stain reactions to <b>safranin</b> and crystal violet were not evidenced...|$|E
40|$|The {{sequence}} selectivity of the DNA binding of the phenazinium dyes phenosafranin and <b>safranin</b> O {{have been}} investigated with four sequence-specific deoxyribopolynucleotides from spectroscopic and calorimetric studies. The alternating guanine-cytosine sequence selectivity of the dyes has been revealed from binding affinity values, circular dichroism, thermal melting, competition dialysis, and calorimetric results. The binding affinities of both the dyes to the polynucleotides were {{of the order of}} 105 M- 1, but the values were higher for the guanine-cytosine polynucleotides over adenine-thymine ones. Phenosafranin had a higher binding affinity compared to <b>safranin</b> O. Isothermal titration calorimetric studies revealed that the binding reactions were exothermic and favored by negative enthalpy and predominantly large positive entropy contributions in all cases except poly(dA) · poly(dT) where the profile was anomalous. Although charged, nonpolyelectrolytic contribution was revealed to be dominant to the free energy of binding. The negative heat capacity values obtained from the temperature dependence of enthalpy changes, which were higher for phenosafranin compared to <b>safranin</b> O, suggested significant hydrophobic contribution to the binding process. In aggregate, the data presents evidence for the alternating guanine-cytosine base pair selectivity of these phenazinium dyes and a stronger binding of phenosafranin over <b>safranin</b> O...|$|E
40|$|The {{usefulness}} of thionin for staining cartilage sections embedded in glycol methacrylate (GMA) {{and the effect}} of decalcification on cartilage sections embedded in paraffin and GMA were assessed. Short decalcification periods using 5 % formic acid or 10 % EDTA did not influence the staining properties or the morphology of cartilage matrix and chondrocytes. The standard stain <b>safranin</b> O-fast green for differential staining of cartilage was used as control in these experiments. Prolonged exposure of <b>safranin</b> O stained sections to fast green resulted in disappearance of the <b>safranin</b> O stained matrix, thereby hampering the quantitative measurement of negatively charged glycosaminoglycans (GAG). Thionin stained evenly throughout all cartilage layers, independent of the staining times. In contrast to <b>safranin</b> O, thionin did not show metachromasia in nondehydrated cartilage sections, which made it more suitable for assessing cartilage quality in GMA embedded cartilage. To evaluate the selectivity of thionin staining in cartilage, chondroitinase ABC and trypsin digestions were carried out. Thionin staining was prevented by these enzymes in the territorial matrix, representing the interlacunar network and the chondrocyte capsule. Staining with thionin of the interterritorial matrix was only slightly reduced, possibly representing keratan sulfate and hyaluronic acid in cartilage of elderly patients. Comparison of thionin stained GMA embedded cartilage with <b>safranin</b> O stained paraffin embedded sections showed significant similarity in optical densitometry, indicative of the specificity of thionin bound to negatively charged GAG in cartilage. In GMA embedded cartilage morphology was relatively intact compared to paraffin embedded sections due to less shrinkage of chondrocytes and the interlacunar network...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To define {{histological}} {{scores for}} intervertebral disc degeneration {{that would enable}} the definition of morphological characteristics of disease, besides improving knowledge of the lumbar degenerative disc disease by means of immunohistochemical markers. Methods: Hematoxylin and Eosin, Alcian/PAS, Masson Trichrome and <b>Safranin</b> O/FCF staining was used on the intervertebral disc degeneration sections of patients with lumbar degenerative disc disease. The protein markers defined in immunohistochemistry were cell proliferation (Ki- 67) and apoptosis (p 53). Results: The study data enabled the determination of <b>Safranin</b> O/FCF stain as the most effective one for evaluating parameters such as area, diameter, and number of chondrocyte clusters. The importance of using stains in association, such as <b>Safranin</b> O/FCF, Masson Trichrome, Alcian/PAS and Hematoxylin and Eosin, was also determined, as they are complementary for the histopathological verification of intervertebral disc degeneration.
