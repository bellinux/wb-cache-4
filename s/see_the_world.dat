5|$|Born in Conegliano, Veneto, Del Piero {{is the son}} of Gino, an electrician, and Bruna, a housekeeper. He {{regularly}} {{played football}} in the backyard with two friends, Nelso and Pierpaolo, as a child. All three dreamed of becoming footballers, but only Alessandro would eventually manage to do so. Alessandro's older brother, Stefano, briefly played professional football for Sampdoria before an injury curtailed his career; he later worked as Alessandro's agent. The family lived in the hamlet of Saccon, a rural home in San Vendemiano. While growing up, Del Piero's family did not have much money for travelling abroad, so he considered being a lorry driver in order to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 1881 {{world tour}} of King Kalākaua of the Kingdom of Hawaii was {{his attempt to}} save the Hawaiian culture and {{population}} from extinction through the importation of a labor force from Asia-Pacific nations. His efforts brought the small island nation {{to the attention of}} world leaders, but sparked rumors that the kingdom was for sale. In Hawaii there were critics who believed the labor negotiations were just his excuse to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> The 281-day trip gave him the distinction of being the first monarch to circumnavigate the globe, just as his 1874 travels had made him the first reigning monarch to visit America and the first honoree of a state dinner at the White House.|$|E
5|$|Neuroscientist and {{psychologist}} Pascal Wallisch {{states that}} while inherently ambiguous stimuli {{have been known}} to vision science for many years, this is the first such stimulus in the colour domain that was {{brought to the attention of}} science by social media. He attributes differential perceptions to differences in illumination and fabric priors, but also notes that the stimulus is highly unusual insofar as the perception of most people does not switch. If it does, it does so only on very long time scales, which is highly unusual for bistable stimuli, so perceptual learning might be at play. In addition, he says that discussions of this stimulus are not frivolous, as the stimulus is both of interest to science and a paradigmatic case of how different people can sincerely <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> differently, an acknowledgement of which is a precondition for world peace. Daniel Hardiman-McCartney of the College of Optometrists stated that the picture was ambiguous, suggesting that the illusion was caused by a strong yellow light shining onto the dress, and human perception of the colours of the dress and light source by comparing them with other colours and objects in the picture. The philosopher Barry C. Smith compared the phenomenon with Ludwig Wittgenstein and the rabbit–duck illusion.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the {{building}} of the transcontinental railway, Portland’s {{contact with the outside world}} – California or the eastern US – was largely by sea. These journeys took a long time: they were made for business; to replenish stocks; visits to family; education in the East; or to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Even the inland routes were largely along rivers.|$|E
25|$|We {{knew that}} we had created a new means of warfare, and the {{question}} as to what nation, to what victorious nation we were willing to entrust this brainchild of ours was a moral decision more than anything else.

25|$|This {{emphasis}} {{on the relationship between}} anthropologists and those they study—the point that, while astronomers and stars; chemists and elements; botanists and plants are fundamentally different, anthropologists and those they study are equally human—implied that anthropologists themselves could be objects of anthropological study. Although Boas did not pursue this reversal systematically, his article on alternating sounds illustrates his awareness that scientists should not be confident about their objectivity, because they too <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> through the prism of their culture.|$|E
25|$|Alcohol can {{alleviate}} the drinker’s feelings of stress or anxiety. Alcohol myopia limits those {{under the influence}} of alcohol to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> through a nearsighted lens; in other words, consumption of alcohol will lead individuals to temporarily forget about previous worries or problems, for these feelings lay outside of the restricted set of immediate cues that the drinker can respond to. By depriving him of the attention capacity necessary to process undesirable thoughts, alcohol myopia can bring the drinker a sense of relief.|$|E
25|$|Apart from Barry, another {{formerly}} stereoblind adult whose acquired {{ability for}} stereopsis has received media attention is neuroscientist Bruce Bridgeman, {{professor of psychology}} and psychobiology at University of California Santa Cruz, {{who had grown up}} nearly stereoblind and acquired stereo vision spontaneously in 2012 at the age of 67, when watching the 3D movie Hugo with polarizing 3D glasses. The scene suddenly appeared to him in depth, and the ability to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> in stereo stayed with him also after leaving the cinema.|$|E

25|$|On 5 August 1914 Edmund Blampied married Marianne van Abbe (b Amsterdam 27 August 1887, d Jersey 11 May 1986) who was {{the sister}} of Dutch-born artists Joseph and Salomon van Abbe. They had no children. Marianne had acted as his agent for several years before they married, and {{continued}} to do so until Edmund's brother John began working as an artist's agent in the 1920s. She was a great support to Blampied in his work and prompted him to travel and <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1887 {{he visited}} Austria, Italy and Germany, and {{retired from the}} board of the Itinerants' Society. He painted two portraits of Leo Tolstoy at Yasnaya Polyana that year and made {{preparations}} for his painting Leo Tolstoy Ploughing, and painted Alexander Pushkin on the Shore of the Black Sea (in collaboration with Ivan Aivazovsky). In 1888 he traveled to Southern Russia and the Caucasus, where he did sketches and studies of descendants of the Zaporozhian Cossacks. In 1889 he traveled to Paris to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Exhibition and then visited London, Zurich, and Munich with Stasov.|$|E
25|$|Munro's {{interest}} in speed began {{at an early}} age, riding the family's fastest horse across the farm, despite the complaints of his father. Trips via train to the port at Invercargill were a rare source of excitement, {{and the arrival of}} cars, motorcycles and aircraft added to Burt's eagerness to join the world outside his farm. As Munro's family discouraged his endeavours outside farm life, he became constantly bored with daily routine. At the outbreak of the First World War, he intended to go to war {{as soon as he was}} old enough, for a chance to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E

25|$|Loneliness {{has been}} linked with depression, and is thus {{a risk factor for}} suicide. Émile Durkheim has {{described}} loneliness, specifically the inability or unwillingness to live for others, i.e. for friendships or altruistic ideas, as the main reason for what he called egoistic suicide. In adults, loneliness is a major precipitant of depression and alcoholism. People who are socially isolated may report poor sleep quality, and thus have diminished restorative processes. Loneliness has also been linked with a Schizoid character type in which one may <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> differently and experience social alienation, described as the self in exile.|$|E
25|$|Another famous {{philosophy}} is that formulated by Nachman of Breslov and adhered to by Breslov Hasidim. In contrast {{to most of}} his peers who believed God must be worshiped through joy, Nachman portrayed the corporeal world in grim colors, as a place devoid of God's immediate presence from which the soul yearns to liberate itself. He mocked the attempts to perceive the nature of infinite-finite dialectics {{and the manner in}} which God still occupies the Vacant Void albeit not, stating these were paradoxical, beyond human understanding. Only naive faith in their reality would do. Mortals were in constant struggle to overcome their profane instincts, and had to free themselves from their limited intellects to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> as it truly is.|$|E
25|$|In epistemology, for example, the {{criticism}} of what Fodor calls the interpretationalist hypothesis accounts for the common-sense intuition (on which naïve physics is based) of the independence of reality from the conceptual categories of the experimenter. If the processes of elaboration of the mental modules are in fact independent of the background theories, then {{it is possible to}} maintain the realist view that two scientists who embrace two radically diverse theories <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> exactly in the same manner even if they interpret it differently. The point is {{that it is necessary to}} distinguish between observations and the perceptual fixation of beliefs. While it is beyond doubt that the second process involves the holistic relationship between beliefs, the first is largely independent of the background beliefs of individuals.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, another sibling of Richard's, Oba Rahl, suffers {{under an}} abusive {{mother on the}} family farm. Oba imagines himself as {{energetic}} and the possessor of a healthy curiosity. His inquisitive nature manifests itself especially through pleasure in watching things die under his hand. Oba does not know that he, along with Jennsen, is pristinely ungifted and immune to magic. His mother sends him to a nearby sorceress to buy medicine, and, during the purchase, he begins to menace the magic user. Her attempts to defend herself with magic fail and Oba kills her brutally. During the fight, Oba surrenders to a voice in his mind that promises invincibility in return for obedience. After returning home, Oba kills his mother and resolves to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> He can travel comfortably with the funds he looted from the sorceress.|$|E
25|$|Scholars {{argue that}} hip hop {{can have an}} {{empowering}} effect on youth. While there is misogyny, violence, and drug use in rap music videos and lyrics, hip hop also displays many positive themes of self-reliance, resilience, and self-esteem. These messages can be inspiring for a youth living in poverty. A lot of rap songs contain references to strengthening the African American community promoting social causes. Social workers have used hip hop to build a relationship with at-risk youth and develop a deeper connection with the child. Hip hop {{has the potential to}} be taught as a way of helping people <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> more critically, be it through forms of writing, creating music, or social activism. The lyrics of hip hop have been used to learn about literary devices such as metaphor, imagery, irony, tone, theme, motif, plot, and point of view.|$|E
25|$|Another key {{concept in}} social {{cognition}} {{is the assumption}} that reality is too complex to easily discern. As a result, we tend to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> according to simplified schemas or images of reality. Schemas are generalized mental representations that organize knowledge and guide information processing. Schemas often operate automatically and unintentionally, and can lead to biases in perception and memory. Expectations from schemas may lead us to see something that is not there. One experiment found that {{people are more likely to}} misperceive a weapon in the hands of a black man than a white man. This type of schema is actually a stereotype, a generalized set of beliefs about a particular group of people (when incorrect, an ultimate attribution error). Stereotypes are often related to negative or preferential attitudes (prejudice) and behavior (discrimination). Schemas for behaviors (e.g., going to a restaurant, doing laundry) are known as scripts.|$|E
