40|$|In {{this paper}} two digital filters {{are applied to}} {{elaborate}} acceleration data acquired from two accelerometers fixed in a lift frame during <b>safety</b> <b>gears</b> tests. The experimental tests consist in free falls of a test lift car and the subsequent gripping phases initiated by the <b>safety</b> <b>gears</b> activation due to over-speed condition. Unfortunately, the reliability of acceleration data is heavily impaired by measurement noise, which needs to be suppressed to the largest extent possible {{in order to use}} the data for comfort evaluation. To this end, two classes of digital filters are tested: the Savitzky–Golay and the Butterworth filters. This choice is motivated by the key features of these filters, including their computational simplicity and high suitability to represent time varying features in acceleration measurements. A tuning procedure is proposed for these filters, such that the measurement noise corrupting the experimental data is maximally dumped...|$|R

The boats are usually {{relatively}} small so they can easily be transported on roads and launched at a convenient site depending on the weather. Boats of this size can be launched from slipways or through the surf on suitable beaches. The smaller models are suitable for amateur divers, as they can only transport a few divers. The larger boats can carry enough divers to be viable for professional use. These boats will generally carry basic safety equipment such as marine VHF radio, small boat <b>safety</b> <b>gear,</b> lifejackets and first aid oxygen administration equipment.|$|E

40|$|Construction practitioners’ world – wide are {{increasingly}} becoming {{aware that they}} cannot concentrate primarily on {{the technical aspects of}} the industry alone and ignoring the workers and others who may be adversely affected by construction activities. In most developing countries, including Tanzania, safety consideration in the construction project delivery is not given a high priority. The current approach is that safety interventions occur in response to specific, often major accidents or injury. The main objective of this research is to scrutinize why road and building construction industries in Tanzania have paid little attention to the issues of health and safety in construction sites. Data was obtained from different literatures and fields. Secondary data collected from different sources including publication on health and safety, academic journals, books, official documents and reports from Government Ministries, Agencies, NGO’s and development partners. Conclusively people pay little attention to the things concerning health and safety issues in construction building sites. The absence of clear national health and safety policy to safeguard all issues regarding the welfare of the construction workers in the country is a challenge. The fact is construction industry is still suffering on how health and safety would be safely practiced in construction sites. So, we need to make a clear policy concerning health and safety in general with regards to the construction industry. Also training on health and safety to all stakeholders should be taken into account as well as introduction of <b>safety</b> <b>gears</b> to the workers on the field of construction building sites...|$|R

40|$|Industrial timber {{harvesting}} in plantation forests in Tanzania was solely performed by public agencies until mid 1980 ’s. During that period harvesting operations were labour-intensive and semi-mechanized, coupled with low production rates and high production costs. Following {{the privatization of}} forestry industries, logging is currently being carried out by private companies. This study was carried out to assess and compare working conditions, physical workload and productivity in logging operations under private and public logging regimes. Data were collected in Sao Hill Forest plantations from a clear felling operation being carried out in a 26 years old Pinus patula stand. Time study was undertaken for tree cutting, skidding, manual bunching and loading operations. Physical workload data were obtained through heart rate measurement by using portable electronic heart rate monitor. Working conditions were assessed through ergonomic checklist administered to 45 loggers. The {{results indicated that the}} productivity in tree cutting averaged 4. 7 m 3 /h and 3. 4 m 3 /h for chainsaw and crosscut operations respectively, while in bunching and loading the respective values of 5. 1 m 3 /h and 11. 3 m 3 /h made higher production on the private regime as compared to the public. The working conditions were generally poor with low safety, inadequate payment and poor working tools coupled with high labour turnover. The physical workload was 78 % and 65 % heart rate increase for crosscut saw and chainsaw crews. This is a slight increase compared to the public logging regime estimated at 65 % and 57 % increase for crosscut saw and chainsaw respectively. However, the increased productivity observed in the private regime was not due to improved working conditions, but rather a result of the workers’ higher engagement and placed effort in performing production tasks. Training of the crews, improvement of payments, supervision and provision of <b>safety</b> <b>gears</b> are recommended for improved production and reduced occupational health hazards...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Safety {{and traffic}} flow of {{production}} facilities also depends upon the reliability of technical security equipment. Gearing in the transmission mechanisms must satisfy the conditions of strength calculation. This calculation consists of checking of the gear teeth on bend and contact. From the stress of gears is show that the basic requirements of the material are high hardness of works surfaces and bending strength. Steels best meet these conditions. Used steel with surface hardness up to 350 HBW, or heat treated steel with hardness of 500 - 650 HBW. The advantage of these materials is the high value of the contact pressure in the tough centre core of the tooth. As a final heat treatment are used surface hardening, cementation and hardening, nitridation and carbo-nitridation. Good properties of heat-treated steels are at the correct thickness of the heat-treated layer of the tooth.

40|$|Gears {{are very}} {{important}} in the transmission of power between two shafts close together with a constant velocity ratio; search in gear damage by using vibration signals is still very attractive, because the vibration signals from gears {{are not easy to}} interpret. A failure diagnosis transmission based on Fourier analysis of the vibration signal produced from a speed reducer has shown its limits in terms of spectral resolution. For helicopter <b>safety,</b> early <b>gear</b> fault detection is important to prevent system break down and accident. Among the methods proposed in the literature, cepstral analysis has shown it efficiency. Cepstrum used to identify damage gear, it appears in the cepstrum clear peaks called rahmonic so it is easy to identify the change in the system and able to detect and foresee the development of the lateral band. This paper proposes how to detect faults in gearbox of helicopter by registration signals during flight, with spectrum analysis and cepstrum analysis. Analyzed results show that the proposed method is effective to extract modulating signal and help to detect the early gear fault...|$|R
