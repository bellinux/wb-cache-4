25|$|The most {{valuable}} seafood catches are lobster, scallops and <b>snow</b> <b>crab.</b> The farming of Atlantic {{salmon in the}} Passamaquoddy Bay region is an important local industry.|$|E
25|$|The fishing {{industry}} in the adjacent community of Northport is a significant economic activity, with landings by fishing boats totalling 3 million kilograms of species such as American lobster, mussels, <b>snow</b> <b>crab,</b> soft shell clams, cod, herring, American plaice, mackerel, sea scallop, yellowtail, eel, winter flounder, smelt, rock crab, tomcod, silversides, porbeagle, and blue shark.|$|E
25|$|The fishery {{has yet to}} recover, and may {{not recover}} at all because of a {{possibly}} stable change in the food chain. Atlantic cod was a top-tier predator, along with haddock, flounder and hake, feeding upon smaller prey such as herring, capelin, shrimp and <b>snow</b> <b>crab.</b> With the large predatory fish removed, their prey has had a population explosion and have become the top predators.|$|E
50|$|C. opilio crabs eat other {{invertebrates}} that {{reside in}} the benthic shelf, such as crustaceans, bivalves, brittle stars, polychaetes, and even phytobenthos and foraminiferans. <b>Snow</b> <b>crabs</b> are also scavengers, and aside from preying on other benthic shelf invertebrates, they also prey on annelid worms and mollusks. Males typically prove to be better predators than mature females, and prey type depends upon predator size, with the smallest crabs feeding mainly on amphipods and ophiuroids, while the largest crabs feed mainly on annelids, crustacean decapods, and fish. Cannibalism is also practised at times among <b>snow</b> <b>crabs,</b> most frequently by intermediate-sized females.|$|R
50|$|Until recently, the NAO {{had been}} in an overall more {{positive}} regime since the late 1970s, bringing colder conditions to the North-West Atlantic, which has been linked with the thriving populations of Labrador Sea <b>snow</b> <b>crabs,</b> which have a low temperature optimum.|$|R
50|$|In 1996, {{they were}} first {{recorded}} in the Barents Sea, where considered invasive, but how they arrived there is unclear. Another commercially important species, the red king crab, was deliberately introduced to the same region. Like that species, <b>snow</b> <b>crabs</b> likely will have an adverse effect on the native species of the Barents Sea.|$|R
25|$|An {{example of}} a cascade in a complex, open-ocean {{ecosystem}} occurred in the northwest Atlantic during the 1980s and 1990s. The removal of cod (Gadus morhua) and other ground fishes by sustained overfishing resulted in increases in the abundance of the prey species for these ground fishes, particularly smaller forage fishes and invertebrates such as the northern <b>snow</b> <b>crab</b> (Chionoecetes opilio) and northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis). The increased abundance of these prey species altered the community of zooplankton that serve as food for smaller fishes and invertebrates as an indirect effect.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, at {{the peak}} of the king crab industry, Alaskan {{fisheries}} produced 200 million pounds of crab. However, by 1983 the total size of the catch had dropped to less than 10% of this size. Several theories for the precipitous drop in the crab population have been proposed including overfishing, warmer waters, and increased fish predation. The slow harvest forced many fishermen to diversify and catch snow crabs (such as bairdi (tanner) crab and <b>snow</b> <b>crab)</b> or cod. In recent years strict regulations have been enforced in order to responsibly manage the populations and allow them to rebound. The red and blue king crab population has stayed relatively low in almost all areas except Southeast Alaska since 1983, forcing many fishermen to concentrate on the golden king crab.|$|E
25|$|The {{moratorium}} in 1992 {{marked the}} largest industrial closure in Canadian history. In Newfoundland alone, over 22,000 fishers and plant workers from over 400 coastal communities became unemployed. In response to dire warnings {{of social and}} economic consequences, the federal government intervened, initially providing income assistance through the Northern Cod Adjustment and Recovery Program, and later through the Atlantic Groundfish Strategy, which included money specifically for the retraining of those workers displaced by the closing of the fishery. Newfoundland has since experienced a dramatic environmental, industrial, economic, and social restructuring, including considerable outmigration, but also increased economic diversification, an increased emphasis on education, and the emergence of a thriving invertebrates fishing industry (as the predatory groundfish population declined, <b>snow</b> <b>crab</b> and northern shrimp proliferated, providing the basis for a new industry that is roughly equivalent in economic value as the cod fishery it replaced). Newfoundland's experience with the cod fishery is certainly an interesting one: the dramatic collapse of a natural resource that sustained and defined a people for over 500 years offers lessons to communities everywhere that have within their jurisdiction the maintenance of an ecosystem and its resources and illustrates clearly the importance of taking seriously the health and vitality of the Earth's natural systems.|$|E
50|$|<b>Snow</b> <b>crabs</b> {{are very}} {{abundant}} in the Atlantic Ocean region. More specifically, they {{are found in the}} Western Atlantic area near Greenland, Newfoundland, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and on the Scotian Shelf. This crab species is also found across the North Pacific area, in areas ranging from Alaska to northern Siberia, and through the Bering Strait to the Aleutian Islands, Japan, and Korea.|$|R
50|$|<b>Snow</b> <b>crabs</b> have a {{very high}} {{reproductive}} potential: each year, every single female carries eggs. Females are fertilised internally and can carry up to 150,000 eggs under their abdomens after mating. Females usually lay their eggs in very deep areas of the ocean, such as in deposits of phytodetritus. Males are also capable of mating at both immature and mature stages of their lives.|$|R
40|$|<b>Snow</b> <b>crabs</b> Chionoecetes opilio {{are quite}} {{productive}} at suitable temperatures, {{but can also}} be abundant in water cold enough to depress settlement of larvae, growth, and reproduction. In much of the northern Bering Sea, bottom water temperatures are below - 1 °C for {{most or all of}} the year. Crab pelagic larvae prefer to settle at temperatures above 0 °C, so we found high densities of juveniles only where intruding warm currents deposited larvae in localized areas. After settlement, maturing crabs appeared to exhibit ontogenetic migration toward deeper, warmer water. Cold temperatures excluded key predators, but decreased fecundity by restricting females to small body size (with associated small clutches) and to breeding every 2 yr. Migration to warmer water may allow females to breed annually and to encounter more adult males needed to fertilize subsequent clutches. Because older males also emigrate, remaining adolescent males probably inseminate newly maturing females. Without localized intrusion of warmer currents, <b>snow</b> <b>crabs</b> might not persist at high densities in such cold waters. However, they are currently very abundant, and export many pelagic larvae and adults...|$|R

50|$|At {{the time}} of Small’s (2012) studies, 38 host {{crustacean}} species {{have been affected by}} Hematodinium parasites. Some of the economically-important infected hosts include tanner and <b>snow</b> <b>crabs</b> from the Northeast Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, blue crabs in the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States, Norwegian lobsters, and Edible crabs from Europe. It is anticipated that the geographical spread of Hematodinium will grow and reach various other aquatic regions globally due to oceanic currents, host movements and habitat expansions, as well as transportation vessels. Furthermore, as new crustacean species are targeted and fished as commercial seafood, new species of pathogens may be discovered. This was the case in a recent finding in multiple Asian crustacean farm facilities. Small (2012) notes that only aquaculture species from southern and eastern China have been documented, which include swimming crab P. trituberculatus, the mud crab S. serrata, and the ridgetail white prawn Exopalaemon carinicauda. In addition, a small new finding of Hematodinium parasites in crustaceans was also recently discovered in Russian waters.|$|R
