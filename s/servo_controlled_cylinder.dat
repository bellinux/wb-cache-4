40|$|Abstract. The Screw Down System (SDS) is {{a typical}} {{hydraulic}} <b>servo</b> <b>control</b> system. It is the key actuator of cold rolling mill. The dynamic performance of SDS has {{a significant effect on}} the accuracy of thickness. Hydraulic <b>servo</b> <b>control</b> system is not always optimal and stable due to highly nonlinear and parameter uncertainties.

Modeling and simulating the hydraulic <b>servo</b> <b>control</b> system of SDS using this method, the numerical simulation results show that the maximum overshoot and static error of the compensated system are more less than that of without nonlinear compensation. The overshoot of the compensated system is less than 10 % when the cold strip is rolling. So the thickness tolerance of the cold strip can be guaranteed easily. This self- adaptive compensation method can be used to other hydraulic <b>servo</b> <b>control</b> systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, a biologically {{inspired}} {{motion detector}} (Reichardt-Model) is introduced into visual <b>servo</b> <b>control</b> to ensure {{stability of the}} system with high gain and timedelay in its feedback. As {{a consequence of the}} specific velocity dependence of the Reichardt-Model, the stability margin of the visual <b>servo</b> <b>control</b> is increased and high overall gains, thus, better performance are achievable. As the first step of the study, the control performance of visual <b>servo</b> <b>control</b> with different sampling and different time-delay in its visual feedback loop, and velocity control performance with Reichardt-Model are investigated. A high-speed visual <b>servo</b> <b>control</b> system with up to 500 Hz framerate is built up on a 1 -DOF linear axis. With the results of simulation, the inner velocity control loop with Reichardt-Model is demonstrated to be more stable than standard model without Reichardt-Model when feedback gain increases and time-delay is presented. The results of real-time experiments show an improved performance by utilizing highspeed visual feedback or when the overall time-delay is small. I...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{precision}} of temperature control achieved in clinical practice during therapeutic hypothermia in neonates {{has not been}} described. METHODS: The hourly rectal temperature recordings from 17 infants treated with <b>servo</b> <b>controlled</b> and an equal number treated with manually adjusted cooling equipment were examined. The target rectal temperature for all infants is 33. 5 degrees C for 72 h. RESULTS: During 6 to 72 h after start of cooling, the mean (95 % CI, variance) of the averaged rectal temperatures was 33. 6 degrees C (95 % CI 33. 4 degrees C to 33. 8 degrees C, 0. 1 degrees C) in the manually adjusted group and 33. 4 degrees C (95 % CI 33. 3 degrees C to 33. 5 degrees C, 0. 04 degrees C) in the <b>servo</b> <b>controlled</b> group (means, p= 0. 08; equality of variance, p= 0. 03). The variance was also significantly different between infant groups during 1 to 5 h after start of cooling, p= 0. 01, but not during rewarming. CONCLUSION: The rectal temperature can be maintained close to the target temperature with either manually adjusted or <b>servo</b> <b>controlled</b> equipment, but there is less temperature variability with the <b>servo</b> <b>controlled</b> system in use in the UK...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a {{networked}} visual <b>servo</b> <b>control</b> {{system with}} distributed computation is proposed {{to overcome the}} low sampling rate problem in vision-based control systems. A real-time image data transmission protocol based on Realtime Transport Protocol (RTP) is developed. The captured images are sent to different processing nodes connected over a communication network and processed in parallel. Thus, a high sampling rate of the visual feedback is achieved under a cloud image processing architecture. The varying image processing delay caused by the varying number of extracted features and the random transmission delay are modeled as a random process with Bernoulli distribution. By using the input-delay approach, the resulted networked visual <b>servo</b> <b>control</b> system is reformulated into a stochastic continuous-time system with time-varying delay. Experiments on two 1 -DoF linear motor modules are carried out to validate the proposed approach. A visual <b>servo</b> <b>control</b> system without parallel distributed computation is implemented for comparison. The experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvement by the proposed approach. Control signa...|$|R
