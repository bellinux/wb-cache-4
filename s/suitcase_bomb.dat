25|$|Murphy dropped one <b>suitcase</b> <b>bomb</b> each on {{his first}} two bombing runs, both of {{which turned out to}} be duds, and it was his third pass before managed to hit anything: the Mexican custom house near where the crowd of American spectators had formed. The {{resulting}} explosion sent small bits of shrapnel and other fragments into the crowd of spectators and caused the American patrons of the bars and clubs on the Mexican side of the border to rush back to their side of the line. Among the casualties were a reporter and a photographer, along with many others, but nobody was killed and all of the injuries were considered minor. After realizing the danger of watching the battle from such a short distance away, the crowd dispersed and went home, some to Fry and Buena.|$|E

500|$|In 1999, The New York Times {{reported}} that Jesse Ventura first approached Trump {{about a possible}} 2000 presidential run while both were in attendance at a wrestling event in Atlantic City. [...] Trump's ambitions may have spawned earlier. The America We Deserve co-writer Dave Shiflett said Trump first thought about running in late 1998, {{when he looked at}} his political advantages in money and name recognition, and concluded that he was [...] "at least as competent" [...] as then President Bill Clinton. According to Shiflett, this prompted Trump to ask top aide Roger Stone to find the [...] "most eminent hack writer in America" [...] to put Trump's political ideas into a book. [...] Stone reached out to Shiflett, a contributor to The American Spectator. In spring 1999, Shiflett met with Trump about the project that would later become The America We Deserve. [...] During the initial meeting, Shiflett claims Trump raised concerns about a <b>suitcase</b> <b>bomb</b> destroying Manhattan.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Neil Cross. Before he started writing Cross did not know Connie was the mole from the {{previous}} episode, so he included it {{to help with the}} storyline. The character was originally intended to be killed {{by the end of the}} last episode, but Cross kept her alive until the end of the finale. He wanted her killed off at this episode, as he was the one who created Connie in the sixth series, and felt it gratifying to kill off a character he created. In writing the plot, Cross was inspired by the Rupert Walters script for [...] "Frequently Asked Questions" [...] from the third series, which revealed a series of weapons caches throughout the United Kingdom set up by the Russians during the Cold War; Cross wanted to use that as a way to introduce the nuclear <b>suitcase</b> <b>bomb.</b> The bombs design from the episode was based from actual designs, but invented its failsafes.|$|E

50|$|Apart {{from their}} {{internal}} security of Rhodesia, some notable operations outside of Rhodesia’s borders struck fear into the enemy. A particular mission took place was first {{thought to be}} a flop in Francistown, Botswana. Numerous <b>suitcase</b> <b>bombs</b> were planted by the Selous Scouts in order to liquidate ZIPRA command; the ones that did go off, went off too late and one failed to explode outside of a house. The Botswana authorities thought that ZIPRA’s explosion was due to their improper handling and care of the bombs. As a result, Botswana banned the importation of <b>suitcase</b> <b>bombs</b> within the country supplied by the Russians to ZIPRA, which undoubtedly saved the lives of Rhodesians.|$|R

The crucial witness against Megrahi {{for the prosecution}} was Tony Gauci, a Maltese storekeeper, who testified that he had sold Megrahi the clothing later found in {{the remains of the}} <b>suitcase</b> <b>bomb.</b> At the trial, Gauci appeared uncertain about the exact date he sold the clothes in question, and was not entirely sure that it was Megrahi to whom they were sold. Nonetheless, Megrahi's appeal against conviction was rejected by the Scottish Court in the Netherlands in March 2002. Five years after the trial, former Lord Advocate, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, publicly described Gauci as being [...] "an apple short of a picnic" [...] and [...] "not quite the full shilling".|$|E
2500|$|According {{to several}} {{prominent}} Omaha historians, racial discrimination {{was a significant}} issue in Omaha from the 1950s through the 2000s (decade).

[...] In 1969 three days of rioting swept the Near North Side, and in 1970 a policeman was killed by a <b>suitcase</b> <b>bomb</b> while answering a disturbance call at a house in North Omaha. However, as the 1966 Oscar-nominated documentary A Time for Burning and the 1970s books of Lois Mark Stalvey illustrated, the violence apparently served a purpose as lines of communication were opened between the [...] "West Omaha matron and the black laborer." ...|$|E
2500|$|At 1:07a.m. on October 1, 1910, {{the bomb}} went off in the alley outside the three-story Los Angeles Times {{building}} located at First Street and Broadway in Los Angeles. The 16 sticks of dynamite in the <b>suitcase</b> <b>bomb</b> were not enough to destroy the whole building, but the bomb ignited natural gas piped into the building. The Times was a morning paper, and so had employees working during the late-night early-morning hours. The bombers were unaware that a number of Times employees were working overnight to produce an extra edition the next afternoon which would carry the results of the Vanderbilt Cup auto race. [...] The bomb collapsed the side of the building, and the ensuing fire destroyed the Times building and a second structure next door that housed the paper's printing press. Of the 115 people still in the building, 21 died (most of them in the fire). The Times called the bombing the [...] "crime of the century", and publisher Otis excoriated unions as [...] "anarchic scum," [...] "cowardly murderers," [...] "leeches upon honest labor," [...] and [...] "midnight assassins." ...|$|E

2500|$|In this deposition, Peak {{told the}} County Attorney {{that he wanted}} to [...] "get out of this whole thing." [...] He cannot {{remember}} details of his story, such as the name of a woman who drove him from NCCF headquarters to David Rice's house to pick up the <b>suitcase</b> <b>bomb.</b> The County Attorney provided him Norma Aufrecht's name. Peak repeatedly said that Edward Poindexter got a box of dynamite and a suitcase out of David Rice's basement. At the trial, he would change his testimony to implicate another NCCF member, when his new testimony was that Raleigh House drove Duane with a suitcase full of dynamite to David Rice's house, Edward Poindexter took three sticks to make the bomb and put the remaining sticks in a box, which he took into the basement. Peak also claimed that he put the suitcase {{in the middle of the}} room standing up, and that someone else must have laid it down in the doorway and armed it to explode. He refused to say that he attached the bomb to the floor, which annoyed Art O'Leary who told him on page 25, [...] "As a practical matter, it doesn't make any difference what the truth is concerning you at all." [...] At other points in the deposition, Peak said that police officers told him Panthers were coming from out of town to eliminate him. He specifically said that Foxall told him he was the last person seen carrying a suitcase at 28th and Ohio that night.|$|E
2500|$|After {{hiding out}} {{for nearly a}} week, Duane Peak was arrested for the crime on August 28. [...] In his first {{statement}} to police, without having consulted an attorney, Peak {{said that there was}} an envelope for him at NCCF headquarters on Sunday, August 16. Inside, a note told him to go in back of the Lothrop Drug store and pick up a suitcase, which he did before 5 p.m. He was instructed to take the suitcase to an address near 28th and Ohio at 11 p.m. that night and leave it on the field side of a fence. The note told him to go to a particular payphone before 2 a.m. and wait for a phone call. The phone rang and a woman's voice told him to call 911 and report a woman dragged into 2867 Ohio. The police report indicates that he admitted to placing the 911 call. Peak implicated neither Rice nor Poindexter in his first statement. [...] There are no police reports for August 29 or August 30, so it is unknown who talked to him over the weekend, though in his February 4, 1971 deposition, Peak said that Lt. James Perry interrogated him several times over that weekend. On Monday, August 31, Peak told the County Attorney Art O'Leary in a deposition, that Poindexter had made the bomb at Rice's house, told him to plant it, and then lure the police to the vacant house with an anonymous 911 call. (Peak allegedly carried a <b>suitcase</b> <b>bomb</b> with a clothespin triggering device into three vehicles and to two different residences from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. that day, at one point putting it in the trunk of a car because there were seven passengers in the car including his two small nieces.) ATF Agent Tom Sledge, brother of the Omaha police officer assigned to the call, was present during Peak's deposition, as were two Omaha Police officers, Bill Coleman and Pitmon Foxall and Peak's attorney, Tom Carey, although Peak had to ask the County Attorney who Carey was.|$|E

50|$|On October 30, 1946, Feinstein {{participated in}} a raid on the Jerusalem railway station. The attack {{was one of a}} series of {{sabotage}} operations the Irgun carried out against the railways that day, as part of the Irgun's overall efforts to paralyze the British Mandatory government. The British had advance intelligence of the plan, and the operation was further compromised when the Irgun, not wanting to harm civilians in the station, published an advance warning. On the day of the raid, the British were waiting in ambush at the station. The Irgun raiders arrived in two taxis, and Feinstein drove the one carrying the bombs which were to be used - three suitcases filled with explosives. The team then rushed into the station, laid the three <b>suitcase</b> <b>bombs,</b> and put up a sign warning of mines. However, they came under British fire, and four of the attackers were hit, including Feinstein, whose left arm was shattered. Feinstein and some teammates rushed back to his taxi, and managed to escape. Despite his injury, Feinstein managed to drive the taxi, under a hail of British gunfire, away from the station using only one arm. After their escape, the British attempted to remove the <b>suitcase</b> <b>bombs</b> they had abandoned. When a police sapper tried to lift one of the bombs, it exploded, killing him and devastating the interior of the station.|$|R
