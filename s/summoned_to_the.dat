5|$|During the Second Barons' War, Boniface {{seems to}} have sided first with the English bishops against King Henry, but later he sided with Henry. In 1262, he went to France, where he excommunicated the barons {{opposing}} the king. He was not <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Parliament at London in January 1265 because he was abroad. On {{the triumph of the}} king's party in 1265, he returned to England, arriving there in May 1266.|$|E
5|$|The game {{introduces}} the Batmobile as a drivable vehicle. The bulletproof Batmobile can be <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> player's location while on foot or, if the player is airborne, summoned to meet Batman as he lands. The vehicle features {{the ability to}} perform jumps, speed boosts, rotate on the spot, smash through objects like barricades and trees, and fire missiles that can immobilize enemy vehicles. Batman can eject from the Batmobile and immediately begin gliding around Gotham City.|$|E
5|$|A {{temporary}} wooden {{building was}} constructed each year, called Dover Castle, from which gunfire salutes were sounded during the competitions. Competitors were <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hillside {{by the sound}} of a hunting horn, to take part in various sports. Mounted cannons were fired to begin the events, which included horse-racing, coursing with hounds, running, jumping, dancing, sledgehammer throwing, fighting with swords and cudgels, quarterstaff, and wrestling. Prizes included silver trophies for the mounted sports, and perhaps also money for the other events.|$|E

5|$|Edward IV died {{suddenly}} in April 1483, leaving his young son, Edward his heir and the Duke of Gloucester Lord Protector {{of the new}} king and the country. Although he had been <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> parliament of January 1483, {{it is unlikely that}} Suffolk was in attendance at court at the time. Nor did he attend the dead king's funeral or interment. By July, the young king had been declared illegitimate; Suffolk was at Westminster Hall on 26 June 1483 when Gloucester claimed the throne, and he carried the royal sceptre at Richard's coronation. Suffolk's son, the Earl of Lincoln, was named as Richard III's heir to the throne when the king's own son, Edward of Middleham died in 1484. However, Suffolk did lose the Constableship of Wallinford and the Chiltern Hundreds to Lovell. In fact, Suffolk seems to have been no more favoured by Richard than he had been by Edward. In December 1483 Suffolk was <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> parliament which confirmed Richrd III's right to the throne, and the following year he undertook commissions of array in both Norfolk and Suffolk, as well as being part of the oyer and terminer which condemned the treasons of William Collingbourne in London.|$|E
5|$|In 6 BC, Tiberius {{launched}} a pincer movement against the Marcomanni. Setting out northwest from Carnuntum on the Danube with four legions, Tiberius passed through Quadi territory {{in order to}} invade the Marcomanni from the east. Meanwhile, general Gaius Sentius Saturninus would depart east from Moguntiacum on the Rhine {{with two or three}} legions, pass through newly annexed Hermunduri territory, and attack the Marcomanni from the west. The campaign was a resounding success, but Tiberius could not subjugate the Marcomanni because he was soon <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Rhine frontier to protect Rome's new conquests in Germania.|$|E
5|$|On September 6, 1915, {{police detective}} Jack Walters (voiced by Milton Lawrence) is <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> siege of a {{decrepit}} manor house in Boston. The manor is inhabited by a bizarre cult called the Fellowship of the Yith, led by one Victor Holt who has asked specifically for Walters {{to come and}} talk to him. Taking cover from an ensuing firefight, Walters finds himself separated from the police and trapped inside the mansion, with no option but to investigate. When the rest of the police finally break in, they find the cultists dead by mass suicide and Walters apparently insane. He is committed to Arkham Asylum, where he stays for six years.|$|E
50|$|Basically, {{the accused}} {{will never see}} an {{information}}. An information is the detailed information related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> offence which the prosecutor lays before a magistrate and requests for a <b>summons</b> <b>to</b> be issued. Thus, all the accused should receive is a summons from the court. In order <b>to</b> ensure <b>the</b> <b>summons</b> is received by and served <b>to</b> <b>the</b> accused, the court is first <b>to</b> mail <b>the</b> <b>summons</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> accused. If the accused does not appear and answer in the hearing required by the court, the court will assume the first service fails and will employ a police officer or court clerk <b>to</b> serve <b>the</b> <b>summons</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hand of the accused in person, following the guidance under Section 8(2) of the Magistrates Ordinance.|$|R

5|$|Pope's {{outstanding}} {{performance on the}} Mississippi earned him a promotion to major general, dated as of March 21, 1862. During the Siege of Corinth, he commanded the left wing of Halleck's army, but he was soon <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> East by Lincoln. After the collapse of Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan's Peninsula Campaign, Pope was appointed to command the Army of Virginia, assembled from scattered forces in the Shenandoah Valley and Northern Virginia. This promotion infuriated Frémont, who resigned his commission.|$|E
5|$|The Argentine, British and Chilean claims all overlap, {{and have}} caused friction. On 18 December 2012, the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office named a {{previously}} unnamed area Queen Elizabeth Land {{in tribute to}} Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee. On 22 December 2012, the UK ambassador to Argentina, John Freeman, was <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Argentine government as protest against the claim. Argentine–UK relations had previously been damaged throughout 2012 due to disputes over {{the sovereignty of the}} nearby Falkland Islands, and the 30th anniversary of the Falklands War.|$|E
5|$|The {{council was}} first called on 11 October 1147 by Eugene, who ordered the bishops and others <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> council to {{assemble}} at Trier on 21 March 1148. This {{is from a}} letter sent to Henry Zdík, the Bishop of Olmuetz by the pope. However, a letter sent by the pope on the next day, 12 October 1147, to Eberhard, the Archbishop of Salzburg, named Troyes as the location for the council. It is likely that Troyes, however, was a scribal error, as a further letter of Eugene's, to Suger, Abbot of St Denis, dated 6 October 1147, named Trier as the location also, thus confirming the location given in the letter of 11 October.|$|E

5|$|The crowd {{moved away}} from the {{immediate}} area of the custom house, but continued to grow in nearby streets. Captain Preston immediately called out most of the 29th Regiment, which adopted defensive positions in front of the state house. Acting Governor Thomas Hutchinson was <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> scene, and was forced by the movement of the crowd into the council chamber of the state house. From its balcony he was able to minimally restore order, promising there would be a fair inquiry into the shootings if the crowd dispersed.|$|E

After being <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> palace by Toad, Mario and Luigi confront and subdue Bowser, who coincidentally was attempting to kidnap Peach. Bowser decides against doing so, and teams up with Mario and Luigi to take her voice back from Cackletta, who has fled to the Beanbean Kingdom, with the intention of kidnapping Peach afterward when her voice would not destroy his castle.|$|E
5|$|The {{matter of}} {{cooperation}} {{had to be}} taken up at the highest level. In September 1943, the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and President Roosevelt negotiated the Quebec Agreement, which reinstated cooperation between Britain, the United States and Canada. Chadwick, Oliphant, Peierls and Simon were <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States by the director of Tube Alloys, Sir Wallace Akers, to work with the Manhattan Project. The Quebec Agreement established a new Combined Policy Committee to direct the joint project. The Americans disliked Akers, so Chadwick was appointed technical advisor to the Combined Policy Committee, {{and the head of the}} British Mission.|$|E

In February 1793 when New York again failed to respond, Oswald's attorney requested a default be entered at the August session if the state again failed to appear.|$|R
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) are <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ensuing hostage {{situation}} by Agent Lucy Kazdin (CCH Pounder), since Barry {{insists that he}} is an alien abductee. Mulder contacts Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) for assistance, asking her to look into Barry's history. Mulder acts as a hostage negotiator, calling Barry in order to earn his trust so that the standoff may be peacefully resolved. Barry quickly figures this out, causing Mulder to learn that he is a former FBI agent. A power outage occurs, frightening Barry and causing him to fire his gun, hitting one of the hostages. Mulder heads inside the travel agency with a paramedic. Barry releases the wounded hostage in exchange for Mulder, who is instructed to get Barry near the agency's front door so that snipers can fire on him.|$|E
5|$|Guest and Knowles were <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Defence Department {{and told}} to stop recruiting. The Administration had decided to raise a {{regiment}} in Rhodesia, and Guest joined the Salisbury battalion of the 1st Rhodesian Regiment with the rank of Lieutenant. The battalion was sent to South Africa to assist in suppressing the 1914 Maritz Rebellion by Boers opposed to fighting for Britain. It was not, however, deployed against the Rebellion and when it ended the battalion was sent, with the Imperial Light Horse, to reinforce the South African troops in the South-West Africa Campaign in German South-West Africa, present-day Namibia. They landed at Lambert's Bay on Christmas morning 1914, but made no contact with the enemy until they were sent to Swakopmund.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, {{fifteen years}} after a global cataclysm known as the Second Impact, {{teenager}} Shinji Ikari is <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> futuristic city of Tokyo-3 by his estranged father Gendo Ikari, director of the special paramilitary force Nerv. Shinji witnesses United Nations forces battling an Angel, one of a race of giant monstrous beings whose awakening was foretold by the Dead Sea Scrolls. Because of the Angels' near-impenetrable force-fields, Nerv's giant Evangelion bio-machines, synchronized to the nervous systems of their pilots and possessing their own force-fields, are the only weapons capable of keeping the Angels from annihilating humanity. Nerv officer Misato Katsuragi escorts Shinji into the Nerv complex beneath the city, where his father pressures him into piloting the Evangelion Unit-01 against the Angel. Without training, Shinji is quickly overwhelmed in the battle, causing the Evangelion to go berserk and savagely kill the Angel on its own.|$|E

50|$|Bristol South East by-election, 1961: Tony Benn had {{inherited}} a Peerage from his father. Although by-elections were routinely called where Members had succeeded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Peerage, the seat {{was not considered}} vacated until the Member had received a Writ of <b>Summons</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> House of Lords, and Benn, who refused <b>to</b> accept <b>the</b> Peerage, did not apply for one. The seat was declared vacant by {{a resolution of the}} House of Commons.|$|R

5|$|In the Lord High Steward's Court, a {{group of}} Lords Triers, sitting under the {{chairmanship}} of the Lord High Steward, acted as judge and jury. By custom the number of Triers was not fewer than 23, so that a majority was a minimum of 12, but in fact the number ranged from 20 to 35. The power to choose which peers served as Triers lay with the Crown and was sometimes subject to abuse, as only those peers who agreed with the monarch's position would be <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Court of the Lord High Steward, thereby favouring the desired verdict. This practice was ended by the Treason Act 1695, passed during the reign of King William III. The Act required that all peers be summoned as Triers. All subsequent trials were held before the full House of Lords.|$|E
5|$|Mary was <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{court of}} her {{grandfather}} Maximilian in 1514. On 22 July 1515, Mary and Louis {{were married in}} St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna. At the same time, Louis' sister Anne was betrothed to an as yet unspecified brother of Mary, with Emperor Maximilian acting as proxy. Due to their age, {{it was decided that}} the newly married couple would not live together for a few more years. Anne eventually married Mary's brother Ferdinand and came to Vienna, where the double sisters-in-law were educated together until 1516. That year, Mary's father-in-law died, making Louis and Mary king and queen of Hungary and Bohemia. Mary moved to Innsbruck, where she was educated until 1521. Maximilian encouraged her interest in hunting, while childhood lessons prompted an interest in music. This passion would later be demonstrated during her tenure as governor of the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|On 11 March 1970 a large protest {{took place}} outside the North Vietnamese and PRGSV embassies, as protesters demanded Viet Cong troops {{withdraw}} from Cambodia. The protests turned chaotic, as protesters looted both embassies {{and set them}} on fire, alarming Sihanouk. Sihanouk, who was in Paris at the time, contemplated between returning to quell the situation, and visiting Moscow, Beijing, and Hanoi. He opted for the latter, thinking that he could persuade its leaders to recall Viet Cong troops to their jungle sanctuaries, where they had originally established themselves between 1964 and 1969. Five days later, Oum Mannorine, the half-brother of Sihanouk's wife Monique, was <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> National Assembly to answer corruption charges. On that night after the hearing, Mannorine ordered troops under his command to arrest Lon Nol and Sirik Matak, but ended up getting arrested by Lon Nol's troops instead. On 18March 1970 the National Assembly voted to depose Sihanouk, allowing Lon Nol to assume emergency powers.|$|E
