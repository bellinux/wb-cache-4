5|$|Research {{focused on}} four {{individual}} days that accumulated more than 5.9 inches (15cm) of hail in 30 {{minutes on the}} Colorado front range has shown that these events share similar patterns in observed synoptic weather, radar, and lightning characteristics, suggesting the possibility of predicting these events prior to their occurrence. A fundamental problem in continuing {{research in this area}} is that, unlike hail diameter, hail depth is not commonly reported. The lack of data leaves researchers and forecasters in the dark when trying to verify operational methods. A cooperative effort between the University of Colorado and the National Weather <b>Service</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> progress. The joint project's goal is to enlist the help of the general public to develop a database of hail accumulation depths.|$|E
