40|$|Published in PubMed Central on 01 October 2010 Sonoporation uses {{ultrasound}} (US) {{to generate}} transient non-selective pores {{on the cell}} membrane and has been exploited as a non-viral intracellular drug and gene delivery strategy. The pore size determines the size of agents that can be delivered into the cytoplasm using the technique. However, measurements of the dynamic, submicron-scale pores have not been readily available. Electron microscopy or atomic force microscopy {{has been used to}} gauge pore size but such techniques are intrinsically limited to post US measurements that may not accurately reveal the relevant information. As previously demonstrated, changes of the transmembrane current (TMC) of a <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> under <b>voltage</b> clamp can be used for monitoring sonoporation in real time. Because the TMC is related to the diffusion of ions through the pores on the membrane, it can potentially provide information of the pore size generated in sonoporation.

The cells were exposed to US (0. 2 s, 0. 3 MPa, 1. 075 MHz) in the presence of Definity™ microbubbles. Experiments were designed to obtain the TMC corresponding to a single pore on the membrane. The size of the pores was estimated from an electro-diffusion model that relates the TMC with pore size from the ion transport through the pores on the membrane.

Using patch recording techniques, we have measured the resting membrane potentials, action potentials, transmembrane macroscopic ionic currents, and single Ca 2 +-activated K channel currents of GH 3 and GH 4 /C 1 rat pituitary tumor cells in response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). TRH, which stimulates prolactin secretion, causes a transient hyperpolarization of the membrane potential followed by a period of elevated action potential frequency. In <b>single</b> <b>cells</b> <b>voltage</b> clamped and internally dialyzed with solutions containing K+, TRH application results in a transient increase in Ca 2 +-activated K currents and a more protracted decrease in voltage-dependent K currents. However, in cells internally dialyzed with K+-free solutions, TRH produces no changes in inward Ca 2 + or Ba 2 + currents through voltage-dependent Ca channels. The time courses of the effects on Ca 2 +-activated and voltage-dependent K currents correlate with the phases of hyperpolarization and hyperexcitability, respectively. During application of TRH to whole <b>cells,</b> <b>single</b> Ca 2 +-activated K channel activity increases in cell-attached patches not directly exposed to TRH. In contrast, TRH applied directly to excised membrane patches produces no change in single Ca 2 +-activated K channel behavior.

In order to take the better advantage from the analysis of the on-site operation, and especially to correctly design the scheduled experimental tests on the system, we developed a mathematical model and run a simulated experimental campaign, applying a rigorous statistical approach to the analysis of the results. The aim of thiswork is the computer experimental analysis, through a statistical methodology (2 k factorial experiments), of the CHP 100 performance.

40|$|The test {{procedures}} for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are of significant relevance to assure comparable results for industrial {{research and development}} as well as academic studies. Certainly, PEMFC test results from different testing facilities are hardly comparable due to the variation in the test procedure and/or the test equipment. These differences strongly influence the examination results in PEMFC single cells, but affect stack results even more. Several aspects {{have to be considered}} for a reproducible and comparable stack test. On the one hand the operating parameters like reactant humidity, pressure and stoichiometry as well as stack temperature and electric load have to be controlled in a correct and reproducible manner. On the other hand it is mandatory to ensure the accurate measurement of these test input parameters as well as the test output parameters, namely stack and <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> <b>voltage.</b> Consequently, the positioning of the different parameter sensors, the choice of the control parameters and the sequence of parameter adjustment have to be defined in harmonized test protocols.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. As {{the global}} demand for energy {{continues}} to grow new technologies and systems must be developed to supply the market. This includes renewable energy generation, storage and conversion systems. The primary storage technology in use today in the portable electronics, the automotive sector {{and to a lesser}} extent power networks is battery based systems. To overcome some of the limitations inherent in batteries, fuel cell based power generators and converters have been developed. Fuel cells act as electrochemical energy converters that convert a fuel source such as natural gas directly into electrical power without any secondary phases. For systems running on Hydrogen generated via renewable or natural sources, the input/output cycle becomes completely sustainable. Out of the different fuel cell types available and under development, the Proton Exchange Membrane or Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel cell has emerged as the technology of choice, and currently owns more than 80 % of the commercial fuel cell market. This has spurred further research in the field to increase performance and life expectancy of the cell materials. A promising development in the form of High Temperature PEM (HT-PEM) fuel cells has recently emerged and addresses some of the shortcomings of the low temperature counterparts. A critical field of research is the condition monitoring strategies and technologies for the electrochemical device that ties in with the power conditioning sub-systems. This thesis presents the development of condition monitoring systems by conducting detailed studies on the fault/degradation mechanisms prevalent in the cell materials for the purpose of detection, classification and implementation of possible mitigation strategies. Specific consideration is given to the detailed analysis of the fault mechanisms in HT-PEM fuel cells that are not yet fully understood and commercialized. In particular, electrochemical equivalent circuit models and reduced order semi- empirical models are developed to facilitate fault detection. Based on these models, mitigation strategies for specific faults are proposed and experimentally verified. New systems and methods are developed for rapid online impedance signature mapping that provide a basis for early fault prediction that can increase system performance and life expectancy. The findings in this research provide valuable insight into the effect that most prevalent faults have on the internal electrochemistry and the impact on electrical performance. From the experimental results, a semi-empirical electrochemical model is developed to assist with life time estimation and system optimization. The model is integrated with a real time emulator platform that can reproduce <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> <b>voltage</b> levels at the high output currents and transient characteristics. A detailed analysis is conducted on CO poisoning and the resulting effects on key equivalent circuit parameters that enable quantification of the fault condition. It is shown that the catalyst at the higher operating temperature is still susceptible to a certain degree of semi-permanent degradation. To mitigate these effects, a new active current control strategy is proposed to enforce electro-oxidation of the CO to recover the lost active area that delivered superior results compared to current pulsing strategies. New rapid online detection strategies are proposed by using small voltage transients in an operational HT-PEM fuel cell. The method makes use of the discrete S-transform that overcomes some of the limits in other signal processing methods used in fuel cell diagnostics. To enable detailed parameter calculation, a population based incremental learning algorithm is implemented in the developed method. A new condition monitoring system is developed that makes use of Optimized Broadband Impedance Spectroscopy. The hardware is designed to accommodate both single cell and stack level implementation. It is shown that the proposed system is able to deliver measurements under extreme non-linear conditions that can occur in PEM fuel cells in a fraction of the time associated with normal EIS based systems...|$|E

With our believed to be new methods of rapid temperature control for single-molecule microscopy, we measured here the thermal response of the Na+-driven chimeric motor expressed in Escherichia coli cells. Motor torque at low load (0. 35 μm bead) increased linearly with temperature, twofold between 15 °C and 40 °C, and torque at high load (1. 0 μm bead) was independent of temperature, as reported for the H+-driven motor. <b>Single</b> <b>cell</b> membrane <b>voltages</b> were measured by fluorescence imaging and these were almost constant (∼ 120  mV) over the same temperature range.

A prototype <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> rotary water electrolyser was constructed, {{and a number}} of design challenges with regard to the practical application were addressed. The rotary electrolyser was tested over a range of current density, centrifugal acceleration, electrolyte concentration, temperature, and electrode geometry. The test results showed that at normal cell operating conditions (7. 7 M KOH solution, 348 K) much of the <b>cell</b> <b>voltage</b> benefits were achieved at an acceleration of about 16 g (g= 9. 81 ms- 2), equivalent to a rotational speed of 500 rpm (revolution per minute) for the rotary cell. The rotary electrolyser <b>cell</b> <b>voltage</b> was about 0. 25 - 0. 5 V, less than the equivalent static cell under similar operating conditions, depending on the current density. The <b>cell</b> <b>voltages</b> achieved, without an effective electrode catalytic coating, were comparable with typical industrial values of fully developed pressurised cells. At a higher acceleration of 41 g, the rotary cell's current density can be up to 13. 5 kAm- 2 without causing gas bubble blinding of the membranes and electrodes. When comparing with typical current densities (about 5 kAm- 2) found in commercial systems, this study demonstrated the potential of intensification...|$|R

Other metals such as lead, iron, magnesium, etc., can be studied as well; they yield different voltages than the zinc/copper pair. In particular, magnesium/copper <b>cells</b> can generate <b>voltages</b> as large as 1.6 V in lemon <b>cells.</b> This <b>voltage</b> is larger than obtainable using zinc/copper cells. It is {{comparable to that of}} standard household batteries (1.5 V), which is useful in powering devices with a <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> instead of using cells in series.|$|R

When the operation temperature of <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> increase 60  °C, the OCV of cell increase to 0.78  V and the maximum power density of the crosslinked QPVA/GO 15  wt.% composite membrane increase 11.4  mW cm− 2. After the durability testing, the maximum power density reduced to 7.65  mW cm− 2. The dropped of power density was subjected to activation loss of catalyst activity due to ethanol crossover {{and the loss of}} maximum power density was 32.8 %. The power loss depended on the current density drawn from the <b>single</b> <b>cell.</b> However, the value of OCV after the 1000  h test presented no significant reduction compared to before durability test [63].|$|R
40|$|In vitro {{brain slice}} {{electrophysiology}} {{is a powerful}} and highly successful technique where a thin slice is cut from the brain and kept alive artificially in a recording chamber. The design of this recording chamber is pivotal to the success {{and the quality of}} such experiments. Most often one of two types of chambers is used today, the interface chamber or the submerged chamber. These chambers, however, have the disadvantage that they are limited in either their experimental or their physiological properties respectively. Here we present a new working principle for an in vitro chamber design which aims at combining the advantages of the classical designs whilst overcoming their disadvantages. This is achieved by using a semipermeable membrane on which the slice is placed. The membrane allows for a fast flow of artificial cerebrospinal fluid of up to at least 17 ml/min. Due to a Bernoulli effect, this high speed flow also causes a 64 % increase in flow of solution across the membrane on which the slice rests. The fact that the membrane is transparent introduces the possibility of wide field inverted optical imaging to brain slice electrophysiology. The utility of this setup was demonstrated in the recording of local field potential, <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> and <b>voltage</b> sensitive dye imaging data simultaneously from an area smaller then 1 / 8 mm(2). The combination of all these features in the membrane chamber make it a versatile and promising device for many current and future in vitro applications, especially in the regard to optical imaging...|$|R

One technique involves a modular strap-on <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> protector which contains all the electronics required for monitoring <b>cell</b> <b>voltage,</b> responding to external commands, and forming a bypass circuit for the cell. A second technique, the multiplexed cell protector, uses common circuitry to monitor and control each cell in a battery pack. The third technique, the computerized cell protector, by replacing the hard-wired logic of the multiplexed cell protector with a microprocessor, achieves greatest control flexibility and inherent computational capability with a minimum parts count implementation...|$|R

This essentially results in a curve that represents the power per square centimeter of cell area required to produce hydrogen and oxygen.
