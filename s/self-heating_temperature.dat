40|$|AbstractSelf-heating of {{resistance}} thermometers {{is a well-known}} phenomenon, which occurs when the measuring current additionally heats up the sensing element. The following paper describes {{the influence of the}} self-heating of a Cernox thermometer on the uncertainty in cryogenic temperatures (8 K and 10 K). The <b>self-heating</b> <b>temperature</b> difference is related to the thermal resistance between the sensor and its surroundings. The <b>self-heating</b> <b>temperature</b> increase can be corrected by the basic two-current method. However, in measurements ofhigh accuracy, uncertainty of the self-heating correction, achieved by the basic two-current method, may not be sufficient. More advanced methods for self-heating correction are proposed, based on the use of more than two different currents. Uncertainty of the self-heating for four methods (basic two-current method, three-current method, four-current method and five-current method) at different cryogenic temperatures is calculated. We can find that using the advanced methods we can decrease the uncertainty from 0. 7 to 0. 5 mK at 8 K, and from 0. 84 to 0. 64 mK at 10 K. This decrease may not be significant in common cryogenic temperatures measurement, but it can present an improvement in measurements of the the highest accuracy.

Our approach seeks to fully cover the robot’s body with large force sensing taxels, but treats temperature sensors as small, point-like sensors sparsely distributed across the skin. We present a mathematical model to help predict how many of these point-like temperature sensors should be used in order to increase the likelihood of them making contact with an object. To evaluate our design, we conducted tests in which a robot arm used a cylindrical end effector covered with skin to slide objects and press on objects made from four different materials. After assessing the safety of our design, we also had the robot make contact with the forearms and clothed shoulders of 10 human participants. With 2. 0 s of contact, the actively-heated temperature sensors enabled binary classification accuracy over 90 % for the majority of material pairs.

Fatigue properties determination is a time and cost consuming process, it requires several days and specimens to be performed. The self-heating method offers the possibility to dramatically shorten the test duration. It consists in measuring the temperature of the structure under cyclic loading, and then linking it to fatigue properties. Only one specimen and few hours are required for fatigue properties identification providing important cost and time reduction.

The purpose of the conducted investigations is the determination of the dynamic mechanical behaviour of a polymer-based composite material under different excitation frequencies and temperatures. Design/methodology/approach: The dynamic mechanical analysis was employed for measurements of temperature and frequency dependence of the complex rigidity parameters. Obtained loss rigidity curves for different load frequencies enable the determination of the glass-transition temperatures and finally frequency-dependence of the loss rigidity determined {{on the basis of the}} kinetic molecular theory and Williams-Landel-Ferry (WLF) hypothesis. Findings: The dependency between glass-transition temperature and excitation frequency has been investigated. The activation energy of the phase transition as well as the temperature dependence of the shift factor was calculated. The glass-transition temperature and constants of WLF equation enable the determination of temperature and frequency dependence of the loss rigidity according to the time-temperature superposition principle. Research limitations/implications: The ranges of temperatures were limited to 30 - 150 °C and excitation frequencies to 1 - 200 Hz, the behaviour of the composite material outside these ranges can be estimated based on the theoretical assumptions only.

Practical implications: Obtained dependencies can be useful for estimation of the mechanical and thermal degradation of polymer-based composites and can be subsequently applied for the determination of fatigue, crack growth and residual life of composite structures.

ARC tests helped determine, a priori, whether the test oils would autoignite under reservoir conditions of pressure and temperature. Also, the limits of the low temperature range were established and Arrhenius oxidation kinetics parameters were estimated. The goals of the TG/PDSC tests were to identify temperature ranges over which the oil reacted with oxygen in the injected air, and to determine the fraction of the sample responsible for the reactivity. ARC and TG/PDSC tests demonstrate that Oils A and C offer favourable exothermic behaviour in the low temperature range with lower activation energies and low orders of reactions-the conditions typically favouring autoignition. The presence of rock material lowered the ignition temperature, confirming its impact on O 2 uptake. Oil A had a lower energy generation (ignition) temperature, and a stronger and smoother transition to the higher temperature region. Both oils responded favourably during isothermal aging with air as manifested by a drop in the initial <b>self-heating</b> <b>temperature</b> (a 15 °C drop for Oil A and a 10 °C drop for Oil C). The third oil, Oil B, showed unusual characteristics, with almost no impact of the core material on the starting temperature of the exotherm; rather, the core material appeared to have acted as a heat sink. Overall, Oil B needed a much higher activation energy to ignite, and its order of reactions was very high. Furthermore, it showed no response to isothermal aging, and hence, it is less likely to autoignite in the reservoir. Results revealed that ARC and TG/PDSC tests could be an effective tool to rank and study the oxidation characteristics in the low temperature range of the candidate oils. Also, it was observed that the oil composition and rock mineralogy are important factors affecting the type and rate of the oxidation reactions occurring in the low temperature range. Sarma, H.

40|$|<b>Self-heating</b> {{effects and}} <b>temperature</b> rise in AlGaN/GaN HEMTs grown on silicon and {{sapphire}} substrates are studied, exploiting transistor dc characterization methods. A negative differential output resistance is observed for high dissipated power levels. An analytical formula for a source-drain current drop {{as a function}} of parasitic source resistance and threshold voltage changes is proposed to explain this behavior. The transistor source resistance and threshold voltage is determined experimentally at different elevated temperatures to construct channel temperature versus dissipated power transfer characteristic. It is found that the HEMT channel temperature increases rapidly with dissipated power and at 6 W/mm reaches values of 320 C for sapphire and 95 C for silicon substrate, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Compost for the {{production}} of Agaricus blazei Murrill mushrooms, is produced from wheat straw, straw-bedded horse manure, chicken manure and gypsum. The substrate is made in two processes called Phase I (anaerobic) and Phase II (aerobic). Phase I includes mixing and moistening of the ingredients and a period of uncontrolled <b>self-heating</b> where <b>temperatures</b> will rise to 80 ºC. Phase II starts with a pasteurization period of 8 h at 56 - 60 ºC and continues with a conditioning period at 45 ºC for up to 7 days until volatile NH 3 has been cleared from the process by air. Quality parameters for compost cannot be established directly. Moisture and nitrogen contents and pH can be adjusted at the start of Phase I, but the values will be affected during processing. In this paperwork, we studied the physical properties (water content, electrical conductivity) and chemical composition (pH, organic matter, nitrogen, calcium, magnesium, ammonia) of four recipes of compost: classical, synthetic, mixt and original. During the experience, we recorded every hour the compost and the air temperature and the air relative humidity. The highest yield was obtained on synthetic compost with 42 kg mushrooms on 100 kg of compost. ...|$|R
40|$|Continuously {{thermophilic}} composting {{was examined}} with a 4. 5 -liter reactor {{placed in an}} incubator maintained at representative temperatures. Feed {{was a mixture of}} dried table scraps and shredded newspaper wetted to 55 % moisture. One run at 49 degrees C (run A) employed a 1 : 4 feed-to-compost ratio, while the other runs used a 10 : 1 ratio and were incubated at 50, 55, 60, or 65 degrees C. Due to <b>self-heating,</b> internal <b>temperatures</b> of the composting mass were 0 to 7 degrees C hotter than the incubator. Two full-scale composting plants (at Altoona, Pa., and Leicester, England) were also examined. Plate counts per gram (dry weight) on Trypticase soy broth (BBL Microbiology Systems) with 2 % agar ranged from 0. 7 X 10 (9) to 5. 3 X 10 (9) for laboratory composting and 0. 02 X 10 (9) to 7. 4 X 10 (9) for field composting. Fifteen taxa were isolated, including 10 of genus Bacillus, which dominated all samples except that from run A. Species diversity decreased markedly in laboratory composting at 60 degrees C and above, but was similar for the three runs incubated at 49, 50, and 55 degrees C. The maximum desirable composting temperature based on species diversity is thus 60 degrees C, the same as that previously recommended based on measures of the rate of decomposition...|$|R
