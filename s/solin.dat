5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, the economy of the city of Split and its {{surrounding}} area started to recover and Split soon became hub of the central Dalmatia, connecting the hinterland and the neighboring islands. This spurred development of the city port and its transport connections, including construction of a new breakwater and the Split–Knin railway. In 1925, the railway was linked to the Rijeka–Zagreb railway via Gospić, allowing development of a modern port. Since 1957, cargo terminals of the Port of Split were relocated from the city centre to industrial zones in <b>Solin</b> and Kaštela areas, while passenger traffic still uses the centrally positioned harbor.|$|E

McGill's largest residence is New Residence Hall ("New Rez"), a converted four-star hotel located a few blocks east of campus at Park Avenue and Prince Arthur. <b>Solin</b> Hall, located near Lionel-Groulx station, is McGill's second largest residence, housing roughly 300 students. Carrefour Sherbrooke Residence Hall was opened in 2009 on 475 Sherbrooke Street West, previously the Four Points Sheraton Hotel.

5|$|Perched on an {{isolated}} rocky eminence, inaccessible on three sides, the fortress overlooks Split, the ancient Roman settlement of Salona, <b>Solin,</b> Kaštela and Trogir, {{and most of}} the central Dalmatian islands. Historically, the fortress has controlled access to and from Bosnia, Dalmatia and inland Croatia. The importance of such a position was felt by every army that invaded, or held possession of this part of Croatia. Klis Fortress was a point against which their attacks were always directed, and it has been remarkable for the many sieges it withstood. It has been of major strategic value in Croatia throughout history.|$|E
5|$|The {{attempts}} {{to relieve the}} citadel ended in farce. Badly-drilled reinforcements sent by the Habsburgs fled in fear of the Ottomans, and their {{attempts to}} re-board their boats at <b>Solin</b> Bay caused many vessels to sink. Niccolo dalla Torre and the papal commissioner managed to escape. Kružić himself– who had left the fortress {{to make contact with}} the reinforcements- was captured and executed; the sight of his head on a stick overwhelmed the remaining defenders of Klis, who were now willing to give up the fortress in return for safe passage north. After Kružić's death, and with a lack of water supplies, the Klis defenders finally surrendered to the Ottomans in exchange for their freedom, on 12 March 1537. Many of the citizens fled the town, while the Uskoci retreated to the city of Senj, where they continued fighting the Ottoman army.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian {{was born}} near Salona in Dalmatia (<b>Solin</b> in modern Croatia), some time around 244. His parents {{gave him the}} Greek name Diocles, or {{possibly}} Diocles Valerius. The modern historian Timothy Barnes takes his official birthday, 22 December, as his actual birthdate. Other historians are not so certain. Diocles' parents were of low status, and writers critical of him claimed {{that his father was}} a scribe or a freedman of the senator Anullinus, or even that Diocles was a freedman himself. The first forty years of his life are mostly obscure. The Byzantine chronicler Joannes Zonaras states that he was Dux Moesiae, a commander of forces on the lower Danube. The often-unreliable Historia Augusta states that he served in Gaul, but this account is not corroborated by other sources and is ignored by modern historians of the period. The first time Diocletian's whereabouts are accurately established, in 282, he was made by the newly Emperor Carus commander of the Protectores domestici, the élite cavalry force directly attached to the Imperial household – a post that earned him the honor of a consulship in 283. As such, he took part in Carus' subsequent Persian campaign.|$|E
500|$|The Port of Split {{is located}} on the Adriatic Sea coast in a bay {{protected}} by the Split peninsula and a string of islands. Its facilities include terminals and other structures in Split, <b>Solin</b> and Kaštela, all located on approximately [...] of coast. The port is connected by the International E-road network routes E65 and E71 carried by the Croatian A1 motorway and the D1 state road. The port is also connected with Zagreb by an electrified single-track railway, which runs through Knin and Karlovac.|$|E
500|$|According to {{the initial}} plan, {{on the night of}} 11 August, the Split Detachment was to move just outside the town and collect weapons that had been {{captured}} on 13 April. They would then link up with the <b>Solin</b> Detachment and continue towards Kamešnica. From there, they would travel to Otok to meet with the Sinj Detachment. On 8 August, a meeting of Communist Party members and sympathisers was held in a field house between Split and Stobreč to ask for volunteers to join the Split Detachment. The detachment was formed on 11 August, and consisted of 66 members organized in three platoons. The detachment departed Split on the same day, under the command of Đordano Borovčić-Kurir with [...] commissar Alfred Santini, and accompanied by Kovačević-Lala who was in overall command of all Partisan detachments in Dalmatia.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the fall}} of the Roman Empire and {{probably}} already from 490 AD, Liburnia within Dalmatia passed to the rule of the Ostrogoths, which lasted for six decades. The region of Savia was administratively added to the Gothic province of Dalmatia; the capital city of the both provinces was Salona (<b>Solin),</b> a seat of the ruler [...] "comes Dalmatiarum et Saviae".|$|E
2500|$|Within {{the area}} of the Roman {{province}} of Dalmatia, various tribal groupings, which were called sclaviniae by the Byzantines, were settled along the Adriatic coast. Croatia in the early Middle Ages was an area bounded by the Eastern Adriatic hinterland on one side, then extended to a part of western Herzegovina, western and central Bosnia, then into Lika, Gacka and Krbava, and North-West to Vinodol and [...] Labin in the Croatian Littoral area. Several coastal Dalmatian cities were under the rule of the Byzantines, including Split, Zadar, Kotor and Dubrovnik, as well as islands of Hvar and Krk. To the south Croatia bordered with the land of the Narentines, which stretched from the rivers Cetina to Neretva, and had the islands of Brač, Hvar, Korčula, Mljet, Vis and Lastovo in its possession. In the southern part of Dalmatia, there was Zahumlje (Zachumlia), Travunia and Dioclea (today Montenegro). North of Croatia there was the Duchy of Pannonia. Croatia, as well as other early medieval states, didn't have a permanent capital and Croatian dukes resided in various places on their courts. The first important center of Croatia was Klis near Split, where Duke Trpimir I resided. Other dukes ruled from the towns of <b>Solin,</b> Knin, Biaći and Nin.|$|E
2500|$|... "Duchy of Croatia" [...] ( [...] ; also [...] "Duchy of the Croats", Kneževina Hrvata; [...] "Dalmatian Croatia", Dalmatinska Hrvatska; [...] "Littoral Croatia", Primorska Hrvatska; Greek: Χρωβατία, Chrovatía), was {{a medieval}} Croatian duchy that was {{established}} in the former Roman province of Dalmatia. Throughout its time it had several seats, namely Klis, <b>Solin,</b> Knin, Biaći and Nin, comprised the littoral, or coastal part of today's Croatia and included {{a big part of the}} mountainous hinterland. The Duchy was in the center of competition between the Carolingian Empire and the Byzantine Empire for rule over the area. Rivalry with Venice emerged in the first decades of the 9th century and was to continue for the following centuries. Croatia also waged battles with the Bulgarian Empire, with whom the relations improved greatly afterwards, and the Arabs and sought to extend its control over important coastal cities under the rule of Byzantium. Croatia saw periods of vassalage of the Franks or Byzantines and de facto independence until 879 when Croatian Duke Branimir received recognition from Pope John VIII as an independent realm. The ruling dynasty of Croatia was the House of Trpimirović, with interruptions by the House of Domagojević (864–878 and 879–c. 892). The Duchy existed until around 925 when, during the rule of Duke Tomislav, Croatia became a kingdom.|$|E
