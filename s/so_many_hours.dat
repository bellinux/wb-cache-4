25|$|In 1937, Ahn {{was invited}} to Dublin, Ireland, to perform Symphonic Fantasy Korea. It easily won the Irish audience, as Ireland had been under British rule just as Korea was under the Japanese rule. He {{then went back to}} Vienna and met with the famous {{composer}} Richard Strauss to discuss his Symphonic Fantasy Korea. At the same time, Ahn was attending the Eötvös Loránd University on a scholarship from the Hungarian government, and, in 1939, Ahn graduated from the University. Complimenting Ahn on his talent, Strauss appointed Ahn to conduct a concert in Budapest in place of himself. Unfortunately, Ahn had spent <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>hours</b> in preparing for the concert that he collapsed during the last song. Despite this, the Hungarian newspapers praised Ahn for his efforts. At Strauss's recommendation, the Rome Philharmonic Orchestra gladly accepted Ahn as its conductor; many other orchestras across Europe followed, and Ahn travelled all over Europe to perform.|$|E

500|$|In December 2008, Tom Morello {{revealed}} that Rage Against the Machine shows in 2009 were a possibility, although {{plans for the}} band to record a new studio album were very unlikely. When asked by Billboard.com whether they planned {{to head to the}} studio in 2009, Morello stated: [...] "we've had a wonderful {{year and a half of}} playing shows, and I don't see any reason to not play more shows. The thing is there's only <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>hours</b> in the musical day, and mine are very occupied right now".|$|E
500|$|Linois passed Gibraltar on 3 July {{and during}} the night {{discovered}} the 14-gun brig HMS Speedy a short distance ahead. Linois's squadron had captured a number of merchant vessels during their voyage but this was their first warship, and although it {{was no match for}} size, Speedy was an infamous vessel under the command of Captain Lord Cochrane. Cochrane had spent the last year raiding the Spanish coast with great success, taking or destroying more than 50 ships including the celebrated Action of 6 May 1801 in which Cochrane had attacked and captured the far larger Spanish privateer frigate Gamo off Barcelona. Cochrane's initial belief that the strange ships were Spanish treasure vessels caused him to bring Speedy closer to the ships {{and by the time he}} realised his error escape was impossible. Rather than surrender however, Cochrane threw all of his guns and excessive weight overboard and manoeuvered his ship to avoid coming into range of the French broadsides. He then attempted to cut directly between the approaching Formidable and Desaix, the small target avoiding the concentrated fire of the French ships and pulling into open water. At this, Commodore Jean-Anne Christy-Pallière on Desaix swung his ship about and pursued, several shots damaging Speedys sails and rigging. As Speedy slowed, Desaix overtook the small brig and fired a full broadside at close range. This was fired as the French ship was on the uproll and therefore missed the deck entirely and failed to cause a single casualty. It did however tear away the remaining rigging and sails, leaving Speedy unmanageable. Rather than suffer another broadside, Cochrane surrendered his ship and was taken aboard Desaix, where Christy-Pallière acknowledged his brave defence by refusing to accept Cochrane's surrendered sword with the words [...] "I will not accept the sword of an officer who has for <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>hours</b> struggled against impossibility". From Cochrane, Linois learned of Saumarez's presence ahead of him and, knowing that his presence would have been reported by the garrison at Gibraltar, his squadron returned eastwards around Cabrita Point and came to anchor at Algeciras, a fortified Spanish port which lay directly opposite and within sight of Gibraltar across the Bay of Gibraltar on the 4 July.|$|E
2500|$|James and Katherine {{performed}} {{this experiment}} in their home. [...] Their neighbors supposedly {{thought that they}} were [...] "mad to spend <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>hours</b> staring into a coffin." [...] Katherine's observations differed from Jame's on several accounts. [...] James described these differences in section XIII of his publication, noting that there was a [...] "measurable difference" [...] between the colors perceived by each observer. [...] Campbell also cites readings by C. H. Cay to be different from Katherine's, although a third observer is not listed in this particular Philosophical Transactions publication. [...] This led him to develop his theory of colour vision and to discover the (commonly occurring) blindness of the Foramen Centrale to blue light.|$|E

2500|$|Despite recent {{rehabilitation}} and merging {{of the genre}} with other genres, the stigma attached to the romance genre continues to be strong, with some dedicated readers embarrassed to admit to buying or even reading the books. [...] The romance genre has over the years generated significant derision, skepticism and criticism. Some critics point {{to a lack of}} suspense, as {{it is obvious that the}} hero and heroine will eventually resolve their issues, and wonder whether it is beneficial [...] "for women to be whiling away <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>hours</b> reading impossibly glamorized love stories." [...] According to fiction author Melissa Pritchard, a romance novel [...] "perpetuates something slightly dangerous, that there's this notion, that there's this perfect love out there, and it can distract you from the work of loving yourself." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 1939, The Netherlands ordered 24 Hawk 75A-7s {{for their}} colonies of the Dutch East Indies (Oost Indië). These planes were [...] powered by 1,200hp Cyclones. Factory {{armament}} was one [...]50 inch and one [...]303 inch [...] machine {{gun in the}} cowl with two [...]303 machine guns in the wings. After delivery, the [...]50 weapons were replaced to standardize parts and ammo. The plane could carry six 23kg bombs. The fighters were shipped in 1940 and almost rerouted to the Netherlands when Germany invaded. But as the mainland surrendered, the aircraft came to [...] the colonies where they were used extensively against the Japanese attack on the Far Eastern part of the kingdom. By that time, the aircraft had flown <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>hours</b> that the engines were showing serious wear and tear.|$|E
2500|$|The 169th Fighter Wing, South Carolina Air National Guard, was {{the first}} ANG fighter unit to deploy to Southwest Asia in direct support of the air war over Afghanistan. It sent over 200 {{personnel}} and six F-16CJs in January 2002 to Al Udeid Air Base in Doha, Qatar, to assist air combat operations over Afghanistan. In particular, they provided Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) against Taliban and al Qaeda positions, the only Air Force fighter unit in the theater to do so. F-16s sometimes were also configured for Cluster Bomb Units (CBUw). [...] In addition, F-16 pilots sometimes fired their 20mm gun against ground targets. Missions could last up to 10 hours with multiple air refuelings. After <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>hours</b> strapped in their seats, pilots generally received one to three days of crew rest. The unit returned to South Carolina on 3 April 2002.|$|E

2500|$|In {{regard to}} being {{asked if she}} is putting on a geeky and gaming persona for the cameras, Hex {{explains}} that it [...] "would be so impossible to manufacture a whole persona" [...] across all the different platforms that she uses to interact with people. Hex said the capture and logging is the most challenging part of the job, {{but it is also}} unique as if she is referencing a particular part of the game, she can show her own personal experience rather than rolling stock footage. Bajo says this is also for editorial reasons in that, [...] "We need to defend our point by showing the footage to satisfy the ABC's charter." [...] Bajo notes that in the show's early days, there were some intense forum flames over things like missing a detail out, or not agreeing with the general consensus among viewers. He also says {{that if there is a}} genre of games that he and Hex don't like or aren't very good at, such as sports games, they won't ignore it and will try to be as honest as possible with their reviews. Bajo says that as people invest <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>hours</b> into a game, it is justified to feel a sense of ownership over it and feel defensive if someone doesn't feel the same way. For this reason he loves [...] "getting to the bottom of" [...] why certain games are liked by some and disliked by others. Bajo says you can't speak with conviction if you haven't done something, especially [...] " [...] something as involving as games". Bajo explains [...] " [...] the odd publisher/developer who wasn't happy with our review [...] we try to be fair, honest, and listen to all feedback we get to make sure we're not ever crossing any lines." ...|$|E
