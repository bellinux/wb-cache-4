5|$|Plasmid {{stabilising}} toxin-antitoxin {{systems have}} been used as examples of selfish DNA as part of the gene centered view of evolution. It has been theorised that toxin-antitoxin loci <b>serve</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> maintain their own DNA, {{at the expense of the}} host organism. Other theories propose the systems have evolved to increase the fitness of plasmids in competition with other plasmids. Thus, the toxin-antitoxin system confers an advantage to the host DNA by eliminating competing plasmids in cell progeny. This theory was corroborated through computer modelling. This does not, however, explain the presence of toxin-antitoxin systems on chromosomes.|$|E

25|$|The {{regulator}} can be DNA, RNA, {{protein and}} complexes of these. The interaction can be {{direct or indirect}} (through transcribed RNA or translated protein). In general, each mRNA molecule goes on to make a specific protein (or set of proteins). In some cases this protein will be structural, and will accumulate at the cell membrane or within the cell to give it particular structural properties. In other cases the protein will be an enzyme, i.e., a micro-machine that catalyses a certain reaction, such as the breakdown of a food source or toxin. Some proteins though <b>serve</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> activate other genes, {{and these are the}} transcription factors that are the main players in regulatory networks or cascades. By binding to the promoter region at the start of other genes they turn them on, initiating the production of another protein, and so on. Some transcription factors are inhibitory.|$|E
25|$|The {{locomotive}} pinions {{engage the}} rack and {{provide all the}} traction and braking effort; the wheels are free to revolve on the drive axles, {{to allow for the}} inevitable difference between the wheel radius and the effective radius of the pinion. The wheels <b>serve</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> support and guide the vehicle; if the pinion were missing, handbrake on and locomotive crank locked, the vehicle would still roll down the mountain. (The wheels are not capable of providing useful adhesion on such a gradient, so this is not the disadvantage it might seem.) The two driving axle pinions on a locomotive are mounted with a half a pitch difference between them. Combined with the half pitch difference in the two rack bars, this feature aims to make the transfer of power more continuous, and thus smooth the hauling of the train. In spite of this, the vehicles still suffer from very high levels of vibration.|$|E
25|$|General Andrew Jackson {{planned to}} drive the British from the Spanish city of Pensacola in Spanish Florida, then march to New Orleans to defend the city against any British attack. Jackson's forces had been diminished due to desertions, so Jackson was forced to wait for Brigadier-General John Coffee and his volunteers to arrive, before moving against the city. Jackson and Coffee liaised at Pierce's Stockade in Alabama. In early November Jackson {{assembled}} a force of up to 4,000 men. On November 2, he moved out towards Pensacola, reaching the city on November 6. The forces in the Anglo-Spanish fort consisted of around 100 British infantry and a coastal battery, about 500 Spanish infantry, {{an unknown number of}} British and Spanish artillery, and an unknown number of Creek warriors. Jackson first sent Major Henri Piere as a messenger under a white flag of truce to the Spanish governor, Mateo González Manrique. However, the messenger approached the city and was fired upon by the garrison in Fort San Miguel. Eventually a second messenger, this time a Spaniard, was sent through and offered the demand that after the British evacuated the forts, Americans would garrison them until relieved by Spanish troops which would <b>serve</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> ensure Spain's neutrality in the conflict, Manrique denied these demands.|$|E

25|$|In 1919, the hotelier Alexander Seiler {{applied for}} a {{concession}} for a metre gauge tramway from Visp to Brig, which, if built, would serve {{to open up the}} small settlements between the two towns. That project was terminated after the SBB stated that it would insert two halting points into its standard gauge line. As the SBB did not follow up this announcement, the concession application was resubmitted in 1925. Shortly afterwards, a committee comprising the VZ, the FO and the Lonza Group works at Visp took over the project. Under the leadership of the VZ, it was transformed into a connecting narrow gauge railway running parallel to the SBB line, was no longer equipped with any halting points, and was to <b>serve</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> link the VZ and the FO. In 1928, the committee presented a correspondingly modified concession application, which was approved on 28 September 1928, subject to a condition that one intermediate halting point be included. Following the completion of that project as approved, continuous operations from Brig to Zermatt were finally able to begin on 5 June 1930. Curiously, the opening of the new link did not lead directly to a name change for the Visp-Zermatt-Bahn. Only on 1 June 1962 was the name changed to Compagnie du Chemin de Fer de Brigue-Viège-Zermatt (Brig-Visp-Zermatt-Bahn).|$|E

Their readers, however, ranked the game {{near the bottom of}} their top 100 games for the platform. Underwurlde was later included in the 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation Rare Replay, wherein critics rated it among the worst of the 30 titles by Ultimate Play the Game and its successor, Rare. Kyle Hilliard (Game Informer) wrote that Ultimate's early games, such as Underwurlde, fared the worst in the package, though he was glad they were included.

500|$|William {{remained}} {{archbishop of}} Tyre and {{chancellor of the}} kingdom, but {{the details of his}} life at this time are obscure. The 13th-century continuators claim that Heraclius excommunicated William in 1183, but it is unknown why Heraclius would have done this. They also claim that William went to Rome to appeal to the Pope, where Heraclius had him poisoned. According to Peter Edbury and John Rowe, the obscurity of William's life during these years shows that he did not play a large political role, but concentrated on ecclesiastical affairs and the writing of his history. The story of his excommunication, and the unlikely detail that he was poisoned, were probably an invention of the Old French continuators. William remained in the kingdom and continued to write up until 1184, but by then Jerusalem was internally divided by political factions and externally surrounded by the forces of Saladin, and [...] "the only subjects that present themselves are the disasters of a sorrowing country and its manifold misfortunes, themes which can <b>serve</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> draw forth lamentations and tears." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{then moved}} on to {{addressing}} the freedom of the press, and the limits on it, arguing that freedom of speech was necessary to identify the flaws {{in the structure of the}} government and the constitution—even if the author was mistaken about those flaws. As long as a writer intended only to enlighten others, prohibiting their speech would <b>serve</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> undermine the government by harming the opportunities to improve it. While Macdonald had argued that the book was problematic because it was circulated amongst all classes of society, Erskine argued that this was not the test of whether the Rights of Man was seditious. Instead, the test was whether Paine had exclusively dealt with what he believed to be in the best interests of England, its government, and its people. While Paine's opinions ran counter to the existing system of government, Erskine argued that [...] "opinion is free and ... conduct alone is amenable to the law". For a libel claim to succeed, the Libel Act 1792 required that the prosecution show the publication was motivated by malice; as Paine had intended only to help mankind, and this was a pure motive, he could not be guilty.|$|E
