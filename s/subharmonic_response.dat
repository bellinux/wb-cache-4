Three different interfacial rheological models for the encapsulation is used with material parameters appropriate for a common lipid coated contrast agent Sonazoid. The <b>subharmonic</b> <b>response</b> is seen to either decrease, increase or vary nonmonotonically with increasing ambient pressure. Compared to a free microbubbles important differences arise due to the encapsulation. Specifically due to the enhanced damping due to encapsulation, the range of excitation over which subharmonic is seen is broader than that in free microbubbles. This results in different trends of <b>subharmonic</b> <b>response</b> at the same excitation frequency for different excitation pressures.

40|$|Variation of <b>subharmonic</b> <b>response</b> from {{contrast}} microbubbles with {{ambient pressure}} is numerically investigated for non-invasive monitoring of organ-level blood pressure. Previously, several contrast microbubbles both in vitro and in vivo registered approximately linear (5 – 15 dB) <b>subharmonic</b> <b>response</b> reduction with 188 mm Hg change in ambient pressure. In contrast, simulated <b>subharmonic</b> <b>response</b> {{from a single}} microbubble is seen here to either increase or decrease with ambient pressure. This is shown using the code BUBBLESIM for encapsulated microbubbles, and then the underlying dynamics is investigated using a free bubble model. The ratio of the excitation frequency to the natural frequency of the bubble is the determining parameter—increasing ambient pressure increases natural frequency thereby changing this ratio. For frequency ratio below a lower critical value, increasing ambient pressure monotonically decreases <b>subharmonic</b> <b>response.</b> Above an upper critical value of the same ratio, increasing ambient pressure increases subharmonic response; in between, the subharmonic variation is non-monotonic. The precise values of frequency ratio for these three different trends depend on bubble radius and excitation amplitude.

Ultrasound {{contrast}} agents (UCA) are encapsulated gas bubbles {{which are}} utilized in medical ultrasound imaging for their nonlinear scattering signatures. The <b>subharmonic</b> <b>response</b> and threshold of UCAs {{have been investigated}} at the standard diagnostic frequencies (1 - 10 MHz) and more recently, in the high frequency ultrasound regime (> 15 MHz). The optimal design for the <b>subharmonic</b> <b>response</b> of UCAs for high frequency applications is an on-going research topic. Furthermore, {{studies have shown that}} a chirp (frequency modulated) excitation significantly in-creases the subharmonic signals from UCAs. Previous studies have used a 20 dB spectral criteria for the detection of a subharmonic event. However, this may have a limitation for non-stationary, chirp excitations. The <b>subharmonic</b> <b>response</b> of UCAs from a high frequency, chirp pulse is investigated numerically and experimentally using a spectral analysis and the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method. The EMD decomposes a signal into its intrinsic mode function (IMF) in which the IMFs form an orthogonal basis of the signal. The scattered pressure signal from a mono-frequency (40 MHz) and chirp excitation (30 - 50 MHz) is calculated numerically. Subharmonic thresholds determined from the relative peak level from the power spectrum are compared to those from a novel method based on the energy ratio of the second IMF component. The instan-taneous phases and frequencies were obtained from the respective IMF components. Enhanced subharmonic responses are related to the phase locking between the fundamental and subharmonic components. A lower thresholds were found for the chirp excitations. Also, thresh-old values were compared with a previously derived theoretical expression. Limitations of the spectral threshold criteria are quantified for short, non-stationary excitations. Furthermore, these methods are implemented on the experimental data from two types of polymer UCAs (Phillips and Point Biomedical) excited by a mono-frequency (20 MHz) and linear chirp (15 - 25 MHz) pulse for incident pressures from 0. 5 MPa to 2. 4 MPa. Subharmonic thresholds of 1. 0 MPa and 2. 0 MPa for the Phillips UCA and Point Biomedical UCA, respectively, for a chirp excitation was determined. The <b>subharmonic</b> <b>response</b> of two interacting UCAs was investigated numerically. The changes in the <b>subharmonic</b> <b>response</b> are related to the phase difference between the two funda-mental responses with the EMD method.

40|$|Two {{nonlinear}} interfacial elasticity models—interfacial elasticity decreasing linearly and exponentially with area fraction—are {{developed for}} the encapsulation of contrast microbubbles. The strain softening (decreasing elasticity) results from the decreasing association between the constitutive molecules of the encapsulation. The models are used to find the characteristic properties (surface tension, interfacial elasticity, interfacial viscosity and nonlinear elasticity parameters) for a commercial contrast agent. Properties are found using the ultrasound attenuation measured through a suspension of contrast agent. Dynamics of the resulting models are simulated, compared with other existing models and discussed. Imposing non-negativity on the effective surface tension (the encapsulation experiences no net compressive stress) shows “compression-only” behavior. The exponential and the quadratic (linearly varying elasticity) models result in similar behaviors. The validity of the models is investigated by comparing their predictions of the scattered nonlinear response for the contrast agent at higher excitations against experimental measurement.

In the formulation, the coupling forces due to the nonlinearities are treated as external forces acting on the coupled subsystems. Iteration is utilized to determine their magnitudes at each time increment. The method is applied to a nonlinear generic model of the high pressure oxygen turbopump (HPOTP). As compared to the fourth order Runge-Kutta numerical integration methods, the convolution approach proved to be more accurate and more highly efficient.

40|$|The {{spontaneous}} breaking of time-translation symmetry in periodically driven quantum systems {{leads to a}} new phase of matter: discrete time crystals (DTC). This phase exhibits collective subharmonic oscillations that depend upon an interplay of non-equilibrium driving, many-body interactions, and the breakdown of ergodicity. However, <b>subharmonic</b> <b>responses</b> are also a well-known feature of classical dynamical systems ranging from predator-prey models to Faraday waves and AC-driven charge density waves. This {{raises the question of}} whether these classical phenomena display the same rigidity characteristic of a quantum DTC. In this work, we explore this question in the context of periodically driven Hamiltonian dynamics coupled to a finite-temperature bath, which provides both friction and, crucially, noise. Focusing on one-dimensional chains, where in equilibrium any transition would be forbidden at finite temperature, we provide evidence that the combination of noise and interactions drives a sharp, first-order dynamical phase transition between a discrete time-translation invariant phase and an activated classical discrete time crystal (CDTC) in which time-translation symmetry is broken out to exponentially-long time scales. Power-law correlations are present along a first-order line which terminates at a critical point. We analyze the transition by mapping it to the locked-to-sliding transition of a DC-driven charge density wave. Our work points to a classical limit for quantum time crystals, and raises several intriguing questions concerning the non-equilibrium universality class of the CDTC critical point.

40|$|Transverse {{amplitude}} {{responses of}} a circular cylinder in cross-flow were determined {{as a function}} of reduced velocities for a variety of spring constants and damping coefficients. Maxima were found at reduced velocities of 5 and 16, and were of comparable amplitude. The first resonance, designated the 2 ̆ 2 fundamental mode, 2 ̆ 2 was due to normal vortex street excitation of the spring-mass system. The second resonance, designated the 2 ̆ 2 lower mode, 2 ̆ 2 occurred when the natural frequency was approximately one-third of the normal vortex shedding frequency. By assuming that the driving force was sinusoidal, it was possible to evaluate the lift coefficients at resonance. Lift coefficients for the lower mode behaved similarly with amplitude ratio but were an order of magnitude lower than lift coefficients for the fundamental mode. A mechanism was used to oscillate the cylinder transversely at prescribed frequencies and amplitudes. Dominant wake frequencies were determined from a frequency analysis of the hot-wire signal for a range of velocities and a fixed frequency of oscillation. It was found that synchronization of the shedding frequency to the forcing frequency did not take place for the lower mode. The familiar 2 ̆ 2 lock-in 2 ̆ 2 region, or frequency synchronization over finite bandwidth, was observed for the fundamental mode only. Since the frequency associated with normal vortex shedding was not suppressed when oscillations took place in the lower mode, it would seem that a low frequency vortex street had not replaced the normal one. It is likely, then, that the spring-mounted cylinder responded subharmonically to the exciting force resulting from vortex shedding.

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 Response {{behavior}} of a nonlinear structural system subject to environmental loadings is investigated in this study. The system contains a nonlinear restoring force due to large geometric displacement. The external excitation is modeled as a narrowband stochastic process possessing dynamic characteristics of typical environmental loadings. A semi-analytical method is developed to predict the stochastic nonlinear response behavior under narrowband excitations in both the primary and the subharmonic resonance regions. Preservation of deterministic response characteristics under the narrowband random field is assumed. The stochastic system response induced by variations in the narrowband excitations is considered as a sequence of successive transient states. Due to the system nonlinearity, under a combination of excitation conditions, several response attraction domains may co-exist. Presence of co-existence of attraction domains and variations in the excitation amplitude often induce complex response inter-domain transitions. The response characteristics {{are found to be}} attraction domain dependent. Among different response attraction domains, their corresponding response amplitude domains overlap. In addition, within an individual attraction domain, response amplitude domains corresponding to different excitation amplitudes also overlap. Overlapping of response amplitude domains and the time-dependent variations in the excitation parameters induce response intra-domain transitions. Stationary Markovian assumption is employed to characterize the stochastic {{behavior of}} the response amplitude process and the excitation parameter processes. Based on the stochastic excitation properties and the deterministic response characteristics, governing equations of the response amplitude probability inter- and intra-domain transitions are formulated. Numerical techniques and an iteration procedure are employed to evaluate the stationary response amplitude probability distribution. The proposed semi-analytical method is validated by extensive numerical simulations. The capability of the method is demonstrated by good agreements among the predicted response amplitude distributions and the simulation results in both the primary and the subharmonic resonance regions. Variations in the stochastic response behavior under varying excitation bandwidth and variance are also predicted accurately. Repeated occurrences of various <b>subharmonic</b> <b>responses</b> observed in the numerical simulations are taken into account in the proposed analysis. Comparisons of prediction results with those obtained by existing analytical methods and simulation histograms show that a significant improvement in the prediction accuracy is achieved...|$|R
