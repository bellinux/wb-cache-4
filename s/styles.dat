5|$|A.J. <b>Styles</b> fought Kurt Angle in a Last Man Standing match next. In a Last Man Standing match, {{there are}} no {{disqualifications}} or count outs, instead to win the match the competitor has to force their opponent to {{not be able to}} reach a standing position by the count of 10. However, this match was only promoted as a Last Man Standing match, instead it was held under Texas Death match rules where a wrestler must pin or submit their opponent and then have them fail to respond to a count of 10. <b>Styles</b> got the first fall of the night, when he forced Angle to tap out to Angle's own signature submission maneuver the Ankle lock. Angle made it to his feet before the count concluded. Angle gained a pinfall later on in the match after slamming <b>Styles</b> off the top of a padded turnbuckle with a suplex. Before <b>Styles</b> could reach his feet to beat the count, Angle slammed <b>Styles</b> onto the mat back-first with his signature Olympic slam maneuver and gained another pinfall to start the count over. <b>Styles</b> beat that count as well, with Angle trying for the Olympic Slam again before Styles' countered it into his signature Styles' Clash maneuver and pinned Angle. After Angle reached his feet, <b>Styles</b> and Angle fought up a padded turnbuckle with <b>Styles</b> gaining the advantage. At this time, <b>Styles</b> grabbed Angle by the neck and fell backwards from the turnbuckle and drove Angle head-first into the mat. Angle failed to reach the 10 count afterwards, with <b>Styles</b> being declared the winner of the contest at 24 minutes and 50 seconds. Following the encounter, the referee called for medical attention for Angle who was scripted to appear as if he had suffered a neck injury. <b>Styles</b> then entered the ring once Angle reached his feet and lifted Angle up and dropped him on his head. As <b>Styles</b> walked up the ramp, he was attacked by Sting, who drove Styles' head into the ramp with his signature Scorpion Death Drop maneuver, as Kevin Nash looked on.|$|E
5|$|A.J. <b>Styles</b> fought Kurt Angle in {{the sixth}} {{encounter}} of the show next. The match lasted 22 minutes and 44 seconds. Angle was accompanied by Tomko to the ring. The referee forced Tomko {{to head to the}} backstage area due to the referee believing he would interfere. <b>Styles</b> attempted to perform his signature <b>Styles</b> Clash maneuver on Angle, which Angle countered into his signature Ankle Lock submission hold. <b>Styles</b> escaped the hold, causing Angle to crash into the referee, knocking him out in the storyline. Karen Angle then ran down to the ringside area and attempted to hand Angle a steel chair. Once Angle grabbed the chair she refused to release, allowing <b>Styles</b> to grab Angle and perform the <b>Styles</b> Clash by slamming Angle face-first into the mat. <b>Styles</b> then followed with the pin attempt to win the contest. After the encounter, Angle and Tomko assaulted <b>Styles.</b>|$|E

This was a rematch between the two that took place at Against All Odds. Other events that lead to this match included the 2005 TNA Super X Cup Tournament, which caused the Three Way match at Unbreakable, and Daniels defeating <b>Styles</b> in an Ultimate X Challenge match at TNA's Destination X PPV event on March13 to become champion. On the October8 episode of Impact!, Daniels issued a challenge to <b>Styles</b> to pick three wrestlers on the roster and he would defeat {{all of them in}} fifteen minutes or less. <b>Styles</b> accepted the challenge and chose Shark Boy, Sonjay Dutt, and himself.

He was confronted by AJ <b>Styles,</b> only to be betrayed by <b>Styles,</b> who joined his former Club teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson in attacking Cena. This set up a match between Cena and <b>Styles</b> at Money in the Bank, which <b>Styles</b> won with interference from Gallows and Anderson. On the July 4 episode of Raw, Cena was again attacked by the Club, but was saved by Enzo Amore and Big Cass. Subsequently, a six-man tag team match was made between the two teams for Battleground. On July 19 at the 2016 WWE draft, Cena was drafted to the SmackDown brand, while also defeating Club member Luke Gallows via pinfall in a singles contest. Cena, Amore and Cass defeated The Club at Battleground after Cena pinned <b>Styles.</b> Cena continued his feud with <b>Styles,</b> which resulted in him losing their match at SummerSlam on August 21. With <b>Styles</b> later winning the renamed WWE World Championship, Cena challenged him and previous champion Dean Ambrose in a triple threat match for the title at No Mercy. He lost the match after being pinned by <b>Styles,</b> which came after Ambrose and Cena simultaneously made <b>Styles</b> submit, therefore restarting the match.

Cage was neutral in the storyline, due to not having revealed which side he had aligned with. This upset <b>Styles</b> in the storyline, who wanted Cage {{to join the}} younger wrestlers. On the September25 episode of Impact!, <b>Styles</b> fought Booker T in a standard match. Booker T won the bout after bashing <b>Styles</b> {{in the head with}} a steel briefcase. <b>Styles</b> blamed the loss on Cage, who had interfered in the bout and accidentally cost <b>Styles</b> the win due to a miscommunication.
