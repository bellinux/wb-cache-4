40|$|We {{present an}} {{intuitive}} {{way to create}} dynamic motions for physically simulated, skeleton-driven deformable characters. The motion of the character is guided by the user interactively through Cartesian space control and a combination of <b>setpoint</b> <b>selection.</b> To make direct manipulation of a physically simulated character intuitive, we present a novel approach to Cartesian space control, in which the user may directly drive the accelerations or velocities of bones in the character using mouse drags and scripted constraints. To facilitate direct user control, we must solve the fully nonlinear equations of motion at speeds close to real-time. To achieve this fast computation speed, we model the deformable body as a coarse mesh having an embedded fine surface and apply a geometric recursive dynamics algorithm for fast computation and analytic differentiation. These techniques are not sufficient for good performance, however. We present an improved diagonalization method to efficiently handle mesh elements with large deformation {{and a number of}} other optimizations that allow us to achieve simulation speeds that approach real-time...|$|E
40|$|Multihead {{weighing}} {{machines are}} ubiquitous in industry for fast and accurate packaging {{of a wide}} variety of foods and vegetables, small hardware items and office supplies. These machines consist of a system of multiple hoppers that are filled with product which when discharged through a funnel fills a package to a desired weight. Operating the machine requires first to specify the product weight targets or setpoints that each hopper should contain on average in each cycle, which do not need to be identical. The <b>setpoints</b> <b>selection</b> has a major impact on the performance of a multihead weighing machine. Each cycle, the machine fills a package running a built-in knapsack algorithm that opens – or leaves shut – different combinations of hoppers releasing their content such that the total package weight is near to its target, minimizing the amount of product “given away”. In this paper, we address the open problem for industry of how to determine the setpoint weights for each of the hoppers before starting up the machine, given a desired total package weight. An order statistic formulation based on a characterization of near-optimal solutions is presented. This is shown to be computationally intractable, and a faster heuristic that utilizes a lower bound approximation of the expected smallest order statistic is proposed instead. The solutions obtained with the proposed methods can result in substantial savings for users of multihead weighing machines. Alternatively, the analysis presented could be used by management to justify the acquisition of new machines of this type...|$|R
40|$|Increased {{competition}} in the process industries requires optimal operation and better utilization of raw materials and energy. One strategy for achieving improved production is to use real-time optimization (RTO), based on measured disturbances and process measurements. The optimal solution is usually implemented by updating setpoints to the control system which task {{is to keep the}} controlled variables at the <b>setpoint.</b> Thus, the <b>selection</b> of controlled variables integrates the optimization and the control layer. Selecting the right controlled variables can be of paramount importance. Many chemical processes are influenced by disturbances that are often not measured and where installing new measurements are not economically viable. Thus, finding controlled variables where the optimal value is insensitive to disturbances could eliminate the need of estimating these disturbances online and would reduce the need of frequent setpoint updates. The use of feedback control introduces implementation errors. It is important to select controlled variables that are insensitive to implementation errors. The "optimal" implementation would be to use a dynamic optimizer which, based on full information of the disturbances and the plant outputs, calculates the optimal inputs. In practice, control systems have a hierarchical structure, where different layers operate on different time scales. Thus, the selection of controlled variables (which links these layers together) is important. The ideal situation is to have self-optimizing controlled variables where operation remains near-optimal in presence of disturbances and implementation errors using constant setpoints. This work puts emphasis on methods for selecting such self-optimizing controlled variables. We base the selection of controlled variables on an economic measure of the operation. We assume that the setpoints are nominally optimal, and we propose the null space method for selecting controlled variables as a combination of measurements. The selection of the controlled variables is based on the optimal sensitivity matrix from the disturbances to the measurements. This information can easily be provided by using experiments or a model of the plant. The main focus, is to find controlled variables that yield good self-optimizing properties with respect to disturbances. The method uses local information, however, several case {{studies have shown that the}} operation is near-optimal in a wider region of the disturbance space. To generalize the null space method, we propose a method for selecting measurements that minimizes the effect of implementation errors on the economic performance for the resulting control structure. Based on the derivation of the null space method, we propose a simple procedure for finding controlled variables using the null space method. The procedure is split in two: First, we select measurements that are insensitive to measurement error. Second, we combine these measurements to form the self-optimizing control structure. Further, we discuss how non-optimal nominal points affect the selection of controlled variables for self-optimizing control. We find that the selection of controlled variables is unaffected by non-optimal nominal points, and that the average increase in loss is independent of what we select to control. Another contribution is to provide several case studies where the null space method is compared with previously proposed methods for selecting controlled variables. The null space method is illustrated on a Petlyuk distillation column for separation of ternary mixtures. We find that the null space method yields a control structure with acceptable steady-state and dynamic performance. Other cases studied are an evaporator process and oil and gas production networks. Finally, we show that for the Petlyuk distillation column it is energetically optimal to over-fractionate one of the products. This surprising result is discussed and expressions for the possible savings are derived. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} pertinent design {{practices of}} selecting types of monitors, monitor unit placement, <b>setpoint</b> <b>selection,</b> and maintenance considerations for gas monitors. While hydrogen gas monitors and enriched oxygen atmosphere monitors {{as they would}} be needed for hydrogen production experiments are {{the primary focus of}} this paper, monitors for carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are also discussed. The experiences of designing, installing, and calibrating gas monitors for a laboratory where experiments in support of the DOE Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative (NHI) are described along with codes, standards, and regulations for these monitors. Information from the literature about best operating practices is also presented. The NHI program has two types of activities. The first, near-term activity is laboratory and pilot-plant experimentation with different processes in the kilogram per day scale to select the most promising types of processes for future applications of hydrogen production. Prudent design calls for indoor gas monitors to sense any hydrogen leaks within these laboratory rooms. The second, longer-term activity is the prototype, or large-scale plants to produce tons of hydrogen per day. These large, outdoor production plants will require area (or “fencepost”) monitoring of hydrogen gas leaks. Some processes will have oxygen production with hydrogen production, and any oxygen releases are also safety concerns since oxygen gas is the strongest oxidizer. Monitoring of these gases is important for personnel safety of both indoor and outdoor experiments. There is some guidance available about proper placement of monitors. The fixed point, stationary monitor can only function if the intruding gas contacts the monitor. Therefore, monitor placement is vital to proper monitoring of the room or area. Factors in sensor location selection include: indoor or outdoor site, the location and nature of potential vapor/gas sources, chemical and physical data of the gases or vapors, liquids with volatility need sensors near the potential sources of release, nature and concentration of gas releases, natural and mechanical ventilation, detector installation locations not vulnerable to mechanical or water damage from normal operations, and locations that lend themselves to convenient maintenance and calibration. The guidance also states that sensors should be located in all areas where hazardous accumulations of gas may occur. Such areas might not be close to release points but might be areas with restricted air movement. Heavier than air gases are likely to accumulate in pits, trenches, drains, and other low areas. Lighter than air gases are more likely to accumulate in overhead spaces, above drop ceilings, etc. In general, sensors should be located close to any potential sources of major release of gas. The paper gives data on monitor sensitivity and expected lifetimes to support the monitor selection process. Proper selection of indoor and outdoor locations for monitors is described, accounting for the vapor densities of hydrogen and oxygen. The latest information on monitor alarm <b>setpoint</b> <b>selection</b> is presented. Typically, monitors require recalibration at least every six months, or more frequently for inhospitable locations, so ready access to the monitors is an important issue to consider in monitor siting. Gas monitors, depending on their type, can be susceptible to blockages of the detector element (i. e., du...|$|E
