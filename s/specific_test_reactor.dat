40|$|Beryllium, due to {{its unique}} {{combination}} of structural, chemical, atomic number, and neutron absorption cross section characteristics, has been used successfully as a neutron reflector for three generations of nuclear <b>test</b> <b>reactors</b> at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). The Advanced Test Reactor (ATR), the largest <b>test</b> <b>reactor</b> in the world, has utilized five successive beryllium neutron reflectors and is scheduled for continued operation with a sixth beryllium reflector. A high radiation environment in a <b>test</b> <b>reactor</b> produces radiation damage and other changes in beryllium. These changes necessitate safety analysis of the beryllium, methods to predict performance, and appropriate surveillances. Other nuclear applications also utilize beryllium. Beryllium, given its unique atomic, physical, and chemical characteristics, is widely used as a “window” for x-rays and gamma rays. Beryllium, intimately mixed with high-energy alpha radiation emitters has been successfully used to produce neutron sources. This paper addresses operational experience and methodologies {{associated with the use}} of beryllium in nuclear <b>test</b> <b>reactors</b> and in “windows” for x-rays and gamma rays.

40|$|Five {{different}} combinations of Hydraulic Retention Times (HRT) and temperatures were used in a two stage (feed and <b>test</b> <b>reactor)</b> Autothermal Thermophilic Aerobic Digestion System {{to assess the impact}} of these parameters on the production of odorous gases. The gases monitored were hydrogen sulphide, dimethyl sulphide, methyl mercaptan, ammonia, and amines. Other liquid parameters were also monitored in order to better understand the impacts of temperature and HRT. These parameters are total solids content, volatile solids content, volatile solids destruction, specific oxygen uptake rate, alkalinity, ammonia concentration, and pH. In order to assess the character of the sludge and understand the digestion process the carbohydrate, fat, and protein content were also measured in the inputs and in the <b>test</b> <b>reactor.</b> It was found that all of the odorous compounds measured were affected by stage of digestion and temperature more than by HRT.

40|$|High-rate {{anaerobic}} digestion of organic solids requires rapid hydrolysis and enhanced methanogenic growth rates, {{which can be}} achieved through elevated temperature (> 55 °C) at short hydraulic retention times (HRT). This study assesses the effect of temperatures between 55 °C and 65 °C and HRTs between 2 and 4 days on process performance, microbial community structure, microbial capability, and acetotrophic pathways in thermophilic anaerobic reactors. Increasing the temperature did not enhance volatile solids (VS) destruction above the base value of 37 % achieved at 55 °C and 4 days HRT. Stable isotopic signatures (δ 13 C) revealed that elevated temperature promoted syntrophic acetate oxidation, which accounted for 60 % of the methane formation at 55 °C, and increasing substantially to 100 % at 65 °C. The acetate consumption capacity dropped with increasing temperature (from 0. 69 - 0. 81 gCOD gVS- 1 d- 1 at 55 °C to 0. 21 - 0. 35 gCOD gVS- 1 d- 1 at 65 °C), based on <b>specific</b> activity <b>testing</b> of <b>reactor</b> contents. Community analysis using 16 S rRNA pyrosequencing revealed the dominance of Methanosarcina at 55 - 60 °C. However, a further increase to 65 °C resulted in loss of Methanosarcina, with an accumulation of organic acids and reduced methane production. Similar issues were observed when reducing the HRT to 2 days, indicating that temperature 3 days are critical to operate these systems stably...|$|R

40|$|Environmental {{and health}} impacts are {{presented}} for activities associated with transient testing of nuclear fuel and material using two candidate <b>test</b> <b>reactors.</b> Transient <b>testing</b> involves irradiation of nuclear fuel or materials for short time-periods under high neutron flux rates. The transient testing process includes transportation of nuclear fuel or materials inside a robust shipping cask to a hot cell, removal from the shipping cask, pre-irradiation {{examination of the}} nuclear materials, assembly of an experiment assembly, transportation of the experiment assembly to the <b>test</b> <b>reactor,</b> irradiation in the <b>test</b> <b>reactor,</b> transport back to the hot cell, and post-irradiation examination of the nuclear fuel or material.
