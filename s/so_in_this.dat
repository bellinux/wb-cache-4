5|$|Hirschman {{also stated}} that during {{conditions}} of slack activity in developed countries, the stock of resources, machines and entrepreneurs are merely unemployed, and are present as idle capacity. <b>So</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> situation, simultaneous investment in {{a large number of}} sectors is a well-suited policy. The various economic agents are temporarily unemployed and once the inducement to invest starts operating, the slump will be overcome. However, for an underdeveloped economy, where such resources are absent, this principle doesn't fit.|$|E
5|$|In Goddess-oriented worship, Vimala (Bimala) is {{regarded}} as the presiding goddess of the Purushottama (Puri) Shakti Pitha. Jagannath, a form of the god Vishnu/Krishna (Krishna is generally regarded as an avatar of Vishnu), is worshipped as the Pitha's Bhairava. This is a departure from the usual tradition of Bhairava as a form of Shiva. <b>So,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> temple complex, Vishnu–one of the Hindu trinity–is equated with Shiva, another of the trinity; this is interpreted to convey the oneness of God. In this regard, Vimala - generally associated with Shiva's consort - is also considered as Lakshmi, the consort of Vishnu. Conversely, Tantrics consider Jagannath as Shiva-Bhairava, rather than a form of Vishnu.|$|E
5|$|We {{consider}} {{the surface area}} of the entire mass of mercury, including {{the part of the}} surface that is in contact with the glass, because mercury does not adhere to glass at all. So the surface tension of the mercury acts over its entire surface area, including where it is in contact with the glass. If instead of glass, the tube was made out of copper, the situation would be very different. Mercury aggressively adheres to copper. So in a copper tube, the level of mercury {{at the center of the}} tube will be lower than at the edges (that is, it would be a concave meniscus). In a situation where the liquid adheres to the walls of its container, we {{consider the}} part of the fluid's surface area that is in contact with the container to have negative surface tension. The fluid then works to maximize the contact surface area. <b>So</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case increasing the area in contact with the container decreases rather than increases the potential energy. That decrease is enough to compensate for the increased potential energy associated with lifting the fluid near the walls of the container.|$|E

25|$|In one direction, {{this result}} is {{straightforward}} to prove: if X does not include at least one forest, then the X-minor-free graphs do not have bounded pathwidth. For, in this case, the X-minor-free graphs include all forests, and in particular they include the perfect binary trees. But a perfect binary tree with 2k+1 levels has pathwidth k, <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case the X-minor-free-graphs have unbounded pathwidth. In the other direction, if X contains an n-vertex forest, then the X-minor-free graphs have pathwidth at most n−2.|$|E
25|$|Link grammar {{is based}} on the {{dependency}} relation, but link grammar does not include directionality in the dependencies between words, and thus does not describe head-dependent relationships.

25|$|Harmonic {{functions}} {{that arise in}} physics are determined by their singularities and boundary conditions (such as Dirichlet boundary conditions or Neumann boundary conditions). On regions without boundaries, adding the real or imaginary part of any entire function will produce a harmonic function with the same singularity, <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case the harmonic function is not determined by its singularities; however, {{we can make the}} solution unique in physical situations by requiring that the solution goes to 0 as you go to infinity. In this case, uniqueness follows by Liouville's theorem.|$|E
25|$|A {{locomotive}} {{may sometimes}} have the fifth letter {{in its name}} which denotes a technical variant or subclass or subtype. This fifth letter indicates some smaller variation in the basic model or series, perhaps different motors, or a different manufacturer. With the new scheme for classifying diesel locomotives (as mentioned above) the fifth item is a letter that further refines the horsepower indication in 100hp increments: 'A' for 100hp, 'B' for 200hp, 'C' for 300hp, etc. <b>So</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> scheme, a WDM-3A refers to a 3100hp loco, while a WDM-3D would be a 3400hp loco and WDM-3F would be 3600hp loco.|$|E
25|$|If the point, A {{had been}} chosen {{to the right of}} the {{azeotrope}} rather than to the left, the distillate at point C would be farther to the right than A, which is to say that the distillate would be richer in X and poorer in Y than the original mixture. <b>So</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case too, the distillate moves away from the azeotrope and the residue moves toward it. This is characteristic of negative azeotropes. No amount of distillation, however, can make either the distillate or the residue arrive on the opposite side of the azeotrope from the original mixture. This is characteristic of all azeotropes.|$|E

25|$|In {{the common}} case when V is a {{positive}} or negative definite space over the reals, the spin group maps onto the special orthogonal group, and is simply connected when V has dimension at least 3. Further the kernel of this homomorphism consists of 1 and −1. <b>So</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case the spin group, Spin(n), is a double cover of SO(n). Please note, however, that the simple connectedness of the spin group is not true in general: if V is Rp,q for p and q both at least 2 then the spin group is not simply connected. In this case the algebraic group Spinp,q is simply connected as an algebraic group, even though its group of real valued points Spinp,q(R) is not simply connected. This is a rather subtle point, which completely confused the authors {{of at least one}} standard book about spin groups.|$|E
25|$|Inigo Jones {{had brought}} the {{classical}} renaissance style to England in the early 17th century. His followers took the new classical style into the country, characterised by its symmetry and proportion and such classical elements as pilasters, while wide eaves took {{the place of a}} cornice. Often a bricklayer would also be the principal contractor, controlling the other trades, and he could avoid the necessity to employ a mason for stonework if he could produce the classical elements in brick. <b>So</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> house we have brick pilasters, one above the other, with capitals and bases shaped in brickwork. The rebuilding seems to have been carried out in two stages, though without a long gap between them. There is a straight joint in the brickwork {{to the left of the}} second pilaster on the north side. In front of this the bricks are laid in English bond, but Flemish bond is used towards the back, indicating that this part was built a little later.|$|E
