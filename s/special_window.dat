6000|$|If {{there had}} been quarrels in our little colonial society when I left home, what were these to the feuds I found raging on my return? We had sent the Stamp Act to America, and been forced to repeal it. Then we must try {{a new set of}} duties on glass, paper, and what not, and repeal that Act too, with the {{exception}} of a duty on tea. From Boston to Charleston the tea was confiscated. Even my mother, loyal as she was, gave up her favourite drink; and my poor wife would have had to forgo hers, but we had brought a quantity for our private drinking on board ship, which had paid four times as much duty at home. Not that I for my part would have hesitated about paying duty. The home Government must have some means of revenue, or its pretensions to authority were idle. They say the colonies were tried and tyrannised over; I say the home Government was tried and tyrannised over. ('Tis but an affair of argument and history, now; we tried the question, and were beat; and the matter is settled as completely as the conquest of Britain by the Normans.) And all along, from conviction I trust, I own to have taken the British side of the quarrel. In that brief and unfortunate experience of war which I had had in my early life, the universal cry of the army and well-affected persons was, that Mr. Braddock's expedition had failed, and defeat and disaster had fallen upon us in consequence of the remissness, the selfishness, and the rapacity of many of the very people for whose defence against the French arms had been taken up. The colonists were for having all done for them, and for doing nothing, They made extortionate bargains with the champions who came to defend them; they failed in contracts; they furnished niggardly supplies; they multiplied delays until the hour for beneficial action was past, and until the catastrophe came which never need have occurred but for their ill-will. What shouts of joy were there, and what ovations for the great British Minister who had devised and effected the conquest of Canada! Monsieur de Vaudreuil said justly that that conquest was the signal for the defection of the North American colonies from their allegiance to Great Britain; and my Lord Chatham, having done his best to achieve the first part of the scheme, contributed more than any man in England towards the completion of it. The colonies were insurgent, and he applauded their rebellion. What scores of thousands of waverers must he have encouraged into resistance! It was a general who says to an army in revolt, [...] "God save the king! My men, you have a right to mutiny!" [...] No wonder they set up his statue in this town, and his picture in t'other; whilst here and there they hanged Ministers and Governors in effigy. To our Virginian town of Williamsburg, some wiseacres must subscribe to bring over a portrait of my lord, in the habit of a Roman orator speaking in the Forum, to be sure, and pointing to the palace of Whitehall, and the <b>special</b> <b>window</b> out of which Charles I. was beheaded! Here was a neat allegory, and a pretty compliment to a British statesman! I hear, however, that my lord's head was painted from a bust, and so was taken off without his knowledge.|$|E

30|$|The FAC {{algorithm}} {{is one of}} the key technologies in USAC, which enables the successful combination of two different types of codecs, especially at transition frames. To remove the aliasing terms caused by cascading different types of codecs, FAC additionally generates the aliasing cancellation signals, and then they are quantized and transmitted to the decoder. In the earlier version of USAC that had not introduced the FAC technique, the frame boundary of transition frame was variable; thus, a <b>special</b> <b>windowing</b> operation was needed for compensating the aliased signal in the overlap region. Although FAC somewhat solves the problem, it still requires additional bits.|$|R

50|$|A client {{can request}} the {{creation}} of a window. More precisely, it can request {{the creation of}} a subwindow of an existing window. As a result, the windows created by clients are arranged in a tree (a hierarchy). The root of this tree is the root window, which is a <b>special</b> <b>window</b> created automatically by the server at startup. All other windows are directly or indirectly subwindows of the root window. The top-level windows are the direct subwindows of the root window. Visibly, the root window is as large as the virtual desktop, and lies behind all other windows. The content of a window is not always guaranteed to be preserved over time. In particular, the window content may be destroyed when the window is moved, resized, covered by other windows, and in general made totally or partly non-visible. In particular, content is lost if the X server is not maintaining a backing store of the window content. The client can request backing store for a window to be maintained, but there is no obligation for the server to do so. Therefore, clients cannot assume that backing store is maintained. If a visible part of a window has an unspecified content, an event is sent to notify the client that the window content has to be drawn again.|$|E
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of the inverse filter to noise is often {{thought to be the}} reason that inverse fllter restorations of motion-blurred images are normally dominated by errors. In this paper, we show that {{even in the absence of}} noise, there is a large error component, called the edge error, that arises due to the fact that real images seldom have the periodicity implicitly assumed by discrete Fourier transform operation. An analysis shows that the edge error has a triangular-wave structure with an amplitude proportional to the difference between the average pixel intensity levels of the left and right edges of the image. For the central region of an image, the edge error may be reduced by using Wiener filtering instead of inverse filtering. However, the restored images show reduced reso-lution as well as ghosting and ringing effects. We also derive mathematically a <b>special</b> <b>window</b> for treatment of the edge error. A sign&ant improvement in the quality of restorations is achieved with the use of this <b>special</b> <b>window.</b> The best restorations are obtained by subjecting the windowed-blurred image to a Wie-ner filter of large signal-to-noise ratio. 8 1591 Academic press, hf.
