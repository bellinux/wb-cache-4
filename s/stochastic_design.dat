It depends on the kinds of bulky waste to dispose them. This study extends the research about the <b>stochastic</b> network <b>design</b> of bulky waste recovery by [1]. Because this problem is NP-hard, this study develops a meta-heuristic algorithm based on harmony search to solve it. Several numerical examples are utilized to demonstrate the validness of the developed algorithm. The parameter analysis of this harmony search-based algorithm is done to increase the quality and the speed of searching processes. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is performed to understand the influence of different parameters on the <b>stochastic</b> network <b>design</b> problem.

40|$|Structural design {{generated}} by traditional method, optimization method and the <b>stochastic</b> <b>design</b> concept are compared. In the traditional method, the constraints are manipulated {{to obtain the}} design and weight is back calculated. In design optimization, {{the weight of a}} structure becomes the merit function with constraints imposed on failure modes and an optimization algorithm is used to generate the solution. <b>Stochastic</b> <b>design</b> concept accounts for uncertainties in loads, material properties, and other parameters and solution is obtained by solving a design optimization problem for a specified reliability. Acceptable solutions were produced by all the three methods. The variation in the weight calculated by the methods was modest. Some variation was noticed in designs calculated by the methods. The variation may be attributed to structural indeterminacy. It is prudent to develop design by all three methods prior to its fabrication. The traditional design method can be improved when the simplified sensitivities of the behavior constraint is used. Such sensitivity can reduce design calculations and may have a potential to unify the traditional and optimization methods. Weight versus reliabilitytraced out an inverted-S-shaped graph. The center of the graph corresponded to mean valued design. A heavy design with weight approaching infinity could be produced for a near-zero rate of failure.

The suspension system {{is one of the}} most important components of vehicle, which directly affects the safety, performance, noise level and style of it. The objectives of this study are to characterise the dynamic behavior, to investigate the influencing factors of lower suspension arm using FEM incorporating design of experiment (DOE) and artificial neural network (ANN) approach and to analysis the lower suspension arm using robust design method. The structural three-dimensional solid modeling of lower arm was developed using the Solidworks computer-aided drawing software. The three-dimensional solid model then imported to the MSC. PATRAN software and employed to generate meshes and defined material properties for the finite element modeling. The linear elastic analysis was performed using NASTRAN codes. The optimization of lower suspension arm were carried out using <b>stochastic</b> <b>design</b> improvement based on Monte Carlo approach, Response surface methodology (RSM) based on central composite design (CCD) and artificial intelligent technique based on radial basis function neural network (RBFNN). Tetrahedral element with 10 nodes (TET 10) and tetrahedral element with 4 nodes (TET 4) mesh were used in the stress analysis. The modal analysis was performed with using Lanczos method to investigate the eigenvalue and mode shape. The highest von Mises stresses of TET 10 were selected for the robust design parameter. The development from the <b>Stochastic</b> <b>Design</b> Improvement (SDI), RSM and ANN are obtained. The design capability to endure highest load with lower predicted stress is identified through the SDI process.

It can be seen that the robust design was capable to optimize the lower vehicle arm by using stochastic optimization and artificial intelligent techniques. The developed linear model based on SDI and CCD is statistically adequate and can be used to navigate the design space. A new parameter of material can be reconsidered in order to optimize the design. The results can significantly reduce the cost and time to market, improve product reliability and customer confidence.

40|$|International audienceIn recent years, {{shrinking}} size in {{integrated circuits}} has imposed {{a big challenge}} in maintaining the reliability in conventional computing. Stochastic computing {{has been seen as}} a reliable, low-cost, and low-power alternative to overcome such issues. Stochastic Computing (SC) computes data in the form of bit streams of 1 s and 0 s. Therefore, SC outperforms conventional computing in terms of tolerance to soft error and uncertainty at the cost of increased computational time. Stochastic Computing with uncorrelated input streams requires streams to be highly independent for better accuracy. This results in more hardware consumption for conversion of binary numbers to stochastic streams. Correlation can be used to <b>design</b> <b>Stochastic</b> Computation Elements (SCE) with correlated input streams. These designs have higher accuracy and less hardware consumption. In this paper, we propose new SC designs to implement image processing algorithms with correlated input streams. Experimental results of proposed SC with correlated input streams show on average 37 % improvement in accuracy with reduction of 50 - 90 % in area and 20 - 85 % in delay over existing <b>stochastic</b> <b>designs...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{knowledge}} about a planned system in engineering design applications is never complete. Often, a probabilistic quantification {{of the uncertainty}} arising from this missing information is warranted in order to efficiently incorporate our partial {{knowledge about}} the system and its environment into their respective models. This leads to a robust <b>stochastic</b> <b>design</b> framework where probabilistic models of excitation uncertainties and system modeling uncertainties can be introduced; the design objective is then typically related to the expected value of a system performance measure, such as reliability or expected life-cycle cost. For complex system models, this expected value can rarely be evaluated analytically {{and so it is}} often calculated using stochastic simulation techniques, which involve an estimation error and significant computational cost. An efficient framework, consisting of two stages, is presented here for the optimization in such robust <b>stochastic</b> <b>design</b> problems. The first stage implements a novel approach, called stochastic subset optimization (SSO), for iteratively identifying a subset of the original design space that has high plausibility of containing the optimal design variables. The second stage adopts some other stochastic optimization algorithm to pinpoint the optimal design variables within that subset. The focus is primarily on the theory and implementation issues for SSO but also on topics related to the combination of the two different stages for overall enhanced efficiency. An illustrative example is presented that shows the efficiency of the proposed methodology; it considers the optimization of the reliability of a base-isolated structure considering future near-fault ground motions...|$|E
