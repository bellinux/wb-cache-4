500|$|While the {{majority}} of the critics gave [...] "Lord Snow" [...] a positive review, many suggested that it suffered from having to introduce many new characters and locations. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes surveyed 10 reviews of the episode and judged 80% of them to be positive with an average score of 8.75 out of 10. The website's critical consensus reads, [...] "'Lord Snow' is an intriguing and heavy transitional episode with standout performances from Bean and Gillen, though it would be better served with more focus on character change and development." [...] Myles McNutt wrote at Cultural Learnings that it was [...] "perhaps the most narratively uninteresting episode of the first six," [...] although he highlighted that it was [...] "hardly a bad episode of television, filled as it is with satisfying sequences that capture many themes key to the series," [...] and added that many issues introduced in this episode had a payoff in future installments. Entertainment Weekly James Hibberd also thought that it was his least favorite episode of the first six, due to too much character development. However, Alan Sepinwall from HitFix, liked the [...] "more rambling quality of 'Lord Snow,' and while admitting it is heavy on exposition he felt it worked [...] "because the stories are being told with such passion." [...] IGN's Matt Fowler wrote that [...] "Lord Snow" [...] was [...] "dense and filled with tons of exposition and backstory, {{which may or may not}} have interested those new to this story - but I found myself hanging on every precious word." [...] Alan Sepinwall wrote a positive review of the episode for HitFix, saying [...] "Arya's fencing lesson is a wonderful scene, carried by the joy of Maisie Williams' performance and the playful, Inigo Montoya-ish quality of her new teacher Syrio, but it's also such a small, <b>simple</b> <b>thing</b> that you wouldn't ordinarily expect it to be the note that an episode of dramatic television goes out on" [...] and continued [...] "I liked the looser, more rambling quality of [...] "Lord Snow," [...] an episode largely about transitions, fish out of water, and old ghosts.|$|E
2500|$|The {{whole book}} {{is a mixture of}} Hellenism and Hebraism, in which the same method of allegory is applied to Homer and Hesiod as to Moses. Starting from the {{assertion}} of Moses that God is [...] "a devouring fire" [...] (Deuteronomy 4:24), Simon combined therewith the philosophy of Heraclitus which made fire the first principle of all things. This first principle he denominated a [...] "Boundless Power," [...] and he declared it to dwell in the sons of men, beings born of flesh and blood. But fire was not the <b>simple</b> <b>thing</b> that the many imagined, and Simon distinguished between its hidden and its manifest qualities, maintaining that the former were the cause of the latter. Like the Stoics he conceived of it as an intelligent being. From this ungenerated being sprang the generated world of which we know, whereof there were six roots, having each its inner and its outer side, and arranged as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{only reason}} that Angel didn't come back...it's a very <b>simple</b> <b>thing.</b> Because our ratings were up, because of our {{critical}} attention, Joss specifically asked Jordan Levin, who {{was the head of}} The WB at the time, to give us an early pick-up because every year they [...] wait so long to give Angel a pick-up [...] a lot of us [...] turn down jobs hoping that Angel will continue– he [...] didn't want that to happen. So, he was feeling very confident and he [...] just asked Jordan, [...] "Like, make your decision now whether you're going to pick us up or not," [...] and Jordan, sort of with his hands tied, with his back up against the wall, called him the next day and said, [...] "Okay, we're cancelling you." [...] Jordan's no longer there and The WB has since recognized...I believe Garth Ancier at The WB said that it was a big mistake to cancel Angel. There was a power play that happened that just didn't fall out the way they wanted it to. We wanted to get an early pick-up, we didn't. In fact we forced them [...] to make a decision, and with his hand forced he [...] made the decision to cancel us.|$|E

2500|$|I became {{terrified that}} I {{was going to}} be a full-time, bomb-throwing {{terrorist}} if I stayed [...] because it was the beginning of really bad times in America. It was '66–'67, it was the first police riot in Los Angeles.... In college my major was political science, so my brain worked that way.... And I drove around this little English Hillman Minx—top down—and every night I'd be hauled over by the cops. Up against the wall, and all this stuff. They had this monologue with me; it was never a dialogue. It was that I was a long-haired drug addict living off some rich guy's foolish daughter. And I said, [...] "No, I work in advertising. I make twice as much as you do." [...] Which is a stupid thing to say to a cop....And it was like an epiphany. I suddenly felt what it was like to be a black or Mexican kid living in L.A. Before that, I thought I knew what the world was like, I thought I knew what poor people were, and then suddenly it all changed because of that <b>simple</b> <b>thing</b> of being brutalized by cops. And I got more and more angry and I just felt, I've got to get out of here—I'm a better cartoonist than I am a bomb maker. That's why so much of the U.S. is still standing.|$|E
2500|$|... “The old days. [...] After all {{the fall}} of 1906 is a far piece back, and high school {{football}} then was a mighty casual and <b>simple</b> <b>thing.</b> [...] That was my senior year and I was a ‘new boy’, having just moved to Massillon that summer from the wide open spaces of South Dakota, Wyoming and Nebraska. [...] The first day at school several of my classmates came around to suggest that of course I was coming out for football; and although I protested that I {{had never had a}} ball in my hands, they countered with the argument that I was a good sized lump of a boy and would make a fine prospect. [...] So I promised. [...] Well the only preparation necessary was to take an old pair of shoes down to the town cobbler and have some cleats nailed on them. [...] I think the athletic association must have had some football pants, but I do remember distinctly that you had to furnish your own stockings (any color) and an old sweater. [...] Put these on and you were in business. [...] I can’t believe that there were more than 11 candidates out because I made the team the first afternoon. [...] Nor did we have a regular coach. [...] A boy named Fritz Merwin, who I think had played the year before was our coach. [...] If you ask me, he’s the one whose picture ought to be hanging up around there someplace. [...] He didn’t get paid anything, and if a coach ever had an awkward squad of 11 nit-wits, he did. [...] But he was out there every afternoon, early and late teaching us fundamentals instead of fancy razzle-dazzle plays, and in the end it paid off because we won a few games. [...] I can’t remember who we beat, but I do recall, painfully even after this lapse of time, that our friends over at the county seat (Canton, Ohio) took us to the cleaners twice.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Numerous {{interior}} and exterior locations used to suit {{the needs of the}} story, were filmed in Los Angeles, California. Within a 5-month shooting schedule, 3 weeks were spent shooting at studio locations. Production designer Jack Collis, explained how the film integrates a minority group (the aliens) into the film saying, [...] "The idea was to bring in this alien group, assimilate them into our society, and get them a locale that would be a part of Los Angeles, ... It would look almost as if a group of Koreans or Vietnamese that had moved into the area. This group would have established their own community. They have their own language, their own signs." [...] The film crew installed fictional alien language signs along Western Avenue and Santa Monica Boulevard. Colored drawings were made of all stores {{on both sides of the}} street for two full blocks. Painted and electrical signs were designed for each building. Graffiti was also carefully planned out. The film crew did their own painting and even took a big blank concrete wall and inserted alien graffiti for a scene involving an early physical confrontation between the main characters. Essentially, the alphabet of the alien citizens had to be designed as an integral part of their environment. He commented how the crew [...] "came up with individual alphabets and then combined them into certain words like, say, 'enter' and 'open', so that we could repeat them, ..." [...] while also mentioning how they [...] "brought in a language expert to give us something the actors could be comfortable with." [...] The Hawthorns, a well known family of sign painters, created most of the alien signs. Collis even mused how at one point, store owners liked, and wouldn't want to take down the alien graffiti used during filming on their properties. Collis recalled how the alien language resembled [...] "a flowing design more like hand writing than lettering, that looks almost like a heartbeat graph. Occasionally, we'd underline it as though it came from sort of electronic machine, like an IBM report. It turned out to be such a <b>simple</b> <b>thing</b> once we got it going, but we had to go through a process of 'what is this going to look like?' before we got what we wanted." ...|$|E

2500|$|As scripted by writer Rockne S. O'Bannon, Alien Nation was {{originally}} called, Future Tense. The film {{took some of}} its concept from the TV series In the Heat of the Night, with science fiction elements integrated in the plot. During production, the film had a working title called, Outer Heat, which essentially was an amalgam of In the Heat of the Night and a 1960s science fiction TV series, The Outer Limits. Jack Collis emphasized that the film was not a [...] "space epic" [...] but more of an action film. He admitted, [...] "We did build a spaceship, but it's a <b>simple</b> <b>thing</b> that you see on a TV monitor describing the landing of the aliens several years ago, before they became assimilated into our society. It gives us a background {{but not a lot}} of detail, ..." [...] Collis noted that the film was even [...] "reminiscent of the work I did in Cocoon." [...] An earlier draft of the film was actually written by director James Cameron in 1987, but his name however, was not credited in the final cut of the film. One conceit of the script was that immigrations officials ran out of names for the 300,000 aliens, and began to name them after familiar appellations of the past. Actor Mandy Patinkin's original name for his character was set to be George Jetson. However, three days before the start of shooting, Hanna-Barbera wouldn't allow the name to be used. Expressing his disappointment, Patinkin said, [...] "I assumed that the name of the character I agreed to play was George Jetson. And I was pretty pissed off that there was a screw-up and that the name couldn't be used." [...] He went on to say, [...] "I thought it made a tremendous difference to the piece that the guy's name was George Jetson because it gave a cartoon feeling, an innocence that was important to the movie's whole idea. It's a great loss to the piece that we couldn't recover, a great misfortune that couldn't be solved. It would have helped a lot." [...] In reference to the cartoon character, the producers would leave in the name [...] "George" [...] as a substitute. Patinkin added, [...] "Everything in the script is Jetson, everything on the makeup is labeled Jetson, we always refer to him as Jetson. Not even George, but Jetson. So in our minds, he's George Jetson. So as far as I'm concerned, anybody who sees the movie, they're watching George Jetson no matter what the hell they call him." [...] To understand his role of being a police officer, Patinkin spent two weeks hanging out with the New York City Police Department. He took their training course, joined them on patrol, and spent time with them at the firing range. Commenting on the character development of Francisco, he said [...] "It's one of the better jobs that people from his race have acquired. He feels very {{proud of the fact that}} he's able to be a cop." [...] In 2013, when asked about his role in the film, Caan initially replied, [...] "Why would you bring up that?" [...] before stating, [...] "Yeah, well, I don’t know. I don’t have too many... I mean, I loved Mandy Patinkin. Mandy was a riot. But... I don’t know. It was a lot of silly stuff, creatively. And we had this English director who I wasn’t really that fond of. I mean, nice guy, but... it was just one of those things where, you know, you don’t quit, you get through it. It certainly wasn’t one of... I wouldn’t write it down as one of my favorite movies. But it was pretty popular." ...|$|E
