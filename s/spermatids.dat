25|$|During spermiogenesis, the <b>spermatids</b> {{begin to}} form a tail by growing microtubules {{on one of the}} {{centriole}}s, which turns into basal body. These microtubules form an axoneme. Later the centriole is modified in the process of centrosome reduction. The anterior part of the tail (called midpiece) thickens because mitochondria are arranged around the axoneme to ensure energy supply. Spermatid DNA also undergoes packaging, becoming highly condensed. The DNA is packaged firstly with specific nuclear basic proteins, which are subsequently replaced with protamines during spermatid elongation. The resultant tightly packed chromatin is transcriptionally inactive. The Golgi apparatus surrounds the now condensed nucleus, becoming the acrosome.|$|E

In spermatocytogenesis, a diploid spermatogonium, which resides in the basal compartment of the seminiferous tubules, divides mitotically, producing two diploid intermediate cells called primary spermatocytes. Each primary spermatocyte then moves into the adluminal compartment of the seminiferous tubules and duplicates its DNA and subsequently undergoes meiosis I to produce two haploid secondary spermatocytes, which will later divide once more into haploid <b>spermatids.</b> This division implicates sources of genetic variation, such as random inclusion of either parental chromosomes, and chromosomal crossover, to increase the genetic variability of the gamete.|$|E

2500|$|Spermatogenesis [...] is {{the process}} in which an animal {{produces}} spermatozoa from spermatogonial stem cells by way of mitosis and meiosis. The initial cells in this pathway are called spermatogonia, which yield primary spermatocytes by mitosis. The primary spermatocyte divides meiotically (Meiosis I) into two secondary spermatocytes; each secondary spermatocyte [...] divides into two <b>spermatids</b> by Meiosis II. These develop into mature spermatozoa, also known as sperm cells. Thus, the primary spermatocyte gives rise to two cells, the secondary spermatocytes, and the two secondary spermatocytes by their subdivision produce four spermatozoa.|$|E

During spermatogenesis, each meiotic division is symmetric such that each primary spermatocyte gives rise to 2 secondary spermatocytes after meiosis I, and eventually 4 <b>spermatids</b> after meiosis II.

40|$|We {{undertook}} an ultrastructural {{study of}} the spermiogenesis of the lanternfish Lampanyctus crocodilus (Myctophiformes, Myctophidae) with special emphasis on the condensation of chromatin and the biochemical characterisation of its spermnuclear basic proteins (SNBPs). The round head of the early <b>spermatid</b> of L. crocodilus develops into a curved conical-shaped head in the spermatozoon. Two flagella, present even in the <b>spermatid,</b> are inserted laterally at the convex side of the sperm head. Both flagella possess an axoneme with a 9 + 0 instead of the typical 9 + 2 axonemal structure. Mitochondria undergo a characteristic redistribution during spermiogenesis. A reduced number of them are present lying away from the centrioles {{at both ends of}} the concave side of the sperm head. During the chromatin condensation stages in spermiogenesis, fibrogranular structures with granules of 25 +/- 5 and 50 +/- 5 nm can be observed in the early <b>spermatid</b> and develop into larger granules of about 150 +/- 50 nm in the middle <b>spermatid.</b> The latter granules coalesce during the transition to the advanced <b>spermatid</b> and spermatozoon giving rise to highly condensed chromatin in the sperm cell. Protamines are the main SNBPs associated with this chromatin; however, they are unusually large and correspond to the largest protamines described in fish to date.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{polarity}} {{and its role}} in cell–cell interactions, such as <b>spermatid</b> polarity and adhesion in the seminiferous epithelium, and blood–testis barrier (BTB) in the testis during the epithelial cycle of spermatogenesis in recent years has yielded some unexpected and interesting observations. Similar to other polarized tissues, Sertoli and germ cells in the seminiferous epithelium express many of the component proteins of the Par-, Scribble- and Crumb-based polarity protein complexes. These polarity proteins are working in concert with non-receptor protein kinases, adhesion proteins, and cytoskeletons to confer <b>spermatid</b> and Sertoli cell polarity, and these proteins are also involved in germ cell transport in the epithelium during the epithelial cycle. In this review, we summarize the latest findings in the field. Based on the available data in the literature, it is increasingly clear that polarity proteins are crucial in (1) conferring <b>spermatid</b> and Sertoli cell polarity, (2) regulating <b>spermatid</b> adhesion and transport, and (3) regulating BTB dynamics in the testis during the epithelial cycle. We also highlight specific areas of research that deserve attention in future years.

40|$|AbstractOne of {{the more}} {{dramatic}} examples of cellular reorganization occurs during spermiogenesis in which a roughly spherical <b>spermatid</b> {{is transformed into a}} mature sperm cell. A highlight of this process involves nuclear remodeling whereby the round <b>spermatid</b> nucleus is sculpted into an elongated and polar structure. This transformation in nuclear architecture features chromatin condensation, changes in the composition and organization of the nuclear lamina and redistribution and elimination of nuclear pore complexes. The manchette, a cytoplasmic microtubule-based structure is thought to {{play a crucial role in}} the remodeling process. Here we show that SUN 4, a <b>spermatid</b> nuclear membrane protein has an essential function in coupling the manchette to the nuclear periphery. In the absence of SUN 4, manchette microtubules appear highly disorganized and the nucleus itself fails to elongate.

40|$|Thrips {{spermiogenesis}} {{is characterized}} by unusual features in the differentiating <b>spermatid</b> cells. Three centrioles from which three individual short flagella are initially assembled, make the early <b>spermatid</b> a tri-flagellated cell. Successively, during <b>spermatid</b> maturation, the three basal bodies maintain a position close to the most anterior end of the elongating nucleus, so that the three axonemes are progressively incorporated in the <b>spermatid</b> cytoplasm, where they run in parallel to the main nuclear axis. Finally, the three axonemes amalgamate to form a microtubular bundle. The process starts {{with the formation of}} rifts at three specific points in each axonemal circumference, corresponding to sites 1, 3, 7 and leads to the formation of 9 microtubular rows of different length, i. e. 3 "dyads", 3 "triads" and 3 "tetrads". In the spermatozoon, the nucleus, the mitochondrion and the bundle of microtubules are arranged in a helicoidal pattern. The elongation of the spermatozoon is allowed by the deep anchorage of the <b>spermatid</b> to the cyst cell through a dense mass of material which, at the end of spermiogenesis, becomes a long anterior cylindrical structure. This bizarre "axoneme" does not show any trace of progressive movement but it is able to beat. According to the presence of dynein arms, sliding can take place only within each row and not between the rows. The possible molecular basis underlying the peculiar instability of thrips axonemes is discussed in light of the present knowledge on the organization of the axoneme in mutant organisms carrying alterations of the tubulin molecule...|$|R
