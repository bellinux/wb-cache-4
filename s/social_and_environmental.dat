By 1285, following a period of <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>environmental</b> instability driven by a series of severe and prolonged droughts, they abandoned the area and moved south to locations in Arizona and New Mexico, including Rio Chama, Pajarito Plateau, and Santa Fe.|$|E
5|$|Mayapan was {{abandoned}} around 1448, {{after a period}} of political, <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>environmental</b> turbulence that in many ways echoed the Classic period collapse in the southern Maya region. The abandonment of the city was followed by a period of prolonged warfare, disease and natural disasters in the Yucatán Peninsula, which ended only shortly before Spanish contact in 1511. Even without a dominant regional capital, the early Spanish explorers reported wealthy coastal cities and thriving marketplaces. During the Late Postclassic, the Yucatán Peninsula was divided into a number of independent provinces that shared a common culture but varied in internal sociopolitical organization. On the eve of the Spanish conquest, the highlands of Guatemala were dominated by several powerful Maya states. The K'iche' had carved out a small empire covering {{a large part of the}} western Guatemalan Highlands and the neighbouring Pacific coastal plain. However, in the decades before the Spanish invasion the Kaqchikel kingdom had been steadily eroding the kingdom of the K'iche'.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT As {{the body}} of {{evidence}} linking disparities in the health of urban residents to disparate <b>social,</b> economic <b>and</b> <b>environmental</b> contexts grows, efforts to delineate the pathways through which broader <b>social</b> <b>and</b> economic inequalities influence health have burgeoned. One hypothesized pathway connects economic and racial and ethnic inequalities to differentials in stress associated with <b>social</b> <b>and</b> physical environments, with subsequent implications for health. Drawing on data from Detroit, Michigan, we examined contributions of neighborhood-level characteristics (e. g., poverty rate, racial and ethnic composition, residential stability) and individual-level characteristics (e. g., age, gender) to perceived <b>social</b> <b>and</b> physical <b>environmental</b> stress. We found that neighborhood percent African American was positively associated with perceptions of both <b>social</b> <b>and</b> physical <b>environmental</b> stress; neighborhood percent poverty and percent Latino were positively associated with perceived physical <b>environmental</b> stress; <b>and</b> neighborhood residential stability was negatively associated with perceived social environmental stress. At the individual level, whites perceived higher levels of both <b>social</b> <b>and</b> physical <b>environmental</b> stress compared to African American residents of th...|$|R
