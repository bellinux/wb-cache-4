40|$|Studies of the {{microbiological}} {{determination of}} slimicides in food packaging materials {{of paper and}} cardboard revealed {{that the results of}} the agar diffusion test are influenced by the composition of material and its specific weight {{as well as by the}} test strains and their cell- or spore concentration. The sensitivity of the agar diffusion test does not depend upon the size of the sample discs except within strictly defined areas. In the case of a minimal inhibition concentration optimal sizes of tests discs could be detected. Compared with Aspergillus niger, four strains of moulds isolated from foods and paper showed higher sensitivities against the slimicides tested. The formulated <b>slimicide</b> 1. 4 Bis(bromacetoxy) butene can be assayed by Penicillium verrucosum var. cyclopium, Stamm I, P. verricosum var. cyclopium, Stamm II, P. decumbens and P. chrysogenum on the level of a minimal inhibition concentration of 1 My g per 6 -mm disc...|$|E

30|$|In the European directive, {{regulating}} {{the quality of}} water {{intended for human consumption}} (EU Drinking Water Directive), it is stated that pesticides are organic insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, nematocides, acaricides, algicides, rodenticides, <b>slimicides,</b> related products (inter alia, growth regulators) and their relevant metabolites, degradation and reaction products [22]. Limit values for active substances in pesticides, including their relevant metabolites, degradation and reaction products are fixed at 0.1  µg/L for single substances, and 0.5  µg/L for the sum of substances.|$|R
40|$|Acrolein {{has been}} {{identified}} in at least 32 of the 1, 684 hazardous waste sites that have been proposed for inclusion on the EPA National Priorities List (NPL) (HazDat 2006). However, the number of sites evaluated for acrolein is not known. The frequency of these sites {{can be seen in}} Figure 6 - 1. Acrolein may be released to the environment in emissions and effluents from its manufacturing and use facilities, in emissions from combustion processes (including cigarette smoking and combustion of petrochemical fuels), from direct application to water and waste water as a <b>slimicide</b> and aquatic herbicide, as a photooxidation product of various hydrocarbon pollutants found in air (including propylene and 1, 3 -butadiene), and from land disposal of some organic waste materials. Acrolein is a reactive compound and is unstable in the environment. In ambient air, the primary removal mechanism for acrolein is predicted to be reaction with photo chemically generated hydroxyl radicals (half-life, 15 – 20 hours). Products of this reaction include carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, and glycolaldehyde. In the presence of nitrogen oxides, peroxynitrate and nitric acid are also formed. Small amounts of acrolein may also be removed from the atmosphere in precipitation. Insufficient data are available to predict the fate of acrolein in indoor air. In water, small amounts of acrolein may be removed by volatilization (half-life, 23 hours from a model river 1 m deep) ...|$|E
40|$|A 1999 {{desk study}} assesses the {{environmental}} risks of 93 industrial or other non-agricultural pesticides. The risks for aquatic ecosystems are emphasised, and various data on use pattern, dosages, emissions, physicochemistry, environmental fate and ecotoxicity are listed. The biocides {{have not been}} included {{in any of the}} environmental policy spearheads for biocides in the Netherlands, primarily due to lack of data. This lack is partially confirmed by the present study: e. g. experimental data on the effects to purification processes in sewage treatment plants are available for only four substances. This study also shows that 11 biocides can have an adverse impact on aquatic organisms (e. g. 2, 2 -dibromo- 3 -nitrilopropionamide as a <b>slimicide</b> in paper industries) and that 11 biocides probably have no adverse impact on aquatic organisms (e. g. zinc oxide as antifouling). A group of 17 biocides cannot be characterised for the environmental impact - although emission to surface water is indicated -, because there are no models, no ecotoxicological data or no data on the actual yearly industrial or domestic use. Some of these biocides are very toxic as seen in acute toxicity tests in the laboratory (e. g. disodium cyanodithioimido carbonate). As the environmental risk assessments in this study reflect realistic worst-case conditions, a follow-up study will be aimed at adequate risk assessments under more general conditions. In this way, the assessments for the potentially hazardous 11 biocides will be specified by a more precise exposure assessment and additional ecotoxicity data, if available. More precise data on the actual use of biocides by industries are also required...|$|E
40|$|Mercury {{contamination}} {{has been}} a historical problem in the Upper Wisconsin River and was presumably caused {{by the use of}} phenyl mercuric acetate as a <b>slimicide</b> by the pulp and paper industry. Elevated levels of other n~tals in bed sediments have also been observed. Common carp and walleyes were collected from five sites in the main study area of the Upper Wisconsin River extending from the Brokaw area to the Lake DuBay Dam. Walleyes collected from the Rainbow Flowage and common carp from Range Line Lake, two relatively uncontaminated sites in northcentral Wisconsin, were used as reference samples. Four metals were analyzed, each in a selected tissue of the two species: zinc in gill filaments, cadmium and lead in liver, and mercury in axial muscle. Concentrations of mercury in common carp from the main study area were significantly higher than those in carp from the reference site. However, mercury levels in walleyes from the main study area were similar to those in walleyes from the reference site, Rainbow Flowage. Mercury concentrations in axial muscle of both species were similar to mercury levels in fish of similar size, analyzed during 1970 - 1973 from the same reaches of the Upper Wisconsin River. Mercury availability and cycling through biota of this system may be enhanced by rapid rates of methylation in surficial sediments, even though the most heavily contaminated sediments have been buried by subsequent deposits. In general. cadmium and lead concentrations in liver and zinc concentrations in gill filaments were not elevated in fish from the main study area, relative to values in reference samples...|$|E
40|$|Dithiocarbamates {{are widely}} used as {{fungicides}} because of their efficacy against {{a broad spectrum of}} fungi and their associated plant diseases. Dithiocarbamates are also used in industry as <b>slimicides</b> in water-cooling systems, in sugar, pulp, and paper manufacturing, and as vulcanization accelerators and antioxidants in rubber. Because of their chelating properties, they are also used as scavengers in waste-water treatment. Dithiocarbamates can be divided into two groups: the ethylenebisdithiocarbamates (EBDC), such as maneb, zineb, and mancozeb, and the dimethyldithiocarbamates (DMDC), including ferbam, ziram, and thiram...|$|R
40|$|Humans {{are exposed}} to ethylenebisdithiocarbamates (EBDCs) from {{environmental}} sources. Exposure to EBDCs is chronic for workers {{in a variety of}} industries, where EBDCs are used for their properties as <b>slimicides,</b> vulcanization accelerators, antioxidants, and scavengers in waste-water treatment. EBDCs, and particularly the EBDC metabolite ethylenethiourea, have clearly defined, important toxic effects in various animal species, and there is reason to suspect they are carcinogenic in humans. In the absence of definitive information regarding human risk, further studies need to be done. In the interim, regular surveillance of workers with high levels of exposure to EBDCs, with specific attention to markers of thyroid and hepatic pathology, should be considered...|$|R
25|$|There {{are several}} web {{articles}} claiming that formaldehyde has been banned from manufacture or import into the European Union (EU) under REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and restriction of Chemical substances) legislation. This {{appears to be}} misinformation, as official EU chemical databases contradict these claims as of February 19, 2010. This misconception has gained some ground. Formaldehyde is not listed in the Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 689/2008 (export and import of dangerous chemicals regulation), nor on a priority list for risk assessment. However, formaldehyde is banned from use in certain applications (preservatives for liquid-cooling and processing systems, <b>slimicides,</b> metalworking-fluid preservatives, and antifouling products) under the Biocidal Products Directive. In the EU, the maximum allowed concentration of formaldehyde in finished products is 0.2%, and any product that exceeds 0.05% has to include a warning that the product contains formaldehyde.|$|R
40|$|Mercury {{is known}} for its {{biomagnification}} especially in aquatic food chains and for its toxic effects on different organisms including man. In Finland mercury has formerly been used in industry and agriculture and in addition many anthropogenic activities may increase the mercury levels in ecosystems. Phenyl mercury was widely used as <b>slimicide</b> in the pulp and paper industry in the 1950 s and 1960 s. In the chlor-alkali industry metallic mercury was used as catalyst at three plants. The most toxic form of mercury, methyl mercury, may be formed in soils, water, sediments and organisms. Many factors, including microbial activity, temperature, oxygen status etc., affect the methylation rate. In the lake ecosystem bioaccumulation of methyl mercury is very strong. In early 1980 s there was a restriction of fishing concerning approximately 4000 km 2 of lakes and sea areas because of mercury pollution. In aquatic systems we still find elevated concentrations near former emission sources. Long-range atmospheric transport and mechanical operations like ditching and water regulation may cause increased levels of mercury in the aquatic ecosystems. In the Finnish agriculture organic mercury compounds were used for seed dressing until 1992. Although the amounts used were substantial the concentrations in agricultural soils have remained rather low. In terrestrial food chains bioaccumulation is normally weak with low or moderate concentration at all ecosystem levels. Due to a weak uptake through roots terrestrial, vascular plants normally contain only small amounts of mercury. There is a bidirectional exchange of mercury between vegetation and atmosphere. Contrary to vascular plants, there is a very wide range of concentrations in fungi. Mercury may pose a threat to human health especially when accumulated in aquatic food chains...|$|E

40|$|This report {{contains}} a refined risk assessment for the aquatic environment of a "rest"group of 93 non-agricultural pesticides: defined as {{such as they}} do not fit {{into one of the}} five policy spearheads on biocides of the Dutch government. The active ingredients and their applications are combined to c. 50 substance-specific applications (SSAs). This refined aquatic risk assessment reveals that a total of 26 SSAs is still considered to be potentially (very) hazardous. The group contains mainly <b>slimicides,</b> liquid-cooling system preservatives and sanitary disinfectants. Regarding this group of biocides the policy making might focus at: availability of (refined) scenarios; usefulness of (refined) scenarios; validation of scenario calculations with monitoring data of process water and effluent. Outside this group of 26 SSAs, there are some focus points as well: an important bottleneck is that there are no models for biocides in the food and feed area, whereas large amounts of them can probably be used in that area...|$|R
40|$|In Canada {{there are}} in excess of 100 laws that have some {{authority}} over the sale, use, or consequence of use of pesticides. This includes legislation adopted by federal, provincial, and municipal governments, {{but only a few}} of these relate only to pesticides. The principal federal law that governs sale and use of pesticides is the Pest Control Products Act. Under the authority of the P. C. P. Act, the Pesticides Division of Agriculture Canada reviews registration applications for all pesticides intended for use in Canada. The Act defines a control product as anything that is manufactured (including devices), represented, sold, or used in controlling, preventing, destroying, mitigating, attracting, or repelling any pest. Thus, in addition to the traditional agricultural herbicides, insecticides, fungicides and vertebrate control products, such product classes as diSinfectants, algaecides, <b>slimicides,</b> wood preservatives, antimicrobial additives to plants, plastics, cements, textiles, etc., require registration. The Act may be broken down into four major clauses: (1) No person shall manufacture, store, display, distribute, or use any control product under unsafe conditions related to human health or environmental quality. (2) No person may package, label, or advertise any control product which could be deceptive in character, value, quantity, composition, merit, or safety. (3) No person shall sell or import any control product, unless it is registered. (4) No person shall export or convey from province to province any control product which is not made in a registered manufacturing establishment. The remaining elements of the Act and the Regulations are oriented to provide authority to achieve these purposes...|$|R
40|$|Female rats {{were exposed}} to 0, 5, 50 or 500 ppm of 2 -chlorophenol (2 -CP) or {{pentachlorophenol}} (PCP). The {{study was designed to}} produce progeny which {{were exposed to}} the chlorophenolic compounds both prenatally and postnatally. Percent conception, litter size, birth weight, and number of stillbirths was determined at parturition. Hematologic parameters and body weights of the progeny were recorded at weaning age (3 weeks). Effects on reproduction were observed in both the 2 -CP and PCP-exposed groups, as indicated by decreased litter sizes and increased number of stillborn. The data indicate that these chlorinated phenolic compounds may be feto- or embryotoxic at high doses. Effects on hematologic parameters were not observed. Further study involving transplacental and chronic exposures to these chlorophenolic compounds appears warranted. The chlorophenols are a group of 19 compounds which differ in degree and position of chlorination (1). These compounds consist of mono-, di-, tri- and tetrachloro isomers and a pentachlorophenol. The chlorinated phenols are effective disinfectants, antiseptics, fungicides, <b>slimicides,</b> bactericides, wood preservatives, herbicides, insecticides, and molluscicides (2 - 9). The widespread use of these chemicals in industry and agriculture has resulted in contamination of food producing animals and the environment. Inadvertent formation of 2 -chlorophenol, 2, 4 -dichlorophenol and 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol as byproducts of water chlorination represent significant sources of exposure to these compounds (1). 2 -Chlorophenol is a commercially produced chemical used as an intermediate in the production of higher chlorinated phenols. The generation of waste sources from the commercial production of 2 -chlorophenol, its chemically derived products, and the inadvertent formation of 2 -chlorophenol due to chlorination of organics in drinking and waste waters are potential sources of environmental contamination (1). Pentachlorophenol (PCP) and its salts have been widely used in agriculture and industry since 193...|$|R
