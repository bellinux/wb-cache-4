5|$|Construction {{works on}} the pyramid of Neferefre had just begun when Neferefre died {{unexpectedly}} in his early twenties. At the time of Nyuserre's ascension to the throne, only one step of the core of Neferefre's pyramid had been completed. The <b>substructures,</b> built in a large open pit {{at the center of}} the pyramid were possibly unfinished as well. Nyuserre hastily completed the pyramid by transforming it into a stylised primeval mound resembling a mastaba: the walls of the core layer already in place were covered with limestone and the top was filled with clay and stones drawn from the local desert.|$|E

The study here shows {{that in order to}} enforce interface compatibility and equilibrium conditions to the <b>substructure</b> test data, it is necessary to place collocated actuator/sensor pair at every interface degree-of-freedom. Procedures for assembling <b>substructure</b> transfer function data, <b>substructure</b> state-space models, and <b>substructure</b> Markov parameters are presented.

40|$|A <b>substructure</b> {{synthesis}} procedure {{applicable to}} structural systems containing general nonconservative terms is presented.

A reduced-order model for each <b>substructure</b> is implemented by representing the <b>substructure</b> as a combination of a small number of Ritz vectors. For the method presented, the <b>substructure</b> Ritz vectors are identified as a truncated set of <b>substructure</b> eigenmodes, which are typically complex, along with a set of generalized real attachment modes. The formation of the generalized attachment modes does not require any knowledge of the <b>substructure</b> flexible modes; hence, only the eigenmodes used explicitly as Ritz vectors need to be extracted from the <b>substructure</b> eigenproblem.

5|$|It {{has been}} pointed out that, architecturally, both the O-13 Pyramid and the Late Classic Temple of the Inscriptions at Palenque, are nearly identical; both have {{the same number of}} {{substructure}} terraces, and both pyramids' <b>substructures</b> have exactly five doors. Furthermore, both pyramids were built into the sides of existing hills.

5|$|The {{architecture}} of the layer pyramid allows it to be securely dated to the time span between the reigns of king Sekhemkhet and that of king Snofru, {{the founder of the}} 4th Dynasty. Rainer Stadelmann, Miroslav Verner and Jean-Philippe Lauer compare the {{architecture of}} the layer pyramid with that of the step pyramids of Djoser and Sekhemkhet, expecting the layer pyramid to have originally consisted of five steps, just as its near-contemporary predecessors. The layer pyramid exhibits at one site both complex developments concerning its <b>substructures</b> and simplifications concerning the building methods employed for the superstructure. According to these egyptologists, the layer pyramid is a clearly advanced version of the buried pyramid of Sekhemkhet.|$|E
5|$|The Western Wall is {{considered}} holy {{due to its}} connection to the Temple Mount. Because of the Temple Mount entry restrictions, the Wall is the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray, {{though it is not}} the holiest site in the Jewish faith, which lies behind it. The original, natural and irregular-shaped Temple Mount was gradually extended to allow for an ever-larger Temple compound to be built at its top. This process was finalised by Herod, who enclosed the Mount with an almost rectangular set of retaining walls, built to support extensive <b>substructures</b> and earth fills needed to give the natural hill a geometrically regular shape. On top of this box-like structure Herod built a vast paved esplanade which surrounded the Temple. Of the four retaining walls, the western one {{is considered}} to be closest to the former Temple, which makes it the most sacred site recognised by Judaism outside the former Temple Mount esplanade. Just over half the wall's total height, including its 17 courses located below street level, dates {{from the end of the}} Second Temple period, and is commonly believed to have been built around 19 BCE by Herod the Great, although recent excavations indicate that the work was not finished by the time Herod died in 4 BCE. The very large stone blocks of the lower courses are Herodian, the courses of medium-sized stones above them were added during the Umayyad era, while the small stones of the uppermost courses are of more recent date, especially from the Ottoman period.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. One of {{the targets}} of the {{recently}} launched Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope is a diffuse gamma-ray background from dark-matter annihilation or decay in the Galactic halo. N-body simulations and theoretical arguments suggest that the dark matter in the Galactic halo may be clumped into <b>substructure,</b> rather than smoothly distributed. Here we propose the gamma-ray-flux probability distribution function (PDF) as a probe of <b>substructure</b> in the Galactic halo. We calculate this PDF for a phenomenological model of halo <b>substructure</b> and determine the regions of the <b>substructure</b> parameter space in which the PDF may be distinguished from the PDF for a smooth distribution of dark matter. In principle, the PDF allows a statistical detection of <b>substructure,</b> even if individual halos cannot be detected.

5|$|Despite its {{architectural}} prominence, {{very little}} is known of the church's history and its precise architecture. Most of {{the information on the}} church's original appearance is derived from the epigram in honour of Juliana and her family, which was inscribed in pieces {{in various parts of the}} church. The epigram claims that the church was laid out as a replica of the ancient Jewish Temple with the precise proportions given in the Bible for the Temple of Solomon, and using the royal cubit as a unit of measure, as in its model. Richard Martin Harrison, the site's chief excavator, has reconstructed the church as a roughly square basilica, ca. 52 m long on the sides, with a central nave and two side aisles, fronted by a narthex and preceded by a large atrium of 26 m length. To the north of the atrium, remains of another building have been identified as either the church's baptistery or Juliana's palace. An oval substructure in the building's center indicates the position of the ambon, while strong foundations throughout the building indicate, according to Harrison, the presence of a dome, bringing the estimated height of the building to over 30 m. The area of the altar was not sufficiently excavated, and its shape remains unknown. The possible presence of a dome, although not universally accepted, is of major importance, since it would mean that it was St. Polyeuctus, and not Justinian's churches (Saints Sergius and Bacchus and the Hagia Sophia), which first combined the traditional basilica with a dome. From the epigram, we know that the interior featured two storeys with colonnades and galleries. Based on the epigram and the <b>substructures,</b> Harrison also posited the existence of a pair of two-storey exedrae, composed of three niches with a pier in between, on the northern and southern sides of the ambo. The spaces around the domed western bay would have been covered with barrel or cross-vaults.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Observations of multiple-image {{gravitational}} lens systems {{suggest that the}} projected mass distributions of galaxy haloes may contain substantial inhomogeneities. The fraction of the halo mass in dense <b>substructure</b> is still highly uncertain, but could be {{as large as a}} few percent. While halo <b>substructure</b> is seen in numerical simulations of CDM haloes, little of this <b>substructure</b> survives in the innermost regions of haloes, and thus the observational claims for <b>substructure</b> at small projected radii are slightly surprising. There is evidence, however, that even the highest-resolution simulations published to-date are still limited by numerical effects that heat and disrupt <b>substructure</b> artificially in high-density regions. By comparing numerical and semi-analytic (SA) models of halo <b>substructure,</b> we show that current simulations probably underestimate the mass fraction in <b>substructure</b> at small projected radii, by a factor of at least 2 – 3.

In clusters with virial ratios of 0. 5 or higher, initial density <b>substructure</b> survives for several crossing times, in virtually all cases.
