5|$|During the 15th century, many of England’s finest towers {{were either}} built or {{extended}} in the Perpendicular style {{including those of}} the cathedrals of Gloucester, Worcester, Wells, York, Durham and Canterbury, and the <b>spires</b> <b>of</b> Chichester and Norwich.|$|E
5|$|In summer 1548, the galleys {{returned}} to Scotland to scout for English ships. Knox's health was now {{at its lowest}} point due to the severity of his confinement. He was ill with a fever {{and others on the}} ship were afraid for his life. Even in this state, Knox recalled, his mind remained sharp and he comforted his fellow prisoners with hopes of release. While the ships were lying offshore between St Andrews and Dundee, the <b>spires</b> <b>of</b> the parish church where he preached appeared in view. James Balfour, a fellow prisoner, asked Knox whether he recognised the landmark. He replied that he knew it well, recognising the steeple of the place where he first preached and he declared that he would not die until he had preached there again.|$|E
5|$|While all the cathedrals are impressive, some, {{because of}} their location, are highly {{significant}} landmarks and landscape elements. Among these is Chichester, which can be seen for many miles across a landscape of open fields {{and is the only}} one of England’s cathedrals that is visible from the sea. The grey spire of Norwich rises serenely from its surrounding city, to be a focus of the Norwich School of landscape painters. Ely, on a small hill, dominates the rural countryside and its appearance in times of flood causes it to be known as The Ship of the Fens. The three <b>spires</b> <b>of</b> Lichfield are known as The Ladies of the Vale. The “exquisite tower” of Worcester is seen best across the River Severn. Lincoln with its vast façade and three towers, the tallest being over 80 metres (270ft), rises majestically from a steep hill above the town. Salisbury Cathedral with its “faultless spire” constitutes one of the iconic views of England, made famous by the landscape painter John Constable. In the north of England, Durham makes a “spectacular” view as it sits dramatically on its steep rocky peninsula above the River Wear, “half Church of God, half castle ‘gainst the Scots”.|$|E

25|$|The {{most visible}} signs of Blacket's career are the spires that he {{positioned}} on hilltops around Sydney {{and in several}} country towns. Unfortunately, among those proposed but never realised are the <b>spires</b> <b>of</b> three of Blacket's grandest churches, Goulburn Cathedral, St Thomas's, North Sydney and All Saints, Woollahra.|$|E

25|$|The {{architecture}} of metropolitan Detroit continues {{to attract the}} attention of architects and preservationists alike. With one of the world's recognizable skylines, Detroit's waterfront panorama shows a variety of architectural styles. The city's historic Art Deco skyscrapers blend with the post-modern neogothic <b>spires</b> <b>of</b> One Detroit Center. Together with the Renaissance Center, they form the city's distinctive skyline.|$|E
25|$|The step pyramid is {{the basic}} design of 8th century Borobudur Buddhist {{monument}} in Central Java. However the later temples built in Java were influenced by Indian Hindu architecture, as displayed by the towering <b>spires</b> <b>of</b> Prambanan temple. In the 15th century Java during late Majapahit period saw the revival of Austronesian indigenous elements as displayed by Sukuh temple that somewhat resemble Mesoamerican pyramid, and also stepped pyramids of Mount Penanggungan.|$|E
25|$|Generally Daegu {{is known}} as a {{conservative}} city. As well as being the largest inland city in the country beside Seoul it {{has become one of the}} major metropolitan areas in the nation. Traditionally, Buddhism has been strong; today there are still many temples. Confucianism is also popular in Daegu, with a large academy based in the city. Neon cross-topped <b>spires</b> <b>of</b> Christian churches can also be seen in the city.|$|E

25|$|Cayley {{was formed}} in {{relatively}} early Pliocene time compared to most other Cascade volcanoes, which were formed {{in the past two}} million years, and mostly in the past one million years or less. Cayley's first phase of activity began approximately four million years ago with the eruption of lava and ash, such as plagioclase-hypersthene-hornblende-phyric dacite flows, tephra, and pyroclastic breccia, and concluded with the formation of a central lava dome which develop the present summit <b>spires</b> <b>of</b> Mount Cayley.|$|E
25|$|The {{crossing}} tower, {{which holds}} the bells, is quite stocky but its silhouette is made elegant by {{the provision of}} tall crocketted pinnacles. The completed <b>spires</b> <b>of</b> the main front enhance {{the view of the}} cathedral along College Street and particularly the ceremonial approach from the flight of stairs in front of the cathedral. Standing at , they make St Mary's the fourth tallest church in Australia, after the triple-spired St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne, St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne and Sacred Heart Cathedral, Bendigo.|$|E
25|$|The {{entrances to}} the Crypt and the Upper Basilica, {{both of which}} are built on top of Massabielle, are far above ground level. To {{facilitate}} access, two enormous ramps were constructed, which curve down either side of Rosary Square. The image of the entrance of the Rosary Basilica, flanked by the two ramps and surmounted by the <b>spires</b> <b>of</b> the Upper Basilica, {{has become one of the}} iconic symbols of Lourdes, and a stylised form of this image has been adopted by the Domain itself as its logo.|$|E

5000|$|The Collégiale Saint-Thiébaut (Saint-Theobald collegiate church) in Thann, Haut-Rhin {{is one of}} {{the most}} ornate Gothic churches in the whole Upper Rhenish region (Alsace, Baden, North-Western Switzerland, Palatinate). Of its 76 meters high spire, it is said that [...] "The <b>spire</b> <b>of</b> Strasbourg is the highest, the <b>spire</b> <b>of</b> Freiburg is the {{broadest}} but the <b>spire</b> <b>of</b> Thann is the prettiest." [...] In spite of its name, the church is actually dedicated to Saint-Ubald, of which it keeps a finger as a relic. It is listed as a Monument historique since 1841 by the French Ministry of Culture.|$|R

25|$|The Memorial park {{is a small}} keyhole shaped area {{located on}} the aptly named 'Canadalaan' on the {{southwest}} fringe of Passendale village. Fittingly, maple trees and a hedge of holly line {{the edges of the}} park and well kept lawns and stone pathways surround the low circular flagstone terrace that the granite memorial block rests on. From the centre of the memorial grounds one can look up the Canadalaan to see the rebuilt church of Passendale and in the opposite direction, down a long avenue of trees, the rebuilt <b>spires</b> <b>of</b> Ypres.|$|E
25|$|The {{material}} {{of the floor}} of the canyon system between Candor and Melas chasmata is grooved. This is interpreted to be alluvial deposits and/or material that has collapsed or contracted by the removal of ice or water. There are also portions of older and younger massive floor {{material of}} volcaniclastic origin - only separated in age by crater distribution. Also there is etched massive floor material that is like the younger and older massive material except that it has wind erosion features on it. There are also a few <b>spires</b> <b>of</b> undivided material composed of the same material as the canyon walls.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the years}} Rauchtown Run {{has made its}} way through the {{mountains}} {{on its way to the}} West Branch Susquehanna River near Jersey Shore, via Antes Creek. The years of water flow have created the gorge in which the park is located. Tall erosional <b>spires</b> <b>of</b> sandstone have created a formation known as Castle Rocks. The rocks can be seen from the Mid State Trail and are said to resemble the towers of an ancient castle. The frost action, brought on by the cold winters of Pennsylvania, has led to the creation of this rock formation.|$|E

25|$|Seen in panorama, Detroit's {{waterfront}} shows {{a variety}} of architectural styles. The post modern Neo-Gothic <b>spires</b> <b>of</b> the One Detroit Center (1993) were designed to blend with the city's Art Deco skyscrapers. Together with the Renaissance Center, they form a distinctive and recognizable skyline. Examples of the Art Deco style include the Guardian Building and Penobscot Building downtown, {{as well as the}} Fisher Building and Cadillac Place in the New Center area near Wayne State University. Among the city's prominent structures are United States' largest Fox Theatre, the Detroit Opera House, and the Detroit Institute of Arts.|$|E
25|$|Many abbeys of France, {{such as that}} at Cluny, {{had many}} towers of varied forms. This is also common in Germany, where the apses were {{sometimes}} framed with circular towers and the crossing surmounted by an octagonal tower as at Worms Cathedral. Large paired towers of square plan could also occur on the transept ends, such as those at Tournai Cathedral in Belgium. In Germany, where four towers frequently occur, they often have spires that may be four or eight sided, or the distinctive Rhenish helm shape seen on the cathedrals of Limburg or Speyer. It is also common to see bell or onion-shaped <b>spires</b> <b>of</b> the Baroque period surmounting Romanesque towers in central and Eastern Europe.|$|E
25|$|For decades, {{the towering}} <b>spires</b> <b>of</b> the many Protestant and Roman Catholic churches {{dominated}} the city's skyline. Most {{of the numerous}} Catholic churches were established to serve {{one of the many}} ethnic communities that made up Pittston. The Irish had St. John the Evangelist and St. Mary Help of Christians, the Slovaks had St. John the Baptist, the Lithuanians had St. Casimir's, the Germans had St. Mary Assumption, and the Italians had St. Rocco's and Our Lady of Mount Carmel. There is also a Byzantine Catholic Church on Main Street (St. Michael's). From 2004 to the present, the Diocese of Scranton has closed many of the churches and private schools in and around Pittston due to declining population and enrollment. Saint John the Baptist Elementary School closed in 2004, and Seton Catholic High School closed in 2007. St. Mary's Assumption School closed in 2011.|$|E
