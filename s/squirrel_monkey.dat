5|$|It {{was once}} {{believed}} that the Central American <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkey</b> was just a population of a South American species of <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkey</b> brought to Central America by humans. Evidence for this theory included the very small range of the Central American <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkey</b> and the large gap from the range of any other <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkey</b> species. A study of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA demonstrated that the Central American <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkey</b> is indeed a separate species that apparently diverged from the South American species long ago – at least 260,000 years ago and possibly more than 4 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The {{lifespan}} of the Central American <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkey</b> in {{the wild}} is unknown, but captive specimens {{have been known to}} live more than 15 years. Other <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkey</b> species are known to be able to live more than 20 years.|$|E
5|$|Predator {{detection}} by {{the males}} becomes particularly important {{during the period}} when the infants are born. Raptors spend significantly more time near the <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkey</b> troops during this period, and prey on {{a significant number of}} the newborn infants. Other animals that prey on Central American <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkey</b> infants include toucans, tayras, opossums, coatis, snakes, and even spider monkeys.|$|E
50|$|In South America, <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkeys</b> {{associate}} with capuchin monkeys. This {{may have more}} to do with foraging benefits to the <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkeys</b> than anti-predation benefits.|$|R

5000|$|At {{least five}} populations of common <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkeys</b> have existed in Florida since the 1960s, if not earlier. Common <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkeys</b> have been {{established}} at Silver Springs {{since at least the}} late 1960s; rhesus macaques were established in the area by 1938, but there is no firm information on when the <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkeys</b> were released. In the 1960s, a colony of twelve to fifteen common <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkeys</b> was noted residing in a hammock of trees by the springs; they migrated downstream to the Ocklawaha River by 1975. Another population, derived from two pairs released in the 1960s, lives on the Bartlett Estate in Broward County; they numbered 43 in 1988. In 1976, 15 <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkeys</b> escaped from the Tropic Wonderland attraction in Titusville, Florida; their descendants have since become established in the area. In the 1980s, 500 and 1000 common <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkeys</b> remained in the shuttered Masterpiece Gardens park in Polk County, persisting despite efforts to capture them. Additionally, a [...] "semi-free-ranging" [...] population has existed at Monkey Jungle in Goulds in Miami-Dade County since 1960.|$|R
5|$|Certain {{bird species}} {{associate}} with the Central American <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkey.</b> The birds follow the monkeys {{in an attempt to}} prey on insects and small vertebrates that the monkeys flush out. At Corcovado National Park, bird species known to regularly follow squirrel monkeys include the double-toothed kite, the grey-headed tanager and the tawny-winged woodcreeper, but other woodcreepers and such species as motmots and trogons do so as well. This activity increases during the wet season, when arthropods are harder to find.|$|E
5|$|The Central American <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkey</b> differs in {{coloration}} from South American squirrel monkeys. While South American squirrel monkeys tend to {{be primarily}} greenish in color, the Central American species has an orange back with olive shoulders, hips and tail and white undersides. The hands and feet are also orange. There is a black cap {{at the top of}} the head, and a black tip at the end of the tail. Males generally have lighter caps than females. The face is white with black rims around the eyes and black around the nose and mouth.|$|E
5|$|The Central American <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkey</b> is omnivorous. Its diet {{includes}} {{insects and}} insect larvae (especially grasshoppers and caterpillars), spiders, fruit, leaves, bark, flowers and nectar. It also eats small vertebrates, including bats, birds, lizards and tree frogs. It finds its food foraging through the lower and middle {{levels of the}} forest, typically between fifteen and thirty feet high. Two-thirds to three-quarters of each day is spent foraging for food. It has difficulty finding its desired food late in the wet season, when fewer arthropods are available.|$|E

50|$|<b>Squirrel</b> <b>monkeys</b> {{grow from}} 25 to 35 cm long, plus a 35 to 42 cm tail. Male <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkeys</b> weigh 750 to 1100 g. Females weigh 500 to 750 g. Both {{males and females}} are {{equipped}} with long and hairy tails, flat nails, and pointed claws.|$|R
5|$|One popular {{theory is}} that {{squirrel}} monkeys did live in Colombia during the late Miocene or Pliocene and these squirrel monkeys migrated to Central America, becoming the ancestors of the current Central American species. According to this theory, the Guatemalan black howler migrated to Central America around the same time. Passage through the isthmus of Panama later closed due to rising oceans, and eventually opened up to another wave of migration about 2 million years ago. These later migrants, ancestors to modern populations of white-headed capuchins, mantled howlers and Geoffroy's spider monkeys, out-competed the earlier migrants, leading to the small range of the Central American <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkey</b> and Guatemalan black howler.|$|E
5|$|The Central American <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkey</b> is {{arboreal}} and diurnal, {{and most}} often {{moves through the}} trees on four legs (quadrupedal locomotion). It lives in groups containing several adult males, adult females and juveniles. The group size tends to be smaller than that of South American squirrel monkeys, but is still larger than for many other New World monkey species. The group generally numbers between 20 and 75 monkeys, {{with a mean of}} 41 monkeys. Groups in excess of 100 sometimes occur, but these are believed to be temporary mergers of two groups. On average, groups contain about 60% more females than males.|$|E
5|$|The rostral migratory stream (RMS) is a {{specialized}} migratory route {{found in the}} brain of some animals along which neuronal precursors that originated in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the brain migrate to reach the main olfactory bulb (OB). The importance of the RMS lies {{in its ability to}} refine and even change an animal's sensitivity to smells, which explains its importance and larger size in the rodent brain as compared to the human brain, as our olfactory sense is not as developed. This pathway has been studied in the rodent, rabbit, and both the <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkey</b> and rhesus monkey. When the neurons reach the OB they differentiate into GABAergic interneurons as they are integrated into either the granule cell layer or periglomerular layer.|$|E

In the following experiments, the vestibular-visual conflict in the pitch plane was given to the chair-restrained (upright position) <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkeys.</b> Results of this study showed that the existence of otolith afferents, which continually signal the directional change of gravity and linear acceleration vectors, was necessary for the elicitation of emesis by the sensory conflict in pitch...|$|R
5000|$|Adults reach {{a length}} of between 266 and 291 mm, {{excluding}} tail, and a weight between 600 and 950 g. [...] The tail is longer than the body, and between 362 and 389 mm in length. As with other <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkeys,</b> there is considerable sexual dimorphism. On average, males weigh 16% more than females. Males have an average body weight of 829 g and females average 695 g. <b>Squirrel</b> <b>monkeys</b> have the largest brains of all primates relative to their body size; the Central American <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkey's</b> brain weighs about 25.7 g, or about 4% of its body weight. Unlike larger relatives, such as the capuchin, spider and howler <b>monkeys,</b> Central American <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkeys</b> {{do not have a}} fully prehensile tail, except as newborn infants, and the tail is primarily used to help with balance.|$|R
5|$|The {{breeding}} {{season for the}} Central American <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkey</b> is in September. All females come into estrus at virtually the same time. A month or two before the {{breeding season}} begins, males become larger. This is not due to extra muscle, but to altered water balance within the male's body. This is caused by conversion of the male hormone testosterone into estrogen; thus the more testosterone a male produces, the more he grows {{in advance of the}} breeding season. Since males within a group have not been observed fighting over access to females during breeding season, nor attempting to force females to copulate with them, it is believed that female choice determines which males get to breed with females. Females tend to prefer the males that expand the most in advance of breeding season. This may be because the most enlarged males are generally the oldest and the most effective at detecting predators, or it may be a case of runaway intersexual selection.|$|E
5|$|One {{particular}} aspect {{that led}} to disagreement amongst {{the cast and crew}} was the genuine killing of animals. Kerman stormed off the set while the death of the coatimundi was filmed, and Yorke refused to participate in the killing of a pig, which he was originally scripted to execute, leaving the duty to Luca Barbareschi. When it was shot, the squeal of the pig subsequently caused Yorke to botch a long monologue, and retakes were not an option because they had no access to additional pigs. Perry Pirkanen cried after filming the butchering of a turtle, and crew members vomited off camera when a <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkey</b> was killed for the film. Actress Francesca Ciardi also objected to the film's sexual content {{and did not want to}} bare her breasts during the sex scene between her and Carl Yorke. When she refused to comply with Deodato's direction, he dragged her off the set and screamed at her in Italian. She had earlier suggested that she and Yorke actually have sex in the jungle before filming in order to relieve the tension of the upcoming scene. When Yorke declined, she grew upset with him, alienating him for the rest of the shoot.|$|E
5|$|The {{film is a}} {{depiction}} of various scenes, usually violent or bizarre, that somehow relate to hunting. Each scenario is presented {{one after the other}} with little regard for narrative continuity. The opening scene introduces a Patagonian hunter who hunts stags to survive. The opening credits play over as he chases after a stag, which he ultimately shoots, kills, and beheads. Afterwards, one of the numerous scenes of anti-hunting gatherings is shown, this one in Cape Cod. The attention quickly shifts to wildlife hunting, where a monkey is killed by a leopard, and then a <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkey</b> by an anaconda. The theme changes again to the social hunt of wild game in Australia and Africa. Aborigines hunt kangaroos and other large marsupials with spears and giant bats with boomerangs. Indigenous tribes of Africa hunt large game, including antelope, buffalo, and elephants, in the savanna. Religious ceremonies are also shown, where the African hunters proceed to suck fresh blood from the entrails of an antelope, and the Australian aborigines symbolically bury their prey in dust to placate the spirits of the animals. Lastly, two brothers are arrested after partaking in a form of ritual post-mortem cannibalism of three of their relatives to acquire the hunting skills of the dead.|$|E

50|$|<b>Squirrel</b> <b>monkeys</b> (Saimiri sciureus) {{are highly}} social New World monkeys found in Central and South America which exhibit various alarm calls to warn other {{individuals}} of potential predators. McCowan et al. (2000) researched {{the role of}} learning {{in the development of}} chuck call recognition in <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkeys,</b> hypothesizing that monkeys at different developmental stages (ages) respond preferentially to the chuck calls of familiar - yet genetically unrelated - companions as compared to those of unfamiliar individuals. The researchers conducted a controlled playback experiment on four different age classes of <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkeys</b> and found that infants did not appear to have any preference for the chuck calls of close social associates or other social group members, concluding that learning plays a role in chuck call recognition in <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkeys</b> and that infants gradually learn to acoustically recognize social companions within their group.|$|R
50|$|Back then, {{there were}} also native new world monkeys of North America. Some species {{including}} capuchin monkeys, spider <b>monkeys,</b> and/or <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkeys</b> could be reintroduced to warm and humid parts of North America, including Florida, etc., to fill the niche left behind be the native monkeys.

500|$|The Central American <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkey</b> is {{a member}} of the family Cebidae, the family of New World monkeys {{containing}} squirrel monkeys, capuchin monkeys, tamarins and marmosets. Within the family Cebidae, it {{is a member}} of the subfamily Saimiriinae, the subfamily containing squirrel monkeys. It is one of five recognized species of <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkey,</b> and the only species occurring outside South America. The Central American <b>Squirrel</b> <b>Monkey</b> is placed in genus Saimiri (Voigt, 1831) along with all the other <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkey</b> species. Among the squirrel monkeys, the Central American <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkey</b> is most closely related to the common <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkey</b> (Saimiri sciureus) and the bare-eared <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkey</b> (Saimiri ustus) and these three species form the S. sciureus species group. [...] The binomial name Saimiri oerstedii was given by Johannes Theodor Reinhardt in honor of his fellow Danish biologist Anders Sandøe Ørsted.|$|E
500|$|The Central American <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkey</b> or [...] (Saimiri oerstedii), {{also known}} as red-backed <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkey,</b> is a <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkey</b> species from the Pacific coast of Costa Rica and Panama.

500|$|Although South American {{species of}} {{squirrel}} monkeys often travel with and feed together with capuchin monkeys, the Central American <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkey</b> only rarely associates with the white-headed capuchin. This {{appears to be}} related to the fact that the food the Central American <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkey</b> eats is distributed in smaller, more dispersed patches than that of South American squirrel monkeys. As a result of the different food distribution, associating with capuchin monkeys would impose higher foraging costs for the Central American <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkey</b> than for their South American counterparts. In addition, while male white-headed capuchins are alert to predators, they devote more attention to detecting rival males than to detecting predators, and relatively less time to detecting predators than their South American counterparts. Therefore, associating with capuchins would provide less predator detection benefits and impose higher foraging costs on the Central American <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkey</b> than on South American squirrel monkeys. [...] An alternative explanation is that cspuchin groups are larger than <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkey</b> groups in Central America, but in South America the <b>squirrel</b> <b>monkey</b> groups are larger.|$|E
