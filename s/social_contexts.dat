40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{relative}} contributions of individual attributes, organizational and job characteristics, and the <b>social</b> <b>context</b> {{of the organization}} in explaining variation in employee reactions to performance appraisal. The performance appraisal process has become a powerful institution within the employment relationship, having significant impact upon employees. ^ Building on Murphy and Cleveland 2 ̆ 7 s comprehensive analysis (1995), it addresses the theoretical and empirical gaps in the literature through analysis of performance appraisal alongside <b>social</b> <b>context,</b> organizational structure, job-specific factors, individual differences, dyad similarity, and job-related attitudes. A valuable outcome {{of the study is}} the development of five reliable scales, measuring two dimensions of organizational-level <b>social</b> <b>context,</b> two dimensions of job-level <b>social</b> <b>context,</b> and one of the satisfaction dependent variable. ^ Results from a survey administered in four nonprofit organizations (N= 250) have identified five key independent variables that influence attitudes about performance evaluation, and specifically, how <b>social</b> <b>context</b> operates and where it fits into the equation. Multiple regressions of the data confirm that employees are more satisfied with the appraisal process when they experience a low-control and high-team <b>social</b> <b>context</b> within the organization, high job satisfaction, autonomy in the job, and gender similarity with the supervisor. Team-oriented job-level <b>social</b> <b>context</b> was not directly related to satisfaction with appraisal process but was a strong antecedent to job satisfaction. Employees 2 ̆ 7 satisfaction with their most recent appraisal was directly affected by job satisfaction and control. Major findings include: (1) <b>social</b> <b>context</b> operates uniquely at the organizational and job levels, (2) many dimensions of <b>social</b> <b>context</b> exist and univariate, directional hypotheses do not realistically illustrate its complexity and (3) <b>social</b> <b>context</b> provides the linkage between race, structural characteristics, job satisfaction and appraisal satisfaction and therefore, serves a career-enhancing function. ...|$|R

We conducted structured interviews with key informants across nine U. S. states. Factor analysis, regression and hierarchical cluster analysis were used to characterize <b>social</b> <b>context</b> across communities and relate it to key informant evaluations of progress toward fire adaptation. Our results advance methods to systematically document how <b>social</b> <b>context</b> influences local wildfire adaptation by: (1) examining a preliminary set of quantitative key-informant measures for gauging <b>social</b> <b>context</b> across a range of WUI communities; (2) identifying related elements of <b>social</b> <b>context</b> that may collectively influence wildfire adaptations; (3) providing preliminary statistical evidence that highly related elements of local <b>social</b> <b>context</b> are correlated with expert assessment of local populations’ adaptations to wildfire; and (4) identifying differences in <b>social</b> <b>context</b> characteristics across a sample of western USA WUI communities.

30|$|The first {{component}} of the model is the orange nucleus circle, representing the nature of CSR in Vietnam. From the theoretical lens of symbolic interactionism, our model starts with an assumption that CSR is a dynamic process of sense making, decision-making and implementation, and the mechanism determining how CSR is understood, manifested and implemented within an organization is strongly influenced by the <b>social</b> <b>context</b> in which business operates (Örtenblad, 2016). In essence, the logic of this thinking is that organizational entities reside in nested arrangements and their behaviours are the results of contextual influences emanating from different levels of <b>social</b> <b>context</b> (Rousseau & Fried, 2001). However, the definitions of <b>social</b> <b>context</b> and its multilevel systems are admittedly broad and vague (Tilt, 2016). Therefore, this study explicitly adapts the model of Athanasopoulou and Selsky (2015) in which the <b>social</b> <b>context</b> is represented in the three layers of circles surrounding the core component, namely the individual level, organizational <b>context</b> and external <b>social</b> <b>context,</b> to strengthen the conceptual foundations.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the effects of a}} threatening and a safe <b>social</b> <b>context</b> on learning pain-related fear, a key factor in the development and maintenance of chronic pain. We measured self-reported pain intensity, pain expectancy, pain-related fear (verbal ratings and eyeblink startle responses), and behavioral measures of avoidance (movement-onset latency and duration) using an established differential voluntary movement fear conditioning paradigm. Participants (N = 42) performed different movements with a joystick: during fear acquisition, movement in one direction (CS+) was followed by a painful stimulus (pain-US) whereas movement in another direction (CS-) was not. For participants in the threat group, an angry face was continuously presented in the background during the task, whereas in the safe group, a happy face was presented. During the extinction phase the pain-US was omitted. As compared to the safe <b>social</b> <b>context,</b> a threatening <b>social</b> <b>context</b> led to increased contextual fear and facilitated differentiation between CS+ and CS- movements regarding self-reported pain expectancy, fear of pain, eyeblink startle responses, and movement-onset latency. In contrast, self-reported pain intensity was not affected by <b>social</b> <b>context.</b> These data support the modulation of pain-related fear by <b>social</b> <b>context.</b> Perspective: A threatening <b>social</b> <b>context</b> leads to stronger acquisition of (pain-related) fear and simultaneous contextual fear but does not affect pain intensity ratings. This knowledge may aid in the prevention of chronic pain and anxiety disorders and shows that <b>social</b> <b>context</b> might modulate pain-related fear without immediately affecting pain intensity itself.

This thesis makes several important research contributions. Firstly, the proposed framework provides an ontology-based <b>social</b> <b>context</b> model, including an upper <b>social</b> <b>context</b> ontology which can be customised and specialised to form domain-specific ontologies. Secondly, the iii framework provides an ontology-based approach to define rules for deriving, deducing and abstracting <b>social</b> <b>context</b> information.

Thirdly, the framework provides an ontology-based socially-aware access control policy model and language for owners to control access to their information {{at different levels of}} granularity. Fourthly, the framework also provides a way to model and represent runtime social interactions from both the domain- and player-perspectives to support mediated social interactions, and manage their adaptation to cope with the changes in user requirements and environments.

25|$|In {{educational}} psychology, {{qualitative research}} {{is used to}} address questions concerned with developing {{an understanding of the}} meaning and collecting nonnumerical relevant data to gain insights into particular phenomenon.

The psychometric properties of the OSC measure were assessed in a nationwide study of 1, 154 clinicians in 100 mental health clinics with a second-order confirmatory factor analysis of clinician responses, estimates of scale reliabilities, and indices of within-clinic agreement and between-clinic differences among clinicians. Finally, the paper illustrates the use of nationwide norms in describing the OSC profiles of individual mental health clinics and examines the cross-level association of organizational-level culture and climate with clinician-level work attitudes...|$|R
