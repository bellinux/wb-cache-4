In 2017, he explained, [...] "It was an important watershed album for the band, {{and it was at}} the beginning of us struggling to find gigs in the States.

He {{felt that the}} movie [...] "does ponder some pretty deep questions about the collapse and persistence of human civilization". Dana Stevens of Slate wrote that the movie lost its way around the hour mark, noting that [...] "the Infected just aren't that scary." [...] NPR critic Bob Mondello noted the film's subtext concerning global terrorism and that this aspect made the film fit in perfectly with other, more direct cinematic explorations of the subject. Richard Roeper gave the film a positive review on the television program At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper, commending Will Smith as being in [...] "prime form", also <b>saying</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> [...] "some amazing sequences" [...] {{and that there was}} [...] "a pretty heavy screenplay for an action film." [...] The film has been criticized for diverging from Matheson's novel, especially in its portrayal of a specifically Christian theme. Much of the negative criticism concerned the film's third act, with some critics favoring the alternative ending in the DVD release. Doug Walker said the alternate ending was [...] "thought provoking", and the theatrical ending was [...] "a betrayal" [...] and [...] "castration".|$|E
500|$|An {{official}} novelization of the game, titled God of War, {{was announced}} in July 2009, along with a novelization of God of War II. It was written by Matthew Stover and Robert E. Vardeman, and was published on May 25, 2010, by Del Rey Books. In an interview for Play magazine, Vardeman said a mythology book written in the 1930s got him interested in Greek mythology, {{and the chance to}} work on the God of War novel [...] "was an opportunity not to be missed". He said giving the readers a solid plot foundation was necessary and the novel required extra material so that it did not simply follow the action of the game. Although he has not played the game, he said God of War was based on the traditional Edith Hamilton Greek mythology, essentially [...] "the accepted mythology on steroids". Vardeman called Kratos a substantial character, continuing, [...] "This conflict of motives makes him a great, if troubled, hero." [...] He confirmed his work on the second God of War novel, <b>saying</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> many potential story ideas for Kratos and that [...] "it would be a shame" [...] if there were not additional books to fill in the details of his quests, such as stories of the time while he was a minion of Ares or before he met the Barbarian King.|$|E
