5|$|The Lakshmana Temple of Khajuraho is {{dedicated}} to Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. Though three-faced, an inscription in the temple suggests {{that it should be}} considered four-faced. It also records a legend where Kapila and other demons conjoined together in a single form and were blessed by Brahma that only <b>someone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same form could slay them so Vishnu took the form of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. The presence of the Lakshamana Temple in Khajuraho suggests worship in the Chandela kingdom in the 10th century.|$|E

He won only nine games. Ruffing often had difficulty pitching more than five innings in a game. <b>Someone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Red Sox organization suggested to Ruffing that he should try to gain weight by drinking beer, which saw him grow from 185pounds (84kg) to 240 pounds (110kg).|$|E
5|$|The letter {{caused a}} stir in the upper echelons of the Nazi regime. In his diaries, Joseph Goebbels, Reich Minister of Propaganda, assumed that <b>someone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> German Catholic church {{organisation}} wrote, and distributed, the letter. A bounty of 100,000 Reichsmark, posted by the Führer himself, revealed no clues to its origins. Even the strongest repressive actions could not hinder {{the distribution of the}} letter.|$|E

5|$|When {{you throw}} a {{cat in the}} oven, it's easy to have <b>someone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{orchestra}} slam a hammer down on an anvil, scaring {{the hell out of}} everyone. The hard part is manipulating the story and accenting the characters. In the beginning, when Todd is laying down the rules, there's a certain repetitive thematic idea you hear. You hear the same music when Dussander is turning the tables on Todd, which makes you remember the first scene... You hope people are subliminally making the connection that the tables are turning back and forth.|$|E
5|$|As the day wears on, Michael becomes {{convinced}} {{that what happened}} to his office is a hate crime and an act of terrorism. Believing it to have been perpetrated by <b>someone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> office, he begins to lose his faith in his employees, whom he considers his friends. Michael tries talking to his former boss Ed Truck (Ken Howard), who tells him that he does not need to have his employees be his friends. But his mood changes drastically when he finds out the prank was carried out by his obnoxious friend Todd Packer (David Koechner). Michael instantly finds the joke hilarious, and his faith in his friends is restored. At the end of the day, Jim is cheered up when he finds that all seven of his voicemail messages were left by Pam throughout the day. Jim is seen driving home, and Pam's voicemails act as a voice-over, closing out the episode.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{reinforcing}} Luso-Rhodesian relations, the Lisbon {{appointment was}} designed to secure the African nation a diplomatic foothold in Europe outside of Britain's reach and to help Salisbury find new trading partners and diplomatic allies on the continent. Among other things, the Rhodesians intended {{to make up the}} shortfalls in military equipment caused by the undeclared Anglo-American arms embargo. Reedman, the former minister for immigration and tourism, was also a retired officer of the British Royal Air Force (where he had been involved in bomber research), and an experienced engineer and businessman: all the right ingredients, the government thought, for <b>someone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> position to source European aircraft, weapons and other equipment, while also representing Rhodesian interests in mainland Europe.|$|E

5|$|Later that evening, Jiminy and {{his parents}} {{convince}} a couple {{to give up some}} goods in exchange for a tonic that will supposedly make them immune to a plague. He soon discovers that his father switched Rumpelstiltskin's tonic with the one they sold, and finds that the couple have been turned into dolls. Even worse, he then discovers that the couple were the parents of the young boy he spoke to earlier. Having realized what he has done, Jiminy makes a wish and receives an answer from The Blue Fairy, who shows up to give him his one true wish: becoming a cricket. Jiminy is also told that {{he has a chance to}} help <b>someone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future, starting with the young boy, who would grow up to be Gepetto. As for the cursed dolls, they end up as a collection at Mr. Gold's (Carlyle) pawn shop.|$|E
5|$|Stone {{wanted to}} {{recreate}} the Kennedy assassination in Dealey Plaza. His producers had to pay the Dallas City Council {{a substantial amount of}} money to hire police to reroute traffic and close streets for three weeks. He only had ten days to shoot all of the footage he needed and so he used seven cameras (two 35mm and five 16mm) and 14 film stocks. Getting permission to shoot in the Texas School Book Depository was more difficult. They had to pay $50,000 to put <b>someone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> window from which Oswald was supposed to have shot Kennedy. They were allowed to film in that location only between certain hours with only five people on the floor at one time: the camera crew, an actor and Stone. Co-producer Clayton Townsend has said that the hardest part was getting the permission to restore the building to the way it looked back in 1963. It took five months of negotiation.|$|E
5|$|Walsh missed {{two weeks}} of the 1991–92 {{pre-season}} with a groin injury, and on his first game back for the reserves at White Hart Lane punched reserve team manager Ray Clemence in the face after Clemence substituted him off after an hour. Walsh was suspended for two weeks and upon his return was loaned out to Queens Park Rangers for a month. QPR manager Gerry Francis wanted to make the signing a permanent one, but the club were unable to afford the £800,000 fee Spurs had asked for. After returning to Spurs he again punched <b>someone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face, this time a supporter who had shouted abuse to Walsh on the pitch after a game against Norwich City. He ended the campaign with three goals in 22 starts and 15 substitute appearances.|$|E

Michael spreads a rumor that Oscar is the voice of the Taco Bell dog, a chihuahua used as an advertising character in the 1990s and 2000s for the restaurant chain Taco Bell. Michael also claims Angela is dating a billionaire who manages a Quiznos, a fast-food submarine sandwich restaurant. Michael starts a rumor that <b>someone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> office is a J.Crew model, originally referring to himself, although everyone believes it to be Jim. J.Crew is an American clothing and accessories retailer.|$|E
5|$|Later, Judge Donnelly {{is nearly}} killed when {{she sits on}} a needle filled with {{potassium}} chloride at her home; she is saved when Stabler and Benson rush her to the hospital. O'Halloran tells Stabler and Benson that a mosquito sucked the blood from the killer {{as he or she}} was rigging Zimmer's car, and that the DNA from the blood will likely implicate Harrison. As the DNA is later being processed, however, O'Halloran is stabbed and killed by <b>someone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forensics lab. Stabler arrives and sees on the computer screen that the DNA matches Stuckey just before Stuckey knocks him out from behind. Stuckey then answers Elliot's phone when Benson calls to say that Stabler went out for lunch and forgot his phone. He then ties Stabler to a chair and starts torturing him. Stuckey admits he killed the woman at Coney Island in order to frame Harrison, and that he attacked Zimmer and Donnelly for embarrassing him. Benson arrives and is held at gunpoint by Stuckey, but she convinces Stuckey that she, too, hates Stabler and is in love with Stuckey. While Benson kisses Stuckey to distract him, Stabler kicks him from behind, allowing Benson to knock Stuckey out and free Stabler. When Stabler asks how Benson knew he was in trouble, Benson says that Stuckey told her he went out for sushi, which she knows that Stabler hates.|$|E
5|$|Rodrigues {{is taken}} to Nagasaki, where he is imprisoned with many Japanese converts. At a tribunal, he is told Catholic {{doctrine}} is anathema to Japan. Rodrigues demands to see governor Inoue Masashige, who he learns, to his dismay, is the old man seated before him {{in charge of the}} proceedings. Rodrigues is returned to prison, and Kichijiro soon arrives to be imprisoned as well. He explains to Rodrigues that court officials threatened him in order that he betray Rodrigues. Kichijiro then says he is a Christian and asks to be absolved of his betrayal through a confession, which Rodrigues reluctantly grants him. He later is released after being told to step on a fumi-e (a crudely carved crucifix), an act symbolizing rejection of the faith. Later, Rodrigues is brought under guard to the shoreline to await <b>someone.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> far distance, he witnesses an emaciated Garupe and three other prisoners approaching on the shoreline under separate guard. Still in the distance, the three other prisoners are taken offshore on a small boat and are about to be drowned from the boat one-by-one as an inducement to get Garupe to renounce his faith. Rodrigues is restrained by guards on shore as he watches Garupe refuse to apostatize. He then sees the desperate Garupe drowned next to the other three prisoners when he attempts to swim offshore trying to rescue the last prisoner from being drowned.|$|E

Justice League #18 introduces Firestorm, Element Woman and Atom as the newest members of the Justice League, as well as the Watchtower being hacked. It is revealed at the end of Justice League #20 that Atom is an agent of A.R.G.U.S. and is actually a member of the Justice League of America. She was chosen to act as a spy within the Justice League. In Justice League of America #4, Dr. Arthur Light is called in by A.R.G.U.S. to examine the Secret Society's communication coin. While doing so, it is manipulated from the other side causing Light to be enveloped in a white light, giving him powers. In Justice League of America #5, it is determined that the Secret Society's manor has stained glass with images of Pandora's Box, hinting at their interest in Pandora.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a blonde woman, played by model and actress Lauren Hastings (allegedly portraying Britney Spears), walking {{out of her house}} hand-in-hand with an {{unidentified}} man. The couple leaves in the woman's car (a silver Porsche) as Timberlake rolls down the window of a black Mercedes, from which he and his friend have been watching the woman. Timberlake breaks into the house by throwing a rock through a window and proceeds through the woman's house, with anti-gravity jumps and slides, not causing any other visible damage, except for kicking a picture frame of the woman across the living room. Then he searches some drawers and finds a video camera, while the driver of the car, Timbaland, signals for his female accomplice {{in the back of the}} car, played by model Kiana Bessa, to go in. She enters the house and goes with Timberlake to a bedroom, where she starts to undress and kiss him while being filmed. They stay in the bedroom for a moment; then the accomplice exits the house but Timberlake stays. As the blonde woman returns, he follows her around the house and hides in a closet as she showers. He gets closer to her and touches the glass surrounding the shower. The blonde woman senses <b>someone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> room and turns around, but Timberlake is gone. She leaves the bathroom and goes into her bedroom, where the video he made with his new lover plays on the television.|$|E
