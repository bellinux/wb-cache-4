500|$|In two {{interviews}} {{describing the}} series Chi's creators, Clamp, {{said it would}} be much easier if computers could <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> when they had errors. Chi is voiced by Rie Tanaka in the anime and Georgette Rose in its English counterpart. The manga and anime follow Hideki's find of Chi and their relationship, but differ in the storyline. Chi's critical reception has been mostly positive, with reviewers calling her [...] "cute". In addition to Chobits, she is also a crossover character in the series [...] and is referenced in other works.|$|E
500|$|On Valentine's Day 2003, {{which was}} {{the eve of the}} Iraqi {{invasion}} by the US and UK, Ono heard about a couple, Andrew and Christine Gale, who were holding a love-in protest in their tiny bedroom in Addingham, West Yorkshire. She phoned them and said, [...] "It's good to <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> We're supporting you. We're all sisters together." [...] The couple said that songs like [...] "Give Peace a Chance" [...] and [...] "Imagine" [...] inspired their protest. In 2004, Ono remade her song [...] "Everyman..... Everywoman....." [...] to support same-sex marriage, releasing remixes that included [...] "Every Man Has a Man Who Loves Him" [...] and [...] "Every Woman Has a Woman Who Loves Her".|$|E
500|$|People assume things, {{because as}} I said, I pull from my {{personal}} experiences {{to make my}} music... I never experienced [...] firsthand, but it's something I {{wanted to talk about}} ... and it's something that has happened to me in the past... As I said, I have a few deep, dark ones that I've kept stowed away in a closet for a minute... That's why I take this time to <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> guys and let you know really what it is... I will tell you that I loved [...] a lot and she obviously loved me; it just didn't work out. But cheating is not what caused the relationship to collide and crash. That ain't what broke it up.|$|E

500|$|The album {{received}} generally favorable reviews. Pete Johnson in the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "Dylan is a superbly eloquent {{writer of}} pop and folk songs with an unmatched ability to press complex ideas and iconoclastic philosophy into brief poetic lines and startling images." [...] The editor of Crawdaddy!, Paul Williams, reviewed Blonde on Blonde in July 1966: [...] "It is {{a cache of}} emotion, a well handled package of excellent music and better poetry, blended and meshed and ready {{to become part of}} your reality. Here is a man who will <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> a 1960s bard with electric lyre and color slides, but a truthful man with x-ray eyes you can look through if you want. All {{you have to do is}} listen." ...|$|E
500|$|Whytock and Ingram {{screened}} {{their version}} of Greed to studio executives, who responded favorably to it but worried that the tragic ending {{would be hard to}} sell to the public. Ingram then sent the 18-reel version to von Stroheim and told him, [...] "If you cut one more frame I shall never <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> again." [...] On April 10, 1924, the Goldwyn Company officially agreed to merge with Metro Pictures, putting von Stroheim's nemesis Thalberg directly in charge of Greed. Von Stroheim and Louis B. Mayer had a lengthy confrontation over the film's editing, which according to both men ended with von Stroheim claiming that all women were whores and Mayer punching him. Mayer disliked the film because of its lack of glamor, optimism or morality and considered it to be a guaranteed flop.|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{following}} {{the signing of}} the legislation, he visited each major island in the kingdom for a personal look at how the reciprocity treaty had affected his people. In a speech before an audience of Native Hawaiians at a Congregational church on Kauai, Kalākaua related his concerns, [...] "I will <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> of one of our great questions, which is the supply of people, not only to meet the requirements of all our industries but to assist in the increase of a Hawaiian population." [...] He wanted to bring in Austronesian immigrants from Asia-Pacific nations to save the declining population of the Hawaiian race from completely dying out. Prior labor immigration had been mostly unmarried men, and he hoped to attract unmarried women as potential wives for them, as well as bringing in family groups.|$|E

500|$|Hellyeah {{received}} generally positive reviews. William Ruhlmann of Allmusic {{awarded the}} album {{three and a}} half stars out of five, commenting; [...] "Their album is a competent example of its genre, in which Tribbett and Maxwell combine to create crushing riffs over the pummeling rhythm section of Paul, while Gray howls typically enraged, expletive-littered lyrics to songs". However, Ruhlmann believes Hellyeah is not a notable variation from members' previous bands. Blabbermouth.net reviewer Don Kaye awarded the album 7 out of 10, praising the track [...] "Matter of Time" [...] for its slashing main riff, and [...] "One Thing" [...] as it [...] "marches to the finish line with a rumbling, crunching wall of guitars worthy of Dimebag himself". Kaye thought that Hellyeah's first studio effort was not equal to any of its members' main output. KNAC contributor Andrew Depedro stated [...] "it's a set of good songs recorded by 5 accomplished musicians from diverse backgrounds not letting their pasts define them and those songs {{in one form or another}} <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> in different ways".|$|E
500|$|Chelsea manager José Mourinho {{used his}} pre-match {{interview}} {{to state that}} his previous wins in the tournament had changed the way that clubs approach the League Cup: [...] "Lots of teams have followed us since then when we took the League Cup as a real competition, as a real challenge. It is a big competition." [...] He separated the final from the league season, saying, [...] "I don't think if we win the cup final we will win the league, or if we lose it we will lose the league." [...] He refused to discuss the suspension of Matić, dismissing it with [...] "If I <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about that, I promise you I will be in big trouble". Despite opining that the two teams and the match officials would act fairly, he criticised players who dive, despite not naming any names. Mourinho also claimed that in after leaving Chelsea {{for the first time}} in September 2007, he was approached to manage Tottenham by chairman Daniel Levy, and again in 2012.|$|E
500|$|God of War {{received}} {{praise for}} its voice acting. Chris Sell of PAL Gaming Network {{stated that the}} voice acting is [...] "up there with the best" [...] in comparison to other games, and that the cut scenes are [...] "superbly voiced, but it’s the narrator {{of the story that}} is the most professionally convincing throughout." [...] Eric Blattberg of PlayStation Universe stated that the voice acting is a great feature of the game, that narrator Linda Hunt's [...] "authentic voice really helps set the attitude during the unbelievable ’s", and that Kratos [...] "acts and sounds like a badass." [...] Kristan Reed of Eurogamer wrote, [...] "Even the straight-laced voice work is handled with an expertise so sadly lacking in most other videogames." [...] Raymond M. Padilla of GameSpy, wrote that some of the voice acting and music tracks are overstated; one of his few dislikes in the game. Matt Leone of 1UP wrote that [...] "There's a mixture of in-game characters that <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and extremely nice CG sequences that show moments such as flashbacks, and it all blends together surprisingly well." ...|$|E

500|$|In February 2010 when {{accompanying}} the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on a three-day visit to Saudi Arabia, he said [...] "We feel that Saudi Arabia {{has a long}} and close relationship with Pakistan, that makes Saudi Arabia even more a valuable interlocutor for us. When we tell them about our experience, Saudi Arabia listens as somebody who is {{not in any way}} an enemy of Pakistan, but a friend of Pakistan and, therefore, will listen with sympathy and concern to a matter of this nature". He was asked whether India expected Saudi Arabia, given its close ties with Islamabad, to help address the terror threat from Pakistan. The remark about Saudi Arabia being a [...] "valuable interlocutor" [...] raised a strong reaction within the Indian political circle. The Pakistani press even went on to report that he had proposed that Saudi Arabia play a mediator's role in improving India's relationship with Pakistan. In response, Tharoor denied that 'interlocutor' meant 'mediator', and tweeted an explanation, saying, [...] "An [...] is someone you speak to. If I <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> you are my interlocutor. I mentioned the Saudis as our interlocutors, i.e. the people we are here to speak to".|$|E
500|$|In May 1796, Bonaparte {{detailed}} Sérurier {{to demonstrate}} with his division at Valenza {{while the rest}} of the army crossed the Po River near Piacenza. After the Battle of Lodi, Bonaparte divided the Army of Italy into a cavalry reserve and four divisions including one under Sérurier. During the Battle of Borghetto on 30 May, his division feinted at the upper Mincio River while other troops made the main thrust against Johann Peter Beaulieu's army at Valeggio sul Mincio. On 1 June, the 4,700-strong division took position on the north side of the fortress of Mantua. On 8 June, Sérurier, artillerist Augustin de Lespinasse and engineer Francois, marquis de Chasseloup-Laubat reconnoitered the fortress. Two days later Bonaparte put Sérurier in charge of the Siege of Mantua with about 8,000 soldiers. Soon after, Bonaparte wrote to the French Directory, [...] "I shall not <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> of the conduct of the intrepid General Sérurier, whose military reputation is established, and to whom we owe, amongst other things since the campaign began, the victory of Mondovi". Because of the approach of Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser's Austrian army, the siege was raised on 31 July, the heavy cannons were buried and the division withdrew behind the Oglio River. Sérurier then became feverish with malaria, so that Fiorella and Gaspard Amédée Gardanne directed the division during the Battle of Castiglione. The general returned to France to recuperate. On 14 August 1796 Bonaparte wrote a confidential assessment of his generals to the Directory. In it he wrote, [...] "Sérurier, fights like a private, takes nothing on himself, firm; has not a good enough opinion of his troops, is ill".|$|E
500|$|Over {{the next}} several months, the ship was {{upgraded}} with the most advanced weaponry available; among the new weapons systems installed were four Mk 141 quad cell launchers for 16 RGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles, eight Mk 143 Armored Box Launcher mounts for 32 BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missiles, and a quartet of Phalanx Close In Weapon System Gatling guns for defense against enemy anti-ship missiles and enemy aircraft. Also included in her modernization were upgrades to radar and fire control systems for her guns and missiles, and improved electronic warfare capabilities. During the modernization Missouris [...] bell, which {{had been removed from}} the battleship and sent to Jefferson City, Missouri for sesquicentennial celebrations in the state, was formally returned to the battleship in advance of her recommissioning. Missouri was formally recommissioned in San Francisco on 10 May 1986. [...] "This is a day to celebrate the rebirth of American sea power," [...] Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger told an audience of 10,000 at the recommissioning ceremony, instructing the crew to [...] "listen for the footsteps of those who have gone before you. They <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> of honor and the importance of duty. They remind you of your own traditions." [...] Also present at the recommissioning ceremony was Missouri governor John Ashcroft, U.S. Senator Pete Wilson, Secretary of the Navy John Lehman, San Francisco mayor Dianne Feinstein, and Margaret Truman, (who christened the ship in 1943) gave a short speech especially aimed at the ship's crew, which ended with [...] "now take care of my baby". [...] Her remarks were met with rounds of sincere applause from the crew.|$|E

2500|$|Shrimpton {{believes}} that the apparent indifference of earlier authors {{was due to the}} general hatred by other Greeks against the Thebans who had medized (i.e. allied with the Persians) in the second Persian invasion in 480 BC and again in 368 BC. Athenians, in particular, held a special contempt for Thebes due to the latter's actions in the Peloponnesian War; as well as the Thebans' destruction of Plataea in 373 BC, and the invasion of the Athenian-allied Boeotian city of Oropus in 366 BC. Demosthenes records this sentiment very clearly in a disclaimer in his speech On the Navy (354 BC): [...] "It is difficult to <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about , because you have such a hearty dislike of them that you would not care to hear any good of them, even if it were true." ...|$|E

The Duchess strictly adhered to etiquette and her position, being characterised by a brother-in-law as [...] "accustomed to authority." [...] She was known for her abrasive personality; her granddaughter-in-law wrote that she [...] "was not altogether easy to get on with," [...] whilst another referred to her as [...] "an unpleasant woman."

[...] The Chamberlain just has time to prepare Ondine for her reception with the king. Ondine is particularly advised not to mention the wart on the king's nose. [...] Ondine tactlessly mentions that the Chamberlain's hand is damp and constantly interrupts him to talk to Bertram with whom she immediately establishes a rapport. [...] At the king's reception Ondine cannot take her eyes off Bertha. [...] She accuses Bertha of trying to steal Hans from her.
