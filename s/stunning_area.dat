40|$|This {{work was}} carried out with the {{objective}} to implement a computational model for simulating the dynamics of an industrial slaughtering for swine. Modeled real system belongs the Frimesa enterprise, located in Medianeira city, Paraná State, Brazil. Implemented model was classified as: dynamic, discrete and stochastic, and simulates thirty-four unity operations. For model implementation it was employed the simulation language EXTEND™. Model validation {{was carried out}} comparing data related to five operational shifts, when it was slaughtered 1, 346, 1, 630, 1, 360, 1, 585 and 1, 550 pigs, respectively. As contrasting parameters between data gotten from real system and generated by model, it was selected the following variables: (i) spent operational time; (ii) spent time from <b>stunning</b> <b>area</b> to scrap machine, (iii) spent time from <b>stunning</b> <b>area</b> to cold storage chamber; (iv) number of re-inspected carcasses; and (v) final number of edible slaughtered swine. At model validation was evidenced that for spent operational time averages, according to Tukey's test, at the significance level of 1 %, it was not detected statistical differences between real system and generated simulation model data. According to this and other analyses, lead {{to the conclusion that}} model and system outcomes were in good agreement. Furthering, two sensitivity were carried out. In the first it was modified the number of swine to be slaughtered from 1, 000 to 2, 000. It was observed that spent operational time increase from 6. 20 to 10. 20 h. At the second, it was simulated the slaughter of 1, 340 pigs, and was varied processing rates from 300 to 600 pigs per hour, at this situation operational times decreased from 8. 10 to 7. 40 h, respectively. © 2006 SBCTA...|$|E
40|$|The study {{hypothesis}} was that pre-slaughter handling is not conducted {{in such a}} way that pigs can be considered humanely slaughtered, nor is it conducive to promoting those properties of fresh meat that could enhance pork quality. The 1 st phase of the investigation was aimed at confirming the present compliance level within the prescribed norms. To this end the importance of stunning induction requirements for effective electrical stunning, the welfare implications relating to the pre-slaughter handling of pigs and the stunning and sticking techniques were investigated. Pre-slaughter welfare of the pigs at the abattoir was found to be influenced at the outset by the origin and type of pig slaughtered, the daily throughput range of pigs and the type of abattoir involved. A disappointing pre-arrival aspect was that deficiencies in road motor vehicles were observed while off-loading pigs. Through poor design or lack of maintenance, another factor that hampered free movement of pigs was the off-loading facilities. The nature of animal behaviour in the pens, in the passages and when going into the <b>stunning</b> <b>area</b> was directly related to the pig handling efficiency and to the nature and extent of design and maintenance problems with equipment. None of the abattoirs had a well designed in-feed to a well planned <b>stunning</b> <b>area</b> / facility, and a very high level of pig pre-slaughter stress prevailed. The optimum position of the electrodes is virtually impossible to attain under practical conditions and the practice of repeat application of electrical stunning is common. Of the total sample size (n = 1175), 34 % were difficult to shackle, 90 % of these being from the abattoirs tending to slaughter more routinely a wide range of different sized pigs. In this survey 149 pigs (13 %) required more than a single sticking attempt to bleed out properly, considerably higher than in other published reports...|$|E
40|$|Research {{was carried}} out on 260 pigs that were {{slaughtered}} in 12 batches in the slaughter facilities of ID-DLO at Zeist. The practical circumstances were highly standardized. The 'animals' meat quality was good with only little variation; 46 animals showed a 'slightly' aberrant quality and 6 'slight' DFD. Carcasses within the quality categories 'PSE' and 'slight' PSE did not occur. Statistically significant effects on meat quality could be shown {{for the duration of}} the resting period before slaughter and the muscular contractions occurring while stunning, shackling and exsanguination, despite the minor variation in pork quality under standardization. A longer resting period before slaughter induced significantly lower temperatures in the m. semimembranosus and the loin at 45 min post mortem and a slightly higher ultimate pH, accompanied by a somewhat darker colour (24 hr post mortem). A connection between the animal's behaviour at the fattening station and ultimate pork quality could not be shown. The same counts for fighting in the resting pen of the slaughter house and the pig's behaviour in the <b>stunning</b> <b>area.</b> Muscular contractions during and after stunning had a negative effect on pork quality, causing a more rapid drop in pH, a faster development of rigor mortis and a reduced water holding capacity. An imperfect electrical stunning procedure caused an increase in muscular contractions...|$|E

40|$|Este trabalho teve como objetivo implementar um modelo computacional para simular a dinÃmica operacional da linha {{industrial}} de abate de suÃno, a partir de informaÃÃes do sistema real, pertencente ao FrigorÃfico FRIMESA, sediado no municÃpio de Medianeira, Estado do ParanÃ. Foi implementado um modelo computacional do tipo dinÃmico, discreto e estocÃstico. O modelo simula trinta e quatro operaÃÃes unitÃrias e foi implementado com o uso da linguagem de simulaÃÃo EXTENDTM. Para validaÃÃo do modelo foram coletados dados relativos a cinco dias de operaÃÃo em que foram abatidos 1. 346, 1. 630, 1. 360, 1. 585 e 1. 550 suÃnos. Como parÃmetros de comparaÃÃo entre os dados obtidos a partir do sistema e gerados pelo modelo foram selecionadas as seguintes variÃveis: (i) tempo de duraÃÃo da operaÃÃo; (ii) tempo de deslocamento da insensibilizaÃÃo a depiladeira, (iii) tempo de deslocamento da insensibilizaÃÃo Ã cÃmara fria; (iv) nÃmero de carcaÃas re-inspecionadas, e (v) nÃmero final de carcaÃas obtidas. Na validaÃÃo do modelo foi constatado que para a variÃvel tempo de duraÃÃo da operaÃÃo por meio do teste Tukey, ao nÃvel de significÃncia de 1 %, nÃo foram detectadas diferenÃas estatÃsticas entre os valores obtidos do sistema real e os gerados pelo modelo de simulaÃÃo. Sendo assim, foram realizadas duas anÃlises de sensibilidade. Na primeira ao alterar o nÃmero de suÃnos a abater de 1. 000 para 2. 000 os tempos de duraÃÃo da operaÃÃo variaram de 6, 20 a 10, 10 h, respectivamente. Para a segunda ao abater 1. 346 suÃnos e proceder a alteraÃÃo das velocidades das nÃrias de 300 para 600 animais por hora, os tempos de duraÃÃo da operaÃÃo alteraram para 8, 10 e 7, 40 h, respectivamente.

40|$|The 1972 - 1973 rains in {{northern}} Ethiopia were well below average and an ensuing drought caused crop failure and livelihood loss amongst the farming and nomadic populations. Experienced conservationists had already warned, {{even before this}} drought, that lack of a national landuse plan and of indigenous traditions or programmes of {{soil and water conservation}} (SWC), together with uncontrolled and unregulated cultivation on any slope where there was soil, were resulting in unsustainably high soil erosion, and excessive degradation of the land cover. This was thought to be spiralling downwards to a catastrophe, which would have an adverse impact on the rural economies that provided much of the food for the country. The effect of that drought exacerbated a desperate situation. The upland plateau region of Tigray (or Tigre, Tigrai) from 2000 to 4000 m a. s. l. was particularly badly hit as rainfed farming communities had no stored reserves. The UK response to this disaster in 1974 was a long-term technical assistance (TA) package - the Tigrai Rural Development Study (TRDS) that made in-depth baseline studies on soil conditions, geomorphology, landuse planning, livestock, vegetation and range ecology, surface and groundwater resources, demography, the rural economy, and institutions. Demonstrations in SWC and exclosing land were key interventions. Civil war forced cessation of the TA work in 1976 but the Tigray people began to initiate change and since then have made remarkable institutional reforms, applied SWC measures over large parts of upland Tigray and transformed a degraded landscape into a productive one where scars of the past are being healed. The TRDS team had taken many landscape photographs for monitoring purposes in this scenically <b>stunning</b> <b>area.</b> Repeat photography analysis at these sites in connection with advanced geomorphological research all over Tigray was able to provide a semi-quantitative assessment of change in the region. The Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and particularly changes in C (cover) and P (management) factors was applied to assess change. The study indicates {{that there has been a}} positive change to the landscape due to improved vegetation cover and introduction of physical SWC structures. The USLE application indicates that over a large area the current average soil loss would be around 68 % of its 1975 rate. Whilst central gullying had increased dramatically in several areas, and some remnant forests were being degraded illegally, the repeat photography exercise demonstrated that there is a strong natural resilience in soils and vegetation allowing recovery from what appeared to be a quite hopeless and terminal situation and that SWC interventions are, as long claimed, highly appropriate...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} measure {{behaviour}} {{and knowledge of}} the relationships between temperament, stress and productivity in livestock can be utilised in improving livestock production systems, minimising stress and maximising ease of handling and efficiency of production. This research aimed to further the understanding of behavioural reactivity in sheep and investigate links between reactivity, carcass composition and meat quality. This was achieved with a combination of experimental trials and interviews of livestock transporters. Evidence to support the concept of temperament and behavioural reactivity was gathered across the studies. Repeatable differences between sheep were demonstrated, with moderate to strong correlations between some behavioural tests and links between reactivity and physiological indices of stress. Heritability estimates of up to 0. 20 were reported; combined with significant breed effects on reactivity this provides evidence of an inherent genetic component of behavioural reactivity. Sheep experience was rated as very important by livestock transporters. Age and experience, although confounded, also appeared to be important in the experimental trials. Older, more experienced lambs were less reactive and their behaviour more repeatable than when measured at a younger age. Although all of the behaviours investigated contributed to overall reactivity, restrained and unrestrained tests are only weakly correlated, indicating that these tests measure distinctly different components of behaviour. A consistent finding in the literature review and experimental chapters was greater reactivity in ewes compared to wethers, although livestock transporters indicated that sex was of minimal importance and ewes and wethers were behaviourally indistinguishable when handled as a mob. Few phenotypic or genetic relationships were found between the behaviours and carcass traits in initial analysis of an industry research flock dataset. However, in an experimental trial behavioural reactivity was related to carcass quality, albeit opposite to the relationship expected, with higher reactivity being associated with better loin pH. Lambs that were more reactive at behavioural testing appeared to be stressed in lairage, most likely as they were moved to the <b>stunning</b> <b>area,</b> triggering lactic acid production, resulting in lower loin pH 24 hours post slaughter. Methodological advances were made during this research. The first of these was in regards to the measurement of flight speed, validating this behavioural test in sheep and assessing the appropriate distance for use in this species. This thesis also assessed the usefulness of face cover score and hairline position as indicators for a variety of measures of behavioural reactivity. The results give strong evidence against the future use of facial hair patterning as an indicator for behaviour in this species. These results show that behavioural reactivity on farm, combining flight speed and restrained tests and measured later in life (after weaning), can be used to predict the reaction of the sheep at slaughter. The complex phenomenon of reactivity was successfully divided into its components, significantly advancing the understanding of behaviour in sheep. Further work is necessary to confirm these results in a variety of flocks and to establish the links between individual behavioural tests and stress. Greater understanding of the relationships between the behavioural and physiological responses to stress will improve both farm productivity and animal welfare. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Geological {{formations}} such as entire mountain ranges, individual {{peaks and}} associated land formations {{are the foundation}} of tourist attractions {{in many parts of}} the world. Mount Kosciuszko, continental Australia's highest peak at 2228 masl, is the most assessable of the 'seven continental summits' and is the key attraction for visitation to the Snowy Mountains region in south-eastern Australia. This paper discusses the history of visitor use of the 'top of Australia' and the strategies used to managing this use. Attracted by the notion of scaling the continents highest point as well the <b>area's</b> <b>stunning</b> landscapes and scenery, tourist have been visiting the region for about 100 years, with a road to the summit completed in 1909. By the 1980 s the road was closed to all but management vehicles and new walking tracks were provided. Currently, bushwalking and in particular, summiting Mt Kosciuszko is by far the most popular activity, with over 100, 000 people visiting the alpine area each year. As a result there are a range of social issues (crowding, safety, interpretation, visitor expectations and satisfaction) and environmental issues (trampling, littering, introduction of nutrients, weeds and feral animals, changes in hydrology and removal of vegetation by infrastructure) to be managed. Current strategies for the provision of infrastructure and interpretation of this geotourism destination are discussed. We also examine the key challenges for future management of this 'high altitude' destination: dealing with the interactions between climate change and tourism use. This includes potential for further spread of weeds and feral animals, increased risk of bushfires and changes in visitation patterns as snow cover declines and there is increase promotion of summer tourism by resorts.
