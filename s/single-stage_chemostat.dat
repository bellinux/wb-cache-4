40|$|A {{study of}} <b>single-stage</b> <b>chemostat</b> {{cultures}} of Colpoda steinii. Escherichia coli, and glucose is reported here. Two levels of glucose were fed as the limiting nutrient to the chemostat cultures. The cultures were studied at three holding times. Oscillations developed at short holding time and damped oscillations developed a long-residence times that approached steady-state conditions of populations of C. steinii and E. coli and concentrations of glucose. The experimental data are fitted to and compared with Jost's model...|$|E
40|$|In vitro gut models provide several {{advantages}} over {{in vivo models}} {{for the study of}} the human gut microbiota. However, because communities developed in these models are inevitably simplified simulations of the in vivo environment, it is necessary to broadly define the differences between in vitro consortia and the communities from which they are derived. In this study we characterized microbial community development in a twin-vessel <b>single-stage</b> <b>chemostat</b> model of the human distal gut ecosystem using both gel (Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis) and phylogenetic microarray (Human Intestinal Tract Chip) based techniques. Five different sets of twin-vessels were inoculated with feces from three different healthy adult donors and allowed to reach steady state compositions. We found that twin-vessel single-stage chemostats could develop and maintain stable, diverse, and reproducible communities that reach steady state compositions in all five runs by at most 36 days post-inoculation. As noted in other in vitro studies, steady state communities were enriched in Bacteroidetes but not Clostridium cluster XIVa, Bacilli or other Firmicutes relative to the fecal inocula. Communities developed within this model had higher within-run reproducibility than between-run repeatability when using consecutive fecal donations. Both fecal inocula and steady state chemostat communities seeded with feces from different donors had distinct compositions. We conclude that twin-vessel <b>single-stage</b> <b>chemostat</b> models represent a valid simulation of the human distal gut environment and can support complex, representative microbial communities ideal for experimental manipulatio...|$|E
40|$|A {{fermentation}} {{system was}} designed to model the human colonic microflora in vitro. The system provided a framework of mucin beads to encourage the adhesion of bacteria, which was encased within a dialysis membrane. The void between the beads was inoculated with faeces from human donors. Water and metabolites {{were removed from the}} fermentation by osmosis using a solution of polyethylene glycol (PEG). The system was concomitantly inoculated alongside a conventional <b>single-stage</b> <b>chemostat.</b> Three fermentations were carried out using inocula from three healthy human donors. Bacterial populations from the chemostat and biofilm system were enumerated using fluorescence in situ hybridization. The culture fluid was also analysed for its short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) content. A higher cell density was achieved in the biofilm fermentation system (taking into account the contribution made by the bead-associated bacteria) as compared with the chemostat, owing to the removal of water and metabolites. Evaluation of the bacterial populations revealed that the biofilm system was able to support two distinct groups of bacteria: bacteria growing in association with the mucin beads and planktonic bacteria in the culture fluid. Furthermore, distinct differences were observed between populations in the biofilm fermenter system and the chemostat, with the former supporting higher populations of clostridia and Escherichia coli. SCFA levels were lower in the biofilm system than in the chemostat, as in the former they were removed via the osmotic effect of the PEG. These experiments demonstrated the potential usefulness of the biofilm system for investigating the complexity of the human colonic microflora and the contribution made by sessile bacterial populations...|$|E
40|$|Mixed {{intestinal}} bacteria were grown for 336 h in two identical <b>single-stage</b> <b>chemostats</b> at low growth rates in a carbohydrate-limited medium. Complex bacterial populations were maintained and anaerobes always outnumbered aerobes. The predominant organisms {{belonged to the}} genera Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Eubacterium, Propionbacterium, Peptococcus, and Peptostreptococcus. Bacteroides species predominated in both fermentors, particularly B. ovatus and B. thetaiotaomicron. A high degree of reproducibility of bacteriological and fermentation product data was obtained in these experiments. When gut contents were inoculated into a five-stage continuous culture system (retention time of 79 or 38 h) containing soya bran, the medium flow rate had little quantitative effect on the formation of acidic fermentation products; however, more oxidized fermentation acids were produced at the higher retention time. Diverse bacterial populations were maintained in every vessel at each flow rate. Bacteroides fragilis group organisms, especially B. ovatus, were numerically the most important. The viability of bacteria decreased through the system, especially at a retention time of 79 h, when the bacteria were growing under severely nutrient-limited conditions...|$|R
40|$|Pseudomonas oleovorans {{is able to}} grow on linear {{aliphatic}} hydrocarbons of medium chain length as sole energy and carbon source. When nitrogen, sulfur, or magnesium is limiting, P. oleovorans produces an intracellular polyester poly(beta-hydroxyalkanoate) (PHA) from the excess alkanoic acid formed from the alkanes supplied in the medium. To study the effect of growth rate and exposure to bulk amounts of n-octane on the physiology and morphology of P. oleovorans, we have established continuous cultures of this organism in two-liquid phase media containing about 15 % (v/v) n-octane. P. oleovorans was grown in an ammonium-limited <b>single-stage</b> <b>chemostat</b> at growth rates varying from D = 0. 05 to D = 0. 46 h- 1. In contrast to batch cultures of P. oleovorans grown on n-octane, both rapidly and slowly growing cells remained fully viable during the entire continuous culture experiments, which typically lasted 200 - 300 h. The cellular morphology of these cells was studied {{as a function of}} time by freeze-fracture electron microscopy, which provided information on changes in membrane ultrastructure and revealed large and small PHA granules in slowly and rapidly growing cells, respectively. The cell density, cellular protein content, and PHA content were determined as a function of growth rate. The cell density decreased from 2. 25 to 1. 32 mg ml- 1, while the PHA content of the cells decreased from 46. 7 % to 8. 3 % of the total cell dry weight when the dilution rate (= growth rate) increased from 0. 09 to 0. 46 h- 1. The rest biomass concentration, defined as the difference between total biomass and PHA, was almost independent of the cellular growth rate. The cellular protein content relative to the rest biomass increased from 24 % to 46 % when the growth rate increased from 0. 09 to 0. 46 h- 1, indicating that rapidly growing cells contain more protein than slowly growing cells, which correlates well with the qualitative data of the electron micrographs...|$|E
40|$|Growth and {{monoclonal}} antibody production kinetics of the hybridoma cell line NB 1 were studied in batch, chemostat and two-stage chemostat culture. Growth associated production kinetics {{were observed in}} batch culture when glutamine was the first nutrient to be depleted. The growth phase was extended and production increased by supplementing the culture with extra glutamine, essential and non-essential amino acids. Monoclonal antibody was produced by the viable cell population with no evidence for its release from lysing cells. Increasing the concentration of individual amino acids in batch culture appeared to {{have a negative effect}} on cell growth and in some cases a positive effect on antibody production. The effect on production may have been indirect, due to the effect on growth rate. Under conditions of leucine and isoleucine limitation the kinetics of antibody production in batch culture were changed to growth dissociated with the majority of the antibody being produced during the decline phase of the culture. The kinetics of production were therefore dependent on the nutrient limiting growth. In <b>single-stage</b> <b>chemostat</b> culture {{monoclonal antibody}} production was negatively growth rate associated, in contrast to the positively growth associated production generally observed in batch culture. Therefore the feasibility of optimising negatively growth associated antibody production in the second stage of a two-stage chemostat was studied. Steady states in terms of cell concentration, nutrient utilisation and antibody production were observed in both stages of a two-stage chemostat. Monoclonal antibody production in both stages of a two-stage chemostat was negatively growth rate associated. Specific production rate increased with decreasing dilution rate. The specific production rate in the second stage was less than the first stage at an equivalent dilution rate even though the growth rate was less, except at dilution rates below 0. 02 h- 1 when the growth rate in stage two was negative. Feeding the second stage of a two-stage chemostat with amino acids increased the growth rate but decreased the specific production rate. Attempts to decrease the growth rate of a fed second stage by increasing the volume and therefore decreasing the dilution rate relative to the first stage were unsuccessful. Growth rate remained high, however volumetric production was significantly increased. The concentration of an amino acid in the medium appeared to influence its rate of utilisation in batch and chemostat culture. Increasing the concentration of an individual amino acid tended to {{have a negative effect on}} cell growth. Decreasing the concentration of an individual amino acid reduced the extent to which it was utilised. Increasing the concentration of all amino acids increased their rate of utilisation without increasing the cell concentration...|$|E
