The upper respiratory system consists of the nasal cavity, nasopharynx, oropharynx, and trachea. The shape and diameter of these passages determine the volume of air passing through them [6].

40|$|The <b>airway</b> <b>system</b> of {{the lung}} {{from the mouth}} to the {{pulmonary}} membrane is modelled by matching a cylindrical model of a pathway through the respiratory region of the lung onto a one-dimensional trumpet model for the conducting airways. The concentration of O 2 in gas expired from this model <b>airway</b> <b>system</b> is investigated following an inspiration of air at two different flow rates (10 litres/min and 85 litres/min). In each case, expiration occurs at the same constant flow rate as that during the previous inspiration. The inspirations, which are studied in an earlier paper, are each of 2 sec duration and begin at a lung volume of 2300 ml and a lung oxygen tension of 98 mm Hg. The equations are solved numerically and plots of expired O 2 concentration against time and against expired volume are shown. It is found that at 85 litres/min, gas mixing in the lung is complete after about 0. 7 sec of expiration whereas at 10 litres/min, about 2. 6 sec of expiration is required for complete equilibration. It is suggested that the experimental alveolar plateau slope is not in general caused by a slow approach to equilibrium of gas concentrations; except at very low flow rates {{in the early part}} of the concentration/time plateau...|$|R

40|$|Sleep apnea is {{a disease}} {{which has not been}} getting an {{adequate}} amount of attention in the research community for a long time. However, the strain on the cardiovascular system and other serious problems, such as daytime sleepiness and even neurocognitive dysfunction, that it causes may be severe in advanced cases of the illness, as such it can significantly affect the heart especially and lead to cardiac arrest. Thus, it has been receiving a lot of attention recently. Tampere University Hospital has a goal of creating a comprehensive upper airway airflow model for surgery outcome prediction. That requires knowledge of available models and analysis of static magnetic resonance images, among other things. This document deals with these two main issues. This thesis has two major parts, one of them being a literature review of sleep apnea and models used in airflow modelling in the upper airways. Modelling of airflow generally includes acquisition of a static upper <b>airway</b> <b>system</b> model (in the case of upper airway modelling) and then adding a dynamic component to it. The second part of this thesis deals with acquisition of the static model, which involves segmentation of MRI image sets from 3 patients (pre- and post-operative sequences). It also answers the question, whether the effect of orhtognathic surgery on the upper <b>airway</b> <b>system</b> can be seen from volumetric analysis of the segmented images and the segmented images themselves. The main methods of adding a dynamic component to the static model turned out to be computational fluid mechanics and finite element modelling, including their sub-methods, such as direct numerical simulation of large eddy simulation. As with {{the second part of the}} thesis, the volumetric segmentation data is rather inconclusive and should not be related solely for evaluation of the effect of orthognathic surgery on the upper <b>airway</b> <b>system.</b> It can be said, nonetheless, that the volume of the upper airway itself is rather easily obtainable and reliable. The images themselves, however, provide very visual information about that, and shifting of certain muscles and muscle groups and other structures can be seen...|$|R
