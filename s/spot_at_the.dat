Captain America: The First Avenger is the third highest-grossing motion picture set during the World War II era, after Saving Private Ryan and Pearl Harbor.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham was {{promoted}} to acting squadron leader in September 1940, commanding B Flight. Within the month the unit received the heavily armed and powerful Bristol Beaufighter. After the commanding officer, Cunningham was the second man to fly it. The Beaufighter went through a teething stage in relation to its gun sight. The sight projected a ring of light with a <b>spot</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> centre onto a small sheet of glass {{directly in front of}} the pilots head. The spot in the centre provided the aiming point, and the ring, of variable diameter, helped him to judge the rage and amount of deflection needed to attack a target. The light's brilliance was adjustable by rheostat, but the control was ineffective. Rotating it a fraction could produce maximum brilliance or cause the spot to flicker out.|$|E

50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 12 mm {{for males and}} 14.6 mm for females. The forewings are covered with brown black-tipped scales. The costal margin is mottled with black {{and there are two}} black <b>spots</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> base, a diffuse black <b>spot</b> in <b>the</b> middle <b>at</b> one-fourth, an indistinct black streak in the fold and a subtriangular black <b>spot</b> <b>at</b> three-fourths of <b>the</b> costal margin. The apex is uniform brown without black scales, separated by poorly expressed whitish <b>spots</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dorsal and costal margin. The hindwings are light grey. Adults have been recorded on wing in late November.|$|R
5|$|Jillian Terceira was not {{originally}} {{chosen to}} participate on Bermuda's Olympic team, and was passed up for Patrick Nisbett and his horse, Antille 8. This occurred when neither Terceira nor Nisbett qualified for an Olympic <b>spot</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> equestrian finals in Hong Kong, caused {{in part by}} the injury of Terceira's horse, Navantus. Because Bermuda was allowed only one horse rider, the Bermuda Equestrian Federation awarded their one reserved Olympic spot to Nisbett because Terceira's horse had been injured {{during the course of the}} event.|$|E
5|$|This bird is glossy {{black with}} a wide fork to the tail. Adults usually have a small white <b>spot</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> base of the gape. The iris is dark brown (not crimson as in the similar ashy drongo). The sexes cannot be told apart in the field. Juveniles are {{brownish}} and may have some white barring or speckling towards the belly and vent, and can be mistaken for the white-bellied drongo. First-year birds have white tips to the feathers of the belly, while second-years have these white-tipped feathers restricted to the vent.|$|E
5|$|Vesuvius {{was formed}} {{as a result of}} the {{collision}} of two tectonic plates, the African and the Eurasian. The former was subducted beneath the latter, deeper into the earth. As the water-saturated sediments of the oceanic African plate were pushed to hotter depths inside the planet, the water boiled off and caused the melting point of the upper mantle to drop enough to create partial melting of the rocks. Because magma is less dense than the solid rock around it, it was pushed upward. Finding a weak <b>spot</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Earth's surface, it broke through, thus forming the volcano.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 11-14 mm. The forewings are brown with a yellowish border with brown <b>spots</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> veins. The hindwings are brown with a narrow light border.|$|R

5|$|A {{crowd of}} 43,167 people {{was on hand}} to watch the Browns play the Bills, Buffalo's biggest-ever home {{attendance}} figure. Cleveland scored a touchdown {{in each of the}} game's four quarters, winning 28–7. The first score followed several completions by Graham that set up a 12-yard touchdown run by Jones. In the second period, Cleveland tied a professional football record when Graham, pinned at his own one-yard line, threw a screen pass to Speedie. Speedie caught the ball and ran for a 99-yard touchdown, setting an AAFC record and tying the National Football League record for longest completed pass. The Browns scored again in the third quarter on a diving catch by Lavelli, who rolled into the end zone, and in the fourth quarter on a pass to John Yonakor. Buffalo scored its only points in the fourth period when George Ratterman connected with Al Baldwin for the quarterback's 16th touchdown of the season. Graham threw 13 completions for 246 yards as passing accounted for most of the team's 392 yards of total offense. Cleveland's defense was also strong, preventing the Bills from scoring on several drives that ventured deep into Browns territory. The win was the eighth for Cleveland in nine games and preserved its <b>spot</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top of the AAFC standings.|$|E
5|$|Academic Decathlon is {{designed}} to include students from all achievement levels. Teams generally consist of nine members, who are divided into three divisions based on grade point average: Honors (3.75–4.00 GPA), Scholastic (3.00–3.74 GPA), and Varsity (0.00–2.99 GPA). Each team member competes in all ten events against other students {{in his or her}} division, and team scores are calculated using the top two overall individual scores from each team in all three divisions. Gold, silver, and bronze medals are awarded for individual events and for overall scores. To earn a <b>spot</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> national competition in April, teams must advance through local, regional, and state competitions, though some levels of competition may be bypassed for smaller states. Online competitions, separated into small, medium, and large categories, are also offered. USAD has expanded to include an International Academic Decathlon and has created an Academic Pentathlon for middle schools.|$|E
5|$|As Canada's {{starting}} goalkeeper at the 2008 CONCACAF Women's Olympic Qualifying Tournament in April, McLeod recorded three shutouts {{and allowed}} one {{goal in the}} final against the United States. The team's April 9 semi-final win over Mexico was her sixth clean sheet of the season, setting a national team record. She helped Canada set a CONCACAF record with 509 consecutive shutout minutes. Canada's second-place finish at the tournament earned the team a <b>spot</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Following the Olympic Qualifying Tournament, McLeod started in two friendlies in May against the United States and Australia before the Peace Queen Cup in Korea in June. She recorded one shutout during the tournament. After the Peace Queen Cup, McLeod and Canada's women's national team resumed the Vancouver residency program for final preparations for the 2008 Women's Olympic Football Tournament. The residency included three friendlies in July against Brazil, New Zealand, and Singapore; McLeod started in the matches against New Zealand and Singapore and allowed two goals.|$|E
