5|$|Yu's voice acting {{has been}} handled by Daisuke Namikawa in Japanese and Johnny Yong Bosch in English. Bosch felt uneasy about voicing Yu {{due to the}} fact he also voiced another {{character}} from the game, Tohru Adachi. However, when he initially learned that the protagonist would have very few lines, his worry evaporated. It was first planned that Yu's voice actor for the anime would be recast, because he and Adachi would begin to interact several more times. However, in the end Bosch remained as the voice of Yu to avoid disappointing the game players. In order {{to solve the problem of}} having both of his characters <b>sound</b> <b>too</b> similar, he decided to speak in a lower register for Yu.|$|E
5|$|Upon its release, Aphrodite was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reviews from music critics, many of whom complimented it as a return to form for Minogue. However, critics were divided on its production; many felt Price's production helped make the album cohesive, while some felt it made the album <b>sound</b> <b>too</b> similar to Minogue's previous work and lacked innovation. Commercially, Aphrodite was a success. In Minogue's native country Australia, it peaked at number two on the Australian Albums chart, and was later certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association. In the United Kingdom, the album debuted at {{number one on the}} UK Albums chart, a feat accomplished by Minogue's debut studio album Kylie (1988) during the same week 22 years prior. Aphrodite was the fourth studio album by Minogue to peak atop the UK albums chart and made her the first solo artist to have a number one album in four different decades in the region, achieving this in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s. She also became a Guinness World Record-holder for achieving the most consecutive decades with top five albums in the United Kingdom. The British Phonographic Industry certified Aphrodite platinum. The album also achieved strong charting internationally, reaching the top-five in countries like Belgium, France, Greece, Spain and Switzerland. It became Minogue's second highest-charting album in the United States by peaking at number 19 on the Billboard 200 chart.|$|E
25|$|Némirovsky was {{the very}} {{definition}} of a self-hating Jew. Does that <b>sound</b> <b>too</b> strong? Well, here is a Jewish writer who owed her success in France entre deux guerres in no small measure to her ability to pander to the forces of reaction, to the fascist right. Némirovsky's stories of corrupt Jews—some of them even have hooked noses, no less!—appeared in right-wing periodicals and won her the friendship of her editors, many of whom held positions of power in extreme-right political circles. When the racial laws in 1940 and 1941 cut off her ability to publish, she turned to those connections to seek special favors for herself, and {{even went so far as}} to write a personal plea to Marshal Pétain.|$|E

25|$|The game's {{score was}} {{composed}} by Shota Kageyama, Minako Adachi, Hitomi Sato, Junichi Masuda, Go Ichinose, and Morikazu Aoki. This {{was the first}} usage of the Nintendo 3DS's sound capabilities for the Pokémon series, and Masuda expressed delight over improved sound quality and expression. Similar {{to the theme of}} X and Y themselves, the soundtrack of the games were designed to emphasize beauty. Kageyama sought inspiration from the music of France as well; however, he indicated hesitation in making the music <b>sound</b> <b>too</b> French. During an interview with Famitsu magazine, Masuda stated that the Japanese harp was used in place of an accordion in certain situations to avoid giving off excessive French vibes. Additionally, Kageyama cited Masuda himself as inspiration for his work. Although working primarily as the director for X and Y, Masuda composed the games' battle themes. In discussing , Masuda stated he wanted to try a new approach and added techno themes.|$|E
500|$|The March 15, 2004 {{edition of}} the Dear Abby column was pulled, as it had emerged {{that one of the}} letters was a fake. A {{newspaper}} editor noticed that the problem cited in the letter was identical to the plot of [...] "Life on the Fast Lane". Kathie Kerr, a spokeswoman for the Universal Press Syndicate stated that [...] "It did <b>sound</b> <b>too</b> similar not to be a hoax".|$|E
500|$|Nirvana biographer Everett True {{wrote an}} uncharacteristically {{unfavorable}} review in Melody Maker, accusing the single {{of being a}} cash-in on Neverminds success. [...] "Whoop whoop bloody whoop", he wrote, [...] "Forgive me if I don't <b>sound</b> <b>too</b> thrilled. This release is stretching even my credulity beyond repair. Like, milking a still-breathing (sacred) cow, or what? Badly inferior live versions of 'Polly' and 'Sliver' on the flip don't help matters either." [...] In 2011 Rolling Stone magazine ranked the song number 415 on its list of the [...] "500 Greatest Songs of All Time".|$|E
5000|$|Writer Robby Krieger felt [...] "it <b>sounded</b> <b>too</b> commercial", and {{the track}} was left off the album.|$|R

500|$|... "Piggy" [...] uses [...] "nothing {{can stop}} me now", {{a line that}} recurs in [...] "Ruiner" [...] and [...] "Big Man with a Gun". The frantic {{drumming}} on the song's outro is Reznor's only attempt at performing drums on the record, {{and one of the}} few [...] "live" [...] drum performances on the album. He had stated that the recording was from him testing the microphone setup in studio, but he liked the <b>sound</b> <b>too</b> much not to include it. It was released as a promotional single in December 1994 and reached the Top 20 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart.|$|E
500|$|Recorded {{shortly after}} the Beatles' {{break-up}} in 1970, [...] "Wah-Wah" [...] was the first track taped for All Things Must Pass. The recording features a dense production treatment from Phil Spector and backing from a large cast of musicians including Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr, Billy Preston, Bobby Keys and the band Badfinger. On release, Rolling Stone magazine described it as [...] "a grand cacophony of sound in which horns sound like guitars and vice versa". While several reviewers find the heavy production appropriate for the song, Harrison considered the recording overproduced and the <b>sound</b> <b>too</b> cluttered.|$|E
500|$|Marc Okrand, who {{developed}} the Klingon language for the Star Trek films, was hired to devise the Atlantean language for Atlantis: The Lost Empire. Guided by the directors' initial concept {{for it to be}} a [...] "mother-language", Okrand employed an Indo-European word stock with its own grammatical structure. He would change the words if they began to <b>sound</b> <b>too</b> much like an actual, spoken language. John Emerson designed the written component, making hundreds of random sketches of individual letters from among which the directors chose the best to represent the Atlantean alphabet. The written language was boustrophedon: designed to be read left-to-right on the first line, then right-to-left on the second, continuing in a zigzag pattern to simulate the flow of water.|$|E
50|$|The hero's {{name was}} changed from Hank Morgan to Hank Martin, {{possibly}} because the original name <b>sounded</b> <b>too</b> {{similar to that}} of actor Frank Morgan.|$|R

500|$|One of the {{noticeable}} differences from Music Box and Carey's previous albums is its sound. The album {{was described by}} Afanasieff as a softer and more pop-oriented album, [...] "filling the songs with air", and allowing far more space in the overall sound. Another noticeable change is in the album's production. When Mariah Carey was released, critics took notice of its [...] "overly produced" [...] and [...] "studio perfect" [...] quality, where in comparison, Emotions maintains a [...] "raw, live sound." [...] Music Box however, falls in between the two, a decision made by Carey during the album's production. She would layer each track with live backing vocals, so not to <b>sound</b> <b>too</b> overly produced, but still kept the inclusion of musical synthesizers.|$|E
500|$|Bacon and Morgan {{described}} his bassline for the Beatles song [...] "Rain" [...] as [...] "an astonishing piece of playing... {{thinking in terms}} of both rhythm and 'lead bass'... the area of the neck... he correctly perceives will give him clarity for melody without rendering his <b>sound</b> <b>too</b> thin for groove." [...] MacDonald considered the track the Beatles' best B-side, stating that its [...] "clangorously saturated texture resonates around McCartney's [...] ", which MacDonald described as [...] "so inventive that it threatens to overwhelm the track". MacDonald also indicated the influence of Indian classical music in [...] "exotic melismas in the bass part". McCartney identified Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band as containing his strongest and most inventive bass playing, particularly on [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds".|$|E
500|$|Russell {{was driven}} by [...] "a {{neurotic}} need to win", as his Celtic teammate Heinsohn observed. He was so tense before every game that he regularly threw up in the locker rooms; {{early in his career}} it happened so frequently that his fellow Celtics were more worried when it did not happen. Later in Russell's career, Havlicek said of his teammate and coach that he threw up less often than early in his career, only doing so [...] "when it's an important game or an important challenge for him—someone like Chamberlain, or someone coming up that everyone's touting. [...] is a welcome <b>sound,</b> <b>too,</b> because it means he's keyed up for the game, and around the locker room we grin and say, [...] "Man, we're {{going to be all right}} tonight." ...|$|E

500|$|In a 1997 interview, Wright {{explained}} how the episode's dialogue posed {{a challenge in}} {{that not only did}} he have to take great care to adhere to the vernacular of Star Trek and not <b>sound</b> <b>too</b> contemporary or [...] "too 1997", but he had to take several days to accommodate himself to the episode's [...] "treknobabble" [...] with the assistance of Robert Duncan McNeill (Tom Paris). [...] Director Cliff Bole later praised Wright for his ability to improvise, but explained that it was to the actor's detriment as [...] "Star Trek is not an ad-lib format", and he felt Wright assumed he could wing some of it. [...] Mulgrew also bemoaned the technobabble in [...] "Tuvix" [...] when asked by Starlog for her [...] "most memorable line of technobabble"; [...] "When did he cease to be a transporter accident and start to be an individual?" ...|$|E
500|$|Gene Hoglan, later {{known as}} the drummer for bands like Dark Angel and Death, {{provided}} backing vocals on the song [...] "Evil Has No Boundaries". [...] "Back {{at the time it}} was Jeff [...] and Kerry doing the 'Evil!' You know, it didn't <b>sound</b> <b>too</b> heavy and I mentioned to like Tom or Jeff or somebody like, 'You know you guys should consider...maybe consider doing like big gang vocals on that, make it sound evil like demons and stuff,' and they were like 'Good idea.' But how about now, we got about eight dudes sitting around in the studio, and now everybody jumped up and yelled 'EVIL!!!' So I was like 'Cool' because I'm like, 'I wanna sing on this record somehow, that's how I can do it,' totally unplanned you know?! Sure enough they were like, 'Fuck we have the time, let's do it.' So I was like 'Yeah, I got to sing on it!'" [...] On recording the drums, Slagel wanted drummer Dave Lombardo to play without using cymbals due to the amount of noise they made, as he was unsure if he could siphon the noise out, which he eventually did.|$|E
500|$|Arnold {{wanted a}} theme song marrying the [...] "classic Bond sound" [...] with the electronica that would {{influence}} {{most of his}} score. An orchestra would be required as audiences expect traditional elements in a Bond film, and without them The World Is Not Enough {{would be seen as}} a generic action movie. Getting the balance right might be a [...] "poisoned chalice", since the results could <b>sound</b> <b>too</b> much or too little like a Bond theme. Arnold collaborated with lyricist Don Black on the song. Black, with 30 years of experience writing Bond themes, wrote the lyrics to Tom Jones's [...] "Thunderball", Shirley Bassey's [...] "Diamonds Are Forever", Lulu's [...] "The Man with the Golden Gun" [...] and k.d. lang's closing credits theme, [...] "Surrender", from Tomorrow Never Dies. Arnold and Black met several times to discuss lyrics for [...] "The World Is Not Enough", also collaborating by phone, fax and email. According to Arnold, he [...] "strung some la-las together, {{and all of a sudden}} the [...] came to life". By the end of 1998 he and Black finished the music and lyrics, except for the bridge (a contrasting section of about eight bars).|$|E
5000|$|Lead singer Roger Daltrey spoke {{positively}} of the song, saying [...] "I love 'Relay. Pete Townshend, however, {{felt that}} it <b>sounded</b> <b>too</b> similar to the band's other releases. He said of this: ...|$|R
5000|$|Evan Robert Charmatz {{was born}} in 1944 in Bronx, New York. [...] In 1973 he moved to West Palm Beach, Florida, where he {{subsequently}} changed his last name because Charmatz <b>sounded</b> <b>too</b> Jewish.|$|R
5000|$|Phonological assimilation, the {{modification}} of loanwords {{to fit a}} new language's sound structure more effectively. If, however, a loanword <b>sounds</b> <b>too</b> [...] "foreign", inflection or derivation rules {{may not be able}} to transform it.|$|R
500|$|In {{the decade}} after Britten's death, his {{standing}} as a composer in Britain was {{to some extent}} overshadowed by that of the still-living Tippett. The film-maker Tony Palmer [...] thought that Tippett's temporary ascendancy {{might have been a}} question of the two composers' contrasting personalities: Tippett had more warmth and had made fewer enemies. In any event this was a short-lived phenomenon; Tippett adherents such as the composer Robert Saxton soon rediscovered their enthusiasm for Britten, whose audience steadily increased during the final years of the 20th century. Britten has had few imitators; Brett describes him as [...] "inimitable, possessed of... a voice and <b>sound</b> <b>too</b> dangerous to imitate". Nevertheless, after his death Britten was lauded by the younger generation of English composers to whom, in the words of Oliver Knussen, he became [...] "a phenomenal father-figure". Brett believes that he affected every subsequent British composer to some extent: [...] "He is a key figure in the growth of British musical culture {{in the second half of}} the 20th century, and his effect on everything from opera to the revitalization of music education is hard to overestimate." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} reviewers found the album overly long, while others felt Feldmann {{was too much}} of an influence. Mike Damante at the Houston Chronicle said [...] "Feldmann's style is all over the record, as most tracks <b>sound</b> <b>too</b> formulaic, similar and run together. Other tracks are way too commercial, even for a band the size of blink.... California is {{ultimately}} a step back, rather a throwback." [...] David Anthony from The A.V. Club gave the album a C-, commenting, [...] "California is the sound of Blink-182 desperately trying to remain relevant by outsourcing its creativity. [...] is another homogenous addition to Feldmann's growing résumé. But this time he unintentionally removed the soul of pop-punk's clown princes in the process." [...] Nina Corcoran from Consequence of Sound was similarly negative: [...] "When not cranking the compression on the vocals, Feldmann ruins other songs with nonstop gimmicks: the piano interludes, the stiffened handclaps, the sappy title track." [...] Gwilym Mumford of The Guardian, focusing on the album's turbulent history regarding the departure of DeLonge, deemed the album [...] "a tired – and tiring – work." ...|$|E
500|$|The album showcases {{an eclectic}} range of {{sounds from the}} country rock of [...] "Sex, War & Robots", {{featuring}} pedal steel guitar, to the heavy metal and punk of [...] "Out of Control" [...] and the glam rock of first single [...] "Golden Retriever". [...] "Slow Life", a track which singer Gruff Rhys has described as the [...] "most sonically impressive" [...] song on Phantom Power, features techno influences {{and is based on}} a piece of electronic music written by keyboardist Cian Ciaran several years earlier. Ciaran encouraged the band to jam on top of his original track to produce a fusion of techno and guitar-pop. [...] "The Undefeated" [...] is inspired by ska and reggae music, although the group removed a [...] "cheesy white reggae" [...] section from the song because it sounded [...] "fucking horrible" [...] and actively tried not to make it <b>sound</b> <b>too</b> much like a ska or reggae track as they felt they [...] "couldn't pull it off". Many tracks feature close vocal harmonies, with all the band apart from Pryce contributing. These harmonies give the album a California / West Coast of America feel, with comparisons being drawn to the work of The Beach Boys, particularly on the song [...] "Venus and Serena".|$|E
