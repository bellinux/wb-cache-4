40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the problem of modern {{education}} development and criticizes a pragmatic attitude to education. Based on the retrospective historical analysis, the author maintains that educational systems are generally focused on fostering the pragmatic intellect rather than reasoning, which leads to a superficial world perception, and undermines personal analytical potential and capability of <b>strategic</b> problem solving. <b>Concentration</b> on rationality is unlikely to provide {{a way out of the}} world crisis. In the author’s view, education demands both the deep and solid comprehension of existential concepts and the reference to the “absolute spirit” of Confucius, Plato, Kant and Hegel. The research is aimed at justifying the civilizational paradigm of education on the basis of Hegelian fundamental ideas of intellectual perception with the emphasis on reasonability instead of rationality. As the most adequate implementation instrument, the author suggests a game simulating technique that combines the benefits of philosophical, scientific and methodological thinking. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{international}} {{consolidation of}} the container port industry is a relatively recent, yet radical trend in international shipping and logistics. Global strategies of vertical and horizontal integration evolving around port ownership and operations are undertaken {{by a variety of}} market players, both within and outside the international shipping and logistics markets. However, while much of the available literature on the subject has focused on the bases and various motives behind the change, little work has addressed the impacts on channel structure and relationships, including such aspects as control, power and conflict. By channel, we refer to an organised network of institutions that form the combined physical and non-physical path taken by goods and services as they move from original supplier to final consumer. However, {{in the context of this}} paper, the scope of the distribution channel is reduced to active members of the international shipping and logistics industry, that is, shippers, ocean carriers, ports, agents and intermediaries. This paper investigates the extent of channel power, conflict, role, performance and <b>strategic</b> <b>concentration</b> of shipping lines as international container terminal operators. A structural equations model is used to assess the impacts of global factors and consolidation on the container port industry, and test whether the direction of change would result in an increasing or decreasing risk of commoditisation and footloose mobility.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the pattern of}} abnormal returns for merging companies and rivals to determine investor expectations regarding the impact of horizontal mergers challenged by the government. Prior {{studies have indicated that}} the government may have challenged efficiency-enhancing mergers as evidenced by the pattern of abnormal returns to rivals during merger events. This {{study examines}} those patterns using challenged mergers from 1997 to 2007, and it adds to the literature by assessing the effect that R&D intensity and change in HHI have on the returns to rivals and merging firms. The paper finds that the pattern of abnormal returns {{is a result of the}} different effects that antitrust complaints and merger outcomes have on rivals based on R&D intensity and change in industry concentration. This finding suggests that the government may have been properly vigilant in challenging mergers over the past 10 years in basic industries that have high levels of market concentration. However, it also may have allowed collusive mergers to proceed in R and D intensive industries. mergers, Research and Development, <b>Strategic</b> Protection, market <b>concentration,</b> event study...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{importance}} of R&D cooperation {{has been recognized}} {{as a consequence of}} growing complexity, dynamism of the environment, increasing risks and escalating costs of innovation. Collaboration with firms and academic institutions enables organizations to exploit external resources and competencies not available internally and adding additional value to the in-house ideas. Despite the large number of publications related to R&D cooperation, empirical studies on the impact of firm’s strategic partnering on firm performances are rather scarce. Thus, the goal {{of this paper is to}} contribute to the existing literature by discussing the strategic behavior of firms derived from the patent co-ownership network in order to establish a link between the variety of close relationships and the number of sold products. This paper discusses the influence of different strategic directions on firm performance, whereby the impact of uncertainty regarding the future technology development and the market acceptance is specifically high. First, the starting point is the analysis of co-patenting structure in the field automotive industry using patents related to lithium-ion batteries. This study investigates the characteristics of each resulting cluster derived from the collaboration network and then explores the heterogeneities of R&D collaboration strategies differentiating between three types of <b>strategic</b> partnering: doing-it-alone, <b>concentration</b> on single partners and open partnering. Second, analysis is undertaken to establish an empirical linkage between the strategic partnering behavior and the number of sold electric vehicles.

40|$|Professional Doctorate - Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) Abstract: This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} corporate governance on the underpricing of Chinese initial public offers (IPO) for the years 2005 to 2007. Underpricing refers to the situation where the IPO share price jumps substantially higher {{on the first day}} of trading. Previous studies of Chinese IPO underpricing focus on one or two corporate governance mechanisms with a few controlled variables. This {{study examines}} six groups of corporate governance variables: ownership structure, the board, the CEO, the <b>strategic</b> investor, ownership <b>concentration</b> and the underwriter. The relationship between corporate governance variables and IPO underpricing is examined by the winner’s curse theory, the ex-ante uncertainty theory, the signaling theory and the underwriter’s reputation theory which have been developed from the asymmetric information theory. This study contributes to the literature by identifying from the extant literature and investigating the impact of six groups of corporate governance variables on IPO underpricing. By using multivariate regression analysis, this study performs sub-models and full models test under the sub-sample and full sample cases for determining the impact of corporate governance on Chinese IPO underpricing. The performance of proxy variables of the corporate governance variables are compared between sub-models and the full model. Considering the sub-models only, the findings reveal that four corporate governance variables including ownership, board, CEO and ownership concentration show their impacts on Chinese IPO underpricing under full sample and sub-sample cases. Considering the full model only, similar results are obtained. If one considers the sub-models and the full model together, the findings reveal state ownership induces higher IPO underpricing (Signaling hypothesis), board supervision induces lower IPO underpricing (Signaling hypothesis) and CEO-Chairman duality induces lower IPO underpricing (Asymmetric Information and signaling hypothesis) for the research period from 2005 to 2007. The impact of board supervision on Chinese IPO underpricing has been neglected in most previous studies. Nevertheless, the board supervision performed well in hypotheses tests in this study. It follows that the role of board supervision may be considered to be an important corporate governance parameter in any future research of Chinese IPO underpricing...|$|R

Graduellement le contenu des conventions collectives s'est élargi pour comprendre non seulement la plupart des aspects de la vie au travail mais encore ceux de la vie du travailleur hors les cadres de l'entreprise même touchant sa sécurité économique et sociale ainsi que celle de sa famille. Quelle est l'extension de cette sécurité sociale dans les conventions collectives ? Quelles en sont les limitations ? Est-ce que la sécurité sociale organisée par l'État fera disparaître la forme contractuelle ? Voilà quelques-unes des questions auxquelles répond l'auteur. NATURE AND EVOLUTION OF COLLECTIVE BARGAININGThe practice of collective bargaining performed {{on a private}} and contractual basis surely constitutes {{one of the main}} characteristics of our present industrial relations system. This is true both for Canada and the United States according {{to the fact that the}} same «pattern », to a large extent, applies in both countries. This « contractual » or « private » character of our collective bargaining system is not determined solely by the « capitalistic » régime of our economy, nor is it exclusively a consequence of the pragmatic philosophy of our labour movement coupled with the viguor of our private law. Instead, it merely reflects, in our opinion, die traditionnally dynamic nature of the North American economy of which we are part. Our economy can still afford tolerating a certain amount of freedom in private economic decisions and competition on the labour market may take place in a measure sufficient to enable a « private » system of collective bargaining to work successfully. In spite of repeated criticisms, collective bargaining has assumed new dimensions unthought of some thirty years ago; so much so, that we may now pretend without risk of being refuted, that it really constitutes the core of the whole industrial relations system of ours. What originally was a mere compromise concerning a few items of negotiations has now become the device « par excellence » through which the labour force, not only secures the promotion of its economic interests, but also acquires a new and unproved status in our economic society. This new role of collective bargaining has been assumed progressively from the moment when trade-unionism, taking advantage of new texts of law emanating from public authorities short before the last World War, has revised its structural, functionnal and ideological positions. Union demands were no longer limited to wages and conditions of work, but covered a host of subjects heretofore considered as the exclusive prerogatives of management. Accordingly, the scope of collective bargaining was enlarged so as to include most of the workers' work-life phases, including social security in and out of the negotiations unit. In a country where social security systems emanating from the State have taken so long to develop, collective bargaining has assumed a pioneer role that is not going to vanish soon. What trade-unions have gained from governments, in other countries, they have in part secured in North America through collective bargaining. No matter the conception one has of the trade-union movement in our country, the facts clearly establish that it is through collective bargaining that workers have secured enlarged social security benefits. Long term collective agreement were relatively new twenty years ago; they are now a current practice. Attempts to solve problems of employment and income security, retirement, illness and hospitalization were not common fifteen years ago as they are today. We assist presently to a proliferation of formulae aiming at the coverage of such risks through collective bargaining. THE IMPACT OF THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESSConsidering that more than one million and a half workers throughout Canada are covered by collective agreements, it is easy to measure the impact of such a device on the standard of living and on the status of wage earning people among the Canadian population. According to a survey conducted by the Department of Labour of Canada in 1960, over 66 % of the labour force in manufacturing industries were covered by collective agreements. In the mining industry (« metal » section) the proportion attained 82 % and was up to 89 % in the « coal » section of the same industry. In Quebec, more particularly, there are presently over two thousand collective agreements in force covering more than three hundred thousand people. Moreover, owing to the <b>strategic</b> <b>concentration</b> of the trade-union membership in the most vital sectors of the economy; and due to the direct impact of the negotiations in large concerns over satellite firms, collective bargaining derives a much larger influence than official statistics show. COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND SOCIAL SECURITY FOR WORKERSCollective bargaining in itself has already contributed largely to the social and economic security of the wage-earners. Now, through what we call « fringe benefits » collective bargaining reaches the heart of the problem of economic and social security' for union members. Twenty years ago, such benefits were largely ignored by the parties to collective bargaining. Presently, they represent something like about 20 % of the average labour costs in industry. Though the expression « fringe benefits » is very inclusive, there is a distinction to be made between benefits representing a mere addition to the labour income and those aiming above all at securing a better security and an improved welfare for workers and their families, without being too closely related to the remuneration of the work done. The latter are mainly to be considered when reference is made to the potentialities of collective bargaining as regards economic security and social welfare. Negotiated systems of retirement benefits, schemes for group life-insurance, accident and illness insurance, hospitalization benefits, guaranteed annual wage systems, supplementary unemployment benefits and like devices are to be counted in the latter group of benefits. They cover the main sources of insecurity for workers on the economic and familial grounds. In 1956, in Canada, according to a survey of the Department of Labour, a little more than 10 % of the existing labour agreements in the manufacturing industry provided for unemployment supplementary benefits or guaranteed employment to a different extent. For the same year (1956) about half the number of existing collective agreements studied by the survey contained clauses concerning life and accident insurance as well as indemnities for hospitalization, medical and chirurgical cares for workers and their families. Near 25 % of these agreements provided for a pension plan with the contribution, in whole or in part, of the employer. THE LIMITATIONS OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING TOWARD SOCIAL WELFAREIn spite of the fact that collective bargaining has already done much toward the social welfare of those covered by it, and irrespective of its spectacular development in this respect since one decade or two, it is unquestionably true that, by its very nature and due to the limited degree of its future expansion, such a device presents built-in limitations that one never must lose sight of. Structural and technical difficulties impose certain limits to the development of collectively bargained social security programs through «private» collective agreements. There must be, for the non-unionized labour force, and to a lesser degree, even for those covered by collective agreements, a specific and decisive intervention of the State in social welfare matters. So long as our industrial relations system remains what it is presently; so long as more than half the labour force stays outside the scope of our «private» collective bargaining institutions; so long as the means of cooperation between organized workers and managements are not improved and enlarged in some institutionalized fashion, it would be pure fancy to pretend that collective bargaining could be the global solution to welfare problems. Larger and more inclusive schemes of a private or public nature have to be deviced, toward which collective bargaining should normally assume a subsidiary function...|$|E
