The compounds 3-octanone, 1-octen-3-ol, and (Z)-3-octen-1-ol are the predominant {{components of the}} volatile chemicals that give the puffball its odor and flavor. Extracts of the puffball contain relatively high levels of antimicrobial activity against the human pathogenic bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with an efficiency {{comparable to that of}} the antibiotic ampicillin. These results corroborate an earlier study that additionally reported antibacterial activity against Salmonella enterica <b>serovar</b> Typhimurium, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Mycobacterium smegmatis. Extracts of the puffball have also been reported to have antifungal activity against Candida albicans, C.tropicalis, Aspergillus fumigatus, Alternaria solani, Botrytis cinerea, and Verticillium dahliae. A 2009 study found L.perlatum puffballs to contain the phenolic compound cinnamic acid at a concentration of about 14milligrams per kilogram of mushroom.

Since the 2004 Dutch outbreak many additional {{cases have been}} reported, leading to greater surveillance. Soon after the initial Dutch report, national and international health authorities launched warning initiatives and multiple LGV cases were identified in several more European countries (Belgium, France, the UK, Germany, Sweden, Italy and Switzerland) and the US and Canada. All cases reported in Amsterdam and France and a considerable percentage of LGV infections in the UK and Germany were caused by a newly discovered Chlamydia variant, L2b, a.k.a. the Amsterdam variant. The L2b variant could be traced back and was isolated from anal swabs of {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM) who visited the STI city clinic of San Francisco in 1981.

2500|$|The genome of {{pathogenic}} Leptospira {{consists of}} two chromosomes. [...] The size of the genomes of L. interrogans serovars Copenhageni and Lai is approximately 4.6 Mb.

40|$|Knowledge of {{circulating}} Chlamydia trachomatis <b>serovars</b> can {{be beneficial}} for sexual network surveillance, monitoring treatment success, and associating specific clinical manifestations. Typically, C. trachomatis <b>serovars</b> are predicted by nucleotide sequencing of four variable domains within the ompA gene. However, sequencing procedures can be labor-intensive, are not readily available, and can lack the capacity to identify multiple <b>serovars.</b> This study describes the development and evaluation of a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) test algorithm for the rapid prediction of C. trachomatis <b>serovars,</b> including ocular (A to C) and anogenital (D to L 3) strains. This test comprises a primary qPCR to confirm C. trachomatis positivity and the phylogenetic group(s) present and a secondary set of qPCRs to determine specific <b>serovars.</b> Cell culture isolates from 15 prototypic C. trachomatis <b>serovars</b> were correctly identified using this assay, with no cross-reactivity observed among <b>serovars</b> or with other common pathogenic microorganisms. Five hundred clinical specimens (previously diagnosed as being C. trachomatis positive) were evaluated by qPCR, with their results compared to results obtained by conventional sequencing. The qPCR identified 88. 9 % (423 / 476) complete matches (95 % confidence interval [CI], 86 to 92 %) of <b>serovars</b> compared to the results obtained using the sequence-based approach. Among the anogenital specimens, 2. 4 % (12 / 494) (95 % CI, 1. 3 to 4. 2 %) contained multiple <b>serovars,</b> categorized as single-serovar infections by conventional sequencing.

2500|$|The outer {{membrane}} of Leptospira, {{like those}} of most other Gram-negative bacteria, contains lipopolysaccharide (LPS). [...] Differences in the highly immunogenic LPS structure account for the numerous serovars of Leptospira. [...] Consequently, immunity is <b>serovar</b> specific; current leptospiral vaccines, which consist of one or several serovars of Leptospira endemic in the population to be immunized, protect only against the serovars contained in the vaccine preparation. [...] Leptospiral LPS has low endotoxin activity. [...] An unusual feature of leptospiral LPS is that it activates host cells via TLR2 rather than TLR4. [...] The unique structure of the lipid A portion of the LPS molecule may account for this observation. [...] Finally, the LPS O antigen content of L. interrogans differs in an acutely infected versus a chronically infected animal. [...] The role of O antigen changes in the establishment or maintenance of acute or chronic infection, if any, is unknown.|$|E

METHODS: In 1986 - 88 the C trachomatis isolates from 159 heterosexual men and 116 women attending a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic were collected and typed accordingly. A medical history was recorded, a physical examination took place and samples were taken for laboratory diagnostics. RESULTS: <b>Serovars</b> E, F and D were the most common for both men (75 %) and women (67 %). Men infected with <b>serovars</b> of the C-complex had more often a history of STD (p = 0. 06).

40|$|Most Salmonella <b>serovars</b> are general {{pathogens}} that infect {{a variety}} of hosts. These "generalist" <b>serovars</b> cause disease in many animals from reptiles to mammals. In contrast, a few <b>serovars</b> cause disease only in a specific host. Host-specific <b>serovars</b> can cause a systemic, often fatal disease in one species yet remain avirulent in other species. Host-specific Salmonella frequently have large genomic rearrangements due to recombination at the ribosomal RNA (rrn) operons while the generalists consistently have a conserved chromosomal arrangement. To determine whether {{this is the result}} of an intrinsic difference in recombination frequency or a consequence of lifestyle difference between generalist and host-specific Salmonella, we determined the frequency of rearrangements in vitro. Using lacZ genes as portable regions of homology for inversion analysis, we found that both generalist and host-specific <b>serovars</b> of Salmonella have similar tolerances to chromosomal rearrangements in vitro. Using PCR and genetic selection, we found that generalist and host-specific <b>serovars</b> also undergo rearrangements at rrn operons at similar frequencies in vitro.
