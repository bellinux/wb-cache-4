5|$|During the 2015 season, Fishlock scored {{her first}} {{goal of the}} season during the team's home-opener against Western New York Flash. Her goal in the 25th minute {{was the first of}} the match and assist to Megan Rapinoe in the 86th minute contributed to a 5–1 win for the Reign. During a match against the Washington Spirit on 2 May, Fishlock scored a goal in the 75th minute off an assist from Kim Little {{resulting}} in a 3–1 win over the Spirit. During a match against <b>Sky</b> <b>Blue</b> FC in New Jersey, Fishlock received a controversial red card in the 90th minute that required her to sit out the team's next match against league-leading Chicago Red Stars. The controversy stemmed from a scrum in the box after a <b>Sky</b> <b>Blue</b> corner kick and Fishlock's last-minute save on the goal line. Fishlock stated the ball bounced off her head, but <b>Sky</b> <b>Blue</b> forward Nadia Nadim said she blocked it with her hand and the ref awarded <b>Sky</b> <b>Blue</b> the penalty kick. Both matches resulted in 1–1 draws. During the team's second match against <b>Sky</b> <b>Blue</b> FC in Seattle on 6 June, Fishlock scored a goal and an assist earning Player of the Match after leading Seattle to a 3–0 win.

Seattle was ultimately defeated 1–0 by FC Kansas City during the championship final in Portland.

During their first season in the League, Hull wore black and amber striped shirts and black shorts, which they continued to wear until the Second World War {{with the exception of}} the 1935–36 season, in which they wore <b>sky</b> <b>blue</b> shirts. Following the end of the Second World War, Hull spent another season wearing <b>sky</b> <b>blue,</b> but changed to plain amber shirts, which they wore until the early 1960s, when they swapped back to stripes.|$|E

5|$|Manchester City's home colours are <b>sky</b> <b>blue</b> and white. Traditional away kit colours {{have been}} either maroon or (from the 1960s) red and black; however, {{in recent years}} several {{different}} colours have been used. The origins of the club's home colours are unclear, but {{there is evidence that}} the club has worn blue since 1892 or earlier. A booklet entitled Famous Football Clubs – Manchester City published in the 1940s indicates that West Gorton (St. Marks) originally played in scarlet and black, and reports dating from 1884 describe the team wearing black jerseys bearing a white cross, showing the club's origins as a church side. The red and black away colours used infrequently yet recurrently come from former assistant manager Malcolm Allison, who believed that adopting the colours of A.C. Milan would inspire City to glory. Allison's theory worked, with City winning the 1969 FA Cup Final, 1970 League Cup Final and the 1970 European Cup Winners' Cup Final in red and black stripes as opposed to the club's home kit of <b>sky</b> <b>blue.</b>|$|E

5|$|Solid xenon {{changes from}} face-centered cubic (fcc) to {{hexagonal}} close packed (hcp) crystal phase under pressure and begins to turn metallic at about 140GPa, with no noticeable volume change in the hcp phase. It is completely metallic at 155GPa. When metallized, xenon appears <b>sky</b> <b>blue</b> because it absorbs red light and transmits other visible frequencies. Such behavior is unusual for a metal and is explained by the relatively small width of the electron bands in that state.|$|E
