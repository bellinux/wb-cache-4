Looking for Lucas, sweet, trusting Lena meets shy, mild-mannered Byron Bunch, who falls in love with Lena but feels honor-bound to help her find Joe Brown.

Then {{it goes back to}} 'Holiday' which is an old dance number. It keeps you steppin'. Madonna sings everything live. She's been that way from the beginning of her career, even with all the athletic dancing. She's a hard worker and <b>she</b> <b>expects</b> everybody else to work as hard or harder.

500|$|Although Caged Bird was {{refreshing}} in its honesty, something {{its readers}} and reviewers value, Angelou's honesty in Gather Together had become, as reviewer John McWhorter perceives it, [...] "more and more formulaic". McWhorter {{asserts that the}} events that Angelou describes in Gather Together and in her subsequent autobiographies require more explanation, which she does not provide, although <b>she</b> <b>expects</b> her readers to accept them on face value. In Gather Together, for example, Angelou insists {{that she is not}} religious, but she refuses welfare, and even though she was afraid of becoming a lesbian in Caged Bird and presents herself as shy, awkward, and bookish, she pimps for a lesbian couple and becomes a prostitute herself. McWhorter criticizes Angelou for her decisions in Gather Together, and for not explaining them fully, and states, [...] "The people in these flamboyant tales—the narrator included—have a pulp-novel incoherence".|$|E

Simpson's voice in the song spans from the note of G3 to the high note of D5. Following the same beat-oriented pattern as [...] "Irresistible", [...] "A Little Bit" [...] features piano instrumentation. Simpson sings the lyrics as rapid-fire verses and with start-and-stop hooks. Simpson adopts breathy vocals for the song, and the lyrics talk about what <b>she</b> <b>expects</b> from her partner: [...] "A little more time, a little less wait / A little more heart, a little less break". She also demands healthy changes in the relationship.|$|E

500|$|Chotiner {{had worked}} on Warren's 1942 campaign, but had parted ways from him, and the popular {{governor}} {{did not want to}} be connected to the Nixon campaign. Nonetheless, Chotiner sought to maneuver him into an endorsement. Chotiner instructed Young Republicans head and future congressman Joseph F. Holt to follow Douglas from appearance to appearance and demand to know who she was supporting for governor, as other Young Republicans handed out copies of the Pink Sheet. Douglas repeatedly avoided the question, but with four days to go before the election and the Democratic candidate near exhaustion from the bitter campaign, she responded that she hoped and prayed that Roosevelt would be elected. Holt contacted a delighted Chotiner, who had a reporter ask Warren about Douglas's comments, and the governor responded, [...] "In view of her statement, I might ask her how <b>she</b> <b>expects</b> I will vote when I mark my ballot for United States senator on Tuesday." [...] Chotiner publicized this response as an endorsement of Nixon, and the campaign assured voters that Nixon would be voting for Warren as well.|$|E
500|$|Previous {{same-sex}} storylines in {{the show}} had led to criticism from conservative groups.

Australian LGBT website SameSame said the story had attracted attention from some media commentators, who called it [...] "an obvious ratings grab and an attempt to out-gay rival soap, Home and Away". However, script producer, Emma Steele defended the storyline and said {{that it is not a}} [...] "ploy to grab ratings". Steele said that she is [...] "particularly proud" [...] of the way Chris's storyline had been handled and she added [...] "It was something we wanted to do for a while because it's a story that affects so many people and in so many different ways. It wasn't just Chris's story. I think it's interesting to see how [...] affected his friends and his relationships with them too".|$|E
500|$|Chotiner had parted {{ways with}} Governor Warren, {{and the popular}} governor, who was running for a third term, [...] "wanted no part" [...] of the Nixon campaign. Nonetheless, Chotiner sought to {{maneuver}} the future chief justice into an endorsement of Representative Nixon. Chotiner instructed Young Republicans head and future congressman Joseph F. Holt to follow Douglas from appearance to appearance and demand to {{know who she was}} supporting for governor. Douglas repeatedly avoided the question, but with four days to go before the election and the Democratic candidate [...] "close to collapse" [...] from the bitter campaign, she responded to the latest Holt needle with her [...] "hope and pray" [...] that Democratic gubernatorial candidate James Roosevelt would be elected. A delighted Chotiner had a reporter ask Warren about Douglas's reply, and the governor commented, [...] "In view of her statement, I might ask her how <b>she</b> <b>expects</b> I will vote when I mark my ballot for United States senator on Tuesday." [...] Chotiner publicized this response as an endorsement of Nixon, which Warren did not deny. Both Warren and Nixon won overwhelming victories on Election Day.|$|E

500|$|Tenar {{begins to}} {{question}} her beliefs {{when she hears}} Kossil defying the Nameless Ones, and sees {{that they do not}} punish her. She has a conversation with Penthe, her only friend, who expresses an [...] "unfaith" [...] in the divinity of the God-king. Though Tenar reacts to this with shock, the incident opens a new perspective to her. In her own thoughts, [...] "she felt as if she had looked up and suddenly seen a whole new planet hanging huge and populous right outside the window, an entirely strange world, one in which the gods did not matter." [...] Ged acts as a catalyst for this stream of thought, because he is completely alien to her; he is male, brown-skinned, and has a picture of the world is so different from Tenar's own. After speaking to him, she begins to wonder whether the Nameless Ones, despite their power, deserve her worship, and begins to lose faith in them and in all the things she has been taught. <b>She</b> <b>expects</b> to find only evil in Ged, according to what she has been taught; but instead she finds light and love, further challenging her belief.|$|E
500|$|Possessing a {{very strong}} will, the {{character}} tends to exhibit outstanding perseverance {{when it comes to}} what <b>she</b> <b>expects</b> out of her relationships, jobs, and life in general, oftentimes refusing to settle for anything less than what satisfies her. Early in the series, Monica develops a reputation for experiencing bad luck and encountering rather unfortunate circumstances when it comes to dating, romantic relationships, and her love life. Nick at Nite joked that the character [...] "likes to keep things tidy in her home and love life, although the latter is a bit more difficult." [...] This motif is frequently explored as a source of comic relief; the character's friends would often [...] "pick apart" [...] her new dates and boyfriends. In his review of the series, David Hiltbrand of People referred to the character as [...] "an unlucky-in-love codependent," [...] while the Chicago Tribunes Ken Parish Perkins observed that Monica [...] "often misfires when shooting for Mr. Right." [...] According to Mike D'Avria of Splitsider, Monica [...] "never shied away from jumping into the sac with both random guys and people she worked with" [...] – among them a high school senior, an old high school crush, and an alcoholic – prior to dating Chandler, and of the show's six main characters maintains the highest total of serious relationships. Cox described Monica as goofy, angry, and sarcastic, while referring to her as the show's most sexually active character despite her [...] "goody two shoes" [...] image.|$|E

[...] On a trek back to the beach in the morning, Kate encounters Daniel and Charlotte and is knocked unconscious by the latter. Jack and Juliet come across Kate and they split up: Juliet continues for the Tempest alone, as Jack minds Kate. Inside the station, Juliet finds Daniel in a hazmat suit at a computer. [...] After a standoff, Daniel and Charlotte convince Juliet {{that they are not}} going to kill anyone; they are neutralizing the gas in case Ben decides to use it again, as he had twelve years earlier in an Others-led purge of Dharma.
