25|$|England set {{themselves}} up well against Australia, {{but failed to}} hit out in the last over thanks to some accurate and fierce bowling from Cathryn Fitzpatrick, who had earlier hit 38 not out with the bat to lift Australia to 222 for 7 after three for 39 from Clare Connor. Arran Brindle continued on her magnificent form from the first Test, when she made a fifty and a hundred, and in partnerships with Jenny Gunn and Claire Taylor <b>she</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>the</b> English to 198 for 4 with her score of 81. With only 25 runs left to hit {{for the last six}} wickets, it was there for the taking. But Fitzpatrick returned, having taken the wicket of Laura Newton earlier on, and she took three more wickets as the English lower order were strangled - and collapsed to 210 all out with five balls remaining in the innings. Fitzpatrick ended with figures of four for 19 from 10 overs, and Emma Liddell also took three for 29.|$|E

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>the</b> wool veil tied {{round her}} face, and looked all astonishment. Gabriel and his cold-hearted darling, Bathsheba Everdene, were face to face.|$|E

6000|$|... "If you tumble down again, I'll shake you," [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>lifting</b> <b>the</b> {{poor little}} man up very kindly as she spoke, for Nan's bark was {{much worse than}} her bite.|$|R
60|$|PHOEBE. A misunderstanding; just a mistake. (<b>She</b> shudders, <b>lifts</b> <b>the</b> wedding-gown {{and puts}} {{it back in the}} ottoman. MISS SUSAN sinks sobbing into a chair.) Don't, dear, don't--we can live it down.|$|R

60|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>lifted</b> up <b>the</b> ivory harp {{with the}} strings of gold and swept her fingers over it, trying its notes and {{adjusting}} them with the agate screws, looking at Amathel all the while with a challenge in her lovely eyes.|$|R
