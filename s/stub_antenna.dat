50|$|In 1998, the Nokia 8810 was {{considered}} a luxury phone. This {{was due to the}} sleek new design the 8810 presented. It was the first cell phone without an external whip or <b>stub</b> <b>antenna.</b> Instead, it featured an internal antenna, which allowed the phone to be stored in a pocket upside down. Nokia invested hundreds of man hours into research on how people hold their phones for calls; this allowed them to place the antenna accordingly. The 8810 is tapered and weighted to encourage users to hold it below the antenna, minimizing interference. However, this also led to a poorer signal reception compared to an external antenna, which meant battery life was reduced. It was encased entirely in metal apart from part of the back that was plastic to allow the signal to pass through; this case would slide down to reveal the keypad. This new appearance, in particular the lack of an external antenna, meant the 8810 had a desirable advantage over its competitors and enjoyed moderate success. The choice to make the antenna internal had a negative effect on battery life, but Nokia felt this was an acceptable tradeoff for getting rid of the external antenna. The design of the phone also made it particularly popular following its release. Unlike most other phones in the market at the time, the Nokia 8810 featured a chrome metal finish as well as a pull down metal slide which covered the keypad and kept it clean. Nokia claimed to prioritize antenna performance over physical design if they were ever in conflict.|$|E

In order to design the junction region between the parallel plate waveguide and the linear array of rectangular waveguides, waveguide sizes have to be chosen so that the input match is adequate for the range of scan angles for both polarizations. Electromagnetic wave scattered by the junction of a parallel plate waveguide by an array of rectangular waveguides is analyzed by formulating coupled integral equations for the aperture electric field at the junction. The integral equations are solved by the method of moments. In {{order to make the}} computational process efficient and accurate, the method of weighted averaging was used to evaluate rapidly oscillating integrals encountered in the moment matrix. In addition, the real axis spectral integral is evaluated in a deformed contour for speed and accuracy. The MoM results for a large finite array have been validated by comparing its reflection coefficients with corresponding results for an infinite array generated by the commercial finite element code, HFSS. Once the aperture electric field is determined by MoM, the input reflection coefficients at each waveguide port, and coupling for each polarization over the range of useful scan angles, are easily obtained. Results for the input impedance and coupling characteristics for both the vertical and horizontal polarizations are presented over a range of scan angles.

Three different metamaterial-inspired engineering approaches are introduced to achieve enhanced antenna designs. First,the transmission-line (TL) type of MTM is used to modify the dispersion characteristics of a log-periodic dipole array (LPDA) antenna. When LPDA antennas are used for wideband pulse applications, they suffer from severe frequency dispersionbecause the phase center location of each element is frequency dependent. By incorporating MTM-based phase shifters, the LPDA frequency dispersion properties are improved significantly. Both eight and ten element MTM-modified LPDA antennasare designed to enhance the fidelity of the resulting output pulses. Second, epsilon-negative unit cells are used to design several types of electrically small, resonant parasitic elements which, when placed in the very near field of a driven element, leadto nearly complete matching (i. e., reactance and resistance) of the resulting electrically small antenna system to the source and to an enhanced radiation efficiency. However, despite these MTM-inspired electrically small antennas being very efficient radiators, their bandwidth remains very narrow, being constrained by physicallimitations. Third, we introduce an active parasitic element to enhance the band-width performance of the MTM-inspired antennas. The required active parasitic element is derived and an implementation methodology is developed. Electricallysmall active Z, <b>stub,</b> and canopy <b>antennas</b> are designed. It is demonstrated that an electrically small antenna with ka around 0. 046 and over a 10 % bandwidth can be realized, in principle...|$|R
