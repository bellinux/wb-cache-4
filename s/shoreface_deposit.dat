40|$|The Otjosondu {{manganese}} {{mining area}} {{is located at}} the eastern exposed extent of the inland branch of the late Proterozoic Damara orogen. In spite of intense deformation and a high-grade metamorphic overprint, the sedimentological interpretation of the manganese-rich rocks and their associated lithologies has led to a palcoenvironmental model which gives insight into ore genesis. At least two manganese silicate ore horizons (manganese formations) are associated with banded iron-formations. This sequence is sandwiched between superma-ture metaquartzarenites interpreted as a <b>shoreface</b> <b>deposit</b> derived from a cratonic basement and deposited under high-energy conditions. Manganese ore varieties and their country rocks have been classified using their texture, mineralogy, and geochemistry and have thus been interpreted in sedimentological nd facies terms. The evaluation of the vertical facies sequences, their lateral distribution and their contact relationships renders a spatial reconstruction of the environmental setting for the manganese ores possible.

40|$|The 200 – 300 m thick, volcano-sedimentary {{sequence}} at Kangerluluk {{is part of}} the psammite zone, one of {{four major}} zones, which constitute the 1. 8 Ga Ketilidian orogen in south Greenland. Three lithofacies are emphasized in the study: (1) the conglomerate-sandstone; (2) the volcanic; and (3) the pyroclastic lithofacies. The 2 – 40 m thick conglomerate-sandstone lithofacies represents a subaerial to subaqueous fan-delta deposit. Matrix- and clast-sup-ported conglomerates are interpreted as debris flow and longitudinal gravel bar deposits. Erosive-based conglomerate channel fills attest to stream incision. Trough crossbedded sandstone, interpreted as lunate megaripples, planar-bed-ded sandstone indicative of upper flow regime bar-top sands, and small-scale trough crossbeds reflecting ripples follow up-section, form collectively with the conglomerate, 0. 40 – 2. 50 m thick fining-upward sequences. The sandstone-dom-inated unit, up-section from the conglomerates and composed of planar and low-angle crossbeds, minor ripples and graded beds as well as mudstone is indicative of a lower <b>shoreface</b> <b>deposit</b> below normal wave base. The clastic sedimentary rocks are suggestive of a fan-delta setting. The 100 – 200 m thick volcanic lithofacies, composed of pillowed and pillow brecciated lava flows, is consistent with shallow-water deposition. Interstratification of lava flows with both conglomerate-sandstone and pyroclastic lithofacies, intrusion of dykes into volcaniclastic rocks, and peperite formation accentuate contemporaneity between volcanism and sedimentation and is a common feature o...|$|E
40|$|Lower Jurassic Cook Formation is an {{important}} hydrocarbon reservoir in northern North Sea due to its anomalously high porosity at depths around 3000 meters. This study presents information about the depositional environment, petrographic and petrophysical properties, and reservoir quality of Cook Formation in Oseberg and Veslefrikk area. Reservoirs of Brent and Dunlin groups have been studied by examination of cores from three wells. Reservoir intervals are studied by electrical logs, sedimentological core description, quantitative bulk and clay XRD analysis, optical point counting and SEM analysis. The main goal has been to study the relation between depositional environment, diagenesis, quartz cementation and formation of chlorite precursor. The Cook Formation consists of several depositional settings because of its extensive lateral distribution. In Veslefrikk area it has been interpreted as prograding delta deposit, while in Oseberg are, it is observed as upper <b>shoreface</b> <b>deposit.</b> Sandstones in Cook Formation have overall quartz dominant mineralogy with some carbonate cemented intervals. Kaolinite, chlorite and illite are major clay minerals found. Well developed and extensive chlorite grain coats were observed in Veslefrikk area causing quartz inhibition and porosity preservation. Reservoir quality of Cook Formation is moderate to good in Veslefrikk area. In Oseberg area, sandstones are observed to be more porous and cleaner indicating good reservoir quality. The formation of iron-rich clay precursor in Veslefrikk area has been suggested mainly by mechanical infiltration of clay suspensions and by minor possible contribution from bioturbation. Chlorite coating or precursor was not observed in Oseberg area, possibly due to the erosion during reworking. Prediction of chlorite coating in deeply buried reservoirs is difficult. If the relation between depositional environment and formation of chlorite precursor is understood, then prediction and mapping of chlorite coatings in intermediate to deeply buried reservoirs can become possible...|$|E

40|$|Within the Middle Triassic Doig Formation of Western Canada {{there are}} thick {{sandstone}} bodies encased in muddier sedi-ment — “anomalously thick sandstone bodies ” (ATSBs). Interpretations vary from incised valleys, deltaic, barrier islands, turbidites in slope slumps, to shallow-water gravity-flow beds overlain by <b>shoreface</b> <b>deposits</b> {{in a slump}} or growth fault. Several authors have interpreted the uppermost beds in the sandstone bodies as <b>shoreface</b> <b>deposits.</b> The thick sandstone bodies were deposited {{during a period of}} regression and transgression but authors disagree {{as to whether or not}} the ATSBs and enclosing strata were deposited contemporaneously. Abrupt basal contacts, apparently abrupt lateral contacts, and stratigraphic relationships favour the sandstone bodies to be post-mudstone, formed during late regression. The most probable explanation for the origin of ATSBs is that during late regression, structural depressions formed on a muddy, pre-existing shelf and were filled by sandy sediment. Initial deposits in the thicker sandstone bodies commonly are debris-flow and/or slump deposits that filled in the deeper parts of the depression. As the depression filled, sediment entered wave- and current-influenced water depths and more typical <b>shoreface</b> <b>deposits</b> began to form. As regression proceeded some sandstone bodies were truncated by a regressive surface of marine erosion. Finally, all ATSBs and adjacent sediment were capped by a thin veneer of transgressive sediment. RÉSUM...|$|R
40|$|The Milk River and Eagle {{formations}} {{in southern}} Alberta and north-central Montana form {{the core of}} the first Upper Cretaceous clastic wedge {{in this part of the}} Western Interior Foreland Basin. The wedge is a host for shallow biogenic gas in both Canada and the USA. Facies analysis in outcrop and cores shows two overall marine progradational successions with markedly differing depositional environments. The lower, Virgelle succession, is dominated by swaley and hummocky cross-stratification and represents a storm-dominated <b>shoreface</b> <b>deposit.</b> The upper, Upper Eagle succession, is dominated by a high mudstone content and has tidal indicators. Importantly, no abundant swaley or hummocky cross-stratifications can be found within the Upper Eagle succession, indicating deposition under dominantly fair-weather conditions in a restricted, probably deltaic environment. Down-dip correlation with 2760 wireline logs reveals that each succession consists of a series of three progradational allomembers separated by minor transgressions. The three Virgelle allomembers step consecutively farther basinward and were terminated by a regional transgression. The three Upper Eagle allomembers also step seaward in a shingled manner and were partly drowned before being terminated by the regional Pakowki/Claggett transgression. Production data indicates that only the Upper Eagle A, B and, when present, C allomembers are productive in the Bearpaw Mountains area. All Virgelle allomembers commonly test wet, probably due to a large amount of inter-connectivity among the coastal sandstones of the allomembers, which enabled the migration of hydrocarbons up structural dip. Unconventional reservoirs such as the Alderson Member of the southern Alberta Milk River Gas Pool are time equivalent to the Upper Eagle allomembers. Because deltaic sedimentation with little or no storm activity prevailed during Upper Eagle time, the Alderson fine-grained rocks could be the result of a plume of sediment of deltaic origin (pro-delta) being deposited on the shelf during prevailing fair-weather conditions.

40|$|An {{integrated}} {{investigation of}} the sedimentological, ichnological and syn-sedimentary tectonic aspect of the late Emsian to early Eifelian Lynton Formation (Lynton Beds of previous studies) has revealed a varied mudstone-dominated shallow marine succession which accumulated in a rapidly subsiding rifted basin. The 'Exmoor Basin' developed {{in response to a}} Devonian phase of transtension associated with dextral shear along a fundamental east-west lineament to the north (the Bristol Channel Fault Zone). The Lynmouth - East Lyn Fault (a splay off the BCFZ?) was active throughout the deposition of the Lynton Formation and strongly influenced the depositional styles developed along its length. A re-evaluation of the p/subsidence curve for the 'Exmoor Basin' using the latest biostratigraphic and lithological thickness data indicates a pattern consistent with a strike-slip basin; Carboniferous thermal phase p/subsidence values suggest only 10 % crustal thinning compared to values c. 50 % claimed be previous authors (Dewey 1982, Sanderson 1984). The base of the exposed Lynton Formation is characterised by extensive intraformational slide deposits and the presence of phosphatic material which represents a highstand deposit that correlates with the eustatic transgressive T-R event Ic of Johnson et al. (1985). Following a period of gradual reduction in accomodation space the sequence was punctuated by a massive influx of sand and granule grade material deposited {{at the base of the}} Lynmouth - East Lyn Fault scarp. This material was swept together into a series of offshore sand ridges and a <b>shoreface</b> <b>deposit</b> adjacent to the fault scarp. A new process-response model has been developed to describe the offshore sand ridges that were moulded by a combination of semi-permanent trade wind induced geostrophic flow, oscillatory currents and (possibly) weak tides. The central part of the Lynton Formation records a gradual upwards increase in relative accomodation space and decrease in the influence of semi-permanent currents; dysaerobic substrates became widespread and a localised anoxic mud developed offshore. The transition into the overlying Hangman Sandstone Group was marked by the southward progradation of a sandy shoreline in the face of a period of world-wide eustatic sea-level rise. The older, more northerly shoreline was dominated by longshore currents whilst the younger shoreline preserved a mixed (lower energy) storm- and wave-dominated sequence. The rate of shoreline progradation was relatively slow and the Lynton Formation - Hangman Sandstone Group boundary is markedly diachronous; the thickness of the exposed Lynton Formation varies from 200 m adjacent to the Lynmouth - East Lyn Fault, where previously unrecognised outliers of the Hangman Sandstone Group occur, to 250 m some 5 km down-palaeoslope. Although the ichnofauna was locally diverse, with 27 distinct ichnotaxa recognised within the Lynton Formation, the succession was dominated by a gradation between straight Palaeophycus tubulraris burrows and branching Chondrites systems reflecting the response of an organism tolerant to dysaerobic conditions. The study demonstrates the value of integrating sedimentological, ichnological and structural techniques when studying Devonian marine shelf successions which accumulated m a tectonically unstable setting...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{integration}} of high-resolution (25 cm vertical spacing) and continuous quantitative data on grain size, carbonate content, porosity, density, and P-wave velocity from outcrop, borehole, and core (over 1000 samples) {{and a real}} seismic section allows a calibration of seismic sequence stratigraphic principles. This approach has been tested in the Boulonnais, along the English Channel coast in northern France on a succession of Upper Jurassic sharp-based <b>shoreface</b> <b>deposits</b> embedded in offshore marine shales. Statistical analyses of grain-size distributions allow a characterization of hydrodynamic conditions and depositional processes affecting low-inclination shelf margins and create a framework for identifying locations of preferential and enhanced carbonate cementation, which exerts primary control on reservoir and acoustic properties. Stratigraphic surfaces and systems tracts are quantified for physical properties and results in a quantitative mechanical sequence stratigraphic model. The combination of this model with seismic wavelets and a contrast between this synthetic and a real seismic section shows that key bounding sequence stratigraphic surfaces are in fact discontinuous reflectors. Because stratal relationships of sharp-based <b>shoreface</b> <b>deposits</b> are subtle, physical contrasts are generally stratabound, and the deposits are typically not very thick, the geological recordings of sea-level falls and potential reservoirs are easily overlooked or go unseen in seismic sequence stratigraphic analyses. By defining key diagnostic seismic criteria for sharp-based <b>shoreface</b> <b>deposits,</b> this study contributes {{to the understanding of}} processes controlling sedimentary fills of epicontinental basins...|$|R

40|$|Carbonate aeolian {{deposits}} {{are common}} along arid to semiarid, wind-exposed, present-day coastlines bordered by productive carbonate ramps. Lithified carbonate dunes (aeolianites) {{have been described}} {{around the world in}} marine terraces of Quaternary age, but these deposits have seldom been identified in the Pre-Quaternary record. Several authors have suggested that this scarcity reflects that these deposits form and are preserved only during icehouse periods characterized by high-amplitude sea-level changes. Others [e. g. McKee and Ward Carbonate Depositional Environments (1983), AAPG Memoirs, Vol. 33, pp. 131 – 170] suggest that the scarcity of aeolianites in the Pre-Quaternary record could reflect the ‘great difficulty in recognising wind blown carbonate deposits and in differentiating between them [aeolianites] and other carbonate sands of nearshore environments'. It has been considered that carbonate shoreface/foreshore deposits are very difficult to discriminate petrographically from backshore deposits. This petrographic study of recent sediments from the shoreface to backshore along the northern coast of Chrissi Island, Crete, confirms that carbonate aeolian sands can be very easily misinterpreted as <b>shoreface</b> <b>deposits.</b> Textural examination of thin sections by image analysis techniques indicates, however, that grain orientation patterns differ between facies. <b>Shoreface</b> <b>deposits</b> exhibit a unimodal distribution of grain orientation (flat rose diagram), whereas backshore deposits show a tendency towards a bimodal distribution with a significant proportion of vertical grains. This observation has been confirmed in Pleistocene aeolianites from Tunisia and Western Australia. Grain verticality thus seems to be a reliable criterion for discriminating wind-lain carbonate bodies from <b>shoreface</b> <b>deposits.</b> Vertical grains in aeolian carbonate deposits could reflect gravity effects (e. g. reorientation of grains because of meteoric water percolation and air pull-up). Laboratory experiments conducted on carbonate sands under the action of percolating waters confirm this hypothesis. This reorganization process is preferentially developed in recently deposited and loosely packed sands resulting from grainfall and/or grainflow. In addition, this suggests that the presence of vertical grain orientation might be an indicator of the frequency and intensity of rainfalls during deposition...|$|R

40|$|The Late Cretaceous Aren Fm exposed {{north of}} Bastus in the Tremp Basin (south-central Pyrenees) {{preserves}} an excellent record of dinosaur eggs laid in a marine littoral setting. Different from other cases reported in literature, at the Bastus site the preferential nesting ground was original beach sand. The coastal deposits of Aren Fm can be grouped into four facies assemblages, representing respectively shoreface, beachface, beach ridge plain and backbarrier lagoon environments. <b>Shoreface</b> <b>deposits</b> include fine- to coarsegrained hybrid arenites and subordinate quartz-dominated conglomerates with ripple structures of wave and wave-current origin. Beachface deposits are mainly storm beach conglomerates, but parallel-laminated foreshore arenites locally occur. Backbarrier lagoon deposits comprise of washover sandy conglomerates that grade laterally into sandy lime mudstones, biomicrites and marls. Beach ridge sediment, wherein {{the bulk of}} dinosaur eggs and eggshell debris occurs, predominantly is a reddish hybrid arenite that has undergone a complex early diagenetic evolution, including marine and meteoric cementation followed by soil development. The reddish arenites overlie wave-dominated <b>shoreface</b> <b>deposits</b> and in places pass laterally into lagoonal deposits. They originally formed shore ridges, that became stabilized during progradational episodes by pedogenesis (beach ridge, sensu[Otvos, E. G., 2000. Beach ridges—definitions and significance.

The eggshell-bearing beach ridge arenites are typically preserved {{at the top of}} parasequences forming the systems tracts of a third-order sequence. Thick packages of this facies resulted from aggradation of barrier/beach ridge deposits, whose preservation below surfaces of transgressive erosion was favoured by incipient lithification. ...|$|R

40|$|The late Quaternary {{evolution}} of the Sele River coastal plain (Salerno Gulf, southern Italy) was investigated through integrated stratigraphical, chronological and palaeoecological analyses. The main environmental changes were ascribed to glacio-eustatic variations leading to rapid ingressions alternating with coastal progradations. The marked marine ingression of MIS 5. 5 is testified by palaeoridges now cropping out 4 km inland at 11 / 13 m a. s. l. (Gromola palaeoridge). The eustatic minimum of MIS 2 is testified by lower <b>shoreface</b> <b>deposits</b> in the offshore core record and in the seismic profiles at 120 / 130 m below sea level. This prolonged sea-level fall was interrupted by at least three rapid sea-level rises, probably related to MIS 5. 3, 5. 1 and 3. The evidence {{of the first two}} sea level rises are represented by <b>shoreface</b> <b>deposits</b> in the inland S 1 core (30 m thick, 3 m a. s. l., 1. 5 km inland). The highstand of MIS 3 was identified by seismic profiles as onlapping marine deposits. The shore deposits at 100 m b. s. l were tentatively attributed to the lowstand of MIS 4. After the lowstand of MIS 2, the Sele Plain was newly flooded due to the rapid Post Glacial sea-level rise. This ingression caused the inland migration of a barrier-lagoon system and stopped at approximately 5. 5 ky BP. From that moment the shoreline started prograding up to the present position probably due to the decrease in the sea-level rise rates and to the volcaniclastic supplies from the Neapolitan volcanoes, especially from the AD 79 Vesuvius eruption, also recorded in the subbottom chirp profiles...|$|R

40|$|A {{dissertation}} {{submitted to}} the Faculty of Science, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in fulfilment of requirements for the degree of Master of Science. Johannesburg, 2014. The Karasburg Basin is situated in southern Namibia and preserves a heterogeneous succession of Karoo Supergroup strata up to 1000 m thick. The uppermost preserved succession in this basin is the Amibberg Formation which is 250 m thick and consists of intervals of sandstone, siltstone and mudstone. This study uses facies analysis, sequence stratigraphy and petrography to determine the palaeogeography and provenance for the Amibberg Formation. This is then used to establish environmental variability across the Karasburg – Aranos – Main Karoo basins and to define an equivalent of the Amibberg Formation in the Main Karoo Basin. Detailed stratigraphic logging of five outcrop localities {{has led to the}} identification of seven distinct lithofacies and two dominant ichnofacies (Cruziana and Skolithos). These lithofacies include: 1) Massive, laminated and bioturbated mudstones interpreted as offshore deposits (OS); 2) Bioturbated siltstones and sandstones which are representative of offshore-transitional environments (OST); 3) Interbedded sandstones and siltstones also interpreted as offshore-transitional deposits (OST) and generated by river-fed hyperpycnal plumes; 4) Sharp based, massive sandstones interpreted as being deposited on the distal lower shoreface (dLSF); 5) Non-amalgamated hummocky cross-stratified (HCS) and wave rippled sandstones interpreted as distal lower <b>shoreface</b> <b>deposits</b> (dLSF); 6) Amalgamated HCS and wave rippled sandstones interpreted as proximal lower <b>shoreface</b> <b>deposits</b> (pLSF); and 7) Soft-sediment deformed (SSD) sandstones and siltstones occurring in close juxtaposition with dLSF and pLSF deposits. The vertical arrangement of these lithofacies shows a general coarsening and shallowing upward trend. Overall the rocks of the Amibberg Formation consist of wave-dominated <b>shoreface</b> <b>deposits</b> with significant influence by tidal processes. Petrographically, the sandstone samples fall into the class of quartz and feldspathic wackes and are sourced from craton interior provenances. Geochemical analysis of mudstones and nodules indicate high levels of microbial activity under predominantly oxic conditions during the deposition of the Amibberg Formation. Five poorly defined 4 th order T-R cycles are observable within the strata of the Amibberg Formation. Large regressive intervals are capped by thin transgressive tracts and these cycles are interpreted to have formed due to eustatic processes. Overall, the Amibberg Formation represents a regressive shoreline. iii Based on the mean palaeocurrent vectors a NNE-SSW palaeoshoreline orientation is deduced and the shoreface must have occupied a palaeohigh on the northern side of the western Cargonian Highlands. This emergent highland acted as an extensive headland and assisted in the connectivity of the Karasburg and Aranos basins, with partial connectivity with the Main Karoo Basin during the Early Permian. Based on this study, the Amibberg Formation is considered an equivalent of the Waterford Formation in the Main Karoo Basin based on similar: stratigraphic position; thickness; sedimentary structures; trace fossil assemblages and stacking patterns...|$|R

Each sandstone shows an internal stacking of forced regressive shoreface units separated by thin muddy offshore facies. This tacked pattern records low-amplitude but widespread changes in relative sea-level during the overall progradation due to low depositional gradients. Laterally, the stacked forced regressive <b>shoreface</b> <b>deposits</b> show a seaward-dipping, shingled geometry indicating seaward displacement of the shore-line through stepwise, forced regressions during overall fourth-order relative sea-level fall.

40|$|The Allen Formation {{records the}} first Ingression Atlantic to the Neuquén Basin during the Late Cretaceous. The {{definition}} of lithofacies and facies associations interpretation for stratigraphic sections in Paso Córdoba and Salitral Moreno area, Río Negro, Argentina allowed {{to establish the}} depositional system that characterized this transgression in the northeastern edge of the Basin. In this paper we present sedimentological analysis of conglomeratic, sandstone, heterolithic and pelitic facies, which allowed the interpretation of tidal channels (TC), intertidal flats (ITF), storms-influenced tidal flat (SITF), subtidal flat (STF) and <b>shoreface</b> <b>deposits</b> (SF) parts of the depositional environment. These deposits represent a sedimentary records preserved example of hybrid systems, in which, {{the base of the}} sequence has greater tidal influence, while the upper portion is dominated by wave action.

40|$|The Todalen and Endalen members (Firkanten Formation, Paleocene) {{comprise}} the earliest clastic sedimentary fill of the Central Basin on Spitsbergen, Svalbard. These two members represent delta plain- and delta front deposits respectively. Coal seams are {{abundant in the}} Todalen Member, and these are being mined on Svalbard today. The {{aim of this study}} was to carry out a sedimentological and petrographical investigation of the Todalen Member and the boundary beds of Endalen Member to interpret the deltaic environment in which they were deposited. Furthermore, it was also a goal to establish a provenance area for the sandstones and to point out the prevalent diagenetic processes taking place during the subsequent burial. Sedimentological logs and samples were obtained from two cores and two outcrops on the northeaster flank of the Central Basin during two field periods. Seven facies associations have been interpreted from the logged cores and outcrops. Facies association 1 - 6 are interpreted to represent a delta plain environment due to the presence of coal seams (mire deposits), tidal indicators, conglomerates and in-situ rootlets. Facies association 7 is interpreted to represent delta front (<b>shoreface)</b> <b>deposits</b> due alternating beds of Ophiomorpha burrowed- and hummocky cross-stratified sandstones. It is found that the delta plain deposits of the Todalen Member were under significant tidal influence, and becoming more distal towards the west. The upper half of the Todalen Member is found to have been under a larger fluvial influence than the lower half. The delta front (<b>shoreface)</b> <b>deposits</b> in the lower part of the Endalen Member also display more distal facies towards the west. Modal analysis was performed on the sampled sandstones, and the results from this revealed that all of the Todalen and Endalen member sandstones are similar in composition, typically constituted by subarkoses and quartz arenites, and sourced from areas north and northeast of the Central Basin. Only a small change in the detrital grain fraction is detected across the boundary to the Endalen Member. This is seen as an absence of spicular chert grains which represents a source rock fingerprint of the Tempelfjorden Group. This finding may indicate a small alteration of the source rock assembly across the Todalen - Endalen member boundary. Ferroan dolomite/ ankerite cement, as well as calcite cement, post-dated the quartz cement formation. The volume of carbonate cement is seen to decrease upwards in Todalen Member, which supports the interpretation of the upper half of the Todalen Member being more fluvial, as carbonate cement is a more common feature in sandstones deposited in an environment under marine influence. </p...|$|R
40|$|The Palaeogene Grumantbyen Formation {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{understood}} formations in the geology of Svalbard. The objective of this thesis was to get {{a better understanding of the}} sedimentological development and depositional environment of the formation through detailed ichnological, lithological and petrographical studies. Finally, a detailed description of the reservoir quality of the formation will be presented. The Grumantbyen Formation is highly bioturbated throughout the whole succession with only few signs of physical sedimentary structures. The ichnological study has led to an interpretation of seven different ichnofabrics occurring in the formation. There is a gradual transition between these ichnofabrics, and they are implying a change from a distal to a more proximal environment from the bottom to the top of the succession. 5 different lithofacies have been interpreted, and they show that the succession is gradually coarsening and shallowing upward from an offshore deposited sandy siltstone towards an upper <b>shoreface</b> <b>deposited</b> light silty sandstone. A gravel layer appearing erosional on top of the upper <b>shoreface</b> <b>deposited</b> lithofacies has been interpreted to represent a transgressive lag associated with the major flooding of the Grumantbyen Formation, and deposition of the superimposed Frysjaodden Formation. The petrographical study shows a gradual increase in grain-size, better sorting, roundness, shape of the grains and decrease in matrix from the most distal towards the most proximal-lithofacies. This suggests that the energy conditions are getting stronger as a result of a gradual shallowing upward trend in the succession. The formation's appearance of glauconite in combination with high bioturbation intensity, lack of physical sedimentary structures and sandy input, has in this study been interpreted to represent a system with very little sediment input. A possible low, but continuous sediment input, which was greater than the available accommodation space is suggested, in order to have suitable conditions for glauconization and intense bioturbation. The buildup and progradation of the Grumantbyen Formation is therefore suggested to have been a slow process. A suggested shoreline-attached shallow-marine depositional environment is proposed. Possibly being a slightly prograding shoreface succession, that was provided with sediments from a source in the north-eastern parts of the system and prograded in a south- western direction. The amount of matrix, cement and degree of compaction is suggested to have been the most important factors having a negative impact on the reservoir quality, leading to substantial loss of pore-space, due to significant burial. The reservoir quality of the Grumantbyen Formation was potentially good before significant burial, due to the grain-sorting behavior of organisms bioturbating the substrate, leading to well communication in the pore-network...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} a detailed facies analysis and paleodepth reconstruction of a coral-rich mixed siliciclastic-carbonate system Burdigalian in age, outcropping {{in the northern}} sector of Sardinia (Capo Testa). Excellent exposures of continuous sea-cliff outcrops around the southwestern and northeastern area of Capo Testa promontory allowed us to: (1) trace stratigraphic surfaces; (2) document stratal geometries; (3) discern details of the lithofacies and, (4) reconstruct the paleodepths of the different depositional environments. A total of seven sedimentary facies has been recognized and interpreted: siliciclastic conglomerate and coarse bioclastic sandstone (F 1), fine- to medium-grained hybrid sandstone (F 2, scleractinian coral domestone (F 3), bioclastic packstone to floatstone with platy Porites (F 4), red algae floatstone to rudstone (F 5), larger benthic foraminifers (LBF) bioclastic rudstone floatstone in a packstone matrix (F 6), molluscan floatstone in a bioclastic packstone matrix (F 7). The investigated system is characterized by nearshore to <b>shoreface</b> <b>deposits</b> with a conspicuous terrigenous content that grades seaward into deeper zones where coral patch-reefs developed in association with adjacent areas colonized by seagrass meadows. The more distal facies are constituted by scattered encrusting tabular colonies of Porites in growth position occurring in a deeper and lower-energy environment. The paleodepth interval that is observed in the Capo Testa outcrop ranges from 0 to 50 m...|$|R
40|$|Two outcrop {{sections}} of the Lower Triassic (Griesbachian = Early Induan) Toad Formation in southeastern Yukon (La Biche River map area; NTS 95 C) contain well-preserved trace fossils. Strata consist of interbedded shale, siltstone, and sandstone in varying proportions and are interpreted to record deposition on a wave-dominated shelf. Trace-fossil diversity and abundance are low in facies interpreted to be of distal-shelf origin but are moderate to high in offshore-transition and lower-shoreface strata. Sandstone packages interpreted as <b>shoreface</b> <b>deposits</b> are effectively barren. The most common ichnofossils are dwelling networks (Spongeliomorpha), infaunal feeding traces (most commonly Planolites), and arthropod-produced furrowing traces (Cruziana). Ichnotaxonomic diversity of the Toad Formation is high relative to many well-documented Griesbachian successions. This supports suggestions that infauna recovered more rapidly in high-paleolatitude regions than in low-paleolatitude regions following the end-Permian extinction. The studied strata are an outcrop analogue for correlative, gas-producing strata (Montney Formation) in the Ring/Border Field of north-eastern British Columbia and the Pedigree Field of northwestern Alberta. Similarities in sedimentology and ichnology between the two successions suggest that prospective reservoir strata may be present regionally in the Lower Triassic.

40|$|Recent {{excavations}} at {{the ancient}} city of Magdala located {{on the west side}} of the Kinneret lake (Israel) have unearthed a harbor structure with four mooring stones at an altitude of 208. 32 m bsl, suggestive of a higher lake-level in respect to the previous hypothesis. Furthermore the geometrical relationships between the anthropogenic structures and sedimentary deposits suggest several lake- level fluctations up to some meters during the last 2 ky. On the basis of a multidisciplinary approach, involving sedimentological, geophysical, micropalaeontological (benthic meiofauna and pollen) and geochemical analyses three small sedimentary sequences have been identified. These sequences, few decimeter thick, reflect palaeoenvironmental changing in the harbor area and consist in a: 1) a pre–harbor foundation sequence, 2) a sin-harbor activity sequence, and 3) an harbor- abandonment sequence. Above the natural sandy <b>shoreface</b> <b>deposits</b> the abrupt transition to clayey silt dark deposits reveals an anthropogenic sedimentary control related to the activity of the harbor. The following depositional sequence records the siltation of the harbor and its abandonment. Sands sharply overlaid by a foreshore to backshore conglomeratic unit constitute these deposits. Another conglomeratic unit outcrops upward in the stratigraphic sequence. The sudden appearance of conglomerates litofacies at two different stratigraphic levels are possibly correlated to climatic changes from a rainy to an arid phase and/or to tectonic events such as the destructive earthquakes occurred in the 349 AD and in 749 AD...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{benefits}} of seismic attribute classification in subsurface {{studies have been}} published widely. The approach is usually the same and, in most cases, driven by a two-step procedure – an unsupervised classification and a supervised scheme where training is used to redefine classes based on well-log data flagging a specific fluid or lithology. In parallel to the multi-attribute analysis, interpreters have also benefited from recent advances in computing power, enabling the generation of multi-trace or texture attributes. In these two workflows, the focus is either on the seismic texture facies for seismic stratigraphic purposes, or on the reservoir facies for fluid and lithology mapping. This paper presents {{a case study in}} which both texture facies and fluid prediction are linked by performing a hierarchical classification scheme whereby a multi-attribute-based volume, which captures seismic texture information, is combined with amplitude versus offset (AVO) attributes to map fluid response into a single, coherent reservoir facies volume. This methodology is then applied for exploration data screening in offshore Borneo in the Greater Samarang sub-block (East Baram Delta, offshore Sabah, Malaysia). In this case study, the geological analysis, seismic geomorphology, seismic stratigraphy and combined fluid response from AVO attributes facilitate the development of new play concepts in the highstand system tracts and in the morphology generated by incised valleys in <b>shoreface</b> <b>deposits...</b>|$|R

In the Ferrier area, the Cardium Formation is composed by a NE prograding clastic sequence made up of offshore to <b>shoreface</b> <b>deposits</b> sealed by marine shales. The main reservoir is composed by sandstones and conglomerates interpreted to have <b>deposited</b> in a <b>shoreface</b> depositional environment. Lithofacies and net reservoir thickness mapping led to more detailed understanding of the 3 D reservoir architecture, and cross-sections {{shed light on the}} Cardium depositional architecture and post-deposition sediment erosion in the Ferrier area. Detailed core logging, thin section, SEM and CL analyses were used to study the mineralogy, texture and pore characterization of the Cardium reservoir, and three main compartments have been identified based on production data and reservoir characteristics. Finally, two situations showing odd production behaviour of the Cardium were resolved. This shed light on the effect of structural features and reservoir quality and thickness over hydrocarbon migration pathways. The Ferrier example offers a unique case of fluid discrimination in clastic reservoirs due both to depositional and post-depositional factors, and could be used as analogue for similar situations in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. ...|$|R
40|$|Scythian {{sedimentary}} rocks exposed at Strmica and Plavno near Knin represent storm-generated deposits in inner (Lower Scythian) and outer (Upper Scythian) shelf settings. The Lower Scythian {{is represented by}} Siliciclastic facies which consists of two subfacies components - thin-bedded shale-siltstone-sandstone alternations attached to the distal part of the inner shelf, and a thick-bedded sandstone-oolite subfacies attached either to the proximal part of the inner shelf or to the shoreface. Repetitive alternation of these two subfacies which form the Siliciclastic facies is interpreted as high frequency sedimentary cycles possibly related to high-frequency sea-level changes which in turn induced wave-base oscillations. This is observed as a rapid introduction of high energy proximal inner shelf or <b>shoreface</b> <b>deposits</b> into a muddy, distal part of the inner shelf environment. Upper Scythian {{sedimentary rocks}} are lime mudstones with marls in the Mud facies, and with marls and calcarenaceous siltstones in the Siltstone-mudstone facies. No obvious cyclic periodicity was observed within these two facies except the random occurence of punctuated storm layers with basal skeletal lag (Mud facies) and silty material input in normally mud dominated outer shelf sedimentary rocks (Siltstone - mudstone facies).

40|$|Depositional and diagenetic {{heterogeneities}} {{control reservoir}} quality and performance {{and a better}} understanding of their distribution and impacts on fluid flow will improve reservoir development planning and maximize hydrocarbon recovery. <b>Shoreface</b> <b>deposits</b> within the Ben Nevis Formation at the Hebron Asset consist of alternating beds of facies with contrasting reservoir quality that are diagenetically overprinted with the precipitation of calcite cement. Lower quality fairweather facies are interbedded with higher quality sandstone beds that record periodic pulses of sediment into a quiescent shoreface environment by storm activity. The heterolithic nature of the reservoir and diagenetic alterations caused by calcite cement have implications on reservoir continuity and the spatial distribution of reservoir properties that control fluid behaviour. It is difficult to understand and quantify this distribution from subsurface data alone, and outcrop analogue studies aid in reservoir characterization and modelling by revealing information at the interwell-scale about facies architecture, continuity and distribution. An outcrop study of cemented shoreface parasequences in the Book Cliffs, Utah quantified the dimensions and distributions of calcite concretions and calculated variograms with a horizontal:vertical anisotropy ratio of 5 : 1. This ratio was used in the stochastic population of facies in the Hebron reservoir model to calculate horizontal variograms from vertical variograms that are well-defined from well log data. Streamline simulation demonstrates the importance that a geologically-realistic representation of cementation has on reservoir performance. Streamlines indicate that concretions act as baffles, making flow paths more tortuous and causing earlier breakthrough...|$|R
