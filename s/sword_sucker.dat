40|$|The {{susceptibility}} {{and sensitivity}} to Radopholus similis and Helicotylenchus multicinctus of 2 -month-old plants derived from sword suckers (early screening) and of sword suckers of established 18 -month-old mats belonging to 12 Musa genotypes was investigated and compared. Differences in nematode population densities and root damage (number of functional roots, percentage of dead roots and necrosis) were observed between the two evaluation trials which suggests a different host plant response to nematode attack of young root systems compared to older root systems. Therefore, for early screening, it is proposed that <b>sword</b> <b>sucker</b> derived plants be grown in nematode-free soil for at least 8 - 10 weeks to enable the plants to develop mature root systems, {{comparable to those of}} sword suckers from established mars. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an improved technique for mass propagation of banana planting material. The technique called corm nursery technique (Corm-Tech). Corm-Tech {{is divided into}} 2 parts, the pre-nursery stage and the polybag-nursery stage. Corm-Tech utilizes slices of mother corm obtained after harvest and corm from sword and water sucker. At the pre-nursery stage, the sliced corms were {{laid out on the}} bed of cocopeat, after that, the exposed surface was covered with Polyethylene Tarp (PE) to induce shoot and root growth. From the results, Corm-Tech produced significantly more seedlings than conventional nursery practice with respective seedling number of 116 and 42. Corm-Tech also produces higher quality banana planting material compared to the conventional method in terms of growth and development, which was significantly different at 0. 05 significance level with the girth size of 7. 22 cm and height of 29. 36 cm. It was also found that <b>sword</b> <b>sucker</b> produced superior seedlings for both Corm-Tech and conventional method. For the different slices of mother corm, upper slices produced more seedlings compared to lower slices and whole corm with respective seedling number of 52, 23 and 35. Moreover, upper slices produced seedling with better quality with the girth size of 7. 75 cm and height of 33. 00 cm. The seedling growth and development were further improved through enhancement treatment. The seedlings physical criterion (parameters) was improved and the nursery period was shortened through enhancement treatment. There were two treatments were used which are shading and foliar fertilizer treatments. Under shading treatment, there were two level of treatments which were shaded (50. 000 lx) and unshaded (100. 000 lx). The enhancement study of shading treatment found that, seedlings under shade were taller than under direct sunlight with respective seedling height of 23. 2 cm and 17. 8 cm. Under foliar fertilizer treatment, the seedlings were treated with 5 different concentrations of foliar fertilizer which were Control (without fertilizer), 0. 625 g/l, 1. 25 g/l, 2. 5 g/l and 5 g/l. At concentrations of 2. 5 g/l, it significantly improved the seedling growth with girth size of 8. 13 cm and height of 34. 38 cm. Overall, mass propagation of quality banana seedling was achieved by using this technique. This technique is a low-cost technology where the growers can establish the nursery in their own farm where it leads to the advantages of easy accessibility, affordability and readily available of planting materials to small scale growers to manage their farm. Apart from this, it can be modified to use for tissue culture plantlet nursery establishment {{in order to reduce the}} nursery propagation period from 3 months to 1 month. By doing so, mass propagation of banana seedling through tissue culture technique (during the nursery stage) can be produced within a shorter period and this will reduce cost of tissue culture seedlings for the growers...|$|E
40|$|Banana (Musa spp.) {{breeding}} {{has been}} a slow developing process, due {{to the absence of}} seeds and low propagation rates. Selection of valuable cultivars and micro-propagation are promising techniques to accelerate the cultivation process. Therefore, callus culture was carried out, aiming the establishment of plant regeneration protocol that might be used in banana breeding programs. <b>Sword</b> <b>suckers</b> were used as explants, whereas vigorously grown apical shoots obtained from initial in vitro germinated seedlings were sub-cultured in six different MS media at pH 5. 8, supplemented with MS Minerals + MS Vitamins + 36. 7 *FeNaEDTA + 3 % sucrose + 0. 65 % agar (+) different hormonal conditions.  Among the different concentrations tested within the experiment, MS Media (MS Minerals + MS Vitamins + 36. 7 *FeNaEDTA + 3 % sucrose + 0. 65 % agar) with hormones 1 TDZ + 10 IBA showed the highest shoot proliferation and a high rate of multiplication.

40|$|Bananas (Musa sp.) {{have played}} an {{important}} role in human civilization as it is the world's fourth most important food crop after rice, wheat and maize in gross value of production today. The main aim of this study was to identify the multiplication of shoots derived from two different explants, <b>sword</b> <b>suckers</b> and growing buds. Multiple shoots were produced by both explants in this study. Average, there are 2. 57 shoots/sucker and 2. 5 shoots/growing buds. However, growing bud has a higher contamination rate compare to sucker. Due to this reason, the sterilization method was modified in order to reduce the contamination rate of growing buds. Double sterilization with sodium hypochlorite seems effective as the contamination rate has been reduced. When double sterilization was discovered, the time was insufficient for the growing buds to produce shoots due to time constraint. Further study on in vitro multiplication of banana shoots derived from growing bud should be carried out to identify the capability of growing buds to be used in tissue culture in the future...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{covering}} post-harvest banana stumps with soil on banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) oviposition levels was investigated at three locations, Sendusu, Kawanda Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) and Ntungamo district of southwestern Uganda. In the first experiment oviposition levels were assessed in a banana system comprising growing plants and residues. Oviposition increased on <b>sword</b> <b>suckers,</b> reaching a peak 1 ¿ 7 days after harvest and decreased thereafter. In the second experiment conducted on farmers' fields, corms received 70 % {{of the eggs}} and pseudostems 30 %. The area 5 ¿ 10 cm below the collar received 27 % of the eggs, the area 0 ¿ 5 cm above the collar 30 % and the area 5 ¿ 10 cm above the collar 0. 3 %. The remaining eggs (43 %) were laid 0 ¿ 5 cm below the collar. The effect of stump height and covering the stumps was evaluated in both the wet and the dry seasons at Kawanda and Ntungamo.

40|$|Declines in banana (Musa spp.) {{productivity}} in western Kenya since 2006 have been exacerbated by Xanthomonas wilt, caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum. This study provided insight of household dynamics influencing efforts {{to eradicate the}} disease from Ugunja, Lunjre, Sidindi and Sigomere. Surveyed households (N = 120) were purposively selected from villages with and without banana-based farmer field schools (FFS). Results showed limited banana experience, noted by the irregularities in timing and frequency of essential agronomic practices. In addition, a rampant tendency to replant <b>sword</b> <b>suckers</b> obtained from own production or farmer-to-farmer exchange. Even though farmers were sensitized on correct diagnosis and control measures, significant disparities between awareness and actual application of control options seem to prevail over the impact of recent massive eradication campaigns. Selective deployment of elements of Avoid introduction, Break-off male bud, Cut infected plants and Clean cutting tools (ABCC) intervention strategy was evident. Dismantling the ABCC package interferes with complementarities embedded within, which ultimately leads to disease upsurge or resurgence. Repeated exposure and demonstrable efficacy of the practices to halt disease spread may have profound bearing on farmer adoption of Xanthomonas wilt control measures. Therefore, the ABCC package should be validated and fine-tuned within the local context of smallholdersPeer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This {{project was}} {{conceived}} {{in response to}} the rapid decline in banana (Musa) production experienced in Kenya over the last two decades. The decline was brought about by: infestation with Panama disease or Fusarium wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. Cubense (FOC); Black and Yellow sigatoka leaf spot caused by Mycosphaerella fijiensis (Morelet) and Mycosphaerella musicola (Leach) respectively; weevils (Cosmopolites sordidus) / nematode (Radopholus similis) complexes; and, environmental degradation. The common farmer practice of using untreated <b>sword</b> <b>suckers</b> aggravated the problem further. The situation threatened food security, employment and income in banana producing areas. Thus the broad goal of the project was to make available to small-scale resource-poor farmers clean and improved banana seedlings to alleviate the increasing poverty and hunger in Kenya. These farmers make up to nearly 80 % of the Kenyan population and their agricultural production, which is mainly subsistence, contributes over 90 % of food production in the country. The application of tissue culture (TC) technology to address these constraints, was therefore an appropriate option to ensure availability of clean planting material. The specific objectives of the project were to build and upgrade banana TC capacity in Kenya by (i) systematically introducing the technology to farmers and supporting them with the necessary extension, (ii) establishing public/private sector links to ensure timely availability of the TC materials, (iii) carrying out...|$|R
40|$|One major {{constraint}} to plantain {{production has}} been inadequate healthy planting materials {{at the time}} of planting. Several technologies for multiplying healthy planting materials exist but could not meet farmers’ demand. A study was conducted to assess the performance of various landraces plantain to plants issus de bourgeons secondaires (PIBS) technique. Five cultivars of Musa sapientum (Apantu (False Horn), Asamienu (True Horn), Oniaba (intermediate French plantain) and FHIA- 21 (tetraploid hybrid plantain) were tested to determine their response to the PIBS technique. <b>Sword</b> <b>suckers</b> of each cultivar with weight of between 0. 2 - 0. 5 kg were prepared and buried in fine sawdust in a humidity chamber built using transparent polyethylene sheets. Results at harvest showed that removal of rooted sprouts started three weeks after planting and every week thereafter for eight weeks. The intermediate French plantain cultivar (Oniaba) produced the least average number (about 20) of healthy planting. Apantu (False Horn) produced an average of about 75 healthy planting materials. The hybrid FHIA- 21 on the other hand generated an average of about 85 healthy planting materials. Asamienu (True Horn) produced the highest healthy seedlings of about 90 healthy planting materials. The results revealed that the leaf scar carries a primary bud at the intersection of each leaf sheath and several eyes along {{the entire length of the}} leaf sheath which could not have developed into suckers. However, with this technique the eyes could be activated to sprout as healthy planting materials. The technique proved as an efficient method of multiplying healthy planting materials for plantain and could thus be recommended for adoption not only by peasant farmers but also to others who could become commercial seed producers. But there will be a need for certification guidelines for seed growing systems...|$|R
40|$|Banana {{is one of}} {{the common}} fruit {{preferences}} in the world. The market demand for this crop is increasing year round. Tissue-cultured banana seedlings is getting widely used as planting materials for the growers with its quality assured properties, particularly tor commercial plantation. However, most of the small scale growers are still using conventional planting sources (water <b>suckers</b> and <b>sword</b> <b>suckers).</b> They do not prefer tissue-cultured seedlings due to its expensive price, delicate to handle and often result in high post-transplanting mortality rate. The considerably high cost is due to the process of producing the tissue-cultured seedlings at the nursery stage (acclimatization). Even at the nursery stage the conventional acclimatization process of the plantlets in the nursery results in. non-uniformity of establishment and high mortality rate. Research was conducted to develop a nursery technique that will improve these drawbacks in order to implement greater acceptance and responsive level for the growers towards tissue-cultured seedlings. Based on the results, the developed technique has increase the survival rate (reducing mortality rate) of seedlings as compared to the conventional technique. In addition, this developed technique can be adopted on-farm instead of using protected nursery as conventionally practiced. Using this technique, the seedlings would be more easily adapted to the farm after transplanting. Ordinary farmers prefer younger seedlings (10 - 15 cm in height) for planting as they growing faster than that of older seedlings with common quality (15 - 25 cm in height). Therefore, girth size of seedlings would be the higher consideration in meeting the requirement for transplanting purpose. The developed technique has shown better growth performance in both height and girth parameters in the first 36 days as compared to conventional technique. Meaning that, this helps to shorten the nursery period and create an alternative standard for seedlings to be transplanted...|$|R
40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the effect of}} altitude on growth and yield of five commonly grown plantain (Musa, AAB) cultivars at four sites, Mavivi (1, 066 m a. s. l.), Maboya (1, 412 m a. s. l.), Butembo (1, 815 m a. s. l.) and Ndihira (2, 172 m a. s. l.) in North Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo. The cultivars included three 'French' plantains ('Nguma', 'Vuhindi' and 'Vuhembe') and two 'False Horn' types ('Kotina' and 'Musilongo'). Fifteen vigorous <b>sword</b> <b>suckers</b> of each cultivar were planted in three replicates of five plants, at each site. Growth and yield parameters were assessed for the plant crop and three subsequent ratoon cycles. High altitude and corresponding lower temperatures significantly increased suckering and crop cycle duration, whereas it {{reduced the number of}} functional leaves and yield. For example, all cultivars produced more suckers at 2, 172 m a. s. l. (9 - 11 suckers) and 1, 815 m a. s. l. (5 - 7), compared with 3 - 4 at 1, 412 m a. s. l. and only two suckers at 1, 066 m a. s. l. In contrast, all cultivars had a low bunch yield (2 - 3 kg) at 2, 172 m a. s. l. compared with 19 - 25 kg at 1, 815 m a. s. l., 19 - 23 kg at 1, 412 m a. s. l. and 23 - 33 kg at 1, 066 m a. s. l. Most bunches across the cultivars at 2, 172 m a. s. l. were only partially developed, and unfit for consumption or the market. Choke throat symptoms were also observed and were associated with the year round low minimum temperatures (10. 4 - 12. 3 °C) at this altitude. Plantains adapted to high altitude need to be sought and evaluated at the high altitude sites in North Kivu (1, 815 and 2, 172 m a. s. l.). The high altitude sites (e. g., at 2, 172 m a. s. l.) that are also free of banana pests could however be beneficial for establishment of mother gardens for clean planting material multiplication because sucker development is enhanced at these elevations.

40|$|The {{suitability}} of sugarcane juice for the in vitro culture of bananas and plantains {{was investigated in}} this study. Two concentrations of sugar cane juice 5, 10 % and 30 g L - 1 laboratory sucrose were used. There was also a control medium without carbon source. Explants were prepared from field grown <b>sword</b> <b>suckers.</b> The preparation of the explants involved, sterilization with 70 % ethanol, followed by 1 % Sodium hypochlorite+ 1 % tween 20. The explants were cultured at 26 °C, under 16 h photoperiod, light intensity of 3000 lux and a relative humidity of 60 %. Plants that were cultured on 5 % sugarcane juice had higher average fresh weight values of 16. 6 g per plant compared to those that were cultured on the 30 g L - 1 sucrose and 10 % sugarcane juice which had fresh weight of 15. 6 g per plant and 11. 0 g per plant, respectively. Oniba had higher fresh weight on medium supplemented with 5 % sugarcane juice compared to the two other cultivars. In terms of dry weight, ‘Oniaba’ again had the highest value of 7. 2 g per plant which was obtained on medium supplemented with 5 % sugarcane juice. Plants that were cultured on 5 % sugarcane juice were better in terms of shoot height and number of shoots per plant than those cultured on 30 g L - 1 sucrose and {{the differences between the}} 5 % sugarcane juice and the other treatments were statistically different. The various carbon sources and their concentrations also affected the water potential of the media. Medium supplemented with 10 % sugarcane juice had the lowest water potential of - 0. 8 MPa compared to the control medium that had a water potential of - 0. 1 MPa. Medium supplemented with 5 % sugarcane juice and 30 g L - 1 sucrose had in a medium water potential of - 0. 3 MPa.
