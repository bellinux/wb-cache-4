5|$|In November, Chaplin {{began working}} with Cherrill again {{in some of the}} Flower Girl's less {{dramatic}} scenes. While waiting for her scenes for several months, Cherrill had become bored and openly complained to Chaplin. During the filming of one scene, Cherrill asked Chaplin if she could leave early so that she could go to a hair appointment. Chaplin fired Virginia Cherrill and replaced her with Georgia Hale, Chaplin's co-star in The Gold Rush. However, Hale's screen tests proved that she was unsuitable for the role. Chaplin also briefly considered sixteen-year-old actress Violet Krauth, but he was talked out of this idea by his collaborators. Chaplin finally re-hired Cherrill to finish City Lights. <b>She</b> <b>demanded</b> and got a raise to $75 per week. Approximately seven minutes of test footage of Hale survives and is included on the DVD release; excerpts were first seen in the documentary Unknown Chaplin along with an unused opening sequence.|$|E
5|$|Kim {{successfully}} defended her title against Taryn Terrell on the September 3 {{episode of}} Impact Wrestling. After the match, Kim and Terrell were both {{attacked by the}} debuting Havok. Kim and Havok brawled on the following edition of Impact Wrestling. In September, Kim injured her shoulder during a pre-match brawl with Havok. Going against doctors advice, Kim defended her title later that night and lost her championship to Havok. Soon after, {{it was announced that}} Kim had suffered a separated shoulder and torn ligaments at the hands of Havok, and would be out of action indefinitely. Kim returned to Impact Wrestling in November, however her shoulder was not fully healed. Despite this, <b>she</b> <b>demanded</b> her rematch for the Knockouts title against Havok, which Kim would ultimately lose.|$|E
5|$|On 6 May 1910, Edward VII died. Mary's husband {{ascended the}} throne as King George V, {{and she became}} queen consort. When her husband asked her to drop one of her two {{official}} names, Victoria Mary, she chose to be called Mary, preferring {{not to take the}} name of her husband's grandmother, Queen Victoria. Queen Mary was crowned with the King on 22 June 1911 at Westminster Abbey. Later in the year, the new King and Queen travelled to India for the Delhi Durbar held on 12 December 1911, and toured the sub-continent as Emperor and Empress of India, returning to Britain in February. The beginning of Mary's period as consort brought her into conflict with her mother-in-law, Queen Alexandra. Although the two were on friendly terms, Alexandra could be stubborn; <b>she</b> <b>demanded</b> precedence over Mary at the funeral of Edward VII, was slow in leaving Buckingham Palace, and kept some of the royal jewels that should have been passed to the new Queen.|$|E

5|$|Hindley was not arrested with Brady, but <b>she</b> <b>demanded</b> to go {{with him}} to the police station, {{accompanied}} by her dog, Puppet, to which the police agreed. Hindley was questioned about the events surrounding Evans's death, but she refused to make any statement beyond claiming that it had been an accident. As the police had no evidence that Hindley was involved in Evans's murder, she was allowed to go home, on the condition that she return the next day for further questioning. Hindley was at liberty for four days following Brady's arrest, during which time she went to her employer's premises and asked to be dismissed, so that she would be eligible for unemployment benefits. While in the office where Brady worked, she found some papers belonging to him in an envelope that she claimed she did not open, which she burned in an ashtray. She believed that they were plans for bank robberies, {{nothing to do with the}} murders. On 11 October, Hindley was charged as an accessory to the murder of Edward Evans and was remanded at Risley.|$|E

25|$|To assist Clara with {{overcoming}} her shyness, {{her parents}} persuaded {{her to become}} a schoolteacher. She achieved her first teacher's certificate in 1839, at only 17 years old. This profession interested Barton greatly and helped motivate her; she ended up conducting an effective redistricting campaign that allowed the children of workers to receive an education. Successful projects such as this gave Clara the confidence needed when <b>she</b> <b>demanded</b> equal pay for teaching.|$|E
25|$|At that time, {{students}} {{had the option}} of doing a Pass degree, which consisted of 'a disorderly collection of fragmented learning', or an Honours degree, which at that time meant the Mathematics Tripos, classics, natural or moral sciences. An Honours degree was considered more challenging than the Pass degree. In 1869, Henry Sidgwick helped institute the Examinations for Women, which was designed to be of intermediate difficulty. This idea was heavily opposed by Emily Davies, as <b>she</b> <b>demanded</b> admittance to the Tripos examinations.|$|E

25|$|Later, Sarah {{gave birth}} to Isaac, and {{the tension between the}} women returned. At a celebration after Isaac was weaned, Sarah found the teenage Ishmael mocking her son. She was so upset by it that <b>she</b> <b>demanded</b> that Abraham send Hagar and her son away. She {{declared}} that Ishmael would not share in Isaac's inheritance. Abraham was greatly distressed but God told Abraham to do as his wife commanded because God's promise would be carried out through both Isaac and Ishmael.|$|E
25|$|Rigg was {{initially}} {{unhappy with the}} way she was treated by the show's producers. During her first series she learned she was being paid less than the camera man. <b>She</b> <b>demanded</b> a raise, to put her more on a par with her co-star, or she would leave the show. The producers gave in, thanks to the show's great popularity in the US. At the end of the fifth series in 1967, Rigg left to pursue other projects. This included following Honor Blackman to play a leading role in a James Bond film, in this case On Her Majesty's Secret Service as James Bond's wife Tracy Bond.|$|E
25|$|Cornelia Otis Skinner {{wrote that}} one of La Pa√Øva's conquests was Adolphe Gaiffe, a banker of whom <b>she</b> <b>demanded</b> twenty {{banknotes}} of one thousand francs each -- which, she stipulated, he must burn one by one during a scheduled 30 minutes of lovemaking. The banker decided to substitute counterfeit banknotes. Even so, the sight of their incineration was so unnerving {{that he could not}} accomplish his part of the tryst. Another source, however, states that the courtesan burned the notes, one by one, during her sexual congress with Gaiffe, who bet his friends {{he would be able to}} access her favors without payment -- and so he did, because the money was fake.|$|E

25|$|But {{these letters}} also show {{the will of}} Queen Victoria to dictate her daughter's every move. <b>She</b> <b>demanded</b> that Victoria appear equally loyal to her {{homeland}} and her new country. But this quickly became impossible, and the most insignificant events confronted the princess with insoluble problems. For example, {{the death of a}} distant relative of the British and Prussian royal houses brought a month of mourning in London, while in Berlin the mourning period lasted only one week. Victoria was bound to respect the period of mourning in use among the Hohenzollerns, but this earned her the criticism of her mother, who believed that, as a Princess Royal and daughter of the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Victoria should follow the custom in use in England.|$|E
25|$|Once, while Parvati {{wanted to}} take a bath, there were no attendants around to guard her and stop anyone from accidentally {{entering}} the house. Hence she created an image of a boy out of turmeric paste which she prepared to cleanse her body, and infused life into it, and thus Ganesha was born. Parvati ordered Ganesha not to allow anyone to enter the house, and Ganesha obediently followed his mother's orders. After a while Shiva returned and tried to enter the house, Ganesha stopped him. Shiva was infuriated, lost his temper and severed the boy's head with his trident. When Parvati came out and saw her son's lifeless body, she was very angry. <b>She</b> <b>demanded</b> that Shiva restore Ganesha's life at once. Shiva did so by attaching an elephant's head to Ganesha's body, thus giving rise to the elephant headed deity.|$|E
25|$|In {{the next}} year, Richelieu's {{position}} was seriously threatened by his former patron, Marie de M√©dicis. Marie {{believed that the}} Cardinal had robbed her of her political influence; thus, <b>she</b> <b>demanded</b> that her son dismiss the chief minister. Louis XIII was not, at first, averse to such a course of action, as he personally disliked Richelieu. Despite this, the persuasive statesman was able to secure the king as an ally against his own mother. On 11 November 1630, Marie de M√©dicis and the King's brother, Gaston, duc d'Orl√©ans, secured the King's agreement for the dismissal. Richelieu, however, {{was aware of the}} plan, and quickly convinced the King to repent. This day, known as the Day of the Dupes, was the only one on which Louis XIII took a step toward dismissing his minister. Thereafter, the King was unwavering in his political support for him.|$|E

25|$|The Paris Indian Society, {{a branch}} of the IHRS, was {{launched}} in 1905 under the patronage of Bhikaji Cama, Sardar Singh Rana and B.H. Godrej. A number of India House members who later rose to prominence‚Äì including V.N. Chatterjee, Har Dayal and Acharya and others‚Äì first encountered the IHRS through this Paris Indian Society. Cama herself was at this time deeply involved with the Indian revolutionary cause, and she nurtured close links with both French and exiled Russian socialists. Lenin's views are thought to have influenced Cama's works at this time, and Lenin is believed to have visited India House during one of his stays in London. In 1907, Cama, along with V.N. Chatterjee and S.R. Rana, attended the Socialist Congress of the Second International in Stuttgart. There, supported by Henry Hyndman, <b>she</b> <b>demanded</b> recognition of self-rule for India and in a famous gesture unfurled one of the first Flags of India.|$|E
25|$|Grand Duchess Olga was {{witty and}} had a strong personality. Her sharp tongue brought her {{a lot of trouble}} at the Russian court. She despised the morganatic wife of Alexander II and later she was {{particularly}} indignant at Alexander III's decision {{to limit the number of}} Grand Dukes, a title her own grandchildren would be deprived of. While her husband busied himself with his military and governmental career, Grand Duchess Olga ruled her family with an iron hand. <b>She</b> <b>demanded</b> complete obedience from her children. She was particularly close to her eldest son Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich of Russia, whose intellectual interests were like hers, but she remained aloof and cold towards the others. Her second son, Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich, who was not intellectually gifted (she called him a fool), was a constant source of disappointment for her. In 1879, Olga with Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna arranged the marriage between her only daughter, Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna of Russia, with Frederick Francis III, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Maria Pavlovna's brother. Anastasia carried some bitterness about her upbringing and relationship with her mother - her daughter C√§cilie recounts that at a party to celebrate her engagement, when she committed some infraction she was sent to bed by Olga like a naughty child. There was also an incident involving an apricot tree, which belonged to Anastasia but whose fruit she was not allowed to eat.|$|E
