30|$|Introduction The {{involvement}} of ICUs {{in support of}} vital functions of failures among patients suffering from mental disorders has been reinforced by recent years. Few studies {{address the issue of}} the reconciliation between <b>somatic</b> <b>medical</b> disciplines and psychiatry.|$|R
30|$|Calibration of {{dosimeters}} for <b>medical</b> <b>applications</b> {{is currently}} performed using secondary standards non-specific to the radiation fields used in <b>medical</b> <b>application</b> of ionising radiation leading to undefined measurement uncertainties. Therefore, exact measurements require calibration against radiation fields specific to <b>medical</b> <b>applications.</b>|$|R
40|$|Background There are {{thousands}} of <b>medical</b> <b>applications</b> for mobile devices targeting use by healthcare professionals. However, several factors related {{to the structure of}} the existing market for <b>medical</b> <b>applications</b> create significant barriers preventing practitioners from effectively identifying mobile <b>medical</b> <b>applications</b> for individual professional use. Aims To define existing market factors relevant to selection of <b>medical</b> <b>applications</b> and describe a framework to empower clinicians to identify, assess and utilise mobile <b>medical</b> <b>applications</b> in their own practice. Materials and Methods Resources available on the Internet regarding mobile <b>medical</b> <b>applications,</b> guidelines and published research on mobile <b>medical</b> <b>applications.</b> Results Mobile application stores (e. g. iTunes, Google Play) are not effective means of identifying mobile <b>medical</b> <b>applications.</b> Users of mobile devices that desire to implement mobile <b>medical</b> <b>applications</b> into practice need to carefully assess individual applications prior to utilisation. Discussion Searching and identifying mobile <b>medical</b> <b>applications</b> requires clinicians to utilise multiple references to determine what application is best for their individual practice methods. This can be done with a cursory exploration of mobile application stores and then moving onto other available resources published in the literature or through Internet resources (e. g. blogs, medical websites, social media). Clinicians must also take steps to ensure that an identified mobile application can be integrated into practice after carefully reviewing it themselves. Conclusion Clinicians seeking to identify mobile <b>medical</b> <b>application</b> for use in their individual practice should use a combination of app stores, published literature, web-based resources, and personal review to ensure safe and appropriate use. ...|$|R
