5|$|There is <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> {{circumcision}} {{is associated}} with lower risk of prostate cancer. A 2015 meta-analysis found a reduced risk of prostate cancer associated with circumcision in black men. A 2016 meta-analysis found that men with prostate cancer {{were less likely to}} be circumcised.|$|E
5|$|While {{evidence}} of cannon {{in the middle}} east prior to the 1360s has mostly been discredited, there is however <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> does point to the possible appearance of guns in Andalusia as early as the 1330s.|$|E

5|$|A {{field study}} of the {{invasion}} of the pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi into the Brisbane Ranges National Park in Victoria in 1971 indicated that Epacris impressa was moderately susceptible to the pathogen. Inoculation of seedlings confirmed this. Fieldwork in the Brisbane Ranges National Park in 1985 showed that there was <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> E. impressa seedlings were able to recolonise areas that had been infested with P. cinnamomi a decade before.|$|E
5|$|In psychophysiological {{research}} on attachment, {{the two main}} areas studied have been autonomic responses, such as heart rate or respiration, and {{the activity of the}} hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Infants' physiological responses have been measured during the Strange Situation procedure looking at individual differences in infant temperament {{and the extent to which}} attachment acts as a moderator. There is <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> the quality of caregiving shapes the development of the neurological systems which regulate stress.|$|E
5|$|Many predators feed on {{the milk}} shark, {{including}} larger sharks such as the blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) and Australian blacktip shark (Carcharhinus tilstoni), and possibly also marine mammals. Off KwaZulu-Natal, the decimation of large sharks {{by the use of}} gillnets to protect beaches has led to a recent increase in milk shark numbers. A known parasite of this species is the copepod Pseudopandarus australis. There is <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> male and female milk sharks segregate from each other.|$|E

5|$|Populations of Gyromitra esculenta {{appear to}} vary {{geographically}} in their toxicity. A French study {{has shown that}} mushrooms collected at higher altitudes have lower concentrations of toxin than those from lower elevations, and there is <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> fungi west of the Rocky Mountains in North America contain less toxin than those to the east. However, poisonings in the west have been reported, although less frequently than in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{administration}} of sodium bicarbonate solution to rapidly improve the acid {{levels in the}} blood is controversial. There {{is little evidence that}} it improves outcomes beyond standard therapy, and indeed <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> while it may improve the acidity of the blood, it may actually worsen acidity inside the body's cells and increase the risk of certain complications. Its use is therefore discouraged, although some guidelines recommend it for extreme acidosis (pH<6.9), and smaller amounts for severe acidosis (pH 6.9–7.0).|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet reduces seizure frequency by {{more than}} 50% in half of the patients who try it and {{by more than}} 90% in a third of patients. Three-quarters of children who respond do so within two weeks, though experts recommend a trial {{of at least three}} months before assuming it has been ineffective. Children with refractory epilepsy are more likely to benefit from the ketogenic diet than from trying another anticonvulsant drug. There is <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> adolescents and adults may also benefit from the diet.|$|E

5|$|There {{has been}} <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> {{prior to this}} charter, the royal heralds had already in some ways behaved like a {{corporation}} as early as 1420. Nevertheless, the charter is the earliest surviving document to affirm the chapter as a corporate body of heralds. The charter outlines {{the constitution of the}} officers, their hierarchy, the privileges conferred upon them and their jurisdiction over all heraldic matters in the Kingdom of England.|$|E
5|$|There is <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> {{the effect}} has {{implications}} for real-life decisions. In the lab, people disproportionately favor brands matching their initials. An analysis of a large database of charity donations revealed that a disproportionately {{large number of people}} donate to disaster relief following hurricanes with names sharing their initial letter (e.g. Kate and Kevin following Hurricane Katrina). Studies that investigate the impact of name-letter matching on bigger life decisions (where to live, whom to marry, which occupation to take on) are controversial.|$|E
5|$|There is <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> the {{youngest}} galactic supernova, G1.9+0.3, {{occurred in the}} late 19th century, considerably more recently than Cassiopeia A from around 1680. Neither supernova was noted at the time. In the case of G1.9+0.3, high extinction along {{the plane of the}} galaxy could have dimmed the event sufficiently to go unnoticed. The situation for Cassiopeia A is less clear. Infrared light echos have been detected showing that it was a type IIb supernova and was not in a region of especially high extinction.|$|E

5|$|A {{string of}} forts was {{constructed}} in the north-east (some of which may date from the earlier Antonine campaign). These include camps associated with the Elsick Mounth, such as Normandykes, Ythan Wells, Deers Den and Glenmailen. However, only two forts in Scotland, at Cramond and Carpow (in the Tay valley) are definitely {{known to have been}} permanently occupied during this incursion before the troops were withdrawn again to Hadrian's Wall circa 213. There is <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> these campaigns are coincident with the wholesale destruction and abandonment of souterrains in southern Scotland. This may have been due either to Roman military aggression or the collapse of local grain markets in the wake of Roman withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} central bank {{interventions}} on the US dollar and Deutsche mark found only limited {{evidence of any}} substantial effect on deviations from UIRP. UIRP {{has been found to}} hold over very small spans of time (covering only a number of hours) with a high frequency of bilateral exchange rate data. Tests of UIRP for economies experiencing institutional regime changes, using monthly exchange rate data for the US dollar versus the Deutsche mark and the Spanish peseta versus the British pound, have found <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> UIRP held when US and German regime changes were volatile, and held between Spain and the United Kingdom particularly after Spain joined the European Union in 1986 and began liberalizing capital mobility.|$|E
5|$|After {{teaching}} as a master of arts in Paris for over forty years, Robert was recalled to England by King Henry II in 1160, and was appointed Bishop of Hereford in 1163. He was consecrated at Canterbury on 22December by Archbishop Thomas Becket. Becket had been prominent among those recommending Robert for the vacancy at Hereford; one of Becket's later biographers said that Becket urged the king to find benefices for Englishmen living abroad. There is <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> Pope Alexander III {{had a hand in}} Robert's election, as Becket in 1166 reminded Robert and Roger of Worcester that they both owed their episcopates to Alexander.|$|E

5|$|Although modest {{about his}} own {{abilities}} and generous in his praise of other cricketers, Bradman was {{fully aware of the}} talents he possessed as a player; there is <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> he sought to influence his legacy. During the 1980s and 1990s, Bradman carefully selected the people to whom he gave interviews, assisting Michael Page, Roland Perry and Charles Williams, who all produced biographical works about him. Bradman also agreed to an extensive interview for ABC radio, broadcast as Bradman: The Don Declares in eight 55-minute episodes during 1988.|$|E
5|$|Alveolar osteitis is a {{complication}} of tooth extraction (especially lower wisdom teeth) {{in which the}} blood clot is not formed or is lost, leaving the socket where the tooth used to be empty, and bare bone is exposed to the mouth. The pain is moderate to severe, and dull, aching, and throbbing in character. The pain is localized to the socket, and may radiate. It normally starts two to {{four days after the}} extraction, and may last 10–40 days. Healing is delayed, and it is treated with local anesthetic dressings, which are typically required for five to seven days. There is <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> chlorhexidine mouthwash used prior to extractions prevents alveolar osteitis.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of a number of conditions, including fever, pain, rheumatic fever, and inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, pericarditis, and Kawasaki disease. Lower doses of aspirin have also been shown {{to reduce the risk of}} death from a heart attack, or the risk of stroke in some circumstances. There is <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> aspirin is effective at preventing colorectal cancer, though the mechanisms of this effect are unclear. In the United States low dose aspirin is deemed reasonable in those between 50 and 70 years old who have a more than 10% risk of cardiovascular disease and are not at an increased risk of bleeding who are otherwise healthy.|$|E
