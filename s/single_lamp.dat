25|$|Where {{junction}} {{indicators are}} unsuitable, route indicators {{are also used}} in colour-light areas. They may {{take the form of}} a dot-matrix of white lamps, or, in more recent installations, fibre-optic displays driven from a <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> to display the route code. At certain locations, no route indication is given for the highest-speed route. As with semaphore route indicators, they are usually restricted to areas where all routes are at low speed, often on the approach or departure from large stations.|$|E
25|$|In {{the past}} use {{was made of}} {{searchlight}} signals; these have a <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> in front of which is placed either a red, yellow or green filter to show the respective aspect. The filter assembly is moved by an electro-magnet. For a double-yellow aspect a second lamp is fitted, illuminated only when required. A few traditional searchlight signals (i.e. with moving glasses inside) remain in use in the Clacton area, but the concept had a renaissance in the 2000’s {{with the advent of}} LEDs which can show three different colours.|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} is a {{laser head}} for simultaneous pumping several dye lasers with a <b>single</b> flash <b>lamp.</b> The laser head includes primarily a multi-elliptical cylinder cavity with a <b>single</b> flash <b>lamp</b> placed along the common focal {{axis of the}} cavity and with capillary tube dye cells placed along {{each of the other}} focal axes of the cavity. The inside surface of the cavity is polished. Hence, the <b>single</b> flash <b>lamp</b> supplies the energy to the several dye cells...|$|R
50|$|Italian {{light signals}} consist {{of one to}} three <b>single</b> <b>lamps.</b> At least the upper lamp is always turned on. The lights can be fixed or flashing. In {{candlestick}} signals, each arm has one or two lights. At least one light of each arm is on.|$|R

25|$|Proponents of twin rear {{fog lamps}} say two lamps provide vehicle {{distance}} information not available from a <b>single</b> <b>lamp.</b> Proponents of the single rear fog lamp say dual {{rear fog lamps}} closely mimic the appearance of illuminated stop lamps (which are mandatorily installed in pairs), reducing the conspicuity of the stop lamps' message when the rear fogs are activated. To provide some safeguard against rear fog lamps being confused with stop lamps, UN Regulation 48 requires a separation of at least 10cm between the closest illuminated edges of any stop lamp and any rear fog lamp.|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} large classes of locomotive, {{there were some}} {{variations}} during the Class 24s' lifetime, some affecting all of the class (nominally), and others just individual locos. One such locomotive was 24133, {{one of the last}} survivors of the class and easily recognised as it had different headcode boxes on each end, the standard one for the class at one end and that at the other end matching those used on the Class 27. This was not unique, as 24145 had a headcode box similar to those fitted to later batches of Class 25s. In each case, this is likely to be due to collision damage repairs. Some Inverness-based locomotives had 'car lights' fitted to each nose. These were after-market car headlamps mounted in the plated-over nose doors, to provide extra visibility to users of level crossings on sharply curved branch lines. D5114-132 had pairs mounted in each nose. These were removed between 1975/6, with small plates welded over the apertures. 12 Class 26s had similar modifications, some having pairs and others having a <b>single</b> <b>lamp.</b> Examples of Class 37s, Class 47s and a solitary Class 86 had single railway spotlights installed at each end but the Class 24s and Class 26s were the only ones fitted with proper car headlamps.|$|E
25|$|Alternating current {{systems can}} use {{transformers}} to change voltage from low to high level and back, allowing generation and consumption at low voltages but transmission, possibly over great distances, at high voltage, with savings {{in the cost}} of conductors and energy losses. A bipolar open-core power transformer developed by Lucien Gaulard and John Dixon Gibbs was demonstrated in London in 1881, and attracted the interest of Westinghouse. They also exhibited the invention in Turin in 1884. However these early induction coils with open magnetic circuits are inefficient at transferring power to loads. Until about 1880, the paradigm for AC power transmission from a high voltage supply to a low voltage load was a series circuit. Open-core transformers with a ratio near 1:1 were connected with their primaries in series to allow use of a high voltage for transmission while presenting a low voltage to the lamps. The inherent flaw in this method was that turning off a <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> (or other electric device) affected the voltage supplied to all others on the same circuit. Many adjustable transformer designs were introduced to compensate for this problematic characteristic of the series circuit, including those employing methods of adjusting the core or bypassing the magnetic flux around part of a coil. The direct current systems did not have these drawbacks, giving it significant advantages over early AC systems.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} year of {{operation}} for the company, a ten per cent dividend was paid to shareholders from profits. By 1894 13 per cent of business and street lighting in Geelong was gas powered. In the City of Geelong there were 263 street gas lamps, in the City of Newtown and Chilwell there were 48, in the City of Geelong West there were 45, and there was a <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> in the Shire of South Barwon. The street lights used gave the equivalent light of 15 sperm candles for each [...] of gas burnt. However, by 1913 most of the [...] major street lighting contracts had been lost to electricity.|$|E
2500|$|In 1940 he got {{the lead}} role in Rodgers and Hart's Pal Joey, again choreographed by Robert Alton. This role {{propelled}} him to stardom. During its run he told reporters: [...] "I don't believe in conformity to any school of dancing. I create what the drama and the music demand. While I am a hundred percent for ballet technique, I use only what I can adapt to my own use. I never let technique {{get in the way}} of mood or continuity." [...] His colleagues at this time noticed his great commitment to rehearsal and hard work. Van Johnson—who also appeared in Pal Joey—recalled: [...] "I watched him rehearsing, and it seemed to me that there was no possible room for improvement. Yet he wasn't satisfied. It was midnight and we had been rehearsing since eight in the morning. I was making my way sleepily down the long flight of stairs when I heard staccato steps coming from the stage...I could see just a <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> burning. Under it, a figure was dancing...Gene." ...|$|E

60|$|Before he {{was fairly}} {{aware of his}} attendant's meaning Serviss found himself thrust through a heavily curtained archway into a large room dimly lighted by a <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> at the farther end.

60|$|John Strangewey ushered his {{companion}} into the square, oak-paneled hall, hung with many trophies of the chase, a few oil-paintings, {{here and there}} some sporting prints.

60|$|Silently, {{he strode}} into the apartment, a small {{antechamber}} off a large hall.

In {{the center of the}} room was a table, and at the sides several benches.|$|E
60|$|It {{was late}} at night, but Gladwyne sat, cigar in hand, in his library, while Batley lounged beside the hearth. A wood fire {{diffused}} a faint aromatic fragrance {{into the great}} high-ceilinged room, and {{the light of a}} <b>single</b> silver <b>lamp</b> flickered on the polished floor, which ran back like a sheet of black ice into the shadow. Heavily-corniced bookcases rose above it on either band, conveying an idea of space and distance by the way they grew dimmer as they receded from the light.|$|R
60|$|The room {{he entered}} was lighted by a bright fire, and a <b>single</b> {{electric}} <b>lamp</b> with an orange shade {{on a table}} covered by a black satin cloth. There were heavily gleaming oil paintings on the walls, a heavy old brass chandelier without candles, heavy dark red curtains, and an indefinable scent of burnt acorns, coffee, cigars, and old man. He became conscious of a candescent spot {{on the far side}} of the hearth, where the light fell on old Heythorp's thick white hair.|$|R

60|$|We all {{had good}} reason to join in the aspiration; for our vigil was a long and bitter one. Slowly the shadows darkened over the long, sombre face of the old house. A cold, damp reek from the moat chilled us to the bones and set our teeth chattering. There was a <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> over the gateway and a steady globe of light in the fatal study.
