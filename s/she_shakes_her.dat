60|$|My Lady's lips move, {{but they}} utter nothing. <b>She</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> head.|$|E
60|$|CHARTERIS (recoiling). Who {{told you}} that? (<b>She</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> head mysteriously, {{and he turns}} away from her moodily and adds) You had much better not have asked.|$|E
6000|$|MR. WILLINGS. 'Your son, Mrs. Dowey--he has {{got five}} days' leave.' <b>She</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> head slightly, {{or perhaps it}} only trembles a little on its stem. 'Now, now, good news doesn't kill.' ...|$|E
60|$|Anderssen {{held out}} the chubby infant, but <b>she</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> head.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> head violently, and {{brow and}} neck turned crimson.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> head, {{and denied}} the {{imputation}} with much disgust.|$|R
60|$|There is {{emotion in}} Sir John's tone. It is very rough {{on him to}} find his plan of going to Kafoonistan has been outdone by Mrs. Harding's going to Balla Walla. <b>She</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> head.|$|E
60|$|For when in {{time the}} martial maid Found out the trick that Venus played, <b>She</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> helm, she knits her brows, And fired with indignation, vows To-morrow, ere the setting sun, She'd all undo that she had done.|$|E
6000|$|... "We all ken what sailors are," [...] is {{her dark}} way of denouncing {{those who go}} down to the sea in ships, and then <b>she</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> head and purses up her mouth as if she could tell things about sailors that would make our hair rise.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> head, {{interrupting}} {{him with}} a quick little gesture.|$|R
60|$|Lady Conyers {{watched her}} {{daughter}} searchingly. Then <b>she</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> head.|$|R
60|$|The {{girl was}} silent a moment; then <b>she</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> head, lightly.|$|R
6000|$|BURNEY, the maid, a {{girl with}} one of those flowery Botticellian [...] faces only met with in England, comes in through the curtained [...] door, which she leaves open, {{disclosing}} the glimpse of a white [...] wall. PAYNTER looks up at her; <b>she</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> head, with an [...] expression of concern.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} calling Ellen Wade, {{who is on the}} rock keeping the look-out, to know if there is any thing to be seen," [...] {{observed}} the eldest of the young men; [...] "and <b>she</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> head, for an answer. Ellen is sparing of her words for a woman; and might be taught manners at least, without spoiling her good looks." ...|$|E
6000|$|STEVE, soothingly, 'Come now, we won't go {{into that}} again. It was just a mistake; and {{now that it is}} all settled and done with, I'll tell you what we shall do. You will let me get you a cab--' <b>She</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> head. 'I promise not to listen to the address; and after you have had a good night you--you will see things differently.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> head {{without looking}} at him, like an abashed child.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> head, and {{sheltered}} the drawing-book again {{under her}} shawl.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> head, {{smiling as}} though not ill-pleased at the compliment.|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor Grizel!" [...] she echoed. [...] "You are {{not angry}} with me, are you, for being almost sorry for her? She {{used to be}} so different. 'Where is your independence, Grizel?' I say to her, and <b>she</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> sorrowful head. The little girl I used to be need not look for me any more; if we were to meet in the Den she would not know me now." ...|$|E
6000|$|THE YOUNG LADY (with cool insolence). Well, so you have! (She gets up.) Why shouldn't you? it's your {{business}} to hurt people. (It amuses {{him to be}} treated in this fashion: he chuckles secretly as he proceeds to clean and replace his instruments. <b>She</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> dress into order; looks inquisitively about her; {{and goes to the}} window.) You have {{a good view of the}} sea from these rooms! Are they expensive? ...|$|E
60|$|MISS GILPIN (as he {{is about}} to hand it to her--decisively). No, my dear, you mustn't. Put the case right down there, Mr. Nicholls. I'll have it taken to Miss Carmody's room in a moment. (<b>She</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> finger at Eileen with kindly admonition.) That's the first rule you'll have to learn. Never exert {{yourself}} or tax your strength. It's very important. You'll find laziness is a virtue instead of a vice with us.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} her {{expression}} was almost hopeless. <b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> head.|$|R
60|$|There was a moment's deep silence. <b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> head very slowly.|$|R
60|$|The colour {{faded from}} her face again, and <b>she</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> head sadly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! You {{know what}} Ma is, Esther," [...] she returned. [...] "It's {{impossible}} to say whether she knows it or not. She has been told it often enough; and when she IS told it, she only gives me a placid look, as if I was I don't know what--a steeple in the distance," [...] said Caddy with a sudden idea; [...] "and then <b>she</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> head and says 'Oh, Caddy, Caddy, what a tease you are!' and goes on with the Borrioboola letters." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{does not}} seem to have much to do with it," [...] she said doubtfully, [...] "and yet, perhaps it does. You know my mother is not quite of the same opinion as my father, {{although}} she never says so to him; but, when we are alone together, sometimes <b>she</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> head and says she fears that trouble is coming, and it makes her very unhappy. One day I was in the garden, and they were talking loudly in the dining room--at least, he was talking loudly. Well, he said--But I don't know whether I ought to tell you, Charlie." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aha, Mrs. Gripper, {{there you}} are with your pots and pans, and your burning fiery furnace! One had need be Shadrach, Meshach, and the other fellow to stand over that. Breakfast as soon as ever you like. Eggs, sausages, bacon, kidneys, marmalade, water-cresses, coffee, and so forth. My friend and I belong to the select few whom it's a perfect {{privilege}} to cook for. Voluptuaries, Mrs. Gripper, voluptuaries, both of us. You'll see," [...] continued Allan, as they went on toward the stairs, [...] "I shall make that worthy creature young again; I'm better than a doctor for Mrs. Gripper. When she laughs, <b>she</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> fat sides, and when <b>she</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> fat sides, she exerts her muscular system; and when she exerts her muscular system--Ha! here's Susan again. Don't squeeze yourself flat against the banisters, my dear; if you don't mind hustling me on the stairs, I rather like hustling you. She looks like a full-blown rose when she blushes, doesn't she? Stop, Susan! I've orders to give. Be very particular with Mr. Midwinter's room: shake up his bed like mad, and dust his furniture till those nice round arms of yours ache again. Nonsense, my dear fellow! I'm not too familiar with them; I'm only keeping them up to their work. Now, then, Richard! where do we breakfast? Oh, here. Between ourselves, Midwinter, these splendid rooms of mine are a size too large for me; I don't feel as if I should ever be on intimate terms with my own furniture. My views in life are of the snug and slovenly sort--a kitchen chair, you know, and a low ceiling. Man wants but little here below, and wants that little long. That's not exactly the right quotation; but it expresses my meaning, and we'll let alone correcting it till the next opportunity." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{girl looked}} {{doubtful}} for a moment, and then <b>she</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> head.|$|R
60|$|Again the blankness of non-comprehension. <b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> head {{at him and}} smiled.|$|R
60|$|Amanda Trivett listened attentively, but, when I had finished, <b>she</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> head.|$|R
6000|$|Ashley, without noting her protest: [...] "I had {{forgotten}} that I had a corkscrew in my pocket-knife. Don't trouble yourself to ring for one." [...] He produces {{the knife and}} opens the bottle; then, as Miss Ramsey rises and stands aghast, he pours out a glass and offers it to her, with mock devotion. As <b>she</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> head and recoils: [...] "Oh! I thought you liked cocktails. They are very good after cigarettes--very reviving. But if you won't--" [...] He tosses off the cocktail and sets down the glass, smacking his lips. [...] "Tell your brother I commend his taste--in cocktails and"--puffing his cigarette--"tobacco. Poison for poison, let me offer you one of my cigarettes. They're milder than these." [...] He puts {{his hand to his}} breast pocket.|$|E
6000|$|... "And a most {{remarkable}} recovery too," [...] Alban informed her. [...] "It {{is the first}} case on record of any person getting over such an injury as she has received. Doctor Allday looked grave when he heard of it. 'I begin {{to believe in the}} devil,' he said; 'nobody else could have saved Mrs. Rook.' Other people don't take that view. She has been celebrated in all the medical newspapers--and she has been admitted to come excellent almshouse, to live in comfortable idleness to a green old age. The best of it is that <b>she</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> head, when her wonderful recovery is mentioned. 'It seems such a pity,' she says; 'I was so fit for heaven.' Mr. Rook having got rid of his wife, is in excellent spirits. He is occupied in looking after an imbecile old gentleman; and, when he is asked if he likes the employment, he winks mysteriously and slaps his pocket. Now, Miss Ladd, I think it's my turn to hear some news. What have you got to tell me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is one of}} my expiring efforts," [...] she declared, {{sinking into}} the chair by his side. [...] "You know whose party it is, of course? Old Lady Torrington's. Quite a boy and girl affair. Twenty-four of us had dinner in the worst corner of the room. I can hear the old lady {{ordering}} the dinner now. Charles with a long menu. <b>She</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> head and taps him on the wrist with her fan. 'Monsieur Charles, I am a poor woman. Give me what there is--a small, plain dinner--and charge me at your minimum.' The dinner was very small and very plain, the champagne was horribly sweet. My partner talked of a new drill, his last innings for the Household Brigade, and a wonderful round of golf he played last Sunday week. I was turned on to dance with a man who asked me to marry him, a year ago, and I could feel him vibrating with gratitude, as he looked at me, that I had refused. I suppose I am very haggard." ...|$|E
60|$|Patsey {{had spoken}} very few words during the day. <b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> head.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> {{head and}} smiled up at him. She was immensely interested.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> head emphatically, {{and said}} {{something}} that I failed to catch.|$|R
