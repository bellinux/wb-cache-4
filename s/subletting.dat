25|$|Italian {{girls in}} Boston rarely {{went to work}} as domestics because they were {{expected}} to sleep under their parents' roof until they were married. Some women worked in the market gardens and farms around Boston, and in the factories and shops in town. Others were seamstresses.

50|$|On August 7, 1872, John Wesley Hardin and Phil <b>Sublet</b> {{got into}} a {{gambling}} dispute at John Gates' Saloon. The saloon was a plank structure with a bar and a ten pin alley. After making peace, <b>Sublet</b> left the saloon and called out Hardin from the street south of the front door. Hardin appeared at that door and <b>Sublet</b> fired one shot at him. Hardin returnedfire not intending to kill him. Distracted, Hardin was pulled into a middle door and <b>Sublet</b> wounded him with the other barrel of his shotgun. Hardin then went after him through the streets and into a dry goods store. After a pistol malfunction, Hardin fired again and hit <b>Sublet</b> in the shoulder. Too weak from his wounds, Hardin was unable to pursue him.|$|R

25|$|Landowners {{frequently}} cultivated {{their land}} themselves, but could also employ a husbandman, or rent it. The husbandman {{was bound to}} carry out proper cultivation, raise an average crop, and leave the field in good tilth. In case the crop failed, the Code fixed a statutory return. Land might be leased at a fixed rent, where the Code stipulates that accidental loss fell on the tenant. If leased on profit-sharing terms, the landlord and tenant shared the loss proportionally to their stipulated share of profit. If the tenant paid his rent and kept the land in good tilth, the landlord could not interfere nor forbid <b>subletting.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some {{cities have}} {{restrictions}} on <b>subletting</b> {{for a short}} period of time. In some cities, collection of a transient occupancy tax by Airbnb is required. In many cities, hosts must register with the government and obtain a permit or license. Airbnb has published a list of regulations and requirements by city; however, only cities in the United States are included. In addition, many landlords or community associations also have restrictions on short term sublets. Hosts may be required to pay income taxes on income received via Airbnb and, in the United States, Airbnb sends tax forms to hosts that have earned over $20,000 in rents and received over 200 reservations via Airbnb in a calendar year.|$|E
25|$|There are a {{huge number}} of ways of diversifying. Farmland may, for example, be {{converted}} to equestrian facilities, amenity parkland, country clubs, hotels, golf courses, camping and caravan sites. Farmers open shops, restaurants and even pubs to sell their products. The Farm Diversification Benchmarking Study, which was commissioned by DEFRA and carried out by Exeter University in conjunction with the University of Plymouth, found that 65% of full-time farming businesses had diversified, but in the June census of the preceding year (2003), the estimate was 19% of full-time farming businesses. The large discrepancy is probably because the census data excluded the letting or <b>subletting</b> of buildings. The most common kinds of diversification are probably letting of barns as warehouses and storage, letting of former farm labourers' cottages (whether as holiday cottages or on longer leases), and farm shops. The number of farm shops in the UK increased by more than 50% between 1999 and 2003.|$|E

500|$|Another {{possible}} lover was Bill Duckett. As a teenager, {{he lived}} on the same street in Camden and moved in with Whitman, living with him {{a number of years}} and serving him in various roles. Duckett was 15 when Whitman bought his house at 328 Mickle Street. From at least 1880, Duckett and his grandmother, Lydia Watson, were boarders, <b>subletting</b> space from another family at 334 Mickle Street. Because of this proximity, it is obvious that Duckett and Whitman met as neighbors. Their relationship was close, with the youth sharing Whitman's money when he had it. Whitman described their friendship as [...] "thick". Though some biographers describe him as a boarder, others identify him as a lover. Their photograph [...] is described as [...] "modeled on the conventions of a marriage portrait", part of a series of portraits of the poet with his young male friends, and encrypting male–male desire. Yet another intense relationship of Whitman with a young man was the one with Harry Stafford, with whose family Whitman stayed when at Timber Creek, and whom he first met when Stafford was 18, in 1876. Whitman gave Stafford a ring, which was returned and re-given {{over the course of a}} stormy relationship lasting several years. Of that ring, Stafford wrote to Whitman, [...] "You know when you put it on there was but one thing to part it from me, and that was death." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first upper {{division}} {{college was}} the College of the Pacific in Stockton, California, which operated as an upper-division college between 1935 and 1951, before becoming the University of the Pacific in 1961. [...] This was done {{as part of}} a plan to reduce costs and increase enrollment by <b>subletting</b> college facilities to a high school which assumed public junior college status and funding. [...] However, disagreements between the College of the Pacific and the affiliated junior college, as well as accreditation issues resulting from the arrangement, led to the abandonment of the experiment in 1951.|$|E
2500|$|These are {{official}} housing {{figures and}} may be low. [...] For example, in the Soviet Union, the figure of 26,662,400 in 1986 almost certainly underestimates shortages {{for the reason that}} it does not count shortages from large Soviet rural-urban migration; another calculation estimates shortages to be 59,917,900. By the late 1980s, Poland had an average 20-year wait time for housing, while Warsaw had between a 26- and 50-year wait time. [...] In the Soviet Union, widespread illegal <b>subletting</b> occurred at exorbitant rates. Toward the end of the Eastern Bloc allegations of misallocations and illegal distribution of housing were raised in Soviet CPSU Central Committee meetings.|$|E

2500|$|From May to September of each year, 114 tents are erected {{around the}} Great Auditorium. These tents form [...] "Tent City," [...] a {{tradition}} of the Camp Meeting Association {{that dates back to}} 1869. Each tent is connected to a shed containing a kitchen and bathroom; the sheds are also used to store the tents during the winter. Tents are in such demand that there is a waiting list of over ten years for summer rentals. Rent runs from $4,000 to $6,000 per summer. All prospective tent inhabitants are interviewed. <b>Subletting</b> of tents is not allowed; dogs, cats, and barbecuing are also prohibited. Tent inhabitants {{do not have to be}} Methodist, but they do have to support the association's spiritual missions.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the urging}} of a Crestwood salesman, Kirby and Simon {{launched}} their own comics company, Mainline Publications, in late 1953 or early 1954, <b>subletting</b> space from their friend Al Harvey's Harvey Publications at 1860 Broadway. Mainline published four titles: the Western Bullseye: Western Scout; the war comic Foxhole, since EC Comics and Atlas Comics were having success with war comics, but promoting theirs as being written and drawn by actual veterans; In Love, since their earlier romance comic Young Love was still being widely imitated; and the crime comic Police Trap, which claimed {{to be based on}} genuine accounts by law-enforcement officials. Bitter that Timely Comics' 1950s iteration, Atlas Comics, had relaunched Captain America in a new series in 1954, Kirby and Simon created Fighting American. Simon recalled, [...] "We thought we'd show them how to do Captain America". While the comic book initially portrayed the protagonist as an anti-Communist dramatic hero, Simon and Kirby turned the series into a superhero satire with the second issue, {{in the aftermath of the}} Army-McCarthy hearings and the public backlash against the Red-baiting U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the urging}} of a Crestwood salesman, Kirby and Simon {{launched}} their own comics company, Mainline Publications, securing a distribution deal with Leader News in late 1953 or early 1954, <b>subletting</b> space from their friend Al Harvey's Harvey Publications at 1860 Broadway. Mainline, which existed from 1954 to 1955, published four titles: the Western Bullseye: Western Scout; the war comic Foxhole, since EC Comics and Atlas Comics were having success with war comics, but promoting theirs as being written and drawn by actual veterans; In Love, since their earlier romance comic Young Love was still being widely imitated; and the crime comic Police Trap, which claimed {{to be based on}} genuine accounts by [...] law-enforcement officials. After the duo rearranged and republished artwork from an old Crestwood story in In Love, Crestwood refused to pay the team, who sought an audit of Crestwood's finances. Upon review, the pair's attorney's stated the company owed them $130,000 for work done over the past seven years. Crestwood paid them $10,000 in addition to their recent delayed payments. The partnership between Kirby and Simon had become strained. Simon left the industry for a career in advertising, while Kirby continued to freelance. [...] "He wanted to do other things and I stuck with comics," [...] Kirby recalled in 1971. [...] "It was fine. There was no reason to continue the partnership and we parted friends." ...|$|E

60|$|In former prosperous {{days the}} people about Castle Richmond had, as a rule, been {{better to do}} than their neighbours. Money wages had been more plentiful, {{and there had been}} little or no <b>subletting</b> of land; the {{children}} had been somewhat more neatly clothed, and the women less haggard in their faces; but this difference was hardly perceptible any longer. To them, the Miss Fitzgeralds, looking at the poverty-stricken assemblage, it almost seemed as though the misfortune of their house had brought down its immediate consequences on all who had lived within their circle; but this was the work of the famine. In those days one could rarely see any member of a peasant's family bearing in his face a look of health. The yellow meal was a useful food--the most useful, doubtless, which could at that time be found; but it was not one that was gratifying either to the eye or palate.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the course}} of the {{afternoon}} we availed ourselves of the opportunity of a return vehicle to go as far as Sandy Hill, where we passed the night. The next morning, bright and early, we got into a hired wagon and drove across the country until near night, when we paid for our passage, sent the vehicle back, and sought a tavern. At this house, where we passed the night, we heard {{a good deal of the}} [...] "Injins" [...] having made their appearance on the Littlepage lands, and many conjectures as to the probable result. We were in a township, or rather on a property that was called Mooseridge, and which had once belonged to us, but which, having been sold, and in a great measure paid for by the occupants, no one thought of impairing the force of the covenants under which the parties held. The most trivial observer will soon discover that it is only when something is to be gained that the aggrieved citizen wishes to disturb a covenant. Now, I never heard any one say a syllable against either of the covenants of his lease under which he held his farm, let him be ever so loud against those which would shortly compel him to give it up! Had I complained of the fact--and such facts abounded--that my predecessors had incautiously let farms at such low prices that the lessees had been enabled to pay the rents for half a century by <b>subletting</b> small portions of them, as my uncle Ro had intimated, I should be pointed at as a fool. [...] "Stick to your bond" [...] would have been the cry, and [...] "Shylock" [...] would have been forgotten. I do not say that there is not a vast difference between the means of acquiring intelligence, the cultivation, the manners, the social conditions, and, in some senses, the social obligations of an affluent landlord and a really hard-working, honest, well-intentioned husbandman, his tenant--differences that should dispose the liberal and cultivated gentleman to bear in mind the advantages he has perhaps inherited, and not acquired by his own means, in such a way as to render him, in a certain degree, the repository of the interests of those who hold under him; but, while I admit all this, and say that the community which does not possess such a class of men is to be pitied, as it loses one of the most certain means of liberalizing and enlarging its notions, and of improving its civilization, I am far from thinking that the men of this class are to have their real superiority of position, with its consequences, thrown into their faces only when they are expected to give, while they are grudgingly denied it on all other occasions! There is nothing so likely to advance the habits, opinions, and true interests of a rural population, as to have them all directed by the intelligence and combined interests that ought to mark the connection between landlord and tenant. It may do for one class of political economists to prate about a state of things which supposes every husbandman a freeholder, and rich enough to maintain his level among the other freeholders of the State. But we all know that as many minute gradations in means must and do exist in a community, as there exists gradations in characters. A majority soon will, in the nature of things, be below the level of the freeholder, and by destroying the system of having landlords and tenants, two great evils are created--the one preventing men of large fortunes from investing in lands, as no man will place his money where it will be insecure or profitless, thereby cutting off real estate generally from the benefits that might be and would be conferred by their capital, as well as cutting it off from the benefits of the increased price which arise from having such buyers in the market; and the other is, to prevent any man from being a husbandman who has not the money necessary to purchase a farm. But they who want farms now, and they who will want votes next November, do not look quite so far ahead as that, while shouting [...] "equal rights," [...] they are, in fact, for preventing the poor husbandman from being anything but a day-labourer.|$|E
