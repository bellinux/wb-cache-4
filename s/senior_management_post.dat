40|$|While {{there has}} always been a {{profound}} indifference to the affective domain in formal education, given its Cartesian allegiance to the development of the rational autonomous subject, this indifference to the emotional subject is intensifying with the glorification of performativity. As higher education is especially subject to performance measurement and rankings, this study of top-level management in Irish higher education shows that those who hold <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> <b>posts</b> are subjected increasingly to disciplinary rationalities that largely preclude being a primary carer. The definition of senior managerial posts as care-less positions, in terms of primary care responsibilities, advantages those who are care-free and these are disproportionately men in societies where the moral imperative to do primary care work applies mainly to women. The data suggest that understanding how the care ceiling operates is crucial for understanding why women do not occupy senior managerial positions within new managerial regimes in higher education...|$|R

The study highlights cultural issues of visibility and the presenteeism ethos of the sector.

40|$|In 1998 the Department of Labour promulgated the Employment Equity Act, which {{aimed at}} {{ensuring}} that the designated groups were represented in the workplace at all levels. The designated groups that were to be given preference for appointments were women, disabled and Black people. The Department of Public Service and Administration issued a directive to all government Departments to ensure the achievement of 50 / 50 gender representation at <b>Senior</b> <b>Management</b> levels by 31 March 2009. However, the Provincial Treasury in the Eastern Cape did not achieve this target and is still lagging behind. There are barriers in the workplace, which pose challenges to the progression of women to management levels. These barriers are {{commonly referred to as}} ‘glass ceiling’ by some scholars. This study used a qualitative approach in gathering data. The study employed non- probability, which adopted the purposive sampling approach. Questionnaires were administered to middle <b>management</b> and <b>Senior</b> Managers were interviewed to gather empirical data. Questionnaires were administered to sixty Middle Managers, both males and female, and interviews were conducted with seven senior managers. The reason for targeting Middle Managers was that they are at a level that is next in line in the hierarchy to advance to <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> positions. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate factors inhibiting the advancement of women to <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> positions in the Provincial Treasury in the Province of the Eastern Cape. The problem identified was that there were numbers of females at middle management who had the required qualifications and experience, but were not considered when appointments were made to fill in vacant <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> <b>posts.</b> The other problem that was identified was that often <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> positions were filled by candidates who were not from within the Department. The performance of female internal candidates is not recognised, which may be indicative of the flaws with the performance management system. It emerged from the empirical survey that preference is given to men compared to their female counterparts. The study revealed that there were factors that contributed to non-advancement of females to <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> such as the existence of stereotypes and perceptions. The stereotypical beliefs view men as hard workers than their female counterparts. It was also revealed that women suffered from low self-esteem that impacted negatively on their confidence levels. This subsequently discouraged women to apply for advertised vacancies as they doubted their own capabilities. It also emerged that the Department did not empower newly appointed persons through the mentoring and coaching programmes. This study also revealed that no training was offered to newly appointed persons...|$|R

The pre-dawn broadcasts soundtrack which mentioned [...] "punching and kicking" [...] was re-recorded, and later bulletins {{said that the}} officers were [...] "suspected of using excessive force". TVB director Keith Yuen questioned what grounds lead the footage to say [...] "officers dragged him to a dark corner, and punched and kicked him"? Ho Wing-hong, the assistant supervisor of the news-gathering team responsible for the footage, was immediately demoted to Chief Researcher, a post with only a part-time subordinate. Many journalists expressed their dissatisfaction with {{the handling of the}} broadcast, and some 80 TVB staff from all departments objecting to the handling sent a petition to management. After several of its reporters were assaulted by activists attending a pro-Beijing rally, over 340 station employees put their names to a petition condemning the violence. A director of production in the non-drama department ordered all petitioners to a meeting with their supervisors, where the employees were asked to remove their signature or jeopardise their year end bonuses.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{enduring}} issues {{in the area of}} women and management is the concept of the glass ceiling. This thesis explores whether there is still a persistence of attitudes that place women in an antithetical position to executive power, by examining how men and women construct their professional identities or representations of themselves as managers through their discourse. The research considers whether women use language differently in carrying out their management tasks, i. e., in ways that reflect their feminine social identities. Further, the study focusses on determining whether some women disqualify themselves from <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> <b>posts</b> by {{the way in which they}} construct their identities. The assumption underpinning the thesis is that the discourse used by managers to create their professional identities presents clues to the values, attitudes and beliefs of managers within the organisation, a further education college. Analysis of the data revealed evidence for three main gendered discourses at play in the further education college under discussion: (1) some women downplay their authority; (2) they prefer a collaborative, team-based approach to management; and (3) they make reference to differentiating their management behaviours to demonstrate care and concern for individual circumstances. There is evidence that some women bring valuable skills to the workplace, particularly in the areas of a potential people-focussed, supportive style that nurtures and develops staff, as well as their emotional literacy and sensitivity to the face needs of others. However, the deferential demeanour and use of mitigating language can make some women appear to be hesitant, unsure and sometimes unclear as managers; the performative identity constructed through this type of discourse is potentially one of uncertainty, and this demeanour could conceivably disadvantage some women in terms of advancement or promotion. While the findings may not be fully transferable to other contexts, the study makes an empirical contribution to knowledge in offering the conclusions as relevant material to inform the conceptualisation of management development programmes and to develop existing managers in the further education sector...|$|R

40|$|Bibliography: pages 296 - 303. This {{dissertation}} {{involves a}} case study in the application of job evaluation in the City Council of Cape Town. The purpose was to gain insight into the dynamics of the process in a local government environment {{from the point of view}} of principal actors - political office bearers, senior officials, trade unions, compensation specialists and employees at large. The methodology was that of "participant-as-observer" and "complete participant". Complementing this was extensive use of primary documentation. A survey using a structured questionnaire was administered to other major local authorities to identify job evaluation usage. The introductory chapter provides an overview of the concept of job evaluation, its principles and practice and the different methods employed. The historical and contemporary usage of job evaluation both abroad and in South Africa is covered in the following chapter. The most prevalent systems are described including the Five Factor System applied in the City Council. Methodological issues are aired in the following chapter whilst Chapter 4 provides context to the study through an analysis of the structure and function of the constituent organisational parts and a review of policies and practices relevant to the personnel/remuneration process. In Chapter 5 the background to formal job evaluation in the organisation is traced by focusing on the salary and wage negotiating process 'leading in' to the decision to introduce formal job evaluation. A review of an earlier evaluation of <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> <b>posts</b> using the Hay method is also presented. Chapter 6 provides an overview of the principles and practice of Council's job evaluation programme, primarily from the perspective of the compensation specialists. It describes the rationale for the choice of procedures and provides further insight into the method adopted. Each phase is considered in the light of accepted practice. Chapters 7, 8 and 9 are focal points in the study and deal with <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> response, union perspectives and employee reaction to the plan. The analysis oscillates between micro and macro issues, examining the interplay of system content, procedures and differing value orientations. Perspectives of <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> are critically examined and assessed where possible against objective evidence. Discussion of the issues brought forward by management is pursued in order to place these within a framework of principle and practice. The contrasting roles of the two trade unions provide the central focus in Chapter 8. One adopted a participative approach aimed at monetary benefit; the other showed a preference for negotiation based on results of the job evaluation, emphasising factors not included in the formal system. Chapter 9 examines employee grievances as an indicator of employee acceptance applying equity theory. Grievance factors are analysed and mini case studies of responses to perceived inequity are illustrated. In the concluding chapter some specific recommendations for improvement to the system and its application are made as well as conclusions applicable to job evaluation in general. The overall conclusion reached is that deficiencies in systemic, procedural and value dimensions led to partial attainment of objectives - this attributable to an absence of commitment. The absence of organisational consensus created tension in the equilibrium of the organisation. With the new structure installed, secondary benefits of a more conscious corporate approach are being manifested through system maintenance...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigated how <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> {{is motivated}} {{to commit to}} information system security (ISS). Research shows <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> participation is critical to successful ISS, but has not explained how senior managers are motivated to participate in ISS. Information systems research shows pressures external to the organization have greater influence on senior managers than internal pressures. However, research has not fully examined how external pressures motivate <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> participation in ISS. This study addressed that gap by examining how external pressures motivate <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> participation in ISS {{through the lens of}} neo-institutional theory. The research design was survey research. Data collection was through an online survey, and PLS was used for data analysis. Sample size was 167 from a study population of small- and medium-sized organizations in a mix of industries in the south-central United States. Results supported three of six hypotheses. Mimetic mechanisms were found to influence <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> belief in ISS, and <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> belief in ISS was found to increase <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> participation in ISS. Greater <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> participation in ISS led to greater ISS assimilation in organizations. Three hypotheses were not supported. Correlation was not found between normative influences and <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> belief, normative influences and <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> participation, and coercive influences and <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> participation. Limitations with the study included a high occurrence of weak effect sizes on relationships within the model and heterogeneity based on industry, organization size, and regulatory requirements in the sample. This study contributes to ISS research by providing a theoretical model to explain how external influences contribute to <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> belief and participation in ISS, and ultimately ISS assimilation in organizations. Empirical evidence supports the mediating role by <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> between external influences and ISS assimilation. The findings also suggest some limitations that may exist with survey research in this area. This study benefits practitioners in three ways. First, it reinforces the argument that <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> support is critical to ISS success. Second, it extends understanding of <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> 2 ̆ 7 s role with ISS by explaining how IS and ISS <b>management</b> might nurture <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> belief and participation in ISS through industry groups and business partnerships. Third, the results inform government regulators and industry groups how they can supplement regulatory pressures with educational and awareness campaigns targeted at <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> to improve <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> commitment to ISS...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Tourism and Hospitality Management) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 2004 The {{problem of}} {{managing}} {{discipline in the}} hotel industry ranges from senior managers failing to manage discipline correctly, to junior/middle managers having insufficient practical experience and confidence to discipline effectively and justify the decisions they have made. Senior managers therefore lack confidence in junior/middle management's ability to manage discipline. The objective {{of this study is}} to provide <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> with simple, workable solutions to manage discipline correctly. This will enable <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> to delegate the management of discipline to junior/middle management correctly; to improve the confidence of junior/middle management in the management of practical discipline; to improve the confidence level of <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> in the ability of junior/middle management to manage discipline; and to. improve the ability of junior/middle management to correctly and confidently justify disciplinary decisions they have made. The study recommends that: <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> should take the lead and initiative to allocate time with junior/middle management to plan how to manage discipline effectively; the success of <b>senior</b> <b>management's</b> performance should be measured by how well junior/middle management achieve the performance competence to formally and practically manage discipline; <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> should provide structured feedback, coaching and counselling to junior/middle management on their performance; and <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> should coach junior/middle management on how to justify disciplinary decisions. The cost of this change, namely, coaching and influencing people, is not monetary, but one of commitment. It is the choice <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> should make.
