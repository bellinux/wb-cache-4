Control of the heading of the vehicle is critical to its safety and stability. Modelling the parameters and process is critical to developing a control strategy for it. There are multiple factors that are responsible for the heading of the vehicle which can lead to a complicated process model. However, the model has been simplified by suitable approximations. The objective of this research is to control the heading of a vehicle in the real world environment under the unpredictable and unstructured surroundings. The change of heading direction and the speed of the vehicle influence to the motion of a vehicle. The vehicle model that was assumed was a four wheeled electric motor driven car, whose steering system is modified to be controlled by a DC servo motor mounted at the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>shaft,</b> and is fitted with a compass sensor to measure the current heading direction of the vehicle. Various control strategies were simulated in Simulink to converge at the most appropriate one. The chief objective was to achieve minimum settling time and also reduce overshoot and steady state error. Strategies such as double loop controller, Internal Model Controller (IMC), Modified IMC and robust controller are used for the same process and the performance of each is presented...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Automatic {{guidance}} of tractors in the mechanized farming practice {{has taken the}} attention of agricultural engineers {{in the last two}} decades. For this to be truly practical on the farm, it should be economical, simple to operate and entirely contained on the vehicle. Different types of steering systems such as leader- cable, laser- controlled, radio- operated and contactor- type have been developed for automatic guidance. The automatic leveling system is used on hillside machines to keep the separator level when operating on hillsides. This system has three parts: fluid level system, electrical system and hydraulic system. The fluid level system consists of fluid reservoir and a leveling control switch box. The fluid level system actuates the electrical system of the leveling unit. The electrical system which actuated by the fluid system consist of four micro switches in the leveling control switch box, two micro switches in the limit control box, a solenoid in the hydraulic control level, manual leveling control switch, and a leveling limit warning light. The hydraulic system maintains the level of the separator when the machine is operating on a hillside. The present study was aimed to develop a reliable, versatile and easy to maintain system to fit our economy and low technology level of farmers for hillside- range development or fallow farming. The automatic guidance system has been implemented successfully on agricultural vehicles on the basis of three components, i. e. sensors, processors and actuator elements. The study site (N, latitude; E, longitude; and 1810 m above sea level) was located at the Agricultural Research Center, Shiraz University, 15 km northwest of Shiraz, Fars Province, Iran. MF- 399 agricultural tractor manufactured by ITMCO, Tabriz, Iran was used for doing the experiments. Materials and Methods:The Level Sensing System: The biaxial tilt industrial sensor (ZCT 245 AL- China) with digital output can be connected to the computer and received angular position in x and y coordinates. An assumed degree could be considered as basis degree and the measured frequency was adjustable. The tilt sensor located along the axial length of tractor and leads the angles which are created by longitudinal axle transverse axle of the tractor in related to horizontal level. It was used for contour lines detecting. The potentiometer located on the steering wheel of the tractor and pressure sensor which used with goniometer sensor used keeping uniformly of leveling points in tractor motion. The pressure sensor (SN-SCP 1000 - South Korea) which is used in leveling system can detect the elevation changes. In this way, by defining a limitation of altitude for system, it would be able to stop steering turning motor which was coupled to tractor steering rod automatically. By resetting, the tractor could be able to live in a new level position. To avoid excessive left and right steering wheels deviation and interfering with other lines of travel, potentiometer was used. The deviation degree for steering rod from center to left or right was selected 120 degrees. Accordingly, the wheels {{would not be able to}} move more than 10 degrees to each direction. The Processing System: The electrical circuit graphically designed and simulated by software (Altium Designer, 2009) and installed on the tractor. The components of this circuit are as follows: Electrical board, two relays which control the electrical pathway in both directions, a battery with 12 volts of electric potential as electrical power supply, ATmeGA 32 microcontroller which was made by Atmel company as main core for information processing, RS 232 protocol was used for making correlation between serial port (COM) and the microcontroller and two capacitors for reducing noises. The Actuator System: The output signals from the a processing system, were lead in the actuator system would order and indicative of left- turn or right- turn command, were introduced to actuator- units include an electric- gearbox motor that stimulate the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>shaft</b> of the tractor by chain and sprocket and conduct the tractor in leveling traces at the desired speed. Before hitching any implements such as row planter behind the tractor, the system was successfully tested on average slopes of 14. 5...|$|E
40|$|The human {{perception}} of rotational hand-arm vibration {{has been investigated}} {{by means of a}} test rig consisting of a rigid frame, an electrodynamic shaker unit, a rigid <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> a <b>shaft</b> assembly, bearings and an automobile seat. Fifteen subjects were tested while seated in a driving posture. Four equal sensation tests and one annoyance threshold test were performed using sinusoidal excitation at 18 frequencies in the range from 3 to 315 Hz. In order to guarantee the generality of the equal sensation data the four tests were defined to permit checks of the possible influence of three factors: reference signal amplitude, psychophysical test procedure and temporary threshold shift (TTSv) caused by the test exposure. All equal sens ation tests used a reference sinusoid of 63 Hz at either 1. 0 or 1. 5 m/s 2 r. m. s. in amplitude. The four equal sensation curves were similar in shape and suggested a decrease in human sensitivity to hand-arm rotational vibration with increasing frequency. The slopes of the equal sensation curves changed at transition points of approximately 6. 3 and 63 Hz. A frequency weighting, called Ws, was developed for the purpose of evaluating <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> rotational vibration. The proposed Ws has a slope of 0 dB per octave over the frequency range from 3 to 6. 3 Hz, a slope of - 6 dB per octave from 6. 3 to 50 Hz, a slope of 0 dB per octave from 50 to 160 Hz and a slope of - 10 dB per octave from 160 to 315 Hz. Ws provides a possible alternative to the existing Wh frequency weighting defined in International Standards Organisation 5349 - 1 (2001) and British Standards Institution 6842 (1987) ...|$|R
