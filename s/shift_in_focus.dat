5|$|A {{suitable}} environment {{had developed}} to question scientific doctrine. The discovery in 1492 of the New World by Christopher Columbus challenged the classical worldview. The works of Ptolemy (in geography) and Galen (in medicine) {{were found to}} not always match everyday observations. As the Protestant Reformation and Counter-Reformation clashed, the Northern Renaissance showed a decisive <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> <b>focus</b> from Aristotelean natural philosophy to chemistry and the biological sciences (botany, anatomy, and medicine).

5|$|Subsequent {{reviews of}} defence {{policy and the}} {{strategic}} situation in South East Asia after the war had resulted {{in the formation of}} the Australian Regiment in 1948, the first regular infantry unit of the Australian Army. From that time on as tension within the region increased the strength of the Regular Army increased rapidly in contrast to the CMF, signifying if not an end to Australian military planners' reliance upon citizen soldiers, at least a <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> <b>focus</b> and a realisation of the mistakes that had been made prior to World War II. This would see the CMF providing a platform upon which the Army could mobilise in the event of a war. Initially, the plan had been for the CMF to be made up of 50,000 men organised into two divisions and other units, however, recruitment was unable to meet these targets as initially it was attempted to achieve this through voluntary enlistment. Indeed, in its first year of existence, the actual strength of the CMF was only 8,698 personnel, although this rose the following year to 16,202 and to 32,779 in 1950. In March 1951, a system of compulsory national service was re-established.|$|E
5|$|The Engineering Experiment Station {{was renamed}} the Georgia Tech Research Institute in 1984. A {{separate}} organization, originally called the Industrial Development Council, {{changed its name}} to the Georgia Tech Research Institute in February 1946, and finally to the Georgia Tech Research Corporation in 1984. There are legal difficulties when an American university wishes to accept contracts from some entities, especially the federal government, so the second organization is a contracting organization. Most importantly, it allows the university to perform multi-year contracts that are not possible under state law, which requires that money received must be spent in the same fiscal year. The name change coincided with a <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> <b>focus</b> toward obtaining industrial research contracts in addition to its contracts with the federal government. GTRI expanded its footprint in the mid to late 1980s: the Centennial Research Building opened on {{the north end of the}} Georgia Tech campus in 1985, providing expanded lab and office space, and the electromagnetic radiation measurement range was established at GTRI's Cobb County research facility.|$|E

40|$|Film {{has become}} an ever more {{effective}} medium of instruction in foreign languages, including Chinese. Developing good textbooks to accompany the films is too labor-intensive {{to keep pace with}} the growing production of contemporary films, so it is useful to develop strategies for using older films and existing textbooks. This paper examines how slight <b>shifts</b> <b>in</b> <b>focus</b> can overcome the issue of contemporaneity and bring out the qualities of an older film and accompanying textbook. The 1984 film Under the Bridge serves as example, and conscious attention to the “Five C’s of Foreign Language Education: Communication, Cultures, Connections, Comparisons, and Communities” drawn up by the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages serves as method. The paper shows how <b>shifts</b> <b>in</b> <b>focus,</b> rather than diffusing the focus on language, actually can strengthen the language learning experience. It reviews some more recent film guide textbooks to demonstrate why it is still worthwhile to bring this older film and textbook into the twenty-first century...|$|R

25|$|Similar scenes {{appear in}} many post-New Kingdom temples, {{but this time}} the events they depict involve the gods alone.

Each of these child gods is the heir to the throne, who will restore stability to the country. This <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> <b>focus</b> from the human king to the gods who are associated with him reflects a decline in the status of the pharaoh in the late stages of Egyptian history.|$|E
25|$|From the 1990s, plantings of red grape {{varieties}} rose steadily. In {{the late}} 1990s, less than 18% {{of all the}} grapes grown in South Africa were red. By 2009 that number had risen to 44%. For most of the 20th century, the high yielding Cinsaut was the most widely planted red grape variety, but the <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> <b>focus</b> to quality wine production has seen plantings of the grape steadily decline to where it represented just 2% of all South Africa vineyards in 2009. In its place, Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz and Pinotage have risen to prominence with Cabernet Sauvignon being the most widely grown red grape variety covering 12% of all plantings in 2009. Other red grape varieties found in South Africa include: Carignan, Gamay (often made {{in the style of}} Beaujolais wine with carbonic maceration), Grenache, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc, Pontac, Ruby Cabernet, Tinta Barroca and Zinfandel.|$|E
25|$|During the 1970s the Forestry Commission {{had begun}} a <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> <b>focus</b> to {{conservation}} and amenity {{value of their}} woods. The 1975 symposium considered the history and ecology of Bedford Purlieus and discussed how to retain and enhance {{the elements of the}} woods of greatest ecological value. The resulting publication, edited by G.F. Peterken and R.C. Welch, produced a detailed management plan. Among its recommendations were the restoration of areas of coppicing, and the reduction of conifers. The plan provided a basis for an ecological management of Bedford Purlieus within commercial constraints. Its designation as a national nature reserve in 2000 is a recognition {{of the extent to which}} the policy shift had been made. In 2005 it received an injection of funding from landfill tax credits arising from the nearby Augean landfill. This has facilitated the Forestry Commission to re-instate areas of coppicing, open up grassland glades and remove conifers and other introduced species.|$|E

25|$|The {{renewal of}} {{learning}} in Europe, that began with 12th century Scholasticism, {{came to an end}} about the time of the Black Death, and the initial period of the subsequent Italian Renaissance is sometimes seen as a lull in scientific activity. The Northern Renaissance, on the other hand, showed a decisive <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> <b>focus</b> from Aristoteleian natural philosophy to chemistry and the biological sciences (botany, anatomy, and medicine). Thus modern science in Europe was resumed in a period of great upheaval: the Protestant Reformation and Catholic Counter-Reformation; the discovery of the Americas by Christopher Columbus; the Fall of Constantinople; but also the re-discovery of Aristotle during the Scholastic period presaged large social and political changes. Thus, a suitable environment was created in which it became possible to question scientific doctrine, {{in much the same way}} that Martin Luther and John Calvin questioned religious doctrine. The works of Ptolemy (astronomy) and Galen (medicine) were found not always to match everyday observations. Work by Vesalius on human cadavers found problems with the Galenic view of anatomy.|$|E
25|$|The Tunisians populace {{appreciated}} {{the introduction of}} such improvements, but noticed the advantages the Protectorate bestowed on the European newcomers. Community leaders began {{to appeal to the}} self-proclaimed public virtues of the French state, e.g., droit humane, in order to obtain equal treatment with the French colons. Yet at first such appeals resulted more often than not in disappointment, increasingly so, enough that many Tunisians turned cynical regarding the Protectorate's claims. Mass movements arose. Yet not all French officials were non-responsive. From the start, the fundamental nature of the colonial enterprise had been disputed. Various causes and/or justifications were proposed during the period of the Protectorate as its self-explanation: for revenue and natural resources, for export markets, for cultural expansion and national prestige, for career opportunities and jobs for the arriving colons, or as a frontier for the military. French policy, in attempting to satisfy such a variety of rationals, could <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> <b>focus</b> from one to another, often depending on which French administrator made the choices and the immediate circumstances. As a natural result French policy was not always consistent over time. During the latter decades of the Protectorate, local French officials increasing also sought to better address the needs, complaints, and demands of the Tunisian people. On many issues, the Protectorate could be confronted with its own contradictory objectives, and underlying political conflicts, leading to difficult decisions or negotiations.|$|E
