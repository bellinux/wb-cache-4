25|$|Businesses {{dependent}} on tourism, {{with the exception}} of a few hotels, tend to be <b>small</b> <b>enterprises</b> typically employing fewer than four people; many of these are family run, suggesting an entrepreneurial culture among the local population.

In the age of 1960 s, 70 s, I do them the situations to be independent of big ones, and <b>smaller</b> <b>enterprises</b> got the potential or actual abilities to innovate technology although not all. But by coming globalization after {{in the latter half}} of 1980 s, many subcontract <b>smaller</b> <b>enterprises</b> were reorganized by big corporations. Many <b>smaller</b> <b>enterprises</b> have been bankrupted and given up under reorganizing them since latter half of 1980 s. Only <b>smaller</b> <b>enterprises</b> based on the excellent technologies have survived and grown as the result of reorganization of smaller ones. Nowadays, venture business are the focus of Japanese researchers' attentions as same as world them.

25|$|The nation also {{benefited from}} economies of scale. Although {{medium-sized}} and <b>small</b> <b>enterprises</b> generated {{much of the}} nation's employment, large facilities were the most productive. Many industrial enterprises consolidated to form larger, more efficient units. Before World War II, large holding companies formed wealth groups, or zaibatsu, which dominated most industry. The zaibatsu were dissolved after the war, but keiretsu—large, modern industrial enterprise groupings—emerged. The coordination of activities within these groupings and the integration of smaller subcontractors into the groups enhanced industrial efficiency.|$|E
25|$|In recent times, {{there has}} been a move away from a {{traditional}} agriculture-based economy in the province of Naples to one based on service industries. In early 2002, there were over 249,590 enterprises operating in the province registered in the Chamber of Commerce Public Register. The service sector employs the majority of Neapolitans, although more than half of these are <b>small</b> <b>enterprises</b> with fewer than 20 workers; 70 companies are said to be medium-sized with more than 200 workers; and 15 have more than 500 workers.|$|E

Almost all them, which mostly consist of glass, wrought iron, ceramic and wooden items, are exported to the United States (91%). However, craft items are under pressure from imitations from Central America and Asia. The crafts sector of industry is not considered a particularly active segment of the state's population with no data as to the percentage of the state's GDP it represents. Most crafts over time have become specialties of more or more municipalities.|$|E

25|$|One {{example of}} this would be the Yingzao Fashi printed in 1103, an {{architectural}} building manual written by an official put in charge of government agencies for construction. Artisans and craftsmen were either government-employed or worked privately. A successful and highly skilled artisan could often gain enough capital in order to hire others as apprentices or additional laborers that could be overseen by the chief artisan as a manager. Hence, artisans could create their own <b>small</b> <b>enterprises</b> in selling their work and that of others, and like the merchants, they formed their own guilds.|$|E
25|$|Most of this Huì {{appeared}} for {{the first}} time in rural zones near metropolitan areas, where families shared work (in the parcels they owned and in the industrial workshops at the same time). For instance, in 1989 in Changhua, <b>small</b> <b>enterprises</b> produced almost 50% of the world's umbrellas. The State attracted foreign companies in order to obtain more capital and to get access to foreign markets, but the big foreign companies got contracts with this huge net of small sized, familiar and national companies, which were a very important percentage of the industrial output.|$|E

He further called for political solutions that would broaden access to production forces such as information technology, and for states to focus on equipping and monitoring civil society rather than trying to provide social services.|$|E

25|$|A 2005 {{report found}} serious {{shortcomings}} to China’s national innovation system. There were problems with services to help turn S work into {{results and the}} allocation of national funding to support S was far from optimal. Sometimes researchers became short-sighted if they {{get too close to}} the market. Another serious problem was that companies facing severe competition looked first to purchase foreign technology rather than investing in developing technology and technology development capacity at home in China. Many of the patent applications came from medium-sized enterprises (70%) since <b>small</b> <b>enterprises</b> invest little in research. China's hierarchical, top-down society where authority is greatly respected and feared has been argued to stifle creative debate.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} {{a large number of}} <b>small</b> <b>enterprises</b> in the {{technological}} sector with regional to nationwide success, particularly in the fields of computing and biotechonology. Because of both governmental and private funding in the diversification of its economy, the city has become an international reference in Information Technology and Biotechnology, and is also cited because of the advanced corporate and university research in Biodiesel fuel. The number of jobs in the Information sector has been growing at annual rates above 50%. The Belo Horizonte Metropolitan Area, composed of 33 cities under the capital's direct influence, is home to 16% of the country's biotechnology companies, with annual sales of over R$550 million.|$|E
25|$|A tax {{called the}} undistributed profits tax was enacted in 1936. This time {{the primary purpose}} was revenue, since Congress had enacted the Adjusted Compensation Payment Act, calling for {{payments}} of $2billion to World War I veterans. The bill established the persisting principle that retained corporate earnings could be taxed. Paid dividends were tax deductible by corporations. Its proponents intended the bill to replace all other corporation taxes—believing this would stimulate corporations to distribute earnings and thus put more cash and spending {{power in the hands}} of individuals. In the end, Congress watered down the bill, setting the tax rates at 7 to 27% and largely exempting <b>small</b> <b>enterprises.</b> Facing widespread and fierce criticism, the tax deduction of paid dividends was repealed in 1938.|$|E

His final concern is with the actual results of the neo-liberal policy interventions in CEE in practice. The paper focuses particularly on the programmes supported by the international assistance community, since they were largely responsible for both the financing and the design of the bulk of the interventions which emerged after 1989. <b>small</b> <b>enterprise,</b> business support centres, entrepreneurs, CEE...|$|R
25|$|Corruption {{often leads}} to many civil {{services}} being treated by governments as employment agencies to loyal supporters and so it could mean going through 20 procedures, paying $2,696 in fees and waiting 82 business days to start a business, in Bolivia, while, in Canada, it takes two days, two registration procedures, and $280 to do the same. Such costly barriers favor big firms {{at the expense of}} <b>small</b> <b>enterprises,</b> where most jobs are created. Often, businesses have to bribe government officials even for routine activities, which is, in effect, a tax on business. Noted reductions in poverty in recent decades has occurred in China and India mostly {{as a result of the}} abandonment of collective farming in China and the ending of the central planning model known as the License Raj in India.|$|E

Lastly, organizational support to intensify the powers and increase capitalization of the Small Business and Guarantee Finance Corporation to complement the growing demands for financing.
