The spread of frequencies issues in <b>SW</b> <b>band,</b> and the basic principles and characteristics of digital radio broadcasting on DRM platform in <b>SW</b> <b>band,</b> is described here.

40|$|Abstract: Absorption, {{steady state}} and time {{resolved}} fluorescence spectra of 4, 4 ′-sulfonyldiphenol (SDP), 3, 3 ’–dimethyl 4, 4 ′-sulfonyldiphenol (DMSP), 4, 4 ′-sulfonyldibenzoic acid (SDBA) were {{studied in the}} presence of α- and β-cyclodextrins. Both in water and CD, SDP and SDBA exhibit two emission maxima while DMSP exhibit three emission maxima. In β-CD, the rate of enhancement of longer wavelength (LW) emission is higher than that of shorter wavelength (<b>SW)</b> <b>band,</b> where as in α-CD the enhancement of SW is larger than that of LW. The normal Stokes shifted band was originated from the locally excited state and the large Stokes shifted band was due to the emission form a TICT state. In these molecules, the presence of OH or COOH groups at para position of the aromatic rings increase the coplanar geometry in the excited state. Semi-empirical quantum-mechanical calculations were also carried out to assign the encapsulation of the SDP, DMSP and SDBA. PM 3 calculations show that most of the SDBA values are different from SDP and DMSP because the values are dependent {{on the size of the}} CD cavities and nature of the functional group of the guest...|$|E

40|$|Contract was {{to pursue}} {{feasibility}} {{studies of the}} SOFIA Widefield Imaging Fabry-Perot (SWIFT). SWIFT was proposed as a two color 18 to 40 microns imaging Fabry-Perot that utilized two Rockwell/Boeing 256 x 256 pixel Si:Sb BIBs as detective devices. The colors were to be split between 26 and 30 microns using a MgO dichroic. The resolution achieving devices were to be a pair of cryogenic fully tunable scanning Fabry-Perot interferometers (FPIs), two in each band. For high resolving powers, a third, fixed FPI is inserted into the beam. The FPI mirrors were {{to be made of}} free standing metal mesh. We also proposed to look into a long wavelength (40 to 210 microns) band during the feasibility study period. We produced a proposal to USRA, submitted in July 1997 that substantially refined our ideas. We decided the long wavelength science was compelling, so the baseline wavelength coverage for SWIFT was widened to 17 to 205 microns. Under typical operations, we proposed to simultaneously image in two bands: 22 to 38 microns, and 50 to 205 microns. The bands were to be split by a cold CaF 2 dichroic. The short wavelength (<b>SW)</b> <b>band</b> was to employ a 256 x 256 pixel Boeing/Rockwell Si:Sb BIB array, and the long wavelength (LW) band was to employ a Goddard 6 x 32 (upgradable to 32 x 32) element array of monolithic silicon "pop-up" bolometers as detective devices. The two color capability doubled the data taking efficiency, and ensured "perfect" registration between the images obtained in each band. For the <b>SW</b> <b>band,</b> the beam was to be fully sampled (0. 7 " pixels, 1. 4 in. beam) at 17 microns, and over sampled at longer wavelengths. Even so, SWIFT has a very large (3 ft x 3 ft) field of view. To match the SW and LW fields of view (initially in one dimension only, but in 2 -dimensions with 32 x 32 upgrade), SWIFT was to under sample at 63 microns (5. 6 in pixels, 5. 2 in beam) resulting in a 0. 56 x 3 in (upgrade to 3 in x 3 in) field of view. Each band has both Lo-Res (R triple bond lambda/Delta(lambda) approx. 30 to 200) and Hi-Res (R approx. 1000 up to 10 (exp 5)) modes, that can be changed in less than a minute. Spectral resolution is obtained with four identical cryogenic, fully tunable, scanning FPIS, two in each band, plus a set of fixed order FPI that can be rotated into the beam for good spectral purity at the highest resolving powers. SWIFT was proposed to explore three primary topics of scientific interest: 1. Protostars, Young Stellar Objects, and Protoplanetary Disks. 2. The Galactic Center. 3. External Galaxies...|$|E
40|$|ICON Far UltraViolet (FUV) imager {{contributes}} to the ICON science objectives by providing remote sensing measurements of the daytime and nighttime atmosphere/ ionosphere. During sunlit atmospheric conditions, ICON FUV images the limb altitude profile in the shortwave (<b>SW)</b> <b>band</b> at 135. 6 nm and the longwave (LW) band at 157 nm perpendicular to the satellite motion to retrieve the atmospheric O/N 2 ratio. In conditions of atmospheric darkness, ICON FUV measures the 135. 6 nm recombination emission of O+ ions used to compute the nighttime ionospheric altitude distribution. ICON Far Ultra- Violet (FUV) imager is a Czerny–Turner design Spectrographic Imager with two exit slits and corresponding back imager cameras that produce two independent images in separate wavelength bands on two detectors. All observations will be processed as limb altitude profiles. In addition, the ionospheric 135. 6 nm data will be processed as longitude and latitude spatial maps to obtain images of ion distributions around regions of equatorial spread F. The ICON FUV optic axis is pointed 20 degrees below local horizontal and has a steering mirror that allows {{the field of view}} to be steered up to 30 degrees forward and aft, to keep the local magnetic meridian in the field of view. The detectors are micro channel plate (MCP) intensified FUV tubes with the phosphor fiber-optically coupled to Charge Coupled Devices (CCDs). The dual stack MCP-s amplify the photoelectron signals to overcome the CCD noise and the rapidly scanned frames are co-added to digitally create 12 -second integrated images. Digital on-board signal processing is used to compensate for geometric distortion and satellite motion and to achieve data compression. The instrument was originally aligned in visible light by using a special grating and visible cameras. Final alignment, functional and environmental testing and calibration were performed in a large vacuum chamber with a UV source. The test and calibration program showed that ICON FUV meets its design requirements and is ready to be launched on the ICON spacecraft. Peer reviewe...|$|E
