40|$|AbstractThis article {{analyses}} {{the political}} context of Defence White Papers from 1976 to 2013. Political {{competition between the}} major Australian political parties is an inevitable and indeed essential backdrop to policy development. Only by understanding the dynamics of that competition {{is it possible to}} understand how governments make key defence policy decisions around <b>strategy,</b> <b>force</b> structure and defence spending. Competition for authority within parties also informs how Prime Ministers use White Papers as a means to cement their own power. A key challenge for governments is the need to look credible as custodians of Australian national security in the perceptions of voters. If one party is unable to demonstrate clear superiority over the other in its management of defence, a secondary aim is to try to remove defence as a point of political difference by claiming bipartisanship on key aspects of policy...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Muscle co-contraction is a {{strategy}} of increasing movement accuracy and stability employed in dealing with perturbation of movement. It is often seen in neuropathological populations. The direction of movement influences the pattern of co-contraction, but not all movements are easily achievable for populations with motor deficits. Manipulating {{the direction of the}} force instead, may be a promising rehabilitation protocol to train movement with use of a co-contraction reduction <b>strategy.</b> <b>Force</b> field learning paradigms provide a well described procedure to evoke and test muscle co-contraction. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of this study was to}} test the muscle co-contraction pattern in a wide range of arm muscles in different force-field directions utilising a robot-assisted force field learning paradigm of motor adaptation. METHOD: 42 participants volunteered to participate in a study utilising robot-assisted motor adaptation paradigm with clockwise or counter-clockwise force field. Kinematics and surface electromyography (EMG) of eight arm muscles has been measured. RESULTS: Both muscle activation and co-contraction was earlier and stronger in flexors in clockwise condition and in extensors in the counter-clockwise condition. CONCLUSIONS: Manipulating the force field direction leads to changes in the pattern of muscle co-contraction...|$|E
40|$|Two studies {{explored}} stereotypic {{information processing}} in rape cases by prospective lawyers in Germany. In Study 1, 451 undergraduate law students rated rape scenarios varying {{with respect to}} defendant-complainant relationship and coercive <b>strategy</b> (<b>force</b> versus exploitation of the complainant's alcohol-induced defencelessness). Acceptance of rape myths was also measured. Likelihood of defendant liability was rated to be lower {{when there was a}} prior relationship between the parties and when the defendant exploited the complainant's defencelessness as compared to when he used force (except in the ex-partner rapes where blame was higher in the alcohol-related than in the force-related cases). Complainant blame was higher when there was a prior relationship between the parties and was higher in the alcohol-related cases than in the force-related cases, except in the ex-partner rape where the pattern was reversed. Participants with high rape myth acceptance held the defendant less liable and blamed the complainant more, especially when the two had known each other. Study 2 largely replicated these findings with 129 postgraduate trainee lawyers and showed that sentencing recommendations also varied as a function of defendant-complainant relationship and coercive strategy.

40|$|The US Department of Defense {{recently}} released the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), a comprehensive report to Congress detailing the projected {{requirements of the}} US military {{for the next several}} decades. Among security analysts and defense industry experts, the release of the QDR is a highly anticipated event, as it usually presents a mix of threat analysis, <b>strategy,</b> <b>force</b> structure and acquisition decisions. It reveals how key US decision makers in the Pentagon envision the military’s future and how the Defense Department is preparing for it. After the much maligned strategic decisions of the Bush administration, many defense observers expected the Obama administration to adjust the US defense posture despite the decision to retain Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. The QDR, as the first strategic document released by the Obama administration, was surprising mainly due to its lack of surprises. For policymakers in the Pentagon, future threats, conflict scenarios and force structures will resemble current ones. The Obama administration looks to continue the expansive strategic priorities of the Bush administration, seeking only to perform them in a slightly more sustainable manner.

Budgetary procedures involve: formulation and transmittal, congressional action, and execution and auditing. In the United States, as in Venezuela, the formulation procedure is initiated by the executive branch, but during the congressional process the executive formulation may be altered. Enforcement of budgetary requirements lie with the executive branch and the Comptroller General. In the United States Department of Defense, the Planning, Programming and Budgeting System (PPBS) was developed to facilitate budgeting in terms of military forces. The U. S.

The Venezuelan Armed Force has developed a PPBS, which is quite similar to that which exists in the U.

40|$|The fortieth {{anniversary of}} the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre’s {{founding}} provided the opportunity to assemble many of Australia’s leading analysts and commentators to review {{some of the more}} significant issues that should define Australian defence policy. In the first 20 years after its establishment, SDSC scholars played a prominent role in shaping the ideas and aspirations that eventually found official expression in the 1987 Defence of Australia White Paper. This policy sustained a coherent balance between <b>strategy,</b> <b>force</b> structure and budgets for well over a decade. In recent years, however, the cumulative effects {{of the end of the}} Cold War and watershed events like the East Timor experience; the attacks on New York and Washington, D. C., in September 2001; the Bali bombings in October 2002; and the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 have fractured the former consensus on defence policy. These developments have eroded acceptance of the core judgements underpinning defence policy. This has led to a more tenuous connection between some recent major equipment acquisitions and declared policy. The unravelling of the consensus on the ‘defence of Australia’ policy means that we must again undertake a balanced, long-term assessment of the nature of Australia’s strategic interests. Only by doing so can we determine the kinds of armed forces that would contribute most effectively to protecting those interests. The papers collected in this volume are not informed by a common view of where Australia should focus its defence policy, but all address themes that should figure prominently in this difficult but essential task...|$|E
40|$|The {{forthcoming}} Defence White Paper will be {{only the}} fifth {{since the end of}} the Vietnam War. This Defence Policy Discussion Paper provides Australians with an opportunity to contribute to the new White Paper and includes some of the key issues to consider. Defence White Papers are a rare event. The forthcoming Defence White Paper {{will be only}} the fifth {{since the end of the}} Vietnam War. A Defence White Paper and the strategic guidance it provides are critical to success in developing Defence policy. In the absence of an up-to-date strategic plan, aligned to the strategic environment in which this plan will be pursued, government decisions on Defence could become ad hoc and misdirected. In the past, White Papers have rightly had a major focus on <b>strategy,</b> <b>force</b> structure and capital investment in major military platforms. The current White Paper project will do that and more. Through the White Paper process, the Australian Government will develop a comprehensive picture across a range of Defence issues. The crucial starting point for the White Paper process will be a wide-ranging review of our security environment and our strategic interests, and subsequent determinations of the future tasks and roles for the Australian Defence Force (ADF). Unless we start from this base, future decisions about the ADF’s force structure and key defence capabilities will be neither rigorous nor disciplined. The White Paper will look to address the following questions: * What is the likely future role of force in the international system? * What is the international system going to look like in a couple of decades - when a number of emerging major powers will have attained considerably more economic, strategic and raw military power than they currently have today, or have had in the past? * What impacts will these changes have on the role of Defence? * What should be the key tasks for Defence over these coming decades? * How might the ADF’s military capabilities need to change to stay relevant into the future? * What financial, workforce and other business impacts might these changes entail? To support Defence 2 ̆ 7 s work on the White Paper, the Defence Minister, Joel Fitzgibbon, has established a community consultation panel to provide Australians with an opportunity to have a say on the new White Paper. Building stronger community interest in the future of Defence is an important priority for the Government. This Defence Policy Discussion Paper marks the first step in that process. In this paper are some of the key issues to consider. This is not a statement of government policy. Rather it is a starting place.   The results of this discussion paper have been published as Looking over the horizon: Australians consider defenc...|$|E

40|$|A {{truck and}} {{multiple}} trailer system {{consists of a}} wheeled mobile robot that tows multiple trailers. These systems are widely used {{across a variety of}} industries for both indoor and outdoor services. Based on the kinematic model, the truck and multiple trailer system {{is considered to be a}} typical nonlinear system. Thus, controlling a truck and multiple trailer system is a challenging research topic that has received increasing attention from both academics and engineering practitioners. The use of a truck and multiple trailer system is important as it can boost the capacity of land transportation vehicles. However, an insufficient degree-of-freedoms in the available controls means that the steering of such systems remains problematic. Indeed, as the numbers of trailers in any system increases the issues become increasingly complicated. This research studies three intelligent control approaches that progressively improve system performance, such that the requirements of an exact and sophisticated system model can be relaxed. For the first approach, a virtual-robot tracking strategy was employed whereby a truck was directed to follow a specified trajectory. The generation of drive speed and turn-rate was viewed as an intelligent optimisation problem and a particle swarm optimisation algorithm was used for performance and implementation simplicity. Simulation studies in which a truck-and-trailer system moved across irregular paths were conducted using a developed intelligent controller. Satisfactory results supported the feasibility of this approach. For the second intelligent control approach, a hybrid force field controller was developed. Previously, the design of controllers for truck and multiple trailer systems have, for most cases, assumed collision free workspaces; however, for practical applications the linear velocity of the truck had to be adjusted so that it followed an arbitrary reference trajectory and avoided obstacles. A controller was designed hybridising virtual vehicle control <b>strategy,</b> <b>force</b> field approach and the particle swarm optimisation algorithm. A linear velocity was obtained that provided the desired positioning of the truck and multiple trailer system in a practical working space. Finally, a fuzzy logic controller was designed for a truck and multiple trailer system whereby the controller generated the drive velocity and turn-rate for the truck alone. An automatic fuzzy rule and membership tuning approach was developed that eradicated the need to rely solely on human expert inputs. The problem was approached using a particle swarm optimisation algorithm that removed the need for human expert knowledge input while searching for a near optimal solution. Thus, the truck and- multiple trailer system could be driven to a directed position following a trajectory on a two-dimensional terrain. The simulation results of both a one-trailer system and multi-trailer system showed the effectiveness of the derived fuzzy controller. The outcomes reported in this thesis have contributed to the development of intelligent motion controllers for the truck and multiple trailer system. In particular, intelligent design approaches were adopted that mitigated the need for an exact knowledge of a complicated system model...|$|E

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Realistic training ranges {{are one of the}} most valued assets the military has in preparing its personnel for their missions. Realistic training requires access to areas and environments that closely match the locations where the military may face combat or complex situations. International events, changes in <b>strategy,</b> <b>force</b> structure, base closures, and population growth are increasing the challenges the military faces in training its personnel to be prepared to defend the nation. Moreover, the military services report that they have increasingly lost training range capabilities because of factors such as encroachment. To respond to these challenges and increase the sustainability of military ranges, the Department of Defense (DOD) has launched a number of efforts aimed at preserving training ranges while also minimizing adverse environmental effects of training activities. As required by section 366 (a) of the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 (as amended), DOD was to submit a comprehensive plan for using existing authorities available to the department to address training constraints caused by limitations on the use of worldwide military lands, marine areas, and airspace to Congress at the same time as the President submitted his budget for fiscal year 2004 with annual progress reports for fiscal year 2005, extending through fiscal year 2013. To address these requirements, DOD has submitted its sustainable ranges report annually since 2004. In addition, we are required to submit annual evaluations of DOD's reports to Congress within 90 days of receiving these reports from DOD. In addition to the sustainable ranges report, DOD provides Congress the "Readiness and Environmental Protection Initiative Report. " This report is required separately under 10 U. S. C. 2684 a and describes, among other things, certain projects and other actions undertaken as part of a long-term strategy to ensure sustainability of military test and training ranges, military installations, and associated airspace. As such, this report complements the sustainable ranges report in addressing some actions taken by DOD to mitigate encroachment on military installations and ranges that require, or may reasonably require, safety or operational buffer areas. Both reports respond to statutory reporting requirements but target different aspects of DOD's efforts to capture mission requirements, current asset capability, and current and future risks to these capabilities from encroachment. In our prior reviews of DOD's sustainable ranges reports, we noted that DOD had not addressed certain required elements when it initially submitted its comprehensive plan in 2004. Over time, we concluded that DOD had increasingly improved its report submissions and had reported on actions taken on our prior recommendations. This report is our evaluation of DOD's 2011 sustainable ranges report. In this report, we summarize our observations on the extent to which DOD's 2011 sustainable ranges report meets the requirements specified by section 366 and identify opportunities for improving future report submissions. We also discuss DOD's plans for its 2012 report submission. In accordance with the mandate, we are submitting this report to Congress within 90 days of receiving DOD's 2011 sustainable ranges report on July 21, 2011. ...|$|E
