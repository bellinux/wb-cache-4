5|$|The most {{significant}} of the morphological innovations that characterize Ottawa is {{the restructuring of}} the three person prefixes that occur on both nouns and verbs. The prefixes carry grammatical information about grammatical person (first, <b>second,</b> <b>or</b> <b>third).</b> Syncope modifies the pronunciation of the prefixes by deleting the short vowel in each prefix.|$|E

Aldridge batted and threw right-handed. He began his pro career by signing a contract with Indianapolis of the American Association in 1915, but first played for Denver of the Western League and then Erie of the Central League. He played for Indianapolis in 1916 where he was scouted for the Chicago Cubs. He was sold to the Cubs on August 28, 1916.|$|E
5|$|Beyond these {{contemporary}} attestations, Neferhotep {{is listed}} on the 34th entry of the Karnak king list {{as well as the}} 7th column, 25th row of the Turin canon. The Turin king list credits Neferhotep with a reign of 11 years and 1 to 4 months, the <b>second</b> <b>or</b> <b>third</b> longest of the dynasty after Merneferre Ay (23 years) and Sobekhotep IV (912 years).|$|E
5|$|He {{had always}} been a heavy drinker, and there were times in those seasons of discontent when he drank more than ever. But he was not always drunk. He went on the wagon (for him this meant beer instead of whiskey) for days and weeks at a time. The {{difficulty}} toward the end was that he couldn't hold the stuff. He went to pieces on his <b>second</b> <b>or</b> <b>third</b> drink. And he did not snap back quickly.|$|E

In {{the first game of the}} test series on 21 February 2012, which Australia won 13–5, she scored four goals. Southern did not compete in the <b>second</b> <b>or</b> <b>third</b> games, but in Australia's fourth game victory of 14–8, she scored two goals.|$|E
5|$|Johnson further {{established}} himself as a quality player in Phoenix. In his three years as a Sun, Johnson averaged 14–20 points a game and provided tough defense. He played in two All-Star Games, was voted into three consecutive All-Defensive First Teams and earned his only All-NBA First Team appearance. In this period Johnson, like in Seattle, played shooting guard and became the main scorer on the team, as opposed to being the <b>second</b> <b>or</b> <b>third</b> option as a Sonic.|$|E
5|$|The Wu secured Xiangyang, the Nan Territory, Jiangling, and Jing Province from Wei before Shu's Zhuge Liang could, {{and also}} {{defeated}} Meng Huo for a <b>second</b> (<b>or</b> <b>third)</b> {{time in the}} south. Their final battle against Shu is at Yiling, where they use a fire attack to force Liu Bei to retreat to Bai Di Castle, where he is then defeated (or killed). If Wei has fallen first, Wu will defeat the Shu at Chengdu and occupy the lands of Shu Han, killing their officers.|$|E
500|$|Pope credits Ibn Ali with {{influencing}} saxophonist John Coltrane's {{sheets of}} sound approach. Ibn Ali examined {{the possibilities of}} playing fourths, and of using [...] "chord progressions that moved by <b>seconds</b> <b>or</b> <b>thirds</b> instead of fifths, in playing a variety of scales and arpeggios against each chord" [...] – features later used extensively in Coltrane's playing. A home recording of Ibn Ali playing with Coltrane and others in 1952 may exist.|$|R

5|$|There {{was also}} a {{mountains}} classification, the leadership of which was marked by a green jersey. In the mountains classifications, points were won by reaching {{the top of a}} climb before other cyclists. Each climb was categorized as either first, <b>second,</b> <b>or</b> <b>third</b> category, with more points available for the higher-categorized climbs. The Cima Coppi, the race's highest point of elevation, awarded still more points than the other first-category climbs.|$|E
5|$|After the 1952 season, Maryland and {{six other}} schools left the Southern Conference to form the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The {{following}} year, the conference honored its inaugural season's best players with an All-ACC team. In that initial class, five Terrapins were selected to the first team and two to the second team. Since 1953, Maryland players have received first-team All-ACC honors a total of 132times. Terrapins have been named to All-ACC <b>second</b> <b>or</b> <b>third</b> teams an additional 61times, although those teams have not been published continuously and there currently is no third team.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{the area}} of Roman occupation, {{in the west and}} north, there are over 60 sites {{identified}} of wheelhouses. Perhaps a development of earlier Atlantic roundhouses, these have a characteristic outer wall surrounding a circle of stone piers (bearing a resemblance to the spokes of a wheel). Over 400 souterrains, small underground constructions, have been discovered in Scotland, many of them in the south-east, and although few have been dated, those that have suggest a construction date in the <b>second</b> <b>or</b> <b>third</b> centuries CE. They are usually found close to settlements (whose timber frames are much less well-preserved) and may have been for storing perishable agricultural products.|$|E

Dean {{repeatedly}} came distant <b>seconds</b> <b>or</b> <b>third</b> for almost all categories of voters. Edward defeated Clark amongst Male voters as well as voters under 65 but only by a very tiny margin. Lieberman finished in a distant third in almost all categories except for Republicans in which he nearly defeated John Kerry.|$|R

5|$|In Haydn's {{previous}} {{two sets of}} quartets, the Opus 20 ("Sun") and Opus 33 ("Russian"), he adopted a variety of cyclical structures, particularly in the alternate placement of the slow movement as the <b>second</b> <b>or</b> <b>third</b> movement. But in the Opus 50 set, each quartet follows the same fast–slow–minuet–fast sequence. The set is also characterised by {{a high degree of}} monothematicism (the use of a single theme within a movement). In a number of movements, including sonata form movements and minuets and trios, Haydn eschews presenting a second and contrasting theme and instead elects to explore the full potential of the primary theme.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{other birds}} can be seen, {{especially}} during the spring and autumn migration. Sand martins (Riparia riparia) arrive early and can usually be seen hawking over the water for insects in the <b>second</b> <b>or</b> <b>third</b> week of March. Flocks of tits (Paridae), swallows (Hirundinidae) and terns (Sternidae) can regularly be seen. Waders, such as lapwings (Vanellus vanellus), dunlin (Calidris alpina) and common snipe (Gallinago gallinago), are attracted to the muddy shores if the water level drops in autumn. By midwinter up to 55,000 gulls, mostly black-headed gull (Chroicocephalus ridibundus) and common gull (Larus canus), may be roosting. Good numbers of reed warblers (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) and sedge warblers (A. schoenobaenus) nest in the fringing reeds, along with grebes (Podicipedidae) and Eurasian coots (Fulica atra).|$|E
5|$|Rather {{than using}} a turn-based battle system like {{contemporaneous}} role-playing games, Secret of Mana features real-time battles {{with a power}} bar mechanic. The game has a unique Ring Command menu system, which pauses the action and allows the player to make decisions {{in the middle of}} battle. An innovative cooperative multiplayer system allows a <b>second</b> <b>or</b> <b>third</b> player to drop {{in and out of the}} game at any time. Secret of Mana was directed and designed by Koichi Ishii, programmed primarily by Nasir Gebelli, and produced by veteran Square designer Hiromichi Tanaka.|$|E

5|$|Soon after, they {{measured}} and triangulated the shooting, {{but could not}} determine from which angle Hamilton fired. Burr's shot hit Hamilton in the lower abdomen above the right hip. The bullet ricocheted off Hamilton's <b>second</b> <b>or</b> <b>third</b> false rib, fracturing it and causing considerable damage to his internal organs, particularly his liver and diaphragm, before becoming lodged in his first or second lumbar vertebra. Biographer Ron Chernow considered the circumstances to indicate that, after taking deliberate aim, Burr fired second, while biographer James Earnest Cooke suggested that Burr took careful aim and shot first, and Hamilton fired while falling, after being struck by Burr's bullet.|$|E
5|$|The American Chess Congress' final {{proposal}} {{was that the}} winner of a tournament {{to be held in}} New York in 1889 should be regarded as world champion for the time being, but must be prepared to face a challenge from the <b>second</b> <b>or</b> <b>third</b> placed competitor within a month. Steinitz wrote that he would not play in the tournament and would not challenge the winner unless the second and third placed competitors failed to do so. The tournament was duly played, but the outcome was not quite as planned: Mikhail Chigorin and Max Weiss tied for first place; their play-off resulted in four draws, and Weiss then wanted to get back to his work for the Rothschild Bank, conceding the title to Chigorin.|$|E
5|$|The sports {{club was}} founded on 17 December 1969 {{under the name of}} Al-Jameaa, which {{translates}} to The University, to represent the University of Baghdad in official Iraqi competitions.

In their first season, 1970–71, the team under the management of Thamir Muhsin finished top of Division One and were promoted to the League of the Institutes. However, in the 1971–72 League of the Institutes season, they finished in last place and were relegated back to Division One.|$|E
