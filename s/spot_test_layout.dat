40|$|Background: Most {{universities}} currently practice traditional practical <b>spot</b> <b>tests</b> {{to evaluate}} students. However, traditional methods have several disadvantages. Computer-based examination techniques {{are becoming more}} popular among medical educators worldwide. Therefore incorporating the computer interface in practical <b>spot</b> <b>testing</b> is a novel concept that may minimize the shortcomings of traditional methods. Assessing students’ attitudes and perspectives is vital in understanding how students perceive the novel method. Methods: One hundred and sixty medical students were randomly allocated to either a computer-based <b>spot</b> <b>test</b> (n= 80) or a traditional <b>spot</b> <b>test</b> (n= 80). The students rated their attitudes and perspectives regarding the <b>spot</b> <b>test</b> method soon after the test. The results were described comparatively. Results: Students had higher positive attitudes towards the computer-based practical <b>spot</b> <b>test</b> compared to the traditional <b>spot</b> <b>test.</b> Their recommendations to introduce the novel practical <b>spot</b> <b>test</b> method for future exams and to other universities were statistically significantly higher. Conclusions: The computer-based practical <b>spot</b> <b>test</b> is viewed as more acceptable to students than the traditional spot-test...|$|R

Therefore a simple, fast and economic <b>spot</b> <b>test</b> for monitoring peroxidase during the purification procedure was developed.

40|$|Several methods {{exist for}} {{detecting}} the genotoxicity {{and especially the}} mutagenicity of physical or chemical agents. For the extrapolation of experimental results to man, in vivo results are more relevant than in vitro ones. Risk estimations for man gained from in vivo data are more reliable than those from in vitro data. The <b>spot</b> <b>test</b> is the best validated method for detection of genotoxic alterations, namely gene mutations and recombinations, in somatic cells of mice. ( [...] .) Like other mutagenicity <b>tests,</b> the <b>spot</b> <b>test</b> not only serves for detecting mutagenic effects but also for detecting carcinogenic potential. An important feature of the <b>spot</b> <b>test</b> {{is its ability to}} detect recombinations which can unmask carcinogen-induced mutations, as well as being able to detect gene mutations which play a role during initiation.

40|$|Behavioral {{tests of}} animals in a {{controlled}} experimental setting provide a valuable tool to advance understanding of genotype-phenotype relations, and to {{study the effects of}} genetic and environmental manipulations. To optimally benefit from the increasing numbers of genetically engineered mice, reliable high-throughput methods for comprehensive behavioral phenotyping of mice lines have become a necessity. Here, we describe the development and validation of an anxiety <b>test,</b> the light <b>spot</b> <b>test,</b> that allows for unsupervised, automated, high-throughput testing of mice in a home-cage system. This automated behavioral test circumvents bias introduced by pretest handling, and enables recording both baseline behavior and the behavioral test response over a prolonged period of time. We demonstrate that the light <b>spot</b> <b>test</b> induces a behavioral response in C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. This behavior reverts to baseline when the aversive stimulus is switched off, and is blunted by treatment with the anxiolytic drug Diazepam, demonstrating predictive validity of the assay, and indicating that the observed behavioral response has a significant anxiety component. Also, we investigated the effectiveness of the light <b>spot</b> <b>test</b> as part of sequential testing for different behavioral aspects in the home-cage. Two learning tests, administered prior to the light <b>spot</b> <b>test,</b> affected the light <b>spot</b> <b>test</b> parameters. The light <b>spot</b> <b>test</b> is a novel, automated assay for anxiety-related high-throughput testing of mice in an automated home-cage environment, allowing for both comprehensive behavioral phenotyping of mice, and rapid screening of pharmacological compounds...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} a {{quantitative}} spectrophotometric enzyme assay, a fluorescent <b>spot</b> <b>test</b> and a cytochemical assay for glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency were compared systematically. The high sensitivity of the spectrophotometric assay and the fluorescent <b>spot</b> <b>test</b> in the detection of severely deficient individuals was confirmed. For the detection of heterozygote females, however both tests were unreliable; the sensitivities of the fluorescent <b>spot</b> <b>test</b> and the spectrophotometric assay being 32 % and 11 % respectively. Specificities for both tests were high (99 %). Introduction of the ratio of glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase (G- 6 -PD/PK ratio) activities increased {{the sensitivity of the}} spectrophotometric assay to nearly 100 %. It is concluded that the fluorescent <b>spot</b> <b>test</b> should be used for the diagnosis of G- 6 -PD deficiency in developing countries; whereas if spectrophotometric enzyme assays are available, the G- 6 -PD/PK ratio should always be performed.
