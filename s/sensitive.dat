5|$|Foliose lichens such as Physcia caesia are {{intermediate}} {{in their}} response to air pollution — less <b>sensitive</b> than fruticose lichens, but more <b>sensitive</b> than crustose lichens. Physcia caesia is found in cities, though at lower frequencies than more pollution-tolerant species.|$|E
5|$|However, none {{of these}} blood tests for {{biological}} markers is as <b>sensitive</b> as screening questionnaires.|$|E
5|$|The mission {{added two}} new {{instruments}} to Hubble. The first instrument, the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, {{is now the}} most <b>sensitive</b> ultraviolet spectrograph installed on the telescope. Its far-UV channel is 30 times more <b>sensitive</b> than previous instruments and the near-UV is twice as <b>sensitive.</b> The second instrument, the Wide Field Camera 3, is a panchromatic wide-field camera that can record {{a wide range of}} wavelengths, including infrared, visible, and ultraviolet light. Atlantis also carried the Soft-Capture Mechanism, which was installed onto the telescope.|$|E
5|$|A recent (2015) {{application}} of europium is in quantum memory chips which can reliably store information {{for days at}} a time; these could allow <b>sensitive</b> quantum data to be stored to a hard disk-like device and shipped around the country.|$|E
5|$|A wider survey, {{but less}} <b>sensitive,</b> {{was carried out}} {{as part of the}} Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey; a section of this was then {{observed}} for longer to create the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field, which was the most <b>sensitive</b> optical deep field image for years until the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field was completed in 2012. Images from the Extreme Deep Field, or XDF, were released on 26 September 2012 to a number of media agencies. Images released in the XDF show galaxies which are now believed to have formed in the first 500 million years following the Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{caution is}} {{required}} in the elderly, as they are more <b>sensitive</b> to the pharmacological effects of benzodiazepines, metabolise them more slowly, and {{are more prone to}} adverse effects, including drowsiness, amnesia (especially anterograde amnesia), ataxia, hangover effects, confusion, and falls.|$|E
5|$|After scalemaker Saxton {{left the}} Mint Service in 1844, {{much of the}} work of {{maintaining}} and modifying the <b>sensitive</b> balances for which Saxton was responsible fell to Peale. The Chief Coiner made a number of improvements to the scales, which he wrote up for an article in the Journal of The Franklin Institute in 1847. These balances, <b>sensitive</b> to , were protected by plate glass from air currents and dust.|$|E
5|$|Although starfish do {{not have}} many {{well-defined}} sense organs, they are <b>sensitive</b> to touch, light, temperature, orientation {{and the status of}} the water around them. The tube feet, spines and pedicellariae are <b>sensitive</b> to touch. The tube feet, especially those at the tips of the rays, are also <b>sensitive</b> to chemicals, enabling the starfish to detect odour sources such as food. There are eyespots at the ends of the arms, each one made of 80–200 simple ocelli. These are composed of pigmented epithelial cells that respond to light and are covered by a thick, transparent cuticle that both protects the ocelli and acts to focus light. Many starfish also possess individual photoreceptor cells in other parts of their bodies and respond to light even when their eyespots are covered. Whether they advance or retreat depends on the species.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from some}} minor medical applications, the first {{commercial}} use was the daguerreotype. In 1840, bromine was discovered to have some advantages over the previously used iodine vapor to create the light <b>sensitive</b> silver halide layer in daguerreotypy.|$|E
5|$|As Pozdniakov readily admits, his {{analysis}} is highly <b>sensitive</b> {{to the accuracy}} of the glyph inventory. Since he has not published the details of how he established this inventory, it is not possible for others to verify his work.|$|E
5|$|Because each antenna {{was aimed}} to be <b>sensitive</b> {{primarily}} {{in a single}} direction, {{the length of the}} blips depended on the position of the target relative to the fighter. For instance, a target located 35 degrees above the fighter would cause the signal in the upper vertical receiver to be maximized, causing a long blip to appear on the upper trace, and none on the lower trace. Although less <b>sensitive</b> directly forward, both vertical antennas could see {{directly in front of the}} fighter, so a target located dead ahead caused two slightly shorter blips, one on either side of the centreline.|$|E
5|$|Because linear probing is {{especially}} <b>sensitive</b> to unevenly distributed hash values, {{it is important}} to combine it with a high-quality hash function that does not produce such irregularities.|$|E
5|$|Boron nitride {{reacts with}} iodine {{fluoride}} in trichlorofluoromethane at −30°C {{to produce an}} extremely <b>sensitive</b> contact explosive, NI3, in low yield.|$|E
5|$|Bumblebees do {{not have}} ears, {{and it is not}} known whether or how well they can hear. However, they are <b>sensitive</b> to the {{vibrations}} made by sound travelling through wood or other materials.|$|E
5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings of Corythosaurus and modern birds and {{reptiles}} {{suggest that it}} may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day at short intervals. The sense of hearing in hadrosaurids, specifically such as Lophorhothon, also seems to have been greatly developed because of an elongated lagena. The presence of a thin stapes (an ear bone that is rod-like in reptiles), combined with a large eardrum implies the existence of a <b>sensitive</b> middle ear. It is possible that hadrosaurid ears are <b>sensitive</b> enough to detect as much sound as a modern crocodilian.|$|E
5|$|Education {{of local}} people to protect {{amphibians}} is crucial, along with legislation for local protection and limiting {{the use of}} toxic chemicals, including some fertilizers and pesticides in <b>sensitive</b> amphibian areas.|$|E
5|$|Gates are {{sometimes}} installed at cave entrances to limit human entry into caves with <b>sensitive</b> or endangered bat species. The gates are designed not {{to limit the}} airflow, and thus to maintain the cave's micro-ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|His {{position}} {{on the border with}} Sudan to the north and near to the functioning Adar Yale oilfield was <b>sensitive.</b>|$|E
5|$|If {{tuberculosis}} recurs, {{testing to}} determine which antibiotics it is <b>sensitive</b> to is important before determining treatment. If multiple drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) is detected, treatment with at least four effective antibiotics for 18 to 24months is recommended.|$|E
5|$|In Quebec, as {{commissioner}} of the NFB, he attracted controversy for his decision to suppress distribution of several politically <b>sensitive</b> films by French Canadian directors.|$|E
5|$|Infrared <b>sensitive</b> {{semiconductor}} material is formed by alloying tellurium with cadmium and mercury to form mercury cadmium telluride.|$|E
5|$|It is soluble in benzene and THF, and is less <b>sensitive</b> to {{oxygen and}} water than Pu(C5H5)3 and Am(C5H5)3. Other Np(IV) {{cyclopentadienyl}} compounds {{are known for}} many ligands: they have the general formula (C5H5)3NpL, where L represents a ligand.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{standards}} {{exist for}} defining Henoch–Schönlein purpura, including the 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification and the 1994 Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC). Some have reported the ACR criteria {{to be more}} <b>sensitive</b> {{than those of the}} CHCC.|$|E
5|$|Native fish in Fossil Creek include {{headwater}} chub, roundtail chub, speckled dace, longfin dace, Sonora sucker, {{and desert}} sucker. Between 2007 and 2010, the Arizona Game and Fish Department and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service added native spikedace, loach minnows, Gila topminnows, and razorback suckers {{as well as}} more longfin dace above the barrier. All except speckled dace are special-status fish listed as endangered, threatened, or <b>sensitive</b> by federal or state agencies. In addition, more than 100 macroinvertebrate species live in the Fossil Creek watershed. One, the fossil springsnail, is listed <b>sensitive</b> by the U.S. Forest Service.|$|E
5|$|Near Tilbury, Highway401 {{loses its}} tall wall median barrier and narrows to four lanes, {{following}} lot lines laid between concession roads in a plan designed to limit {{damage to the}} <b>sensitive</b> agricultural lands through which the highway runs.|$|E
5|$|Orford Gage as Jason Hoag, a {{poet and}} {{frequent}} customer of Dante's, the Italian restaurant below Jacqueline's apartment. <b>Sensitive</b> and soft-spoken, he meets Mary at the restaurant and becomes invested in helping her find her sister.|$|E
5|$|Skeletal muscle TnI {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a <b>sensitive</b> and fast fiber-specific serum marker of skeletal muscle injury. fsTnI concentration in increased peripheral blood when fast twitch fibers were damaged.|$|E
5|$|Strong Lewis or protic acids are {{typically}} {{required for the}} reaction (e.g. TiCl4, BF3, MeSO3H). These promoters are not compatible with <b>sensitive</b> functional groups, limiting the substrate scope.|$|E
5|$|Synthetic RNA {{thermometers}} {{have been}} designed with just a simple single-hairpin structure. However, the secondary structure of such short RNA thermometers can be <b>sensitive</b> to mutation, as a single base change can render the hairpin inactive in vivo.|$|E
5|$|Telecommunication over fixed {{lines is}} called {{point-to-point}} communication {{because it is}} between one transmitter and one receiver. Telecommunication through radio broadcasts is called broadcast communication because it is between one powerful transmitter and numerous low-power but <b>sensitive</b> radio receivers.|$|E
5|$|The Appalachian Trail {{is home to}} {{thousands}} of species of plants and animals, including 2,000 rare, threatened, endangered, and <b>sensitive</b> plant and animal species.|$|E
5|$|The Fart (voiced by Pat Duke), {{a monster}} made of {{buttocks}} who flatulates when touched—is the most <b>sensitive</b> and levelheaded of the group.|$|E
5|$|The few {{amphibians}} {{present in}} the forest include the Rocky Mountain tailed frog, long-toed salamander, and Columbia spotted frog, which has been listed as a <b>sensitive</b> species. Common snakes include bullsnakes, garter snakes, and rubber boas.|$|E
5|$|The five {{processes}} formed what Aristotle {{called the}} soul: {{it was not}} something extra, but the system consisting exactly of these mechanisms. The Aristotelian soul died with the animal and was thus purely biological. Different types of organism possessed different types of soul. Plants had a vegetative soul, responsible for reproduction and growth. Animals had both a vegetative and a <b>sensitive</b> soul, responsible for mobility and sensation. Humans, uniquely, had a vegetative, a <b>sensitive,</b> and a rational soul, capable of thought and reflection.|$|E
5|$|The instrument's design also {{required}} a more <b>sensitive</b> phototube than was commercially available at that time. Beckman {{was able to}} obtain small batches of an experimental phototube from RCA for the first Model D instruments.|$|E
5|$|The partial {{pressures}} of oxygen {{and carbon dioxide}} in the arterial blood are measured by the peripheral chemoreceptors – the aortic and carotid bodies, and the central chemoreceptors of the medulla oblongata of the brainstem. The peripheral chemoreceptors are more <b>sensitive</b> to the arterial partial pressure of oxygen than they are to the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide. The central chemoreceptor is particularly <b>sensitive</b> to the pH of the cerebrospinal fluid, which is directly influenced by the partial pressure of {{carbon dioxide in the}} arterial blood.|$|E
