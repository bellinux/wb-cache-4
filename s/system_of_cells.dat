In this case both the maze walls and the space between the walls {{take the form of a}} mathematical tree. If the free space of the maze is partitioned into simple cells (such as the squares of a grid) then this <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> can be viewed as an embedding of a planar graph, in which the tree structure of the walls forms a spanning tree of the graph and the tree structure of the free space forms a spanning tree of the dual graph. Similar pairs of interdigitating trees can also be seen in the tree-shaped pattern of streams and rivers within a drainage basin and the dual tree-shaped pattern of ridgelines separating the streams.|$|E
60|$|The {{simplest}} form of polype {{is that of}} a fleshy bag open at one end, surmounted by {{a circle}} of contractile threads or fingers called tentacles. The plate shows, on a very minute scale, at figs. 1, 3, and 6, several of these little polypiform bodies protruding from their cells. But the Hydra or Fresh-water Polype has no cell, and is quite unconnected with any root thread, or with other individuals of the same species. It is perfectly free, and so simple in its structure, that when the sac which forms its body is turned inside out it will continue to perform the functions of life as before. The greater part, however, of these Hydraform Polypes, although equally simple as individuals, are connected in a compound life by means of their variously formed POLYPIDOM, as the branched <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> is termed. The Hydroid Zoophytes are represented in the first plate by the following examples.|$|E

40|$|We prove Lusztig's conjectures P 1 [...] P 15 for the affine Weyl {{group of}} type G̃_ 2 for all choices of parameters.

We then investigate the connection between Kazhdan-Lusztig cells and the Plancherel Theorem in type G̃_ 2, allowing us to prove 1 and determine the set of Duflo involutions. From there, the proof of the remaining conjectures follows very naturally, essentially from the combinatorics of Weyl characters of types G_ 2 and A_ 1, along with some explicit computations for the finite cells...|$|R

5000|$|A {{cellular}} automaton {{consists of a}} regular <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells,</b> each containing a symbol from a finite alphabet, together with a uniform rule called a transition function for updating all cells simultaneously based on the values of neighboring cells. Most commonly the cells are arranged {{in the form of}} a line or a higher-dimensional integer grid, but other arrangements of cells are also possible. What is required of the cells is that they form a structure in which every cell [...] "looks the same as" [...] every other cell: there is a symmetry of both the arrangement of cells and the rule set that takes any cell to any other cell. Mathematically, this can be formalized by the notion of a group, a set of elements together with an associative and invertible binary operation. The elements of the group can be used as the cells of an automaton, with symmetries generated by the group operation. For instance, a one-dimensional line of cells can be described in this way as the additive group of the integers, and the higher-dimensional integer grids can be described as the free abelian groups.|$|E

5000|$|Another very {{characteristic}} {{feature of}} the Gothic style, domestic and ecclesiastical alike, is the division of interior space into individual cells according to the building's ribbing and vaults, {{regardless of whether or}} not the structure actually has a vaulted ceiling. This <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> of varying size and shape juxtaposed in various patterns was again totally unique to antiquity and the Early Middle Ages and scholars, Frankl included, have emphasised the mathematical and geometric nature of this design. Frankl in particular thought of this layout as [...] "creation by division" [...] rather than the Romanesque's [...] "creation by addition." [...] Others, namely Viollet-le-Duc, Wilhelm Pinder, and August Schmarsow, instead proposed the term [...] "articulated architecture." [...] The opposite theory as suggested by Henri Focillon and Jean Bony is of [...] "spacial unification", or of the creation of an interior that is made for sensory overload via the interaction of many elements and perspectives. Interior and exterior partitions, often extensively studied, have been found to at times contain features, such as thoroughfares at window height, that make the illusion of thickness. Additionally, the piers separating the isles eventually stopped being part of the walls but rather independent objects that jut out from the actual aisle wall itself.|$|E

40|$|Several <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> surface antigens {{have now}} been {{recognized}} serologically on leukemia <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> the mouse (1). The technique that has played the {{major role in the}} detection and analysis <b>of</b> these antigenic <b>systems</b> is the cytotoxic test, originally developed by Gofer and O'Gorman (2), in which target cells are lysed by specific antibody {{in the presence of a}} suitable source of complement.

In this way, three general categories <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> surface antigens, in addition to H- 2, have been serologically defined on leukemia cells (1).

40|$|The {{asymmetric}} {{distribution of}} damaged cellular components {{has been observed}} in species ranging from fission yeast to humans. To study the potential advantages of damage segregation, we have developed a mathematical model describing ageing mammalian tissue, that is, a multicellular <b>system</b> <b>of</b> somatic <b>cells</b> that do not rejuvenate at cell division. To illustrate {{the applicability of the}} model, we specifically consider damage incurred by mutations to mitochondrial DNA, which are thought to be implicated in the mammalian ageing process. We show analytically that the asymmetric distribution of damaged cellular components reduces the overall damage level and increases the longevity <b>of</b> the <b>cell</b> population. Motivated by the experimental reports of damage segregation in human embryonic stem cells, dividing symmetrically with respect to cell-fate, we extend the model to consider spatially structured <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells.</b> Imposing spatial structure reduces, but does not eliminate, the advantage of asymmetric division over symmetric division.
