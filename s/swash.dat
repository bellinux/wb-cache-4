5|$|Book {{designer}} Elizabeth Friedländer drew some rarely-seen <b>swash</b> capitals for Bembo {{for capital}} introductions to Churchill's {{history of the}} second world war.|$|E
5|$|A major {{professional}} competitor to Bembo is Agmena, {{created by}} Jovica Veljović and released by Linotype in 2014. Intended {{as a unified}} serif design supporting Roman, Greek {{and a range of}} Cyrillic alphabets such as Serbian, it features a more calligraphic italic than Bembo with <b>swash</b> capitals and support for Greek ligatures.|$|E
5|$|A revival by Frederic Goudy for the American {{branch of}} Monotype, the name chosen to differ from other revivals. An elegant sample created by Bruce Rogers {{was shown in}} a spring 1923 issue of Monotype's magazine. It like Monotype Garamond {{features}} a large range of <b>swash</b> characters, based on Imprimerie Nationale specimen sheets.|$|E
50|$|As <b>swashes</b> {{are based}} on period handwriting, script typefaces with <b>swashes</b> are common, and include Zapf Chancery and Zapfino, both by Hermann Zapf.|$|R
5000|$|Most typefaces with <b>swashes</b> are serif fonts, {{among which}} (if present) {{they are often}} found solely in italics. Advanced digital fonts often supply two italic designs: one with <b>swashes</b> and a more {{restrained}} standard italic.|$|R
5000|$|Superimposed on {{the bottom}} of the logo is a red panel with the city name in {{commissioned}} lettering. The first and last letters are enlarged and have decorative <b>swashes</b> at each end. Between the <b>swashes</b> is written [...] "Montana" [...] in smaller blue capitals.|$|R
5|$|Monotype's {{well-known}} executive Stanley Morison {{wrote in}} his memoir that the italic was based on Granjon's work, but as Carter's annotations of it note, this seems generally to be a mistake. The <b>swash</b> capitals, however, at least, probably {{are based on the}} work of Granjon. Some publicity art for it in the metal period was created by a young Rodney Peppé.|$|E
5|$|Several digitisations {{have been}} made of both ATF's {{original}} Garamond and the Linotype adaptation, most notably a 2015 digitisation by van Bronkhorst with optical sizes and the original <b>swash</b> characters. A loose adaptation with sans-serif companion by Christian Schwartz is the corporate font of Deutsche Bahn.|$|E
5|$|American Type Founders {{created a}} revival of the Imprimerie Nationale fonts from around 1917, which was {{designed}} in-house by its design department led by Morris Fuller Benton under the influence of its historian and advisor Henry Lewis Bullen. It received a sumptuous showing, marketed especially towards advertisers, in ATF's 1923 specimen book. Also involved in the design's development was book and advertising designer T.M. Cleland, who created a set of matching borders and ornaments, and according to Warde and Garnett also designed the <b>swash</b> characters.|$|E
50|$|Surveyor's {{most notable}} feature is its {{extremely}} {{wide range of}} weights and styles, designed to provide many options for complex publications such as magazines. The typeface is created in weights from light to black, with italic styles offering designs with or without <b>swashes.</b> <b>Swashes</b> themselves are controlled programmatically so that they only appear where there is space for them, so words that are fully capitalised only have <b>swashes</b> at the start. It is also sold in three different optical sizes, for text printed in different sizes from small to large.|$|R

5|$|As of 2017, Monotype's current {{digitisation}} of Gill Sans is Gill Sans Nova, by George Ryan. Gill Sans Nova adds many additional variants, {{including some}} of the previously undigitised inline versions, stylistic alternates and an ultra-light weight (once an option in metal type) which had been digitised for Grazia. The fonts differ from Gill Sans MT in their adoption of the hooked 1 as default, while the regular weight is renamed 'Medium'. Monotype celebrated the release with a London exhibition on Gill's work, as they had in 1958 to mark the general release of Gill's serif design Joanna. One addition was italic <b>swash</b> caps, which had been considered by Gill but never released.|$|E
5|$|Kareena begins dating Mickey Miller (Joe <b>Swash),</b> but {{problems}} arise between them when Juley Smith (Joseph Kpobie) gives Kareena cocaine {{and she is}} seduced by him, though she manages to sort out her differences with Mickey eventually. Adi also has relationship problems after Sasha cheats on him with Danny Moon (Jake Maskall), leading to the couple's split. Gangster Johnny Allen (Billy Murray) agrees to loan several cars to the Ferreiras' business, but {{three of them are}} stolen and Johnny orders the family out of Walford immediately or face repercussions. Kareena initially opts to remain in Walford with Mickey, but at the last minute she changes her mind and departs with the rest of her family in March 2005.|$|E
5|$|Released in 1989, Adobe Garamond is {{designed}} by Robert Slimbach for Adobe Systems, {{based on a}} Roman type by Garamond and an italic type by Robert Granjon. The font family contains regular, semibold, and bold weights and was developed through viewing fifteenth-century equipment at the Plantin-Moretus Museum. Its quite even, mature design attracted attention on release for its authenticity to Garamond's work, a contrast to the much more aggressive ITC Garamond popular at the time. The OpenType version of the font family was released in 2000 as Adobe Garamond Pro, with enhanced support for its alternate glyphs such as ligatures, small caps and italic <b>swash</b> capitals, and is sold through Adobe's Typekit system. It {{is one of the}} most popular versions of Garamond in books and fine printing.|$|E

5|$|Monotype's 1922-3 design, {{based on}} Jannon's {{work in the}} Imprimerie Nationale, is bundled with many Microsoft products. Its italic, {{faithful}} to Jannon's, is extremely calligraphic, with a very variable angle of slant and flourishes on several lower-case letters. Its commercial release is more extensive than the basic Microsoft release, featuring additional features such as <b>swash</b> capitals and small capitals, although like many pre-digital fonts these are only included in the regular weight. Popular in the metal type era, its digitisation has been criticised for having too light a colour on the page for body text if printed with many common printing systems, a problem with several Monotype digitisations of the period. Monotype's 1933 guide to identifying their typefaces noted the asymmetrical T, the sharp triangular serif at top left of m, n, p and r, and a q unlike the p, with a point at top right rather than a full serif.|$|E
5|$|The zone where land meets sea {{is known}} as the coast and the part between the lowest spring tides and the upper limit reached by {{splashing}} waves is the shore. A beach is the accumulation of sand or shingle on the shore. A headland is a point of land jutting out into the sea and a larger promontory {{is known as}} a cape. The indentation of a coastline—especially between two headlands—is a bay; a small bay with a narrow inlet is a cove and a large bay or bay-shaped sea may be referred to as a gulf. Coastlines are influenced by a number of factors including the strength of the waves arriving on the shore, the gradient of the land margin, the composition and hardness of the coastal rock, the inclination of the off-shore slope, and the changes of the level of the land due to local uplift or submergence. Normally, waves roll towards the shore at the rate of six to eight per minute. These are known as constructive waves as they tend to move material up the beach and have little erosive effect. Storm waves arrive on shore in rapid succession and are known as destructive waves, as their <b>swash</b> moves beach material seawards. Under their influence, the sand and shingle on the beach is ground together and abraded. Around high tide, the power of a storm wave impacting on the foot of a cliff has a shattering effect as air in cracks and crevices is compressed and then expands rapidly with release of pressure. At the same time, sand and pebbles have an erosive effect as they are thrown against the rocks. Along with other weathering processes such as frost, this tends to undercut the cliff. Gradually, a wave-cut platform develops {{at the foot of the}} cliff and this has a protective effect, reducing further wave-erosion.|$|E

25|$|Wave <b>swash</b> and {{currents}} can impact significantly on {{the sediment}} budget, {{although it is}} difficult to measure. <b>Swash</b> can be either an erosive or accretion process depending on many factors such as the sand texture and the individual wave itself. Although during fair weather the impact of <b>swash</b> is negligible, during storms the sea level can rise high enough to erode dunes and cliffs, dumping large quantities of sediment into the littoral cell, which can only be given back to the dune by aeolian transport. Where storm surge causes sediments to be deposited on the land from the littoral cell, they can form washover fans or open a new tidal inlet which transports sediment away from the littoral cell.|$|E
25|$|On 17 July 2011, it was {{reported}} that <b>Swash</b> would reprise the role of Mickey the following week as part of a storyline focusing on Mickey's brother, Darren (Hawkins).

It {{is considered to be a}} highly conflicted design, as Helvetica is seen as a spare and rational typeface and <b>swashes</b> are ostentatious: font designer Mark Simonson described it as [...] "almost sacrilegious". Martin would later claim to have been accused of [...] "typographic incest" [...] by one German writer for creating it.|$|R
