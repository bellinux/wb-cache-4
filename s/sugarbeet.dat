25|$|<b>Sugarbeet</b> roots {{have become}} a common crop for sucrose {{production}} in the northern United States. A concern among farmers is the impact that <b>sugarbeet</b> root aphids can have on these crops, which are colonized by and used as secondary hosts for <b>sugarbeet</b> root aphids.|$|E
25|$|Further {{studies have}} shown that <b>sugarbeet</b> root aphid {{infestation}} is most prevalent in the upper Midwest during drought years, and in the southwest during times of low irrigation. Sometimes, despite dry conditions, cool weather can decrease the prevalence of <b>sugarbeet</b> root aphid infestations.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sugarbeet</b> root aphids are {{characterized}} {{to be as}} small as pinheads, and take on a pale white-yellow color. They have globular bodies that are soft, with mandibular parts {{that allow them to}} pierce and suck and paired abdominal tubes that point backwards. There are both winged and wingless <b>sugarbeet</b> root aphids.|$|E
50|$|Ruth Colvin Starrett McGuire (1893 - 1950) was an American plant pathologist. She studied {{sugar cane}} {{diseases}} and <b>sugarbeets.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Sugarbeets</b> {{are grown}} on nearly 1. 5 {{million acres in}} the United States, with a {{production}} value in excess of $ 1. 1 billion for the 1997 crop year. In Nebraska, <b>sugarbeets</b> are grown on over 65, 000 acres in a dozen western counties generating over $ 36 million dollars in farm revenue. There are two active sugar refineries {{in the area that}} contribute to the local economy in terms of value added activity...|$|R
50|$|The larvae {{feed on the}} leaves, leafstems and crowns of <b>sugarbeets.</b> The species overwinters in the pupal {{stage in}} the soil.|$|R
25|$|Although certain control {{methods are}} {{effective}} on other root-feeding arthropods, control measures for <b>sugarbeet</b> root aphids are more difficult. Crop rotation and simple foliar and postemergence insecticides are usually ineffective. However, Knox Out 2FM and Counter 15G {{have proven to}} be effective in containing infestations, although some states, such as California, currently have no chemicals registered for use on the <b>sugarbeet</b> root aphid. Biological controls, such as introduction of fungal diseases or natural predators, may also serve as an effective means of pest control. Although it is unlikely that biological controls are fully capable of controlling <b>sugarbeet</b> root aphid populations, future research may increase their role in management.|$|E
25|$|The {{lifecycle}} of <b>sugarbeet</b> root aphids involves {{primary and}} secondary host plants. Galls are formed on the primary host, cottonwood, in the spring by the stem mother. Her wingless offspring, called apterae, feed on the gall until giving rise to winged individuals called alatae. These alatae {{break out of the}} gall and colonize the roots of their secondary hosts, <b>sugarbeet.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pemphigus betae, {{also known}} as the <b>sugarbeet</b> root aphid, is a species of gall-forming aphid that forms galls {{specifically}} on the commonly found Narrowleaf Cottonwood (aka the Willow-leaved Poplar tree), Populus angustifolia.|$|E
50|$|The {{degree of}} {{nitrogen}} fertilization is highly correlated to robust disease development: {{it has been}} shown that sugar beets supplied with excessive or adequate nitrogen are more diseased than <b>sugarbeets</b> with sub-optimal nitrogen levels. This is a paradox for farmers because, while increased nitrogen fertilization does increase sugar yield in non-infected <b>sugarbeets,</b> it also increases the severity of the disease if infection takes place. Thus, depending on the severity of infection, yield may go down with increased fertilizer use.|$|R
25|$|As they feed, aphids often {{transmit}} plant viruses to the plants, such as to potatoes, cereals, <b>sugarbeets,</b> {{and citrus}} plants. These viruses can sometimes kill the plants.|$|R
50|$|Belarus's main {{agricultural}} products are barley, rye, oats, and wheat, {{as well as}} potatoes, flax, rapeseed, and <b>sugarbeets.</b> Cereals and legumes (mainly barley and rye) take up 41% of sown area and another 43% is under crops used for animal feed. Potatoes and vegetables take up 11% of sown area and industrial crops (<b>sugarbeets,</b> flax, and some rapeseed) the remaining 4%. Products of animal origin are mainly pork, beef, and poultry. Belarus has about 1.5 million cows, but the milk yields are relatively low (less than 3,000 kg per cow per year).|$|R
25|$|After {{emerging}} in the autumn, the migrant forms of <b>sugarbeet</b> root aphids seek out Populus trees to colonize. These migrant forms are short-lived, and usually die within 12 to 48 hours. In selecting trees to colonize, the autumn migrants of <b>sugarbeet</b> root aphids prefer to colonize larger trees over smaller ones, {{and are likely to}} use simple cues such as tree crown size or tree resistance to colonization to decide on which trees to colonize. Despite the importance of leaf size to stem mothers, autumn migrants do not appear to take leaf size into consideration when choosing a tree to colonize.|$|E
25|$|Dispersal {{creates a}} {{relatively}} high mortality rate for <b>sugarbeet</b> root aphids. Additionally, alate aphids incur other disadvantages: if aphids fly then they may incur an additional cost in that their potential fecundity is further reduced {{and there is a}} further delay in the onset of reproduction. The combined effect is a marked reduction in reproductive potential and rate of increase. Although dispersal results in the colonization of suitable plants, it is not always clear what advantages there are in dispersing except from annual plants that are about to die. As dispersal can be costly in terms of fecundity or survival, or both, then <b>sugarbeet</b> root aphids are likely to delay departure until host quality falls below the average expectation for the habitat.|$|E
25|$|The <b>sugarbeet</b> root aphid {{is found}} {{throughout}} the major <b>sugarbeet</b> growing areas of North America, (in the Nearctic area) and has infested areas in Texas, California, Michigan, and Alberta, Canada; {{it has also been}} introduced in Europe. The aphid has been recorded at only a few sites in Europe, but the data on other species of aphids suggest that they can increase their range of occurrence, often quickly and in an invasive manner. Infestations are usually more severe under dry soil conditions, either due to dry years in dry land conditions in the upper Midwest of the United States, or to using less water in the irrigated areas of the West and Southwest United States. Infestations are usually the most severe during July and late August.|$|E

25|$|The {{fertilizer}} company Fisons {{took over}} the factory in 1929. Prentice's lighters were bought by A. V. Jackson in 1936, and Jacksons continued to carry fertilizer until 1948. Trade in <b>sugarbeet</b> continued until 1963. Production of fertilizer at the site ceased in 1962, and the brickworks, which made up to 10 million bricks a year, finally closed in 1971.|$|E
25|$|These {{individuals}} then {{suck the}} sap from the <b>sugarbeet</b> roots, which {{causes them to}} lose their color, wilt, and die. Infestation is apparent where they appear as circular patches in which plants and leaves are wilted and dying. During dry years when cracks form in the soil, the secondary host roots become much more accessible to the aphids, {{which can lead to}} severe yield loss.|$|E
25|$|The {{benefits}} of settling basally are significant, with basal stem mothers producing 49-65% more offspring than their distally settled counterparts. The {{benefits of}} settling basally {{relate to the}} aphid's ability to manipulate the plant's food resources. The galls formed by <b>sugarbeet</b> root aphids act as physiologic sinks, diverting and intercepting the plant's normal transport of resources and nutrients. 14C labeling experiments have shown that their galls intercept resources being transported from the midvein to the distal parts of the leaf. In addition, these galls are able to divert 14C from neighboring leaves. One study showed that, on average, 29% of the 14C accumulating inside a basal gall was supplied by a neighboring leaf and not the leaf the gall itself was on. In contrast, neighboring leaves only supplied 7% of a distal gall's 14C, illustrating the importance of settling basally.|$|E

25|$|North Dakota is {{the second}} leading {{producer}} of <b>sugarbeets,</b> which are grown mostly in the Red River Valley. The state is also the largest producer of honey, dry edible peas and beans, lentils, and the third-largest producer of potatoes.|$|R
40|$|Management {{practices}} {{which provide}} an adequate, but not excessive, supply of plant nutrients {{are essential for}} high yields of high quality <b>sugarbeets</b> in western Nebraska. This publication discusses the amounts of nitrogen, rainfall or irrigation, and applied fertilizer that are needed to produce sugar beets...|$|R
25|$|<b>Sugarbeet</b> root aphids {{are closely}} {{synchronized}} with their hosts Populus augustifolia, {{with the majority}} of stem mothers colonizing leaves within three days after the leaf buds burst. There is intense competition between Pemphigus stem mothers over leaf choice - galls formed on larger leaves have higher stem mother weight, more aphids overall, and a lower probability of being aborted. Moreover, galls formed closer to the leaf stem-and thus closer to the source of nutrients flowing into the leaf-also benefit in the same way. During the aphids' emergence in the spring, large Populus leaves are colonized first. Once a stem mother forms a gall, she is more reluctant to move to a new leaf even if the current one withers, though the ability to colonize a large, healthy leaf close to its stem is crucial in ensuring an aphid's reproductive success.|$|E
25|$|At {{the onset}} of autumn in {{temperate}} regions many species switch {{to the production of}} sexual forms, with each clone producing both egg-laying females and males. This switch is triggered by the longer nights in the autumn. Both sexual males and sexual females are produced parthenogenetically in response to external and/or internal cues, such as the amount of food present, the amount of daylight, {{and the quality of the}} leaf. However, <b>sugarbeet</b> root aphids are also capable of reproducing sexually. Aphids predominate in the temperate regions of the world; to overwinter in a cold-resistant resting stage, the fertilized egg, is an adaptation to temperate conditions. One possible short-term advantage of sex is that it generates siblings with a range of genotypes, and a range is more likely to include the fittest genotype for a particular patch than the single genotype of an asexual sibling-ship would. Thus, genetically diverse siblings could have more 'elbow-room' as they are potentially capable of exploiting more than one kind of leaf-patch.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sugarbeet</b> root aphid stem mothers induce gall {{formation}} in the leaf by probing the leaf tissue with their stylets. This leads {{to the formation of}} a small depression on the leaf, which eventually closes up over the stem mother and forms a gall. The extent of the probing activity dictates gall size, and removing the stem mother early on in the process leads to the formation of an unclosed, rudimentary gall. The extent of probing activity is correlated with the aphid's reproductive success. The probing activity may also serve a secondary purpose in helping the aphid determine leaf size. Leaf size {{is an important factor in}} determining what leaf a stem mother chooses to develop a gall on, but at the time of leaf colonization, leaves that are being colonized are only a tenth to a quarter of their mature size. It has been suggested that, during the probing of the leaf, the stem mother gauges the chemical environment of the leaf and uses that as a predictor of final leaf size and suitability as a gall site. Aphids possess chemosensory organs, allowing them to respond to a variety of stimuli from the plant, both those of the volatile variety (olfaction) and non-volatile variety (taste). Once the aphid is on a plant, it tests the surface of plant with its antennae and probes the plant with its mouth parts. The antennae contain many sensilla, allowing them to sense tactile and chemical stimuli.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in a greenhouse at Tucson, Arizona to determine the water••use efficiency of <b>sugarbeets,</b> when treated with soil-incorporated pyrazon and grown under a low and high soil-moisture regime. During the first two weeks, measurements were taken to determine if pyrazon had any significant effect on growth and development of <b>sugarbeets</b> from germination to the cotyledon stage. No significant differences were found among treatments for germination and emergence, but significant differences were found in survival of the seedlings among herbicide rates. Pyrazon did not significantly affect the water-use efficiency of sugarbeets; however, the quantity of soil moisture present was a significant factor in the water requirement of beets. The treatment with the best water-use efficiency for the total plant was the 1. 12 kg/ha rate of pyrazon under low soil-moisture. Plants receiving pyrazon treatments under low soil moisture transpired significantly less water than those receiving corresponding treatments under high soil-moisture; however, no significant difference was observed between controls for high and low soil-moisture. The 2. 24 kg/ha rate of pyrazon was the only treatment in which root and total dry weight were significantly higher under high soil-moisture than under low soil-moisture. Transpired water and dry weight production were correlated with top, root, and whole plant efficiency to determine if these factors significantly influence the water requirement of <b>sugarbeets...</b>|$|R

500|$|In the 1920s the <b>sugarbeet</b> {{growers in}} the western US {{suffered}} huge economic loss caused by damage done to their crops by the leafhopper-transmitted beet curly top virus. In 1956, between 25 and 50 per cent of the rice crop in Cuba and Venezuela was destroyed by rice hoja blanca virus. In 1958, it caused the loss of many rice fields in Colombia. Outbreaks recurred in 1981, which caused losses of up to 100 per cent. In Ghana between 1936 and 1977, the mealybug-transmitted cacao swollen-shoot virus caused the loss of 162 million cacao trees, and additional trees were lost {{at the rate of}} 15 million each year. In 1948, in Kansas, US, seven per cent of the wheat crop was destroyed by wheat streak mosaic virus, spread by the wheat curl mite [...] (Aceria tulipae). In the 1950s papaya ringspot virus – a potyvirus – caused a devastating loss of solo papaya crops on Oahu, Hawaii. Solo papaya had been introduced to the island in the previous century but the disease had not been seen on the island before the 1940s.|$|E
2500|$|The {{economic}} impact of <b>sugarbeet</b> root aphids on <b>sugarbeet</b> crops in southwestern Minnesota was studied during the 1990 and 1991 growing seasons. The effects of infestation on yield and quality of <b>sugarbeet</b> root showed that loss of [...] sucrose content in the plant was {{the primary reason for}} reduced quality. In addition, yield rates were significantly higher in 1991 due to higher levels of precipitation.|$|E
