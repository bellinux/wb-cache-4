We also perform asymptotic analysis of constrained and unconstrained MUSIC demonstrating that (asymptotically) improved subspace estimates always result from the use of constraints, and (asymptotically) the variance of constrained MUSIC is less than that of unconstrained MUSIC under either high coherence, large numbers of sensors, or high SNR conditions.

40|$|Abstract — Under the {{condition}} of low sample support, there is deviation between the estimated and true correlation matrices. In this case the full-rank Sample Matrix Inversion (SMI) beamformer is no longer optimal. Instead a low-rank adaptive beamformer could yield better performance. When extending {{from a couple of}} <b>signal</b> <b>directions</b> to the entire spatial spectrum, the output power is a more applicable touchstone than SINR, which is only defined for <b>signal</b> <b>directions.</b> Adaptive algorithms (CG/DMR), if operating at the best rank for each direction, could effectively reveal the spatial spectrum.

The main objective of the DOA estimation is to obtain the desired <b>signals</b> <b>direction</b> as well as the interference <b>signals</b> <b>direction</b> based on the data received from the array sensor at the base station. In literature various techniques are researched for DOA estimation. Among which are two high resolution algorithms, viz.

The key feature of EMD is to decompose a signal into sum of intrinsic mode functions (IMF) with a final residue of non linear and non stationary signals. The work presented in this paper deals with EMD application to the problem of DOA estimation as a preprocessing technique. This technique separately de-noises the rows of the array data matrix where each row corresponds to the output of a particular sensor array. Especially in low-SNR conditions, the estimation performance of MUSIC algorithm is enhanced significantly when de-noising is given to array data matrix prior to DOA estimation stage...|$|R

50|$|Electric fields {{found in}} aquatic environments range from local fields to {{large-scale}} uniform fields produced by ocean currents. For example, uniform electric fields might {{provide information on}} the orientation of field intensity and can give information about the voltage of the electric field through the velocity {{and direction of the}} ocean current. Electric fields produced locally by an animate source represent more of an electric field produced by a dipole, which can be represented by two point charges, a positive and a negative. The electric field in water generates an electric current which flows from positive to negative, along lines resembling a dipole field. A field produced by a fish changes according to distance. In a field far away, a dipole produced by a fish looks more like a dipole source. Higher magnitude order multipole fields may dominate closer to the fish, where the current does not converge on one point for the anterior pole but makes a perpendicular gradient over the length of the fish. A dipole contribution is more accurate in fields farther from the source because in three dimensions the dipole contribution to the electric field decreases due to the inverse third power of distance. In contrast, the contributions from quadrupole sources decrease due to the a source decreasing by an inverse fourth power of distance.When fish use their electroreceptive sense to detect the electric fields, it is different from other senses such as vision, auditory, and vibration senses. This {{is due to the fact}} that stimuli such as light and sound travel in vectors that are associated from the propagation of the wave, and the velocity vector points to the source of the signal. The signal produced by fish used in electroreception exist rather as an electrostatic field rather than propagating as waves due to the fact the frequencies of the fields are very low and only reach up to several kilohertz. Propagating electromagnetic waves would have a wavelength measured in kilometers at this low frequency. The electric fields produced by biological organisms like fish attenuate rapidly in aquatic environments and have a field magnitude around zero at ranges of a few meters at which fish detect these fields. Unlike sounds waves in hearing, there is no velocity vector to describe propagation, shadow cast by the receiver’s body, or temporal delay associated with propagation. The non-propagating electric field only gives curved paths about <b>signal</b> <b>direction,</b> but no information about delay times or a direct path to the source. Instead of using precise coding such as in hearing, it is important that the receptors are able to detect the low frequency electric fields by relying on spatial information of intensity, orientation, and polarity of the fields.|$|E
