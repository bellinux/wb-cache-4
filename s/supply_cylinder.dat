50|$|Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1805, Handyside {{worked in}} his uncle Charles Baird's {{engineering}} business in St. Petersburg before {{taking over the}} Brittania Foundry in 1848. It had first been opened around 1820 by Weatherhead and Glover to cast ornamental ironwork, and had achieved a high reputation, partly from the skill of the workers, {{but also because of}} the quality of the local moulding sand. By the 1840s it was diversifying into railway components. Among the early customers was the Midland Railway's Derby Works for which it <b>supplied</b> <b>cylinder</b> blocks and other castings.|$|R

50|$|If the {{breathing}} gas supply is depleted, the dose of fresh breathing gas decreases until {{the breathing}} supply is used up. The diver will notice the decreasing volume of gas available which signals {{the need to}} switch to an independent open-circuit bailout system, which is integrated into the rebreather mouthpiece as a bailout valve, or to connect another <b>supply</b> <b>cylinder</b> to the rebrether.Water which leaks into, or accumulates in the breathing loop drains into the inner bellows from which it is automatically discharged into the environment along with the discharged air when the inner bellows is emptied during each inhalation.|$|E
5000|$|An example {{could be}} a 100-litre (internal volume) {{cylinder}} (V1) pressurised to 200 bar (P1) filling a 10-litre (internal volume) cylinder (V2) which was unpressurised (P2 = 1 bar) (resulting in both cylinder equalising to approximately 180 bar (P3). If another 100 litre cylinder pressurised this time to 250 bar were then used to [...] "top-up" [...] the 10 litre cylinder, both of these cylinders would equalise to about 240 bar. However, if the higher pressure 100 litre cylinder were used first, the 10 litre cylinder would equalise to about 225 bar and the lower pressure 100 litre cylinder {{could not be used}} to top it up. In a cascade storage system, several large cylinders are used to bring a small cylinder up to a desired pressure, by always using the <b>supply</b> <b>cylinder</b> with the lowest usable pressure first, then the cylinder with the next lowest pressure, and so on.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: By using {{numerical}} simulation method,the {{three-dimensional flow field}} of air <b>supply</b> <b>cylinder</b> using for displacement ventilation in industrial plant is analyzed. The internal structure, effective wind sent area and the shape of wind outlet small hole which affected the air outlet wind speed of air <b>supply</b> <b>cylinder</b> are researched. While compared with the simulated and measured result of the outlet velocity of the wind outlet small hole, the best feature parameters of wind speed in air <b>supply</b> <b>cylinder</b> has been gained. The result shows that: by changing the internal structure and decreasing the effective air supply area of the air <b>supply</b> <b>cylinder,</b> the wind speed from the air-outlet on the small hole can be more reasonably distributed; although by increasing the effective air supply area and changing the shape of outlet hole on air <b>supply</b> <b>cylinder</b> will make the air outlet be more effectively distributed, its value is unreasonable. Foreword In the 1970 s, as an emerging technology, the displacement ventilation was used in industrial workshop in order to solve the ventilation problem in the industrial plants. In recent years, displacement ventilation has been vigorously promoted in the industrial and civil buildings due to its good ventilation performance. According to statistics, in the 1980 s, displacement ventilation syste...|$|E

25|$|Ford {{was asked}} to <b>supply</b> <b>cylinders</b> for the new engine and rapidly {{developed}} an improved technique for cutting and pressing steel, which resulted in cylinder production rising from 151 per day to over 2,000; the company eventually manufactured all 433,826 cylinders produced, as well as 3,950 complete engines. Lincoln constructed a new plant in record time, devoted entirely to Liberty engine production, and assembled 2,000 engines in 12 months. By {{the time of the}} Armistice with Germany, the various companies had produced 13,574 Liberty engines, attaining a production rate of 150 engines per day.

50|$|Big Bertha's {{cylinder}} arrangement was unusual. There were four cylinders {{but only two}} sets of piston valves because there was insufficient space under the smokebox to fit piston valves for the inside cylinders. Instead, the large outside piston valves (as well as <b>supplying</b> the outside <b>cylinders)</b> <b>supplied</b> the inside <b>cylinders</b> through cross-over steam ports. The steam-flow characteristics would have been poor (because {{of the length of}} the ports) but this would not have mattered unduly in an engine that ran only at slow speed. It has been suggested that this design has been influenced by the four-cylinder cross-ported arrangement of the Italian 0-10-0 FS Class 470 heavy freight locomotive (in which this was motivated by its being part of an asymmetrical compound design), of which a complete set of drawings were stored at Derby.|$|R

30|$|Conclusions Transport {{ventilators}} {{differ in}} accuracy of delivering tidal volume demonstrating better performance in turbine equipped models. Oxygen <b>supply</b> by <b>cylinder</b> was of limited influence in two gas-driven ventilators only. Two of three turbine equipped transport ventilators (Hamilton C 1 & C 2) tested showed accuracy comparable to ICU ventilators and therefore {{are suitable for}} critical care transport. The use of many gas-driven ventilators in critical care transport should be questioned considering their inaccurate performance.|$|R
