6000|$|A little after, I {{observed}} a worm upon the ground, and told, in a whisper, that its touch was death. Presently a great green serpent, vivid as {{the grass in}} <b>spring,</b> <b>wound</b> rapidly across the path; and once again I paused {{and looked back at}} my companion, with a horror in my eyes. ‘The coffin snake,’ said I, ‘the snake that dogs its victim like a hound.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|Soon {{sprang up}} {{a grove of}} graceful palm-trees, with their tall thin stems, and bending {{feathery}} crowns, languid and beautiful. Around, the verdant sod gleamed like an emerald: silver streams, flowing from a bubbling parent <b>spring,</b> <b>wound</b> their white forms within the bright green turf. From the grove arose the softening song of doves, and showers of gay and sparkling butterflies, borne on their tinted wings of shifting light, danced without danger in the liquid air. A fair and fresh Oasis! ...|$|E

50|$|The 2011 USA Pro Cycling Challenge was {{the inaugural}} {{edition of the}} USA Pro Cycling Challenge stage race. The race was held from August 22-28, and was rated as a 2.1 event on the UCI America Tour. The race began with a short prologue time trial in Colorado <b>Springs,</b> <b>wound</b> {{its way through the}} Rocky Mountains at heights of up to 12,000 ft, and {{finished}} in the streets of downtown Denver.|$|R
50|$|The {{valve springs}} used on LeBlond's and Ken-Royce engines {{are of the}} volute spring type which is wound in a beehive shape out of strip steel. Unlike most engines, which have nested coil <b>springs</b> <b>wound</b> from round wire. This type of spring was {{inherited}} from the original Detroit Air-Cat as {{at the time of}} the Air-Cat design in the late twenties, round wire springs had resonance and fatigue problems. The volute design eliminated the resonance and lasted longer.|$|R
5000|$|A stop watch, either <b>spring</b> <b>wound</b> or digital, {{may also}} be used for {{celestial}} observations. [...] In this case, the watch is started at a known GMT by chronometer, and the elapsed time of each sight added to this to obtain GMT of the sight.|$|E
50|$|By 1910, Electric Heating Regulator Company {{employed}} 12 men. Two {{types of}} motors wereassembled: the original <b>spring</b> <b>wound</b> motor, which required periodical winding, and a newer gravity type motor, which used an iron weight for power. In {{addition to the}} motors, the company assembled thermostats from parts purchased from the Standard Thermostat Company of Boston.|$|E
50|$|M.H. Rhodes Inc. of Hartford, Connecticut {{started making}} meters for Mark-Time Parking Meter Company of Miami, {{where the first}} Rhodes meters were {{installed}} in 1936. These were different from the Magee design because only the driver's action of turning a handle was necessary to keep the <b>spring</b> <b>wound,</b> while Magee's meters needed a serviceman to wind the spring occasionally.|$|E

I saw the tiger bound through the window, and heard screams, and stood frozen with horror. I did not even see my lord cut through the net. I knew nothing, until he seized me by the arm and pulled me after him; and it was not until he sprang upon my back, and then upon my shoulders, that I knew what he was going to do. I simply aided in {{despatching}} the tiger when he <b>sprang,</b> <b>wounded,</b> down into the courtyard." ...|$|R
50|$|As {{pointed out}} by George Daniels, it is {{possible}} to jam the escapement when the main <b>spring</b> is <b>wound</b> down and Breguet introduced spring loading of the detent in the later versions of this escapement so that such jamming would not damage the escapement.|$|R
5000|$|The Manville gun was a stockless, semi-automatic, {{revolver}} type gun, {{introduced in}} 1935 by Charles J. Manville.

The discs can also be played on many antique music boxes bearing the Polyphon and Regina brand names.|$|E
50|$|Westclox Scotland {{produced}} {{its first}} clock on 21 September 1948; a <b>spring</b> <b>wound</b> alarm with a 4-foot dial. Their Scottish factory {{was a full}} manufacturing plant, at which all their clocks were assembled {{from start to finish}} with only the basic raw materials being brought in by outside suppliers. 95% of the staff were local people and the firm trained their employees from scratch to a high level of skill and had an annual apprenticeship for toolmakers and classes in horology.|$|E
50|$|A Spring Starter uses {{potential}} energy {{stored in a}} <b>spring</b> <b>wound</b> up with a crank to start an engine without a battery or alternator. Turning the crank moves the pinion into mesh with the engine’s ring gear, then winds up the spring. Pulling the release lever then applies the spring tension to the pinion, turning the ring gear to start the engine. The pinion automatically disengages from the flywheel after operation. Provision is also made to allow the engine to be slowly turned over by hand for engine maintenance. This is achieved by operating the trip lever just after the pinion has engaged with the flywheel. Subsequent turning of the winding handle during this operation will not load the starter. Spring starters {{can be found in}} engine-generators, hydraulic power packs, and on lifeboat engines, with the most common application being backup starting system on seagoing vessels.|$|E
5000|$|Motor or safety barrel: used in pocketwatches around 1900, {{a reverse}} {{variant of the}} going barrel in which the <b>spring</b> is <b>wound</b> by turning the barrel, and turns the watch {{movement}} by the central arbor. The purpose of this arrangement was that if the spring breaks, destructive recoil forces would not {{be applied to the}} vulnerable gear train.|$|R
50|$|The MM-1 is a revolver-type weapon, {{with the}} heavy {{cylinder}} being rotated for each shot by the clockwork-type spring. The <b>spring</b> is <b>wound</b> manually during the reloading. To reload the cylinder, the rear part of the gun is released and rotated sideways to expose {{the rear of the}} cylinder, which is connected to the front part of the frame and barrel.|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  2 c, the center {{part of the}} torsion <b>spring</b> is <b>wound</b> twice with a center {{diameter}} of 2.5  mm. While the left end of the torsion <b>spring</b> is <b>wound</b> once with a diameter of 1  mm, the right end is straight. The 4 -mm-long right side is inserted into a hollow aluminum tube and bonded with epoxy. The 11 -mm-long left side is bonded with a carbon rod and the ring at the left end is connected with a string, the length of which controls the bending angle of the torsion spring. The angle between {{the left and right}} sides is designed to be 150 °. The surfaces of the carbon rods are hydrophobically modified as shown in Fig.  2 d. In order to investigate the change of the forces and impulses according to the rod length, four different rod lengths were designed: 2, 4, 6 and 8  cm.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{experimental}} setup and an associated mathematical model {{to study the}} synchronization of two self sustained strongly coupled mechanical oscillators (metronomes). The effects of a small detuning in the internal parameters, namely damping and frequency, have been studied. Our experimental system {{is a pair of}} <b>spring</b> <b>wound</b> mechanical metronomes, coupled by placing them on a common base, free to move along a horizontal direction. In our system the mass of the oscillating pendula form a significant fraction of the total mass of the system, leading to strong coupling of the oscillators. We modified the internal mechanism of the spring-wound "clockwork" slightly, such that the natural frequency and the internal damping could be independently tuned. Stable synchronized and anti-synchronized states were observed as the difference in the parameters was varied. We designed a photodiode array based non-contact, non-magnetic position detection system driven by a microcontroller to record the instantaneous angular displacement of each oscillator and the small linear displacement of the base coupling the two. Our results indicate that such a system can be made to stabilize in both in-phase anti-phase synchronized state by tuning the parameter mismatch. Results from both numerical simulations and experimental observations are in qualitative agreement and are both reported in the present work. Comment: 9 pages, 12 figure...|$|E

The simulation results showed a rapid increase in the phase difference between the two oscillators beyond a certain threshold of parameter mismatch. Our simple model of the escapement mechanism did not reproduce a complete 180 degrees out of phase state. However, the numerical simulations show that increased mismatch in parameters leads to a synchronized state with a large phase difference. Published by AIP Publishing...|$|E

40|$|A constant-force {{resistive}} exercise unit (CFREU) has been invented {{for use in}} both normal gravitational and microgravitational environments. In comparison with a typical conventional exercise machine, this CFREU weighs less and is less bulky: Whereas weight plates and associated bulky supporting structures are used to generate resistive forces in typical conventional exercise machines, they are not used in this CFREU. Instead, resistive forces are generated in this CFREU by relatively compact, lightweight mechanisms based on constant-torque <b>springs</b> <b>wound</b> on drums. Each such mechanism is contained in a module, denoted a resistive pack, that includes a shaft for making a torque connection to a cable drum. During a stroke of {{resistive exercise}}, the cable is withdrawn from the cable drum against the torque exerted by the resistance pack. The CFREU includes a housing, within which can be mounted one or more resistive pack(s). The CFREU also includes mechanisms for engaging any combination of (1) one or more resistive pack(s) and (2) one or more spring(s) within each resistive pack to obtain a desired level of resistance...|$|R
