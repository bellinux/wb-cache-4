5|$|In {{spite of}} good {{critical}} reception, the film {{did not perform}} very well at the box office, with only about 35,000 tickets sold domestically. Hamer expressed some disappointment with this, while hoping that the DVD-release would fare better. Internationally, the film did <b>somewhat</b> <b>better,</b> and was sold to forty countries. By early August 2009, the film had in fact been seen by {{more people in the}} United States than in Norway.|$|E
5|$|In late 1835, Davis sailed from New Orleans to Havana, Cuba, to {{help restore}} his health. He was {{accompanied}} by James Pemberton, his only slave at that time. Davis observed the Spanish military and sketched fortifications. Although no evidence points to his having any motive beyond general interest, the authorities knew that Davis was a former army officer and warned him to stop his observations. Bored and feeling <b>somewhat</b> <b>better,</b> Davis booked passage on a ship to New York, then continued to Washington, D.C., where he visited his old schoolmate George Wallace Jones. He soon returned with Pemberton to Mississippi.|$|E
5|$|Morrowind also {{contained}} a fair bit of voiced dialogue; an aspect <b>somewhat</b> <b>better</b> {{received by the}} gaming press. Of note is Lynda Carter, television's Wonder Woman, promoted by Bethesda {{for her role in}} voicing the female Nords in the game. Morrowinds race-specific voice acting received praise from some reviewers, though was met with disdain from others, who disliked the discord between a culturally inflected voice spoken in an alien dialect and the grammatically flawless dialogue printed in the dialogue boxes. The Special Edition Soundtrack was released over DirectSong as a digital release.|$|E
6000|$|Dick Shelton {{took the}} paper {{in his hand and}} read it aloud. It {{contained}} some lines of a very rugged doggerel, hardly even rhyming, written in a gross character, and most uncouthly spelt. With the spelling <b>somewhat</b> <b>bettered,</b> this is how they ran:-- ...|$|R

"As {{well as a}} poor {{wanderer}} in {{a strange}} and very damp country can be, Don Peter," [...] she answered in her languorous voice, [...] "and certainly <b>somewhat</b> the <b>better</b> for seeing an old friend whom last she met in a certain baker's shop. Do you remember?" ...|$|R
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} rather quickly as {{a sequel to}} the Nintendo 64 title Hey You, Pikachu! and to promote the Nintendo e-Reader accessory, and uses a novel 3D texturing effect. It was first showcased at Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2003 and later through a month-long series of promotional events in Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan. It was released on July 18, 2003, in Japan, December 1 in North America, and April 2, 2004, in Europe. In Japan, the game sold 66,373 copies in its first year. It received mixed reviews, which generally criticized its low level of interactivity and repetitive sound effects, though its collecting aspects and visuals were <b>somewhat</b> <b>better</b> received.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} the Indian Ocean, the convoy sailed south-east. The ships manoeuvred {{together in a}} zigzag course; avoiding collisions during the frequent turns placed heavy demands on the watch-keeping officers, who found their shifts exhausting. The troops endured very uncomfortable conditions on the hot and crowded ships, but morale was high. They entertained themselves with sports, sun baking and gambling, and those on Queen Mary could attend concerts performed by a regimental brass band. The 9th Division's officers enjoyed <b>somewhat</b> <b>better</b> conditions, which frustrated {{some of the other}} ranks. The 9th Division's preparations for jungle warfare continued during the voyage, with all personnel attending daily lectures delivered by officers on the lessons learnt during the previous fighting in the Pacific.|$|E
5|$|Beginning around 1 pm, Union {{artillery}} fired first, initially upon infantry in the woods, {{and later}} upon any Confederate artillery that attempted {{to move into}} firing position. On the Confederate left flank, two batteries from Whiting's division and one from Jackson's soon began firing from their position upon Darius Couch's division of the IV Corps, who were {{near the center of}} the Union line. This began a fierce firefight, with the Union's eight batteries and 37 guns concentrated against three Confederate batteries and sixteen guns. The Union fire silenced the Rowan Artillery and made their position untenable. The other two Confederate batteries, placed by Jackson himself, were in <b>somewhat</b> <b>better</b> positions, and managed to keep firing. Over a period of more than three hours, a total of six or eight Confederate batteries engaged the Union Army from the Confederate left flank, but they were usually engaged only one at a time.|$|E
50|$|The {{screen in}} Geneforge 4 is {{considerably}} larger, with a bigger map, and smaller icons, leaving much {{more room for}} viewing. The graphics were improved <b>somewhat,</b> with <b>better</b> animations and cut-scenes than the previous three games. The sounds and general flow of the game were still the same.|$|R
2500|$|In {{comparison}} to the preceding Williams FW29 car, Williams Technical Director Sam Michael described {{the aim of the}} FW30's construction as being [...] "refining our package and weight distribution" [...] rather than being a radical redesign. Although not confirmed by Williams, weight distribution was likely moved forward <b>somewhat,</b> to <b>better</b> utilise the traction characteristics of the single-supply Bridgestone tyres.|$|R

5|$|Many of Coffin's {{theories}} and principles {{can be seen}} in practice in her most famous creation, Harry and Ruth du Pont's gardens at their Winterthur estate. Her work on the gardens began in 1929 and became the biggest commission of her career. It was very fortuitously timed for her, as the Wall Street Crash of 1929 wiped out the fortunes of many of her clients and brought to an end the era of commissioning elaborate gardens for large country estates. Coffin had <b>somewhat</b> <b>better</b> luck with her investments and the enormous fortune of the du Ponts insulated the family from the worst of the Great Depression, permitting work on Winterthur to continue throughout the downturn. With the money from her investments and the fees from the du Ponts for the Winterthur commission, Coffin was able to maintain two homes, a maid and a chauffeur despite the general economic decline.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{original}} negotiations between Louis and Manuel I, Manuel had broken off his military {{campaign against the}} Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm, signing a truce with his enemy Sultan Mesud I. This was done so that Manuel {{would be free to}} concentrate on defending his empire from the Crusaders, who had gained a reputation for theft and treachery since the First Crusade and were widely suspected of harbouring sinister designs on Constantinople. Nevertheless, Manuel's relations with the French army were <b>somewhat</b> <b>better</b> than with the Germans, and Louis was entertained lavishly in Constantinople. Some of the French were outraged by Manuel's truce with the Seljuqs and called for an alliance with Roger II and an attack on Constantinople, but they were restrained by Louis.|$|E
5|$|The Sonderkommado were housed {{separately}} from other prisoners, in <b>somewhat</b> <b>better</b> conditions. Their {{quality of life}} was further improved by access to the goods taken from murdered prisoners, which Sonderkommandos were sometimes able to steal for themselves and to trade on Auschwitz's black market. Hungarian doctor Miklós Nyiszli reported that the Sonderkommando numbered around 860 prisoners when the Hungarian Jews were being killed in 1944. Many Sonderkommandos committed suicide due to the horrors of their work; {{those who did not}} generally were shot by the SS in a matter of weeks, and new Sonderkommando units were then formed from incoming transports. Almost none of the 2,000 prisoners placed in these units survived to the camp's liberation.|$|E
50|$|On 1 February 1943 the {{remnants}} of the corps reached Axis lines. The Cuneense and Julia had been annihilated: the Cuneense counted 1,607 survivors out of 17,460 men deployed, the Julia counted less than 1200 survivors of 17,460 men deployed. The Tridentina was <b>somewhat</b> in <b>better</b> shape having managed to bring 4,250 men through the Russian lines. The worst hit unit was the 2nd Alpini Regiment which saw 208 men survive out of 5,206 deployed.|$|R
40|$|The Cachazo-He-Yuan (CHY) {{formula for}} on-shell {{scattering}} amplitudes are extended off-shell. The off-shell amplitudes are Möbius invariant, {{and have the}} same momentum poles as the on-shell amplitudes.

40|$|We interviewed 308 {{survivors}} of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and matched controls {{who had suffered}} a myocardial infarction. The Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) scores of controls were <b>somewhat</b> lower (<b>better)</b> than those of cases, but responses of cases and controls to additional questions about stair climbing, irritability and mood were virtually identical. Half as many (18 per cent) controls as cases (38 per cent) reported poorer memory function; nevertheless, 63 per cent of cases and 79 per cent of controls {{who had been working}} outside the home {{at the time of the}} event were employed at the time of the interview...|$|R
5|$|Wulfred (died 24 March 832) was an Anglo-Saxon Archbishop of Canterbury {{in medieval}} England. Nothing {{is known of}} his life prior to 803, when he {{attended}} a church council, but he was probably a nobleman from Middlesex. He was elected archbishop in 805 and spent his time in office reforming the clergy of his cathedral. He also quarrelled with two consecutive Mercian kings– Coenwulf and Ceolwulf– over whether laymen or clergy should control monasteries. At one point, Wulfred travelled to Rome to consult with the papacy and was deposed from office {{for a number of}} years over the issue. After Coenwulf's death, relations were <b>somewhat</b> <b>better</b> with the new king Ceolwulf, but improved much more after Ceolwulf's subsequent deposition. The dispute about control of the monasteries was not fully settled until 838, after Wulfred's death. Wulfred was the first archbishop to place his portrait on the coinage he struck.|$|E
5|$|On October 16, Colonel Joseph R. Russ of the US 32nd Infantry Regiment {{took over}} the {{operational}} command from Moses. He was also given the 2nd Battalion of the US 17th Infantry Regiment to reinforce his right wing. After arriving on the battlefield, the US 2nd Battalion managed to wrestle Jane Russell Hill away from the Chinese on October 16, but the Americans soon {{came under heavy fire}} from Chinese machine guns in the valley below, and were forced to withdraw to the slope behind the hill on October 18. The Chinese continued to harass the American positions with small raiding parties and grenade barrages throughout that night. The Koreans fared <b>somewhat</b> <b>better.</b> A joint attack by 2nd Battalion of the ROK 17th Regiment and the 2nd Battalion of the ROK 32nd Regiment captured Sniper Ridge and held it against subsequent Chinese counterattacks. For {{the first time since the}} combat began, UN forces had gained firm control of the surface, with the exception of Pike's Peak. On the afternoon of October 17, the 3rd Battalion of the US 17th Infantry Regiment relieved the 2nd Battalion of the US 31st Infantry Regiment on the left wing, while the 1st Battalion of the US 32nd Infantry Regiment was withdrawn from the pacified center.|$|E

60|$|Dave and Roger {{had passed}} {{into one of}} the deserted log houses, and the country youth struck a match, that they might see around a little <b>better.</b> <b>Somewhat</b> to their astonishment, they saw pinned up on a wall a sheet of water-stained brown {{wrapping}} paper, upon which was drawn something of a map, with a heavy cross where two lines met.|$|R
60|$|Then he drew, and we fell to it desperately enough, {{till the}} sparks flew, indeed, and {{the rattle of}} steel upon steel rang down the quiet street. At first he had <b>somewhat</b> the <b>better</b> of me, for my hate made me wild in my play, but soon I settled to the work and grew cooler. I meant to kill him--more, I knew that I should kill him if none came between us. He was still a better swordsman than I, who, till I fought {{with him in the}} lane at Ditchingham, had never even seen one of these Spanish rapiers, but I had the youth and the right on my side, as also I had an eye like a hawk's and a wrist of steel.|$|R
5000|$|Scott Foundas of Variety {{said the}} {{documentary}} was [...] "insightful, if <b>somewhat</b> foreshortened", finding <b>better</b> the [...] "work in progress" [...] version shared in 2002 that was 26 minutes longer. Foundas said, [...] "While this re-edit is {{an improvement over}} the original in other respects — the cutting is more fluid, the narration has been re-recorded and the archival material... has been three-dimensionally embossed... it seems, overall, a more timid, less confrontational movie." ...|$|R
25|$|Protestant {{middle schools}} fared <b>somewhat</b> <b>better,</b> {{led by the}} well {{regarded}} gymnasiums in Danzig and Thorn. There were accomplished Polish Protestant schools in Silesia, led by the Pietist school in Teschen and the municipal school in Breslau.|$|E
25|$|The DC {{coefficients}} {{when taken}} together resemble a downscale {{version of the}} original image multiplied by a scaling factor.

25|$|Lukyanenko, though, fared <b>somewhat</b> <b>better</b> {{than the}} others, already having made {{something}} of a name in Russian science fiction circles. Nascent computer networks (mainly FidoNet), distributing electronic copies of his works, also helped to create demand for printed versions. Another contribution was his writing style, combining intricate but captivating plots with deep intrigue and concentrated action.|$|E
25|$|The {{diamond-shaped}} False Cross {{is composed}} of the four stars Delta and Kappa Velorum (δ and κ Vel) and Epsilon and Iota Carinae (ε and ι Car).

25|$|With two of {{its three}} {{pathfinder}} teams operating their radio beacons to mark the drop zones, the British 2nd Brigade did <b>somewhat</b> <b>better.</b> From about 04:50, half of the 4th Battalion, one company of the 5th Battalion, {{and most of the}} 6th Battalion, totaling two-thirds of the brigade, landed in their drop zone.

25|$|A study {{investigating}} {{sensory integration}} {{within a single}} modality (vision) found that it cannot be established until age 12 and above. This particular study assessed the integration of disparity and texture cues to resolve surface slant. Though younger age groups showed a <b>somewhat</b> <b>better</b> performance when combining disparity and texture cues compared to using only disparity or texture cues, this difference was not statistically significant. In adults, the sensory integration can be mandatory, meaning {{that they no longer}} have access to the individual sensory sources.|$|E
