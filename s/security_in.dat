5|$|Aqil {{secured a}} durable {{alliance}} with the Beni Sakhr, consecrated through his marriage to a woman from the tribe. From Transjordan, he and his band of irregulars raided areas {{on both sides of}} the Jordan River until he was invited back to the Galilee by Acre's kaimakam in 1847. The latter had sought to neutralize Aqil and his allies' marauding activities, and thus pardoned Aqil. He was also given command of 75 bashi-bazouk in Lower Galilee. Thereafter, he was commissioned with overseeing that region's <b>security.</b> <b>In</b> particular, the successive governors of Acre entrusted him with protecting the Galilee's trade routes and maintaining general <b>security</b> <b>in</b> the area, which he did successfully. With time, he became an unofficial mutasallim (tax collector) for much of northern Palestine, including the Jezreel Valley, Safad, Tiberias and Nazareth. The tax he collected was not on behalf of the authorities, but rather a tribute payment (khuwwa) to receive his protection. While this unofficial system proved successful in guaranteeing local security, later historians criticized it as akin to a protection racket.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Aqil's escape, the Ottomans were engaged in the Crimean War with the Russian Empire, which left a {{domestic}} security void in its provinces due to {{the large number of}} provincial troops deployed to Crimea.

On his return to Palestine, Aqil's Hanadi tribesmen abandoned their conscription orders to serve with the Ottoman Army in the Crimean War and instead returned to Aqil's service. Aqil was once again charged with protecting the routes of rural Palestine and occasionally Transjordan. He was once commissioned to collect taxes from Karak.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} measures {{of original sin}} in economics literature. These measures are defined mathematically as one minus the fraction of own currency-denominated <b>securities</b> <b>in</b> the relevant total. Original sin measures range between 0 and 1. A high measure of original sin indicates that a country suffers from high level of original sin. Thus, a country that issues all of its <b>securities</b> <b>in</b> foreign currency would have an original sin measure of one, while a country that issues all of its <b>securities</b> <b>in</b> its domestic currency would have an original sin measure of zero.|$|R

5|$|In {{assessing}} peacefulness, the GPI {{investigates the}} extent to which countries are involved in ongoing domestic and international conflicts. It also seeks to evaluate the level of harmony or discord within a nation; ten indicators broadly assess what might be described as a safety and <b>security</b> <b>in</b> society. The assertion is that low crime rates, minimal incidences of terrorist acts and violent demonstrations, harmonious relations with neighboring countries, a stable political scene and a small proportion of the population being internally displaced or refugees can be equated with peacefulness.|$|E
5|$|In the 1890s {{some people}} – {{including}} the young Calogero Vizzini – {{decided to do}} something about the absence of peace and <b>security</b> <b>in</b> the countryside. The state police at the time was as much a danger as the brigands. The Villalba Mafia thus emerged as an alternative social regime centred on the membership in church-sponsored associations that generated considerable social capital.

In March 2006, Denise Abreu took over the management of air services of the newly established National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC). The investigation of the accident with the Airbus TAM, which killed 199 people in Congonhas, revealed that in February 2007, the São Paulo federal judge Cecilia Marcondes, who saw action restricting the landing planes in Congonhas on rainy days, received Denise Abreu one of ANAC document like a standard, but it was only a technical study. According to the complaint, the study presented as standard guarantee, in theory, <b>security</b> <b>in</b> landing operations at Congonhas airport in São Paulo. The study indicated that takeoffs and landings were forbidden in Congonhas case the track was with a water depth greater than 3mm. After the accident with the plane of TAM in July 2007 it revealed that the study was not a standard and thus there was no obligation to follow it. According to the testimony of federal judge Cecilia Marcondes to the Federal Public Ministry, the document was fundamental to the Federal Court to release the runway for takeoffs and landings of all equipment.|$|E
