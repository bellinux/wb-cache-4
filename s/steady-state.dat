40|$|Abstract: Analysis {{and safety}} {{considerations}} {{of chemical and}} biological processes frequently require an outer approximation of the set of all feasible <b>steady-states.</b> Nonlinearities, uncertain parameters, and discrete variables complicate the calculation of guaranteed outer bounds. In this paper, the problem of outer-approximating the region of feasible <b>steady-states,</b> for processes described by uncertain nonlinear differential algebraic equations including discrete variables and discrete changes in the dynamics, is adressed. The calculation of the outer bounding sets {{is based on a}} relaxed version of the corresponding feasibility problem. It uses the Lagrange dual problem to obtain certificates for regions in state space not containing <b>steady-states.</b> These infeasibility certificates can be computed efficiently by solving a semidefinite program, rendering the calculation of the outer bounding set computationally feasible. The derived method guarantees globally valid outer bounds for the <b>steady-states</b> of nonlinear processes described by differential equations. It allows to consider discrete variables, as well as switching system dynamics. The method is exemplified by the analysis of a simple chemical reactor showing parametric uncertainties and large variability due to the appearance of bifurcations characterising the ignition and extinction of a reaction.

We compute all $L$-periodic <b>steady-states</b> of that system, define an associated energy functional, and these <b>steady-states</b> share a quantification property in the sense that their energy can only take some precise discrete values.

40|$|A heat {{integrated}} {{distillation column}} (HIDiC) {{is a new}} and highly energy-efficient distillation process. In the present work, multiple <b>steady-states</b> in HIDiC are analyzed. In HIDiC, the pressure in the rectifying section is kept higher than that in the stripping section by using a compressor to enhance heat transfer from the rectifying section to the stripping section through the wall. Therefore, an energy balance, particularly {{the influence of the}} compressor, {{must be taken into account}} for the analysis. In this research, two types of operation policies are investigated: P 1) constant compressor power and P 2) constant pressure ratio. First, the conditions for making multiple <b>steady-states</b> are derived on the basis of the first principle model of the HIDiC. Then, the analysis results are validated through simulations. The results show that: 1) the instability condition depends largely on the compressor operation policies; 2) in case P 1, multiple <b>steady-states</b> appear when the top product is highly pure, the bottom product is relatively impure, vapor flow rate is large, and compressor power is small; 3) in case P 2, multiple <b>steady-states</b> appear when the bottom product is highly pure; and 4) multiple <b>steady-states</b> appear in a wider range of operation in case P 2 than in case P 1...|$|R
5|$|It {{can also}} be seen however that this simple 2-dimensional model, {{essentially}} an inverted pendulum on a turntable, predicts that the <b>steady-state</b> turn is unstable. If the bike is displaced slightly downwards from its equilibrium lean angle, the torque of gravity increases, that of centrifugal force decreases and the displacement gets amplified. A more-sophisticated model that allows a wheel to steer, adjust the path, and counter the torque of gravity, is necessary to capture the self-stability observed in real bikes.|$|E
