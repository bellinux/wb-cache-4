500|$|Executive {{producer}} Frank Spotnitz {{noted that}} the episode bore stylistic similarities to [...] "Paper Hearts". However, unlike the episode, [...] "Sein und Zeit", and its second part [...] "Closure", sets out to actually {{answer the question of}} Samantha's disappearance. Spotnitz later explained, [...] "it's similar [...] in the sense that what you always thought happened to Samantha may not have actually happened. 'Paper Hearts' never ultimately answers the question. We've had people come up to us and say, 'Okay, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> she's really dead, so what happened?' So we decided in this one to answer the question." [...] The episode's title, Sein und Zeit, is a reference to Martin Heidegger's best known work and means [...] "Being and Time" [...] in German.|$|E

500|$|While the [...] "Egyptian Alphabet and Grammar" [...] only {{contains}} an explicit correlation between Egyptian characters and their purported English translation for –, the document itself {{suggests that the}} hieroglyphs from the Small Sensen papyrus were used to translate much of the Book of Abraham.

500|$|When Vaughan first pitched [...] "Pride & Joy" [...] to Marvel, they {{immediately}} accepted it and set Runaways in the Marvel Universe, the main string of story lines that ties Marvel's canonical series. However, unlike most series (which are often set in New York City), Runaways {{is set in}} Los Angeles, an unexplored area of the Marvel Universe. This, in turn, marked a significance for the story arc at the time; being a new series, [...] "Pride & Joy" [...] had been expected {{to take place in}} New York City. Matt Fraction, a prominent writer for various Marvel Comics series quotes, [...] "It was sort of great to see in Runaways that California was such a blank slate. It was refreshing to watch Brian create this sort of whole cloth." [...] Vaughan's decision prompted Fraction to create a new series to take place in Los Angeles as well. Several notable landmarks in this story arc include Malibu, the Griffith Observatory, the James Dean memorial and Bronson Canyon in Griffith Park. In an interview with Comic Book Resources, Brian K. Vaughan quoted, [...] "I imagine that Angelinos in the Marvel Universe think of super heroes and villains the way that New Yorkers think of Hollywood celebrities. We see them on TV every day, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> that they exist, but they still seem distant and unreal." ...|$|E

2500|$|Since the game's {{unveiling}} {{there have}} been multiple leaks revealing content featured within Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes, primarily from stores marketing the game. Target inattentively leaked the release date of the game, September 23, 2014, in a flyer. Venom was also leaked by the flyer, as the character had never been revealed prior. Walmart later leaked that multiple characters including the Guardians of the Galaxy would be playable in the game. Walmart did so by listing multiple characters, Playset packs and Starter Packs on their website. Another image was leaked, showcasing Star-Lord and Gamora figures. On the leaks, Vignocchi stated [...] "Yeah, this year we definitely had a challenge with retail – putting out the sku plans and having those accessible by managers prior to announcements.

2500|$|Director Gareth Edwards {{has said}} that he [...] "intentionally placed humans in shots to give the scene a sense of scale, as {{everyone}} knows the size of a human, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> the size of a creature or a building."

We would say [...] "Imagine it was a news story, or a sports event, cameramen would put cameras where they could in a hurry, and get any shot they could." [...] This is what we wanted [...] to feel like, as if people were filming glimpses at any chance they could." [...] He also found himself [...] "Doing things [...] think are cliche; panning up just as a roar happens, or getting the perfect shot, things I shake my head at when watching other people's films.

2500|$|Steven Moffat {{has said}} that {{reference}} {{will be made to}} Peter Capaldi's previous appearances in the Whoniverse during his tenure as the Twelfth Doctor: [...] "The face is not set from birth. It’s not like he was always going to be one day Peter Capaldi. We know that’s the case because in The War Games he has a choice of faces. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> it’s not set, so where does he get those faces from? They can’t just be randomly generated because they've got lines. They've aged. When he turns into Peter he’ll actually have lines on his face. So where did that face come from?” In [...] "Deep Breath" [...] (2014), the Doctor and several other characters speculate about where his new face came from, given that it has lines from frowning. The Doctor considers aloud that it is a face he recognises from somewhere, but due to post-regenerative trauma, he cannot place it. In [...] "The Girl Who Died" [...] (2015), he concludes that he subconsciously chose the face as a reminder of his decision {{to save the life of}} Caecilius (also played by Capaldi) in [...] "The Fires of Pompeii" [...] (2008) and to remind him to save people even with possible historical consequences by doing so.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{negative}} review, Flickering Myth critiqued that [...] "Some stories just don’t need telling, and Leatherface {{is one of}} them. It's not that it retcons elements of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre mythology, or that it's a 'pointless prequel' – it's just an empty movie. You'll have forgotten you've seen {{it as soon as}} the credits roll. Prequels, sequels and remakes can all enrich a story and tell it from a new perspective, but Leatherface just doesn’t do that."Screen International called the film [...] "a production line effort with an eye on cashflow rather than the demented work of art Hooper loosed on the world", stating [...] "this eighth entry is above average for its attenuated series. Gore levels are as high as expected and, naturally, the finale leaves things open for further installments." [...] Regarding the film's viewer appeal, HeyUGuys theorised, [...] "Not only is this prequel attempting to deliver something fans of the series don't necessarily want, it doesn't really do what it promises particularly well either. One for completists for sure, but on the whole Leatherface is too detached for TCM fans, and too extreme for the wider public." [...] William Bibbiani of IGN ranked it as the worst Texas Chainsaw Massacre film because [...] "it adds nothing new or interesting to the series. The problem is not just that this film is a prequel, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> exactly where it’s going, but that the road to the inevitable takes us through almost unbearably familiar territory. It honestly looks as though the filmmakers who made Leatherface didn't watch the original films, but watched all of the films that ripped off The Texas Chain Saw Massacre instead." [...] Film critic Rob Gonsalves reviewed that [...] "Hooper's Chainsaw is often imitated, never duplicated (or bested, say I), a sui generis sweatbox odyssey that seems to owe nothing to any other film before it. Leatherface feels properly respectful, made by filmmakers who idolize the original, and that’s also its weakness: it's a jumped-up fan film, and because it's meant to be a prequel to Hooper's movie it's locked into whatever happens in that movie. It can't deviate from what we know, and can't truly surprise us." [...] Heather Wixson of Daily Dead went into Leatherface [...] "primed to love it", but felt that the final product [...] "never quite makes up its mind about just what kind of movie it wants to be, and suffers for its indecision. But as a whole, Leatherface is such a disappointing entry because it spends so much time trying to be so many other things than just a straight-up Texas Chainsaw movie, and I couldn't help but wonder why." [...] Wixson commended the cinematography, practical effects, and Lili Taylor's acting, but slammed the third act.|$|E
