40|$|Drowned {{carbonate}} reefs on passive {{margins are}} puzzling {{because of their}} enormous growth potential compared to typical rates of passive margin subsidence and moderate sea-level fluctuations. A possible solution to this paradox is that slow processes acting over geologic time weaken reefs and contribute to their ultimate demise. The Australian northeastern marginal plateaus, known for their drowned reefs, underwent a period of accelerated tectonic subsidence during the late Miocene to Pliocene that, combined with a sequence of second-order global <b>sea-level</b> <b>rises,</b> outpaced reef growth and drowned the once-thriving Miocene carbonate platforms. However, the mechanism for the observed anomalous subsidence of this relatively mature passive margin 1000 km from the nearest plate boundary is uncertain. We use a coupled plate, kinematic mantle flow model to show that in the late Miocene northeastern Australia overrode subducted slabs from Eocene Melanesian subduction north of Papua New Guinea. We find {{that the rate of}} surface subsidence induced by the sinking slabs increases the likelihood that relative <b>sea-level</b> <b>rises</b> outpaced late Miocene reef growth. In addition to the well-known effects of long-term plate processes and short-term global sea-level and climate change, our results demonstrate that deep Earth processes can play a substantial role in driving the evolution of passive margins and coral reefs. ...|$|R

To the east, in western Colorado, a mountain range similar to today's Himalayas called the Uncompahgre Mountains bordered the Utah lowland. The interfingering of the Kaibab with the White Rim Sandstone, now exposed in Capitol Reef National Park area, {{to the east}} suggests that the marine facies of the Kaibab migrated eastward {{in response to a}} relative <b>sea-level</b> <b>rise,</b> or transgression (the White Rim is not exposed in the Zion area). The sea moved back and forth across Utah, but by the Middle Permian, the sea had withdrawn and the Kaibab Limestone was exposed to erosion, creating karst topography and channels reaching 30m (100ft) in depth.|$|E
5|$|Melting of {{floating}} ice shelves (ice that originated on the land) {{does not in}} itself contribute much to <b>sea-level</b> <b>rise</b> (since the ice displaces only its own mass of water). However it is the outflow of the ice from the land to form the ice shelf which causes a rise in global sea level. This effect is offset by snow falling back onto the continent. Recent decades have witnessed several dramatic collapses of large ice shelves around the coast of Antarctica, especially along the Antarctic Peninsula. Concerns have been raised that disruption of ice shelves may result in increased glacial outflow from the continental ice mass.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to their}} extinction, the Wrangel Island mammoths had {{accumulated}} numerous genetic defects {{due to their}} small population, consistent {{with the concept of}} genomic meltdown; in particular, a number of genes for olfactory receptors and urinary proteins became nonfunctional, possibly because they had lost their selective value on the island environment. It is not clear whether these genetic changes contributed to their extinction. The disappearance coincides roughly in time with the first evidence for humans on the island. The woolly mammoths of eastern Beringia (modern Alaska and Yukon) had similarly died out about 13,300 years ago, soon (roughly 1000 years) after the first appearance of humans in the area, which parallels the fate of all the other late Pleistocene proboscids (mammoths, gomphotheres and mastodons), as well as {{most of the rest of}} the megafauna, of the Americas. In contrast, the St. Paul Island mammoth population apparently died out prior to human arrival due to habitat shrinkage resulting from the post-ice-age <b>sea-level</b> <b>rise,</b> perhaps in large measure as a result of a consequent reduction in the freshwater supply.|$|E

It is also prefigured that brackish-region in rivers will expand by running of {{seawater}} to the upside of rivers. If the above phenomenon will appear, it is afraid that river embankments and riverbanks made by soil material are affected by seawater. From the background, it is required to evaluate vulnerability of river embankments and riverbanks as infrastructures. Furthermore, it is also required to select adaptation methods for mitigating the above affections. This study investigated changes of fundamental properties of soil materials, which is used to construct river embankments and riverbanks, by water chemistry in laboratory.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that orbital scale sea-level changes generated larger transport of sediments into the deep-sea during the last glacial maximum than the Holocene. However, the response of sedimentary processes to abrupt millennial-scale climate variability is rather unknown. Frequency of distal turbidites and amounts of advected detrital carbonate are estimated off the Lisbon-Setúbal canyons, within a chronostratigraphy based on radiometric ages, oxygen isotopes and paleomagnetic key global anomalies. We found that: 1) Higher frequency of turbidites concurred with Northern Hemisphere coldest temperatures (Greenland Stadials [GS], including Heinrich [H] events). But more than that, an escalating frequency of turbidites starts {{with the onset of}} global <b>sea-level</b> <b>rising</b> (and warming in Antarctica) and culminates during H events, at the time when rising is still in its early-mid stage, and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is re-starting. This short time span coincides with maximum gradients of ocean surface and bottom temperatures between GS and Antarctic warmings (Antarctic Isotope Maximum; AIM 17, 14, 12, 8, 4, 2) and rapid <b>sea-level</b> <b>rises.</b> 2) Trigger of turbidity currents is not the only sedimentary process responding to millennial variability; land-detrital carbonate (with a very negative bulk d 18 O signature) enters the deep-sea by density-driven slope lateral advection, accordingly during GS. 3) Possible mechanisms to create slope instability on the Portuguese continental margin are sea-level variations as small as 20 m, and slope friction by rapid deep and intermediate re-accommodation of water masses circulation. 4) Common forcing mechanisms appear to drive slope instability at both millennial and orbital scales...|$|R
25|$|Preparing for <b>sea-level</b> <b>rise</b> can be {{justified}} in many cases, because the cost of preparing now is small compared {{to the cost of}} reacting later. Examples include wetland protection, flood insurance, long-lived infrastructure, and coastal land-use planning.

Most coastal institutions were based on the implicit assumption that sea level and shorelines are stable. Efforts to plan for <b>sea-level</b> <b>rise</b> can be thwarted by several institutional biases, including government policies that encourage coastal development, flood insurance maps that do not consider <b>sea-level</b> <b>rise,</b> federal policies that prefer shoreline armoring over soft shore protection, and lack of plans delineating which areas would be protected or not as sea level rises.|$|E

The study of shellbeds in the terrigenous platform deposits of the Upper Ordovician of Sardinia and Lower Devonian of the Armorican Massif, considering the taphonomic signatures and their repartition at the scale of a genetic sequence, allows us to distinguish two types of shellbeds (types A and B) and to suggest a genetic model for their origin. Shellbeds formation is related to autocyclic and allocyclic constraints.

30|$|Before the {{deposition}} of the Jialingjiang Formation, the basin {{did not change}} geomorphically with the relative <b>sea-level</b> <b>rising.</b> The sedimentary facies changed obviously in the TST of the Sq 1. Mixed tidal flat facies were developed in southwestern part of the basin. Restricted lagoon facies were developed along the Guangyuan and Chengdu areas. Open platform {{was developed in the}} central and eastern parts of the basin, and most of which was covered by oolitic shoals (Fig.  6 a). During the HST of Sq 1, the basin developed mainly mixed tidal flat, restricted lagoon and restricted tidal flat facies from the east to west. The distribution of mixed tidal flat facies was relatively narrow. In the Tongnan and Dianjiang areas, evaporitic platform sporadically was developed (Fig.  6 b). The sedimentary stage of the TST of Sq 2 coincided with the development of restricted platform and open platform (Fig.  6 c). As the transgression culminated, the scale of the intraplatform shoal deposits continued to expand. During the HST of Sq 2, marine regression influenced the development of restricted platform in the entire area. Small-scale evaporitic platform and intraplatform shoal were also deposited (Fig.  6 d). During the sedimentary stage of the TST of Sq 3, the evaporitic platform, restricted platform, and open platform were developed from the west to east as the relative <b>sea-level</b> <b>rising.</b> Open platform shoal facies were locally deposited in eastern part of the basin (Fig.  6 e).

Many of the channels indicate that a wet climate prevailed in the Euphrates Basin region in the Upper Triassic period.

40|$|A clear {{relationship}} {{exists between}} eustatic <b>sea-level</b> <b>rises</b> and falls recorded as cyclical depositional sequences and ammonite faunas during the Cenomanian-Santonian in the Iberian and West Portuguese basins. Most of the faunal turnovers correlate with stratigraphic intervals related to marine transgressions, maximum flooding {{of the shelf}} (locally associated to anoxic events), and marine regressions. Specifically, within each depositional sequence, three distinct and identical events of morphological change occur, involving ammonoids belonging to different groups. Transgressive sediments are characterized by moderately ornamented, inflated and evolute morphologies, which are replaced by smooth, involute and compressed oxycones (the most hydrodynamic shells) during maximum flooding (and {{to a lesser extent}} at the early highstand) of the sequences. The latter morphologies in turn are replaced by coarsely ornamented and evolute shells during late highstands.

Here I correlate sediment core (TTN 057 – 21) SA events to Greenland and Antarctic ice using two independent methods, stable isotopes and geomagnetic paleointensity, placing SA {{events in the}} context of polar climate change in both hemispheres. Marine isotopic stage (MIS) 3 SA events generally coincided with Greenland interstadials and with cooling following Antarctic warm events (A 1 -A 4).

40|$|Lying at the {{crossroads}} of Asia and the Pacific world, the Indonesian archipelago hosts one of the world’s richest accumulations of cultural, linguistic, and genetic variation. While the role of human migration into and around the archipelago is now known in some detail, other aspects of Indonesia’s complex history are less understood. Here, we focus on population size changes from the first settlement of Indonesia nearly 50 kya up to the historic era. We reconstructed the past effective population sizes of Indonesian women using mitochondrial DNA sequences from 2, 104 individuals in 55 village communities on four islands spanning the Indonesian archipelago (Bali, Flores, Sumba, and Timor). We found little evidence for large fluctuations in effective population size. Most communities grew slowly during the late Pleistocene, peaked 15 – 20 kya, and subsequently declined slowly into the Holocene. This unexpected pattern may reflect population declines caused by the flooding of lowland hunter/gatherer habitat during <b>sea-level</b> <b>rises</b> following the last glacial maximum...|$|R
40|$|There are {{two very}} {{different}} interpretations of the prehistory of Island Southeast Asia (ISEA), with genetic evidence invoked in support of both. The "out-of-Taiwan" model proposes a major Late Holocene expansion of Neolithic Austronesian speakers from Taiwan. An alternative, proposing that Late Glacial/postglacial <b>sea-level</b> <b>rises</b> triggered largely autochthonous dispersals, accounts for some otherwise enigmatic genetic patterns but fails to explain the Austronesian language dispersal. Combining mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), Y-chromosome and genome-wide data, we performed the most comprehensive analysis of the region to date, obtaining highly consistent results across all three systems and allowing us to reconcile the models. We infer a primarily common ancestry for Taiwan/ISEA populations established before the Neolithic, but also detected clear signals of two minor Late Holocene migrations, probably representing Neolithic input from both Mainland Southeast Asia and South China, via Taiwan. This latter may therefore have mediated the Austronesian language dispersal, implying small-scale migration and language shift rather than large-scale expansion...|$|R

The purpose {{of this research is}} to contribute to the evidence for environmental change during the late Quaternary in the southern Africa from the analyses of continental shelf sediments and more specifically, to examine feasibility of using Namaqualand mudbelts as a key to understanding late environmental dynamics of both terrestrial and marine environment. Namaqualand mudbelts seem to have been deposited during the last 10 000 years. Chrono- and lithostratigraphy, coarse-fraction and geochemical analyses suggest the following sedimentary development on the Namaqualand offshore. An early period of deposition dominated by marine conditions off the coast, but with significant input in the north (Orange Delta) and south (off KIeinsee). There is a fining upcore sequence from the Orange Prodelta southward to the inner shelf (off Kleinsee). This fining-upward sequence is generally indicative of shoreward transgression of the sea (<b>rising</b> <b>sea-level).</b> As <b>sea-level</b> <b>rises</b> (shoreward transgression), finer-grained deeper water deposits migrate landward and are deposited over shallower water deposits.
