5|$|Carrick was {{capped by}} the England {{national}} under-18 and under-21 teams before receiving his first call-up {{to the senior}} team in Sven-Göran Eriksson's first game in charge of England in February 2001. Despite being named in the 31-man squad to face Spain, he was an unused substitute in England's 3–0 victory on 28 February. Three months later he made his England debut, replacing David Beckham as a second-half substitute in a 4–0 friendly win over Mexico. His full debut came during their 2–1 victory over the United States on 28 May 2005. Three days later Carrick <b>started</b> <b>again</b> in a 3–2 victory over Colombia in {{the final game of}} their tour of the USA.|$|E
5|$|Giro {{champion}} Denis Menchov was {{the last}} man to take the course. The rain <b>started</b> <b>again</b> as he and Di Luca were the last ones on course.

Support staff from his team car gave him a very quick bike change and he was back up in moments, finishing 24 seconds back on the stage to preserve his overall victory in the Giro.|$|E
5|$|Often, {{teams will}} finish a season with {{identical}} records. It becomes necessary, therefore, to devise means to break these ties, either {{to determine which}} teams will qualify for the playoffs, or to determine seeding in the playoff tournament. The rules below are applied in order until the tie is broken. If three teams are tied for one playoff spot and the third team is eliminated at any step, the tie breaker reverts to step one for the remaining two teams. If multiple playoff spots are at stake, the rules are applied in order until the first team qualifies, then the process is <b>started</b> <b>again</b> for the remaining teams.|$|E

5|$|Yardley {{decided to}} use the medium roller to flatten out the surface, but further showers breathed more life into the pitch, forcing a rain break {{immediately}} after the start of England's run chase. The rain immediately stopped after the players returned to the pavilion, but upon promptly returning to the middle, the rain <b>started</b> <b>again.</b> The players returned after 15 minutes and played for approximately half an hour, before Washbrook and Hutton unsuccessfully appealed against the light. Rain then came again for another 40 minutes, which included the tea break. The weather cleared in time for the normal resumption of play at 4:30 after the scheduled adjournment.|$|E

5|$|Hibernian played {{its first}} match on the Meadows, on 25 December 1875. The club {{first moved to}} the Easter Road area in 1880, to a ground known as Hibernian Park. This {{location}} {{had the advantage of}} being equidistant between their two main sources of support, the Irish immigrant communities in the port of Leith and the Old Town of Edinburgh. When Hibs suffered financial difficulties in the early 1890s, the lease on Hibernian Park expired and developers started building what would become Bothwell Street. The club was reformed in 1892 and a lease on a piece of land called Drum Park was secured. The site had restricted access from Easter Road, a pronounced slope and was in close proximity to Bank Park, the home of Leith Athletic. There was a sense of continuity from the previous ground, however, and the supporters were keen to get <b>started</b> <b>again.</b> The first match at Easter Road was played on 4 February 1893, a friendly against Clyde.|$|E
5|$|In an oddity, Greinke {{became the}} first pitcher to start three {{straight}} games in the Majors in 95 years. On July 7, he was ejected from the game after just 4 pitches for angrily throwing {{the ball into the}} ground following a close play at first base. The following day, Greinke <b>started</b> <b>again,</b> but lasted only until the third inning. The All-Star break followed, and Greinke was the Brewers' starter on July 13, the team's next game. Greinke's third start ended after 5 innings. Before this, the most recent pitcher to start three consecutive games was Red Faber in the 1917, who started both games of a September 3 doubleheader, throwing just six innings in total, followed by a complete game win the following day. Overall, Grienke finished the 2011 year with a 16-6 record, a 3.83 ERA, and 201 strikeouts in 28 starts.|$|E

5|$|Pointing {{out that}} Cleveland already had three quarterbacks, Browns {{president}} Mike Holmgren said McCoy would likely not play {{his first season}} with the team {{in order to develop}} him as an NFL quarterback. However, due to injuries to starting quarterback Jake Delhomme and back-up Seneca Wallace, McCoy made his first career start against the Pittsburgh Steelers in week 6. McCoy completed 23 of 33 passes for 281 yards, a touchdown, and two interceptions in the Browns' loss. He also scrambled four times for 22 yards. McCoy started the following week against the New Orleans Saints and contributed to the surprising victory over the defending Super Bowl champions 30-17 at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans. On November 7, McCoy made his third consecutive start and led the Browns to another upset victory, this time against the New England Patriots 34-14. He then <b>started</b> <b>again</b> on November 14 against the New York Jets; however the Browns lost in overtime with McCoy throwing for 205 yards and a touchdown. McCoy injured his ankle in week 11 against the Jacksonville Jaguars and missed the next three weeks before returning to start under center against the Cincinnati Bengals in week 15. McCoy threw for 243 yards and 2 touchdowns with no interceptions, but Cleveland lost. In each of the final two games against division rivals Baltimore and Pittsburgh, McCoy threw 3 interceptions as the Browns lost both games. McCoy finished the season with 6 touchdowns against 9 interceptions.|$|E
