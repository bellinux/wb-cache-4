5|$|It {{is likely}} that Theophanu kept the {{document}} until October 989, when <b>she</b> <b>left</b> <b>for</b> her journey to Italy and Rome, at which time it is believed she placed it in Gandersheim Abbey to preserve the document. It was discovered and published in 1700 by writer and historian Johann Georg Leuckfeld.

After the secularisation of Gandersheim Abbey in 1811, the document was transferred to the Göttingen State and University Library. On 4 May 1820, the archives from the abbey were delivered to the treasury of the duchy of Brunswick. In 1835, the document was transferred to the State Archives of Wolfenbüttel, where it remains.|$|E

5|$|The {{spring of}} 1912 was emotionally unsettling for Potter; {{her father was}} ill and severe strikes across the country caused hardships. In April 1912, she managed {{to get away from}} London for Hill Top to execute {{background}} drawings for the tale. By July, most of the colour blocks were finished, but Potter was concerned about the anatomy of the fox, and checked photographs and reference books in the Natural History Museum in an attempt to distinguish the true English red fox (Vulpes vulpes) from other species. The book was finished by the end of July when <b>she</b> <b>left</b> <b>for</b> holiday at Lake Windemere. Completion of the tale had taken longer than usual because her time had been shared with participation in a campaign opposing hydroplanes on Lake Windemere and the proposed construction of an aeroplane factory near the lake.|$|E

A British expedition of 3,000 troops from St Lucia, under the command of Lieutenant-General Sir John Vaughan, arrived off St Eustatius on 3February 1781. Rodney, in command of the naval forces, positioned his fleet so as to neutralise any shore batteries, but instead of disembarking the troops and launching an immediate assault, Rodney sent a message to Governor Johannes de Graaff suggesting that he surrender to avoid bloodshed. DeGraaff agreed to the proposal and capitulated. The only shots fired were from Gibraltar and , both of which, without orders, briefly engaged Mars, the only Dutch warship in the roadstead.|$|E
5|$|Michigan {{was laid}} down on 17 December 1906 at the New York Shipbuilding Corporation. Her {{completed}} hull was launched on 26 May 1908; she was christened after the 26th state by Mrs. F. W. Brooks, daughter of Secretary of the Navy Truman Newberry. Fitting out work {{was completed by}} 4 January 1910, when she was commissioned into the US Navy.

The ship reached Guantanamo Bay, Cuba on 10 January 1911 and continued on to Norfolk, arriving four days later. During this period, future naval aviation pioneer John Henry Towers served aboard the ship as a spotter for the main guns.

5|$|On 21 March, Idaho {{joined the}} Gunfire and Covering Group {{under the command}} of Rear Admiral Morton Deyo, as the {{flagship}} of Bombardment Unit 4. She began shelling the island on 25 March, and the landings started on 1 April. The Battle of Okinawa marked the height of the kamikaze attacks by the increasingly desperate Japanese defenders. Idaho shot down five kamikazes in a massed attack on 12 April, and in return, a near miss inflicted damage to her port side anti-torpedo bulge. Temporary repairs were effected off Okinawa, and on 20 April <b>she</b> <b>left</b> <b>for</b> Guam, arriving on the 25th. Permanent repairs were completed quickly, allowing the ship to return to Okinawa on 22 May, where she resumed her fire support mission. She operated off Okinawa until 20 June, before departing for the Philippines. There, she conducted training operations in Leyte Gulf until Japan agreed to surrender on 15 August. Idaho was among the ships to enter Tokyo Bay on 27 August, carrying a detachment of occupation troops. She was present during the signing of the surrender documents on 2 September.
