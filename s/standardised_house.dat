40|$|This paper {{develops}} a tiered geography of local housing market areas (HMAs) {{that provides a}} national framework for spatial planning. It is derived from a theoretical understanding of the economic basis of HMAs. The analysis explores the relation-ships between the tiers of the HMA geography and local labour market areas. Drawing on this understanding, the empirical research generates sets of different potential geographies of HMAs for England based on an algorithm that applies cri-teria linked {{to the degree of}} closure of migration and/or commuting patterns. A range of theoretically appropriate criteria then enable the different geographies to be assessed. The choice of geography is guided by Chow tests of statistical differences in <b>standardised</b> <b>house</b> prices in neighbouring HMAs derived from hedonic regressions. Finally, conclusions are drawn on the validity of the approach developed. The empirical work is on England and datasets drawn from the Census and Land Registry.

40|$|<b>Standardised</b> <b>house</b> {{design is}} {{commonly}} employed in current mass housing in Malaysia. Although all completed houses {{are assumed to}} have met the building and planning regulations, the current renovation works indicate the ‘failure’ of the design to meet the expectation of users of different backgrounds. This paper propagates “personalization” as a sustainable means of achieving sustainable living environment. Personalization {{is an act of}} marking and changing in order to impose control on one’s territory. The act ranges from furniture rearrangement, putting up displays to structural modification of living units. “Personalization” is essential and a continuous process in housing because people’s physical and psychological needs are ever changing. In mass housing personalization, user participation is central because home environment is an extension of man’s existence and personality, hence man is an agent of environmental change and not merely a recipient of environmental influences. Man should be able to manipulate, shape and alter the environment to meet their needs. Instinctively man is directed by his goals in which to achieve this, he has to interact with his physical and non-physical environments. Cultural influences, particularly the multi-ethnic user values are seen as determinant to selecting and changing housing unit’s attributes. Although renovation works have been in practice in this country for a long time, there is no proper framework established to accommodate the potentially viable approach for a better sustainable and quality home making. This paper suggests a possible framework of personalization that is prerequisite to developing future house design prototypes...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{consultation}} and negotiation practices employed {{in the provision of}} housing and built environments for the remote Aboriginal communities of central Australia. This AHURI-supported research arose from concerns that living conditions were not improving in the communities of the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Lands and the Ngaanyatjarra Lands of South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory, despite extensive programs for housing and infrastructure delivery. Effective consultation is widely accepted by practitioners and service providers as pivotal to the design and delivery of built environments appropriate to such communities. Yet standardisation of housing and project management services has resulted in design and building outcomes that require less consultation and negotiation between clients, architects, builders and service providers. For housing and infrastructure to be culturally appropriate and physically sustainable, there is a requirement for an understanding of community needs and preferences which identify issues beyond the pragmatics of <b>standardised</b> <b>housing...</b>|$|R
40|$|The UK {{speculative}} housebuilding {{industry has}} grown and prospered primarily through {{the conversion of}} greenfield land into mass, <b>standardised</b> <b>housing</b> estates. As such, the UK Government’s commitment to restricting the development of housing primarily to brownfield sites presents a significant challenge to the current skills base of many speculative housebuilders. Whilst the housebuilding industry has demonstrated in recent years a commitment to brownfield development through the steady increase {{in the numbers of}} dwellings built on previously developed land, concerns exists over whether the industry has developed the requisite core competencies necessary to secure a long-term commitment to brownfield development. In response to such concerns, this research assesses the attitudes, behaviours and corporate strategies of a select number of speculative housebuilders towards brownfield development in the English and Scottish contexts. Through this, the research presents a timely and important evaluation of the strategic decision making of UK speculative housebuilders and explores the concept of institutional capacity through an investigation into the private sectors response to public policy change...|$|R

40|$|Examines {{the drivers}} {{of demand for}} bespoke housing, the impact of {{building}} firm size and the barriers to innovation, and thus productivity, in New Zealand residential construction. Executive summary This report examines the drivers of demand for bespoke housing, the impact of building firm size and the barriers to innovation, and thus productivity, in New Zealand residential construction. NZIER interviewed home buyers that commissioned new builds, builders, and other industry stakeholders. The engagement was informed by research and economic benchmarking of housing in Australia and the USA. NZIER did not engage regulators or review regulations; this was outside of the report scope. The report was prepared for BRANZ and the Building and Construction Productivity Partnership who are concerned with: 	the slow speed of supply due to the types of houses demanded (i. e. bespoke/ tailored homes) 	low productivity in housing construction, which creates {{the risk that the}} demand for new houses cannot be met in a timely manner.

40|$|Laboratory mice are {{generally}} <b>housed</b> in small <b>standardised</b> cages {{with a layer}} of sawdust and unlimited access to food and water, without further additions that increase cage complexity. These current housing standards in laboratory animal facilities ensure fulfilment of all physical needs, but performance of natural behaviours is severely restricted under these conditions. In an attempt to improve welfare, mice are often given so-called ‘enrichment’ in their cages, resulting in a change in physiological and behavioural responses. However, there is considerable variety in enrichment protocols, complicating the goal of achieving standardised environments for laboratory animals. Findings are strain, gender and age dependent, and conclusions on effects on animal wellbeing are inconclusive. <b>Standardised</b> <b>housing</b> conditions are considered essential to decrease variation. However, more recently {{it has been argued that}} standardisation can result in poor reproducibility due to minor variations between experiments or laboratories, while heterogenization can potentially improve reproducibility. Overall, research is necessary in which experimental designs need to be adapted and enrichment specific effects need to be carefully evaluated, which is crucial in the development of enrichment strategies...|$|R

40|$|Depleted {{human and}} social capital, {{displacement}} of people, destruction of property, weakened institutions and ruined economy {{are some of}} the legacies of conflicts. Within this context, post conflict reconstruction contributes to overcome the legacies of conflict through reactivating the development process that has been disrupted by the conflict. Among the post conflict reconstruction interventions, post conflict housing reconstruction is paramount important as it contributes to development and peace through restoring the economic and social life of conflict affected people. Despite the importance, the success of post conflict housing reconstruction is hindered by a number of problems such as lack of strategies to address the unique challenges faced by vulnerable households, lack of involvement of local people, lack of use of local building material and technology, lack of local economic development, lack of community linkages, lack of cultural and local consideration, overlooked socio-economic conditions of occupants, <b>standardised</b> <b>housing</b> models, housing models imported from different cultures, lack of beneficiary consultation, poor performance of agencies, bribery and corruptions and lack of post occupancy evaluation. If not properly managed, these issues lead to hinder the success of post conflict housing reconstruction and its contribution to the development and peace. This paper argues that lack of concern on housing needs has directly or indirectly given rise for most of these issues through a comprehensive literature review on post conflict housing reconstruction and housing needs. The paper establishes the link between the problems of housing reconstruction and lack of addressing housing needs. Accordingly, it concludes that adequate housing measures provide a general guideline in addressing housing needs and addressing such needs leads to minimise the problems of post conflict housing reconstruction...|$|R

40|$|The {{aftermath}} of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami witnessed extensive housing reconstruction programs by humanitarian agencies in the affected countries. In the most impacted country, Indonesia, in Aceh province more than 140, 000 houses were built by more than 120 agencies. Within a few years it became evident that residents {{found it necessary to}} extend, remodel and renovate and thus transform the houses to suit their own and broader social needs; a self-initiated construction process proliferated beyond the investments by agencies. Key questions arise in such a context: Why must the beneficiaries transform their houses? What needs are not met through the <b>standardised</b> <b>houses?</b> Can particular types improve the capacity for residents to transform their house? Perhaps most significantly, what lessons does such transformation offer that can inform future policy and practice in the field of post-disaster housing reconstruction? This paper addresses such questions and is derived from an in-depth study of the self-initiated transformation process of post-tsunami housing in Aceh, supported by Raphael Vinoly Architects, New York. It outlines the background and context of the process and provides examples of housing that have been and are undergoing transformation, by way of illustrating the nature of and reasons for such initiatives. Drawing on the lessons gained from the examples, the paper underscores key implications for future housing reconstruction programs in a context of climate change and increasing frequency and intensity of disaster events...|$|R
40|$|Includes Portuguese summary. Includes bibliographies. This study {{examines}} {{the hypothesis that}} informal settlement intervention in South Africa is trapped in a market-oriented paradigm of <b>standardised</b> <b>housing</b> delivery that cannot appropriately address the complex reality of informal settlement. I approach this hypothesis through a cross-national comparison between South Africa and Brazil. Underlying this choice of methodology is the realisation that current informal settlement intervention in Brazil differs considerably from South Africa, despite broad parallels in socio-political process throughout the 20 th century. I introduce the contrast between informal settlement intervention in South Africa and Brazil, by situating the debates and practice {{in each of the}} two countries in relation to those presented in the international literature. I then explore the causes of this contrast through a socio-political comparison of the emergence of informal settlements in the two countries throughout the 20 th century, and of·the responses to informal settlement from the various sectors of society, as portrayed in the South African and Brazilian literature respectively. This insight into the evolution of government intervention approaches in South Africa, as opposed to Brazil, gives a critical perspective to the South African situation. It enables me to expose the dominance of the market-oriented paradigm in current scholarly debates on informal settlement intervention in South Africa. It also enables me to expose the impact of this intervention paradigm on the strategies of organised informal settlement communities. For this purpose, four case studies of informal settlements undergoing intervention through the current South African framework were compiled through in-depth interviewing of key role-players in the development process...|$|R
25|$|Following World War Two, Finland ceded 11% of its {{territory}} and 30% {{of its economic}} assets to the Soviet Union {{as part of the}} Moscow Peace Treaty of 1940. Also 12% of Finland's population, including some 422,000 Karelians, were evacuated. The state response to this has become known as the period of reconstruction. Reconstruction started in the rural areas because still at that time two-thirds of the population lived there. But reconstruction involved not only the repair of war damage (e.g. the destruction of the city of Rovaniemi by the retreating German army) but also the beginnings of greater urbanisation, programmes for <b>standardised</b> <b>housing,</b> building programmes for schools, hospitals, universities and other public service buildings, as well as the construction of new industries and power stations. For instance, architect Aarne Ervi was responsible for the design of five power stations along the Oulujoki river in the decade after the war, and Alvar Aalto designed several industrial complexes following the war, though in fact he had been heavily involved in designing projects of various sizes for Finnish industrial enterprises already since the 1930s. However, for all the expansion of public works, the decade following the war was marred by shortages in building materials, except for wood. The Finnish Lutheran Church also became a key figure in architecture in the interim and post-war period by arranging with the Finnish Association of Architects (SAFA) architectural competitions for the design of new churches and cemeteries/cemetery chapels throughout the country, and significant war-time and post-war examples include: Turku Resurrection Chapel (Erik Bryggman, 1941), Lahti Church (Alvar Aalto, 1950), Vuoksenniska Church (Alvar Aalto, 1952-7), Vatiala Cemetery Chapel, Tampere (Viljo Rewell, 1960), Hyvinkää Church (Aarno Ruusuvuori, 1960), and Holy Cross Chapel, Turku (Pekka Pitkänen, 1967). Bryggman in particular designed several cemetery chapels but also was the most prolific designer of war graves, designed in conjunction with artists.|$|R

40|$|Small action cameras have {{received}} interest {{for use in}} underwater videography because of their low-cost, <b>standardised</b> <b>housing,</b> widespread availability and small size. Here, we assess the capacity of GoPro action cameras to provide accurate stereo-measurements of fish {{in comparison to the}} Sony handheld cameras that have traditionally been used for this purpose. Standardised stereo-GoPro and Sony systems were employed to capture measurements of known-length targets in a pool to explore the influence of the type of camera, distance to camera rig, angle to the optical axis and target speed on measurement accuracy. The capacity to estimate fish length in situ was also compared by measuring the same fish on a coral reef with two baited remote underwater video systems, each fitted with both a GoPro and a Sony camera system. Pool trials indicated that the GoPros were generally less accurate than the Sonys. Accuracy decreased with increased angles and distance for both systems but remained reasonably low (< 7. 5 %) at 5 m distance and 25 angle for GoPros. Speed of target movement did not result in any consistent decrease in accuracy. In situ measurements revealed a strong correlation (R- 2 = 0. 94) between Sony and GoPro length measurements of the same individual fish, with a slope not different from 1 and an intercept not different from 0, suggesting that GoPro measurement errors do not result in a consistent bias at the level of individual fish. Moreover, the investigation of kernel density functions of the length distribution of the entire fish assemblage indicated that difference in measurement accuracy becomes negligible for purposes of comparing population size structure. We suggest a measurement protocol for the use of GoPro stereo-camera systems that improves accuracy, where distance to target is limited to 5 m and angle to optical axis is restricted to 25 degrees. For distances up to 7 m, angles should be restricted to 15 degrees. This protocol supports the use of small action cameras such as the GoPro system, providing reductions in cost and increases in effective sampling efforts, compared with traditional rigs based on relatively expensive handheld cameras...|$|R
40|$|An energy {{transition}} is currently {{taking place in}} many European countries. Existing studies comparing countries’ {{energy transition}} pathways are limited in scope and lack a strong theoretical foundation. This thesis addresses the lack of theoretical framework-based approaches by applying a sectoral analysis framework, identifying the main factors facilitating or hindering the sustainable energy transition in several countries, and the significant differences between them. The research focused on four countries; the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany and the United Kingdom and {{was limited to the}} residential sector of the built environment. It included the three dominant housing types: social rental; private rental; and homeownership. Data was clustered along the four dimensions of the sectoral analysis framework, identifying: (1) actors, interactions & networks; (2) the institutional or legal framework; (3) the technological framework; and (4) market demand. The same process was repeated for each of the countries, forming a detailed overview about their chosen energy transition pathways. A number of interviews were conducted to gain further insight into country-specific factors. With respect to actors, interactions and networks, this study has found that strong ties and cooperation between ministries and departments is an important factor facilitating policy success, with departmental fragmentation or competition posing a significant barrier. In terms of the institutional framework policy stability, clear targets and long-term policy framework are all factors for policy success. Conversely, frequent changes to existing policies, non-binding goals and the absence of a long-term framework are all seen as barriers for a sustainable energy transition. Looking at the technological regime, this study found countries with active support for renewable energy technologies have a higher share of renewable energy than countries where the choice of technologies is largely market-based. Past technological choices and existing energy-infrastructure were found to influence transition pathways and can be both a positive or negative factor. Lastly, with respect to market demand, the existence of a <b>standardised</b> <b>housing</b> stock was found to be a potentially significant factor for the upscaling of innovative initiatives. The existence of a large and fragmented (private) rental sector and high interest rates on financing products were found to be further barriers for the energy transition in the residential sector. This thesis has identified obstacles matching those in previous studies and introduced a number of factors facilitating policy success. It has made a first step in overcoming the lack in theoretical framework-based approaches in energy transition analysis future studies can build on...|$|R

Although they are in different developmental phases with different historical backgrounds, they share a common experience of fast economic growth and urbanisation.

In this paper we present the requirements for beam monitors for the ESS and the strategy to meet these in a standardised approach. A large range of specifications in efficiency, dynamic range, time and position resolution, compatible materials are needed. A new feature for neutron beam monitors for some locations, is the ability to measure time profile of each source pulse individually. In general, event mode readout will be used for monitors, similarly to other neutron detectors at the facility. A selection of detectors based on different technologies will be available. Monitors will be integrated with beam lines and choppers in a way that allows to freely choose the type of monitor based on final requirements of an instrument.

MethodThe trial included 604 subjects, ≥ 14 years, with mild-moderate HDM allergic asthma. Subjects were randomised 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 to 1, 3 or 6 SQ-HDM or placebo once daily. The primary endpoint was reduction in inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) after one year. ICS reduction, asthma {{quality of life}} questionnaire (AQLQ) and asthma control questionnaire (ACQ) score was analysed post hoc in a subgroup with daily ICS use of 400 – 800  μg and ACQ score of 1 – 1. 5, corresponding to partly controlled asthma (N =  108). ResultsThe trial met its primary endpoint. In the subgroup, the difference between placebo and 6 SQ-HDM in change from baseline in daily ICS use was 327  μg (p <  0. 0001), while it was 0. 52 (p =  0. 010) for AQLQ. The treatment effect on ICS reduction and AQLQ was increased for the subgroup versus the residual population (ICS reduction: p <  0. 001); AQLQ: p =  0. 044). ConclusionIn this subgroup, including only patients with partly controlled asthma, the benefit of 1 year of treatment with SQ HDM SLIT-tablet {{was significantly higher than}} for the less severe full population, both in terms of increased asthma control and improved quality of life...|$|R
