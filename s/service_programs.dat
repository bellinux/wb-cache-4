5|$|The {{appointment}} of Colin Campbell as comptroller general in 1966 fostered substantial changes within Fremantle Prison itself. One {{of his first}} changes was to clear the classification committee's backlog of prisoners awaiting assessment. Campbell also established an officer training school, {{as well as an}} assessment centre to evaluate new prisoners. Work release and community <b>service</b> <b>programs</b> were also introduced, along with training programs, social workers and welfare officers. Within the midst of Campbell's reforms, the Prisons Department was renamed the Department of Corrections in 1971, restructured, and the position of comptroller general was replaced with director of the department.|$|E

5|$|Though {{a strong}} {{governor}} with many successes, Clements {{was not able}} to enact his full legislative agenda. In 1948, his proposal to create a centralized board that governed all Kentucky colleges failed in the General Assembly. In both the 1948 and 1950 legislative sessions, Clements failed to convince the General Assembly to regulate strip mining. He also failed in his attempts to establish statewide pension and civil <b>service</b> <b>programs,</b> and was unable to enact a merit system for state employees. Attempts to fund a veterans' bonus passed the two houses of the General Assembly in different forms and were unable to be reconciled.|$|E
5|$|Williamson {{and other}} members of Jamaica's lesbian, gay, bisexual, and {{transgender}} (LGBT) community decided to form an organisation to campaign for their rights, resulting in the establishment of the Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All Sexuals, and Gays (J-FLAG) in December 1998. J-FLAG sought to enhance LGBT rights through advocacy and encouraging legal reform, as well as through educational and social <b>service</b> <b>programs.</b> They also kept a record of anti-LGBT hate crimes including assaults, home invasions, and the corrective rape of lesbians, further recording the murder of 30 gay men between 1997 and 2004. From the time of the group's foundation, its members were subjected to repeated death threats. Williamson became the public face of the group, appearing on radio talk shows and television shows such as Perspective and Nationwide in which he argued against homophobia and called for greater government investment to tackle the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Unlike most other LGBT rights activists in Jamaica, Williamson did not seek to protect himself by using a pseudonym, disguising his voice, or hiding his appearance. Facing hostility and threats of violence, Williamson left Jamaica and moved to Canada and then England, before returning to the island in 2002. There, he moved into an apartment in his Haughton Street compound and decided to take a renewed role within Jamaica's LGBT rights movement. He lived in one room of his apartment block and rented out a number of others.|$|E

25|$|Agriculture {{is a major}} {{industry}} in the United States, with California accounting for over 12% of the U.S. agriculture cash receipts. Over half of agricultural workers in California, contributing to the state's agriculture economy and providing the nation with over half of all fruits and vegetables, are undocumented. Despite undocumented laborers contributing to the agriculture industry, farm work and labor is among {{one of the lowest}} paid occupations in the U.S. Many undocumented communities suffer from food insecurity due to low wages, forcing families to purchase economically viable unhealthy food. Though existing food pantry and food stamp programs aid in reducing the amount of food insecure individuals, undocumented immigrants are ineligible for social <b>service</b> <b>programs</b> and studies have found that limited English acts as a barrier to food stamp program participation. Due to a lack of education, encounters with government agents, language barriers, undocumented individuals pose higher rates of food insecurity and hunger when compared to legal citizens. The Trump administration is attempting to draft new stricter immigration policies; undocumented individuals who fear being deported under the new policies, limit their interactions with government agencies, social <b>service</b> <b>programs</b> (e.g., food stamps), increasing their susceptibility to food insecurity.|$|E
