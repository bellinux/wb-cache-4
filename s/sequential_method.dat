During kick-down, the DSG will skip gears, shifting directly to the most appropriate gear depending on speed and throttle opening. This kick-down may be engaged by any increased accelerator pedal opening, and is completely independent of the additional resistance to be found when the pedal is pressed fully to the floor, which will activate a similar kick-down function when in Manual operation mode. The seven-speed unit in the 2007 Audi variants will not automatically shift to 6th gear; rather, it stays at 5th to keep power available at a high RPM while cruising.|$|E

It is mentioned that due to the human cognitive process, the alignment towards a single method of thinking is simply not possible. Even when individuals adopt a <b>sequential</b> <b>method</b> of solving a problem, between the initiation and conclusion of the question there has to exist some form of creativity.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we develop a {{multiscale}} method that solves non-isothermal flow in porous media. A sequential formulation is established that decouples corresponding equations into three systems, one pertaining pressure, one pertaining temperature and one pertaining transport. The <b>sequential</b> <b>method</b> is then verified against a standard fully implicit method on two examples with varying {{degree of complexity}} on the permeability field. By adjusting a tolerance that decides the number of outer iterations in the <b>sequential</b> <b>method,</b> the method converges toward the fully implicit method.

This multiscale method is then vigorously tested against the <b>sequential</b> <b>method</b> on several examples with varying degrees of complex grids and permeability fields, as well as being verified for both single-phase and multiphase flow. The multiscale method can, by adjusting the parameters of the original <b>sequential</b> <b>method,</b> converge towards various fully implicit solutions, or give a reasonable approximation on the coarse scale.

A comparative study between six simulators with two numerical methods, conventional simultaneous and modified sequential methods are carried out. The {{results of the}} numerical models are compared with the laboratory experimental results to study {{the accuracy of the}} model especially in heterogeneous porous media. From the study it is observed that the simulator using pressure and saturation of the wetting fluid (PW, SW formulation) is the best among the models tested. Many simulators with nonwetting phase as one of the primary variables did not converge when used along with simultaneous method. Based on simulator 1 (PW, SW formulation), a comparison of different solution methods such as simultaneous method, modified sequential and adaptive solution modified <b>sequential</b> <b>method</b> are carried out on 4 test problems including heterogeneous and randomly heterogeneous problems.
