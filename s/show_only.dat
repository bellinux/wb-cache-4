5|$|Khaba's name {{appears on}} nine {{polished}} stone bowls, variously made of magnesite, travertine, and diorite, which {{were found at}} the archaeological locales of Zawyet el'Aryan, Abusir, and Naga-ed-Deir. The bowls were found mostly intact; they <b>show</b> <b>only</b> the king's serekh name on their polished surfaces. As was conventional {{at the time they}} were made, they contain no additional inscriptions for context.|$|E

He later saved Cena from an assault by Big <b>Show,</b> <b>only</b> to be laid out by CM Punk.|$|E
5|$|Ganymede's {{magnetic}} field is probably created by convection within its liquid iron core.

The satellite has a thin oxygen atmosphere that includes O, O2, and possibly O3 (ozone). Atomic hydrogen is a minor atmospheric constituent. Whether the satellite has an ionosphere associated with its atmosphere is unresolved.|$|E

5|$|Muscle biopsy can {{be useful}} if an episode of {{rhabdomyolysis}} {{is thought to be}} the result of an underlying muscle disorder. A biopsy sample taken during an episode is often uninformative, as it will <b>show</b> <b>only</b> evidence of cell death or may appear normal. Taking the sample is therefore delayed for several weeks or months. The histopathological appearance on the biopsy indicates the nature of the underlying disorder. For instance, mitochondrial diseases are characterized by ragged red fibers. Biopsy sites may be identified by medical imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging, as the muscles may not be uniformly affected.|$|E
5|$|The Bohemian waxwing (Bombycilla garrulus) is a starling-sized {{passerine}} {{bird that}} breeds {{in the northern}} forests of Eurasia and North America. It has mainly buff-grey plumage, black face markings and a pointed crest. Its wings are patterned with white and bright yellow, and some feather tips have the red waxy appearance that give this species its English name. The three subspecies <b>show</b> <b>only</b> minor differences in appearance. Females are similar to males, although young birds are less well-marked and have few or no waxy wingtips. Although the Bohemian waxwing's range overlaps those of the cedar and Japanese waxwings, it is easily distinguished from them by size and plumage differences.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to invite Bach {{was made by}} the council on 15 January 1723. The council seemed to have preferred Bach and Graupner because they were invited to show two cantatas each, while other candidates were requested to <b>show</b> <b>only</b> one. Two candidates even had to present their work in the same service. Graupner's performance took place on the last Sunday after Epiphany, 17 January 1723. Two days before the event, the town council already agreed to offer him the position.|$|E

5|$|The {{priests of}} Q'uq'umatz {{were drawn from}} an {{important}} lineage among the ruling Kaweq dynasty and this was {{likely to have been}} a source of power and prestige for the Kaweq. The temple of Q'uq'umatz must have been completely dismantled very soon after the Spanish Conquest since it is not mentioned by any of the Colonial era visitors, and early drawings of the site <b>show</b> <b>only</b> vegetation where the temple once stood. The tradition of circular temples dedicated to the Feathered Serpent deity was an ancient one in the Mesoamerican cultural region.|$|E
5|$|The {{surviving}} regnal lists <b>show</b> <b>only</b> one king reigning {{at a time}} in Kent, but subkingdoms {{were common}} among the Anglo-Saxons and from the reign of Hlothhere, in the late seventh century, there is evidence that Kent was usually ruled by two kings, though often one is clearly dominant. It is less clear that this is the case before Hlothhere. Forged charters preserve a tradition of Eadbald ruling during his father's reign, presumably as a subking over west Kent. The papal letter that has been interpreted as indicating the existence of Æthelwald, a brother of Eadbald's, refers to Æthelwald as a king; if he existed, he would presumably have been a junior king to Eadbald.|$|E
5|$|Arroway falls {{unconscious}} as {{she begins}} traveling back through a wormhole. She awakens {{to find herself}} {{on the floor of}} the pod, the mission control team repeatedly hailing her. She learns that, from outside the machine, it appears the pod merely dropped through the machine's rings and landed in a safety net. Arroway insists that she was gone for approximately 18 hours, but her recording devices <b>show</b> <b>only</b> static. A Congressional Committee is formed and speculates that the Vega signal and machine were a hoax designed by the now-deceased Hadden. Although she cannot prove it happened, Arroway asks the committee to accept the truth of her testimony on faith. In a private conversation, Kitz and White House official Rachel Constantine reflect on confidential information that, although Arroway's recording device only recorded static, it recorded 18 hours of it. Arroway and Joss reunite, and Arroway receives ongoing financial support to expand the SETI program.|$|E

5|$|On 31 July 2013, the Nationalist {{political}} party Maharashtra Navnirman Sena's film wing threatened {{to disrupt the}} film's premiere; it reportedly attempted to dislodge ongoing popular Marathi movies from cinemas that <b>show</b> <b>only</b> one film at a time. The party was upset with reports that the distributors of Chennai Express had demanded prime slots in single screen cinemas, and at some multiplexes, where the superhit Marathi film Duniyadari had been popular since 19 July. On 1 August 2013, both the film directors, Rohit Shetty and Sanjay Jadhav were called on by Raj Thackeray to find a solution. After listening to both parties, Thackeray ruled that if Duniyadari was not removed from single screen cinemas across the state, then the MNS would not object {{to the release of}} Chennai Express in Maharashtra.|$|E
5|$|The Blitz ended as the Luftwaffe {{moved its}} forces to support Operation Barbarossa and the {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union in June 1941 and air raids slackened. During the second half of 1941, small numbers of German aircraft made pinpoint attacks across Britain and German night fighters attempted intercept operations over England to disrupt RAF Bomber Commands bombing of Germany. On 23 June Braham claimed a probable against a He 111 which Royal Observer Corps personnel saw crash. But since he had lost contact with ground control (having wandered out of No. 29s area of operations) and fearing being lost or pursuing the He 111 too low into Barrage balloons, Braham ended the chase and claimed a probable. Records <b>show</b> <b>only</b> one claim was made that night by an RAF fighter other than Braham, and German records list two bombers failing to return.|$|E
5|$|There {{were several}} {{reported}} attendance figures for Bound for Glory IV, {{with the initial}} attendance figure being 5,000 people before being retracted and updated {{to a total of}} 5,500 people by The Wrestling Observer Newsletter. This was lower than the maximum seating capacity available at the Sears Centre of between 11,000 and 11,800 people for festival style events. However, the Bound for Glory IV setup caused the event to only hold a maximum capacity of 8,000 people. Of the 5,500 that attended the <b>show,</b> <b>only</b> 4,500 of them were paid tickets. Despite this, it was seen as one of the largest paid crowds in the company's history {{and one of the most}} responsive crowds the company has had as well. The Wrestling Observer Newsletter reported that 35,000 people bought the event.|$|E

5|$|To {{ensure that}} the game goes ahead, glee club members Rachel (Lea Michele), Mercedes (Amber Riley), Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz) and Lauren (Ashley Fink) join the {{football}} team. The game begins badly for the McKinley side, and when Tina is injured during a play, captain Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) takes control of the situation. He has club member Puck (Mark Salling) convince the former football players to return, and convinces cheerleaders Santana (Naya Rivera), Brittany (Heather Morris) and his ex-girlfriend Quinn (Dianna Agron) to quit the cheer squad and perform at the halftime <b>show.</b> <b>Only</b> Karofsky refuses to participate, but {{when he sees the}} positive reaction the crowd has to the routine, he joins in himself. Beiste welcomes the football players back, and they go on to win the game by intimidating the opposing side, dressed as zombies from the halftime routine.|$|E
