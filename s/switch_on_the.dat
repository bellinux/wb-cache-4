5|$|As the {{breakdown}} happens, the soldiers bind {{her on the}} chair but she laughs, kicks and spits on them. Midst the aggressive fighting, the white Madonna takes a speargun and shoots the black Madonna squarely on the chest. The black Madonna falls down and concurrently a soldier pulls the <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> electric chair. They laugh loudly thinking Madonna to be burnt but as the smoke clears, they see that no remnants are to be found. They rush to inspect the chair closely and notice three letters (לאו) being burnt in the chair. They scratch their head and see {{a vision of a}} bearded man laughing at them. Madonna is shown running from the torture chamber and opens the door, as the video ends with the gun barrel sequence.|$|E
5|$|To {{ensure the}} mission to steal a Zero Point Module is a success, Dr. McKay (David Hewlett) proposes to use Dr. Weir (Torri Higginson) and her nanites to access the Asuran {{collective}} and guide them; should the Asurans take her over, McKay would activate a kill <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nanites, which would also effectively kill Weir. With their experimental jumper ready, Sheppard (Joe Flanigan) leaves Teyla (Rachel Luttrell) in command of Atlantis. The jumper's hyperdrive works and they arrive over the Asuran homeworld (M7R-227). With Weir's access, Sheppard and Ronon (Jason Momoa) easily steal the Zero Point Module. McKay then finds a code that will cause the Asurans to attack the Wraith and convinces Sheppard to upload a programme to reactivate this dormant code.|$|E

25|$|In cattle, the {{symptoms}} may include drooling, restlessness, uncoordination, urine retention, dysphagia, and sternal recumbency. Laterally recumbent animals are usually {{very close to}} death. In sheep, {{the symptoms}} may include drooling, a serous nasal discharge, stiffness, and incoordination. Abdominal respiration may be observed and the tail may <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side. As the disease progresses, the limbs may become paralyzed and death may occur.|$|E
25|$|South of the Brooklyn Bridge station, {{there is}} a <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{downtown}} local track, allowing trains to leave service and enter either of two storage tracks.

The uptown and downtown express tracks pass over the loop, continuing south.|$|E

25|$|The pistol {{is fired}} {{by a single}} action hammer, and has a manual safety <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> slide. The ambidextrous safety switch rotates a drum {{mechanism}} which sits over the firing pin, causing the firing pin to lock in, which prevents it from moving forward and reduces {{the possibility of the}} gun discharging accidentally. With the safety off, pulling the trigger releases the hammer to fall downward, hitting the firing pin and causing the chambered round to discharge.|$|E
25|$|The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{determined}} {{that the cause of}} the accident was pilot error. The pilots failed to <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> engines' internal ice protection systems, used reverse thrust in a snowstorm prior to takeoff, tried to use the jet exhaust of a plane in front of them to melt their own ice, and failed to abort the takeoff even after detecting a power problem while taxiing and visually identifying ice and snow buildup on the wings.|$|E
25|$|When flow {{starts from}} the {{uppermost}} outlet, cold water enters the tank at the bottom.

When the water at the top of the tank is drawn off the hot water at the top is displaced by relatively cooler water, the top thermostat turns the top element on.

The MULTI OUT connector (later used on the Nintendo 64 and GameCube) can output composite video, S-Video and RGB signals, as well as RF with an external RF modulator. Original versions additionally include a 28-pin expansion port under a small cover {{on the bottom of the}} unit and a standard RF output with channel selection <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back; the redesigned models output composite video only, requiring an external modulator for RF.|$|E
25|$|As {{well as his}} {{interest}} in the welfare of children, Tubridy has assisted in the promotion of other, more adult, initiatives, including the launch of a breast cancer initiative in May 2009. On 2 November 2011, he was MC and guest of honour for the launch of the Irish Film Archive Preservation Fund at the Irish Film Institute. The following month he helped <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Christmas lights on Grafton Street. In February 2015, he officially launched Galway's new Hand in Hand support centre which provides support and counselling services for parents of children with cancer.|$|E
25|$|Following the Challenger disaster, {{examination}} of the recovered vehicle cockpit revealed {{that three of the}} crew members Personal Egress Air Packs were activated: those of Onizuka, mission specialist Judith Resnik, and pilot Michael Smith. The location of Smith's activation <b>switch,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back side of his seat, means that either Resnik or Onizuka could have activated it for him. This is the only evidence available from the disaster that shows Onizuka and Resnik were alive after the cockpit separated from the vehicle. However, if the cabin had lost pressure, the packs alone would not have sustained the crew during the two-minute descent.|$|E

25|$|The {{historian}} Ibn Hawqal {{wrote about}} the invasion of 870, describing how the whole islands were depopulated. Modern scholars debate whether the invasion marked an outright “ethnic break and not merely a cultural and religious <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Maltese islands.” Little is known about Żejtun under Arab rule. Outside Mdina and possibly Birgu, hardly any village existed. However, a number of Late Medieval place-names in the general area of Żejtun, such as Bir id-Deheb, Ħajt il-Wied, Tal-Ħotba and Bulebel il-Kbir serve to highlight the intensity with which the area was used. One such name, il-Minżel, in Bulebel iż-Żgħir, can be translated as 'field at the descent' or the 'field at the house,' with the word manzil meaning a resting place, a place of alighting, settlement or abode. A large number of place-names implies the accessibility of the land, and therefore its use. Hence, the area was extensively used, with the Arabs using the established agroindustrial infrastructure {{as the basis for}} their presence in Malta and Gozo.|$|E
25|$|In October 1981, the Prince and Princess visited Wales. Diana {{attended}} the State Opening of Parliament {{for the first}} time on 4 November 1981. Her first solo engagement was a visit to Regent Street on 18 November 1981 to <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Christmas lights. She {{attended the}} Trooping the Colour {{for the first time}} in June 1982, making her appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace afterwards. The Princess made her inaugural overseas tour in September 1982, to attend the state funeral of Grace, Princess of Monaco. Also in 1982, Diana accompanied the Prince of Wales to the Netherlands and was created a Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown by Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands. In 1983, she accompanied the Prince on a tour of Australia and New Zealand with Prince William, where they met with representatives of the Māori people. Their visit to Canada in June and July 1983 included a trip to Edmonton to open the 1983 Summer Universiade and a stop in Newfoundland to commemorate the 400th anniversary of that island's acquisition by the Crown.|$|E
25|$|Airtemp {{was more}} {{sophisticated}} and efficient than the complicated rival air conditioners of 1953. It recirculated, rather than merely cooled, the air inside the vehicle, {{and it was also}} the highest capacity unit available on an automobile. It was also simple to operate, with a single <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dashboard marked with low, medium, and high positions, which the driver selected as desired. The system was capable of cooling a Chrysler from 120 degrees to 85 degrees in about two minutes, and of completely eliminating humidity, dust, pollen and tobacco smoke at the same time. Since it relied on fresh air, and drew in sixty percent more of it than any contemporary system, Airtemp avoided the staleness associated with automotive air conditioning at the time. It was silent and unobtrusive. Instead of plastic tubes mounted on the package shelf as on GM and on other cars, small ducts directed cool air toward the ceiling of the car where it filtered down around the passengers instead of blowing directly on them, a feature that modern cars have lost.|$|E
