25|$|These {{examples}} show that, in {{the absence}} <b>of</b> effective <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> laws, Gresham's Law works in reverse. If given the choice of what money to accept, people will transact with money {{they believe to be}} of highest long-term value. However, if not given the choice, and required to accept all money, good and bad, they will tend to keep the money of greater perceived value in their possession, and pass on the bad money to someone else. In short, {{in the absence}} <b>of</b> <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> laws, the seller will not accept anything but money of certain value (good money), while the existence <b>of</b> <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> laws will cause the buyer to offer only money with the lowest commodity value (bad money) as the creditor must accept such money at face value.|$|R

40|$|This {{article will}} explore the {{economics}} <b>of</b> <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> laws, arguing {{that they are}} not only a necessary prerequisite of paper money, but also benefit fractional-reserve banking. Such laws make paper money and fractional-reserve banking more widespread than they would otherwise be. Thus, <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> laws must be understood as {{a major factor in the}} development of Western economies which today operate on paper-money standards and feature very large fractionalreserve banking sectors that grow at over-proportional rates. 1 After a brief review of the literature, we will show that <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> laws entail the twin phenomena of fiat inflation and fiat deflation. This insight will be applied first to the analysis of bimetallism, arguing that fiat deflation in this case indirectly promotes the practice of fractional-reserve banking. Turning then to the case of money certificatesÑin particular, false money certificatesÑwe will demonstrate that <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> laws have very different effects depending on the physical characteristics of the certificates.
