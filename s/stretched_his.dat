5|$|Taking {{advantage}} of North Vietnam's period of recuperation in 1974, President Thiệu <b>stretched</b> <b>his</b> forces thin by launching offensives that retook {{most of the}} territory captured by PAVN forces during the land grab of 1973 and 15 {{percent of the total}} land area controlled by the communists {{at the time of the}} cease-fire. In April, Thiệu launched the Svay Rieng Campaign against communist strongholds in eastern Cambodia. This proved to be the last major offensive operation launched by the ARVN.|$|E

25|$|During {{this time}} Wilson's cavalry was very active on the Confederate left and rear, {{reaching}} past Granny White Pike. In response, Cheatham <b>stretched</b> <b>his</b> corps {{further and further}} to the south. Thomas, who was with Schofield, directed Schofield to make {{an attack on the}} western face of Shy's Hill. Schofield, imagining that he was outnumbered and in danger of an attack on his southern flank, demurred, requested that Smith send him additional divisions. Thomas directed Smith to comply with this request. Smith sent a division, and still Schofield did nothing.|$|E
25|$|As North Vietnam {{needed to}} {{replenish}} its {{armed forces in}} 1974, Thiệu decided {{to go on the}} attack. He <b>stretched</b> <b>his</b> own forces thinly by launching offensives that regained most of the territory captured by PAVN forces during the 1973 campaign, and retook 15% of the total land area controlled by the communists {{at the time of the}} cease-fire. In April, Thiệu launched the Svay Rieng Campaign against communist strongholds in eastern Cambodia near Tây Ninh, in what was the last major ARVN offensive. While these operations were successful, the cost in terms of manpower and resources was high. By the end of the year the military was experiencing equipment shortages as a result of decreased American aid, while communist forces continued to gain strength.|$|E
500|$|Napoleon {{advanced}} from Vitebsk, {{hoping to}} catch the Russian Army in the open where he could annihilate it. The French army was not positioned well for an extended overland campaign; it was [...] from its nearest supply base at Kovno (Kaunas). French supply lines were vulnerable and Cossacks, light cavalry, guerrilla forces and even French deserters attacked and seriously depleted French supply columns. The central French force under Napoleon's direct command had crossed the Niemen with 286,000men {{but by the time}} of the battle was reduced to 161,475, mostly through starvation and disease. Nonetheless, the prospect of a decisive battle lured Napoleon deeper into Russia and further <b>stretched</b> <b>his</b> supply lines.|$|E

500|$|Pohl <b>stretched</b> <b>his</b> {{budget by}} {{reducing}} the space he needed to fill with fiction. [...] For example, a long letter column took up several pages but required no payment; similarly, running advertisements for Popular's other magazines did not use up the fiction budget. [...] Some authors sent inaccurate word counts with the stories they submitted, and Popular saved money by paying them {{on the basis of}} whichever word count was lessthe author's or one done by Popular's staff. [...] The result was a saving of forty to fifty dollars per issue. [...] More money was saved by reusing snipped elements of black and white illustrations to fill space, as multiple uses of the same artwork did not require additional payments to the artist.|$|E
500|$|In 1903, Ueshiba {{was called}} up for {{military}} service. He failed the initial physical examination, being {{shorter than the}} regulation [...] To overcome this, he <b>stretched</b> <b>his</b> spine by attaching heavy weights to his legs and suspending himself from tree branches; when he re-took the physical exam he had increased his height by the necessary half-inch to pass. He {{was assigned to the}} Osaka Fourth Division, 37th Regiment, and was promoted to corporal of the 61st Wakayama regiment by the following year; after serving on the front lines during the Russo-Japanese War he was promoted to sergeant. He was discharged in 1907, and again returned to his father's farm in Tanabe. Here he befriended the writer and philosopher Minakata Kumagusu, becoming involved with Minakata's opposition to the Meiji government's Shrine Consolidation Policy. He and his wife had their first child, a daughter named Matsuko, in 1911.|$|E
500|$|In {{order that}} Hershiser {{and the rest}} of the staff could have their normal number of days of rest heading into the playoff series that could start as early as October 3, Hershiser pitched on only three days rest rather than making his regular start on September 24. The Dodgers entered the game with an 89–63 record and an 8-game lead in the NL West over the Cincinnati Reds, while the San Francisco Giants were 10.5 games back in fourth place in the {{division}} with a 79–74 record entering the game. With the September 23 win, the Dodgers retained an 8-game lead over the Reds. The victory reduced the Dodgers' magic number to two. The game marked Hershiser's eighth consecutive complete game and fifteenth of the season and Hershiser's fifth consecutive complete game shutout, which <b>stretched</b> <b>his</b> consecutive scoreless inning streak to 49. Following the game, Hershiser was quoted as saying [...] "I want to keep putting zeroes up there [...] not because of the streak, but for the team...I want to stay hot right up through the playoffs." ...|$|E

500|$|Yet {{the use of}} a teasing {{mechanical}} puppet in this wine-serving device wasn't {{exactly a}} novel invention of the Tang, since the use of mechanical puppets in China date back to the Qin dynasty (221–207 BC). In the 3rd century Ma Jun had an entire mechanical puppet theater operated by the rotation of a waterwheel. There was also an automatic wine-server known in the ancient Greco-Roman world, a design of the Greek inventor Heron of Alexandria that employed an urn with an inner valve and a lever device similar to the one described above. There are many stories of automatons used in the Tang, including general Yang Wulian's wooden statue of a monk who <b>stretched</b> <b>his</b> hands out to collect contributions; when the amount of coins reached a certain weight, the mechanical figure moved his arms to deposit them in a satchel. This weight-and-lever mechanism was exactly like Heron's penny slot machine. Other devices included one by Wang Ju, whose [...] "wooden otter" [...] could allegedly catch fish; Needham suspects a spring trap of some kind was employed here.|$|E
500|$|At 4:00 am on that Sunday morning, Frederick {{moved toward}} the Austrian right wing in four columns, with {{infantry}} in the inner two and cavalry in the outer two columns. Using the knolls to block his movements, Frederick shifted the two columns of infantry and one of cavalry obliquely to his own right. The leftmost column of cavalry remained behind to convince the Austrians {{that they were still}} approaching directly at the latter end of the Austrian line, near Frobelwitz. Their visible distraction screened Frederick's intent, which was to execute an oblique maneuver similar to that he had used to win only weeks earlier at the Battle of Rossbach. Prince Charles, watching from his vantage point, moved his entire reserve to his right flank. This not only weakened the left flank, but also <b>stretched</b> <b>his</b> front from Leuthen past Frobelwitz and on to Nippern, extending it well beyond its original [...] While a single column of cavalry mesmerized Charles at his farthest right flank, the rest of the Prussians continued undetected, behind those hills, across the Austrian front, and overreached (passed) the Austrian left wing.|$|E
500|$|The 1992 Hooters 500, {{the final}} {{race of the}} 1992 season, is {{considered}} one of the most eventful races in NASCAR history. It was the final race for Richard Petty and the first for Jeff Gordon. Sixdrivers were close enough in the points standings to win the championship that day. Allison led second-place Kulwicki by 30 points, Bill Elliott by 40, Harry Gant by 97, and Kyle Petty by 98 and needed to finish sixth or better to clinch the championship. Kulwicki received approval from NASCAR and Ford to change the [...] "Thunderbird" [...] lettering on his bumper for the race to [...] "underbird" [...] because he felt like the underdog in the contention for the championship. During Kulwicki's first pit stop, the first gear in the car's transmission broke. Andrews said, [...] "We had to leave pit road in fourth gear, because we had broken metal parts in there, and only by leaving it in fourth are you not going to move metal around as much. We could only hope that the loose piece of metal didn't get in there and break the gears in half. We had three or fourpit stops after it broke. I held my breath all day long." [...] Allison was racing in sixthplace, closely behind Ernie Irvan, when Irvan's tire blew with 73 (of 328) laps left in the event. As a result, Allison ran into the side of Irvan's spinning car and his car was too damaged to continue. Kulwicki and Elliott were left to duel for the title. While leading late in the race, Andrews calculated the exact lap for his final pit stop so that Kulwicki would be guaranteed to lead the most laps and would gain fivebonus points. Kulwicki made his final pit stop only after leading enough laps to guarantee the bonus points. To save time, the pit crew did a fuel-only pit stop. Not changing tires allowed them to be available to push the car to prevent it from stalling, since the car had to start moving in a higher gear. Because the team's fuel man hurried to add the gasoline during the quick stop, he did not add the desired amount into the tank. As a result, Kulwicki had to conserve fuel to ensure that his car was still running at the end of the race. Elliott won the race and Kulwicki <b>stretched</b> <b>his</b> fuel to finish second. Kulwicki won the 1992 Winston Cup Championship by maintaining his 10-point lead over Elliott. He celebrated the championship with his second Polish victory lap. Always conscious of his appearance for potential sponsors, Kulwicki combed his hair, making a national television audience wait for him to emerge from his car.|$|E

2500|$|The {{left flank}} {{consisted}} of the 386 officers and men of the 20th Maine regiment and the 83rd Pennsylvania. Seeing the Confederates shifting around his flank, Chamberlain first <b>stretched</b> <b>his</b> line {{to the point where}} his men were in a single-file line, then ordered the southernmost half of his line to swing back during a lull following another Confederate charge. It was there that they [...] "refused the line"formed an angle to the main line in an attempt to prevent the Confederate flanking maneuver. Despite heavy losses, the 20th Maine held through two subsequent charges by the 15th Alabama and other Confederate regiments for a total of ninety minutes.|$|E

2500|$|In {{reaching}} the Wimbledon final in 1981, Borg <b>stretched</b> <b>his</b> winning streak at the All England Club {{to a record}} 41 matches. In a semifinal, Borg was down to Connors by two sets to love, before coming back to win the match. However, Borg's streak was brought to an end by McEnroe, who defeated him in four sets. Years afterward, Borg remarked [...] "And when I lost what shocked me was I wasn't even upset. That was not me: losing a Wimbledon final and not upset. I hate to lose." [...] Borg around that time felt that his desire to play was gone, despite McEnroe's desperate efforts to persuade him not to retire and continue their rivalry.|$|E
2500|$|Taylor <b>stretched</b> <b>his</b> PDC World Championship unbeaten run to {{a record}} eight {{consecutive}} years beating Peter Manley in the 1999 and 2002 finals, Priestley for a fourth time in 2000, and John Part in 2001. Part would finally end the run by beating Taylor 7–6 (sets) in the 2003 World Championship final. Sid Waddell attributed this defeat to a weight-loss of three stone which he claimed affected Taylor's balance and resulted in him throwing [...] "a quarter to half an inch below the 60 bed". Taylor went into the game a 1/7 favourite with bookmakers, but Part raced into leads of 3–0 and 4–1. Taylor fought back before ultimately being defeated 7–6.|$|E
2500|$|Rounding out {{the infield}} was utility infielder Flea Clifton. [...] Clifton played in 43 games during the 1935 regular season, with a [...]255 batting average.

[...] Clifton was 0-for-16 with 4 strikeouts in the Series. [...] Clifton had been teammates with Hank Greenberg in the minor leagues, and the two became friends. [...] In his autobiography, Greenberg joked about Clifton's unusual diet: [...] "On the road, he used to eat nothing but doughnuts and bananas. He said they were cheap and filling and <b>stretched</b> <b>his</b> meal money. Flea was the only ballplayer who could show a profit on $1-a-day meal money." ...|$|E
