I kept {{stressing}} to Jermaine , ‘I {{got to do something}} for the kids.’ I had talked about it on the last album – and there was a song that I had, and it wasn’t quite completed. And I talked about it to the papers, gay magazines, and it didn't wind up on the album with the cut-off date. I felt really badly about that. <b>So</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> handed me a CD and said, ‘Here are 10 tracks for the kids; tell me which one you like the best.’ I fell in love with 'Rock With U'." ...|$|E
500|$|Broken was {{followed}} by the companion remix EP Fixed in late 1992. The only track that was left off {{the final version of the}} release is Butch Vig's remix of [...] "Last" [...] (the outro of the [...] "Last" [...] remix is heard in [...] "Throw This Away", which also includes Vig's remix of [...] "Suck"). [...] The unedited version appeared on the internet as an 8-bit mono 11kHz file, [...] "NIN_LAST.AIFF", available by FTP from cyberden.com in 1993; it has been removed from the website, but can still be found on p2p networks (Reznor subsequently made it available in higher quality (256kbit/s mp3) at remix.nin.com). [...] Vig later spoke about his remix while answering questions on a music production forum, saying [...] "I started recording a lot of new parts, and took it in a much different direction. When it was finished, Trent thought the front part of the mix didn't fit the EP, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> used the ending. I'm glad it's on his website. Duke and Steve worked with me on the remix, in the very early days of Garbage." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his year}} of success, Wallace became {{involved}} in a rivalry between the East and West Coast hip hop scenes with Shakur, now his former friend. In an interview with Vibe in April 1995, while serving time in Clinton Correctional Facility, Shakur accused Uptown Records' founder Andre Harrell, Sean Combs, and Wallace of having prior knowledge of a robbery that resulted in him being shot five times and losing thousands {{of dollars worth of}} jewelry on the night of November 30, 1994. Though Wallace and his entourage were in the same Manhattan-based recording studio {{at the time of the}} shooting, they denied the accusation. Wallace said: [...] "It just happened to be a coincidence that he [...] was in the studio. He just, he couldn't really say who really had something to do with it at the time. <b>So</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> kinda' leaned the blame on me." [...] In 2012, a man named Dexter Isaac, serving a life sentence for unrelated crimes, claimed that he attacked Shakur that night and that the robbery was orchestrated by James Rosemond aka Jimmy Henchman.|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe Tom Roland {{stole the}} gold," [...] began Earl, [...] "but Guardley was willing he should, and he {{remained}} on guard around the tent while Roland dug it up, <b>so</b> <b>he's</b> <b>just</b> as guilty." ...|$|R
50|$|Barney {{realizes that}} the game is real, the clock is running, and his neighbors - aliens in {{disguise}} - {{will do anything to}} get the Piggy. Each tries to bribe him with a unique incentive, similar to the Judgement of Paris, but Barney turns them down. Unfortunately by doing <b>so,</b> <b>he's</b> <b>just</b> entered the real game as a player representing the human race.|$|R
60|$|GERALD. Nothing <b>so</b> deep. <b>He's</b> <b>just</b> {{a sort of}} AEolian harp that sings to the temper of the wind. I {{find him}} amusing.|$|R
500|$|Henning Solberg, meanwhile, {{went off}} the road and into a ditch as he entered one of the corners on the stage, and his brother Petter had a similar problem in the same corner, but his quick {{reactions}} were able to control the car <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> drove into the scrub and got back on track. Henning finished in seventeenth place, and Petter finished joint-fifth with Cuoq on [...] Loeb ran his slowest time on this stage after he reduced speed and his tyres went cold. [...] "I was a bit faster than Dani [...] on the start of the stage, and then I saw my splits [...] and then I tried to slow down," [...] he explained. [...] "We had hard tyres and when you slow down the tyres [...] and then you lose the grip more and more, and at the end it was really tricky and I had cold tyres, so I just tried to slow down. The end [...] was really tricky so I didn't want to take any risks." [...] was won by Hirvonen with a time of [...] Loeb was 1.2s slower and finished second. Atkinson lost all the time he made up in [...] by finishing in eighth place, [...] slower than Hirvonen. This reduced the gap between the two in the overall classifications to just [...] Sordo, meanwhile, had his worst stage and finished in [...]|$|E
2500|$|Pianist – Weebl {{is shocked}} when Bob {{introduces}} him, {{but only because}} he heard [...] "penis" [...] rather than [...] "pianist" [...] (and, indeed, {{this is what is}} written in Bob's speech bubble). He can't actually play <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> hums the tune.|$|E
2500|$|Armstrong's first guitar was a Cherry Red Hohner acoustic, {{which his}} father bought for him. He {{received}} his first electric guitar, a Fernandes Stratocaster that he named [...] "Blue," [...] {{when he was}} ten year old. His mother got [...] "Blue" [...] from George Cole who taught Armstrong electric guitar for 10 years. Armstrong says in a 1995 MTV interview, [...] "Basically, it wasn't like guitar lessons because I never really learned how to read music. <b>So</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> {{taught me how to}} put my hands on the thing." [...] Cole bought the guitar new from David Margen of the band Santana. Cole gave Armstrong a Bill Lawrence L500XL Humbucker pickup and told him to install the pickup in the bridge position. Armstrong switched the L500XL with a white Seymour Duncan SH-4 JB Humbucker at Woodstock '94. After the Seymour Duncan was filled with mud and ruined in November 1994, Armstrong reinstalled the original Bill Lawrence pickup before recording Insomniac in 1995, and used {{it for a long time}} after that, although he has since switched to a black Seymour Duncan SH-4 JB. [...] "Armstrong fetishized his teacher's guitar, partly because the blue instrument had a sound quality and Van Halen-worthy fluidity he couldn't get from his little red Hohner. He prized it mostly, however, because of his relationship with Cole, another father figure after the death of Andy." [...] He toured with this guitar from the band's early days and still uses it to this day, Both middle and neck pickups are disconnected and the pickup selector locked in the bridge position. [...] "Blue" [...] also appears in a number of Green Day music videos such as [...] "Longview", [...] "Basket Case", [...] "Geek Stink Breath", [...] "Stuck with Me", [...] "Brain Stew/Jaded", [...] "Hitchin' a Ride", and most recently in [...] "Minority".|$|E
60|$|Bob Pretty {{just gave}} one look and then 'e dropped 'is pipe {{and set off}} like a hare. It was no good {{dropping}} the sack, because Smith, the keeper, 'ad recognised 'im and called 'im by name, <b>so</b> <b>'e</b> <b>just</b> put 'is teeth together and did the best he could, and there's no doubt that if it 'adn't ha' been for the sack 'e could 'ave got clear away.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir, not the words. But {{the voices}} they sounded awful. And one other gentleman 'e come along from the dining-room, {{and asked me}} what the noise was about. There ain't many members now at the Veterans', sir, and being a foggy night we was partik'lar quiet. But this gentleman 'e was curious about the noise, <b>so</b> <b>'e</b> <b>just</b> opened the smoking room door and peeped in, and then I did 'ear a few words." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will put}} up there," [...] he cried; [...] "it {{is a fine}} position, with plenty of fresh air." [...] <b>So</b> <b>he</b> alighted <b>just</b> between {{the feet of the}} Happy Prince.|$|R
60|$|John {{understood}} {{now that}} this was only her way of being glad, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> patted her shoulder and got her a chair, {{and waited for her}} to dry her eyes.|$|E
6000|$|Now Peter couldn't say [...] "yes" [...] {{for that}} would be an untruth, and {{whatever}} faults Peter may have, he is at least truthful. <b>So</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> pretended not to have heard Sammy's question.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, that {{staggered}} him a bit; {{but there}} didn't seem {{anything else to}} be done, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> made as if he thought it funny, though I doubt if {{at the time he}} saw the full humour of it.|$|E
60|$|He seemed surprised--very inconsistently <b>so,</b> as <b>he</b> had <b>just</b> {{told me to}} go.|$|R
60|$|Reddy Fox didn't say a word, <b>he</b> was <b>so</b> ashamed. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> {{crept up}} the Lone Little Path to his home, {{dragging}} his tail, all wet and muddy, behind him, and dripping water all the way.|$|R
50|$|During the 37-36 win, Pittsburgh's Ben Roethlisberger {{threw for}} 503 passing yards. In doing <b>so</b> <b>he</b> became <b>just</b> the 10th quarterback since 1950 to throw for 500 or more {{yards in a}} game and the first Steeler to do so.|$|R
60|$|Once more poor Mrs. Quack {{was quite}} {{overcome}} with her troubles and sorrows. Peter wished {{with all his}} heart {{that he could do}} something to comfort her, but of course he couldn't, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> sat still and waited until she could tell him just what did happen to Mr. Quack.|$|E
60|$|Reddy Fox crawled painfully {{out onto}} his doorstep. He {{tried to stand}} and walk, but he couldn't {{because he was too}} stiff and sore. <b>So</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> crawled. He didn't know that anyone was {{watching}} him, and with every movement he made a face. That was because it hurt so.|$|E
60|$|They were in {{the grove}} now, close by the stile, and when the last words fell reluctantly from Jo's lips, Laurie dropped her hands and turned as if to go on, but for once in his life the fence {{was too much for}} him. <b>So</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> laid his head down on the mossy post, and stood so still that Jo was frightened.|$|E
6000|$|What {{does the}} enemy say? [...] "Kolossal Verdam! [...] They told me, {{when the war}} began, [...] The British Tommy always ran, [...] And <b>so</b> <b>he</b> does, <b>just</b> as they said, [...] But, Donnerwetter! it's {{straight}} ahead, [...] Like a ram." ...|$|R
5000|$|After [...] "Sequel", Chapin once {{joked that}} if he wrote a third act to the song, {{that it would be}} called [...] "Hearse" [...] <b>so</b> <b>he</b> could <b>just</b> kill off the characters. Chapin died some seven months after [...] "Sequel" [...] peaked.|$|R
60|$|Another {{moment and}} hands were being heartily shaken with the insides. But David did not linger. Nodding pleasantly to the tiger, {{he held up}} both hands. Being <b>so</b> tall, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> managed to reach those of Susan, as she stood up in the rumble.|$|R
6000|$|A furtive tapping {{was heard}} at the door. It was Ronny-On, who had skulked forward with twopence, but Gavinia {{answered}} his knock, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> said, [...] "Ay, Gavinia, it's yoursel'. Well, I'll be stepping," [...] {{and would have}} retired had not Miss Ailie caught him. Even then he said, [...] "Three bawbees is to you to lay by, and one bawbee to Gavinia no to tell." ...|$|E
60|$|Therefore behold {{our hero}} {{alighting}} at Novara, two hours late, on a wet, dark evening. He hoped Lilly would be there: but nobody. With some slight dismay {{he faced the}} big, crowded station. The stream of people carried him automatically through the barrier, a porter having seized his bag, and volleyed various unintelligible questions at him. Aaron understood not one word. <b>So</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> wandered after the blue blouse of the porter.|$|E
60|$|In {{a little}} while Gudu screamed loudly: 'I am burnt! I am burnt!' though he was not burnt at all. Now, though Isuro had the leaves about him, he did not dare to produce them {{at the last moment}} lest the baboon should guess why he had stayed behind. <b>So</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> went round a corner for a short time, and then came hopping back in a great hurry. But, quick though he was, Gudu had been quicker still, and nothing {{remained}} but some drops of water.|$|E
5000|$|The {{subject matter}} of the album was {{inspired}} by Thao Nguyen's relationship with her estranged father, who [...] "left when I was maybe 11 or 12, my parents split up. And <b>so</b> <b>he</b> kinda <b>just</b> floated away but you never knew when he would come back and you never knew when <b>he</b> would <b>just</b> leave." ...|$|R
5000|$|Charles Mingus narrates {{pieces of}} his own story. Born from a half-black/half-Swedish father and a half-black/half-Chinese mother (later having a half-black/half-Indian step-mother), Mingus tried to be all types of races but found he was a misfit that didn't belong anywhere; <b>so</b> <b>he</b> says <b>he's</b> <b>just</b> a negro. <b>He</b> sums this up stating: [...] "In a society which sends {{messages}} that are racists capitalists, and have Judaeo-Christian ethic roots, the transmission of these messages to Black people can lead to socializing of their young with non-complementary values." [...] He plays the cello.|$|R
5000|$|Furlan {{was lined}} {{up to be the}} first {{opponent}} of what was being billed as [...] "The Homecoming" [...] of Irish fighter John Duddy in Dublin, Ireland. Furlan stated {{that he was going to}} spoil Duddy’s homecoming and upset his perfect record because he had spotted a weakness in Duddy's style and was going to expoilt that. Furlan was quoted as saying [...] "“I have great respect for John Duddy but I will come with my own tactical plan to beat him. He is tough and not afraid of anyone <b>so</b> <b>he’s</b> <b>just</b> like me in that respect. I will be out to spoil his homecoming but I’ll buy Duddy a pint of Guinness afterwards to apologise for beating him!".|$|R
60|$|Danny didn't answer. The fact is, he was {{too frightened}} to answer. Besides, he didn't know what he could do. <b>So</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> kept still, but his bright eyes never once left Reddy's cruel face. For all his fright, Danny was doing some hard thinking. He had been in tight places before and had learned never to give up hope. Something might happen to frighten Reddy away. Anyway, Reddy had {{to get him out}} of that old can before he would admit that he was really caught.|$|E
60|$|My, my, my, how old Mrs. Possum did scold, as {{she came}} down the great hollow tree to get the two eggs. Unc' Billy knew that he {{deserved}} every bit of it. He felt very miserable, and he {{was too tired to}} have a bit of spirit left. <b>So</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> sat {{at the foot of the}} great hollow tree and said nothing, while old Mrs. Possum bit a hole in the end of one egg and began to suck it. All the time she was looking at Unc' Billy with those sharp eyes of hers. When she had finished the egg, she pushed the other over to him.|$|E
60|$|But {{the lobster}} {{would not let}} go. Tom saw the {{fisherman}} haul {{him up to the}} boat-side, and thought it was all up with him. But when Mr. Lobster saw the fisherman, he gave such a furious and tremendous snap, that he snapped out of his hand, and out of the pot, and safe into the sea. But he left his knobbed claw behind him; for it never came into his stupid head to let go after all, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> shook his claw off as the easier method. It was something of a bull, that; but you must know the lobster was an Irish lobster, and was hatched off Island Magee at the mouth of Belfast Lough.|$|E
60|$|As he was {{charitable}} in this proposal, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> was <b>just</b> in {{the performance}} to a tittle; for he ordered the seamen that none should touch anything that I had: then he took everything into his own possession, and gave me back an exact inventory of them, that I might have them, even to my three earthen jars.|$|R
5000|$|Porridge co-star Ronnie Barker {{commented on}} Beckinsale's {{premature}} death, saying: [...] "He was <b>so</b> loved. <b>He</b> hadn't done much but <b>he</b> was <b>so</b> loved {{that there was}} a universal sort of grief that went on." [...] When asked to comment on his death years later, Kate Beckinsale said, [...] "It was <b>so</b> sudden. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> went to sleep one night, and didn't wake up again." [...] Beckinsale was cremated at Mortlake Crematorium.|$|R
60|$|What do {{you think}} happened? Why, he was rolled over on to his feet <b>so</b> gently that <b>he</b> <b>just</b> gasped with surprise. It didn't seem {{possible}} that such a great paw could be so gentle.|$|R
