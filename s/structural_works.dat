5000|$|In his {{influential}} dissertation entitled [...] "Human {{adjustment to}} floods," [...] published in 1945 by the University of Chicago Department of Geography, White argued that an overreliance on <b>structural</b> <b>works</b> in the United States had actually increased damage by flooding, rather than decreasing them. He argued famously {{in this work}} - deemed by several commentators {{to be the most}} important contribution made by a geographer in 20th-century North America (Hinshaw 2006, Kates 2007) - that [...] "Floods are an act of God, but flood losses are largely an act of man". Public confidence in <b>structural</b> <b>works</b> increased occupance of, and building on floodplains. Design standards are sometimes inappropriate, and overconfidence develops, resulting in worse disasters if a flood breaches defences. A recent and relevant example of the impacts of undue confidence in <b>structural</b> <b>works</b> can be seen in Hurricane Katrina's impact on New Orleans, during the summer of 2005. Historically, at least in the USA, works were built to certain design specifications (for example, the 100-year flood, or 1% flood). In instances where the design specifications were exceeded (in the case of a 150-year flood, etc.), they failed, thus causing catastrophic loss in overdeveloped floodplains (White et al., 1958).|$|E
