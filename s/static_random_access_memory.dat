25|$|Dynamic {{random access}} memory {{is a type of}} {{random access memory}} that stores each bit of data in a {{separate}} capacitor within an integrated circuit. Since real capacitors leak charge, the information eventually fades unless the capacitor charge is refreshed periodically. Because of this refresh requirement, it is a dynamic memory as opposed to <b>static</b> <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> and other static memory. In 1966 DRAM was invented by Robert Dennard at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center.|$|E

50|$|The IXP1200 {{integrates}} a StrongARM SA-1100-derived {{core and}} six microengines, which were RISC microprocessors with an instruction set optimized for network packet workloads. The StrongARM core performed non-real-time functions while the microengines manipulated network packets.

50|$|The {{external}} secondary unified cache supported capacities between 512 KB and 16 MB. It {{is implemented}} with commodity synchronous <b>static</b> <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memorys</b> (SSRAMs). The cache is accessed via its own 128-bit bus that {{is protected by}} 9-bits of error correcting code (ECC). The cache and bus operate at the same clock rate as the R10000, whose maximum frequency was 200 MHz. At 200 MHz, the bus yielded a peak bandwidth of 3.2 GB/s. The cache is two-way set associative, but to avoid a high pin count, the R10000 predicts which way is accessed.|$|R
50|$|A {{next step}} in {{speeding}} routers {{was to have a}} specialized forwarding processor separate from the main processor. There was still a single path, but forwarding no longer had to compete with control in a single processor. The fast routing processor typically had a small FIB, with hardware memory (e.g., <b>static</b> <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> (SRAM)) faster and more expensive than the FIB in main memory. Main memory was generally dynamic random access memory (DRAM).|$|E
50|$|The design steps (or flow) {{are also}} common to {{standard}} product design. The significant {{difference is that}} standard-cell design uses the manufacturer's cell libraries {{that have been used}} in potentially hundreds of other design implementations and therefore are of much lower risk than full custom design. Standard cells produce a design density that is cost effective, and they can also integrate IP cores and SRAM (<b>Static</b> <b>Random</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Memory)</b> effectively, unlike Gate Arrays.|$|E
50|$|FIFOs are {{commonly}} used in electronic circuits for buffering and flow control between hardware and software. In its hardware form, a FIFO primarily consists {{of a set of}} read and write pointers, storage and control logic. Storage may be <b>static</b> <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> (SRAM), flip-flops, latches or any other suitable form of storage. For FIFOs of non-trivial size, a dual-port SRAM is usually used, where one port is dedicated to writing and the other to reading.|$|E

This memory may be battery-backed <b>static</b> <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory,</b> flash memory or EEPROM.

The Preliminary F8 Microcomputer Data Book from Fairchild Semiconductor carries the date June 27, 1975. A Guide to Programming the Fairchild F8 Microcomputer also carries the date June 27, 1975. Another document titled A Timeshare Users Guide for the Fairchild F8 Microcomputer was published August 7, 1975 as Revision A. In September 1975 Fairchild published User's Manual F8 Design Evaluation Kit Number 1. These documents were meant to accompany the Fairchild F8 Design Evaluation Kit 1 which was being sold to engineers. Kit 1 was an 8-bit microprocessor on a single circuit board. The board had three 40-pin ICs: F3850, F3851, F3853. The F3850 held the Central Processing Unit. The F3851 held a Read-Only Memory that contained a program called Fairbug.

The game was developed over the course of nine months from conception to completion. The team working on the game expanded to as much as seven programmers {{at the height of the}} game's development. The graphics and animation for the game were created in Maya. Some of the original animation and textures from Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped were repurposed and used as a basis for the Game Boy Advance game. The sprite for the Crash Bandicoot character features between 1000 and 1500 frames of animation. The audio for the game was supplied by Shin'en Multimedia, with Manfred Linzner creating the sound effects and Todd Masten composing the music. Shin'en Multimedia was assisted by Universal Sound Studios while creating the game's audio. The game uses a <b>static</b> <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> battery, allowing the player to save their progress. The game was designed with battery saving in mind from the beginning of production, as keeping track of all the data would prove extremely cumbersome with a password system.|$|E
