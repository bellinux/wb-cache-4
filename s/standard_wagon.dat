5000|$|In 1891, Fisher {{bought a}} {{partnership}} in <b>Standard</b> <b>Wagon</b> Works, a carriage factory. [...] He eventually bought out his partner and continued the business alone. The company was notable for building the first fleet of wagons for the Detroit News in 1894. Henry Ford was a customer of <b>Standard</b> <b>Wagon</b> Works and had commissioned Fisher {{to build the}} body for “Ford's Contraption”. Ford asked Fisher to build 50 bodies, offering payment {{in the form of}} stock in his company, the same payment he was offering the Dodge Brothers to build motors. The conservative Fisher considered the offer too speculative and insisted on cash. Fisher's business continued to grow as he built bodies for Oldsmobile and other new automobile manufacturers.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} enable the free {{exchange}} of goods wagons between the different state railway administrations, the German State Railway Wagon Association (Deutscher Staatsbahnwagenverband or DSV) was formed in 1909.

50|$|The {{distinction}} with UIC Class U wagons is fluid. Especially when wagons do {{not conform}} to the UIC <b>standard</b> <b>wagon</b> or only have a roof hatch for loading instead of a movable roof, they count as special wagons. Many French grain wagons therefore have a 9 instead of a 0 in their wagon numbers.|$|E

50|$|The present-day <b>standard</b> <b>wagon</b> for moisture-susceptible palletised goods has sliding sides {{rather than}} fixed side walls, which enables {{access to the}} entire loading area for loading and unloading. These wagons with sliding walls or sides did not evolve from the {{original}} covered wagon, but were derived in the 1950s from wagons with sliding roofs and sides, {{which is why they}} used to be grouped in Class K.|$|E

5000|$|The {{implementation}} of these guidelines is partly binding and partly voluntary {{for members of}} the UIC. Since the end of 1977, flat wagons that partially conform to these guidelines are identified by the designation [...] "UIC". Flat beds that comply fully with the leaflets, and are therefore true UIC <b>standard</b> <b>wagons,</b> are given the designation [...] "UIS St".|$|R

50|$|When {{they first}} entered service, the iced wagon fleet was painted white with black text and underframe, and silver roofs. This helped {{to keep the}} wagons cool but it was {{difficult}} to keep them clean, so from around 1910 the livery changed to the <b>standard</b> <b>wagon</b> red (though the roof was painted in a tan scheme, to help identify iced wagon roof hatches from above). The five TP wagons fitted with passenger bogies were painted in Passenger Red.|$|E
50|$|Born in Norwalk, Ohio, Charles was {{the second}} son of Lawrence and Margaret Fisher. The family would grow to include seven boys and four girls. At {{the turn of the}} 20th century, eldest son Fred was the first to move to Detroit where an uncle, Albert Fisher, had {{established}} <b>Standard</b> <b>Wagon</b> Works during {{the latter part of the}} 1880s. A year later Charles Fisher joined his brother as an employee at the C. R. Wilson Company, a manufacturer of horse-drawn carriage bodies who were just beginning to construct bodies for the automobile makers.|$|E
5000|$|A {{key issue}} is the loading gauge of routes for freight in sea-going (9' 6" [...] in height, 2500 mm in width) containers. Such loads are {{accommodated}} on routes cleared to W10 on <b>standard</b> <b>wagons.</b> W12 is only slightly wider than W10, and the Freight RUS recommends that where structures are renewed the starting assumption should be that they are cleared to W12.|$|R
50|$|This is {{the largest}} group of flat wagons both in terms of variety and numbers. Their {{classification}} as special wagons arises either as a result of not having a wagon deck that is drivable or due to their axle count. Unlike the <b>standard</b> <b>wagons,</b> these flats are predominantly optimised for a specific purpose. In 1998 the DB had about 22,000 Class S wagons in its fleet.|$|R
50|$|Container wagons are flats {{specially}} {{fitted with}} securing equipment for transporting ISO containers. Depending on their design {{they may be}} grouped into classes L, R or S. Class K wagons are rarely used because even an 8 foot (2.591 m) high ISO container exceeds the European loading gauge. The presence of container pins is always indicated by the index letter g. Only general purpose wagons {{that have to be}} specially prepared for container transport and have a drivable floor, are classed as <b>standard</b> <b>wagons.</b> Wagons that are exclusively used for container transport are classified as special types. In the latter case, the profile of the wagon underframe is left open and the container only rests on the beams and the trunnions.|$|R
50|$|As buffers were {{phased out}} of all trains in the late 50's to early 60's the Z vans began to develop riding quality issues caused by the excess slack in {{couplings}} {{along the length of}} trains. Guards reported being thrown around and injured by the rough riding. Trains had previously typically run up to 45 wagons' length, where a <b>standard</b> <b>wagon</b> length was around 12 to 15 feet. With automatic couplers becoming the new standard, that had increased gradually up to 74 wagons plus van, doubling the slack forces that needed to be absorbed.|$|E
50|$|The German State Railway Wagon Association (Deutscher Staatsbahnwagenverband) or DWV was an {{association}} of the German state railways Länderbahnen founded in 1909. The purpose of the association was to guarantee the unrestricted exchange of goods wagons between the member railway administrations. The German State Railway Wagon Association could, unlike the Prussian State Railway Wagon Association, stipulate <b>standard</b> <b>wagon</b> designs {{for the whole of}} Germany. It developed a total of eleven different wagon types, the Verbandsbauart (literally: association type) or DWV wagons. In addition to entire goods wagons, types of bogie were also specified.|$|E
50|$|An {{experimental}} bogie open, coded 'Tourn', {{was built}} in 1889. 36 ft long, it was two-planks high but soon raised to four planks and rated to carry 25 tons. From 1925 the <b>standard</b> <b>wagon</b> length for four-wheeled wagons was increased to 17.5 ft to meet Railway Clearing House standards. A number of longer wagons were constructed for special traffics such as metal tubes or lengths of timber and given the telegraphic code 'Tube C'. The first of these, built in 1907, were 25 ft long and rated at 14 tons; from 1945 they were 30 ft long and could carry 21 tons.|$|E

5000|$|The European, British and Australian wagons {{were also}} {{available}} with a dual-range manual transmission, not {{offered in the}} USA or Japan. In Germany, the extended roof wagon was called the Super Station and was available with either the 2.2 or 1.8-liter engine, ABS brakes were available only on German vehicles with the 2.2-liter engine, and the <b>standard</b> <b>wagon</b> was called the Legacy Station with a 1.8-liter engine only. Subarus were not officially sold in France until February 1992. Fuel efficiency ratings for European models (2.2L, non-turbo, 4WD and manual transmission) are [...] at 90 km/h, [...] at 120 km/h, and [...] at city speeds, according to the 1991 European sales brochure.|$|E
50|$|In 1904 and 1905, the two eldest brothers, Fred and Charles, came to Detroit {{where their}} uncle Albert Fisher had {{established}} <b>Standard</b> <b>Wagon</b> Works {{during the latter}} part of the 1880s.

With financing from their uncle, on July 22, 1908 Fred and Charles Fisher established the Fisher Body Company. Their uncle soon wanted out and the brothers obtained the needed funds from Detroit businessman Louis Mendelssohn who became a shareholder and director. Within a short period of time, Charles and Fred Fisher brought their five younger brothers into the business.|$|E
