25|$|PETA is {{critical}} of television personalities they call self-professed wildlife warriors, arguing that while a conservationist message is getting across, some of the actions are harmful to animals, such as invading animals' homes, netting them, subjecting them to stressful environments, and wrestling with them—often involving young animals the group says <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> their mothers. In 2006 when Steve Irwin died, PETA's vice-president Dan Mathews said Irwin had {{made a career out}} of antagonizing frightened wild animals. Australian Member of Parliament Bruce Scott said PETA should apologize to Irwin's family and the rest of Australia.|$|E

Robin later returns to the vault to see Regina, and he kisses her, breaking his code to be loyal to Marian.|$|E
25|$|Surgical removal is the {{treatment}} of choice, but chest x-rays should be taken first to rule out metastasis. Removal <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> wide margins to prevent recurrence, taking the whole mammary gland if necessary. Because 40 to 50 percent of dog mammary tumors have estrogen receptors, spaying is recommended by many veterinarians. A recent study showed a better prognosis in dogs that are spayed {{at the time of}} surgery or that had been recently spayed. However, several other studies found no improvement of disease outcome when spaying was performed after the tumor had developed. Chemotherapy is rarely used.|$|E

25|$|Depending on {{the nature}} of the first detection, policy- or {{decision-makers}} might have the opportunity to make a conscious decision about composing and sending a message. The ambiguity and content of signals sent both to and from Earth would have profound implications for what actions needed to be taken. A PDP that did not take signal comprehensibility into account would not be flexible enough to inform appropriate action. The area of SETI research known as CETI (Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence), is concerned with how humankind should carry out this communication and, to some extent, representation problems such as whether a response <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> one collective voice or if anyone with access to a transmitter should have the right to communicate.|$|E

It happened overnight and I couldn't think of anything but our friends and our situation.

Fellow cast member Leisha Hailey has commented that Jenny is at her best when she is spiraling out of control. Hillary Frey of The New York Observer opined that Jenny provided [...] "voyeuristic pleasure" [...] for straight females in season one. She said she believed Jenny's confusion to whom she <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> was plausible. Also adding the fact she gradually became self-obsessed – yet still conveyed the [...] "thrill and pleasure of a fresh sexual experience", while portraying the sadness.|$|E
500|$|Despite her {{popularity}} with the viewers, Carmella was negatively received by Ruth Deller of television website Lowculture. On {{how to get}} the magic back into Neighbours, Deller said [...] "Axe Carmella. Or at least make her a nun again, which was the only time she was interesting". Deller also said she would have rather seen Carmella and Marco leave the show instead of Rosetta and Frazer. The Liverpool Daily Post said that they had seen implausible storylines in the serial, but Carmella seeing Marco's ghost [...] "takes the biscuit". However, they concluded [...] "At least he offers Carmella some much-needed support." [...] The Daily Record said the ghost scenes were more unforgettable than Bouncer's dream. On the subject of her funeral song they added: [...] "Oddly, none of her friends think she's gone mad, despite an impromptu version of 'Amazing Grace'." [...] Readers of Inside Soap were asked who Oliver <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> out of Carmella and Elle. Carmella came first with sixty-six percent of the vote.|$|E
500|$|On May 27, {{the website}} Talking Points Memo posted a {{handwritten}} letter by Sestak to candidates declaring his intent {{to run for}} Senate. Sestak did not dispute {{the authenticity of the}} letter, but told the press he wanted to discuss the matter with his family before making a formal decision. Sestak told media outlets he realized President Obama wished him not to run against Specter, but that he felt the choice <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> the voters of Pennsylvania rather than the president. Governor Rendell overtly tried to convince him not to run, believing it would damage Sestak's own political future, plus cost the Democratic Party both Sestak's House seat and possibly damage Specter's general election chances. Nevertheless, Sestak formally declared his candidacy for the Democratic nomination on August 4, 2009, in a speech before a Veterans of Foreign Wars hall in his native Delaware County. Shortly after the announcement, Toomey issued a statement welcoming Sestak to the race, describing him as [...] "a consistent liberal who really believes in his values", as compared to Specter, who he called [...] "a career political opportunist who believes in nothing but his own re-election".|$|E

500|$|Although the {{characters}} were separated on screen, they had gained a fan {{base on the}} Internet that believed Martha <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> Jack and wanted the pair to reunite. Gordon herself backed the pairing, stating that she believed they should be together. She said: [...] "I actually love Jack and Martha together, I'm a sucker for romance so, I want {{want them to be}} together [...] I want them to continue on, [...] the timing is not right, they are not mature enough. Jack's in a relationship with someone else as Martha is, there just seems to be things {{getting in the way of}} them getting back together all the time." [...] Gordon also hoped for a happy ending for the two characters if they were to ever leave the serial adding: [...] "If I had it my way, and I got to write the scripts then I'd make it happily ever after, Martha and Jack riding off into the sunset." [...] Gordon has spoken of her understanding from the audiences point of view, that together Jack and Martha are [...] "the ultimate couple". She also reiterated her belief that it would be to tough at the time of Martha's downward spiral for them to work together, but if Martha is to get through her troubles and have a happy ending, that it would be with Jack. The Daily Telegraph commented on the Martha and Jack situation, saying it is played out in a [...] "classic soapie technique". They said [...] "Bring {{the characters}} together, push them apart, but always leave open the possibility that they could get back together. It has worked for Days of Our Lives John Black and Marlena Evans".|$|E
500|$|The {{miscarriage}} leaves Steffy devastated and {{she decides}} to leave town, ending her marriage to Liam. Wood noted that [...] "Steffy was so set on she really messed this up" [...] and noticed that Liam still had feelings for Hope. Speaking of the miscarriage {{and the end of}} Liam and Steffy's marriage, Wood explained: [...] "She is obviously trying a reason to get out of it. In her heart and soul, she wants to be with him. She felt he was her soulmate, but with everything that has happened, she feels it was her fault and she can't change that. She should never have gotten on that motorcycle and he told her not to. There have been so many things that happened that it opens her eyes to the possibility that maybe he <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> Hope." [...] Upon Steffy's brief return to the show in 2015, she realizes that she still loves Liam, despite believing that these feelings were gone. Wood explained [...] "They lost a child together, so they’ll always have that emotional connection." [...] Despite liking the fact that Steffy [...] "speaks up" [...] and [...] "fights for love", Wood said that she wanted [...] "to see someone come in and sweep her off her feet and take that pain away", not wanting her to fight for [...] "a man that flip flops". However, Liam is involved with Steffy's cousin Ivy Forrester (Ashleigh Brewer) and Steffy does not win him back. Wood noted that [...] "in Steffy's mind, Ivy is just some new woman in town and Liam is fair game. He and Ivy have no history." [...] Eventually Liam breaks up with Ivy and after Steffy's marriage to Wyatt breaks down, Steffy and Liam rekindle their love and romance and they marry each other again for the third time.|$|E

I'm not anti-gay. We're against gay marriage. I don't want gays to be discriminated against." [...] She added, [...] "I don't know why all gays aren't Republican.

[...] Subsequently, {{in the aftermath of}} a RFEF meeting board, Spain and Portugal announced their intention to bid together. Spanish sports newspaper Marca advanced some details about the potential bid: Spain would lead a twelve-stadium project with eight of the venues, and the opening and final games would be held in Lisbon and Madrid, respectively.

In Latin prius is the neuter singular of the comparative form (prior, prior, prius) of an adjective with only comparative and superlative (the superlative being primus, prima, primum). Consequently, like all third declension words, the plural in Latin was priora (cf. Latin declension) which was used by the Lada Priora in 2007.|$|E

They may feel better when they know, or think they know, how they became disturbed, because insights can feel useful and curative. But {{it is unlikely that}} people will actually get better and stay better unless they have and apply insight 3, which is that there is usually no way to get better and stay better except by continual work and practice in looking for and finding one’s core irrational beliefs; actively, energetically, and scientifically disputing them; replacing one’s absolute [...] "musts" [...] (rigid requirements about how things <b>should</b> <b>be)</b> <b>with</b> more flexible preferences; changing one's unhealthy feelings to healthy, self-helping emotions; and firmly acting against one’s dysfunctional fears and compulsions.
