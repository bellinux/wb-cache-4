5|$|Croup {{is usually}} {{deemed to be}} due to a viral infection. Others use the term more broadly, to include acute laryngotracheitis, <b>spasmodic</b> <b>croup,</b> {{laryngeal}} diphtheria, bacterial tracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis. The first two conditions involve a viral infection and are generally milder with respect to symptomatology; the last four are due to bacterial infection and are usually of greater severity.|$|E
500|$|Viral croup or acute laryngotracheitis is most {{commonly}} caused by parainfluenza virus (a {{member of the}} paramyxovirus family), primarily types 1 and 2, in 75% of cases. Other viral causes include influenza A and B, measles, adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). <b>Spasmodic</b> <b>croup</b> {{is caused by the}} same group of viruses as acute laryngotracheitis, but lacks the usual signs of infection (such as fever, sore throat, and increased white blood cell count). [...] Treatment, and response to treatment, are also similar.|$|E
500|$|The word croup {{comes from}} the Early Modern English verb croup, meaning [...] "to cry hoarsely"; the name was first applied to the disease in Scotland and popularized in the 18th century.

Viral croup was then called [...] "faux-croup" [...] by the French and often called [...] "false croup" [...] in English, as [...] "croup" [...] or [...] "true croup" [...] then most often referred to the disease caused by the diphtheria bacterium. False croup has also been known as pseudo croup or <b>spasmodic</b> <b>croup.</b> Croup due to diphtheria has become nearly unknown in affluent countries in modern times due to the advent of effective immunization.|$|E

40|$|Background: Historically croup was {{subdivided}} into classic 'viral' croup with associated viral URTI, and recurrent or <b>spasmodic</b> <b>croup</b> where asthma and allergies were thought more important. Subjects and methods: All children {{admitted to the}} University Hospital of Wales with croup in 2003 were eligible. Baseline demographics including croup score were recorded and per-nasal swabs taken for virus detection by RT-PCR. Recurrent croup was defined as {{at least one other}} admission for croup in the preceding or following 3 years. Results: Sixty (29. 4 %) children entered the study, and a viral pathogen was detected in 41 (68 %). There {{was no significant difference in}} the rate of virus detection between those with single episode croup and recurrent croup. Conclusions: The aetiology of 'viral' and recurrent croup appears similar...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: We {{performed}} a retrospective review {{to determine the}} utility of bronchoscopy in patients with recurrent croup (RC). Methods: Bronchoscopy was performed on 30 patients with a diagnosis of RC (age, 14 months to 13. 9 years) over a 2 -year period. Results: One third of the patients (33. 3 %) {{were found to have}} airway disorders, including subglottic stenosis (7), sub-glottic edema (2), and a subglottic cyst (1). Patients with RC who were less than 3 years of age {{were more likely to have}} an airway abnormality found on endoscopy (9 of 14 or 64. 2 %) than were those older than 3 years (1 of 16 or 6. 2 %; χ 2, p < 0. 001). There was no statistically significant difference in abnormal findings 1) in patients with RC who had a history of prematurity or prior intubations (χ 2, p = 0. 17 and p = 0. 052, respectively); 2) between infectious and <b>spasmodic</b> <b>croup</b> (χ 2, p = 0. 794); or 3) by number of croup episodes (χ 2, p = 0. 300). Two patients required surgical intervention (laryngo-tracheal reconstruction and marsupialization of a subglottic cyst). Conclusions: Of 30 patients who underwent bronchoscopy for RC, 33 % had airway disorders — mostly children less than 3 years old. We suggest a higher index of suspicion for finding airway disorders in children less than 3 years old with RC and having a lower threshold for performing diagnostic bronchoscopy in this population...|$|E
40|$|Introduction:  In {{uncontrolled}} asthma, comorbid conditions {{should be}} treated {{in order to achieve}} better asthma control. The contribution of gastro-esophageal reflux (GER) may be overlooked when its presentation is atypical.  Case Report:   11 year-old male with moderate persistent asthma and allergic rhinitis presented with persistent barky cough, diagnosed as <b>spasmodic</b> <b>croup</b> after bronchoscopy, esophagram, swallow study and magnified airway x-ray failed to show anatomical abnormality. Empiric proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment was started with improvement in cough. Patient was referred to Gastroenterology for evaluation of GER, despite lack of heartburn or vomiting. Endoscopy revealed esophageal candida infection which was treated. The cough however, was felt to be secondary to allergic rhinitis and reactive airway disease, thus PPI was discontinued. Impedance, pH probe or esophageal manometry were not performed. Off of PPI, patient developed frequent dyspnea, wheezing, increased requirement for albuterol and systemic corticosteroids. Bronchoscopy revealed edematous, friable, hyper-reactive airway mucosa, with negative bacteria and fungi cultures. PPI was re-started with significant decrease in wheezing, dyspnea and cough.  Discussion:  Uncontrolled allergic rhinitis, sinus disease and traditionally presenting GER are accepted comorbid conditions leading to poor asthma control. Empiric treatment of “silent GER” has remained a controversial issue. GER is a risk factor for increased severity of chronic rhinosinusitis and asthma. An association exists between neutrophilic asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis and GERD. History of GERD is among strongest predictive factors for early asthma readmissions. Atypical GER presentation should not deter consideration for treatment.  Conclusion:  This case illustrates importance of treating GERD in uncontrolled asthma, even without traditional gastro-esophageal symptoms...|$|E
