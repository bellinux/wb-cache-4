5|$|Thompson {{returned}} {{to file a}} lawsuit in Tennessee state court in October 2003 {{on behalf of the}} victims of two teenage stepbrothers who had pleaded guilty to reckless homicide, endangerment, and assault. Since the boys told investigators they were inspired by Grand Theft Auto III, Thompson sought $246 million in damages from the publisher, Take-Two Interactive, along with PlayStation 2 maker Sony Computer Entertainment America and retailer Wal-Mart. The suit charged that the defendants knew or <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> the game would cause copycat violence. On October 22, 2003, the case was removed to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee. Two days later, the plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal, and the case was closed.|$|E
25|$|In 2010 the Stoddart family filed a {{civil lawsuit}} against the Idaho School District. They claimed that the school was negligent and <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> Draper and Adamcik posed a threat to others. Both the civil court and the State Supreme Court {{dismissed}} the case, saying {{the actions of the}} killers were not foreseeable.|$|E
25|$|By 11pm the patrols {{reached a}} main road heading east to Barce {{and they went}} on with their {{headlights}} full on, pretending to be an Axis convoy. At the top of an escarpment leading to the Barce plains they came across two L3 tankettes parked guarding {{each side of the}} road. The LRDG vehicles opened up with heavy machine gun fire as they raced through. The tankettes were caught unprepared, although the crews <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> night traffic had been forbidden. By midnight the LRDG were at the crossroads outside Barce and the two patrols separated to carry out their tasks. They were allocated two hours by Major Easonsmith who, with his two HQ jeeps, would proceed independently around Barce, looking for suitable targets. Major Peniakoff and the Guard's wireless truck stayed at the crossroads to deal with any attempts at stopping the LRDG's withdrawal.|$|E

50|$|In most cases, the {{essentials}} {{to bring an}} action of misfeasance in public office are that the office-holder acted illegally, knew they were doing so, and <b>knew</b> or <b>should</b> reasonably <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> third parties would suffer loss as a result.|$|R
500|$|In 2011, Rae, Ste and Brendan's romance plot won the [...] "Best Love Triangle" [...] {{accolade}} at the All About Soap Bubble Awards. Rae's murder {{earned a}} nomination for [...] "Spectacular Scene of the Year" [...] at the 2012 British Soap Awards. Holy Soap said that Rae's most memorable moment was being {{locked in a}} cupboard and subsequently revealing herself to be cursed. Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury called Rae's interest in Ste a mystery, noting his violent history and homosexuality as reasons Rae should have avoided him. Anthony D. Langford of AfterElton said that Hollyoaks {{had no interest in}} Rae as a character, and no desire to [...] "make her a real fleshed out person". He added that Rae had no common sense because [...] "no woman would regularly leave her man alone {{for long periods of time}} with the guy she knows he had an affair with." [...] He also said that Rae <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> Ste and Brendan's affair had resumed.|$|E
500|$|Investigators {{also cited}} the flight {{engineer}} {{for failing to}} calculate the [...] "minimum approach/landing fuel quantity." [...] The report references the 360° turn that the flight was ordered to make at 20:54 {{as evidence that the}} crew <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> they were being treated routinely and not given any emergency priority. Instead, the CVR revealed that the flight crew was convinced that they were being given priority. Additionally, the NTSB criticized the first officer for failing to use the word [...] "emergency" [...] as the captain had insisted he do. Compounded with the apparent inability of the captain to hear or understand the radio communications, the NTSB called the situation a [...] "total breakdown in communications by the flightcrew." [...] Summarizing, the investigators cited [...] "the flightcrew's failure to notify ATC of their fuel situation while holding at CAMRN in order to ensure arrival at the approach fix with an adequate approach minimum fuel level and a breakdown in communications between the flightcrew and ATC, and among the flight crewmembers" [...] as the two main factors that led to the crash.|$|E

2500|$|In the suit, the SEC {{specifically}} names William Finklestein, who was Vice President and CFO at {{the time}} of the allegation, claiming “As CFO, Finkelstein directed the offsetting of cash against debt. He also reviewed and signed the quarterly report.” Linda Wachner was also named in the suit as she was President and CEO {{at the time}}. In the its press release announcing the settlement of the suit, the commission stated “at the time she approved and signed the 1998 annual report, Wachner knew or <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> the restatement of the company's financial results was caused by material flaws in the cost accounting and internal control systems at one of the company's largest divisions and was not related to the write-up of deferred start-up or start-up related costs." [...] The commission also found that [...] "Wachner knew or <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> the division's inventory costing control system was inadequate to ensure the accuracy of Warnaco's books and records and failed to ensure that proper internal controls were in place.” Stanley P. Silverstein, who was Warnaco’s general counsel at the time was also named, as he, too, signed off on the report.|$|E

2500|$|With {{regard to}} {{mishandling}} of classified information, Comey said, [...] "there {{is evidence that}} they [...] were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information." [...] The investigation found 110 emails {{that should have been}} regarded as classified at the time they were sent; another 2,000 emails were retroactively classified which means they were not classified at the time they were sent. Comey said that [...] "any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton's position, or in the position of those government employees with whom she was corresponding … <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> an unclassified system was no place for that conversation." ...|$|E

2500|$|While Quon {{could have}} had some {{expectation}} of privacy, Kennedy continued, {{it could not have}} been enough to prevent a review of the messages.

And, in particular, since the city had purchased pagers for SWAT team members to improve their performance in that capacity, it was reasonable to expect that the city might audit those pagers to assess the performance of both the units and the pagers in SWAT situations.|$|E

2500|$|One {{area where}} {{complaints}} about interest charges has gone beyond revealed truth as interpreted by Islamic scholars concerns the external debt of developing countries, where {{in some cases}} the borrowers have already paid the sum they borrowed [...] "several times, but the debt grows faster than they can repay it". Some heavily indebted countries include Afghanistan, Comoros, Guinea, Malawi, São Tomé and Príncipe. The movement for debt forgiveness (Jubilee 2000) does not argue that interest itself is sinful but that both interest and principle of large external loans should be forgiven because: debt repayment would be better spent on poverty reduction, lenders <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> the borrowing countries poor inhabitants are not responsible for the debt because it was lent to dictators or oppressive regimes, with much of the money was lost to corruption and [...] wasteful projects.|$|E
2500|$|Testimony {{before the}} British inquiry {{revealed}} that at 10:10p.m., Californian observed {{the lights of}} a ship to the south; it was later agreed between Captain Stanley Lord and Third Officer C.V. Groves (who had relieved Lord of duty at 11:10p.m.) {{that this was a}} passenger liner. At 11:50p.m., the officer had watched that ship's lights flash out, as if she had shut down or turned sharply, and that the port light was now visible. Morse light signals to the ship, upon Lord's order, were made between 11:30p.m. and 1:00a.m., but were not acknowledged. [...] If Titanic were as far from the Californian as Lord claimed, then he knew, or <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known,</b> <b>that</b> Morse signals would not be visible. [...] A reasonable and prudent course of action would have been to awaken the wireless operator and to instruct him to attempt to contact Titanic by that method. [...] Had Lord done so, it is possible he could have reached Titanic in time to save additional lives.|$|E
2500|$|On December 2, 2010, Picard sued JPMorgan Chase, seeking {{damages and}} {{restitution}} {{of at least}} $6.4 billion. [...] The suit was initially sealed due to confidentiality concerns on Chase's part, but both parties agreed to unseal it on February 3, 2011. [...] The suit alleges that Chase knew or <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> Madoff's wealth management business was a fraud. [...] However, Chase didn't report its concerns to regulators or law enforcement until October 2008, when it told the UK Serious Organised Crime Agency that the performance of Madoff's investments was [...] "too good to be true." [...] The suit also claimed that Chase bankers were making profitable deals with Madoff even as risk management executives {{expressed concern about the}} nature of Madoff's business. [...] It also claimed that Chase officials knew that Friehling & Horowitz wasn't peer reviewed or registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (it subsequently emerged that the Friehling firm had stated in writing {{for more than a decade}} that it didn't conduct audits). [...] Almost as seriously, Picard charged that Chemical/Chase's retail bankers failed to perform even basic oversight of Madoff's banking activities, despite several transactions dating as far back as the 1990s that raised the appearance of money laundering or check kiting. [...] Picard argued that even a cursory glance at Madoff's account activity at Chase would have revealed his business could not possibly have been legitimate. [...] He also argued that even after Chase reported its concerns about Madoff's performance to UK officials, it didn't put any restrictions on Madoff's banking activities until his arrest two months later.|$|E

50|$|Due {{diligence}} is also {{a concept}} found in the civil litigation concept of a statute of limitations. Frequently, a statute of limitations begins to run against a plaintiff when <b>that</b> plaintiff <b>knew</b> or <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> plaintiff investigated the matter with due diligence that the plaintiff had a claim against a defendant. In this context, the term “due diligence” determines the scope of a party’s constructive knowledge, upon receiving notice of facts sufficient to constitute “inquiry notice” that alerts a would-be plaintiff that further investigation might reveal a cause of action.|$|R
