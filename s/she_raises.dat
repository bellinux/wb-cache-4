5|$|Gaga, with {{shoulder}} and facial protrusions (prosthetic makeup mimicking subdermal implants) walks in {{a seemingly endless}} black space, where people are {{on their hands and}} knees in an organized pattern. <b>She</b> <b>raises</b> her hand and crouches down to join them. When the first verse begins, everyone dances to choreography. The scenes alternate between the dance, and Gaga singing on her throne in space. In the second verse, Gaga and Rico are in tuxedos, with her face painted to mirror his. Alternating clips show Gaga caressing and attempting to dance with him while he stays expressionless and motionless for the most part. When the chorus plays for the second time, Gaga sings in a room of mirrors, with her head displayed in a glass box among oddly distorted mannequin heads. In the succeeding shots, she is once again shown on her throne giving birth to more members of the new race. After choreographed routines by Gaga and her dancers, they all gather in a circle and embrace in a hug.|$|E

500|$|Actress {{and model}} Sherri Stoner {{served as the}} {{performance}} model for Belle, providing live-action reference for the animators as they drew the character. Belle's tendency to constantly brush her hair {{away from her face}} was also inspired by both Stoner and O'Hara. [...] "I was constantly doing that and little quirky things that they would catch," [...] O'Hara told The Guardian. The animators also incorporated O'Hara's eyes, cheekbones {{and the way in which}} <b>she</b> <b>raises</b> her eyebrow into Belle's face. O'Hara felt that Belle originally looked [...] "too perfect," [...] likening the character's appearance to actresses Elizabeth Taylor and Angelina Jolie. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Charles Solomon observed inconsistencies in Belle's appearance, writing, [...] "The prettiest and liveliest Belle waltzes with Beast in his marble ballroom and weeps over his body before he's transformed into the Prince" [...] while [...] "The Belle who receives the library from Beast has wider-set eyes and a more prominent mouth than the noticeably slimmer Belle who sings 'Something There'".|$|E

Although both Clair and Cliff counsel, admonish and oftentimes outwit their children together, dividing their parental responsibilities equally, Clair tends to serve as primary disciplinarian to her children – and occasionally to Cliff as well.

500|$|... "I Stay in Love" [...] is a [...] "beat-driven" [...] and [...] "piano-laced" [...] ballad, that is {{influenced}} by pop and R music genres. The song's instrumentation is derived from a piano melody, and is backed by a strong computerized drum-beat. It is composed in the key of D major, with Carey's vocals spanning from the low note of D3 to the high note of G5. The song moves at a slow tempo of 65 beats per minute in cut time, and it follows a chord progression of D–Bm7–G–A. [...] The song features a [...] "double voice" [...] effect during its final chorus, where Carey's normal singing tone {{throughout the rest of}} the song is combined with her raised pitch. <b>She</b> <b>raises</b> the pitch one octave, and layers it over her normal tone. Lyrically, the song finds Carey getting [...] "her cry on with the connect-the-dots break-up track." [...] She describes the old time she shared with her lover. She also admits that even though they did attempt to save their relationship, and that she knows that it is definitely over, she still [...] "stays in love with him".|$|E

[...] The King receives {{a gift from the}} king of Burma, a lovely slave girl named Tuptim, to be one of his many wives. [...] She is escorted by Lun Tha, a scholar who has come to copy a design for a temple, and the two are secretly in love. [...] Tuptim, left alone, declares that the King may own her, but not her heart ("My Lord and Master"). [...] The King gives Anna her first audience. The schoolteacher is a part of his plan for the modernization of Siam; he is impressed when she already knows this. [...] <b>She</b> <b>raises</b> the issue of her house with him, he dismisses her protests and orders her to talk with his wives. [...] They are interested in her, and she tells them of her late husband, Tom ("Hello, Young Lovers"). [...] The King presents her new pupils; Anna is to teach those of his children whose mothers are in favor with him – several dozen – and is to teach their mothers as well. [...] The princes and princesses enter in procession ("March of the Royal Siamese Children"). [...] Anna is charmed by the children, and formality breaks down after the ceremony as they crowd around her.|$|E

However [...] her failure to present either official Palestinian or public Palestinian/Israeli opinions and attitudes within the context of Israel's (settler) nationalist-archaeological discipline means that answers to the excellent questions <b>she</b> <b>raises</b> are never made clear." ...|$|E
2500|$|... is a century-old witch {{who lives}} in the human world. She serves as Ruby's {{guardian}} and the main antagonist in the story involving the Witch's Knoll. She bears a great contempt for humans because they expanded into her territory. When land developers announce plans to turn her field into a garbage dump, <b>she</b> <b>raises</b> monster plants to attack tourists and then sets her army of plants to destroy the city. Like Ruby, her magic revolves around ravens and flora, the latter of which she can extend vines from her fingers to use as a weapon. She can also permanently merge with living creatures and acquire their powers. She is defeated when her magic object spellbook is destroyed, and as she dies she experiences a delusion where she is forgiven and rejoined by Ruby; in the anime, she is already dead but causes Ruby to have a delusion where she is receiving orders from her. Oyakata is voiced by Toshiko Maeda in the Japanese anime.|$|E
