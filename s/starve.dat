5|$|Don't <b>Starve</b> is a 2013 open world, {{survival}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} the Canadian indie company Klei Entertainment. The game was initially released via Valve Corporation's Steam software for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux on April 23, 2013. A PlayStation 4 port, renamed Don't Starve: Giant Edition, became available the following year (with PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 3 versions released on September 2014 and June 2015 respectively, and an Xbox One version released in August 2015). Don't <b>Starve</b> for iOS, renamed Don't Starve: Pocket Edition was released on July 9, 2015. Android version was released on October 20, 2016. Downloadable content titled Reign of Giants was released on April 30, 2014, and a multiplayer expansion called Don't <b>Starve</b> Together became free for existing users on June 3, 2015.|$|E
5|$|Burning houses {{suspected}} of being partisan meeting places and poisoning water wells became common practice for soldiers of the German 9th Army. At Kharkov, the fourth largest city in the Soviet Union, food was provided only to {{the small number of}} civilians who worked for the Germans, with the rest designated to slowly <b>starve.</b> Thousands of Soviets were deported to Germany to be used as slave labor beginning in 1942.|$|E
5|$|Don't <b>Starve</b> Together {{made its}} debut on Steam's Early Access program on December 15, 2014. It {{supports}} up to six players at a time, who can be either existing friends or strangers and can play in public or private games. The expansion contains most, if not all, features of the single-player game, but with ongoing balance patches being made for multiplayer. The game was officially released out of early access on April 21, 2016.|$|E

[...] This <b>starving</b> did work beautifully, and freed him from a great many [...] severe colds. Now he says it wasn't the <b>starving</b> that helped his [...] colds, but the trust in the <b>starving,</b> the mind cure connected with [...] the <b>starving.</b>|$|R

5|$|Mourning doves can be {{afflicted with}} several {{different}} parasites and diseases, including tapeworms, nematodes, mites, and lice. The mouth-dwelling parasite Trichomonas gallinae is particularly severe. While a mourning dove will sometimes host it without symptoms, it will often cause yellowish {{growth in the}} mouth and esophagus that will eventually <b>starve</b> the host to death. Avian pox is a common, insect-vectored disease.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish army {{surrounded}} Copenhagen, {{hoping to}} <b>starve</b> it into submission. This failed when the Dutch Republic joined the conflict on the Danish {{side and a}} reinforcing fleet managed to smash {{its way through the}} Swedish naval forces in Øresund. Charles then tried a decisive assault on the city, hoping to conquer it and win the war; this plan likewise failed. Brandenburg, Poland and Austria then also joined the war against the Swedes.|$|E
5|$|There was {{in various}} transatlantic {{countries}} such {{an abundance of}} maize, that the farmers had to burn it as fuel in their railway engines. At {{the same time the}} ships in Europe were idle, for there were no cargoes. Simultaneously there were thousands, nay millions of unemployed. All this, while thirty million people in the Volga region—not far away and easily reached by our ships—were allowed to <b>starve</b> and die.|$|E

40|$|Arterial [...] venous {{differences}} for metabolites across liver, kidney and hindquarters were measured in fed or <b>starved,</b> artificially ventilated chickens. The {{results indicate that}} the liver takes up amino acids under both conditions. Urate and glucose are released by the liver in both the fed and the <b>starved</b> state. Lactate and amino acids are extracted from blood by the kidneys, and this increases in the <b>starved</b> chicken. Urate is removed from the circulation by the kidney in the fed and <b>starved</b> state and excreted. In the fed bird there is no significant arteriovenous difference of glucose across the kidney, but in the <b>starved</b> state the kidney releases glucose into the circulation. The hindquarters take up glucose in the fed but not in the <b>starved</b> state. The branched-chain amino acids valine and leucine were taken up by the hindquarters in the fed, but not the <b>starved,</b> chicken. Glycerol is released by the hindquarter of fed and <b>starved</b> chickens. In the <b>starved</b> state, alanine and glutamine represent 57 % of the amino acids released by the hindquarter. Lactate is released by the hindquarter of <b>starved</b> chickens and represents the major gluconeogenic carbon source released by the hindquarter and taken up by kidney and liver. Although the liver is the major gluconeogenic organ in the <b>starved</b> chicken, the kidney accounts for approx. 30 % of the glucose produced...|$|R
40|$|The O {{consumption}} of brains from frogs <b>starved</b> for 60 days was examd. Brain and liver from well-​fed frogs consumed 400. 8 and 309. 9 μl of 0 ​/g​/hr, resp. The resp. values for <b>starved</b> subjects were 213. 8 and 67. 7 μl. of 0 ​/g​/hr. Adding exts. of <b>starved</b> tissue to well-​fed tissue decreased greatly the O {{consumption of}} the latter. Exts. from well-​fed brain added to <b>starved</b> ext. increased {{the activity of the}} latter significantly. Thus, there may be a metabolic inhibitor in the brain of <b>starved</b> frogs and a stimulating factor in the brain of well-​fed frogs...|$|R
5|$|We were {{informed}} of {{the prospect of a}} shortening in food rations. 300 grams of meat or sausage per week. Once the Führer asserted he had the right to require sacrifices because he himself was ready to accept any personal sacrifice. If now the idea came into his head to <b>starve</b> to death, then I would not want to take away his right to ask all his fellow fighters to do the same.|$|E
5|$|After Roger and Alexander's arrests Nigel {{defied the}} king. The bishops' castles refused to {{surrender}} to the king, therefore Stephen threatened to <b>starve</b> Alexander and Roger until they did. Sleaford and Newark surrendered and were given into the custody of Robert, the Earl of Leicester. Earl Robert also seized some of Lincoln's episcopal estates that had been disputed between the earl and the bishop. Alexander subsequently excommunicated Earl Robert when the earl refused to return the castle to Alexander's custody. Alexander then successfully applied to Pope Innocent II in 1139 for support {{in his efforts to}} recover Newark castle from Earl Robert.|$|E
5|$|Bergonzoli {{knew that}} if Bardia and Tobruk held out, a British advance further into Libya {{eventually}} must falter under the logistical difficulties of maintaining a desert force using an extended overland supply line. Not knowing how long he had to hold out, Bergonzoli was forced to ration his stocks {{of food and water}} so that O'Connor could not simply <b>starve</b> him out. Consequently, hunger and thirst adversely affected the morale of the Italian defenders that had already been shaken by the defeat at Sidi Barrani. So too did medical conditions undermine morale, particularly lice and dysentery, the results of poor sanitation.|$|E
50|$|A <b>starving</b> {{artist is}} an artist who sacrifices {{material}} well-being in order to focus on their artwork. They typically live on minimum expenses, either {{for a lack of}} business or because all their disposable income goes toward art projects. Related terms include <b>starving</b> actor and <b>starving</b> musician.|$|R
50|$|A {{prominent}} local landmark, <b>Starved</b> Rock, {{stands on}} the south {{bank of the river}} directly opposite the Grand Village site. Explorer La Salle founded a fort there to be near this village. <b>Starved</b> Rock is also a National Historic Landmark and is included in <b>Starved</b> Rock State Park.|$|R
40|$|Polysomes were {{isolated}} from livers of rats fed various diets and were translated in a protein-synthesizing system derived from cultured Chang liver cells. One of the labeled products {{was identified as}} complete subunit(s) of fatty acid synthetase by indirect immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the solubilized immunoprecipitate. The relative amounts of fatty acid synthetase synthesized by polysomes from livers of rats fed a normal diet, <b>starved</b> rats, and rats <b>starved</b> and refed a fat-free diet for 16 hr were 1, 0. 1, and 10, respectively. Induction of synthesis of fatty acid synthetase after fat-free refeeding of <b>starved</b> rats began by 2 hr (3 -fold increase over <b>starved</b> animals), was increasing rapidly by 5 hr (19 -fold over <b>starved</b> animals), and reached a high level by 16 hr (95 -fold over <b>starved</b> and 10 -fold over normally fed) ...|$|R
5|$|Between 1145 and 1146 Stephen {{made another}} attempt to seize Wallingford, but was again unable to take the castle despite {{building}} a powerful counter-castle to the east, opposite Wallingford at Crowmarsh Gifford, and building castles to the west at Brightwell, South Moreton and Cholsey. He returned with larger forces in 1152, reestablishing the counter-castle at Crowmarsh Gifford and building another one overlooking Wallingford bridge, and settled his forces down to <b>starve</b> the castle out. Brien, supported by Miles' son, Roger of Hereford, who had also become trapped in the castle, attempted {{to break through the}} blockade, but without success.|$|E
5|$|Don't <b>Starve</b> was Klei's {{first foray}} into the {{survival}} genre. Conceived {{during the height of}} a game industry trend of dropping players into a world with few instructions and a goal of survival, the game was influenced by Minecraft, which spearheaded this trend, as well as by filmmaker Tim Burton. The game received positive reviews from critics; commended for its original art style, music, and variety of ways for the player to die, although its high level of difficulty and implementation of permanent death were less warmly received.|$|E
5|$|Faced with dwindling attendances, the Kilcoynes {{decided to}} <b>starve</b> {{the club and}} sold off senior players who were {{replaced}} by junior footballers. On a tour of Japan in 1975, Mick Meagan and Theo Dunne’s young side defeated the Japanese national team 3–2 in front of 60,000 spectators at the Olympic Stadium, but that victory was the highlight of a season that saw the team finish bottom {{of the table and}} re-apply for admission into the League of Ireland.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} starvation on the course of Listeria monocytogenes infections in mice. Mice <b>starved</b> for 24, 48, or 72 h and then inoculated with a lethal dose of L. monocytogenes showed significantly less mortality than mice not <b>starved</b> (i. e., fed mice). The protective effect of 48 or 72 h of starvation began immediately after the starvation period and persisted for at least 48 h. <b>Starved,</b> infected mice had significantly fewer L. monocytogenes cells in their spleens 2, 3, and 4 days after infection than did fed mice. Neither changes in T-lymphocyte function nor serum factors appeared {{to be responsible for}} the protective effect. Delayed hypersensitivity responses to L. monocytogenes antigen were smaller in <b>starved</b> mice than in fed mice. Adoptive transfer of spleen cells from nonimmune <b>starved</b> mice did not protect against L. monocytogenes. Additional studies indicated that the serum of <b>starved</b> mice did not inhibit multiplication of L. monocytogenes in vitro, nor was it able to transfer protection against L. monocytogenes to normal mice. In contrast, peritoneal macrophages from <b>starved</b> mice inhibited deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis of P 815 tumor cells compared with macrophages from control mice. Therefore, the resistance of <b>starved</b> mice to L. monocytogenes is most likely due to nonspecific factors, one of which may be activation of macrophages...|$|R
40|$|Protein {{synthesis}} {{and degradation}} rates in diaphragms from fed or <b>starved</b> rats were compared in vivo and in vitro. For fed rats, synthesis rates in vivo were approximately twice those in vitro, but for <b>starved</b> rats rates were similar. Degradation rates were less in vivo than in vitro in diaphragms from either fed or <b>starved</b> rats...|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} to erythropoietin (ESF) was studied in normal <b>starved,</b> polycythemic, and <b>starved</b> polycythemic rats. Starvation markedly reduces this response in normal and polycythemic rats. Disappearance rate of ESF is normal and no inhibitor is detectable in the plasma of <b>starved</b> rats. Experimental {{data suggest that}} starvation decreases the ESF sensitive stem cell pool. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
5|$|In June 2013, {{shortly after}} the game's main release, a PlayStation 4 version was announced; {{it would not be}} {{released}} until January of the following year. In a January 2014 interview, Rollins mentioned internal discussions of creating a PlayStation Vita version of Don't <b>Starve,</b> citing massive community interest in playing it on the PlayStation 4 remotely. An iOS edition was released in July 2014. The company is also considering other mobile phone adaptations, as well as a potential sequel, but is not prioritizing them.|$|E
5|$|The Storm Creek {{fire started}} on June 14 well {{north of the}} park in the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness, and for almost two months seemed to pose little threat to Yellowstone. Then, on August 20, the fire moved rapidly to the south also {{threatening}} the town of Cooke City, this time from the north. An effort to bulldoze a wide fire break and set backfires to try to <b>starve</b> the fires of combustibles almost led to disaster when an unexpected change in wind direction brought the fires to within a hundred yards of parts of the town, forcing evacuations on September 6.|$|E
5|$|The parents {{care for}} young birds {{for two or}} three months after they fledge, but from August to November the juveniles {{disperse}} to find a territory of their own to occupy. If they fail to find a vacant territory, they usually <b>starve.</b> The juvenile survival rate is unknown, but the annual survival rate for adults is 76.8%. The typical lifespan is five years, but an age of over 18 years has been recorded for a wild tawny owl, and of over 27years for a captive bird.|$|E
50|$|On March 10, 2004 the <b>Starved</b> Rock Lock and Dam {{was listed}} on the National Register of Historic Places as the <b>Starved</b> Rock Lock and Dam Historic District. It was listed {{as part of the}} Illinois Waterway Navigation System Facilities Multiple Property Submission. <b>Starved</b> Rock was deemed {{eligible}} for the listing {{when the rest of the}} Illinois Waterway was also determined eligible; the day <b>Starved</b> Rock Lock and Dam was listed the other 7 lock and dam sites on the Waterway were also {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic Places.|$|R
50|$|With {{the growth}} of {{competitive}} sites, Walther struggled to keep the complex economically stable. In 1911, he sold the land to the Illinois State Parks Commission for $146,000. The Commission was initially headquartered at <b>Starved</b> Rock State Park after the land was acquired. The state initially acquired 898 acres and opened <b>Starved</b> Rock State Park as a public facility in 1912.During its early years, <b>Starved</b> Rock State Park was directly accessible only by railroad. Visitors had reached <b>Starved</b> Rock by rail and ferry since at least 1904, while the property was still a Walther-run resort. Between 1904 and 1908 more than 160,000 people used the ferry that connected <b>Starved</b> Rock to the electric railway line. In 1912, the year the park was opened to the public, attendance was 75,000. By the 1930s other state parks were opened in Illinois but <b>Starved</b> Rock State Park remained the most extensively used park in the system.|$|R

5|$|The {{tawny owl}} or brown owl (Strix aluco) is a stocky, {{medium-sized}} owl {{commonly found in}} woodlands across much of Eurasia. Its underparts are pale with dark streaks, and the upperparts are either brown or grey. Several of the eleven recognised subspecies have both variants. The nest is typically in a tree hole where it can protect its eggs and young against potential predators. This owl is non-migratory and highly territorial. Many young birds <b>starve</b> if they cannot find a vacant territory once parental care ceases.|$|E
5|$|This set {{the pattern}} for the six-year {{conflict}} between the Ottomans and Venice over control of Thessalonica. While the Ottomans blockaded and attacked Thessalonica from land, trying to <b>starve</b> it into surrender, the Republic sent repeated embassies to secure recognition of her possession of Thessalonica in exchange for an annual tribute. To back up their diplomatic efforts, the Venetians tried {{to put pressure on}} the Sultan, by stirring up trouble along the Ottomans' periphery, sponsoring efforts for an anti-Ottoman Crusade, and sending their fleet to attack Gallipoli. The Ottomans likewise tried to distract Venice by launching raids of their own on Venetian possessions in the Aegean.|$|E
5|$|If it was {{necessary}} to seize control of a castle an army could either launch an assault or lay siege. It was more efficient to <b>starve</b> the garrison out than to assault it, particularly for the most heavily defended sites. Without relief from an external source, the defenders would eventually submit. Sieges could last weeks, months, and in rare cases years if the supplies of food and water were plentiful. A long siege could slow down the army, allowing help to come or for the enemy to prepare a larger force for later. Such an approach was not confined to castles, but was also applied to the fortified towns of the day. On occasion, siege castles would be built to defend the besiegers from a sudden sally and would have been abandoned after the siege ended one way or another.|$|E
