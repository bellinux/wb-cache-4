He had been taken off to jail as being concerned in the attack on the engine-house; but no evidence could be obtained against him, and he would have been released had he not been recognized as a man who had, five years before, effected a daring escape from Portland, where he was undergoing a life sentence for a brutal manslaughter.|$|E

40|$|Due {{to their}} high surface energy, {{hydrophilic}} surfaces {{are susceptible to}} contamination which is difficult to remove and often ruins the surface. Hydrophilic-oleophobic coatings have a diverse engineering potential including applications as self-cleaning surfaces, extended life anti-fog coatings, and environmental remediation in the selective filtration of oil-in-water mixtures. A successful design model for hydrophilic-oleophobic behavior has been developed using perfluorinated surfactants covalently bound to a surface. Within this design model, a variety of materials have been explored which the surfactants are covalently bound to a substrate; similarly, the surfactants may also be incorporated as a monomer into bulk copolymers. ^ Surfactant based surfaces exhibited simultaneous hydrophilicity, necessary for anti-fogging, and oleophobicity, necessary for contamination resistance. The combination of these features rendered the surface as self-cleaning. Surfactant based brushes, composed of polyethylene glycol and perfluorinated constituents were grafted on to silica surfaces. The relationship between brush density and stimuli-responsiveness was determined by varying grafting conditions. The resultant surfaces were characterized with respect to chemical composition, brush thickness, and wetting behavior of water and hexadecane. Optimized surfaces exhibited stimuli-responsive behavior such that the surfaces will be wetted by water but not by oil. ^ Surfactants were incorporated into random copolymers to create self-cleaning polymers which could be easily coated on to surfaces post-synthesis. Acrylic acid, methyl methacrylate, and hydroxyethyl methacrylate were used as comonomers; feed ratio was varied to establish compositional limits of stimuli-responsive behavior. Polymer composition dictated coating durability and self-cleaning performance as determined by water and hexadecane contact angle. The ability of select coatings to mitigate fogging was assessed in two extreme environments: transition from - 20 °C to humid laboratory environment; exposure to <b>steaming</b> <b>water</b> vapor. ^ Silica membranes of varying pore size were modified with stimuli-responsive surfactants. Membranes showed the ability to selectively pass water and restrict passage of oil, demonstrating a reusable method of separating oil-in-water emulsions. Selectivity of oil-in-water emulsions and permeate flow rate of each individual fluid were quantified for the surfactant modified membranes. Permeate flow rate was characterized with respect to individual droplets and bulk fluid. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} is the Accepted Manuscript version. Under embargo. Embargo end date: 11 January 2018. The final publication {{is available from}} Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers at [URL] Dr. Nelson's Improved Inhaler was first marketed with an advertisement in The Lancet in 1865. Revolutionary at the time for its ease of use and patient-friendliness, the inhaler is still in use for self-treatment by many all over the world. On the occasion of its 150 th anniversary, this study reports an experimental historical medicine approach to identify evidence {{for the quality of}} vapor inhalers. Methods: Through accessing reviews of the device's use by the contemporary medical establishment, it was established that Dr. Nelson's Inhaler enjoyed a reputation of quality and efficacy among reputable physicians generating empirical evidence of clinical performance. There was a general absence of product performance tests during this period. Therefore, modern inhalation performance testing was applied to test the aerosol delivery performance for Friars' Balsam, and its key chemical constituent, benzoic acid (BA). Results: A respirable dose of 59. 9 ???????? 9. 0 ?????g of BA was aerosolized in a 10 minutes period from a dose of 3. 3 ???mL Friars' Balsam (equivalent to 35. 1 ???????? 0. 2 ???mg of BA) in 375 ???mL of <b>steaming</b> <b>water</b> using the glass twin stage impinger at a flow rate of 60 ???L??min??? 1. The respirable dose from a standardized aqueous BA inhalation formulation increased from 115. 9 ???????? 10. 6 to 200. 2 ???????? 19. 9 ?????g by increasing the simulated inhalation period from 5 to 10 minutes. When tested with a simulated inhalation maneuver (500 ???mL tidal volume, 13 minutes??? 1 respiration rate, 1 : 2 inspiratory:expiratory ratio) a respirable dose of 112. 8 ???????? 40. 3 ?????g was produced. Conclusions: This work has highlighted the potential for aerosol drug delivery using steam inhalers that are popular with patients. Physicians should therefore be aware of the potential for lung dosing with irritants when patients self-medicate using the Nelson Inhaler with vaporizing formulations such as Friars' Balsam...|$|E
