60|$|A {{half mile}} further on a <b>straw</b> <b>stack</b> loomed large within a fenced enclosure. The youth wormed his way between the barbed wires {{determined}} {{at last to}} let nothing prevent him from making a cozy bed in the deep straw beside the stack. With courage radiating from every pore he strode toward the stack. His walk was almost a swagger, for thus does youth dissemble the bravery it yearns for but does not possess. He almost whistled again; but not quite, since it seemed an unnecessary provocation to disaster to call particular attention to himself at this time. An instant later he was extremely glad that he had refrained, for {{as he approached the}} stack a huge bulk slowly loomed from behind it; and silhouetted against the moonlit sky he saw the vast proportions of a great, shaggy bull. The burglar tore the inside of one trousers' leg and the back of his coat in his haste to pass through the barbed wire fence onto the open road. There he paused to mop the perspiration from his forehead, though the night was now far from warm.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{correlation}} between farm characteristics and the occurrence {{and importance of}} rodent pests on outdoor pig farms in Denmark was explored in an extensive questionnaire survey. Mice occurred on most farms but were only rarely considered a problem, as opposed to rats, which were controlled on {{more than half of}} the farms. A series of trapping studies showed a high small-mammal diversity in and around the pigsties. The presence of rats was positively correlated with farm size, the presence of <b>straw</b> <b>stacks</b> near the pigsties and the use of automatic feeders. Rats were considered a problem more often when open drinking basins were used or when feed was stored near the pigsties. The environment of the farm did not play an important role except to some extent the proximity of hedges. Recommendations for preventative rodent management include avoiding conditions indicated previously, frequent mucking out and movement of huts, keeping feed in rodent-proof containers, avoid spillage of fodder, and general cleanliness. Direct control methods include application of rodenticides with proper consideration for the risk of unintended poisoning of production animals, the use of traps, keeping dogs or cats, and possibly shooting...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objects in}} this survey were {{to find out whether}} the Japanese mice, Mus molossinus Temminck and Schlegel, live out in the several environments all the year, and whether they have a {{breeding}} season in such different habitats as house, <b>straw</b> <b>stack,</b> cultivated field and waste land. For this reseach the capture of the mice, confirmation of their nest holes, examination on the reproductive status and feeding habit were all carried out in Fukuoka District between June 1955 and April 1960 (Figs. 1 - 5). The trapping for capture of the mice was all done with break-back traps and cage traps baited with a dumpling made of wheat and buckwheat flours or a piece of cheese. The methods I have used for information on the reproductive status were the examination of implantation scars, corpora lutea, presence or absence of embryos and stage of oestrus cycle as determined by vaginal smears regarding the female, on the other hand, spermatozoa in smears of epididymides regarding the male. The results are shown in Tables 1 - 8 {{on the basis of the}} examination on 929 mice (females 402; males 403; young and subadults 124) and on nest holes from all kinds of environments : The mice living in the house take groceries as the food, and breed from spring to autumn. But it is clear that very little breeding occurs in winter. In the farm-house, compost and straw stacks adjoining farm-gardens or grass- and weed-grown areas mice were known to have moved from inside to field owing to the feeding. Such the first movement from inside to field occurred in spring, early summer and fall, and the reverse movement was in winter and rainy season. However the mice dwelling in the urban premises are confined to houses all the year. The food of the mice dwelling in the straw stacks is unhulled rice in winter. Straw stacks in this country are built in the end of November after harvest and these are removed by June of the following year. There is, therefore, the breeding season during winter and spring of the following year. At the beginning of winter the mice living in the fields migrate into straw stacks for the winter season. During autumn the mice are found both around straw stacks adjoining the farm-garden and at considerable distances away from farm-garden. The latter probably lives quite independently in the fields. Since the food has been eaten out at the beginning of spring, they moved from straw stacks to the cultivated field. At the end of spring (the rice planting season) mass of the mice in the straw stacks and the other places spread into the dry slopes of hillacks, high banks of paddy fields and farm-gardens. Most mice living in cultivated field live mainly in the farm-garden and marginal banks of paddy fields in summer. They are living on crops, weed seeds and blades. They can live without the shelters such as houses, compost and straw stacks in winter. They live in burrows in the ground at all seasons. Although they seem to have breeding season all the year round, the rates of fecundity in spring and autumn are higher than in the other seasons. The mice living in the waste land live in burrows in the ground under the weed-grown areas and banks, and they are living largely on weed seeds and blades all the year. They seem to have restricted breeding seasons in spring and autumn. 著者は 1955 年 6 月から 1960 年 4 月まで福岡市およびその近郊において環境を異にする 9 地区 11 カ所を選び(第 1 ～ 5 図),日本産野棲ハツカネズミの棲息場所とその繁殖について検討してみた. 調査の方法としては本種の捕獲,巣孔の確認,食性および生殖状態の吟味などを行なつた. 以下その結果を要約してみたい(第 1 ～ 8 表). まず家屋内に棲息している木種は食品を餌として周年ここに棲み,春夏秋によく繁殖している. 家屋付近に野菜畑や草場があれば時に採餌のため屋外にでて活動する. 一般に藁積は 11 月下旬につくられ,翌年の 5 月下旬には取り除かれる. したがつて藁積に棲む本種は初冬から晩春にみられる. 藁積では主に籾を餌として冬および春ともに繁殖する. 野菜畑を近くにひかえた藁積には本種が多数棲みつき,春には藁積から採餌のため畑にでて活動する. 時に本種は野菜畑から遠く離れたところに棲むこともある. 耕地では作物が畑に繁茂している間は作物を餌としてここに周年穴居するが,付近に家屋や堆肥,藁積があれば,これに移り棲むことがある. とくに梅雨季,冬季においてこのような現象が観察された. また水田地においては夏は土手に棲む. 耕地でも繁殖状態にあるものは周年みられるが,とくに春と秋とに多い. 原野に棲む本種は雑草の茎葉,種実を餌として周年土中に穴居または雑草中に棲息する. その繁殖ははつきり春秋に限られる. 要するに人間社会から離れた孤立地区に棲息する原始生活型の本種は雑草の茎葉と種実を餌として土中に穴居し,その繁殖現象には春と秋の明瞭な 2 つの繁殖季節を留めている. これに反し,一般に人間の生活領域に入つてきている本種は餌や棲息場所を人間に依存し,周年にわたつて繁殖可能となり,明確な繁殖季節を認めがたい. このことは環境としての棲息場所が本種の繁殖現象にいかに大きな影響を与えているかを充分に物語るものである...|$|E

50|$|Traditional {{methods of}} {{preparing}} Qu have changed little since {{the publication of}} the Qimin Yaoshu (544 AD). Grains or flours are imbibed with water (e.g. steaming rice or mixing flour with water to form a dough) and subsequently incubated in a warm, humid environment during a favourable time of year, typically spring or autumn. No inoculums were used, but often herbs were added to some preparations because they were noted to create beneficial qualities. In order to keep the grains or doughs relatively moist and warm they are kept in closed straw-roofed huts and typically housed in <b>straw</b> baskets, <b>stacked</b> on wooden shelves or simply placed upon the floor. Leaves of various plants, often straw, mulberry leaves or Artemisia, were used to wrap or cover the Qu to promote a beneficial condition. The presses and moulds used to shape the doughs were/are also made of wood. All of these elements unknowingly provided access to the microbes. The cakes are deemed ready when a coloured coating is formed on the outside. They are then dried and stored until use. The control of moisture and temperature levels and a lack of atmospheric access was recognized as vital to making consistently good Jiuqu as early as the Qimin Yaoshu.|$|R
50|$|Modern barns {{are more}} {{typically}} steel buildings. From about 1900 to 1940, many large dairy barns {{were built in}} northern USA.

The barns that were common to the wheatbelt held large numbers of pulling horses such as Clydesdales or Percherons. These large wooden barns, especially when filled with hay, could make spectacular fires that were usually total losses for the farmers. With the advent of balers it became possible to store hay and <b>straw</b> outdoors in <b>stacks</b> surrounded by a plowed fireguard. Many barns in the northern United States are painted barn red with a white trim. One possible {{reason for this is that}} ferric oxide, which is used to create red paint, was the cheapest and most readily available chemical for farmers in New England and nearby areas. Another possible reason is that ferric oxide acts a preservative and so painting a barn with it would help to protect the structure.|$|R
