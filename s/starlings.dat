5|$|Extant East Asian <b>{{starling}}s,</b> {{such as the}} Bali myna (Leucopsar rothschildi) and the {{white-headed starling}} (Sturnia erythropygia), have similarities with these extinct species in colouration and other features. As the Rodrigues and Mauritius <b>starlings</b> {{seem to be more}} closely related to each other than to the hoopoe starling, which appears to be closer to Southeast Asian <b>starlings,</b> there may have been two separate colonisations of <b>starlings</b> in the Mascarenes from Asia, with the hoopoe starling being the latest arrival. Apart from Madagascar, the Mascarenes were the only islands in the south-west Indian Ocean that contained native <b>starlings.</b> This is probably due to the isolation, varied topography and vegetation of these islands.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, the American ornithologist Dean Amadon {{suggested}} that Sturnus-like species could have arrived in Africa, and {{given rise to}} the wattled starling (Creatophora cinerea) and the Mascarene <b>starlings.</b> According to Amadon, the Rodrigues and hoopoe <b>starlings</b> were related to Asiatic <b>starlings,</b> such as some species of Sturnus, rather than the glossy <b>starlings</b> (Lamprotornis) of Africa and the Madagascan starling (Saroglossa aurata); he concluded this based on the colouration of the birds. A 2008 study, which analysed the DNA of various <b>starlings,</b> confirmed that the hoopoe starling was a starling, but with no close relatives among the sampled species.|$|E
5|$|Common <b>starlings</b> may {{contract}} avian tuberculosis, avian malaria and retrovirus-induced lymphomas. Captive <b>starlings</b> often accumulate excess iron in the liver, {{a condition}} that can be prevented by adding black tea-leaves to the food.|$|E

50|$|The {{fighting}} pair {{were involved}} in a rather long blows exchange towards the end of round six, <b>Starling</b> being near the ropes at the time. Then they moved, <b>Starling's</b> back facing one of the ring's corners. The two boxers then launched hard, interchanging, over-looping right hands. <b>Starling's</b> missed but Molinares' hit <b>Starling</b> on the button of <b>Starling's</b> chin. About that moment, the bell sounded to finish the round. <b>Starling</b> fell to the floor face-first, and was counted out by referee Cortez. <b>Starling</b> sprained his right ankle after he fell on top of it.|$|R
50|$|The Norfolk <b>starling</b> (Aplonis fusca fusca), {{was a small}} bird in the <b>starling</b> family. It is the extinct {{nominate}} subspecies of the Tasman <b>starling,</b> {{the only}} other subspecies being the also extinct Lord Howe <b>starling</b> (A. f. hulliana).|$|R
5|$|Extant relations, {{such as the}} Bali myna (Leucopsar rothschildi) and the white-headed {{starling}} (Sturnia erythropygia), have similarities in colouration and other features with the extinct Mascarene species. Since the Rodrigues and Mauritius <b>starlings</b> seem morphologically closer to each other than to the hoopoe starling—which appears closer to Southeast Asian starlings—there may have been two separate migrations of <b>starlings</b> from Asia to the Mascarenes, with the hoopoe starling the latest arrival. Except for Madagascar, the Mascarenes were the only islands in the southwestern Indian Ocean with native <b>starlings,</b> probably due to their isolation, varied topography, and vegetation.|$|E
5|$|More {{than twenty}} species of hawk, owl and falcon {{are known to}} {{occasionally}} predate feral <b>starlings</b> in North America, though the most regular predators of adults {{are likely to be}} urban-living peregrine falcons or merlins (Falco columbarius). Common mynas (Acridotheres tristis) sometimes evict eggs, nestlings and adult common <b>starlings</b> from their nests, and the lesser honeyguide (Indicator minor), a brood parasite, uses the common starling as a host. <b>Starlings</b> are more commonly the culprits rather than victims of nest eviction however, especially towards other <b>starlings</b> and woodpeckers. Nests can be raided by animals capable of climbing to them, such as stoats (Mustela erminea), raccoons (Procyon lotor) and squirrels (Sciurus spp.), and cats may catch the unwary.|$|E
5|$|After two failed attempts, {{about 60}} common <b>starlings</b> were {{released}} in 1890 into New York's Central Park by Eugene Schieffelin. He {{was president of}} the American Acclimatization Society, which tried to introduce every bird species mentioned in the works of William Shakespeare into North America. About the same date, the Portland Song Bird Club released 35 pairs of common <b>starlings</b> in Portland, Oregon. These birds became established but disappeared around 1902. Common <b>starlings</b> reappeared in the Pacific Northwest in the mid-1940s and these birds were probably descendants of the 1890 Central Park introduction. The original 60 birds have since swelled in number to 150 million, occupying an area extending from southern Canada and Alaska to Central America.|$|E
50|$|The purple <b>starling</b> (Lamprotornis purpureus), {{also known}} as the purple glossy <b>starling,</b> {{is a member of the}} <b>starling</b> family of birds.|$|R
50|$|The Apo myna (Basilornis mirandus) is {{a species}} of <b>starling</b> in the <b>starling</b> family Sturnidae. The species {{is also known as}} the Mount Apo <b>starling</b> or the Mount Apo king <b>starling.</b> The {{specific}} name is Latin for wonderful or strange.|$|R
50|$|The golden-breasted <b>starling</b> (Lamprotornis regius), {{also known}} as royal <b>starling,</b> is a medium-sized, up to 35 cm long, {{passerine}} in the <b>starling</b> family.|$|R
5|$|Several {{terrestrial}} <b>starlings,</b> {{including those}} in the genus Sturnus, have adaptations of the skull and muscles that help with feeding by probing. This adaptation is most strongly developed in the common starling (along with the spotless and white-cheeked <b>starlings),</b> where the protractor muscles responsible for opening the jaw are enlarged and the skull is narrow, allowing the eye to be moved forward to peer {{down the length of}} the bill. This technique involves inserting the bill into the ground and opening it as a way of searching for hidden food items. Common <b>starlings</b> have the physical traits that enable them to use this feeding technique, which has undoubtedly helped the species spread far and wide.|$|E
5|$|Since common <b>starlings</b> eat {{insect pests}} such as wireworms, they are {{considered}} beneficial in northern Eurasia, {{and this was one}} of the reasons given for introducing the birds elsewhere. Around 25million nest boxes were erected for this species in the former Soviet Union, and common <b>starlings</b> were found to be effective in controlling the grass grub Costelytra zelandica in New Zealand. The original Australian introduction was facilitated by the provision of nest boxes to help this mainly insectivorous bird to breed successfully, and even in the US, where this is a pest species, the Department of Agriculture acknowledges that vast numbers of insects are consumed by common <b>starlings.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Starlings</b> {{have been}} {{observed}} to rub banded sugar ants on their feathers and skin, a behaviour known as anting.|$|E
5|$|The hoopoe <b>starling,</b> {{also known}} as the Réunion <b>starling</b> or Bourbon crested <b>starling</b> (Fregilupus varius), is a species of <b>starling</b> which lived on the Mascarene island of Réunion, and became extinct in the 1850s. Its closest {{relatives}} were the Rodrigues <b>starling</b> and the Mauritius <b>starling</b> from nearby islands, and the three apparently originated in Southeast Asia. The bird was first mentioned during the 17th century and was long thought {{to be related to the}} hoopoe, from which its name is derived. Although a number of affinities have been proposed, it was confirmed as a <b>starling</b> in a DNA study.|$|R
5000|$|The Malabar <b>starling</b> (Sturnia blythii) is {{a species}} of <b>starling</b> found in {{southwest}} India. It was previously considered a subspecies of the chestnut-tailed <b>starling.</b>|$|R
5|$|The <b>starling</b> family, Sturnidae, is {{an entirely}} Old World group apart from {{introductions}} elsewhere, with the greatest numbers of species in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The genus Sturnus is polyphyletic and relationships between its members are not fully resolved. The closest relation of the common <b>starling</b> is the spotless <b>starling.</b> The non-migratory spotless <b>starling</b> may be descended from a population of ancestral S. vulgaris that survived in an Iberian refugium during an ice age retreat, and mitochondrial gene studies suggest {{that it could be}} considered as a subspecies of the common <b>starling.</b> There is more genetic variation between common <b>starling</b> populations than between nominate common <b>starling</b> and spotless <b>starling.</b> Although common <b>starling</b> remains are known from the Middle Pleistocene, part of the problem in resolving relationships in the Sturnidae is the paucity of the fossil record for the family as a whole.|$|R
5|$|Common <b>starlings</b> are hosts to a {{wide range}} of parasites. A survey of three hundred common <b>starlings</b> from six US states found that all had at least one type of parasite; 99% had {{external}} fleas, mites or ticks, and 95% carried internal parasites, mostly various types of worm. Blood-sucking species leave their host when it dies, but other external parasites stay on the corpse. A bird with a deformed bill was heavily infested with Mallophaga lice, presumably due to its inability to remove vermin.|$|E
5|$|Common <b>starlings</b> can eat {{and damage}} fruit in {{orchards}} such as grapes, peaches, olives, currants and tomatoes or dig up newly sown grain and sprouting crops. They may also eat animal feed and distribute seeds through their droppings. In eastern Australia, weeds like bridal creeper, blackberry and boneseed {{are thought to}} have been spread by common <b>starlings.</b> Agricultural damage in the US is estimated as costing about US$800 million annually. This bird is not considered to be as damaging to agriculture in South Africa {{as it is in the}} United States.|$|E
5|$|Flocks of {{anything}} {{from five to}} fifty thousand common <b>starlings</b> form {{in areas of the}} UK just before sundown during mid-winter. These flocks are commonly called murmurations.|$|E

50|$|The Mauritius <b>starling</b> (Cryptopsar ischyrhynchus) is an {{extinct species}} of <b>starling,</b> {{described}} in 2014 by Julian P. Hume, based on subfossils from Mauritius. The holotype mandible {{was discovered in}} 1904, but was hidden in a museum drawer for over a hundred years, hence the genus name. The Mauritius <b>starling</b> was shown {{to be closer to}} the Rodrigues <b>starling</b> than to the hoopoe <b>starling</b> of Réunion.|$|R
6000|$|That {{evening after}} dinner he took Mr. <b>Starling</b> into the smoking-room and card-room. They had {{something}} hot. At 4 A. M., {{with the assistance}} of the steward, he projected Mr. <b>Starling</b> into Mrs. <b>Starling's</b> stateroom, delicately withdrawing to evade the lady's thanks. At breakfast he saw Miss Bike. [...] "Thank you so much," [...] she said; [...] "Mrs. <b>Starling</b> found <b>Starling</b> greatly improved. He himself admitted he was 'never berrer' and, far from worrying about what night-clothes he should wear, went to bed AS HE WAS--even to his hat. Mrs. <b>Starling</b> calls you 'her preserver,' and Mr. <b>Starling</b> distinctly stated that you were a 'jolly-good-fler.'" ...|$|R
5|$|<b>Starlings</b> {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} passerine birds with strong feet. Their flight {{is strong and}} direct and most are very gregarious.There are about 114 species worldwide, two {{of which have been}} recorded in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
5|$|<b>Starlings</b> {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} passerine birds. Their flight {{is strong and}} direct {{and they are very}} gregarious. Their preferred habitat is fairly open country. They eat insects and fruit. Plumage is typically dark with a metallic sheen.|$|E
5|$|The common {{starling}} {{was introduced}} to Australia to consume insect pests of farm crops. Early settlers looked forward to their arrival, believing that common <b>starlings</b> were also important for the pollination of flax, a major agricultural product. Nest-boxes for the newly released birds were placed on farms and near crops. The common starling {{was introduced to}} Melbourne in 1857 and Sydney two decades later. By the 1880s, established populations {{were present in the}} southeast of the country thanks to the work of acclimatisation committees. By the 1920s, common <b>starlings</b> were widespread throughout Victoria, Queensland and New South Wales, but by then they were considered to be pests. Although common <b>starlings</b> were first sighted in Albany, Western Australia in 1917, they have been largely prevented from spreading to the state. The wide and arid Nullarbor Plain provides a natural barrier and control measures have been adopted that have killed 55,000 birds over three decades. The common starling has also colonised Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island.|$|E
50|$|The {{mountain}} <b>starling,</b> Vanuatu <b>starling,</b> Santo mountain <b>starling</b> or Santo <b>starling</b> (Aplonis santovestris) is {{a species}} of <b>starling</b> in the family Sturnidae. It is endemic to the island of Espiritu Santo in Vanuatu. It is restricted to cloud forest on that island. The species was seldom seen in the 20th century and was at one point feared extinct, although a 1991 expedition managed to find a population high in the mountains.|$|R
50|$|The {{metallic}} <b>starling</b> (Aplonis metallica), {{also known}} as the shining <b>starling,</b> is a bird in the <b>starling</b> family native to the Moluccas, New Guinea, Queensland and the Solomon Islands.|$|R

5|$|Western Australia {{banned the}} import of common <b>starlings</b> in 1895. New flocks {{arriving}} from the east are routinely shot, while the less cautious juveniles are trapped and netted. New methods are being developed, such as tagging one bird and tracking it back to establish where {{other members of the}} flock roost. Another technique is to analyse the DNA of Australian common starling populations to track where the migration from eastern to western Australia is occurring so that better preventive strategies can be used. By 2009, only 300 common <b>starlings</b> were left in Western Australia, and the state committed a further A$400,000 in that year to continue the eradication programme.|$|E
5|$|Flying {{insects that}} {{parasitise}} common <b>starlings</b> include the louse-fly Omithomya nigricornis and the saprophagous fly Camus hemapterus. The latter species breaks off the feathers of its host and {{lives on the}} fats produced by growing plumage. Larvae of the moth Hofmannophila pseudospretella are nest scavengers, which feed on animal material such as faeces or dead nestlings. Protozoan blood parasites of the genus Haemoproteus {{have been found in}} common <b>starlings,</b> but a better known pest is the brilliant scarlet nematode Syngamus trachea. This worm moves from the lungs to the trachea and may cause its host to suffocate. In Britain, the rook and the common starling are the most infested wild birds. Other recorded internal parasites include the spiny-headed worm Prosthorhynchus transverses.|$|E
5|$|Foreign {{animals are}} also found, {{in common with}} much of Adelaide. While red foxes, cats, European rabbits, black rats, house mice and European hares are seen, {{there has been no}} {{systemic}} recording of alien fauna species. Exotic birds, including rock pigeons, European goldfinch, house sparrow, <b>starlings</b> and blackbirds are common. Introduced bees and European wasps are present, with the aggressive wasps an issue for the park's visitors.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the first}} of these is included, it seems highly {{warranted}} to include in Sturnia also the monotypic genera Leucopsar (Bali <b>starling)</b> and Fregilupus (Bourbon crested <b>starling),</b> and perhaps the enigmatic Necropsar (Rodrigues <b>starling).</b> On the other hand, if these distinct genera are maintained, the white-faced <b>starling</b> would receive its own genus Sturnornis ...|$|R
