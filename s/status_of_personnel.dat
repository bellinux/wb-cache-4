My effort is to identify and show the application of particular psychology branches that are somehow connected with Personnel Management.

My thesis is divided into three parts. The first chapter brings out general problems of personnel management, explanation of concepts and making clear who really is involved in this process. Very important is a question of a <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>personnel</b> management in the whole company structure. The status has a great impact on the real personnel work.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to assess the {{contribution}} and role of personnel management through an empirical examination {{of some of the}} major variables in the organisation, and how the personnel function affects them. Contemporary organisation theory suggests a contingency approach to the influence of the organisation on the personnel function, and recognises the multivariate nature of organisations, in as much their resultant productivity will depend on the relationship between the employees' (attitudes) and the way they are managed (practices). The practice of personnel management is therefore the selection of the most appropriate practices for outcomes which will produce the greatest productivity. A research model was developed to explore these relationships, using employee attitude and personnel practice as the independent variables, and productivity as the dependent variable. Buchholz's Beliefs About Work Scale and the Litwin and Stringer Organisational Climate Scale were used as measures of employee attitude, and were administered to a sample of 2, 111 members of the New Zealand work force from 40 work organisations. Measures of personnel practice were developed from structured interviews with each of the 40 organisations, and a set of productivity data was requested from each organisation. It was concluded that while psychological measures of employee attitude can be obtained satisfactorily using scales that have been developed in previous studies, and that measures of personnel practice can be developed, the same cannot be said for productivity. The paucity of the productivity information is indicative of the current <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>personnel</b> management in New Zealand, with implications for both psychology and personnel management. These implications are discussed in this thesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} {{universities}} and universities of applied sciences {{has been cut}} down in Finland. This process will be the future trend. Different levels of collaborative work {{is going on in}} order to find new forms of organizing library services. In 2011 Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT) and Saimaa University of Applied Sciences (SUAS) set up a joint library, Lappeenranta Academic Library (LAL). Arrangements and planning were carried out in 1, 5 yrs. The project was many-sided as a joint library was to be created, not to merge two universities. The Academic Library is a part of LUT organization and the library personnel is employed by LUT. Library services in general are equal, but different needs can also be taken into account. Demands on services for researchers, teachers and students may differ depending on university, but generally all services are available to members of either organization. Printed collections are combined but electronic collections are still separate. Databases are licensed to organizations, not libraries. There are double agreements on licenses. The fact that there are separate networks in library premises is problematic. In electronic licenses no savings are achieved, but the situation is better in print collections. Also less people work in the library now as the services have been adjusted. The library serves new fields of science now. This process forced the staff to a learning process. Librarians have to understand the thinking in distinct fields of science. The data administration departments work together, too. A forum has been set up to highlight questions and problems concerning joint libraries such as the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>personnel,</b> consortium level actions and licensing of electronic material.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess {{the status of the}} present dental and oral health {{services}} at Gezira Province. The facilities included those in urban and rural areas including Wad Medani Dental Hospital, Wad Medani Military Hospital, El Gadaiea Health Centre and Marinjan Health Centre. The study tools were direct pre-coded questionnaires, and a checklist. The procedure involved dental clinical examinations to estimate the dental health services assessed by measuring, the decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) index and <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>personnel,</b> equipment and materials. The study sample was randomly selected at 10 % of patients attended Wad Medani Dental and Military Dental Hospitals for a week time period (6 days). All patients attended El Gadaiea and Marinjan Health Centres (n = 201) and sampled patients at rural health institutions during the same period were recruited (n = 448). A checklist was used {{to assess the}} personnel, equipment and instruments. The Gezira province in central Sudan is 6000 km in area with an estimated population of 1, 757, 265. It comprises 658 towns, villages and camps. The total number of dentists in the Gezira State was 26, of those 14 were working in the province. With a dentists population ratio of 1 : 130, 000. Thirty study sites in the rural area were chosen from five study councils included Alhosh, Wad Alnaeem, Alhag Abdalla, Almadina Arab and Hantoub. They comprise 418 towns, villages and camps, of these 5 only 118 with health services. In these there are only 4 dental units, three of them were incomplete, all of them were operated by dental assistants, while the only complete unit was operated by medical assistant. This result revealed absolute lack of dental services in rural areas. The present units are old and most of them were not functioning. This was the reason that most of rural population seek oral health services for periodontal diseases and dental caries in Wad Medani health institutions. Most of patients irrespective of their residence, preferred treatment at private dental clinics because they expect better care due to good facilities. The results also revealed a poor level of oral health services reflected by the presence of a high level of decayed and missing component of DMFT. The missing teeth were mainly due to increased extraction of dental caries and periodontal diseases. The mean DMFT index was estimated 6. 2 in urban population and 6. 7 in rural population, statistically significant. This DMFT score exceeds the WHO stated DMFT score to achieve the goals for standard oral health. This study showed a high DMFT score in Gezira Province both in rural and urban areas and this was similar to a previous study in a former central state included Gezira Province which indicated high prevalence of dental caries, periodontal diseases and poor oral health services...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Health is {{dynamic and}} multifactorial in nature. Oral health is an {{integral}} part of general health. Health personnel, especially in primary health centers (PHCs), can play an important role in grooming health in their patients. Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the oral health <b>status</b> <b>of</b> health <b>personnel</b> <b>of</b> PHCs. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out among 520 health personnel working in PHCs of Mathura district in the month of September-October 2014. The WHO Oral Health Assessment Form (2013) was used to collect data from each subject. Comparison <b>of</b> oral health <b>status</b> <b>of</b> various health <b>personnel</b> was also done. Results: In the present study, 45 (8. 7 %) belonged to the upper socioeconomic class, 295 (56. 7 %) were from upper-middle socioeconomic class, and 180 (34. 6 %) were from lower-middle socioeconomic class. The mean decayed missing filled teeth was 1. 11 ± 2. 63 for doctors, 1. 24 ± 3. 10 for pharmacists, 1. 10 ± 3. 55 for lab technicians, 1. 78 ± 3. 80 for ward boys/ward nurses, 0. 25 ± 0. 50 for lady health visitors, and 1. 53 ± 3. 16 for auxiliary nurse midwives.

40|$|In modern times, the {{presence}} of Private military companies (PMC) in armed conflicts has increased. The practical use of these PMCs, in armed conflicts, has created problems with regard to determining their legal status under International Humanitarian Law (IHL). This paper examines the legal <b>status</b> <b>of</b> the <b>personnel</b> in PMCs in armed conflicts and reveals {{that the only way}} that the personnel in PMCs may have legal status as combatants is if they are incorporated into the armed forces of a state. State practice, on the other hand, shows that this is not actually implemented in modern armed conflicts. Instead, the research shows that it is state practice to consider personnel in PMCs to have legal status as civilians, something which includes both the legal status as persons who accompany the armed forces and ordinary civilians. 1 With regard to the legal status as persons who accompany the armed forces, the research reveals that the US Department of Defence is of the opinion that persons who accompany the armed forces, who have a primary status as civilians, may participate in hostilities without loosing the right <b>of</b> their secondary <b>status</b> as prisoners <b>of</b> war (POW). This is an interpretation that may be understood as being contrary to the view in IHL, which says that civilians loose their privileges when and during the time they participate in hostilities.. Based on the state practice which indicates that the personnel in PMCs have the legal status as civilians, this paper argues that the personnel in PMCs, who provide services in armed conflicts which require direct participation in the hostilities, may be classified as unprivileged belligerents. The research also shows that personnel in PMCs in certain circumstances may be classified as mercenaries, but examples indicate that this is less likely to happen in reality. As the participation of PMCs in modern armed conflict is increasing, this research urges the need for international and national initiatives and policies to regulate the use of PMCs and to determine the legal <b>status</b> <b>of</b> their <b>personnel.</b> The study also emphasizes the need for extended education of the armed forces in IHL, in particular regarding the legal <b>status</b> <b>of</b> the <b>personnel</b> in PMCs...|$|R
