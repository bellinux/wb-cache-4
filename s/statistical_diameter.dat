40|$|International audienceWhen laser-induced {{fluorescence}} of droplets is {{used for}} measurements such as droplet temperature, a new dependence of the droplet size on the spectral distribution of fluorescence has been highlighted.

40|$|Accurate {{modeling}} of fibrous filter pressure drop and particle capture/loading behavior includes many phenomena, including partial-to-full slip flow at fiber boundaries, random fiber location and orientation, particle/fiber and particle/particle adhesion and bouncing. Filter media fibers are usually joined together by binders which form significant percentages {{of the solid}} material in the media. Complete simulation of media geometry would be three-dimensional (3 -D). However, complex 3 -D geometries in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) demand powerful computing resources, and hence have been limited to a few fibers. Studies using 2 -Dimensional (2 D) models were effective in predicting media airflow resistance and particle capture for simple geometries.

40|$|Various {{workers have}} shown the {{asphaltene}} fraction of crude oil {{to be responsible for}} the highly stable W/O emulsions formed after marine oil spillages. Electron microscope studies on crude oil emulsions using the freeze etching technique showed the oil/water interface to be smooth on the aqueous side but to have a particulate structure on the oil side. In Brega crude oil emulsions, waxy plates were aligned along the interface. Also observed were the coherence of the interfacial film and droplet coalescence. Allowing a method error of ± 10 %, good agreement was found between computer calculated droplet diameters from the log-normal distribution equation and standard <b>statistical</b> mean <b>diameters.</b> Sc (interfacial area/unit volume oil phase) was larger for salt water emulsions. An equation proposed for Sc as a function of stirring time fitted very well for all three crude oil emulsions. The maximum Sc increased with φ (volume fraction) indicating a minimum possible diameter droplet fold by the stirrer. A rate parameter in the equation is probably related to the asphaltene diffusion to the interface. A good fit with the data was obtained when the equation was modified to account for detergent addition delaying emulsion formation. A second rate parameter may reflect the irreversible replacement of detergent at the interface by asphaltenes. Ageing studies showed that once stabilisation was complete, detergent present only slowly affected coalescence. A heating effect explained the non-linearity of Kuwait and Tia Juana emulsion rheograms. The greater viscosity of Tia Juana stabilised emulsions was explained by a thicker supporting asphaltene layer. The elasticity of the-interfacial film accounted for anomalous behaviour in emulsions of asphaltenes dispersed in m-xylene/n-octane.

Most of them are dealing with single droplets and only fewer are devoted to sprays, for which several diagnostics were implemented. Moreover, when sprays are involved, the liquid mass flux is generally quite low (on the order of several kg/m²/s) and {{the case of a}} cold surface was mainly considered. Therefore, the present experimental work aims at investigating the impingement of sprays onto hot surfaces (up to 800 °C) with liquid mass flux up to 13 kg/m²/s. Specifically, the main objective is to characterize the secondary droplets {{as a function of the}} surface temperature, starting from the Leidenfrost regime. To that purpose, a 2 D Phase Doppler Analyzer (PDA) is synchronized with an infrared camera in order to measure simultaneously the time evolution of the local droplets size and velocity distributions with the surface temperature. Six full cone sprays were used in order to obtain a wide range of impingement conditions (normal incident Weber and liquid mass flux). A comparison of the impingement characteristics is also performed when the surface remains at room temperature. Another important point concerns also the effect on the spray flow of the presence of the surface. Results show clearly that the incident droplet trajectories are modified by the presence of the solid wall itself and depend strongly on the temperature surface. The in-depth investigation of the impingement characteristics of the spray is mainly focused on the description of the <b>statistical</b> mean <b>diameter</b> and the mass flux after the impingement. The main results highlight that the mean diameter value of the secondary droplets does not change during the Leidenfrost regime and increases for lower surface temperature. This behavior is strongly correlated to the liquid film formation for temperatures lower than the Leidenfrost point. The expelled mass flux exhibits a similar behavior but a decrease is observed after a given temperature, which can be attributed to the deepening of the liquid, leading to a reduction of the number of expelled droplets...|$|R

In the paper, it is argued that such an approach cannot be but probabilistic or semi-probabilistic. Based on published experimental data and <b>statistical</b> analysis of <b>diameter</b> and centroid position along the axis of jet grouted columns, in the paper a series of Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to find the influence of possible defects within the column in the umbrella static performance, with reference to two extreme subsoil conditions, that is clay and sand. Geometrical considerations on the minimum overlapping among columns necessary for continuity on the whole span of the umbrella are first drawn. It is shown that, due to defects, the real shape of jet grouted umbrellas is not that of a regular frustum of cone, and overlapping decreases along the span. There is a critical length after which structural continuity is difficult to obtain, depending on the statistical characteristics of the jet columns. Defects in axis orientation play the major role on this critical length. Static conditions are also analysed, assuming a simplified 2 D arch scheme, with reference to the part of umbrella in which continuity is guaranteed with the assumed level of confidence (95 %). The minimum average thickness of the jet grouted umbrella necessary for equilibrium is than found, which of course increases as the umbrella opens up along its axis.

They have been tried mainly on objects with known features that are amenable to manual (expert) annotation. They have not been examined on objects with severe ambiguities to be uniquely characterized by experts. This dissertation presents a unified approach for modeling, detecting, segmenting and categorizing small objects under uncertainty, with focus on lung nodules that may appear in low dose CT (LDCT) scans of the human chest. The AAM, ASM and the ATM approaches are used {{for the first time}} on this application. A new formulation to object detection by template matching, as an energy optimization, is introduced. Nine similarity measures of matching have been quantitatively evaluated for detecting nodules less than 1 em in <b>diameter.</b> <b>Statistical</b> methods that combine intensity, shape and spatial interaction are examined for segmentation of small size objects. Extensions of the intensity model using the linear combination of Gaussians (LCG) approach are introduced, in order to estimate the number of modes in the LCG equation. The classical maximum a posteriori (MAP) segmentation approach has been adapted to handle segmentation of small size lung nodules that are randomly located in the lung tissue. A novel empirical approach has been devised to simultaneously detect and segment the lung nodules in LDCT scans. The level sets methods approach was also applied for lung nodule segmentation. A new formulation for the energy function controlling the level set propagation has been introduced taking into account the specific properties of the nodules. Finally, a novel approach for classification of the segmented nodules into categories has been introduced. Geometric object descriptors such as the SIFT, AS 1 FT, SURF and LBP have been used for feature extraction and matching of small size lung nodules; the LBP has been found to be the most robust. Categorization implies classification of detected and segmented objects into classes or types. The object descriptors have been deployed in the detection step for false positive reduction, and in the categorization stage to assign a class and type for the nodules. The AAMI ASMI A TM models have been used for the categorization stage. The front-end processes of lung nodule modeling, detection, segmentation and classification/categorization are model-based and data-driven. This dissertation is the first attempt in the literature at creating an entirely model-based approach for lung nodule analysis...|$|R
40|$|Fluid {{flow through}} porous media {{takes place in}} many natural {{processes}} such as ground water flows, capillary flows in plants and flow in human organs and muscles. It is also of outmost importance to have knowledge of this flow {{in a number of}} industrial processes such as paper making, making of fiber boards, composites manufacturing, filtering, forming and sintering of iron ore pellets and drying and impregnation of wood. Despite the significance of porous media flow and the vast amount of work that has been performed to investigate it, knowledge of some fundamentals is missing. Little is, for instance, known about flow field at the inlet, mid-section and outlet of porous bed as well as transitional and turbulent flow in porous media on the microscopic level. On a macroscopic level Darcy law is extended to the so called Ergun or Forchheimer Equations when Re becomes larger than about 10 to fit experimental data. The actual value depends both on the porous media and how Re is defined. The deviation from Darcy flow can for modest Re be explained by inertia but may, as Re increases, also be attributed to turbulence. The macroscopic way of modelling the flow field during transition from inertia dominated to turbulent flow is just to continue with the Forchheimer Equation or possibly some version of it. In any case experimental data yields that, on a macroscopic level, the transition from Darcy flow to inertia dominated and turbulent flow is smooth. To get a better understanding of this process the transition from laminar to turbulent flow in porous media is here studied with new experimental methods. To mimic inter-connected pores, a simplified geometry is studied consisting of a pipe with a relatively large diameter that is split into two parallel pipes with different diameters. This is a pore-doublet set-up and the pressure drop over all pipes is recorded by pressure transducers for different flow rates. The model is also extended to three parallel pipes. In the other main set-up the flow in a bed of spheres is studied with indexed matched fluids and with classical 2 D-PIV and Stereoscopic-PIV. This is done {{in order to be able}} to understand the conditions in different flow regimes and in different position of the porous media even before and after it. The measurements are performed at a large range of Reynolds numbers, 30 < Rep < 4000 and the bed consists of relatively many spheres. The size of the porous bed is 0. 10 x 0. 10 x 0. 31 m 3 and the spheres are 12. 5 mm in <b>diameter.</b> <b>Statistical</b> methods and frequency analysis are performed to investigate the data collected. Positive skewness of pressure drop fluctuations indicates early stage of presence of turbulent patches in the flow in the set-up with pipes. The measured flow distribution and pressure drop fluctuations highlights six distinct flow patterns in the pipe network based on variation in flow regime of each pipe and the level of pressure fluctuations. Correlation between the pressure drop between the two pipes shows that fluctuations in the flow in one pipe is mirrored in the other pipe much better than when both of them become fully turbulent. Some detailed results are that the frequency analysis reveals two different frequency band events in the pipes. The gain factor shows that both frequency band events originate from the larger pipe until the early presence of turbulent patches in the smaller pipe. The low frequency fluctuations makes the flow in the pipes to be out of phase while the high frequency band fluctuations try to bring the flow in the pipes back to equilibrium state. The 2 D-PIV measurements showed that the flow is no longer in the creeping regime at Rep ≈ 100 while intregrated pressure drop data yield that it is. This shows that detailed measurements can yield more information of the overall flow field than measurements of integrated quantities. Also the velocity distribution is self-similar with respect to Rep for laminar flow and for turbulent flow. The PIV measurement also yields that the probability for relatively low and high velocities decreases with Rep while recirculation zones that appear in inertia dominated flows are suppressed by the turbulent flow at higher Rep. Finally and to my best knowledge, for the first time stereoscopic particle image velocimetry has been used to investigate the flow dynamic in a randomly packed bed of mono sized spherical particles. This reveals a highly three-dimensional flow. Godkänd; 2015; 20151019 (shekha); Nedanstående person kommer att disputera för avläggande av teknologie doktorsexamen.

40|$|Water {{soil erosion}} {{is a process}} of {{detachment}} and transport of soil particles due to rainfall and runoff and it is the main cause of the modeling of extended portions of the earth's surface. The acceleration of the process through anthropogenic perturbation has severe impacts on soil and environmental quality. Soil erosion above a certain level will reduce soil productivity over the long haul. It exposes subsoil, which has often poor qualities for crop establishment and growth, and it can lead to stand loss by sediment deposition. A fundamental property of rainfall for understanding how it is made up is the raindrop size distribution (DSD). The knowledge of the raindrop size distribution at the surface is fundamental for understanding the precipitation mechanisms at upper levels, and so it has a direct influence on soil erosion processes. Rainfall erosivity, i. e. the capability of rainfall to detach soil particles, is the most important parameter for quantifying erosion processes and it can be represented by its kinetic energy per unit time and area, named kinetic power, Pn. Many researchers proposed empirical relationships estimating kinetic power by rainfall intensity and having different mathematical forms (polynomial, exponential, logarithmical, and power type) (Salles et al., 2002). The most commonly used relationship estimating Pn as function of rainfall intensity is that proposed by Wischmeier and Smith (1978) according to which the ratio between kinetic power and rainfall intensity, Pn/I, increases for rainfall intensity value {{less than or equal to}} a threshold value of rainfall intensity, It, equal to 76 mm h- 1 and then it becomes constant for rainfall intensity greater than It. Wischmeier and Smith (1978) justified this threshold value suggesting that the median volume diameter, D 0, (i. e. the diameter that divides the drop size distribution (DSD) in two parts of equal volume) does not increase when rainfall intensities exceed It. For describing this trend Kinnell (1981) proposed an exponential relationship between the kinetic power and the rainfall intensity, according to which the kinetic power per unit volume of rainfall has a finite positive value at zero intensity and approaches to an asymptotic value at high intensities. The rainfall kinetic power may be also determined by adding the contribution of single raindrops once their mass and terminal velocity are known. In other words, detachability of soil due to a rainfall event can be indirectly measured if the DSD and a relationship between terminal velocity and drop diameter are known. In particular, combining the Gamma distribution of Ulbrich (1983) and the terminal velocity relationship proposed by Ferro (2001), Carollo and Ferro (2015) deduced theoretically a relationship linking the ratio between kinetic power and rainfall intensity, Pn/I, to  and  parameters of Ulbrich’s distribution, underlining that Pn/I depends on the intrinsic characteristics of rainfall. In this thesis at first a review concerning the Rain Drop Size Distribution measurement techniques that have been used and improved during the years, Rain Drop Size Distribution types, focusing mostly the exponential and gamma distributions, Raindrop terminal velocity and Rainfall energetic characteristics is presented in the Chapter 1. In the other chapters the analysis on DSD measurements carried out at Palermo (Italy) and at El Teularet (Spain), using an optical disdrometer are presented. In particular in the period June 2006 – March 2014 the disdrometer was installed at the experimental site of SAF Department of the University of Palermo, registering during the 544 rainfall events more than 45000 DSDs. From July 2015 to May 2016, the disdrometer was installed at El Teularet and, during the 79 rainfall events over than 5000 DSDs were recorded. For both datasets at first the DSD analysis was carried out, highlighting the high variability of the main <b>statistical</b> index (mean <b>diameter,</b> (D), standard deviation (D), median diameter, D 50, median volume diameter, D 0) with I. However despite the dispersion of the data the standard deviation (D) and median volume diameter, D 0, of the distribution seem to show a slight trend with I and the pairs (I, (D)) and (I, D 0) referred to Palermo and El Teularet datasets are overlapped. This result suggests that the same rainfall intensity could generate different raindrop size distributions. The reliability of Ulbrich’s law for reproducing measured DSDs in both sites was positively verified using both maximum likelihood method and momentum methods (MM 1 and MM 2) for estimating  and  parameters of the distribution. The raindrop size measurements were used to determine the experimental rainfall kinetic power values, Pn. The experimental pairs (I, Pn/I) obtained by the two datasets are overlapped and it seems that the ratio Pn/I tends to increase when rainfall intensity increases. The measured Pn values allowed to verify positively the reliability of the relationship theoretically deduced by Carollo and Ferro (2015) for rainfall kinetic power estimate in Sicily and in Spain. The exponential distribution of Marshall and Palmer (1948), when it is referred to the unit area and time, can be assumed formally identical to a Gamma distribution (Ulbrich, 1983) setting  = 0. 67. According to Ulbrich (1983), D 0 is linked only to and  parameters so that, assuming = 0. 67, parameter can be deduced by only D 0 value. Therefore, the relationship theoretically deduced by Carollo and Ferro (2015) for estimating kinetic power by  and values can be rewritten obtaining that the ratio Pn/I depends directly on median volume diameter D 0. This relationship resulted fully applicable to estimate Pn/I in Mediterranean environments. For both datasets, in order to better focus the influence of rainfall intensity on DSD and rainfall energetic characteristics, the DSDs were aggregated in intensity classes. This procedure yields 59 DSDs for Palermo and 54 for El Teularet experimental sites characterized by rainfall intensity values ranging respectively from 0. 8 to 203 mm/h and from 0. 7 to 150 mm/h. The DSD analysis highlighted that, for a given rainfall intensity, the DSDs registered at Palermo present mean, median diameter and standard deviation values greater than the ones detected in El Teularet. Instead, the median volume diameter (D 0) values are practically overlapped. In other words, for a given intensity, the rainfall occurring at El Teularet presents characteristics different from the one detected at Palermo. In any case, both datasets are characterized by similar trend with I: the mean and median diameter showed an increasing trend for the lowest values of rainfall intensity (I 15 mm/h; the standard deviation and the median volume diameter of the distribution increase with rainfall intensity values until I = 40 mm/h and then become quasi-constant. The reliability of Ulbrich’s law for reproducing measured DSDs in both sites was positively verified using both maximum likelihood and momentum methods (MM 1 and MM 2) for estimating  and  parameters of the distribution. The aggregated raindrop size distributions were used to determine the experimental rainfall kinetic power values, Pn. The experimental pairs (I, Pn/I) obtained by the two datasets are overlapped. This circumstance implies that, in the two experimental sites, the same rainfall intensity determines different DSDs and similar kinetic power values. As well as D 0, the ratio Pn/I increases with rainfall intensity for I less than or equal to 40 mm/h and then it becomes quasi-constant. This trend agrees with Wischmeier and Smith (1978) approach even if the threshold value of rainfall intensity (It = 40 mm/h) resulted less than the one proposed by Wischmeier and Smith (1978) (It = 76 mm/h). The measured kinetic power values were used for verifying in both sites the reliability of the most known empirical relationship for kinetic power estimate, i. e. Wischmeier and Smith (1978) and Kinnell (1981) relationships. The Wischmeier and Smith (1978) relationship is fully applicable for estimating the kinetic power of the rainfall both in Sicilian both in Spanish environments. In particular it does not need to be recalibrate but it is enough setting the threshold value of the rainfall intensity equal to 40 mm/h for obtaining a good estimate of the Pn. Instead of having an acceptable estimate of the rainfall kinetic power the relationship proposed by Kinnell (1981) needs to be calibrated on data. In fact for both datasets the use of the parameter values suggested by McGregor et al. (1995) allows a systematic underestimation of Pn, instead the parameter values suggested by Brown and Foster (1987) produce a systematic overestimation of the kinetic power for the highest values of rainfall intensity. Finally the comparison between the pairs (I, Pn/I and I, D 0) corresponding to datasets of present investigation with the ones obtained in other sites of the world (Marshall Islands, New Jersey, Alaska, Indonesia, Oregon, Franklin, Hong Kong, Ethiopia) by different measurement techniques (drop camera, piezoelectric force transducer, blotting paper) was presented. In particular it highlighted that these datasets did not overlap. Therefore a single relationship Pn/I - I or D 0 -I is not reliable for estimating rainfall kinetic power at any site. Instead, the experimental pairs (D 0, Pn/I) relative to all available datasets resulted quasi-perfectly aligned around a single increasing curve. The theoretically derived relationship linking Pn/I to D 0 resulted fully applicable to all available datasets. This relationship represents a theoretical confirmation of the Wischmeier and Smith (1978) hypothesis according to which the Pn/I depends on median volume diameter that represents a variable free from at site effects and useful to characterized rainfall erosivity...|$|R
