60|$|Wade {{remained}} {{all night}} with Lewis, and next morning rode six miles along the divide, and then down into a valley, where at length he found a cabin described by the prospector. It was well hidden in {{the edge of the}} forest, where a spring gushed from under a low cliff. But for water and horse tracks Wade would not have found it easily. Rifle in hand, and on foot, he slipped around in the woods, as a hunter might have, to stalk drinking deer. There were no smoke, no noise, no horses anywhere round the cabin, and after watching awhile Wade went forward to look at it. It was an old ramshackle hunter's or prospector's cabin, with dirt floor, a crumbling fireplace and chimney, and a bed platform made of boughs. Including the door, it had three apertures, and the two smaller ones, serving as windows, looked {{as if they had been}} intended for port-holes as well. The inside of the cabin was large and unusually well lighted, owing to the windows and to the open chinks between the logs. Wade saw a deck of cards lying bent and scattered in one corner, as if a violent hand had flung them against the wall. Strange that Wade's memory returned a vivid picture of Jack Belllounds in just that act of violence! The only other thing around the place which earned scrutiny from Wade was a number of horseshoe tracks outside, with the left front <b>shoe</b> <b>track</b> familiar to him. He examined the clearest imprints very carefully. If they had not been put there by Wilson Moore's white mustang, Spottie, then they had been made by a horse with a strangely similar hoof and shoe. Spottie had a hoof malformed, somewhat in the shape of a triangle, and the iron shoe to fit it always had to be bent, so that the curve was sharp and the ends closer together than those of his other shoes.|$|E
5000|$|... 3. Cementing inadequate. Cementing {{proceeded}} a) without flushing the annulus {{around the}} <b>shoe</b> <b>track</b> at sufficiently high rate and duration to ensure full circumferential removal of compressed sediment and good distribution of cement, and b) without converting the float collar to activate its two check valves to prevent cement backflow. Cement quality and strength {{may have been}} reduced by contamination on its way down the casing, or by mixing with lower density mud in the rathole. There was no cementing evaluation log at Macondo, which may have shown it to be inadequate. 4. Pressure test wrongly interpreted. Drill pipe was run to 8,367 ft ready for mud displacement. During the [...] "negative pressure test", for {{which there was no}} detailed procedure, no flow from the kill line was accepted and 1,400 psi on the drill pipe was ignored.|$|E

50|$|In {{their search}} {{immediately}} following the accident, police discovered a trail of tennis <b>shoe</b> <b>tracks</b> beginning in a desolate field approximately 0.75 mi {{from the scene of}} the crash. Based {{on the size of the}} <b>shoe</b> impressions, the <b>tracks</b> were believed to be Meehan's. Investigators followed the tracks until 3 a.m. on the morning of April 21, before finding that they eventually disappeared in the terrain. The search was suspended until the following morning.|$|R
50|$|In {{the spring}} of 2017 Altura {{introduced}} their first smart running <b>shoe</b> combining both <b>tracking</b> and coaching technology. The Torin IQ <b>shoe</b> <b>tracks</b> how fast and how far you run and it's equipped with a voice coach that gives you real-time advice, via a tether to a smartphone, on how to run better during a workout. The shoe is designed {{for both men and}} women and has an embedded sensor in the insole that measures a runners landing zone, cadence, ground contact time, and impact rate. The sensors in the show are powered by button cell batteries which can be replaced after an estimated 80 - 100 hours of use.|$|R
50|$|Many trials involve highly {{technical}} {{testimony about}} the chemistry and biology {{of evidence and}} the physics of how it was analyzed. The goal should always be to eliminate questions before they become an issue; aim to never lose a case on a technicality. On cases that go to court, any unexplained evidence collected at the scene needs to be identified. Unidentified evidence such as latent fingerprints, <b>shoe</b> <b>tracks,</b> hair, blood, and DNA swabbing {{will need to be}} identified.|$|R

He left a trail--he left tracks behind. He made a crooked horseshoe, like that Wils Moore's horse wears, an' he put that on his own horse. An' he made a contraption--a little iron ring with a dot in it, an' he left the crooked <b>shoe</b> <b>tracks,</b> an' he left the little ring tracks--" ...|$|R

50|$|Grousers are {{commonly}} used on construction vehicles such as bulldozers, loaders, and excavators. Grousers may be permanently attached to, or formed as a single piece with, the <b>track</b> <b>shoe,</b> {{or they may be}} bolted onto the <b>track</b> <b>shoe</b> for ease of replacement as they become worn. While grousers are usually straight, they may have more complex shapes, including spikes and involute curves, {{depending on the type of}} terrain and the performance requirements of the vehicle. Grousers are typically made of metal, such as forged steel, and are not designed for use on paved roads. Various devices, with names such as road bands, have been developed to temporarily cover grousers/cleats in order to allow a vehicle to drive on paved roads.|$|R
50|$|Track {{construction}} and assembly is {{dictated by the}} application. Military vehicles use a <b>track</b> <b>shoe</b> that is integral {{to the structure of}} the chain in order to reduce track weight. Reduced weight allows the vehicle to move faster and decreases overall vehicle weight to ease transportation. Since track weight is completely unsprung, reducing it improves suspension performance at speeds where the track's momentum is significant. In contrast, agricultural and construction vehicles opt for a <b>track</b> with <b>shoes</b> that attach to the chain with bolts and do not form part of the chain's structure. This allows <b>track</b> <b>shoes</b> to break without compromising the ability of the vehicle to move and decrease productivity but increases the overall weight of the track and vehicle.|$|R

50|$|The Pennsylvania Railroad {{financed the}} {{construction}} of the Bald Eagle Valley Railroad line through the valley, along the flood plain from Tyrone to Lock Haven. When completed in 1865, it used the Bellefonte & Snow <b>Shoe</b> Railroad <b>track</b> between Wingate and Milesburg. The Pennsylvania Railroad bought the Bellefonte & Snow Shoe Railroad in 1881, making its former line the Snow Shoe and Bellefonte branches. The Snow Shoe branch has been abandoned, but the Nittany and Bald Eagle Railroad short line still runs the lines from Tyrone to Lock Haven and Bellefonte.|$|R
50|$|PEBA {{is found}} in the sports {{equipment}} market: for damping system components and outsoles of high end <b>shoes</b> (running, <b>track</b> & field, football, baseball, basketball, trekking, etc.) where it is appreciated for its low density, damping properties, energy return and flexibility. PEBA is also appreciated by winter sports participants as it enables design of the lightest alpine and Nordic ski boots while providing some resistance to extreme environment (low temperatures, UV exposure, moisture). It is used in various other sports applications such as racquet grommets and golf balls.|$|R
5000|$|Eleanor and Paul Kidd {{continued}} to sell mainly arch supports until 1960, when they designed and manufactured the [...] "Trackster", the world's first running shoe {{made with a}} ripple sole. It {{was also the first}} running shoe to come in varying widths. The [...] "Trackster" [...] was given a big boost through the YMCA programs in which it became the unofficial <b>shoe.</b> College <b>track</b> teams such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Tufts University and Boston University adopted the New Balance Trackster for their cross-country teams, soon to be followed by other colleges and private high schools around the country.|$|R
50|$|With a {{suspended}} sliding coil, the cables are coiled like a spring, with each loop of the coil {{attached to a}} sliding <b>shoe</b> on a <b>track.</b> As the cabling is played out, the shoes slide individually along the track and the coils expand. When sliding the other direction, the coils fold back together into a compact spiral.|$|R

50|$|The shoes {{themselves}} {{are made of}} flexible compounds, typically featuring a sole made of dense rubber. While the original design was basic, manufacturers have since tailored athletic shoes for their specific purposes. An {{example of this is}} the spiked <b>shoe</b> developed for <b>track</b> running. Many of these shoes are made up to very large sizes for athletes with large feet.|$|R
5000|$|In most <b>track</b> <b>shoes,</b> the {{toe region}} bends up to allow space for {{protruding}} spikes {{and to encourage}} athletes to run on their toes. This upward angle, known as [...] "taper," [...] varies widely depending on the intended use of the shoe, and the taper angle can be rigid or flexible. Shoes with a large taper {{are said to be}} [...] "aggressive." ...|$|R
