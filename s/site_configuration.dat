40|$|Although larval {{dispersal}} {{is crucial}} for the persistence of most marine populations, dispersal connectivity between sites is rarely considered in designing marine protected area networks. In particular the role of structural characteristics (known as topology) for the network of larval dispersal routes in the conservation of metapopulations has not been addressed. To determine reserve <b>site</b> <b>configurations</b> that provide highest persistence values {{with respect to their}} connectivity characteristics, we model nine connectivity topological models derived from graph theory in a demographic metapopulation model. We identify reserve <b>site</b> <b>configurations</b> that provide the highest persistence values for each of the metapopulation connectivity models. Except for the minimally connected and fully connected populations, we observed two general ‘rules of thumb’ for optimising the mean life time for all topological models: firstly place the majority of reserves, so that they are neighbours of each other, on the sites where the number of connections between the populations is highest (hub), secondly when the reserves have occupied the majority of the vertices in the hub, then select another area of high connectivity and repeat. If there are no suitable hubs remaining then distribute the remaining reserves to isolated locations optimising contact with non-reserved sites...|$|R

40|$|Calcium vector protein (CaVP), a new protein {{isolated}} from Amphioxus muscle, binds in a Ca 2 + -rgulated manner to a 27 kd target protein, named CaVPT, whose function {{has not been}} elucidated yet. CaVP bears significant sequence homology to both calmodulin and skeletal muscle troponin C, especially in the C-tenninal half of the molecule, which presumably contains the two functional Ca 2 + sites. The N-terminal half contains two abortive EF-hands and is intramolecularly crosslinked with a disulfide bond. Using the crystallographic structures of calmodulin and striated muscle troponin C as a framework, we constructed two different three-dimensional models of CaVP and modeled the intramolecular disulfide bridge. The modeling based upon the coordinates of calmodulin yields a Ca 2 + -filled <b>sites</b> <b>configuration</b> in the N-terminal half of the molecule, even though no Ca 2 + is bound in this half, whereas the troponin C-derived model generates a Ca 2 + -empty <b>sites</b> <b>configuration.</b> The models predict that neither in the Ca 2 + nor in the Ca 2 + -empty sites conformation is there any steric and/or energetic obstacle {{for the formation of}} the disulfide bridge and that the disulfide bond is poorly accessible to reducing reagents.

50|$|The Macquarie Point {{facility}} {{is out of}} date in terms of handling the size of modern freight trains, and lacks any space for a major redevelopment. It {{is located in the}} immediate area of a residential and tourist precinct, and is close to the Hobart CBD. It features many short holding tracks that prevent trains being moved as a single continuous vehicle which causes extensive Shunting throughout loading operations. These delays occur in addition to long travel times south of Bridgewater, where the main north/south railway line follows the River Derwent through Hobart's northern suburbs, across 21 level crossings which require slow train speeds to minimize the risk of accidents. The Macquarie Point site features a poor quality surface with uneven levels which creates difficulties for the loading, unloading and manoeuvring of freight across the site. The <b>site</b> <b>configuration</b> does not allow for efficient truck consolidation and deconsolidation and adds to the delays borne by transport companies waiting for containers to be unloaded.Management and security is also difficult because of numerous entry points and the poor rail layout.|$|E
5000|$|Building {{typology}} {{refers to}} the study and documentation {{of a set of}} buildings which have similarities in their type of function or form. There are two ways of looking at the term [...] "building typology". The first is a functional typology that categorizes buildings into groups by the similarity of their use. A functional building typology under this definition may create groups such as hospitals, schools, and shopping centers (see more examples in the list of building types by use). The second is a typology that groups buildings according to their forms, which is explained is this article. Formal building typology may be based on configuration, format, or relationships of building to streets and each other. Any single functional type can be subdivided into formal types. For example, the residential functional type may be further subdivided into formal categories such as high rise towers, single family homes, duplexes, and townhouses. The townhouse building is one formal type that has a specific configuration: single units are placed side-by-side with others, vertically oriented up to four stories tall, and facing the street. Many more variations of this formal type are found around the world, each with variations that are the result of local materials, cultural habits, age and technology. Documenting a type is the process of discovering the elements of similar forms which are the same. Usually building types are distinguished by their basic form, <b>site</b> <b>configuration,</b> and scale, but not their specific architectural style, color, or even precise use.and are related to the era, the culture, and the environment in which they arise.|$|E
50|$|Important civic {{buildings}} of this time, {{most of which}} were designed with classical detailing intended to re-affirm the power and presence of government in the community, include the Cairns City Council Chambers, former Cairns Court House and Public Offices (now Cairns Regional Gallery), the former Cairns Customs House, former Cairns Post Office, former Cairns Telegraph Office and Cairns State High School. Other prominent {{buildings of}} the period also designed with classical detailing include the Cairns Masonic Temple and the Cairns Post building. The construction of these buildings reflected the confidence of the Queensland Government and the local community in the growth of Cairns as an important regional centre during the interwar period.The Cairns Divisional Board was established in 1879 by the Divisional Boards Act of that year, later becoming the Cairns Shire Council and then the Mulgrave Shire Council. In 1885 the Cairns Municipal Council was set up to administer the town area, and an allotment of land was set aside as a municipal reserve some blocks away from the main settlement of lower Abbott Street, on the corner of Aplin Street. The Cairns Municipal Council Chambers, a timber building, was constructed on the site, and in 1886 the Council applied for a public market reserve on land adjoining the municipal reserve fronting Lake Street, with a roadway entrance from Abbott Street. This was established in 1886, and in 1893 one allotment of the public market reserve fronting Lake Street was surrendered for a fire brigade station use, and two smaller allotments fronting Abbott Street were included as part of the public market reserve, resulting in the current <b>site</b> <b>configuration.</b> In June 1940 the previous reserves were cancelled and the site was gazetted as a reserve for local government purposes. In July of that year, a deed of grant upon trust for local government purposes was issued to the Cairns City Council for the site.|$|E

On the other hand, specific characteristics related to the web environment and web sites in particular are considered. The web site is modelled by an AND/OR type graph. The model serves as a useful abstraction simplifying the process of configuration building. Being essentially a graph search, it is inevitable to have a method for selecting a proper version. Presented approach is best suited for web sites where several variants of web pages exist. It is advantageous for example for presentation of multilingual web sites.
