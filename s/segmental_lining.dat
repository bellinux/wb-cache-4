40|$|The {{application}} of the mechanized tunnelling has been extended in recent years. There are at present different approaches {{that are used in}} the design of segmental tunnel linings supported in mechanized tunnels. Even though <b>segmental</b> <b>lining</b> is utilized for mechanized tunnels, its behaviour is still quite unclear under in situ stress and {{there is a lack of}} data regarding the distribution of stresses inside segmental linings. So far no single effective calculation method exists for <b>segmental</b> <b>lining</b> design. The lack of clear solutions makes the use of <b>segmental</b> <b>lining</b> to be more expensive due to the adoption of greater safety factors. Therefore, a particular attention must be given in order to obtain data from monitored tunnels which permits to validate design methods. In this study, strain measurements, which were conducted during the construction of twin tunnels in the Bologna-Florence railway line, have been presented. The behaviour of <b>segmental</b> <b>lining</b> during the excavation and the influence of a new tunnel excavation on an existing tunnel have been shown through the measured data. The data are then compared with the results obtained with Einstein and Schwartz's method and Duddeck and Erdmann's method, which permits to highlight the fact that the two analytical methods underestimate structural forces induced in the <b>segmental</b> <b>lining</b> and then must be used with cautio...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe uniform ring {{model and}} the shell-spring model for <b>segmental</b> <b>lining</b> design are {{reviewed}} in this article. The former is the most promising means to reflect the real behavior of <b>segmental</b> <b>lining,</b> while the latter {{is the most popular}} means in practice due to its simplicity. To understand the relationship and the difference between these two models, both of them are applied to the engineering practice of Fuzhou Metro Line I, where the key parameters used in both models are described and compared. The effective ratio of bending rigidity η reflecting the relative stiffness between <b>segmental</b> <b>lining</b> and surrounding ground and the transfer ratio of bending moment ξ reflecting the relative stiffness between segment and joint, which are two key parameters used in the uniform ring model, are especially emphasized. The reasonable values for these two key parameters are calibrated by comparing the bending moments calculated from both two models. Through case studies, it is concluded that the effective ratio of bending rigidity η increases significantly with good soil properties, increases slightly with increasing overburden, and decreases slightly with increasing water head. Meanwhile, the transfer ratio of bending moment ξ seems to only relate to the properties of <b>segmental</b> <b>lining</b> itself and has a minor relation with the ground conditions. These results could facilitate the design practice for Fuzhou Metro Line I, and could also provide some references to other projects with respect to similar scenarios...|$|E

40|$|There {{are several}} methods for {{analysing}} the behaviour of underground structures under different loading conditions.

In this study, numerical modelling of the <b>segmental</b> <b>lining</b> of a tunnel was analysed using a sensitivity analysis of the static modelling. The numerical results were obtained by using a finite difference method (FLAC 2 D). Using this form of analysis, a new simple methodology was introduced so that more reliable results can be obtained.

40|$|Segmental tunnel linings are now {{often used}} for seismic areas. However, the {{influence}} of segment joints on the <b>segmental</b> <b>lining</b> behavior under seismic loading has not been thoroughly considered in the literature.

The proposed model allows studying the effect of the rotational joint stiffness, radial stiffness and the axial stiffness of the longitudinal joints. The numerical results show that a <b>segmental</b> <b>lining</b> can perform better than a continuous lining during earthquake. It has been seen that the influence of the joint distribution, the joint rotational stiffness, the joint axial stiffness, Young[U+ 05 F 3]s modulus of the ground surrounding the tunnel, the lateral earth pressure factor and the maximum shear strain should not be neglected.

40|$|The seismic {{vulnerability}} assessment of tunnels is generally based on empirical fragility curves. They {{are derived from}} the statistical analysis of observed damages in past earthquakes. Some authors have calculated fragility curves {{based on the results}} of numerical analyses, defining the damage index in terms of ratio between the flexural demand and capacity of the structural section of the tunnel lining. However, the tunnel lining is generally assumed as a continuous ring, while in the case of mechanized tunneling it is made of jointed segments. Recent studies modeling with FEA the non-linear dynamic interaction between the <b>segmental</b> <b>lining</b> and the soil have shown the significant effect of the jointed pattern of a <b>segmental</b> <b>lining.</b> On one hand, it implies a lower structural demand than a continuous ring, due to its larger flexibility and compressibility in the transverse section; on the other hand, permanent rotations of the joints are often calculated at the end of the earthquake, that may represent a further structural fragility of a <b>segmental</b> <b>lining,</b> since they may produce dislocation of sealing gaskets among segments. Limited available post-earthquake reconnaissance, would seem to indicate that in some cases damage at the segments joints has been observed. In this study, a set of FEA was carried out using a strain hardening elastic-plastic model with small strain overlay. Several input signals were used and different ground conditions were modelled in order to define fragility curves for damage associated to joint permanent rotation in a segmental tunnel lining. The results are presented and discussed in the paper...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} the {{research}} reported in this paper wa s driven by the Crossrail project in London for which new tunnels were constructed close to numerous existing operational tunnel s of the London Underground (LU) network. This research component is based on expe rimental work conducted on half - scale grey ca st iron (GCI) tunnel lining segments with chemical composition similar to the Victor ian age GCI segments in the LU network. This paper discusses the deformation behaviour of the bolted <b>segmental</b> <b>lining</b> {{under the influence of}} factors such as overburden pre ssure, bolt preload and presence of grommets at small distortions. The measured behaviour of the <b>segmental</b> <b>lining</b> is compared against the calculated response of a continuous lining based on the assumption of elasticity. The industry practice for tunnel li ning assessment is to calculate the induced bending moment in the tunnel lining using an elastic continuum model, while adopting a reduced lining stiffness {{to take into account the}} presence of the joints. Case studies have recorded that both loosening and tightening of lining bolts have been used as mitigation measures to reduce the impact of new tunnel excavations on existing GCI tunnels. T he experimental work on the half - scale GCI lining has shown that a bolted <b>segmental</b> <b>lining</b> behaves as a continuous rin g under the small distortion s imposed when subjected to hoop forces relevant to the depth of burial of LU tunnels. In the presence of hoop force, joint opening was minimal and the magnitude of preload in the bolts had little impact on the behaviour of the lining. It is therefore concluded that disturbance of the bolts in existing tunnels is not recommended as a mitigation measure as in addition to being ineffective it is both time consuming and introduces the risk of damaging the tunnel lining flanges...|$|E

It {{remains one of the}} most downloaded Deleuze Studies papers since 2013, and is an attempt to present an overview of Deleuze's philosophy through the concept of lines of life. In his dialogues with Claire Parnet, Deleuze asserts that: [...] "Whether we are individuals or groups, we are made of lines" [...] (Deleuze and Parnet 2007: 124). In A Thousand Plateaus (with Guattari), Deleuze calls these kinds of 'lifelines' or 'lines of flesh': break <b>line</b> (or <b>segmental</b> <b>line,</b> or molar line), crack line (or molecular line) and rupture line (also called line of flight) (Deleuze and Guattari 2004a: 22). Luis de Miranda explains the difference between these three lines, how they are related to the 'soul', and how a singular individual or group can arise from the play of the lines. Eventually, he introduces the concept of 'Creal' to develop the Deleuzian figure of the 'Anomal', the so(u)rcerer.|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} {{field of}} shield tunneling has extended in recent years. Most shield-driven tunnels {{are supported by}} segmental concrete linings. Although many well documented experimental, numerical and analytical results exist in literature concerning the functioning of segmental tunnel linings, their behavior {{under the influence of}} joints is still not clear. This paper presents a numerical study that has been performed to investigate the factors that affect <b>segmental</b> tunnel <b>lining</b> behavior. Analyses have been carried out using a two-dimensional finite difference element model. The longitudinal joint between segments in a ring has been simulated through double node connections, with six degrees of freedom, represented by six springs. The proposed model allows the effect of not only the rotational stiffness but also the radial stiffness and the axial stiffness of the longitudinal joints to be taken into consideration. The numerical results show a significant reduction in the bending moment induced in the tunnel lining as the joint number increases. The tunnel behavior in terms of the bending moment considering the effect of joint distribution, when the lateral earth pressure factor K 0 is equal to 0. 5, 1. 5 and 2, is almost similar and differs when K 0 is equal to unity. It has been seen that the influence of joint rotational stiffness, the reduction in joint rotation stiffness under the negative bending moment, the lateral earth pressure factor and Young's modulus of ground surrounding the tunnel should not be neglected. On the other hand, the results have also shown an insignificant influence of the axial and radial stiffness of the joints on <b>segmental</b> tunnel <b>lining</b> behavio...|$|R

The impact of the processes during mechanized excavation, such as the grouting pressure and the jacking forces in the structural forces induced in the tunnel lining, has been presented.

Generally, a variation in the structural forces in successive rings along the tunnel axis has been found in a staggered <b>segmental</b> <b>lining,</b> indicating the necessity of simulating the joints in the tunnel lining and using a full three-dimensional numerical model to obtain an accurate estimation.

30|$|In present {{concrete}} construction, {{elastic rubber}} strips in sealing and waterproofing joints of assembling segments have been commonly used. For underground concrete structures, standard design for sealing joints uses Ethylene-Propylene-Diene Monomer (EPDM) polymer rubber strips arranged circumferentially {{on the end}} faces of the segment (Ding et al. 2017). Putty-based composite rubber strips have great viscosity and elasticity, which can compensate {{to a certain degree}} for the adverse effect of the interface defects at joints. To evaluate the waterproofing ability at joints, special attention is directed to the sealant behavior of the EPDM sealing strips. A time-dependent constitutive model is proposed to assess the long-term waterproof ability of EPDM rubber used in segmental joints (Shi et al. 2015). At present, there are few requirements for rubber strips in the design specifications, and there is limited understanding of the relationship between applied forces and waterproofing performance. In addition, precast concrete structures incorporate a groove at the joint interface for the rubber strip positioning (Hu et al. 2009). The type of groove at the joint interface can limit rubber strip lateral deformation, which can increase pressure on the strip and improve waterproofing ability. The various types of grooves offer different degrees of constraint. Therefore, mechanical properties of rubber strips along with groove design at precast concrete structure joints are key elements in waterproof design. The joint open width is also regarded as a key performance indicator, since it is the weakest part of the shield <b>segmental</b> <b>lining</b> (Liao et al. 2008; Zhang et al. 2015). As the weakest and vulnerable point in the <b>segmental</b> <b>lining,</b> joints have been investigated in experiments (Ding et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2015; Kiani et al. 2016), numerical analyses (Ding et al. 2004; Teachavorasinskun and Chub-uppakarn 2010) and case studies (Jun 2011; Basnet and Panthi 2018). Testing apparatus was designed to accurately monitor water leakage pressure of segmental joints under various combinations of opening and offsets (Ding et al. 2017). Molins and Arnau (2011) presented an in situ load test and 3 D numerical simulation on a full-scale <b>segmental</b> <b>lining</b> for the Barcelona metro line.

40|$|Historically, {{attempts}} to use tunnel boring machines (TBMs) in Himalayan geology have been unsuccessful, particularly where weak rocks exist at the significant depths often required for hydroelectric hydraulic tunnels resulting in squeezing ground conditions. The use of segmental tunnel linings erected by shielded TBMs presents additional risk, {{such that the}} advantages of potentially high rates of advance using this form of construction have not previously been realised. Programme demands for the 330 MW Kishanganga Hydroelectric Project in India required that 15 km of the 23 km headrace tunnel be constructed using a double-shield TBM erecting a <b>segmental</b> <b>lining.</b> Preliminary studies suggested difficult ground due to squeezing conditions along the 1400 m deep tunnel through weak meta-sedimentary rocks. To allow planning and construction to commence, a risk management approach to design and construction was formulated with contingency procedures and criteria developed to allow the risks to the TBM and the lining to be managed effectively.

A basal and a subbasal in spot in 1c, ditto in lb, and a basal and two other spots in 1 a.Head black with a few whitish dots and two tufts on collar,thorax black with whitish marks, abdomen black above withwhitish <b>segmental</b> <b>lines</b> and lateral spots. Claws unequal.Female like the male and presenting the same variations of pattern.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{concerns}} {{the design of}} Steel Fibre Reinforced Concrete (SFRC) precast tunnel elements, based on the new international building code, the fib New Model Code. Precast elements for tunnel linings are designed by considering several loading conditions. Some of these loading configurations can be studied by means of simplified analytical approaches which enable to easily include the FRC resistant contribution according to fib Model Code. On the other hand, some mechanisms need to be studied by means of nonlinear analyses based on fracture mechanics in order to properly assess the benefits due to fibres. These mechanisms generally occur during the lining construction process, since they are correlated {{to the introduction of}} the TBM’s thrust jack forces (thrust jack phase) or depend on torsion effects caused by the ovalisation of lining rings outside the TBM’s shield during the grouting process. The present paper {{concerns the}} study of a <b>segmental</b> tunnel <b>lining</b> by means of non-linear numerical analyses concerning the so-called thrust jack phase. The FE analyses are carried out by using the constitutive fracture-law proposed by the fib New Model Code...|$|R
50|$|A portal with pilasters and a <b>segmental</b> cornice is <b>lined</b> with lion {{statues and}} {{decorated}} with the coat of arms of Count Joseph Keglevich. Above the portal, on red base of the coat of arms are two silver stripes. In the upper blue part there are two golden lions holding a sword with a golden hilt. The crown with nine pearls is run into that hilt, a symbol of countship. Above the shield in the coat of arms {{there are a few}} other crowns with nine pearls. Hereditary lions were one of the favourite symbols. They were also used the enhance the sculptural decoration of the portal.|$|R
