40|$|Abstract Background Despite the {{increase}} in the number of clinical trials in low and middle income countries (LMICs), there has been little serious discussion of whether First in Human (FIH; phase 0 and phase 1) clinical trials should be conducted in LMICs, and if so, under what conditions. Based on our own experience, <b>studies</b> <b>and</b> <b>consultations,</b> this paper aims to stimulate debate on our contention that for products meant primarily for conditions most prevalent in LMICs, FIH trials should preferably be done first in those countries. Discussion There are scientific and pragmatic arguments that support conducting FIH trials in LMIC. Furthermore, the changing product-development and regulatory landscape, and the likelihood of secondary benefits such as capacity building for innovation and for research ethics support our argument. These arguments take into account the critical importance of protecting human subjects of research while developing capacity to undertake FIH trials. Summary While FIH trials have historically not been conducted in LMICs, the situation in some of these countries has changed. Hence, we have argued that FIH should be conducted in LMICs for products meant primarily for conditions that are most prevalent in those contexts; provided the necessary protections for human subjects are sufficient. </p...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: In this study, the {{relationship}} between sex hormone levels and erectile dysfunction (ED), {{as well as the}} necessity of routinely measuring sex hormone levels were evaluated. Materials and Methods: This study included one hundred patients admitted to a urology clinic for sexual dysfunction. To determine the hormone levels, following the history (included IIEF- 5 score) and physical examination, triple blood samples were collected at intervals of 15 minutes between 08 : 00 and 10 : 00 am. Total and free testosterone, prolactin, follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels were studied. Results: Mean age was 43 (23 - 80) years. IIEF- 5 score was less than 21 [9. 8 - 4. 3 (3 - 19) ] in all study groups. There was a statistically significant correlation between tT and FSH, as well as between LH and FSH in Pearson (r =- 0. 513, p 0. 05). Of the 100 patients, 18 (18 %) had low tT, 77 (77 %) had normal and 5 (5 %) had high tT levels. No statistically significant correlation was found between decreased libido and tT levels (p> 0. 05). Twelve (66. 6 %) of the 18 patients with low tT had normal libido. Conclusion: Analyzing the medical history in detail and performing a thorough physical examination can reduce the need for excessive <b>studies</b> <b>and</b> <b>consultations,</b> and enables patients to save time and costs...|$|E

40|$|Canada’s {{newly minted}} federal {{minister}} of the environment, Catherine McKenna, decided on February 18, 2016 to delay the federal government’s decision on a proposal to construct a permanent repository for nuclear waste beneath the Bruce nuclear site, {{little more than a}} kilometre from Lake Huron. Officially called a ‘deep geologic repository’, or DGR, the facility is the brainchild of Ontario Power Generation. While it would not store fuel rods from nuclear plants, it would take in all other types of low- and intermediate-level radioactive wastes including concrete, equipment and protective gear from the continued operation and planned refurbishment of all Ontario’s 20 nuclear power reactors. While most of the <b>studies</b> <b>and</b> <b>consultations</b> were done when the Conservative government was in power, Minister McKenna has now delayed the decision pending more information and will seek a further extension for the review from cabinet at a later date. A federal panel appointed by then {{minister of the}} environment, Peter Kent, and the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission gave its overall seal of approval to the controversial proposal in May 2015. The panel’s favourable view overcame a major regulatory hurdle {{in the construction of the}} DGR however since the panel released its decision after public hearings, political opposition to this plan has only grown and spread. Critics argue that low-level and intermediate-level waste from all Ontario’s nuclear reactors should not be stored so close to the source of 20 percent of the world’s surface fresh water. The proposal’s scientific and technical merits and demerits are already well documented in various reports and hearings, but more controversy is expected now that the federal minister of the environment has announced another setback to the proposal. We can probably expect more political debate and long delays...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{synthesis}} of a dissertation published in June 2009 as partial fulfilment of the requirements for the conferment of the Bachelor of Accountancy Honours degree of the University of Malta, on the recommendation and {{in collaboration with the}} Malta Institutes of Accountants. On 5 June 2008, the European Commission issued a recommendation concerning the limitation of the civil liability of statutory auditors and audit firms. This followed a number of <b>studies</b> <b>and</b> <b>consultations</b> mandated by the European Commission in reaction to strong representations received from auditors concerned with the increasing trend of litigation and lack of insurance cover, The Recommendation aims to protect the supply of statutory audits within European Capital markets by shielding audit firms from disproportionate liability claims. Although the Recommendation proposes three possible methods, each member state, including Malta, will be free to choose a method which best suits its legal environment. The Commission must be informed of the actions taken by member states in the light of this Recommendation by 5 June 2010. The objective {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the applicability of this Recommendation within the Maltese audit market. The paper will first discuss the notion of liability limitation itself, the impact of such limitation on audit quality, the relevance of insurability and market concentration as well as the impact on investors and companies. The rest of the paper will then evaluate the applicability of the three proposals suggested by the Recommendation. The findings of the paper are based on the results of e-mailed questionnaires filed by 36 participants comprising audit firms, listed companies, banks and insurances as well as twelve interviews carried out with a selection of the respondents. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Background: Mental health {{legislations}} {{have the}} primary aim {{of protecting the}} rights of patients and providing appropriate care. Provision for civil commitment of persons of unsound mind {{is an important component}} of this. In Tanzania as elsewhere the law places responsibility on the police and court for the identification of persons of unsound mind to be cared for. The extent of knowledge and awareness of the provisions of mental health legislation among patients, their relatives and relevant professionals is unknown. The views and preferences of patients, their relatives and other stakeholders regarding the process of implementation of the law is also unknown. Objectives: To determine degree of knowledge on mental health law among health workers, police officers, lawyers, judges, patients and their relatives as well as their opinion regarding the provisions ofthe law and its implementation Materials and method: A cross sectional study was conducted among police officers, lawyers, doctors, nurses, patients and their relatives. Data was collected using an interviewer administered questionnaire for patient and relatives and self administered questionnaire for professionals. Results: This study found that, the level of awareness of mental health law on civil commitment of mentally ill patient in Kinondoni division and Department of Psychiatry Muhimbili National Hospital, Dar es Salaam city was low (34. 4 %) and the level of knowledge was even lower (24. 4 %). Awareness of mental health law on civil commitment of mentally ill patients appeared to increase with increasing level of education. Adherence to the laid down procedures of the law was found to be poor among all participant groups studied. Conclusion and Recommendations: This study indicates that the awareness and knowledge of mental health law on civil commitment of mentally ill patients is low. The level of awareness and knowledge should therefore be raised through education and training. There is a need to review the current law to bring it in line with the needs and requirement of relevant stakeholders and remove some of the barriers to its application. Such revision should be preceded by community based <b>studies</b> <b>and</b> <b>consultations</b> with relevant stakeholders...|$|E
