30|$|In {{plants with}} <b>sequential</b> <b>flowering,</b> seed {{predation}} {{may be affected}} by the position of the fruit within the plant (Ehrlén 1996; Kudo et al. 2001; Sánchez et al. 2008). In A. halimus {{there were no significant differences}} in predation levels between different parts of the inflorescence. Mass fruiting appears to favour seed predators and allows them to attack the fruit on different parts of the inflorescence with the same frequency, but this strategy reduces fruiting time and ensures that some fruits avoid total seed destruction (Augspurger 1981; Pías and Guitián 2007; Gomes da Silva and Bezerra Pinheiro 2009). This strategy seems most appropriate when greater seed loss is caused by a specialist predator (Ims 1990), as is the case of the Atriplex population we have studied.|$|E
40|$|Para se entender o papel de cada planta na ecologia de tripes, dois principais critérios precisam ser quantificados: a regularidade {{temporal}} em que os indivíduos são encontrados em uma planta e sua abundância em uma determinada planta relativamente a outras. A escolha de plantas representativas pode fornecer informações que permitam definir padrões temporais de ocorrência e avaliar a importância de fatores ambientais na comunidade destes insetos. Neste contexto, plantas que apresentem floração seqüencial podem prover elementos a respeito da importância de cada hospedeiro em abrigar populações de tripes ao longo do ano. Este estudo teve o objetivo de testar a hipótese de que malpighiáceas com floração seqüencial são responsáveis pela manutenção de tripes no decorrer do ano, assumindo a premissa que tripes migram de planta em planta de acordo com a fenologia de floração. O estudo foi realizado em uma área de Cerrado sentido restrito em Uberlândia, Minas Gerais, Brasil. As plantas estudadas foram Banisteriopsis malifolia, B. campestris, B. laevifolia, Byrsonima intermedia e Peixotoa tomentosa. As coletas foram realizadas de março de 2008 a fevereiro de 2009. Foram encontradas 19 espécies de tripes distribuídas em oito gêneros e três famílias Phlaeothripidae, Thripidae e Heterothripidae, perfazendo 3788 (5. 61 ± 6. 49, X ± 1 SD) indivíduos nas 675 flores analisadas. Testes de fenologia mostraram que todas as cinco malpighiáceas apresentaram floração seqüencial, o que permitiu aos tripes migrarem entre as plantas e encontrarem alimento e abrigo o ano todo. A planta com maior abundância de tripes foi P. tomentosa, seguida por B. laevifolia, no entanto, a diversidade foi maior em B. malifolia. As únicas espécies de tripes presentes em todas as plantas e passíveis de migrar dependendo da fenologia de floração foram Frankliniella condei, Scutothrips nudus, Frankliniella sp. 1. e Heterothrips peixotoa. A riqueza e diversidade encontradas nas malpighiáceas são umas das maiores já registradas para a ocorrência de tripes em plantas relacionadas taxonomicamente e isso se deve ao aspecto conservativo das flores que fornecem tanto alimento quanto proteção contra predadores. Este estudo mostra que malpighiáceas com floração seqüencial têm um importante papel na manutenção da diversidade de tripes, atuando como um recurso natural que auxilia na sobrevivência e diversificação destes insetos no cerrado brasileiro. To {{understand the}} role of each plant species in the ecology of thrips, two principal criteria need to be quantified: the regularity with which individuals are found on a plant species over time, and their abundance on that particular plant species relative to other ones. The choice of representative plants may supply subsidies to define temporary patterns and to evaluate the importance of environmental factors on the community of these insects. In this context <b>sequential</b> <b>flowering</b> plants can provide insightful information {{about the importance of}} each host in supporting thrips populations along the year. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that Malpighiaceae <b>sequential</b> <b>flowering</b> is responsible for the maintenance of thrips throughout the year, assuming the premise that thrips migrate from different plants according to the flowering phenology. Fieldwork was carried out from March 2007 to February 2009 at a strictu sensu Cerrado area in Uberlândia, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. The plants studied comprised Banisteriopsis malifolia, B. campestris, B. laevifolia, Byrsonima intermedia, and Peixotoa tomentosa. We found a total of 19 species of thrips in eight genera distributed in the three families Phlaeothripidae, Thripidae and Heterothripidae. Phenological analysis showed that the five Malpighiaceae species studied presented <b>sequential</b> <b>flowering,</b> enabling thrips to migrate from plants and to find food and shelter along the year. The plant which presented more thrips was P. tomentosa, followed by B. laevifolia whereas the diversity was higher in B. malifolia. The only thrips species present in all plants and likely to migrate from hosts according flowering phenology were Frankliniella condei, Scutothrips nudus, Frankliniella sp. 1 and Heterothrips peixotoa. The richness and diversity recorded are the highest ever sampled for thrips occurrence in a group of related taxonomic plants, because the conservative aspect of Malpighiaceae flowers provide food resources and protection against predators. This study showed that <b>sequential</b> <b>flowering</b> Malpighiaceae {{plays an important role in}} the maintenance of thrips diversity, being an important natural resource to help in the survivorship and diversification of these insects in Brazilian Savanna...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{hypothesis}} {{to explain the}} temporal and spatial patterns of mass flowerings in dipterocarp tree species on the Malay Peninsula. The literature on these mass flowerings reveals that during 1980 – 2002 at least 11 flowerings occurred at irregular intervals of 1 – 6 yr in a lowland rain forest. Five of them were typical mass flowerings—a high density of flowering trees and the characteristic <b>sequential</b> <b>flowering</b> of Shorea species. The 11 flowerings were classified into two flowering times: spring and autumn. There is evidence that low temperature and drought triggered the flowerings. Therefore, the seasonality of mass flowerings {{is characterized by the}} annual patterns of rainfall and low temperature. In addition, changes in El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) may play important roles in determining the supra-annual occurrence of mass flowerings. Flowering surveys on the Malay Peninsula implied that regions with spring or autumn mass flowerings corresponded geographically to those regions that had one cool season (December–February) or two (December–February and June–August), respectively. This finding anticipates the seasonal pattern and geographical distribution of mass flowerings on the Malay Peninsula...|$|E
40|$|The tomato is {{an annual}} that {{requires}} about 100 - 150 days {{to complete a}} seed to seed life cycle. Seed germination Seed of most varieties germinate at an optimum temperature range of 26 - 32 °. Under optimal conditions seedlings break through the soil surface about four days after sowing. Seed sowing depth should be about 1 - 2 cm. Shoot Development After emergence, the cotyledons expand rapidly and the first true leaves develop at the growing point. Leaves grow alternately (2 / 5 phyllotaxy). Most varieties develop 7 - 11 leaves below the first inflorescence. After the first cluster, indeterminate varieties typically develop three leaves between flower clusters and six or more flower cluster on a single branch. Determinate types usually show two leaves between flower clusters and up to 5 clusters per branch. Side shoots arise from each leaf axil that lead to new branches, leaves, and flower clusters. Flowering Tomato is a day neutral plant, meaning that day length {{does not affect the}} number of days to flowering. The first flower of the first cluster starts to open about 55 - 60 days after sowing. The second cluster flowers about one week after the first and so on for determinate varieties; duration from first flowering to completion of flowering is about 45 - 60 days for determinates. Time length between <b>flowering</b> of <b>sequential</b> <b>flower</b> clusters for indeterminates is 10 - 14 days. Fruit Development Fruit require 40 - 60 days from flowering to full ripening.

40|$|Abstract. At {{irregular}} {{intervals of}} 2 to 10 years the aseasonal tropical rain forests in west Malesia come into heavy mass flowering, followed by mast fruiting. During a heavy flowering {{almost half the}} mature individuals and over 80 % of the canopy and emergent tree Species in a forest may flower. This involves over 200 tree species in a forest flowering over {{a short period of}} 3 – 4 months. The pollination needs during a mass flowering appears to be overcome in several ways. A rapid {{increase in the number of}} pollinators seems to occur in the forest. This is partly caused by the migration of pollinators from the fringes of the forest to forage on the superabundance of flowers. At the same time, some groups of plants which share common pollinators appear to reduce pollinator competition by flowering in interspecific sequence. Many members of the family Dipterocarpaceae have evolved <b>sequential</b> <b>flowering</b> too. They also share unique pollinators, common flower thrips which appear to build up rapidly in numbers by feeding and breeding on the millions of dipterocarp flower buds which are present several weeks before the flowering. The environmental cue for this irregular, but widespread mass flowering can be traced to a small dip of about 2 ° C below mean night-time temperature for 4 or 5 nights. The conditions for such temperature drops occur during El Nino events...|$|E

5000|$|One {{possibility}} is that Banksia flowers are simply not exposed to their own pollen. This is highly unlikely for two reasons. Firstly, the morphology of the Banksia flower makes it virtually inevitable that the stigma will be exposed to its own pollen, since it functions also as a [...] "pollen-presenter". It {{has been suggested that}} this problem would be avoided if the flowers were strongly protandrous, but the evidence so far supports only partial protandry. Moreover, the question of protandry of individual flowers is probably irrelevant, because the <b>sequential</b> anthesis of <b>flowers</b> means that each inflorescence will typically contain flowers in both male and female stages at the same time. Observations of foraging patterns in pollinators have shown that transfer of pollen between different flowers in the same inflorescence is inevitable.|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{pollination}} ecology and related floral traits {{of the species}} Daucus carota subsp. commutatus in the isolated archipelago of Columbretes, E. Spain, where bees are absent. Two populations were studied: a small population found on a relatively large island (Grossa) inhabited nowadays by three people; and a larger population on a smaller non-inhabited island (Foradada). The plant, found also in other rocky coastal enclaves of the west Mediterranean, is totally self-compatible, andromonoecious, exhibiting strong protandrous dichogamy and <b>sequential</b> <b>flowering</b> of umbel orders, with limited probability of self pollination at the plant level. Pollination on both study islands is carried out solely by flies, mainly by Eristalis tenax (Syrphidae), a long distance visitor and efficient pollinator, but irregular migrant to the archipelago; and Lucilia sericata (Calliphoridae), an abundant flower visitor but less efficient pollinator dependent on human and avian wastes for its larval growth. The small population on Grossa appears not to suffer pollen limitation. Seed set is reduced, however, in the large population on Foradada, which we attribute to the low pollinator capital of this island which {{is too small to}} attract and sustain migrant hoverflies and where no human and avian wastes are available to sustain blowfly growth. We conclude that in isolated environments with reduced or unpredictable pollinator capital, long distance migrant pollinators, such as E. tenax, play an invaluable conservation and perhaps evolutionary role for the native plants. Because these islands have been always practically uninhabited we argue that the absence of adequate local pollinator capital is perhaps compensated by the selection of particular floral traits, which differentiate the study subspecies from other conspecifics. Such traits are: the exposure of nectar during male vs. female stage to enhance quick pollen flow; the extended stigma receptivity period (up to 10 days) resulting in a total flower life span of up to 22 days, enabling an adequate pollen deposition on stigmas even under low pollen transfer rates. In this respect, the low flower sex ratio (hermaphrodite : staminate) compared to other conspecifics studied elsewhere may be also relevant. The project has been financially supported by the investigation projects GV-C-RN- 12 - 069 - 96 and BSO 2000 - 0148.

40|$|Seed {{production}} of two cultivars (Powderpuff and Kurenai) of China aster (Callistephus chinensis (L.) Nees.), grown under field conditions, was assessed to determine plant {{responses to the}} effects of plant density, crop manipulation by hand pinching and the application of three plant growth regulating chemicals, and some selected herbicides. Plant density effects on vegetative plant growth, flowering pattern, seed development, seed yield and yield components were investigated in 1987 / 1988 using a radial spacing design which provided plant densities ranging from 4. 2 to 44. 7 plants m- 2. Increasing plant densities increased branch numbers m- 2 which led to increased leaf numbers, leaf area, plant dry matter and flowers and resulted in an increased number of potential seed production sites. The number of flower heads m- 2 was the most important component determining final seed yield in both cultivars and was identified as an important plant characteristic to be manipulated for improving seed yield. A period of 18 days was required to complete flowering within each individual flower head, since florets opened sequentially from the outside ring through to the centre. The flowering period lasted for 8 weeks. Each seedhead needed 30 or 39 days from first opening for seed to reach physiological maturity and seeds could remain on the seedhead for a further 9 or 12 days (cv. Kurenai and cv. Powderpuff respectively) before seed shedding started. Kurenai produced maximum seed yield at 27. 8 plants m- 2 (140 g m- 2) and cv. Powderpuff at 17. 4 plants m- 2 (42 g m- 2) but these yields did not differ significantly from those over a wide range of densities (between 12. 7 to 44. 7 plants m- 2 in cv. Kurenai and 4. 9 to 44. 7 plants m- 2 in cv. Powderpuff). Both cultivars exhibited a high ability for compensatory reproductive growth. Lodging and weeds were identified as constraints for seed production at this site and were studied in subsequent years. A series of experiments were conducted in 1987 / 1988 and 1988 / 1989 to evaluate herbicides which would provide good weed control without seed yield reduction, and which would not be phytotoxic to aster plants grown either as transplanted seedlings or when direct sown. For transplanted aster, a single application of oryzalin (3. 75 kg a. i. ha- 1 at 4 days after transplanting) provided excellent weed control and a tenfold increase in seed yield (to 568 kg ha- 1). For direct sown aster, only trifluralin (2 kg a. i. ha- 1) applied pre-sowing did not significantly reduce aster emergence, while oryzalin (4. 5 kg a. i. ha- 1 applied 10 days after sowing) provided the best aster seedling survival. However weed control from both chemicals was only partial and further work is required. In 1988 / 1989, hand pinching and the application of two different rates of three growth retardants, paclobutrazol (0. 5 and 1. 0 kg a. i. ha- 1), daminozide (2. 5 and 5. 0 kg a. i. ha- 1) and chlormequat chloride (1. 5 and 3. 0 kg a. i. ha- 1) were carried out at two different growth stages (visible terminal bud and stem elongation stages) on cv. Powderpuff to investigate their retardation ability, any alterations in the partitioning of assimilate, and subsequent effects on seed yield and yield components. Powderpuff plant structure was altered by hand pinching only at the visible terminal bud stage. Neither pinching treatment increased seed yield, because, particularly for the earlier pinching time, fewer branches were produced from limited node numbers. The growth retarding effect of the three chemicals was transient and the differences in efficacy and the effective duration of each growth retardant treatment was recorded. The longevity of chlormequat activity in treated plants was short compared to paclobutrazol. Although paclobutrazol and daminozide decreased plant height at seed harvest, lodging was not prevented. None of the three chemicals increased flower head numbers or shortened the duration of flowering, and subsequently failed to increase seed yield. However, paclobutrazol showed enough promise for plant height reduction and seed yield improvement to warrant further investigation. Two experiments with paclobutrazol were conducted in 1989 / 1990. The first was on cv. Powderpuff, where two rates of paclobutrazol (0. 5 and 1. 0 kg a. i. ha- 1) were applied at three growth stages (vegetative, terminal flower bud initiation and first visible terminal flower bud stages) to assess their effects on seed yield. The second was an investigation of cultivar/density responses, where the same two paclobutrazol rates were applied to two aster cultivars grown at two different plant densitites (16 and 36 plants m- 2 for cv. Powderpuff and 25 and 49 plants m- 2 for cv. Kurenai) at the terminal flower bud initiation stage. Paclobutrazol effects on China aster plant height were cultivar dependent. Both paclobutrazol rates effectively controlled plant height of cv. Kurenai but the results in cv. Powderpuff were inconsistent and the plant height reduction was insufficient to prevent lodging. Results from all the experiments showed that flowering was strongly influenced by environment (daylength and temperature), and since no growth retardant treatments shortened the duration of flowering, a high variation in seed maturity caused by <b>sequential</b> <b>flowering</b> and subsequent high losses of immature seeds during cleaning resulted in no significant seed yield increases. However, paclobutrazol significantly increased potential harvestable seed yield through increasing the number of seeds per plant when applied (i) at the vegetative stage at 1. 0 kg a. i. ha- 1 to cv. Powderpuff grown at 16 plants m- 2 (56 % seed yield increase from 83. 8 to 130 g m- 2). (ii) at the terminal flower bud initiation stage at 0. 5 kg a. i. ha- 1 to late sown plants of cv. Powderpuff grown at 36 plants m- 2 (48 % increase from 136 to 202 g m- 2). and (iii) during flower bud initiation and early stem elongation at 0. 5 and 1. 0 kg a. i. ha- 1 in cv. Kurenai grown at 49 plants m- 2 (32 and 42 % increase from 178 to 236 and 253 g m- 2 for the low and high rate respectively).

This study evaluates the impact of the nurse plant Juniperus sabina on different stages of the life cycle of the forb Helleborus foetidus. Growth, number of leaves, flowers, carpels and seeds per flower were compared for 240 individuals collected under nurse canopies and in open areas at two sites with contrasting stress levels.

Although nurse plants caused a decrease in flower production at the low-stress site, their net impact there was neutral.

The naturally lower rates of secondary growth and flower production at the high-stress site were compensated by the net positive impact of nurse plants here.

40|$|Trabalho completo: acesso restrito, p. 243 – 249 The floral {{biology of}} the sand dune shrub Eriope blanchetii (Benth) Harley was {{investigated}} in a wild population located within an environment protection area near Salvador, NE Brazil. Inflorescence and flower development were monitored, and the reproductive biology was assessed. Inflorescences are terminal panicles, each bearing from one to 38 small, zygomorphic flowers. The duration of an inflorescence is about 2 months, with few new flowers each day. The rewards to visitors are pollen and nectar, the latter being produced in small quantities at the corolla base, near the stylopodium. Three <b>sequential</b> phases of <b>flower</b> development were identified, based on colour changes, pollen and nectar availability, and stigmatic receptivity. Anthesis takes place throughout the day within each plant, and flowers are strongly protandrous. Flowers are short-lived, with individual variations of 7 – 30 h until corolla abscission. This variation is probably associated to a post-pollinating response, which reduces {{the length of the}} female phase and could be advantageous for the economy of nectar production and for increased efficient pollination of the remaining flowers on a plant. The results of the pollination tests (apomixis, spontaneous and manual autogamy, manual cross-pollination, and control) reinforced the role of pollinators for the reproductive success of E. blanchetii, given that the production of fruits from spontaneous pollination is unlikely to be resulting from protandry and given the morphological floral features. Taken together, the morphological and physiological aspects of E. blanchetii floral biology favour cross-pollination, and it is likely that most of the fruits in nature are produced by outcrossin...|$|R

Patterns of flowering within Oxalis were investigated at both a regional scale (focusing on timing of flowering of Oxalis species in the Cape Region) and a local scale in a single habitat, the J. S. Marais Park, Stellenbosch, over 3 years (1999, 2003 and 2004). We found the active growth period of Oxalis {{to coincide with the}} peak rainfall period in the Cape Region, the start of flowering dependent on both the onset of the first significant rains and a drop in average daily temperatures. Both at a regional and local scale endospermous (dormant seed) species displayed an extended flowering season, while exendospermous (non-dormant seed) species displayed flowering peaks early in the rainy season. This correlates well with seedling strategies, in that dormant seeds of endospermous species are less affected by the dry summer months, while seeds of exendospermous species lack dormancy, and must thus germinate and establish seedlings well-before the onset of the dry summer months. Oxalis species in the local study displayed <b>sequential</b> replacement of <b>flowering</b> onset over the growing season, although there was an overlap in peak flowering times. The flowering sensitivity to alterations in temperature and delayed onset of winter rains suggests that specifically exendospermous species of Oxalis may indicate changes in climate.

40|$|Lunar science {{missions}} such as LADEE and GRAIL achieved unprecedented {{measurements of}} the Lunar exosphere and gravity field. These missions were performed with one (LADEE) or two (GRAIL) traditional satellites. The global coverage achieved by these missions could have been greatly enhanced {{with the use of}} a constellation of satellites. A constellation of communication satellites at the Moon would also be necessary if a Lunar human base were to be established. Constellations with many satellites are expensive with traditional technology, but have become feasible through the technological advancements and affordability of cubesats. Cubesat constellations allow for full surface coverage in science or communication missions at a reasonable mission cost. Repeat ground track orbits offer interesting options for science or communication constellations, since they provide repeat coverage of the surface at a fixed time between <b>sequential</b> visits. <b>Flower</b> constellations are a family of constellations being studied primarily by Daniele Mortari at Texas A 2 ̆ 6 M University that make use of repeat ground tracks. Orbital parameters are selected such that the nodal period of the orbit matches the nodal period of the primary body by a factor dependent on the number of days and the number of revolutions to repeat the ground track. All orbits in a flower constellation have identical orbital elements, with the exception of the right ascension of the ascending node (RAAN) and the initial mean anomaly, which are determined based on the desired phasing scheme desired. Flower constellations have thus far primarily been studied at Earth. A flower constellation at the Moon could be quite useful for science or communication purposes. In this scenario, the flower constellation satellites would be small satellites, which introduces many unique challenges. The cubesats would have limited propulsion capability and would need to be deployed from a mothercraft. Orbital maintenance would then be required after deployment to retain the repeat ground track nature of flower constellations. The limited fuel on the cubesats and the maneuvers required determine the lifetime of the constellation. The communications range of the cubesats will also be limited; following a successful deployment, the mothercraft must move into a long-term communications orbit where it can see both the children craft and Earth, to act as a communications relay. This work investigates the differences in flower constellations at the Moon versus at Earth. It is found that due to the longer rotation period of the Moon, the number of petals in the flower constellation must be quite large in order to produce reasonable orbit sizes. Two types of flower constellations are investigated: a single-petal and multi-petal constellation. The single-petal constellation consists of a string-of-pearls formation within one inertial flower constellation orbit. The multi-petal configuration has one satellite per inertial orbit, with the orbits spaced symmetrically within a 360 ° RAAN distribution. Optimal methods for deployment are explored for both configurations. Phasing orbits are used to deploy the single-petal constellation. This is found to be a simple and low-cost deployment scheme. The multi-petal configuration requires larger plane change maneuvers, and three-burn transfer orbit solutions that are optimal over single impulsive burn maneuvers are found. The mothercraft maneuver into the long-term communications orbit is also investigated. This maneuver is once again just a phase orbit maneuver for the single-petal constellation and is low cost. A polar mothercraft orbit is desired for the multi-petal configuration, again requiring a large and expensive plane change maneuver. As was the case with the deployment maneuver, a three-burn transfer orbit series is found to be cost optimal over a series of impulsive burns for this maneuver. Finally, once the constellation is established, orbit maintenance maneuvers are calculated. A 4 kg cubesat with 1 kg of fuel is assumed, and various thruster types are used to correlate required maintenance ΔVs to propellant mass required. It is found that the flower constellations at the Moon can be maintained for between 100 and 800 days, depending on the efficiency of the thruster system used. Ultimately, a small satellite constellation at the Moon is found to be feasible to establish and maintain for a science or communication mission...|$|R
