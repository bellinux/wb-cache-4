The majority of new entrants to the adult film industry enjoyed their work with Fucking Machines because they discovered it was more socially acceptable to perform with a sexual device, rather than a human partner. Public relations manager for Kink.com Thomas Roche observed in a 2009 interview that Fucking Machines {{did not have a}} focus on BDSM material. In September 2010 the site had a live filming with an audience of 40 spectators, followed by the introduction in November 2010 of an interactive format in which viewers could watch shoots and recommend devices for the participants. By 2012 the site had 500 hours of archival footage with adult film performers, including Alexis Texas, Flower Tucci, and Sasha Grey.|$|E

5|$|Divine {{considered}} {{himself to be}} male, and was not transgender or transsexual. He was gay, and during the 1980s had an extended relationship with a married man named Lee, who accompanied him almost everywhere that he went. They later separated, and Divine went on to have a brief affair with gay porn star Leo Ford, which was widely reported upon by the gay press. According to his manager Bernard Jay, Divine regularly engaged in <b>sexual</b> <b>activities</b> with young men that he would meet while on tour, sometimes becoming infatuated with them; in one case, he met {{a young man in}} Israel whom he wanted to bring back to the United States, but was prevented from doing so by Jay. This image of promiscuity was disputed by his friend Anne Cersosimo, who claimed that Divine never exhibited such behavior when on tour. Divine initially avoided informing the media about his sexuality, even when questioned by interviewers, and would sometimes hint that he was bisexual, but {{in the latter part of}} the 1980s changed this attitude and began being open about his homosexuality. Nonetheless, he avoided discussing gay rights, partially at the advice of his manager, realizing that it would have had a negative effect on his career.|$|E

25|$|Heterosexuality is {{the romantic}} or sexual {{attraction}} to the opposite sex. Heterosexual sexual practices are subject to laws in many places. In some countries, mostly those where religion has a strong influence on social policy, marriage laws serve the purpose of encouraging people to have sex only within marriage. Sodomy laws were seen as discouraging same-sex sexual practices, but may affect opposite-sex sexual practices. Laws also ban adults from committing sexual abuse, committing sexual acts with anyone under an age of consent, performing <b>sexual</b> <b>activities</b> in public, and engaging in <b>sexual</b> <b>activities</b> for money (prostitution). Though these laws cover both same-sex and opposite-sex <b>sexual</b> <b>activities,</b> they may differ in regard to punishment, and may be more frequently (or exclusively) enforced on those who engage in same-sex <b>sexual</b> <b>activities.</b>|$|E

Observed non-procreative <b>sexual</b> <b>activities</b> include non-copulatory mounting (without penetration, or by the female), oral sex, genital stimulation, anal stimulation, interspecies mating, and acts of affection.

A cross-sectional survey research design was used with both closed- and open-ended questions. A total of 51 educators participated. An average of 3. 5 hr was spent teaching <b>sexual</b> <b>activity.</b> Many of the participants were comfortable teaching <b>sexual</b> <b>activity.</b> However, some reported that <b>sexual</b> <b>activity</b> was often an overlooked topic in occupational therapy curriculum and was not emphasized as much as other activities of daily living. In addition, participants reported that the under emphasis of teaching sexuality may be due to a lack of educational background, the broadness of the topic, discomfort of the students, and a lack of information in textbooks. Most of the participants are comfortable teaching <b>sexual</b> <b>activity</b> and believe that it is an important topic in occupational therapy curriculum. However, many consider it an overlooked topic specifically with chronic conditions and sexually transmitted infections. Therefore, educating instructors on <b>sexual</b> <b>activity</b> and pedagogical methods will enhance occupational therapy curriculum. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{estimate}} whether <b>sexual</b> <b>activity</b> is associated with wages, and also to estimate potential interactions between individuals' characteristics, wages and <b>sexual</b> <b>activity.</b> The central hypothesis behind this research is that <b>sexual</b> <b>activity,</b> like health indicators and mental well-being, may be thought of as part of an individual's set of productive traits that affect wages. Using two stage estimations we examine the relationship between adult <b>sexual</b> <b>activity</b> and wages. We estimate that there is a monotonic relationship between the frequency of <b>sexual</b> <b>activity</b> and wage returns, whilst the returns to <b>sexual</b> <b>activity</b> are higher for those between 26 and 50 years of age. In addition, heterosexuals' <b>sexual</b> <b>activity</b> does not seem to provide higher or lower wage returns than that of homosexuals, but wages are higher for those health-impaired employees who are sexually active. Over-identification tests, robustness checks, falsification tests, as well as, decomposition analysis and sample selection modelling enhance the study's strength. Contemporary social analysis suggests that health, cognitive and non-cognitive skills and personality are important factors that affect the wage level. <b>Sexual</b> <b>activity</b> may also be of interest to social scientists, since <b>sexual</b> <b>activity</b> is considered to be a barometer for health, quality of life, well-being and happiness.
