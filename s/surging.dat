30|$|According to the {{eruption}} {{environment and the}} sediment composition, pyroclastic <b>surge</b> includes ash–cloud <b>surge,</b> ground <b>surge</b> and base <b>surge</b> (Fisher et al. 1983; Liu et al. 2008). Among these <b>surges,</b> ash−cloud <b>surge</b> and ground <b>surge</b> (also known as dry <b>surge)</b> developed in the subaerial environment and are accompanied by the pumice flow of magmatic eruption. Ash−cloud <b>surge</b> mainly generates fine volcanic ash, while the ground <b>surge</b> mainly produces coarse and rigid fragments. The term of base <b>surge,</b> also called wet <b>surge,</b> {{is derived from the}} description of the underwater thermonuclear experiment of Bikini Atolld, South Pacific in 1947 (Liu et al. 2008). It is a kind of rapidly expanding and low-density gas-solid density flow that represents the water-related volcanism, the phreatomagmatic eruption (Xu et al. 2005), which is formed by the explosion of upward magma interacting with surface water or groundwater.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this master's thesis is to describe the existing <b>surge</b> tank solutions and additional improvements, and to simulate the hydraulic behavior of the <b>surge</b> tanks and how it affects the hydropower plant. The high head hydropower plant Torpa and the low head hydropower plant Åna-Sira are used for the case study, thus the <b>surge</b> tanks can be simulated under different hydraulic conditions. Turbine pressures and mass oscillations after a complete turbine shutdown, and turbine regulation parameters from operating the hydropower plant, are simulated in the LVTrans software. The result is a <b>Surge</b> Tank Atlas, where the <b>surge</b> tank solutions are described with conceptual drawings, advantages and disadvantages, and documentation from the simulations. This <b>Surge</b> Tank Atlas provides a useful tool to compare different <b>surge</b> tank solutions for both a high head and low head hydropower plant. Some of the conclusions are valid for both hydropower plants and all the <b>surge</b> tank solutions. Increasing the distance from <b>surge</b> tank to turbine, decreasing the <b>surge</b> tank volume or a strong throttling of the <b>surge</b> tank will increase the water hammer significantly, {{and to some extent}} reduce the mass oscillations. An optimal throttling of the <b>surge</b> tank will stabilize the running of the hydropower plant, reduce the <b>surge</b> tank mass oscillations and hence the necessary height and volume of the <b>surge</b> tank. Other conclusions vary between the open and the closed <b>surge</b> tank, and the high and low head hydropower plant. The closed <b>surge</b> tank shows a better dampening of the water hammer than the open <b>surge</b> tank for both hydropower plant, the closed <b>surge</b> tank can be throttled stronger than the open <b>surge</b> tanks, and the <b>surge</b> tanks at the low head hydropower plant requires more volume than for the high head plant, even though the hydraulic head is a tenth of the high head hydropower plant. Hence there are some significant differences in the hydraulic behavior between the <b>surge</b> tank solutions and the high head and the low head hydropower plant, that will be presented and discussed in the <b>Surge</b> Tank Atlas...|$|R
40|$|A {{positive}} <b>surge</b> {{results from}} a sudden change in flow that increases the flow depth. New experiments were conducted in a large channel. Most positive <b>surge</b> tests were conducted with a horizontal bed slope, a constant flow rate and uncontrolled flow conditions. The only dependant variable was the downstream gate opening after closure. Detailed turbulence measurements were performed with high-temporal resolution using side-looking acoustic Doppler velocimetry. Two types of positive <b>surge</b> were observed: undular <b>surge</b> for Froude numbers less than 1. 7, and weak (breaking) <b>surges</b> above. Instantaneous velocity measurements beneath advancing <b>surges</b> showed a marked effect of the <b>surge</b> passage on the velocity field. Streamwise velocities showed rapid flow deceleration at all vertical elevations. Large fluctuations of longitudinal and transverse velocities were recorded beneath the <b>surges,</b> including some unsteady flow recirculation beneath a weak <b>surge</b> front. Turbulent stresses were deduced from high-pass filtered data. The results showed large normal and tangential Reynolds stresses beneath the <b>surges.</b> A comparison between undular and weak <b>surges</b> suggested some major difference. In weak <b>surge</b> flows, the data showed rapid flow separation beneath the <b>surge</b> front.

40|$|Since {{the devastating}} {{hurricane}} seasons of 2004, 2005, and 2008, {{the stability and}} serviceability of coastal bridges during and following hurricane events have become a main public concern. Twenty coastal bridges, critical for hurricane evacuation and recovery efforts, in Texas {{have been identified as}} vulnerable to hurricane <b>surge</b> and wave action. To accurately assess extreme <b>surges</b> at these bridges, a dimensionless <b>surge</b> response function methodology was adopted. The <b>surge</b> response function defines maximum <b>surge</b> in terms of hurricane meteorological parameters such as hurricane size, intensity, and landfall location. The advantage of this approach is that, given a limited set of discrete hurricane <b>surge</b> data (either observed or simulated), all possible hurricane <b>surges</b> within the meteorological parameter space may be described. In this thesis, we will first present development of the <b>surge</b> response function methodology optimized to include the influence of regional continental shelf geometry. We will then demonstrate <b>surge</b> response function skill for <b>surge</b> prediction by comparing results with <b>surge</b> observations for Hurricanes Carla (1961) and Ike (2008) at several stations along the coast. Finally, we apply the improved <b>surge</b> response function methodology to quantify extreme <b>surges</b> for Texas coastal bridge probability and vulnerability assessment...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. A 1995 <b>surge</b> of Variegated Glacier, Alaska, USA, is {{discussed}} {{in the context of}} its six 20 thcenturypredecessors, especially the previous <b>surge</b> in 1982 / 83 which was studied in detail. The averagetime between <b>surge</b> initiations is 15 years. The 1995 <b>surge</b> was considerably weaker than itspredecessors, having a single phase or at most a very weak second phase. The 1995 <b>surge</b> confirmsthat there is a seasonal cycle, with <b>surge</b> initiation in winter and termination {{in the first part of}} the meltseason, and a correlation between weather and both <b>surge</b> termination date and <b>surge</b> extent.

50|$|Glacier <b>surges</b> {{have been}} {{divided into two}} {{categories}} depending {{on the character of}} the <b>surge</b> event.

5|$|In plant cells, vacuoles cover {{anywhere}} from 30% to 90% {{of the total}} cell volume. Most mature plant cells contain one large central vacuole encompassed by a membrane called the tonoplast. Vacuoles of plant cells act as storage compartments for the nutrients and waste of a cell. The solution that these molecules are stored in is called the cell sap. Pigments that color the cell are sometime located in the cell sap. Vacuoles can also {{increase the size of}} the cell, which elongates as water is added, and they control the turgor pressure (the osmotic pressure that keeps the cell wall from caving in). Like lysosomes of animal cells, vacuoles have an acidic pH and contain hydrolytic enzymes. The pH of vacuoles enables them to perform homeostatic procedures in the cell. For example, when the pH in the cells environment drops, the H+ ions <b>surging</b> into the cytosol can be transferred to a vacuole {{in order to keep the}} cytosol's pH constant.|$|E
5|$|The Severn bore is a {{tidal bore}} {{seen on the}} tidal reaches of the River Severn in south western England. It is formed when the rising tide moves into the funnel-shaped Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary and the <b>surging</b> water forces its way {{upstream}} {{in a series of}} waves, as far as Gloucester and beyond. The bore behaves differently in different stretches of the river; in the lower, wider parts it is more noticeable in the deep channels as a slight roller, while the water creeps across the sand and mudflats. In the narrower, upper reaches, the river occupies the whole area between its banks and the bore advances in a series of waves that move upstream. Near Gloucester, the advancing water overcomes two weirs, and sometimes one in Tewkesbury, before finally petering out.|$|E

50|$|Hydraulic <b>surges</b> {{are created}} when the {{velocity}} of a fluid suddenly changes and becomes unsteady or transient.
