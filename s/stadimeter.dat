25|$|A <b>stadimeter,</b> a type {{of optical}} rangefinder, is an optical device for {{estimating}} the range to an object of known height by measuring the angle between {{the top and bottom}} of the object as observed at the device. It is similar to a sextant, in that the device is using mirrors to measure an angle between two objects but differs in that one dials in the height of the object. The <b>stadimeter</b> was invented in 1894 by Bradley Allen Fiske, a Rear-Admiral in the United States Navy. The first sea tests, conducted in 1895, showed that it was equally useful for fleet sailing and for navigation. Likewise, the <b>stadimeter</b> proved useful during the Battle of Manila Bay during the Spanish–American War. U.S. patent #523,721 was issued to Fiske on July 31, 1894.|$|E

50|$|Among Fiske's {{improvements}} were {{an improved}} <b>stadimeter,</b> helm-angle indicator, engine-room telegraphs, speed and direction indicators, a turret range finder, a gun director system, and steering telegraphs.|$|E
50|$|The United States Navy Bureau of Ships {{contracted}} {{on several}} occasions for orders of hand held <b>Stadimeters</b> starting shortly after its development in the late 1890s. By the early 1900s it along with the sextant, spyglass, maneuvering board, parallel motion protractor and other navigation tools {{were part of the}} standard gear for the navigation officer aboard US warships.|$|R
500|$|Finding the British Barr & Stroud {{coincidence}} rangefinder design superior to existing French designs, the Dantons mounted {{a pair of}} [...] FQ rangefinders atop the conning tower and a [...] rangefinder on each turret top {{for use by the}} turret commanders. Integrating these into the overall fire-control system took some time so eight Ponthus & Therrode <b>stadimeters,</b> which required knowledge of the target's mast height and overall length, were used in the interim. During the war, the rangefinders were replaced by longer, more precise instrument. A triple [...] model was installed above the conning tower and 2-meter models replaced the smaller ones on the turret roofs.|$|R
500|$|Two Zeiss [...] {{rangefinders}} were fitted on the conning {{towers and}} there was also a [...] Barr & Stroud instrument, possibly for precise stationkeeping on the master ship when concentrating fire. Two Krylov <b>stadimeters</b> were situated in the lower level of the forward conning tower. These would provide data for the central artillery post to calculate with its imported Pollen Argo Mark V Clock, a mechanical fire-control computer, and then transmit the gun commands via the Geisler transmission system for the gun crew to follow. During the winter of 1915–16 the Zeiss rangefinders were transferred to armored hoods on the rear of the fore and aft turrets and, at some point, [...] Barr & Stroud rangefinders were added to the roofs of the middle turrets. [...] received a [...] Pollen rangefinder in the spring of 1916.|$|R

50|$|A <b>stadimeter</b> is {{an optical}} device for {{estimating}} the range to {{an object of}} known height by measuring the angle between {{the top and bottom}} of the object as observed at the device. It is similar to a sextant, in that the device is using mirrors to measure an angle between two objects but differs in that one dials in the height of the object. It is one of several types of optical rangefinders, and does not require a large instrument, and so was ideal for hand-held implementations or installation in a submarine's periscope.

50|$|In 1908, {{the death}} of Ellis and the {{destruction}} of his <b>stadimeter</b> were cited {{in an article in the}} United States Naval Institute Proceedings as to the impracticality of using observers aloft or in an exposed position on deck to determine range to targets during an actual battle, as opposed to gunnery practice. The proposed improvement was to install a range-finder in an armored installation on each gun turret.|$|E
50|$|Prior to {{widespread}} availability of pocket calculators and computers, maneuvering boards were used aboard ships and aircraft to provide rapid solutions to commonly encountered relative motion problems. Availability of RADAR distance information improved solutions obtained with <b>stadimeter</b> estimates. When {{operating in a}} formation of ships, navigation personnel were encouraged to add the relative positions of the other ships in formation to their maneuvering boards to clarify station changing problems when orders were received.|$|E
50|$|The {{hand held}} <b>stadimeter</b> was {{developed}} by Bradley Allen Fiske (1854-1942), {{an officer in the}} United States Navy. It was designed for gunnery purposes, but its first sea tests, conducted in 1895, showed that it was equally useful for fleet sailing and for navigation. It was normally kept on the bridge and used from there and on the bridge wings to keep warships at the proper distance from one another when steaming in formation and for use in convoys.|$|E
5000|$|Chief Yeoman Ellis {{was killed}} 3 July 1898 while {{serving on the}} USS Brooklyn during the Battle of Santiago de Cuba. During the battle, he was {{reporting}} ranges of enemy vessels which he read from the <b>stadimeter,</b> a rangefinding device, while observing from an exposed position, while the Brooklyn was under fire from {{as many as four}} Spanish ships. Yeoman Ellis was considered an expert with the <b>stadimeter.</b> While the Brooklyn was pursuing fleeing Spanish armored cruisers Vizcaya and Cristóbal Colón, Ellis took a position about three feet in front of the forward turret. He was [...] "singing out" [...] the ranges to a messenger, who passed them to the guncrews inside the turrets. He was decapitated when a large shell fired from a Spanish ship struck him in the face. His brain and blood were thrown over a number of people. When an ensign and the ship's doctor started to pick up Ellis's body to throw it over the side, as was a common practice in naval battles, they were stopped by Commodore Schley, who said [...] "No! Do not throw that body overboard! One who has fought so gallantly deserves the honor of a Christian burial." ...|$|E
