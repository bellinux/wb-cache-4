25|$|Ward, a young {{traveling}} salesman of dry goods, {{was concerned}} over {{the plight of}} many rural Midwest Americans who were, he thought, being overcharged and under-served {{by many of the}} small town retailers on whom they had to rely for their general merchandise. He opened his first mail-order house in 1872. By heavy use of the railroads centered on Chicago, and by associating his business with the non-profit Patrons of Husbandry (the Grangers), Ward offered rural customers a far larger stock than generally available in small towns and at a lower price. Unlike local country merchants, Ward offered no bargaining and no credit. His free catalog, printed by the most modern methods, was widely mailed to customers, allowing them to <b>see</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> consumer goods and imagine how they might be used. Later, Ward used the Post Office's Rural Free Delivery service; he lobbied for a parcel post system that came about in 1906. The early 20th century was the heyday of mail orders and Ward's had become an American tradition, along with its rival Sears Roebuck.|$|E
500|$|Following {{a police}} {{investigation}} that lasted over a year, on 21 August 1984 the trial against Heidemann and Kujau opened in Hamburg. Both men {{were charged with}} defrauding Stern of 9.3million DMs. Despite {{the seriousness of the}} charges facing the two men, Hamilton considers that [...] "it also appeared clear that the trial {{was going to be a}} farce, a real slapstick affair that would enrage the judge and amuse the entire world." [...] The proceedings lasted until July 1985, when both men were sent to prison: four years and eight months for Heidemann, four years and six months for Kujau. In September one of the supporting magistrates overseeing the case was replaced after he fell asleep; three days later the court were [...] "amused" [...] to <b>see</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> Idi Amin's underpants, which Heidemann had framed on his wall. At times the case [...] "denigrated into a slanging match" [...] between Kujau and Heidemann. In his summing up Judge Hans-Ulrich Schroeder said that [...] "the negligence of Stern has persuaded me to soften the sentences against the two main co-conspirators." [...] Heidemann was found guilty of stealing 1.7million DMs from Stern; Kujau guilty of receiving 1.5million DMs for his role in the forgeries. Despite the lengthy investigation and trial, at least fivemillion DMs remained unaccounted for.|$|E

In 2005, Timberlake launched the William Rast clothing line with childhood friend Juan ("Trace") Ayala. The 2007 line contained cord jackets, cashmere sweaters, jeans, and polo shirts. The pair reports inspiration from fellow Memphis native Elvis Presley: [...] "Elvis is the perfect mixture of Justin and I," [...] Ayala says. [...] "You {{can go back and}} <b>see</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> him in cowboy boots and a cowboy hat and a nice button-down shirt, but then again you can see him in a tux and a collared shirt with rhinestones on it and slacks. We like to think 'If he was alive today, what would he be wearing?'" [...] Target has announced that a William Rast collection, including denim, outerwear and sportswear for men and women, would launch in December and be available for a month. In 2015, the clothing line earned him a Lord & Taylor's Fashion Oracle Award at the Fashion Group International's Night of The Stars Gala. An avid amateur golfer, in 2007 Timberlake purchased the run-down Big Creek Golf Course in his home town of Millington, Tennessee, which he redeveloped as the eco-friendly Mirimichi Golf Course at a cost of some $US16 million. It was reopened on July 25, 2009 but closed again on January 15, 2010 for further improvements expected to take six months. In October 2011, Timberlake received the Futures Award at the Environmental Media Awards for his green-conscious golf course. It was reported on November 7, 2014, that Timberlake had sold Mirimichi to Three Star Leasing LLC for $500,000. Timberlake and his wife Jessica Biel are minority owners of the Memphis Grizzlies.|$|E
2500|$|Goodrem's {{second album}} Mistaken Identity, was {{released}} in Australia on 8 November 2004 and debuted at {{number one on the}} ARIA Albums chart. It was certified five times platinum for sales of 350,000 copies. The album spent 46 weeks in the top fifty. It also reached number seven in New Zealand, and peaked at number 25 in the UK. The album's lead single [...] "Out of the Blue", which was co-written and produced by Guy Chambers was released prior to the album on 8 October 2004. [...] "Out of the Blue" [...] debuted at number one on the ARIA Singles Chart and number nine in the UK". This was Goodrem's sixth straight number one single in Australia. It was certified platinum in Australia. The second single [...] "Mistaken Identity" [...] was released only in Australia debuted at number seven and was certified Gold. [...] "Almost Here", a duet with Irish singer Brian McFadden was released as the third single and reached number three in the UK and became her seventh ARIA number one, along with her first number one in Ireland. It was certified platinum in Australia. [...] "A Little Too Late" [...] was released only in Australia and peaked at number 13. [...] "Be Strong" [...] was released as the album's fifth and final single in Australia as a digital download on 16 October 2005. At the time of release, digital downloads were not included as part of the main singles chart, therefore it was ineligible to chart. Much of the album, in particular [...] "Extraordinary Day", was inspired by her battle with cancer. Reflecting on that period of her life, Goodrem said [...] "It's weird to <b>see</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> that time. In some ways the fact that I was so sick was so out there, and yet I kept it really private. No-one saw me on the days I was really sick. I was 18 when I was diagnosed and I had a number one album and single in the country. And in the UK, I was number two. It was such a bipolar year.|$|E

Down this staircase fell, from gloom to deeper gloom, a cascade of colour. At this point I stayed, because there was a beautiful archway of Burmese build, and adorned with a Chinese inscription, directly in front of me, and I conceived foolishly that I should find nothing more pleasant to look at if I went farther. Also, I wished to understand how such a people could produce the dacoit of the newspaper, and I knew that a great deal of promiscuous knowledge comes to him who sits down by the wayside. Then I saw a Face--which explained a good deal. The chin, jowl, lips, and neck were modelled faithfully on the lines of the worst of the Roman Empresses--the lolloping, walloping women that Swinburne sings about, and that we sometimes <b>see</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of.</b> Above this gross perfection of form came the Mongoloid nose, narrow forehead, and flaring pig's eyes. I stared intently, and the man stared back again, with admirable insolence, that puckered one corner of his mouth. Then he swaggered forward, and I was richer by a new face and a little knowledge. [...] "I must make further inquiries at the Club," [...] said I, [...] "but that man seems to be of the proper dacoit type. He could crucify on occasion." ...|$|E
