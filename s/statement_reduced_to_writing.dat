40|$|Mañé (1979) {{proved that}} if a compact metric space admits an {{expansive}} homeomorphism then it is finite dimensional. We generalize this theorem to multiparameter actions. The generalization involves mean dimension theory, which counts "averaged dimension" of a dynamical system. We prove that if T:Z^k× X→ X is expansive and if R:Z^k- 1 × X→ X commutes with T then R has finite mean dimension. When k= 1, this <b>statement</b> <b>reduces</b> <b>to</b> Mañé's theorem. We also study several related issues, especially the connection with entropy theory. Comment: 27 page...|$|R

40|$|A formal {{symbolic}} language for behavioral operations is proposed, based on propositional logic. The system describes how an experiment changes an organism's physical environment. With few exceptions, the codification system results in <b>statements</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> the truth-conditions of observable events. The main purpose is clarification of key concepts used in behavior analysis by describing {{the logic of}} behavioral operations. Using the system, we explain, for instance, the difference between positive and negative reinforcement and how differential reinforcement contains an extinction procedure. Use of a well-established formal language may also facilitate co-operation across disciplines as behavior analysis, biology, and economy...|$|R
50|$|The parties {{themselves}} may prescribe formalities {{regarding the}} conclusion, variation or cancellation of their contract, {{as well as}} the waiver of any right arising from their contract. Where the parties agree that their agreement must be in writing, they may have one of two possible intentions. (The first is presumed if no clear intention is evident.) Either their agreement is <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>writing</b> merely <b>to</b> facilitate proof of its terms, in which case the contract is binding immediately, or their agreement acquires legal effect only once it has been <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>writing</b> and signed by the parties.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} {{conditions for}} simultaneous normalizability {{of a family}} of reduced schemes, i. e., the normalization of the total space normalizes, fiber by fiber, each member of the family. The main result (under more general conditions) is that a flat family of reduced equidimensional projective C-varieties (Xy) y∈Y with normal parameter space Y —algebraic or analytic—admits a simultaneous normalization if and only if the Hilbert polynomial of the integral closure OXy is locally independent of y. When the Xy are curves projectivity is not needed, and the <b>statement</b> <b>reduces</b> <b>to</b> the well known δ-constant criterion of Teissier. Proofs are basically algebraic, analytic algebraic ones...|$|R
