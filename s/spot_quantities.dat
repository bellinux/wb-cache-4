40|$|Summary: In {{order to}} {{identify}} disease-associated alterations in the myocardial protein patterns in dilated cardio-myopathy, we used 2 -dimensional gel electrophoresis to analyse the proteins of endomyocardial biopsies from patients and controls. Proteins (15 (^g) from biopsies (1 — 3 mg wet weight) were first separated by isoelectric focusing, then applied to large 2 -dimensional gels. A computer-assisted System (PDQUEST®) was used for spot detection, quantification and comparison of 2 -dimensional protein patterns. From a single endomyocardial biopsy about 1000 different protein species were resolved. The spot pattern {{was influenced by the}} concentration of protein during sample preparation, by the amount of protein loaded onto the gels and by the development time of silver staining. Variances of spot position in the first and second dimension and in the long diagonale were less than 5 %. Coefficients of variance for the <b>spot</b> <b>quantities</b> in 8 gels were 16 ± 8 %. Contaminating blood proteins could be identified in the biopsy patteras. Computer-assisted comparison between cardiomyopathy (n = 5) and controls (n = 5) over the whole gel revealed that 55 protein Spots were increased 100 %, 27 protein spots decreased 100 %. Four proteins showed significant quantitative differences between the cardiomyopathic hearts and controls. Fourteen proteins were identified by amino acid analysis or microsequencing. An isoelectric point and molecular mass grid was laid over the whole gel based on these identified protein species, resulting in approximate isoelectric point values and molecular masses for all other protein species...|$|E

After quantitative detection, the intensities of each spot were normalized by total valid spot intensity.

Expression differences per protein spot between the spl 5 mutant and WT from 3 independent experiments were estimated by t-test (p < 0.05). Protein spots were selected based on the significant differences of <b>spots</b> <b>quantities</b> between the spl 5 mutant and WT.|$|R

We relax Xia and Sexton's assumption of no supply response by captive feeders, which reduces the price-depressing effect of captive supplies. Finally, the agent-based model is used to simulate packers choosing both captive supply <b>quantities</b> and <b>spot</b> market <b>quantities.</b> Packers in the relaxed agent-based model choose no captive supplies and thus reach the Cournot solution.

40|$|Poison hemlock (conium maculatum L.) is a weedy species {{occurring}} in plant communities near field borders and in agrophytocoenosis. It invades into these crops: winter wheat, pea, sugar beet, white mustard {{and also in}} fodder plants. The origin of the invasion lies predominantly in plant communities around field borders. The aim of this thesis was to elaborate survey of poison hemlock occurrence on arable lands and also within plant communities around field margin in the Middle Bohemia. The study was carried on {{with the use of}} GPS navigation (Garmin Etrex 30, Garmin Ltd., USA). Each spot of occurrence was determined by visual recognition in slowly moving car (30 - 40 km/h). Transit between two urban areas was done in both directions every time. Minimal distance between each spot is between 8 - 10 m in this type of determination. Data records were transferred to ortofoto map data layer. The density of plants in each spot was evaluated consequently. The presence of this species in the crops was also evaluated during the survey. 25 field segments of winter canola, two segments of pea, one segment of white mustard and four segments of sugar beet were recorded the studied region. The intensity of the weed infestation around the road network strongly varied. Both solitary plants and consistent stands of poison hemlock were described. The method of evaluation of <b>spot</b> <b>quantity</b> on the longitudinal track was verified in this study.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} our paper is to analyze optimal {{purchasing}} strategies when a manufacturer can buy raw materials from a long-term contract supplier and a spot market under spot price uncertainty. Design/methodology/approach: This procurement model can be solved by using dynamic programming. First, we maximize the DM’s utility of the second period, obtaining the optimal contract <b>quantity</b> and <b>spot</b> <b>quantity</b> for the second period. Then, maximize the DM’s utility of both periods, obtaining the optimal purchasing strategy for the first period. We use a numerical method to compare the performance level of a pure spot sourcing strategy {{with that of a}} mixed strategy. Findings: Our results show that optimal purchasing strategies vary with the trend of contract prices. If the contract price falls, the total quantity purchased in period 1 will decrease in the degree of risk aversion. If the contract price increases, the total quantity purchased in period 1 will increase in the degree of risk aversion. The relationship between the optimal contract quantity and the degree of risk aversion depends on whether the expected spot price or the contract price is larger in period 2. Finally, we compare the performance levels between a combined strategy and a spot sourcing strategy. It shows that a combined strategy is optimal for a risk-averse buyer. Originality/value: It’s challenging to deal with a two-period procurement problem with risk consideration. We have obtained results of a two-period procurement problem with two sourcing options, namely contract procurement and spot purchases. Our model incorporates the buyer’s risk aversion factor and the change of contract prices, which are not addressed in early studies. </p...|$|R
40|$|Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a severe, {{systemic}} illness {{characterized by}} persistent, debilitating and medically unexplained fatigue. The etiology and pathophysiology of CFS remains obscure, and diagnosis is formulated through the patient's history and exclusion of other medical causes. Thereby, {{the availability of}} biomarkers for CFS could be useful for clinical research. In the present study, we used a proteomic approach to evaluate the global changes in the salivary profile {{in a couple of}} monozygotic twins who were discordant for CFS. The aim was to evaluate differences of salivary protein expression in the CFS patient in respect to his healthy twin. Saliva samples were submitted to two-dimensional electrophoresis (2 DE). The gels were stained with Sypro, and a comparison between CFS subject and the healthy one was performed by the software Progenesis Same Spot including the Analysis of variance (ANOVA test). The proteins spot found with a >= 2 -fold <b>spot</b> <b>quantity</b> change and p< 0. 05 were identified by Nano-liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. To validate the expression changes found with 2 DE of 5 proteins (14 - 3 - 3 protein zeta/delta, cyclophilin A, Cystatin-C, Protein S 100 -A 7, and zinc-alpha- 2 -glycoprotein), we used the western blot analysis. Moreover, proteins differentially expressed were functionally analyzed using the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software with the aim to determine the predominant canonical pathways and the interaction network involved. The analysis of the protein profiles allowed us to find 13 proteins with a different expression in CFS in respect to control. Nine spots were up-regulated in CFS and 4 down-regulated. These proteins belong to different functional classes, such as inflammatory response, immune system and metabolism. In particular, as shown by the pathway analysis, the network built with our proteins highlights the involvement of inflammatory response in CFS pathogenesis. This study shows the presence of differentially expressed proteins in the saliva of the couple of monozygotic twins discordant for CFS, probably related to the disease. Consequently, we believe the proteomic approach could be useful both to define a panel of potential diagnostic biomarkers and to shed new light on the comprehension of the pathogenetic pathways of CFS...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{planning}} model for chemical commodities {{related to an}} industry case. Commodities are standard chemicals characterized by sales and supply volatility in volume and value. Increasing and volatile prices of crude oil-dependent raw materials require coordination of sales and supply decisions by volume and value throughout the value chain to ensure profitability. Contract and spot demand differentiation with volatile and uncertain spot prices, <b>spot</b> sales <b>quantity</b> flexibility, <b>spot</b> sales price¿ 3 quantity functions and variable raw material consumption rates in production are problem specifics to be considered. Existing chemical industry planning models are limited to production and distribution decisions to minimize costs or makespan. Demand-oriented models focus on uncertainty in demand quantities not in prices. We develop an integrated model to optimize profit by coordinating sales quantity, price and supply decisions throughout the value chain. A two-phase optimization approach supports robust planning ensuring minimum profitability even in case of worst-case spot sales price scenarios. Model evaluations with industry case data demonstrate the impact of elasticities, variable raw material consumption rates and price uncertainties on planned profit and volume...|$|R

Interim excavation reports noted that window glass was found but gave no detailed account of find <b>spot,</b> description or <b>quantity</b> of glass recovered.

50|$|Tharsis is {{commonly}} called a volcano-tectonic province, {{meaning that it}} is the product of volcanism and associated tectonic processes that have caused extensive crustal deformation. According to the standard view, Tharsis overlies a hot spot, similar to the one thought to underlie the island of Hawaii. The hot spot is caused by one or more massive columns of hot, low-density material (a superplume) rising through the mantle. The hot <b>spot</b> produces voluminous <b>quantities</b> of magma in the lower crust that is released to the surface as highly fluid, basaltic lava. Because Mars lacks plate tectonics, the lava is able to build up in one region for billions of years to produce enormous volcanic constructs.On Earth (and presumably Mars as well), not all of the magma produced in a large igneous province erupts at the surface as lava. Much of it stalls in the crust where it slowly cools and solidifies to produce large intrusive complexes (plutons). If the magma migrates through vertical fractures it produces swarms of dikes that may be expressed at the surface as long, linear cracks (fossae) and crater chains (catenae). Magma may also intrude the crust horizontally as large tabular bodies, such as sills and laccoliths, that can cause a general doming and fracturing of the overlying crust. Thus, the bulk of Tharsis is probably made of these intrusive complexes in addition to lava flows at the surface.|$|R
40|$|Two slow-growth local chicken strains, {{derived from}} a common base population, were {{bi-directionally}} selected over twenty generations for carcass traits (B strain) and egg production (L 2 strain). The objective {{of the present study}} was to identify hypothalamic proteins associated with high egg production (by taking advantage of the similar genetic background of these two strains). Prior to and during egg laying, hypothalamic proteins of B and L 2 hens were analyzed with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 -DE) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Approximately 430 well-resolved spots, ranging from 10 to 40 kDa, pH 5 - 9, were quantified by image processing. Eight protein <b>spots</b> differed in <b>quantity</b> between B and L 2 strains at either stage. Using LC-MS/MS, we identified six of eight protein spots, including proteins known for regulating gene expression, signal transduction and lipid metabolism. The mRNA expression levels of these six proteins were then evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR in five strains of hens, including B, L 2 and another three commercial strains; heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H 3 (HNRPH 3) was higher in L 2 than in the B strain (consistent with the findings in 2 -DE). Increased levels of HNRPH 3 mRNA were also present in the hypothalamus of high-egg-yield White Leghorn layers, but were absent in other domestic commercial strains with low egg production rates. In conclusion, the expression level of HNRPH 3 may be a new molecular marker to screen for high egg production in slow-growth local chickens. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Regardless of {{the form}} of restructuring, {{deregulated}} electricity industries share one common feature: {{the absence of any}} significant, rapid demand-side response to the wholesale (or, spot market) price. For a variety of reasons, electricity industries continue to charge most consumers an average cost based on regulated retail tariff from the era of vertical integration, even as the retailers themselves are forced to purchase electricity at volatile wholesale prices set in open markets. This results in considerable price risk for retailers, who are sometimes forbidden by regulators from signing hedging contracts. More importantly, because end-users do not perceive real-time (or even hourly or daily) fluctuations in the wholesale price of electricity, they have no incentive to adjust their consumption in response to price signals. Consequently, demand for electricity is highly inelastic, and electricity generation resources can be stretched to the point where system stability is threatened. This, then, facilitates many other problems associated with electricity markets, such as market power and price volatility. Indeed, economic theory suggests that even modestly price-responsive demand can remove the stress on generation resources and decrease spot prices. To test this theory, we use actual generator bid data from the New York control area to construct supply stacks, and intersect them with demand curves of various slopes to approximate different levels of demand elasticity.

60|$|Perhaps these {{circumstances}} gave the locality its infelicitous reputation. Vague rumors were bruited of a supernatural influence {{that had been}} exercised on the tenants. Strange stories were circulated {{of the origin of}} the diabolical title by which the promontory was known. By some it was believed to be haunted by the spirit of one of Sir Francis Drake's sailors who had deserted his ship in consequence of stories told by the Indians of gold discoveries, but who had perished by starvation on the rocks. A vaquero who had once passed a night in the ruined cabin, related how a strangely dressed and emaciated figure had knocked at the door at midnight and demanded food. Other story-tellers, of more historical accuracy, roundly asserted that Sir Francis himself had been little better than a pirate, and had chosen this <b>spot</b> to conceal <b>quantities</b> of ill-gotten booty, taken from neutral bottoms, and had protected his hiding-place by the orthodox means of hellish incantation and diabolic agencies. On moonlight nights a shadowy ship was sometimes seen standing off-and-on, or when fogs encompassed sea and shore the noise of oars rising and falling in their row-locks could be heard muffled and indistinctly during the night. Whatever foundation there might have been for these stories, it was certain that a more weird and desolate-looking spot could not have been selected for their theatre. High hills, verdureless and enfiladed with dark canadas, cast their gaunt shadows on the tide. During a greater portion of the day the wind, which blew furiously and incessantly, seemed possessed with a spirit of fierce disquiet and unrest. Toward nightfall the sea-fog crept with soft step through the portals of the Golden Gate, or stole in noiseless marches down the hillside, tenderly soothing the wind-buffeted face of the cliff, until sea and sky were hid together. At such times the populous city beyond and the nearer settlement seemed removed to an infinite distance. An immeasurable loneliness settled upon the cliff. The creaking of a windlass, or the monotonous chant of sailors on some unseen, outlying ship, came faint and far, and full of mystic suggestion.|$|R
40|$|The brief {{interaction}} of precipitation with a forest canopy {{can create a}} high spatial variability of both throughfall and solute deposition. We hypothesized that (i) the variability in natural forest systems is high but depends on system-inherent stability, (ii) the spatial variability of solute deposition shows seasonal dynamics depending on the increase in rainfall frequency, and (iii) spatial patterns persist only in the short-term. The study area in the north-western Brazilian state of Rondonia is subject to a climate with a distinct wet and dry season. We collected rain and throughfall on an event basis during the early wet season (n = 14) and peak of the wet season (n = 14) and analyzed the samples for pH and concentrations of NH 4 +, Na+, K+, Ca 2 + Mg 2 +,, Cl-, NO 3 -, SO 42 - and DOC. The coefficient 3 4 cient of variation for throughfall based on both sampling intervals was 29 %, {{which is at the}} lower end of values reported from other tropical forest sites, but which is higher than in most temperate forests. Coefficients of variation of solute deposition ranged from 29 % to 52 %. This heterogeneity of solute deposition is neither particularly high nor particularly tow compared with a range of tropical and temperate forest ecosystems. We observed an increase in solute deposition variability with the progressing wet season, which was explained by a negative correlation between heterogeneity of solute deposition and antecedent dry period. The temporal stability of throughfall. patterns was Low during the early wet season, but gained in stability as the wet season progressed. We suggest that rapid plant growth at the beginning of the rainy season is responsible for the lower stability, whereas less vegetative activity during the later rainy season might favor the higher persistence of ""hot"" and ""cold"" <b>spots</b> of throughfall. <b>quantities.</b> The relatively high stability of throughfall patterns during later stages of the wet season may influence processes at the forest floor and in the soil. Solute deposition patterns showed less clear trends but all patterns displayed a short-term stability only.

40|$|The {{aberration}} {{theory of}} Buchdahl is extended to allow greater utilisation {{of it in}} optical image assessment and automatic design programs. Expressions are presented for the calculation of the derivatives of the seventh order aberration coefficients {{as well as for}} the determination of effects on the derivatives of OT coefficients due to pupil shifts arising from parameter changes. Where details of the theory for various constructional parameters differ attention has been confined to axial curvature derivatives. The wavefront retardation expansion has been checked for convergence and the results show general agreement with the convergence properties found by other authors for transverse aberration expansions. A series of transformations, valid over the region of convergence of the retardation expansion, is introduced to reduce the exit pupil periphery defined on a reference sphere to a circle. It is shown that, under these transformations, the form of the retardation expansion remains constant and only the coefficients need be altered. These changes are independent of the field angle but depend on the f-number of the system. A new set of assessment functions, derived from the real and imaginary parts of the optical transfer function,is introduced. It is shown that, in the geometrical limit, these approximate a set of functions defined in terms of the spot diagram distribution. Theoretical and numerical comparisons of these and some other assessment functions are presented. These show that, in general, there is agreement on the ordering of correction states when different criteria are used. However some differences in ranking do arise and these are discussed. It is found that, with a modification to allow for products of two negative quantities, a function based on the variance, V(r), of the aberration difference function provides an extremely versatile assessment quantity. The usefulness of this new quantity is shown, both theoretically and numerically, to extend far beyond the conditions under which V(r) provides a valid approximation to the modulation transfer function. Predictions of the location of optimum image planes using the various criteria are examined, and it is shown that by choosing different fractional spatial frequencies, r, at which to evaluate V(r), most of these predictions can be obtained using minimization of the variance V(r). Finally all the assessment functions introduced are used to examine two different processes of automatic optical design based on reduction of transverse aberrations. The first of these is a primitive design program, developed by the writer, which uses derivatives of the <b>spot</b> diagram assessment <b>quantities</b> introduced earlier. The second method, due to Cruickshank, reduces selected aberration coefficients to prescribed residuals determined by the designer on the basis of past experience and the requirements of the user. The results from this work indicate that the choice of assessment function is not critical in attaining an optimum region of parameter space, but the actual optimum point is dependent on the choice of assessment function. The usefulness of the modified function based on V(r) is again illustrated numerically...|$|R
