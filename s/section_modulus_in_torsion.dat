50|$|The {{hydraulic}} load on {{this type of}} spillway gate (Tainter gate) is transmitted from the cylindrical skin plate, which is {{in contact with the}} reservoir, through a number of struts to a convergence at the trunnion hub. The hub collects the load from the struts and transfers it across an interface to the trunnion pin, which is stationary and is connected to the dam. When the gate is operated, the hub rotates around the pin. The struts are primarily compression members, but friction at the pin-hub interface induces a bending stress during gate operation. Typically, and in this case, the struts are oriented such that the trunnion friction stress is applied to the weak axis of the struts (see <b>Section</b> <b>modulus).</b> <b>In</b> order to better handle these loads, the struts are connected with diagonal braces that take the stress as axial loads. At Folsom Dam, increasing corrosion at the pin-hub interface had raised the coefficient of friction and, therefore, the bending stress in the strut and the axial force in the brace. The capacity of the brace connection was exceeded and it failed. This caused the load to redistribute and the failure progressed, eventually buckling the struts.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Analysis of {{anatomical}} {{traits of}} faba bean stems, in traditional cultivar Neptun and self-completing one, Granit, {{was carried out}} in two stages of seed maturity, both physiological and technical one, on segments of the length of 40 mm, sampled from an internode right under the first pods. Studied faba bean cultivars differed significantly in terms of 8 out of 15 tested anatomical traits of stems. Stem in cultivar Neptun was characterized by a greater width of sclerenchyma, and thickness and width of its cells, as well as width of phloem and xylem. In cultivar Granit, a significantly greater thickness of parenchyma layer and of xylem cells was observed, as well as a higher proportion of tissues in the stem. Plant maturation was accompanied by a significant decrease in the width of epidermis cells, in the thickness of parenchyma layer and in the thickness of sclerenchyma and phloem cells. Only 6 morphological traits of plants were significantly correlated with the anatomical structure of faba bean stems, and they included: plant height and height of the first pod setting, length of the stem fruit-bearing, thickness of the stem wall and its internal diameter, as well as the dry weight of faba bean plant. Significant negative correlations between anatomical traits of stem, and its resistance to bending was observed for: width of epidermis cells, thickness of parenchyma layer and in phloem thickness.

30|$|High N {{application}} rates, {{an important}} environmental factor, increases grain yield but decreases lodging resistance in rice plants by weakening the physical {{strength of the}} lower internodes (Wu et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2015). Zhang WJ et al. (2014) indicated that N application rates decreased the breaking strength of culms by reducing bending stress in japonica super rice and decreasing <b>section</b> <b>modulus</b> <b>in</b> indica super rice. In wheat, Wei et al. (2008) suggested that the reduction of basal N application rates reduced {{the length of the}} lower internodes but increased the culm diameter, the culm wall thickness and the breaking strength, reducing the lodging index, which was consistent with a previous report by Lu et al. (2014). Our data showed that the culm wall thickness varied little, and the culm diameter increased rapidly in both cultivars of japonica rice with an increase in top-dressing N application rates (Table  1). However, the breaking strength was significantly reduced, which resulted in a higher lodging index (Fig.  1). These results are not consistent with previous reports (Ma et al., 2004; Kashiwagi et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2009). It is reasonable that the morphological traits of the basal stem were influenced by solar radiation reaching to the stem base, which largely depends on the leaf area index (LAI) and maximum tiller number at the panicle initiation stage (Li 1979; Ling et al., 1994). In this study, the maximum tiller number and LAI at the panicle initiation stage were almost identical under different top-dressing N application rates (data not shown); thus, the culm diameter might increase under higher N application rates at the panicle initiation stage, which is consistent with the reports by Li et al. (2013) and Wu et al. (2015).|$|R

40|$|Mechanical {{spectroscopy}} {{measurements were}} performed on two types of materials: decagonal quasicrystalline Al-Cu-Fe-Cr coatings deposited on a mild steel substrate and aluminium or magnesium matrix composites reinforced with icosahedral quasicrystalline Al-Cu-Fe particles. The internal friction spectra of the substrate with three different thicknesses of the coating indicate that the internal friction of such composites is mostly caused by the quasicrystalline coating and that {{the contributions of the}} steel substrate and of the interface are small. The shear <b>modulus</b> measured <b>in</b> <b>torsion</b> increases with temperature, while the Young's <b>modulus</b> measured <b>in</b> flexion behaves normally. This shear modulus anomaly is interpreted as due to a solid friction between cracked segments of the quasicrystalline coating. This phenomenon can also explain the broad athermal maximum, which was found to occur in isochronal internal friction measurements. A quantitative model successfully reproducing the observed behaviour was developed. Finally, the reversible high-temperature exponential background was interpreted as due to the onset of the brittle-to-ductile transition, which may be associated with dislocation motion controlled by collective phason flips in the quasicrystalline coating. The measured activation enthalpy is similar to the value that was deduced from compression tests performed on icosahedral Al-Cu-Fe bulk material. Aluminium or magnesium matrix composites reinforced with icosahedral Al-Cu-Fe particles were processed by gas pressure infiltration and characterised by X-ray diffractometry, electron microscopy observations, micro-hardness measurements, and compression tests. The internal friction spectra of these composites also show a high-temperature exponential background, while measurements of the matrix alone or of the matrix with Al 2 O 3 short fibres exhibit a different behaviour. The difference can be explained by a partial phase transformation of the matrix due to the presence of the quasicrystalline particles. The exponential background is probably caused by dislocation motion in the matrix, however, the effect of the quasicrystalline reinforcement can be neither excluded nor confirmed with certainty...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the longitudinal strength of ships with damages due to grounding or collision accidents. Analytical equations are derived for the residual hull girder strength and verified with direct calculations of sample commercial ships for a broad spectrum of accidents. Hull girder ultimate strengths of these sample vessels under sagging and hogging conditions are also calculated, based on which correlation equations are proposed. To evaluate a grounded ship, using the <b>section</b> <b>modulus</b> to the deck would be optimistic, while using the <b>section</b> <b>modulus</b> to the bottom would be conservative. On the contrary, to evaluate a collided ship, using the <b>section</b> <b>modulus</b> to the deck would be conservative, while using the <b>section</b> <b>modulus</b> to the bottom would be optimistic. The derived analytical formulae are then applied to a fleet of 67 commercial ships, including 21 double hull tankers, 18 bulk carriers, 22 single hull tankers and six container carriers. The mean values, standard deviations and coefficients of variation for the coefficients in these new analytical formulae are obtained. The ship length exhibits little influence on these coefficients because they are close to the mean values although ship length spans from 150 to 400 m. The ship type shows some influence on the residual strength. Uniform equations are proposed for commercial ships which do not depend on a ship’s principal dimensions. These formulae provide very handy tools for predicting the residual strength in seconds, without performing step-by-step detailed calculations, an obvious advantage in cases of emergency or salvage operation. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.
