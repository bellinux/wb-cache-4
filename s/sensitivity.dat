5|$|Each {{of these}} {{positive}} outcomes requires some ability to forgo short-term reward {{in favor of}} a higher payoff in the future. The ability to delay gratification also appears to be a buffer against rejection <b>sensitivity</b> (the tendency to be anxious when anticipating interpersonal rejection). In a 20-year follow-up of the marshmallow experiment, individuals with vulnerability to high rejection <b>sensitivity</b> who had shown strong delay of gratification abilities as preschoolers had higher self-esteem and self-worth and more adaptive coping skills, in comparison to the individuals who had high rejection <b>sensitivity</b> but low delay of gratification as four-year-olds. These compelling longitudinal findings converge with other studies showing a similar pattern: The ability to resist temptation early in life translates to persistent benefits across settings.|$|E

40|$|Sensory <b>sensitivities</b> {{are widely}} {{reported}} among individuals with ASD. These sensory <b>sensitivities</b> {{can be classified}} as over-responsivity, under-responsivity, or seeking of sensory stimulation. Following recent changes in the diagnostic criteria, sensory <b>sensitivities</b> are considered a key feature of the behavioral phenotype of ASDs. Despite their significance, sensory <b>sensitivities</b> have been largely underestimated. Therefore, more {{research in this area}} may reveal important information about the influence of <b>sensitivities</b> on functioning, as well as the underlying causes of the symptoms. This study investigated a possible relationship between sensory <b>sensitivities</b> and cognitive and adaptive abilities in children with ASD.

40|$|Abstract Background Many tussive {{agents are}} {{components}} of foods, but {{little is known}} about the relationship between cough reflex and oral chemesthesis <b>sensitivities.</b> We investigated the relationships between cough reflex and oral chemesthesis in individuals using two transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV 1) agonists with different potencies: capsaicin and capsiate. Methods Twenty-eight healthy never-smokers were allocated to evaluate cough and oral chemesthesis of capsinoids. Cough reflex <b>sensitivities</b> are estimated by the lowest concentrations generating five coughs by each TRPV 1 agonist inhalation. Oral chemesthesis <b>sensitivities</b> are estimated by the lowest concentrations which generate a hot sensation when filter paper loaded with each TRPV 1 agonist is placed on the tongue. Results There were strong correlations between capsaicin- and capsiate-induced cough reflex <b>sensitivities,</b> and between capsaicin- and capsiate-induced oral chemesthesis <b>sensitivities.</b> However, there were no significant correlations between cough reflex and oral chemesthesis <b>sensitivities</b> induced by both capsaicin and capsiate. The cough reflex <b>sensitivities</b> are significantly greater in females than in males whereas there were no gender differences in oral chemesthesis. Conclusion The results showed that the <b>sensitivities</b> of sensory afferents were different between cough reflex and oral chemesthesis, suggesting that TRPV 1 <b>sensitivities</b> differ between organs within healthy individuals. Capsiate could be a tussigen for the cough challenge test. </p...|$|R

5|$|The {{specificity}} of RSTs {{for the presence}} of GAS is at least 95%, with some studies finding close to 100% specificity. Therefore, if the test result is positive, the presence of GAS is highly likely. However, 5% to 20% of individuals carry GAS in their throats without symptomatic infection, so the presence of GAS in an individual with pharyngitis does not prove that this organism is responsible for the infection. The <b>sensitivity</b> of lateral flow RSTs is somewhat lower at 65% to 80%. Therefore, a negative result from such a test cannot be used to rule out GAS pharyngitis, a considerable disadvantage compared with microbial culture, which has a <b>sensitivity</b> of 90% to 95%. However, newer optical immunoassay RSTs have been found to have a much higher <b>sensitivity</b> of 94%.|$|E

40|$|It is well {{established}} {{that in order to}} obtain the best colour performance of a colour input device such as a scanner or a camera,that one needs to know the device spectral <b>sensitivities.</b> Unfortunately measuring <b>sensitivities</b> outside the laboratory is hard and moreover,manufacturers are reluctant to give the user specifications. Thus,there has been considerable interest in developing numerical techniques for estimating the spectral <b>sensitivities.</b> These methods are based on taking images of known spectral targets and then,using knowledge of the image formation process,solving for the <b>sensitivities</b> using numerical methods. It is important to state that while these methods perform reasonably well,the problem is inherently ill-posed. There is simply not enough degrees of freedom in the spectral profile of a reflectance target to recover device <b>sensitivities.</b> In this paper we tackle this uncertainty head on and develop a method to recover device <b>sensitivities</b> with uncertainty error bars. Experiments with a Megavision camera return a sensor estimate together with error bars. The error bars are sufficient to explain the discrepancy in the recoveries delivered by single-answer estimation algorithms and the actual <b>sensitivities...</b>|$|R

Maternal <b>sensitivity</b> affects child development at all stages through life, from infancy, {{all the way to}} adulthood. In general, more sensitive mothers have healthier, more socially and cognitively developed children than those who are not as sensitive. Also, maternal <b>sensitivity</b> has been found to affect the person psychologically even as an adult. Adults who experienced high maternal <b>sensitivity</b> during their childhood were found to be more secure than those who experienced less sensitive mothers. Once the adult becomes a parent themselves, their own understanding of maternal <b>sensitivity</b> will affect their own children's development.

40|$|AbstractThe human {{visual system}} encodes the {{chromatic}} signals conveyed {{by the three}} types of retinal cone photoreceptors in an opponent fashion. This opponency is thought to reduce redundant information by decorrelating the photoreceptor signals. Correlations in the receptor signals are caused by the substantial overlap of the spectral <b>sensitivities</b> of the receptors, {{but it is not clear}} to what extent the properties of natural spectra contribute to the correlations. To investigate the influences of natural spectra and photoreceptor spectral <b>sensitivities,</b> we attempted to find linear codes with minimal redundancy for trichromatic images assuming human cone spectral <b>sensitivities,</b> or hypothetical non-overlapping cone <b>sensitivities,</b> respectively. The resulting properties of basis functions are similar in both cases. They are non-orthogonal, show strong opponency along an achromatic direction (luminance edges) and along chromatic directions, and they achieve a highly efficient encoding of natural chromatic signals. Thus, color opponency arises for the encoding of human cone signals, i. e. with strongly overlapping spectral <b>sensitivities,</b> but also under the assumption of non-overlapping spectral <b>sensitivities.</b> Our results suggest that color opponency may in part be a result of the properties of natural spectra and not solely a consequence of the cone spectral <b>sensitivities...</b>|$|R
