25|$|The {{day of the}} murder, an {{eyewitness}} came forward and told investigators that she allegedly saw {{the two young men}} involved in Bermúdez Zacarías' murder. She said that the two men were of slim complexion and may have been 24–25 years old; according to her description, one was fully dressed in black and that the other had dark pants and a white sweater. The woman saw them as she was driving through the street where Bermúdez Zacarías was murdered. When she first saw the two men, she did not think they were suspicious because she thought they were construction workers from a nearby site. As she was driving down the street, she saw Bermúdez Zacarías on the road and thought that he had fainted. When she got close to the body, she noticed a pool of blood. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> look at the two men, who kept walking down the street in an opposite direction.|$|E
2500|$|The ancient Law of Moses (the Torah) forbids {{men from}} lying with men (i.e., from having intercourse) in Leviticus 18 {{and gives a}} story of {{attempted}} homosexual rape in Genesis 19, {{in the story of}} Sodom and Gomorrah, after which the cities were soon destroyed with [...] "brimstone and fire, from the Lord" [...] and the death penalty was prescribed to its inhabitants and to Lot's wife who was tuned into a pillar of salt because <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> watch the cities' destruction. In Deuteronomy 22:5, cross-dressing is condemned as [...] "abominable".|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: A {{painting}} by Mola Ram: Abhisarika nayika, [...] "the heroine {{going to meet}} her lover". <b>She</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> look at a golden anklet, which has just fallen off. There are also snakes below and lightning above.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> her <b>back</b> <b>to</b> him {{and stood}} looking at the fire again.|$|R
50|$|<b>She</b> then <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{virology}} {{and joined}} the effort to develop an HIV vaccine.|$|R
60|$|He {{answered}} vaguely. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Hunterleys. She {{was busy}} tearing up her handkerchief.|$|E
60|$|A suggestive gleam {{crept into}} Winifred's eyes, but it {{vanished}} and her manner became authoritative when <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Sproatly.|$|E
60|$|Whereupon <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> her arranging, fixing, stitching, {{his nerves}} jumped with anger as the sewing-machine started and stuttered and buzzed.|$|E
5000|$|In {{one of the}} back-up issues, June Moone {{was called}} upon by Amanda Waller to help a {{military}} general whose house had been possessed by a demon. <b>She</b> <b>turns</b> into the Enchantress but the Enchantress ends up scheming with the demon to escape Amanda Waller and destroy the world. <b>She</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> June to have the demon remove the bomb device and set the Enchantress free. However, the demon attacks her and frightens her. June, in retaliation, unleashes magic and banishes the demon, without turning into the Enchantress.|$|R
6000|$|... "For a poor vanquished woman," [...] <b>she</b> observed, <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Lutchester, [...] "I feel {{extraordinarily}} gay to-night. Tell me some more." ...|$|R
50|$|Hanna: Born in 1910, she is {{a sickly}} girl {{who seems to be}} resented by her own mother. As a result, she tragically dies in the {{accident}} that held on the Little Baroness. She is the antagonist in the game wherein she is physically transformed as a creature with only a head and tentacles. After she is defeated, <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> her original form and is saved by Eric before she departs along with the Little Baroness in the good ending.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the coffin. Suddenly {{she lost}} every vestige of self-control. She sank {{down on her}} knees beside the trestle. [...] "Why have you left me!" [...] she cried.|$|E
6000|$|... "Am I in time?" [...] {{were the}} first words that escaped her on {{entering}} the room. Reassured by the answer, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the door, eager to hurry upstairs to Kitty's bedside.|$|E
60|$|In {{the step}} of the {{slightly}} stolid girl {{there was a new}} lightness, a new ecstasy in walking rapidly through the stirring New York air, as <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the Sessionses' flat.|$|E
60|$|Anne {{watched her}} until she {{was lost in the}} shadows of the chill and misty night. Then <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> slowly <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the glow of her own radiant hearthstone.|$|R
6000|$|... "You haven't told me anything." [...] And <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> her <b>back</b> <b>to</b> him, {{looking away}} at the splendid view. [...] "I do love the scenery," [...] she added in a moment.|$|R
60|$|She {{walked to}} the door and stood uneasily {{listening}} in the passage until she heard the clatter of hoofs in the paved patio, and knew that he had ordered his horse. Then <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> relieved <b>to</b> her room.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Cowles shivered. No {{one could}} {{possibly}} have {{looked more like a}} person closing a door without actually closing one. [...] "Lena!" [...] she shrieked, [...] "close the kitchen door. There's a draught." [...] <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Carl.|$|E
60|$|She {{said nothing}} for a moment. But the tears {{gathered}} in her eyes, her lips quivered and Maurice {{knew that she was}} thanking God. Then <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> him and he could see her face glowing with excitement.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, my dear, when once I'm sure of YOU!" [...] Rosier murmured in her ear; whereupon <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{the other}} rooms {{with a little}} air of {{consistency}} which seemed to imply that their appeal should be immediate.|$|E
50|$|Daphne sees {{no sign of}} Tiny when <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the {{orchestra}} pit, but he is lifted into view on the organ {{that had been used}} to provide background music for Arnold's movies. It now glows white, being played by a spectral organist; Tiny climbs off, unhurt, but Arnold's spirit rises from his body and steps on at the organist's beckoning. The organ swiftly drops out of sight, carrying a terrified Arnold down to hell. As the theater begins to collapse, Daphne persuades Tiny to overcome his fear of rejection and leave with her. They and the dogs exit into the light of the outside world.|$|R
6000|$|... "Laws, how odd!" [...] said Augusta. [...] "Always carried {{about by}} four men! I'm sure I shouldn't like it. Am I right behind, Mamma? I {{feel as if}} I was open;" [...] and <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> her <b>back</b> <b>to</b> her anxious parent.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} scenes show Victor descending into greater {{anxiety and}} violence. His sleep {{is interrupted by}} distress. He sits for long, inert periods besides an empty canvas. It is implied that he is so bothered by {{the song of the}} birds outside of his atelier that he hammers them by their wings against a wall and sets them alight. Finally, he is shown holding a gun to his female companion. She remains composed, as <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> her <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Victor and extends her hand across the wall. <b>She</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> face him and tells Victor that she cherishes him the way he is, that he should give her a chance, {{and that it would be}} foolish for him to shoot her. She asks him why he has never wished to be caressed. Victor’s hand tremors and he throws the gun aside. The camera cuts to a wide shot, revealing that the female companion is not clothed except for trousers and a tie; she presents Victor with a whip, which she begins to coat with a viscous substance followed by a white, granular powder. Watching intently, Victor begins to undress.|$|R
60|$|The car {{had stopped}} outside the theatre. Hat in hand, {{and with his}} face wreathed in smiles, the commissionaire had thrown open the door. The people on the {{pavement}} were nudging one another--a famous woman was about to descend. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Philip.|$|E
60|$|Miss Rachel was {{the next}} to say good-night. She shook hands first with Mr. Godfrey, who was {{standing}} {{at the other end of}} the hall, looking at a picture. Then <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Franklin, still sitting weary and silent in a corner.|$|E
60|$|As {{she moved}} forward, she was {{suddenly}} conscious {{of the man who}} had been talking to Madame Selarne. He had drawn a little on one side and he was watching the young soldier with a curious intentness. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> her nephew and touched him on the arm.|$|E
50|$|Three months later, Maddy {{is married}} and sitting with her {{children}} {{in front of the}} house where they eliminated the first population of the vampire bats. She suddenly looks nervous and seems to be scared by something, but <b>she</b> quickly <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> play with her kids.|$|R
6000|$|She {{rubbed her}} cheek against his. [...] "Now we must run," [...] she said. <b>She</b> quickly <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{the shadow of}} the board-walk, to draw on her {{stockings}} and shoes, kneeling on the sand like the simple maid of the ballads which she had been envying.|$|R
60|$|Dora, {{from the}} kitchen window, saw Ralph {{go out to the}} woodhouse, and she saw him {{returning}} with an arm-load of small sticks. Then <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> her <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the kitchen door, and bent her head over a beefsteak she was preparing for the gridiron.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, it's mine; my own." [...] And, turning round, {{she slipped}} the little ring off her finger. When <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> him, {{his face had}} not {{recovered}} from her words. It had a hapless look, as of one to whom such a thing ought not to have happened.|$|E
6000|$|... said old Mrs. Possum, {{grinning}} in {{the most}} aggravating way as <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> her babies. She had found out {{what she wanted to}} know--Sammy Jay had seen nothing of Unc' Billy Possum. Old Mrs. Possum sat down with her head in her hands. She was more worried than ever.|$|E
6000|$|An old {{man with}} weak eyes and a loose-hung mouth shuffled forward. To him the girl explained: [...] "This is Mrs. Ollnee's son. He says his mother is dead. I'm going up there. You look out for the baby." [...] <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Victor. [...] "When did she die?" ...|$|E
30|$|She was {{recommended}} not to carry more than 3  kilos of weight {{with her left}} arm. At her 12  months check up, the lady was still highly satisfied with her situation. Meanwhile, <b>she</b> had <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> work in her beauty parlor (administration and supervision tasks, no active hairdressing anymore).|$|R
60|$|She {{came into}} the room with a sad and weary {{expression}} in her eyes, which changed, however, the moment she observed the magnificently-dressed French forewoman, into a look of astonishment, and almost of awe. Her manner became shy and embarrassed; and after an instant of hesitation, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> silently <b>to</b> the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Does {{this suit}} you, Mr. Bhaer?" [...] <b>she</b> asked, <b>turning</b> her <b>back</b> <b>to</b> him, and feeling deeply {{grateful}} for the chance of hiding her face.|$|R
