40|$|In {{the last}} decades, much {{research}} has focused on a better understanding of so-called <b>spin</b> <b>glasses</b> (e. g., the alloys CuMn and AuFe.) <b>Spin</b> <b>glasses</b> are not yet fully understood.

Maximum cuts can be determined exactly with a branch-and-cut algorithm. This thesis consists of two parts.
