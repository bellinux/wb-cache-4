50|$|Some {{of these}} {{benchmarks}} are combined {{in the form}} of ratios in order to better understand the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock.</b> A Fcurr/Fmsy ratio greater than one indicates that overfishing is occurring. When SSBcurr/SSBmsy is greater than one, the MSY will be produced, but if it is less than one it means that the stock is overfished. MFMT and MSST are used as limit reference points. When MFMT is exceeded or the spawning stock size dips below MSST the fishery is shut down. A benchmark that is currently gaining in popularity is SPR, spawning potential ratio. The SPR is the average fecundity of a recruit over its lifetime when the stock is fished divided by the average fecundity of a recruit over its lifetime when the stock is unfished. The SPR is based on the principle that certain levels of fish have to survive in order to spawn and replenish the stock at a sustainable level.|$|E

The 1971 year-class dominated and was found to be rather rich, making together with the 1972 year-class more than 80 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock.</b> Adult capeling was mostly found in mixture with young capelin and only exceptionally recorded as catchable shoals...|$|R
40|$|In the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO), which {{accounts}} for over half of world tuna production, purse seine effort and catch on floating objects have increased significantly due to a rapid increase in <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> fixed and free-floating fish aggregation devices (FADs). FAD fishing has {{had an impact on}} <b>the</b> current <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three main target tunas in the equatorial WCPO, skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis), yellowfin (Thunnus albacares) and bigeye (T. obesus). FADs have been shown to influence the behaviour and movement patterns <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three tuna species with <b>the</b> juveniles <b>of</b> each species occupying shallower habitats when associated with FADs. Aggregation of tunas around drifting objects increases their vulnerability to purse seine gear, particularly for juvenile and small size classes. Further to the impacts on <b>the</b> target <b>stocks,</b> <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> FADs has increased <b>the</b> vulnerability <b>of</b> other fishes to the purse seine method, including some shark and billfish species. Given the concern over FAD-related fishing effort on target and bycatch species, {{there is a need to}} understand how FAD use affects target and bycatch stocks. Science needs to better support management decisions are highlighted including the need to identify <b>the</b> magnitude <b>of</b> broader community-level affects...|$|R
