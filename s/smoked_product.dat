40|$|ABSTRACT: Introduction & Objective: It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that up to 75 % of women in their child-bearing age have been affected by vulvovaginal candidiasis at least once in their life time. Almost 45 % of women experience this infection two or more times. The antifungal azole group, in topical and oral forms, is the common way of therapy. Herbal products are often used for vulvovaginal therapy. Nowadays, Toucrium polium (TP) products are being used as traditional medicine to reduce signs of Candida vaginitis. There is no study regarding to antifungal activity of TP <b>smoke</b> <b>product</b> in Iran. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the In vitro activity of TP <b>smoke</b> <b>product</b> against Candida, isolated from women with Candida vaginitis, compared with antifungal drugs which are ordinary used to cure Candida vaginitis. Materials & Methods: The present study was conducted at the University of Medical Sciences of Shiraz in 1387 (2008). During seven months, samples were taken from 450 patients suffering from urogenital infections and 105 Candida vaginitis were detected. Germ tube test was used for identification of fungal species. TP <b>smoke</b> <b>product</b> was prepared in suitable potency. Antifungal activity of fluconazole, clotrimazole and TP product were evaluated by disk diffusion method. Sterile blank disks were loaded by TP <b>smoke</b> <b>product</b> in potency of 10 - 240 microliter/disk. Inhibition zone around the disks were measured and compared with each other. Results: 105 Candida species were isolated from the patients. Candida species were identified by germ tube test as Candida albicans 74 (70. 5 %) and Candida non-albicans 31 (29. 5 %). The mean of inhibition zone around the clotrimazole disks was 22 ± 5. 39 along with one case of resistance. Forty seven species had resistance to fluconazole while 94 % and 55. 2. % of all samples were sensitive to clotrimazole and fluconazole respectively. All of the clinical isolates and standard Candida species were sensitive to TP <b>smoke</b> <b>product.</b> Conclusion: Considering the resistance of Candida species to antifungal drugs and good antifungal activity of TP <b>smoke</b> <b>product,</b> it is necessary to analyze the main compounds and chemical contents of TP extract for better evaluation of its antifungal activity.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the effect of dry salting, cold smoking and 14 days refrigerated storage at 4 °C on the stability of carotenoids, color and fatty acids in commercially reared organic Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). As reference, conventionally reared Atlantic salmon was used. Pigment sources in feeds for the organic and conventional salmon were Panaferd-AX® (PAN) and Carophyll Pink® (CP), respectively. The dry salting process was found to be the main cause for losses of carotenoids throughout salting, smoking and storage, whereas no differences were found in stability of the different flesh carotenoids. The diverse composition of flesh carotenoids in organic salmon seems however to have minor influence on the color of the cold <b>smoked</b> <b>product.</b> Colorimetric characteristics of the fillet surface and liquid loss during storage of cold smoke fillets were found to be mostly affected by the fatty acid composition of the flesh which differed between the organic and conventional raw material. Moreover, dry salting and cold smoking were found to alter colorimetric differences between raw organically and conventionally reared salmon, resulting in an equal colorimetric perception of cold smoked organic and conventional salmon fillets after 14 days refrigerated vacuum storage.

40|$|The {{effects of}} several {{slaughter}} methods {{on the quality}} of fresh and smoked trout and fresh gilthead seabreamwere evaluated during storage at 2 ◦C. Electrically stunned trout had slower ATP depletion of raw muscleand lower lipid oxidation in <b>smoked</b> <b>product</b> during storage. Gilthead seabream immersed in an ice slurry(IS group) after the harvest showed a more regular ATP depletion than in fish exposed to CO 2. Nevertheless,in the case of the IS group, self-initiated behaviour, response to handling and breathing all ceased only after 15 – 20 min, whereas carbon dioxide-stunned fish appeared dead after 5 min. However, gilthead seabream grouphaving slower ATP depletion also showed lower lipid oxidation of muscle during storage. In both species thiscould be due to the rapid conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase to xanthine oxidase induced by the rapidconsumption of ATP.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Food, Nutrition, Dietetics and HealthEdgar Chambers IVSmoking of food {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} methods of food {{preservation}} and still is used widely to help preserve foods such as meats, fish and cheeses. Apart from its conservation function, the smoking process also has a considerable influence on the sensory characteristics of the products. A highly trained, skilled descriptive sensory panel identified, defined and referenced 14 attributes related to the flavor of food <b>products</b> labeled as <b>smoked</b> or smoky. The lexicon included: Smoky (Overall), Ashy, Woody, Musty/Dusty, Musty/Earthy, Burnt, Acrid, Pungent, Petroleum-Like, Creosote/Tar, Cedar, Bitter, Metallic and Sour. Definitions of these attributes were written and references were found that anchor a 0 - 15 point scale. This lexicon was used to evaluate the differences among <b>smoked</b> <b>products</b> under different circumstances such as products on the market versus <b>products</b> <b>smoked</b> at home, different woods used to <b>smoke</b> <b>products</b> and the length of time a product spends in the smoker. There are many methods used to impart this smoky flavor and due to health, environmental and economic concerns, many producers use nontraditional methods while hobbyists thrive on the traditional methods. Descriptive analysis was used to see if there are differences between <b>products</b> <b>smoked</b> using an at-home smoker and market products. Using principal component analysis, cluster analysis and analysis of variance, it was found that market products were significantly different than <b>products</b> <b>smoked</b> using an at home smoker. The market products were significantly more Sour and less Smoky, Ashy, Woody, Musty/Dusty and Acrid. Many types of woods are used to <b>smoke</b> <b>products</b> and many market products distinguish themselves based on the wood used. Six highly trained panelists evaluated pork that was smoked with either hickory, mesquite, cherrywood or Applewood and was smoked for 1, 2 or 4 hours. The flavor profiles of the smoke flavor was similar between the types of woods although as the length of time in the smoker increased and the intensities of most attributes rose, the differences among <b>products</b> <b>smoked</b> with different woods became more pronounced. Apple wood <b>smoked</b> <b>products</b> had higher intensities for Overall Smoky, Ashy, Burnt, Pungent, Petroleum-Like, Creosote/Tar and Cedar, while cherry wood <b>smoked</b> <b>products</b> had lower intensities for all attributes. Hickory and Mesquite <b>smoked</b> <b>products</b> were not significantly different from each other and typically scored between the other two woods. Smoking is a slow process and many popular restaurants that <b>smoke</b> their own <b>products</b> find that their claims of smoking for long periods of time are beneficial to their image. Descriptive analysis was used to see how the flavor changes based on the length of time the product (pork) was in the smoker. The samples of pork ranged from not smoked to smoked for 15 hours, with samples at every 2. 5 hour increment. For most attributes, the intensities went up with the amount of time the product was in the smoker. The only exceptions were Musty/Earthy and Sour. The regression analysis revealed that Smoky, Ashy, Acrid, Creosote/Tar and Bitter are all at least moderately correlated with the time the product spent in the smoker...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this study, a {{new method}} to assess salt content in smoked fish {{products}} using impedance spectroscopy has been developed. Two fish species (salmon and cod) {{from two different}} brands were analyzed. The analyses carried out were moisture, lipid, and salt contents, as well as aw. Impedance measurements were performed directly in different locations on <b>smoked</b> <b>product</b> by using a coaxial needle. The modulus and phase of the spectra of impedance were acquired between 1 Hz and 1 MHz, for 50 values of frequency. The impedance modulus and phase values were used to predict the studied physico-chemical parameters, by using the PLS method. In general, the highest lipid contents and the lowest moisture values were observed in salmon samples, independently of the brand and the batch analyzed. The results showed a high variability between batches of a same product, regarding to moisture and salt content. Prediction models were established for all the samples studied and also individually for each product. A higher accuracy of prediction was obtained for the PLS models established for each product compared with the model applied for all samples. In general, the highest R 2 was obtained for prediction of aw parameter, followed by moisture content. The best correlations were obtained for smoked cod samples independently of the brand. These results {{can be explained by}} the isolating effect of the fat. Due to the differences in the raw material composition, a single model cannot be applied for all the products. A previous characterization of the raw material would improve the accuracy of the developed methodology.

This preference test was conducted as a Central Location Test in Tokyo and Osaka. 240 married women were recruited as participants evenly distributed in age groups between 30 to 60 years of age. Product testing was also done by a Japanese expert sensory panel. In the product category of smoked, Japanese consumers ranked the Norwegian trout as the best! Smoked products based on frozen Norwegian trout were ranked on top, followed by smoked from fresh Norwegian trout. Frozen Atlantic salmon, both of Norwegian and Chilean origin, together with frozen Chilean trout were evaluated as the second best group. The poorest ranking in the smoked category was given to products made from fresh Tasmanian salmon and fresh Atlantic salmon. The Norwegian trout scored high on good (natural) red colour, firm texture of the flesh, distinct fishy flavour, a high fat content, including good (fat) marbling, i. e. white stripes in the meat. Rather surprisingly, Norwegian trout for use as sashimi also achieved a good score with the consumers. From what we could expect, fresh Norwegian salmon and fresh Tasmanian salmon were also evaluated well by the consumers. Tasmanian salmon in particular scored much better for use as sashimi than as a <b>smoked</b> <b>product.</b> Conversely, we see that frozen Chilean salmon came out significantly poorer than the six remaining products tested. Preference Mapping indicates that a high fat content, “oily” aftertaste, “sweetness”, “melting texture”/elastic texture, and distinct/visible white stripes (marbling) “can explain” why some products were evaluated more attractive than others...|$|E

Two different smoking treatments were selected in order to compare phenol content and muscle antioxidant activity employing the ferric reducing power (FRAP) method.

40|$|Cannabinoids are {{compounds}} that are naturally present in Cannabis sativa L., which interact with cannabinoid receptors in the nervous system, known as CB 1 and CB 2 receptors. The most abundant and well-known cannabinoid {{that can be}} isolated from cannabis is  9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The structure of this compound specifically allows interaction with the CB 1 and CB 2 receptors, known as cannabimimetic activity. Other compounds have since been produced, inspired by THC, which {{have been designed to}} elicit similar pharmacological responses, and therefore are beneficial as analgesics. These compounds are known as synthetic cannabinoids. Synthetic cannabinoids, while potentially useful as therapeutic treatments for pain, are currently also popular as recreational drugs. Herbal products that contain synthetic cannabinoids are sold as “legal highs,” as few of these compounds are illegal according to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. These products are prepared by combining synthetic cannabinoids and plant material, and are smoked similar to marijuana. As the legality of many synthetic cannabinoids is quickly decreasing, as evidenced by the March 2011 emergency scheduling of five such compounds, it is becoming increasingly likely that these products will soon become popular exhibits to be submitted to controlled substances laboratories for testing. If a previously <b>smoked</b> <b>product</b> is submitted, there could potentially be effects due to the burning, the presence of the plant or paper substrate, and other synthetic cannabinoids that could directly diminish the facility of analysis. The aim of this thesis was to investigate these effects using four synthetic cannabinoids (AM- 2201, JWH- 015, HU- 211, and RCS- 4) and four substrates (tobacco, rolling paper, mint, and rosemary). Results demonstrated diminished peak areas, which are likely due to the introduction of these variables, which include burning the drug of abuse, and spiking the drug of abuse onto various matrices. The trend of lower peak areas further suggests that burning, the presence of plant material, and other cannabinoids potentially all compromise the facility of analyzing synthetic cannabinoid products. The act of burning one synthetic cannabinoid in particular, AM- 2201, appeared to greatly decrease the capability to detect the analyte, as did the application of AM- 2201 to various substrates. Furthermore, the ability to detect AM- 2201 appeared to vary greatly between results obtained from analyzing samples applied to different substrates. Analysis of cannabinoid mixtures demonstrated that GC/MS analysis of different cannabinoids gave various peak areas although the concentrations remained consistent. Peak area ratios of cannabinoid mixtures that were extracted from substrates were found to not differ significantly between the specific substrates studied. This research supports that all of these variables should therefore be considered in regards to analysis of herbal products containing synthetic cannabinoids...|$|E

However, the recent legislation (Regulation EC 835 / 2011) on maximum levels of PAHs in foods did not set limits for milk and dairy products, including smoked cheeses, even if some smoking techniques can cause formation and accumulation of PAHs on food. Among smoked cheese, smoked buffalo mozzarella or "provola" is a typical product with DOP mark, it may be PAH contaminated. During traditional smoking process Mozzarella was exposed to smoke obtained from the incomplete straw or wood shavings combustion in smoking room. Alternatively, the <b>smoked</b> <b>product</b> is obtained by immersing the cheese in the so-called "liquid smoke", a solution obtained through condensation and filtration of smoke. Sometimes, illegal procedures, as corrugated paper or varnished wood combustion, are employed for smoking food production. The authorized materials are wheat straw, wood shavings of fir, beech or alder bark, which are placed in special containers. This thesis project aimed to assess levels and distribution of B(a) P and other three marker PAHs (PAH 4), as suggested by EFSA in the smoked buffalo mozzarella cheese obtained by different smoking techniques usually employed in dairies of Campania. Besides the influence of different techniques, permitted or non by law, on the content of PAHs in mozzarella was evaluated. This research, aimed to study the migration of PAHs from the external surface (rind) of the mozzarella, more exposed to the smoke, into core and so consumer exposure to these contaminants through ingestion of whole mozzarella. For this purpose were analyzed separately out of mozzarella (rind), core and whole product. 50 batches of samples of buffalo mozzarella, each of 16 samples (250 gr), produced according to the specifications established by the Decree (D. Mi. PAF. 2003), in a dairy farm located in the Salerno province (Campania) and with CE mark. Once produced, mozzarella samples were transported to another dairy, where, a mozzarella was not smoked and conceded as blank matrix while groups of three mozzarella were smoked with different techniques such as combustion of cardboard, bark of alder, chips of fir or beech, wheat straw and liquid smoke. The obtained results showed a not PAH contamination in non-smoked mozzarella cheese samples and in the core of smoked ones. About the rind, highest levels were found in sample obtained from cardboard combustion and in particular BaP levels ranged from 110 to 417. 8 µg/kg. However, the levels found in traditional techniques were highest in samples obtained by bark of alder combustion (5. 1 µg/kg – 54. 0 µg/kg), followed by chips of fir or beech combustion (1. 5 µg/kg – 44. 3 µg/kg) and straw (0. 2 µg/kg – 28. 2 µg/kg). Considering the whole products, similar trend was observed. In particular, the use of illegal techniques such as cardboard combustion showed highest BaP (median 8. 3 µg/kg), while in traditional techniques bark of alder showed a median of 2. 8 µg/kg, followed by chips of fir or beech with a median 1. 2 µg/kg and finally, by straw with a median of 0. 4 µg/kg. All sample obtained by immersion in liquid smoke showed not detectable PAH levels both in rind and in whole product. A statistical analysis was carried out in order to evaluate if the time can effect on the PAH formation, and any statistical differences were found. However the use of different materials and techniques can produce a different amount of PAH in smoked food. A statistical analysis showed that the rind can represent a barrier to migration of generated PAH into the core of the products and it so can support the accumulation of these compounds. For this reason it is recommended to remove the rind until the ingestion of this smoked cheese, considering also that our data are always higher than daily intake and intake for person evaluated by EFSA, except for liquid smoke. This suggests that mozzarella subjected to treatment with liquid smoke is preferable to the those smoked with traditional procedures...|$|E
50|$|A smokehouse is a {{building}} where fish or meat is cured with smoke. In a traditional fishing village, a smokehouse was often {{attached to a}} fisherman's cottage. The <b>smoked</b> <b>products</b> might be stored in the building, sometimes {{for a year or}} more. Traditional smokehouses served both as smokers and to store the smoked fish. Fish could be preserved if it was cured with salt and cold smoked for two weeks or longer. Smokehouses were often secured to prevent animals and thieves from accessing the food.|$|R

The intent of this manual is to gather in one reference document current information on Listeria monocytogenes and appropriate measures to control its incidence in <b>smoked</b> seafood <b>products,</b> and to help processors of <b>smoked</b> seafood <b>products</b> evaluate and implement effective controls in their operation.

The smoke detector described in this paper is an adaptation of a mature commercial aircraft design for manned spaceflight. Changes made to the original design include upgrading the materials and electronic to space-qualified parts, and modifying the mechanical design to withstand launch and landing loads. The results of laboratory characterization of the response of the new design to test particles are presented...|$|R
5000|$|A {{common name}} for cold-smoked salmon is lox, of which many {{different}} types are available, usually identified by point of origin (e.g., from Scotland, Norway, Holland, the Pacific, and Nova Scotia, Canada—the latter usually identified as Nova lox or just Nova). Traditionally, lox designates brined rather than smoked salmon, but the linguistic boundary between {{the two types of}} products has become blurred. Gravad lax or gravlax remains the only type that is unmistakably not smoked fish. However, commercial labels still identify most <b>smoked</b> <b>products</b> as [...] "smoked salmon" [...] rather than [...] "lox".|$|R
5000|$|To allow a [...] "reuse" [...] of the tested {{products}} {{the initial}} manufacturer can collaborate under {{a contract with}} [...] "system providers" [...] (or system houses) and delegate/outsource/franchise the production to them. Given that fire and <b>smoke</b> <b>products</b> are covered by AVCP system 1, the system provider has to undergo the Factory Production Control (FPC) and the Continuous surveillance by an Notified Surveillance Body himself. Practically the system provider can avoid to do the initial type testing reusing the classification reports and extended application reports from the original manufacturer.|$|R
50|$|Historically, all {{pyroligneous acid}} products, Wright’s product {{and many other}} condensates have been made as {{byproducts}} of charcoal manufacturing which was of greater value. Chemicals such as methanol, acetic acid and acetone have been isolated from these condensates and sold. But {{with the advent of}} lower cost fossil fuel sources, today these and other wood derived chemicals retain only small niches. It was in 1959 that the era of modern condensed <b>smoke</b> based <b>products</b> began with the establishment of Red Arrow Products Company in Manitowoc Wisconsin. The important distinction marking this era from the past is the production of modern condensates to be used industrially as a replacement for smoking food directly with non-condensed smoke. Today there are many manufacturing locations around the world, most of which pyrolyze wood primarily to generate condensates which are further processed to make hundreds of derivative products. These are now referred to less so as liquid <b>smoke</b> <b>products</b> rather as <b>smoke</b> flavourings, smoke flavors, and natural condensed smokes.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} tobacco {{products}} use patterns of known diabetics and non diabetics. Material and Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study using STEPwise approach among adults using a multistage, stratified, cluster random sample. Data was collected using a questionnaire which included sociodemographics; tobacco products use habits, history of diabetes, biochemical and anthropometric measurements. Results: Of {{the total of}} 4654 subjects {{who participated in the}} study, 1016 (21. 8 %) were ever <b>smoked</b> tobacco <b>products</b> users and 65 (1. 4 %) were ever smokeless tobacco products users. Known Diabetes prevalence was 15. 3 % (712 known diabetics). There {{were no significant differences in}} diabetic status and smokeless tobacco products use for both ever and current use. For <b>smoked</b> <b>products</b> diabetics are fewer in current smokers and more in ex smokers. Diabetics started smoking significantly older, smoked for longer duration and higher intensity than non diabetics. Conclusion: Diabetes appears to be associated with smoked but not smokeless tobacco products use...|$|R

This presentation will show an example of an initial analysis of one CALIPSO segment that is attributed to 9 distinct fires burning on 3 different days. Each fire contributes to a unique horizontal and vertical portion of the aerosol plume identified in the CALIPSO data. We welcome suggestion for improvements from the larger fire, modeling, climate and atmospheric communities...|$|R
