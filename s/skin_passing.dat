40|$|The {{metal strip}} used in roll forming {{has often been}} preprocessed by (tension or roller) {{leveling}} or by skin-pass rolling, and as a consequence, may contain residual stresses. These stresses are not well observed by the tensile test, but could {{have a significant effect}} on the bending and springback behavior. With the advent of improved process design techniques for roll forming, including advanced finite element techniques, the need for precise material property data has become important. The major deformation mode of roll forming is that of bending combined with unloading and reverse bending, and hence property data derived from bend tests could be more relevant than that from tensile testing. This work presents a numerical study on the effect of <b>skin</b> <b>passing</b> on the material behavior of stainless steel strip in pure bending and tension. A two dimensional (2 -D) numerical model was developed using Abaqus Explicit to analyze the affect of <b>skin</b> <b>passing</b> on the residual stress profile across a section for various working conditions. The deformed meshes and their final stress fields were then imported as pre-defined fields into Abaqus Standard, and the post-skin passing material behavior in pure bending was determined. The results show that a residual stress profile is introduced into the steel strip during <b>skin</b> <b>passing,</b> and that its shape and stress level depend on the overall thickness reduction as well as the number of rolling passes used in the <b>skin</b> <b>passing</b> process. The material behavior in bending and the amount of springback changed significantly depending on the skin pass condition...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>skin</b> <b>pass</b> rolling on tensile and microstructural properties of three industrial grade steels was investigated. <b>Skin</b> <b>pass</b> rolling {{was performed on}} a laboratory mill equipped with a device designed to reproduce the effects of sheet tension and with load cells aimed at measuring the main working parameters. Analysis on tensile properties of <b>skin</b> <b>pass</b> rolled samples showed for an ultralow C grade and a low C grade a decreasing trend of the yield strength down to a minimum, followed by progressive rising values with increasing rolling elongation. This trend was related to changes of the tensile curve shape, leading to a transition from discontinuous to continuous yielding. A zinc-coated mild steel grade featured a tensile curve with a knee at transition from elastic to plastic regime. Accordingly, the change in yield strength with increasing <b>skin</b> <b>pass</b> elongation followed a linear trend. Microstructural and crystallographic information supplied by EBSD analyses suggested that the plastic strain induced by <b>skin</b> <b>pass</b> rolling originated a fairly homogeneous deformation field even on grains directly exposed on the strip surface.

40|$|The common {{grades of}} steel used in roll forming are: hot rolled carbon steel, high {{strength}} low alloy and recovery annealed cold rolled sheet. These steels {{are prone to}} ageing and are often <b>skin</b> <b>passed</b> and/or roller leveled to eliminate ageing as it can lead to problems in forming. In roll forming, shape defects such as bow, twist and camber are considered to be related to very small plastic strains in the longitudinal direction and hence knowledge of the material properties in the elastic plastic transition range is necessary if the process is to be modelled accurately. Previous studies with aluminium have indicated that <b>skin</b> <b>pass</b> rolling can lead to residual stresses in the strip. In this work, the study was extended to aged carbon steel and to the effect of roller leveling on both aged material and strip that had been given a light cold rolling to simulate a <b>skin</b> <b>pass</b> treatment. The results suggest that roller leveling reduced the magnitude of residual stresses resulting from <b>skin</b> <b>pass</b> rolling.

40|$|Bending {{and reverse}} bending are the {{dominant}} material deformations in roll forming, and hence property data derived from bend tests {{could be more}} relevant than tensile test data for numerical simulation of a roll forming process. Recent investigations have shown that residual stresses change the material behavior close to the yield in a bending test. So, residual stresses introduced during prior steel processing operations may affect the roll forming process, and therefore {{they need to be}} included in roll forming simulations to achieve improved model accuracy. Measuring the residual stress profile experimentally is time consuming and has limited accuracy while analytical models that are available require detailed information about the pre-processing conditions that is generally not available for roll forming materials. The main goal {{of this study is to}} develop an inverse routine that determines a residual stress profile through the material thickness based on experimental pure bend test data. A numerical model of the <b>skin</b> <b>passing</b> (temper rolling) process is performed to introduce a residual stress profile in DP 780 steel sheet. The skin passed strips are used in a pure bending simulation to record moment-curvature data and this data is then applied in an inverse analysis to predict the residual stress profile in the material.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{motivated}} {{by a desire to}} understand more about the fatigue properties of HRLC and HSLA steels and the manufacturing and metallurgical property variables which influence fatigue response. This knowledge was needed by the steel industry to improve the resistance of hot rolled strip steels to fatigue failure, and by the motor vehicle manufacturing industry to improve methods of design against fatigue failure in components made from these steels. A review of the literature identified a fatigue design methodology, the local strain approach to fatigue design, which was most suited to accurate fatigue life prediction. A vital input to this design method was strain controlled fatigue test data. To provide these data, the fatigue properties of a group of ten steels, representative of the commercially available range of H R L C and HSLA strip steels available in Australia have been characterised in this study. The steel grades chosen were, two low strength steels, XA 1010 and C 1012 W, four Australian HSLA Xtraform steels, and four Japanese steels. Characterisation of fatigue properties was performed using the Ramberg-Osgood cyclic stress-strain relationship, and the Coffin-Manson cyclic strain-life relationship. The fit of these relationships was found to be quite good. However, an improved fit was obtained by using a modification to the traditional relationships proposed by Weng. These relationships also had the advantage of recognising the fatigue limit phenomenon. By characterising of the fatigue properties of the steels, the goal of providing industry with the needed input data for fatigue design, was satisfied. While, other researchers established that a steel grade could be characterised by sampling from a single position in a coil, and from a single heat, the effects of strip thickness, <b>skin</b> <b>passing,</b> and anisotropy of properties on fatigue response were unclear and have consequently been examined in the present study. Thus, integral with the process of characterising the fatigue properties of the steels, was the testing of several variants of each steel, which were chosen to represent various treatments levels of these manufacturing variables. In this way, the effects of these variables on fatigue properties were examined. The test results were arranged into a series of balanced factorial experimental designs to facilitate linear regression statistical analysis. The Ramberg-Osgood relationship was used as the basis of the cyclic stress-strain analysis, and an alternative description to the Coffin-Manson formulation was developed for the cyclic strain-life relationship. A notional (Neuber) stress-life analysis, which compared steels under similar service conditions was also employed. The effect of strip thickness was examined in 3. 2 and 5. 0 mm thickness C 1012 W and XA 1010 steels. The lack of a significant thickness effect in either the cyclic stress-strain or strain-life behaviour in these steels suggested that thickness does not have a large effect on the properties of hot rolled strip steels. Test piece orientation had a significant effect on cyclic stress-strain behaviour. In each case, the cyclic strength of the transverse test pieces w a s higher than that of the longitudinal test pieces. There was no significant effect of orientation on cyclic strain-life behaviour, however, when compared on the basis of notional stress amplitude, the transverse test pieces also had longer lives. While no significant effect of <b>skin</b> <b>passing</b> was observed on cyclic stress-strain behaviour in the Xtraform steels, a significant effect was observed in cyclic strain-life behaviour. The effect was to slightly reduce fatigue lives in the two lower strength grades. However, in the high strength grades, while fatigue lives were reduced by skinpassing at higher stress/strain amplitudes, at low stress/strain amplitudes fatigue life was improved. Consequently, the conjecture that skin-passing is beneficial to fatigue life has been demonstrated only for Xtraform 400, although implied for Xtraform 500. Equivalent Xtraform and Japanese steels were compared on the basis of notional stress-life response, however, no steel w a s clearly superior to its counterpart. Thus this part of the study achieved the goal of developing and applying methods of statistical analysis which could discriminate between the fatigue responses of. similar steels, and provide a systematic analysis of the influence of manufacturing variables on fatigue response. Since uncertainty also existed about the influence of hardness, strength, composition, and microstructure on fatigue response, these effects were examined. The goal achieved {{in this part of the}} study was to develop methods to predict difficult to obtain fatigue properties from readily available measurements such as the non-fatigue variables listed above. These relationships would be of value both in alloy design and in design against fatigue. Relationships with the parameters which define both the Ramberg-Osgood, and W e ng forms of the cyclic stress-strain relationship, including a number of reputedly successful relationships, were examined. None of these potential relationships with the non-fatigue variables, were found to hold. Relationships between 0. 2 % cyclic proof strength and hardness, tensile strength, and proof strength were, however, found. It w a s also established that stress amplitude at 0. 1 % and 0. 4 % plastic strain amplitude could be effectively related to a combination of composition variables and proof strength. This pair of relationships then allowed the prediction of the cyclic stress-strain relationships in the absence of data derived from fatigue tests. Despite the reported relationships between the parameters of the Coffin-Manson form of the cyclic stress-strain relationship and strength, in the present study none of these relationships, nor those with the other available non-fatigue variables, proved to hold. Relationships were, however, found with elastic, plastic and total strain amplitudes at various lives allowing the cyclic strength and cyclic ductility relationships to be estimated. For the fatigue strength line, relationships were found at short and long endurances. At short life, the relationship w a s with tensile strength, while at long life, the relationship was with a combination of composition variables and hardness. Additional relationships were used to identify the locus of the fatigue ductility line. Transition life could be estimated from a relationship with yield strength, and the strain at this life estimated from the fatigue strength relationship. The fatigue ductility relationship could then be estimated either by applying the average value for fatigue ductility exponent, or by estimating the locus of a point at one million cycles, from relationships with total and elastic strain, at this life. This estimation method, while not particularly accurate, w as found to be quite acceptable where no fatigue data were available experimentally. In summary, this study has characterised the fatigue properties of the formable hot rolled strip steels, available in Australia. In addition, methods have been developed, and used to determine the effects of the manufacturing variables, thickness, orientation to rolling direction, and skin-passing, on fatigue performance. Finally, relationships have been developed between fatigue properties and the more readily determined material properties, strength, hardness, composition and microstructure. These relationships provide insight into the best choices for design of fatigue resistant alloys, and allow the prediction of fatigue properties in the absence of fatigue test data...|$|E

Thereafter, the semi-finished part is manufactured to a component by sheet metal forming operations like deep drawing. During such process chains, a strong evolution of the microstructure and the resulting mechanical properties can be observed.

In contrast to hot-rolled metals, the cold-rolled material shows recrystallization by temperature rise. The recrystallization processes are required to adjust the mechanical behaviour of the annealed material. For process optimization, it is essential to understand the combined process of cold-rolling and annealing: i. e. how the microstructure like the grain orientations evolves and also how that influences the mechanical behaviour.
