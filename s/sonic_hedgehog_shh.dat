5|$|The {{respiratory}} tract has a branching structure {{like that of}} a tree. In the embryo this structure is developed in the process of branching morphogenesis, and is generated by the repeated splitting of the tip of the branch. In the development of the lungs (as in some other organs) the epithelium forms branching tubes.The lung has a left-right symmetry and each bud known as a bronchial bud grows out as a tubular epithelium that becomes a bronchus. Each bronchus branches into bronchioles. The branching {{is a result of the}} tip of each tube bifurcating. The branching process forms the bronchi, bronchioles, and ultimately the alveoli. The four genes mostly associated with branching morphogenesis in the lung are the intercellular signalling protein – <b>sonic</b> <b>hedgehog</b> (<b>SHH),</b> fibroblast growth factors FGF10 and FGFR2b, and bone morphogenetic protein BMP4. FGF10 is seen to have the most prominent role. FGF10 is a paracrine signalling molecule needed for epithelial branching, and SHH inhibits FGF10. The development of the alveoli is influenced by a different mechanism whereby continued bifurcation is stopped and the distal tips become dilated to form the alveoli.|$|E
25|$|These {{developmental}} pathways are SC regulators. Both <b>Sonic</b> <b>hedgehog</b> (<b>SHH)</b> and Wnt pathways {{are commonly}} hyperactivated in tumors and {{are necessary to}} sustain tumor growth. However, the Gli transcription factors that are regulated by SHH take their name from gliomas, where they are highly expressed. A degree of crosstalk exists between the two pathways and they are commonly activated together. By contrast, in colon cancer hedgehog signalling appears to antagonise Wnt.|$|E
25|$|Alpha motor neurons {{originate}} in the basal plate, the ventral portion of the neural tube in the developing embryo. <b>Sonic</b> <b>hedgehog</b> (<b>Shh)</b> is secreted by the nearby notochord and other ventral structures (e.g., the floor plate), establishing a gradient of highly concentrated Shh in the basal plate and less concentrated Shh in the alar plate. Under the influence of Shh and other factors, some neurons of the basal plate differentiate into α-MNs.|$|E
50|$|The {{spinal cord}} {{is made from}} part of the neural tube during development. As the neural tube begins to develop, the {{notochord}} begins to secrete a factor known as <b>Sonic</b> <b>hedgehog</b> or <b>SHH.</b> As a result, the floor plate then also begins to secrete SHH, and this will induce the basal plate to develop motor neurons.|$|R
50|$|Knocking out the <b>Sonic</b> <b>hedgehog,</b> or <b>Shh,</b> {{has been}} shown to {{severely}} affect corticogenesis in the genetically modified mice. The ventral and dorsal sides of the cerebrum are affected as Shh expresses the transcription factors to Nkx2 which is important in patterning the cortex. Shh is also important to corticogenesis as it affects cell proliferation and differentiation, helping neuronal progenitor cells in fate determination.|$|R
5000|$|Gamma motor neurons develop {{similarly}} to alpha motor neurons at the beginning. They {{originate in the}} basal plate, which is the ventral portion of the neural tube in the developing embryo. <b>Sonic</b> <b>Hedgehog</b> genes (<b>Shh)</b> {{are an important part}} of the development process that is secreted by the notochord creating gradients of concentrations. After the hedgehog genes, various other molecular markers and transcription factors play a role in differentiating motor neurons into the specific gamma motor neurons.|$|R
25|$|<b>Sonic</b> <b>hedgehog</b> (<b>SHH)</b> is a {{signaling}} molecule that is encoded by {{the same}} gene <b>sonic</b> <b>hedgehog.</b> <b>SHH</b> plays very important role in organogenesis and most importantly craniofacial development. Being that SHH is a signaling molecule it primarily works by diffusion along a concentration gradient affecting cells in different manners. In early tooth development, SHH is released from the primary enamel knot, a signaling center, to provide positional information in both a lateral and planar signaling pattern in tooth development and regulation of tooth cusp growth. SHH in particular is needed for growth of epithelial cervical loops, where the outer and inner epitheliums join and form a reservoir for dental stem cells. After the primary enamel knots are apoptosed, the secondary enamel knots are formed. The secondary enamel knots secrete SHH {{in combination with other}} signaling molecules to thicken the oral ectoderm and begin patterning the complex shapes of the crown of a tooth during differentiation and mineralization. In a knockout gene model, absence of SHH is indicative of holoprosencephaly. However SHH activates downstream molecules of Gli2 & Gli3. Mutant Gli2 and Gli3 embryos have abnormal development of incisors that are arrested at early in tooth development as well as small molars.|$|E
25|$|The <b>sonic</b> <b>hedgehog</b> (<b>SHH)</b> {{signaling}} molecule assumes various {{roles in}} patterning {{the central nervous}} system (CNS) during vertebrate development. One of the most characterized functions of SHH is its role in the induction of the floor plate and diverse ventral cell types within the neural tube. The notochord, a structure derived from the axial mesoderm, produces SHH, which travels extracellularly to the ventral region of the neural tube and instructs those cells to form the floor plate. Another view for floor plate induction hypothesizes that some precursor cells located in the notochord are inserted into the neural plate before its formation, later giving rise to the floor plate.|$|E
25|$|Astrocytes are macroglial {{cells in}} the central nervous system. Astrocytes are derived from {{heterogeneous}} populations of progenitor {{cells in the}} neuroepithelium of the developing central nervous system. There is remarkable similarity between the well known genetic mechanisms that specify the lineage of diverse neuron subtypes and that of macroglial cells. Just as with neuronal cell specification, canonical signaling factors like <b>Sonic</b> <b>hedgehog</b> (<b>SHH),</b> Fibroblast growth factor (FGFs), WNTs and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), provide positional information to developing macroglial cells through morphogen gradients along the dorsal–ventral, anterior–posterior and medial–lateral axes. The resultant patterning along the neuraxis leads to segmentation of the neuroepithelium into progenitor domains (p0, p1 p2, p3 and pMN) for distinct neuron types in the developing spinal cord. On the basis of several studies it is now believed that this model also applies to macroglial cell specification. Studies carried out by Hochstim and colleagues have demonstrated that three distinct populations of astrocytes arise from the p1, p2 and p3 domains. These subtypes of astrocytes can be identified {{on the basis of}} their expression of different transcription factors (PAX6, NKX6.1) and cell surface markers (reelin and SLIT1). The three populations of astrocyte subtypes which have been identified are 1) dorsally located VA1 astrocytes, derived from p1 domain, express PAX6 and reelin 2) ventrally located VA3 astrocytes, derived from p3, express NKX6.1 and SLIT1 and 3) and intermediate white-matter located VA2 astrocyte, derived from the p2 domain, which express PAX6, NKX6.1, reelin and SLIT1. After astrocyte specification has occurred in the developing CNS, it is believed that astrocyte precursors migrate to their final positions within the nervous system before the process of terminal differentiation occurs.|$|E
50|$|The {{functional}} {{development of}} the anterior pituitary involves spatiotemporal regulation of transcription factors expressed in pituitary stem cells and dynamic gradients of local soluble factors. The coordination of the dorsal gradient of pituitary morphogenesis is dependent on neuroectodermal signals from the infundibular bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4). This protein {{is responsible for the}} {{development of the}} initial invagination of the Rathke’s pouch. Other essential proteins necessary for pituitary cell proliferation are Fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8), Wnt4, and Wnt5. Ventral developmental patterning and the expression of transcription factors is influenced by the gradients of BMP2 and <b>sonic</b> <b>hedgehog</b> protein (<b>SHH).</b> These factors are essential for coordinating early patterns of cell proliferation.|$|R
25|$|Of the hh homologues, SHH {{has been}} found to have the most {{critical}} roles in development, acting as a morphogen involved in patterning many systems, including the limb and midline structures in the brain, spinal cord, the thalamus by the zona limitans intrathalamica the lungs, and the teeth. Mutations in the human <b>sonic</b> <b>hedgehog</b> gene, <b>SHH,</b> cause holoprosencephaly type 3 HPE3 {{as a result of the}} loss of the ventral midline. <b>Sonic</b> <b>hedgehog</b> is secreted at the zone of polarizing activity, which is located on the posterior side of a limb bud in an embryo. The <b>sonic</b> <b>hedgehog</b> transcription pathway has also been linked to the formation of specific kinds of cancerous tumors, including the embryonic cerebellar tumor, and medulloblastoma, as well as the progression of Prostate Cancer tumours. For SHH to be expressed in the developing embryo limbs, a morphogen called fibroblast growth factors must be secreted from the apical ectodermal ridge.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{show here}} {{the role of}} retinoic acid {{receptor}} (RAR) β and α signalling in proliferation and differentiation of endogenous adult forebrain neural progenitor cells (NPCs). RARβ activation stimulates <b>Sonic</b> <b>hedgehog</b> signalling (<b>Shh),</b> and induces the proliferation of the NPCs. They can be induced to become Doublecortin (DCX) expressing migrating neuroblasts by RARα signalling, some of which differentiate into cholinergic neurons. The same signalling pathways cause the proliferation of embryonic forebrain NPCs. These cells express glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and are predominantly uni/bipolar, two characteristics of neuronal progenitor cells. We further show that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling, induces {{the expression of the}} retinoic acid degrading enzyme cytochrome P 450 (cyp) 26 a 1, and that one of its products, 4 -oxo-RA, mimics the action of the RARα agonist in the differentiation of the NPCs into cholinergic neurons...|$|R

During the cleavage, a cholesterol molecule is added to the carboxyl end of the N-terminal domain, which is involved in trafficking, secretion and receptor interaction of the ligand. SHH can signal in an autocrine fashion, affecting the cells in which it is produced.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Smoothened (SMO) is {{a member}} of <b>sonic</b> <b>hedgehog</b> {{homology}} (<b>SHH)</b> signaling pathway. It plays a key role as a bridge between patched- 1 (PTCH- 1) and Gli. Aberrant SHH expression can be detected in various malignant tissues, and the expression in pancreatic cancer stem cells is higher apparently. SHH signals are closely associated with self-duplication of cancer stem cells, formation of tumor vessels as well as matrixes. SMO antagonists such as cyclopamine, GDC- 0449 and so on show potential to inhibit activity of SHH signaling, and arrest the growth as well as metastases of tumors. Recently, a few of SMO antagonists have been studied in phase Ⅰ clinical trials and some are in phase Ⅱ, meanwhile, phase Ⅰ or Ⅱ trials of SMO antagonists to treat pancreatic cancer are performed currently. As the classical SMO antagonist, cyclopamine is extracted from a medicinal plant.

40|$|The {{development}} {{and function of}} epithelia depend on the establishment and maintenance of cell-cell adhesion and intercellular junctions, which operate as mechanosensor hubs for the transduction of biochemical signals regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and regeneration. Here, we show that αE-catenin, {{a key component of}} adherens junctions, functions as a positive regulator of pancreatic islet cell lineage differentiation by repressing the <b>sonic</b> <b>hedgehog</b> pathway (<b>SHH).</b> Thus, deletion of αE-catenin in multipotent pancreatic progenitors resulted in (1) loss of adherens junctions, (2) constitutive activation of SHH, (3) decrease in islet cell lineage differentiation, and (4) accumulation of immature Sox 9 + progenitors. Pharmacological blockade of SHH signaling in pancreatic organ cultures and in vivo rescued this defect, allowing αE-catenin-null Sox 9 + pancreatic progenitors to differentiate into endocrine cells.

The <b>Sonic</b> <b>Hedgehog</b> ligand (<b>Shh),</b> absent in the normal pancreas, is highly expressed in pancreatic tumors and is sufficient to induce neoplastic precursor lesions in mouse models. We investigated the mechanism of Shh signaling in PDAC carcinogenesis by genetically ablating the canonical bottleneck of hedgehog signaling, the transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo), in the pancreatic epithelium of PDAC-susceptible mice. We report that multistage development of PDAC tumors is not affected by the deletion of Smo in the pancreas, demonstrating that autocrine Shh–Ptch–Smo signaling is not required in pancreatic ductal cells for PDAC progression. However, the expression of Gli target genes is maintained in Smo-negative ducts, implicating alternative means of regulating Gli transcription in the neoplastic ductal epithelium. In PDAC tumor cells, we find that Gli transcription is decoupled from upstream Shh–Ptch–Smo signaling and is regulated by TGF-β and KRAS, and we show that Gli 1 is required both for survival and for the KRAS-mediated transformed phenotype of cultured PDAC cancer cells...|$|R

Growth factor receptor up-regulation is among the mechanisms underlying BRAF-I resistance of melanoma cells. Here we demonstrate {{for the first time}} that PDGFRα up-regulation causes BRAF-I resistance. PDGFRα inhibition by PDGFRα-specific short hairpin (sh) RNA and by PDGFRα inhibitors restores and increases melanoma cells' sensitivity to BRAF-I in vitro and in vivo. This effect reflects the inhibition of ERK and AKT activation which is associated with BRAF-I resistance of melanoma cells. PDGFRα up-regulation is mediated by <b>Sonic</b> <b>Hedgehog</b> Homolog (<b>Shh)</b> pathway activation which is induced by BRAF-I treatment. Similarly to PDGFRα inhibition, Shh inhibition by LDE 225 restores and increases melanoma cells' sensitivity to BRAF-I.

The clinical relevance of these data is indicated by the association of PDGFRα up-regulation in melanoma matched biopsies of BRAF-I +/- MEK inhibitor treated patients with shorter time to disease progression and less tumor regression. These findings suggest that monitoring patients for early PDGFRα up-regulation will facilitate the identification of those who may benefit from the treatment with BRAF-I in combination with clinically approved PDGFRα or Shh inhibitors...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Advancements in the {{diagnosis}} and prognosis of brain tumor patients, and thus in their survival and quality of life, can be achieved using biomarkers that facilitate improved tumor typing. We introduce and implement a combinatorial metabolic and molecular approach that applies state-of-the-art, high-resolution magic angle spinning (HRMAS) proton (1 H) MRS and gene transcriptome profiling to intact brain tumor biopsies, to identify unique biomarker profiles of brain tumors. Our results show that samples as small as 2 mg can be successfully processed, the HRMAS 1 H MRS procedure does not result in mRNA degradation, and minute mRNA amounts yield high-quality genomic data. The MRS and genomic analyses demonstrate that CNS tumors have altered levels of specific 1 H MRS metabolites that directly correspond to altered expression of Kennedy pathway genes; and exhibit rapid phospholipid turnover, which coincides with upregulation of cell proliferation genes. The data also suggest <b>Sonic</b> <b>Hedgehog</b> pathway (<b>SHH)</b> dysregulation {{may play a role}} in anaplastic ganglioglioma pathogenesis.

40|$|AbstractBackground:Sonic <b>hedgehog</b> (<b>Shh),</b> a {{vertebrate}} homolog of the Drosophila segment polarity gene hedgehog (hh), {{has been}} implicated in patterning of the developing chick limb. Such a role {{is suggested by the}} restricted expression of Shh along the posterior limb bud margin, and by the observation that heterologous cells expressing Shh have limb-polarizing activity resembling that of cells from the polarizing region of the posterior limb bud margin. It has not been demonstrated, however, that the <b>Sonic</b> <b>hedgehog</b> protein (<b>SHH)</b> alone is sufficient for limb patterning. SHH has been shown to undergo autoproteolytic cleavage in vitro, yielding two smaller products. It is of interest, therefore, to determine whether processing of SHH occurs in the developing limb and how such processing influences the function of SHH. Results We demonstrate that SHH is proteolytically processed in developing chick limbs. Grafts of cells expressing SHH protein variants that correspond to individual cleavage products demonstrate that the ability to induce patterned gene expression and to impose morphological pattern upon the limb bud is limited to the amino-terminal product (SHH-N) of SHH proteolytic cleavage. We also demonstrate that bacterially synthesized and purified SHH-N, released from implanted beads, is sufficient for limb-patterning activity. Finally, we show that the endogenous amino-terminal cleavage product is tightly localized to the posterior margin of the limb bud. Conclusion Our data show that, of the two cleavage products resulting from SHH autoproteolysis, SHH-N expressed in grafted heterologous cells or supplied in purified form is sufficient to impose pattern upon the developing limb. Moreover, the restricted localization of the endogenous amino-terminal SHH cleavage product to the posterior border of the chick limb bud makes it unlikely that its patterning activity results from it being distributed in a broad gradient across the antero-posterior axis. More consistent with the observed localization is a model in which the amino-terminal SHH cleavage product exerts its patterning effects by local induction in or near the polarizing region, initiating a cascade of gene expression that ultimately extends across the developing limb...|$|R

Signaling pathways that regulate endocardial cell specification and differentiation are largely unknown and the origin of endocardial progenitors is still being debated. To study pathways that regulate endocardial differentiation in a zebrafish model system, we isolated zebrafish NFATc 1 homolog which is expressed in endocardial but not vascular endothelial cells. We further demonstrate that Hedgehog (Hh) but not VegfA or Notch signaling is required for early endocardial morphogenesis. Pharmacological inhibition of Hh signaling with cyclopamine treatment resulted in nearly complete loss of the endocardial marker expression. Simultaneous knockdown of the two zebrafish <b>sonic</b> <b>hedgehog</b> homologs, <b>shh</b> and twhh or Hh co-receptor smoothened (smo) resulted in similar defects in endocardial morphogenesis. Inhibition of Hh signaling resulted {{in the loss of}} fibronectin (fn 1) expression in the presumptive endocardial progenitors as early as the 10 -somite stage which suggests that Hh signaling is required for the earliest stages of endocardial specification. We further show that the endoderm plays a critical role in migration but not specification or differentiation of the endocardial progenitors while notochord-derived Hh is a likely source for the specification and differentiation signal. Mosaic analysis using cell transplantation shows that Smo function is required cell-autonomously within endocardial progenitor cells.
