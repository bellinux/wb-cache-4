5|$|In April 2010 {{the five}} {{companies}} accused of causing the explosion faced a criminal prosecution {{brought by the}} Health and Safety Executive and the Environment Agency. Two defendants, Total UK and British Pipeline Agency Limited, had already pleaded guilty to offences under the Health and Safety at Work Act. The remaining three, Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd, TAV Engineering Ltd, and Motherwell Control <b>Systems</b> <b>were</b> found guilty in June 2010. TAV Engineering Ltd and Motherwell Control <b>Systems</b> <b>were</b> found guilty of failing to protect their employees.

5|$|Molotov was {{the first}} Soviet ship to carry radar, a Redut-K air warning system, which she used for the entire war. Soviet-designed Mars-1 gunnery radar <b>systems</b> <b>were</b> added by 1944.|$|E
5|$|The civil weight <b>systems</b> <b>were</b> {{generally}} {{very similar}} to the apothecaries' system, and since the libbra (or the libbra sottile, where different <b>systems</b> <b>were</b> in use for light and heavy goods) generally had a suitable weight for an apothecaries' pound it was often used for this purpose. Extreme cases were Rome and Genoa, where the same system was used for everything, including medicine. On the other hand, there were relatively large differences even between two cities in the same state. E.g. Bologna (in the Papal States) had an apothecaries' pound that was less than the local civil pound, and 4% lighter than the pound used in Rome.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} SmarTrip {{features}} {{that were supposed}} to be introduced in 2005 by SmarTrip's creator, Cubic Transportation <b>Systems,</b> <b>were</b> not fully implemented until 2012. Initially, riders could only add value to a SmarTrip card at Metrorail stations or by using cash while boarding a Metrobus. In November 2008, after years of delays, WMATA announced that customers would have the ability to add funds to their SmarTrip cards online by September 2009, but that deadline was missed. WMATA did launch SmarTrip's online reload feature in September 2011. WMATA allowed customers to load a seven-day unlimited Metrorail pass to their SmarTrip cards in April 2012.|$|E
5|$|According to Gartner Inc., {{the total}} number of Itanium servers (not processors) sold by all vendors in 2007, was about 55,000. (It is unclear whether {{clustered}} servers counted as a single server or not.) This compares with 417,000 RISC servers (spread across all RISC vendors) and 8.4 million x86 servers. IDC reports that a total of 184,000 Itanium-based <b>systems</b> <b>were</b> sold from 2001 through 2007.

5|$|After World War II, various optical <b>systems</b> <b>were</b> tested. Kohler {{generators}} {{were installed}} in 1949 {{along with the}} stationary electric light system. A new rotating light system (EMV-3) was installed in 1963, making the lighthouse fully automated. It was in use until 1982, when an experimental EMV-930M system (made in Ukraine) was installed. The rotation mechanism of the optical system is a novel solution– there are no electric motors; it uses a revolving magnetic field instead. The optics brought a six to eight hundredfold increase to {{the efficiency of the}} light radiated by a 1kW quartz lamp. The same light system is still in use.|$|E

5|$|Akagi {{was reduced}} to second-class reserve status on 1 December 1931 in {{preparation}} for a short refit in which her arresting gear was replaced and her radio and ventilation <b>systems</b> <b>were</b> overhauled and improved. After completion of the refit, Akagi became a first-class reserve ship in December 1932. On 25 April 1933, she resumed active service and joined the Second Carrier Division and participated in that year's Special Fleet Maneuvers.|$|E
5|$|Although ship-fired {{missiles}} {{can provide}} support for shore-based units, they are susceptible to interception by anti-missile systems such as the Aegis Combat System and MIM-104 Patriot system developed by the United States and used by NATO nations. These <b>systems</b> <b>were</b> designed to track and destroy both artillery shells and missiles. The first widely reported instances of such systems working came in 1991 when the US Patriot and Royal Navy Sea Dart missile system successfully intercepted and destroyed Iraqi Scud and Silkworm missiles.|$|E
5|$|Another {{major fire}} {{occurred}} on May 11, 1969 in building 776/777 (the Plutonium Processing Facility), again starting due to spontaneous combustion of plutonium shavings in a glove box. Fire fighters again resorted to fighting {{the fire with}} water after dry extinguishers proved ineffective. Despite recommendations after the 1957 fire, suppression <b>systems</b> <b>were</b> not built into the glove boxes.|$|E
50|$|Permanent <b>systems</b> <b>are</b> {{installed}} on nearly all U.S. military airfields operating fighter or jet trainer aircraft.

50|$|Two gun {{units were}} coupled to the M5 gun {{director}} using the M1 remote control <b>system.</b> The <b>system</b> <b>was</b> {{powered by the}} M5 generating unit. If the remote <b>system</b> <b>was</b> inoperative the M5 sighting <b>system</b> <b>was</b> used.|$|R
5|$|By the Korean War, {{jet engines}} had {{replaced}} propellers on aircraft, which severely limited {{the ability of}} the 20 mm and 40 mm AA batteries and their gun systems to track and shoot down enemy planes. Consequently, the AA guns and their associated fire-control <b>systems</b> <b>were</b> removed when reactivated. New Jersey received this treatment in 1967, and the others followed in their 1980s modernizations. In the 1980s, each ship also received a quartet of Phalanx Close in Weapon System (CIWS) mounts which made use of a radar system to locate incoming enemy projectiles and destroy them with a 20mm Gatling gun before they could strike the ship.|$|E
5|$|By {{the turn}} of the century, the city's {{population}} had grown to 728, and social organizations began to establish themselves in Marysville, including a lodge of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and a Crystal Lodge of the Free and Accepted Masons. The first city hall was opened in late 1901, at a cost of $2,000; the building also housed the city's fire department, and later the first public library in 1907. Electrical and water supply <b>systems</b> <b>were</b> both inaugurated in 1906, alongside the construction of a high school building.|$|E
5|$|Cheyenne {{prototype}} #6 (s/n 66-8831) began conducting weapons {{testing at}} Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona, demonstrating {{the ability for}} the gunner and pilot to accurately fire on separate targets on each side on the helicopter. Towards the end of 1970, the Army funded work on TOW missile guidance and night sighting systems. Prototypes #6 and #9 were also tested and evaluated at Yuma Proving Ground from 30 January to 23 December 1971, to determine if stability and control <b>systems</b> <b>were</b> sufficient. Deficiencies were identified in lateral directional stability, uncommanded motion during maneuvering, high vibration, and poor directional control during sidewards flying.|$|E

50|$|Having this shared heritage, the two <b>systems</b> <b>are</b> quite similar, {{but there}} are differences. The US {{customary}} <b>system</b> <b>is</b> based on English systems of the 18th century, while the Imperial <b>system</b> <b>was</b> defined in 1824, after American independence.|$|R
5|$|Construction at the {{two sites}} started between 1962 and 1963 with {{improvements}} in the TsSO-P test model being fed back into the deployed units. They gained an M-4 2-M computer with semiconductors, although {{the rest of the}} radar used Vacuum tubes. The radar <b>systems</b> <b>were</b> completed in late 1966 with the fourth Dnestr at Balkhash being used for testing. In 1968 the Dnepropetrovsk Sputnik target satellite, DS-P1-Yu, was used to test the ability of the system.|$|E
5|$|During the mid 1990s, Ramiz Sadiku was docked {{for a major}} {{overhaul}} and reconstruction. However, {{due to the lack}} of funds the work was never completed and the boat was decommissioned and eventually sold for scrap. The boat's superstructure, propulsion, sensors and weapon <b>systems</b> <b>were</b> dismantled, after which the new owner moved the boat to an underground naval dock on the Luštica peninsula. The boat remained there for several years, before its deteriorating condition caused it to sink inside the dock. The wreck was raised in 2014 and towed to Zelenika where it was broken up to smaller segments which were then transported to the Nikšić steel factory.|$|E
