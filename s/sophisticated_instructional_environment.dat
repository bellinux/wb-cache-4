Computer-assisted instruction evolves toward intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) by passing three tests of intelligence. First, the subject matter, or domain, must be "known" to the computer system well enough for this embedded expert to draw inferences or solve problems in the domain. Second, the system {{must be able to}} deduce a learner's approximation of that knowledge. Third, the tutorial strategy or pedagogy must be intelligent in that the "instructor in the box" can implement strategies to reduce the difference between expert and student performance. At the foundation of ITSs, therefore, one finds three special kinds of knoweldge and problem-solving expertise programmed in a <b>sophisticated</b> <b>instructional</b> <b>environment.</b> This book examines these knowledge foundations - expert knoweldge, student diagnostic knowledge, and the instructional or curricular knowledge - in detail. This book also describes (a) how these kinds of knowledge are embodied in computer-assisted instructional environments; (b) how these systems accrue the advantages of advanced computer interface technologies; (c) how ITSs will emerge in the real world of complex problem solving; and finally (d) how researchers must learn to evaluate the effectiveness and overall quality of these dynamic systems in a world where one day machine tutoring will be taken for granted. The purpose of this chapter is to introduce the major research issues and development themes that the primary authors - John Anderson, Kurt VanLehn, Henry Halff, Richard Burton, James Miller, William Johnson, David Littman, and Elliott Soloway - explore and amplify.

This study conceptualizes the instructional encoding conditions that potentially effect and/or affect the encounters of predisposed learners/decoders involved in perceiving, differentiating, recalling, manipulating, and/or using knowledge. A path model of encoding conditions that prefigure learning from instruction includes the following: learner processes, task requirements, resource attributes, teacher considerations, and intellectual, physical, emotional, and sociocultural modalities. The encoding conditions consist of an <b>instructional</b> <b>environment</b> that is composed of four variables: the teacher, the learner, the task and the resources. It is maintained that if learning (achievement, process) is the ultimate product of the <b>instructional</b> <b>environment,</b> then an effective (natural science) and affective (social science) <b>instructional</b> <b>environment</b> is the product of the interactions of the four variables.

Using the CAT 0 tools, law stu-dents analyze a legal problem, frame queries of CATO’S database of legal cases, and judge how rele-vant the retrieved cases are to their developing argu-ment or theory.

40|$|Reforming legal higher {{education}} involves organisational aspects {{as well as}} aspects on learning and instruction. We focus on the learning and instruction part of education and also make a restriction for institutionalized learning and instruction, that is, learning and instruction that takes place {{within the context of}} a school or university. Instruction should aim at enhancing effective and efficient learning, that is the acquisition of knowledge and skills in the field or subject area at stake. Instruction involves presentation of learning materials and presentation of support in processing these materials. Technology can be used in instruction to support both the presentation and the processing of learning materials. The HYPATIA research program describes a methodology for principled and structured design of electronic materials for learning the law effectively and efficiently. In this paper the focus is on describing this methodology for the principled and structured design of materials for learning the law effectively and efficiently.

40|$|Three key {{aspects of}} the school {{environment}} are crucial for the prevention and management of social, emotional, and behavioural difficulties (SEBD) in schools. These include an adequate <b>instructional</b> <b>environment,</b> a supportive social-emotional climate, and a systematic process of identification and intervention. This paper addresses these critical aspects by presenting results from two studies in primary education in The Netherlands. According to teachers, one in six pupils in mainstream primary schools exhibits some kind of SEBD. Severe cases of aggressive behaviour or ADHD present the greatest difficulties for teachers. The focus in mainstream schools is on the provision of a supportive social-emotional environment and on the identification of SEBD, with little attention to an adequate <b>instructional</b> <b>environment</b> or consistent interventions. This paper describes a systematic approach to the prevention and early intervention of SEBD which will address this issue. peer-reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Teaching is {{a complex}} and {{fundamentally}} collaborative process, through which knowledge and skills are acquired {{as a result of}} repeated interactions between teachers and students. The effectiveness of these interactions depends on both the <b>instructional</b> <b>environment</b> created by the teacher {{and the extent to which}} students engage with that environment. The current study combines these dimensions of teaching to (a) evaluate the construct validity of two instruments: the Middle School Intervention Project Classroom Observation Tool (MSIP-COT) and the Student Engagement Instrument (SEI), and (b) test the extent to which these measures predict differences in reading proficiency for middle school students who struggle with reading. Observation, engagement, and reading achievement data were collected for a sample of 1, 446 reading intervention students from 25 middle schools in the Pacific Northwest participating in an evaluation of state and local education programs. Instruments were evaluated by fitting a series of measurement models to the observation and engagement data. The results of the best fitting models were then used in a cross-classified, multilevel structural equation model to predict differences in reading proficiency and evaluate the direct and mediational effects of engagement and <b>instructional</b> <b>environment.</b> Results provided reasonably strong evidence for both measures as indicators of their respective constructs but limited support for the direct and mediational effects of observed <b>instructional</b> <b>environment</b> and self-reported student engagement on reading proficiency for these students.

40|$|To provide {{significant}} {{learning experiences}} for undergraduate engineering students, educators have {{resources in the}} literature, colleagues, and personal experiences to supplement their course design process. This study aims to capture the stories of graduate students who are looking back at their undergraduate experiences and describing the features that made a specific course particularly impactful. Specifically, {{the goal of this}} study was to explore the educational philosophies enacted in the most impactful undergraduate classrooms, according to graduate students’ perceptions, for the purpose of designing effective <b>instructional</b> <b>environments.</b> To capture the characteristics of the impactful courses, graduate engineering students from the Georgia Institute of Technology participated in an online survey. Participants reflected on the <b>instructional</b> <b>environment</b> that best described their most impactful undergraduate learning experience. Open-ended questions provided students with the opportunity to further justify or clarify their responses. The analysis indicated that students’ most impactful classes were required, in-major, non-design courses. Furthermore, these courses were characteristic of instructor-centered philosophies, including essentialism and perennialism. However, when students did reflect on out-of-major courses, they tended to recount a wider variety of enacted philosophies, including more learner-centered ones (progressivism, social reconstructionism, and existentialism). Qualitative analysis of students’ descriptions of their most impactful classes revealed five major factors that contribute to the success of a course: course components, the instructor, the student experience, the subject matter, and other stakeholders (e. g., peers and teaching assistants). Exploring these impactful classroom experiences highlights connections between the literature and student experiences as well as supports new faculty who are considering the type of <b>instructional</b> <b>environments</b> they will strive to create in their own courses...|$|R
