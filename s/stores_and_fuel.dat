2500|$|Less {{than three}} years earlier, in August 1968, a sapper unit {{attacked}} the MACV-SOG compound outside Da Nang. The compound, home to command and control elements of SOG's Command and Control North (CCN), was considered a high-security facility manned by elite troops, but during the attack [...] "a dozen Green Berets were killed, along with {{an unknown number of}} their Nung mercenaries." [...] Coincidentally, one of the officers present at FSB Mary Ann had also been at the CCN compound when it was attacked. Sappers also attacked elements of the 101st Airborne Division (Airmobile) in March 1971 at the old Khe Sanh Combat Base. Opened to support ARVN operations in Laos during Operation Lam Son 719, Khe Sanh contained a number of fuel storage locations and maintenance facilities for helicopters. The sappers took losses, but reached the runway and demolished both ammunition <b>stores</b> <b>and</b> <b>fuel</b> tanks. Similar attacks took place against FSB Illingham established by the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) and FSB Crooks established by the 25th Infantry Division at various times during the conflict. What happened at FSB Mary Ann was not unique. What makes FSB Mary Ann unique is the attention it has received.|$|E
2500|$|The Crusader {{was not an}} easy {{aircraft}} to fly, and was often unforgiving in carrier landings, where it suffered from poor recovery from high sink rates, and the poorly designed, castoring nose undercarriage made it hard to steer on the deck. Safe landings required the carriers to steam at full speed to lower the relative landing speed for Crusader pilots. The stacks of the oil-burning carriers on which the Crusader served belched thick black smoke, sometimes obscuring the flight deck, forcing the Crusader's pilot to rely on the landing signal officer's radioed instructions. [...] It earned a reputation as an [...] "ensign eliminator" [...] during its early service introduction. The nozzle and air intake were so low when the aircraft was on the ground or the flight deck that the crews called the aircraft [...] "the Gator". Not surprisingly, the Crusader's mishap rate was relatively high compared to its contemporaries, the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk and the F-4 Phantom II. However, the aircraft did possess some amazing capabilities, as proved when several Crusader pilots took off with the wings folded. One of these episodes took place on 23 August 1960; a Crusader with the wings folded took off from Napoli Capodichino in full afterburner, climbed to [...] and then returned to land successfully. The pilot, absentminded but evidently a good [...] "stick man," [...] complained that the control forces were higher than normal. The Crusader was capable of flying in this state, though the pilot would be required to reduce aircraft weight by ejecting <b>stores</b> <b>and</b> <b>fuel</b> before landing. In all, 1,261 Crusaders were built. By the time it was withdrawn from the fleet, 1,106 had been involved in mishaps. Only a handful of them were lost to enemy fire in Vietnam.|$|E

50|$|After {{arriving}} at Pearl Harbor in mid-August, the dock landing ship received a badly needed hull cleaning and other voyage repairs. Following amphibious exercises off Maui {{in the first}} week of September, Belle Grove embarked 20 LCMs, heavy equipment, and Army troops, before sailing on 15 September with TransDiv 28. She paused at Eniwetok from 25 to 28 September to replenish <b>stores</b> <b>and</b> <b>fuel</b> before getting underway for the Admiralties. Arriving at Seeadler Harbor on 3 October, the ship again replenished <b>stores</b> <b>and</b> <b>fuel</b> while both crew and troops went ashore for exercise and recreation. Underway again on the 14th, she set a course for the Philippines.|$|E

50|$|Most of {{the units}} of Armee OstpreuÃŸen {{were little more than}} remnants, and the entire {{formation}} was very poorly supplied.

50|$|After {{many years}} of legal battles, {{activism}} by local people against neighborhood truck traffic, and stalling by Matty Moroun, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) took over the I-75/I-96 on-ramp project and opened the ramps in September 2012 after a six-month construction period. One possible motive for the Gateway Project delays is Moroun's desire to route traffic past his lucrative duty-free <b>store</b> <b>and</b> <b>fuel</b> pumps, {{one of only two}} border locations to sell untaxed fuel (the other is International Falls, Minnesota). Critics of the duty-free fuel operation object that sixty cents from each U.S. gallon goes not to paving Michigan's underfunded highways but instead directly to Matty Moroun.|$|R

Rather than taking on <b>stores</b> <b>and</b> <b>fuel</b> and proceeding as had been planned, the frigate and its Merlin helicopter conducted a patrol of Gibraltar waters as a message.|$|E

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of hydrogen based PV power systems for stand-alone applications {{has been studied}} {{and the performance of}} these systems has been compared to conventional systems.

According to the qualitative analysis, the PV-FC-H 2 system is most feasible for small applications under 1 kW which operates around the year, while the self- sufficient PV-H 2 system seems to be most feasible for applications which locate far away services. ...|$|R
