25|$|Routes {{were often}} {{purposely}} indirect to confuse pursuers. Most escapes were by individuals or small groups; occasionally, there were mass escapes, such {{as with the}} Pearl incident. The journey was often considered particularly difficult and dangerous for women or children. Children were <b>sometimes</b> <b>hard</b> to keep quiet or were unable {{to keep up with}} a group. In addition, enslaved women were rarely allowed to leave the plantation, making it harder for them to escape in the same ways that men could. Although escaping was harder for women, some women were successful. One of the most famous and successful conductors (people who secretly traveled into slave states to rescue those seeking freedom) was Harriet Tubman, an escaped slave woman.|$|E

25|$|Assibilation of velars {{in certain}} phonetic environments {{is a common}} {{phenomenon}} in language development (compare, for example, the initial sounds in French cent and Spanish ciento, which are fricatives even though they derive from Latin /k/). Consequently, it is <b>sometimes</b> <b>hard</b> to establish firmly the languages {{that were part of}} the original satem diffusion and the ones affected by secondary assibilation later. While extensive documentation of Latin and Old Swedish, for example, shows that the assibilation found in French and Swedish were later developments, there are not enough records of Dacian and Thracian to settle conclusively when their satem-like features originated. Extensive lexical borrowing, such as Armenian from Iranian, may also add to the difficulty. The status of Armenian as a satem language as opposed to a centum language with secondary assibilation rests on the evidence of a very few words.|$|E
25|$|Statement {{measures}} tend {{to comprise}} more words, and hence consume more research instrument space, than lexical measures. Respondents are asked {{the extent to}} which they, for example, Talk to a lot of different people at parties or Often feel uncomfortable around others. While some statement-based measures of extraversion/introversion have similarly acceptable psychometric properties in North American populations to lexical measures, their generally emic development makes them less suited to use in other populations. For example, statements asking about talkativeness in parties are hard to answer meaningfully by those who do not attend parties, as Americans are assumed to do. Moreover, the sometimes colloquial North American language of statements makes them less suited to use outside America. For instance, statements like Keep in the background and Know how to captivate people are <b>sometimes</b> <b>hard</b> for non-native English-speakers to understand except in a literal sense.|$|E
500|$|The stones, {{as smooth}} as {{polished}} marble, were laid without mortar with very tight joints that are <b>sometimes</b> <b>hard</b> to find. The blocks were held together by mortise and tenon joints in some cases, while in others they used dovetails and gravity.

Henri Mouhot noted that most of the blocks had holes [...] in diameter and [...] deep, with more holes on the larger blocks. Some scholars have suggested that these were used to join them together with iron rods, but others claim they were used to hold temporary pegs to help manoeuvre them into place.|$|E

Salon magazine's Laura Miller found {{the first half of}} the book lacking in [...] "shape or coherence, the meaning of this or that detail unclear and the timeline occasionally muddled", but was more impressed with the discussion of the disaster aftermath in the second half.

500|$|When {{returning}} to the fundamental and original game concept—pairing tiles as multiples of three—the developers felt their experiments informed their final game development decisions. The theme of individual tile personalities extended to the final version, as tiles have faces and express emotions when paired. For example, the 384 tile has a pirate personality with a large tooth and a pirate eyepatch. Wohlwend {{has said that the}} number tiles grow in character with their size. The idea for character faces beneath the cards remained from previous theme iterations, and the character voices were provided by indie game developers. Of the development process, Wohlwend called it [...] "tough and frustrating and <b>sometimes</b> <b>hard</b> {{to see if it was}} worth it".

[...] Other descriptions of The Paperboys have described a fusion of Celtic folk with Bluegrass, Mexican, Eastern European, African, zydeco, soul and country influences.

500|$|Giving {{the album}} {{a rating of}} three-out-of-five-stars, Rob Sheffield wrote for Rolling Stone that the album [...] "has a rushed feel – a likable but low-personality version of her {{familiar}} bubble-pop solo mode".

He also noted that, [...] "By pursuing the twin inclinations to spill her heart while pushing musically forward, Stefani often mangles the mood." [...] However, Erlewine noted that despite the [...] "moments of emotional bloodletting or thirsty appeals {{to the top of the}} charts," [...] the album [...] "manages to be as fleet, giddy, and charming as Gwen Stefani ever is". Patrick Ryan of USA Today felt that [...] "espite the album title and Stefani's refreshingly candid press tour, it's <b>sometimes</b> <b>hard</b> to believe this is what her truth actually sounds like. But even if she's not being totally honest here, it's still more so than many of her pop peers." [...] Jillian Mapes of Pitchfork Media criticized the songs she perceived were tailor-made for Top 40 radio, calling them [...] "unremarkable" [...] saying they [...] "fail to match the unique specificity of her early solo hits". But she praised [...] "the ones in which she is audibly upset—sometimes pissed off, sometimes sad, but best-case scenario, both. [...] t's the fleeting moments like this—where she reminds us why we used to love her—that redeem 'This Is What the Truth Feels Like'." [...] In a mixed review, Theon Weber of Spin commented, [...] "n creating a schism between her punkish pep and her new-wave nostalgia, it leaves the former stranded and the latter generic." [...] Kate Hutchinson of The Guardian gave the album a rating of 2 out of 5 stars feeling the album to be [...] "calculated" [...] and a [...] "little more than careerist chart fodder".|$|E

2500|$|The many-worlds {{interpretation}} shares many similarities with later, other [...] "post-Everett" [...] {{interpretations of}} quantum mechanics which also use decoherence to explain the process of measurement or wavefunction collapse.
