About 20 colonies, which gave an intense signal upon hybridisation with whole B. suis genomic DNA as a probe, were selected. Because of {{the high degree of}} DNA homology between B. suis and Brucella abortus, a short probe was chosen as it would more likely give species specificity.

For each product, gingival tissue and the respective peripheral blood were compared. The TCR repertoire identified in the PBMC in general overlapped with that of the gingival tissue. However, Vβ 6 appeared to be over-expressed in the gingival tissues compared with the PBMC, but Vβ 16 appeared to be under-expressed in the gingival tissues.

To gain functional insights, we have to construct many kinds of expression vectors. DNA recombination based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and digestion followed by ligation is the preferred method for vector construction. However, this existing pattern is intrinsically limited by the selection of restriction endonuclease, prompting researchers to use commercial suppliers rather than amplifying genes themselves. Moreover, this method would introduce additional bases into the PCR products, which may be undesired for the construction of epitope expressing plasmid. A PCR-based gene synthesis method, referred to as competitive priming PCR (CP-PCR), is described here to efficiently assemble the plasmid expressing fusion protein of fibrinogen alpha chain and binding domain of galactose transcription factor. A pair of competitive <b>sense</b> <b>primers</b> were designed for the same target sequence. With the presence of antisense primer, PCR amplification of target sequence was performed in the same one system. The PCR product was underwent single digestion by using PstI, followed by ligation with the vector pCMV-BD linearized with EcoRIand PstI. The reconstructed plasmid was validated by sequencing and the fusion protein was affirmed by western blot. CP-PCR combines the superior convenience and precision of PCR. Moreover, it is perfectly capable of generating nearly all kinds of cohesive terminuses, which are ready to recombination in the presence of single digestion or {{even in the absence of}} digestion. We demonstrate, by using CP-PCR, the feasibility of directed cloning interested sequence only in the requirement of single digestion or even in the absence of digestion. Competitive priming PCR is demonstrated with convenience and precision equivalent to the traditional method. More than that, "seamless" DNA recombination may be achieved by this novel strategy...|$|R

Here we present an allele-specific primer amplification (ASPA) method to determine the Rh E and Rh e genotypes. In one polymerase chain reaction, the <b>sense</b> <b>primer</b> had a 3 '-end nucleotide specific for the cytosine at position 676 of the Rh E allele. In another reaction, a <b>sense</b> <b>primer</b> was used with a 3 '-end nucleotide specific for the guanine at position 676 of the Rh e allele and the Rh D gene, whereas the antisense primer had a 3 '-end nucleotide specific for the adenine at position 787 of the Rh CcEe gene.

40|$|Aptamers are ssDNA or RNA {{that binds}} to {{wide variety of}} target {{molecules}} with high affinity and specificity producedby systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). Compared to RNA aptamer, DNA aptamer is muchmore stable, favourable {{to be used in}} many applications. The most critical step in DNA SELEX experiment is the conversion ofdsDNA to ssDNA. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop an economic and efficient approach of generating ssDNA byusing asymmetric PCR. Our results showed that primer ratio (sense primer:antisense primer) of 20 : 1 and <b>sense</b> <b>primer</b> amountof 10 to 100 pmol, up to 20 PCR cycles using 20 ng of initial template, in combination with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis,were the optimal conditions for generating good quality and quantity of ssDNA.

30|$|Total RNA was {{extracted}} using TRizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), or RNeasy micro kit (Qiagen, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). cDNA for PCR templates {{was prepared}} by reverse transcription of total RNA (100 ng) using Taqman Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Real-time PCR {{was performed on}} a 7700 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) using Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix Reagents (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). SDF- 1 real-time PCR primers were designed and purchased from Sigma: <b>sense</b> <b>primer</b> 5 ′-AGC-CAA-CGT-CAA-GCA-TCT-CAA- 3 ′; antisense primer 5 ′-AAT-CCA-CTT-TAG-CTT-CGG-GTC-AA- 3 ′. 36 B 4 primer sequences have been described previously (Quan et al., 2001). The target gene expression levels were determined by relative quantification using the comparative CT method, also known as 2 -∆∆CT method (comparative 2 –[delta][delta]Ct method). Target gene mRNA expression levels were normalized to the housekeeping gene 36 B 4 (internal control for quantification), and expressed as a fold change of 36 B 4.|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 4, 131 {{expressed}} sequence tags (ESTs) {{were selected from}} wheat EST database ([URL] to identify genic regions differing at structural and functional level between durum wheat (tetraploid genome, AABB) and bread wheat (hexaploid genome, AABBDD) cultivars in response to salt stress. Selected ESTs from salt stressed Triticum aestivum cDNA libraries (922 seedling, 2055 root, 1154 sheat ESTs) were used for construction of contig tags.

40|$|Potato virus X (PVX) {{is among}} top ten most {{economically}} damaging plant viruses {{in the world}} and its increasing incidence is getting an alarming situation in potato crop of Pakistan. During two consecutive years (2010 - 11 and 2011 - 12), the incidence of PVX was recorded in potato fields at Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Faisalabad and Sahiwal. The samples were collected and subjected to Double Antibody Sandwiched (DAS) Enzyme Linked Immunosorbant Assay (ELISA) and average incidence of PVX was determined about 16. 86 % (OD 405 nm 1. 38) during 2010 - 11 and 27. 10 % (OD 405 nm 0. 479) in 2011 - 12. The infectivity of the virus was assayed through mechanical inoculation on Nicotiana tabacum cv. Samsun, N. rustica, Datura stramonium, Chenopodium sp.

40|$|Private school {{law is a}} {{relatively}} new phenomenon in legal research. This article <b>senses</b> as a <b>primer</b> in case law for private schools, reviewing the most significant decisions of the past 30 years and articulating several important distinctions for Catholic educators. After examining the foundational cases, the author concludes with a look at several hot topics that educators are fac-ing in the courts. Private school law, in particular as il applies to Catholic schools, is a legalteenager ready to come of age. This article will examine the last 30 years or so of private education law applicable to Catholic education, especially Catholic schools. The primary emphasis will be on those early cases which provide the foundation for the interpretation of law today. SELECT CASES The law relating to public schools has been in an almost constant state of development since 1960, but there were relatively few private school cases prior to the 1980 s. Private school cases increase each year, but there is a marked judicial reluctance to interfere in cases that may involve religiou...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple and}} rapid method for the {{molecular}} detection of beta-globin structural mutations is described using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of reticulocyte mRNA and direct sequencing of the product. The amplified segment (employing a <b>sense</b> <b>primer</b> 5 '-ATTTGCTTCTGACACAACTGT- 3 ', located at position + 1 {{with respect to}} the Cap site and an antisense primer 5 '-TCCAGATGCTCAAGGCCCTTC- 3 ', located at position + 1772 {{with respect to the}} Cap site) encompasses the cDNA sequence including the three globin exons. Employing this method we were able to characterize two hemoglobin structural variants: Hb S (beta 6 (A 3) Glu-Val: GAG-GTG) and Hb Porto Alegre (beta 9 (A 6) Ser-Cys: TCT-TGT). The approach described in this paper should be very useful to detect hemoglobin structural variants because the RNA extraction is simple, rapid and does not require cesium chloride, guanidinium and proteinase K. In addition, the direct sequencing of the RT-PCR product permits the screening of the entire globin genes with only two reactions...|$|E
30|$|Following {{performing}} the PCR, an electrophoresis on agarose gel {{was carried out}} as quality control to verify {{the purity of the}} PCR products. Genomic DNA from the subjects was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) following the protocol previously published [9]. The primers used for amplification were as follows [8]: <b>sense</b> <b>primer</b> 5 ′-ACACATACTGGGCATGTGGC- 3 ′ (1455 – 1474); antisense primer 5 ′-AAA TCCCATCAA TGA ACAACTGGTATGATTTCCAC- 3 ′ (1807 – 1841). Using the primers and the missense polymorphism (rs 1049434) described by Cupeiro et al. [9], we searched the sequence on gene bank. Through the Neb Cutter tool ([URL] we individuated the restriction enzyme BccI that allows to discriminate {{the presence or absence of}} missense polymorphism A 1470 T. This enzyme recognizes the sequence 3 ′-GGTAG- 5 ′ and produces three fragments in the mutate sequence (TT: 14, 171, and 202  bp), whilst only two fragments (AA: 14 and 373  bp) are generated in the wild sequence. Heterozigotes AT were individuated by four fragments: 14, 171, 202, and 373  bp.|$|E
40|$|Vertebrate gap {{junctions}} are aggregates of transmembrane channels {{which are}} composed of connexin (Cx) proteins encoded by at least fourteen distinct genes in mammals. Since the same Cx type can be expressed in different tissues {{and more than one}} Cx type can be expressed by the same cell, the thorough identification of which connexin is in which cell type and how connexin expression changes after experimental manipulation has become quite laborious. Here we describe an efficient, rapid and simple method by which connexin type(s) can be identified in mammalian tissue and cultured cells using endonuclease cleavage of RT-PCR products generated from "multi primers" (<b>sense</b> <b>primer,</b> degenerate oligonucleotide corresponding to a region of the first extracellular domain; antisense primer, degenerate oligonucleotide complementary to the second extracellular domain) that amplify the cytoplasmic loop regions of all known connexins except Cx 36. In addition, we provide sequence information on RT-PCR primers used in our laboratory to screen individual connexins and predictions of extension of the "multi primer" method to several human connexins...|$|E
40|$|Complementary DNAs were {{synthesized}} {{from the}} envelope protein genes of two isolates of dengue virus (TH- 36 and TH-Sman, previously suggested as possible dengue virus type 5 and dengue virus type 6 respectively) and amplified by the {{polymerase chain reaction}} using <b>sense</b> and antisense <b>primers</b> designed from conserved dengue virus gene sequences. The amplified cDNA clones were sequenced in both directions by double-stranded dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Alignment with published dengue virus sequences enabled us to assign these viruses accurately to classified serotypes, confirming that TH- 36 and TH-Sman are strains of dengue virus type 2 and dengue virus type 1 respectively. Amino acid changes between the proteins encoded by these two isolates and strains of their respective serotypes {{may account for the}} significant antigenic differences observed during previous serological typing of these viruses. Moreover, sequence alignment of flavivirus envelope proteins revealed a hypervariable region, within which members of the dengue and tick-borne virus antigenic complexes show unique peptide sequences. This type-specific hypervariable domain may be useful as a genetic marker for typing dengue and tick-borne flaviviruses. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of peptide motifs within the proteins provides the synthetic biologist {{with the opportunity}} to fabricate novel proteins through the programming of these motifs. Here we describe a method that enables one to combine multiple peptide motifs to generate a combinatorial protein library. With this method, a set of sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers were prepared. These primers were mixed and polymerized, so that the resultant DNA consisted of combinatorial polymers of multiple microgenes created from the stochastic assembly of the <b>sense</b> and antisense <b>primers.</b> With this motif-mixing method, we prepared a protein library from the BH 1 - 4 motifs shared among Bcl- 2 family proteins. Among the 41 clones created, 70 % of clones had a stable, presumably folded expression product in human cells, which was detectable by immunohistochemistry and western blot. The proteins obtained varied with respect to both the number and the order of the four motifs. The method enables homology-independent polymerization of DNA blocks that coded motif sequences, and the frequency of each motif within a library can be adjusted in a tailor-made manner. This motif programming has a potential for creating a library with a large proportion of folded/functional proteins...|$|R
50|$|The {{protocols}} for 5' or 3' RACES differ slightly. 5' RACE-PCR begins using mRNA as {{a template}} for a first round of cDNA synthesis (or reverse transcription) reaction using an anti-sense (reverse) oligonucleotide primer that recognizes a known sequence {{in the middle of}} the gene of interest; the primer is called a gene specific primer (GSP). The primer binds to the mRNA, and the enzyme reverse transcriptase adds base pairs to the 3' end of the primer to generate a specific single-stranded cDNA product; this is the reverse complement of the mRNA. Following cDNA synthesis, the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) is used to add a string of identical nucleotides, known as a homopolymeric tail, to the 3' end of the cDNA. (There are some other ways to add the 3'-terminal sequence for the first strand of the de novo cDNA synthesis which are much more efficient than homopolymeric tailing, but the sense of the method remains the same). A PCR reaction is then carried out, which uses a second anti-sense gene specific primer (GSP2) that binds to the known sequence, and a <b>sense</b> (forward) universal <b>primer</b> (UP) that binds the homopolymeric tail added to the 3' ends of the cDNAs to amplify a cDNA product from the 5' end.|$|R
