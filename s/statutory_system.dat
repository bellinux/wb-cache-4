25|$|Corporate insolvencies {{happen because}} {{companies}} become excessively indebted. Under UK law, {{a company is}} a separate legal person {{from the people who}} have invested money and labour into it, and it mediates a series of interest groups. Invariably the shareholders, directors and employees' liability is limited to the amount of their investment, so against commercial creditors they can lose no more than the money they paid for shares, or their jobs. Insolvencies become intrinsically possible whenever a relationship of credit and debt is created, as frequently happens through contracts or other obligations. In the section of an economy where competitive markets operate, wherever excesses are possible, insolvencies are likely to happen. The meaning of insolvency is simply an inability to repay debts, although the law isolates two main further meanings. First, for a court to order a company be wound up (and its assets sold off) or for an administrator to be appointed (to try to turn the business around), or for avoiding various transactions, the cash flow test is usually applied: a company must be unable to pay its debts as they fall due. Second, for the purpose of suing directors to compensate creditors, or for directors to be disqualified, a company must be shown to have fewer overall assets than liabilities on its balance sheet. If debts cannot be paid back to everybody in full, creditors necessarily stand in competition with one another for a share of the remaining assets. For this reason, a <b>statutory</b> <b>system</b> of priorities fixes the order among different kinds of creditor for payment.|$|E

40|$|In many Sub-Saharan countries, {{customary}} and <b>statutory</b> judicial <b>systems</b> co-exist. Customary {{justice is}} exercised by clan leaders or local courts, {{and based on}} restorative principles. By contrast, statutory justice is mostly retributive and administered by magistrates’ courts. As {{the jurisdiction of the}} customary and the <b>statutory</b> <b>systems</b> often overlap, victims can choose which judicial system to refer to, which may lead to contradictions between rules and inconsistencies in judgments. In this essay, we construct a model representing a dual judicial system. We show that the overlap of competence encourages rent-seeking and bribery, and yields to high rates of petty crimes and civil disputes. We recommend the subsidization of the <b>statutory</b> judicial <b>system,</b> as it efficiently improves deterrence and incapacitation in the dual judicial system while minimizing corruption of customary judges.

40|$|Fed up with soaring {{medical and}} {{indemnity}} costs, inadequate benefits, and pervasive fraud, employers and unions {{in several states}} during the 1990 s were allowed to "carve out" their own workers' compensation systems.

40|$|The <b>statutory</b> {{disciplinary}} <b>system</b> for physiotherapists in the Netherlands {{was introduced}} {{at the end}} of 1997. The aim of this system is to monitor the quality of physiotherapy. All the complaints that were dealt with by the five regional disciplinary boards in the period 1998 - 2002 were studied with regard to the number and nature of the complaints, the complainants, the accused and the verdicts. Furthermore, questionnaires were sent to 300 physiotherapists working in primary health care were asked about their views on the <b>statutory</b> disciplinary <b>system</b> (response 76 %). During the study period 33 complaints were made about physiotherapists. The annual number of accused physiotherapists increased from zero in 1998 to 11 in 2002. Male physiotherapists were accused relatively more often than their female colleagues. A sanction was imposed 11 times (33 % of the verdicts), mostly a reprimand or suspension. Most complaints concerned sexual intimacies or abuse. The <b>statutory</b> disciplinary <b>system</b> appears to be an important corrective instrument by imposing sanctions for serious forms of professional misconduct in physiotherapy. However, with regard to the development of standards for other aspects of the profession, i. e. treatment and advice, the system (still) plays a limited role.

5000|$|In 1968, Lord Donovan led the Royal Commission on Trade Unions and Employers' Associations. This {{recommended}} a <b>statutory</b> <b>system</b> of remedies for unfair dismissal. The recommendation {{was put into}} the Industrial Relations Act 1971. Exclusive jurisdiction to hear complaints and give remedies was conferred upon the newly created National Industrial Relations Court. The Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 soon replaced the unfair dismissal provisions, as was the National Industrial Relations Court with a system of Industrial Tribunals, since renamed Employment Tribunals. Often a tribunal is composed of one legally qualified Employment Judge (formally a [...] "chairperson") and two lay members, one from an employee friendly background (e.g. from a trade union) and the other from an employer friendly background. However, more recently straightforward claims, such as unlawful deduction from wages claims, are dealt with by an Employment Judge sitting alone. Unfair dismissal rights were recast in the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978. The present law {{is found in the}} Employment Rights Act 1996.|$|E
50|$|The {{public trust}} {{doctrine}} separates private ownership from resources held in common by the public. This legal right, recognized in New York's Constitution, holds that the people own the Hudson River and all citizens {{have a right to}} its use, but none can abuse this privilege to degrade its use by others. This democratic value was offset during the Industrial Revolution when courts and legislatures overlooked the public trust and gave more power to industry. A similar erosion of another common law, nuisance law, occurred in the same era. Nuisance law bars private land uses that injure the community or disrupt the rights of others to enjoy their property. In response, millions of Americans demanded greater protection for environmental and community health. As such, these rights were rewritten with greater emphasis in our federal <b>statutory</b> <b>system.</b> They declare no one has the right to pollute public resources and everyone has the right to a clean environment. Only by democratic representation has industry been given permits to pollute so long as the activity benefits society and causes no harm. This created the field of risk assessment and questions what society risks in allocating our common rights to industry.|$|E

50|$|The Convention of Balta Liman of 1 May 1849 was an {{agreement}} between the Russian Empire and the Ottomans regulating the political situation of the two Danubian Principalities (the basis of present-day Romania), signed during {{the aftermath of the}} Revolutions of 1848. Moldavia, which had been placed under Russian occupation in late spring 1848 following a revolutionary attempt, and Wallachia, where a liberal Provisional Government had briefly assumed power before facing a common Ottoman-Russian reaction, were confirmed their previous status of Ottoman suzerainty and Russian protectorate (first established in 1831-32 by the Regulamentul Organic). Minor provisions were added, signifying a relative increase in Ottoman influence—namely, hospodars were no longer elected by the local National Assemblies for life, and instead appointed by the Sublime Porte for seven-year terms. A common military presence was maintained until 1851. The document led to the appointment of Barbu Dimitrie Ştirbei as hospodar of Wallachia and Grigore Alexandru Ghica as hospodar of Moldavia. The Convention was rendered void by the Crimean War (during which the Principalities fell under Austrian occupation), and the <b>statutory</b> <b>system</b> itself was annulled by the 1856 Treaty of Paris.|$|E
5000|$|The House of Lords, {{with seven}} members given the {{constitutional}} issue of retrospective rulings, {{held that the}} charge over Spectrum Plus Ltd's book debts was floating, because the hallmark of a floating charge is that the business is free {{to deal with the}} assets in business as usual. Also relevant, but not determinative were the extent of the restrictions imposed by the debenture, the rights retained by Spectrum to deal with its debtors and collect the money owed by them, Spectrum's right to draw on its account with the bank into which the collected debts had to be paid, provided it kept within the overdraft limit, the description [...] "fixed charge" [...] attributed to the charge by the parties themselves. Even though the money was put into a separate account, that was the case here. The decision of Slade J in Siebe Gorman & Co Ltd v Barclays Bank had been subject to serious academic criticism, and had been doubted by Hoffmann J in Re Brightlife Ltd. Although Siebe Gorman was followed and extended by the English Court of Appeal in Re New Bullas Trading Ltd it was wrong and was overruled.

Thus appellees could place on their bumper a conspicuous bumper sticker explaining in no uncertain terms that they do not profess the motto [...] "Live Free or Die" [...] and that they violently disagree with the connotations of that motto. Since any implication that they affirm the motto can be so easily displaced, I cannot agree that the state <b>statutory</b> <b>system</b> for motor vehicle identification and tourist promotion may be invalidated under the fiction that appellees are unconstitutionally forced to affirm, or profess belief in, the state motto.|$|E
