5000|$|Previous {{research}} on the Plastic Patch had mostly focused {{on the effects of}} the plastic pieces on jellyfish, fish, sea turtles, and seabirds. Relatively little was known about how this type of marine debris would affect the microbial communities that make up 98% of the biomass in the ocean and control oceanic biogeochemistry. During this cruise, 30 sites were sampled. At 15 of these sites, a modified <b>surface</b> <b>net</b> called a manta trawl was used to collect plastic pieces, while water samples were collected from the upper 200 meters of the ocean. At the other 15 stations, only the surface waters were sampled. This study will allow researchers to begin to determine whether biofilms are forming on the plastic particles, whether the microbes living on the particles are different from the free-living planktonic organisms, and what effect these communities might have on the oceanic carbon cycle and nitrogen cycle.|$|E
50|$|Net-based {{surveys are}} less {{subjective}} than direct observations but are limited regarding {{the area that}} can be sampled (net apertures 1-2 m and ships typically have to slow down to deploy nets, requiring dedicated ship's time). The plastic debris sampled is determined by net mesh size, with similar mesh sizes required to make meaningful comparisons among studies. Floating debris typically is sampled with a neuston or manta trawl net lined with 0.33 mm mesh. Given the {{very high level of}} spatial clumping in marine litter, large numbers of net tows are required to adequately characterize the average abundance of litter at sea. Long-term changes in plastic meso-litter have been reported using <b>surface</b> <b>net</b> tows: in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre in 1999, plastic abundance was 335 000 items/km2 and 5.1 kg/km2, roughly an order of magnitude greater than samples collected in the 1980s. Similar dramatic increases in plastic debris have been reported off Japan. However, caution is needed in interpreting such findings, because of the problems of extreme spatial heterogeneity, and the need to compare samples from equivalent water masses, which is to say that, if an examination of the same parcel of water a week apart is conducted, an order of magnitude change in plastic concentration could be observed.|$|E

Meanwhile the 65 different landscape metrics of each analysis unit were acquired using landscape analysis method. Then the most effective landscape metrics affecting <b>surface</b> <b>net</b> radiation were determined by correlation analysis, partial correlation analysis, stepwise regression method, etc. At both class and landscape levels, this paper comprehensively analyzed the temporal and spatial variations of the <b>surface</b> <b>net</b> radiation {{as well as the}} effects of land cover pattern on it in Xiamen from a multi-seasonal perspective. The results showed that the spatial composition of land cover pattern shows significant influence on <b>surface</b> <b>net</b> radiation while the spatial allocation of land cover pattern does not. The proportions of bare land and forest land are effective and important factors which affect the changes of <b>surface</b> <b>net</b> radiation all the year round. Moreover, the proportion of forest land is more capable for explaining <b>surface</b> <b>net</b> radiation than the proportion of bare land. So the proportion of forest land is the most important and continuously effective factor which affects and explains the cross-seasonal differences of <b>surface</b> <b>net</b> radiation. This study is helpful in exploring the formation and evolution mechanism of urban heat island. It also gave theoretical hints and realistic guidance for urban planning and sustainable development...|$|E

40|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>net</b> {{radiation}} {{plays an}} important role in land–atmosphere interactions. The net radiation can be retrieved from satellite radiative products, yet its accuracy needs comprehensive assessment. This study evaluates monthly <b>surface</b> <b>net</b> radiation generated from the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) and the Surface Radiation Budget project (SRB) products, respectively, with quality-controlled radiation data from 50 meteorological stations in China for the period from March 2000 to December 2007. Our results show that <b>surface</b> <b>net</b> radiation is generally overestimated for CERES (SRB), with a bias of 26. 52 W/m 2 (18. 57 W/m 2) and a root mean square error of 34. 58 W/m 2 (29. 49 W/m 2). Spatially, the satellite-retrieved monthly mean of <b>surface</b> <b>net</b> radiation has relatively small errors for both CERES and SRB at inland sites in south China. Substantial errors are found at northeastern sites for two datasets, in addition to coastal sites for CERES. Temporally, multi-year averaged monthly mean errors are large at sites in western China in spring and summer, and in northeastern China in spring and winter. The annual mean error fluctuates for SRB, but decreases for CERES between 2000 and 2007. For CERES, 56 % of net radiation errors come from net shortwave (NSW) radiation and 44 % from net longwave (NLW) radiation. The errors are attributable to environmental parameters including surface albedo, surface water vapor pressure, land surface temperature, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of land surface proxy, and visibility for CERES. For SRB, 65 % of the errors come from NSW and 35 % from NLW radiation. The major influencing factors in a descending order are surface water vapor pressure, surface albedo, land surface temperature, NDVI, and visibility. Our findings offer an insight into error patterns in satellite-retrieved <b>surface</b> <b>net</b> radiation and should be valuable to improving retrieval accuracy of <b>surface</b> <b>net</b> radiation.

To calculate sensible heat flux H needs some non-remote sensing parameters, such as air temperature, wind velocity, land surface roughness etc. It also needs interpolation to get regional data and improve the estimation precision. In this paper, downward atmospheric long-wave radiation was retrieved according to thermal inertial, surface radiative temperature and other remote sensing parameters, then used to calculate land <b>surface</b> <b>net</b> radiation flux.

Further analyses of the fraction variation of land covers with scales and the change of related mean variables for individual land cover with scale, reach a consistent result that the major covers with larger patches are more insensitive to scale change than the minor ones with smaller patches.

The location of high and low net radiation values recorded during the day are the reverse at night. The spruce canopy reduces net radiation at the snow surface on cloudy days by obstructing a portion of the incident diffuse sky radiation. Conversely, the canopy is shown to exert considerable effect as a source of longwave radiation. <b>Surface</b> <b>net</b> longwave radiation increases sharply with proximity to trees.

Taking the southern part of Jiangsu province in China as the study area and through a scenario analysis, the influence of land use change on the regional temperature was analyzed from the perspective of land surface radiation budget and energy balance. The results indicated that (1) the monthly average temperature is significantly higher under the Rapid Economic Growth (REG) scenario than under the Cooperate Environmental Sustainability (CES) scenario in 2050, especially in the hottest month (July).

40|$|This study {{analysed}} {{the changes}} in cropland greenness during 1982 - 2006 in the North China Plain (NCP) and investigated the warming/cooling effects of the greenness changes. The results show that while spring cropland greenness increased, early summer cropland greenness substantially decreased from 1982 to 2006. In contrast to the cooling and wetting effects of the greenness increase in spring, the greenness reduction in early summer had warming and drying effects. The cooling/warming effects of cropland greenness changes accounted for 47 % of the spatial variance of daily maximum temperature (Tmax) change in spring and 44 % in early summer. The wetting/drying effects of cropland greenness changes accounted for 48 % of the spatial variance of daily minimum specific humidity (SPHmin) change in spring and 19 % in early summer. The cooling-wetting/warming-drying effects mainly resulted from the distinct partitioning of <b>surface</b> <b>net</b> radiation between surface latent heat flux and sensible heat flux over cropland with different greenness. Canopy transpiration plays a dominant role. The increased (decreased) cropland greenness corresponds to high (low) transpiration rate, less (more) sensible heat flux and high (low) humidity, and consequently cooling-wetting (warming-drying) effects.
