40|$|This is {{the final}} report of a three-year, Laboratory-Directed Research and Development (LDRD) project at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). One of the most startling events imaginable at a future high-energy {{collider}} would be the observation of baryon (B) and lepton (L) number violation. It is surprising that this possibility is not a priori ruled out by our current theoretical understanding of the Standard Model of electroweak forces - despite {{the best efforts of}} leading theorists over the last two and one half years. In fact, initial semi-classical calculations using instantons have suggested that, at supercollider-range energies, B- and L-violating processes might occur at an observable rate. Our project has consisted of a theoretical exploration of the possibility of observing B and L violation at future very-high-energy colliders. The techniques developed for addressing this problem should impact more generally on our understanding of weakly-coupled field theories in the non- perturbative regime where both energies and multiplicities are very large. We have made significant progress in our theoretical understanding of anomalous electroweak processes that might be seen at the next generation of supercolliders.

Probably. But paraphrasing Salvador Dali, if you believe that you and me are smarter in physics than Nielsen and Ninomiya, don't read this article, just go right on in your blissful idiocy. Therefore, I will try to make sense of backward causation.

This research was supported by the Department of Energy to investigate a new sampling calorimeter technology for the high intensity regions of the <b>Superconducting</b> <b>Supercollider.</b> The technology involved using liquid scintillator filled glass tubes embedded in a lead matrix.

40|$|The {{transition}} region between the straight part and {{the ends of}} the coils of the LHC model and prototype dipole magnets are often identified as the origin of training quenches. In order to study how the discontinuities in the material properties of these regions affect coil pre-stress and possibly gain more insight in the quench behavior, a program was set up at CERN to analyze by 3 D-FEM these particular regions. The ACCEL team, who performed a similar analysis for the main quadrupoles of the <b>Superconducting</b> <b>Supercollider</b> SSC, is entrusted with this program. In this paper we report on the results of 3 D-modeling and analysis of the coil return end region, including the complete coil mass, of a 1 -m single bore model magnet. This magnet represents all relevant features of the "two-in-one" LHC main dipole design concerning the winding configuration, the collar pack, the yoke, and the outer shell representing the He-vessel. The {{transition region}} between coil ends and straight section is modeled by slicing the magnet down to individual collar laminations per elementary level. The two-layer winding pack is represented with all individual conductor blocks, wedges, end spacers, and the interlayer spacer. Results will be presented for load cases with pre-stress after assembly at room temperature, after cool-down, and under operation at maximum current. Critical stress locations were identified in the transition into the pole free section of the magnet and in the bent part.

40|$|With {{the demise}} of the <b>Superconducting</b> <b>Supercollider</b> (SSC) Project, there was great concern that the {{technological}} developments for that accelerator and its associated detectors might well be lost in the aftermath. In the case of scintillating fiber tracking, such as not been the case. During the period 1990 [...] 1993, several tracking technologies were under development for SDC, including Scintillating Fiber Tracking, Straw-tubes, and Microstrip Gas Chambers. In summer 1990, several members of the Fiber Tracking Group (FTG) proposed the use of Scintillating Fiber Tracking to the D 0 experiment at Fermilab. This proposal was accepted, and D 0 now is building a 75, 000 fiber channel tracking detector with readout via Visible Light Photon Counters (VLPC) which were devices pioneered by the SDC Fiber Tracking Group. In addition, all the preshower detectors for D 0 also make use of fiber readout (in this case waveshifting fibers) and VLPC for photosensing. In February 1993, a full 7 months prior to cancellation of the SSC project by Congress, the SDC experiment rejected scintillating fiber tracking for further development. Fortunately for all concerned, the D 0 experiment had already embraced this technology, so this important detector concept could be further developed, refined, and utilized for physics experimentation. In early 2000, data will be taken with the D 0 fiber tracker to study Top Quarks, Beauty Particles, Electroweak Physics, QCD phenomena, and to search for new phenomena. The University of Notre Dame has played a fundamental and seminal role in {{the development and implementation of}} this detector technology. R. Ruchti has served as cospokesman of the Fiber Tracking Group since its inception in 1989, and has been a pioneer of fiber tracking technology since 1980. In addition, at least one other experiment at Fermilab, E 835, has utilized scintillating fibers with VLPC readout to study Charmonium in proton-antiproton collisions using a gas-jet target in the Tevatron antiproton accumulator ring.
