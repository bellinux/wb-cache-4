40|$|ABSTRACT: The stretch-blow {{molding process}} of poly(ethylene terephthalate) bottles generates some im-portant modications in the {{mechanical}} {{properties of the}} material. Considering, the range of temperature (T> Tg) that is usually used, the material has a very high viscosity and shows a strain hardening effect linked to the microstructure evolution. A simple visco-plastic model had been identied from experimental results of uniax-ial and biaxial tensile tests [1]. In the present work, we use this model and a numerical technique to simulate the ination of a preform under an internal pressure and also submitted to the elongation of a stretch rod. The nite elements method has a poor efciency in the stretch-blow molding process because the nal material strain is up to 300 %. This strain level generates strong element distortions and necessitates to often re-mesh. In order to carry out simulations with strain higher than 300 %, the constrained natural elements method (C-NEM [2]) is used. In fact, the C-NEM method allows simulation with high strain level without re-meshing. The original mesh can be use {{from the beginning to}} the end of the simulation. So the properties of the material can be recorded in each node, without loss of information. In a rst approach C-NEM are applied to simulate and opti-mize <b>stretch-blowing</b> of a PET preform by using axis symmetric assumption, the mold is not taking into account...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDeformation-induced {{modification}} of the dispersion state of silica nanoparticles in poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) has been characterized by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and wideangle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). We focused on the biaxial deformation applied at a temperature just above the glass transition temperature (110 °C), during the free <b>stretch-blowing</b> process of amorphous PET modified with submicron silica. The first nanocomposite studied contains 2. 5 wt % of fractal aggregated pyrogenic silica. The particles are well dispersed after the polymerization of PET, but they agglomerate and orient strongly parallel to the elongation direction after biaxial deformation. They form long streams of particles (> 2 µm long) regularly spaced by a distance of 50 - 100 nm. Interestingly, the silica organization {{is consistent with the}} hierarchical structure commonly proposed for the strain-induced crystallization of PET. The particles are rejected from the highly oriented domains induced by the strain, and their spatial organization reveals the superstructure. The second nanocomposite contains 5 % of spherical silica with a diameter of 20 nm. Its behavior is drastically different. The silica also forms streams of particles (1 - 2 µm long); however, the streams are oriented perpendicular to the elongation direction, and that is hardly compatible with the presence of a microfibrillar structure. We assume that this unexpected orientation is produced by the extended growth of mesophases and crystallites perpendicular to the orientation and that stacked lamellae are formed rather than microfibrils...|$|E
