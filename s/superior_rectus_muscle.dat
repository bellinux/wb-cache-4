40|$|We {{have treated}} 27 {{children}} with DVD and primary overaction of the inferior oblique {{muscles in the}} same time. In all of them we have done recession of the inferior oblique muscles (for 4, 6, 8 or 10 mm).

50|$|It passes upward on {{the medial}} {{borders of the}} <b>superior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> and levator palpebrae superioris, meeting the supraorbital nerve accompanies it between {{the roof of the}} orbit and levator palpebrae superioris to the supraorbital notch.|$|E
50|$|The <b>{{superior}}</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> is {{a muscle}} in the orbit. It {{is one of}} the extraocular muscles. It is innervated by the superior division of the oculomotor nerve (Cranial Nerve III). In the primary position (looking straight ahead), the superior rectus muscle's primary function is elevation, although it also contributes to intorsion and adduction.|$|E
50|$|DVD {{is often}} mistaken for over-action of the {{inferior}} oblique extra-ocular muscles. DVD can be revealed on ocular movement testing when one eye is occluded by the nose on lateral gaze. This eye will then elevate, simulating an inferior oblique over action. However, in a unilateral case, overaction of the <b>superior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> in the unaffected dominant eye, {{can also be}} a causing factor as well as causing a V pattern exophoria.|$|E
50|$|Six extraocular muscles {{facilitate}} eye movement. These muscles {{arise from}} the common tendinous ring in the orbit, the eye cavity, and attach to the eyeball. The six muscles are the lateral, medial, inferior and <b>superior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles,</b> and the inferior and superior oblique muscles. The muscles, when contracting, cause movement of the eyeball, by pulling the eyeball towards the muscle. For example, the lateral rectus is on the lateral side of the eyeball. When it contracts, the eyeball moves so that the pupil looks outwards. The medial rectus causes the eyeball to look inwards; the inferior rectus downwards and the <b>superior</b> <b>rectus</b> upwards. The <b>superior</b> oblique muscle and inferior oblique muscle attach at angles to the eyeball.|$|R
40|$|OBJETIVOS: Avaliar o efeito da toxina botulínica do tipo A e da crotoxina na ativação de células satélites das fibras musculares de retos superiores de coelhos. MÉTODOS: Os músculos retos superiores do olho direito de 29 coelhos machos albinos neozelandeses foram inoculados com toxina botulínica do tipo A ou com crotoxina, em diferentes doses. Os músculos retos superiores contralaterais de cada animal foram inoculados com solução salina em volume igual ao das toxinas. Os animais foram sacrificados 12, 18 ou 25 dias após as aplicações. Os olhos foram enucleados e cada músculo foi preparado para análise imunoistoquímica, com marcadores de células satélites. Foi realizada contagem dos núcleos corados pelos marcadores a cada cem miofibras. RESULTADOS: A aplicação de toxina botulínica e de crotoxina provocou um aumento no número de células satélites ativadas e em proliferação nos músculos retos superiores. Uma maior ativação foi observada após a aplicação de crotoxina, embora, estatisticamente, a diferença do efeito de ativação entre os grupos botoxina e crotoxina não tenha sido significativa. Nos grupos botoxina e crotoxina, não houve correlação estatisticamente significativa entre a dose e o volume aplicados e o aumento na ativação das células. O tempo de vida após a aplicação contribuiu para o aumento das células ativadas nos grupos. CONCLUSÃO: A observação de maior desorganização na estrutura muscular e de sinais de regeneração mais evidentes no grupo crotoxina parece estar correlacionada ao aumento de células satélites ativadas. PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} botulinum toxin A and crotoxin on satellite cell activation in the <b>muscle</b> fibers of <b>superior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> of rabbits. METHODS: The <b>superior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> in the right eyes of 29 male, albino, New Zealand rabbits were inoculated with different doses of botulinum toxin A or crotoxin. The contra-lateral <b>superior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> in each rabbit were inoculated with the same volume of saline solution only. The animals were sacrificed either 12, 18 or 25 days after the inoculation. The eyes were enucleated and subsequently, each muscle was prepared for immunohistochemical analysis, using satellite cell markers. The positive nuclei, revealed by the markers in each 100 myofibers, were counted. RESULTS: The application of the botulinum toxin A and crotoxina triggered a more significant increase satellite cell activation and proliferation in right <b>superior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> in rabbits when compared with a saline solution inoculation in the contralateral muscles. Greater cell activation was observed after crotoxin application, although, statistically, {{the difference in the}} effects of this activation between the botoxin and crotoxin groups was not significant. There was no statistically significant correlation between the dose and the volume applied and resulting cell activation in the botoxin and crotoxin groups. Post-application survival time contributed to the increase in activated satellite cells in all groups. CONCLUSION: The observed increase in disorganization in the muscle structure, together with more obvious signs of regeneration in the crotoxina group, suggests a correlation with the increase in satellite cell activation...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{delineate}} {{the nature of}} the nerve capsule to the inferior oblique muscle at birth and adulthood, and to compare it to the nerve capsules of other extraocular muscles. METHODS: Fresh autopsy specimens were obtained from a newborn and a 26 year-old male. The length of the inferior oblique nerve was analyzed with high magnification photomicroscopy and electron microscopy and compared to the nerve capsules of the adult medial, lateral, inferior and <b>superior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles.</b> These were also compared to the intracranial portion of the third cranial nerve of the adult specimen. RESULTS: The collagen layer of the nerve to the inferior oblique was present throughout its course. It is well developed in the newborn and comparable to the adult specimen. The nerves to the medial, inferior, lateral and <b>superior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> are also surrounded by a similar capsule containing collagen fibers that are aligned parallel to the axon of the nerve. The intracranial portion of the third cranial nerve only has a thin fibrous capsule. CONCLUSION: The nerve capsule of the inferior oblique comprises a surrounding collagen layer, presumably to protect the nerve from stretching. This layer is well developed along the entire course of the nerve and is present from birth. The nerves to the other extraocular muscles have a similar capsule that likely serves a similar function. These findings expand current understanding of the nerves to the extraocular muscles and may be useful for improving treatments...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE. A common {{treatment}} for motility disorders of the extraocular muscles (EOMs) is a resection procedure {{in which there}} is surgical shortening of the muscle. This procedure results in rotation of the globe toward the resected muscle, increased resting tension across the agonist–antagonist pair, and stretching of the elastic components of the muscles. In the rabbit, due to orbital constraints and limited rotation, resection results in more significant stretch of the surgically treated muscle than the antagonist. This surgical preparation allows for the examination of the effects of surgical shortening of one <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> and passive stretch of its ipsilateral antagonist. METHODS. The insertional 6 mm of the <b>superior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> of adult rabbits were resected and reattached to the original insertion site.

40|$|PURPOSE. Botulinum toxin A (Botox) is {{commonly}} used for strabismus treatment. Although other muscles atrophy after intramuscular injection with Botox, extraocular muscles (EOMs) do not. A continuous process of myonuclear addition in normal uninjured adult myofibers in rabbit EOMs was stud-ied. In this study, the effect of Botox-induced muscle paralysis on myofiber remodeling in adult EOMs was examined. METHODS. The <b>superior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> of adult rabbits were each injected with 5 units of Botox. The contralateral muscle received injections of saline only. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was administered for various periods after Botox treatment, followed by various BrdU-free periods. Myonuclear addition, the number of BrdU-positive satellite cells, {{and the number of}} MyoD-positive satellite cells were quantified, as were alter-ations in expression of immature myosins...|$|R
50|$|Each {{anterior}} semi-circular canals has excitatory projections to the ipsilateral <b>superior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> and its yoke i.e., the contralateral inferior oblique {{while simultaneously}} inhibiting the ipsilateral {{inferior rectus muscle}} and its yoke i.e. the contralateral superior oblique. Also, each posterior semi-circular canals has excitatory projections to the ipsilateral superior oblique and its yoke i.e. the contralateral inferior rectus, while simultaneously inhibiting the ipsilateral inferior oblique and its yoke i.e. the contralateral superior rectus. A head tilt causes stimulation of both anterior semi-circular canals and the posterior semi-circular canals resulting in excitation of ipsilateral intorters (superior oblique and superior rectus) and contralateral extorters (inferior oblique and inferior rectus) while their antagonists are simultaneously inhibited. The otoliths (utricle and saccule) probably follow a similar pathway.|$|E
40|$|A 66 -year-old female had {{suffered}} from proptosis {{in the left}} eye (OS) and double vision for 1 month due to abnormality of the <b>superior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle.</b> Visual acuity was noted as 20 / 20 in both eyes (OU). Eye movement showed limited OS supraduction. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an indistinct mass in the orbit involving the <b>superior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle.</b> A biopsy specimen of the orbital tumor led to the histological diagnosis of extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma. Radiotherapy with a total dosage of 30 Gy was administered, which subsequently resolved the tumor. However, the supraduction limitation of ocular movement remained unchanged. Supraduction limitation is due to muscular contraction disorder of the <b>superior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle,</b> caused by direct lymphoma cell invasion...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE. Previous {{work has}} {{demonstrated}} {{the effectiveness of}} insulin-like growth factor (IGF) -II in increasing force genera-tion in extraocular muscle (EOM).

40|$|Purpose: To {{report the}} case of a patient with large-angle {{hypertropia}} of an intramuscular hemangioma of the right <b>superior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> (SR). Methods: A 63 -year-old man with progressive vertical deviation of the right eye for the past 6 months visited our strabismus department; his condition was not painful. An examination indicated that he had 60 PD of right hypertropia at distance and near in primary gaze. Additionally, a significant limitation of his downgaze was noted. The right eye appeared mildly proptotic, and the upper and lower eyelids were slightly edematous. Corrected vision was 20 / 20 in both eyes. Results: Orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies revealed fusiform enlargement of the right <b>superior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle,</b> with prominent but irregular enhancement following gadolinium administration. Incisional biopsy revealed an intramuscular hemangioma in the <b>superior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> with cavernous-type vessels.

40|$|Aim. To asses {{effective}} role of {{thickness of}} <b>superior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> in the variation of intraocular pression (IOP) in the patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy. Methods. IOP {{was measured in}} 76 eyes of 38 patients(mean age, 42. 4 years;range 19 to 58 years) with Graves' ophthalmopathy in primary and in upgaze position(Elevation with divergence of 23 °). Results. IOP in 52 of the 76 eyes was 17. 5 +/- 2. 12 mm Hgin primary position and 21. 2 +/- 2. 75 mm Hg in upgaze position. In the eyes (28) with thickness of the <b>superior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> > 4. 6 mm,IOP was 22. 7 +/- 1. 48 mm Hg in primary position and 27. 1 +/- 1. 92 mm Hg in upgaze position. The difference in the values in this group is statistically significant (the paired t test,p= 0. 05). Conclusions.

50|$|Three {{antagonistic}} {{pairs of}} muscles control eye movements: the lateral and medial <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles,</b> the <b>superior</b> and inferior <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles,</b> and the <b>superior</b> and inferior oblique muscles. These muscles {{are responsible for}} movements of the eye along three different axes: horizontal, either toward the nose (adduction) or away from the nose (abduction); vertical, either elevation or depression; and torsional, movements that bring {{the top of the}} eye toward the nose (intorsion) or away from the nose (extorsion). Horizontal movements are controlled entirely by the medial and lateral rectus muscles; the medial <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> is responsible for adduction, the lateral <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> for abduction. Vertical movements require the coordinated action of the <b>superior</b> and inferior <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles,</b> as well as the oblique muscles. The relative contribution of the rectus and oblique groups depends on the horizontal position of the eye. In the primary position (eyes straight ahead), both of these groups contribute to vertical movements. Elevation is due to the action of the <b>superior</b> <b>rectus</b> and inferior oblique muscles, while depression is due to the action of the inferior <b>rectus</b> and <b>superior</b> oblique <b>muscles.</b> When the eye is abducted, the <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> are the prime vertical movers. Elevation is due to the action of the <b>superior</b> <b>rectus,</b> and depression is due to the action of the inferior rectus. When the eye is adducted, the oblique muscles are the prime vertical movers. Elevation is due to the action of the inferior oblique muscle, while depression is due to the action of the superior oblique muscle. The oblique muscles are also primarily responsible for torsional movements.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{reviewed}} the radiologic features of 15 patients with orbital metastases originating from breast cancer. METHODS: This was a retrospective consecutive case series. Fifteen consecutive patients with orbital metastases originating from breast carcinoma were identified between March 1997 and September 2008. A retrospective chart review was carried out, and the radiologic findings were reviewed. RESULTS: The metastases were preseptal in 53 %, intraconal in 60 %, and both intraconal and extraconal in 33 %. Lacrimal gland enlargement was noted in 33 %, episcleral space involvement in 33 %, bone involvement in 13 %, and globe dystopia in 53 %. The extraocular muscles {{were involved in}} 87 %; in 60 %, two or more muscles were involved. The medial and lateral <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> were affected in 53 % and 47 %, respectively, and the inferior and <b>superior</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> in 33 %. In 47 % one or more radiologic features had not been noted by the radiologist, and in 20 % the findings were misinterpreted as an"orbital pseudotumor.

50|$|The great {{importance}} of intorsion and extorsion {{produced by the}} two oblique muscles can only be understood when it is considered {{with regards to the}} other muscle actions present. The two obliques prevent the eye from rotating about its long axis (retina to pupil) when the <b>superior</b> and inferior <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> contract. This is because the orbit does not face directly forwards- the centre-line of the orbit is a little over 20 degrees out from the mid-line. But because the eyes do face forwards, when acting alone, as well as making the eye look up, <b>superior</b> <b>rectus</b> causes it to rotate slightly about the long axis, so the top of the eye moves medially (intorsion). Similarly, in addition to making the eye look down, inferior rectus would cause the eye to rotate about the long axis so the top of the eye moves slightly laterally (extorsion), if acting alone. Clearly this is undesirable as our vision would rotate when we looked up and down. For this reason, these two <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> work in conjunction with the two obliques. When acting alone, superior oblique causes intorsion, inferior oblique, extorsion. Hence, when inferior rectus contracts so we look down, superior oblique also contracts to prevent extorsion of the eye, and when <b>superior</b> <b>rectus</b> contracts so we look up, inferior oblique contracts to prevent intorsion, thus the undesired rotatory actions of the inferior and <b>superior</b> <b>recti</b> about the long axis of the eye are cancelled out. This keeps our vision horizontally level, irrespective of eye position in the orbit.|$|R
