5|$|When Storm's father died, he {{returned}} from Amsterdam to Liverpool {{to be with his}} mother at Stormsville, at 54 Broad Green Road, Broadgreen, Liverpool. On 27 September 1972, Storm developed a chest infection and could not sleep properly, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> sleeping pills. The next day Storm and his mother were both found dead. A post mortem determined that Storm had not taken enough pills to kill himself, but it was suspected that, after finding her son's body, his mother had died.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second Boer War in 1899, Guest was below the minimum age of 18 for enlisting. He nevertheless managed to join the First City Volunteers, a Grahamstown regiment in which his father had served. Its task of guarding a bridge over a railway line was unappealing, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> the opportunity of joining the Eastern Province Light Horse, attached to the Highland Brigade, which was recruiting volunteers who could both ride and shoot. Early in the Brigade's advance into the Orange Free State {{on its way to the}} relief of Kimberley, Guest got food poisoning and he returned to Grahamstown.|$|E
5|$|On November 22, 1963, Altgens was {{scheduled}} {{to work in the}} AP offices in Dallas as the wirephoto editor. He asked instead to go to the railroad overpass (the bridge under which Elm, Main and Commerce Streets converge at the west end of Dealey Plaza) to photograph the motorcade that was to take President Kennedy from Love Field to his scheduled appearance at the Dallas Trade Mart. Altgens was not assigned to work in the field that day, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> his personal single-lens reflex camera rather than the motor-driven equipment normally used for news events.|$|E

5|$|Sawyer {{wakes up}} the next day, October 1, 2004, with his arm bandaged up, while Kate looks on. She tells Sawyer that she knows {{the letter was written}} when Sawyer was a kid, and also works out that the letter wasn't written to Sawyer, but by him. He tells Kate that his real name isn't Sawyer and that the letter was written to the real Sawyer, a con man, who ruined his family. He ended up {{becoming}} a con man himself, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> the name Sawyer as an alias. He snatches the letter from Kate and tells her not to feel sorry for him and to leave.|$|E
5|$|Tim Downs scouted {{possible}} {{areas for}} location filming. He {{looked for a}} location that could stand in for three different venues without the production having to move or change hotels: the film's opening scene; the God planet's establishing shots; and the Nimbus III Paradise City. Downs {{was familiar with the}} Mojave desert and thought that locations near Ridgecrest, California, would serve the production's needs, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> photos based on sketches Rodis had provided of what the locations might look like. Downs also shot photos with filters and tried to accomplish dust effects with his car to replicate ideas for how some sequences would be shot. When Downs returned with the photos, Shatner felt that the locations the scout found would be perfect for the film.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, {{at the age}} of 26, O'Brien {{collapsed}} on stage during a performance, and later died due to complications after an appendicitis operation. Storm disbanded the Hurricanes and became a disc jockey, working at the Silver Blades Ice Rink in Liverpool, in Benidorm (he was also a water-skiing instructor there) in Jersey and Amsterdam. When Storm's father died, he returned from Amsterdam to Liverpool to be with his mother. He developed a chest infection and could not sleep properly, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> sleeping pills. On 28 September 1972, Storm and his mother were both found dead, at Stormsville. The post mortem revealed that Storm had alcohol and sleeping pills in his blood (as had his mother) but not enough to cause his death, which was ruled accidental. Although it could not be proven, it is thought that his mother had committed suicide after finding Storm's body.|$|E
50|$|Sam's {{family lives}} in Boston, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> Tom {{to meet his}} family. When Sam's father voices his {{concerns}} over Sam's career, Tom is sympathetic to the concerns more than Sam is comfortable with.|$|R

5|$|Kemper {{then put}} {{both of the}} women's bodies {{in the trunk of}} his Ford Galaxie and {{returned}} to his apartment, being stopped on the way by a police officer for a broken taillight but managing not to be detected for his more serious offences. His roommate was not at home, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> the bodies into his apartment, where he took pornographic photographs of, and had sex with, the naked corpses before dismembering them. He then put the body parts into plastic bags, which he later abandoned near Loma Prieta Mountain. Before disposing of Pesce's and Luchessa's severed heads in a ravine, Kemper engaged in irrumatio with both of them. In August, Pesce's skull was found up on Loma Prieta Mountain. An extensive search failed to turn up the rest of her remains or a trace of her companion.|$|E
5|$|Yorkshire {{finished}} second to Lancashire in the County Championship in 1904 but regained the title in 1905. Hirst's leg-strain continued to cause him pain {{throughout the season}} and again hampered his bowling. Even <b>so,</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> 110 wickets at 19.94 and passed 2,000 runs for the second time, scoring 2,226 runs {{at an average of}} 53.95. Early in the season, Hirst scored 341 against Leicestershire, the highest score of his career and, as of 2015, the record individual innings by a Yorkshire batsman. On a good pitch for batting, he began his innings when Yorkshire had scored 22 for three wickets, in reply to Leicestershire's score of 419, batted just under seven hours and hit 53 fours and a six. Later that season, he scored another double century, hitting 232 not out against Surrey; only two other players reached double figures in the Yorkshire innings. In the same game, Hirst took five wickets for 43 runs.|$|E
5|$|In 1155 {{the only}} English pope, Adrian IV, {{authorised}} King Henry II of England to {{take possession of}} Ireland as a feudal territory nominally under papal overlordship. The pope wanted the English monarch to annex Ireland and bring the Irish church into line with Rome, despite this process already underway in Ireland by 1155. An all-island kingship of Ireland had been created in 854 by Máel Sechnaill mac Máele Ruanaid. His last successor was Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair, who had become King of Ireland in early 1166, and exiled Diarmait Mac Murchada, King of Leinster. Diarmait asked Henry II for help, gaining a group of Anglo-Norman aristocrats and adventurers, led by Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, to help him regain his throne. Diarmait and his Anglo-Norman allies succeeded and he became King of Leinster again. De Clare married Diarmait's daughter, and when Diarmait died in 1171, de Clare became King of Leinster. Henry was afraid that de Clare would make Ireland a rival Norman kingdom, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> advantage of the papal bull and invaded, forcing de Clare and the other Anglo-Norman aristocrats in Ireland and the major Irish kings and lords to recognise him as their overlord. English lords came close to colonising the entire island, but a Gaelic resurgence from the 1260s resulted in the island divided between Gaelic-Irish and Anglo-Irish lords by 1400. Many of the latter became completely Gaelicised, and did not recognise England's kings except perhaps nominally. Some, such as Manus O'Donnell and Conn O'Neill, 1st Earl of Tyrone, were kings themselves.|$|E

25|$|Reeve {{began his}} {{involvement}} in horse riding in 1985 after learning to ride for the film Anna Karenina. He was initially allergic to horses, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> antihistamines. He trained on Martha's Vineyard, and by 1989, he began eventing. His allergies soon disappeared.|$|E
25|$|In 1954 {{he decided}} to leave {{teaching}} and Highgate {{while he was still}} enjoying it, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> an early pension and bought six acres in Hampshire where he planted an orchard and built a house and a simple fruit store on it. He made a living and employed several workers. He died in Haslemere.|$|E
25|$|The {{movement}} suffered three splits {{during its}} existence, {{only one of}} which produced a new organization.

25|$|Upon regaining his health, First Lieutenant Schofield {{returned}} to West Point as {{assistant professor of}} natural and experimental philosophy from 1855 to 1860. His career seemed stalled, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> leave (1860–1861), to work as {{professor of physics at}} Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. Several of his brothers had settled in St. Louis, following the lead of his eldest brother Rev. James Van Pelt Schofield (1825-1898).|$|E

25|$|Paul Kroegel, a German immigrant, {{moved to}} Florida in 1881 and {{lived on the}} west bank of Indian River Lagoon. He was fascinated with the {{pelicans}} on the island. Being able to see the island from his home, Paul would watch the pelicans and other water birds. He eventually took an interest in the island and its protection. However, there was not any state or federal law to help him <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> control of the situation himself. Kroegel sailed to the island to stand guard and protect the birds and the island.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} start of the action, monitor Tecumseh moved past the fort and toward Tennessee, {{apparently}} in obedience to that part of her orders. Commander Tunis A. M.

Almost immediately, a torpedo went off under her hull, and she filled with water and sank in two or three minutes. Only 21 of her crew of 114 were saved. Craven was among those lost, so he could not explain his decisions.|$|E
