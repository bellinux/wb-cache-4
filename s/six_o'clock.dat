5|$|Ewell {{interpreted}} {{his orders}} as calling {{only for a}} cannonade. His 32 guns, along with A. P. Hill's 55 guns, engaged in a two-hour artillery barrage at extreme range that had little effect. Finally, about <b>six</b> <b>o'clock,</b> Ewell sent orders to each of his division commanders to attack the Union lines in his front.|$|E
5|$|At about <b>six</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the morning, some of {{the protesters}} {{discovered}} a small gate to the palace was unguarded. Making their way inside, they searched for the queen's bedchamber. The royal guards raced throughout the palace, bolting doors and barricading hallways {{and those in the}} compromised sector, the cour de marbre, fired their guns at the intruders, killing a young member of the crowd. Infuriated, the rest surged towards the breach and streamed inside.|$|E
5|$|His {{body was}} cut down {{after an hour}} by the hangman, John Foxton, who claimed Corder's {{trousers}} and stockings according to his rights. The body was taken back to the courtroom at Shire Hall, where it was slit open along the abdomen to expose the muscles. The crowds were allowed to file past until <b>six</b> <b>o'clock,</b> when the doors were shut. According to the Norwich and Bury Post, over 5,000 people queued to see the body.|$|E
6000|$|One of {{the famous}} Atlantic dinners came along in December. [...] "Don't [...] you dare to refuse that invitation," [...] wrote Howells, [...] "to meet [...] Emerson, Aldrich, and all those boys at the Parker House, at <b>six</b> [...] <b>o'clock,</b> Tuesday, December 15th. Come!" ...|$|R
60|$|By twelve <b>o'clock</b> <b>six</b> more had arrived, {{the last}} comer being Mr. Percy. Each {{newcomer}} {{was filled with}} rage and horror upon hearing of the awful tragedy which had been enacted.|$|R
60|$|Hector bowed {{deeply and}} left the room. When he {{returned}} to the hotel at two <b>o'clock,</b> <b>six</b> grooms were standing with the horses before the entrance; he waited outside until the viscount, followed by four officers, came out.|$|R
5|$|Once there, Achebe was double-promoted in {{his first}} year, {{completing}} the first two years' studies in one, and spending only four years in secondary school, instead of the standard five. Achebe was unsuited to the school's sports regimen and belonged instead {{to a group of}} six exceedingly studious pupils. So intense were their study habits that the headmaster banned the reading of textbooks from five to <b>six</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the afternoon (though other activities and other books were allowed).|$|E
5|$|Chlomo {{missed his}} freedom by three months. The Soviets had liberated Auschwitz 11 days earlier, and the Americans were {{making their way}} towards Buchenwald. Eliezer is {{transferred}} to the children's block where he stays with 600 others, dreaming of soup. On 5 April 1945 the inmates are told the camp is to be liquidated and {{they are to be}} movedâ€”another death march. On 11 April, with 20,000 inmates still inside, a resistance movement inside the camp attacks the remaining SS officers and takes control. At <b>six</b> <b>o'clock</b> that evening, an American tank arrives at the gates, and behind it the Sixth Armored Division of the United States Third Army.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s, Victoria had repressive and {{restrictive}} drinking laws, {{including the}} notorious <b>six</b> <b>o'clock</b> closing. Blamey took {{the position that}} it was the job of the police to enforce the laws, even if they did not support them. Many members of the public did not agree with this attitude, maintaining that the police should not uphold such laws. Almost as controversially, Blamey drew a sharp distinction between his personal life and his job. His presence in a hotel after closing time was always welcome, as it meant that drinking could continue, for it was known {{that it would not be}} raided while he was there; but other citizens felt that it was unjust when they were arrested for breaking the same laws.|$|E
50|$|After dinner, tea {{is taken}} at about <b>six</b> or seven <b>o'clock</b> in the evening, {{actually}} a high tea including a light meal. It is not until still later, about nine o'clock, that people {{sit down for}} the last meal of the day, supper.|$|R
60|$|Between <b>six</b> {{and seven}} <b>o'clock</b> {{in the evening}} of the same day a young man descended the hills into the valley of the Exe, at a point about midway between Silverthorn and the {{residence}} of Margery's grandmother, four miles to the east.|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{a matter}} of fact," [...] he declared, [...] "I think that the {{evidence}} went to prove {{that there were no}} visitors in the restaurant that night. You see, all these offices round here close at <b>six</b> or seven <b>o'clock,</b> and the whole neighborhood becomes deserted." ...|$|R
5|$|The Minister for Defence, Senator George Pearce, {{appointed}} McCay to {{the newly}} created post of Inspector General of the AIF on 29 November 1915, with the local rank of major general. McCay was involved in recruiting campaigns, and inspected AIF units and reported on their training and equipment. He proposed a new training regime, with a national syllabus that {{increased the number of}} hours per week of training and the duration of training to twelve weeks. This led to strikes at the camps at Casula and Liverpool. Rioting soldiers clashed with police at Circular Quay and at Central Station striking soldiers were shot and one killed by soldiers sent to return them to Liverpool. As a result, new liquor laws were introduced, including <b>six</b> <b>o'clock</b> closing.|$|E
5|$|Adam, a photographer, awakens in {{a bathtub}} {{in a large}} {{dilapidated}} bathroom, and finds himself chained at the ankle to a pipe. Lawrence Gordon, an oncologist, is similarly shackled across the room, and between them is a corpse holding a revolver and a microcassette recorder. Each man has a tape in his pocket, and Adam is able to retrieve the recorder. Adam's tape urges him to escape the bathroom, while Lawrence's tape tells him to kill Adam by <b>six</b> <b>o'clock,</b> or {{his wife and daughter}} will be killed and he will be left to die. Adam finds a bag containing two hacksaws inside a toilet tank; they attempt to cut through the chains, but Adam's saw breaks and he throws it at the mirror in frustration, revealing a hidden camera behind the mirror. Lawrence realizes that the hacksaws weren't meant for the chains, but for their feet and identifies their captor as the Jigsaw Killer, whom Lawrence knows of because he was a suspect five months before.|$|E
5|$|This left Chaltin's {{expedition}} as the spearhead for Leopold's northern campaign, and {{the commandant}} continued his mission despite the grave loss of Dhanis' forces. Chaltin {{had in his}} column eight companies, each containing one-hundred Congolese soldiers led by a Belgian lieutenant. He {{was accompanied by a}} contingent of five hundred Azande under chiefs Renzi and Bafuka. The expedition reached the Nile on 14 February 1897, where a small party of Mahdists from Rejaf exchanged fire with Chaltin's scouts. After two days of waiting for the supply train and rear guard to arrive, a Mahdist force approached the Belgian camp in the evening of 16 February, and prepared to attack. Chaltin ordered his artillery to fire at the Mahdists, causing the assembled rebels to flee under the barrage. The next day, at <b>six</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the morning, Chaltin took to the offensive and began to advance on Rejaf.|$|E
50|$|In 1877, while {{staying at}} Baden-Baden, Jeanne met the Emperor of Brazil, {{and it was}} the custom for her to play to him from <b>six</b> to eight <b>o'clock</b> every evening; and on her departure, His Majesty {{presented}} her with a handsome bracelet set with diamonds, together with his photograph.|$|R
50|$|Goldsmith co-anchors the <b>six</b> and 11 <b>o'clock</b> newscasts for WYFF-TV, weekdays. She is also {{a health}} and medical reporter.

She also has a Master's degree in Health and Nutrition Education.|$|R
6000|$|... "That show {{ought to}} be out by this time," [...] {{he said to his}} brothers. [...] "Generally those moving picture places kind of run down between <b>six</b> and seven <b>o'clock.</b> If they are {{continuous}} they throw in some old stuff or a lot of advertising matter just to fill in the time." ...|$|R
5|$|Beginning {{their second}} innings after lunch, {{there was a}} little {{improvement}} for the Smokers, though six of the team were dismissed without reaching double figures. Gunn top-scored for his side, remaining 43 not {{out at the end of}} the innings, while Charles Thornton and George Giffen both scored quickly, making 27 and 15 respectively. Despite these scores, the Smokers only reached 152, leaving the Non-Smokers needing 14 runs to win the match. Grace collected three further wickets in this second innings, but he was bettered by Barlow, who took five for 24. Although the match was past half past five in the evening with poor light, the decision was made that the match should not continue into the following day, and so the Non-Smokers came out to bat and hit the runs they required, reaching the total shortly after <b>six</b> <b>o'clock.</b> The match was played at Lord's in good weather on both days, and was well attended on the first day, with between six and seven thousand spectators at the ground.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{should say}} that they had better put up at the Greyhound. I don't suppose he will go out until <b>six</b> or seven <b>o'clock,</b> but they had better be there earlier. One should station himself in the main street, the other concealing himself somewhere beyond the fellow's house, for it is likely enough that {{sometimes}} he may take the other way. I will {{go down to the}} Greyhound at six, and will wait there until one of them brings me news that he has left." ...|$|R
25|$|The <b>Six</b> <b>O'Clock</b> News first {{aired on}} 3 September 1984, {{eventually}} becoming the most watched news programme in the UK (however, since 2006 {{it has been}} overtaken by the BBC News at Ten).|$|E

5000|$|In March 2008, Sir Alan Sugar {{announced}} that he had proposed a teenage version of The Apprentice to the BBC to be broadcast around [...] "the <b>six,</b> seven <b>o'clock</b> timeslot featuring 12 to 15-year-old kids"; however, he claimed that [...] "nobody took any notice" [...] of his suggestions. Twelve months later, Sugar said that he was in negotiations regarding the programme and it was officially announced by the BBC and Talkback Thames on 20 May 2009 episode of The Apprentice: You're Fired!. Applicants, of ages 16 and 17 and from a variety of social and educational backgrounds, were encouraged to apply via The Apprentice website in what was originally announced as a five-part series, with Sugar seeking to [...] "promote enterprise amongst young people, as the future of our economy relies on them". In all, 28,000 people applied and ten of these were selected for the programme.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No reprieve, no reprieve! Nobody comes near us. There's {{only the}} night left now!' moaned Dennis faintly, as he wrung his hands. 'Do you think they'll reprieve {{me in the}} night, brother? I've known reprieves come in the night, afore now. I've known 'em come as late as five, <b>six,</b> and seven <b>o'clock</b> in the morning. Don't you think there's a good chance yet,--don't you? Say you do. Say you do, young man,' whined the miserable creature, with an imploring gesture towards Barnaby, 'or I shall go mad!' ...|$|R
60|$|That Sunday {{was spent}} by Aurelia at the Bear Inn, at Reading. Her journey {{had been made}} by very short stages, one before breakfast, another lasting till noon, when there was a long halt for dinner and rest for horse and rider, and then another ride, never even in these longest summer days {{prolonged}} beyond <b>six</b> or seven <b>o'clock</b> at latest, such was the danger of highwaymen being attracted by the valuable horses, although the grooms in charge were so well armed that they might almost as well have been troopers.|$|R
25|$|O'Keefe was air-lifted back to Sydney for treatment, {{but about}} six weeks later, against doctors' orders, he {{returned}} to work on <b>Six</b> <b>O'Clock</b> Rock. He subsequently had to undergo many gruelling operations to reconstruct his face, which left his appearance permanently changed.|$|E
25|$|Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore), {{a single}} native Minnesotan, moves to Minneapolis in 1970 at age 30 and becomes Associate Producer of WJM-TV's <b>Six</b> <b>O'Clock</b> News. Her sincere, kind {{demeanor}} often {{acts as a}} foil for the personalities of her co-workers and friends.|$|E

60|$|Gentlemen {{and ladies}} at the hotels, in London, {{generally}} dine about <b>six</b> or seven <b>o'clock,</b> each party or family by themselves, {{in their own}} private parlor. One evening, about eight o'clock, just after the waiter had removed the cloth from the table where Rollo's father and mother, with Rollo himself and his cousin Jennie, had been dining, and left the table clear, Mr. Holiday rose, and walked slowly and feebly--for he was quite out of health, though much better than he had been--towards a secretary which stood {{at the side of}} the room.|$|R
6000|$|... "Staying late,--staying late. <b>Six</b> {{or seven}} <b>o'clock</b> if necessary, putting your {{shoulder}} to the wheel when the coach gets into the mud. That's what I've been doing all my life. They've known what I am very well. They've always kept me for the heavy roads. If they paid, in the Civil Service, by the hour, I believe I should have drawn a larger income than any man in it. If you take the vacant chair {{in the next room}} you'll find it's no joke. It's only fair that I should tell you that." ...|$|R
50|$|Dinner starts {{when the}} first star appears in the sky. (This {{tradition}} is no longer common). Waiting for the star {{to appear in the}} sky symbolizes the Star of Bethlehem leading the shepherds to Bethlehem. Instead of a town, the star leads the members of the family to the table for dinner. If it is a cloudy night, the evening meal begins when the head of the house announces it is time to eat. Either way it is determined, the meal usually begins between <b>six</b> and seven <b>oâ€™clock.</b>|$|R
