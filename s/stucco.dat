5|$|The largest Maya sculptures {{consisted}} of architectural façades crafted from <b>stucco.</b> The rough form {{was laid out}} on a plain plaster base coating on the wall, and the three-dimensional form was built up using small stones. Finally, this was coated with <b>stucco</b> and moulded into the finished form; human body forms were first modelled in <b>stucco,</b> with their costumes added afterwards. The final <b>stucco</b> sculpture was then brightly painted. Giant <b>stucco</b> masks were used to adorn temple façades by the Late Preclassic, and such decoration continued into the Classic period.|$|E
5|$|The common {{element to}} both church and palazzi {{interior}} design was the <b>stucco</b> work. <b>Stucco</b> {{is an important}} component of the Baroque design and philosophy, as it seamlessly combines architecture, sculpture, and painting in three-dimensional form. Its combination with trompe l'oeil ceilings and walls in Baroque illusionistic painting confuses reality and art. While in churches the <b>stucco</b> could represent angels and putti linked by swags of flowers, in a private house it might represent the owner's favourite foods or musical instruments.|$|E
5|$|Excavations in {{the acropolis}} {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} at least two superimposed platforms built with finely dressed stone blocks and covered with good quality <b>stucco</b> flooring. At a later date the platforms and courtyard were covered with unworked stones bound with mortar and covered with another <b>stucco</b> floor. The two platforms were built in the Late Classic and appear to have been covered over in the Terminal Classic.|$|E

5|$|Minor {{alterations}} {{were made}} by the Caliphs Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah in 1009 and Al-Amir bi-Ahkami l-Lah in 1125. The Caliph al-Hafiz (1129–1149) made significant further changes, adding a fourth arcade with keel arches, and a dome with elaborate carved <b>stucco</b> decorations in front of the transept. Since then, the mosque has been greatly enlarged and modified over the years. Of the original building little remains other than the arcades and some of the <b>stucco</b> decoration.|$|E
5|$|Rideau Cottage is a two-level, 22-room Georgian Revival building. Originally, the {{structure}} had 14 rooms {{on a single}} floor. An 1872 remodel, using a different brick, added both the second level and a verandah on three sides of the ground floor. During that remodel, the exterior brick of the first floor was covered in <b>stucco</b> painted to appear like brick. (When the verandah was removed some time later, the <b>stucco</b> remained.) Between 1999 and 2000, the building underwent major renovations to the basement, roof and interior finishes, and the mechanical and electrical systems were upgraded. Outside, the <b>stucco</b> was removed and each brick and joint was individually dyed to give a uniform appearance. It was again renovated in 2013.|$|E

By 1746, it had acquired a new baroque exterior, while maintaining its original Byzantine interior. Six domes {{were added to the}} original single dome, but the added pressure on the walls was counteracted by the construction of buttresses. The remaining medieval walls, characterised by alternative layers of limestone and flat brick, were covered with <b>stucco.</b> Ivan Hryhorovych-Barskyi was responsible for window surrounds and <b>stucco</b> ornamentation.|$|E
