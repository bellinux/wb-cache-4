60|$|XXVI. In {{the drawing}} of the shafts of the door at Lisieux, under the spandril, in Plate VII., the reader will see the mode of {{managing}} the intersection of similar mouldings, which was universal in the great periods. They melted into each other, and became one {{at the point of}} crossing, or of contact; and even the suggestion of so sharp intersection as this of Lisieux is usually avoided (this design being, of course, only a pointed form of the earlier Norman arcade, in which the arches are interlaced, and lie each over the preceding, and under the following, one, as in Anselm's tower at Canterbury), since, in the plurality of designs, when mouldings meet each other, they coincide through some considerable portion of their curves, meeting by contact, rather than by intersection; and at the point of coincidence the section of each separate moulding becomes common to the two thus melted into each other. Thus, in the junction of the circles of the window of the Palazzo Foscari, Plate VIII., given accurately in fig. 8, Plate IV., the section across the line s, is exactly the same as that across any break of the separated moulding above, as [=s]. It sometimes, however, happens, that two different mouldings meet each other. This was seldom permitted in the great periods, and, when it took place, was most awkwardly managed. Fig. 1, Plate IV. gives the junction of the mouldings of the gable and vertical, in the window of the spire of Salisbury. That of the gable is composed of a single, and that of the vertical of a double cavetto, decorated with ball-flowers; and the larger <b>single</b> <b>moulding</b> swallows up one of the double ones, and pushes forward among the smaller balls with the most blundering and clumsy simplicity. In comparing the sections it is to be observed that, in the upper one, the line a b represents an actual vertical in the plane of the window; while, in the lower one, the line c d represents the horizontal, in the plane of the window, indicated by the perspective line d e.|$|E

40|$|Moulding is {{a process}} in which by pouring a molten metal into a mould cavity which is created by keeping the {{required}} shape of pattern on the molding sand and allowing the molten metal to solidify by cooling slowly. But in this process we can able to get only one shape of casting, it means shape of the final casting is limited. If we want more number of same design but not identical parts then it is not possible from a <b>single</b> <b>mould,</b> this drawback can be overcome by family moulding. This paper tells how can be able to get more number of same design but not identical parts. In another words we can say that two different parts can be produced from a <b>single</b> <b>mould.</b> This mould is called family mould. Family mould design consists of a complete mould with a few or many different cavity inserts that runs as a multiple part. Hence Family mould design for plastics levers is made here by using injection moulding machine for injection of molten plastic into mould cavity and UGNX 5 software for injection mould design for plastic levers...|$|R

The group's {{homogeneity}} was demonstrated by analysing {{the composition of the}} bronze of bull and leaper: both contain about 96% copper and 1.5% tin, with 1% zinc. The small amount of tin in the alloy would have made it difficult for the bronze to fill the mould, resulting in the missing lower legs of the leaper, and probably the arms. Stylistically, the group is coherent, since the arched back of the leaper mirrors the flying gallop posture of the bull.|$|R

40|$|Casting {{processes}} {{are among the}} most energy intensive manufacturing processes. A typical modern casting process contains different stages, classified as melting-alloying, moulding, pouring, solidification, fettling, machining and finishing respectively. At each stage, large amounts of energy are consumed. Since a number of different casting processes exist, it is not always straightforward which process chain to select among the available ones. Up to now the selection is based on cost criteria. This paper focuses on the different criteria that needs to be considered and how they can be simulated focusing especially on the energy and resource efficiency of casting stages.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{contains}} {{results of}} a comprehensive research and development programme aimed at an evaluation of static strength of a GRP railway bogie of a new advanced design.

The GRP bogie design consists of three main load carrying parts, namely two quite massive longitudinal side frames connected by a central transom plate which are manufactured in a <b>single</b> <b>moulding</b> operation using the resin transfer moulding (RTM) method. Since the component is unusually thick, all parameters of the RTM method have to be well balanced.

Therefore, testing of this subcomponent was {{an important part of the}} bogie development.

40|$|Plastics {{processes}} play {{an important}} and irreplaceable role in manufacturing industry {{as well as our}} daily lives. This paper focuses on the plastics forming processes with a focus on moulding processes. An overview of some basic plastics forming processes, their products and production capacities, is presented. These processes include extrusion, blow moulding, rotational moulding, compression moulding, transfer moulding, thermoforming and injection moulding. The future trend is envisaged with respect to the forming processes, machinery, moulds and materials. Also highlighted is the computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology being used by the industry. Some leading CAD/CAM packages are reviewed in light of their capabilities and applicability. The paper also lays an emphasis on the status of the New Zealand situation in the plastics forming industry. A survey showed that the New Zealand plastics industry involves over 400 enterprises, mostly small. The majority of them only operate a <b>single</b> <b>moulding</b> process, with injection moulding being the principal process.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the aggregate production-distribution {{problem for a}} manufacturer of plastic products that are produced using injection moulding. For each product, only a <b>single</b> <b>mould</b> is available, but by exchanging moulds between plants, {{it is possible to}} produce any product at any plant. This mould sharing offers opportunities for cost savings but complicates the aggregate production-distribution planning.

The main goal of this aggregate planning tool is to quantify the opportunities that mould sharing offers to the plastics manufacturer. Computational experiments based on a real-life dataset confirm that mould sharing can reduce the production-distribution total cost with about 10 %, and that the suggested matheuristic is capable of generating solutions that capture most of this significant savings potential. © 2013 Elsevier B.

According to Rodney Dale, the upper shell mould was [...] "one of the largest – if not the largest – injection mouldings of its type in the UK: possibly even in the world".

Although Sinclair had considered producing the C5 at the DeLorean plant at Dunmurry in Northern Ireland, which had one of Europe's most advanced automated plastic-body manufacturing facilities, this was not to be, as the DeLorean Motor Company failed in a controversial bankruptcy that resulted in the plant's closure.|$|R

The results showed that the controlled permeability formwork (CPF) liner produced the fewest blowholes and was the best performing technology used in that respect. As a consequence of this, CPF provided the most likely finish that would provide long term durability.
