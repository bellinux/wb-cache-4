The justification, {{according}} to East Germany, {{was that this}} was compensation for the money invested by the state in the prisoner's training. For a while, payments were made in kind using goods that were in short supply in East Germany, such as oranges, bananas, coffee and medical drugs. The average prisoner was worth around 4,000DM worth of goods.|$|E

Belle Vue {{became a part of}} the caterer and hotelier Charles Forte's business empire towards the end of its life in the 1960s. Although he made some improvements to the zoo, Forte's interests lay in developing the gardens' dining and exhibition facilities. The Kings Hall was then the largest exhibition space outside London, but competition from the G-Mex exhibition and conference centre in central Manchester led directly to its closure in 1987.|$|E

5|$|In {{anticipation}} of the areas surrounding the bridge becoming prosperous suburbs, tolls were set at relatively high rates on a sliding <b>scale,</b> <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> a penny for pedestrians to 2s6d for vehicles drawn by six horses. Exemptions were granted for mail coaches, soldiers on duty and parliamentary candidates during election campaigns. However, {{the area around the}} bridge failed to develop as expected. In 1815 John Doulton built the Doulton & Watts (later Royal Doulton) stoneware factory at Vauxhall, and consequently instead of the wealthy residents anticipated by the company, the area began to fill with narrow streets of working class tenements to house the factory's workers. Meanwhile, the large Millbank Penitentiary was built near the northern end of the bridge, discouraging housing development. Consequently, toll revenues were initially lower than expected, and the dividends paid to investors were low.|$|E
5|$|In {{solid-phase}} synthesis, an oligonucleotide being assembled is covalently bound, via its 3'-terminal hydroxy group, to a {{solid support}} material and remains {{attached to it}} over the entire course of the chain assembly.

The overwhelming majority of oligonucleotides are synthesized on small <b>scale</b> <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> 10nmol to 1μmol. More recently, high-throughput oligonucleotide synthesis where the solid support is contained in the wells of multi-well plates (most often, 96 or 384 wells per plate) became a method of choice for parallel synthesis of oligonucleotides on small scale. At the end of the chain assembly, the oligonucleotide is released from the solid support and is eluted from the column or the well.|$|E
5|$|Entertainment {{is a form}} of {{activity}} that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but {{is more likely to be}} one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any <b>scale,</b> <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.|$|E

25|$|There are two {{proposed}} {{scales for}} quantifying {{the significance of}} transmissions between Earth and potential extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI). The Rio <b>Scale,</b> <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> 0 to 10, was proposed in 2000 {{as a means of}} quantifying the significance of a SETI detection. The scale was designed by Iván Almár and Jill Tarter to help policy-makers formulate an initial judgment on a detection’s potential consequences. The scale borrows heavily from the Torino Scale, which is used to categorize the hazard of impact of near-earth objects (NEOs). The IAA SETI Permanent Study Group officially adopted this scale both as a means of bringing perspective to claims of ETI detection and as an acknowledgement that even false ETI detections could have disastrous consequences, which should be mitigated.|$|E
