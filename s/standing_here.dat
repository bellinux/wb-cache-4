500|$|Tipping the Velvet {{was adapted}} into a BBC {{television}} drama serial {{of the same}} name, originally screened in three episodes on BBC Two in 2002. It was produced for the BBC by the independent production company Sally Head Productions, and starred Rachael Stirling as Nan, Keeley Hawes as Kitty, Anna Chancellor as Diana, and Jodhi May as Florence. The BBC had previously adapted Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit in 1990 and some other scenes in dramas to follow, but none had been so explicit. Sally Head Productions defended the decision to air the entire program uncut. Waters was quite surprised that the BBC chose to produce and broadcast a television adaptation that faithfully followed the relish and detail of sexual escapades in the book. Stirling thoroughly enjoyed the role, despite her avowed heterosexuality: [...] "To counteract any hard-core sex within it, there's a huge sense of humour and a huge sense of fun and frivolity and joy of life. It was so utterly believable that you never for a moment thought, Fuck, there's no reason why I'm <b>standing</b> <b>here</b> naked." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2010–11 NHL season, the NHL and NHLPA honoured Näslund with a tribute and {{ceremonial}} puck drop prior to a game held in Stockholm, Sweden, between the San Jose Sharks and Columbus Blue Jackets. Several months later, the Canucks retired his number 19 jersey prior to a home game against the Tampa Bay Lightning on 11 December 2010. Attending the on-ice ceremony were his wife, three children, parents and sister, as well as former Canucks teammates, coaches and executives. The night included a video tribute highlighting his hockey career, speeches from team personalities and gift presentations from the organization. In honour of Näslund and his wife's past philanthropy in the Vancouver community, the team also announced the establishment of a sports equipment centre for underprivileged children. [...] Prior to the jersey raising, Näslund thanked those involved in his career. Reflecting on his career, he commented, [...] "Young hockey players from northern Sweden never dream of a night like this...To go from sitting up in the press box as a healthy scratch to be <b>standing</b> <b>here</b> in front of you is quite amazing." [...] By having his jersey retired, he became the third player in team history to receive the honour, after Stan Smyl and Trevor Linden.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "All the Lovers" [...] is an electropop-influenced disco track. Minogue's breathy and whisper-y vocal {{delivery}} and the electronic {{production of the}} song make it similar to [...] "I Believe in You", a single from Minogue's greatest hits album Ultimate Kylie (2004). Through the lyrics of the song, Minogue invites her lover to dance with her, beginning with a line in which she softly sings [...] "Dance, it's all I wanna do, so won't you dance? I'm <b>standing</b> <b>here</b> with you, why won't you move?". During the anthemic chorus of the song, which is backed by a warbling synthesizer riff, Minogue asserts that her previous relationships do not [...] "compare" [...] to her present one, singing [...] "All the lovers that have gone before, they don't compare to you/ Don't be frightened, {{just give me a}} little bit more/ They don't compare, all the lovers." [...] UK-based music website Popjustice opined that the song is [...] "not really about relaxing while you dance, it's about relaxing into a relationship." [...] Fraser McAlpine from BBC Chart Blog felt the [...] "elegiac" [...] and sad-toned chorus [...] "makes the verses transform from a straightforward plea for dancefloor action into what sounds like a demand that everyone join Kylie for one last dance before things become spoiled forever." [...] The song features a bridge section in which Minogue again asks her lover to dance with her, after which an electronic breakdown takes place. According to the sheet music of the song published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "All the Lovers" [...] is composed in the key of C major and follows a midtempo of 142 beats per minute. Minogue's vocal range spans from the key of G3 to A4.|$|E

When Sherman died, Johnston served as an honorary pallbearer at his funeral; during the procession in New York City on February 19, 1891, he kept his hat off as a sign of respect in the cold, rainy weather. Someone with concern for the old general's health asked him to put on his hat, to which Johnston replied [...] "If I were in his place and he were <b>standing</b> <b>here</b> in mine, he would not put on his hat."

News agencies cited tweets that misidentified her as Muslim or Arab, associated her with groups such as Al-Qaeda, and questioned why she was chosen over Miss Kansas Theresa Vail. Davuluri said that she was prepared for the social media response because [...] "as Miss New York, I was called a terrorist and very similar remarks." [...] Davuluri is the second Miss Syracuse to win the title after Miss New York 1983, Vanessa Lynn Williams who was the first African American winner and Miss America 1984.

In addition, Congressperson Grace Meng compared Davuluri to Miss New York 1945, Bess Myerson (the first and to date only Jewish-American winner and Miss America 1945) who also faced bigotry during her time as Miss America.|$|E
