5|$|The papal entourage {{arrived in}} Trier on 30 November 1147, but shortly after arrival the pope {{decided to move}} the {{proceedings}} because of complaints from the residents of Trier, and announced in February 1148 that the council would move to Reims, but still on the date given before. A feature of the council was that the pope ordered the attendance of the various bishops and other officials. Although some requested attendees were excused, it was mostly due to ill health, not {{to the need to}} <b>see</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> business of their offices. Those who did not attend were suspended from office. The Italian bishops, however, were mostly excused from attendance, as Eugene held a council at Cremona in July 1148 where the Reims decrees were announced.|$|E

25|$|The Act was {{immediately}} recognised by the labourers, {{who for the}} first time held both active and passive electoral franchise, as a means to achieving their interests and facilitating those who desired to help them on local county councils.

A hearing was held to revoke Kahane's probation for a 1971 incendiary device-making incident. He {{was found guilty of}} violating probation and served a one-year prison sentence.

25|$|Karen Michaelis, {{ten years}} or so before {{the day of the}} {{previous}} section, is sailing from her native England to visit her Aunt Violet and Uncle Bill Bent at Rushbrook, County Cork, Ireland. Karen is escaping the pressures of her recent engagement to Ray Forrestier, ambivalent about the wedding; Ray himself is on a business trip. Her time with Uncle Bill and Aunt Violet is rather uneventful and uninspiring until Uncle Bill, a nervous and socially inadequate man, tells Karen that Violet is to have surgery in the coming weeks, a procedure that could prove fatal. Back in England, Karen finds Naomi Fisher waiting for her; she has travelled to London to <b>see</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> affairs of her recently deceased aunt, and tells Karen of her engagement to Max Ebhart, whom Karen met years before while {{she was one of the}} girls staying at Mme Fisher's house. Despite Karen's objections — she had always been afraid of Max — Naomi insists the three spend time together before Max and Naomi return home.|$|E

Bennett expressed his view that [...] "the only resolution I can <b>see</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> North Korean nuclear and other threats is for the North Korean government to eventually go away", which he felt would be likeliest to occur following an assassination of Kim. Lynton replied that a senior figure in the United States Department of State agreed. Bennett responded that the office of Robert R.
