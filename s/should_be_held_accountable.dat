Lollardy was a politico-religious movement initiated by prominent theologian John Wycliffe in the 1370s during his {{service in the}} University of Oxford. Lollard beliefs were outlined in the 1395 The Twelve Conclusions of the Lollards, which dealt with their opposition to capital punishment, rejection of religious celibacy, and belief {{that members of the}} Clergy <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> to civil laws. The Conclusions also rejected pilgrimages, ornamentation of churches, and religious images because these were said to take away from the true nature of worship, focus on God. Also denounced in the Conclusions were war, violence, and abortion.|$|E
500|$|Qualification for the 2008 European Championship {{proved too}} much, England losing the final {{qualifier}} against Croatia 3–2 in November 2007, when a draw {{would have been}} enough to take England to the finals. The British press turned on McClaren, former Scottish international Alan Hansen stating that [...] "...what McClaren <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> for is that with a squad of this quality he failed to qualify from what seemed a reasonably straightforward group...". McClaren was sacked the day following the defeat to Croatia, and was replaced in December 2007 by Italian Fabio Capello.|$|E

500|$|Federal {{district}} judge David L. Bunning of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, the judge {{assigned to the}} cases, held hearings with Davis in Ashland, at which {{she was the only}} witness. Davis argued tearfully that issuing licenses under her name violated her beliefs, citing her religious rights under the First Amendment: [...] "It wasn't just a spur-of-the-moment decision", she said. [...] "It was thought out, and I sought God on it." [...] Davis had already decided against resigning from her post, as doing so, she said, would only leave the matter to her deputies: [...] "If I resign, I solve nothing. It helps nobody." [...] Governor Beshear stated that he would not call a special session of the General Assembly to address Davis' concerns, while other state legislators believed that such a session could accommodate Davis with possible new legislation. Davis' attorneys, from the Maitland, Florida-based law firm Liberty Counsel, stated that the plaintiffs were free to drive to other counties to obtain their same-sex marriage licenses, with one adding, [...] "This case is not about these plaintiffs' desires to get married, the case is about [...] desire to force Kim Davis to approve and authorize their marriage in violation of her constitutionally protected religious beliefs." [...] Davis and her attorneys then sued Governor Beshear for ordering her to violate her religious beliefs instead of trying to accommodate them, arguing that Beshear, not Davis, <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> for any legal damages from the ACLU lawsuit.|$|E
500|$|Both campaigns {{began to}} use their running mates to attack the other candidate. Republican Vice Presidential nominee Spiro Agnew criticized the current Vice President for being [...] "soft on communism" [...] and [...] "soft on {{inflation}} and soft on law and order." [...] He then compared the nominee to former British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. But Agnew often made gaffes on the campaign trail, in contrast to Muskie who {{was viewed as a}} natural campaigner. In Missouri, in preparation for a meeting with former President Harry Truman, Muskie tried to defend his running mate from connections made by the Nixon campaign to the Johnson administration. He reversed the accusation by claiming that Nixon <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> for the shortcomings of the Eisenhower Administration, under his logic. He then lambasted the Republican ticket for ignoring such issues as urban renewal, housing, and federal aid for education and sewage. Muskie was renowned for his speaking ability, and was known to turn around hostile crowds including one well publicized event when he asked an anti-war protester to join him on the stage. Although he provided a small boost for the campaign, Nixon remained fifteen points ahead, 44% to 29% in the September 27 Gallup poll. Diplomat George W. Ball soon resigned his position in the Johnson administration to campaign for and advise Humphrey, hoping to prevent a Nixon victory. At the end of September, Humphrey's chances for the presidency further declined as media outlets observed that the Republican Party would be the likely winners in the election. Humphrey acknowledged his odds, proclaiming at an event in Boston: [...] "regardless of the outcome of this election, I want it to be said of Hubert Humphrey that at an important and tough moment of his life he stood up for what he believed and was not shouted down." [...] The comment drew boos from the crowd. Individuals close to the campaign noted that Humphrey looked tired and worn-out while flying from stop to stop, but would brighten up when he encountered a crowd.|$|E

50|$|Causal moral luck, which equates largely {{with the}} problem of free will, is the least-detailed of the {{varieties}} that Thomas Nagel describes.

50|$|One {{critique}} is {{that the}} Federal Open Market Committee, {{which is part of}} the Federal Reserve System, lacks transparency and is not sufficiently audited. A report by Bloomberg News asserts that the majority of Americans believes that the System <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> more <b>accountable</b> or that it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> abolished. Another critique is the contention that the public should have a right to know what goes on in the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings.|$|R
2500|$|Feminist {{science and}} {{technology}} studies (STS) refers to the transdisciplinary field {{of research on the}} ways gender and other markers of identity intersect with technology, science, and culture.

[...] Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi expressed the Iraqi government's opposition to the intervention: [...] "This (Yemen war) can engulf the whole region in another conflict. We don't need another sectarian war in the region." [...] The Hezbollah secretary general criticized Saudi Arabia and its allies, saying [...] "all invaders end up being defeated".|$|E

Saying that [...] "Most governors and mayors {{would love to be}} able to manage their team without the interference of collective bargaining", Fenty expressed his faith in the ability of managers to set fair wages and hours, and to fairly reward or hold their employees accountable. He also said that the Democratic Wisconsin senators <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> for leaving the state to delay the enactment of Walker's legislation.|$|E

In contrast, in green capitalism, the government would have more control therefore; consumers do not have direct power over the market, and <b>should</b> not <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>accountable.</b> Thus, going against the established monetary system of capitalism in the U.S. and spread throughout the globally.|$|R

The result was that strong public pressure eventually forced Meir's and Dayan's resignation, {{despite the fact that}} they were not officially implicated in the Agranat Commission's report. Many also cite the fact that Elazar was able to maintain his cool during the difficult early days of the war as one of the leading factors that eventually led to Israel's comeback.|$|R

He had an almost savage desire to hear her complain of her husband--hear her say that she <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> for Lord Warburton's defection. Ralph was certain that this was her situation; he knew by instinct, in advance, the form that in such an event Osmond's displeasure would take. It could only take the meanest and cruellest. He would have liked to warn Isabel of it--to let her see at least how he judged for her and how he knew. It little mattered that Isabel would know much better; it was for his own satisfaction more than for hers that he longed to show her he was not deceived. He tried and tried again to make her betray Osmond; he felt cold-blooded, cruel, dishonourable almost, in doing so. But it scarcely mattered, for he only failed. What had she come for then, and why did she seem almost to offer him a chance to violate their tacit convention? Why did she ask him his advice if she gave him no liberty to answer her? How could they talk of her domestic embarrassments, as it pleased her humorously to designate them, if the principal factor was not to be mentioned? These contradictions were themselves but an indication of her trouble, and her cry for help, just before, was the only thing he was bound to consider. [...] "You'll be decidedly at variance, all the same," [...] he said in a moment. And as she answered nothing, looking as if she scarce understood, [...] "You'll find yourselves thinking very differently," [...] he continued.|$|E
