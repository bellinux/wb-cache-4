5000|$|The {{first sign}} of a {{foot-rot}} infection is when the skin between the claws of the hoof begins to swell (cellulitis). Swelling usually appears 24 hours after infection. The skin between the toes may be very red and tender and the toes may separate {{because of all the}} swelling. This is very painful to the animal and can cause lameness. The animal may also have a raised body temperature. A crack can develop along the infected part and is yellow in color. The foot will have a foul odor. Tendons and joints in the area can become infected, which is much harder to treat. A condition known as [...] "super foot rot" [...] is seen in some animals. <b>Super</b> <b>foot</b> rot infection occurs much faster and is usually much more severe. Most normal foot rot treatments will not cure this foot rot and a veterinarian should be contacted immediately.|$|E
50|$|Due to Mount Molloy Ltd's new found {{interest}} in the timber industry, in December 1907 Anthony Linedale, one of {{the directors of the}} company, corresponded with the Director of Forests, Queensland Department of Public Lands, about the activities of Mount Molloy Ltd and its timber requirements. He noted that the company employed 173 men at the mine, 124 men at the smelters and refiners, 17 officers, 18 teamsters, 10 wood-getters, 19 men at the Biboohra railway yard and 320 men building the Molloy railway. That month the Director of Forests recommended that 10,000,000 superficial feet (1 <b>super</b> <b>foot</b> is a volume of timber representing 2360 cm3) be sold without competition to Mount Molloy Ltd, over 5 years, with a minimum removal of 30,000 super feet per month; the royalty to be a 25 per cent advance on the minimum royalties prescribed by the timber regulations for that district. The timber concession covered 16,000 acres (6474.97 hectares) of Crown land north of Mount Molloy. On 6 March 1908 an agreement on the concession was made between Mount Molloy Ltd and Alexander Patrick Cameron, Land Commissioner for the district of Cairns, with royalties to be paid each month from June 1908. One condition, which Mount Molloy Ltd later regretted, was that all timber cut had to be sawn within Queensland. The inability to export logs later led to kauri logs being stockpiled at Mount Molloy.|$|E
5000|$|In 1952 the Yalu saw-mill, near Lae, is {{reported}} to have converted 3.031,766 <b>super</b> <b>feet</b> of logs for recovery of 1,265,172 <b>super</b> <b>feet</b> of sawn timber. Exports of sewn timber amounted to nearly 1,400,000 <b>super</b> <b>feet</b> during 1953-54 and the log export totalled 775,149 <b>super</b> <b>feet.</b> The Forestry Ordinance 1936-1951, provides for the issue of permits and licences to cut timber on [...] "sound forestry principals" ...|$|R

50|$|However, {{the right}} to cut timber meant that the new railway at least had {{something}} to transport, as the smelters had closed {{by the end of}} 1908 for lack of ore, and the mine itself closed in late 1910. The 5 year timber concession allowed Mount Molloy Ltd to stay afloat, and in the company's report for the half year to 31 December 1908, presented in April 1909, it was stated that contract teamsters were hauling timber from the company's concession. In addition, a bullock team, two horse teams and a traction engine were under company control. The timber extracted included hickory, cadagi, kauri pine, and red cedar; over 2 million <b>super</b> <b>feet</b> of logs were delivered to the depot, while 882,574 <b>super</b> <b>feet</b> were despatched by rail during the half year.|$|R
5000|$|The entire Jimna {{operation}} including timber cutters {{was controlled}} by Hancock and Gore Ltd. Once re-erected in 1922, the mill at Jimna was enlarged and in 1924 it was capable of turning out 80,000 <b>super</b> <b>feet</b> of sawn pine weekly. Initially the mill cut only hoop pine using steam-driven saws. In 1933 the Architectural and Building Journal of Queensland reported that Jimna Mill milled approximately 23,000 feet of logs into wide boards and building timbers each day while the top logs were milled into case timber. At Brisbane the building timbers were planed on Hancock and Gore's planning machines and manufactured into all kinds of building timbers including lining boards and flooring. The case timbers were re-sawn and manufactured into butter boxes, jam cases, fruit cases, kerosene cases etc. Specially selected logs were transported to Brisbane for manufacture into [...] "Bull-dog" [...] plywood and Hancock and Gore Ltd high class joinery. Bringing timber to the mill were 15 bullock teams and 11 lorries, while five lorries delivered the sawn and seasoned timber to Kilcoy railway station for transportation to Hancock and Gore establishments in Brisbane. The record for the greatest daily output of pine was 48,000 <b>super</b> <b>feet</b> in 8 hours and for 10 hours work {{on the same day}} the cut was 64,500 <b>super</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|R
50|$|On {{the night}} of 9 July 1897, the Canungra mill burnt down and 20,000 <b>super</b> <b>feet</b> of sawn and dressed pine in the mill yards was destroyed. The mill was re-built but at a larger scale and was more modern in layout than the {{original}} mill, with the planing machine and other machinery separated from the main milling activities.|$|R
25|$|The Australian Forestry Group {{moved to}} Sussex in mid-1943. Shortly {{afterwards}} the Group departed the UK for Australia. By {{the time it}} left the UK the Australians had produced 30 million <b>super</b> <b>feet</b> of sawn timber. The foresters paraded through New York City in September 1943 while en-route to Australia. Following their return to Australia in November, the forest companies were deployed to the Northern Territory and New Guinea where they operated sawmills.|$|R
50|$|As timber felling and {{sawmilling}} {{had provided}} {{the capital to}} continue the company's mining operation, the approaching end of Mount Molloy Ltd's 5 year timber concession meant that the company went into liquidation on 3 March 1913. Despite the expiry of the original timber concession the liquidators (including John Moffat from December 1915) were allowed to continue cutting timber (excluding cedar) from December 1913, up to the 10 million <b>super</b> <b>feet</b> agreed to in 1908, or until the government purchased the railway to Mount Molloy.|$|R
50|$|By 1920 much of {{the timber}} {{had been removed from}} the Canungra area. In 1920, the War Service Homes Commission {{purchased}} the whole milling operation and before long, closed the mill. David Lahey's company Brisbane Timbers Ltd, however, took over the remaining timber harvesting operations and the tramway was used sporadically for a few more years. Trips along the tramway by sightseers are recorded up till 1930. By June 1933, the line was being dismantled. In 1935, the rails and bogies were sold for scrap. During its period of use, the tramway collectively hauled approximately 130 million <b>super</b> <b>feet</b> of timber.|$|R
50|$|The Hornibrook Highway {{included}} a long timber bridge (the heritage-listed Hornibrook Highway Bridge) across Hay's Inlet and {{the mouth of}} the North Pine River between Brighton and Clontarf. At the time, it was Australia's longest bridge and was claimed to incorporate more hardwood than any other bridge of its kind. To provide more than 2.5 million <b>super</b> <b>feet</b> of timber needed for the bridge, Hornibrook secured large stands of hardwood, purchased a mill at Mapleton and built the Conondale mill in the midst of large tracts of standing timber. The Conondale mill was designed to produce decking.|$|R
50|$|In March 1926, {{the year}} Queensland began to {{formally}} regulate {{the amount of}} timber that could be cut in State Forests and Timber Reserves, Spencer negotiated with the Queensland Provisional Forestry Board to procure 10 million <b>super</b> <b>feet</b> of hoop pine timber from State Forest Reserve 154, adjacent to Reserve 81. In conjunction with this agreement, Spencer received permission from the Lands Department and Kilkivan Shire Council to establish a large sawmill at an estimated cost of £12 000, with a special lease of five years. In September 1926, Spencer's lease was extended to seven years, while the area of land under lease was enlarged to encompass {{the whole of the}} reserve.|$|R
50|$|As {{built in}} 1956, the kiln {{comprised}} a steam heated, cross shaft internal fan design that was common in Australia at the time. The design {{was obtained by}} the company from CSIRO. It consisted of four double chambers 64 ft (19.5m) by 48 ft (14.6m) each with a height of 13 ft (4m) and a capacity of 9000 <b>super</b> <b>feet.</b> They were fabricated from concrete. Carefully stacked timber was transferred into the kiln using trolleys on rails. Heat was generated by a 100 hp (74.6 kW) boiler and transferred to the kiln chambers {{by a series of}} tubes. Hot air radiating from the tubes was circulated in the chambers by internal electric fans. The temperature in the kiln was designed to reach around 120 °F (49 °C).|$|R

50|$|By 1920 much of {{the forest}} timber had been {{cut out of the}} Brisbane Valley and the major {{industry}} was dairying. Accordingly, in the 1920s, the railway was transporting cream to the butter factories along the Brisbane Valley line - Colinton until 1921, Toogoolawah, Esk and Lowood. Whole milk was transported to the Nestle and Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Factory at Toogoolawah until its closure in 1930. However, on the Blackbutt Range timber was still being cut and transported via rail. In 1934 The Courier-Mail reported increased timber haulage from railway loading centres between Benarkin and Yarraman. The amount was more than 1,500,000 <b>super</b> <b>feet</b> per month over the prior 12 months and formed the biggest proportion of freight on the Brisbane Valley railway line. All the timber was being cut from Crown reserves as privately held land was practically cut out. Most of the timber was sent to Brisbane for milling.|$|R
5000|$|Transporting {{the timber}} was {{initially}} the most problematic {{aspect of the}} operation at Mill Point. Bullock teams became bogged in the saturated, sandy soils and Cootharaba Road had swampy sections, steep pinches and seven miles of scrub along Kin Kin and Tinana Creeks. The difficulties of Cootharaba Road were resolved {{with the establishment of}} an outlet by sea via a depot at Tewantin, which was managed by Goodchap. Flat-bottomed paddle-wheel boats known as droghers, (the [...] "Black Swan", [...] "Countess of Belmore" [...] and [...] "Elanda"), towed punts of sawn timber through Lakes Cootharaba and Cooroibah to Tewantin, where the timber was loaded onto the firm's steamer, the [...] "S.S. Culgoa" [...] and taken to Brisbane three times a fortnight with loads of up to 35,000 <b>super</b> <b>feet</b> of timber. The S.S. Culgoa was built in Adelaide in 1865 and used on the Darling and Murrumbidgee Rivers before acquisition by McGhie, Luya and Co. The Company established [...] "Noosa Sawmill" [...] at South Brisbane in the early 1880s and the S.S. Culgoa carried passengers, general cargo and sawn timber on each trip between Tewantin and Brisbane until completion of the Brisbane-Gympie railway link in 1891.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1900s {{there were no}} church {{buildings}} in Malanda and any services or religious ceremonies were held in the hall next to the hotel. In 1925 the Catholic community of which the English family were staunch members, decided to build a church. At a meeting on the 9 August 1925 a building committee was formed {{to attend to the}} construction of a Catholic church. At subsequent meetings it was decided to build a church that could accommodate 200 people. Mr Hassell was commissioned to draw up plans and specifications and Mr Lynch was appointed foreman of works. Mr Halfpapp was deputed to build the church {{with the help of a}} permanent assistant, at the rate of 2 pounds 7 shillings per day for the two, with the additional help of three men for two weeks to start the work off. The building was to have a concrete floor with ironbark blocks. The outside walls were to be of water gum chamfers, and the ceiling and lining of bull oak, with all other timbers to be left to Mr Hassell to determine. At later meetings, the proposal for a concrete floor was altered to that of a wooden floor, and the further suggestion was made that a choir gallery be included in the plans, if the estimate did not exceed £1,000. Timber mills from Millaa Millaa, Glen Allyn, Kureen, Yungaburra and Malanda were asked to tender for the supply of timber. The tender was given to P English of Malanda who agreed to supply and deliver all timber to the site for 48 shillings per 100 <b>super</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|R

It combines with DaiBouken in place of GoGo Marine to form DaiBouken Mixer. It used Agitation Shoot (Ajitēshon Shūto) to immobilize multiple Bouken Blue copies while uncombined and Wall Shoot (Wōru Shūto) to cover a burning warehouse (Wicked Dragon Dryken was the culprit) in a layer of Hyper Concrete (Haipā Konkurīto) when part of DaiBouken Mixer, and later as <b>Super</b> DaiBouken's right <b>foot,</b> to squander an ambush attempt by Gajya and Wicked Dragon Girado.

The Star Five's lower legs becomes the <b>Super</b> Five Robo's <b>foot</b> and lower legs, what increases the robot's size to roughly 1.4 times the Five Robo's size. The upper legs, along the back landing wheels forms the arms (despite the fact of his hands seems to be [...] "real", closed hands in the series, and not the Star Five's four-segmented upper legs like in the toy). The Star Five's arms and body makes the body armor (with the Star Five's cabin as the chest) and the helmet. The Star Five's shield and gun components do not join in the formation. It is armed with the Jet Knuckles (Jetto Nakkuru), Super Five Beam, and it destroys monsters with its ultimate finishing attack, the Super Vector Punch (Sūpā Bekutoru Panchi). It was first used to destroy the monster Bar-rugin. It was temporarily destroyed in episode 44 by the giant robot Big Garoan, but it returned at episode 47. It was the last standing force to destroy Vulgyre in the end.|$|R
