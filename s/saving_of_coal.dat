5000|$|Compared to {{some other}} {{experimental}} steam locomotives of the era such as the LNER Class W1, Turbomotive was relatively successful, showing a <b>saving</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> compared to a normal reciprocating engine and no hammer blow on the track. Because steam turbines are highly inefficient when throttled (not a problem on steamships, where turbines typically run at constant output, but a major disadvantage for a railway locomotive which has to run at different speeds), power was instead controlled by turning on a different number of nozzles (from the six available) through which steam {{was admitted to the}} turbine. One disadvantage of the design was that the small reverse turbine only had sufficient power for manoeuvring [...] "light engine" [...] and the locomotive always had to be turned to face forwards in order to pull a train.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- Flexible AC Transmission (FACTS) {{devices are}} {{installed}} in the transmission network to divert the power flow, minimize the power losses and to improve the line performance but it has some limitations and drawbacks. Distributed Flexible AC Transmission (D-FACTS) is a improved version of FACTS devices {{which is used to}} improve the security and reliability of the network in a cost effective manner. This paper discusses the concept of D-FACTS technology for saving of electrical energy, minimization of losses, reduction of coal consumption and minimization of environmental pollution from thermal power plants. This paper also discusses comparative evaluation of passive and active approaches in design of controllers for transmission line. Analysis also deals with computer simulation for reactances, equivalent voltages required for injection in the transmission line, and number of distributed modules per conductor per kilometre. Computations for <b>saving</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> and associated environmental pollution have been achieved. System details are presented in the paper along with simulation results.

The shortage <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> in many localities has been due as much to shortage of cars to haul it as to scarcity <b>of</b> <b>coal.</b> The more wood is burned the less coal will need to be transported and the more cars will be released for other needed service.

Impressed by the {{capacity}} of the new Prussian G 10 0-10-0 heavy freight locomotives, Aspinall wrote to Hughes requesting a report on the extent of double-heading for the trans-Pennine coal traffic, which Hughes provided in September. Inspired by recent work in Belgium, which had shown <b>savings</b> <b>of</b> 19% in <b>coal</b> consumption by avoiding it, Hughes suggested the use of a single large locomotive, emphasised the need to use it at full capacity and also rejected a proposed concept for a 2-8-2 in favour of a 2-10-0.|$|R

Many railway administrations converted their steam engines to Giesl ejectors, including the ÖBB, ČSD and Deutsche Reichsbahn (DR) in East Germany, as well as railway companies in Africa, China and Japan. The licence fees were not paid in every case, it being said that often they almost cancelled out the saving in coal. In the DR it was assessed that the Giesl ejectors would pay for themselves within a year, as a result of which they converted over 500 locomotives; primarily the Classes 38.10, 50, 52 and 65.10.|$|R
