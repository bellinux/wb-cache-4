5|$|According to Herodotus, Pausanias {{refused to}} advance because good omens were not divined in the goat sacrifices that were performed.

5|$|By September 5, the Salvation Army, Red Cross, {{and other}} {{organizations}} had served 100,000 meals to those displaced by the hurricane in Mississippi, and federal food stocks became available {{for the state to}} distribute to storm victims. Still, resources such as food and ice <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> short in the hardest-hit locations, and long lines formed at the first few stores and gas stations to reopen. With dwindling supplies, the Salvation Army had to procure food {{from other parts of the}} region to serve to victims.

5|$|Casualties {{were around}} 2,000, {{as the men}} were {{subjected}} to fire from the cliffs above. Problems clearing the beach of obstructions led to the beachmaster calling a halt to further landings of vehicles at 08:30. A group of destroyers arrived around this time to provide fire support so landings could resume. Exit from the beach was possible only via five heavily defended gullies, and by late morning barely 600 men had reached the higher ground. By noon, as the artillery fire took its toll and the Germans <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> out of ammunition, the Americans were able to clear some lanes on the beaches. They also started clearing the gullies of enemy defences so that vehicles could move off the beach. The tenuous beachhead was expanded over the following days, and the D-Day objectives for Omaha were accomplished by D+3.|$|E

Three boats were recorded as trading between Driffield and Hull every other day in a directory of Yorkshire published in 1823. Traffic for 1832 included 7,394 chaldrons of coal, 18,173 quarters of wheat, 7,745 quarters of oats, 19,396 quarters of barley and 4,555 sacks of flour. An additional 1,564 quarters of wheat and 8,194 sacks of flour were carried to or from Foston Mill, reached from Frodingham Beck.

5|$|O'Neill founded Geostar Corporation {{to develop}} a {{satellite}} position determination system {{for which he was}} granted a patent in 1982. The system, primarily intended to track aircraft, was called Radio Determination Satellite Service (RDSS). In April 1983 Geostar applied to the FCC for a license to broadcast from three satellites, which would cover the entire United States. Geostar launched GSTAR-2 into geosynchronous orbit in 1986. Its transmitter package permanently failed two months later, so Geostar began tests of RDSS by transmitting from other satellites. With his health failing, O'Neill became less involved with the company {{at the same time it}} <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> into trouble. In February 1991 Geostar filed for bankruptcy and its licenses were sold to Motorola for the Iridium satellite constellation project. Although the system was eventually replaced by GPS, O'Neill made significant advances in the field of position determination.|$|E
5|$|Omaha, {{the most}} heavily defended sector, was {{assigned}} to the U.S. 1st Infantry Division, supplemented by troops from the U.S. 29th Infantry Division. They faced the 352nd Infantry Division, rather than the expected single regiment. Strong currents forced many landing craft east of their intended position or delayed them. Casualties were heavier than all the other landings combined, as the men were subjected to fire from the cliffs above. Problems clearing the beach of obstructions led to the beachmaster calling a halt to further landings of vehicles at 08:30. A group of destroyers arrived around this time to offer supporting artillery fire. Exit from Omaha was possible only via five gullies, and by late morning barely six hundred men had reached the higher ground. By noon, as the artillery fire took its toll and the Germans <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> out of ammunition, the Americans were able to clear some lanes on the beaches. They also started clearing the draws of enemy defences so that vehicles could move off the beach.

5|$|Folklorist John F. Campbell noted a {{story told}} on Islay, {{one of the}} Inner Hebridean islands, which {{demonstrates}} the usefulness of having a water bull. Just after a calf was born to an ordinary cow, an elderly lady, later identified as a witch, advised the herdsman to keep it separate from the other cattle, presumably after she noticed its deformed ears and suspected it was a water bull. She instructed the herdsman to rear the calf on milk from three different cows and to keep it confined in a stable {{for a minimum of}} seven years. Years later, a young woman was grazing cattle at a nearby loch when she was approached by an attractive man. He struck up a conversation with her and shortly afterwards the pair sat on the grass with his head resting in her lap, but as he fell asleep she discovered seaweed entwined in his hair, a sign that he was a water horse. She <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> back to the farm. Her suitor awoke, shapeshifted into his true equine form and chased after her. As the woman ran towards the farm, the witch shouted to the herdsman to release the water bull from the stable. The two creatures fought until they fell into the sea. The water horse never returned, but the remains of the bull were found the following day.|$|E

In the past few years, different countries have been investing resources in {{the organized}} sports sector for promoting health-enhancing physical activity. In the Netherlands, National Sports Federations were funded to develop and implement “easily accessible” sporting programs, aimed at the least active population groups. <b>Start</b> <b>to</b> <b>Run,</b> a 6 -week training program for novice runners, developed by the Dutch Athletics Organization, is one of these programs. In this study, the effects of <b>Start</b> <b>to</b> <b>Run</b> on health-enhancing physical activity were investigated. Methods: Physical activity levels of <b>Start</b> <b>to</b> <b>Run</b> participants were assessed by means of the Short QUestionnaire to ASsess Health-enhancing physical activity (SQUASH) at baseline, immediately after completing the program and six months after baseline. A control group, matched for age and sex, was assessed at baseline and after six months. Compliance with the Dutch physical activity guidelines was the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures were the total time spent in physical activity and the time spent in each physical activity intensity category and domain. Changes in physical activity within groups were tested with paired t-tests and McNemar tests. Changes between groups were examined with multiple linear and logistic regression analyses. Results: In the <b>Start</b> <b>to</b> <b>Run</b> group, the percentage of people who met the Dutch Norm for Health-enhancing Physical Activity, Fit-norm and Combi-norm increased significantly, both in the short- and longer-term. In the control group, no significant changes in physical activity were observed. When comparing results between groups, significantly more <b>Start</b> <b>to</b> <b>Run</b> participants compared with control group participants were meeting the Fit-norm and Combi-norm after six months. The differences in physical activity between groups in favor of the <b>Start</b> <b>to</b> <b>Run</b> group could be explained by an increase in the time spent in vigorous-intensity activities and sports ctivities. Conclusions: <b>Start</b> <b>to</b> <b>Run</b> positively influences levels of health-enhancing physical activity of participants, both in the short- and longer-term.

40|$|Introduction: The {{organized}} sport {{sector has}} been identified as a potential setting for physical activity promotion. In the Netherlands, national sporting organizations were funded to develop and implement sporting programs that are easy accessible, especially for the least active population groups. <b>Start</b> <b>to</b> <b>Run,</b> a 6 -week training program for novice runners, developed by the Dutch Athletics Organization, is one of these programs. In this study, the effects of <b>Start</b> <b>to</b> <b>Run</b> on physical activity were investigated. Methods: Physical activity levels of <b>Start</b> <b>to</b> <b>Run</b> participants were assessed by means of the Short QUestionnaire to ASsess Health-enhancing physical activity (SQUASH) at baseline, immediately after completing the program, and after six months follow-up. A control group, matched for age and sex, was assessed at baseline and six months follow-up. Compliance with the Dutch physical activity guidelines was the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures were the total time spent in physical activity and the time spent in each physical activity intensity category. Changes in physical activity within groups were tested with paired t-tests and McNemar tests. Changes between groups were examined with multiple linear and logistic regression analyses. Results: In the <b>Start</b> <b>to</b> <b>Run</b> group, the percentage of people who met the Dutch Norm for Health-enhancing Physical Activity, Fit-norm and Combi-norm increased significantly, both in the short- and longer-term. In the control group, no significant changes in physical activity were observed. When comparing results between groups, significantly more <b>Start</b> <b>to</b> <b>Run</b> participants compared <b>to</b> control group participants were meeting the Fit-norm and Combi-norm after six months follow-up. The differences in physical activity between groups in favor of the <b>Start</b> <b>to</b> <b>Run</b> group could be explained by {{a significant increase in the}} time spent in vigorous-intensity activities. Discussion: The results of the current study show that an easy accessible sporting program can influence physical activity behavior of participants positively. As sporting organizations have an enormous reach into community, they could play a major role in promoting physical activity to the general population. Research in the area of effectiveness of sporting programs in increasing physical activity is, however, still scarce. The role of sporting organizations in promoting physical activity should therefore be further explored...|$|R
