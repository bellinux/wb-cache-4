5|$|Baseball, {{widely known}} as America's pastime, is well {{established}} in several other countries as well. The history of baseball in Canada has remained closely linked {{with that of the}} sport in the United States. As early as 1877, a professional league, the International Association, featured teams from both countries. While baseball is widely played in Canada and many minor league teams have been based in the country, the American major leagues did not include a Canadian club until 1969, when the Montreal Expos joined the National League as an expansion team. In 1977, the expansion Toronto Blue Jays joined the American League. The Blue Jays won the World Series in 1992 and 1993, the first and still the only club from outside the United <b>States</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. After the 2004 season, Major League Baseball relocated the Expos to Washington, D.C., where the team is now known as the Nationals.|$|E
5|$|The Staten Island Railway {{provides}} full-time {{local service}} between Saint George and Tottenville {{along the east}} side of the borough. There is currently no subway service offered for those residents living on the western or northern sides of the borough, but Staten Island light rail has been proposed for these corridors. The MTA is planning to implement Bus Rapid Transit on the North Shore, while a study is underway to determine whether light rail should be implemented on Staten Island's west shore. The line has a route bullet similar to other subway routes: the letters SIR in a blue circle. It is used on timetables, on the MTA's site, and on some signage, but not on trains. The line runs 24 hours a day every day of the year (since May 10, 2015, the overnight service is on a 30-minute headway) and is one of only six mass-transit rail lines in the United <b>States</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so (the others being the PATCO Speedline, the Red and Blue Lines of the Chicago 'L', the Green Line of the Minneapolis-St. Paul METRO, the PATH lines, and the New York City Subway).|$|E

25|$|It's misapplied {{constantly}} by {{the country}} to get <b>states</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> things they don't want to do. Most importantly to me, 45 million babies have been murdered since judges forced Roe v. Wade down the throats of citizens.|$|E
25|$|Before emigrating to the United States, Nicollet was a {{professor}} of mathematics at Collège Louis-le-Grand, and {{a professor}} and astronomer at the Paris Observatory with Pierre-Simon Laplace. Political and academic changes in France led Nicollet {{to travel to the}} United <b>States</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> work that would bolster his reputation among academics in Europe.|$|E
25|$|As a {{dramatic}} last act, Governor Rockefeller, a longtime death penalty opponent, commuted the sentences of every prisoner on Arkansas's Death Row and urged {{the governors of}} other <b>states</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> likewise. Thirty-three years later, in January 2003, Illinois' lame duck governor, George Ryan, would do the same, granting blanket commutations to the 167 inmates then sentenced to death in that state.|$|E

The state boycotted the 1787 convention which drew up the United States Constitution and initially refused to ratify it; it was the last of the original <b>states</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, on May 29, 1790.|$|E
25|$|The Ohio State University Men's Glee Club is an all-male choral {{ensemble}} at The Ohio State University. Officially {{founded in}} 1875, the Men's Glee Club {{is one of}} the oldest student organizations on Ohio State's campus and is the 12th oldest collegiate glee club in the United States. The group has garnered many accolades, most notably winning Choir of the World 1990 from the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod. They were the first all-male choir and the first choir from the United <b>States</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so since modern competition began in 1987.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to operations over Iraq, the United Kingdom had also intervened in Syria by 21 October 2014, {{making it the}} first Western country, other than the United <b>States,</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. However, British aircraft were not permitted to carrying out airstrikes until Parliament had voted to give its authorization. Despite this, the Royal Air Force carried out a drone strike in Syria on 21 August 2015, against two UK-born ISIL fighters which had been plotting attacks against the United Kingdom. Prime Minister David Cameron insisted {{that it was a}} lawful act of self-defense.|$|E

25|$|I {{am doing}} {{everything}} in my power to discourage the use of gases and other chemicals in any war between nations. While, unfortunately, the defensive necessities of the United States call for study of the use of chemicals in warfare, I do not want the Government of the United <b>States</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything to aggrandize or make permanent any special bureau of the Army or the Navy engaged in these studies. I hope the time will come when the Chemical Warfare Service can be entirely abolished.|$|E
25|$|The Winnipesaukee Playhouse is a 200+ seat {{courtyard}} style theater {{located in}} Meredith, New Hampshire, United States, {{in the heart}} of New Hampshire's Lakes Region. The Playhouse produces both a professional summer stock season as well as a community theater season, and is arguably the only theater in the United <b>States</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. The Winnipesaukee Playhouse is the recipient of 46 New Hampshire Theater Awards over the past eight years, more than any other theater in the state during this time period, and in 2009 it was selected by New Hampshire Magazine as the best professional theater in New Hampshire. In 2013 the Winni Playhouse moved from Weirs Beach in Laconia to the former Annalee Dolls campus in Meredith. The new theater has 200 seats as well as support spaces such as offices, dressing rooms, and a lobby, which the previous theater did not have.|$|E
25|$|As of the 2008/09 school year, the College {{eliminated}} {{student loans}} from all financial aid packages {{in favor of}} grants. The College was the fourth institution in the United <b>States</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, following Princeton University, Amherst College, and Davidson College. However, in February 2010, the College announced it would re-introduce loans to its financial aid packages beginning with the Class of 2015 due to the college's changed financial situation. In January 2007 the board voted unanimously to reduce college CO2 emissions 10% below 1990 levels by 2020, or roughly 50% below 2006 levels. To meet those goals, the college set up the Zilkha Center for Environmental Initiatives and undertaken an energy audit and efficiency timeline. Williams received an 'A-' on the 2010 College Sustainability Report Card, following 'B+' grades on both the 2008 and 2009 report cards. In December 2008, President Morton O. Schapiro announced his departure from the college {{to become president of}} Northwestern University.|$|E

25|$|In July 1879, Blavatsky and Olcott {{began work}} on a monthly {{magazine}}, The Theosophist, with the first issue coming out in October. The magazine soon obtained a large readership, with the management being taken over by Damodar K. Mavalankar, a Theosophist who introduced the idea of referring to the Masters as mahatmas. In December, Blavatsky and Olcott travelled to Allahabad, there visiting Alfred Percy Sinnett, the editor of The Pioneer and keen Spiritualist. A.O. Hume was also a guest at the Sinnett's home, and Blavatsky was encouraged to manifest paranormal phenomena in their presence. From there, they travelled to Benares, where they stayed at the palace of the Maharaja of Vizianagram. Blavatsky and Olcott were then invited to Ceylon by Buddhist monks. There they officially converted to Buddhism—apparently the first from the United <b>States</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so—taking the Five Precepts in a ceremony at Ramayana Nikayana in May 1880. Touring the island, they were met by crowds intrigued by these unusual Westerners who embraced Buddhism rather than proselytizing Christianity. Their message proved a boost to Sinhalese nationalist self-esteem, and they were invited to see the Buddha's Tooth in Kandy.|$|E
500|$|On 11 December 1979, the Rhodesian House of Assembly voted 90 to nil {{to revert}} to British colonial status (the 'aye' votes {{included}} Ian Smith himself). The bill then passed the Senate and was assented to by the President. With the arrival of Lord Soames, the new Governor, just after 2 p.m. on 12 December 1979, Britain formally took control of Zimbabwe Rhodesia as the Colony of Southern Rhodesia, although on 13 December Soames declared that during his mandate the name Rhodesia and Zimbabwe Rhodesia {{would continue to be}} used. Britain lifted sanctions on 12 December, and the United Nations on 16 December, before calling on its member <b>states</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> likewise on 21 December. Thus Zambia, Mozambique, Tanzania, Angola and Botswana lifted sanctions on 22–23 December; Australia partly pre-empted this, [...] lifting all but trade sanctions on 18 December, and trade sanctions on 21 December.|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, one author {{opined that}} [...] "President Bush had not defended the {{hemisphere}} against European aggression {{under the guise}} of the Monroe Doctrine, or used the threat of Communist proliferation to take action, but instead he had used the US military to remove a hostile and problematic Latin American dictator from power because it was {{in the best interests of}} the United <b>States</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so." ...|$|E
