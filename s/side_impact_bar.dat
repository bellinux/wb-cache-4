The activities have been focused on <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> <b>bar</b> manufacturing by means of Tube Hydroforming process (THF). Punch movement paths and fluid pressure curve were optimized by means of FEM software (LS-DYNA) to guarantee tube sealing and material feeding during the tube deformation. The <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> <b>bar</b> geometry was optimized till reaching the shape guaranteeing the obtainment of safe parts with the best compromise in terms of final part geometry and thickness reduction. Different fluid pressure and punch movement paths were investigated. Once accomplished all the simulations and identified the best working solution, experimental tests were performed setting the process parameters according to the values defined during the simulation phase. Good agreement between FEM and experimental results were highlighted...|$|E

50|$|In 1997, the Rover 100 gave a poor {{performance}} in EuroNCAP crash tests (despite the improved safety features, including <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> <b>bars</b> in the doors and an optional driver's airbag, the 1970s design was showing its age) - {{it was at the}} time the only car tested to receive a one-star Adult Occupant Rating. Other small cars tested at the same time received 2 or 3 stars out of five. The passenger compartment was subjected to severe structural damage in the frontal-offset test and results showed a high risk of injury to all body regions for the driver. Meanwhile, the <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> test also showed high injury risks.|$|R
50|$|In {{common with}} other car manufacturers, the early 1990s saw Vauxhall {{featuring}} safety as a selling point, {{and beginning to}} incorporate many new safety features into cheaper family cars that were previously only found on expensive luxury saloons. The Mark 3 Astra {{was one of the}} first such cars, being introduced ahead of the Volkswagen Golf and Ford Mondeo, two other cars with a similar new-found focus on safety. So, the Mark 3 saw the introduction of twin <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> <b>bars,</b> a toughened safety cage, a safely-designed steering wheel (with collapsible columns) and 'body-lock' mechanical front seat-belt pre-tensioners. After the first face-lift full-size drivers air bags became optional or standard (depending on the model). Crash tests by consumers association (as featured by BBC's Watchdog show in 1992) and also by ADAC and Auto Express showed that the Mark 3 Astra protected better in crashes than most rivals of its time.|$|R

5000|$|The Exora has an {{equivalent}} 4-star EuroNCAP rating after 32 Exoras were crashed at the Applus+ IDIADA crash testing facility in Spain. Additionally, the Exora {{was awarded a}} 4-star rating by Malaysia's own MyVAP evaluation program. The Exora was given a four-star ANCAP safety rating, applicable to all variants. The MPV, which is [...] with dual frontal and side airbags with thorax and head protection for front occupants, scored 26.37 {{out of a possible}} 37 points. In the offset crash test, the Exora scored 10.55 out of 16 points - driver chest protection was acceptable and leg protection was marginal. In the <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> crash test, it managed 14.82 out of 16 points - driver chest protection was listed as acceptable. The Exora result - with testing carried out in July 2013 - reflected its performance in the 40% frontal offset test, where the risk of serious injury to the driver’s legs was high. <b>Side</b> <b>impact</b> performance was good, but overall pedestrian test results were poor, according to ANCAP. One of the key features that made these ratings possible is the use of high tensile steel for the body cage, providing better stability and increased impact absorption during a collision. <b>Side</b> <b>impact</b> <b>bars</b> are also installed to reinforce the door frames and to absorb <b>impacts</b> from both <b>sides.</b>|$|R
5000|$|As {{part of this}} update, officially {{known as}} the TJ MY02 series, <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> <b>bars</b> {{previously}} fitted only to export models were also introduced for Australian market cars, and the front doors now featured energy absorbing material. The Magna Executive received ABS and power windows as standard, while the Advance, Sports and VR-X were each fitted with a six speaker sound system (up from four), automatic climate control, front map lamps, glovebox lamp and power antenna. The Verada Xi's electric sunroof with front map lamps and C pillar courtesy lamps was now optional on all models. The Sports was further distanced from the VR-X by no longer sharing the same boot lid spoiler, but a smaller version (which became another optional accessory across the Magna range, and was fitted as standard on subsequent limited-run models, the Verada GTV and Diamante VR-X). Power for the standard (non [...] "high output") 3.5-litre V6 engine increased to [...] thanks to a higher compression ratio and a Karman Vortex airflow meter. The instrument cluster now had an integrated odometer and trip meter, {{as opposed to the}} previous analogue setup. The above engine power increase also interested the Verada range.

40|$|Although {{there have}} been {{tremendous}} improvements in crash safety {{there has been an}} increasing trend in <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> fatalities, rising from 30 % to 37 % of total fatalities from 1975 to 2004 (NHTSA, 2004). Between 1979 and 2004, 63 % of AIS≥ 4 injuries in <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> resulted from thoracic trauma (NHTSA, 2004). Lateral impact fatalities, although decreasing in absolute numbers, now comprise a larger percentage of total fatalities. Safety features are typically more effective in frontal collisions compared to <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> due to the reduced distance between the occupant and intruding vehicle in <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> collisions. Therefore, an increased understanding of the mechanisms governing <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> injury is necessary in order to improve occupant safety in <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> auto crash. This study builds on an advanced numerical human body model with focus on a detailed thoracic model, which has been validated using available post mortem human subject (PMHS) test data for pendulum and <b>side</b> sled <b>impact</b> tests (Forbes, 2005). Crash conditions were investigated through use of a modified side sled model used to reproduce the key conditions present in full scale crash tests. The model accounts for several important factors that contribute to occupant response based on the literature. These factors are; the relative velocities between the seat and door, the occupant to door distance, the door shape and compliance. The side sled model was validated by reproducing the crash conditions present in FMVSS 214 and IIHS <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> tests and comparing the thoracic compression, velocity, and Viscous Criterion (VC) response determined by the model to the response of the ES- 2 dummy used in the crash tests. Injury was predicted by evaluating VCmax, selected for its ability to predict rate-sensitive soft tissue injury during thoracic compression (Lau & Viano, 1986). The Ford Taurus FMVSS 214 and Nissan Maxima IIHS tests were selected from <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> crash test data found in the NHTSA database because they included factors not present in standard <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> test procedures. These factors were; the presence of door accelerometers used to provide input velocities to the <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> model and the use of a ES- 2 (rather than the SID) to facilitate comparison of VC response to the human body model. Also, the two crash test procedures (FMVSS 214 & IIHS) were selected to ensure accurate <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> model response to different <b>impact</b> scenarios. The <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> model was shown to closely reproduce the timing and injury response of the full-scale FMVSS 214 <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> test of a Ford Taurus, as well as the IIHS <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> test of a Nissan Maxima. The <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> model was then used to investigate the effects of door to occupant spacing, door velocity profile, armrest height, seat foam, restraint system, and arm position. It was found that the VCmax was controlled by both the first and second peaks typically found in door velocity profiles, but the effect of each varies depending on the situation. This study found that VCmax was reduced by 73 - 88 % when door intrusion was eliminated compared to the VC response incurred by an intruding door. Also, the presence of a deformable door based on physical geometry and material characteristics rather than a simplified rigid door reduced VCmax by 16 % in this study. The study on seat foam determined that significant effects on VC response can be made by modest adjustments in foam properties. Low stiffness seat foam was found to increase VCmax by 41 % when compared to the VC response when using high stiffness foam. Arm position has been proven to be a relevant factor in <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> crash. Positioning the arms parallel to the thorax, in the “down” position, caused a 42 % increase in VCmax when compared to the VC response determined with the arms positioned at 45 degrees. Finally, although restraint systems have limited influence on <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> crash safety compared to front and rear impacts, this study found that the presence of a pre-tensioning restraint system reduced VCmax by 13 % when compared to the VC response of an un-belted occupant. It {{should be noted that the}} current study was limited to velocity profiles obtained from a specific FMVSS 214 test and therefore results and observations are restricted to the confines of the input conditions used. However, the <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> model developed is a useful tool for evaluating factors influencing <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> and can be used to determine occupant response in any <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> crash scenario when the appropriate input conditions are provided...|$|R
