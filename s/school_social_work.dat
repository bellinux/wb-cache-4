[...] "External" [...] <b>school</b> <b>social</b> <b>work</b> or the [...] "Ferencváros" [...] model and 3. The [...] "Pécs" [...] model. The so-called [...] "employment of teachers as child protection workers" [...] model, which was {{also included in the}} classification of <b>school</b> <b>social</b> <b>work</b> models in the early 1990s, is {{not a member of the}} group any longer. This was due to the introduction of university degree programmes in social work and social education, to the search for identity of professionals working in the field and to the elaboration of the notion of <b>school</b> <b>social</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E

50|$|During the 1970's, <b>school</b> <b>social</b> <b>work</b> {{gave more}} {{emphasis}} on family, community, collaborative approach with teachers and others school personnel. In 1975, the United States passed the Education of All Handicapped Children Act (EAHC, P.L. 94-142). It gave special importance {{to the role of}} <b>School</b> <b>social</b> <b>work</b> services. The legislation was later renamed as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in 1990. In {{the latter part of the}} 1970s, inflation was rising at an alarming rate and budget cuts threatened the profession of <b>school</b> <b>social</b> <b>work,</b> especially as many social workers were being replaced by other school personnel claiming similar roles. The National Association of Social Work (NASW) published a newsletter to bring attention to the issue and get responses from practitioners.

The National Association of Social Workers with 150,000 members also offers a Certified <b>School</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Work</b> Specialist (C-SSWS) Certificate in <b>school</b> <b>social</b> <b>work.</b> It is revised form of 1992 <b>School</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Work</b> Credential Exam. Though, it does not replace any license or certification that individual states require of school social workers. The Illinois State Board of Education requires that all students applying to an educator licensure program take and pass the Test of Academic Proficiency (TAP) and submit an ACT plus writing certificate with composite score higher than 19-22 and the same should be dated less than 10 years before submission. A passing score on the Basic Skills Test from the past 10 years will also be accepted.|$|E
