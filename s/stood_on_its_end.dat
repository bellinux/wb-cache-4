60|$|The spectators {{regarded}} the simple expedient of the trapper with that species of wonder, {{with which the}} courtiers of Ferdinand {{are said to have}} viewed the manner in which Columbus made his egg <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>end,</b> though with feelings that were filled with gratitude instead of envy.|$|R
50|$|The German company Pussycat sells a Columbus Egg {{that can}} be {{balanced}} by holding it upright for 25 seconds, then quickly inverting it. The egg will then <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> pointed <b>end</b> for 15 seconds, then topple <b>on</b> <b>its</b> side.|$|R
60|$|It is {{to these}} large air-chambers in bow and stern, coupled with great sheer--or rise fore and aft--of gunwale, {{and a very}} heavy keel, that the boat owes its {{self-righting}} power. The two air-chambers are rounded on the top. Now, {{it is obvious that}} if you were to take a model of such a boat, turn it upside down on a table, and try to make it rest <b>on</b> <b>its</b> two rounded air-chambers, you would encounter as much difficulty as did the friends of Columbus when they sought to make an egg <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>end.</b> The boat would infallibly fall to one side or the other. In the water the tendency is precisely the same, and that tendency is increased by the heavy iron keel, which drags the boat violently round to its right position.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} days of the station, WKOR had a huge old style mobile home, known as the [...] "KOR Caravan" [...] for remote broadcasts, the first being at Woolco in the Gateway Shopping Center. On a Saturday {{afternoon}} in October 1968 the caravan was in the nearby town of Maben. Butch Luke had so many groupies into the back of the caravan that it <b>stood</b> up <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>end.</b> Bill Tanner was on the air when suddenly all he could see was the sky. J. Mark Shands rushed back to the main studio in Starkville and nervously went on the air, his first time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look up," [...] said Mr. George, [...] "to {{the top of}} it. It {{is as high as}} a steeple. See {{how large}} it is, too, at the base. Think how {{enormously}} heavy such an immense stone must be. What a work it must have been to lift it up and <b>stand</b> it <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>end!</b> Besides, it does not rest upon the ground, but upon another monstrous stone, the pedestal of which is nearly thirty feet high; so that, in setting it up in its place, the engineers had not only to lift it up on end, but they had to raise the whole mass, bodily, twenty or thirty feet into the air. I suppose {{it was one of the}} greatest lifts that ever was made.|$|R
5000|$|The {{tale of the}} [...] "Egg of Columbus" [...] is {{apocryphal}} and was {{ascribed to}} Filippo Brunelleschi {{with regard to the}} construction of the dome of the Duomo in Florence beforeit was related pertaining to Columbus. The story told by Girolamo Benzoni in his Historia del Mondo Nuovo of 1565 was that at a meal several of Columbus's detractors began to comment that any number of other people could have found their way to the New World and that Columbus's feat was unremarkable because of its simplicity. Columbus replied that it was only easy now that he had demonstrated how it was done, and by way of an example, he challenged anyone present to <b>stand</b> an egg <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>end.</b> After all those attempting the feat had admitted defeat Columbus demonstrated the simplicity of the challenge by crushing one end of the egg against the table which allowed it to remain upright.|$|R
6000|$|... "When I saw that, I saw everything; I saw the Church and the world. The Church in its earthly {{action has}} really touched morbid things--tortures and {{bleeding}} visions and blasts of extermination. The Church has had her madnesses, and I {{am one of}} them. I am the massacre of St. Bartholomew. I am the Inquisition of Spain. I do not {{say that we have}} never gone mad, but I say that we are fit to act as keepers to our enemies. Massacre is wicked even with a provocation, as in the Bartholomew. But your modern Nietzsche will tell you that massacre would be glorious without a provocation. Torture should be violently stopped, though the Church is doing it. But your modern Tolstoy will tell you that it ought not to be violently stopped whoever is doing it. In the long run, which is most mad--the Church or the world? Which is madder, the Spanish priest who permitted tyranny, or the Prussian sophist who admired it? Which is madder, the Russian priest who discourages righteous rebellion, or the Russian novelist who forbids it? That is the final and blasting test. The world left to itself grows wilder than any creed. A few days ago you and I were the maddest people in England. Now, by God! I believe we are the sanest. That is the only real question--whether the Church is really madder than the world. Let the rationalists run their own race, and let us see where they end. If the world has some healthy balance other than God, let the world find it. Does the world find it? Cut the world loose," [...] he cried with a savage gesture. [...] "Does the world <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> own <b>end?</b> Does it stand, or does it stagger?" ...|$|R
