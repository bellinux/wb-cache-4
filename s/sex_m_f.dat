40|$|Given meta-analytic {{findings}} showing {{females to}} be generally more fearful than males on multi-dimensional self-report measures of fear, an empirical {{attempt was made}} to examine whether this outcome could be explained by psychological factors such as sex role orientation and masculine sex role stress. In addition, the bearing of dissimulation tendencies on findings relating self-reported fears to biological sex, sex roles, and masculine sex role stress was also addressed. Using a non-clinical sample of volunteers from Britain, it was observed with simple correlational analyses that females were more fearful than males on Social, Agoraphobic, Harmless animals and Sexual and aggressive scenes fears, even after holding constant the combined influences of Masculinity and Masculine sex role stress. The sex difference in Bodily injury, death and illness fears emerged only after adjusting for the joint influences of Masculinity and Masculine sex role stress. Applying hierarchical multiple regression analysis with interaction terms, it was found that (a) Biological sex contributed significantly in increasing the proportion of variance accounted for in scores on Social, Agoraphobic, Harmless animals and Sexual and aggressive scenes fears, after accounting for the joint influences of Masculinity (M), Femininity (F), Masculine sex role stress (MGRS), Dissimulation (Lie) and other potentially confounding factors; (b) following the simultaneous adjustment for the influences of the same set of potentially confounding factors (thus including M, F, MGRS, and Lie scores), Biological sex emerged as a consistent predictor of all five types of fears considered, with, as hypothesized, being female predicting high fear scores; (c) the same applied to the predictive ability of Masculine sex role stress (with Biological sex now included as a covariate), with, as predicted, higher stress being predictive of higher fear levels; (d) again, taking into account potentially confounding factors, Masculinity predicted all types of fears considered, except Fears of sexual and aggressive scenes, with, as anticipated, high Masculinity predicting low levels of fear, whereas, contrary to expectations, Femininity and Dissimulation did not succeed in predicting fear scores of any type; (e) few combinations of independent variables (involving Biological <b>sex,</b> <b>M,</b> <b>F,</b> MGRS and Lie) predicted fear scores significantly following adjustment for potential confounds, the significant predictors being MGRS x Biological sex (in relation to Social fears), Lie x Biological sex (Fears of bodily injury, death and illness) and M x F (Harmless animals fears) with respective betas of -. 14,. 17 and. 22 (. 01 less-than-or-equal-to P less-than-or-equal-to. 05); (f) while Biological sex. Masculinity and Masculine sex role stress were all factors predicting the magnitude of self-reported fears, their relative contributions varied according to the fear dimension. Five major hypotheses about the relationship between sex roles and mental and physical health have been advanced in the literature: the traditional hypothesis, the balance theory of androgyny, the main effects androgyny hypothesis, the emergent properties theory of androgyny, and the Masculinity hypothesis (cf. K. Davidson-Katz (1991). Gender roles and health. In C. R. Snyder & D. R. Forsyth (Eds.), Handbook of Social and Clinical Psychology: The Health Perspective. New York: Pergamon).

40|$|There {{has been}} {{numerous}} studies performed regarding {{the effectiveness of}} prophylactic knee braces (PKB) preventing knee injuries or the effect of PKB on injured knees, but minimal research {{is available on the}} effect of how PKB affect the functioning capacity of uninjured knees. PURPOSE: To examine the effects of two different types of PKB, hinged (HGB) and non-hinged (NHB), on uninjured preferred knee joint range of motion and dynamic balance in males and females. METHODS: Thirty subjects were recruited (male= 15, female= 15) with ages ranging from 18 - 28 years. Only participants with no history of any knee injuries or current knee problems were allowed to participate. Subjects were blinded to the purpose of the study, but were allowed practice trials for the dynamic balance test (Y-Balance test). Prior to experimental trials subjects were measured for body composition and knee brace size. All subjects underwent three experimental trials [HGB, NHB, and a no PKB control (CON) ] on the same day in balanced cross-over design. During the treatment trials, the subjects wore the braces on their preferred leg. Each experimental trial was comprised of a test for dynamic balance and four tests for knee joint range of motion. Dynamic balance composite score, knee extension/flexion (°), and internal/external knee rotation (°) were compared between <b>sex</b> (<b>M,</b> <b>F)</b> and across PKB (HGB, NHB, CON) using an ANOVA (1 between, 1 within), α= 0. 05. Age and body composition differences between sex were examined using independent t-tests, α= 0. 05. RESULTS: M and F did not differ (p 3 ̆e 0. 05) with regard to age, but did differ significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) in body mass, body stature, and percent body fat. For the sex main effect, when pooled across PKB (CON, HGB, NHG) M and F did not differ (p 3 ̆e 0. 05) in knee flexion, internal knee rotation, right/left leg balance, but did differ significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) in knee extension (M=+ 0. 8 ± 1. 8 °, F=- 0. 6 ± 2. 4 °) and external knee rotation (M= 29. 7 ± 7. 5 °, F= 35. 9 ± 9. 7 °). For the main effect for PKB, when pooled across sex external knee rotation and right/left leg balance did not differ (p 3 ̆e 0. 05) between HGB, NHB, and CON, but both HGB and NHB differed significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) from CON for internal rotation (HGB= 21. 9 ± 10. 3 °, NHB= 22. 5 ± 9. 8 °, CON= 24. 8 ± 10. 0 °), flexion (HGB= 126. 9 ± 17. 7 °, NHB= 125. 7 ± 15. 9 °, CON= 139. 0 ± 6. 8 °), and extension (HGB=+ 0. 7 ± 1. 4 °, NHB=+= 1. 3 ± 1. 8 °, CON=- 1. 7 ± 2. 2 °). The sex x knee brace interaction was not significant (p 3 ̆e 0. 05). CONCLUSION: PKB have no effect on dynamic balance, but appear to hinder the range of motion for most motions of the knee...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to provide {{information}} on the morphometric evolution of dwarf rabbits from growing age until adult age, according to their gender. A total of 136 “coloured dwarf” rabbits (74 males and 62 females) were used. At 20 and 45 weeks of age, the rabbits were weighed and body measurements were taken from each rabbit at predefined anatomical points using digital Caliper (mm) or measuring tape (cm). The measurements were: three distance measurements (in cm) : body length, BL; ear length, EL; head length, HL; one height measurement (in cm) : head height, HH; seven width measurements (in mm) : shoulders width, SW; rump width, RW; tibia width, TW; ear width, EW; forehead width, FHW; head width, HW, fold width, FW; two circumferences (in cm) : thorax circumference, TC; abdomen circumference, AC. Using these body measurements, a total of 3 body indices were estimated to define the general conformation of the animals: compact index 1 : rump width/body length (RW/BL); compact index 2 : thorax circumference/body length (TC/BL); compact index 3 : abdomen circumference/body length (AC/BL). Data collected were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) studying the effect of age (20 wk, 45 wk), <b>sex</b> (<b>M,</b> <b>F)</b> and their interaction (age x sex). Statistical significance of differences was assessed by the t-test. Considering the main effects, all parameters were affected by age and almost all body measurements by sex with the exception of BL, EL, FHW, HL, TC/BL. At both ages, females showed higher live weights than males (1630 vs 1542 g and 1953 vs 1850 g, at 20 and 45 wk of age, respectively). Significant sex differences were found for AC at 45 wk of age: females presented higher AC value than males (29. 5 vs 27. 8 cm; P< 0. 01). As concerns the head measurements with increasing age the males showed the highest mean value of FHW and HW than females 45 wk old and males and females 20 wk old (4. 25 vs 4. 13 and 3. 86 and 3. 87 mm, P< 0. 05; 4. 64 vs 4. 29 and 4. 34 and 4. 18 mm, P< 0. 01, respectively). The FW resulted significantly higher in males at 45 wk of age than females of the same age and males and females 20 wk old (4. 28 vs 3. 63 and 3. 76 and 3. 62 mm, P< 0. 01, respectively). Within the considered indices only compact index 1 (RW/BL) showed significant differences (P< 0. 01) : males 20 wk old resulted less compact than females of the same age and of adult ones. The results showed a clear sex dimorphism for quite all parameters considered, resulting in higher live weight in females than males at both age considered. The live weight and ear length at 45 wk of age exceeded the standard values of the considered dwarf breed and, considering also the high variability observed in most of the measurements used, it appears that through the selection procedures employed probably other breeds were used...|$|E

40|$|Mucor circinelloides is a zygomycete fungus and an {{emerging}} opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised patients, especially transplant recipients {{and in some}} cases otherwise healthy individuals. We have discovered a novel example of size dimorphism linked to virulence. M. circinelloides is a heterothallic fungus: (+) sex allele encodes SexP and (-) sex allele SexM, both of which are HMG domain protein <b>sex</b> determinants. <b>M.</b> circinelloides <b>f.</b> lusitanicus (Mcl) (-) mating type isolates produce larger asexual sporangiospores that are more virulent in the wax moth host compared to (+) isolates that produce smaller less virulent sporangiospores. The larger sporangiospores germinate inside and lyse macrophages, whereas the smaller sporangiospores do not. sexMDelta mutants are sterile and still produce larger virulent sporangiospores, suggesting that either the sex locus is not involved in virulence/spore size or the sexP allele plays an inhibitory role. Phylogenetic analysis supports that at least three extant subspecies populate the M. circinelloides complex in nature: Mcl, <b>M.</b> circinelloides <b>f.</b> griseocyanus, and <b>M.</b> circinelloides <b>f.</b> circinelloides (Mcc). Mcc was found to be more prevalent among clinical Mucor isolates, and more virulent than Mcl in a diabetic murine model in contrast to the wax moth host. The <b>M.</b> circinelloides <b>sex</b> locus encodes an HMG domain protein (SexP for plus and SexM for minus mating types) flanked by genes encoding triose phosphate transporter (TPT) and RNA helicase homologs. The borders of the sex locus between the three subspecies differ: the Mcg sex locus includes the promoters of both the TPT and the RNA helicase genes, whereas the Mcl and Mcc sex locus includes only the TPT gene promoter. Mating between subspecies was restricted compared to mating within subspecies. These findings demonstrate that spore size dimorphism is linked to virulence of M. circinelloides species and that plasticity of the sex locus and adaptations in pathogenicity have occurred during speciation of the M. circinelloides complex.
