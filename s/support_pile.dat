40|$|Incremental {{launching}} {{is one of}} {{the common}} steel bridge assembly methods used nowadays, its practical application consists in passing the bridge assembly through the launching shoes as well as over each <b>support</b> <b>pile.</b> In some cases, when plate girders are used, it is usual to find longitudinal stiffeners reinforcement in order to prevent web local buckling produced by the vertical reaction acting in the <b>support</b> <b>pile.</b> A considerable number of studies have focused on evaluating the impact of a single stiffener on the resistance of plate girder subjected to patch loading. However, the effect of multiple longitudinal stiffened plate girders subjected to lengthy compressive load has received little attention. Therefore, this paper aims at studying the influence of load bearing length on the ultimate strength of multiple longitudinally stiffened webs subjected to compressive loads. Patch loading resistance is numerically calculated using a previously validated nonlinear finite element analysis. Subsequently, a parametrical study is conducted to investigate the effect of the aforementioned load length and the relative position and size of the stiffeners on the ultimate strengthPeer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|Presently, {{foundation}} pit support structures are {{generally regarded as}} the temporary structures {{and the impact of}} vibration loads is often overlooked. As opposed to static and seismic loads, the vibration loads of subway trains are a type of cyclic load with a relatively long duration of action and a definite cycle; it is of great importance for the design of {{foundation pit}} support structures to correctly evaluate the impact of subway train vibrations on deep foundation pit and support works. In this paper, a dynamic three-dimensional numerical model is built that considers the vibration load of subway trains {{on the basis of the}} static numerical model for deep foundation pit support structures and simplified train loads to study the impact of train vibrations on deep foundation pit and permanent support structures. Studies have shown that the dynamic response of surface displacement mainly occurs in the early period of dynamic load, the vibration load of subway trains has little impact on ground subsidence, the <b>support</b> <b>pile</b> structure is in an elastic state during dynamic response under the action of subway train vibrations, and the action of train vibration loads is inimical to the safety of foundation pit support structures and should be closely studied...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The <b>supporting</b> <b>piles</b> of deep {{foundation}} pits are usually made in reinforced concrete materials and rarely in prestressed concrete materials. But prestressed concrete materials have higher stiffness and less deformation and {{are suitable for}} controlling displacements or settlements. So, in this paper a practical engineering project as an example, the prestressed concrete <b>supporting</b> <b>piles</b> of the {{deep foundation}} pit are calculated and designed. Then, the settlement and inclination of the building adjacent the foundation pit with the prestressed concrete piles are calculated in the numerical software, FLAC. The results calculated in FLAC are compared with the actual settlement and inclination of the adjacent building during the foundation pit is excavated. The comparison confirms the feasibility of the supporting structure. This is a useful trial {{on the design of}} the prestressed concrete <b>supporting</b> <b>piles...</b>|$|R
40|$|Pile driving {{operations}} present unique {{working conditions}} for the inspector. Piles are only visible during construction; part of their load-bearing behavior is inferred by their behavior during construction; and the equipment required to drive them into place is expensive, and introduces noise, vibration, and various spatial constraints to its environment. The inspector working in this environment must track numerous pieces of information before, during, and after the pile driving operation, to assess the load-bearing capacity of the piles and to establish the pay quantities for the pile driving operation. In the case of unexpected conditions (e. g. additional splices or piles required), the inspector must quickly gather numerous pieces of information related to the unexpected conditions and the possible claim for additional expenses. Laser scanners {{may be used to}} assist the inspector during routine inspection of pile driving operations. This paper describes the spatial information used to evaluate different phases of steel pile driving operations and presents data collected during a recent pile driving operation to demonstrate information that can be obtained to <b>support</b> <b>pile</b> driving inspections. Furthermore, the paper defines unique considerations related to pile driving operations that must be addressed to properly prepare for data collection and analysis using laser scanners...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} of an artificial island {{is one of the}} solutions to be able to drill for oil safely in the Caspian Sea. On this island the required facilities are installed. Construction of an artificial island however, results in loading of the subsoil and will trigger settlements. Consolidation is one of the processes which cause the settlement. Differential settlements can damage the shallow foundations on the island. In order to prevent this, an alternative foundation on piles needs to be considered. Piles placed in a thick, soft soil layer will have low end bearing capacity, and thus need to activate skin friction. Since the surrounding soft soil is consolidating, these piles will have their own challenges. The relative movement between pile and soil determines the zones of negative and positive skin friction. Positive skin friction will need to be mobilized to <b>support</b> <b>pile</b> loading. Applying load on the head creates additional pile settlements, thus expanding the zone of positive skin friction. The consequence of this is that the bearing capacity of the pile is increased. This research looks into the two dominant parts of these friction piles in a consolidating soil profile. The driving mechanism, consolidation and subsequent settlement of the subsoil, is studied. Besides that the behavior of the interface between the soil and the installed piled is considered. Site investigations performed at the reference project are interpreted and a ‘Caspian’ soil profile can be determined. Besides this general profile a ‘Centrifuge’ soil profile is determined, which is revised to fit the specifications of the centrifuge. A one layer ‘benchmark’ situation is created to check the different calculation methods. The reaction of the ‘centrifuge’ and ‘benchmark’ soil profiles to the new loading situation is calculated and can be checked with centrifuge measurements. Recreating a two layer soil profile, containing stiff and soft clay, is done in the centrifuge. Msettle, a Hand Calculation and the Plaxis Soft Soil model give an accurate representation of the settlement in the physical model. The settlement in time seems to be described accurately as well. Calculations are done with a constant permeability. The “settlement in time” lines are calculated with Msettle and give a good image of the decrease in permeability during the performed centrifuge tests. The measured compression parameters for Kaolin Clay agree well with the values found in the literature. These compression parameters are tested in an oedometer test, and are given in a one dimensional stress space. Recalculation of the compression parameters into isotropic stress dependent parameters does not give the same settlement predictions. The used relationships given in the Plaxis 2 D Material Models manual do not seem to give an accurate relation. The performed direct shear box tests show that the peak friction on the pile-soil interface is mobilized at displacements of about one millimeter. Further shearing led to a decrease in maximum shear stress, the so called residual value. Geo-engineeringGeoscience & EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

This paper carries out construction monitoring and numerical simulation analysis and gives a detailed study on the influenced factors of support structure deformation. Calculation results show that subgrade unsymmetrical load has a great influence on deep horizontal deformation of <b>supporting</b> <b>piles.</b> The maximum horizontal displacement at the bias side is about three times more than non-bias side’s; when the distance of subgrade to foundation pit {{is the same as}} the depth of excavation, the influence of subgrade on pit can be ignored; as the cohesion and internal friction angle increases, the horizontal displacement of fender piles decreases.
