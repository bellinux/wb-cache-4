Modelling indicates that dangling <b>bond</b> <b>saturation</b> by atomic hydrogen is the predominant mechanism. We obtain outstanding carrier lifetimes of 10. 3 ms, corresponding to SRVs of 0. 56 cm/s. For a‑Si:H films made at 250 °C, an as-deposited minority carrier lifetime of 2. 0 ms is observed. In contrast to a‑Si:H films fabricated at 130 °C, however, no change in passivation quality upon thermal annealing is observed. These films were fabricated {{for the first time}} using a continuous in-line HWCVD mode. Wafer cleaning before a‑Si:H deposition is a crucial step for c‑Si surface passivation. We tested the influence of an atomic hydrogen treatment before a‑Si:H deposition on the c‑Si surface. The treatments were performed in a new virgin chamber to exclude Si deposition from the chamber walls. Subsequently, we deposited a-Si:H layers onto the c-Si wafers and measured the lifetime for different H treatment times. We found that increasing hydrogen treatment times led to lower effective lifetimes. Modelling of the measured minority carrier lifetime data shows that the decreased passivation quality is caused by an increased defect density at the amorphous-crystalline interface. Furtheremore, the passivation of different a‑Si:H containing layers have been tested. For intrinsic films and intrinsic/n-type stacks, an improvement in passivation up to 255 °C and 270 °C is observed. This improvement is attributed to dangling <b>bond</b> <b>saturation</b> by H, whereas the decrease at higher temperatures is caused by H effusion. For intrinsic/n-type a‑Si:H layer stacks, a record minority carrier lifetime of 13. 3 ms is obtained. In contrast, for intrinsic/p-type a‑Si:H layer stacks, a deterioration in passivation is observed over the whole temperature range, due to the asymmetric Fermi-level dependent defect formation enthalpy in n- and p-type a‑Si:H. Comparing the lifetime values and trends for the different layer stacks to the performance of the corresponding cells, it is observed that the intrinsic/p-layer stack is limiting device performance. Based on these findings, the solar cells were prepared in a modified order, reaching an efficiency of 16. 7 % (VOC = 681 mV), versus 15. 8 % (VOC = 659 mV) in the ‘standard’ order. Finally, transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layers are studied for application into solar cells. It is observed that both types of TCO deposition have no significant influence on the passivation properties of standard a‑Si:H layer stacks forming the emitter structure in the used SHJ cells. On flat wafers, a conversion efficiency of 16. 7 % has been obtained when ITO is used as TCO, versus an efficiency of 16. 3 % for ZnO:Al; slightly lower due to increased electrical losses...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe direct {{conversion}} of sunlight into biofuels is an intriguing {{alternative to a}} continued reliance on fossil fuels. Natural photosynthesis has long been investigated both as a potential solution, and {{as a model for}} utilizing solar energy to drive a water-to-fuel cycle. The molecules and organizational structure provide a template to inspire the design of efficient molecular systems for photocatalysis. A clear design strategy is the coordination of molecular interactions that match kinetic rates and energetic levels to control the direction and flow of energy from light harvesting to catalysis. Energy transduction and electron-transfer reactions occur through interfaces formed between complexes of donor–acceptor molecules. Although the structures of several of the key biological complexes have been solved, detailed descriptions of many electron-transfer complexes are lacking, which presents a challenge to designing and engineering biomolecular systems for solar conversion. Alternatively, it is possible to couple the catalytic power of biological enzymes to light harvesting by semiconductor nanomaterials. In these molecules, surface chemistry and structure can be designed using ligands. The passivation effect of the ligand can also dramatically affect the photophysical properties of the semiconductor, and energetics of external charge-transfer. The length, degree of <b>bond</b> <b>saturation</b> (aromaticity), and solvent exposed functional groups of ligands can be manipulated to further tune the interface to control molecular assembly, and complex stability in photocatalytic hybrids. The results of this research show how ligand selection is critical to designing molecular interfaces that promote efficient self-assembly, charge-transfer and photocatalysis.

40|$|Geometric and {{position}} isomers of zeatin and of ribosylzeatin and other compounds {{closely related to}} zeatin have been tested in the tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum var. Wisconsin No. 38) bioassay. None was more active than zeatin itself. There was a much greater difference in activity (> 50 -fold) between trans- and cis-zeatin than between trans-isozeatin [6 -(4 -hydroxy- 2 -methyl-trans- 2 -butenylamino) purine] and cis-isozeatin [6 -(4 -hydroxy- 2 -methyl-cis- 2 -butenylamino) purine], the latter being less active than cis-zeatin and trans-isozeatin. Higher concentrations were required for equivalent callus growth stimulated by the 9 -ribosyl derivatives, which followed an order of decreasing activity: ribosyl-trans-zeatin > ribosyl-cis-zeatin > ribosyl-trans-isozeatin > ribosyl-cis-isozeatin, corresponding roughly {{to that of the}} bases. The effect of side chain, double <b>bond</b> <b>saturation</b> was to diminish the activity, and in the dihydro series the shift of the methyl group from the 3 - to the 2 -position in going from dihydrozeatin to dihydroisozeatin [6 -(4 -hydroxy- 2 -methylbutylamino) purine] resulted in a 70 -fold decrease in activity. cis-Norzeatin [6 -(4 -hydroxy-cis- 2 -butenylamino) purine], which was less than one-fifth as active as cis-zeatin, showed the effect of complete removal of the side chain methyl group, and cyclic-norzeatin [6 -(3, 6 -dihydro- 1, 2 -oxazin- 2 -yl) purine] was about 1 / 100 as active as cis-norzeatin. These findings delineate completely the effect on the cytokinin activity of zeatin of variation in side chain geometry, presence {{and position}} of the methyl substituent, presence and geometry of hydroxyl substitution, presence of the double bond, and of side chain cyclization...|$|R
