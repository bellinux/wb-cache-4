30|$|We {{analysed}} the LoC concept by scrutinising its feasibility {{with regard}} to {{important aspects of the}} environmental risk assessment. We then considered its relationship with protection goals, the comparative safety assessment and the <b>stepwise</b> <b>testing</b> <b>approach.</b> We finally discussed its usefulness for assessing long-term effects, effects on non-target organisms and species of conservation concern.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} arrive at a common {{understanding}} among applicants, risk assessors and risk managers, the question of what the consequences are if LoCs are exceeded has to be answered before the LoC concept is to be made operational, Tentative interpretations bear the risk of misusing the LoC as a stop criterion for the <b>stepwise</b> <b>testing</b> <b>approach</b> of the ERA thus again fuelling controversies about fundamental risk assessment approaches of GMOs. Instead, the opportunity should be taken to strengthen the stepwise ERA approach and thus increase confidence in risk conclusions.|$|E
30|$|However, for GMOs, no such {{validation}} {{studies have}} been conducted so far (see also “The role of the LoC in the <b>stepwise</b> <b>testing</b> <b>approach</b> of the ERA of GMOs” section). It is questionable whether effect sizes of 20 % or smaller are reliable predictors of harmless effects on a range of non-target organisms in the field, when testing the GMO at lower tier, e.g. in the laboratory. In particular, if the 20 % value is used for laboratory mortality data, it would also have to cover sub-lethal and reproductive effects that might occur under field conditions. Additionally, any decision on acceptable effect sizes for laboratory testing should take into consideration that, e.g. for mites, mortalities of 20 – 25 % in the control group are accepted validity criteria for ecotoxicological effect testing of chemicals or plant protection products [50, 51]. Although LoCs should be set independently from acceptable control mortalities for standardised ecotoxicological testing protocols, these must be kept in mind when deciding on acceptable effect sizes for laboratory tests using non-target organisms.|$|E

It is published as a companion report to the "Review of Literature-Based Models for Skin and Eye Irritation and Corrosion", an ECB report which reviewed the state-of-the-art of in silico and in vitro dermal and ocular irritation and corrosion human health hazard endpoints. In the former review, the focus was placed on reviewing alternative in silico approaches to assess acute local toxic effects, such as QSARs, SARs, chemical categories, and read-across and analogue approaches. Special {{emphasis was placed on}} literature-based (Q) SAR models for skin and eye irritation and corrosion and expert systems. In the present review, the emphasis is on different schemes (testing strategies) that have been conceived for the integrated use of different approaches, including in silico, in vitro and in vivo methods.

40|$|Purpose: It aims {{to discuss}} the {{importance}} of the methods, particularly for the researchers who works in comparing the studies of profitability of trading rules, mutual & hege funds performance, investment advisory services, and multiple competing model forecasting. Key literature/ theoretical perspectives: The importance of data snooping has been emphasized as a serious problem in finance literature. Literally, the meaning of the data snooping is hard to be defined. Crack (1999) described that "Data snooping (mistaking spurious statistical relationships for genuine ones) is an important and dangerous by-product of the financial analysis”. The Data Snooping Bias test is to investigate whether the model’s excess return against benchmark is resulted by superior predictive ability. Methodology: When we examine the large numbers of forecasting models (for example, technical trading rules) with a given data set, there is a high probability that one such model will yield superior performance by accident. White (2000) developed the first statistical testing model known as the Stationary Bootstrap Reality Check(RC). Hansen (2005) proposed a studentized version of the superior predictive ability (SPA) test. Extending those two models, Romano and Wolf (2005) introduced an RC-based <b>stepwise</b> <b>test</b> (<b>Stepwise</b> RC) and Hsu, Hsu and Kuan (2010) an SPA-based <b>stepwise</b> <b>test.</b> 2 page(s...|$|R
40|$|In {{the finance}} literature, {{statistical}} inferences for large-scale testing problems usually suffer from data snooping bias. In this paper we extend the "superior predictive ability" (SPA) test of Hansen (2005, JBES) to a <b>stepwise</b> SPA <b>test</b> that can identify predictive models without potential data snooping bias. It is shown analytically and by simulations that the <b>stepwise</b> SPA <b>test</b> {{is more powerful}} than the <b>stepwise</b> Reality Check <b>test</b> of Romano and Wolf (2005, Econometrica). We then apply the proposed test to examine the predictive ability of technical trading rules based on the data of growth and emerging market indices and their exchange traded funds (ETFs). It is found that technical trading rules have significant predictive power for these markets, yet such evidence weakens after the ETFs are introduced. © 2009. preprin...|$|R

40|$|Software {{testing is}} a key phase in {{software}} development lifecycle. Testing objectives corresponds to the discovery and detection of faults, which can be attained by utilizing manual or automated <b>testing</b> <b>approaches.</b> In this thesis, we are mainly concerned with the manual <b>test</b> <b>approaches.</b> The most commonly used manual <b>testing</b> <b>approaches</b> in the software industry are the Exploratory <b>Testing</b> (ET) <b>approach</b> and the Test Case Based <b>Testing</b> (TCBT) <b>approach.</b> TCBT is primarily used by software testers to formulize and guide their testing tasks and set the theoretical principles for testing. On the other hand ET is simultaneous learning, test design, and test execution. Software testing might benefit from an intelligent combination of these <b>approaches</b> of <b>testing</b> however {{there is no proof}} of any formal process that accommodates the usage of both <b>test</b> <b>approaches</b> in a combination.

The new process is defined through the mapping of weaknesses of one approach to the strengths of other.

Furthermore, MT was validated by conducting an experiment in an industrial setting.

40|$|The next {{bit test}} was {{introduced}} by Blum and Micali and proved by Yao to be a universal test for cryptographic pseudorandom generators. On the other hand, no universal test for the cryptographic onewayness of functions (or permutations) is known, though the existence of cryptographic pseudorandom generators is equivalent to that of cryptographic one-way functions. In the quantum computation model, Kashefi, Nishimura and Vedral gave a sufficient condition of (cryptographic) quantum one-way permutations and conjectured that the condition would be necessary. In this paper, we affirmatively settle their conjecture and complete a necessary and sufficient for quantum one-way permutations.
