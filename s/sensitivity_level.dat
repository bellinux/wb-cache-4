25|$|While alcohol {{initially}} helps {{social phobia}} or panic symptoms, with longer term alcohol misuse can often worsen social phobia symptoms {{and can cause}} panic disorder to develop or worsen, during alcohol intoxication and especially during the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. This effect {{is not unique to}} alcohol but can also occur with long-term use of drugs which have a similar mechanism of action to alcohol such as the benzodiazepines, which are sometimes prescribed as tranquillizers to people with alcohol problems. Approximately half of patients attending mental health services for conditions including anxiety disorders such as panic disorder or social phobia suffer from alcohol or benzodiazepine dependence. It was noted that every individual has an individual <b>sensitivity</b> <b>level</b> to alcohol or sedative hypnotic drugs and what one person can tolerate without ill health another will suffer very ill health and that even moderate drinking can cause rebound anxiety syndromes and sleep disorders. A person who is suffering the toxic effects of alcohol will not benefit from other therapies or medications as they do not address the root cause of the symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Approximately half of {{patients}} attending {{mental health services}} for conditions including anxiety disorders such as panic disorder or social phobia {{are the result of}} alcohol or benzodiazepine dependence. Sometimes anxiety pre-existed alcohol or benzodiazepine dependence but the alcohol or benzodiazepine dependence act to keep the anxiety disorders going and often progressively making them worse. Many people who are addicted to alcohol or prescribed benzodiazepines when it is explained to them they have a choice between ongoing ill mental health or quitting and recovering from their symptoms decide on quitting alcohol or their benzodiazepines. It was noted that every individual has an individual <b>sensitivity</b> <b>level</b> to alcohol or sedative hypnotic drugs and what one person can tolerate without ill health another will suffer very ill health and that even moderate drinking can cause rebound anxiety syndromes and sleep disorders.

50|$|The XTS-400 {{provides}} both an untrusted {{environment for}} normal {{work and a}} trusted environment for administrative work and for privileged applications.

50|$|Software is {{considered}} trusted if it performs functions {{upon which the}} system depends to enforce the security policy (e.g., the establishment of user authorization). This determination is based on integrity level and privileges. Untrusted software runs at integrity level 3, with all integrity categories, or lower.

Yet, Hadoop has not been adapted for multilevel secure (MLS) environments where data of different security classifications co-exist.

Thus, if one creates an unclassified document on a secret device, the resultant data is classified secret until it can be manually reviewed.

40|$|In {{previous}} papers, we {{have shown}} that the least radiation sensitive fibers are drawn from Fluosil and Diasil preforms and that the specific radiation response of these pure-silice core fibers is unequivocally determined by the test conditions. Here we demonstrate that the actual <b>sensitivity</b> <b>levels</b> of such fibers may differ by factors of up to 3 - 5 from charge to charge. Furthermore, we tested a pure silica core fiber drawn from a new PICVD preform developed by Schott. This plasma impulse chemical vapor deposition process (PICVD) allows the production of preforms for pure-silica core fibers as well as for arbitrarily shaped graded index fibers doped with Ge or F. The new fiber compares favorably with Fluosil SW and Diasil type Fibers, not only as regards the <b>sensitivity</b> <b>levels</b> but also the recovery characteristics...|$|R

50|$|The {{sensitivity}} of the CaMKII enzyme to calcium and calmodulin is governed by the variable and self-associative domains. This <b>sensitivity</b> <b>level</b> of CaMKII will also modulate the different states of activation for the enzyme. Initially, the enzyme is activated; however, autophosphorylation does not occur because {{there is not enough}} Calcium or calmodulin present to bind to neighboring subunits. As greater amounts of calcium and calmodulin accumulate, autophosphorylation occurs leading to persistent activation of the CaMKII enzyme {{for a short period of}} time. However, the Threonine 286 residue eventually becomes dephosphorylated, leading to inactivation of CaMKII.|$|E
50|$|As {{part of the}} Multi-Level Security (MLS) {{development}} work applications such as the CUPs print server will understand the MLS sensitivity labels, CUPs will use them to control printing and to label the printed pages according to their <b>sensitivity</b> <b>level.</b> The MCS data is stored and manipulated {{in the same way}} as MLS data, therefore any program which is modified for MCS support will also be expected to support MLS. This will increase the number of applications supporting MLS and therefore make it easier to run MLS (which is one of the reasons for developing MCS).|$|E
5000|$|Apart {{from this}} astro-particle physics aspect, the ANTARES {{telescope}} may also tackle some fundamental problems in particle physics, {{such as the}} search for dark matter {{in the form of}} neutralino annihilation in the sun (normal solar neutrinos being outside the energy range of ANTARES) or the galactic center. Due to the very different methods employed, its expected sensitivity is complementary to the direct dark matter searches performed by various experiments such as DAMA, CDMS and at the LHC. Detection of neutralino signals would also confirm supersymmetry, but is not generally considered very likely at the ANTARES <b>sensitivity</b> <b>level.</b> Other possible [...] "exotic" [...] phenomena that could conceivably be measured by ANTARES include nuclearites or magnetic monopoles.|$|E

50|$|An aligned carbon {{nanotube}} ultrasensitive biosensor for DNA detection was developed. The design and fabrication of the biosensor {{was based on}} aligned single wall {{carbon nanotube}}s (SWCNTs) with integrated single-strand DNAs (ssDNA). The fabricated ultra-sensitive biosensor provided label-free real-time electronic detection of DNA hybridization between surface immobilized ssDNA and target ssDNA. Hybridization kinetics between complementary and target ssDNA nucleotide base pairs resulted in a local charge generation between base pairs that was injected into the SWCNTs resulting in a detectable change in SWCNT electrical conductance. This conductance change was amplified electrically through {{the integration of the}} functionalized SWCNTs as the semi-conductive channel in a silicon-silicon oxide based field effect transistor (FET). Based on previous Langmuir DNA kinetics calculations, the projected <b>sensitivity</b> <b>level</b> of the SWCNT-DNA sensor was considerably higher than traditional fluorescent and hybridization assays.|$|E

5000|$|The excess {{penetrant}} is then {{removed from}} the surface. The removal method {{is controlled by the}} type of penetrant used. Water-washable, solvent-removable, lipophilic post-emulsifiable, or hydrophilic post-emulsifiable are the common choices. Emulsifiers represent the highest <b>sensitivity</b> <b>level,</b> and chemically interact with the oily penetrant to make it removable with a water spray. When using solvent remover and lint-free cloth it is important to not spray the solvent on the test surface directly, because this can remove the penetrant from the flaws. If excess penetrant is not properly removed, once the developer is applied, it may leave a background in the developed area that can mask indications or defects. In addition, this may also produce false indications severely hindering the ability to do a proper inspection. Also, the removal of excessive penetrant is done towards one direction either vertically or horizontally as the case may be.|$|E
