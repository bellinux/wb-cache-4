25|$|Dominant <b>stags</b> follow {{groups of}} hinds during the rut, from August into early winter. The <b>stags</b> may {{have as many}} as 20 hinds to keep from other, less {{attractive}} males. Only mature <b>stags</b> hold harems (groups of hinds), and breeding success peaks at about eight years of age. <b>Stags</b> two to four years old rarely hold harems and spend most of the rut on the periphery of larger harems, as do <b>stags</b> over 11 years old. Young and old <b>stags</b> that do acquire a harem hold it later in the breeding season than those <b>stags</b> in their prime. Harem-holding <b>stags</b> rarely feed and lose up to 20% of their body weight. <b>Stags</b> that enter the rut in poor condition are less likely to make it through to the peak conception period.|$|R

40|$|Conventional {{time domain}} Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) {{relies on a}} {{reference}} Optical Delay Line (ODL). These reference ODLs require the physical movement of a mirror to scan a given depth range. This movement results in instrument degradation. We propose a new optical fibre based time domain OCT system that makes use of a micro-photonic structure as a stationary ODL. The proposed system uses an in-fibre interferometer, either a Michelson or a Mach-Zhender. The reference ODL makes use of a collimator to expand {{the light from the}} optical fibre. This is them expanded in one dimension via planar optics, that is, a cylindrical lens based telescope, using a concave and convex lens. The expanded beam is them passed through a transmissive Spatial Light Modulator (SLM), specifically a liquid crystal light valve used as an optical switch. Light is then reflected back through the system off the micro-photonic structure. The micro-photonic structure is a one dimensional array of <b>stagged</b> mirror steps, called a Stepped Mirror Structure (SMS). The system enables the selection of discrete optical delay lengths. The proposed ODL is capable of depth hoping and multicasting. We discuss the fabrication of the SMS, which consists of eight steps, each approximately 150 μm high. A change in notch frequency using an in-fibre Mach Zhender interferometer was used to gauge the average step height. The results gave an average step height of 146 μm...|$|E

50|$|Another {{important}} aspect of the model was the Student Advisory Group (<b>STAG).</b> The <b>STAG</b> model meant a teacher met every day with a cross-graded group of students. The <b>STAG</b> teacher was responsible for the overall progress of his/her students. Thus the <b>STAG</b> teacher collected data from the subject teachers on these particular students. This included academic progress, attendance, and behavior data. The <b>STAG</b> teacher also contacted parents and conducted parent-teacher conferences for these students. The <b>STAG</b> teacher did not necessarily teach the student any of the courses. The <b>STAG</b> teacher also booked students into resource periods for extra instruction when necessary.|$|R

5000|$|The White <b>Stag</b> has {{a message}} for you. Hunters of old pursued the miraculous <b>stag,</b> not because they {{expected}} to kill it, but because it led them in {{the joy of the}} chase to new and fresh adventures, and so to capture happiness. You may look on the White <b>Stag</b> as the true spirit of Scouting, springing forward and upward, ever leading you onward to leap over difficulties, to face new adventures in your active pursuit of the higher aims of Scouting. Baden-Powell's farewell speech to the Scouts Today, the Hungarian branch of Scouts uses the white <b>stag</b> as a symbol. The white <b>stag</b> is also prevalent in Hungarian mythology; it was believed that a white <b>stag</b> led the brothers Hunor and Magor to Scythia, an action which preceded the formation of the Hun and Magyar people. The White <b>Stag</b> Leadership Development Program bases much of its spirit and traditions on the white <b>stag</b> of Hungarian mythology.|$|R

40|$|Dead, {{standing}} trees, {{commonly referred}} to as <b>stags</b> in Australia and as snags in North America, are a regular feature of forests and woodlands. Although previously regarded as useless, often meriting removal, <b>stags</b> are now recognized as important for wildlife. We quantified the abundance of arthropods that visited or used the trunks of <b>stags</b> in Kings Park, an inner-city woodland park in Perth, Western Australia. <b>Stags</b> ranging from around 4 to 11 years since death were compared with live trees of the same species; Jarrah Eucalyptus marginata, Tuart E. gomphocephala, and Fraser’s Sheoak Allocasuarina fraseriana. At the ordinal level, <b>stags</b> were visited or used by almost as many taxa of arthropods as live trees. One group, the beetles (Coleoptera), when considered at the morphospecies level, was found to be only slightly less diverse on Eucalyptus <b>stags</b> than on live trees and was more diverse on sheoak <b>stags</b> than live sheoaks. A large proportion of the beetle species was specific to either live trees or <b>stags,</b> suggesting that the existence of <b>stags</b> enriches the diversity of arthropods in forests and woodlands. In addition to contributing to arthropod diversity and conservation, these organisms provide a food source for insectivorous vertebrates, as well as contributing to core ecosystem functions, such as nutrient cycling. Retention of <b>stags</b> therefore has important conservation benefits and, other than when there is a risk to public safety, <b>stags</b> should be protected and allowed to fall naturally in the course of time...|$|R
