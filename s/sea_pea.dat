50|$|This spit on the {{northern}} outskirts of Felixstowe has a vegetated shingle beach, which is a fragile and rare habitat. Flora include sea kale, yellow horned poppy, sea sandwort, sea campion and <b>sea</b> <b>pea.</b> Areas of saltmarsh provide cover for small birds.|$|E
50|$|Since 1997, Malören {{has been}} a nature reserve {{covering}} 182 hectares (450 acres). Vegetation on the rock-strewn island {{is reported to be}} gradually increasing. Mountain ash are taking root {{and there are plenty of}} <b>sea</b> <b>peas,</b> tufted vetch and fireweed. Rarer species include sleepy primrose and southern adderstongue. The island is even more interesting for birdlife, located as it is at the south end of the archipelago. It is used both as a resting place and for nesting. Arctic terns abound but there are also black-legged kittiwakes, Arctic skuas, large and small plovers, ruddy turnstones and redshanks as well as many of species of gull.|$|R
40|$|Sea urchins (Echinoidea) {{comprise}} a group exhibiting enormous diversity {{in shape and}} size. At the lowest end of the size scale is Echinocyamus, a poorly known genus of highly miniaturized relatives of the sand dollars sometimes called ???<b>sea</b> <b>peas.</b> ??? There are sixteen known extant species of Echinocyamus and two species in the sister genus, Mortonia. Using elliptical Fourier analysis to compare these species, 13 of them with sufficiently large sample sizes (> ten specimens) were significantly distinct based on test shape alone. A morphological phylogeny indicates that two species, E. planissimus and E. platytatus, should be removed {{not only from the}} genus, but from the family to which they belonged, Fibulariidae. With the removal of these two species, Echinocyamus and Mortonia are monophyletic and sister to Fibularia. Mortonia was nested well within Echinocyamus and should be sunk into that genus...|$|R

50|$|Since sheep stopped grazing at Skaftafell, the {{vegetation}} has undergone great changes and is quickly making inroads on the glacial deposits {{in front of}} Skaftafellsjökull and in Morsárdalur valley. Species such as garden angelica, wild angelica, <b>sea</b> <b>pea</b> and arctic river beauty, are hardly ever found on grazing land, but have now become common. Birch and willows are also starting to colonise land.|$|E
40|$|In this study, the {{presence}} and possible function of endocannabinoid ligands in the planarian is investigated. The endocannabinoids ananadamide (AEA) and 2 -arachidonoylglycerol (2 -AG) and entourage NAE compounds palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), stearoylethanolamide (SEA) and oleoylethanolamide (OEA) were found in Dugesia dorotocephala. Changes in <b>SEA,</b> <b>PEA,</b> and AEA levels were observed over the initial twelve hours of active regeneration. Exogenously applied AEA, 2 -AG and their catabolic inhibition effected biphasic changes in locomotor velocity, analogous to those observed in murines. The genome of a close relative, Schmidtea mediterranea, courtesy of the University of Utah S. med genome database, was explored for cannabinoid receptors, none were found. A putative fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) homolog was found in Schmidtea mediterranea...|$|E
50|$|One {{tradition}} {{common in}} the U.S. is that each person at the meal should leave three peas on their plate {{to ensure that the}} New Year will be filled with luck, fortune and romance. Another tradition holds that counting the number of peas in a serving predicts the amount of luck (or wealth) that the diner will have in the coming year. On Sapelo Island in the community of Hog Hammock, Geechee red peas are used instead of black-eyed <b>peas.</b> <b>Sea</b> Island red <b>peas</b> are similar.|$|R

International interest from the UK and North American music press came {{with the release of}} The Double EP: A <b>Sea</b> of Split <b>Peas</b> in October 2013.

50|$|Laurel Grove was {{a prosperous}} {{plantation}} that grew oranges, <b>sea</b> island cotton, <b>peas,</b> and potatoes. Over a hundred slaves were gathered there from multiple African ethnic groups; {{they lived in}} two groups of houses. Anna, however, lived with Kingsley in his house. At Laurel Grove, as at many other southeastern plantations, Kingsley used the task system to manage work. Slaves were given a quota to fill; when they were finished, {{they were allowed to}} pursue other tasks. Some tended personal gardens, while others produced crafts, both of which they were able to sell. Whether due to cultivation techniques or the task system, Laurel Grove was quite successful. One year the plantation made $10,000, which was an extraordinary income at the time, particularly for sparsely populated Florida.|$|R

40|$|Sea {{lampreys}} (Petromyzon marinus), an invasive pest in the Upper Great Lakes, avoid odours {{that represent}} danger in their habitat. These odours include damage-released alarm cues from conspecifics and predator cues, like 2 -phenylethylamine hydrochloride (PEA HCl), a promising predator cue {{found in the}} urine of mammalian predators. The objectives of this experimental study were: (1) determine if the avoidance response of <b>sea</b> lamprey to <b>PEA</b> HCl is graded or hypersensitive, (2) determine if the avoidance response to {{the combination of a}} predator cue (PEA HCl) and damage-released alarm cue is synergistic or additive. To meet the first objective, groups of ten sea lampreys were placed in an artificial stream channel and presented with stepwise concentrations of PEA HCl ranging from 5 E- 8 to 5 E- 10 M and a deionized water control. Sea lampreys exhibited graded avoidance behaviour in response to PEA HCl. To meet the second objective, sea lampreys were exposed to PEA HCl, conspecific damage-released alarm cue, and a combination of the two. Sea lamprey responded to the combination of predator cue and damage-released alarm cue in an additive manner, as the response to the combination of cues did not trigger a significantly greater response than the sum of their separate effects...|$|R
40|$|Several {{robotics}} applications require high torque-to-weight {{ratio and}} energy efficient actuators. Progress {{in that direction}} was made by introducing compliant elements into the actuation. A large variety of actuators were developed such as series elastic actuators (SEAs), variable stiffness actuators and parallel elastic actuators (<b>PEAs).</b> <b>SEAs</b> can reduce the peak power while PEAs can reduce the torque requirement on the motor. Nonetheless, these actuators still cannot meet performances close to humans. To combine both advantages, the series parallel elastic actuator (SPEA) was developed. The principle is inspired from biological muscles. Muscles are composed of motor units, placed in parallel, which are variably recruited as the required effort increases. This biological principle is exploited in the SPEA, where springs (layers), placed in parallel, can be recruited one by one. This recruitment is performed by an intermittent mechanism. This paper presents {{the development of a}} SPEA using the MACCEPA principle with a self-closing mechanism. This actuator can deliver a bi-directional output torque, variable stiffness and reduced friction. The load on the motor can also be reduced, leading to a lower power consumption. The variable recruitment of the parallel springs can also be tuned in order to further decrease the consumption of the actuator for a given task. First, an explanation of the concept and {{a brief description of the}} prior work done will be given. Next, the design and the model of one of the layers will be presented. The working principle of the full actuator will then be given. At the end of this paper, experiments showing the electric consumption of the actuator will display the advantage of the SPEA over an equivalent stiff actuator...|$|R
