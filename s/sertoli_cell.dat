40|$|Mammalian {{spermatogenesis}} is {{a highly}} organized system that can produce large number of spermatozoa continuously. Spermatogenesis takes place within the seminiferous tubules that are composed of germ <b>cells</b> and <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> that are morphologically and functionally unique somatic cells specialized to support spermatogenesis. <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> directly contact with germ cells, and regulate their proper localization and release into lumen. They also provide nutrients and growth factors essential for the differentiation of germ cells and the stem <b>cell</b> maintenance. Furthermore, <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> play a pivotal role for maintaining {{the integrity of the}} seminiferous epithelium by forming tight junction. Consequently, dysfunction of <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> leads to the disruption of spermatogenesis and male infertility. Therefore, understanding of the <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cell’s</b> function is crucial to clarify the microenvironment for spermatogenesis. 　　Spermatogenesis progresses in a spatially and temporally regulated manner, known as spermatogenic wave. During spermatogenesis, germ cells in different developmental stages form groups and synchronously differentiate. In the mouse testis, twelve germ cell groups, known as seminiferous epithelial stages I- XII, can be recognized and they are arranged in order along the tubule length showing the spatial continuity. This cyclical program in spermatogenesis is called “seminiferous epithelial cycle”. One cycle takes 8. 6 days in the mouse and 12. 9 days in the rat. When rat germ cells are transferred to mouse testis, spermatogenesis proceed with the cycle characteristic of rat germ cells. Therefore it is believed that the cycle length is primarily regulated by germ cells. 　　It has been known that <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> change their gene expression patterns in accordance with the continuous alteration of the epithelial stages. Because heterogeneous gene expression in <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> was observed even in testes lacking differentiating germ cells, it is suggested that cyclic gene expression in <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> can occur independently of synchronous spermatogenic differentiation. Furthermore, in the early phase of the first round spermatogenesis when intact seminiferous epithelial cycle was not established, the wave-like expression in <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> was associated with the timing of spermatogonia differentiation. Growing evidence suggests interesting possibility that <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> support stage-specific events of spermatogenesis by creating stage-specific microenvironments. 　　It has been suggested that retinoic acid (RA) signaling is involved in the regulation of seminiferous epithelial cycle. In vitamin A-deficient (VAD) mice, spermatogenesis was arrested at spermatogonia stage, and the injection of vitamin A (retinol) or RA into VAD mice triggers initiation of synchronized spermatogenesis in all seminiferous tubules. Moreover, it was reported that Sertoli cell-specific deletion of RARα resulted in disruption of the stage-dependent gene expression in <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells.</b> These evidences suggest the involvement of RA signaling in the stage-dependent expression of <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells.</b> However, it remains elusive how RA signaling controls the periodicity of <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> and whether other signaling pathway(s) is involved in the regulation. Furthermore, importance of periodicity in <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> for spermatogenesis is also unknown. 　　In part I, to understand the periodicity of <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells,</b> I performed comprehensive analysis of stage-dependent gene expression in <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> by using microarray, and identified 419 stage-dependent genes. In part II, I investigated implication of Notch signaling in <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells,</b> because the list of stage-dependent genes contained Notch 1 receptor. I found that the Notch ligand, Jagged 2 was expressed in germ cells, and Notch 1 receptor was expressed and activated in <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> in stage-dependent manner. To examine the involvement of Notch signaling in periodicity of <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> and spermatogenesis, I inactivated Notch signaling in <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> by using cre-loxP system. However, my data demonstrated that genetic ablation of Notch signaling in <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> did not affect spermatogenesis nor stage-dependent gene expression in <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> as long as I examined, suggesting that Notch signaling in <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> is dispensable for mouse spermatogenesis and the stage-dependent expression. 　　In part III, I studied relationship between stage-dependent gene expression in <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> and RA signaling. I found that RA signaling was periodically activated in stage VII-XII seminiferous tubules, and stage-dependent genes showing peak at stage I-VI and VII-XII tended to be suppressed and activated by RA signaling, respectively. To examine the significance of the periodicity in <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> for spermatogenesis, I disrupted stage-dependent gene expression in <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> by means of lentivirus mediated suppression of RA signaling, and found it led to stage-specific defects in germ cell differentiation, delayed recovery of tight junction component and abnormal morphology of <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells.</b> Taken together, the stage-dependent gene expression in <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> is primarily regulated by periodic activation of RA signaling, and is important for stage-specific events of spermatogenesis...|$|R

2500|$|Cryptorchidism {{is common}} in male dogs, {{occurring}} {{at a rate of}} up to 10%. [...] Although the genetics are not fully understood, it is thought to be a recessive, and probably polygenetic, trait. [...] Some have speculated that it is a sex-limited autosomal recessive trait; however, it is unlikely to be simple recessive. Dog testes usually descend by ten days of age and it is considered to be cryptorchidism if they do not descend by the age of eight weeks. [...] Cryptorchidism can be either bilateral (causing sterility) or unilateral, and inguinal or abdominal (or both). [...] Because it is an inherited trait, affected dogs should not be bred and should be castrated. [...] The parents should be considered carriers of the defect and a breeder should thoughtfully consider whether to breed the carrier parent or not. [...] Littermates may be normal, carriers, or cryptorchid. [...] Castration of the undescended teste(s) should be considered for cryptorchid dogs due to the high rate of testicular cancer, especially <b>sertoli</b> <b>cell</b> tumors. [...] The incidence of testicular cancer is 13.6 times higher in dogs with abdominally retained testicles compared with normal dogs. [...] Testicular torsion is also more likely in retained testicles. [...] Surgical correction is by palpation of the retained testicle and subsequent exploration of the inguinal canal or abdomen, however, it is against AKC rules to show altered dogs, making this correction pointless for breeding stock. Surgical correction is termed orchiopexy, i.e., a surgery to move an undescended testicle into the scrotum and permanently fix it there. Surgical correction is an option for pet dogs that will not be used for breeding.|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} isolate avian <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> and to investigate their function using a chicken model in an in vitro test system. Immature chicken <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> in culture present morphology similar to that of mammalian cells and conserve expression of the specific Sertoli marker, anti-Mullerian hormone.

Finally, avian <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> present 3 interesting characteristics: they actively proliferate in vitro, can be passaged several times, and are suitable for freezing in nitrogen.

40|$|Dye {{coupling}} {{experiments were}} performed {{to determine whether the}} gap junctions connecting <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> with other <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> and different germ cell stages in rats showed func-tional variations. Chop loading of adult rat seminiferous tubules was conducted using fluorescent dextran controls and a variety of low-molecular-weight tracers (lucifer yellow, biotin-X-cadav-erine, biotin cadaverine, and neurobiotin) to evaluate dye cou-pling in situ, and scrape loading was used to study dye coupling in Sertoli-germ cell cocultures established using prepuberal rats. Sertoli-Sertoli coupling is relatively short range and nonselective in situ, whereas coupling between <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> and chains of spermatogonia is strongly selective for the positively charged biotin tracers relative to negatively charged lucifer yellow. Cou-pling between <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> and spermatogonia was also asym-metric; lucifer yellow in germ cells never diffused into <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells,</b> and biotinylated tracers only weakly diffused from sper-matogonia to <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells.</b> Asymmetric coupling would facilitate the concentration in germ cells of molecules diffusing through junctions from <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells.</b> Dye coupling between <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> and adluminal germ cells was too weak to detect by fluores-cence microscopy, suggesting that the junctional communica-tion between these cells may be functionally different from that between Sertoli and basal germ cells.

40|$|The "nurse cell " {{function}} of <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> in spermatogenesis was originally tacitly assumed {{on the basis}} of the anatomical relationships between cells in the testis. In mammals, from very early in prenatal development to the onset of meiosis and to the ultimate production of spermatozoa, the relationship between the germinal <b>cells</b> and the <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> is important and ap-parently obligatory. The experimental evidence supports the notion that the primary endocrine regulation of spermatogenesis via FSH and testosterone is manifested through actions on the <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells.</b> Although diverse strategies are used by <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> to support germ cell development, one of the most important roles of <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> is the regulation of the intratubular and intercellular environment adluminal to the tight junctional complexes. The meiotic and post-meiotic germ cells are sequestered by Sertoli-Sertoli junctional complexes in an adluminal compartment that is isolated from the serum or lymph. As a result of this sequestering activity, the secretion products of the <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> and the meiotic germ cells determine the composition of this local environment that can influence meiosis as well as spermatid and spermatocyte development. Evidence is accumulating that paracrine and autocrine factors from <b>Sertoli</b> and germ <b>cells</b> are important in the functioning of both cell types. While it is important to know what <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> and germ cells make, it is equally important to know when they make it. Distinct but well-defined groups of germ <b>cells</b> interact with <b>Sertoli</b> <b>cells</b> in a cyclic pattern. These recurring groups of germ cells define the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium during which sperm are produced in an asynchronous fashion.
