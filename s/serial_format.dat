5|$|The Bill {{is unique}} amongst police dramas {{in that it}} takes a <b>serial</b> <b>format,</b> {{focussing}} on the work and lives of a single shift of police officers, rather than on one particular area of police work. Also unique is that The Bill adapted to this format after several series, whereas comparable series started with the <b>serial</b> <b>format.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 1840s, a <b>serial</b> <b>format</b> {{known as}} the roman-feuilleton was highly popular in France, and the most {{acclaimed}} expression of it was the socialist writing of Eugène Sue. Balzac wanted to challenge Sue's supremacy, and prove himself the most capable feuilleton author in France. Writing quickly and with intense focus, Balzac produced La Cousine Bette, one of his longest novels, in two months. It was published in Le Constitutionnel {{at the end of}} 1846, then collected with a companion work, Le Cousin Pons, the following year.|$|E
5|$|Belenggu was {{submitted}} to Balai Pustaka {{for publication in}} 1938, but was accepted because of its perceived dissonance with public morality, particularly its portrayal of adultery and prostitution– key components of the plot– as acceptable. Eventually Belenggu {{was picked up by}} Poedjangga Baroe and published in a <b>serial</b> <b>format</b> in three editions between April and June 1940. Belenggu was the only novel published by the magazine and the first Indonesian psychological novel. In 1969, Belenggu received the first annual Literary Prize from the government of Indonesia, along with Marah Rusli's Sitti Nurbaya (1922), Salah Asuhan, and Achdiat Karta Mihardja's Atheis (Atheist; 1949).|$|E

5|$|In {{producing}} the series, Maiellaro crudely designed the characters as a cost-cutting measure; {{the series is}} animated by Radical Axis. He intended for the series to lack continuity starting from the pilot, but established a <b>serial</b> <b>format</b> after starting the second episode. He had constructed an ending for the series {{as well as a}} detailed map of characters; however, the series finale concluded differently from planned. Maiellaro cast people around his office for the characters, starring himself as the protagonist and Nine Pound Hammer vocalist Scott Luallen as the voice of Roostre; the band also performs the opening theme.|$|E
5|$|Typewriter in the Sky is {{a science}} fiction novel written by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. The protagonist Mike de Wolf finds himself inside {{the story of his}} friend Horace Hackett's book. He must survive {{conflict}} on the high seas in the Caribbean during the 17th century, before eventually returning to his native New York City. Each time a significant event occurs to the protagonist in the story he hears the sounds of a typewriter in the sky. At the story's conclusion, de Wolf wonders if he is still a character in someone else's story. The work was first published in a two-part <b>serial</b> <b>format</b> in 1940 in Unknown Fantasy Fiction. It was twice published as a combined book with Hubbard's work Fear. In 1995 Bridge Publications re-released the work along with an audio edition.|$|E
25|$|Charles William Kahles (pronounced Kah'-less) (January 12, 1878 – January 21, 1931) was a {{prolific}} cartoonist responsible for numerous comic strips, notably Hairbreadth Harry.

25|$|In 1999, another special, , {{was made}} for Comic Relief and later {{released}} on VHS. An affectionate parody of the television series, it was split into four segments, mimicking the traditional <b>serial</b> <b>format,</b> complete with cliffhangers, and running down the same corridor several times when being chased (the version released on video was split into only two episodes). In the story, the Doctor (Rowan Atkinson) encounters both the Master (Jonathan Pryce) and the Daleks. During the special the Doctor is forced to regenerate several times, with his subsequent incarnations played by, in order, Richard E. Grant, Jim Broadbent, Hugh Grant and Joanna Lumley. The script was written by Steven Moffat, later to be head writer and executive producer to the revived series.|$|E
25|$|When a key of the {{teleprinter}} keyboard is pressed, a 5-bit {{character is}} generated. The teleprinter converts it to <b>serial</b> <b>format</b> and transmits {{a sequence of}} a start bit (a logical 0 or space), then {{one after the other}} the 5 data bits, finishing with a stop bit (a logical 1 or mark, lasting 1, 1.5 or 2 bits). When a sequence of start bit, 5 data bits and stop bit arrives at the input of the teleprinter, it is converted to a 5-bit word and passed to the printer or VDU. With electromechanical teleprinters, these functions required complicated electromechanical devices, but they are easily implemented with standard digital electronics using shift registers. Special integrated circuits have been developed for this function, for example the Intersil 6402 and 6403. These are stand-alone UART devices, similar to computer serial port peripherals.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, {{prior to}} Paul Marquess' {{appointment}} as executive producer, The Bills ratings {{had dropped to}} approximately six million viewers and advertising revenues had fallen, {{in part due to}} the ageing demographic of its viewers, leading ITV to order a [...] "rejuvenation" [...] which saw the series adopt a <b>serial</b> <b>format.</b>|$|E

500|$|In 2005, Johnathan Young {{took over}} as {{executive}} producer. The <b>serial</b> <b>format</b> was dropped and The Bill returned to stand-alone episodes with more focus on crime and policing than on the personal lives of the officers. 2007 saw the reintroduction of episode titles, which had been dropped in 2002. In 2009, The Bill {{moved back to the}} 9pm slot it previously held and the theme tune, [...] "Overkill", was replaced as part of a major overhaul of the series.|$|E
500|$|Doctor Who ceased airing in 1989 {{and began}} again in 2005. Each {{story in the}} {{original}} series (1963–1989) is a multi-episode serial, with two exceptions: the 1965 cutaway episode [...] "Mission to the Unknown", and the 20th anniversary story The Five Doctors. During the early seasons of the programme, and occasionally through its run, most serials were linked together; usually one story would lead directly into the next. Starting with the 2005 revival, the production team abandoned the traditional <b>serial</b> <b>format</b> for a largely self-contained episodic format with occasional multi-part stories and loose story arcs.|$|E
500|$|The show {{revolves}} around a mouse named Mouse Fitzgerald (voiced by Matt Maiellaro), nicknamed [...] "Fitz", who {{is fond of}} beer and caught {{in a world of}} espionage, love, and the delights of odd jobs.

Fitz begins to recover suppressed memories that he once had a wife and a child who have now vanished. This leads him to seek answers about his past and the shadowy forces that seem to be manipulating his world.|$|E

500|$|In July 1840 he {{attempted}} to fuse his desire to make money with his politics by founding a magazine called the Revue Parisienne, funded by his friend Armand Dutacq. Having already worked in the publishing industry, Balzac believed he had learned {{all there was to}} know about the trade. [...] "hat gigantic machine known as journalism", he wrote, [...] "is as simple as a roasting spit turned by a poodle." [...] Balzac planned to publish his own fiction in the Revue Parisienne, in part to challenge the popularity of the roman-feuilleton <b>serial</b> <b>format.</b> Dutacq, however, stopped funding the project in September, after only three issues, and Balzac's final foray into the world of publishing came to an end.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} {{compared}} to Hill Street Blues due to the similar, <b>serial,</b> <b>format</b> that both series take. However, The Bill has seen little direct competition on British television in the police procedural genre over its twenty-five-year history, though the BBC has twice launched rival series. The first was Merseybeat, which ran from 2001 but was cancelled in 2004 due to poor ratings and problems with the cast. The second, HolbyBlue, launched in 2007, was a spin-off of successful medical drama Holby City (itself a spin-off of the long-running Casualty). It was scheduled to go [...] "head to head" [...] with The Bill, prompting a brief [...] "ratings war", however HolbyBlue was also cancelled by the BBC in 2008, again, largely due to poor ratings.|$|E
500|$|According to Maiellaro, {{the series}} was pitched as a table read to the network. He jokingly stated that they {{accepted}} it after claiming that production costs would total [...] "five dollars and will {{take some of the}} paper sitting in the copier." [...] Maiellaro borrowed inspiration from surrealism and the films of David Lynch. He intended for the series to lack continuity starting from the pilot, but established a <b>serial</b> <b>format</b> after starting to work on the second episode. He had constructed an ending for the series as well as a detailed map of characters; however, the series finale concluded differently from planned. In November 2006, Maiellaro mentioned the possibility of continue the series with webisodes, and he wrote five additional scripts for ending the series, but finally, he only produced one webisode, entitled [...] "Enter the Sandmouse".|$|E

500|$|The first tunebook {{published}} in Maryland was the Baltimore Collection of Church Music by Alexander Ely in 1792, consisting mostly of hymns, {{with some more}} complex pieces described as anthems. In 1794, Joseph Carr established a shop in Baltimore, along with his sons Thomas and Benjamin, who ran shops in New York and Philadelphia. The Carrs {{would be the most}} successful publishing firm until around the start of the 19th century; however, they remained prominent until the company folded in 1821, and the Carrs were responsible for the first sheet music publication of [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] in 1814, arranged by Thomas Carr himself, and they also published European instrumentals and stage pieces, as well as works by Americans like James Hewitt and Alexander Reinagle. Much of this music was collected, in <b>serial</b> <b>format,</b> in the Musical Journal for the Piano Forte, which spanned five volumes and was the largest collection of secular music in the country.|$|E
500|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, {{a new style}} of novel became popular in France. The <b>serial</b> <b>format</b> known as the roman-feuilleton {{presented}} stories in short regular installments, often accompanied by melodramatic plots and stock characters. Although Balzac's La Vieille Fille (The Old Maid), 1836, was the first such work published in France, the roman-feuilleton gained prominence thanks mostly to his friends Eugène Sue and Alexandre Dumas, père. Balzac disliked their serial writing, however, especially Sue's socialist depiction of lower-class suffering. Balzac wanted to dethrone what he called [...] "les faux dieux de cette littérature bâtarde" [...] ("the false gods of this bastard literature"). He also wanted {{to show the world}} that, despite his poor health and tumultuous career, he was [...] "plus jeune, plus frais, et plus grand que jamais" [...] ("younger, fresher, and greater than ever"). His first efforts to render a quality feuilleton were unsuccessful. Even though Splendeurs et misères des courtisanes ("A Harlot High and Low"), published in segments from 1838 to 1847, was celebrated by critics, Balzac complained to Mme. Hanska that he was [...] "doing pure Sue". He tried again in 1844 with Modeste Mignon, but public reactions were mixed. Two years later Balzac began a new project, determined to create something from his [...] "own old pen again".|$|E
500|$|The series {{then changed}} to two episodes, each of thirty minutes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, per week in 1988 (from July 1988 onwards, the series also began being {{broadcast}} {{all year round}} without a summer break), increasing to three a week beginning in 1993, with the third episode being broadcast on Fridays. In 1998, The Bill returned to hour-long episodes, which later became twice-weekly, with the Friday episode being dropped, {{at which point the}} series adopted a much more serialised approach. When Paul Marquess took over as executive producer in 2002, as part of a drive for ratings, the series was revamped, bringing in a more soap opera type feel to many of its stories. Many veteran characters were written out, leading to the Sun Hill fire during 2002. Marquess stated that the clearout was necessary to introduce [...] "plausible, powerful new characters". As part of the new <b>serial</b> <b>format,</b> much more of the characters' personal lives were explored, however, as Marquess put it, the viewers still [...] "don't go home with them". The change also allowed The Bill to become more reflective of modern policing with the introduction of officers from ethnic minorities, most notably the new superintendent, Adam Okaro. It also allowed coverage of the relationship of homosexual Sergeant Craig Gilmore and PC Luke Ashton, a storyline which Marquess was determined to explore before rival Merseybeat.|$|E
