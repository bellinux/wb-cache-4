When Adam is told of Chelsea and Billy's new relationship, he attempts to leave his current dwelling, with Sage assuring him that he is not ready and that any attempt to leave would only compromise the progress of the surgeries he'd recently had. Adam eventually recovers enough to have the bandages removed from his face; after the bandages are removed it {{is revealed}} that his face had been replaced by Gabriel Bingham; the man who died saving Adam's life, he returns to Genoa City with Sage, he comes across the people he knows, but none of them recognize Adam or get the feeling that they know him somehow. Adam, under the alias of Gabriel, would pose as being married to Sage, in a ruse to claim Gabe's inheritance from Constance, however, they would later divorce in April 2015. He would reconnect with Chelsea, whom he confessed his true identity, and would slowly begin to piece their life back together, with plans to relocate to Paris, until Victor stepped in to sue for custody of Connor, keeping them in Genoa City. In October 2015, Adam's true identity was revealed and would help Sage deliver his nephew in Chancellor Park, following a heated confrontation between the two. Adam would stand trial for his role in Delia's death. He was sentenced for ten years, and upon leaving the courthouse, was run over by an unknown assailant.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In modern air combat operations, {{the mental}} {{workload}} for fighter pilots is extremely high. The pilot {{has to make}} fast dynamic decisions under high uncertainty and high time pressure. This is hard to perform in Within Visual Range (WVR) combat operations, but becomes even harder in Beyond Visual Range (BVR) combat operations where the on-board sensors of aircraft become the pilot's eyes and ears. Typically, the data received from multiple on-board and off-board sensors and sources is fused mentally by operators to produce a coherent air <b>surveillance</b> <b>picture</b> portraying tracks of airborne targets and their classification. Then the air <b>surveillance</b> <b>picture</b> is analyzed mentally to determine the behavior of each target {{with respect to the}} own ship and other targets in the region and assess the intent or threat that they pose or the impact they may have on the mission (situation assessment). As the number of targets grows or the situation escalates, the volume of available data from these sensors and sources may overload the operators. To assist them in such situations, it is desirable to automate some of the situation and threat assessment process. In this paper, a Fuzzy logic and Bayesian Network (BN) based hybrid technique is used to investigate the possibilities of design and implementation of an expert system named Intelligent System for Situation Assessment in Air-Combat (ISSAAC) as an aid to pilots engaged in aircombat. ISSAAC is a pilot-in-loop (PIL) simulator consisting of integration of platform models, sensor models, pilot mental models and data processing algorithms. The capability of ISSAAC is demonstrated by simulating an air-to-air combat scenario consisting of six targets. 1...|$|E
30|$|The STDMA {{algorithm}} presented herein {{is found}} in a standard for the shipping industry, automatic identification system (AIS) [26]‎. There are international regulations saying that ships larger than 300 gross ton must use AIS, which is a transponder technique. Every ship will transmit messages containing information about its position, heading, and so on, at a predetermined heartbeat rate. The AIS system is used for identifying ships in the vicinity and it is of great help in, for example, bad weather situation since false radar images are a problem. With AIS, the ship will build its own <b>surveillance</b> <b>picture</b> about the neighborhood using the messages received from other ships. Ships {{all over the world}} can meet and track each other through this system. AIS divides the time into one minute frames where each frame contains 2250 time slots and a transfer rate of 9.6 kbps is supported. Two different frequency channels, 161 [*]MHz and 162 [*]MHz, are used for communication and the ships will divide its messages between these two channels (called channel A and channel B). A message is 256 bits long and it fits into one time slot.|$|E

40|$|Proceedings of: NATO Advanced Study Institute (ASI) on Prediction and Recognition of Piracy Efforts Using Collaborative Human-Centric Information Systems, Salamanca, 19 - 30 September, 2011 Though piracy {{accounts}} for {{only a small fraction}} of the general losses of the maritime industry it creates a serious threat to the maritime security because of the connections between organized piracy and wider criminal networks and corruption on land. Fighting piracy requires monitoring the waterways, harbors,and criminal networks on the land to increase the ability of the decision makers to predict piracy attracts and manage operations to prevent or contain them. Piracy surveillance involves representing and processing huge amount heterogeneous information often uncertain, unreliable, and irrelevant within a specific context to detect and recognize suspicious activities to alert decision makers on vessel behaviors of interest with minimal false alarm. The paper discusses the role of information fusion, and context representation and utilization in building an piracy <b>surveillance</b> <b>picture.</b> This paper has utilized the results of the research activity supported in part by Projects CICYT TIN 2008 - 06742 -C 02 - 02 /TSI, CICYT TEC 2008 - 06732 -C 02 - 02 /TEC and CAM CONTEXTS (S 2009 /TIC- 1485) Publicad...|$|E
40|$|Harbor {{surveillance}} is {{a critical}} and challenging part of maritime security procedures. Building a <b>surveillance</b> <b>picture</b> to support decision makers in detection of potential threats requires the integration of data and information coming from heterogeneous sources. Context {{plays a key role}} in achieving this task by providing expectations, constraints and additional information for inference about the items of interest. This paper proposes a fusion system for context-based situation and threat assessment with application to harbor surveillance. The architecture of the system is organized in two levels. The lowest level uses an ontological model to formally represent input data and to classify harbor objects and basic situations by deductive reasoning according to the harbor regulations. The higher level applies Belief-based Argumentation to evaluate the threat posed by suspicious vessels. The functioning of the system is illustrated with several examples that reproduce common harbor scenarios. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|Modern fighter {{aircraft}} {{are equipped with}} Beyond Visual Range (BVR) missiles that can be fired at the enemy from very long distances. Since BVR combat occurs outside {{the range of the}} pilot's vision, they must rely on information from the on-board and off-board sensors and sources to determine the location of an opposing aircraft. Pilots make decisions based on the air <b>surveillance</b> <b>picture</b> portraying tracks of airborne targets that is obtained by mentally fusing the information coming from several sources. The workload on the pilots increases as the number of targets in combat arena grows or the situation becomes complex. Therefore to reduce the workload on the pilots, it is required to automate some of the decision making activity. In this paper, a decision support system named Intelligent System for Situation Assessment in Air-Combat (ISSAAC) is developed based on Fuzzy logic and Bayesian Network hybrid technique to assist the pilots participating in BVR combat.

Stuart, now a Detective Inspector, informs Mark that he is back in town after {{transferring}} from Leeds following the death of his police partner at the hands of Thomas Jordic (Wayne Michaels), a high collar criminal whom he has never been able to nail. Having recently suffered the loss of his baby son to cot death, Zara is struggling to interact with Mark, leading to him spending more and more time with Stuart. One Friday night, Stuart takes Mark out to a local club and shows him <b>surveillance</b> <b>pictures</b> of a man supposedly kissing Zara. Mark is furious, and proclaims he is going to kill her. Stuart calms him down, and pairs him up with a date, whose flat he ends up returning to. The next morning, Mark awakens and begins to stumble home. Stuart approaches him, and says that he has a surprise. He drives Mark out to a deserted field close to a nearby motorway, where Mark notices that Zara's car is parked. As Mark walks up to the car, he is shocked to find Zara dead, having slit her wrists. Stuart, however, claims that he killed her at Mark's request. Stuart claims that during their time at the club, Mark became so inebriated that he offered him £100,000 to kill Zara, in front of a number of witnesses.|$|R

40|$|Space {{surveillance}} requires capabilities for detection, tracking, {{imaging and}} characterization of specific objects in space environment. In general, most current space surveillance systems are single-sensor based {{and are not}} capable of generating the desired tracking accuracy, and providing required object characterization. A suite of various types of the sensors that are spatially or temporarily separated may thus be used collectively to synthesize a composite, improved <b>surveillance</b> <b>picture</b> through fusion and post processing of retrieved data. However, this approach will not yield the highest possible data accuracy due to the errors introduced in correlation of location, orientation and detection time from different sensors. Furthermore, it may not provide timely surveillance data to the user and hence may degrade the utility of these data. In this paper, we present the architecture, operational concept and preliminary design of an advanced integrated multi-sensor system (AIMS) for enhanced space surveillance capability to alleviate these shortfalls. AIMS employs an active laser tracking and multiple spectral domain (visible and multi-band IR) sensing to provide high-resolution tracking, three-dimensional imaging and reliable characterization of space objects with down range resolution of 1 cm and velocity measurement accuracy of 1 - 10 cm/sec in near real-time. The engineering and integration of a scale-down prototype of AIMS together with results of initial field tests are reported in this paper. Issues, lessons learned, future development plan and potential application of AIMS to space missions will be discussed. 1...|$|E
40|$|Interval Algebra {{provides}} {{an effective means}} to schedule surveillance radar networks, {{as it is a}} temporal ordering constraint language. Thus it provides a solution to a part of resource management, which is included in the revised Data Fusion Information Group model of information fusion. In this paper, the use of Interval Algebra to schedule mechanically steered radars to make multistatic measurements for selected targets of importance is shown. Interval Algebra provides a framework for incorporating a richer set of requirements, without requiring modi cations to the underlying algorithms. The performance of Interval Algebra was compared to that of the Greedy Randomised Adaptive Search Procedure and the applicability of Interval Algebra to nimble scheduling was investigated using Monte-Carlo simulations of a binary radar system. The comparison was done in terms of actual performance as well as in terms of computation time required. The performance of the algorithms was quanti ed by keeping track of the number of targets that could be measured simultaneously. It was found that nimble scheduling is important where the targets are moving fast enough to rapidly change the recognised <b>surveillance</b> <b>picture</b> during a scan. Two novel approaches for implementing Interval Algebra for scheduling surveillance radars are presented. It was found that adding targets on the y and improving performance by incrementally growing the network is more e cient than pre-creating the full network. The second approach stemmed from constraint ordering. It was found that for simple constraint sets, the Interval Algebra relationship matrix reduces to a single vector of interval sets. The simulations revealed that an Interval Algebra algorithm that utilises both approaches can perform as well as the Greedy Randomised Adaptive Search Procedure with similar processing time requirements. Finally, it was found that nimble scheduling is not required for surveillance radar networks where ballistic and supersonic targets can be ignored. Nevertheless, Interval Algebra can easily be used to perform nimble scheduling with little modi - cation and may be useful in scheduling the scans of multifunction radars.

30|$|This study {{presented}} a visual map to describe sero-geospatial burdens of {{contagious bovine pleuropneumonia}} in pastoral cattle herds of Niger State. Our findings suggest that sero-spatial maps of the disease should be institutionalized as an element of active surveillance and control strategies. The visualized proportional circle maps in the Agro-geographical zones using Global Positioning Systems and Geographical Information Systems have shown areas at risk of the disease, showing the devices’ usefulness in assessment of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia burdens in pastoral cattle herds. Application of disease risk maps becomes imperative to help in target surveillance and control activities. Routine production of these maps for contagious bovine pleuropneumonia and other infectious animal diseases in Nigeria {{has the potential to}} provide a more realistic active <b>surveillance</b> using visual <b>pictures</b> of different disease situations. Used critically and in conjunction with other tools such as sero-diagnosis, the maps would aid policy-makers with practical imageries for livestock disease control decisions in pastoral cattle herds.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Endobronchial {{ultrasonography}} (EBUS) {{has been}} shown to be an adequate tool to visualize the laminar structure of the bronchial wall. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential of EBUS to identify and quantitatively assess bronchial wall structures in lung transplant recipients. METHODS: EBUS was performed with a radial 20 -MHz ultrasonic miniprobe in lung transplant recipients undergoing <b>surveillance</b> bronchoscopies. Sequential <b>pictures</b> were taken of the main bronchus (proximal of anastomosis) and proximal right intermedius bronchus or proximal left lower lobe bronchus (distal of anastomosis), respectively. From every localization, five slides were chosen. The quantitative assessment of the digitized pictures was done with the aid of image analysis software. In addition to the comparison of the different layers between patients with and without infection and rejection, respectively, the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of the different measurements were calculated. RESULTS: From 20 EBUS examinations performed in 10 lung transplant recipients, 200 slides were selected for quantitative assessment. A five-layer composition could be identified in all selected slides. The relative area of layer two (hypoechoic submucosal tissue) of the autologous part was significantly smaller in patients with graft rejection (p = 0. 04) compared to patients without rejection, and significantly larger in patients with graft infection (p = 0. 02) compared to patients without graft infection. The ICC values were calculated in 50 different slides in a subset of five consecutive patients (0. 91, 0. 95, 0. 88, and 0. 91 for layers 1, 2, 3, and 5 of the autologous and 0. 70, 0. 92, 0. 88, and 0. 84 for the allogeneic parts, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: EBUS enables to discriminate different layers of the bronchi in humans and to measure the thickness of these layers in a reproducible fashion. Therefore, EBUS may be used to investigate and quantify inflammatory alterations of bronchial wall structures in vivo...|$|R
