5|$|Bath {{was charged}} with {{responsibility}} for the hot springs in a Royal Charter of 1591 granted by Elizabeth I. This duty has now passed to Bath and North East Somerset Council, who carry out monitoring of pressure, temperature and flow rates. The thermal waters contain sodium, calcium, chloride and <b>sulphate</b> ions in high concentrations.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to distinguish I.torosus from other similar boletes, such as I.rhodopurpureus. I.torosus displays the following characteristic colour changes with tests performed on cut flesh less than 12 hours old: ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH)–yellow centre bordered by a blue circular outer ring; potassium hydroxide (KOH)– deep buff (instantly); ferrous <b>sulphate</b> (FeS04)–no change; Melzer's reagent–dark blue; phenol–blue green (very slow); formalin–mid blue (slow).|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to help identify the mushroom. A drop of ammonium hydroxide solution turns the cap cuticle a greenish to bluish colour. Application of iron(II) <b>sulphate</b> solution causes the flesh to stain a dull bluish-green, while the pores turn golden brown with a drop of dilute potassium hydroxide.|$|E
30|$|<b>Sulphates</b> Probably <b>sulphates</b> {{are present}} in water streams due to {{utilization}} of sulphonates and sulphuric acid for various industrial processes such as tanning. Most of the time magnesium and calcium <b>sulphates</b> are responsible for permanent water hardness. The <b>sulphates</b> data obtained for all the effluent sample are listed in table 4. This data matches within the priscribed limit of WHO and US-EPA (Periyasamy and Rajan 2009).|$|R
40|$|Immunoreactive {{proteoglycans}} (iPGs) and <b>sulphated</b> glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) were assayed in {{synovial fluid}} obtained from 22 patients with osteoarthritis (OA), 21 with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 13 with gout, and five with Reiter's syndrome. A strong positive linear correlation was observed between concentrations of <b>sulphated</b> GAGs and iPGs in RA (r = 0. 95) and gout (r = 0. 94). A linear correlation was also observed in OA (r = 0. 65). Patients with gout and Reiter's syndrome {{had significantly higher}} concentrations of <b>sulphated</b> GAGs and iPGs than patients with OA or RA. Patients with gout also had significantly higher total quantities of <b>sulphated</b> GAGs and iPGs in the knee joint cavity than patients with OA or RA. In all four diseases similar profiles were observed when comparisons were made between the total quantities and concentrations of <b>sulphated</b> GAGs and iPGs in synovial fluid. These {{results indicate that the}} observed differences in concentrations are not simply a function of dilution. The concentrations of <b>sulphated</b> GAGs and iPGs did not correlate closely with the type or number of inflammatory cells in the synovial fluid. Considerable variation was noted in the <b>sulphated</b> GAG/iPG ratios, suggesting that different mechanisms may be contributing to the release of proteoglycans in the diseases studied...|$|R
40|$|The binding of the basement-membrane {{glycoprotein}} laminin to glycosaminoglycans (aggregating and non-aggregating subsets of heparan <b>sulphates</b> and dermatan <b>sulphates,</b> {{as well as}} heparin, chondroitin <b>sulphates</b> and hyaluronic acid) was {{studied by}} affinity chromatography. Partially periodate-oxidized chains of glycosaminoglycans were coupled to adipic acid dihydrazide-substituted agarose. Co-polymeric glycosaminoglycans reveal high affinity for laminin, whereas hyaluronic acid does not. Competitive-release experiments indicate that glycosaminoglycans share a common binding site on the laminin molecule...|$|R
5|$|Some {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to help identify the mushroom. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide placed on the cap cuticle will stain dark red to blackish, and orange-yellow on the flesh, while ferrous <b>sulphate</b> solution turns the cuticle yellow and then greenish-yellow. Melzer's reagent will turn the flesh dark blue, after the natural bluing reaction to injury has faded.|$|E
5|$|An {{experimental}} coating able {{to change}} color was tested on Royal Navy submarines. On suggestion by Professor Leslie Cromby, lead oxide {{was applied to the}} hull, enabling it to become black on application of a solution of sulphite and sea water for night operation. For day sailing, a solution of hydrogen peroxide and sea water would be applied, producing <b>sulphate</b> and returning the hull to a white colour desirable for daytime conditions.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, a bottlenose's {{sense of}} smell is poor, because its blowhole, the {{analogue}} to the nose, is closed when underwater and it opens only for breathing. It has no olfactory nerves or olfactory lobe in the brain. Bottlenose dolphins are able to detect salty, sweet, bitter (quinine <b>sulphate),</b> and sour (citric acid) tastes, but {{this has not been}} well-studied. Anecdotally, some individuals in captivity have been noted to have preferences for food fish types, although it is not clear if taste mediates this preference.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{stable isotope}} of the sulphur atom (34 S) and the 18 O of the <b>sulphates</b> (S 18 O 4) give {{information}} about the type of the mineralisation of the groundwater existing during the water seepage. The decrease of the concentrations in dissolved SO 42 − (meq/L) versus the increase of δ 18 O (‰ vs. SMOW) of the <b>sulphates</b> (S 18 O 42 −) confirms a partial reduction of the dissolved <b>sulphates</b> in the water. The Under-saturated waters versus the gypsum do not cause the precipitations of the <b>sulphates.</b> The study of δ 34 S (‰ CD) vs. Cl− (mg/L) indicates high variations in δ 34 S (‰ CD) for weak difference in the Cl− (mg/L) content, {{this is due to}} the reduction of the dissolved <b>sulphates.</b> Concerning the Jurassic water in Lebanon, an oxidation of the sulphide can take place...|$|R
50|$|The N-terminal cysteine-rich domain is {{homologous}} to the ricin B {{chain and}} binds to <b>sulphated</b> sugar moieties, with particularly high affinity for N-Acetylgalactosamine and galactose residues <b>sulphated</b> at positions 3 and 4 of their pyranose rings.|$|R
40|$|An {{attempt to}} find out {{possible}} ways to synthesise <b>sulphates</b> and oxalates, to be utilised for strengthening and consolidating limestone and frescos surfaces was made. Particularly organic <b>sulphates</b> were prepared and tested for their reactivity with barium salts, trying to obtain slow <b>sulphates</b> hydrolysis and, so, BaSO 4 precipitation. Different solutions were applied on Opificio delle Pietre Dure´s standards using different methodologies and applications times. The characterisation of chemical interactions between carbonaceous bodies and solutions was done by X-ray diffraction (XRPD), Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTAR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDS). The synthesis of organic <b>sulphates</b> resulted not difficult and the solutions are very easy to use. More difficult was oxalate synthesis. The application results are promising...|$|R
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to help verify an identification of L.holopus. A drop of ammonium hydroxide solution turns the cap cuticle a pinkish color, but has no reaction with the flesh. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) has no reaction on the cap surface, and either no reaction or a brownish reaction with the flesh. Application of iron (II) <b>sulphate</b> solution does not have a reaction on the cap surface, and either no reaction to slightly olive coloration on the flesh.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to help verify an identification of L.rugosiceps. A drop of ammonium hydroxide solution turns the cap cuticle a reddish color or is unreactive, and yellow or unreactive on the flesh. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) turns the cap surface red, and the flesh yellowish to orangish. Application of iron (II) <b>sulphate</b> solution produces a gray color on the cap surface, and greenish-gray to olive coloration on the flesh.|$|E
5|$|Sodium lauryl <b>sulphate</b> (SLS), a {{detergent}} {{present in}} some brands of toothpaste and other oral healthcare products, may produce oral ulceration in some individuals. It {{has been shown}} that aphthous stomatitis is more common in people using toothpastes containing SLS, and that some reduction in ulceration occurs when a SLS-free toothpaste is used. Some have argued that since SLS is almost ubiquitously used in oral hygiene products, there is unlikely to be a true predisposition for aphthous stomatitis caused by SLS.|$|E
30|$|The {{intraperitoneal}} {{administration of}} acetaminophen caused marked hepatic necrosis with fatty changes, infiltration of polymorphonuclear cells, abnormal central vein and sinusoidal morphological pattern. Crude <b>sulphated</b> polysaccharides from S. swartzii (EW 1 fraction) showed considerable reduction in pathological changes that produced after acetaminophen administration. The <b>sulphated</b> polysaccharides from S. swartzii extracted {{at room temperature}} (EW 1 fraction) prevented hepatic necrosis similar to the rats pretreated with silymarin (35 [*]mg/kg) in acetaminophen-intoxicated rats. Raghavendran & Srinivasan [17], reported {{that a number of}} necrotic cells were depleted in rats co-treated with <b>sulphated</b> polysaccharides and acetaminophen. This might be due to the presence of high sulfate content in seaweed polysaccharides, which inhibit oxidative stress [44]. Ross et al. [33] reported that administration of <b>sulphated</b> polysaccharides from Sargassum siliquosum produced mild hepatocellular degeneration suggesting their protective role. The <b>sulphated</b> polysaccharides from Sargassum wightii showed considerable reduction in the pathological changes produced after cyclosporine A-induced liver injury animals [32]. This protective action may possibly be due to its effect of preserving the cellular membrane of the hepatocytes from breakage by the reactive metabolites [45]. The <b>sulphated</b> polysaccharides extracted at room temperature and at 70 [*]°C had completely different chemical compositions [19].|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of collagen in enameloid distinguishes it clearly from true enamel, but {{little is known}} about the phylogenetic relationship between these 2 tissues. It has previously been reported that amelogenins are the principal proteins of the enamel matrix, that type I collagen and chondroitin <b>sulphates</b> are the predominant matrices in dentine, and that amphibian and reptilian aprismatic enamels contain no <b>sulphated</b> glycoconjugates, although certain <b>sulphated</b> substances are secreted into mammalian prismatic enamel during matrix formation. The larval urodele (Triturus pyrrhogaster) teeth are known to be composed of enameloid, dentine, and enamel-like tissue. To characterise the tooth matrices, the localisation of amelogenin-like proteins, type I collagen, and <b>sulphated</b> glycoconjugates was investigated. Chondroitin <b>sulphates</b> and fine fibrils immunoreactive for type I collagen were elaborated as the enameloid matrix inside the dental basement membrane. After the matrix had been deposited in full thickness, coarse collagen fibrils also immunoreactive for type I collagen and chondroitin <b>sulphates</b> were deposited below as the first dentine matrix. Further, enamel-like matrix with no collagen fibrils or <b>sulphated</b> glycoconjugates but strongly immunoreactive for amelogenins was deposited on the dentine. Although no immunolabelling for amelogenins was found over the enameloid matrix, at least at the formation stage, the zone of coarse collagen fibrils of dentine was partially immunoreactive as observed in mammalian mantle dentine. From the ontogeny and matrix constituents of larval urodele teeth, it is suggested that enameloid is originally a dentine-like tissue...|$|R
30|$|No {{significant}} differences in the content of <b>sulphated</b> GAGs in CDLs in different mechanical states was observed, suggesting that <b>sulphated</b> GAGs act exclusively as binding sites for effector molecules (e.g. tensilin). Further work {{needs to be done to}} look for non-sulphated GAGs in the CDL.|$|R
5|$|Various {{chemical}} color {{tests can}} be used to help identify fruit bodies suspected to be S.amygdalinus. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) will turn the cap flesh dingy orange, while it turns the cap cuticle red, or darker. Ammonia (as ammonium hydroxide, NH4OH) produces a dingy yellow on the flesh, and brown on the cap. Iron <b>sulphate</b> (FeSO4) produces either no change to a pale grey color with both the flesh and the cuticle. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) causes the flesh to turn orange or pink, but has no color reaction with the cuticle.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{not widely}} cultivated, Alloxylon flammeum {{has proven to be}} by far the most hardy and {{adaptable}} (as well as the showiest) member of the genus Alloxylon, and has been grown successfully in as cool a climate as Victoria. It does best in a well-drained soil rich in organic material but low in phosphorus with some shelter when young. Applying mulch to the soil around the plant and extra water in dry spells is beneficial. Fertilisers high in phosphorus content can damage the plant, though fertilisers specifically for Australian native plants can be used. Yellowing of new leaves may indicate chlorosis from iron deficiency and can be remedied with iron chelate or iron <b>sulphate.</b> Its flowers attract birds to gardens. A large tree grows in the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney. It is thought that there are more plants in cultivation than there are in the wild.|$|E
5|$|In {{laboratory}} experiments, extracts of I. badia fruit {{bodies have}} been shown to have significant antioxidative properties in vitro. Fruit bodies contain the compound theanine, an amino acid and a glutamic acid analogue found in green tea. Efforts have been made to establish a protocol for producing theanine by growing the fungus mycelium using submerged fermentation. Several indole compounds have been detected in fruit bodies. Unprocessed mushrooms contain tryptophan (0.68mg per 100g dry weight), tryptamine (0.47), serotonin (0.52), kynurenine <b>sulphate</b> (1.96), and kynurenic acid (1.57). Due to their temperature sensitivity, cooking significantly changes the contents and composition of indole compounds: cooked mushrooms contained tryptophan (1.74mg/100g dw), 5-methyltryptophan (6.55), melatonin (0.71), and indoleacetonitrile (2.07). Fruit body extracts {{have been shown}} to slow the growth of certain tumour cell lines in cell culture.|$|E
40|$|Glycosaminoglycans {{have been}} {{demonstrated}} throughout the cutaneous BMZ at the ultrastructural level. Colloidal iron and cationised ferritin proved of limited value, whilst staining with Alcian blue and application of the critical electrolyte concentration principle has provided evidence {{for the presence of}} <b>sulphated</b> GAGs at the lamina lucida and lamina reticularis. Digestions with chondroitin ABC lyase and heparin lyase have confirmed the existence of chondroitin and/or dermatan <b>sulphates</b> and heparan <b>sulphates,</b> although the results obtained with hyaluronate lyase have indicated that hyaluronates are also present...|$|R
50|$|Cartilage KSII {{is almost}} entirely <b>sulphated,</b> {{consisting}} of disulphated monomers interrupted occasionally by a single monosulphated lactosamine monomer. Fucosylation is also common with alpha-linked fucose present at the carbon 3 position of <b>sulphated</b> GlcNAc, except {{in the case of}} tracheal KSII where this feature is absent.|$|R

5|$|Most {{traditional}} {{or historical}} first-aid treatments for redback spider bites are either useless or dangerous. These include making incisions and promoting bleeding, using ligatures, applying alkaline solutions, providing warmth, and sucking the venom out. In modern first aid, incising, sucking, applying bandages and tourniqueting are strongly discouraged. In 1893, the Camperdown Chronicle {{reported that a}} doctor noticed that a severely ill benumbed victim got much better overnight following treatment using injections of strychnine and cocaine; strychnine had been popular as a snake bite antidote, {{but it was not}} effective. As of 2011, administration of magnesium <b>sulphate</b> was reported to have had some benefit though evidence of effectiveness is weak.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} pumping {{water from the}} mines {{introduces}} oxygen via aeration, thereby oxidising the rock's pyrite. Pyrite contains sulfur, and one consequence of its oxidation is the introduction of significant amounts of sulphates into mine water. This has had {{a negative impact on}} water quality in five lakes in the Kurtna Lake District. In some lakes, <b>sulphate</b> levels have increased tens of times compared to the pre-mining period. Suspended mineral matter in the mine water pumped into these lakes has changed the composition of the lakes' sediments. However, it has been found that this disturbance diminishes over time; studies show that sulphates and iron in mining water decrease to levels that meet drinking water quality standards about five years after mine closure.|$|E

40|$|<b>Sulphates</b> in wastewaters have an origin as the {{by-products}} of {{a variety}} of industrial operations. A specific and major producer of such effluents, which contained <b>sulphates</b> and heavy metals, is the mining industry.

40|$|A {{number of}} recent reports {{concerning}} the inhibitory action of <b>sulphated</b> polysaccharides on d strains of poliovirus prompted a reinvestigation of the factors involved. It was found that polyglucose compounds in agar are not released in concentrations sufficient to inhibit viruses under the overlay conditionsused for suppressing d strains of poliovirus. Furthermore, <b>sulphated</b> polyanions in agar cannot be the critical factor, since d strains of poliovirus are also suppressed under other solidifying agents (starch gel and methylceIlu-lose) which are free of <b>sulphated</b> polyglucose. Purified agar free of <b>sulphated</b> polysaccharides, used with medium containing a low bicarbonate concentra-tion attains the same high pH after equilibration as regular agar (containing polyanions) made up with high concentrations of bicarbonate, {{and it is this}} high pH which appears to explain the ready growth of d strains of poliovirus...|$|R
40|$|Potent and {{specific}} inhibitors of hyaluronidases, {{a group of}} enzymes preferentially catalysing the hydrolysis of hyaluronic acid, are not known so far. Such compounds could be useful as pharmacological tools for studying the physiological and pathophysiological role of both hyaluronan and hyaluronidases. The effects of <b>sulphated</b> and non-sulphated structurally different oligosaccharides on bovine testicular hyaluronidase, hyaluronidase from bee venom and hyaluronate lyase from Streptococcus agalactiae (hylB (4755)) were studied with the Morgan-Elson reaction. Several active compounds were identified within a series of <b>sulphated</b> beta-(1, 4) -galacto-oligosaccharides. The determined IC (50) values of these <b>sulphated</b> oligosaccharides ranged from 4 microM to 630 microM for all hyaluronan-degrading enzymes. <b>Sulphated</b> oligosaccharides like verbascose, planteose and neomycin showed comparable inhibition on all hyaluronidases, thereby possessing 100 - 500 times {{the activity of the}} widely accepted hyaluronidase inhibitor apigenin...|$|R

25|$|Ionisation isomerismnbsp&– the isomers give {{different}} ions in solution {{although they}} have the same composition. This type of isomerism occurs when the counter ion of the complex is also a potential ligand. For example, pentaamminebromocobalt(III) <b>sulphate</b> SO4 is red violet and in solution gives a precipitate with barium chloride, confirming the presence of <b>sulphate</b> ion, while pentaamminesulphatecobalt(III) bromide Br is red and tests negative for <b>sulphate</b> ion in solution, but instead gives a precipitate of AgBr with silver nitrate.|$|E
