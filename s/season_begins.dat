5|$|Season three {{continues}} the story 67 {{days after the}} crash. The <b>season</b> <b>begins</b> where the second season left off: three of the crash survivors are held in captivity by the mysterious Others. More backstory on the Others, {{as well as the}} Dharma Initiative, is revealed. The survivors face continuous threats from their enemies, and also from their friends. The survivors attempt to make contact with a freighter which they believe is there to rescue them. Season three takes place over 24 days.|$|E
5|$|The curve-billed {{breeding}} <b>season</b> <b>begins</b> in February {{and reaches}} an apex between March and May; however, new fledglings {{have been recorded}} as late as August. Dates vary within its range due to temperature and rainfall. Nests are generally built at conspicuous locations, the cholla being favored. Other potential nesting sites range from mesquite, prickly pear or yucca to the occasional oak and pine trees. The nest is generally a deep cup but can be flat with a depression for the eggs. The outer layer consists of thorny twigs while the inner layer includes smooth sticks, roots, coarse and fine grasses, rootlets or hair.|$|E

5|$|Alates are {{collected}} when the rainy <b>season</b> <b>begins.</b> During a nuptial flight, they are typically seen around lights {{to which they}} are attracted, and so nets are set up on lamps and captured alates are later collected. The wings are removed through a technique that is similar to winnowing. The best result comes when they are lightly roasted on a hot plate or fried until crisp. Oil is not required as their bodies usually contain sufficient amounts of oil. Termites are typically eaten when livestock is lean and tribal crops have not yet developed or produced any food, or if food stocks from a previous growing season are limited.|$|E
5|$|French cuisine varies {{according}} to the season. In summer, salads and fruit dishes are popular because they are refreshing and produce is inexpensive and abundant. Greengrocers prefer to sell their fruit and vegetables at lower prices if needed, rather than see them rot in the heat. At the end of summer, mushrooms become plentiful and appear in stews throughout France. The hunting <b>season</b> <b>begins</b> in September and runs through February. Game of all kinds is eaten, often in elaborate dishes that celebrate {{the success of the}} hunt. Shellfish are at their peak when winter turns to spring, and oysters appear in restaurants in large quantities.|$|E
5|$|In the wild, the {{breeding}} season for Campbell's dwarf hamster varies by location. For example, {{the breeding}} <b>season</b> <b>begins</b> towards {{the middle of}} April in Tuva and {{towards the end of}} April in Mongolia. However, in captivity, there is no fixed breeding season and they can breed frequently throughout the year. Females are usually sexually mature at two months of age and the gestation period is typically 20 days. Campbell's dwarf hamster is crepuscular, along with all species of Phodopus and is active throughout the year. Campbell's dwarf hamsters are omnivores, and so feed on both plant and insect material. Campbell's dwarf hamster inhabits burrows with four to six horizontal and vertical tunnels in the steppes and semi deserts of central Asia, the Altai mountains, autonomous areas of Tuva and the Hebei province in northeastern China.|$|E

5|$|Males {{are sexually}} mature {{by the time}} they are a year old, though {{successful}} mating generally occurs only after four years. Mature males start establishing territories and try to gain access to females. Females can conceive after they are {{a year and a half}} old; oestrus lasts for 24 to 48 hours, and occurs every 12–29 days in non-pregnant females. The annual three-week-long rut (breeding <b>season)</b> <b>begins</b> toward the end of the wet season, typically in May. Gonadal growth and hormone production in males begin a few months before the breeding season, resulting in greater aggressiveness and territoriality. The bulbourethral glands are heavier, testosterone levels are nearly twice as high in territorial males as in bachelors, and the neck of a territorial male tends to be thicker than that of a bachelor during the rut. Mating tends to take place between full moons.|$|E
5|$|Many unique {{varieties}} of mango are {{native to the}} country, most having been developed {{during the second half}} of the 20th century. New and improved mango varieties are still introduced to markets every few years. Arguably the most popular variety is the Maya type, which is small to medium in size, fragrant, colourful (featuring 3-4 colours) and usually fiberless. The Israeli mango <b>season</b> <b>begins</b> in May, and the last of the fruit ripen as October draws near. Different varieties are present on markets at different months, with the Maya type seen between July and September. Mangos are frequently used in fusion dishes and for making Sorbet.|$|E
5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} is a herbivore, feeding {{primarily on}} the short grasses. It forms herds which move about in loose aggregations, the animals being fast runners and extremely wary. The mating <b>season</b> <b>begins</b> {{at the end of}} the rainy season and a single calf is usually born after a gestational period of about eight and a half months. The calf remains with its mother for eight months, after which time it joins a juvenile herd. Blue wildebeest are found in short grass plains bordering bush-covered acacia savannas in southern and eastern Africa, thriving in areas that are neither too wet nor too arid. Three African populations of blue wildebeest take part in a long-distance migration, timed to coincide with the annual pattern of rainfall and grass growth on the volcanic soil short-grass plains where they can find the nutrient-rich forage necessary for lactation and calf growth.|$|E

5|$|The <b>season</b> <b>begins</b> with Veronica's life {{returning}} {{to the way it}} was before Lilly's death: having broken up with Logan during the summer, she reunites with Duncan and is somewhat accepted by the 09ers. However, her tough personality and work as a private investigator keep her from being truly assimilated back into the rich crowd. 09ers Dick and Cassidy are abandoned by their father, who flees the country while under investigation for real estate fraud. The brothers are forced to deal with their stepmother, Kendall (Charisma Carpenter), who is only interested in their father's money. Wallace discovers that his biological father is alive and takes a romantic interest in Jackie.|$|E
5|$|The second <b>season</b> <b>begins</b> with Rachel {{waiting at}} the gate for Ross to declare her love for him. However, she discovers that he is dating Julie (Lauren Tom), someone he knew from {{graduate}} school. Rachel's attempts to tell Ross she likes him mirror his failed attempts in the first season, although the characters eventually begin a relationship. Joey gets cast in a part in a fictional version of the soap opera Days of Our Lives, but his character is killed off after conflicts with the show's writers, claiming that he writes many of his own lines. Chandler gets back with Janice, his ex-girlfriend from season one. Monica begins dating Richard (Tom Selleck), a recently divorced family friend and 21 years her senior. In the season finale, they end their relationship when they realize that unlike Monica, Richard does not want children.|$|E
5|$|Three African {{populations of}} blue {{wildebeest}} {{take part in}} a long-distance migration, timed to coincide with the annual pattern of rainfall and grass growth on the volcanic soil short-grass plains where they can find the nutrient-rich forage necessary for lactation and calf growth. The timing of the migration in both directions can vary considerably from year to year. At the end of the rainy season, they migrate to dry-season areas in response to a lack of drinking water. When the rainy <b>season</b> <b>begins</b> again a few months later, the animals trek back to their wet-season range. These movements and access to nutrient rich forage for reproduction allow migratory wildebeest populations to grow to much larger numbers than resident populations. There were many long-distance migratory populations of wildebeest 100 years ago, but currently all but three migrations (Serengeti, Tarangire, and Kafue) have been disrupted, cut off, and lost.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{the name}} of the show plays on the word The News, the literal gallows humor of the program's name is {{unlikely}} to be missed by viewers in a country which executes people by hanging, and the use of [...] "neck-cuffs". The show satirises socio-cultural and political issues in Singapore as well as newsworthy local and regional incidents involving Singapore. The third <b>season</b> <b>began</b> airing on June 1, 2010. The fourth <b>season</b> <b>began</b> airing on March 8, 2011. The fifth <b>season</b> <b>began</b> airing on December 27, 2011 and features topics such as the Mayan Calendar and doomsday and other relevant current issues. A sixth <b>season</b> <b>began</b> airing on April 2, 2013, aligned with the renumbering of Mediacorp news programmes. Michelle Chong will not return to the cast for the sixth season. A seventh <b>season</b> <b>began</b> airing on 1 April 2014 (April Fools' Day), with Chong set to return to the show.|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{other species}} of the family Cotingidae, the Guianan cock-of-the-rock makes its nest on rocky cliff faces and caves {{rather than in the}} trees. The female lays one or two eggs in the nest of mud and plant material, which is {{attached}} by saliva to a vertical rock. The male does not participate in the building of the nest or the incubation of the eggs. Eggs typically incubate for 27–28 days. The ideal nesting sites for this species are usually located in a cave or vertical rock face with crevices that provide some shelter and protection from the elements. The nests themselves are solid moldings formed from mud and plant material deposited into the crevices. Due to the solid nature of these nests, they typically persist from one breeding season to the next. Females will make repairs to their nests as a breeding <b>season</b> <b>begins.</b>|$|E
5|$|Each year, some East African {{populations of}} blue {{wildebeest}} have a long-distance migration, seemingly timed {{to coincide with}} the annual pattern of rainfall and grass growth. The timing of their migrations in both the rainy and dry seasons can vary considerably (by months) from year to year. At the end of the wet season (May or June in East Africa), wildebeest migrate to dry-season areas in response to a lack of surface (drinking) water. When the rainy <b>season</b> <b>begins</b> again (months later), animals quickly move back to their wet-season ranges. Factors suspected to affect migration include food abundance, surface water availability, predators, and phosphorus content in grasses. Phosphorus is a crucial element for all life forms, particularly for lactating female bovids. As a result, during the rainy season, wildebeest select grazing areas that contain particularly high phosphorus levels. One study found, in addition to phosphorus, wildebeest select ranges containing grass with relatively high nitrogen content.|$|E
5|$|International {{distribution}} {{rights were}} bought by Portman Film and Television, which sold the series to 14 international networks by February 2007. Seven regional European Hallmark Channels broadcast it, with other showings on NRK in Norway, RÚV in Iceland, YLE in Finland, Rai Tre in Italy and één in Flanders. The Australian rights {{were picked up}} by the Seven Network, although the ABC aired seasons 1 and 2 in 2011 and season 3 late in 2012, with TVNZ buying it for New Zealand. The programme aired in the United States on some PBS affiliates in early 2008. A wider syndication deal was struck with American Public Television later that year for the first two series to be available to all affiliates, and other public stations; the third <b>season</b> <b>begins</b> distribution on 1 December 2009. In Canada, the first and second series are being broadcast this year, (April–June, 2010), on the Vision TV network. The third series premièred on the Flemish channel één on 10 April 2009.|$|E

5|$|Shortly before mating <b>season</b> <b>begins,</b> females exhibit {{swelling}} of the sex skin, which reaches its peak around {{the middle of their}} 14.8 day estrous cycle. Male sexual physiology also undergoes its own change, with testicular volume increasing during mating season, peaking around the time of breeding. Aggression also increases during the mating season, both between members of the same sex and by females towards the male attempting to mate with her. Females have been observed grappling, cuffing, and biting the male during copulation. Either sex may approach the other when the female is in estrus. Initially they may roar-shriek with each other. When a male approaches a female he often lowers his head and squeals, inspecting the female's genitalia by licking or sniffing, scent-marking, and offering a submissive chattering vocalization. When a female approaches a male, she may posture herself for mounting. Mating pairs often copulate many times {{during the course of a}} mating bout.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} {{season for the}} Central American squirrel monkey is in September. All females come into estrus at virtually the same time. A month or two before the breeding <b>season</b> <b>begins,</b> males become larger. This is not due to extra muscle, but to altered water balance within the male's body. This is caused by conversion of the male hormone testosterone into estrogen; thus the more testosterone a male produces, the more he grows {{in advance of the}} {{breeding season}}. Since males within a group have not been observed fighting over access to females during breeding season, nor attempting to force females to copulate with them, it is believed that female choice determines which males get to breed with females. Females tend to prefer the males that expand the most in advance of breeding season. This may be because the most enlarged males are generally the oldest and the most effective at detecting predators, or it may be a case of runaway intersexual selection.|$|E
5|$|The <b>season</b> <b>begins</b> with Rowan {{attempting}} to fix Olivia's {{personal life and}} Olivia teaming with Mellie and Fitz for {{a press conference to}} reveal the truth about her and Fitz. Olivia and Rowan disagree about the purpose of B613, which Rowan currently heads. Olivia has an emotional history with Huck. She teams with Jake and Huck to expose Operation Remington. Olivia's mother, Maya Lewis (Khandi Alexander), is introduced both in the present day and in flashbacks. Olivia comes to believe that her father had made the decision to kill her mother, which was very different than her prior beliefs about her mother's death. Believing that her father and Fitz conspired to shoot down a plane with her mother on board, Olivia becomes the client of her own firm. It is later revealed that her mother is alive and has been held prisoner by her father in a maximum security prison for 20 years for national security reasons. Lewis escapes. The midseason hiatus from mid-December to late-February left off with Olivia sending her mother abroad. However, Olivia realizes that her mother is a terrorist who married her father for his access to high level intelligence.|$|E
