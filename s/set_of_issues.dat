25|$|Another <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>issues</b> {{concerns}} {{the nature of}} critique, often replaying debates over (what can be crudely termed) universalism and relativism, where modernism is seen to represent the former and postmodernity the latter. Seyla Benhabib (1995) and Judith Butler (1995) pursue this debate in relation to feminist politics, Benhabib arguing that postmodern critique comprises three main elements; an anti-foundationalist concept of the subject and identity, the death of history and of notions of teleology and progress, {{and the death of}} metaphysics defined as the search for objective truth. Benhabib argues forcefully against these critical positions, holding that they undermine the bases upon which feminist politics can be founded, removing the possibility of agency, the sense of self-hood and the appropriation of women’s history in the name of an emancipated future. The denial of normative ideals removes the possibility for utopia, central for ethical thinking and democratic action.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} popular topics of {{discussion}} in regards to Internet privacy is China. The main concern with privacy of Internet users in China is the lack thereof. China has a well known policy of censorship {{when it comes to the}} spread of information through public media channels. Censorship has been prominent in Mainland China since the communist party gained power in China over 60 years ago. With the development of the Internet, however, privacy became more of a problem for the government. The Chinese Government has been accused of actively limiting and editing the information that flows into the country via various media. The Internet poses a particular <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>issues</b> for this type of censorship, especially when search engines are involved. Yahoo! for example, encountered a problem after entering China in the mid-2000s. A Chinese journalist, who was also a Yahoo! user, sent private emails using the Yahoo! server regarding the Chinese government. The Chinese staff of Yahoo! intercepted these emails and sent the journalist’s reportedly bad impression of the country to the Chinese government, which in turn sentenced the journalist to ten years in prison. These types of occurrences have been reported numerous times and have been criticized by foreign entities such as the creators of the Tor anonymity network, which was designed to circumvent network surveillance in multiple countries.|$|E

500|$|Developments in Russia posed another <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>issues</b> for the monarchy. Tsar NicholasII of Russia was King George's {{first cousin}} {{and the two}} monarchs looked very much alike. When Nicholas was overthrown in the Russian Revolution of 1917, the liberal Russian Government asked that the tsar and his family be given asylum in Britain. [...] The cabinet agreed but the king was worried that public opinion was hostile and said no. [...] It is likely the tsar would have refused to leave Russia in any case. He {{remained}} and in 1918 {{he and his family}} were ordered killed by Lenin, the Bolshevik leader.|$|E

[...] Accolade's Alan Miller expressed more excitement with the settlement and the opportunities it presented for the company, saying in his statement, [...] "We are very pleased with the settlement, and we're excited about the new markets it opens to Accolade. Accolade currently experiences strong demand for its Sega Genesis products in North America and Europe. We will now be able to publish our products on the Sega Genesis and Game Gear systems throughout the world." [...] Despite the settlement, however, Accolade had lost somewhere between $15 million and $25 million during the injunction period, according to Miller.|$|E
500|$|Mellor's earlier works {{examined}} {{the relationships between}} cultures, including in his mezzotint prints in which he juxtaposed [...] "images of native and introduced flora and fauna—for example, a kangaroo with a bull—to symbolise two different peoples and cultures". These issues were also addressed in his painting for the exhibition Native Titled Now, shown in South Australia in 1996. Mellor's interest in cultural interactions extends beyond the making of his art. In a panel discussion on Indigenous art education, Mellor emphasised that, in teaching Indigenous art within visual arts, {{it was important to}} be aware of both Aboriginal and settler history, [...] "so you can talk about their interaction and the whole <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>issues</b> that arise from those two things being parallel". Mellor's emphasis on past interactions between cultures led gallerist and critic Michael Reid to consider that Mellor's works had earned him [...] "an important place in the visual narrative of Australian history".|$|E
500|$|In 1965, the {{influence}} of artists such as Bob Dylan, who moved beyond political protest by experimenting with abstract and surreal lyrical imagery, then switched to electric guitar, became increasingly pervasive across the musical landscape, affecting a number of genres, including garage rock. [...] The members of garage bands, like so many musicians of the 1960s, {{were part of a}} generation that was largely born into the paradigm and customs of an older time, but grew up confronting a new <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>issues</b> facing a more advanced and technological age. [...] Postwar prosperity brought the advantages of better education, was well as more spare time for recreation, which along with the new technology, made it possible for an increasing number of young people to play music. [...] With the advent of television, nuclear weapons, civil rights, the Cold War, and space exploration, the new generation was more global in its mindset and began to conceive of a higher order of human relations, attempting to reach for a set of transcendent ideals, often expressed through rock music. [...] Though set to a backdrop of tragic events that ultimately proved disillusioning, the various forms of personal and musical experimentation held promise, at least for a time, in the minds of many. [...] While testing the frontiers of what the new world had to offer, 1960s youth ultimately had to accept the limitations of the new reality, yet often did so while experiencing the ecstasy of a moment when the range of possibilities seemed boundless and within reach.|$|E

40|$|Hannah Arendt has {{influenced}} the engagements of scholars in every field. Herthinking {{on issues such}} as community building, feminist scholarship, anti-Semitism,epistemology, freedom and responsibility have been interpreted and readapted tocontexts much broader than Arendt might have imagined. For those philosophersspecifically grounded in <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> education Arendt has been particularly influentialand even controversial when it comes to education and the conservancy of such. Fromtheoretical contemplation to operationalization, Arendt continues to frame and guideconversations about agency, citizenship and moral and ethical responsibilities. Music educators have not been exempt from the lure and guidance of Arendt. We,however, face different <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>issues</b> as we think through what it would mean tocreate the conditions for an Arendtian framing of action in musicing environments.
