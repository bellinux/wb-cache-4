40|$|Reared larval and {{juvenile}} <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> Hippoglossus hippoglossus collected during incidences of mass mortality in 2 hatcheries were studied by light and electron microscopy. A vacuolating encephalopathy and retinopathy {{as well as}} endocardial lesions were observed. By transmission electron microscopy isometric, spherical, unenveloped virus particles with mean capsid diameters of approximately 25 nm were detected. The virions were found intracytoplasmically in semicrystalline arrays or as membrane-associated aggregates and single particles. Infection could be observed in neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia/macrophages, lymphocyte-like cells, vascular endothelium, endocardial endothelium, myocardial myocytes and in the mesothelium of the epicardium. Specific immunolabeling was obtained in affected tissues on immunohistochemistry applying primary antisera against nodaviruses isolated from the striped jack Pseudocaranx dentex and the sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax. We suggest that the mortality {{was caused by a}} nodavirus-like agent and that this disease of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> is closely related to diseases termed viral nervous necrosis (VNN), viral encephalopathy and retinopathy, and fish encephalitis, which have been associated with mass mortality in numerous cultured marine teleost <b>species.</b> In <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut,</b> viral endocardial lesions were a constant finding, suggesting that viremia may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of the infection...|$|R
40|$|Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is an {{important}} regulator of growth and development in vertebrates. Both the endocrine and paracrine actions of IGF-I are mediated through ligand-binding to a membrane-bound IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR). The characterization of this receptor and subsequent expression studies thus help elucidate the endocrine regulation of developmental processes. As other flatfish <b>species,</b> the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) undergoes a dramatic larval metamorphosis. This process is largely under endocrine control, and data indicate that IGF-I could be a key regulator. IGF-I content increases up to late pre-metamorphosis and decreases during metamorphosis. The IGF-IR has, however, not been studied during flatfish metamorphosis. To examine IGF-IR gene expression, two IGF-IR mRNA were cloned and sequenced. These partial sequences share high identity (≥ 95 %) and similarity (≥ 97 %) with other fish IGF-IR and lower identity (≥ 77 %) and similarity (≥ 83. 5 %) with Japanese flounder insulin receptors. The expression of mRNA for both IGF-IR was analyzed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR during six larval developmental stages from pre- to post-metamorphosis. IGF-IR 1 and IGF-IR 2 mRNA are differentially expressed during metamorphosis, but if this indicates an isoform-specific regulation of developmental processes by circulating and/or locally-secreted IGF-I is unclear. Both IGF-IR genes are down-regulated in halibut larvae experiencing arrested metamorphosis, suggesting the IGF-I system is critical for metamorphic success in halibut...|$|R
30|$|Jaw {{malformation}} is a {{major concern}} in fish culture because it affects fish morphology and quality at the growout stage (Von Westernhagen 1988). In the present study, the proportion of fish larvae exhibiting jaw deformities increased with the increase of water temperature, and peaked at 33  °C. Similar results have also been found in other fish <b>species</b> such as <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> Hippoglossus hippoglossus (Lein et al. 1997) and Pacific herring Clupea pallasi (Alderdice and Velsen 1971). Such a temperature-dependent developmental pattern is generally attributed to high oxygen (Rombough 1997) and high nutritional requirements at high temperatures, which may not be fulfilled unless the feed with high energy or protein contents is provided (Cahu et al. 2003 a, b; Ma 2014). Furthemore, temperature fluctuation might also interfere with the harmonic development of functional organs such as the digestive tract and skeleton, leading to skeletal deformities at high temperature. In the present study, fertilized fish eggs hatched at 26  °C, and yolk sac larvae were acclimatized at each desired temperature for 5  h on 2 DPH. The quick increase of rearing temperature from 26 to 29 or 33  °C may affect skeletogenesis and induce jaw deformity.|$|R

In this study, the effect of maternally derived oocyte constituents (i. e. yolk components and mRNAs) on oocyte quality (i. e fertilisation, embryonic hatching and normal blastomere symmetry) in farmed <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> has been investigated. <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> embryos and larvae depend on nutritional yolk components until larval first feeding. The importance of yolk n- 3 fatty acids for oocyte quality was confirmed. However, highest positive correlations with oocyte quality were found for the less studied fatty acids dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA, 20 : 3 n 6) and docosapentaenoic acid (DHA, 20 : 5 n 3) that are known to compete with two of the most abundant fatty acids, arachidonic acid (ARA, 20 : 4 n 6) and docosahexaenoic acid (DPA, 22 : 5 n 3), respectively during fatty acid metabolism. High methionine and aspartic concentrations, amino acids essential to eukaryotic protein synthesis, were found to influence oocyte quality positively while no significant correlations were found between oocyte folate concentrations and oocyte quality. Before activation of zygotic transcription, maternal mRNAs control cell divisions and embryonic patterning. Due to the limited available genomic information on <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> maternal transcripts, an expressed sequence tag (EST) maternal library containing 2, 341 high quality ESTs was created by suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH). The maternal library constitutes an EST pool to identify suitable <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> reference genes and identify differentially expressed maternal genes in high and low quality <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> oocytes.

40|$|Ichthyobodosis is an {{important}} parasitic disease that has caused severe loss among ornamental and farmed fish world wide {{for more than a}} century. The disease is caused by heavy infections on skin and gills by parasitic flagellates belonging to the genus Ichthyobodo. In the past, infections worldwide have commonly been identified as due to a single variable species, I. necator. However, recent molecular studies have revealed that the genus Ichthyobodo consist of several different species and is far more complex than previously believed. The overall aim of this PhD project has been to identify and characterise Ichthyobodo species with emphasis on those that are known from Norwegian aquaculture. Therefore, effective and sensitive molecular methods (PCR techniques) for detection and identification of Ichthyobodo spp. have been developed and validated. With the aid of such methods several new Ichthyobodo genotypes have been detected from both farmed and wild fish. Working with molecularly identified Ichthyobodo genotypes has led to improved knowledge of character variations in the genus. Also, novel morphological characters have been identified, aiding species discrimination. Hence both molecular and morphological tools are provided that may facilitate the future description of other Ichthyobodo spp. Morphological descriptions of three Ichthyobodo species is presented, so far the only valid species within genus Ichthyobodo that have also been characterized through their DNA sequences. All presently valid Ichthyobodo species have been detected on both farmed and wild caught hosts in Norway: 1. Ichthyobodo necator; until recently the only species in the genus, is redescribed.

The three cDNAs consisted of 614, 595, and 666 nucleotides encoding peptides of 131, 146, and 124 amino acids, respectively. Halibut FSHbeta and LHbeta showed unique structural features among the vertebrate glycoprotein hormones. First, in contrast to all known FSHbeta, which contain either one or two conserved N-glycosylation sites, no potential binding site was found in <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> FSHbeta. Second, the conserved glycosylation site in the N-terminus of all vertebrate LHbeta has been substituted with a unique C-terminal binding site in <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> LHbeta. Furthermore, a specific cysteine residue of importance for the folding and heterodimerization of mammalian FSH is lacking in the FSHbeta from <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> as well as many other teleosts. However, teleost FSHbeta is characterized by an additional N-terminal cysteine, which has likely replaced the missing residue, implicating a modified folding pattern of this subunit. In situ hybridization of mature male pituitaries revealed that FSHbeta and LHbeta mRNA were expressed in distinct cell types throughout the proximal pars distalis of the adenohypophysis, while alpha-subunit mRNA was identified {{in all parts of the}} proximal pars distalis, and also along the periphery of pars intermedia.

40|$|During {{the life}} cycle as farmed animals there are {{numerous}} situations where fish are subjected to handling and confinement. Netting, weighing, sorting, vaccination, transport and, at the end, slaughter are common events under farming conditions. As research animals fish may also undergo surgical procedures, ranging from tagging, sampling, and small incisions, to larger operations. Under these varying situations treatment with anaesthetic agents might be {{necessary in order to}} ensure the welfare of the fish. Anaesthetic protocols for new species that are introduced to research or cultivation are generally based on protocols developed for the more established species. In Norway the anaesthetic protocols for Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> (Hippoglossus hippoglossus), which were introduced to fish farming in the 1980 ’s, have thus been based on protocols used for salmonid <b>species.</b> <b>Atlantic</b> salmon (Salmo salar) has been farmed since the 1960 ’s and is the most important species in Norwegian fish farming. The main objective of the current investigation was to gain more knowledge regarding the effect of anaesthetic agents in farmed fish, with special emphasis on Atlantic cod and <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut.</b> Large variations in response to anaesthetic agents exist both between and within fish species. Factors such as body weight, water temperature and acute stress may be important for the response and were studied in the current investigation. The anaesthetic agents benzocaine, metacaine (MS- 222), metomidate hydrochloride, isoeugenol, 2 - phenoxyethanol, and quinaldine were used. In Atlantic cod and <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> the agents were studied with regards to efficacy, assessed as induction and recovery times as well as reaction to handling under anaesthesia. In Atlantic salmon pharmacokinetic properties of the agents were examined. Both in Atlantic cod and <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> large differences in efficacy between the different anaesthetic treatments were found. Induction and recovery times varied both in relation to body weight and in relation to water temperature. The main trend observed in Atlantic cod at high water temperature was shorter induction and recovery times for all weight groups and treatments. Whereas in <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> higher water temperature resulted in shorter induction times, longer recovery times, and increased responsiveness to handling. <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> of large body size displayed longer induction times, shorter recovery times, and reduced responsiveness to handling in comparison with fish of smaller body size. However, in Atlantic cod no uniform trend was found in the relationship between the size of the fish and anaesthetic efficacy. In Atlantic cod induction and recovery times were found to increase with increasing body weight for benzocaine and MS- 222. For metomidate the recovery time increased with increasing weight whereas there were no weight related differences in induction time. No differences in either induction or recovery times associated to body weight were found for 2 -phenoxyethanol. The pharmacokinetic study in Atlantic salmon showed that the anaesthetics were rapidly eliminated and that elimination was related to the water soluble characteristics of the agents. The recovery times were shorter in fish that were given artificial gill ventilation. In the assessment of the importance of acute stress prior to anaesthesia of Atlantic cod {{it was found that the}} stress resulted in significantly shorter induction time and prolonged recovery time, as well as deeper anaesthetised fish. The anaesthetic dosage had to be reduced in order to avoid mortality in fish anaesthetised subsequent to acute stress. Anaesthetic protocols for fish have generally comprised one single agent, whereas protocols of human and veterinary medicine comprise combinations of several drugs, each one contributing with effects needed in the anaesthesia. Stress prior to anaesthesia may result in abnormal reactions, as seen in Atlantic cod in the current study, and may require dosage adjustments of drugs both for induction and maintenance. Pre-anaesthetic sedation is therefore commonly used in order to avoid stress and is an integrated part of the veterinary protocols. In the current study, protocols comprising combinations of two anaesthetic agents, one agent to induce sedation followed by one agent to induce anaesthesia, were tested in Atlantic cod and <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut.</b> In both <b>species</b> combination anaesthesia allowed a reduction of the dosages used for inducing anaesthesia. In Atlantic cod combination anaesthesia resulted in markedly reduced recovery times compared to agents administered individually. In <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> combination anaesthesia had no effect on the induction times in small fish in comparison with individual agents, but resulted in significantly shorter recovery times and reduced responsiveness to handling. In <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> of large body size combination anaesthesia gave rise to shorter induction times than individual administered agents whereas no uniform trend was observed in recovery times and no differences in responsiveness to handling were noticed. Anaesthetic agents are commonly used in fish farming to avoid stress during various farming practices. While several studies report that anaesthetic agents are effective in reducing the stress associated with confinement and handling, there are also reports indicating that the exposure to anaesthetics may in itself induce a stress response, measured by increased levels of cortisol. In order to examine stress induced by exposure to anaesthetic agents the release of cortisol to water following anaesthetic exposure was examined in <b>Atlantic</b> cod, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> and <b>Atlantic</b> salmon. In this examination the fish were not subjected to any concomitant handling in connection to anaesthesia or sampling. The plasma cortisol concentration during anaesthesia was examined in Atlantic salmon, however this examination included some degree of handling. All of the anaesthetics tested induced a release of cortisol to water in all three species, with maximum release rates measured 0. 5 - 1 hour post exposure. This also complied with the plasma cortisol levels measured in Atlantic salmon. MS- 222 elicited the highest cortisol release rates while benzocaine caused a bimodal response where the initial peak in cortisol release rate was followed by a second and smaller peak. Metomidate induced the lowest release of cortisol of the agents tested in both <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> and <b>Atlantic</b> cod, but resulted in a bimodal response in Atlantic salmon where the initial increase in cortisol release was followed by an even larger increase. The stress induced in Atlantic salmon by isoeugenol resembled that of MS- 222, but did not reach the same elevated level. Over all the cortisol release was most profound in Atlantic salmon followed by <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> and <b>Atlantic</b> cod. Based on the findings in the current study it is recommended that anaesthetic protocols should always be tested on a few fish under prevailing conditions in order to ensure an adequate level of depth while avoiding overdosing. This recommendation applies whether one single agent or a combination of agents are used although it was found here that protocols comprising combinations of agents provide wider margins of safety. While exposure to anaesthetic agents was found to elicit a stress response, displayed as increased levels of cortisol, the amount of cortisol released in response to anaesthesia was low compared to what is reported following strong stressors such as handling and confinement. Stress caused by anaesthetic agents may however represent an extra load during otherwise stressful circumstances...|$|R

40|$|The Atlantic Canadian {{aquaculture}} {{industry is}} dominated by Atlantic salmon production. In recent years, infectious disease, parasitic infestations, and price fluctuations from international competition have caused disruptions to the industry. Diversification of the industry away from Atlantic salmon production is a potential strategy to insulate the industry from these fish health and market challenges. <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> {{has long been a}} primary candidate for this diversification. However, the early commercialization of the species over the last 15 years has failed to reach its potential, owning primarily to a lack of information on the biology of the species, best management practices and proven economic feasibility. To address this information gap, a multi-objective Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) was conducted at a commercial farm on the Bay of Fundy in New Brunswick. The study collected detailed information on the growth and survival of 5000 <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> individually identified with Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags and followed over a four year grow-out period. The main objectives of this research were: (1) to evaluate the impact of individual fish characteristics on growth, survival and farm economics, (2) {{to determine the effects of}} oil-adjuvanted vaccines on growth performance, survival and vaccine associated lesions, (3) to evaluate the suitability of FT 4 Lock-on tags as an external tagging method for individual identification of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut,</b> and (4) to test a Stratified Transport System (STS) as a means of improving fish welfare and the economics of overland halibut transport. A variety of fish level characteristics were found to be important predictors of productivity. Identifying and culling fish with these specific characteristics prior to grow-out was identified as a method to improve overall farm productivity. The side-effects of oil-adjuvanted vaccines were found to be mild in <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut,</b> thereby identifying oil-adjuvants as an available tool for future vaccine development. FT 4 Lock-on tags were found to be suitable for identifying cage-cultured halibut with the exception of substantial impacts on growth. The STS was demonstrated to reduce post-transport mortality, establishing it as a cost-effective transport solution over currently practiced methods. In conclusion, this research allows producers to make evidence-based management decisions, to strengthen and facilitate the continued development of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> aquaculture sector in Atlantic Canada...|$|R
40|$|<b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) is {{the largest}} species of {{flatfish}} in the northwest Atlantic Ocean. It is a long-lived, late-maturing species distributed from Labrador to southern New England (Bigelow and Schroeder 1953). Within the Gulf of Maine-Georges Bank region (NAFO Divisions 5 Y and 5 Z, Figure M 1) halibut have been exploited since the early 1800 s, with major abundance declines noted {{as early as the}} 1870 s (Goode 1884, Grasso 2008). <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> was assessed in 2002 and 2005 using index-based methods (Brodziak 2002, Brodziak and Col 2005). Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) autumn weight per tow survey indices were expanded to swept-area biomass estimates (assuming a catchability coefficient of one), and the 5 -year average biomass index was compared to BMSY proxy reference points for status determination (Col and Legault 2009).

40|$|Abstract Background The {{commercial}} production of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> (Hippoglossus hippoglossus L.) {{suffers from a}} major bottleneck due to the low success of producing juveniles for on-growing. <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> females are routinely hand-stripped and incorrect timing of stripping can result in low quality eggs due to post-ovulatory aging. Post-ovulatory aging leads to compositional changes in eggs that include maternally provided proteins and RNAs. There have been few studies of the maternally provided mRNA transcripts that control early development in commercially important fish species. The present study aimed to study maternal gene expression in <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> {{and its relation to}} egg quality parameters including blastomere symmetry and hatching success. Results A maternal EST library containing 2341 sequences was constructed by suppressive subtractive hybridisation. Thirty genes were selected for expression studies; 23 novel genes and 7 genes with documented roles in early development. The expressions of twenty-one selected genes were measured by qPCR from fertilization to the 10 -somite stage. Three genes were identified as strictly maternal genes that were expressed until the start of gastrulation; askopos (kop), si:dkey- 30 j 22. 9 (Tudor family member), and Tudor 5 protein (Tdrd 5). The expressions of 18 genes at the 8 -cell stage were correlated with egg quality parameters. The majority of genes showed either no or very minor correlations with egg quality parameter. However, two genes correlated positively with hatching success (r > 0. 50, HHC 00353 : r = 0. 58, p r = 0. 56, p r = - 0. 62, p Conclusions During this study we have related maternal levels of gene expression to hatching success in fish. Poor hatching success was not correlated with a general decrease in transcript abundance but with low transcript levels of some specific genes. Thus, the molecular mechanisms leading to low <b>Atlantic</b> <b>halibut</b> egg quality cannot be entirely explained by post-ovulatory aging. </p...|$|R
