5000|$|The Polyphonic {{features}} of this synth are of particular interest as polyphony was rare in synthesizers of the time. The square wave based polyphony section {{is described as a}} [...] "cheesy organ sound" [...] by some, and well-used by others. Since the polyphony section is independently tunable, it can function as a rudimentary third oscillator, allowing the user to create more complex tones than on similar 2-oscillator synths. All of the sound-generating features come together in a mixer allowing the levels for the two monophonic tone sources, noise, bell tone and polyphony to be adjusted independently. The multiple notes of polyphony feed into the <b>single</b> <b>filter,</b> giving a paraphonic result. In 1982-3, few electronic musical instruments had the MG-1 combination of paraphonic poly section and monophonic synthesizer in one instrument.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} smoking a {{cigarette}} on bronchial responsiveness was studied in healthy non-smokers. Twenty two subjects performed a methacholine inhalation test before and after smoking a single cigarette. Ten of the subjects {{took part in a}} further study in which propranolol was inhaled before the smoking challenge to diminish the baseline beta adrenergic tone of the airway. After they had smoked a <b>single</b> <b>filtered</b> or non-filtered cigarette the indices of bronchial responsiveness (the cumulative dose of methacholine starting a decrease in the reciprocal of resistance, Grs (Dmin), and the cumulative dose causing a 35 % drop in the Grs (PD 35 Grs)) did not change significantly. With the inhalation of propranolol mean (SD) log Dmin decreased from 1. 37 (0. 44) units to 0. 74 (0. 57) (p less than 0. 01) and log PD 35 Grs from 1. 93 (0. 38) to 1. 51 (0. 38) (p less than 0. 01). Smoking a single cigarette after the inhalation of propranolol did not, however, cause any further change in bronchial responsiveness. This study suggests that smoking a <b>single</b> <b>filtered</b> or non-filtered cigarette does not change bronchial responsiveness in non-smokers, and that changes in beta adrenergic tone of the airway do not modify the effect of smoking a single cigarette on bronchial responsiveness...|$|R
40|$|Matched weight {{polyvinyl}} chloride (PVC) filters are currently {{available for use}} in total dust air sampling. This paper studies the utility of employing two superimposed filters in a cassette. Cassettes containing "paired" PVC filters were employed, {{in the same way}} matched weight filters would be used, during side by side sampling studies with cassettes housing <b>single</b> PVC <b>filters,</b> to determine whether the presence of two filters in a cassette presented problems during sampling. The effects of dust type, particle breakthrough, moisture concentration, and increased pressure drop from the addition of a second filter were studied. The presence of static electricity between filter pairs was also noted. Under recommended loading conditions "paired" filters seemed to perform as well as <b>single</b> <b>filters</b> in all aspects studied. Due to large filter weight variations found within individual batches of PVC filters, randomly selected filter pairs should not be used as actual matched weight filters...|$|R

50|$|K {{correction}} is {{a correction}} to an astronomical object's magnitude (or equivalently, its flux) {{that allows a}} measurement of a quantity of light from an object at a redshift z to be converted to an equivalent measurement in the rest frame of the object. If one could measure all the light from an object at all wavelengths (a bolometric flux), a K correction would not be required. If one measures the light emitted in an emission line, a K-correction is not required. The need for a K-correction arises because an astronomical measurement through a <b>single</b> <b>filter</b> or a single bandpass only sees {{a fraction of the}} total spectrum, redshifted into the frame of the observer. So if the observer wants to compare the measurements through a red filter of objects at different redshifts, the observer will have to apply estimates of the K corrections to these measurements to make a comparison.|$|E
5000|$|Mirroring {{the early}} {{sessions}} of creating their second album, Title of Record, Patrick started by {{working on the}} album entirely by himself without the assistance of prior band members Geno Lenardo and Frank Cavanaugh. By March 2003, Patrick had 5 songs written, {{and by the end}} of the year, he had 10 songs completed. Over the course of the same year, Patrick also worked briefly on a side-project called The Damning Well with Wes Borland, Danny Lohner, and Josh Freese. The group worked together on a number of tracks, but only one, [...] "Awakening", was ever released from the band. Patrick eventually felt like returning to collaborating in Filter again after this, although, rather than with the prior two albums, when he would re-recruit Lenardo and Cavanaugh, Patrick instead chose to collaborate with Robert DeLeo and Dean DeLeo of the band Stone Temple Pilots, upon hearing they were interested in working with Patrick. The three set out to record a <b>single</b> <b>Filter</b> song for the album, the track eventually titled [...] "A Better Place", however, by the end of their 12-hour jam session, the three felt so strongly about their musical chemistry that they felt they needed to create an entirely new band for the material.

40|$|Abstract. An {{analysis}} of the FIAC data is presented using spatial wavelet processing. This technique allows the image to be filtered adaptively {{according to the data}} itself, rather than relying on a predetermined filter. This adaptive filtering leads to better estimation of the parameters and contrasts in terms of mean squared error. It will be shown that by introducing a slight bias into the estimation, a large reduction in the variance can be achieved, leading to better overall mean squared error estimates. As no <b>single</b> <b>filter</b> needs to be preselected, results containing many scales of information can be found. In the FIAC data it will be shown that both small scale and large scale (smoother, more dispersed) effects occur.
