500|$|Manson {{recorded}} his vocals at his Hollywood Hills home studio between November 2008 and his January 5, 2009 birthday. He described the album as containing [...] "extreme" [...] autobiographical content {{relating to the}} dissolution of both his marriage to burlesque artist Dita Von Teese, and his later relationship with then-19-year old actress Evan Rachel Wood, explaining: [...] "Some of the things I say here, it's sad to say them—they're relationship-destroying statements. Some of it is stuff I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> to my ex-wife. Some are things I've never said to the world." [...] Manson used his home as a canvas to document the disintegration {{of his relationship with}} Wood, writing the album's lyrics on walls and coupling them with paintings and drawings, as well as used condoms, bags of cocaine and other drug paraphernalia. Much of the album's artwork was shot there.|$|E
500|$|Lillywhite {{believed}} that the African influences had not translated well onto the album, remarking: [...] "It's a pity because {{the whole idea of}} Morocco as a big idea was great. When the big idea for U2 is good, that is when they succeed the most, but I don't think the spirit of what they set out to achieve was translated. Something happened that meant it did not come across on the record." [...] The Edge concurred, admitting that the group erred by [...] "starting out experimental and then trying to bring it into something that was more accessible". He added, [...] "I think probably we <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> 'It's an experimental work. That's what it is.'" [...] Mullen refers to the album as [...] "No Craic on the Horizon" [...] and said, [...] "It was pretty fucking miserable. It turns out that we're not as good as we thought we were and things got in the way." ...|$|E

500|$|On January 31, 2007, Biden {{took his}} first steps into the presidential campaign, but his {{comments}} about other candidates overshadowed his entrance. Biden especially drew criticism in the popular press for his evaluation of Senator Barack Obama; Biden {{was quoted in the}} New York Observer as saying: [...] "I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy, ... I mean, that's a storybook, man." [...] The audio of the interview, posted on the Observers website, reportedly includes a significant pause after [...] "African-American" [...] which would drastically change the meaning of the statement. Biden sought to clear up the controversy by apologizing to Obama on the same day and repeated his regret on The Daily Show that same evening: [...] "Look, the other part of this thing that got me in trouble is using the word clean. I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> fresh." [...] Some media observers labeled Biden's announcement a [...] "launch pad disaster." [...] Jesse Jackson telephoned Biden and reported afterward [...] "Senator Biden...assured me that he regrets that his remarks were misinterpreted. He was serious and contrite. To me, this was a gaffe, not a statement about his philosophy or ideology." ...|$|E

Wolf argues that the alleged victims <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> no, that they consented to having sex with Assange, that the charges are politically motivated and demean the cause of legitimate rape victims. The discussion took place shortly after the leaking of the Swedish police report on the incident.|$|E

2500|$|Hirsi Ali criticises {{the central}} Islamic prophet on {{morality}} and personality traits (criticisms based on biographical details or depictions by Islamic texts and early followers of Muhammad).

She later said: [...] "Perhaps I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> 'a pedophile'". Muslims filed a religious discrimination suit against her that year.

2500|$|Harrison {{began writing}} the song [...] "See Yourself" [...] in 1967 in {{response}} to the furore surrounding McCartney's admission. In his autobiography, I Me Mine, Harrison introduces the opening verse, which begins [...] "It's easier to tell a lie than it is to tell the truth", with the comment [...] "There was a big outcry with people saying [...] 'You <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> [...] "No!"' ..." [...] Author Ian Inglis suggests that this opening lyric reveals Harrison's [...] "mixed emotions over the wisdom of total honesty". Inglis adds that [...] "while the dilemma about whether to reveal or conceal the truth to others is insuperable, {{the important thing is to}} be true to oneself", as reflected in the song title.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the heyday}} of the civil rights movement, {{defenders}} of segregation used the term [...] "states' rights" [...] as a code word—in what is now referred to as dog-whistle politics—political messaging that appears to mean one thing to the general population but has an additional, different or more specific resonance for a targeted subgroup. In 1948 it was the official name of the [...] "Dixiecrat" [...] party led by white supremacist presidential candidate Strom Thurmond. Democratic governor George Wallace of Alabama, who famously declared in his inaugural address in 1963, [...] "Segregation now! Segregation tomorrow! Segregation forever!"—later remarked that he <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "States' rights now! States' rights tomorrow! States' rights forever!" [...] Wallace, however, claimed that segregation was but one issue symbolic of a larger struggle for states' rights; in that view, which some historians dispute, his replacement of segregation with states' rights would be more of a clarification than a euphemism.|$|E
2500|$|Confusion {{has arisen}} {{as to the}} precise source of Carr's three world wars scenario. As {{is the case with}} many of his claims, Carr does not provide a source for that scenario, but {{mentions}} a letter written by Pike and addressed to Italian revolutionary leader Giuseppe Mazzini, which outlines a plan for unleashing [...] "Nihilists and Atheists", after World War Three has ended. The confusion increased when Michael Haupt launched his website threeworldwars.com, which mistakenly assumed that Carr also attributed the World War Three scenario to the Pike letter. In fact, the authenticity of this letter is disputed. [...] Carr states that he learned about the letter from the anti-Mason, Cardinal José María Caro Rodríguez of Santiago, Chile, author of The Mystery of Freemasonry Unveiled (Hawthorne, California, Christian Book Club of America, 1971). However, Carr's later book, Satan, Prince of This World (written in 1959), includes the following footnote: [...] "The Keeper of manuscripts recently informed the author that this letter is NOT cataloged in the British Museum Library. It seems strange that a man of Cardinal Rodriguez's knowledge <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that it WAS in 1925." [...] More recently, the British Museum confirmed in writing to researcher Michael Haupt that such a document has never been in their possession. Pierre-André Taguieff states that Carr gave an ultimate and synthetic account of this [...] "legend" [...] that links together the Illuminati, Mazzini and Pike in a satanic plot for world domination.|$|E

2500|$|Hagel faced sharp {{questioning}} from Republicans. Senator John McCain berated him {{for refusing}} to give {{a yes or no}} {{answer to the question of}} whether the Iraq War troop surge of 2007 was a success. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina demanded he [...] "name one dumb thing we've been goaded into doing because of the pressure from the Israeli or Jewish lobby." [...] Hagel stated [...] "I've already said I regret referencing the Jewish lobby, I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> 'pro-Israel lobby. ... The use of 'intimidation'—I should have used 'influence.' I think that would have been more appropriate. I should not have said 'dumb' or 'stupid,' because I understand or appreciate there are other views on these things.". Senator Ted Cruz played video excerpts from a 2009 Al Jazeera interview, and asserted that Hagel had agreed with a caller who suggested that Israel had committed war crimes. Hagel denied he agreed with that view. After the hearing, Senator Cruz organized a letter from 25 Republican Senators saying they would not vote until Hagel gave them copies of speeches given to organizations and told them the amount he was paid and whether the organizations received money from foreign sources. Lindsey Graham said they wanted to know if he spoke for any [...] "anti-Israel" [...] groups. Senate Committee chair Carl Levin said the demands were unprecedented, asking [...] "for information no prior nominee has been asked for," [...] and expressed confidence Hagel would be approved by the Senate.|$|E

[...] Rav Nahman warned that {{one who is}} as skilled in refuting heretics as Rav Idit should do so, but others should not.

[...] Rav Idit replied {{that it was the}} angel Metatron who said that, and that Metatron's name {{is similar to that of}} his Master (and indeed the gematria (numerical value of the Hebrew letters) of Metatron (...) equals that of Shadai (...) , God's name in [...] and elsewhere) for [...] says, [...] "for my name is in him." [...] But if so, the heretic retorted, we should worship Metatron. Rav Idit replied that [...] also says, [...] "Be not rebellious against him," [...] by which God meant, [...] "Do not {{exchange}} Me for him" [...] (as the word for [...] "rebel," [...] ( [...] , tameir) derives from the same root as the word [...] "exchange"). The heretic then asked why then [...] says, [...] "he will not pardon your transgression." [...] Rav Idit answered that indeed Metatron has no authority to forgive sins, and the Israelites would not accept him even as a messenger, for [...] reports that Moses told God, [...] "If Your Presence does not go with me, do not carry us up from here." ...|$|E
2500|$|John Taylor Coleridge {{continues}} {{by explaining}} the {{negative aspects of}} such a concept: [...] "Though the tenderness and beauty resulting from this opinion be to us a rich overpayment for the occasional strainings and refinements of sentiment to which it has given birth, it has yet often served to make the author ridiculous in common eyes, in that it has led him to state his own fairy dreams as the true interpretation and import of the looks and movements of children, as being even really in their minds." [...] In a February 1821 review for the British Critic, John Taylor Coleridge attacked the poem again for a heretical view found {{in the notion of}} pre-existence and how it reappeared in Wordsworth's poem [...] "On an Extraordinary Evening of Splendour and Beauty". However, he does claim that the passage of the ode containing the idea is [...] "a passage of exquisite poetry" [...] and that [...] "A more poetical theory of human nature cannot well be devised, and if the subject were one, upon which error was safe, we should forbear to examine it closely, and yield to the delight we have often received from it in the ode from which the last extract [...] is made." [...] He was to continue: [...] "If, therefore, we had met the doctrine in any poet but Mr. Wordsworth, we <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> nothing; but we believe him to be one not willing to promulgate error, even in poetry, indeed it is manifest that he makes his poetry subservient to his philosophy; and this particular notion is so mixed up by him with others, in which it is impossible to suppose him otherwise than serious; that we are constrained to take it for his real and sober belief." ...|$|E
