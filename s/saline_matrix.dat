40|$|The {{analysis}} of ultra trace elements in sea water samples {{is one of}} the most difficult analytical tasks in the field of environmental monitoring, as extremely low detection limits for elements buried in a highly <b>saline</b> <b>matrix</b> is required.

Sample dilution is always a way out at the expense of inadequate sensitivity after such dilution especially for open ocean sea water. In order to approach this complex analytical task by ICP-MS there are two common strategies studied so far: first the use of pre-concentration technique and matrix removal and second the use of double focussing ICP-MS instruments.

40|$|A new ion chromatographic {{method that}} is {{applicable}} to the direct determination of UV-absorbing inorganic anions in <b>saline</b> <b>matrixes</b> is described. An octadecylsilica column modified with a zwitterionic surfactant (3 -(N,N-dimethylmyristylammonio) propanesulfonate) is used as the stationary phase, and an electrolytic solution is used as the eluent. Under these conditions, the matrix species (such as chloride and sulfate) are only retained weakly and show little or no interference. It is proposed that a binary electrical double layer (EDL) is established by retention of the eluent cations on the negatively charged (sulfonate) functional groups of the zwitterionic surfactant (forming a cation-EDL) and by retention of eluent anions on the positively charged (quaternary ammonium) functional groups of the zwitterionic surfactant (forming an anion-EDL). Sample anions are able to distribute into the cation-EDL and to form ion pairs with the EDL cations, {{while at the same}} time experiencing repulsion from the anion-EDL. Anions are therefore eluted in order of increased propensity to form ion pairs. The method has been applied to the determination of bromide, nitrate, and iodide in artificial seawater, giving detection limits of 0. 75 ppb for bromide, 0. 52 ppb for nitrate, and 0. 8 ppb for iodide using UV absorbance detection at 210 nm and relative standard deviations of < 1. 2 %.

Parameters such as the pH effect on the nickel extraction, the effect of flow rate and sample volume on the extraction, the sorption capacity of the loaded resin, the nickel desorption from the resin and the analytical characteristics of the procedure were studied. The results demonstrate that nickel(II) ions, in the concentration range 0. 10 – 275 μg l− 1, and pH 6. 0 – 11. 5, contained in a sample volume of 25 – 250 ml, can be extracted by using 1 g Amberlite XAD- 2 resin loaded with PAN reagent.

40|$|Vertisols are {{cracking}} clayey soils that (i) usually form in alluvial lowlands where, normally, groundwater pools into aquifers; (ii) {{have different}} types of voids (due to cracking), which make flow and transport of water, solutes and gas complex; and (iii) are regarded as fertile soils in many areas. The combination of these characteristics results in the unique soil–aquifer phenomena that are highlighted and summarized in this review. The review is divided into the following four sections: (1) soil cracks as preferential pathways for water and contaminants: in this section lysimeter-to basin-scale observations that show the significance of cracks as preferential-flow paths in vertisols, which bypass matrix blocks in the unsaturated zone, are summarized. Relatively fresh-water recharge and groundwater contamination from these fluxes and their modeling are reviewed; (2) soil cracks as deep evaporators and unsaturated-zone salinity: deep sediment samples under uncultivated vertisols in semiarid regions reveal a dry (immobile), <b>saline</b> <b>matrix,</b> partly due to enhanced evaporation through soil cracks. Observations of this phenomenon are compiled in this section and the mechanism of evapoconcentration due to air flow in the cracks is discussed; (3) impact of cultivation on flushing of the unsaturated zone and aquifer salinization: the third section examines studies reporting that land-use change of vertisols from native land to cropland promotes greater fluxes through the saline unsaturated-zone matrix, eventually flushing salts to the aquifer. Different degrees of salt flushing are assessed as well as aquifer salinization on different scales, and a comparison is made with aquifers under other soils; (4) relatively little nitrate contamination in aquifers under vertisols: in this section we turn the light on observations showing that aquifers under cultivated vertisols are somewhat resistant to groundwater contamination by nitrate (the major agriculturally related groundwater problem). Denitrification is probably the main mechanism supporting this resistance, whereas {{a certain degree of}} anion-exchange capacity may have a retarding effect as well...|$|E

40|$|RATIONALE: Dissolved {{organic carbon}} (DOC) plays an {{important}} role in carbon cycling, making precise and routine measurement of delta C- 13 values and DOC concentration highly desirable. A new promising system has been developed for this purpose. However, broad-scale application of this new technique requires an in-depth assessment of analytical performance, and this is described here. METHODS: A high-temperature combustion Total Organic Carbon analyzer was interfaced with continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry (TOC/IRMS) for the simultaneous analysis of the bulk DOC concentration and delta C- 13 signature. The analytical performance (precision, memory effects, linearity, volume/concentration effects, accuracy) was thoroughly evaluated, including realistic and challenging conditions such as low DOC concentrations and natural DOC. RESULTS: High precision (standard deviation, SD predominantly ≤ 0. 15 ‰) and accuracy (R 2 [*]=[*] 0. 9997) were achieved for the δ 13 C analysis of a broad diversity of DOC solutions. Simultaneously, good results were obtained for the measurement of DOC concentration. Assessment of natural abundance and slightly  13 C-enriched DOC, a wide range of concentrations (~ 0. 2 – 150 mgC/L) and injection volumes (0. 05 – 3  mL), demonstrated minor/negligible memory effects, good linearity and flexible usage. Finally, TOC/IRMS was successfully applied to determine low DOC concentrations (< 2 mgC/L) and DOC from diverse terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments (SD ≤ 0. 23 ‰). CONCLUSIONS: TOC/IRMS enables fast and reliable measurement of DOC concentrations and delta C- 13 values in aqueous samples, without pre-concentration and freeze-drying. Further investigations should focus on complex, <b>saline</b> <b>matrices</b> and very low DOC concentrations, to achieve a potential lower limit of 0. 2 mgC/L. Thus, TOC/IRMS will give DOC research in terrestrial and aquatic environments a huge impulse with high-resolution, routine delta C- 13 analysis. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{speciation}} of selenium in urine {{stands as}} a challenge to analytical chemists for two main reasons: the low physiological concentration of selenium in urine and the lack of commercially available Se-spccies standards for comparisons. Therefore, techniques giving direct access to structural information of the selenocompounds formed must be used to identify the chemical nature of urine Se species and sample preparation is critical for that purpose. Two sample preparation procedures to analyse selenocompounds in urine by electrospray-MS/MS have been developed here. The proposed sample treatments allow the purification of selenocompounds and consist of removal of the <b>saline</b> interfering <b>matrix</b> by different approaches followed by preparative size exclusion chromatography and final reversed-phase HPLC separation. Preconcentration of selenocompounds was achieved by several freeze-drying steps. One of the developed procedures was successfully tested in human urine spiked with selenocompounds but it was found to be unsuitable for basal samples.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Assay-vendor {{independent}} {{quality control}} (QC) samples for neurochemical dementia diagnostics (NDD) biomarkers {{are so far}} commercially unavailable. This requires that NDD laboratories prepare their own QC samples, for example by pooling leftover cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. OBJECTIVE: To prepare and test alternative matrices for QC samples that could facilitate intra- and inter-laboratory QC of the NDD biomarkers. METHODS: Three matrices were validated in this study: (A) human pooled CSF, (B) Abeta peptides spiked into human prediluted plasma, and (C) Abeta peptides spiked into solution of bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered <b>saline.</b> All <b>matrices</b> were tested also after supplementation with an antibacterial agent (sodium azide). We analyzed short- and long-term stability of the biomarkers with ELISA and chemiluminescence (Fujirebio Europe, MSD, IBL International), and performed an inter-laboratory variability study. RESULTS: NDD biomarkers {{turned out to be}} stable in almost all samples stored at the tested conditions for up to 14 days as well as in samples stored deep-frozen (at - 80 degrees C) for up to one year. Sodium azide did not influence biomarker stability. Inter-center variability of the samples sent at room temperature (pooled CSF, freeze-dried CSF, and four artificial matrices) was comparable to the results obtained on deep-frozen samples in other large-scale projects. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest {{that it is possible to}} replace self-made, CSF-based QC samples with large-scale volumes of QC materials prepared with artificial peptides and matrices. This would greatly facilitate intra- and inter-laboratory QC schedules for NDD measurements...|$|R
40|$|The {{molecular}} level characterisation of compounds comprising the dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) pool {{is an important}} task for chemical oceanographers wishing to understand {{its role in the}} marine N cycle. Low DON concentrations, problems with <b>saline</b> <b>matrices</b> and a lack of pre-concentration methods have all contributed to DON being ignored and disregarded, until recently. Sub units of DON have been analysed as bulk parameters within which the low molecular weight (LMW; < 1, 500 Da) fraction has been proposed to drive regenerated production within the oceans. The largest producers of these compounds are phytoplankton. Dissolved combined amino acids (DCAAs) are proposed to be the largest identifiable component of the LMW fraction. Peptides were chosen as the starting point for this study on DON characterisation, due to their unrivalled detection when analysed via liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry (LC/MS). A method was developed for the characterisation of low molecular weight peptides, released either actively or passively from the axenically-cultured phytoplankton Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Methods for the separation (high performance liquid chromatography; HPLC), detection (mass spectrometric; MS), de-salination and pre-concentration (solid phase extraction; SPE), of analytes present in the culture water sampled during the period of maximum DON, were developed. The successful chromatographic separation of LMW peptides was achieved using a Phenomenex® Gemini Gig column in conjunction with mobile phases of acidified MeOH and water. The SPE method was developed on a Hamilton PRP- 1 column containing a polystyrene divinylbenzene stationary phase (PSDVB). During the extraction process the increased hydrophobicity of the PS-DVB phase was predicted to yield increased recoveries of peptides, when compared to analogous d g phase cartridges. The method was transferred to extraction cartridges (500 mg, StrataX). Further investigations were then carried out into the affects of salt and dissolved organic matter on the extraction process. Samples were prepared by applying the extraction method to 1 L supernatants of culture water samples. The HPLC protocol was used to separate the components of the complex sample prior to data acquisition in both full MS mode and in the data dependent mode (DDMS). Mass spectra and chromatograms of ions unique to the cultured waters were identified. Further instrument manipulation allowed interfering ions to be diverted away from the mass analyser and consequently multistage mass spectrometry (MS²) to be carried out on unique ions that exceeded the threshold intensity of 1 x 105. Unique ions identified in the axenic cultures were two amino acids TYR and a modified structure isomerically/isobarically related to TYR. Seven peptides were partially sequenced. These were H-(VAL, THR, Xxx) -OH, H-(GLN/LYS, ALA, ASN, Xxx) -OH, H-(ASN, ALA, GLU, Xxx) -OH, H-(VAL, GLU, Xxx) -OH, H-(SER, HIS, Xxx) -OH, H- (PRO, XLE,HIS, GLN/LYS, GLY, Xxx) -OH and H-(Xxx, XLE, GLN/LYS, XLE, GLU) - OH. One whole peptide was tentatively proposed as H-TRP-PHE-OH. A significant loss of data was observed between the unique peptide ions identified in the MS analysis and the ions that underwent CID during the DDMS analysis, because they were below the threshold ion count or co-eluted with a more dominant ion. The method development carried out through this study has enabled the successful analysis of samples previously considered incompatible with LC/MS instrumentation. The method can be applied to all aquatic environment samples for both contaminant removal and preconcentration requirements and can be seen as an initial step from which many different avenues of future work may be explored.

However, existing methods for DON characterization exclude this fraction through size exclusion or destruction during sample hydrolysis. In this study, we developed a method for the extraction and analysis of LMW peptides in saline waters. The procedure involves a solid phase extraction (SPE) preconcentration step using a polystyrene-divinylbenzene sorbent, then elution and detection by liquid chromatographyelectrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC/ESI/MS). The procedure was tested with 1 -L water samples containing peptides (10 ng L– 1) ranging from 188. 2 - 1946. 0 Da. The analytes were characterized using “top-down” sequencing to confirm their structure, and the method was then successfully applied to saline water samples extracted from a mono-algal culture of Phaeodactylum tricornutum. This enabled a number of unknown analytes to be partially sequenced (complete sequencing should be possible using additional MSn scans and larger sample volumes). The method allows {{for the detection of}} peptides at the ng L– 1 level and further preconcentration is possible.

40|$|AbstractCurrently, around 50 % of the world's {{population}} lives in {{towns and cities}} within 100  km of the coast. Monitoring of viruses that are frequently present in contaminated coastal environments, such as rotavirus (RoV) and norovirus (NoV), which are also the major cause of human viral gastroenteritis, is essential to ensure the safe use of these water bodies. Since exposure to as few as 10 – 100 particles of RoV or NoV may induce gastrointestinal disease, {{there is a need}} to develop a rapid and sensitive diagnostic method for their detection in coastal water samples. In this study, we evaluate the application of methacrylate monolithic chromatographic columns, commercially available as convective interaction media (CIM®), to concentrate pathogenic enteric viruses from saline water samples prior to virus quantification by one-step reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Using RoV and NoV as model enteric viruses, we present our results on the most effective viral concentration conditions from <b>saline</b> water <b>matrices</b> using butyl (C 4) hydrophobic interaction monolithic support (CIM® C 4). C 4 monolithic columns exhibit a good capacity to bind both RoV and NoV and both viruses can be eluted in a single step. Our protocol using a 1  ml C 4 column enables processing of 400  ml saline water samples in less than 60  min and increases the sensitivity of RoV and NoV detection by approximately 50 -fold and 10 -fold respectively. The protocol was also scaled up using larger capacity 8  ml C 4 columns to process 4000  ml of seawater samples with concentration factors of 300 -fold for RoV and 40 -fold for NoV, without any significant increase in processing time. Furthermore, C 4 monolithic columns were adapted for field use in an on-site application of RoV concentration from seawater samples with performance equivalent to that of the reference laboratory setup. Overall, the results from successful deployment of CIM C 4 columns for concentration of rotavirus and norovirus in seawater samples reiterate the utility of monolithic supports as efficient, scalable and modular preparative tools for processing environmental water samples to enhance viral detection using molecular methods...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} images (MRI) of {{brachial plexus}} anatomy bilaterally, not possible by plain radiographs or CT, {{were presented to}} the Vascular Surgery, Neurology, and the Neurosurgery departments. Patients were requested for MRI of their brachial plexus. They were referred for imaging and the imaging results were presented to the faculty and housestaff. Our technique was accepted and adopted to begin referrals for MRI evalua-tion of brachial plexopathy. Over 175 patients have been studied. Eighty-five patients were imaged with the 1. 5 Tesla magnet (Signa; General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI) 3 -D reconstruction MRI. Coronal, transverse (axial), oblique trans-verse, and sagittal plane T 1 -weighted and selected TZweighted pulse sequences were obtained at 4 - 5 mm slice thickness, 40 - 45 full field of view, and a 512 x 256 size <b>matrix.</b> <b>Saline</b> water bags were used to enhance the signal between the neck and the thorax. Sites of brachial plexus compromise were demonstrated. Our technique with 3 -D reconstruc-tion increased the definition of brachial plexus pathology. The increased anatomical definition enabled the vascular surgeons and neurosurgeons to improve patient care. Brachial plexus in vivo anatomy as displayed by MRI, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and 3 -D reconstruction offered an opportunity to augment the teaching of clinical anatomy to medical students and health professionals. Selected case presentations (body-builder, anomalous muscle, fractured clavicle, thyroid goiter, silicone breast implant rupture, and cervical rib) demonstrated compromise of the brachial plexus displayed by MRI. T h e MRI and 3 -D reconstruction techniques, demonstrating the bilateral landmark anatomy, increased {{the definition of the}} clinical anatomy and resulted in greater knowl-edge of patient care management...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} and analyzes {{the data of}} the Italian system for take-back and recovery of waste electrical and electronic equipments (WEEEs) in the start-up period 2008 – 2010. The analysis was focused particularly on the data about the treatment of end-of-life cooling and freezing equipments. In fact, the wastes of cooling and freezing equipments have a high environmental impact. Indeed, in their compressor oil and insulation polyurethane (PU) foams chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) ozone-depleting gases are still present. In the period 2001 – 2004 Northern Italy resulted the main source in Europe of CFCs. The European Directive on WEEE management was enacted in 2002, but in Italy it was implemented by the legislative Decree in 2005 and it became operational in 2008. Actually, in 2008 the national WEEE Coordination Centre was founded in order to organize the WEEE pick-up process and to control collection, recovery and recycling targets. As a result, in 2010 the average WEEE collection per capita exceeded the threshold of more than 4 kg per inhabitant, as well as cooling and freezing appliances represented more than one fourth of the Italian WEEE collection stream. During the treatment of end-of-life cooling and freezing equipments, CFCs were recovered and disposed principally by burner methods. The analyses of defined specimens collected in the treatment facilities were standardized to reliably {{determine the amount of}} recovered CFCs. Samples of alkaline solid salt, alkaline <b>saline</b> solution, polyurethane <b>matrix</b> and compressor oil collected during the audit assessment procedure were analyzed and the results were discussed. In particular, the analysis of PU samples after the shredding and the warm pressing procedures measured a residual CFCs content around 500 – 1300 mg/kg of CFCs within the foam matrix...|$|R
