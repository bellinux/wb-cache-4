Fresnel and prism optics moulded into the headlamp lens refract (shift) parts of the light laterally and vertically to provide the required light distribution pattern. Most <b>sealed-beam</b> headlamps have lens optics.|$|E
25|$|Southern Pacific road {{switcher}} diesels often had elaborate lighting clusters front and rear, {{with a large}} red Mars Light for emergency signaling, and often two pairs of <b>sealed-beam</b> headlamps, {{one on top of}} the cab and the other below the Mars Light on the nose. Starting in the 1970s SP had cab air conditioning on all new locomotives and the unit is visible on the cab roof. Southern Pacific placed large snowplows on the pilots of their {{road switcher}}s for the heavy snowfall on Donner Pass. Many Southern Pacific road switchers had a Nathan-AirChime model P3 or P5 air horn with chords distinct to Southern Pacific locomotives in the western states.|$|E
25|$|The LC10 was {{introduced}} with great fanfare {{and a large}} marketing campaign, which included television commercials. First reaching dealerships on 27 May 1967, market response was immediate and strong. While the original target production was 3000 per month, this was soon nearly tripled. Monthly production remained above 8000 {{until the end of}} the LC10's life. A new, additional factory in Iwata was opened in August 1967 to add supplementary capacity. While in overall a fairly simple and light car, the triple carburettors were awkwardly located at the front of the engine, behind the rear seat. To adjust them, a mechanic would have to reach through a small egg-shaped opening from the rear seat. Another complaint touched on the car's near absence of luggage space. The rear lights and the front indicators used the same lenses, only of different colors. There was even a brochure made of a US-market Fronte 360, complete with miles-per-hour speedo and uncovered <b>sealed-beam</b> headlights, but most likely none were brought over. The Fronte soon received a very minor update reflecting stricter safety laws; as of October 1968 it sported a driver's side integrated headrest, seat belts up front, and turn signal flashers on all four corners.|$|E
2500|$|... 1992: All {{three models}} of the Storm {{received}} a new headlight cluster (with narrow <b>sealed-beam</b> halogen headlamps also seen in that year's Pontiac Grand Prix GTP), tail lights, and front clip. Base models received a new rear bumper treatment. Instrument panel and gauge graphics were also slightly revised. The GSi version received a new spoiler and a larger DOHC engine which offered 10 extrahp.|$|E
2500|$|These {{revolving}} lights {{may contain}} a single, stationary bulb around which a curved mirror is spun (or which {{is attached to}} a spinning mirror), or a lamp with a Fresnel lens. [...] This creates rotating beam(s) of light, appearing to flash when viewed. [...] Larger rotating lights may contain modular or <b>sealed-beam</b> lamps which rotate as an assembly (commonly 2 or 4 bulbs, but possibly 1 or 3).|$|E
2500|$|When Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108 was amended in 1974 {{to permit}} {{rectangular}} sealed-bea headlamps, these {{were placed in}} horizontally arrayed or vertically stacked pairs. By 1979, the majority of new cars in the US market were equipped with rectangular lamps. As previously with round lamps, the US permitted only two standardized sizes of rectangular <b>sealed-beam</b> lamp: A system of two [...] high/low beam units corresponding to the existing 7-inch round format, or a system of four [...] units, two high/low and two high-beam. corresponding to the existing [...] round format.|$|E
2500|$|UPS {{refers to}} its {{delivery}} van as a [...] "package car". [...] The company utilizes several designs and sizes of package cars, dependent on routes and package volume. [...] The rounded-nose design of fiberglass {{hood of the}} UPS package car was patented by the company in 1965. [...] Morgan Olson (Grumman Olson), Union City Body, and Utilimaster manufacture the bodies for UPS delivery vans; older vehicles are based on Ford or General Motors P-chassis, while package cars introduced since the 1990s are based on Freightliner, Navistar, or Workhorse chassis. [...] Originally, UPS delivery vehicles were equipped with manual transmissions and steering, although many newer vehicles are updated with automatic transmissions. [...] In a 2010s redesign of the hood, the rounded-nose design has been phased out; its <b>sealed-beam</b> headlights have been replaced with automotive-sourced composite headlight units faired into the hood.|$|E

It {{started out with}} [...] It added balance shafts to become the famous [...] "3800" [...] V6 for 1988, with [...] This engine {{increased}} to [...] in 1991 {{with the addition of}} Tuned Port Injection. The 1986 model, however, featured the 3.0 liter (181 cubic-inch) V6 as standard. Each year yielded slightly different design changes. 1986 is notable for its <b>sealed-beam</b> headlights, 1987 for the substition of more modern headlights with exchangeable bulbs as well as the introduction of door-mounted seat-belts. In 1988 the 3.8 engine was changed over to the 3800 (vin code C) motor, while 1989 saw slight changes in the layout of the engine bay accessories (notably the position of the battery, washer fluid tank, and coolant overflow tank). For 1990 there was a change {{in the design of the}} front bumper/grille assembly and different tail light design, while the 1991s were more or less identical to the 1990 model cars aside from a small power increase.|$|E

50|$|In 1968, the W114/W115 was {{introduced}} in North America (as the 240D and 300D), but with fewer engine choices than elsewhere. These models from the start had unique headlights, utilizing a <b>sealed-beam</b> lamp instead of the H4 type used in the European models. Bumpers changed frequently and {{there were at least}} three different bumpers used over the production run in NA. For 1974, the bumpers grew significantly due to new DOT requirements.|$|E
50|$|The {{suspension}} {{was usually}} altered. Initially this involved lowering {{the rear end}} {{as much as possible}} with the use of lowering blocks on the rear springs. Later cars were given a rake job either adding a dropped front axle or heating front coil springs to make {{the front end of the}} car much lower than the rear. Immediately postwar, most rods would change from mechanical to hydraulic ("juice") brakes and from bulb to <b>sealed-beam</b> headlights.|$|E

While the Cervo used rectangular headlights, the Mighty Boy, as befitting the cheapest automobile available in Japan, used cheaper round <b>sealed-beam</b> units. A feature unique to the Mighty Boy were the seats, which although still similar to those featured in the Cervo CS/G, featured a customised embossed [...] "Mighty Boy" [...] logo.|$|E
5000|$|The basic {{architecture}} of the Silver Cloud II did not change between 1959 and 1963, but there were numerous minor changes implemented, notable among them a succession of improvements to the ventilation system.

5000|$|As buyer tastes {{began to}} change in the late 1930s, certain body styles were pruned from the lineup. 1939 would be the last year for the 4-door phaeton and for single-seat coupes and {{convertibles}} (and their rumble seats). A conventional [...] "alligator" [...] hood replaced the [...] "butterfly" [...] hood with its lifting side panels. Ford also made several safety-related changes as well. The dashboard was redesigned (to feature recessed controls) in 1938, hydraulic brakes were added in 1939, and <b>sealed-beam</b> headlights were introduced a year later.|$|E
5000|$|Rectangular {{headlamps}} were {{promoted in}} the United States where round lamps were required until 1975. By 1979, {{the majority of}} new cars now had the rectangular headlamps.
