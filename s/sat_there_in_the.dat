Now there was a suite of rooms in the Palace, below the ground level, secure and a veritable labyrinth, so {{that it seemed to}} resemble Tartarus, where she usually kept in confinement those who had given offence. So Bouzes was hurled into this pit, and in that place he, a man sprung from a line of consuls, remained, forever unaware of time. For as he <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> darkness, he could [...] distinguish whether it was day or night, nor could he communicate with any other person. For the man who threw him his food for each day met him in silence, one as dumb as the other, as one beast meets another. And straightway it was supposed by all that he had died, but no one dared mention or recall him. But two years and four months later she was moved to pity and released the man, and he was seen by all as one who had returned from the dead. But thereafter he always suffered from weak sight and his whole body was sickly." ...|$|E
60|$|For a {{long time}} he <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark, the moon through the {{skylight}} above laying a pale smear which lengthened slowly towards him down the stairway. He tried to be philosophical.|$|E
60|$|In his inflamed, overwrought exasperation, {{he stopped}} the car, and they <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{middle of the country}} lane, to have it out. It was a crisis of war between them, so they did not see the ridiculousness of their situation.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Navy {{took her}} into service as HMS Arrogante. She arrived at Plymouth in April 1798 and she <b>sat</b> <b>there.</b> <b>In</b> August, <b>the</b> Navy renamed her HMS Insolent, {{but did not}} refit her until February to April 1801. On 24 April Lieutenant Burians, a veteran officer, {{commissioned}} her.|$|R
60|$|At first Bremner {{watched the}} rising tide, {{and as he}} <b>sat</b> up <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark he felt himself dreadfully forsaken and desolate, and began to comment on things in general to his dog, by way of {{inducing}} a more sociable and cheery state of mind.|$|R
50|$|Hansen, Schou & Weller was a {{photographic}} studio in Copenhagen. Many celebrities <b>sat</b> for portraits <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last {{decades of the}} 19th century.|$|R
60|$|I <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{snow and}} {{sunlight}} some minutes {{after she was}} gone. Then, getting up, I went and stood by the burning furze. The blowing flames and the blue smoke were alive and beautiful; but behind them they were leaving blackened skeleton twigs.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed to}} Smith that dense {{darkness}} fell upon the place, {{and with it}} a silence that was awful. For a time {{that he could not}} reckon, that might have been years or might have been moments, he <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> utter darkness and the utter silence.|$|E
60|$|His {{head had}} sunk {{down on his}} breast, and he <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> high-backed chair, one hand resting on each leather-covered arm, his pale face showing almost ghostlike against the dark background, and with the faint November light illumining the dark-circled eyes, the bloodless lips, and deeply {{frowning}} brow.|$|E
6000|$|Queen Guinevere {{had fled}} the court, and <b>sat</b> [...] <b>There</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> holy house at Almesbury [...] Weeping, none with her save a little maid, [...] A novice: one low light betwixt them burned [...] Blurred by the {{creeping}} mist, for all abroad, [...] Beneath a moon unseen albeit at full, [...] The white mist, like a face-cloth to the face, [...] Clung {{to the dead}} earth, and the land was still.|$|R
60|$|I can see {{him still}} as he <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> his surgery, <b>the</b> burly doctor, rugged and strong for all the sixty winters that he carried. <b>There</b> he <b>sat</b> playing chess--always {{he seemed to be}} playing chess--with his son, a medical student, burly and rugged already as himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>there</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> window {{a certain}} {{young man named}} Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep; and while Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead."--Acts xx. 9.|$|R
60|$|They <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{gathering}} gloom. An early owl {{ventured out}} and hooted from his sheltered tree-top; {{a chorus of}} frogs down in the lake sent back an indignant reply; a honeysuckle vine that climbed over the veranda flaunted its perfumed blossoms to the hot, night air, luring pollen-bearers.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Field <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dim room by the window, {{seeing that}} splendor flush and fade, and {{thinking}} how dangerous {{it was to}} ask where one's wealth comes from in the world. Outside, {{the voices of the}} men thickened; they were dropping in by twos and fours, with teams and on foot.|$|E
60|$|Wetzel <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{gathering}} gloom {{while he}} pulled slowly on his pipe. The evening was very quiet; the birds had ceased their twittering; {{the wind had}} died away; {{it was too early}} for the bay of a wolf, the wail of a panther, or hoot of an owl; there was simply perfect silence.|$|E
60|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> evening {{they went}} to the Manor House. Marian had spent many hours <b>there,</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> empty rooms, wandered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> garden, and mused on past days, or dwelt on them with Agnes, and she had looked forward with great {{pleasure}} to having her brother there.|$|R
60|$|There she {{remained}} {{for what seemed}} to her a cruelly long time; she became so cold that she could hardly feel the ground beneath her feet; and her teeth shook in {{her head as she}} <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> alone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cold night air of an October night, with no warmer wrapping than a slight shawl thrown over her shoulders. <b>There</b> she <b>sat,</b> listening for every sound--longing to catch the rattle of the wheels that were to carry her away--fancying every moment that she heard footsteps approaching, and dreading lest the awful creak of the house-door opening should reach her ears.|$|R
60|$|Now {{the chain}} that held him was long, but Reddy had taken {{care not to}} get too near, and of course Bowser couldn't reach him. He tugged with all his might and yelped and barked frantically, but Reddy just <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> and grinned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> most {{provoking}} manner. It was great fun to tease Bowser this way.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{would not}} look at the prisoner, and turned her head resolutely towards the magistrate. I fancy she had been fond of that {{vagabond}} husband of hers: an enormous wedding-ring encircled her finger, and that, too, was swathed in black. She firmly believed that Kershaw's murderer <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dock, and she literally flaunted her grief before him.|$|E
60|$|Bradley <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Judge's {{office in}} a sort of daze. He could not say a word. His thought was not clear. He was not at all anxious. Somehow he could not feel that it was his fate that was being decided. On the contrary, it seemed to be some other person. He was not excited; he was only puzzled and wondering.|$|E
60|$|So they <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{pavilion}} {{watching the}} desert, over {{the sands of}} which their ship seemed to move, till at length the sun grew low, {{and they went to}} walk upon the deck. Then they returned to eat of the delicious food that was always provided for them in such plenty, and at nightfall sought their couches, and slept heavily, for they needed rest.|$|E
6000|$|But {{it did not}} please HIM at all. The {{moment of}} disgrace seemed at hand, for {{he had no idea}} how to make this pasty. He went to his rooms very sad. As he <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> lost <b>in</b> thought <b>the</b> goose Mimi, who was left free to walk about, came up to him and asked what was the matter? When she heard she said: ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{night was}} rather cold. In {{course of time}} Will Osten awoke, and called to the trapper to mend the fire, which he did, and then resumed his former occupation. Once or twice after that, one and another of the slumberers awoke, and, looking up sleepily for a few seconds, beheld the {{enduring}} man still hard at work. The last to lift his head that night was Larry. The puzzled Irishman gazed in mute amazement during the unusually long period of half a minute, for Benjamin Hicks still <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> glittering <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light of the camp-fire, grave as a Redskin, and busy as ever with the bones! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Next {{he called}} aloud {{and a man}} came, who it was I could not see <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark. The king {{commanded}} him {{to take me to}} one of the other huts and tie me up there to the roof-pole. The man obeyed, but he did not tie me up; he only blocked the hut with the door-board, and <b>sat</b> with me <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark alone.|$|R
60|$|So Pupkin <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{gloom and}} listened to this poet reciting Browning and he {{realized}} that everybody understood it but him. He could see Zena with her eyes fixed on the poet as if she were hanging on to every syllable (she was; she needed to), and he stood it just about fifteen minutes and then slid {{off the side of the}} verandah and disappeared without even saying good-night.|$|E
60|$|The {{intelligence}} of the lower animals is great--in some cases very great--but it does not amount to reason. If it did, those wolves would not have <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pride of physical strength and personal freedom, calmly awaiting their doom, while Daniel and Peter Davidson, Duncan McKay junior, Okematan the Cree Indian, another Indian named Kateegoose, and Jacques Bourassin, a half-breed, came thundering down towards them like infuriated centaurs.|$|E
6000|$|Still they <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glow of {{the wide}} red fire in the [...] winter, [...] Still they sat there by {{the door in the}} cool of the still summer [...] evening, [...] Still the mother seemed to be singing her babe there to slumber, [...] Still the father beheld her weep o'er the child that was dying, [...] Still the place was haunted by all the Past's sorrow and gladness! ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Cristie {{had listened}} without a word, {{but as she}} listened she had been asking herself who that could be with Calthea Rose. If it was not Walter Lodloe, who was it? And if it was he, why was he there? And if he was there, why did he stay there? Of course she was neither jealous nor worried nor troubled by such a thing, but the {{situation}} was certainly odd. She had come out expecting something, {{she did not know}} exactly what; it might not have been a walk among the sweet-pea blossoms, but she was very certain it was not a conversation with Mr. Petter, while Walter Lodloe <b>sat</b> over <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> moonlight with Calthea Rose.|$|R
60|$|When Moses {{rose and}} moodily began walking homeward, she {{followed}} at a distance. She could now keep farther off, for {{she knew the}} way through {{every part of the}} forest, and she only wanted to keep within sound of his footsteps {{to make sure that he}} was going home. When he emerged from the forest into the open moonlight, she sat down in its shadows and watched him as he walked over the open distance between her and the house. He went in; and then she waited a little longer for him to be quite retired. She thought he would throw himself on the bed, and then she could steal in after him. So she <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> quite <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shadows.|$|R
60|$|Pore old Sam <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> hugging 'imself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bed-clo'es, {{and getting}} wilder and wilder. He couldn't {{get out of}} the cab, and 'e couldn't call to them for fear of people coming up and staring at 'im. Ginger, smiling all over with 'appiness, had got a big cigar on and was pretending to pinch the barmaid's flowers, and Peter and the cabman was talking to some other chaps there. The only change Sam 'ad was when the boy walked the 'orse up and down the road.|$|R
60|$|Her {{thoughts}} in a whirl, her temples aching, her nerves paralyzed, her body numb with pain, Marguerite <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> darkness which surrounded her {{as with a}} pall. From where she sat {{she could not see}} the sea, but she heard the incessant mournful murmur of the incoming tide, which spoke of her dead hopes, her lost love, the husband she had with her own hand betrayed, and sent to his death.|$|E
6000|$|... "On Beacon Hill," [...] {{her husband}} assented. [...] "It {{was seven years}} ago, {{and as you can}} gather from his present appearance, he {{was little more than a}} boy. He <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> twilight, seeing things down in the valley which did not and never had existed--seeing things that never were born, you know--things for which you stretch out your arms, only to find them float away. He was quite young, of course." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{closed the}} bank as usual at five. Lincoln {{had not come}} couldn't come now till the nine-o'clock accommodation. For {{an hour after the}} shades were drawn he <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> semidarkness, silently pondering on his situation. This {{attitude}} and deep quiet were unusual to him. He heard the feet of friends and neighbors passing the door as he sat there by the smoldering coal fire, in the growing darkness. There was something impressive in his attitude.|$|E
60|$|This rural atavism, then, seized Robert Walmsley and possessed him. A queer {{thing he}} noticed in {{connection}} with it was that Alicia, sitting at his side, suddenly seemed to him a stranger. She {{did not belong to}} this recurrent phase. Never before had she seemed so remote, so colorless and high--so intangible and unreal. And yet he had never admired her more than when she <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> by him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rickety spring wagon, chiming no more with his mood and with her environment than the Matterhorn chimes with a peasant's cabbage garden.|$|R
5000|$|Again, let us {{remember}} that in some districts, such as Durham and Chester, bishops exercised temporal jurisdiction. Even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> King's Courts, as Lord Coke points out, often the judges were priests, before Innocent IV prohibited priests from acting as judges. Pollock and Maitland's History of the Laws of England gives us as a specimen date, that of 16 July 1195, on which <b>there</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Court of King's Bench an archbishop, three bishops, and three archdeacons. The same book tells us that: ...|$|R
60|$|She bolted {{the window}} as directed, and he retreated. His snug place {{proved to be a}} wretched little shelter of the roughest kind, formed of four hurdles {{thatched}} with brake-fern. Underneath were dry sticks, hay, and other litter of the sort, upon which he <b>sat</b> down; and <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark tried to eat his meal. But his appetite was quite gone. He pushed the plate aside, and shook up the hay and sacks, so as to form a rude couch, on which he flung himself down to sleep, for it was getting late.|$|R
