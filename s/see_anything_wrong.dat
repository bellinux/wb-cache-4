25|$|Justice White's dissent {{argued that}} the act should have been upheld. Determining the level of {{spending}} {{by the federal government}} is a legislative function, not an executive one, he argued. Even if the power were executive, White did not <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> with delegating that power to an agent as long as Congress could influence him only by a means that is subject to the Presentment and Bicameralism Clause requirements, which the act satisfied, since the Comptroller General could be influenced by Congress only through a joint resolution.|$|E

500|$|Some artists {{labeled with}} the [...] "hypnagogic pop" [...] tag, such as Neon Indian and Toro Y Moi, have {{rejected}} the label or denied {{that such a}} unified style exists. The Guardian called the hypnagogic tag [...] "pretentious". New York Times writer Jon Pareles criticized the style as [...] "annoyingly noncommittal music." [...] In 2009, producer Daniel Lopatin (AKA Oneohtrix Point Never) said: [...] "I don't think the hpop tag is representative of a movement or constituted by {{a select group of}} artists. I see it more as a discussion about nostalgia and its subliminal effects on culture. I don't <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> with the tag—it's just a way of engaging with a phenomenon." ...|$|E

I think we make far too much of it. After all, one's genitals are just one {{important part of the}} magnificent human body ... I contend that SEX IS SEX and LOVE IS LOVE. When combined, they work well together, if two people are of about the same mind. But they are really two discrete needs and should be treated as such. Time and space will not permit me to expound further, especially {{in the area of the}} psyche. I don't believe in overly moralistic philosophies. Have your sex, it can be exciting, if you're lucky. I hope the music that I present here makes you lucky." ...|$|E
500|$|Waugh was {{approached}} at the Oberoi by an Indian man, {{who was also}} staying at the hotel. The man called himself [...] "John" [...] and gave no surname. John {{said he was a}} man who had won money betting on cricket and asked Waugh to provide pitch and weather information; he also asked the Australian to reveal inside knowledge about the team, such as tactics and player selections, in exchange for US$4,000. Waugh accepted the money and agreed to provide information about the pitch and weather, but he refused to divulge the tactics that the Australians intended to use against their opposition, or information on which players would play and what their role would be. Information on pitch conditions provides an insight into the strategies that the team might adopt and which players might be used, and teams will field different players depending on the pitch, as their skills are suited to different conditions. The arrangement with John remained in place until the end of the 1994–95 Australian summer. Waugh later said that at the time, he did not <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> with his actions, reasoning that the agreement was similar to a player speculating about their form and the playing conditions in a pre-match media interview.|$|E
500|$|M.I.A. {{attributes}} much of {{her success}} to the [...] "homeless, rootlessness" [...] of her early life. Due to her and her family being displaced from Sri Lanka because of the Civil War, M.I.A. has become a refugee icon. The EMP Museum's 2008 Pop Conference featured paper submissions and discussions on M.I.A. presented {{on the theme of}} [...] "Shake, Rattle: Music, Conflict, and Change." [...] She has used networking sites such as Twitter and MySpace to discuss and highlight the human rights abuses and war crimes that Sri Lanka is accused of perpetrating against Tamils, citing news articles, human rights group reports, government reports, her own experiences as a child and on her return to the island in 2001 to support calls for a ceasefire. M.I.A. has also used a great deal of tiger print and imagery, a symbol for the Tamil Tigers in both album artwork and music videos, such as seen in [...] "Galang". Being the only Tamil widely known in Western media, M.I.A. has discussed how she feels a responsibility to represent the Tamil minority. M.I.A. has spoken of discussions with witnesses during and after the war as reinforcing the need for international intervention to protect and provide justice to Tamil people. As the 2009 Tamil diaspora protests gathered pace, she joined other activists in condemning the actions of the Sri Lankan government against the Tamil populace as a slow [...] "systematic" [...] genocide. Telling TIME that she didn't <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> in sticking up for 300,000 trapped and dying people, M.I.A. stated that international governments were privy to Sri Lanka's use of widespread censorship and propaganda on the rebellion during the island's civil war to aid its impunity in numerous atrocities on civilians, but had no will to end it. Sri Lanka's Foreign Secretary denied that his country perpetrated genocide, responding that he felt M.I.A. was [...] "misinformed" [...] and that [...] "it's best she stays with what she's good at, which is music, not politics." [...] She has also appeared on Real Time with Bill Maher, as well as other television networks, to discuss the issues in Sri Lanka and critique the Sri Lankan government and their censorship of the media.|$|E

5000|$|Of unknown parentage, Monthermer was {{probably}} born in County Durham. Before 1296, {{he was a}} squire {{in the service of}} Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester and Hertford and his wife Joan of Acre, the daughter of Edward I. After Gloucester's death in 1295, the widowed countess fell in love with Monthermer, and after inducing her father to knight him, secretly married him in January 1297. When she was forced to reveal the marriage in April, the King was enraged, and had Monthermer imprisoned at Bristol. Thomas Walsingham relates that, while pleading for her husband, Joan told her father [...] "No one <b>sees</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> if a great earl marries a poor and lowly woman. Why should there be <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> if a countess marries a young and promising man?" [...] With the intervention of Anthony Beck, Bishop of Durham, Edward relented, and released Monthermer from prison in August 1297. Monthermer then paid homage to Edward at Eltham Palace and was formally recognised as jure uxoris Earl of Gloucester and Hertford.|$|R

Pardo said that, Barrios, who suspended Yap on the same day the commissioner met with some top Sta. Lucia officials at the EDSA Shangri-la Hotel, [...] "the timing was awful. It should have been with some sense of propriety that the lunch offer was turned down."

2500|$|While Buddhism {{does not}} <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> with wealth gained ethically, it does see greed and craving for riches as negative, and praises contentment as 'the {{greatest}} wealth'. Poverty and debt {{are seen as}} causes of suffering, immorality and social unrest if they prevent one from having basic necessities and peace of mind. For laypeople, Buddhism promotes the middle way between a life of poverty and a materialistic or consumerist life in which one is always seeking to enrich oneself and to buy more things. For Buddhist laypersons then, to be Buddhist does not mean to reject all material things, but, according to Sizemore and Swearer: [...] "it specifies an attitude to be cultivated and expressed in whatever material condition one finds oneself. To be non-attached is to possess and use material things but not to be possessed or used by them. Therefore, the idea of non-attachment applies all across Buddhist society, to laymen and monk alike." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Bob Wyatt, Sutcliffe [...] "backed Jardine to the hilt" [...] on {{the subject}} of bowling [...] "bodyline" [...] aka [...] "fast leg theory". [...] Wyatt said that: [...] "Herbert never hesitated in his views about our bowling strategy. He did not <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> about {{pursuing}} the tactics". Les Ames agreed with Wyatt's view and said that, though the majority of the England players were morally opposed to Jardine's tactics, Sutcliffe took the pragmatic view that [...] "the ball is there, it's short, so hook it". [...] Sutcliffe himself was an outstanding player of the hook shot but Ames was unsure about how he would have coped with Larwood's accuracy if he had been playing against him. [...] According to Bill O'Reilly, Sutcliffe was the strongest advocate of bodyline and he sometimes acted like an [...] "unofficial captain", even initiating the tactics on his own responsibility. However, a close friend of Sutcliffe insisted that Sutcliffe [...] "was always behind authority" [...] and was absolutely loyal to his captain, but his private views about bodyline were another matter.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the day of}} Hoover's death, Hoover's {{secretary}} for five decades, Helen Gandy, began destroying his files. She turned over twelve boxes of the [...] "Official/Confidential" [...] files to Felt on May 4, 1972. This consisted of 167 files and 17,750 pages, many of them containing derogatory information. Felt stored them in his office, and Gray told the press that afternoon that [...] "there are no dossiers or secret files. There are just general files and I took steps to preserve their integrity." [...] Felt earlier that day had told Gray, [...] "Mr. Gray, the Bureau doesn't have any secret files", and later accompanied Gray to Hoover's office. They found Gandy boxing up papers. Felt said Gray [...] "looked casually at an open file drawer and approved her work", though Gray would later deny he looked at anything. Gandy retained Hoover's [...] "Personal File" [...] and destroyed it. When Felt was called to testify in 1975 by the U.S. House about the destruction of Hoover's papers, he said, [...] "There's no serious problems if we lose some papers. I don't <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> and I still don't." [...] At the same hearing, Gandy claimed that she had destroyed Hoover's personal files only after receiving Gray's approval. In a letter submitted to the committee in rebuttal of Gandy's testimony, Gray vehemently denied ever giving such permission. Both Gandy's testimony and Gray's letter {{were included in the}} committee's final report.|$|E
5000|$|Nannie {{was first}} married at age 16 to Charley Braggs, her co-worker at a linen factory. With her father's {{approval}} they married {{after four months}} of dating. Braggs was the only son of a single mother who insisted on continuing {{to live with him}} after he married. Nannie later wrote: I married, as my father wished, in 1921 to a boy I only knowed about four or five months who had no family, only a mother who was unwed and who had taken over my life completely when we were married. She never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> with what he done, but she would take spells. She would not let my own mother stay all night... Braggs' mother took up a lot of his attention and limited Nannie's activities. The marriage produced four daughters from 1923 to 1927. The stressed-out Nannie started drinking, and her casual smoking habit became a heavy addiction. Both unhappy partners suspected each other, correctly, of infidelity, and Braggs often disappeared for days on end.|$|R
50|$|Invited Talk on Traffic Awareness and Crime Prevention An invited talk on traffic {{awareness}} and crime prevention was organized on 15 March 2016 at Acropolis Institute of Technology and Research.

Kalyan Chakraborthy was welcomed by Dr. Kamal Bharani. After the introduction of the keynote speaker, the invited guest Shri Vipin Maheswari took up the session. He defined the role of a police officer as saviour of the society, somebody on whom, we all can depend upon. But was also worried about the tainted image of police in eyes of public. For the negative image, he felt media, movies and serials were also responsible, as these are easy source of information to common man.|$|R
50|$|Through this {{catalog of}} corruption, the Commission {{concluded}} that there was systematic and widespread abuse of public trust by public officials, to the extent that many officials failed to <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> morally <b>wrong</b> with their allocating land illegally. T*here were many centers of power which were responsible for the illegal allocation of land, yet the Commission makes it clear that the lead in public plunder has consistently been given from the top. Kenya, it concludes, has fallen into a state of ‘moral decadence’, this epitomized no more clearly than by the extensive participation in land grabbing by churches, mosques, temples and other faith institutions, these including such venerable institutions as the Catholic Archdiocese of Nairobi, the Church Commission of Kenya, and the Anglican Church.|$|R

He is known for taking pride in his work, and he ensures that the arena's ice surface is of the highest quality. He said: [...] "You know I'm particular, so if I <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> that's <b>wrong</b> -- a little chip of snow or something, you know, all that stuff matters a lot, 'cause a little snow can freeze and a guy hits it, never know what can happen, you know?"

If he had been told a little while ago what would be the present state of things, he would almost have laughed the speaker to scorn. He would never have thought a child as competent as Amy to the sole management of two sick persons, and he not able either to advise or cheer her. Yet he could not <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> went <b>wrong</b> that depended on her. His comforts were so cared for, that he was often sorry she should have troubled herself about them; and though he could have little of her company, he never was allowed to feel himself deserted. Anne, Arnaud, the old Italian nurse, or Amy herself, were easily summoned, and gave him full care and attention.|$|R

6000|$|Tracing {{the feeling}} {{back to its}} origin, it seems due to this: minds of the lower order can never <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> go <b>wrong</b> without {{experiencing}} {{a certain sense of}} resentment; and resentment, by its very nature, desires to vent itself upon some living and sentient creature, by preference a fellow human being. When the child, running too fast, falls and hurts itself, it gets instantly angry. [...] "Naughty ground to hurt baby!" [...] says the nurse: [...] "Baby hit it and hurt it." [...] And baby promptly hits it back, with vicious little fist, feeling every desire to revenge itself. By-and-by, when baby grows older and learns that the ground can't feel to speak of, he wants to put the blame upon somebody else, in order to have an object to expend his rage upon. [...] "You pushed me down!" [...] he says to his playmate, and straightway proceeds to punch his playmate's head for it--not because he really believes the playmate did it, but because he feels he must have some outlet for his resentment.
