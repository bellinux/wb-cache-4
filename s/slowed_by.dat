5|$|Argus {{was laid}} down in 1914 by William Beardmore and Company in Dalmuir, as the Conte Rosso. She was renamed after her {{purchase}} in September 1916 and was launched on 2 December 1917, her building having been <b>slowed</b> <b>by</b> labour shortages. The ship was commissioned on 16 September 1918. Formally named after Argus of the 100 Eyes from Greek mythology, Argus was nicknamed the Hat Box or the Flatiron due to her flat-topped appearance.|$|E
5|$|In week nine, the Bulldogs {{played the}} Buffalo All-Americans, who were undefeated at the time. Thorpe started the game but came out at halftime because he {{believed}} it would end in a tie. Both teams were <b>slowed</b> <b>by</b> a muddy field, and the football became soggy after three quarters. The lone score of the game came with under four minutes to play: a field goal from the Bulldogs' Feeney. The game was the only loss of the season for the All-Americans.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Lieutenant Colonel Eyre's {{force of}} 800 men {{landed on the}} east side of the Thames River, but they were <b>slowed</b> <b>by</b> tangled {{woodlands}} and swamplands. The New Jersey Loyalists landed after the initial wave of regulars, also delayed by the difficulty in moving the artillery through rough conditions, and they did not participate in the assault.|$|E

5|$|On June 6, the {{two major}} party campaigns crossed paths in Woodstock, Ontario. Speaking in the afternoon, St. Laurent drew a crowd of 200. To the shock of St. Laurent staffers, who {{remained}} for the Diefenbaker appearance, the PC leader drew an overflow crowd of over a thousand that evening, {{even though he was}} an hour late, with announcements made to the excited crowd that he was <b>slowed</b> <b>by</b> voters who wanted only to see him or shake his hand.|$|E
5|$|The journey west usually took {{between four}} and six months, but the Donner Party was <b>slowed</b> <b>by</b> {{following}} a new route called Hastings Cutoff, which crossed Utah's Wasatch Mountains and Great Salt Lake Desert. The rugged terrain and difficulties encountered while traveling along the Humboldt River in present-day Nevada {{resulted in the}} loss of many cattle and wagons, and caused splits within the group.|$|E
5|$|Though coral {{have large}} sexually-reproducing populations, their {{evolution}} can be <b>slowed</b> <b>by</b> abundant asexual reproduction. Gene flow is variable among coral species. According to the biogeography of coral species gene flow cannot {{be counted on}} as a dependable source of adaptation as they are very stationary organisms. Also, coral longevity might factor into their adaptivity.|$|E

5|$|When first discovered, Sedna {{was thought}} to have an unusually long {{rotational}} period (20 to 50 days). It was initially speculated that Sedna's rotation was <b>slowed</b> <b>by</b> the gravitational pull of a large binary companion, similar to Pluto's moon Charon. A search for such a satellite by the Hubble Space Telescope in March 2004 found nothing, and subsequent measurements from the MMT telescope suggest a much shorter rotation period of about 10 hours, more typical for a body of its size.|$|E
5|$|Within {{three hours}} of the {{derailment}} {{the site of the}} accident had been sealed off with a five-mile cordon. The line was expected to be closed for two weeks, with Virgin Trains saying that the line would not reopen to passenger services until 12 March 2007. The recovery operation was <b>slowed</b> <b>by</b> problems in getting heavy lifting gear to the site which required temporary roads to be constructed.|$|E
5|$|After {{the railroads}} from Boston to Lowell, Worcester, and Providence were {{chartered}} in 1830 and 1831, railroads to other surrounding cities including Newburyport and Portsmouth were proposed. The Eastern Railroad was chartered on April 14, 1836. Work began at East Boston in late 1836; it reached Lynn {{in the spring}} of 1837, but construction was <b>slowed</b> <b>by</b> the Panic of 1837 and did not reach Salem until 1838. Service from Salem to East Boston began on August 27, 1838, with fares half that of competing stagecoaches.|$|E

5000|$|Kaalia {{is shown}} being caught by Subinspector Das at 11.55 pm. The time is noted by Das {{by his own}} wrist watch. In India, {{generally}} a murder case is committed to trial {{months or even years}} after the murder. During trial, Kailash proves that Das's watch is <b>slower</b> <b>by</b> 13 minutes. He asks Das the time. Das consults the very same wrist watch he was wearing at the time of murder and tells the court that the time is 3.55 pm. At that very same time, the court's watch is showing 4.08 pm, proving that Das's watch was 13 minutes <b>slower.</b> <b>By</b> this fact, Kailash proves that Kaalia was caught at 12.08 am (on 1 July) rather than on 11.55 pm on 30 June thus conveniently bringing him out of suspicion. It is incomprehensible that the subinspector kept his watch <b>slower</b> <b>by</b> the same amount over the months it took the case to come to trial.|$|R
5|$|By 04:30, {{the left}} column of the 10th Division was near Kefr Haris, while the right column was at Selfit, but further {{advances}} were <b>slowed</b> <b>by</b> effective Ottoman rearguards. On the right, the 29th Brigade launched an attack at 06:45 but met strong resistance from German machine gunners a mile north of Selfit. The 31st Brigade began their advance at 08:45 but were held {{up in the}} woods east of Haris and south of Kefar Haris. At 15:00, the 29th and 31st Brigades renewed their attacks supported by artillery from the LXVII and LXVIII Brigades RFA. Haris was subsequently captured by an infantry charge into the village.|$|E
5|$|By mid-afternoon, D Company {{had finally}} moved into {{position}} and commenced an assault, {{pushing through the}} bunker system from the north-east with the Centurion tanks in close support crushing many bunkers and their occupants with their tracks. The progress of the Australian assault was <b>slowed</b> <b>by</b> thick vegetation {{and the size of}} the position, even as the resistance slackened and volume of fire diminished. Indeed, the bunker system was later found to cover nearly a square kilometre and was wider than the front of the assaulting company. Painstakingly the Australians searched each bunker systematically. With the action now over, D Company and the tanks subsequently linked up with B Company and established a night defensive position.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the North Carolina {{class was}} <b>slowed</b> <b>by</b> the {{aforementioned}} material issues, the changes {{made to the}} basic design after this date—namely the substitution of 16-inch for 14-inch guns—and the need to add both length and strength to the slipways already present in the navy yards. Increased use of welding was proposed as a possible way to reduce weight and bolster the structural design, as it could have reduced the ships' structural weight by 10%, but it was utilized in only about 30% of the ship. The costs associated with welding {{and an increase in}} the time of construction made it impractical.|$|E
50|$|Bicycles for velodromes have no brakes. They {{employ a}} single fixed rear gear, or cog, {{that does not}} freewheel. This helps {{maximise}} speed, reduces weight, and avoids sudden braking while nevertheless allowing the rider to <b>slow</b> <b>by</b> pushing back against the pedals.|$|R

5|$|Development was {{initially}} <b>slowed</b> <b>by</b> locally cooler sea surface temperatures and dry air, and the depression became Tropical Storm Patricia later that day. Once {{clear of the}} unfavorable region, Patricia traversed anomalously warm waters within an environment exceptionally conducive to rapid intensification. Dramatic strengthening began late on October21 and continued through October23. Patricia reached hurricane strength shortly after 00:00UTC on October22, featuring prominent outflow, well-defined banding features, and a developing eye. Data from Hurricane Hunters investigating the cyclone indicated Patricia to have reached Category4 status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale by 18:00UTC.|$|E
5|$|Following training, the {{battalion}} was deployed to New Guinea, arriving in Milne Bay in early August 1943. It saw {{action in the}} final stages of the Salamaua–Lae campaign in September 1943. The 2/15 took part in the landing at Lae, the first amphibious operation undertaken by Australian forces since the failed Gallipoli campaign in 1915. During the operation, the 2/15th was initially assigned the task of securing the beachhead following the 20th Brigade's landing. After being relieved it joined the advance west towards the town, <b>slowed</b> <b>by</b> heavy rains that turned the many creeks in the area into raging torrents, which were invariably covered by heavy Japanese fire from the opposite bank.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{inclement weather}} also {{hampered}} the Americans' advance, and until May 15 the recapturing forces were unsure {{of whether the}} Japanese had held their position or retreated. When the fog lifted on that day, {{it became clear that}} the Japanese had retreated further west. However, when the American forces gave chase, they were immediately <b>slowed</b> <b>by</b> an accidental air strike upon them by an American aircraft. By May 29, the Japanese forces numbered only 700–1,000, and these troops attempted to run through the advancing American forces as a last show of defiance against the recapturing forces. By May 30, the Americans had recaptured Attu, and although a few small pockets of Japanese troops remained on the island, the Battle of Attu had essentially concluded.|$|E

5|$|In 1900, Hobbs met Ada Ellen Gates, a cobbler's daughter, at {{an evening}} church service held in St Matthew's, Cambridge. The {{progress}} {{of their relationship}} was <b>slowed</b> <b>by</b> Hobbs' shyness and devotion to cricket, but the pair eventually married on 26 September 1906 at the church in which they met. They planned to keep the event quiet, but it {{was reported in the}} press and the couple received gifts and messages from Hobbs' Surrey team-mates. Hobbs so disliked being separated from his wife during cricket tours that in later years she often accompanied the team overseas. They had four children: Jack, born in 1907, Leonard in 1909, Vera in 1913 and Ivor in 1914.|$|E
5|$|In the east, the Red Army {{resumed their}} {{offensive}} on 12 January 1945. German forces were outnumbered twenty {{to one in}} aircraft, eleven to one in infantry, and seven to one in tanks on the Eastern Front. By {{the end of the}} month, the Red Army had made bridgeheads across the Oder, the last geographic obstacle before Berlin. The western Allies continued to advance as well, but not as rapidly as the Red Army. The Panzer Corps conducted a successful defensive operation on 17–24 February at the Hron River, stalling the Allied advance towards Vienna. The 1st and 2nd SS Panzer Corps made their way towards Austria, but were <b>slowed</b> <b>by</b> damaged railways.|$|E
5|$|In week nine, the All-Americans {{played the}} Bulldogs. Jim Thorpe, who was later {{inducted}} into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, started the game for the Bulldogs, but he came out at halftime because he believed it would end in a tie. Both teams were <b>slowed</b> <b>by</b> a muddy field, and the football became soggy after three quarters. Neither the All-Americans nor the Bulldogs could gain a lot of yards during the game. The lone score of the game came with under four minutes to play: a field goal from the Bulldogs' Al Feeney. He never missed a field goal the entire 1920 season, and the final score of the game was 3–0.|$|E
