50|$|Each <b>Switching</b> <b>Module</b> (SM) handles {{several hundred}} {{to a few}} {{thousand}} telephone lines or several hundred trunks or combination thereof. Each has its own processors, also called Module Controllers, which perform most call handling processes, using their own memory boards. Originally the peripheral processors were to be Intel 8086, but those proved inadequate and the system was introduced with Motorola 68000 series processors. The name of the cabinet that houses this equipment was changed {{at the same time}} from Interface Module to <b>Switching</b> <b>Module.</b>|$|E
50|$|The 5ESS-2000 version, {{introduced}} in the 1990s, increased {{the capacity of the}} <b>switching</b> <b>module</b> (SM), with more peripheral modules and more optical links per SM to the communications module (CM). A follow-on version, the 5ESS-R/E, was in development during the late 1990s but did not reach market. Another version was the 5E-XC.|$|E
40|$|A <b>switch</b> <b>module</b> M with W {{terminals}} on {{each side}} {{is said to be}} universal if every set of nets satisfying the dimensional constraint (i. e., the number of nets {{on each side}} of M is at most W) is simultaneously routable through M. In this article, we present a class of universal <b>switch</b> <b>modules.</b> Each of our <b>switch</b> <b>modules</b> has 6 W switches and switch-module flexibility three (i. e., FS � 3). We prove that no <b>switch</b> <b>module</b> with less than 6 W switches can be universal. We also compare our <b>switch</b> <b>modules</b> with those used in the Xilinx XC 4000 family FPGAs and the antisymmetric <b>switch</b> <b>modules</b> (with FS � 3) 1 suggested by Rose and Brown [1991]. Although these two kinds of <b>switch</b> <b>modules</b> also have FS � 3 and 6 W switches, we show that they are not universal. Based on combinatorial counting techniques, we show that each of our universal <b>switch</b> <b>modules</b> can accommodate up to 25 % more routing instances, compared with the XC 4000 -type <b>switch</b> <b>module</b> of the same size. Experimental results demonstrate that our universal <b>switch</b> <b>modules</b> improve routability at the chip level. Finally, our work also provides a theoretical insight into the important observation by Rose and Brown [1991] (based on extensive experiments) that FS � 3 is often sufficient to provide high routability...|$|R
40|$|<b>Switch</b> <b>modules</b> are {{the most}} {{important}} component of the routing resources in FPGA's and FPIC's. The quality of <b>switch</b> <b>modules</b> greatly affects FPGA/FPIC routing solutions. The switch-module design problem was studied in [23]. In order to analyze the routability of designed <b>switch</b> <b>modules,</b> a heuristic algorithm based on network-flow techniques was proposed. In this paper, we mathematically show that the network-flow based algorithm has provably good performance with the bounds 5 and 5 / 4 away from the optima for two types of <b>switch</b> <b>modules,</b> respectively. Based on the analyses, we developed a new method for designing <b>switch</b> <b>modules.</b> Experimental results show that our designed <b>switch</b> <b>modules</b> significantly improve routability, compared with those in [23].

5000|$|Translucent OXCs (optical and {{electronic}} switching) - As {{a compromise between}} opaque and transparent OXC's, there {{is a type of}} OXC called a translucent OXC. In such a switch architecture, there is a switch stage which consists of an optical <b>switch</b> <b>module</b> and an electronic <b>switch</b> <b>module.</b> Optical signals passing through the switch stage can be switched either by the optical <b>switch</b> <b>module</b> or the electronic <b>switch</b> <b>module.</b> In most cases, the optical <b>switch</b> <b>module</b> is preferred for the purpose of transparency. When the optical <b>switch</b> <b>module's</b> <b>switching</b> interfaces are all busy or an optical signal needs signal regeneration through an OEO conversion process, the electronic module is used. Translucent OXC nodes provide a compromise of full optical signal transparency and comprehensive optical signal monitoring. It also provides the possibility of signal regeneration at each node.|$|R
50|$|In fiber optics, a {{reconfigurable}} optical add-drop multiplexer (ROADM) {{is a form}} {{of optical}} add-drop multiplexer that adds the ability to remotely switch traffic from a wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) system at the wavelength layer. This is achieved {{through the use of a}} wavelength selective <b>switching</b> <b>module.</b> This allows individual or multiple wavelengths carrying data channels to be added and/or dropped from a transport fiber without the need to convert the signals on all of the WDM channels to electronic signals and back again to optical signals.|$|E

The SM performs multiplexing, analog and digital coding, and other work to interface with external equipment. Each has a controller, a small computer with duplicated CPUs and memories, like most common equipment of the exchange, for redundancy. Distributed systems lessen the load on the Central Administrative Module (AM) or main computer.|$|E

5000|$|The Very Compact Digital Exchange (VCDX) was {{developed}} with the 5ESS-2000, and marketed to mostly non-Bell telephone companies as an inexpensive, {{effective way to}} offer ISDN and other digital services in an analog switching center. This avoided the capital expense of retrofitting the entire analog switch into a digital one to serve all of the switch's lines when many wouldn't require it and would remain POTS lines. An example would be the (former) GTE/Verizon Class-5 telephone switch, the GTD-5 EAX. Like the Western Electric 1ESS/1AESS, it served mostly medium to large wire centers. The standalone VCDX was also capable of serving as a switch for very small wire centers (a CDX- Community dial office) of fewer than ~400 lines. However, for small wire centers, 400-4000 lines, that function was usually served by RSM's, a 5ESS [...] "Remote SM". The RSM is controlled over redundant and diverse fiber optic [...] "umbilicals". An RSM can {{have more than one}} SM, and also many other peripheral units that are part of a full 5ESS switch. An RSM can serve parts of a larger metro area, but is more often used as a Class-5 wire center for small to medium towns hosted from a 5ESS located in a larger city.The VCDX was also used as a large private branch exchange (PBX). The standalone VCDX has a single <b>Switching</b> <b>Module,</b> and no Communications Module. Its Sun Microsystems SPARC workstation runs the UNIX-based Solaris (operating system) that executes a 3B20/21D processor MERT OS emulation system, acting as the VCDX's Administrative Module. The VCDX uses the CO's normal telephone power sources (which are very large uninterruptible power supply's), and has connections to the CO Digital cross connect system for T1 access, etc.|$|E

40|$|Online onboard {{aeroengine}} models (OBEMs) {{have been}} widely used in health management, fault diagnostics, and fault-tolerant control. A mismatch between the OBEM and the actual engine may be caused by a variety of factors such as health degradation or sensor fault and may influence the effectiveness of the systems mentioned above. However, mismatch caused by unpredictable sensor fault is hardly distinguished from that caused by health degradation through the tuning process. A fault-tolerant OBEM tuning structure is provided to perform the online tuning function when health degradation and sensor fault coexist. This system includes three parts that include improved fault diagnostics and isolation (IFDI), a fault-tolerant OBEM tuning system (FTOTS), and a channel <b>switching</b> <b>module.</b> IFDI is used to distinguish the cause of mismatch and provide fault information, a FTOTS is used to complete an online tuning process based on information obtained from the IFDI, and the channel <b>switching</b> <b>module</b> is used to switch the working process from the IFDI to the FTOTS.

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} a <b>switch</b> <b>module</b> routing problem for symmetrical-array field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA’s). This problem {{was first introduced}} in [21]. They used it to evaluate the routability properties of <b>switch</b> <b>modules</b> which they proposed. Only an approximation algorithm for the problem was proposed by them. We give an optimal algorithm for the problem based on integer linear programming (ILP). Experiments show that this formulation leads to fast and efficient solutions to practical-sized problems. We then propose a precomputation that eliminates the need to use ILP on-line. We also identify special cases of this problem that reduce to problems for whom efficient algorithms are known. Thus, the <b>switch</b> <b>module</b> routing problem can be solved in polynomial time for these special cases. Using our solution to the <b>switch</b> <b>module</b> routing problem, we propose a new metric to estimate the congestion in each <b>switch</b> <b>module</b> in the FPGA.

The purpose of the <b>switching</b> <b>module</b> is to aid a helicopter pilot in entering and leaving coordinated turns while in flight. The criteria that determine the transitions between modes are imprecise and depend on the varied ranges of three flight conditions (i. e., simulated parameters) : Commanded Rate, Duration, and Roll Attitude. The parameters were given fuzzy ranges and used as input variables to a fuzzy rulebase containing the knowledge of mode switching. The fuzzy control program was integrated into a real time interactive helicopter simulation tool.
