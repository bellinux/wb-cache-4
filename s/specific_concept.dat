5|$|Margot Kidder as Lois Lane: A {{reporter}} at the Daily Planet, who becomes a romantic interest to Clark Kent. The producers and director had a very <b>specific</b> <b>concept</b> for Lois: liberated, hard-nosed, witty and attractive. Kidder was cast because her performance had a certain spark and vitality, and because of her strong interaction with Christopher Reeve. Over 100 actresses were considered for the role. Margot Kidder (suggested by Stalmaster), Anne Archer, Susan Blakely, Lesley Ann Warren, Deborah Raffin and Stockard Channing screen tested from March through May 1977. The final decision was between Channing and Kidder, with the latter winning the role.|$|E
25|$|TRW {{suggested}} building three bases with thirty missiles each, {{and estimated}} {{that one of}} the three bases would survive an all-out counterforce attack. To ensure that 600 warheads would survive, each missile would have to carry about 20 warheads. These studies led to the Missile, Experimental, or MX, project, which started in 1971. The design rapidly firmed up, emerging with ten-warheads on more missiles in order to raise the survivors to 1,000 warheads. But the basing became not so much a <b>specific</b> <b>concept</b> as a catch-all program for every possible concept, from railway deployments, to underground racetracks, to mobile systems. A review of the options written in the mid-1970s ran into hundreds of pages.|$|E
25|$|TLC is an {{instance}} of a more general class of models known as semantic networks. In a semantic network, each node is to be interpreted as representing a <b>specific</b> <b>concept,</b> word, or feature. That is, each node is a symbol. Semantic networks generally do not employ distributed representations for concepts, as {{may be found in}} a neural network. The defining feature of a semantic network is that its links are almost always directed (that is, they only point in one direction, from a base to a target) and the links come in many different types, each one standing for a particular relationship that can hold between any two nodes. Processing in a semantic network often takes the form of spreading activation (see above).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} the methodology {{developed for the}} selection and acquisition of <b>concepts</b> <b>specific</b> for the Balkans within the BalkaNet project. The main goal of this project was {{the construction of a}} multilingual semantic lexical database of the WordNet type for Balkan languages. Balkan <b>specific</b> <b>concepts</b> are concepts which are commonly used in the Balkan area, but are not recognized by the Princeton WordNet, the paradigm for the construction of wordnets for many languages. Domain and language characteristics of Balkan <b>specific</b> <b>concepts</b> are being discussed, as well as the establishment of the potential equivalents and the encountered problems in the application of the methodology adopted. The contribution of Serbian <b>specific</b> <b>concepts</b> to this subset is discussed in more detail...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{will examine}} the {{question}} of how to translate culture <b>specific</b> <b>concepts</b> in the Dutch and American translation of the novel Bridget Jones's Diary when the goal is to maintain the original effect of the novel. One of the main decisions a translator will have to make is whether or not to preserve the British character of the novel to make it more authentic or to adapt the novel to other cultures in order to make sure that people in other countries can also identify with Bridget. Whereas Venuti claims that it is a translator’s duty to stay faithful to the source text and thus apply the strategy of foreignization, I will argue in this thesis that a domesticizing translation strategy is preferred when translating Bridget Jones’s Diary; in order to maintain the effect from the original novel, the translators need to translate the British culture <b>specific</b> <b>concepts</b> into American and Dutch culture <b>specific</b> <b>concepts.</b> This thesis will use several translation theories to link culture <b>specific</b> <b>concepts</b> to the struggle of translators to maintain the original effect of the novel...|$|R

2500|$|There {{was a very}} <b>specific</b> <b>concept</b> {{the filmmakers}} had for Lois: liberated, hard-nosed, witty and attractive. Kidder was cast because {{director}} Richard Donner and the producers agreed that her performance had a certain spark and vitality, and because of her strong interaction with Christopher Reeve. Donner feels Kidder seemed to convey the general American concept of Lois Lane—pretty, pert and perky, intelligent and ambitious without being pushy. Actresses who auditioned for the role include Anne Archer, Deborah Raffin, Susan Blakely, Stockard Channing and Lesley Ann Warren.|$|E
2500|$|Operational {{definitions}} are {{at their}} most controversial {{in the fields of}} psychology and psychiatry, where intuitive concepts, such as intelligence need to be operationally defined before they become amenable to scientific investigation, for example, through processes such as IQ tests. Such definitions are used as a follow up to a theoretical definition, in which the <b>specific</b> <b>concept</b> is defined as a measurable occurrence. John Stuart Mill pointed out the dangers of believing that anything that could be given a name must refer to a thing and Stephen Jay Gould and others have criticized psychologists for doing just that [...] A committed operationalist would respond that speculation about the thing in itself, or noumenon, should be resisted as meaningless, and would comment only on phenomena using operationally defined terms and tables of operationally defined measurements [...]|$|E
40|$|Model-based most <b>specific</b> <b>concepts</b> are a {{non-standard}} reasoning {{service in}} Description Logics. They {{have turned out}} to be useful in knowledge base completion for ontologies that are written in certain extensions of EL. There is indication that model-based most <b>specific</b> <b>concepts</b> can also be applied for knowledge base completion in other inexpressive description logics. We show that model-msc exist in the logics FL 0 and FLE with cyclic TBoxes and for ALC ∪ ∗ with acyclic TBoxes. We provide constructions for model-msc in these three logics...|$|R

5000|$|Starting from an {{analysis}} of the opposition of truth and fiction dictated by the traditional idea of philosophy and science, and an examination of the concomitant confrontation of philosophy and science {{on the one hand and}} literature on the other hand this study investigates the peculiar status which Michel Foucault gives to the concept of knowledge. This concept of knowledge corresponds in Foucault's writings to a <b>specific</b> <b>concept</b> of fiction in a way that has yet to be clearly defined. To this end Foucault's early texts (apparently dismissed by him later), the long Binswanger-introduction (1954), and the Archéologie du savoir are all searched for a motif which can be called - employing an expression by Foucault himself - the [...] "Birth of a World". The investigation into this theme renders visible elements of [...] "structure" [...] and [...] "history". In the course of this reading the evolution of the foundational thought-structures leading to Foucault's <b>specific</b> <b>concept</b> of knowledge will be examined.|$|E
