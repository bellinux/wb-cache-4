40|$|AbstractVerifications on the {{achievement}} of programme outcomes in engineering programmes is a key requirement in the accreditation of such programmes. Various methods {{have been used to}} assess student's performance, for example, through assignments, tests, laboratory work, final examinations and group assignment. An issue that often arises is whether the assessment methods are actually testing the abilities of the students, in other words, whether the tasks or questions formulated are too easy or too difficult for academicians to ascertain whether students have achieved the stated programme outcomes. It will be necessary to verify {{the achievement}} through a quantitative and <b>systematic</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>system.</b> This paper reports a preliminary study on the assessment of the final examination questions of KJ 4953 and KP 4213 courses at the Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia for determining the difficulty index of examinations and how the index can be related to {{the achievement of}} programme outcomes (PO). For both KJ 4953 and KP 4213 courses in the 2009 / 2010 session, it is found that all the exams questions are appropriate to measure the programme outcomes for both courses as it can be classified as moderate and too hard with regards to their difficulty levels...|$|R

Methods: The prospective clinical study involving 56 patients with bilateral cataract having lens removal at the Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital Hradec Králové in the period from September 2007 to March 2009. During the surgery lens was removed using torsional phacoemulsification and bimanual irigation/aspiration. Cleaning of the posterior capsule of the right eye was performed using AquaLase method (Alcon Laboratories, Forth Worth, Texas, USA) based on pulsed warm, naturally balanced surgical solution. Intraocular lens AcrySof SA 60 AT was implanted bilaterally to all patients. All patients were examined preoperatively and 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after surgery. Each examination covered best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), endothelial cell count (ECC) and corneal pachymetry. Moreover postoperatively digital retroillumination photographs of the anterior segment focused on the posterior capsule were always obtained. The Evaluation of Posterior Capsule Opacification (EPCO 2000) software and the Open-Access <b>Systematic</b> Capsule <b>Assessment</b> (OSCA) <b>system</b> were used [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The preoccupation of many {{conservation}} planners {{with the}} refinement of <b>systematic</b> <b>assessment</b> techniques has manifested an “implementation crisis” in conservation planning. This preoccupation has provided <b>systematic</b> <b>assessments</b> with well-tested tools (e. g., area selection algorithms) and principles (e. g., representation, complementarity), but {{our understanding of}} these techniques currently far exceeds our ability to apply them effectively to pragmatic conservation problems. The science is informative about where one needs to do conservation, but silent on how to achieve it. Operational models, defined as simplified conceptualizations of processes for implementing conservation action at priority conservation areas, are essential for guiding conservation planning initiatives because they assist understanding of how these processes function. Operational models developed to date have largely been linear, simplistic, {{and focused on the}} <b>systematic</b> <b>assessment</b> of biological entities. Experience in the real world indicates that operational models for conducting conservation planning initiatives should explicitly complement a <b>systematic</b> conservation <b>assessment</b> with activities that empower individuals and institutions (enabling) and explicitly aim to secure conservation action (implementation). Specifically, implementing effective conservation action requires that <b>systematic</b> <b>assessments</b> be integrated functionally with a process for developing an implementation strategy and processes for stakeholder collaboration while maintaining a broad focus on the implementation of conservation action. A suite of hallmarks define effective operational models (e. g., stakeholder collaboration, links with land-use planning, social learning, and action research). Greater development and testing of the practical application of operational models should lead to higher levels of effective implementation and alleviate the implementation crisis. Social learning institutions are essential for ensuring ongoing improvement in the development and application of operational models that deliver effective conservation action...|$|R

40|$|<b>Systematic</b> {{conservation}} <b>assessment</b> {{and conservation}} planning are two distinct fields of conservation science often confused as {{one and the}} same. <b>Systematic</b> conservation <b>assessment</b> is the technical, often computer-based, identification of priority areas for conservation. Conservation planning is composed of a <b>systematic</b> conservation <b>assessment</b> coupled with processes for development of an implementation strategy and stakeholder collaboration. The peer-reviewed conservation biology literature abounds with studies analyzing the performance of assessments (e. g., area-selection techniques). This information alone, however, can never deliver effective conservation action; it informs conservation planning. Examples of how to translate <b>systematic</b> <b>assessment</b> outputs into knowledge and then use them for "doing" conservation are rare. South Africa has received generous international and domestic funding for regional conservation planning since the mid- 1990 s. We reviewed eight South African conservation planning processes and identified key ingredients of best practice for undertaking <b>systematic</b> conservation <b>assessments</b> {{in a way that}} facilitates implementing conservation action. These key ingredients include the design of conservation planning processes, skills for conservation assessment teams, collaboration with stakeholders, and interpretation and mainstreaming of products (e. g., maps) for stakeholders. Social learning institutions are critical to the successful operationalization of assessments within broader conservation planning processes and should include not only conservation planners but also diverse interest groups, including rural landowners, politicians, and government employees.
