40|$|A Pease-Anthony Venturi <b>scrubber</b> is a <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> {{device that}} uses liquid, {{injected}} in the equipment as jets, to remove contaminants from the gas. The liquid jet is atomized into droplets, which are dispersed throughout the equipment {{due to the}} turbulence. The performance of the scrubber {{is affected by the}} spatial distribution of the droplets. Although CFD models have been used to predict the droplet dispersion, these models are expensive. Alternatively, the concept of "jet spreading angle" {{could be used as a}} simple and quick way to estimate droplet dispersion. The purpose of this paper is to measure the spreading angle of jets transversally injected into the throat of a Venturi scrubber and correlate it with both gas and jet velocities. The throat gas velocities varied between 59 and 74 m/s and the jet velocity between 3. 18 and 19. 1 m/s. The angles were measured through image analysis, obtained with high velocity photography. The spreading angle was found to be strongly dependent on jet velocity...|$|R
40|$|The {{rate and}} volume of {{generation}} of waste material in the developing societies has increased significantly. Correspondingly the demand of energy has increased many folds. One of the options in this situation is to receover the energy value of the waste material for production of power and heat through gasification. Gasification of materials is a proven concept and its environmental benefits are known. The characteristic behavior and scope of gasification of four waste materials namely steam treated Food Waste (FW), Poultry Waste (PW), steam treated Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) and Used Tyres (UT) have been studied in a 10 kg/hr hybrid gasification plant. This pilot plant consists of a fixed bed gasifier followed by a two in one cyclone <b>scrubber</b> for <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> and a flare system. Various laboratory tests of these materials through proximate, ultimate analysis and stove test were conducted to establish their fuel characteristics. These materials were gasified to generate synthesis gas. It was observed that FW and UT offer sustainable potential for energy recovery. MSW {{on the other hand}} had considerable ash and had difficulties during gasification. PW could only be gasified when mixed with charcoal or high CV UT in order to balance against its high moisture. The gas analysis of the waste indicated significant quantities of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Keywrods: Gasification, Hybrid gasifier, Food waste, Poultry waste, 1.

40|$|AbstractCurrent {{progress}} in flue <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> for CO 2 capture from oxyfuel combustion {{has been described}} based on conceptual development, fundamental understanding and practical tests at the Schwarze Pumpe Oxyfuel Pilot Plant (OxPP). Significant improvement in understanding the characteristics of SOx, NOx, particulate matters (PMs) and non-condensable gas components in flue <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> processes provide a scientific basis for further developments of flue <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> technologies. Testing results from pilot studies have proved that flue <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> systems have reached the achievable performance and have also shown that there is generally no fundamental technical bottleneck {{for most of the}} flue <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> technologies.

Changes in flue <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> technologies may be excepted if more attractive <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> processes could be successfully developed in the near future; for example, NOx removal and control technologies.

40|$|Development {{efforts have}} been {{underway}} for decades to replace dry-gas cleaning technology with humid-gas cleaning technology that would maintain the water vapor content in the raw <b>gas</b> by conducting <b>cleaning</b> at sufficiently high temperature to avoid water vapor condensation and would thus significantly simplify the plant and improve its thermal efficiency. Siemens Power Generation, Inc. conducted a program with the Gas Technology Institute (GTI) to develop a Novel Gas Cleaning process that uses {{a new type of}} gas-sorbent contactor, the ''filter-reactor''. The Filter-Reactor Novel Gas Cleaning process described and evaluated here is in its early stages of development and this evaluation is classified as conceptual. The commercial evaluations have been coupled with integrated Process Development Unit testing performed at a GTI coal gasifier test facility to demonstrate, at sub-scale the process performance capabilities. The commercial evaluations and Process Development Unit test results are presented in Volumes 1 and 2 of this report, respectively. Two <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> applications with significantly differing <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> requirements were considered in the evaluation: IGCC power generation, and Methanol Synthesis with electric power co-production. For the IGCC power generation application, two sets of <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> requirements were applied, one representing the most stringent ''current'' <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> requirements, and a second set representing possible, very stringent ''future'' <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> requirements. Current <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> requirements were used for Methanol Synthesis in the evaluation because these cleaning requirements represent the most stringent of cleaning requirements and the most challenging for the Filter-Reactor Novel Gas Cleaning process. The scope of the evaluation for each application was: (1) Select the configuration for the Filter-Reactor Novel Gas Cleaning Process, the arrangement of the individual <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> stages, and the probable operating conditions of the <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> stages to conceptually satisfy the <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> requirements; (2) Estimate process material & energy balances for the major plant sections and for each <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> stage; (3) Conceptually size and specify the major <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> process equipment; (4) Determine the resulting overall performance of the application; and (5) Estimate the investment cost and operating cost for each application. Analogous evaluation steps were applied for each application using conventional <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> technology, and comparison was made to extract the potential benefits, issues, and development needs of the Filter-Reactor Novel Gas <b>Cleaning</b> technology. The <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> process and related gas conditioning steps were also required to meet specifications that address plant environmental emissions, the protection of the gas turbine and other Power Island components, and the protection of the methanol synthesis reactor. Detailed material & energy balances for the <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> applications, coupled with preliminary thermodynamic modeling and laboratory testing of candidate sorbents, identified the probable sorbent types that should be used, their needed operating conditions in each stage, and their required levels of performance. The study showed that Filter-Reactor Novel Gas Cleaning technology can be configured to address and conceptually meet all of the <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> requirements for IGCC, and that it can potentially overcome several of the conventional IGCC power plant availability issues, resulting in improved power plant thermal efficiency and cost. For IGCC application, Filter-Reactor Novel Gas Cleaning yields 6 % greater generating capacity and 2. 3 percentage-points greater efficiency under the Current Standards case, and more than 9 % generating capacity increase and 3. 6 percentage-points higher efficiency in the Future Standards case. While the conceptual equipment costs are estimated to be only slightly lower for the Filter-Reactor Novel Gas Cleaning processes than for the conventional processes, the improved power plant capacity results in the potential for significant reductions in the plant cost-of-electricity, about 4. 5 % for the Current Standards case, and more than 7 % for the Future Standards case. For Methanol Synthesis, the Novel Gas Cleaning process scheme again shows the potential for significant advantages over the conventional <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> schemes. The plant generating capacity is increased more than 7 % and there is a 2. 3 %-point gain in plant thermal efficiency. The Total Capital Requirement is reduced by about 13 % and the cost-of-electricity is reduced by almost 9 %. For both IGCC Methanol Synthesis cases, there are opportunities to combine some of the filter-reactor polishing stages to simplify the process further to reduce its cost. This evaluation has devised plausible humid-gas cleaning schemes for the Filter-Reactor Novel Gas Cleaning process that might be applied in IGCC and Methanol Synthesis applications...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is a {{comparison}} of different kinds of flue <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> systems of municipal solid waste incinerators (MSWI). This comparison will be done with the aid of material flow analysis. In addition, investment costs will be taken into consideration. The main topic of the investigation is the relationship between type of flue <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> system and resulting material flow including auxiliary chemicals and solid residues. Material flow analyses are performed by model calculations. Data used for these calculations are representative of operating values for technical-scale plants. As starting point a model plant with grate firing is considered. For this plant 10 different flue <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> systems are analysed, 6 of them being equipped with a wet cleaning system. Additionally, 2 systems operating in a semi dry sorption and 2 systems operating in conditioned dry sorption are taken into account. The system boundaries for the material flow analysis performed include the entire flue <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> system, starting with the raw gas downstream of the boiler and ending downstream of the stack. The elements chlorine (Cl), sulfur (S), mercury (Hg), cadmium and lead are considered. As a result of this work, two flue <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> concepts seem to be very interesting for the construction of new plants: A plant with a wet flue <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> system equipped with fabric filter followed by a two-stage scrubber system generates small amounts of residues by low investment costs.

30|$|The {{gasification}} and <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning,</b> biomass pretreatment, {{and road}} infrastructure stages {{contribute significantly to}} the GWP results for all systems, whereas the cultivation stage is a large contributor for the straw-based systems. In most biomass systems, negative emissions are produced during the biofuel conversion stage as the excess electricity is exported to the grid. Specifically for the FT diesel conversion stage, the production of naphtha and kerosene results in additional benefits. However, these benefits are smaller than the excess electricity benefits. In general, between the TB- and TW-based systems, torrefaction results in benefits in the pretreatment stage, due to decreasing the electricity requirements of the pelletization step, and in the transportation stage due to the feedstock having a higher calorific value. Hence, fewer feedstock (in mass unit) should be transported to produce {{the same amount of}} transportation fuel (in energy unit) in the torrefied system. Moreover, torrefaction results in benefits in the gasification and <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> stage by lowering the requirements for the <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> step due to the lower tar content of the product gas. On the other hand, due to the mass and energy losses during torrefaction, more wood chips are required for the TB-based systems, which result in higher storage emissions of the wood chips.|$|R
