This {{is true for the}} Prudhoe Bay Miscible Gas Project (PBMGP) in which the enriched-hydrocarbon miscible injectant (MI) is expected to sweep only approximately 30 % of the reservoir volume in the project areas. The Prudhoe Bay reservoir has a relatively thick oil column, high inter-sand vertical permeability, high net-gross, and is generally developed on 80 acre (324 = 103 m 2) well spacing. An infill drilling project was implemented in the Northwest Fault Block (NWFB) area of Prudhoe Bay (Fig. 1) to improve solvent sweep efficiency and increase EOR reserves. This project differs from many EOR infill drilling projects in that most of the additional recovery is attributable toEOR, with minimal improvement in waterflood recovery. The infill project is feasible because th reservoir is relatively thick, and sufficient EOR reserves are obtained from miscible displacement around new injectors. A significant increase in flood rate can also occur, resulting in production acceleration. Results of the project will guide analysis of infill drilling in other EOR areas at Prudhoe.

40|$|A gel is {{a liquid}} trapped within a diluted mesh of {{cross-linked}} polymer chains. The systematic study of gels, {{started in the}} 1940 s, takes undoubtedly its roots {{within the field of}} physico-chemistry. Indeed, {{as a result of the}} complex interactions between the polymer chains and the solvent molecules, gels exhibits a volume phase transition during which they may absorb several thousands times their own weight in solvent in response to a tiny change in environmental conditions. Consequently, gels have initially been a subject of choice for the development of the theory of phase transitions, along with polymer chains and solutions. Thanks to fascinating studies from the 1970 s and the following two decades, the interest for gels has flourished and they progressively became an important object in the mechanics of polymeric materials and volumetric growth. As it is well known, a growth process opens the door to the possibility of self-organization and the emergence of spatio-temporal patterns. Indeed, because the association of a solvent with a polymer network exhibits a rather complex mechanical behaviour, sharing properties of both liquids and solids, unique features were observed during the swelling process of gels thanks, among others, to the pioneering work of Toyoichi Tanaka. Despite the considerable amount of work performed until the 1990 s, some problems, such as the formation of the creasing instability, one of the hallmark of gel swelling, had not been fully understood. Recently however, highly controlled experiments have brought new results, shining light on pattern formation in swelling gels and allowing for detailed comparisons with theoretical and numerical models. Hydrogels are of particular interest because they have the advantage of being accurately monitorable. However it is yet unknown how closely swelling hydrogels can mimic growing biological bodies. How the microstructural differences between a network of polymers and a soft tissue affect the mechanical stability? Does the microscopic  mechanisms underlying the volume variation affect the process of morphogenesis? Our goal is to clarify those aspects and precise the use of hydrogels as substitutes for growing soft tissues. For this purpose, specific models describing the variation of mass in each of those systems must be chosen. A swollen hydrogel is a system at mechanical and thermodynamical equilibrium, a situation that contrasts markedly with that of a biological body. In addition, the swelling from a dry state does not involve any production of its elastic constituents, but rather a migration of solvent molecules inside a highly deformable elastic network, again in opposition with biological growth. In order to describe the swelling process, a poroelastic model has recently been proposed for the swelling of gels immersed in a <b>solvent</b> <b>reservoir.</b> The model introduces two phases, the solvent molecules and a highly compressible polymer network, in thermodynamic equilibrium with a reservoir of solvent particles. At equilibrium the chemical potential inside the gel equates that of the solvent. On the contrary, volumetric growth is more simple and tractable analytically. Volumetric growth in soft tissues induces elastic stresses in at least three well identified cases: inhomogeneous and/or anisotropic growth, and incompatible boundary conditions. Then patterns result from the minimization of the elastic energy. They can be understood with the tools of bifurcation theory. Moreover, since soft-tissues are very often considered as incompressible, the use of volume-preserving transformations allows the elimination of the tensorial character of the equations of nonlinear elasticity, leading the possibility of deriving exact results. To illustrate these two different formalisms, I will consider two typical experiments. First the experiment of Tanaka, where a thin layer of gel swells but remains attached to a solid substrate. The second concerns the swelling of a ring enclosing an elastic disc which cannot swell. Both experiments exhibit a bucking pattern for enough swelling, then creases appear. Both theory (constant volumetric growth and poroelastic model) can be tested on these two cases. It turns out that swelling at constant chemical potential induces elastic instabilities for lower elastic strains but physically, there is no major differences. Both models require a regularization at threshold as predicted by Biot. Biot's interpretation of this rather peculiar feature is that the wavelength of the instability is selected by effects occurring on scales much smaller than the thickness of the layer. Indeed, it has been found recently that several small-scale effects (such as the presence of a diffusive layer or surface tension) can regularize the selection of the wavelength which then scales as the thickness of the growing layer corrected by a logarithmic factor involving the small length-scale. Finally one can wonder what will be the best model for growth of biological tissues. The behaviour of biological objects are undoubtedly the ultimate example of complex soft matter. Interestingly, many growing biological objects possess a gel-like structure and recent advances in developmental biology require the development of sophisticated models able to describe the concurrent mass production and reorganization processes that enable the reproducible generation of shapes in living objects. Although growing and swelling are obviously distinct processes, the fundamental understanding of mass reorganization in swelling gels is providing important tools to describe the more complex processes involved during biological growth. Gel swelling is spatially inhomogeneous, presents spontaneously stress inhibition, both features being inherent to biological growth. On the other hand it cannot mimic anisotropic growth. Our work aims at clarifying the distinctions between biological growth and swelling, but should also provide important results for the growth (biological or not) of stratified media...|$|E

40|$|A {{considerable}} {{portion of}} hydrocarbon {{resources in the}} world comprises heavy oils. Due to the high viscosity of these oils, production from these resources is difficult and requires especial enhanced oil recovery techniques. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) based vapor extraction (VAPEX) process has recently been introduced as an effective method for recovery of heavy oils. However, this method {{has not yet been}} implemented in oil fields. Previous studies on CO 2 -based VAPEX were performed in small cells under low pressure (< 9400 kPa) and temperature (< 60 °C) conditions. In this study, the CO 2 -based VAPEX process was simulated for a real heavy oil reservoir to determine the application of CO 2 as a non-condensable carrier gas, co-solvent, and solvent at high pressure (20, 685 kPa) and temperature (82. 2 °C) condition. Different solvent mixtures including propane (C 3), butane (C 4), methane (C 1), and CO 2 were utilized. It was found that in high pressure and temperature conditions, CO 2 is not a good non-condensable carrier gas due to the miscibility of solvent mixtures (C 3 /C 4 +CO 2) with the reservoir oil. In contrast, CO 2 application for heavy oil recovery in such condition is similar to C 3. The simulation results demonstrated that replacement of C 3 with CO 2 in the solvent mixtures has led to the recovery of the same amount of oil. This replacement has also caused a higher reduction in the heavy oil viscosity to obtain. Thus, CO 2 can be considered as a good alternative for C 3 in the VAPEX process specially for use in high pressure and temperature reservoirs. The outcomes from this research provide a new way for recovery of heavy oils by applying CO 2 as a <b>solvent</b> in <b>reservoirs</b> that have high pressure and temperature...|$|R

However, there exist numerous unknowns on the mutual interactions of <b>solvent</b> with steam, <b>reservoir</b> oil, and reservoir rock which affect the overall performance of the EOR method. Through an experimental approach, this study investigates the microscopic displacement efficiency of SSF for the extraction of Peace River bitumen. Two types of gas phase solvents were tested: hydrocarbon (propane) and nonhydrocarbon (carbon dioxide - CO 2). Propane was chosen for its good solubility in oil, whereas CO 2 was selected as an environmentally friendly option to decrease the project?s carbon footprint by re-injecting boiler combustion or associated gas. Solvent flooding (CO 2 flooding and propane flooding), steam-flooding, and SSF performances to extract Peace River bitumen were investigated with 12 one-dimensional core flooding experiments. Process performances were evaluated with cumulative oil recovery, sweep efficiency, produced oil and residual oil quality analyses. To investigate the effect of reservoir fines (clays), experiments were performed with and without clays on the reservoir rock. The phase behavior of the solvent-crudeasphaltene interactions was also studied by analyzing asphaltene precipitation. Finally, the impacts of varying the solvent flowrate were also studied. This research study suggests that CO 2 or propane insoluble fractions (asphaltenes) decrease permeability and increase oil viscosity during solvent flooding due to their interactions with clays. These problems are enhanced by solvent-steam co-injection, which also causes the formation of emulsions. Clay migration to oil phase during production is more significant for propane-steam co-injection. It is believed that the polar nature of asphaltenes is the reason behind the interactions with clays and water...|$|R

To achieve this goal, the regulations need to be reassessed {{in light of the}} development of new technologies. A currently rapidly growing new technology is nanotechnology, and engineered nanomaterials (ENM) are already produced and used in commercial products. The aim of this work was therefore to evaluate the current knowledge on human and ecotoxicology of ENM and their release and behavior in the environment in the context of major accident prevention. Nano-specific release paths are not to be expected. The established safety standards in the chemical industry are also applicable to ENM, especially the separate storage of flammable <b>solvents</b> and detention <b>reservoirs.</b> The potential of a release to the environment of ENM in powder form is larger than for suspensions; however, it can be minimized by safety measures established for conventional dusts. The considered human toxicology studies show that to date not conclusive enough answers regarding the toxicity of ENM can be made. The effects are dependent not only on the material itself but more on the functionalization, surface reactivity, size, and form. The acute ecotoxicity of ENM seems to be similar to the one of the corresponding microparticles (TiO 2) or the respective dissolved ions (Ag, Zn) with the exception of photocatalytically active nano-TiO 2, which has an increased toxicity. In order to guarantee that all ENM are included in the existing major accident regulations, different classification options are possible and the advantages and disadvantages are discussed. An important step will be the compulsory inclusion of nano-specific data in the Material Safety Data Sheets that serve as the basic medium to transfer information from the manufacturer to downstream users and authorities. We also call for a regular monitoring of the production and uses for ‘high production volume ENM’ that could have the largest implications for major accident regulations.|$|R

In this study, the addition of solvents to steam has been examined to reduce the energy intensity of the SAGD process. Higher oil recovery, accelerated oil production rate, reduced steam-to-oil ratio, and more favorable economics are expected from the addition of suitable hydrocarbon additives to steam. A systematic approach was used to develop an effective hybrid steam/solvent injection to improve the SAGD process. Initially, an extensive parametric simulation study was carried out to find the suitable hydrocarbon additives and injection strategies. Simulation studies aim to narrow down hybrid steam/solvent processes, design suitable solvent type and concentration, and explain the mechanism of solvent addition to steam. In the experimental phase, the most promising solvents (n-hexane and n-heptane) were used with different injection strategies. Steam and hydrocarbon additives were injected in continuous or alternating schemes. The results of the integrated experimental and simulation study were used to better understand the mechanism of hybrid steam/solvent processes. Experimental and simulation results show that solvent co-injection with steam leads to a process with higher oil production, better oil recovery, and less energy intensity with more favorable economy. Solvent choice for hybrid steam/solvent injection is not solely dependent on the mobility improvement capability of the <b>solvents</b> but also <b>reservoir</b> properties and operational conditions such as operating pressure and injection strategy. Pure heated solvent injection requires significant quantities. A vaporized solvent chamber is not sustainable due to low latent heat of the solvents. Alternating steam and solvent injection provides heat for the solvent cycles and increases oil recovery. Co-injection of small volumes (5 - 15 % by volume) of suitable solvents at the early times of the SAGD operation considerably improves the economics of the SAGD process...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Waterflooding has become standard practice for extending the productive life of many solution gas drive reservoirs, but has the disadvantage of leaving a substantial residual oil volume in the <b>reservoir.</b> <b>Solvent</b> flooding has been offered as a method whereby oil may be completely displaced from the reservoir, leaving no residual volume. Field results have demonstrated that solvent floods suffer from early solvent breakthrough and considerable oil by-passing owing to high solvent mobility. The injection of both water and solvent has been demonstrated to offer advantages. Water partially mitigates both the adverse mobility and high cost of solvent floods, while solvent mobilizes oil which would be left in the reservoir by water alone. The process is equally applicable to reservoirs currently at residual oil saturation (tertiary floods) and to reservoirs at maximum oil saturation (secondary floods). In stratified reservoirs high permeability layers may be preferentially swept by solvent floods, while low permeability layers may be scarcely swept at all. Presence or absence of transverse communication between layers can modify overall sweep efficiency. This work is a study of water-solvent injection in stratified reservoirs based on computer simulation results. Fractional oil recovery as a function of injected solvent fraction, permeability contrast between layers, initial oil saturation, and presence or absence of transverse communication between strata has been determined. Results are presented as a series of optimization curves. Permeability contrast between layers is shown to be the dominant control on fractional oil recovery. Transverse communicating reservoirs are shown to require a higher solvent-water ratio in order to attain recoveries comparable to transverse noncommunicating reservoirs. In actual field projects, water and solvent are injected alternately as discrete slugs. This process is known as "WAG" for "water-alternating-gas". In the simulations used in this study, continuous water-solvent injection at a fixed fraction rather than true WAG was employed. It is demonstrated that the two methods give equivalent results. In summary, this work is the first comprehensive study of the behavior of stratified reservoirs undergoing water-solvent injection...|$|R
40|$|Removal of CO 2 {{directly}} from anthropogenic sources (capture) and its disposal in geological formations {{can take place}} for medium-term time periods (storage), {{or it can be}} permanent (sequestration), with the CO 2 eventually becoming dissolved in the aqueous phase. The latter is the main subject of this dissertation. Carbon dioxide sequestration covers a wide range of strategies and alternatives. The main objective of CO 2 sequestration alternatives is secure disposal of carbon in large amounts and for a lengthy time scale (typically 1000 years). Injection of CO 2 into subsurface formations is generally considered as the main option for CO 2 sequestration. Geological sequestration through injection covers a broad variety of target formations: disposal in depleted oil and gas reservoirs, trapping in oil reservoirs, replacing CH 4 in coal bed methane recovery processes, trapping in deep aquifers, and salt cavern placement are the major CCS alternatives in geologic formations. In this thesis, hydrogeologic interaction between the injectant (CO 2) and the host fluid (saline water) during injection is the main subject of the project. Because of the density and viscosity contrast of displacing and displaced fluids, the pattern of saturation progression is complicated. A set of semi-analytical solutions is developed for quick estimation of the position of isosats (contours of saturation) during primary injection in homogenous cases with simple geometry. All of the mathematical solutions are developed based on two assumptions; incompressible fluids and rocks and vertical equilibrium (capillary-gravity condition) for geometries with large aspect ratio (L >> H). First, a series of analytical solutions for primary drainage for a set of linear relative permeability functions is developed. The first analytical solution {{is based on the assumption}} of locally linearized Leverett-J functions, and by using the method of characteristics, a formulation for the isosats’ geometry is obtained. A semi-analytical solution is then proposed for calculation of the position of isosats with linearized relative permeability functions and arbitrary capillary-saturation correlation. The analytical solution is extended to incorporate a specific form of nonlinearity of the relative permeability function. Nonlinear relative permeability functions are also incorporated in another semi-analytical solution, and the positions of the isosats for any arbitrary Leverett-J function and relative permeability functions are developed. Sequential gas-saline injection is also modeled in that chapter. For approximate verification of the analytical solutions, a FEM numerical model is developed and the results of the analytical solutions are compared with the numerical solutions. These new analytical solutions provide powerful tools for prediction of saturation distribution during injection in vertical and horizontal wells, as well as for carrying out stochastic assessments (Monte Carlo simulations) and parametric weight assessment. The domain of applications of the new solutions go far beyond the limited question of CO 2 sequestration: they can be used for injection of any less viscous fluid into a reservoir, whether the fluid is lighter or denser than the host fluid (gas injection, water-alternating gas injection, water injection into viscous oil <b>reservoirs,</b> <b>solvent</b> injection). 1 yea...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} vapor {{extraction}} (VAPEX) is a recovery process which targets the heavy oil and bitumen resources. Owing to high viscosity values for these unconventional types of oil, the recovery processes in such reserves are still challenging. The unconventional oil recovery processes usually include {{a mechanism for}} reducing the oil viscosity by means of heat, solvent, or both. The process of VAPEX utilizes the injection of a light hydrocarbon <b>solvent</b> into a <b>reservoir</b> for recovering the viscous oil in place by diffusing into the oil and by providing sufficient mobility to the oil upon dilution. Although this process {{offers a variety of}} advantages over the alternative thermal recovery processes such as SAGD or CSS, it suffers from two major drawbacks. First, the oil production rates obtained in the VAPEX process are considerably lower than those obtained in the thermal processes. Second, the solvent cost is considerably high. We tried to tackle these two problems during this research and we searched for potentials for an improved VAPEX process. Three potentially improved occurrences of a VAPEX project were found when: 1) the injected solvent was superheated, 2) the wettability of media was altered to oil-wet, and 3) the vugs were distributed in the porous media. Warm VAPEX process is introduced in which the VAPEX process is thermally augmented through superheating the solvent vapor. An attractive feature of this process is the capability of the solvent in being able to condense at the bitumen-solvent interface, which provides the opportunity for the bitumen to be upgraded in-situ through asphaltene precipitation. The asphaltene precipitation was not observed during the conventional vapor extraction process and was only observed during the warm VAPEX process. Upon a moderate level of superheating, the production rate of bitumen was sufficiently improved while the solvent content of the produced oil was significantly decreased as a result of decreased solubility of solvent in the oil at elevated temperatures. Therefore, more oil was produced at lower costs. The warm VAPEX experiments were conducted at 4 temperature levels in high and low permeability media using Cold Lake bitumen and Lloydminster heavy oil blend, n-pentane was used as solvent. The warm VAPEX process was found to be more effective for Cold Lake bitumen and for less permeable media. The potential of in-situ upgrading decreased when the level of superheating increased. The second potential for an improved VAPEX process obtained when the wettability of porous medium was altered to oil-wet conditions. Although this wettability condition is harmful to steam-based recovery processes, such as SAGD, it becomes beneficial to VAPEX. For the application of VAPEX process in fractionally wet media the wettability of glass beads was altered to oil-wet conditions through silylation process, and the VAPEX experiments were conducted in a random packing of water-wet and oil-wet beads of similar size at 7 different compositions. A substantial increase in the oil production rate was observed in a completely oil-wet medium, compared to the water-wet medium. By increasing the fraction of oil-wet beads in the packing up to a critical composition, the production rate of live oil increased linearly with the increase in the fraction of oil-wet beads in the packing during the vapor extraction process. Beyond this critical composition, however, the production rate of live oil did not change significantly with further increase in the fraction of the oil-wet beads in the randomly packed medium. Vugs were also found to be beneficial to the production performance of the VAPEX process. The presence of vugs was investigated in synthesized vugular media at 4 different levels of vuggy-to-total pore volume ratios. The performance of vugular media was compared to that of the homogeneous sintered media. The vugs facilitated the production of oil during the VAPEX process by providing flow communication between the vugs and the surrounding matrix, and therefore, by providing a local high permeability pathways towards the production well. A peak in the oil production rate was observed whenever a series of vugs were simultaneously invaded by the solvent vapor. The overall production rate of oil was higher in vuggy media compared to a homogeneous media at the same overall porosity and permeability. Furthermore, the magnitude of residual oil saturation left behind was also slightly lower in vuggy medium because the vugs were perfectly drained. Finally, a constant rate air injection (CRAI) porosimetry method was developed for characterization of vugs in a vugular media. This method was successfully tested in different synthetic vugular media, and the results illustrated higher accuracy in CRAI porosimetry method compared to constant rate mercury porosimetry. CRAI porosimetry method was also employed for identification of higher permeability regions embedded in a matrix of lower permeability. The analysis of a typical porosimetry signal was also modified...|$|R
