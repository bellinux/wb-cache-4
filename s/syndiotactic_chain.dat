40|$|The homochirality, or isotacticity, of {{the natural}} amino acids {{facilitates}} the formation of regular secondary structures such as α-helices and β-sheets. However, many examples exist in nature where novel polypeptide topologies use both l- and d-amino acids. In this study, we explore how stereochemistry of the polypeptide backbone influences basic properties such as compactness {{and the size of}} fold space by simulating both lattice and all-atom polypeptide chains. We formulate a rectangular lattice chain model in both two and three dimensions, where monomers are chiral, having the effect of restricting local conformation. <b>Syndiotactic</b> <b>chains</b> with alternating chirality of adjacent monomers have a very large ensemble of accessible conformations characterized predominantly by extended structures. Isotactic chains on the other hand, have far fewer possible conformations and a significant fraction of these are compact. <b>Syndiotactic</b> <b>chains</b> are often unable to access maximally compact states available to their isotactic counterparts of the same length. Similar features are observed in all-atom models of isotactic versus syndiotactic polyalanine. Our results suggest that protein isotacticity has evolved to increase the enthalpy of chain collapse by facilitating compact helical states and to reduce the entropic cost of folding by restricting the size of the unfolded ensemble of competing states...|$|R
40|$|A {{rotational}} {{isomeric state}} model with neighbor interactions {{is used to}} calculate mean‐square unperturbed dimensions and dipole moments for vinyl chloride chains CH 3 �(CHCl�CH 2 �) xHCH 3 �(CHCl�CH 2 �) xH having degrees of polymerization x ranging from 1 to 150 and stereochemical structures ranging from perfect syndiotacticity to perfect isotacticity. Conformational energies used in the calculation were those which had been established in an analysis based on the stereochemical equilibration of 2, 4 ‐dichloro‐n‐pentane by Flory and Williams. The calculations indicate that the dimensions of poly(vinyl chloride) chains of large x should decrease significantly with increasing isotacticity; this dependence of chain dimensions on stereochemical structure is the opposite of that calculated for vinyl chains having alkyl side groups, such as polypropylene. The dipole moments of poly(vinyl chloride) chains are also predicted to decrease with increasing isotacticity and both the dimensions and dipole moments are expected to decrease with increasing temperature, the largest dependence occurring in the case of perfectly <b>syndiotactic</b> <b>chains.</b> The marked differences in configurational characteristics of poly(vinyl chloride) and polypropylene chains are primarily due to the significant difference in size between Cl atoms and CH 3 groups; the electrostatic interactions present in poly(vinyl chloride) chains are of relatively minor importance. The predicted results for large x are in good agreement with published experimental results on poly(vinyl chloride) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{copolymerization}} of bio-renewable β-myrcene or β-farnesene with styrene {{was examined}} using an ansa-neodymocene catalyst, affording two series of copolymers with high styrene content and unprecedented syndioregularity of the polystyrene sequences.

40|$|Polymerization of gamma-butyrolactone {{has been}} studied in toluene with Al(OiPr) 3 as an initiator. The {{ring-opening}} polyaddition proceeds through a coordination-insertion mechanism at a very low rate. Well defined -isopropylester, -hydroxy poly(-butyrolactone) s (PBL) are formed with a narrow molecular weight distribution at low monomer-to-initiator molar ratios, When this ratio is higher (ca. 170), a competition occurs between propagation and side reactions, i. e. elimination, inter- and intra-molecular transesterifications and thermal degradation, {{which is responsible for}} a loss of control of the PBL molecular charcteristics. The addition of a Lewis base (1 equivalent of nicotine/Al) to the Al-alkoxide initiator has no significant effect on the polymerization rate, although the chain microstructure is deeply affected since predominantly <b>syndiotactic</b> PBL <b>chains</b> are formed (63 % syndio-diads) in contrast to a completely atactic polymer in the absence of nicotine.

40|$|Syndiotactic polystyrene/modified-clay nanocomposites {{have been}} {{prepared}} by solution blending by mixing pure s-PS and organophilic clay with adsorbed cetyl pyridium chloride (CPC) in dichlorobenzene. The dispersability of the clay in syndiotactic polystyrene/modified-clay nanocomposites was studied using X-ray and transmission electron microscopy. The clay is well dispersed into the s-PS matrix using solution blending with scale in 1 - 2 nm or in a few tenths similar to 100 nm depending on surfactant treatment. The CPC is partially compatible with s-PS and allows <b>syndiotactic</b> polystyrene <b>chains</b> intercalating into clay layers. The crystallization behavior of alpha- and beta -crystals for syndiotactic polystyrene nanocomposite has been thoroughly examined using the Fourier transform infrared and differential scanning calorimetry. Our results further demonstrate {{that the presence of}} the clay plays a vital role in facilitating the formation on the thermodynamically more favorable beta form crystal when the s-PS is melt- or cold-crystallized.

40|$|This paper {{discloses}} the DFT-computed pathways for chain propagation, chain transfer, {{and chain}} termination during carbene polymerization catalyzed by cationic Rcycloocta- 2, 6 -dien- 1 -yl) Rh-III(alkyl) ](+) species. In contrast to carbene polymerization calculated for neutral [(cod) Rh-I(alkyl) ](+) catalysts, chain propagation at the cationic [(cycloocta- 2, 6 -dien- 1 -yl) Rh-III(alkyl) ](+) species is clearly competitive with beta-hydride elimination, thus explaining {{the formation of}} high molecular weight polymers. Computed chain-end-controlled chain propagation reveals a clear preference for <b>syndiotactic</b> polymerization. <b>Chain</b> transfer involving alcohol-mediated protonolysis is computed {{to be a more}} favorable pathway than / 3 -hydride elimination. These results are all in agreement with experimental observations. Chain propagation from species with a stereoerror at the a-carbon atom of the growing chain is substantially slower compared to propagation from syndiotactic species without stereoerrors, providing a possible explanation for the experimentally observed low initiation efficiencies of the Rh catalysts in carbene polymerization reactions. These new computational insights, combined with experimental results disclosed in earlier reports, largely clarify the mechanism of Rh-mediated carbene polymerization reactions...|$|R
5000|$|Solid SeO2 is a {{one-dimensional}} polymer, {{the chain}} consisting of alternating selenium and oxygen atoms. Each Se atom is pyramidal and bears a terminal oxide group. The bridging Se-O bond lengths are 179 pm and the terminal Se-O distance is 162 pm. [...] The relative stereochemistry at Se alternates along the polymer <b>chain</b> (<b>syndiotactic).</b> In the gas phase selenium dioxide is present as dimers and other oligomeric species, at higher temperatures it is monomeric. The monomeric form adopts a bent structure {{very similar to}} that of sulfur dioxide with a bond length of 161 pm. The dimeric form has been isolated in a low temperature argon matrix and vibrational spectra indicate that it has a centrosymmetric chair form.

40|$|The {{miscibility}} {{of polypropylene}} (PP) melts {{in which the}} chains differ only in stereochemical composition has been investigated by two different procedures. One approach used detailed local information from a Monte Carlo simulation of a single chain, and the other approach takes this information from a rotational isomeric state model devised decades ago, for another purpose. The first approach uses PRISM theory to deduce the intermolecular packing in the polymer blend, while the second approach uses a Monte Carlo simulation of a coarse-grained representation of independent chains, expressed on a high-coordination lattice. Both approaches find a positive energy change upon mixing isotactic PP (iPP) and <b>syndiotactic</b> polypropylene (sPP) <b>chains</b> in the melt. This conclusion is qualitatively consistent with observations published recently by Muelhaupt and coworkers. The size of the energy chain on mixing is smaller in the MC/PRISM approach than in the RIS/MC simulation, with the smaller energy change being in better agreement with the experiment. The RIS/MC simulation finds no demixing for iPP and atactic polypropylene (aPP) in the melt, consistent with several experimental observations in the literature. The demixing of the iPP/sPP blend may arise from attractive interactions in the sPP melt that are disrupted when the sPP chains are diluted with aPP or iPP chains...|$|R
