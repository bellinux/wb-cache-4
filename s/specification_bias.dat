40|$|In many {{settings}} it {{is critical}} to accurately model the extreme tail behaviour of a random process. Non-parametric density estimation methods are commonly implemented as exploratory data analysis techniques for this purpose as they possess excellent visualisation properties, and can naturally avoid the model <b>specification</b> <b>biases</b> implied by using parametric estimators. In particular, kernel-based estimators place minimal assumptions on the data, and provide improved visualisation over scatterplots and histograms. However kernel density estimators are known to perform poorly when estimating extreme tail behaviour, which is important when interest is in process behaviour above some large threshold, and they can over-emphasise bumps in the density for heavy tailed data. In this article we develop a transformation kernel density estimator, and demonstrate that its mean integrated squared error (MISE) efficiency is equivalent to that of standard, non-tail focused kernel density estimators. Estimator performance is illustrated in numerical studies, and in an expanded analysis of the ability of well known global climate models to reproduce observed temperature extremes in Sydney, Australia...|$|R

We investigate the effects of real exchange-rate volatility on exports of ten EMEs and eleven other developing countries that were not classified as EMEs over our estimation period. We use panel-data sets that cover the periods 1980 :Q 1 - 2006 :Q 4 for the EMEs and 1980 :Q 1 - 2005 :Q 4 for the other developing countries. We use two estimation methods [...] generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation and time-varying-coefficient (TVC) estimation. The TVC procedure removes <b>specification</b> <b>biases</b> from the coefficients, revealing the underlying stable parameters of interest.

40|$|In this appendix, {{we design}} a Monte Carlo {{simulation}} {{to explore the}} properties of the estimator discussed in the paper. First, we compare the theoretical assumptions of our approach with other popular likelihood-based approaches for household data. We then compare the empirical properties of these approaches {{in the context of a}} Monte Carlo simulation. We find that our approach provides robust results across numerous potential price-generation mechanisms. This is an important finding since alternative approaches compared require very specific assumptions about the price-generation mechanism. As a result, these alternative approaches are more vulnerable to <b>specification</b> <b>biases.</b> We then focus on the proposed approach. We explore the importance of controlling for both en-dogeneity and heterogeneity in scanner data models. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we provide some evidence of biases that might arise if both sources of variation are not correctly accounted for. In par-ticular, we find that ignoring the endogeneity bias not only biases mean effects, it also has an impact on the variance in heterogeneity. In general, we find that the degree of heterogeneity in price sensitivity is over-stated. This upward bias is amplified if price-insensitive consumers also systematically do not shop when UBCs are high. 1 Comparison of Approache...|$|R
