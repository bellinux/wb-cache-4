40|$|To reduce soil erosion, {{soil and}} water {{conservation}} (SWC) methods are often used. However, no method exists to model beforehand how implementing such measures will affect erosion at catchment scale. A method was developed to simulate the effects of SWC measures with catchment scale erosion models. The method was implemented by applying the LISEM model to an agricultural catchment on the slopes of Mt. Kenya. The method consisted of a field scale calibration based on P-factors, followed by application at catchment scale. This calibration included factors such as saturated conductivity, Manning's n, roughness and slope angle. It was found that using data on P-factors, such models can be calibrated to give acceptable predictions at pixel scale. However, P-factors were also found to vary with land use type and storm size. Besides, more data on the physical effectiveness of SWC measures are needed. At catchment scale, the effect of SWC was found to be different from that at pixel scale. Most SWC were simulated to be more effective at catchment scale, indicating additional infiltration during transport through the catchment to the outlet. However, <b>slope</b> <b>corrections</b> in case of terraces were found to be less effective at this scale.

In deep water, the number of scatter pixels within the beam footprint {{is large enough to}} ensure Gaussian distributions for the backscatter strengths and to increase the discriminative power between acoustic classes. In very shallow water (< 10 ?m), however, this number is too small. This paper presents an extension of this high-frequency methodology for these environments, together with a demonstration of its performance using backscatter data from the river Waal, The Netherlands. The objective of this work is threefold. (i) Increasing the discriminating power of the classification method: high-resolution bathymetry data allow precise bottom <b>slope</b> <b>corrections</b> for obtaining the true incident angle, and the high-resolution backscatter data reduce the statistical fluctuations via an averaging procedure.

In addition, we evaluated those values in human bone marrow and liver, including a patient with liver steatosis. The actual fat fraction value was consistent with the fat fraction obtained with the double-GRE-FS method, and the calculated fat fraction was unaffected by the iron concentration. There was a strong positive correlation between R 2 * of the water component and the iron concentration. There was a negative correlation between the fat fraction and the bone mineral density, and the R 2 * was correlated with the bone mineral density. The calculated fat fraction in the liver steatosis patient was significantly higher than that in healthy volunteers. The double-GRE-FS makes it possible to assess the fat fraction and R 2 * simultaneously, and to obtain metabolic information on the liver and bone marrow. © 2014 Japanese Society of Radiological Technology and Japan Society of Medical Physics...|$|R

40|$|This article {{introduces}} {{an improved}} approach to Fowler-Nordheim (FN) plot analysis, {{based on a}} new type of intercept correction factor. This factor is more cleanly defined than the factor previously used. General enabling theory is given that applies to any type of FN plot of data that can be fitted using a FN-type equation. Practical use is limited to emission situations where <b>slope</b> <b>correction</b> factors can be reliably predicted. By making a series of well-defined assumptions and approximations, it is shown how the general formulas reduce to provide an improved theory of orthodox FN-plot data analysis. This applies to situations where the circuit current is fully controlled by the emitter characteristics, and tunneling can be treated as taking place through a Schottky-Nordheim (SN) barrier. For orthodox emission, good working formulas make numerical evaluation of the <b>slope</b> <b>correction</b> factor and the new intercept correction factor quick and straightforward. A numerical illustration, using simulated emission data, shows how to use this improved approach to derive values for parameters in the full FN-type equation for the SN barrier.
