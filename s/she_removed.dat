5|$|Thereafter, the thrall {{girl was}} taken away to the ship. <b>She</b> <b>removed</b> her bracelets and gave them to the old woman. Thereafter <b>she</b> <b>removed</b> her finger rings and gave them to the old woman's daughters, who had guarded her. Then they took her aboard the ship, {{but they did not}} allow her to enter the tent where the dead {{chieftain}} lay. The girl received several vessels of intoxicating drinks and she sang and bade her friends farewell.|$|E
5|$|Sayid {{escapes from}} Rousseau's bunker {{while she is}} gone, {{grabbing}} a rifle, maps and notes she has made about the island. Rousseau finds him {{and they have a}} standoff; he tries to fire the rifle, but no bullet discharges. Rousseau says <b>she</b> <b>removed</b> the firing pin, and Robert, her former lover, made the same mistake before she killed him. She reveals that it was she who killed her team, aiming to stop the disease from reaching the outside world. Sayid talks Rousseau into letting him go, but, before leaving, asks about Alex. Rousseau says that Alex was her child. While trying to find his way back to camp, Sayid hears the whispering of which Rousseau had spoken.|$|E
5|$|For a brief period, she dated David Flair (both {{on-screen}} and off), who {{was already}} involved in an on-screen relationship with Daffney. This led to Keibler's in-ring debut at the Bash at the Beach in a Wedding Gown match, which she lost after <b>she</b> <b>removed</b> her own gown. Hancock next briefly feuded with Kimberly Page, but the storyline ended abruptly when Page quit the company. Keibler and Flair then began a feud with the Misfits in Action stable, including a mud wrestling singles match against Major Gunns at New Blood Rising. During the match, she was kicked in the stomach, and she revealed herself to be pregnant the next night, beginning a new angle for herself and Flair. Two proposed endings to the storyline were for either Ric Flair or Vince Russo {{to be the father}} of her child. The angle, however, ended prematurely, as she revealed the pregnancy to be false, broke up with David Flair, and was taken off of television. When she returned, she was known by her real name on-screen.|$|E

5|$|Prior to 1989s release, Swift {{stressed}} the importance of albums to artists and fans. In November 2014, <b>she</b> <b>removed</b> her entire catalog from Spotify, arguing that the streaming company's ad-supported, free service undermined the premium service, which provides higher royalties for songwriters. In June 2015, Swift criticized Apple Music in an open letter for not offering royalties to artists during the streaming service's free three-month trial period and stated that she would pull 1989 from the catalog. The following day, Apple announced that it would pay artists during the free trial period, and Swift agreed to stream 1989 on the streaming service. Swift's intellectual property rights management and holding company, TAS Rights Management, filed for 73 trademarks related to the singer and the 1989 era memes. She re-added her entire catalog to Spotify, Amazon Music and Google Play in June 2017.|$|E
25|$|For {{four years}} she resided at Tuscumbia, devoting {{her life to}} rearing her son, North Overton, and to an active {{literary}} career. <b>She</b> <b>removed</b> to Arkansas, 1868, {{and was the first}} woman elected to membership in the State press association. Later <b>she</b> <b>removed</b> to Washington, D. C., where for more than 30 years she was engaged in general literary work. She was one of the charter members of the Daughters of the American Revolution, and belonged to other patriotic and literary organizations.|$|E
25|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the 2006 U.S. Women's Open, in which she finished tied for 57th, she retired from competitive golf; as a symbol of her departure <b>she</b> <b>removed</b> her golf shoes, visor, and glove and placed them {{on the side of the}} 18th green.|$|E

25|$|On 14 October 1997, Queen Elizabeth II visited Jallianwala Bagh {{and paid}} her respects with a 30‑second moment of silence. During the visit, {{she wore a}} dress of a colour {{described}} as pink apricot or saffron, which was of religious significance to the Sikhs. <b>She</b> <b>removed</b> her shoes while visiting the monument and laid a wreath at the monument.|$|E
25|$|She {{took part}} {{in some of the}} later poetry performances. On one such {{occasion}} at the Gravesend Adult Education Centre (Victoria Centre) she walked onto the stage in a mac. After a period of indecision, <b>she</b> <b>removed</b> it to reveal a pink basque and stockings, and read out poems by Childish, who in the meantime had fled from the room.|$|E
25|$|Her boyfriend Jack {{encouraged}} her to apply for jobs as a dancer, and in 1991, though underage, she began dancing in Las Vegas strip clubs using a fake identification.

After six months, she was earning US$2,000 per night, before graduating from Bonanza High School.|$|E

25|$|During {{the cruise}} to Japan, Alice {{jumped into the}} ship's pool fully clothed, and coaxed Congressman Longworth to join her in the water. (Years later Bobby Kennedy would chide her about the incident, saying it was {{outrageous}} for the time, to which the by-then-octogenarian Alice replied that it would only have been outrageous had <b>she</b> <b>removed</b> her clothes.) In her autobiography, Crowded Hours, Alice made note of the event, pointing {{out that there was}} little difference between the linen skirt and blouse she had been wearing and a lady's swimsuit of the period.|$|E
25|$|The police, Aboriginal {{trackers}} {{and others}} watched the surrounded hotel throughout the night. At about 5 {{o'clock in the}} morning the landlady, Mrs Jones, began loudly wailing over the fate of her son, who {{had been shot in the}} back. She came out from the hotel crying bitterly and wandered into the bush on several occasions. With the assistance of one of the prisoners <b>she</b> <b>removed</b> her son from the building, and sent him to Wangaratta for treatment. The firing continued intermittently. Bullets lodged in the station buildings and the train.|$|E
25|$|Dann was {{prevented}} from leaving the area by car because {{the roads were}} closed for a funeral cortege. She decided to drive her car backwards down the nearby street, but the road dead-ended into a private drive. Abandoning her car, <b>she</b> <b>removed</b> her bloodstained shorts and tied a blue garbage bag around her waist. With her two remaining guns {{she made her way}} through the woods and came upon the house of the Andrew family. Dann entered the house and met a mother and her twenty-year-old son, who were in the kitchen. She claimed she was raped and had shot the rapist in the struggle.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, Melisandre, who {{has been}} sullen {{following}} Stannis's defeat and Jon's death, goes to sleep in her bedroom. As <b>she</b> undresses, <b>she</b> <b>removes</b> her ruby necklace to reveal a physical body many {{years older than she}} appears to be.|$|R

5000|$|When Chan {{comes on}} stage, she moves subtly, gently swaying {{in a slow}} dance, all by herself. As <b>she</b> <b>removes</b> one piece of {{clothing}} after another, the tempo gradually picks up. When she reaches the point of <b>removing</b> her brassiere, <b>she</b> holds back. That is when her stagehands bring in the pythons, and she dances with the snakes wrapped all around her. Next, <b>she</b> <b>removes</b> her brassiere, and dances bare-breasted. After a while, the snakes are <b>removed.</b> <b>She</b> then approaches the people sitting nearest to the stage, who are normally the elderly big towkays (Hokkien: business owner). She takes an old man's spectacles, rubs it against her private parts, and then gives it back to him. Some of her acts are very crude.

25|$|At {{the time}} of Bate Tichenor's move to Mexico in 1953, she began what would become a {{lifetime}} journey through her art and mysticism, inspired by her belief in ancestral spirits, to achieve self-realization. While painting alone and in isolation, <b>she</b> <b>removed</b> her familiar and societal masks to find her own personal human and spiritual identities; she would then reposition those hidden identities with new masks and characters in her paintings that represented her own sacred beliefs and truths. This guarded internal process of self-discovery and fulfillment was allegorically portrayed with a cast of mythological characters engaged in magical settings. She painted a dramatization of her own life and quests on canvas through an expressive visual language and an artistic vocabulary that she kept secret.|$|E
25|$|Hastings {{is today}} {{strongly}} associated with Poirot, due more to {{the changes in the}} television adaptations compared to the novels. Many of the early TV episodes of Agatha Christie's Poirot were adaptations of short stories, in most of which he appeared in print. A few were stories into which he had been adapted (e.g. Murder in the Mews). In Christie's original writings, however, Hastings is not in every short story or novel. He is not a character in either Death on the Nile or Murder on the Orient Express, the two best-known Poirot novels. Of the twenty-two Poirot novels published between 1920 and 1937, he appears in seven. Moreover, when Christie expanded The Submarine Plans (1923) as The Incredible Theft (1937), <b>she</b> <b>removed</b> Hastings.|$|E
25|$|After captain Alex Blackwell {{elected to}} bat, but New Zealand started more effectively. Their opening fast bowler Nicola Browne bowled her quota of four overs {{straight}} through, taking 2/11. <b>She</b> <b>removed</b> opener Elyse Villani, for six, caught at cover. Blackwell was then out for 0, cutting {{into the hands}} of Devine in the gully. Shelley Nitschke had earlier been trapped leg before wicket by Sian Ruck for three. This was following by a partnership of 30 between Leah Poulton and Jess Cameron, but they were unable to lift the run rate substantially; their stand took 45 balls. Poulton was out trying to loft a ball over cover, and two balls later, Cameron was bowled from Kate Broadmore's first ball, leaving Australia at 5/51 in the 13th over. Only Poulton managed a solitary boundary. Wicket-keeper Alyssa Healy scored 10 from as many balls, but was then run out attempting a second run after being dropped by Sara McGlashan.|$|E

25|$|Marie de Romieu’s {{discourse}} is closely based {{on part of}} a 1554 work by Charles Estienne, titled Paradoxes, which are notions contrary to the common opinion. Estienne’s work, in turn, was itself based on Paradoxes, a work by Italian humanist author Ortensio Lando. Lando’s piece was mainly a list of “exemplary ladies”, while Estienne builds onto that by omitting some Italian names and adding some French ladies to it. De Romieu, however, took it further. She follows Estienne’s prose, adding women she thought were deserving of praise. She paid {{special attention to the}} role of educated women, especially her contemporary female poets, praising in her Discourse other French female writers, such as Catherine de Clermont, Marguerite de Navarre, and Madeleine and Catherine des Roches. Notably, <b>she</b> <b>removed</b> the names of women who were entirely devoted to serving their husbands, as well as women who attempted to hide their accomplishments from public view.|$|E
25|$|There is {{considerable}} speculation {{as to the}} actual paternity of Paul I. It is suggested {{that he was not}} Peter's son at all, but that his mother had engaged in an affair—to which Elizabeth had consented—with a young officer named Sergei Vasilievich Saltykov, and that he was Paul's real father. In any case Peter never gave any indication that he believed Paul to have been fathered by anyone but himself. He also did not take any interest in parenthood. Elizabeth though most certainly took an active interest. <b>She</b> <b>removed</b> the young Paul and acted as if she were his mother and not Catherine. The Empress had ordered the midwife to take the baby and to follow her. Catherine was not to see her child for another month and then on the second time briefly for the churching ceremony. Six months later Elizabeth let Catherine see the child again. The child had in effect become a ward of the state and in a larger sense, the property of the state, to be brought up by Elizabeth as she believed he should be — as a true heir and great-grandson of her father, Peter the Great.|$|E
25|$|Brooks {{was said}} to prefer butter over clay as a molding medium. The latter had to kept moist and wrapped {{to prevent it from}} cracking, was not as {{sensitive}} for sculptural manipulation, and was more difficult to cast. Brooks had conquered the major disadvantage of butter simply by using ice. She discovered that she could even use butter for casting. After preserving her original butter Dreaming Iolanthe for a half a year, she desired a method which would not require keeping it in cold storage. Without knowing ahead of time what the results may be, she mixed up some plaster and poured it onto the butter sculpture. The plaster quickly set, and she cut a hole {{in the bottom of the}} milk pan which held her creation. Brooks then set the pan over a container of boiling water, and the butter melted and drained out of the hole. <b>She</b> <b>removed</b> the remainder of the bottom of the pan, and was left with a greased plaster negative. She placed more plaster inside and, after some difficulty removing the outer layer, was left with a successful plaster positive. Brooks was issued a patent in 1877 for her process of creating lubricated plaster molds. She did not, however, use plaster casts to reproduce her butter sculptures, instead preferring to sculpt a new one for each exhibit.|$|E
50|$|After the {{publication}} of the Bringing them Home report in 1997, she said she preferred the word 'removed' from the word 'stolen' for her personal situation. She was the youngest child in her family, and was two years old when <b>she</b> was <b>removed</b> from her mother. After <b>she</b> was <b>removed,</b> <b>she</b> did not see her mother again for 33 years. During that time, her mother did not know where her family had been taken.|$|R

25|$|The {{structural}} {{arrangement of}} the home is also redefined by Gilman. <b>She</b> <b>removes</b> the kitchen from the home leaving rooms to be arranged and extended in any form and freeing women from the provision of meals in the home.
