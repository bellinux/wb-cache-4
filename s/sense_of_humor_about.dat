The participants were 147 Introductory Psychology students from Ball State University. Participants first took the Situational Humor Response Questionnaire (SHRQ: Martin & Lefcourt, 1984), then observed 1 of 3 videos (i. e., sad, neutral, or humorous), which was then followed by the Coping with Humor Scale (CHS: Martin & Lefcourt, 1983) and the Multiple Affect Adjective Check List (MAACL: Zuckerman & Lubin, 1965). The results indicate that <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> is inversely related to depression and hostility regardless of video condition but not with anxiety. Low <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> participants were influenced greatly {{as a function of}} the video condition but the high <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> paticipants were not. High <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> paticipants used humor to cope more than the low <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> participants in the sad video condition.
