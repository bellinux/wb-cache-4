25|$|In third grade, Warhol had Sydenham's chorea (also {{known as}} St. Vitus' Dance), {{the nervous system}} disease that causes {{involuntary}} movements of the extremities, which {{is believed to be}} a complication of scarlet fever which causes skin pigmentation blotchiness. He became a hypochondriac, developing a fear of hospitals and doctors. Often bedridden as a child, he became an outcast at school and bonded with his mother. At times when he was confined to bed, he drew, listened to the radio and collected pictures of movie stars around his bed. Warhol later described this period as very important in the development of his personality, <b>skill-set</b> and preferences. When Warhol was 13, his father died in an accident.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} outlets {{expressed}} disappointment at the penalty shoot-out, {{in particular the}} way that Martin Williams, who as a flanker who would not ordinarily take a kick at goal, had been to [...] "blame" [...] for Cardiff's loss. The Guardians Paul Rees expressed the opinion that asking forwards to take kicks at goal [...] "is demanding something not only unnatural but untried and it turned a rousing semi-final into a pantomime, an unnecessarily demeaning way of settling the issue." [...] Brendan Gallagher writing in The Daily Telegraph noted that {{only three or four}} players on a rugby team would kick the ball during a match in a meaningful way, and said it was [...] "ludicrous that a game should be decided by emphasising that particular skill". He also questioned what would have happened in the event the shoot-out continued and the game been decided between props Martin Castrogiovanni and Gethin Jenkins, both considered amongst the finest players in their position but never ordinarily being required to kick the ball at goal. Chris Hewett expressed similar views in The Independent, observing that Martyn Williams [...] "lost the game by failing to perform a task outside the <b>skill-set</b> of the majority of players" [...] and commenting that [...] "short of asking a cat to bark, {{it is hard to imagine}} anything more preposterous." ...|$|E

Chris Dart of Exclaim! said, [...] "It's also a smart, fun, eclectic record full of psychedelic influences and great, massive choruses." [...] Steve Jones of USA Today said, [...] "Scott Mescudi handles {{the production of}} his third album, creating moody, surreal soundscapes to bolster rhymes that run the gamut of emotions. But whether he's feeling invincible or despondent, you get a true sense of where his head's at." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic stated, [...] "It's an entertaining, vibrant, and artistically filling album, so consider it a [...] "presents" [...] effort and enjoy the show." [...] Mosi Reeves of Spin said, [...] "None of the guest actors here distract from Cudi's signature self-mythologizing and inner turmoil. And most of the time, it's his inner turmoil that beckons you in, rather than merely pushing you out." [...] Dan Buyanovsky of XXL stated, [...] "As a whole, Cudi’s version of 2001 is an original and bold project [...] This ambitious project does not fall flat, and credit is due to Cudi for continuing to challenge himself post-WZRD, taking on a new <b>skill-set</b> and concept rather than throwing together a collection of identically moody anthems." ...|$|E

[...] Significant expansion of railroads in the 1880s lead to a surge of those employed on the railway lines, including engine drivers, station masters and staff, clerks, labourers and gangers. These workers soon organized themselves into employees’ associations and craft unions (i.e. unions representing workers of a particular <b>skill-set</b> or grade, often within the same industry).|$|E

2500|$|Lewis was {{a classic}} up-right boxer, who beat opponents from the outside with his {{dominant}} 84" [...] reach. His jab, which was often a pawing shot early in his career, became a formidable weapon {{under the tutelage of}} Emmanuel Steward, which Lewis used to set up his signature punch, the straight right hand. Under Steward, Lewis became less-reliant on his right hand and displayed a more complete <b>skill-set.</b> Criticized at times for being too patient and for his lack of in-fighting skills, Lewis was at his most effective when boxing from range. Known for his physical strength, Lewis was able to maneuver opponents into punching range and was especially effective against taller opponents. While lacking the natural fluidity of his great rival, Riddick Bowe, Lewis eventually developed {{into one of the most}} complete heavyweights in history; able to box at range or fight aggressively when necessary, as well as being considered one of the hardest punchers of all-time.|$|E

40|$|Information Technology (IT) now plays {{a central}} role in almost all aspects of business. However to best realise the {{potential}} of IT, it is vital that educators adopt strategies that challenge rather than reinforce existing disciplinary divides in IT education and business. This paper supports the application of active learning, via the use of a serial teaching case, towards bridging disciplinary divides in IT education. Specifically, the case calls for the design, development and implementation of an Integrated Management Information System. Students are therefore required to demonstrate analytical as well as technical <b>skill-sets</b> in the areas of IT, accounting and business. The paper describes the business context facing AHN Ltd. and illustrates the pedagogic use of the case as a means of integrating IT with aspects of accounting and business knowledge, towards helping educators contribute to answering the calls from academia (Panko, 2008) and industry (Chan and Reich, 2007) for graduates with a hybrid of business and IT <b>skill-sets...</b>|$|R
