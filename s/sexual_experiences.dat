5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{is growing}} {{increasingly}} jealous of Gabe's relationship with Erin. While observing Gabe's room, Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) {{tells him that}} a Chinese virility supplement that Gabe keeps in his room is incredibly potent. Once alone Andy drinks the entire bottle of the supplement, which makes him intoxicated, prompting him to admit his jealousy to Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith). Phyllis volunteers to talk to Erin and find out if she is having sex with Gabe, but as Phyllis is fairly intoxicated herself, her inquiries segue into an explicit account of her <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences</b> with her husband Bob, which mortifies Erin. Andy's intoxication turns into sickness, and he ultimately retreats to Gabe's room and vomits on the bed.|$|E
5|$|Not only do {{they affect}} injured people's self-image, these {{stereotypes}} are particularly harmful when held by counselors and professionals involved in rehabilitation. Caregivers affected by these culturally transmitted beliefs may treat their patients as asexual, particularly if the injury occurred {{at a young age}} and the patient never had <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences.</b> Failure to recognize injured people's sexual and reproductive capacity restricts their access to birth control, information about sexuality, and sexual health-related medical care such as annual gynecological exams. Another common belief that affects sexual rehabilitation is that sex is strictly about genital function; this could cause caregivers to discount the importance {{of the rest of the}} body and of the individual.|$|E

5|$|The most {{extensive}} early study of female homosexuality {{was provided by}} the Institute for Sex Research, who published an in-depth report of the <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences</b> of American women in 1953. More than 8,000 women were interviewed by Alfred Kinsey and the staff of the Institute for Sex Research in a book titled Sexual Behavior in the Human Female, popularly known as part of the Kinsey Report. The Kinsey Report's dispassionate discussion of homosexuality as a form of human sexual behavior was revolutionary. Up to this study, only physicians and psychiatrists studied sexual behavior, and almost always the results were interpreted with a moral view.|$|E
5|$|Homosexual men {{tended to}} have had their first {{homosexual}} encounter at a younger age, {{and were more likely}} to have their first encounters with friends or acquaintances rather than strangers. The data did not support the idea that homosexual males are likely to have been seduced by older men. Homosexual activity involving genital contact in childhood was connected to adult homosexuality, though only weakly; homosexual arousal during childhood or adolescence was a stronger predictor of adult homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during childhood was a moderate predictor of adult heterosexuality. Phenomena associated with sexual maturation, such as the age of first ejaculation, did not seem to be important, and neither did parental attitudes toward sex. Respondents' opportunities to engage in sex with persons of the opposite or the same sex did not seem to be an important influence on the sexual preference they developed, and <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences</b> with persons of both the same and the opposite sex were common among both homosexuals and heterosexuals. Sexual feelings appeared to be more important than sexual behavior as an indicator of adult sexual preference.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This study {{examined}} the longitudinal relationship between sexual media consumption, <b>sexual</b> <b>experience</b> and <b>sexual</b> satisfaction among adolescents. First, I expected that the more an adolescent consumed sexual media content, the more real life <b>sexual</b> <b>experience</b> {{he or she would}} have. Second, I expected that the more adolescents consumed sexual media content, the less sexual satisfaction they would report. Third, I expected to find a moderating effect of gender, in that both main effects would be stronger for boys than for girls. I analysed four-wave data of 494 Dutch adolescents {{with a mean age of}} 14. 5 years at baseline. I performed hierarchical multiple regression analyses to establish if sexual media consumption could predict subsequent levels of <b>sexual</b> <b>experience</b> and <b>sexual</b> satisfaction over time. In line with the first hypothesis, results showed that the more sexual media adolescents consumed at baseline, the more <b>sexual</b> <b>experience</b> they had six months and one year later. At the same time however, results showed that sexual media consumption did not predict subsequent levels of sexual satisfaction across waves. Rejecting the third hypothesis, gender did not interact with sexual media consumption. Therefore, the relationship between sexual media consumption and <b>sexual</b> <b>experience</b> and <b>sexual</b> satisfaction was the same for male and female adolescents...|$|R
40|$|Aversive {{stressful}} {{experiences are}} {{typically associated with}} increased anxiety and a predisposition to develop mood disorders. Negative stress also suppresses adult neurogenesis and restricts dendritic architecture in the hippocampus, a brain region associated with anxiety regulation. The effects of aversive stress on hippocampal structure and function {{have been linked to}} stress-induced elevations in glucocorticoids. Normalizing corticosterone levels prevents some of the deleterious consequences of stress, including increased anxiety and suppressed structural plasticity in the hippocampus. Here we examined whether a rewarding stressor, namely <b>sexual</b> <b>experience,</b> also adversely affects hippocampal structure and function in adult rats. Adult male rats were exposed to a sexually-receptive female once (acute) or once daily for 14 consecutive days (chronic) and levels of circulating glucocorticoids were measured. Separate cohorts of sexually experienced rats were injected with the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine in order to measure cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the hippocampus. In addition, brains were processed using Golgi impregnation to assess the effects of <b>sexual</b> <b>experience</b> on dendritic spines and dendritic complexity in the hippocampus. Finally, to evaluate whether <b>sexual</b> <b>experience</b> alters hippocampal function, rats were tested on two tests of anxiety-like behavior: novelty suppressed feeding and the elevated plus maze. We found that acute <b>sexual</b> <b>experience</b> increased circulating corticosterone levels and the number of new neurons in the hippocampus. Chronic <b>sexual</b> <b>experience</b> no longer produced an increase in corticosteron...|$|R

25|$|Developing {{a sexual}} {{self-concept}} {{is an important}} developmental step during adolescence. This is when adolescents {{try to make sense}} and organize their <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences</b> so that they understand the structures and underlying motivations for their sexual behavior. This sexual self-concept helps adolescents organize their past experiences, but also gives them information to draw on for their current and future sexual thoughts and experiences. Sexual self-concept affects sexual behavior for both men and women, but it also affects relationship development for women. Development of one’s sexual self-concept can occur even before <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences</b> begin. An important part of sexual self-concept is sexual esteem, which includes how one evaluates their sexuality (including their thoughts, emotions and sexual activities). Another aspect is sexual anxiety; this includes one’s negative evaluations of sex and sexuality. Sexual self-concept is not only developed from sexual experiences; both girls and boys can learn from a variety of social interactions such as their family, sexual education programs, depictions in the media and from their friends and peers. Girls with a positive self-schema {{are more likely to be}} liberal in their attitudes about sex, are more likely to view themselves as passionate and open to sexual experience and are more likely to rate <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences</b> as positive. Their views towards relationships show that they place high importance on romance, love and intimacy. Girls who have a more negative view often say they feel self-conscious about their sexuality and view sexual encounters more negatively. The sexual self-concept of girls with more negative views are highly influenced by other people; those of girls who hold more positive views are less so.|$|E

40|$|Parent-child {{sexual health}} {{communication}} {{has been shown}} to protect against adolescent sexual risk-taking behavior.

To investigate this question, parent-child dyads (N =  942) from a U. S. nationally-representative internet panel were surveyed in June 2012. Agreement between adolescent report of vaginal sex and parent's knowledge of such behavior was assessed. Multivariate regression was used to assess predictors of accurate parental knowledge of adolescent sex. Most parents (87 %) reported knowledge of their adolescents' <b>sexual</b> <b>experience.</b> Parents with accurate knowledge of adolescent <b>sexual</b> <b>experience</b> {{were more likely to report}} at least one prior conversation with their child about sexual health (OR 2. 35), have a daughter (OR 1. 88), and have a child who expressed comfort discussing sexual health (OR 1. 71).

25|$|The {{results of}} a study by Deborah Tolman and her colleagues {{indicated}} that adolescent exposure to sexuality on television in general does not directly affect their sexual behaviors, rather it {{is the type of}} message they view that has the most impact. Gender stereotypes enacted in sexual scenes on TV were seen to have a large affect on adolescents. Girls felt they had less control over their sexuality when they saw men objectifying women and not valuing commitment. The study discussed the risk of women internalizing this message and spreading the idea that it is okay to be weak and answer to men all the time. However, girls who saw women on TV who refuted men’s sexual advances usually felt more comfortable talking about their own sexual needs in their <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences</b> as well as standing up for themselves. They were comfortable setting sexual limits and therefore held more control over their sexuality. Findings for boys were less clear; those who saw dominant and aggressive men actually had less <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{non-human}} primates, {{it may be}} that testosterone in puberty stimulates sexual arousal, {{which allows}} the primate to increasingly seek out <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences</b> with females and thus creates a sexual preference for females.

25|$|Obtaining precise {{number is}} {{difficult}} {{for a variety of}} reasons. One of the major reasons for the difference in statistical findings regarding homosexuality and bisexuality {{has to do with the}} nature of the research questions. Major research studies on sexual orientation are discussed. Most of the studies listed below rely on self-report data, which poses challenges to researchers inquiring into sensitive subject matter. More importantly, the studies tend to pose two sets of questions. One set examines self-report data of same-sex <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences</b> and attractions while the other set examines self-report data of personal identification as homosexual or bisexual. Fewer research subjects identify as homosexual or bisexual than report having had <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences</b> or attraction to a person of the same sex. Several studies of sexual orientation in countries provide comparative perspectives. Tables comparing several U.S. cities' population numbers are also included. However, since many individuals may fail to report outside the heterosexual norm or define their sexuality in their own unique terms, it is difficult to fully grasp the size of the LGBT population. The type of survey being used and the type of setting a subject is in while being surveyed may also affect the answer that the subject gives.|$|E

40|$|Sexual {{health is}} related to <b>sexual</b> <b>experience</b> and the {{accurate}} understanding of HIV and STIs modes of transmission, symptoms, and prevention. An examination {{of the influence of}} sociocultural factors provides a greater understanding of the determinants of sexual health given that sexual conduct is socially and culturally constructed. Consequently, this study sought to examine the influence of acculturation as it related to identity, behaviours and values, and the effects of religiosity and perceived discrimination in Haitian-Canadian, Franco-Ontarian and Anglo-Canadian emerging adults on their level of <b>sexual</b> <b>experience</b> and knowledge of HIV and STIs. The results indicated that Haitian-Canadians were the least sexually experienced group. Haitian-Canadian women in particular, were less experienced than Franco-Ontarian and Anglo-Canadian young women. The three groups did not differ in their level of knowledge regarding HIV. Yet, Anglo-Canadians were the most knowledgeable regarding STIs, followed by Franco-Ontarians. The level of religiosity experienced by participants was the only significant predictor related to <b>sexual</b> <b>experience</b> for all three groups. More religiosity predicted less <b>sexual</b> <b>experience.</b> Furthermore, greater religiosity also predicted less knowledge of HIV for Franco-Ontarians. These findings suggest that more specific measures regarding sexual norms and values should be used to examine sexual acculturation...|$|R

25|$|Another {{influence}} on the perception of student sexuality is school culture, as illustrated by Louisa Allen’s study “Denying the Sexual Subject: Schools' Regulation of Student Sexuality.” This study outlines how school culture can lead students to perceive themselves as having varying levels of sexual agency based on gender while also creating a normalized sexuality {{similar to that in}} the Bay-Cheng study. Regardless of the material included in the curricula of school based sex education, the general attitude surrounding sex within individual schools can influence the ways students think about their own sexuality and <b>sexual</b> <b>experiences.</b>|$|E
