40|$|Abstract: Manual pump now a day {{popular among}} small and {{marginal}} farmers of Bangladesh. Amid the manual pumps the farmers predominantly use treadle pumps. It was found from study {{that the present}} structural design, {{the operation of the}} pump is tedious {{and at the same time}} very ineffective, which needs necessary modifications. An improved version of treadle pump called pedal pump was designed and fabricated at Agricultural Engineering Division, Bangladesh Sugarcane Research Institute (BSRI), Ishurdi, Pabna, which is by-cycle operated, comfortable to operate, capable of lifting surface and sub-surface water having discharge range from 60 - 100 litres per minute at different <b>suction</b> <b>heads</b> (up to 7 meters). Before going to large-scale production it was needed to know the response of the farmers towards use of pedal pump. The objective of the study was to assess the socio-economic profile of the pedal pump users and to determine the adaptability of the pedal pump by the farmers as perceived by them. For demonstration of pedal pump 12 demonstrated and 120 non-demonstrated farmers were selected at Pabna, Thakurgaon and Chuadanga district of Bangladesh. Demonstration farmers have smaller land holding (0. 47 ha) and higher number of family size (8 Nos.) compared to non-demonstration farmers.

30|$|The {{experimental}} setup so assembled {{was successful}} in creating a system by which {{the performance of the}} jet pump was characterized at different angles of placement and depth. To enable this, unique fixture is designed. The stress of the work is on experimental setup for performance evaluation of a jet pump where in practical field it is difficult to make such an analysis. The success of work lies in creating a system of arrangement through which influence of varying angle of placement and depth is evaluated. The range of variation of flow at vertical position to horizontal position changed the discharge flow rate from 0.308 to 0.252  l/s which is order of 22 % increase. The efficiency was a maximum of 46 % when jet pump was placed vertically. It dropped to 42 % at 45 ° when placed at greater depth. When there was 15 % decrease in discharge pressure, there was around 10 % decrease in the flow rate. The above variations are calculated at constant operating injection flow rates. The facility so generated can be used for future research work on various aspects of jet pump by experimentation. This study presents two interesting outcomes as a result of testing the influence of angle of placement and depth over jet pump: at constant depth jet pump works better at vertical position but when it is under the influence of both depth and angle of placement, incline position is better once flow is commenced. It is also being an experimental experience that jet pump performance is a function of valve seating design and active pressure control is expected to work better than the gravity and buoyancy settled valve. At shallow depth, jet pump is expected to perform better and the maximum limit for immersion will be checked against vapour pressure for the working fluid. The experimental aspect of the setup developed is expected to be extensible used for future work and create snow ball effect in terms of the arrangement for varying angle of the placement and depth. The authors propose that further research can be carried out by varying the angle of placement and depth for the following parameters: different nozzle angles, different chambers shapes, varying diameters, area ratio and positive and negative <b>suction</b> <b>heads</b> (Hammoud 2006).|$|R

The test goals include verification of suction performance against heritage J- 2 S data, head production, effects of thermodynamic suppression head (TSH), and evaluation of the inducer dynamic pressure caused by cavitation instabilities. Test facilities at both Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne (PWR) and NASA s Stennis Space Center (SSC) are employed for the testing. The inducer only water test effort conducted at PWR established performance curves for <b>suction</b> performance, <b>head</b> production, and efficiency over a wide operating range.

50|$|Beside high {{mechanical}} energy, higher cleaning {{temperatures are}} one of the most effective methods of improving the cleaning results in a parts washer. In general, a 10 to 15 °F (5 to 8 °C) rise doubles the chemical reaction of the detergent. The increased chemical reaction between the greases and oils and the detergent delivers faster cleaning cycles and cleaner parts. Additionally, all greases and oils exhibit a lower viscosity at higher temperatures. Cleaning solution temperatures of 170 F and above softens or melts most oils and greases causing them to flow like water so they are easily removed resulting in faster cleaning, better results and cleaner parts. Many parts washers are not capable of maintaining this operating temperature due to the lack of amply heating systems. Additionally, careful design is required of the pumping system so it can pull in and deliver cleaning solution at temperatures that approach boiling in the parts washer. All centrifugal pumps require a net positive <b>suction</b> <b>head</b> (NPSHr) in order to be able to pump solution. As the temperature of the solution approaches the NPSHr, the pump stops pumping because the cleaning solution flashes to steam in the pump intake. Careful design of the pump is required to minimize NPSHr and allow pumping of high temperature cleaning solution.|$|E
50|$|A {{circulating}} pump - {{a device that}} causes the flow of liquid (e.g. water or aqueous solutions, mostly glycol) in circuits (primary or secondary) of heating or cooling installations. The {{circulating pump}}s are used only as centrifugal pumps. The basic elements of the centrifugal pump are coiled housing with two ports, suction and discharge, and what is more, blade rotor mounted on a shaft driven be an electric motor. The ports of the circulating pump can be arranged in one axis (in-line circulating pump, typically suitable to be built directly in the pipeline) or suction axis that can be perpendicular to the axis of discharge port (the so-called circulating radial pump). The mechanical energy delivered to the circulating pump via motor is transmitted through the rotor to the liquid flow causing the increase in pressure (potential energy) and speed (kinetic energy). The energy increase of the liquid occurs only in the circulating pump rotor, {{which is the only}} element of the energy transmission. However, in the remaining parts, one type of energy changes into another e.g. kinetic energy into pressure energy. For instance, in the coiled shaped housing, part of kinetic energy changes into potential energy, which causes a further increase in the fluid pressure.Pressure generated by the pump is used to overcome resistance of the liquid flow through the heating or cooling circuit. During the pump operation, there is a drop of the liquid flow {{in the center of the}} rotor, causing the inflow of the liquid through the suction port. In the event of an excessive pressure decrease, in some parts of the rotor, the pressure can be lower than the saturation pressure corresponding to the temperature of the pumped liquid, causing the so-called cavitation, i.e. liquid evaporation. To prevent this, the pressure in the suction port (at the inlet of the pump) should be higher than the saturation pressure corresponding to the liquid temperature by the net positive <b>suction</b> <b>head</b> (NPSH).|$|E
50|$|Following {{condensation}} of the {{low pressure}} exhaust steam in the condenser, the feed water is passed to a condensate sump mounted under the condenser. From this receiver the condensate is drawn by one or two extraction pumps and passed through a discharge strainer. The low pressure feed heating system consists of five Direct Contact heaters with one high level deaerator to provide a high feed pump <b>suction</b> <b>head.</b> The Direct Contact L.P. heaters are arranged in two banks, comprising three and two heaters respectively. Within each bank the heaters are stacked above each other so that the condensate drains from the lower pressure heater below by gravity. The heights of the heaters are approximately inversely proportional to the bled steam pressures. The advantages of Direct Contact heaters are essentially that thermal efficiency is improved, capital cost is reduced due to fewer numbers of extraction pumps being required, and the system is entirely ferrous. The main extraction pump discharges the condensate to No.1 D.C. heater from which it cascades down to No.2 and then to No.3 D.C. heater by gravity. Two lift pumps deliver the condensate to No.4 D.C. heater, from which it cascades through No.5 D.C. heater to two deaerator lift pumps. The deaerator lift pumps discharge the condensate to the deaerator and from there it passes to the boiler feed pump suction main through microwire and magnetic filters. The main boiler feed pump is driven by a steam turbine which receives its steam from the main H.P. turbine exhaust. It comprises a single cylinder eleven stage turbine turning at 5,000 rev/min (31.42 Rad/min) and driving a multi-stage pump to give a delivery pressure of 2,067 tonne/m2 (2,940 lbf/in2). Two electrically driven Starting and Standby feed pumps are provided. The high pressure heating system consists of two parallel banks of two heaters being numbered 7 and 8 stages in the system. Each of the H.P. heaters is vertical and of the non-contact type. From the H.P. heaters the condensate, at a temperature of 253 degrees Celsius (455 degrees Fahrenheit), is passed into the boiler economiser. During unit shutdowns {{the whole of the}} feed system can be ‘blanketed’ with nitrogen gas. This is an attempt to reduce the rate at which copper and ferrous oxides form, hence reduce the ‘carrying over’ of these oxides to the boiler drum. Boiler feed water make-up is supplied by the Water Treatment Plant. This has a continuous rating of 3,672,000 Litres (970,000 gallons) in 24 hours at 153,300 Litres (40,500 gallons) per hour. The plant comprises three groups of cation, anion and mixed bed ion exchange resin units, together with vacuum degassing and pressure filtering plant. Each group processes 76,650 Litres (20,250 gallons) per hour and normally two groups are in service at one time, with the third on standby or being regenerated.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to develop a {{conceptual}} model of saline intrusion within coastal karst aquifers by analyzing Rainfall–Discharge–Salinity data and to assess freshwater resources using a lumped modeling approach. In a first step, we analyzed 4 years of data (rainfall, discharge and salinity times series) ofthe Port-Miou brackish submarine spring in South France (400 km 2). A conceptual model of the aquifer was then designed to differentiate a deep brackish reservoir and a shallower fresh one. Salinity variations at the spring are assumed to be controlled mainly by dilution originating from the fresh water in the shallower reservoir. In a second step, a lumped modeling approach was developed based on the conceptual model to simulate discharge as well as salinity over time. We proposed a reservoir-model to take into account slow and fast components in the shallower part of the aquifer and a saline intrusion in the deeper one. This Rainfall–Discharge–Salinity model was calibrated and validated for two periods of 1. 5 years at a daily time step and was also tested to reproduce a multi-annual evolution of the available discharge and salinity time series. Good simulation results were obtained to reproduce water and mass budgets as well as discharge and salinity dynamics during several hydrological cycles. The simultaneous modeling of hydrodynamics and quality data showed the robustness of the model in addition to its easy implementation. Our results led us to propose a new type of seawater mixing mechanism for brackish springs: the dilution type, in addition to the well-known Ventury <b>suction</b> and <b>Head</b> balance types.
