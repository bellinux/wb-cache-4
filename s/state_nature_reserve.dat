It is shown that the northernmost populations in the exist within the karst landscapes {{in the north of}} White Sea-Kuloi Plateau (between 65°35' and 66°03' N) in the downstream of the Soyana and Kuloi rivers and in the north of Timan Highland (66°10' N) along the shore of Kosminskoe Lake (the Pechora River basin). Northern limits of the clouded Apollo's range appear to be strongly determined by the distribution of its larval host plants (primarily Corydalis solida and the role of climate and relief seem to be of minor importance. Many Russian populations inhabit the <b>state</b> <b>nature</b> <b>reserve</b> territories: Kizgi Scerries Reserve (Karelia Republic), Pinega and Soyansky reserves (Arkhangelsk Oblast), Pechoro-Ilychsky and Belaja Kedva reserves (Komi Republic).|$|E

The liverwort flora is the richest amongst those of large <b>State</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>Reserves</b> of the European part of Russia. Eight taxa of liverworts are known in Murmansk Province from the LSNBR only: Frullania tamarisci, Lejeunea cavifolia, Lophoziopsis excisa var. elegans, Mannia triandra, Reboulia hemisphaerica, Oleolophozia perssonii, Nowellia curvifolia, Scapania calcicola. The liverwort diversity varies slightly between different LSNBR Mountains: in Salnye Tundry Mts there were recorded 139 species, in Chuna-tundra Mts – 133, in Monche-tundra Mts – 124, in Nyavka-tundra – 112. The territory gives a good representation for protection and sustainable development of rare hepatic species – fifteen species are red-listed in Europe, four liverworts are included in the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation and thirty one taxa are protected in Murmansk Province. ...|$|R
