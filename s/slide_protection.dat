2500|$|Wheel <b>Slide</b> <b>Protection</b> (WSP) {{equipment}} is fitted to passenger trains {{to manage the}} behaviour of wheel sets in low adhesion conditions. [...] When the train is braking, it behaves like the ABS system in cars by releasing the brake on any axle if it detects that it is locking up. [...] WSP can also control the traction system to prevent wheel spin when applying power.|$|E
2500|$|The loss of {{friction}} between wheels and rail results in loss of tractive force — the wheels begin to spin, {{and in some}} instances the train is unable to move. In braking, substantial loss {{of friction}} results in reduced braking force. Braking distances are considerably longer, and in extreme cases the wheels may even lock up, causing the train to slide. Modern locomotives and multiple units are equipped with Wheel <b>slide</b> <b>protection</b> to counter slippery rail conditions. [...] Locked wheels can self-grind flat spots on the steel tyres, especially if the wheels are still sliding when arriving at a non-greasy section of rail, e.g. one that has previously been sanded. [...] This causes the wheels to go out of profile (known colloquially as 'wheel flats'), which subsequently leads to severe vibration and the need for the wheels to be re-profiled or re-tyred at great expense.|$|E
50|$|Bearingless speed sensors may {{be found}} in almost every {{wheelset}} of a rail vehicle. They are principally used for wheel <b>slide</b> <b>protection</b> and usually supplied by the manufacturer of the wheel <b>slide</b> <b>protection</b> system. These sensors require a sufficiently small air gap and need to be particularly reliable.One special feature of rotary speed sensors that are used for wheel <b>slide</b> <b>protection</b> is their integrated monitoring functions. Two-wire sensors with a current output of 7 mA/14 mA are used to detect broken cables. Other designs provide for an output voltage of around 7 V as soon as the signal frequency drops below 1 Hz. Another method used is to detect a 50 MHz output signal from the sensor when the power supply is periodically modulated at 50 MHz. It is also common for two-channel sensors to have electrically isolated channels. Occasionally it is necessary to take off the wheel <b>slide</b> <b>protection</b> signal at the traction motor, and the output frequency is then often too high for the wheel <b>slide</b> <b>protection</b> electronics. For this application a speed sensor with an integrated frequency divider or encoder can be utilized.|$|E
40|$|Cell {{suppression}} {{has been}} a commonly used method at the Census Bureau and at other agencies for protecting sensitive cells in statistical tables whose cells contain magnitude data. In this method, the sensitivity of each cell depends {{on the distribution of}} the respondent values which are summed to form the cell value. Those cells determined to be sensitive are suppressed and then a cell suppression program is run to determine which additional cells (called secondary suppressions) need to be suppressed {{in order to protect the}} sensitive ones. In this study, we compare two ways of protecting sensitive cells and their effects on the suppression patterns, i. e., the set of secondary ones. These ways are (1) fixed interval <b>protection</b> and (2) <b>sliding</b> <b>protection.</b> In studies done over a decade ago by researchers at the University of Maryland, it was shown that <b>sliding</b> <b>protection</b> often leads to fewer secondary suppressions than fixed interval protection. Here we show that this result does not hold when the cell suppression program incorporates the following assumption: if v is any respondent value, then any table user knows, from publicly available information, that the value lies in the interval [0, 2 *v]. In other words, respondent values are known by interested parties to within 100 % of their actual value...|$|R
40|$|The last {{reform of}} the Uniform Act on General Commercial Law OHADA reconsidered several pieces of {{commercial}} law. The concept of leasing has not been spared. She, who was accompanied by the "commercial" substantive, {{has been transformed into}} "commercial lease". Question of style or simple semantics? Certainly not, because the legislature in 1997, had not previously dared revise the designation commercial lease that no longer fit with the extension of the beneficiaries he had devoted himself. With the reform of December 2010, the institution of the lease has just renamed. Parliament also confirmed the extension of the scope of economic actors involved in the protection of the lease. The regime of former Uniform Act was therefore not fully extended, particularly since we noted another significant change in the new text. Contrary to former Article 69 which devoted two cumulative criteria necessary for the implementation of the lease of the regime, including the situation in a populated city of more than 5, 000 people and membership of local under lease to a designated class, the new text retains a single criterion, that of belonging to a local specific category. This mutation disrupts some basics of goodwill theory. Indeed, with the increasing scope of lessees, there is a <b>sliding</b> <b>protection</b> to professional trader. This causes result in a substitution of the lease of the foundation that passes from customer to the profession. The loss of the privileged place of business customers coupled with doctrinal and jurisprudential developments in the theory of civil customers, argue for an assimilation of the different customer categories...|$|R
2500|$|Throughout {{the early}} 1980s, {{limitations}} of the 5¼-inch format became clear. Originally designed to be more practical than the 8-inch format, it was itself too large; as the quality of recording media grew, data could be stored in a smaller area. A number of solutions were developed, with drives at 2-, 2½-, 3-, 3¼-, 3½- and 4-inches (and Sony's 90.0mm×94.0mm disk) offered by various companies. They all shared a number of advantages over the old format, including a rigid case with a sliding metal cover over the head slot, which helped protect the delicate magnetic medium from dust and damage, and a <b>sliding</b> write <b>protection</b> tab, which was far more practical than the adhesive tabs used with earlier disks. The large market share of the 5¼-inch format {{made it difficult for}} these new formats to gain significant market share. A variant on the Sony design, introduced in 1982 by a large number of manufacturers, was then rapidly adopted; by 1988 the 3½-inch was outselling the 5¼-inch.|$|R

40|$|Hardmetal {{coatings}} {{produced by}} high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) spraying are intensively studied for <b>sliding</b> wear <b>protection,</b> where commonly a low kinetic {{coefficient of friction}} is required. However, these coatings have also a high potential {{to serve as a}} coating solution for components requiring a high static coefficient of friction. As part of a systematic study, in this work the static coefficient of friction of as-sprayed (Ti,Mo) (C,N) -Ni hardmetal coatings in torsion experiments with different contact pressures was studied and is reported in detail. The coatings were sprayed from an experimental feedstock powder with a liquid-fuelled HVOF gun. Geometric parameters, as the number of islands, the mean surface of the islands and the volume of the material for a specific evaluation height c of the friction surface have been investigated together with its form and orientation. The slipping curves have been determined and static coefficients of friction µ 0. 1 up to 0. 66 and µmax up to 0. 80 were measured. The results show a decreasing standard deviation with increasing nominal contact pressure. After the slipping experiments, both the coating surfaces and the metallographically prepared cross sections have been studied in detail. It has been found that material from the counterparts has been transferred to the coating surfaces...|$|R
40|$|During {{the year}} of 2010, a funland in Borlänge was burned to the ground. The {{development}} of the fire was fast and critical condition for evacuation happened fast. There were few visitors in the funland at this time and they all managed to evacuate without any harm. Funlands often contains large play structures with plastic coated steel pipes and {{a large amount of}} the plastics in a funland are contained within large <b>slides,</b> <b>protections</b> in case of falling and other details. Funlands are often built in old industry locals or warehouses. The report aims to highlight the problems that can occur during evacuation of funland. Portions of this are to examine the behavior of children during evacuation, possible fire in the funland and opportunities for the design of the funland. Two different funlands are studied in this report. One of them was built in an old clothes shop during 2013 and the other one was built in an old industry local during 2008. To investigate the possibility of evacuation a literature study was to be made. These literature studies have involved studies of children's behavior during evacuation and studies in scenario analysis, criteria for safe egress and evacuation analysis according to the Constitution Board's guidelines on analytical design of fire protection of buildings (Boverkets allmänna råd om analytisk dimensionering av byggnaders brandskydd (BBRAD)). The scenario analysis and evacuation calculations have been made on the existing funlands. To do these analysis, computer programs such as Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) has been used for the fire simulations and Simulex and hand calculation methods from BBRAD has been used for evacuation calculations. An identification of plastics in the play structures was done to determine a possible fire in a funland. Sensitivity analysis for the identified parameters was performed and was compared to a reference simulation according to given values from BBRAD. A fire with ultra-fast fire growth rate is possible with respect the involved plastics. The result of the evacuation analysis gave that a complete evacuation of a funland will take a very long time. An important part that creates the long evacuation time is the children’s behavior during evacuation where it isn’t possible to assume that they can manage the evacuation by themselves without assistance. The other part is the play structures available in the funlands. They are impressive structures with many nooks and crannies that impede evacuation. In summary, the criteria for safe evacuation in BBRAD are not met by any of the funlands. This leads to that greater demands must be set on fire protection in funlands with respect to the possible fire that may occur and the behavior of children during evacuation. Linked to this, the fire protection in a funland should be verified by using analytical methods and it should be investigated which activity class funlands should be classified as according to the building regulations. Depending on the business class, different requirements for fire safety are required. Validerat; 20131127 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R

50|$|In {{common with}} the whole Networker fleet, wheel <b>slide</b> <b>protection</b> (WSP) {{operates}} on every axle.

50|$|Wheel <b>slide</b> <b>{{protection}}</b> and {{wheel slip}} protection are railway terms {{used to describe}} automatic systems used to detect and prevent wheel-slide during braking or wheel-slip during acceleration. This is analogous to ABS and traction control systems used on motor vehicles. It is particularly important in slippery rail conditions.|$|E
50|$|The {{emergency}} brake applies considerably more braking force {{than the standard}} full-service brake.

50|$|Wheel <b>Slide</b> <b>Protection</b> (WSP) {{equipment}} is generally fitted to passenger trains {{to manage the}} behaviour of wheel sets in “low adhesion” (reduced wheel/rail friction) conditions.

The system {{can also be used}} to control (or provide an input to) the traction system to control wheel spin when applying power in low adhesion conditions.|$|E
50|$|From {{one to four}} {{channels}} can be implemented, each channel {{having a}} photosensor that scans one of at most two signal tracks on a slotted disk. Experience shows that the possible number of channels achievable by this technique is still not enough. A number of subsystems therefore {{have to make do}} with looped-through signals from the wheel <b>slide</b> <b>protection</b> electronics and are therefore forced to accept, for instance, the available number of pulses, although a separate speed signal might well have some advantages.|$|E
50|$|Many of the {{subsystems}} in a rail vehicle, such as {{a locomotive}} or multiple unit, depend on a reliable and precise rotary speed signal, in some cases {{as a measure of}} the speed or changes in the speed.

During braking if wheelslide is detected by the Wheel <b>slide</b> <b>protection</b> (WSP), rheostatic braking is disabled and disc-braking only is used. Great Northern units have sanding equipment. Unlike some other DMU/EMU classes, additional brake force is not available when the emergency brake application is initiated and is the equivalent force of a step 3/full service application. WSP is still active when making an emergency application.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{traction}} is {{good for}} the powered bogies the concept has the same problem as other light railcars with the brakes on the non-powered axles having lower grip than traditional railcars. This has led to actual restrictions when leafs are on the rails as the wheel <b>slide</b> <b>protection</b> can not fully compensate the effect. The central power module has limits with heat dissipation as well which can lead into situations where the power output needs to be limited which is automatically done in this construction concept.|$|E
50|$|During braking, the {{traction}} motor connections are altered {{to turn them}} into electrical generators. The motor fields are connected across the main traction generator (MG) and the motor armatures are connected across the load. The MG now excites the motor fields. The rolling locomotive or multiple unit wheels turn the motor armatures, and the motors act as generators, either sending the generated current through onboard resistors (dynamic braking) or back into the supply (regenerative braking). Compared to electro-pneumatic friction brakes, braking with the {{traction motor}}s can be regulated faster improving the performance of wheel <b>slide</b> <b>protection.</b>|$|E

As part of the re-powering of the fleet, the air operated camshaft and electrical resistance grids will be removed, as well as the EE507 traction motors. The new equipment will consist of DC to AC inverters of the IGBT type. This is needed as the replacement traction motors are AC rather than DC. As the new control equipment allows for regenerative braking, the wheel <b>slide</b> <b>protection</b> system (on both powered and unpowered bogies) is also upgraded.|$|E
50|$|Sanding is {{one method}} of {{reducing}} wheel slip or slide. Locomotives and Multiple units have sandboxes which can deliver dry sand to the rails {{in front of}} the wheels. This may be initiated automatically when the Wheel <b>Slide</b> <b>Protection</b> system senses loss of adhesion, or the driver can operate it manually. Sanding may be connected to a computer system that determines the train's direction and where the sand should be applied: either forward or aft of the trucks.

The function of a WSPD and possible improvements, which have been suggested by the UIC Report 2 of the task group B 164, are discussed within the thesis. One of the improvements is the implementation of adhesion curves in the simulation that are dependent of the wheel slip velocity. The implementation of this improvement in the named WSPD algorithm is explained as well the findings of a before and after test. The conclusion show that adhesion dependent wheel slip curves in the simulation algorithm of a WSPD are necessary to test a WSP Systems ability of finding the maximum adhesion during the braking process...|$|E
30|$|The brake {{performance}} test concerns the emergency and service braking at several initial speeds, considering the different working and operating {{conditions of the}} braking system (direct electro-pneumatic, indirect electro-pneumatic, pneumatic, etc.).

In this way, {{it is possible to}} accurately estimate the total force of X exchanged between both wheels and rails. For low adhesion tests that are usually performed on straight lines, these kinds of results/measurements of the total X force are valuable.

30|$|Wheel–track {{interaction}} {{is actually a}} very complicated phenomenon and several methods {{have been used to}} compute the normal and friction forces on wheels in the literature [13, 14]. Kalker’s linear creep theory offers an easy solution to incorporate creep forces into the rail vehicle model {{as a function of the}} speed of the rail vehicle. Therefore, Kalker’s theory is an essential ingredient of many of dynamic rail vehicle models in the present literature. Comparison of different wheel–track interaction models has been well studied; however, most of the models ignore the fact that wheel slip phenomena had been reduced significantly with the recent improvements in traction and brake technologies. Therefore, wheel slip can be observed for modern rapid transit rail vehicles depending on the wheel–track adhesion conditions, but at normal conditions wheel <b>slide</b> <b>protection</b> systems avoid wheel slide during acceleration and braking.|$|E
40|$|Wheel <b>slide</b> <b>protection</b> devices (WSPD) {{are destined}} to avoid {{important}} sliding of wheels during braking actions in case of temporarily impaired wheel-rail adhesion by correspondent reductions of air pressure in brake cylinders. Accordingly, longer braking distances and higher longitudinal in-train forces occur, potentially affecting the traffic safety and the passengers comfort. A general analyse and evaluation of these effects are the main targets of the present study. The theoretical considerations are sustained by simulations of braking process, considering situations of normal, respectively diminished wheel-rail adhesion determining random actuations of WSPD. The air pressure evolution in brake cylinders of was experimentally determined on a computerized brake system test stand and adequately used as input in simulations. The results indicate an increase of in-train forces and a more complex evolution of the longitudinal dynamic actions between the vehicles {{in the case of}} degraded wheel-rail adhesion, when the random actuation of WSPD have major influence in the whole braking process...|$|E

It requires using a structured argumentation, named Safety Case, {{to present the}} fulfilment of these conditions. As guidance for building the Safety Case, this standard provides the structure of high-level safety objectives and the recommendations of development techniques according to different Safety Integrity Levels (SIL). Nevertheless, the rationale connecting these techniques to the high-level safety objectives is not explicit. The proposed techniques stem from experts belief in the effectiveness and efficiency of these techniques to achieve the underlying safety objectives. So, how should one formalize and assess this belief? And as a result how much confidence can {{we have in the}} safety of railway systems when these standards are used? To deal with these questions, the paper successively addresses two aspects: 1) making explicit the safety assurance rationale by modelling the Safety Case with GSN (Goal Structuring Notation) according to EN 5012 x standards; 2) proposing a quantitative framework based on Dempster-Shafer theory to formalize and assessing the confidence in the Safety Case.

40|$|In modern railway Automatic Train Protection and Automatic Train Control systems, odometry is {{a safety}} {{relevant}} on-board subsystem which estimates the instantaneous speed and the travelled {{distance of the}} train; a high reliability of the odometry estimate is fundamental, since an error on the train position {{may lead to a}} potentially dangerous overestimation of the distance available for braking. To improve the odometry estimate accuracy, data fusion of different inputs coming from a redundant sensor layout may be used. Simplified two-dimensional models of railway vehicles have been usually used for Hardware in the Loop test rig testing of conventional odometry algorithms and of on-board safety relevant subsystems (like the Wheel <b>Slide</b> <b>Protection</b> braking system) in which the train speed is estimated from the measures of the wheel angular speed. Two-dimensional models are not suitable to develop solutions like the inertial type localisation algorithms (using 3 D accelerometers and 3 D gyroscopes) and the introduction of Global Positioning System (or similar) or the magnetometer. In order to test these algorithms correctly and increase odometry performances, a three-dimensional multibody model of a railway vehicle has been developed, using Matlab-Simulink™, including an efficient contact model which can simulate degraded adhesion conditions (the development and prototyping of odometry algorithms involve the simulation of realistic environmental conditions).
