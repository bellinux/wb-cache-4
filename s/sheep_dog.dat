5|$|The Welsh Mountain sheep is a {{hardy breed}} that can scrape {{a living from}} the mountainous {{habitats}} where they spend the whole year. Being adept at exploiting their environment, they have local knowledge of their mountains and are {{left to their own}} devices, being gathered once or twice a year. Originally often horned, and various shades of brown or black, they were often of poor conformation and bedraggled appearance. More recently, scientific breeding has improved them and they have been exported to many parts of the world. They form part of the ancestry of various local breeds of sheep in Wales, the Llanwenog, the Lleyn sheep, the Kerry Hill, the badger-faced, the Welsh mule and the Beulah speckle-faced. In rural areas, sheep are still an important part of life with local livestock shows and <b>sheep</b> <b>dog</b> trials taking place annually.|$|E
5|$|Tired of his high-priced {{imported}} livestock {{losing in}} local shows, Glure concocts a dog {{show with a}} special gold cup event that is limited to collies that are both American Kennel Club blue ribbon winners and capable of completing the tasks of a British working <b>sheep</b> <b>dog</b> trial. Initially, {{it seems like the}} only dog who meets the requirements is Glure's recently purchased blue-merle champion, Lochinvar III; however, the Mistress is able to command Lad through the motions of the trial. Lochinvar works primarily by hand signal, so when Glure accidentally burns his fingers on his cigar while going through the trial, the dog stops working and waits for Glure's hand-shaking to be explained. The dog is disqualified and Lad is declared the winner. The Master and Mistress donate the gold cup to the Red Cross in his name.|$|E

25|$|In the UK, {{there are}} two {{separate}} registries for Border Collies. The International <b>Sheep</b> <b>Dog</b> Society encourages breeding for herding ability, whereas the Kennel Club (UK) encourages breeding for a standardised appearance. The ISDS registry {{is by far the}} older of the two, and ISDS dogs are eligible for registration as pedigree Border Collies with the Kennel Club (KC) — but not vice versa. The only way for a Border Collie without an ISDS pedigree {{to be added to the}} ISDS registry is by proving its worth as a herding dog so that it can be Registered on Merit (ROM).|$|E
25|$|After {{being hired}} at a farm, the pair are confronted by Curley—The Boss's small, {{aggressive}} son with a Napoleon complex who dislikes larger men, {{and starts to}} target Lennie. Curley's flirtatious and provocative wife, to whom Lennie is instantly attracted, poses a problem as well. In contrast, the pair also meets Candy, an elderly ranch handyman {{with one hand and}} a loyal dog, and Slim, an intelligent and gentle jerkline-skinner whose dog has recently had a litter of puppies. Slim gives a puppy to Lennie and Candy, whose loyal, accomplished <b>sheep</b> <b>dog</b> was put down by fellow ranch-hand Carlson.|$|E
25|$|While the Kangal {{is often}} {{referred}} to as a <b>sheep</b> <b>dog,</b> it is not a herding dog, but rather a flock guardian that lives with the flock of sheep to actively fend off predators of all sizes. Typically used as protection against wolves, bears, and jackals in its native Turkey, the breed has been exported to African countries like Namibia and Kenya in more recent years due to its intimidating size and capabilities as an effective guardian, where it successfully protects local herds from lions, cheetahs, and similar indigenous big cats, which has had the benefit of not only protecting livestock, but ensuring the continuity of endangered predators due to reduced cullings by local farmers.|$|E
50|$|Chrysomya bezziana usually infects {{livestock}} causing myiasis. Myiasis is the infestation {{of tissue}} (living or dead) on a living mammal by fly larvae. Mammals such as <b>sheep,</b> <b>dogs,</b> cattle, pigs, and even humans can become infested.|$|R
30|$|Another {{very popular}} {{way of making}} the Australian public aware of climate drivers was {{through the use of}} the climate dogs {{cartoons}} [46]. The idea behind representing major climate phenomena such as ENSO, The Indian Ocean Dipole (Indy), The Sub Tropical Ridge (Ridgy) and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) as <b>sheep</b> <b>dogs</b> is that the Australian agricultural community is familiar with the concept of <b>sheep</b> <b>dogs</b> herding white fluffy things like sheep, so that they would easily understand the idea of climate drivers herding white fluffy things like clouds. The idea has been extended to the Pacific Islands with the introduction of the animated video adventures of the climate crab [47].|$|R

25|$|Wiston Cap (b. 28 Sep. 1963) is the {{dog that}} the International <b>Sheep</b> <b>Dog</b> Society (ISDS) badge portrays in the {{characteristic}} Border Collie herding pose. He {{was a popular}} stud dog {{in the history of}} the breed, and his bloodline can be seen in most bloodlines of the modern day Collie. Bred by W. S. Hetherington and trained and handled by John Richardson, Cap was a biddable and good-natured dog. His bloodlines all trace back to the early registered dogs of the stud book, and to J. M. Wilson's Cap, whose name occurs 16 times within seven generations in his pedigree. Wiston Cap sired three Supreme Champions and is grand-sire of three others, one of whom was E. W. Edwards' Bill, who won the championship twice.|$|E

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} study of 202 working <b>sheep</b> <b>dogs</b> and 56 owners was undertaken in 2010 {{to investigate the}} dogs‟ age, gender, breed, body condition scores, aspects of their husbandry, prevalence of and risk factors for nematode and protozoan parasitism, and prevalence of and risk factors for chorioretinopathy in working <b>sheep</b> <b>dogs.</b> Owners were convenience sampled from the South-West Waikato and the Tux North Island Dog Trial Championship 2010. Two-way tables were used to explore the relationship between variables. Significance of association was assessed using a Chi-squared or Fisher exact test as appropriate with a p-value of < 0. 05 considered significant. Faecal analysis found 68 / 170 dogs (40 %) had a nematode and/or protozoan parasite infection. Nineteen per cent (33 / 170) were infected with parasites from the Nematode phylum: Toxocara canis (9 / 170, 5 %), hookworms (Uncinaria stenocephala or Ancylostoma caninum) (20 / 170, 12 %) or Trichuris vulpis (8 / 170, 5 %). Prevalence of protozoan infections was: Sarcocystis spp. 35 / 170 (21 %), Isospora canis or Isospora ohioensis 9 / 170 (5 %), Neospora caninum and Hammondia heydorni 4 / 170 (2 %) and Giardia spp. 13 / 170 (8 %). Younger animals had a significantly higher prevalence of Toxocara canis (P< 0. 0001) and Giardia spp. (P< 0. 0001). Prevalence of chorioretinopathy in the working <b>sheep</b> <b>dogs</b> was 44 / 184 dogs (24 %). Older animals and males had a significantly higher prevalence of chorioretinopathy than younger animals (P= 0. 0007) and females (P< 0. 0001) respectively. Body condition scores for 197 animals found that: 29 had a BCS {{less than or equal}} to 2 / 9, 78 had a BCS of 3 / 9, 77 had a BCS of 4 / 9 and 13 had a BCS equal to or greater than 5 / 9. The BCS varied significantly between breeds (P= 0. 002) with Huntaways comprising 23 / 29 of the dogs who were BCS two or less. The mean age of the working <b>sheep</b> <b>dogs</b> was 4. 8 years, 85 / 200 (43 %) were Huntaways, 84 / 200 (42 %) were Heading dogs and 173 / 191 (91 %) of the working <b>sheep</b> <b>dogs</b> were entire. Seventy-eight per cent of owners fed their dogs a diet consisting of commercial food and home kill sheep meat once a day. This study concluded that gastrointestinal nematode and protozoan parasitism and chorioretinopathy are occurring in working <b>sheep</b> <b>dogs.</b> The aetiology of the chorioretinopathy is undetermined. Further farmer education on the use of anthelmintic and prevention of gastrointestinal nematode and protozoa parasites may be required...|$|R

25|$|The {{striped hyena}} is {{sometimes}} {{implicated in the}} killing of livestock, particularly goats, <b>sheep,</b> <b>dogs</b> and poultry.
