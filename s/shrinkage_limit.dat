25|$|As a hard, rigid solid {{in the dry}} state, soil {{becomes a}} crumbly (friable) semisolid when a certain {{moisture}} content, termed the <b>shrinkage</b> <b>limit,</b> is reached. If it is an expansive soil, this soil will also begin to swell in volume as this moisture content is exceeded. Increasing the water content beyond the soil's plastic limit will transform it into a malleable, plastic mass, which causes additional swelling.

2500|$|The Atterberg {{limits are}} a basic {{measure of the}} {{critical}} water contents of a fine-grained soil: its <b>shrinkage</b> <b>limit,</b> plastic limit, and liquid limit. As a dry, clayey soil takes on increasing amounts of water, it undergoes distinct changes in behavior and consistency. Depending on the water content of the soil, it may appear in four states: solid, semi-solid, plastic and liquid. In each state, the consistency and behavior of a soil is different and consequently so are its engineering properties. Thus, the boundary between each state can be defined based on {{a change in the}} soil's behavior. The Atterberg limits can be used to distinguish between silt and clay, and it can distinguish between different types of silts and clays. These limits were created by Albert Atterberg, a Swedish agriculturist. They were later refined by Arthur Casagrande. These distinctions in soil are used in assessing the soils that are to have structures built on. [...] Soils when wet retain water and some expand in volume. [...] The amount of expansion is related to the ability of the soil to take in water and its structural make-up (the type of atoms present). These tests are mainly used on clayey or silty soils since these are the soils that expand and shrink due to moisture content. [...] Clays and silts react with the water and thus change sizes and have varying shear strengths. Thus these tests are used widely in the preliminary stages of designing any structure to ensure that the soil will have the correct amount of shear strength and not too much change in volume as it expands and shrinks with different moisture contents.|$|E

30|$|In this study, {{a commercially}} {{available}} enzyme {{which is used}} popularly to improve sub-grade material for pavements {{was used as a}} potential stabilizer to improve soil properties used for earthen construction. As a preliminary study, the interaction of this enzyme with the soil was assessed by evaluating the plasticity and strength characteristics of enzyme treated soil with ageing. From the research findings, it was observed that with ageing, the liquid limit of soil decreased, while plastic and <b>shrinkage</b> <b>limits</b> increased, leading to reduced plasticity and shrinkage indices. The reduced plasticity and shrinkage indices indicate that soil has become relatively more volumetrically stable and less susceptible to crack formation. Further, strength characteristics under two different curing conditions were evaluated, and it was found that under sealed curing conditions, the treated soil had better compressive strength. The improvement of plasticity, shrinkage and strength characteristics due to the addition of enzymes can be advantageously used for development of lightly stabilized durable earthen construction material, and thus, eliminating the necessity of using conventional energy-intensive stabilizers. The findings from this study bring the immense potential of eco-friendly enzymatic stabilization in the development of modern sustainable earthen materials.|$|R

A large part of Cyprus is covered by clay formations with intermediate to extremely high swelling potential and high calcium corbonate content. Cyprus Clays can be divided into five main groups; 1. Bentonitic Clays, 2. Clays of Mamonia Complex, 3. Clays of Kythrea Group, 4. Clays of Nicosia Formation and 5. Alluvial Clays. The first four groups are overconsolidated clays of high swelling potential. Geological formations containing clays of high swelling potential are significantly exposed around Nicosia and Famagusta. There is widespread damage observed to the buildings, major roads and highways all over the Island which were founded on swelling clays. Landslides occur at the steep and very steep slopes of these formations. The alluviums comprise loose-medium dense gravel and sand, and soft-firm silt and clay. Mostly contain low amounts of clay size material. The alluviums also contain high amounts of montmorillonite. These clayey soils have low to intermediate swelling potential.
