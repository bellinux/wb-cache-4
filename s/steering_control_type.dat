The spatially oriented tripod follow-the-leader gait {{is an extension of}} previous studies of temporal follow-the­ leader gaits and should prove useful for all-terrain walking vehicles, such as the Adaptive Suspension Vehicle. Tractor-trailer style steering is introduced as an effort to tailor <b>steering</b> <b>control</b> for this <b>type</b> of gait.

40|$|The {{influence}} of driver distraction on driving performance {{is not yet}} well understood, but it can have detrimental effects on road safety. In this study, we {{examined the effects of}} visual and non-visual distractions during driving, using a high-fidelity driving simulator. The visual task was presented either at an offset angle on an in-vehicle screen, or {{on the back of a}} moving lead vehicle. Similar to results from previous studies in this area, non-visual (cognitive) distraction resulted in improved lane keeping performance and increased gaze concentration towards the centre of the road, compared to baseline driving, and further examination of the <b>steering</b> <b>control</b> metrics indicated an increase in steering wheel reversal rates, steering wheel acceleration, and steering entropy. We show, for the first time, that when the visual task is presented centrally, drivers’ lane deviation reduces (similar to non-visual distraction), whilst measures of <b>steering</b> <b>control,</b> overall, indicated more steering activity, compared to baseline. When using a visual task that required the diversion of gaze to an in-vehicle display, but without a manual element, lane keeping performance was similar to baseline driving. Steering wheel reversal rates were found to adequately tease apart the effects of non-visual distraction (increase of 0. 5 degree reversals) and visual distraction with offset gaze direction (increase of 2. 5 degree reversals). These findings are discussed in terms of <b>steering</b> <b>control</b> during different <b>types</b> of in-vehicle distraction, and the possible role of manual interference by distracting secondary tasks...|$|R
5000|$|AK Hellas (the {{initials}} {{standing for}} the full name of the company, 'Aggelopoulos-Karkanis O.E.') was a Greek manufacturer of light trucks and other metal products. It designed and produced two basic types of vehicles - all three-wheelers with 50cc engines, {{taking advantage of a}} favorable classification as [...] "motorbikes" [...] according to Greek law. One group of models it produced since 1965 were light trucks with [...] "motorcycle" [...] structure (<b>steering</b> and <b>controls),</b> a <b>type</b> of vehicle also produced in Greece by MEBEA (by far the most successful), Mego, Alta, Saracakis, Pitsos (a big home appliances manufacturer), Markal, Naxos and others. The other group of models were [...] "proper" [...] micro-trucks, with [...] "automobile" [...] structure of <b>steering,</b> <b>controls</b> etc. It was in this category that AK Hellas became the biggest truck manufacturer in Greece, leaving behind MEBEA, Delta (a product of Attica), Minicar, Zamba and other smaller Greek manufacturers. The company's T200 model, using a Sachs 50cc 4.8 hp engine and with a payload of 150 kg was produced between 1968 and 1975 with three different cab designs and in several versions (including van models).

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to evaluate a method of maintaining stability of an air cushion vehicle and also to evaluate several concepts to brake and steer an ACLS-equipped vehicle. The investigation used a modified airboat equipped with an air cushion landing system. The pressure relief door stability concept was characterized by the ACLS pressure time histories. The pressure relief doors vented excess cavity and lobe pressures and consistently maintained vehicle heave and pitch stability. Braking concepts were characterized by the average deceleration of the vehicle. Reduced lobe flow and cavity venting braking concepts were evaluated in this program. The cavity venting concept demonstrated the best performance, producing decelerations on the test vehicle on the same order as moderate braking with conventional wheel brakes. Steering concepts were evaluated by recording the path taken while attempting to follow a prescribed maneuver. The steering concepts evaluated included using rudders only, using differential lobe flow, and using rudders combined with a lightly loaded, nonsteering center wheel. The latter concept {{proved to be the}} most accurate means of steering the vehicle on the ACLS, producing translational deviations which, while two to three times higher than those from conventional nose gear steering, were still felt to provide reasonably precise <b>steering</b> <b>control</b> for this <b>type</b> vehicle...|$|R

In order to get satisfactory <b>steering</b> <b>control</b> performance, an adaptive sliding mode control method based on a nonlinear integral sliding surface is proposed in this paper for agricultural vehicle <b>steering</b> <b>control.</b> First, the vehicle steering system is modeled as a second-order mathematic model; the system uncertainties and unmodeled dynamics as well as the external disturbances are regarded as the equivalent disturbances satisfying a certain boundary. Second, a transient process of the desired system response is constructed in each navigation control period. Based on the transient process, a nonlinear integral sliding surface is designed. Then the corresponding sliding mode control law is proposed to guarantee the fast response characteristics with no overshoot in the closed-loop <b>steering</b> <b>control</b> system. Meanwhile, the switching gain of sliding mode control is adaptively adjusted to alleviate the control input chattering by using the fuzzy control method. Finally, the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed method are verified by a series of simulation and actual <b>steering</b> <b>control</b> experiments.

40|$|A new {{solution}} of disc permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) directly driven wheel is proposed as a design customized for low floor tramcar. And the motors are overhung on the bogie frame {{to make the}} weight as the sprung mass. Meanwhile, the universal coupling is installed between the driven wheel and motor shaft. A disc PMSM is designed according to the demand of traction power. The motors are not only traction and steering actuators but are also regarded as sensors to obtain the rotational speed of motor directly driven wheel. Through the obtained data, an active sensorless <b>steering</b> <b>control</b> method is applied using the relative rotational speed between wheel pair. Finally, models combined with motor <b>control</b> and <b>steering</b> <b>control</b> are set up to check the control strategies. The simulation results indicate that sliding mode observer has the functionality of estimating the rotating speed with high accuracy for active <b>steering</b> <b>control.</b> The tramcar exhibits self-steering and better negotiation under active <b>steering</b> <b>control.</b> The tramcar is under a better condition of running along the central line of track with small attack angle and low power consumption while passing the shape curve track...|$|R
40|$|Simulation-based vehicle {{system design}} and {{development}} of various active chassis control systems necessitate an enhanced understanding of driver-vehicle systems, in particular improved modeling of driver driving control characteristics. A number of research efforts {{have been made in}} developing driver models in the past few decades. However, little effort has been attempted in modeling driver <b>steering</b> <b>control</b> behavior capturing vehicle-road system parameter uncertainties. In this paper, a novel driver <b>steering</b> <b>control</b> model based on stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) is proposed to effectively incorporate the variations in the vehicle-road system parameters. The proposed SMPC-based driver <b>steering</b> <b>control</b> framework consists of three modules, namely perception, decision and execution, where a multi-point driver preview approach is employed. An internal vehicle dynamics model with the parameter uncertainty in road friction coefficient is formulated to represent the driver's knowledge and adaptation about the variations in road conditions. The SMPC method is then used to minimize a cost function that is a weighted combination of lateral path error and ease of driver control. Simulation analysis about the variant parameters and comparison with an MPC-based driver model demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed SMPC-based driver <b>steering</b> <b>control</b> model...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Wichita State University, Fairmount College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Dept. of PsychologyDriving is {{primarily}} a visual task that involves processing visual information over space and time (e. g., motion perception). Previous {{research has shown that}} such spatial and temporal processing becomes much more difficult under deteriorated conditions such as driving at night or in fog. One important research question is whether the deterioration associated with low contrast scenes can be recovered though training. This dissertation aims to answer this question in two experiments by testing a theoretical framework of perceptual learning training, which is based on low level common mechanisms, on a <b>steering</b> <b>control</b> task. The first experiment examined whether a relationship exists between performances on 2 D and 3 D Coherent Motion tasks under low contrast and a simulated <b>steering</b> <b>control</b> task under low contrast. The results from Experiment 1 demonstrates that performance on the Coherent Motion tasks, regardless of whether they are 2 D or 3 D displays, is able to predict certain performance measures of <b>steering</b> <b>control.</b> Then, Experiment 2 examined whether perceptual learning training utilizing the low contrast Coherent Motion task has an effect on <b>steering</b> <b>control</b> performance under low contrast. After five hours of Coherent Motion training, participants significantly improved their squared coherency scores on the <b>steering</b> <b>control</b> task more than the control group, indicating an increase in steering stability and predictability. These results suggest that perceptual learning of a simple, low-level visual task can be transferred to a more complex task, which share a common low level mechanism...|$|R
