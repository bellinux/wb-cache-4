Al-Zawahri's four-minute address was titled The Aggression against Lal Masjid and dedicated <b>solely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> clash between the Lal Masjid militants and the Pakistan Army. The video was released by al-Qaeda's media wing, as-Sahab and subtitled in English.|$|E
5|$|According to some authors, {{who use the}} {{original}} description by Treitz, the muscle may {{be divided into two}} sections: a ligamentous portion attaching the right crus of diaphragm to the connective tissue surrounding the coeliac artery and superior mesenteric artery; and a lower muscular portion from the connective tissue attaching to the duodenum. The superior portion is also described as the Hilfsmuskel. These two parts are now considered anatomically distinct, with the suspensory muscle referring <b>solely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lower structure attaching at the duodenum.|$|E
5|$|After {{agreement}} {{from the}} Cardiff Athletic Club, the freehold {{of the south}} ground was transferred <b>solely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> WRU in July 1968. Work could then begin on the new National Stadium. Glamorgan County Cricket Club would move to Sophia Gardens and the cricket ground to the north would be demolished and a new rugby union stadium built for Cardiff RFC, who would {{move out of the}} south ground, allowing the National Stadium to be built, for the sole use of the national rugby union team.|$|E

5|$|The Kennet and Avon Canal is a {{waterway}} {{in southern}} England {{with an overall}} length of , made up of two lengths of navigable river linked by a canal. The name is commonly {{used to refer to}} {{the entire length of the}} navigation rather than <b>solely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> central canal section. From Bristol to Bath the waterway follows the natural course of the River Avon before the canal links it to the River Kennet at Newbury, and from there to Reading on the River Thames. In all, the waterway incorporates 105 locks.|$|E
5|$|The lavish banquet {{was certain}} to be an affront to those {{suffering}} {{in a time of}} severe austerity, but it was reported in the L'Ami du peuple and other firebrand newspapers as nothing short of a gluttonous orgy. Worst of all, the papers all dwelt scornfully on the reputed desecration of the tricolor cockade; drunken officers were said to have stamped upon this symbol of the nation and professed their allegiance <b>solely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> white cockade of the House of Bourbon. This embellished tale of the royal banquet became the source of intense public outrage.|$|E
5|$|The planetarium {{remained}} at normal levels of service during this renovation period, but attendance dropped significantly, {{particularly when the}} adjacent museum was closed {{for a period of}} two years during the most intensive phase of its second major expansion. In all, the construction phase lasted for four years, from 1978 to 1982. In particular, some school groups that could justify the expense of seeing the museum and a planetarium show in a single day's outing had difficulty justifying a visit <b>solely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> planetarium.|$|E

5|$|This led to {{proposals}} {{for a new}} radar dedicated <b>solely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> early warning role, determining only which MAR or SCD would ultimately {{have to deal with}} the threat. Used primarily in the first minutes of the attack, and not responsible for the engagements, the system could be considered disposable and did not need anything like the sophistication or hardening of the MAR. This led to the Perimeter Acquisition Radar (PAR), which would operate cheaper electronics at VHF frequencies.|$|E
5|$|During Western Han, the Minister of Finance's {{powers were}} limited to the public treasury, the Minister Steward being {{responsible}} for the emperor's private wealth. However, in Eastern Han, the responsibilities for the public treasury and the emperor's private wealth were amalgamated and entrusted <b>solely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Minister of Finance, which later proved disastrous when handled by irresponsible emperors such as Ling (r. 168–189 AD). During Western Han, the Minister of Finance managed the government's monopolized salt and iron agencies, which were abolished during Eastern Han and transferred to local administrations and private entrepreneurship. He also managed the government's brief monopoly over liquor from 98–81 BC, before it was returned to private production. Although the Minister Steward and then the Superintendent of Waterways and Parks managed the imperial mint for issuing standard coins during Western Han, in Eastern Han the imperial mint {{was transferred to the}} office of the Minister of Finance.|$|E
5|$|During the war, {{plans were}} drawn up to quell Welsh {{nationalism}} by affiliating Elizabeth {{more closely with}} Wales. Proposals, such as appointing her Constable of Caernarfon Castle or a patron of Urdd Gobaith Cymru (the Welsh League of Youth), were abandoned for various reasons, which included a fear of associating Elizabeth with conscientious objectors in the Urdd, {{at a time when}} Britain was at war. Welsh politicians suggested that she be made Princess of Wales on her 18th birthday. Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison supported the idea, but the King rejected it because he felt such a title belonged <b>solely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wife of a Prince of Wales and the Prince of Wales had always been the heir apparent. In 1946, she was inducted into the Welsh Gorsedd of Bards at the National Eisteddfod of Wales.|$|E

5|$|In 1823, the Synod paid a {{significant}} portion of Queen's College's debts in order to place the institution on a secure financial footing and enable it to reopen. With the second reopening, the Synod provided clergymen to serve at the college as theology professors. Livingston had dedicated several years to raising money for the effort but died shortly before Queen's College reopened in 1825. The Rev. Philip Milledoler, a Reformed clergyman from New York City, was appointed to fill the vacancy created by Livingston's death. Milledoler persuaded one of his parishioners, Colonel Henry Rutgers (1745–1830), to support the college. The trustees subsequently renamed it Rutgers College in his honour. At first, the Synod exercised oversight over the operations of the college, but by 1840 directed its attentions <b>solely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> operation of the seminary. During this period Rutgers College, the college's grammar school (now Rutgers Preparatory School), and the seminary shared one building, known as Old Queens (built 1809-1823) until the two schools separated operations entirely in 1856.|$|E
5|$|Petticoats made of {{horsehair}} crinoline appeared around 1839, proving {{so successful}} that the name 'crinoline' began to refer to supportive petticoats in general, rather than <b>solely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> material. By 1847, crinoline fabric was {{being used as a}} stiffening for skirt linings, although English women preferred separate crinoline fabric petticoats which were beginning to collapse under the increasing weight of the skirts. One alternative to horsehair crinoline was the quilted petticoat stuffed with down or feathers, such as that reportedly worn in 1842 by Lady Aylesbury. However, quilted skirts were not widely produced until the early 1850s. In about 1849, it was possible to buy stiffened and corded cotton fabric for making petticoats, marketed as 'crinoline,' and designed as a substitute for the horsehair textile. The artificial crinoline with hoops did not emerge until the 1850s.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} works {{attributed}} to the trobairitz is estimated at thirty-two songs, but ranges anywhere from 23 to 46. There {{are a number of}} reasons why an exact number is not known. In the courtly love tradition it was common for poems to be written as an exchange of letters, or a debate, as in a tenso. Some of these may have been originally written by one poet; however, some were originally an actual exchange of epistles, later gathered together in a manuscript. Some of these were between men, and some were {{between a man and a}} woman. Some modern editors attribute these <b>solely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> man who originated the exchange, and some attribute them to both the man and the woman involved. There is a long history of attributing these solely to men, even when all evidence points to the contrary.|$|E

5|$|The {{sea mink}} was first {{described}} in 1903, after its extinction; information regarding its external appearance and habits stem from speculation and from accounts made by fur traders and Native Americans. It may have exhibited behavior {{similar to the}} American mink, in that it probably maintained home ranges, was polygynandrous, and had a similar diet, though more seaward-oriented. It was probably found on the New England coast and the Maritime Provinces, though its range may have stretched further south during the last glacial period. Conversely, its range may have been restricted <b>solely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> New England coast, specifically the Gulf of Maine, or just to nearby islands. Largest of the minks, the sea mink was more desirable to fur traders and became extinct in the late 19th or early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|When Ross {{returned}} home, Houston {{asked him}} to disband the company and form a new company of 83 men, promising to send written directives soon. While Ross {{was in the process}} of supervising this reorganization, Houston appointed Captain William C. Dalrymple as his new aide-de-camp with overall command of the Texas Rangers. Dalrymple, unaware of Houston's verbal orders, castigated Ross for disbanding his company. Ross completed the reorganization of the company, then returned to Waco and resigned his commission. In his letter of resignation, effective February 1861, Ross informed Houston of his encounter with Dalrymple, and noted he did not believe a Ranger company could be effective if the captain did not report <b>solely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Governor. Houston offered to appoint Ross as an aide-de-camp with the rank of colonel, but Ross refused.|$|E
5|$|When {{municipal}} graveyards {{began to}} overfill Ware began negotiations with various local authorities to acquire land for further cemeteries. Ware {{began with an}} agreement with France to build joint British and French cemeteries under the understanding that these would be maintained by the French government. Ware eventually concluded {{that it was not}} prudent to leave the maintenance responsibilities <b>solely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> French government and subsequently arranged for France to purchase the land, grant it in perpetuity, and leave the management and maintenance responsibilities to the British. The French government agreed under the condition that cemeteries respected certain dimensions, were accessible by public road, were in the vicinity of medical aid stations and were not too close to towns or villages. Similar negotiations began with the Belgian government.|$|E

5|$|Following the Federation of Australia in 1901, the {{amalgamation}} of {{the military}} forces controlled by the six separate, self-governing British colonies to form a unified force controlled by the Commonwealth was an inevitable, albeit slowly realised, consequence, given that the new Constitution of Australia assigned the defence power <b>solely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth. Indeed, this process took some time as, to a large extent, matters of defence were not necessarily a priority of the new Australian legislature at the time, {{and there was also}} a considerable diversity in opinion regarding the composition and size of the new national army and role it would play at home and indeed within the wider Imperial defence system. Nevertheless, the official transfer of forces from the states to the Commonwealth occurred on 1 March 1901, and this date is today celebrated as the birthday of the modern Australian Army. At the outset, the bulk of the Commonwealth military force was to be made up of part-time volunteers. This was arguably due to two factors. Firstly, there was a widespread desire amongst Australian policymakers to keep defence expenditure low, while secondly there was a widespread mistrust or suspicion surrounding the idea of a large standing army.|$|E
