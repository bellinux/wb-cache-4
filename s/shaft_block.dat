50|$|The {{gas mixture}} has been {{responsible}} for many deaths among underground workers, especially miners. For example, the Hartley Colliery Disaster when the entire population of a colliery in north-east England were trapped when the beam of an engine suddenly broke and fell down the single <b>shaft,</b> <b>blocking</b> it with debris. It entombed 204 men and boys, who could not be rescued in time, and so suffocated in the blackdamp atmosphere, and died.|$|R
50|$|The ores of the Ojuela Mine, Mexico, are {{replacement}} {{deposits in}} limestone and consist of galena, sphalerite, pyrite, and arsenopyrite in {{a matrix of}} quartz, dolomite and fluorite. Arsenopyrite is abundant. On a dump near the north <b>shaft</b> <b>blocks</b> of massive scorodite containing seams and pockets of arseniosiderite and small areas of dussertite and carminite have been found. Carminite also occurs as masses mixed with cerussite, anglesite and plumbojarosite. It is almost always intimately associated with arseniosiderite and dussertite.|$|R
50|$|On {{the south}} side of the track, Dingle <b>Shaft</b> is {{completely}} <b>blocked,</b> though a large stream sinks in this area. Footway Shaft, just to the north of the track, is also blocked. On the brow of the hill, Hampsons Shaft is filled but Flat Rod Shaft is open to a rubbish infill at 60 ft. The next shaft encountered is Stone <b>Shaft,</b> now <b>blocked,</b> followed by an area of gruffy ground in which Gardens Shaft and Old Shaft are located. The last shaft, Gough's Shaft, is by the side of the road and is blocked.|$|R
50|$|Three other American {{soldiers}} {{also died}} accidentally at Shepton Mallet: they asphyxiated and died from {{carbon monoxide poisoning}} in a locked cell in which the ventilation <b>shaft</b> was <b>blocked</b> with leaves and a naked gas-lamp had used {{up most of the}} oxygen.|$|R
50|$|As {{with all}} Packards to date, the Model G's engine was {{placed under the}} driver's bench and {{laterally}} mounted, the crank protruding out of the right side. As mentioned, it {{was derived from the}} single-cylinder variant for which Packard already had a good reputation. Construction consisted of two single-cylinder engines that were connected in a horizontal opposed position and worked on a common crank <b>shaft.</b> <b>Blocks</b> were cast iron with non-detachable cylinder heads. Cylinders had a bore and stroke of 6 x 6 1/2 in. (152.4 × 165.1 mm) each, resulting in a displacement of 184 c.i (3,015 cm³) per cylinder and huge 368 c.i. (6,030 cm³) for the whole engine. Packard used a Longuemar float-feed carburetor for each cylinder. Ignition advance was manual. Power rating (following then-actual practice) was 24 H.P.|$|R
50|$|The {{expanding}} gas {{as well as}} {{the blocks}} of salt demolished the building above the mine <b>shaft,</b> resulting in <b>blocks</b> of concrete being ejected as well.|$|R
25|$|Open-die {{forgings}} can {{be worked}} into shapes which include discs, hubs, <b>blocks,</b> <b>shafts</b> (including step shafts or with flanges), sleeves, cylinders, flats, hexes, rounds, plate, and some custom shapes.|$|R
50|$|During deceleration, {{the engine}} vacuum rises and acts against the spring {{to push the}} <b>shaft</b> downwards, thereby <b>blocking</b> the opening through which {{atmospheric}} air is passed to the exhaust.|$|R
50|$|A zipper blocker {{prevents}} the zipper from sliding down its shaft. One version is a locking safety pin {{in which a}} piece of the metal bar simply rests across the <b>shaft,</b> thereby <b>blocking</b> movement of the zipper's channel in that direction. Other versions, which are sewn onto the garment, involve two pieces of metal that hook together, and likewise block the zipper's movement.|$|R
50|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} suggests that Amenemhet started to build his pyramid at Thebes but for unknown reasons switched his capital {{and the location of}} his pyramid to Lisht. The pyramid upon its completion rose to a height of 55 m, with a base length of 83 m and a slope of 54 degrees. The core of the pyramid was made with small rough blocks of local limestone with a loose fill of sand debris and mud brick. Some of the limestone was stripped from other monuments, blocks of stone from the pyramids of Khufu, Khafre, Unas and Pepi II (or possibly Pepi I) have been found in the pyramid. Inside the pyramid a sloped <b>shaft</b> <b>blocked</b> with granite plugs upon burial ran from the ground level entrance chapel to a vertical shaft that descended directly to the burial chamber. The overall construction of the pyramid was poor and little of it remains today.|$|R

50|$|A {{variation}} on this puzzle inserts the rubber-band into the <b>shaft</b> of the <b>block</b> opposite the pointed piece. At least one variation allows the demonstrator to hook the rubber band and {{show it to}} observers.|$|R
50|$|Tuff {{is strong}} and easily worked, making it an ideal {{building}} material. Tuff was mined through access and removal shafts called the occhio di monte, ("eye of the mountain"). Through these <b>shaft,</b> gigantic <b>blocks</b> of tuff were quarried and pulled up. The resulting void was a bottle shaped cavity with sloping shoulders, which provided ample reinforcement to prevent future cave-ins. After the tuff was quarried it was used as building material during roughly the Angevin, Aragonese and Bourbon periods.|$|R
50|$|The {{main shaft}} was {{originally}} {{developed as a}} three-compartment shaft: one manway and two for skips. Although the original size is not stated they were commonly about 6 feet by 18 feet (1.8m x 5.4m). Due to collapses during the period between World War I and 1970 the actual opening is now substantially larger. There is a section of concrete collar {{on the east side}} of the shaft extending down about 2.5 metres. The <b>shaft</b> is <b>blocked</b> about 9 metres below ground level.|$|R
40|$|Periprosthetic {{fractures}} {{are increasingly}} frequent. The fracture may be located over {{the shaft of}} the prosthesis, at its tip or below (21). The treatment of explosion fractures is difficult because the <b>shaft</b> <b>blocks</b> the application of implants, like screws, which need to penetrate the medullary cavity. The cerclage, as a simple periosteal loop, made of wire or more recently cable, does not only avoid the medullary cavity. Its centripetal mode of action is well suited for reducing and maintaining radially displaced fractures. Furthermore, the cerclage lends itself well for minimally invasive internal fixation. New insight challenges the disrepute of which the cerclage technology suffered for decades. The outcome of cerclage fixation benefits from an improved understanding of its technology, mechano-biology and periosteal blood supply. Preconceived and generally accepted opinions like "strangulation of blood supply" need to be re-examined. Recent mechanical evaluations (22) demonstrate that the wire application may be improved but cable is superior in hand- ling, maintenance of tension and strength. Beside the classical concepts of absolute and relative stability a defined stability condition needs consideration. It is typical for cerclage. Called "loose-lock stability" it specifies the situation where a loosened implant allows first unimpeded displacement changing abruptly into a locked fixation preventing further dislocation...|$|R
2500|$|The shafts in the Queen's Chamber were {{explored}} in 1993 by the German engineer Rudolf Gantenbrink using a crawler robot he designed, Upuaut 2. After a climb of , {{he discovered that}} one of the <b>shafts</b> was <b>blocked</b> by limestone [...] "doors" [...] with two eroded copper [...] "handles". Some years later the National Geographic Society created a similar robot which, in September 2002, drilled a small hole in the southern door, only to find another door behind it. The northern passage, which was difficult to navigate because of twists and turns, was also found to be blocked by a door.|$|R
50|$|The B205 and B235 {{engines are}} an {{evolution}} of the B204 and B234 engines. They were introduced in the 1998 Saab 9-5 giving reduced fuel consumption and emissions with improved refinement. The changes included lightweight internal components (lighter valves, softer valve springs, longer conrods with lighter pistons, and balance <b>shafts),</b> lighter <b>block</b> and cover, heavier flywheel and more. Another development was {{the introduction of the}} Trionic 7 torque demand type engine management system. Trionic 7 equipped engines have the black direct ignition casing on top of the engine rather than the red of the Trionic 5.|$|R
50|$|Some mine <b>shafts</b> are <b>blocked</b> by cave-ins, {{which require}} {{dynamite}} to clear, but Roderick must not stand too close when the dynamite explodes. The helmet laser can also destroy cave-ins, {{but it does}} so much more slowly than dynamite. In later levels, the player must contend with magma, which, like cave-ins, can be dynamited to clear a path, but like the mine creatures, is lethal when touched. Later levels also feature solid walls of magma, with openings that alternate between open and closed. Skillful navigation is required to fly through the opening without touching the magma.|$|R

5000|$|The first {{coal mines}} in Seymour were opened in 1884. In 1902, the Numa Block Coal Company took over these mines. [...] In 1908, [...] "Big Jim", Numa Block number 2 was 1 mile {{east of the}} Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway depot, was the largest coal mine in Appanoose-Wayne Coalfield, able to produce 100,000 tons per year at full capacity. The Mystic coal seam was just over 2 feet thick here, reached by a 202-foot <b>shaft.</b> Numa <b>Block</b> Mine number 3, the Sunshine Mine, was in the {{southeast}} part of town, served by the Rock Island, with a 240-foot shaft to the Mystic seam.|$|R
5000|$|In 1907, fire {{destroyed}} the surface equipment of the Numa Block mine, then {{the most productive}} mine in the county. The Numa <b>Block</b> <b>shaft</b> was 150 ft deep, giving access to a 30 in coal seam. The Numa Block Coal Company also owned mines in Seymour, (about 8 mi to the west). [...] In 1912, Local 875 of the United Mine Workers, based in Numa, had 392 members.|$|R
50|$|A short {{distance}} to the south is another unnamed <b>shaft,</b> now <b>blocked,</b> and a few yards to the north is an open stopehead. The latter was descended for 30 ft in 1994 into an excavated vein. There is a squeeze into Rider Shaft and workings heading west for 40 ft to a collapse. From Rider Shaft, {{the line of the}} vein can be followed to the remains of Old Grit engine house. The pumping shaft here is open but flooded a {{short distance}} down. The three other shafts in the area, including Foxhole Air Shaft to the north-west and Bye Pit to the south-west, are blocked. Excavation of the tips at Old Grit has revealed that they consist largely of boiler ash.|$|R
50|$|Mining {{has always}} been {{especially}} dangerous, because of explosions, roof cave-ins, {{and the difficulty of}} underground rescue. The worst single disaster in British coal mining history was at Senghenydd in the South Wales coalfield. On the morning of 14 October 1913 an explosion and subsequent fire killed 436 men and boys. Only 72 bodies were recovered. It followed a series of many extensive Mining accidents in the late 19th century, such as The Oaks explosion of 1866 and the Hartley Colliery Disaster of 1862. Most of the explosions were caused by firedamp ignitions followed by coal dust explosions. At Hartley there was no explosion, but the miners entombed when the single <b>shaft</b> was <b>blocked</b> by a broken cast iron beam from the haulage engine.Deaths were mainly caused by carbon monoxide poisoning, known as afterdamp.|$|R
6000|$|... § II. It {{is clearly}} {{necessary}} that shafts {{of this kind}} (we will call them, for convenience, <b>block</b> <b>shafts)</b> should be composed of stone not liable to flaws or fissures; and therefore that we must no longer continue our argument {{as if it were}} always possible to do {{what is to be done}} in the best way; for the style of a national architecture may evidently depend, in great measure, upon the nature of the rocks of the country.|$|R
60|$|This is {{accordingly}} {{the natural}} {{form of a}} detached <b>block</b> <b>shaft.</b> It is the best. No other will ever be so agreeable to the mind or eye. I do not mean {{that it is not}} capable of more refined execution, or of the application of some of the laws of æsthetic beauty, but that it is the best recipient of execution and subject of law; better in either case than if you had taken more pains, and cut it straight.|$|R

50|$|Rescue {{crews were}} sent down {{ventilation}} shafts, {{as the main}} <b>shafts</b> were <b>blocked</b> because of the explosion, and two miners were rescued at some time after the collapse. One {{body was found in}} the rubble. On June 9, it was announced that 22 more miners, who had been waiting for 30 hours, were rescued by the crews, while 13 remained buried. On June 10, an official said that there was little chance that the 12 remaining miners were alive, as 9 of them were riding up an elevator when the blast happened, sending the cage down the shaft, and the other 3 were 1000 m underground, where methane levels were dangerously high after the explosion. Officials were also concerned that the mine could flood. More than 30 m have flooded into the mine, a report says. Little hope was expressed by officials for the twelve miners still trapped.|$|R
50|$|Quench {{hardening}} is {{a mechanical}} {{process in which}} steel and cast iron alloys are strengthened and hardened. These metals consist of ferrous metals and alloys. This is done by heating the material to a certain temperature, depending on the material. This produces a harder material by either surface hardening or through-hardening varying on {{the rate at which}} the material is cooled. The material is then often tempered to reduce the brittleness that may increase from the quench hardening process. Items that may be quenched include gears, <b>shafts,</b> and wear <b>blocks.</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{long ago}} as the 1920s, miners in Park City were using {{underground}} trains and shafts {{to gain access to}} the mountain for skiing. Aerial trams once used for hauling ore were converted into chairlifts. To this day, there are still more than 1000 mi of old silver-mine workings and tunnels beneath the slopes at Park City Mountain Resort and neighboring Deer Valley. Park City might be a fairly nondescript-appearing town were it not for its colorful and evocative Main Street, where 64 Victorian buildings are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. There are many remaining mine buildings, mine <b>shafts</b> (most <b>blocked</b> off from outsiders with large steel doors), and hoists, including the weathered remains of the California-Comstock and Silver King Mines and the water towers once used to hydrate one of the biggest mines, the Silver King, provide a hint of the history of this mining town transformed in economic upheaval into a skiing resort.|$|R
60|$|Our own English rocks, which supply {{excellent}} {{building stone}} from their thin and easily divisible beds, {{are for the}} most part entirely incapable of being worked into shafts of any size, except only the granites and whinstones, whose hardness renders them intractable for ordinary purposes;--and English architecture therefore supplies no instances of the <b>block</b> <b>shaft</b> applied on an extensive scale; while the facility of obtaining large masses of marble has in Greece and Italy been partly the cause of the adoption of certain noble types of architectural form peculiar to those countries, or, when occurring elsewhere, derived from them.|$|R
60|$|Within {{an hour of}} the {{explosion}} the managers of the surrounding pits had assembled; {{and in spite of}} the fact that the three volunteers who had first descended were, without doubt, killed, plenty of other brave fellows volunteered their services, and would have gone down if permitted. But the repeated explosions, and the fact that the lower part of the <b>shaft</b> was now <b>blocked</b> up, decided the experienced men who had assembled that such a course would be madness--an opinion which was thoroughly endorsed by Mr. Hardinge and other government inspectors and mining authorities, who arrived within a few hours of the accident.|$|R
50|$|Lamb Leer Cavern {{was first}} found by miners looking for lead around 1676, and in 1681 the {{geologist}} John Beaumont, the pioneer of pit caving, gave {{an account of}} his descent into the cave to the Royal Society. It was rediscovered in 1880, when a new shaft was driven in, and became something of a tourist attraction. By the 1920s the new <b>shaft</b> had become <b>blocked</b> and in 1936 the original entrance was re-opened. In the late 1930s a cablecar was in place across the Great Chamber. Additional chambers were discovered in the 1960s and 1970s.|$|R
50|$|The motor {{consists}} of a four-, five-, six- or eight-sided rotor block {{in the middle of}} a <b>shaft.</b> The rotor <b>block</b> has two sets of windings and a solar cell attached to each side. The shaft is positioned horizontally and has a magnet at each end. The magnets on the shaft provide levitation by repelling magnets in a base under the motor. This air friction bearing is required because a mendocino motor uses Lorentz force without iron core. There is an additional magnet that sits under the rotor block and provides a magnetic field for the rotor. Other motors hide the base magnet in a tube.|$|R
5000|$|The large {{distance}} mileposts (Distanzsäule) comprised seven elements. The pedestal {{was formed}} by the plinth, dado and cornice (or cap). The column consists of the base (Zwischenplatte or Schaftfuß), the <b>shaft,</b> a <b>block</b> sowing the coat of arms (Wappenstück), and the finial (Aufsatz or Spitze). The columns have an average height of 8 ells (4.53 metres) and rest on a pedestal half an ell high. The individual elements were held together by means of iron pegs cast in lead. On the shaft of the column {{the names of the}} destinations were inscribed at Zürner's direction in a Fraktur font and based on the distance tables that had been worked out for each town. Several routes crossed state borders, and this was indicated by the letters gr (for Grenze or [...] "border") or a horizontal line. Part of the inscription on all columns was a post horn on all four sides, which was the emblem of the state's postal sovereignty. The arms of the Electorate of Saxony with a gilded crown and the Polish royal crown with the royal Polish-Lithuanian coat of arms were shown on the superstructure.|$|R
50|$|In October, {{repair of}} the hull resumed, but the {{mattress}} failed to be effective, and the cofferdam, fitted {{with a kind of}} ballast tank, was not put in place before mid-December. The breach was sealed only on 28 February. The damaged barrels were not yet repaired because of the obstruction of the German Armistice Commission. The Dakar dockyard capacities were only able to remove the starboard central propeller with a floating crane, but not to repair the <b>blocked</b> <b>shaft.</b> The anti-aircraft battery was reinforced by some 13.2 mm Browning MG mountings and four twin 37 mm CAD Model 1933 mountings, some being removed from the damaged destroyer , but the 152 mm turrets were not able yet to fire on aerial targets.|$|R
6000|$|... § XVIII. While, however, we {{have been}} thus subdividing or {{assembling}} our shafts, how far has it been possible to retain their curved or tapered outline? So long as they remain distinct and equal, however close to each other, the independent curvature may evidently be retained. But when once they come in contact, it is equally evident that a column, formed of shafts touching at the base and separate at the top, would appear as if in {{the very act of}} splitting asunder. Hence, in all the closely arranged groups, and especially those with a central shaft, the tapering is sacrificed; and with less cause for regret, because it was a provision against subsidence or distortion, which cannot now take place with the separate members of the group. Evidently, the work, if safe at all, must be executed with far greater accuracy and stability when its supports are so delicately arranged, than would be implied by such precaution. In grouping shafts, therefore, a true perpendicular line is, in nearly all cases, given to the pier; and the reader will anticipate that the two schools, which we have already found to be distinguished, the one by its perpendicular and pieced shafts, and the other by its curved and <b>block</b> <b>shafts,</b> will be found divided also in their employment of grouped shafts;--it is likely that the idea of grouping, however suggested, will be fully entertained and acted upon by the one, but hesitatingly by the other; and that we shall find, on the one hand, buildings displaying sometimes massy piers of small stones, sometimes clustered piers of rich complexity, and on the other, more or less regular succession of <b>block</b> <b>shafts,</b> each treated as entirely independent of those around it.|$|R
