The paper will demonstrate the success story of teaching Arabic to non-native speakers by offering a model of a program of teaching Arabic through experiencing Arabic and Islamic culture at their homeland. The study applies the descriptive analytical method, as it displays the activities of the program, analyzes the syllabus and evaluates the program outcomes. Its <b>significance</b> <b>lies</b> <b>on</b> strengthening the students” language and communication skills as well as their deep understanding of the target language culture...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{frequently}} used strategies in crisis management, i. e. crisis communication used by organizations affected by crisis is public apology for the crisis. Usually it is lightly {{considered as a}} strategy which automatically gives results and reduces the effects of crisis, which is far from true. The effectiveness of public apology depends on an entire series of {{factors such as the}} nature of crisis, place, time and manner in which the public apology is given and the addressed target public. Wrongly given apology may cause serious counter-effects. Particularly great <b>significance</b> <b>lies</b> <b>on</b> the cultural factors. No function of communication includes more tragic intercultural misunderstandings with more negative consequences than an apology given in a wrong way. Using a form of apology which is not in accordance with the cultural patterns of those to whom it has been addressed, the apology may jeopardize reconciliation, strengthen the resentment, prolong hostilities and additionally complicate resolving of the crisis...|$|E

In other words human capital is principal competitive advantage of knowledge based economies. Trends in today’s world are making us rethink the methods of delivering knowledge. In order to answer to those trends and as a proactive effort to foster their global competitiveness top students from two most influenced graduate schools (Faculty of Economics and Business and Faculty Electrical Engineering and Computing both within University of Zagreb) in Croatia gathered within eSTUDENT initiative and they have started project “Virtual Mentorship”. Its primary goal is to initialize and organize cooperation between senior undergraduate students from Croatian universities and acknowledged members of academic society and business world who live abroad but do have originated from Croatia. Purpose of the project is to establish mentor-protégé relationship between these two parties that will enable students to learn and improve their knowledge as well as gain new skills through quality virtual communication with respectable scientists and professionals. This project has a great potential and significance for development of Croatian system of education {{as well as for}} improvement of Croatian labor competitiveness in general. Its <b>significance</b> <b>lies</b> primarily <b>on</b> impacts that Virtual Mentorship has on educational system. mentorship, virtual, knowledge sharing, networking, distance learning...|$|R

Skeletal muscles undergo specific alter-ations that are related to the aging process. Protein syn-thesis in the skeletal muscles of old rats is decreased [1, 2]. In humans, a 20 % reduction in peripheral muscle strength is found at age 70 as compared to age 20, with a corresponding decrease in muscle mass. Atrophy of the small muscles of the hand is encountered in 50 % of the elderly. The deep tendon reflexes are reduced to the point of absent ankle jerks in 45 - 50 % of the elderly [3, 4]...|$|R
40|$|The {{purposes}} {{and impact of}} higher education {{on the economy and}} the broader society have been transformed through time in various ways. Higher education institutional and policy dynamics differ across time, but also between countries and political regimes and therefore context cannot be neglected. This article reviews the purpose of higher education and its institutional characteristics juxtaposing two, allegedly rival, conceptual frameworks; the instrumental and the intrinsic one. Various pedagogical traditions are critically reviewed and used as examples, which can potentially inform today’s policy making. Since, higher education cannot be seen as detached from all other lower levels of education appropriate conceptual links are offered throughout this article. Its <b>significance</b> <b>lies</b> <b>on</b> the organic synthesis of literature across social science, suggesting ways of going forward based on the traditions that already exist but seem underutilized so far because of overdependence in market-driven practices. This offers a new insight on how theories can inform policy making, through conceptual “bridging” and reconciliation. The debate on the purpose of higher education is placed under the context of the most recent developments of increasing social inequalities in the western world and its relation to the mass model of higher education and the relevant policy decisions for a continuous increase in participation. This article suggests that the current policy focus on labor market driven policies in higher education have led to an ever growing competition transforming this social institution to an ordinary market-place, where attainment and degrees are seen as a currency that can be converted to a labour market value. Education has become an instrument for economic progress moving away from its original role to provide context for human development. As a result, higher education becomes very expensive and even if policies are directed towards openness, in practice, just a few have the money to afford it. A shift toward a hybrid model, where the intrinsic purpose of higher education is equally acknowledged along with its instrumental purpose should be seen by policy makers as the way forward to create educational systems that are more inclusive and societies that are more knowledgeable and just...|$|E

40|$|The seismic design maps on ASCE 7 - 05, International Building Code- 2006 / 2009, assumed uniform hazard ground {{motion with}} 2 % {{probability}} of exceedance in 50 {{years for the}} entire conterminous U. S. But, Luco et al in 2007 pointed out that as uncertainties in collapse capacity exists in structures, an adjustment on uniform hazard ground motion was proposed to develop new seismic design maps. Thus, risk-targeted ground motion with 1 % probability collapse in 50 years is adopted on ASCE 7 - 10. Even though these seismic design maps are developed for buildings, performance-based bridge design is done using same maps. Because <b>significance</b> difference <b>lies</b> <b>on</b> design procedure of buildings and bridges this thesis suggests some adjustment should be made on uncertainty in the collapse capacity(β) when using for bridge design. This research is done in 3 cities of U. S— San Francisco, New Madrid and New York. Hazard curve is drawn using 2008 version of USGS hazard maps and risk- targeted ground motion is calculated using equation given by Luco et al adjusting the uncertainty in collapse capacity(β) to be 0. 9 for bridge design instead of 0. 8 as used for buildings. The result is compared with existing result from ASCE 7 - 10, which uses β= 0. 6. The sample design response spectrum for site classes A, B, C and D is computed for all 3 cities using equations given in ASCE 7 - 10 for all β. The design response spectrum curves are analyzed to concluded that adjustment on uncertainty in collapse capacity should be done on ASCE 7 - 10 seismic design maps {{to be used for}} performance-based bridge design...|$|R
