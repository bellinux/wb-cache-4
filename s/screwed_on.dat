5|$|A {{waterfall}} bong (or {{reverse bucket}} bong) is another method of smoking. It is assembled using a large plastic bottle (preferably about 2 liter), a bung or rubber stopper, a brass cut nozzle {{to act as}} a bowl and keep the marijuana (or other herbs) from entering the bottle, and an aerator screen. Once the bottle is filled to its neck in water the lid is <b>screwed</b> <b>on,</b> removing the rubber stopper and igniting the contents of the bowl leads to draining water to cause smoke to be drawn into the bottle. The cap is removed after the water has completely drained out, allowing the user to inhale the smoke.|$|E
25|$|It has 15 {{side panels}} {{representing}} the 15 {{members of the}} team and with three handles to represent the three officials (referee and two touch judges). The cup has a capacity of 3.75 litres – sufficient for five bottles of champagne.

25|$|The longer horn was {{discovered}} on July 20, 1639 by a peasant girl named Kirsten Svendsdatter {{in the village}} of Gallehus, near Møgeltønder, Denmark when she saw it protrude above the ground. She wrote a letter to King Christian IV of Denmark who retrieved it and in turn gave it to the Danish prince Christian, who refurbished it into a drinking-horn, adding a golden pommel to be <b>screwed</b> <b>on</b> at the narrow end to close it up.|$|E

25|$|The modern {{gas mask}} was {{developed}} in 1944 by the US Army Chemical Warfare Service. It was made of plastic and rubber-like material that greatly reduced the weight and bulk, compared to World War I gas masks and fitted the user's face more snugly and comfortably. The main improvement was replacing the separate filter canister connected with a hose by a filter canister <b>screwed</b> <b>on</b> {{the side of the}} gas mask, that could be replaced easily. Also, it had replaceable plastic lenses, much helping vision.|$|E

2500|$|In 2001, Reznor {{successfully}} completed rehab, and eventually moved from New Orleans to Los Angeles. In a 2005 interview with Kerrang, he reflected on his self-destructive past: [...] "There was a persona that had run its course. I {{needed to get}} my priorities straight, my head <b>screwed</b> <b>on.</b> Instead of always working, I {{took a couple of}} years off, just to figure out who I was and working out if I wanted to keep doing this or not. I had become a terrible addict; I needed to get my shit together, figure out what had happened." [...] In contrast to his former suicidal tendencies, he admitted in another interview that he is [...] "pretty happy".

Saturday Night Lives Seth Meyers addressed the controversy on the program's Weekend Update segment, joking that the conflict showed that [...] "you don't need Cinemax to see someone get <b>screwed</b> <b>on</b> TV", then defending O'Brien and summarizing the situation by comparing NBC to the husband of two wives, who had decided to leave one wife for another, and then change their mind and be married to both, angering both wives, so he comes {{up with an idea}} to fix the situation: kill the second wife. Meyers went on to sarcastically claim that the network's hope for survival all rested on Chuck, which had experienced several problems maintaining an audience, and point out that if they did end up moving The Tonight Show, it would likely mean Late Night (which Meyers would later host starting in 2014) would end, and host Jimmy Fallon would likely end up coming back to Update, which he had co-anchored with Tina Fey from 2000–04; he was wary of this result as he claimed he [...] "can't go back to being in a sketch every 3 weeks".|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{three-dimensional}} {{simulation of}} trabecular surface remodeling {{was performed to}} investigate the basic effects of a fixation <b>screw</b> <b>on</b> the trabecular structural changes in a vertebral body. Voxel-based finite elements were used to construct computational models of the bone and screw for an entire vertebral body with the screw and for the bone-screw interface. The remodeling simulation for the entire vertebral body showed that the implantation of the fixation screw caused changes in the mechanical environment in the cancellous bone, leading to trabecular structural changes at the cancellous level. The effect of the <b>screw</b> <b>on</b> trabecular orientation was greater in the regions {{above and below the}} <b>screw</b> than <b>on</b> that in front of the screw. In the case of the bone-screw interface, the trabecular structural changes depended on the load applied to the screw. It was suggested that bone resorption predicted in the pull-out loading case would be a candidate cause of loosening of the screw. The results indicate that the effects of the implanted <b>screw</b> <b>on</b> the trabecular structural changes would be more important for longer-term fixation. 1...|$|R
