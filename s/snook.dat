5|$|The Environmental Protection Agency has {{designated}} the Corpus Christi Bay system as an estuary of national significance. More than 234 {{species of fish}} {{are found in the}} bay, including the Gafftopsail catfish, Hardhead catfish, Atlantic croaker, Atlantic cutlassfish, Black drum, Red drum, Southern flounder, Crevalle jack, Ladyfish, Inshore lizardfish, Atlantic midshipman, Silver perch, Pinfish, Smooth puffer, Scaled sardine, Bighead searobin, Sand seatrout, Spotted seatrout, Sheepshead, Gray snapper, Common <b>snook,</b> and the Tripletail.|$|E
5|$|Fish make up some 90% of the blacktip shark's diet. A {{wide variety}} of fish have been {{recorded}} as prey for this species: sardines, herring, anchovies, ladyfish, sea catfish, cornetfish, flatfish, threadfins, mullet, mackerel, jacks, groupers, <b>snook,</b> porgies, mojarras, emperors, grunts, butterfish, tilapia, triggerfish, boxfish, and porcupinefish. They also feed on rays and skates, as well as smaller sharks such as smoothhounds and sharpnose sharks. Crustaceans and cephalopods are occasionally taken. In the Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey of the blacktip shark is the Gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus), followed by the Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus). Off South Africa, jacks and herring {{are the most important}} prey. Hunting peaks at dawn and dusk. The excitability and sociability of blacktip sharks makes them prone to feeding frenzies when large quantities of food are suddenly available, such as when fishing vessels dump their refuse overboard.|$|E
5|$|Laguna Madre {{is home to}} more finfish than {{anywhere}} else on the Texas coast, with such species as blue catfish, hardhead catfish, Atlantic croaker, black drum, red drum, southern flounder, alligator gar, houndfish, crevalle jack, southern kingfish, ladyfish, Atlantic midshipman, mojarras, striped mullet, pinfish, Florida pompano, smooth butterfly ray, spotted seatrout, blacktip shark, sheepshead, bigmouth sleeper, gray snapper, common <b>snook,</b> southern stargazer, southern stingray and tripletail. Many fowl migrate and live around the lagoon including 75% of all redhead ducks. Other birds in the area include the peregrine falcon, piping plover, roseate spoonbill, long-billed curlew, crane, egret and the brown pelican. Sea turtles and dolphins {{can be found in}} the bay, while cattle, white-tailed deer, nilgai and bobcats can sometimes be seen near the shore.|$|E
5000|$|Baby <b>Snooks</b> writer/producer Everett Freeman told Katkov that Brice did {{not like}} to rehearse the role ("I can't do a show until it's on the air, kid") but always snapped into it on the air, losing herself {{completely}} in the character: [...] "While she was on the air she was Baby <b>Snooks.</b> And... for an hour after the show, she was still Baby <b>Snooks.</b> The <b>Snooks</b> voice disappeared, of course, but the <b>Snooks</b> temperament, thinking, actions were all there." ...|$|R

50|$|While the picture-show {{business}} absorbed a {{great deal}} of Tom's time at nights and weekends, it was not his main business. In his day job, Tom was partner and, after the early retirement of his father Thomas George <b>Snooks</b> (1860-1937), principal of T. <b>Snooks</b> & Son, a successful building firm, which had its offices in the second-storey rooms under the clock tower. At least one of Tom's grandsons - the historical economist Graeme <b>Snooks</b> - regularly delighted in climbing {{to the top of the}} tower to look out over the entire district, while his father (William Donald <b>Snooks,</b> 1920-1966) was otherwise occupied with the firm's accounts. T. <b>Snooks</b> & Son was responsible for building many houses and small businesses in the Maylands-Inglewood area and beyond. Until Tom retired in 1945, due to ill health, all the boys, together with their sister Min (in accounts), worked in his firm; thereafter they established their own building business called <b>Snooks</b> Bros, which continued operating until the mid-1960s. Tom <b>Snooks,</b> therefore, played a significant role in both building and entertaining this microcosm of interwar suburbia.|$|R
25|$|USS <b>Snook</b> (SS-279), a Gato-class submarine, was {{the first}} ship of the United States Navy to be named for the common <b>snook,</b> an Atlantic marine fish that is bluish-gray above and silvery below a black lateral line.|$|E
25|$|In May 2014, former acting Superintendent, Daphne <b>Snook,</b> {{filed suit}} against the school board and the district's {{solicitor}} for $75,000 in damages regarding her suspension during a criminal investigation. The investigation involved her using the district's email system to read school board member emails on personnel issues. The emails were focused on the hiring of a new superintendent. <b>Snook</b> intended to apply for that position. The investigation concluded with the county district attorney filing no criminal charges. In her suit, <b>Snook</b> admitted to reading the private communications between the board members.|$|E

5000|$|In 1904, George McManus {{began his}} comic strip, The Newlyweds, {{about a couple}} and their child, Baby Snookums. Brice began doing her Baby <b>Snooks</b> {{character}} in vaudeville, as she recalled many years later: [...] "I first did <b>Snooks</b> in 1912 when I was in vaudeville. At the {{time there was a}} juvenile actress named Baby Peggy and she was very popular. Her hair was all curled and bleached and she was always in pink or blue. She looked like a strawberry ice cream soda. When I started to do Baby <b>Snooks,</b> I really was a baby, because when I think about Baby <b>Snooks</b> it's really the way I was when I was a kid. On stage, I made <b>Snooks</b> a caricature of Baby Peggy." ...|$|R
50|$|She {{returned}} with Stafford and the <b>Snooks</b> character {{to the safety}} of radio for her next appearance, on Tallulah Bankhead's big-budget, large-scale radio variety show The Big Show in November 1950, sharing the bill with Groucho Marx and Jane Powell. In one routine, <b>Snooks</b> asks Bankhead for advice on becoming an actress, despite Daddy's insistence that <b>Snooks</b> has no acting talent.|$|R

25|$|Most of 1977 {{was spent}} doing weekly {{operations}} out of San Diego and {{recovering from the}} overhaul that was completed {{in the early part}} of that year. At the completion of one such operation Sculpin had returned and tied up to the tender, and was broadsided by the USS <b>Snook</b> SSN 592 while <b>Snook</b> was trying to tie up next to Sculpin. <b>Snook</b> suffered damage to her bow tube outer doors and had to spend the next 6 weeks in drydock for repairs, forcing Sculpin back to sea to pick up Snook's operating schedule.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{before midnight}} on 3 July <b>Snook</b> made radar contact with another enemy convoy. Early the {{following}} morning, she fired a spread of six torpedoes, sinking cargo ships Koki Maru and Liverpool Maru and severely damaging Atlantic Maru. <b>Snook</b> returned to Pearl Harbor from her second patrol on 18 July.|$|E
25|$|In November 2013, Wesley L. Knapp, M.ED ($113,850 in 2009) {{abruptly}} resigned {{his position in}} exchange for the Midd-West School Board dropping pending charges. The Board offered no explanation regarding the departure, however Knapp received a substantial cash payout ($60,682 plus another $10,000 to be paid over six months). The Board appointed Daphne <b>Snook</b> as acting Superintendent pending the hiring of a new superintendent. In April 2014, the Board suspended Daphne <b>Snook</b> pending the results of a criminal investigation into her reading School Board confidential emails. The Midd-West School Board approved $200 per day as salary for Donna Samuelson as Interim Superintendent starting April 15, 2014. In early May 2014, the Snyder County District Attorney, Michael Piecuch, reported his investigation found insufficient evidence to file criminal charges against <b>Snook.</b> Piecuch noted that <b>Snook</b> did access emails she was directed to not open, referring the matter as a District personnel issue.|$|E
5000|$|From the 1930s {{until her}} death in 1951, Fanny made a radio {{presence}} as a bratty toddler named <b>Snooks,</b> a role she premiered in a Follies skit co-written by playwright Moss Hart. Baby <b>Snooks</b> premiered in The Ziegfeld Follies of the Air in February 1936 on CBS, with Alan Reed playing Lancelot Higgins, her beleaguered [...] "Daddy". Brice moved to NBC in December 1937, performing the <b>Snooks</b> routines {{as part of the}} Good News show, then back to CBS on Maxwell House Coffee Time, with the half-hour divided between the <b>Snooks</b> sketches and comedian Frank Morgan.|$|R
5000|$|In September 1944, Brice's {{longtime}} <b>Snooks</b> sketch writers, Philip Rapp and David Freedman, {{brought in}} partners, Arthur Stander and Everett Freeman, {{to develop an}} independent, half-hour comedy program. The program launched on CBS in 1944, moving to NBC in 1948, with Freeman producing. First called Post Toasties Time (named for the show's first sponsor), the show was renamed The Baby <b>Snooks</b> Show within short order, though in later years it was often known colloquially as Baby <b>Snooks</b> and Daddy. On the spinoff version of Baby <b>Snooks,</b> Hanley Stafford played Daddy, with Reed instead appearing as Daddy's employer, Mr. Weemish. Stafford eventually became the longest-running actor to portray the [...] "Daddy" [...] character.|$|R
50|$|The Baby <b>Snooks</b> Show was an American {{radio program}} {{starring}} comedian and Ziegfeld Follies alumna Fanny Brice as a mischievous {{young girl who}} was 40 years younger than the actress who played her when she first went on the air. The series began on CBS September 17, 1944, airing on Sunday evenings at 6:30pm as Post Toasties Time (for sponsor General Foods). The title soon changed to The Baby <b>Snooks</b> Show, and the series was sometimes called Baby <b>Snooks</b> and Daddy.|$|R
25|$|On February 29, 2012, the <b>Snook</b> Islands Natural Area {{was opened}} {{just to the}} north of Bryant Park.

Dolphins, manatees and an assortment of tropical birds are commonly seen including herons, ibises, egrets, oystercatchers, pelicans, cormorants and other waterfowl.|$|E
25|$|In 1883, George was ill and William <b>Snook</b> won {{the mile}} championship, though George {{recovered}} to lower his amateur record for 10 miles.

George prevailied {{in the race}} at 4:18, setting his third amateur mile record in the process.|$|E
25|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 7 May, <b>Snook</b> began quickly closing in on a convoy. Upon {{overtaking}} the enemy cargo ships, she launched four torpedoes, followed by three others five minutes later. The 4,363-ton cargo ship Hosei Maru was destroyed and several other ships possibly damaged. After destroying two armed trawlers in actions on 13 May and 16 May, <b>Snook</b> terminated her first patrol at Midway Island on 23 May.|$|E

25|$|<b>Snook</b> left Pearl Harbor for {{her third}} war patrol on 18 August and arrived off Marcus Island on 30 August to take {{reconnaissance}} photographs and stand lifeguard duty for the carrier air strikes of 1 September. Following the air strikes, the submarine resumed patrol {{and headed for}} the East China Sea where, in the early morning darkness of 13 September, she torpedoed and sank the 9,650-ton transport Yamato Maru. On 22 September, <b>Snook</b> intercepted and sank 715-ton Japanese cargo ship Katsurahama Maru departing from Dairen. The submarine terminated her third patrol at Pearl Harbor on 8 October.|$|E
50|$|<b>Snooks</b> {{proved so}} universally {{appealing}} that Brice and Stafford {{were invited to}} perform in character on the second installment of The Big Show, NBC's big-budget, last-ditch bid to keep classic radio variety programming alive amidst the television onslaught. <b>Snooks</b> tapped on hostess Tallulah Bankhead's door to ask about a career in acting, despite Daddy's telling her she already didn't have what it took. Later in the show, <b>Snooks</b> and Daddy appeared with fellow guest star Groucho Marx in a spoof of Marx's popular quiz-and-comedy show, You Bet Your Life.|$|R
50|$|The highwayman Robert <b>Snooks</b> was hanged {{and buried}} {{at the scene}} of his crime on Boxmoor for the robbery of a postboy on the Sparrows Herne Turnpike which crossed the trust land. <b>Snooks</b> was the last man to be {{executed}} in England for highway robbery on 11 March 1802. The Trustees placed a grave marker in 1904 at the approximate spot, and a subsequent footstone was added in 1994, as part of the trusts 400 year anniversary.

25|$|After {{shakedown}} {{training off}} the New England coast, <b>Snook</b> departed New London on 3 March 1943 and set sail for the Pacific. Following a 12-day stopover at Pearl Harbor, the submarine put to sea on 11 April {{and headed for}} the Yellow Sea and East China Sea for her first war patrol. Upon completion of mine planting in the Shanghai area, <b>Snook</b> continued on up the coast of China to the Yellow Sea. On the afternoon of 5 May, she sighted two freighters standing out of Dairen and took up the chase. She trailed both until after nightfall, then fired a spread of three torpedoes that quickly sank Kinko Maru. The lead freighter continued, unaware of the attack, until someone on the sinking ship sounded a whistle. At that point, the freighter began a series of frantic maneuvers to dodge two of Snooks torpedoes, then opened fire with her guns, forcing the submarine to withdraw out of range, returning shortly after and firing three torpedoes, one of which hit Daifuku Maru amidships and sank her. <b>Snook</b> then resumed patrol.|$|E
