5|$|By the 1850s {{the term}} {{crinoline}} was more usually {{applied to the}} fashionable silhouette provided by horsehair petticoats, and to the hoop <b>skirts</b> that replaced them in the mid-1850s. In form and function these hoop <b>skirts</b> were similar to the 16th- and 17th-century farthingale and to 18th-century panniers, in that they too enabled <b>skirts</b> to spread even wider and more fully.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} solve the problem of large trim and heel angles of the wrecked submarine, the double spherical shell {{rotating}} docking <b>skirt</b> is studied. According to the working principle of the rotating docking <b>skirt,</b> and the fixed <b>skirt,</b> the directional <b>skirt,</b> the angle <b>skirt</b> are simplified as the connecting rod. Therefore, the posture equation and kinematics model of the docking <b>skirt</b> are deduced, and according to the kinematics model, the angle of rotation of the directional <b>skirt</b> and the angle <b>skirt</b> is obtained when the wrecked submarine is in different trim and heel angles. Through the directional <b>skirt</b> and angle <b>skirt</b> with the matching rotation can make docking <b>skirt</b> interface in the 0 °~ 2 γ range within the rotation, to complete the docking <b>skirt</b> and the wrecked submarine docking. The MATLAB software is used to visualize the rotation angle of fixed <b>skirt</b> and directional <b>skirt,</b> which lays a good foundation for the development of the control of the double spherical shell rotating docking <b>skirt</b> in future...|$|R

5|$|The Laws of the Game specify {{that all}} players, {{regardless}} of gender, must {{wear the same}} kit, however in September 2008 the Dutch women's team FC de Rakt made international headlines by swapping its old strip {{for a new one}} featuring short <b>skirts</b> and tight-fitting shirts. This innovation, which had been requested by the team itself, was initially vetoed by the KNVB, Dutch football's governing body, but this decision was reversed when it was revealed that the FC de Rakt team were wearing hot pants under their <b>skirts,</b> and were therefore technically in compliance.|$|E
5|$|Formerly, men {{not wearing}} {{military}} uniform wore knee breeches of an 18th-century design. Women's evening dress included trains and tiaras or feathers {{in their hair}} (or both). The dress code governing formal court uniform and dress has progressively relaxed. After World WarI, when Queen Mary wished to follow fashion by raising her <b>skirts</b> {{a few inches from}} the ground, she requested a lady-in-waiting to shorten her own skirt first to gauge the king's reaction. King GeorgeV was horrified, so the queen kept her hemline unfashionably low. Following their accession in 1936, King GeorgeVI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth, allowed the hemline of daytime <b>skirts</b> to rise. Today, there is no official dress code. Most men invited to Buckingham Palace in the daytime choose to wear service uniform or lounge suits; a minority wear morning coats, and in the evening, depending on the formality of the occasion, black tie or white tie.|$|E

5|$|In some contexts, the {{traditional}} hooped crinoline {{may be seen}} as controversial, as in early 2015 when the University of Georgia reportedly requested hoop <b>skirts</b> not be worn to certain fraternity events due to their perceived association with Southern Belles and the slave-owning, upper socioeconomic classes of the American Deep South. The reason for the proposed ban was linked to the SAE racism incident earlier that year, with several articles noting it was a well-intentioned attempt to avoid the University of Georgia fraternities facing charges of racial insensitivity. It was noted that hoop <b>skirts</b> and crinolines had been worn by both black and white women of all classes and social standings during the historical period in question, and that despite popular associations, they were not exclusive to the image of the Southern Belle.|$|E

5|$|Petticoats made of {{horsehair}} crinoline appeared around 1839, proving {{so successful}} that the name 'crinoline' began to refer to supportive petticoats in general, rather than solely to the material. By 1847, crinoline fabric was {{being used as a}} stiffening for skirt linings, although English women preferred separate crinoline fabric petticoats which were beginning to collapse under the increasing weight of the <b>skirts.</b> One alternative to horsehair crinoline was the quilted petticoat stuffed with down or feathers, such as that reportedly worn in 1842 by Lady Aylesbury. However, quilted <b>skirts</b> were not widely produced until the early 1850s. In about 1849, it was possible to buy stiffened and corded cotton fabric for making petticoats, marketed as 'crinoline,' and designed as a substitute for the horsehair textile. The artificial crinoline with hoops did not emerge until the 1850s.|$|E

5|$|Women wore long dresses, blouses {{that came}} down to the knee, <b>skirts</b> and jackets with long or short sleeves, while women from wealthy {{families}} could wear purple scarves around their shoulders.
