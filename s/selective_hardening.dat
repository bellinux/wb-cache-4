New software techniques, based on selective application of redundancy, have shown remarkable fault coverage with reduced costs and overheads. However, the large number of different solutions provided by these techniques, and the costly process to assess their reliability, make the design space exploration a very difficult and time-consuming task. This paper proposes the integration of a multi-objective optimization tool with a software hardening environment to perform an automatic design space exploration in the search for the best trade-offs between reliability, cost, and performance. The first tool is commanded by a genetic algorithm which can simultaneously fulfill many design goals thanks {{to the use of the}} NSGA-II multi-objective algorithm.

40|$|An {{experimental}} investigation with 4 kW diodes {{laser system}} {{was carried out}} to {{study the effects of}} laser hardening process parameters on properties of P/M steels, based on prealloyed and diffusion-bonded powders. Eight different process parameters have been applied to optimize the process afterwards they have been set to two different compositions. The independent variables investigated have been: surface temperature, T, and laser travel speed (mm/min). The microstructural features of the laser hardened P/M steels were analyzed using LOM and the surface morphology has been characterized by SEM. Hardened depth both via hardness test and via optical measures were evaluated as well and used as responses for the ANOVA of the experimental data gathered. This work reveals the possibility to apply a <b>selective</b> and precise <b>hardening</b> treatment, like Laser Transformation hardening (LHT), to high-property P/M steel parts. Thanks to ANOVA analysis the correlation between energy density (ED) and optical dimension of treated zone has been identified. By increasing temperature and speed the density energy ED decreases, indeed at high temperature and speed the heated zone is larger. At the same speed, a temperature increase leads to a surface hardness decrease. A similar value of hardness depth (about 0. 8 mm) has been detected by means of hardness profiles. The result has been strengthened by scratch test. The parabolic zone presents a very fine martensitic structure on the top of laser trail, and bainite microstructure on transition zone, as literature related. The transition zone between the laser affected zone and the base metal exhibits a micro hardness gradient. It is also possible to notice some Cu diffusion from outer to inner zone. By comparison among LHT specimens and sintering-hardened and stress-relieved one, (characterized by similar chemical compositions) penetration depth and hardness values appear similar. Transformation Hardening (LTH) is a suitable process for producing hard surface, on defined spots of P/M components, through the action of a scanning laser beam. The short heating time enables to decrease part distortion and surface oxidation, in comparison with sinter hardened.

40|$|Commercial {{off-the-shelf}} microprocessors are {{the core}} of low-cost embedded systems due to their programmability and cost-effectiveness. Recent advances in electronic technologies have allowed remarkable improvements in their performance. However, they have also made microprocessors more susceptible to transient faults induced by radiation. These non-destructive events (soft errors), may cause a microprocessor to produce a wrong computation result or lose control of a system with catastrophic consequences. Therefore, soft error mitigation has become a compulsory requirement for {{an increasing number of}} applications, which operate from the space to the ground level. In this context, this paper uses the concept of <b>selective</b> <b>hardening,</b> which is aimed to design reduced-overhead and flexible mitigation techniques. Following this concept, a novel flexible version of the software-based fault recovery technique known as SWIFT-R is proposed. Our approach makes possible to select different registers subsets from the microprocessor register file to be protected on software. Thus, design space is enriched with a wide spectrum of new partially protected versions, which offer more flexibility to designers.

40|$|In late-age silicon, soft errors {{become an}} issue even for low-margin products. Since {{classical}} hardening techniques are associated with costs {{which may not be}} acceptable for such ICs, <b>selective</b> <b>hardening</b> which targets only a subset of all possible soft errors has been suggested. We propose a soft error selection method based on severity of an errorâs impact on system behavior. Some soft errors disturb the system in an acceptable way; no hardening is required against such soft errors. We suggest a definition of âacceptable misbehavior â consisting of two conditions: First, the system must return to the fault-free state after a given number of cycles k, called period of grace. During the period of grace, the system is allowed to deviate from its reference behavior. However, the second condition demands that the system misbehavior during the period of grace is acceptable, i. e., the deviation from the reference behavior must be limited. The definition of the acceptable misbehavior requires application-specific information; it is related to the concepts of error tolerance and threshold testing. We propose a methodology for identifying soft errors which are acceptable with respect to the period of grace paradigm. We envision low-cost soft-error hardening methods which guarantee acceptable misbehavior according to the period of grace paradigm (lightweight fault tolerance) rather than ensure total correctness as current fault tolerance approaches do. We report on a first case study which is shown to have acceptable misbehavior for some of the soft errors even without such hardening...|$|E
40|$|Software-based fault {{tolerance}} techniques are a low-cost way to protect processors against soft errors. However, they introduce significant overheads to the execution time and code size, which consequently increases the energy consumption. System operating with time or energy restrictions {{may not be able}} to use these techniques. For this reason, this work proposes new software-based {{fault tolerance}} techniques with lower overheads and similar fault coverage to state-of-the-art software techniques. Thus, they can meet the system constraints. In addition, the shorter execution time reduces the exposure time to radiation. Consequently, the reliability is higher for the same fault coverage. Techniques can work with error correction or error detection. Once detection is less costly than correction, this work focuses on software-based detection techniques. Firstly, a set of data-flow techniques called VAR is proposed. The techniques are based on general building rules to allow an exhaustive assessment, in terms of reliability and overheads, of different technique variations. The rules define how the technique duplicates the code and insert checkers. Each technique uses a different set of rules. Then, a control-flow technique called SETA (Software-only Error-detection Technique using Assertions) is introduced. Comparing SETA with a state-of-the-art technique, SETA is 11. 0 % faster and occupies 10. 3 % fewer memory positions. The most promising data-flow techniques are combined with the control-flow technique in order to protect both dataflow and control-flow of the target application. To go even further with the reduction of the overheads, methods to selective apply the proposed software techniques have been developed. For the data-flow techniques, instead of protecting all registers, only a set of selected registers is protected. The set is selected based on a metric that analyzes the code and rank the registers by their criticality. For the control-flow technique, two approaches are taken: (1) removing checkers from basic blocks: all the basic blocks are protected by SETA, but only selected basic blocks have checkers inserted, and (2) selectively protecting basic blocks: only a set of basic blocks is protected. The techniques and their selective versions are evaluated in terms of execution time, code size, fault coverage, and Mean Work To Failure (MWTF), which is a metric to measure the trade-off between fault coverage and execution time. Results show that was possible to reduce the overheads without affecting the fault coverage, and for a small reduction in the fault coverage it was possible to significantly reduce the overheads. Lastly, since the evaluation of all the possible combinations for <b>selective</b> <b>hardening</b> of every application takes too much time, this work uses a method to extrapolate the results obtained by simulation in order to find the parameters for the selective combination of data and control-flow techniques that are probably the best candidates to improve the trade-off between reliability and overheads...|$|E
40|$|As {{the feature}} size scales down to deep {{nanometer}} regimes, it has enabled the designers to fabricate chips with billions of transistors. The availability of such abundant computational resources {{on a single}} chip {{has made it possible}} to design chips with multiple computational cores, resulting in the inception of Chip Multiprocessors (CMPs). The widespread use of CMPs has resulted in a paradigm shift from computation-centric architectures to communication-centric architectures. With the continuous {{increase in the number of}} cores that can be fabricated on a single chip, communication between the cores has become a crucial factor in its overall performance. Network-on-Chip (NoC) paradigm has evolved into a standard on-chip interconnection network that can efficiently handle the strict communication requirements between the cores on a chip. The components of an NoC include routers, that facilitate routing of data between multiple cores and links that provide raw bandwidth for data traversal. While diminishing feature size has made it possible to integrate billions of transistors on a chip, the advantage of multiple cores has been marred with the waning reliability of transistors. Components of an NoC are not immune to the increasing number of hard faults and soft errors emanating due to extreme miniaturization of transistor sizes. Faults in an NoC result in significant ramifications such as isolation of healthy cores, deadlock, data corruption, packet loss and increased packet latency, all of which have a severe impact on the performance of a chip. This has stimulated the need to design resilient and fault tolerant NoCs. This thesis handles the issue of fault tolerance in NoC routers. Within the NoC router, the focus is specifically on the router pipeline that is responsible for the smooth flow of packets. In this thesis we propose two different fault tolerant architectures that can continue to operate in the presence of faults. In addition to these two architectures, we also propose a new reliability metric for evaluating soft error tolerant techniques targeted towards the control logic of the NoC router pipeline. First, we present Shield, a fault tolerant NoC router architecture that is capable of handling both hard faults and soft errors in its pipeline. Shield uses techniques such as spatial redundancy, exploitation of idle resources and bypassing a faulty resource to achieve hard fault tolerance. The use of these techniques reveals that Shield is six times more reliable than baseline-unprotected router. To handle soft errors, Shield uses <b>selective</b> <b>hardening</b> technique that includes hardening specific gates of the router pipeline to increase its soft error tolerance. To quantify soft error tolerance improvement, we propose a new metric called Soft Error Improvement Factor (SEIF) and use it to show that Shieldâs soft error tolerance is three times better than that of the baseline-unprotected router. Then, we present Soft Error Tolerant NoC Router (STNR), a low overhead fault tolerating NoC router architecture that can tolerate soft errors in the control logic of its pipeline. STNR achieves soft error tolerance based on the idea of dual execution, comparison and rollback. It exploits idle cycles in the router pipeline to perform redundant computation and comparison necessary for soft error detection. Upon the detection of a soft error, the pipeline is rolled back to the stage that got affected by the soft error. Salient features of STNR include high level of soft error detection, fault containment and minimum impact on latency. Simulations show that STNR has been able to detect all injected single soft errors in the router pipeline. To perform a quantitative comparison between STNR and other existing similar architectures, we propose a new reliability metric called Metric for Soft error Tolerance (MST) in this thesis. MST is unique in the aspect that it encompasses four crucial factors namely, soft error tolerance, area overhead, power overhead and pipeline latency overhead into a single metric. Analysis using MST shows that STNR provides better reliability while incurring low overhead compared to existing architectures...|$|E
