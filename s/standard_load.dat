5|$|The {{first four}} M-class shipsM, N, O, and Pwere 178 meters long at the waterline, and 183 meters long overall. They had {{a beam of}} 17 meters and a draft of 5.42 meters standard, 7.25 meters forward, and 6.03 meters aft. The ships had a {{designed}} displacement of 8,500metric tons, but displaced 7,800tons at <b>standard</b> <b>load</b> and 10,400tons fully laden. The ships had a crew of 28 officers and 892 men. They were designed to carry one picket boat, a barge, a launch, and two cutters.|$|E
25|$|The keels were wooden boats with {{a pointed}} stern, {{so that the}} bow and stern looked almost the same. They were of shallow draught so that when fully loaded they drew only {{four and a half}} feet. The keels were forty feet long and at least 19 feet wide amidships: a very broad configuration. In 1266 the <b>standard</b> <b>load</b> of a keel was set at 20 chaldrons (wagonloads) or {{approximately}} 17 tons. After 1497 the keel load was frequently increased, until in 1635 it was set at 21.1 tons. A chaldron was a horse-drawn wagon containing 17 cwt of coal. Keels were supposed to be measured by the Kings Commissioners and given a load mark to show when they were full. The keels had a single mast with a square sail attached to a yardarm and two large oars. They had no rudder and so a large sweep was used for steering when the keel was under sail. The oars were used to row when the wind was not favourable. There were also two iron-shod poles for polling the keel through any shallows. The floor of the hold was only two feet below the gunwale to allow for easy loading. The coal was piled high above the top of the hold with wooden boards used to prevent the cargo from sliding. Each keel was manned by a skipper, two crewmen and a boy, known as a ‘pee dee’. The meaning of this title is unknown.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the comparison of}} the effect of different standard loadings on a set of reinforced concrete bridge decks using the finite-element method. The parameters investigated include the aspect ratio (span/width) and type of loading. The investigations are conducted on two lane slab bridge decks of span 5 m to 9. 5 m and two lane T beam bridge decks of span 7. 5 m to 20 m. A total of 36 bridge models were analyzed. The variation of different critical structural response parameters such as deflection, longitudinal bending moment, transverse moment, shear force and torsional moments are evaluated for IRC loading (IRC Class A and 70 R loadings), AASHTO loading (HL 93) and Euro <b>standard</b> <b>loading</b> (LM 1). The results shows that the maximum difference in deflection and longitudinal bending moment for the two IRC <b>standard</b> <b>loading</b> ranges from 5 to 15 %. While the difference between corresponding values for the AASHTO loading in the range of 5 to 17 %. The maximum axle <b>load</b> of euro <b>standard</b> <b>loading</b> is found to be 2. 2 times higher than IRC class A loading maximum axle load hence the values of structural response parameters are increased by 1. 7 to 1. 8 times. Therefore {{there is a need for}} adopting simplified and more realistic <b>standard</b> <b>loads</b> in the future...|$|R
