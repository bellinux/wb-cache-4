5|$|Before {{the storm}} struck, Honduras was facing {{decreased}} food supplies due to ongoing El Niño conditions. The economy {{had been growing}} at a rate similar to the previous year until Mitch struck, and was largely dependent on exports. About 73% {{of the population was}} living in poverty when the storm struck. Hurricane Mitch <b>set</b> <b>back</b> the economies of various countries in the region, including Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and El Salvador, after they had improved throughout the 1990s.|$|E

Carey's run attempted to return John Constantine to his roots, with the title largely <b>set</b> <b>back</b> in London, and featuring many characters from former runs on the title. Mike Carey also has the honour {{of being the first}} Liverpudlian to write the Liverpudlian character. His was the second longest run by any single author on the title, second only to Garth Ennis.|$|E

5|$|Procellariids {{generally}} have weak legs that are <b>set</b> <b>back,</b> and many species move around on land by {{resting on the}} breast and pushing themselves forward, often {{with the help of}} their wings. The exception to this is the two species of giant petrel, which like the albatrosses, have strong legs used to feed on land (see below). The feet of shearwaters are set far back on the body for swimming and are of little use when on the ground.|$|E

5|$|The Komnenoi {{also made}} a {{significant}} contribution to the history of Asia Minor. By reconquering much of the region, the Komnenoi <b>set</b> <b>back</b> the advance of the Turks in Anatolia by more than two centuries. In the process, they planted the foundations of the Byzantine successor states of Nicaea, Epirus and Trebizond. Meanwhile, their extensive programme of fortifications has left an enduring mark upon the Anatolian landscape, which can still be appreciated today.|$|E

5|$|The Norman Church of St Peter (shown right) {{was built}} in 1320 and rebuilt in the 14th and 15th centuries in the Perpendicular Gothic style. In 1952 it was made a Grade I listed building. The four-stage tower is a {{prominent}} landmark, with <b>set</b> <b>back</b> buttresses and a pierced parapet. The church was altered in 1978–1979 and has a new garden developed for the Millennium.|$|E
5|$|The {{plots of}} the unmade serials also vary. A theme of a {{civilisation}} {{where women are}} dominant was proposed twice—once for The Hidden Planet, and again for The Prison in Space. In some cases, elements of unmade serials were adapted, or were moved from one serial to another; for example, Song of the Space Whale {{was intended to be}} the introduction of Vislor Turlough until it was repeatedly <b>set</b> <b>back,</b> causing Mawdryn Undead to be Turlough's first appearance.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Pei {{designed}} a new museum for Luxembourg, the Musée d'art moderne Grand-Duc Jean, {{commonly known as}} the Mudam. Drawing from the original shape of the Fort Thüngen walls where the museum was located, Pei planned to remove a portion of the original foundation. Public resistance to the historical loss forced a revision of his plan, however, and the project was nearly abandoned. The size of the building was halved, and it was <b>set</b> <b>back</b> from the original wall segments to preserve the foundation. Pei was disappointed with the alterations, but remained involved in the building process even during construction.|$|E

5|$|Born Wei Junluo, Shangguan Yunzhu fled to Shanghai {{when her}} {{hometown}} Jiangyin {{was attacked by}} the Japanese. In Shanghai she became a drama and film actress, and her career took off {{after the end of}} the Second Sino-Japanese War. She starred in several prominent leftist films such as Spring River Flows East, Crows and Sparrows, and Women Side by Side. After the Communist victory in mainland China in 1949, her career was <b>set</b> <b>back</b> when her husband was embroiled in the anti-capitalist Five-anti Campaign, but she later portrayed a wide variety of characters in many films.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Lily was a {{short-lived}} Category 1 hurricane of August 1971 that devastated {{the city of}} Puerto Vallarta in Mexico. Forming from an area of cloudiness associated with former Atlantic Tropical Storm Chloe, the storm slowly intensified, building to peak intensity just before landfall northwest of Manzanillo, Colima on August 31. The hurricane quickly weakened and became extratropical. After leaving land, the extratropical remnants of Lily dissipated on September 1. The storm's movement close to land affected shipping due to the limited warning, which was partially <b>set</b> <b>back</b> due to difficulties in clarifying the hurricane's position on radar from reconnaissance aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Kirby Muxloe Castle is {{positioned}} <b>set</b> <b>back</b> {{from the village}} of Kirby Muxloe on low-lying land; the castle's gardens and orchard probably stood to the north and west of the current site. John Goodall suggests that the earlier residence on the site was built around two courts, one of which survives within the later castle, with the other on the north-west side of the site. The historian Anthony Emery, however, argues that the earlier manor was similar in size and shape to the current castle: he suggests that it was fortified and was protected by a moat similar to that seen today. The foundations of the first residence discovered between 1912 and 1913 were left uncovered after the excavations and remain visible in the castle lawns.|$|E

5|$|Northumbria's {{southern}} frontier with Mercia {{ran across}} England, from the Humber in the east, following the River Ouse and the River Don, to the Mersey in the west. Some archaeological evidence, the Roman Rig dyke, near modern Sheffield, appears {{to show that}} it was a defended border, with large earthworks <b>set</b> <b>back</b> from the frontier. The Nico Ditch, to the south of modern Manchester, has been cited in this context, though it has also been argued that it was simply a boundary marker without fortifications. In the far north, the evidence is less clear, and it appears that authority lay with sub-kings, perhaps including native British rulers. The family of Ecgfrith's general Berht may have been one such dynasty of under-kings.|$|E
5|$|Starting from George M. Ewing's {{original}} design {{of an office}} tower, Pietro Belluschi and George M. Ewing Co. turned the Rohm and Haas Corporate Headquarters into a , nine-story low horizontal block. At the corner of 6th Street and Market Street, two blocks away from Independence Hall, the Rohm and Haas Corporate Headquarters front facade runs parallel along 6th Street looking towards the Independence Mall. The reinforced concrete framed building sits on flaring concrete columns and is <b>set</b> <b>back</b> from the street by a raised plaza. The landscaped plaza cuts {{through the middle of}} the ground level of the building, opening up to a larger plaza with a fountain and small pool. The plaza behind the building allows public access to an alley that leads to Seventh Street.|$|E
5|$|The Pulaski {{station was}} {{proposed}} in 1980 and constructed from 1987 to 1993. When the station opened in 1993, it spurred commercial {{development in the}} surrounding area {{and led to a}} parking controversy on nearby residential streets. Pulaski consists of an elevated island platform above a station house which is <b>set</b> <b>back</b> from Pulaski Road. The station also includes a bus terminal and a park and ride lot. Nearly 1.4 million passengers boarded Orange Line trains at Pulaski in 2010. Trains serve Pulaski approximately every ten minutes during rush hour but are less frequent at other times. In addition to offering train service, Pulaski also connects to several CTA bus routes.|$|E
