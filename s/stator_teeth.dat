50|$|The {{squirrel-cage}} rotor consists of laminated steel {{in the core}} with evenly spaced bars of copper or aluminum placed axially around the periphery, permanently shorted at the ends by the end rings. This simple and rugged construction makes it the favorite for most applications. The assembly has a twist: the bars are slanted, or skewed, to reduce magnetic hum and slot harmonics and to reduce the tendency of locking. Housed in the stator, the rotor and <b>stator</b> <b>teeth</b> can lock {{when they are in}} equal number and the magnets position themselves equally apart, opposing rotation in both directions. Bearings at each end mount the rotor in its housing, with one end of the shaft protruding to allow the attachment of the load. In some motors, there is an extension at the non-driving end for speed sensors or other electronic controls. The generated torque forces motion through the rotor to the load.|$|E

When the <b>stator</b> <b>tooth</b> coronas are unsaturated, the notching guidance given by analytical method can be testified effective in cutting down the cogging torque by FEM.

40|$|Torque ripple {{has been}} a major problem for the {{permanent}} magnet (PM) machine. It is discussed focusing on the magnetic circuit of the PM machine. Since it is known the relationship between the torque ripple and the magnetic energy that is stored in the magnetic field along the air gap of the PM machine, fluctuation in the magnetic energy was initially revealed. New tooth geometry was obtained by drilling holes into <b>stator</b> <b>tooth</b> to modify this variation in the magnetic energy and the fluctuation in torque. Thus, a new <b>stator</b> <b>tooth</b> design in outer rotor surface-mounted permanent magnet (OR-SPM) machine was proposed to minimizing the torque ripple in this study.

50|$|Direct {{hydrogen}} cooling {{is employed}} in the stator terminals. The rotor forging is of nickel chromium molybdenum vanadium steel having a minimum yield point of 33.2 ton/in.2. The shaft end which connects to the turbine is deferentially tempered to give additional strength to withstand the severe forces which could be applied under fault conditions on the generator. The first three critical speeds are arranged to be below the running speed. The hydrogen-cooled rotor conductors are formed from silver-bearing hard drawn copper tube. Two tubes in parallel form one conductor and there are six conductors per slot except for the slots adjacent to the pole centres, which contain five. The generator is ventilated by cold gas fed {{to a number of}} radial ducts at the slipring end of the core, which communicate with the axial vent holes in the core and <b>stator</b> <b>teeth.</b> After passing through the axial holes the gas is discharged into the ‘air’ gap through further radial ducts at the turbine end of the core. The gas discharged from the core passes along the ‘air’ gap, together with the hot gas discharged from the outlet holes in the rotor body, to the region between the end windings and a baffle at the slipring end, and thence through one half of each axial cooler to the blower intake. After leaving the blower, the gas is passed through the other halves of the coolers and is delivered to the various inlet regions of the stator core and rotor. Gas is fed to the turbine end of the rotor through axial holes machined in the hub of the blower rotor from an annulus formed between the end bracket and the blower outlet diffuser. Large diameter tubes passing longitudinally through the stator frame connect this annulus to the extreme end section at the slipring end, from which the slipring end of the rotor is fed. The three-stage axial blower mounted on the generator shaft comprises a shaft-mounted sleeve upon which is mounted the bladed rotor disc, a bladed stator casing, a diffuser and an inlet fairing.|$|E
40|$|Interior {{permanent}} magnet (IPM) synchronous machines can experience large harmonic eddy-current {{losses in the}} <b>stator</b> <b>teeth</b> under flux-weakening operation, significantly depressing the efficiency of these machines at high operating speeds. This paper presents a new analytical/finite-element hybrid design approach to reduce the harmonic eddy-current losses in IPM machine <b>stator</b> <b>teeth</b> during flux-weakening operation. The proposed technique achieves this objective by three steps: 1) developing an analytical index for the harmonic eddy-current losses in IPM machine stator teeth; 2) designing the spatial distribution of the rotor MMF to minimize the analytical index; and 3) synthesizing the rotor geometry to implement the desired rotor MMF function while maintaining the basic machine characteristics unchanged.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze how a {{permanent}} magnet linear generator for wave power behaves when the stator slots are closed. The usual design of stator geometry is to use open slots to maintain a low magnetic leakage flux between the <b>stator</b> <b>teeth.</b> By doing this, harmonics are induced in the magnetic flux density in the air-gap due to slotting. The closed slots are designed to cause saturation, to keep the permeability low. This reduces the slot harmonics in the magnetic flux density, but will also increase the flux leakage between the <b>stator</b> <b>teeth.</b> An analytical model has been created to study the flux through the closed slots and the result compared with finite element simulations. The outcome shows a reduction of the cogging force and a reduction of the harmonics of the magnetic flux density in the air-gap. It also shows a small increase of the total magnetic flux entering the stator and an increased magnetic flux leakage through the closed slots...|$|E

VOSS NOVEMBER 2013 Radial and {{peripheral}} {{displacement of}} <b>stator</b> <b>teeth</b> in electrical machines {{is known to}} be the cause of undesired vibration which leads to noise. This thesis serves to investigate the possibility of physically measuring the radial displacement of <b>stator</b> <b>teeth</b> caused by electromagnetic forces which, to the author’s knowledge, has not yet been achieved. A simplified practical approach is adopted in order to address the inherent difficulties attached to this problem, and the measurement of displacement is done by means of an experimental rig where a tooth is subjected to magnetic force acting over an air gap. Three experiments are carried out, each comprising ten tests, the results of which are compared in order to gain some idea as to the magnitudes of displacement which can be expected over a range of applied air gap flux densities. The aim of this work is to observe the displacement response of magnetised EM core material when acted upon by forces, and to see if the measured results agree with the elastic displacement predicted by a wellknown formula. It will be shown that although the measured results are in the same range as the predicted results, there is a deviation from the predicted linearity due to certain characteristics of the force rig, which are explained. The chosen measurement method is capacitive displacement and is shown to be a viable alternative to the more commonly used search coils and vibrometers in past literatures, especially when measuring displacements on the nano-scale. In addition, this study shows the importance of using 3 D finite element software to simulate the electromagnetic model when saturation is present in the core of the test specimen.

40|$|Abstract—The {{interior}} permanent-magnet (IPM) {{synchronous motor}} {{is characterized by}} a high rotor anisotropy. Such an anisotropy is the cause of a high harmonic content of the air-gap ﬂux density distribution, almost independent of the main ﬂux. As a consequence, there are ﬂuctuations of the ﬂux density in the stator iron and, consequently, eddy-current iron losses. This aspect is prominently evident during ﬂux-weakening operations, when the armature current weakens the permanent magnet ﬂux and the motor runs above the base speed. This paper presents a complete study of such a phenomenon, including an analytical model and a ﬁnite element validation, as well as an experimental conﬁrmation of the predicted <b>stator</b> <b>tooth</b> ﬂux waveforms. Finally, some suggestions are given in order to design an IPM motor exhibiting reduced iron losses during all operating conditions...|$|R
