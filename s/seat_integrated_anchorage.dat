40|$|In {{recent years}} an {{increasing}} interest has evolved concerning <b>seat</b> <b>integrated</b> safety belts in cars, regarding both 3 - and 4 -point belts in various configurations. One safety advantage of <b>seat</b> <b>integrated</b> safety belts {{appears in the}} case of so-called small overlap crashes. One consequence of a small overlap crash can be that the colliding cars strike each other's sides hitting both the A- and B-pillar. Hence, the A- as well as the B-pillar are pushed inwards and backwards. In this case, belt anchor points on the B-pillar may also be pushed backwards and the belt will be stretched over the occupant. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to investigate <b>seat</b> <b>integrated</b> safety belt configurations that may involve a seat structure design that intentionally deforms and absorbs energy during a crash. Common 3 -point configurations were used as references. The aim was to investigate how the physical properties influence the interaction of the seat back frame and the safety belt. Numerical simulations were carried out using the explicit LS-DYNA FE-analysis software. A FE-model of a seat structure, floor pan and B-pillar was established. A 50 th percentile Hybrid III FE-dummy model was used as occupant and for studying the biomechanical responses. Different physical properties of the seat structure and different belt load limit forces were used as parametric variables. Only frontal crashes were considered. Responses concerning chest deflection, head- and chest displacement, change of pelvis angle, pelvis submarining tendency, lap- and torso belt forces, seat back frame deflection, ride-down efficiency, seat structure natural frequency, upper neck loads and neck injury criteria were studied. The results indicate that the belt-webbing distribution between the lap and the torso belts via a slip-ring and in combination with a non-rigid seat back frame increases the ride-down efficiency compared to a system with no belt-webbing distribution. Further, the combined use of different energy absorption mechanisms influences the biomechanical response as well as the structural response of an integrated safety belt configuration. An optimal solution with respect to multiple objectives requires a proper combination of parameters. Beside the optimisation of traditional biomechanical responses, the multiple objectives can be the minimisation of weight and cost as well as optimal control of passenger kinematics. The present study will hopefully create a basis for future research and possibly for the design of <b>seat</b> <b>integrated</b> safety belts. Godkänd; 2006; 20070109 (haneit...|$|R

40|$|In a rollover, the lap {{part of the}} 3 -point belt {{certainly}} restrains {{the occupant}} from being fully ejected out of the vehicle, however the upper torso of the far side occupant may slip out of the shoulder belt. In this study the combination of reversed 3 -point belt geometry (<b>seat</b> <b>integrated),</b> inboard torso side-support and buckle pretensioner were evaluated regarding the ability to better restrain the upper torso to the seat to prevent head-to-interior impacts. The method of evaluation, proposed and used in this paper, was a new sled test method simulating full-scale tripped rollovers along the longitudinal axis during the initial phase of tripping, the airborne phase and the first ground impact. The roof was assumed in the tests {{to be able to}} withstand the ground impact. Since car occupants normally are seated with a certain kyfosis and may straighten and elongate their spine, standard HIII ATDs were modified with 3 D-flexible lumbar spines and used in both front seat positions. As a result, the rollover sled test method worked properly with good repeatability. While the head of the non-leading side (far-side) dummy impacted the inner roof in the standard 3 -point belt configuration, the <b>seat</b> <b>integrated</b> 3 -point belt with reversed geometry and buckle pretensioner showed ability to restrain the torso from moving inboard and towards the roof during the rollover tests...|$|R

40|$|The common 3 -point {{safety belt}} usually has some anchor {{points on the}} car body. However, it is also {{possible}} to mount all anchor points on the seat structure. In general, different studies show some advantages with <b>seat</b> <b>integrated</b> safety belts. Thus, further investigations are motivated. One safety advantage appears in the case of so-called small overlap crashes. Also, the ride-down distance of the occupant may be increased by allowing controlled energy absorbing deformation of the seat structure. Further, methods {{that can be used to}} minimize the weight of <b>seat</b> structures with <b>integrated</b> safety belts are of interest. A complement to full scale crash tests is the use of numerical models and numerical simulation, typically finite element (FE) analysis. Research and development of numerical models are constantly improved. In general, any type of numerical model needs to be evaluated to physical tests in order to make it behave as realistic as possible. The purpose of the present thesis was to study <b>seat</b> structures with <b>integrated</b> safety belts with a design that may intentionally deform and absorb energy during a crash. The approach was to use numerical models and numerical simulation and to investigate both biomechanical and mechanical responses. The aim is to create a basis for future research in the design of <b>seat</b> structures with <b>integrated</b> safety belts. In Paper A and B, parametric studies comparing integrated 3 - and 4 -point safety belt configurations relative to common 3 -point configurations are presented. A number of mechanical parameters were varied. Biomechanical responses of the Hybrid III (HIII) FE-dummy model used as occupant were studied. In Paper C, the creation and evaluation of a human FE-model of a 50 th percentile male is presented. The evaluation was made to results from studies with post mortem human subjects (PMHS). In Paper D, a conceptual methodology for mass minimization of a property based model (PBM) of a seat structure with an integrated 3 -point safety belt configuration and with a HIII FE-dummy model used as occupant is presented. Both mechanical and biomechanical constraints were used as well as different start values of the design variables. In Paper E, the evaluation of FE-models of simplified <b>seat</b> structures with <b>integrated</b> 3 -point safety belt configurations to a number of full scale experiments in the form of sled tests with a HIII crash test dummy used as occupant is presented. The studies in Paper A and B reveals that with an adequate combination of mechanical properties of the seat structure it should be possible to achieve equal or lower biomechanical responses of the occupant with a <b>seat</b> <b>integrated</b> safety belt configuration compared to a common. The <b>seat</b> <b>integrated</b> 4 -point configurations in these studies performed poorer than the corresponding 3 -point in general. An important issue is that belt- webbing distribution between lap and torso belt parts is allowed. The study in Paper C showed that the created and evaluated human FE-model could be used to further explore injury producing mechanisms. However, in order to achieve a fully evaluated human FE-model there is a need for both further development and more reference tests with PMHS. In Paper D, the study showed that the presented methodology may be used in a concept phase of a design process. The optimization runs with different start values of the design variables found a number of different local minima instead of one global minimum. The dynamics of the system was highly non-linear. To find an optimal combination of mechanical properties and biomechanical responses, a compromise appears to be needed. The evaluated FE-model in Paper E may be used in simulations that consider both biomechanical and mechanical responses. The majority of the simulated responses showed good agreement with or slightly underestimated the experimental responses. Some issues of the FE-model suggest areas for further development. The FE-model could be used as a base for further studies. Godkänd; 2008; 20080404 (ysko...|$|R

5000|$|The present tavern building, {{restored}} by the Hanover Tavern Foundation, {{dates from}} 1791 with early 19th century and late 20th century additions and is {{listed on the}} Virginia Landmarks Register and the National Register of Historic Places.

By 1953, the tavern building was well-worn and possibly on its last legs. A group of young actors from New York bought the building and 3.5 acres with the intention of starting a dinner theater.
