25|$|The coolant {{is pumped}} around the primary circuit by {{powerful}} pumps.

25|$|Operation of an {{evaporator}} {{represents a}} costly consumption of main boiler steam, thus fuel.

Varying the vacuum under which the evaporator works, and thus the boiling point of the feedwater, may optimise production for either maximum output, or better efficiency, depending on which is needed at the time. Greatest output is achieved when the evaporator operates at near atmospheric pressure and a high temperature (for <b>saturated</b> <b>steam</b> this will be at a limit of 100°C), which may then have an efficiency of 0.87kg of feedwater produced for each kg of steam supplied.|$|E

40|$|In paper Consider {{the general}} {{principle}} {{of the formation of}} clusters. Were substantiated the boundaries of occurrence of the different aggregate states. For the water were calculated the energies of binary relations and on this basis shows how is <b>saturate</b> <b>steam</b> and superheated liquid. The clusters are formed due to the interaction of atoms or molecules with one another, when the energy of this interaction is considerably greater than the internal energy of the thermal motion. Formation of clusters leads to decrease of the concentration of free vapor molecules and thus to reduce of the pressure on the vessel wall. Therefore, at the first pressure in the compression process can be considered approximately constant, and the compression process can be regarded as isobaric. Consequently, heat dissipation in an environment where two-phase system is formed, occurs only due to isobaric compression, and reducing the concentration of free form of vapor molecules determined by creating cluster structures. In the formation of cluster structures there is exist radiant heat, which is absorbed by the walls of the vessel, and thus the pressure is absent. Supersaturated vapor occurs by increasing the gas temperature during its compression when the clusters begin to form, and superheated liquid occurs when the fully formed cluster structure grows up and the pressure is inversely proportional to the cube of the distance between the particles in the liquid state with a slight compression. The modern view of the liquid state is an intermediate state between a gas and a solid, based on the formation of cluster structures and allows clearly justify all the properties of the liquid state, and especially the cause of the superheated liquid and supersaturated vapor. ...|$|R

60|$|The {{cause of}} these rapid and heavy showers is simple enough. The trade-wind, at this {{season of the}} year, is <b>saturated</b> with <b>steam</b> from the ocean which it has crossed; and the least {{disturbance}} in its temperature, from ascending hot air or descending cold, precipitates the steam in a sudden splash of water, out of a cloud, if there {{happens to be one}} near; if not, out of the clear air. Therefore it is that these showers, when they occur in the daytime, are most common about noon; simply because then the streams of hot air rise most frequently and rapidly, to struggle with the cooler layers aloft. There is thunder, of course, in the West Indies, continuous and terrible. But it occurs after midsummer, at the breaking up of the dry season and coming on of the wet.|$|R

5000|$|The {{next stage}} in the process is to boil water and make steam. The {{goal is to make}} the heat flow as {{completely}} as possible from the heat source to the water. The water is confined in a restricted space heated by the fire. The steam produced has lower density than the water and therefore will accumulate at the highest level in the vessel; its temperature will remain at boiling point and will only increase as pressure increases. Steam in this state (in equilibrium with the liquid water which is being evaporated within the boiler) is named [...] "saturated steam". For example, <b>saturated</b> <b>steam</b> at atmospheric pressure boils at 100 C. <b>Saturated</b> <b>steam</b> taken from the boiler may contain entrained water droplets, however a well designed boiler will supply virtually [...] "dry" [...] <b>saturated</b> <b>steam,</b> with very little entrained water. Continued heating of the <b>saturated</b> <b>steam</b> will bring the steam to a [...] "superheated" [...] state, where the steam is heated to a temperature above the saturation temperature, and no liquid water can exist under this condition. Most reciprocating steam engines of the 19th century used <b>saturated</b> <b>steam,</b> however modern steam power plants universally use superheated steam which allows higher steam cycle efficiency.|$|E
30|$|Steamflooding is {{a process}} in which steam is {{injected}} into the reservoir that it transfers its heat to the rock and fluids. Generally, there are four separated zones in a steamflooding process namely (1) oil bank, (2) hot water bank, (3) solvent bank, and (4) steam zone (Hong 1994). This process occurs while the oil bank moves toward the production well. After the pore is <b>saturated</b> with <b>steam,</b> the steam tends to move {{to the top of the}} reservoir since it is lighter than reservoir fluids. Therefore, in a continuous injection process, the steam will breakthrough early to the production well. Even though the steam injection rate remains constant, the oil production rate decreases while the steam oil ratio (SOR) increases. Because the steam is produced by way of burning natural gases, in such a process the CO 2 emission per produced-oil volume also increases.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{the report}} stated that both {{superheater}} types had serious drawbacks, with the Schmidt system featuring a damper {{control on the}} superheater header that caused hot gases to condense into sulphuric acid, which caused pitting and subsequent weakening of the superheater elements. Leakage of gases was also commonplace between the elements and the header, and maintenance was difficult without removal of the horizontally-arranged assembly. The Robinson version suffered from temperature variations caused by <b>saturated</b> and superheated <b>steam</b> chambers being adjacent, causing material stress, and had similar access problems as the Schmidt type.|$|R
