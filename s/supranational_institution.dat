While long present in studies of the Court of Justice of the EU, ‘activism’ has rarely been examined systematically in the context of analyses of other <b>supranational</b> <b>institutions.</b> This contribution offers a definition of ‘supranational institutional activism’, examines its analytical usefulness in relation to other concepts such as ‘entrepreneurship’ and through the lens of a number of political science and EU integration theories and analytical approaches. The specific analytical insights derived from the disciplines of political science, history and legal scholarship of the twelve articles of this special edition on ‘supranational institutional activism’ are also considered. While the powers and roles of EU <b>supranational</b> <b>institutions</b> have been examined in numerous studies, this article presents a concept that can contribute to a more systematic and comprehensive understanding of the contribution of these entities to EU policy making and European integration...|$|R

40|$|The {{twenty years}} since {{the signing of the}} Maastricht Treaty have been marked by an {{integration}} paradox: although the scope of European Union (EU) activity has increased at an unprecedented pace, this increase has largely taken place in the absence of significant new transfers of power to <b>supranational</b> <b>institutions</b> along traditional lines. Conventional theories of European integration struggle to explain this paradox because they equate integration with the empowerment of specific <b>supranational</b> <b>institutions</b> under the traditional Community method. New governance scholars, meanwhile, have not filled this intellectual void, preferring instead to focus on specific deviations from the Community method rather than theorizing about the evolving nature of the European project. The New Intergovernmentalism challenges established assumptions about how member states behave, what <b>supranational</b> <b>institutions</b> want, and where the dividing line between high and low politics is located, and develops a new theoretical framework known as the new intergovernmentalism. The fifteen chapters in this volume by leading political scientists, political economists, and legal scholars explore the scope and limits of the new intergovernmentalism as a theory of post-Maastricht integration and draw conclusions about the profound state of political disequilibrium in which the EU operates. This book is of relevance to EU specialists seeking new ways of thinking about European integration and policy-making, and general readers who wish to understand {{what has happened to the}} EU in the two troubled decades since 1992...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{explains}} why institutions matter for a deep integration process, {{as illustrated by}} the liberalization of Non-Tariff Barriers (NTBs) in Europe. We argue that deep trade liberalization requires supranational institutions of deeper integration that permit enforcement, surveillance, and adjudication. To support the claim, we develop a simple model showing why mutual recognition of norms and testing procedures, coupled with a <b>supranational</b> <b>institution</b> can shape the equilibrium level of NTBs in every member state. Member states host special-interest groups that make political contributions to influence their respective government's choice of NTBs. Politicians maximize a realistic welfare function that favours contributions over consumer's social welfare. The <b>supranational</b> <b>institution</b> drains the incentive to lobby for NTBs. The paper discusses the structure of protection that emerges in the equilibrium, stressing how the lobbies' contributions vary with the effectiveness of the <b>supranational</b> <b>institution</b> in reducing NTBs in the final policy outcome. We then use the model to explain the liberalization of NTBs in the EU. economic integration; endogenous protection; International Economics; Trade; European Union;...|$|E
