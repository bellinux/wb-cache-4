5000|$|The first {{distinctive}} West Point cadet sword {{appeared in}} late 1840. A small sword with <b>straight</b> <b>cross</b> quillon, shield shaped langets, wire wrapped grips and an urn pommel. This sword {{was made by}} the Ames Manufacturing Company, Chicopee, Massachusetts. It is believed that cadet swords were purchased by the Ordance Department for the U.S. Military Academy and V.M.I. In any event, cadet swords were inspected and die-stamped with the inspector's initials, the initials [...] "US" [...] and the year of acceptance. Hickox points out that V.M.I ordered the sword before the U.S. Military Academy did, and requested that the V.M.I. sword be marked appropriately, leaving the choice to N.P. Ames. Ames did not furnish cadet swords to the Academy prior to April 1840. The original order for 100 swords was not recorded. Hickox can only show 2 delivery dates to the Academy for cadet swords, 100 on 30 November 1849 for $11.00 each, and another 100 on 25 July 1856 for $10.00 each.

40|$|Abstract [...] Short {{backfire}} antennas {{have been}} developed with single impedance bandwidth characteristics. In this paper, a new cross dipole excitation structure for short backfire antenna is presented that achieves dual impedance band width characteristics. The cross dipole excitation structure consists of H-shaped and <b>straight</b> <b>cross</b> dipoles. The cross dipole structure is mounted on the slotted coaxial line. The antenna is developed on elliptical ground plane with dielectric rim. A cost effective design is proposed to get metallic rim from the dielectric rim. The pertinent features of this short backfire antenna are (i) dual impedance band width (ii) reconfigurable circular polarization (iii) cost effective fabrication. It is demonstrated that this short backfire antenna can achieve voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) bandwidths of 21 % and 20. 36 % for 2 : 1 VSWR, axial ratio of 1. 8 dB with axial ratio (≤ 3 dB) bandwidth of 1. 94 % and a gain of 12 dBi.

The magnitude of such urban–rural temperature difference varies in daily and seasonal basis. Daily patterns of urban heat accumulation in Adelaide is under investigation. In this paper, East–West air temperature profile of Adelaide metropolitan area was mapped in 60 journeys alongside a <b>straight</b> <b>cross</b> route connecting Adelaide Hills to the West Beach under clear sky between 26 July and 15 August 2013. The most intense urban–rural temperature differences of 5. 9  °C occurred during midnight in Adelaide. However, maximum urban heat variation occurred during the late afternoon when the near-surface urban heat fluctuates by 2  °C between the CBD East and Western Parklands. During summer heatwaves, the afternoon heat stress limits public life vibrancy in Adelaide. Increased urban greenery can facilitate resilience to heat by providing shadow and evaporative cooling. A better understanding of daily urban heat variations and the cooling effect of urban greenery assists urban policy making and public life management {{in the context of}} climate change...|$|E
40|$|The oldest monumental {{buildings}} {{preserved in}} the Carpatho-Danubian-Pontic region are churches. For centuries {{they were the most}} representative creations of ecclesiastic and monumental architecture. More specifically, they have always represented typical orthodox churches since Romanians are the only Latin nation of orthodox religion, while all the other peoples of Latin origin are catholic. Erected with stone and brick masonry, these Eastern Churches of Balkan-Byzantine style were always an evidence of the level of technical knowledge, cultural receptivity and artistic refinement reached during their époques. As a rule, they followed the Byzantine pattern based on the standard scheme of the Greek Church, the <b>straight</b> <b>cross</b> inscribed in a rectangle and the dome supported on pendentives or on piers. However, they are creatively adapted to the regional traditions of the secular architecture. These Orthodox Churches also reflect the foreign influences on the autochthonous art of building. The paper also presents old and new methods for repairing three-lobed churches made of stone and brick masonry. The innovation consists in reinforcing, coating or confining masonry structural members with the aid of polymer grids of high density and strength. The results obtained by static and dynamic tests on reduced and full scale models show that the method is reliable and worth to be applied. 2...|$|E

Progress {{is due to the}} composite nature of the privilege of the composite itself, such as: has a low density, capable of biodegradable, recyclable, has good mechanical properties, and can be renewed because it comes from nature. This research aims to determine the effect of fiber volume fraction and the composition to the tensile strength and bending strength on rattan fiber reinforced composites. The research material is rattan fiber, epoxy resin and catalyst methyl ethyl ketone peroxide (MEPOXE). Shape of the specimen based on the ASTM D 3039 standard for tensile test and ASTM D 790 - 03 for the bending test. Research specimens varied in aggregate form filler fibers are <b>straight,</b> <b>cross,</b> and random with fiber volume fraction of 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, and 40 %. Manufacture of specimens using hand lay-up method. To determine the mechanical properties of the material bending test and tensile test and photo macro structure. The results showed that the addition of fiber volume fraction resulted in an increase in tensile stress and bending. The highest tensile stress occurs on the fiber volume fraction of 40 % with a straight fiber composition of 31. 21 MPa. The highest bending voltage obtained at 40 % fiber volume fraction and the fiber composition of the cross of 194. 12 MPa. Observations of macro structure indicate that fracture surface is relatively flat and shiny indicating that the rattan fiber reinforced composites are brittle...|$|E
