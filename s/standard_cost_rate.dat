By integrating Web caching and Web prefetching, these two techniques can complement each other since the Web caching technique exploits the temporal locality, whereas Web prefetching technique utilizes the spatial locality of Web objects [32]. In this paper, we develop algorithm Pre-IPGDSF # by integrating Web caching and Web prefetching in Web servers. For caching, we use innovative algorithm Intelligent Predictive Greedy Dual Size Frequency#, IPGDSF#, which is an enhanced version of algorithm GDSF # developed by us [13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. For prefetching, we use a static prefetching method. Using three different Web proxy server logs, we use trace driven analysis to evaluate the effects of different replacement policies {{on the performance of}} a Web proxy server. We specifically compare policies like GDSF, GDSF#, and IPGDSF # with the proposed integrated policy Pre-IPGDSF#.

The thesis has two focal points. The first focal point {{is the development of}} a method for productivity measurement and the evaluation of productivity performance based on existing productivity measurement methods. The second focal point is the application of the method and thereafter the interpretation of the productivity measurement results. The unique characteristics of branch offices that had to be taken into consideration and provided for in productivity measurement y!ere highlighted. The requirements for sound productivity measurement, such as the validity and consistency of productivity measurement methods, techniques and models were pointed out. A wide range 0 : existing productivity measurement methods and models were researched. The existing methods and models for productivity measurement were found to be lacking in respect of their inability to reflect the effect of free products and services or the effect of resource substitution in the case of multiple resources.

The four purposes for which <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> systems are used have been identified by Charles T. Horngren as follows: 1. Financial statement preparation. 2. Cost management 3.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review {{literature}} on <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> in Japanese manufacturing environment. It examines the changes in the manufacturing environment in Japan that has lowered the significance of <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> in Japanese firms and investigates the current level of its applicability in Japanese firms. Design/methodology/approach – The paper systematically categorizes the relevant literature and reviews it methodologically. Findings – The paper finds that <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> is still being used by a large number of firms both in developing and developed countries. Overall, the research suggests that the importance of <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> has not declined to such a low level despite the technological changes. In Japan <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> is still used for different purposes despite its apparent weaknesses. Research limitations/implications – This is not an empirical investigation of <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> in Japanese manufacturing firms. Originality/value – The paper will be useful to researchers, cost accountants and others concerned with product costing to understand the importance of <b>standard</b> <b>costing.</b> It is also expected that the current research will help reveal whether or not one should continue teaching <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> in the classroom...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this case study is to understand and explain fundamental difficulties of employing <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> in the case company operating globally in manufacturing industry. It is crucial to understand the problematic areas since <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> system is used for product costing, decision-making and operational control. The secondary objective is to analyse findings and develop solution suggestions for the identified challenging areas. The research used mainly foreign literature and articles from scientific publications to build a sound theoretical framework. The empirical {{part of the study}} used the case company's internal material, interviews, observations, informal discussions and information systems. The data was gathered in 2013 - 2014. The results of this thesis suggest that operational factors, <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> system and <b>standards</b> maintenance are the areas where most of the <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> difficulties stem from. Based on the case study, the main problems within the areas are complex operating conditions, lack of tools to control operations, standardized SCS, <b>standard</b> <b>costs</b> deviations from actuals, non-optimal system use, lack of variance analysis on product group level, partial negligence of <b>standards</b> thorough <b>cost</b> audit, and <b>standard</b> <b>costs</b> inadequateness with continuous improvement. Based on the analysed findings of the case study, <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> improvement suggestions are presented to provide assistance in the difficult areas.

In addition, a product cost simulator is introduced to support <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> system in the areas where it's mostly struggling.

Although the availability of company archives is somewhat limited, we nevertheless found evidence that at least one leading shipbuilding firm undertook major modernisation and reorganisation programmes, comprising the adoption of the new technology of welding, during the study period. Allied with these radical changes, the firm employed scientific management methods and utilised <b>standard</b> <b>costs,</b> but it did not employ full systems of <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> and variance analysis.
