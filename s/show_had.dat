5|$|The cast was {{announced}} on May 15, 1987. There {{was a certain}} degree of uncertainty regarding job security during the pilot for the main cast, as they did not hear until after production had wrapped that the <b>show</b> <b>had</b> been picked up for a further thirteen episodes.|$|E
5|$|Although {{set in a}} hospital, it uses {{no medical}} storylines; the action is {{produced}} {{by a series of}} soap opera-style twists and turns in the personal lives of the characters.

5|$|By {{the time}} Lynch left in 1989, Butthole Surfers' stage <b>show</b> <b>had</b> become more predictable, with {{previously}} random shockers being {{done at the}} same point in each night's performance.
