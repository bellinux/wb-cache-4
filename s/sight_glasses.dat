2500|$|The {{most common}} type of {{corrective}} lens is [...] "single vision", which has a uniform refractive index. [...] For people with presbyopia and hyperopia, bifocal and trifocal glasses provide two or three different refractive indices, respectively, and progressive lenses have a continuous gradient. Reading glasses provide a separate set of glasses for focusing on close-by objects. Reading glasses are available without prescription from drugstores, and offer a cheap, practical solution, though these have two simple lenses of equal power, so will not correct refraction problems like astigmatism or refractive or prismatic variations between the left and right eye. For total correction of the individual's <b>sight,</b> <b>glasses</b> complying to a recent ophthalmic prescription are required. [...] Adjustable-focus eyeglasses might be used to replace bifocals or trifocals, or might be used to produce cheaper single-vision glasses (since they don't have to be custom-manufactured for every person).|$|E

50|$|Simple <b>sight</b> <b>glasses</b> {{may be just}} {{a plastic}} or glass tube {{connected}} {{to the bottom of}} the tank at one end and the top of the tank at the other. The level of liquid in the sight glass will be the same as the level of liquid in the tank. Today, however, sophisticated float switches have replaced <b>sight</b> <b>glasses</b> in many such applications.|$|E

50|$|The {{one piece}} {{lubricator}} {{body is a}} gunmetal casting and incorporates the condensing chamber, the oil reservoir and the <b>sight</b> <b>glasses.</b> Passages within the body interconnect these areas. The body is fitted with a steam valve, a water valve, an oil control valve. <b>Sight</b> <b>glasses</b> are fitted at the front & back of the body {{on each of the}} feeds, these feeds are fitted with individual feed regulating valves for controlling the feed rate for each outlet. The oil control valve was used to either turn the supply off/on, or to shut off the supply to the cylinders and just supply the air compressor with oil whilst the locomotive is stationary on lubricators with a center feed. Each feed is also fitted with a drain valve for cleaning each sight glass. The body is also fitted with an oil chamber drain for draining the condensed water from the oil chamber.|$|E
50|$|Industrial {{observational}} instruments {{have changed}} with industry itself. More structurally sophisticated than the water gauge, the contemporary sight glass — {{also called the}} sight window or sight port — {{can be found on}} the media vessel at chemical plants and in other industrial settings, including pharmaceutical, food, beverage and bio gas plants. <b>Sight</b> <b>glasses</b> enable operators to visually observe processes inside tanks, pipes, reactors and vessels. The modern industrial sight glass is a glass disk held between two metal frames, which are secured by bolts and gaskets, or the glass disc is fused to the metal frame during manufacture. The glass used for this purpose is either soda lime glass or borosilicate glass, and the metal, usually a type of stainless steel, is chosen for desired properties of strength. Borosilicate glass is superior to other formulations in terms of chemical corrosion resistance and temperature tolerance, as well as transparency. Fused <b>sight</b> <b>glasses</b> are also called mechanically prestressed glass, because the glass is strengthened by compression of the metal ring. Heat is applied to a glass disc and its surrounding steel ring, causing a fusion of the materials. As the steel cools, it contracts, compressing the glass and making it resistant to tension. Because glass typically breaks under tension, mechanically prestressed glass is unlikely to break and endanger workers. The strongest <b>sight</b> <b>glasses</b> are made with borosilicate glass, because of the greater difference in its coefficient of expansion.|$|E
50|$|The 1970s {{were the}} heyday of Malins Engineers. The MM1 {{received}} a vaporising burner in 1970, both Minors got overflow plugs in 1975, the engines were converted to solid fuel in 1977 for the domestic market (it had happened earlier for export) and in 1978 the entire range (except for the MM1) received <b>sight</b> <b>glasses</b> on the boiler instead of the overflow plug. By the late 1970s the range was looking tired and so, with considerable investment from the Malins family, in 1979 the SE range was superseded by the SP range.|$|E

50|$|The National Board of Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspectors {{recommends}} a daily testing procedure {{described by the}} American National Standards Institute, chapter 2 part I-204.3 water level gauge. While not strictly required, this procedure is designed to allow an operator to safely verify that {{all parts of the}} <b>sight</b> <b>glass</b> are operating correctly and have free flowing connections to the boiler necessary for proper operation.|$|R
50|$|The 7th Class {{represented}} a considerable advance {{in design and}} power. They were the first South African locomotives to be equipped with sight feed lubricators which allowed a <b>sight</b> <b>glass</b> to be positioned in the cab, where the rate of oil feed to the cylinders could be observed. The reversing gear was of the quick-threaded screw type instead of the reversing lever which had earlier been used.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} {{the days}} runs, the train is shoved back to clear the shop lead switch, with the cars being tied down, and the engine spotted for the night of the track pans to clean the fire the next morning. The fire is banked and the boiler is filled with water to sit through the {{overnight}} hours. Once that is complete the <b>sight</b> <b>glasses</b> are shut off, along with the air compressor and check valves to the boiler, the dynamo, blower, and injector lines are closed, and finally the turret is shut off and the stack is gagged.|$|E
50|$|Oil {{is drawn}} from the sump by the oil pump and {{delivered}} to the three inner main bearings and to the other bearings within the crank chamber. Oil is led into {{the centre of the}} crankpins by oil scoops which lubricate the big end bearings from inside. The end main bearings and each of the four cylinders receive measured doses of oil through a mechanical automatic lubricator. This lubricator, driven by chain, contains positive pumps to force the oil through each of six feed-pipes. Mounted on the dashboard the lubricator's <b>sight</b> <b>glasses</b> give visual confirmation oil is circulating.|$|E
5000|$|At about 4:30 am while Herald {{was lying}} hove to between 300 yd and 400 yd from North Head in the calm {{of the early}} morning, the {{starboard}} boiler suddenly burst (believed {{to be at the}} bottom of the boiler forcing the bottom of the vessel out) and filled the vessel with steam, canting the vessel over.

25|$|Some of his inventions were an {{automated}} (self-striking) water clock (the Jagyeokru) which worked by activating motions of wooden figures to indicate time visually (invented in 1434 by Jang), a subsequent more complicated water-clock with additional astronomical devices, and an improved {{model of the}} previous metal movable printing type created in the Goryeo Dynasty. The new model was of even higher quality and was twice as fast. Other inventions were the <b>sight</b> <b>glass,</b> and the udometer.|$|R
50|$|The {{air-cooled}} engine has a gear-driven counterbalancer {{as well as}} a proprietary cylinder wall plating similar to a Nikasil coating. The coating, marketed as Suzuki Composite Electro-chemical Material or SCEM, is nickel-phosphorus-silicon-carbide based, reducing weight (by eliminating a steel liner) and improving heat transfer, allowing for tighter and more efficient piston-to-cylinder clearance. Valves are adjustable via 'screw and locknut' type clearance adjusters. The engine features an oil sump <b>sight</b> <b>glass,</b> enabling visual oil checks, and uses 87 octane fuel.|$|R

50|$|Depending on the park's {{operating}} schedule, {{the general}} timetable for departing trains begin {{an hour and}} a half after opening, and the final run one hour before the park closes. The fireman will report to work about three hours before departure, and will begin inspections. The track is inspected each morning, and the locomotive is serviced by removing the stack gag, opening all operating valves to appliances to test their operation, as well as blowing down the <b>sight</b> <b>glasses,</b> cleaning the banked fire, cleaning the smokebox cinder bonnet, refilling lubricators, cleaning the ashpit, coaling the tender, and a scrubbing down of locomotive and tender with soap and water. Once the engine has been serviced, the engineer or fireman will perform a hammer test on all pins, nuts, and wedges on the running gear and replace brake shoes and tighten up driving box wedges as necessary. The whole process usually takes 1½ hours to make the engine operational for the day, and the rest of the time is used to clean and make adjustments.|$|E
5000|$|The {{diesel engine}} is an twelve-cylinder, turbocharged, water-cooled, four-cycle, V-type engine usedto provide power. It is {{directly}} connected to the main generator. The traction motors are axle hung and supported on the truck transoms by spring-loaded suspension. One motor is geared to each axle through a single set of gears with a ratio of 14:72. The radiator keeps engine at proper operating temperature between 100 and 1980F (37.7 and 92.2°C). Two externally mounted battery boxes, {{one on each side}} of the locomotive, provide ventilated compartments to house the eight batteries. Two main reservoir tanks, one {{on each side of the}} locomotive, provide a means of storing air for the air system. The main generator furnishes direct-current power over a wide range of voltage at variousspeeds up to 1200 rpm. It is separately excited by the exciter generator mounted on the generator frame. The generator also acts as a starting motor when the start button is pushed and the battery switch is closed. The fuel tank can hold 500 gallons (1892 liters) of diesel fuel for engine operation. Two fill pipes and two <b>sight</b> <b>glasses,</b> one on each side of the locomotive, provide a means of filling the tank and monitoring the level of fuel. The blower provides forced ventilation for the traction motors which require adequate cooling. It is belt driven from the main generator shaft.|$|E

5000|$|The GP40-2 can be {{distinguished}} from the earlier GP40 by the oval-shaped water-level <b>sight</b> <b>glass</b> at the right rear of the long hood; bolted (rather than hinged) battery boxes ahead of the cab; lengthened walkway blower duct; and various minor cosmetic differences in the front air intake and rear hood doors. [...] A number of GP40-2s also came with the new Blomberg M-type trucks, with single-clasp brakes, rubber pads replacing the central leaf springs and a shock strut over each axle.|$|R
5000|$|The {{separator}} is {{only effective}} {{as long as}} there is an air space inside the chamber. The separator can fail if either the mixed inlet is overwhelmed with supply material, or the liquid drain is unable to handle the volume of liquid being collected. The separator may therefore be combined with some other liquid level sensing mechanism such as a <b>sight</b> <b>glass</b> or float sensor. In this manner, both the supply and drain flow can be regulated to prevent the separator from becoming overloaded. (Agastya, Bayu) ...|$|R
