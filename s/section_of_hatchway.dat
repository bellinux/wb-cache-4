6000|$|Happily a fresh {{burst of}} riotous clamour, from one <b>of</b> the <b>hatchways,</b> {{interrupted}} the intention; {{and then was}} heard the cry of,--- ...|$|R
6000|$|The house--extending round {{three sides}} of a square--was only two stories high. The flat roof, {{accessible}} through a species <b>of</b> <b>hatchway,</b> and still surrounded by its sturdy stone parapet, was called [...] "The Belvidere," [...] in reference as usual to the fine view which it commanded. Fearing I knew not what, I mounted the ladder {{which led to the}} roof. Romayne received me with a harsh outburst of laughter--that saddest false laughter which is true trouble in disguise.|$|R
60|$|As {{he spoke}} the boy got {{his head out}} <b>of</b> the <b>hatchway,</b> and, {{rendered}} desperate with fear, fairly fought his way past the engineer and gained the deck.|$|R
6000|$|Gregory led {{him down}} a low, vaulted passage, {{at the end}} of which was the red light. It was an {{enormous}} crimson lantern, nearly as big as a fireplace, fixed over a small but heavy iron door. In the door there was a sort <b>of</b> <b>hatchway</b> or grating, and on this Gregory struck five times. A heavy voice with a foreign accent asked him who he was. To this he gave the more or less unexpected reply, [...] "Mr. Joseph Chamberlain." [...] The heavy hinges began to move; it was obviously some kind of password.|$|R
60|$|He was gruff, as {{became his}} racial superiority, but not unfriendly. The Chinaman, gazing sad and {{speechless}} {{into the darkness}} <b>of</b> the <b>hatchway,</b> seemed {{to stand at the}} head of a yawning grave.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{you will}} sink the whole hull too low. But here, {{to have less}} smoke in time of battle, {{especially}} on the lower decks, you proposed a new sort <b>of</b> <b>hatchway.</b> But that won't do. See here now, I have invented certain ventilating pipes, they are to traverse the vessel thus"--laying some toilette pins along--"the current of air to enter here and be discharged there. What {{do you think of}} that? But now about the main things--fast sailing driving little to leeward, and drawing little water. Look now at this keel. I whittled it only night before last, just before going to bed. Do you see now how"-- ...|$|R
25|$|On 22 May Telegraph {{came into}} Plymouth. A gale {{a few days}} earlier had put Telegraph on her beam ends for several minutes with water up to the combing <b>of</b> her <b>hatchways.</b> It was only when the fore top-mast and the {{bowsprit}} went that she righted.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wot {{a splendid}} mornin'!" [...] said Stephen Gaff, putting {{his head and}} {{shoulders}} out <b>of</b> the after <b>hatchway,</b> and yawning violently.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then," [...] said Lancey, in {{the tone}} of an eager listener, while, by the tapping on the combings <b>of</b> the <b>hatchway,</b> I could {{distinguish}} that he was emptying his pipe, with a view, no doubt, to the enjoyment of another, [...] "and what happened when they tried to blow you up?" ...|$|R
60|$|The convicts {{who were}} on deck looked over the bulwarks, and cracked coarse jokes among themselves, as the {{passengers}} ascended the gangway. Reuben found that only one-third of the number were allowed on deck at once. Two soldiers paced {{up and down the}} deck, on guard <b>of</b> the <b>hatchway</b> leading below, and two sentries were posted at other points.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hear them yell, yer honor. A faction fight's {{nothing to}} it. Look, yer honor, look! There's smoke curling {{up from a}} <b>hatchway</b> <b>of</b> the big ship. If they haven't set her afire!" ...|$|R
60|$|Boldly we {{emerged from}} the <b>hatchway</b> <b>of</b> the craft, leaving our swords behind us, and strode to the main exit {{which led to the}} sentry's post and the office of the Dator of the guard.|$|R
6000|$|But not so. Taking three {{turns on}} the deck, he placed {{his hand on the}} wheel, and said, [...] "Right or wrong, my lad, go with us you must. Putting you ashore is now out of the question. I make no port till this ship is full to the combings <b>of</b> her <b>hatchways.</b> However, you may leave her if you can." [...] And so saying he entered his cabin, like Julius Caesar into his tent.|$|R
60|$|And {{something}} like this it turned out. In ascending one of the narrow ladders leading from the berth-deck to the gun-deck, the Most Noble Marquis of Silva, {{in the act of}} elevating the Imperial coat-tails, so as to protect them from rubbing against the newly-painted combings <b>of</b> the <b>hatchway,</b> this noble marquis's sword, being an uncommonly long one, had caught between his legs, and tripped him head over heels down into the fore-passage.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, {{the next}} thing to do," [...] Harry said, [...] "is to fix the beams so as to hold the wood in its place again." [...] Four pieces of wood, each three inches long, were screwed against the combing <b>of</b> the <b>hatchway</b> in such a {{position}} that when the beams were placed upon them they were exactly level with the top, and supported the piece cut out from the hatchway in its original position.|$|R
60|$|The <b>hatchways</b> <b>of</b> some armed {{vessels are}} but poorly secured in bad weather. This was peculiarly {{the ease with}} those of the Neversink. They were merely spread over with an old tarpaulin, cracked and rent in every direction.|$|R
