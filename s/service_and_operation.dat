To enhance technology discovery, IS relevant processing technology classification and characterization is proposed. Technology participation in IS is addressed. Partial semantic input-output matching is used to propose complex and innovative networks assessed and ranked by their technological, economic and environmental benefits.

40|$|Abstract. Electrochromic {{materials}} have found practical applications in special devices such as:- systems with controlled transmission (surfaces with regulated radiation-electrochromic glazings),- systems with controlled reflection (electrochromic mirrors with regulated solar reflectance), and- systems with change of color contrast (special electrochromic information displays). This paper deals with electrochromic devices with a controlled transmission. Electrochromic glazings {{can be described}} as devices based on electrochromic materials that operate as reversible switching solar control shutters. These special glasses have found application not only for window glazing in hot climatic conditions but they are also recommended for buildings with large glazed shells where overheating and glare effect represent serious problem for daily <b>service</b> <b>and</b> <b>operation...</b>|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} a multiagent-based adaptive ad-hoc pervasive service architecture. It provides dynamic context-aware <b>service</b> <b>and</b> <b>operation</b> management including semantic service match-making, composition, execution, monitoring, and autonomic recovery. The intended application is decision support in tactical field operations. This domain requires dynamic adaptive composition of services, resources, and assets via ubiquitous and pervasive computing devices connected by mobile wireless peer-to-peer networks. Our {{goal is to}} provide on-demand pervasive services to meet users ’ dynamic situational information needs. Our solution uses distributed peer service composition service layers, i. e., the agent-based peer service composition agent layer, the agent-based wrapper service layer, and the resource and asset layer...|$|E

40|$|In-network content caching has {{recently}} {{emerged in the}} context of Information-Centric Networking (ICN), which allows content objects to be cached at the content router side. In this paper, we specifically focus on in-network caching of Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) content objects for improving both <b>service</b> <b>and</b> <b>operation</b> efficiencies. We propose an intelligent in-network caching scheme of P 2 P content chunks, aiming to reduce P 2 P-based content traffic load and also to achieve improved content distribution performance. Towards this end, the proposed holistic decision-making logic takes into account context information on the P 2 P characteristics such as chunk availability. In addition, we also analyse the benefit of coordination between neighbouring content routers when making caching decisions in order to avoid duplicated P 2 P chunk caching nearby. An analytical modelling framework is developed to quantitatively evaluate the efficiency of the proposed in-network caching scheme...|$|E
40|$|As part of {{its overall}} {{strategy}} to meet its energy goals, the Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) partnered with the Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to rapidly demonstrate and deploy cost-effective renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies. This project {{was one of several}} demonstrations of new or underutilized commercial energy technologies. The common goal was to demonstrate and measure the performance and economic benefit of the system while monitoring any ancillary impacts to related standards of <b>service</b> <b>and</b> <b>operation</b> and maintenance (O&M) practices. In short, demonstrations at naval facilities simultaneously evaluate the benefits and compatibility of the technology with the U. S. Department of Defense (DOD) mission, and with NAVFAC's design, construction, operations, and maintenance practices, in particular. This project demonstrated the performance of commercially available advanced power strips (APSs) for plug load energy reductions in building A 4 at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam (JBPHH), Hawaii...|$|E
40|$|Bachelors thesis {{deals with}} {{alternative}} drives of road vehicles, their selected types and a description of the technologies used. The {{first part of}} the work deals with electric vehicles and cars with hybrid drive. There is described the history of the drive, the basic functional elements of the vehicles, the evaluation of the drive and the outline of the future of these cars. In the case of electric vehicles there is also described the issue of their charge. The next chapter is an overview of the current electric and hybrid vehicles, and their technical data, such as the engine parameters, battery or fuel consumption. The last part of the Bachelor's thesis is an evaluation of selected vehicles, gasoline, electric and hybrid cars. In this chapter, the technical-economic analysis of these vehicles is made. It includes the calculation {{of the cost of the}} operation and the technical parameters of the vehicles. The results of the analysis showed that the gasoline car is economically the most advantageous, primarily because of the cost, which compensates for the cost of <b>service</b> <b>and</b> <b>operation...</b>|$|E

Data was also collected concerning the tractor tire inflation pressures, tire condition, and tire sizes. The results were compared with the manufacturer's recommendation of <b>service</b> <b>and</b> <b>operation.</b> Average farm area was 14. 9 ha, 10 % of the farms owned two tractors with an average power of 52. 9 kW, 91 % of the tractors power were over 50 kW and 93. 5 % of the tractors were 2 WD and the rest were MFWD.

40|$|Quality {{management}} practices (QMP) {{is one of}} the most important management in ensuring an organisation continuously improves their business performance. In order to continuously improve in the <b>service</b> <b>and</b> <b>operation,</b> the adoption of QMP is necessary to ensure business excellence. Most previous works have given less emphasis on mediator effect of customer satisfaction (CS) between QMP and communication behavior (CB) amongst Malaysia Hajj pilgrims. A questionnaire was prepared and given to 500 respondents of Malaysian pilgrims which gave a 70. 0 % response rate or 350 respondents. Overall descriptive result depicts high level of QMP, CS and CB, showing that Malaysia Hajj Pilgrims have high satisfaction towards Hajj services, which are being provided by Hajj Pilgrims organiser. Lembaga Tabung Haji (TH), which manages more than 80. 0 % of Malaysia Hajj Pilgrims every year, has performed the excellent performance towards QMP, CS and CB. This study also revealed that QMP has significant effect on CS with r = 0. 91 at p< 0. 01 and CS has significant impact on CB with r = 0. 39 at p< 0. 01. The model has r 2 = 0. 75, meaning that 75 % of CB is accounted by the CS and QMP...|$|E
40|$|In this tutorial, {{we present}} {{excerpts}} from a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and cloud design guidance model harvested from large-scale enterprise applications {{which have been}} subject to change since they went live several years ago. This guidance model comprises of 500 + issues (design problems) commonly encountered in SOA and cloud design, 2000 + known solutions (design alternatives) to these design problems, and best practices recommendations when to select which solution. We also outline how to support architectural decision capturing and reuse in existing and emerging modeling tools. The decisions in the guidance model deal with selection and adoption of architectural patterns, with selection and profiling of technology standards, as well as with selection and configuration of vendor and open source assets. Examples of recurring SOA design issues featured in the tutorial are the selection of integration style and message exchange patterns, the definition of business and system transaction boundaries, as well as <b>service</b> <b>and</b> <b>operation</b> granularity issues. Recurring cloud design issues pertain to cloud virtualization layers (infrastructure vs. platform vs. software), workload type and application genre to be virtualized, and private vs. public cloud exposure. Attendees of the tutorial will gain: – An understanding of the importance of architectural decision capturing and sharing. – The ability to identify required and recurring decisions in UML and other models, to make these decisions more consciously, and to enforce them adequately. – Familiarity with a decision-centric approach to architecture design which starts from software quality attributes and architectural patterns. 2 © 2010 IBM Corporatio...|$|E
