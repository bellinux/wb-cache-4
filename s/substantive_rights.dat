5|$|Academics have {{expressed}} scepticism {{as to whether}} the doctrine of legitimate expectation should apply to <b>substantive</b> <b>rights.</b> Thio Li-ann argues that legitimate expectations should relate only to procedural rather than <b>substantive</b> <b>rights.</b> Procedural protection only has a minimal impact on the administrative autonomy of the relevant public authority, since the court is only concerned with {{the manner in which the}} decision was made and not whether the decision was fair. Thus, the ultimate autonomy of public authorities is never placed in jeopardy. Conversely, as Mark Elliot posits, giving effect to a substantive legitimate expectation impinges on the separation of powers. The authority has been entrusted by Parliament to make decisions about the allocation of resources in public interest. Applying legitimate expectation substantively allows the courts to inquire into the merits of the decision. Such interference with the public authority's discretion would be overstepping their role and exceeding their proper constitutional function.|$|E
5|$|The {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation in Singapore protects both procedural and <b>substantive</b> <b>rights.</b> In administrative law, a legitimate expectation generally arises when {{there has been}} a representation of a certain outcome by the public authorities to an individual. To derogate from the representation may amount to an abuse of power or unfairness. The {{doctrine of}} legitimate expectation as a ground to quash decisions of public authorities has been firmly established by the English courts. Thus, where a public authority has made a representation to an individual who would be affected by a decision by the authority, the individual has a legitimate expectation to have his or her views heard before the decision is taken. Alternatively, an individual may also have a legitimate expectation to a substantive right. The recognition of substantive legitimate expectations is somewhat controversial as it requires a balancing of the requirements of fairness against the reasons for any change in the authority's policy. This suggests the adoption of a free-standing proportionality approach, which has been said not to apply in administrative law.|$|E

40|$|The legal {{construction}} of the aspect of abuse of <b>substantive</b> <b>right</b> {{is one of the}} most important manifestations of equitable principles in civil law. Article 5 of the Civil Code, which contains the aforementioned regulation, may be applied together with the doctrine and case law principles, such as: prohibition on the acquisition and loss of <b>substantive</b> <b>right,</b> based on such acquisition; the defensive nature of the allegation of abuse of rights; or the rule of temporary effect of the condition of abuse of rights. The latter, according to the most dominant view, means that the <b>substantive</b> <b>right</b> may be exercised after the cessation of the circumstances justifying the allegation of abuse of rights. However, in exceptional cases, this does not preclude the occurrence of a permanent condition, which is equivalent to the actual loss of rights. A particularly important example of a permanent effect of the condition of abuse of rights is the possibility, widely accepted in the jurisprudence and part of the doctrine, of reducing the amount of legitimate portion due to the entitled party on the basis of Article 5 of the Civil Code.
