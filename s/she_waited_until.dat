25|$|It {{was later}} {{revealed}} that Sheena was heavily {{pregnant with her}} second child during the single's release. As she did not feel it was appropriate to link single promotions {{with the birth of}} a child, <b>she</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> her T≈çtaikai concerts in November to reveal this.|$|E
500|$|The album's artwork {{was photographed}} by Harry Langdon in the {{swimming}} pool of the Jackson family's home. Jackson described Langdon as [...] "the sweetest man imaginable". She took inspiration from a photograph of actress Elizabeth Taylor submerged {{in a swimming pool}} which was taken early in her career. In the photograph, nothing could be seen apart from Taylor's face above the water; her body was hidden beneath the surface. Jackson thought the pose was dramatic and loved the fact that she could do the same thing, and not to have to reveal anything except for her face. With the photographer, his assistant and other people around the pool, she was still reluctant to take off her robe, and stand there in her bathing suit. <b>She</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> everybody got distracted to slip into the pool. After they took the photos, <b>she</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> everybody was gone {{to get out of the}} pool.|$|E

5000|$|The {{title of}} the song means [...] "I loved you in the summer".This song {{tells the story of}} a girl waiting for her love, {{fleeting}} like the summer, but who never comes. <b>She</b> <b>waits</b> <b>until</b> winter comes, and she dies.|$|R
50|$|<b>She</b> <b>waits</b> <b>until</b> he {{is right}} in front of her before opening her eyes, gazing into his and {{pleading}} for his help. Ronnay is, as usual, dressed in blouse and rough breeches. Unused to such ploys, he gazes around in pathetic helplessness, as if expecting the dwellers of the forest to help him in his awful dilemma.|$|R
2500|$|... "By waiting so long {{to press}} charges in this case, State's Attorney Alvarez has done the McDonald family and the entire {{criminal}} justice system a heinous disservice. <b>She</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> her hand was forced by intense political and media pressure surrounding the release of this painful video. She waited even after City Hall was prepared to pay the McDonald family $5 million in damages." [...] Alvarez lost her bid for reelection in March 2016, earning 29 percent of the votes; Kim Foxx won with 58 percent of the votes.|$|E
2500|$|During that time, Piper {{recorded}} {{her second}} album. She decided to release further records under her full name of Billie Piper. She {{returned to the}} Singles Chart in May 2000 with her third number one single [...] "Day & Night". <b>She</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> September to release [...] "Something Deep Inside", which reached No. 4, but her success waned. In October 2000, Piper released her second album, Walk of Life, which reached Number 14 in the UK Album Chart, but quickly fell off the charts and was certified Silver in the UK. The album only charted in two other countries: New Zealand, where it reached No. 17 only, and Australia, where it was a minor success and peaked at No. 23. In Piper's autobiography, she states that the album was a [...] "commercial bomb". The song [...] "Walk of Life", the final single off this album, was released in December 2000 and reached Number 25 in the UK Singles Chart.|$|E
2500|$|Gilbert {{had made}} violent threats against others {{since she was}} a teenager, {{according}} to court records. At trial, prosecutors said Gilbert used a large kitchen knife in an assault in Greenfield, Massachusetts in January or February 1988. Prosecutors said she tried twice to murder a person by poison in November 1995. Prosecutors said that Gilbert tried to poison a patient at the VA hospital on Jan. 28, 1996, and that she caused a medical emergency by removing a patient's breathing tube at the VA hospital on Jan. 30, 1994. Prosecutors said that Gilbert abandoned a patient undergoing cardiac arrest on Nov. 9, 1995, and then asked another nurse to accompany her on a check of patients. Prosecutors said <b>she</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> her colleague independently spotted the patient's difficulty before raising an alarm. Gilbert forced an untrained colleague to use cardiac defibrillation paddles on a patient during a medical emergency on Nov. 17, 1995, by refusing to use the equipment herself. Prosecutors said Gilbert threatened the life of at least one person verbally and physically in July 1996. [...] While working as a home health aide before becoming a registered nurse, Gilbert purposely scalded a mentally handicapped child with hot bath water about eight years before her VAMC crimes.|$|E

60|$|But {{it was in}} vain that he was sullen and resentful. Suzanne's mind entertained {{no doubt}} of what she should do, and she had her way in the matter, sending back Brutus with the message that <b>she</b> would <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> La Boulaye communicated with her again.|$|R
