60|$|The {{fleet of}} Waally {{presented}} an imposing sight. Not only were his canoes large, and well filled with men, {{but they were}} garnished with the usual embellishments of savage magnificence. Feathers and flags, and symbols of war and power, were waving and floating over the prows of most of them, while the warriors they contained were gay in their trappings. It was apparent, however, {{to the members of}} the council, who watched every movement of the fleet with the utmost vigilance, that their foes were oppressed with doubts concerning the character of the place they had ventured so far to visit. The smoke of the Volcano was visible to them, beyond a doubt, and here was a wall of rock interposed between them and the accomplishment of their desire to land. In this last respect, Rancocus Island offered a shore very different from that of Vulcan's Peak. The first; in addition to the long, low point so often mentioned, had everywhere a beach of some sort or other; while, on the last, the waves of the Pacific rose and fell as against a precipice, marking their power merely by a <b>slight</b> <b>discoloration</b> of the iron-bound coast. Those superstitious and ignorant beings naturally would connect all these unusual circumstances with some supernatural agencies; and Heaton early, gave it as his opinion that Waally, of whom he had some personal knowledge, was hesitating, and doubtful of the course he ought to pursue, on account of this feeling of superstition. When this opinion was expressed, the governor suggested the expediency of firing one of the carronades, under the supposition that the roar of the gun, and most especially the echo, of which there was one in particular that was truly terrific, might have the effect to frighten away the whole party. Heaton was in doubt about the result, for Waally and his people knew something of artillery, though of echoes they could not know anything at all. Nothing like an echo, or indeed a hill, was to be found in the low coral islands of their group, and the physical agents of producing such sounds were absolutely wanting among them. It might be that something like an echo had been heard at Rancocus Island, but it must have been of a very different calibre from that which Heaton and Mark were in the habit of making for the amusement of the females, by firing their fowling-pieces down the Stairs. As yet neither of the guns had been fired from the proper point, which was the outer battery, or that on the shelf of rock, though a very formidable roaring had been made by the report of the gun formerly fired, as an experiment to ascertain how far it would command the entrance of the cove. After a good deal of discussion, it was decided to try the experiment, and Betts, who knew all about the means necessary to produce the greatest reverberations, was despatched to the shelf-battery with instructions to scale its gun, by pointing it along the cliff and making all the uproar he could.|$|E

40|$|Amelogenesis imperfecta is a {{group of}} rare {{inherited}} disorders that affect tooth enamel formation, quantitatively and/or qualitatively. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the genetic etiologies of two families presenting with hypomaturation amelogenesis imperfecta. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood samples obtained from participating family members. Whole exome sequencing was performed using DNA samples from the two probands. Sequencing data was aligned to the NCBI human reference genome (NCBI build 37. 2, hg 19) and sequence variations were annotated with the dbSNP build 138. Mutations in MMP 20 were identified in both probands. A homozygous missense mutation (c. 678 T>A; p. His 226 Gln) was identified in the consanguineous Family 1. Compound heterozygous MMP 20 mutations (c. 540 T>A, p. Tyr 180 * and c. 389 C>T, p. Thr 130 Ile) were identified in the non-consanguineous Family 2. Affected persons in Family 1 showed hypomaturation AI with dark brown discoloration, which is similar to the clinical phenotype in a previous report with the same mutation. However, the dentition of the Family 2 proband exhibited <b>slight</b> yellowish <b>discoloration</b> with reduced transparency. Functional analysis showed that the p.

40|$|AbstractObjective The {{progressive}} early {{changes in}} cartilage and subchondral bone in an experimental model of osteoarthritis (OA) were investigated with high-resolution {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) and microradiography. Methods Partial medial meniscectomy was performed in the left knee of 16 rabbits. Four normal and four sham-operated additional rabbits were used as controls. Changes in cartilage and subchondral bone were sequentially assessed after surgery with MRI at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks, subchondral bone variations quantified postoperatively on microradiographs of sagittal sections at 6 and 10 weeks and the macroscopic alterations graded according to the severity of joint changes. Results MRI demonstrated a progressive increase in the articular cartilage thickness in the weight-bearing area of the femur at weeks 4, 6 and 8 vs basal. Tibial cartilage thickness only showed a significant increment at week 6. No significant abnormalities were detected on X-rays in subchondral bone when compared to controls. Macroscopically, 4 weeks after the operation OA rabbits had only <b>slight</b> cartilage <b>discoloration.</b> Cartilage eburnation, pitting, superficial erosions and osteophytes were detected at week 6. These abnormalities were more evident at 8 and 10 weeks after meniscectomy. Conclusion The focal increase in cartilage thickness is one of the earliest measurable changes in OA and preceeds subchondral bone remodeling. The measurement of cartilage thickness variations with MRI can be used to follow the course of OA and to evaluate the potential beneficial effect of novel therapies...|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the survival rate of ceramic laminate veneers bonded to teeth {{with and without}} existing composite restorations (ECR). Twenty patients (mean age: 49. 7 years) received 92 feldspathic ceramic laminate veneers (Shofu Vintage AL) on the maxillary teeth (intact teeth: n = 26; teeth with ECR: n = 66). Preparations with incisal overlap were made, and ECR of good quality were not removed but conditioned using silica coating (CoJet) and silanization (ESPE-Sil). Enamel and dentin were etched with 38 % H 3 PO 4 for 15 - 30 s and rinsed 30 s; adhesive resin (Excite) was applied, and laminate veneers were then cemented (Variolink Veneer). Restorations were evaluated at baseline and thereafter every 6 months using modified United States Public Health Service criteria. Mean observation period was 21. 6 months. Overall, five absolute failures were encountered (fractures: n = 3; chipping: n = 1; debonding: n = 1), resulting in a survival rate of 94. 6 % (Kaplan-Meier). Survival rates of the laminates bonded to teeth without (96 %) and with ECR (93. 5 %) did not show significant differences (p > 0. 05). Slight marginal defects (16 of 87 laminates) and <b>slight</b> marginal <b>discoloration</b> at the margins were noted (12 of 87 laminates) until the final recall.

40|$|Objectives:: The {{purpose of}} this ‘paired-tooth', {{randomized}} controlled clinical trial was {{to test the hypothesis}} that using a self-etch adhesive additional acid-etching of enamel is beneficial in terms of retention, marginal adaptation and clinical microleakage of class-V restorations. Methods: 29 patients received two or four restorations randomly following two experimental protocols: (1) The ‘mild' self-etch adhesive (Clearfil SE, Kuraray) was applied following a self-etch approach on both enamel and dentin (C-SE non-etch); (2) Similar application of Clearfil SE, but including beforehand selective acid-etching of the enamel cavity margins with phosphoric acid (C-SE etch). Clearfil AP-X (Kuraray) was used as restorative composite for all 100 restorations. Clinical effectiveness was recorded in terms of retention (R), perfect marginal integrity (MI), absence of small incisal marginal defects (I-MI), absence of small cervical defects (C-MI), absence of clinical microleakage (CM), absence of caries recurrence (CR) and absence of post-operative sensitivity (PS) after 3 years of clinical service. Results: Only one restoration (C-SE etch) was clinically unacceptable because of partial loss. Statistically significant difference between both groups was only found for I-MI* (McNemar p= 0. 0225). Superficial clinical microleakage (marginal discoloration) was observed significantly more in smokers (Fisher's exact p= 0. 0246), especially in the C-SE non-etch group (p= 0. 0175). Conclusions: The clinical effectiveness of the mild two-step self-etch adhesive Clearfil SE was excellent after 3 years of clinical service. A tendency towards more marginal defects at the enamel side was recorded when enamel was not beforehand etched with phosphoric acid. Also in this latter group, smoking lead more easily to <b>slight</b> marginal <b>discoloration.</b> However, these shortcomings were small and of clinical negligible relevance. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the clinical performance of S 3 Bond (Kuraray Corp., Japan) and G-Bond (GC Corp., Japan) all-in-one bonding agents, over 3  years in non-carious cervical lesions (NCCLs). Ethics Committee approval was obtained, and 60 restorations were placed in 11 patients aged 45 - 84  years (mean 60. 5  years), using either Clearfil ST resin composite (Kuraray) and S 3 Bond or Gradia resin composite (GC) and G-Bond alternately, without phosphoric acid etch on the uncut enamel margins. Patients were recalled at 6  months, 1  year, 2  years and 3  years, and photographs were taken for assessment of colour match and marginal discoloration. One patient was not available at 3  years, resulting in 54 restorations being available for evaluation. One restoration of S 3 /Clearfil ST was lost at 2  years, giving retention rates of 97 % for S 3 and 100 % for G-Bond. At 3  years, six restorations for S 3 /Clearfil ST showed <b>slight</b> marginal <b>discoloration</b> and one restoration pronounced marginal staining. For G-Bond/Gradia at 3  years, 11 restorations exhibited slight marginal staining and one restoration pronounced marginal staining. Most restorations were bonded to sclerotic dentin. Statistical analysis of marginal staining showed no significant difference between the two restoration groups. The degree of marginal staining was almost identical for both materials and tended to be in larger restorations. Both S 3 and G-Bond all-in-one bonding systems appear to be good adhesives for the restoration of NCCL for the length of the current study. Restoration of NCCLs with the newer all-in-one adhesives appears to be a viable alternative technique to more complicated adhesive materials. © 2011 Springer-Verlag. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Internal red {{discoloration}} {{of fully}} cooked, bone-in chicken products {{is considered a}} quality defect because consumers perceive that the meat is undercooked and unsafe for consumption. Sporadic occurrences of discoloration seem to be widespread within the industry, but no data are available to adequately assess the incidence or severity of this problem. Therefore, products typically available to the consumer either directly from the supermarket or indirectly through a wholesaler were evaluated to determine the relative occurrence and severity of internal red discoloration. Commercially fully cooked breasts, thighs, and drums were objectively and subjectively evaluated for internal red discoloration with the following product types: fried chicken from a supermarket deli, rotisserie chicken from a supermarket deli, frozen fried chicken from a supermarket freezer case, and, frozen fried chicken available wholesale as a commodity item. Overall, 11 % of products sampled would likely generate consumer complaints or rejection, as 10. 6 and 0. 4 % were scored as extensively or severely discolored, respectively. Of the remaining products, 60. 5 % {{had little or no}} discoloration, and 28. 5 % showed <b>slight</b> to moderate <b>discoloration.</b> The fried deli product seemed to have less discoloration than the other products tested.

40|$|Thesis (MPharm (Industrial Pharmacy)) [...] PU for CHE, 1996. The laboratory-scale {{development}} of an over-the-counter (O. T. C.) lOmg famotidine tablet is described. A literature review and drug-excipient compatibility studies conducted at Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education (P. U. for C. H. E.) represented the initial reformulation development stage. Physicochemical properties of famotidine pertinent to the formulation of a stable and bioavailability dosage form were elucidated : poor aqueous solubility (Budavari, 1989 : 617); poor lipophylicity (Islam & Narurkar, 1993 : 686); photosensitivity (McEvoy, 1995 : 2029); susceptibility to gastric degradation (Guvener & Ates (1988 : 142); and interactions between famotidine and Kollidon, Primojel, Crospovidone, Emdex, Emcompress, lactose, sorbitol or stearic acid as reported by Indrayanto et al. (1994 : 911) and/or determined by P. U. for C. H. E. The performance of five direct compression excipients viz. Zeparox spray-dried lactose, Sorbitol Instant FG, Avicel pH 102 (microcrystalline cellulose), Emdex (dextrates, NF hydrate) and Emcompress (dibasic calcium phosphate dehydrate), in a tablet containing lOmg of famotidine and 1 % of magnesium stearate, as lubricant, was subsequently evaluated. The influence of the diluents on selected physical properties of the powder blend and of the tablets was assessed. The direct compression excipients which performed most favorably were then selected and three model formulations were derived, {{with the addition of}} Explotab (sodium starch glycolate), as disintegrate, to enhance bioavailability. The first formulation comprised lOmg of famotidine, 8 mg of Explotab, 180 mg of Zeparox spray-dried lactose and 2 mg of magnesium stearate per tablet. The second formulation contained lOmg of famotidine, 4 mg of Explotab, 40 mg of Avicel, 144 mg of Emcompress and 2 mg of magnesium stearate per tablet; while, the third included lOmg of famotidine, 2 mg of Explotab, 166 mg of Avicel and 2 mg of magnesium stearate. These formulations were produced on a laboratory scale, using a Manesty F 3 single punch tablet press, and were subjected to three months preliminary accelerated stability testing in polypropylene securities. Conditions of 40 °C ± 2 °C and 75 % ± 5 % relative humidity were maintained in a Gallenkamp environmental chamber. The second formulations failed accelerated stability testing; while, the first and third were found to be acceptable. The first formulation; however, demonstrated a reduction in famotidine assay and <b>slight</b> brown <b>discolorations</b> over the three months test period. The third formulation is therefore recommended. Further investigations suggested in the {{development of}} alternative O. T. C. formulations include enteric coating to eliminate gastric degradation (Gtivener & Ates, 1988 : 142) and the use of melt extrusion technology (Grtinhagen & Mtlller, 1995 : 167) to improve bioavailability and/or reduce production costs.

At the 1 yr follow up, the teeth were asymptomatic on clinical examination and showed <b>slight</b> <b>discoloration</b> of the crown due to mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) filling rather than amoxicillin-containing TAP. Radiographic examination revealed complete resolution of the periapical radiolucency, and closed apex with obvious periodontal ligament space. However, the root growth was limited, and the treatment outcome was more like apexification rather than revascularization. These results may be due to unstable blood clot formation which could not resist the condensation force of MTA filling, whether or not a collagen matrix was in place. These cases showed that although revascularization was not successful, apexification could be expected, resulting in the resolution of the periapical radiolucency and the closure of the apex.

After therapy, both direct microscopic mycologicexamination and culture on BioMerieux medium were negative; however, the lesions persisted, assuming a completelydifferent aspect. Cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen was started. This led to a spectacular improvement: the surface ofthe skin became almost normal, merely showing <b>slight</b> <b>discoloration.</b> An unusual clinical presentation and non-responsivenessto treatment should prompt revision of the primary diagnosis. A negative result of direct microscopyshould not exclude the diagnosis of dermatophytosis. Cryotherapy should be considered in cases that do not respondto conventional antifungal medication...|$|E
40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate value added uses for dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) and crude glycerol in swine and poultry diets. In Exp. 1, crude glycerol from multiple biodiesel production facilities was evaluated for storage and variability characteristics. Part one reviewed the storage capabilities of crude glycerol at room temperature and excessive heat conditions on ferrous and stainless steel metal. There was no notable corrosion during the two-month experiment for either metal type under each condition. There was a <b>slight</b> <b>discoloration</b> observed on the ferrous metal stored under excessive heat conditions, but no pitting or sign of corrosion was noted. No changes were observed in the stainless steel under either environment condition. Part two evaluated the variability of crude glycerol from multiple biodiesel production facilities. Representative samples of the parent feedstock and resultant glycerol was collected an analyzed. There was considerable variation between samples, particularly when comparing glycerol from the different feedstocks (vegetable vs. animal). Exp. 2 and 3 {{took place in the}} Feed Processing Research Center in the Department of Grain Science at Kansas State University. Pellet quality and electrical energy consumption was evaluated b...|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{diseases}} such as diabetes mellitus and systemic hypertension have high prevalence all over the world. In majority of cases, patients having diabetes mellitus are also suffering from systemic hypertension and vice versa. Aims: The {{purpose of the study}} is to prepare a combination dosage form which can be used to treat both the diseases concomitantly, reducing pill burden and increasing patient compliance. Methods: Based on positive results of a feasibility study, including doctors ’ opinion and prescription survey, Gliclazide and Enalapril maleate were selected as the active ingredients for developing a FDC (Fixed Dose Combination) preparation. Immediate release combination tablet (Gliclazide and Enalapril maleate Tablet, GET), containing 80 mg of Gliclazide and 5 mg of Enalapril maleate, were prepared by direct compression method having diameter of 8. 7 mm and thickness of 3. 45 mm. Their physical properties were determined. The tablets were subjected to dissolution testing in a six-station USP paddle apparatus rotated at 100 rpm. The dissolution medium was pH 7. 4 phosphate buffer maintained at 37 ο C. The prepared tablets were again subjected to stability testing at conditions of 25 °C/ 60 %RH and 40 °C/ 75 %RH for 6 months. Shelf-lives of the drugs were determined following ICH guidelines as well as by kinetic calculations. Results: The prepared tablets showed hardness of 6. 13 kg. cm 2 and friability value of 0. 1676 %. The dissolution of Gliclazide and Enalapril maleate was 98 % and 85 % respectively at 45 minutes. During stability testing, <b>slight</b> <b>discoloration</b> of the tablets was observed at higher temperature although the assay results were found to be satisfactory. Conclusion: The prepared tablets met the pharmacopeial standards...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1993 This thesis covers two topics. The first subject {{involves}} tests {{run on a}} ultralite reflux tube {{supplied by}} Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories (PNL). The second topic involves tests to determine the relative wicking rates of several different fabrics. The ultralite reflux tube supplied by PNL was constructed of copper and Nextel 312. It had a 10 mil thick copper evaporator and a 10 mil thick copper condenser end cap. The bulk of the condenser was 2 mil thick copper covered by a one inch diameter Nextel 312 woven hose. A life test was run within the Heat Pipe Test Facility, a chamber used to simulate low earth orbit. The life test lasted for over 800 hours, during which time the reflux tube operated steadily with no drop in performance. At {{the end of the}} test the reflux tube was removed and observed. The only noticeable change was a <b>slight</b> <b>discoloration</b> of the Nextel 312 used to cover the condenser. This discoloration was consistent with previously observed phenomenon. The second topic, fabric wicking rate studies were done as a follow up study to the dry uptake tests previously conducted at Oregon State University. The purpose of the tests were to get a relative feel for the ability of different fabrics to wick water. This was achieved using a drop test in which the fabrics were laid out on a bridge connecting two containers. One of the containers was elevated above the other. The fabrics were allowed to wick water from the upper container to the lower container and the rate at which this was accomplished was measured. The fabrics were all able to move significant amounts of water. The stiffer fabrics seemed to perform better. The major transport mechanism was transport between fabric layers and the fabric and the bridge...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +, Fe 3 + ions and glucuronic acid {{on the dry}} and humid heat-induced (120  180 C) discoloration of cotton linter sheets was investigated. The quantity of the added metal ions {{was similar to that}} of metal ions found in wood and pulp. Heat-induced ageing (120  150 C, pH 5) under dry conditions caused only <b>slight</b> <b>discoloration</b> of the reference sheets and of the sheets impregnated with the metal ions. However, during ageing at 180 C, the presence of Mg 2 + ions accelerated the discoloration. An initial pH in the range of 3  8 had no great influence on the discoloration of the reference sheets, but a low pH in combination with Mg 2 + ions increased the discoloration drastically. Under humid ageing conditions at 180 C (< 30 min), the sheets discolored approximately twice as much as under dry conditions; the difference in discoloration caused by the metal ions was less than in dry ageing. Adding glucuronic acid to the sheets caused extensive discoloration under dry ageing conditions (120  180 °C), while Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + ions decreased the glucuronic acid induced discoloration. Under humid conditions (180 °C), however, Mg 2 + and Ca 2 + ions did not prevent the discoloration caused by glucuronic acid. An increase in the absorption coefficient was observed at 285 nm, most likely due to the formation of 5 -hydroxy- 2 -methyl-furaldehyde (HMF) and 2 -furaldehyde (furfural). GC-MS analysis reveals increased formation of HMF in the sheets impregnated with Mg 2 + ions. Degradation of the cellulose in which the alkaline earth metals act as Lewis acids is proposed...|$|E
