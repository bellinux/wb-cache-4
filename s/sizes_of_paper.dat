25|$|Colour maps {{were sent}} to {{commercial}} printers for printing in five colours, with the overprinting being added after the map had been printed. This process was chosen as it gave a higher quality for the fine line-work than the industry standard four-colour process (CMYK). As computer and software technology has advanced, and the cost reduced, many clubs {{are now in a}} position to print their own maps. This enables clubs to print the six colours together (map and overprinting symbols) using that same four-colour process, but with a reduction in quality over traditional printing. Printing costs can be minimised by using standard stock <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> e.g. A4 or Letter. It is important to use the correct type of paper: both the weight and the coating affect the usability of the final map.|$|E
2500|$|An {{important}} {{adjunct to}} the ISO paper sizes, particularly the A series, are the technical drawing line widths specified in ISO 128, and the matching technical pen widths of 0.13, 0.18, 0.25, 0.35, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.40, and 2.0 mm, as specified in [...] Color codes {{are assigned to}} each size to facilitate easy recognition by the drafter. These sizes increase {{by a factor of}} , so that particular pens can be used on particular <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> and then the next smaller or larger size can be used to continue the drawing after it has been reduced or enlarged, respectively. For example, a continuous thick line on A0 size paper shall be drawn with a 0.7 mm pen, the same line on A1 paper shall be drawn with a 0.5 mm pen, and finally on A2, A3, or A4 paper it shall be drawn with a 0.35 mm pen.|$|E

50|$|All ISO paper sizes {{have the}} same aspect ratio, one to the square root of 2, meaning that a {{document}} designed for any given size can be enlarged or reduced to any other size and will fit perfectly. Given this ease of changing sizes, it is of course common to copy or print a given document on different <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> especially within a series, e.g. a drawing on A3 may be enlarged to A2 or reduced to A4.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The effect <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> {{sludge content}} and size on the processibility, {{mechanical}} properties, swelling behavior and morphology of PP–EPDM composites were examined. Results {{show that the}} increasing content <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> sludge in composites has increased the Young’s modulus and water absorption but decreased the tensile strength and elongation at break. At a similar filler content, PP–EPDM composites with the smallest size show the highest mechanical properties but the lowest water absorption resistance. SEM tensile fracture surface of composites show that the smallest <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> sludge has better filler–matrix interaction than the larger <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> sludge. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that the increase <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> sludge content has increased the thermal stability of PP–EPDM composites particularly at temperatures above 500 C.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the study of a new biotechnological procedure, {{employing}} laccase in combination with hydrophobic compounds, for the biomodification of fibres and the internal <b>sizing</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper.</b> Cellulose fibres from eucalyptus kraft pulp, unbleached and TCF bleached, were incubated with laccase, in combination {{with a series of}} hydrophobes. Laccase treatments of cellulose fibres with lauryl gallate conferred the lowest level of water penetration in handsheets. It was observed that the hydrophobization <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> was not possible using the hidrophobe alone. The coupling of lauryl gallate onto cellulose fibres was firstly denoted by kappa number analysis, and further demonstrated by IR spectroscopy.

40|$|A new biotechnological {{procedure}} using laccase {{in combination}} with a hydrophobic phenolic compound (lauryl gallate) for the hydrophobization of cellulose fibres and internal <b>sizing</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> was developed. Cellulose fibres from hardwood kraft pulp were incubated with laccase (Lac), {{in combination with}} lauryl gallate (LG). The Lac-LG treatment resulted in the internal <b>sizing</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> and also in significantly reduced water penetration in the handsheets and wettability <b>of</b> the <b>paper</b> surface. Paper was found not to be effectively rendered hydrophobic by LG alone. SEM images of the fibre network revealed the presence <b>of</b> the <b>sizing</b> agent: {{a product of the}} reaction between laccase and lauryl gallate.

50|$|A {{filing cabinet}} (or {{sometimes}} file cabinet in American English) {{is a piece}} of office furniture usually used to store paper documents in file folders. In the most simple context, it is an enclosure for drawers in which items are stored. The two most common forms of filing cabinets are vertical files and lateral files. A vertical file cabinet has drawers that extend from the short side (typically 15 inches) of the cabinet. A lateral file cabinet has drawers that extend from the long side (various lengths) of the cabinet. These are also called side filers in Great Britain. There are also shelf files, which go on shelves. In the United States, file cabinets are usually built to accommodate 8.5 × 11 paper, and in other countries, filing cabinets are often designed to hold other <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> such as A4 paper.|$|E
5000|$|Alembic was {{a poetry}} {{magazine}} established by Peter Barry, Ken Edwards, and Robert Gavin Hampson, which appeared eight {{times during the}} 1970s. The first issue appeared in 1973: it was a collection of poems by Barry, Edwards, Hampson and Jim Stewart with graphic work by John Simpson, Robert Snell and Sibani Raychaudhuri. The work was printed on different colours and <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> - and contained in a plastic bag. It was sold at the Edinburgh Festival of 1973, where Hampson was working with the Liverpool-based multimedia group Zoom Cortex. (See Adrian Henri, Events and Happenings, Thames and Hudson, for Zoom Cortex.)The second issue maintained the same format (a collection of loose pages in a plastic bag) but with an increased number of poets. Richard Kostelanetzs assemblages have been described by the editors as their model for this mode of publication. [...] With the third issue, the magazine adopted the standard little-magazine format of the time: A4 pages, card cover, stapled. Alembic 3, 4 and 5 also marked a more self-conscious engagement with contemporary London-based experimental poetry. Alembic 3 (Spring 1975) announced the intention to engage with one area of contemporary creative practice in each issue in order to represent the range of poetry being written in the UK. [...] This issue focused on contemporary work that had its roots in surrealism. It included Lee Harwoods essay Surrealist Poetry Today, which had been a talk given at the Poetry Society, and it included work by Harwood, Paul Matthews, Jeff Nuttall, Heathcote Williams and others. Alembic 4 was edited solely by Hampson and was dedicated to open field poetry {{and the idea of}} place. Allen Fisher was the featured poet: in addition to work by him, there was also an interview with him conducted by Barry and Edwards. This issue also included work by Roy Fisher, Eric Mottram, and a small number of American poets, including Alan Davies, who was to be associated with LANGUAGE poetry. Alembic 5 (Autumn 1976)was edited solely by Edwards and focused on experimental prose, including work by Paul Buck, Opal Nations, Jeff Nuttall, Maxim Jakubowski, David Miller, the Canadian writer Greg Hollingshead and James Sherry, who was also associated with LANGUAGE poetry. This issue was also the first to be offset. (Like Alembic 4. it had a wrap around cover rather than card.) Alembic 6 (Summer 1977)was again solely edited by Hampson. It included further work by contributors to earlier issues. The featured poet was the Australian poet David Miller: as well as poems and essays by Miller, there was also poetry by Robert Lax and a reprint of work by Charles Madge, on both of whom Miller had written. In addition, there was also work by Rosmarie Waldrop, Tom Leonard, Elaine Randell and Barry MacSweeney. [...] Alembic 7 (Spring 1978), edited by Edwards and Hampson out of Lower Green Farm, was the Assemblage Issue, assembled by inviting a range of poets and visual artists to provide the contents. It included work by Jeremy Adler, Paul Buck, Herbert Burke, Paula Claire, cris cheek, Bob Cobbing, Glenda George, Robert Sheppard, E. E. Vonna-Michel, Lawrence Upton and others. A particular feature of this issue was that every cover was different: they were hand-printed by Vonna-Michel with a rubber-stamp used for the title. [...] Alembic 9 (to be edited by Hampson) was promised, but never appeared: Edwards had begun to publish Reality Studios as a slimmer, faster and more frequent publication. This eventually metamorphosed (through an amalgamation with Wendy Mulfords Street Editions) into Reality Street, which has been a major publisher of experimental poetry and prose since the 1980s.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to develop an {{innovative}} method for the internal <b>sizing</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> by use <b>of</b> laccase and hydrophobic compounds. Nine different products containing hydrophobic moieties were tested in combination with laccase derived from Trametes villosa on Eucalyptus globulus kraft pulp {{in order to assess}} their internal sizing capability. The strongest internal sizing effect was obtained with lauryl gallate (LG). Heat treatment of the handsheets was found to increase the resistance to water absorption <b>of</b> internally <b>sized</b> samples significantly. Tests were conducted under variable operating conditions, including enzyme and reactant doses and treatment time. In addition to altering the water absorption rate, internal sizing with the laccase–LG treatments was found to affect the mechanical and optical properties of the handsheets. As shown in this work, treatments based on laccase and a hydrophobic compound (particularly lauryl gallate), can provide a new, effective biotechnological method for the internal <b>sizing</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper.</b> Postprint (published version...|$|R

50|$|The <b>size</b> and {{proportions}} <b>of</b> a {{book will}} thus {{depend on the}} <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the original sheet <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> used in producing the book.

Because the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> used has differed {{over the years and}} localities, the <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> books of the same format will also differ.
