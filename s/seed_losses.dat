40|$|Oilseed rape <b>seed</b> <b>loss</b> during harvest {{can cause}} {{subsequent}} unwanted gene flow and thus give raise to management difficulties {{in order to}} keep segmented different productions. Furthermore, <b>seed</b> <b>loss</b> reduces benefits of producers. This loss was evaluated in different conditions and trials carried out in three French regions from 2002 to 2004. <b>Seed</b> <b>loss</b> was divided into three categories : before harvest, under the cutter bar and behind the combine harvester. Total loss represented on average 8, 2 % of the harvest for grain water content under 12 %. But this figure does not take an important variability into account. Indeed, an advanced cutter bar could reduce loss by 80 % and grain humidity at harvest plays an important part in the total loss level and its distribution. Before harvest low grain water content could make <b>seed</b> <b>loss</b> more sensitive to climatic events. Under the cutter bar, <b>seed</b> <b>loss</b> is inversely proportional to grain water content.

The device is made up of two cylinders and a number of fingers, the cylinders rotate in opposite direction and fingers move in and out through holes on cylinder walls. The assembly was expected to separate the twisted pods and reduce grain loss. A hydraulic motor driven by combine hydraulic system was used to rotate the separating cylinders. The separating assembly was installed on righthand side of the combine harvester header. A split-plot experiment was used to evaluate the performance of the unit. Field tests were carried out at combine forward speed of 1. 5 kmh- 1.

In order to test for intrinsic differences of seed characteristics, germination trials were conducted using both canopy seeds and seeds from the soil seed bank.

In all populations, dormancy release increased with increasing temperature, but averaged responses were significantly different between Costa Rican and Australian seed populations, and between seeds collected from the soil and from trees. Germination rate of scarified seeds was fastest at 35 °C in all tested seed populations. While high seed germination levels seem to explain low seed bank densities in the Australian wetland, the large seed banks at the rangeland sites reflect the lower incidence of favourable conditions for germination. In the Australian wetland biocontrol with bruchids is unlikely to be successful, while control by conventional methods, such as killing stands by basal bark spraying, seems feasible, due to a lower long-term risk of re-infestation from the soil seed bank.

Reducing canola <b>seed</b> <b>loss</b> and seedbank persistence {{can be an important}} strategy to reduce the incidence of volunteer weeds. The primary hypothesis of this research was that canola seedbank addition and dormancy induction in the seed are affected by genotype and harvest method. To test this hypothesis, three studies were conducted with the following objectives: i) to determine canola seedbank addition from windrowing and direct-harvesting operations on commercial farms in western Canada, ii) to determine agronomic- and harvest-related factors that may increase <b>seed</b> <b>loss</b> in canola, iii) to determine the effect of stage of crop maturity at harvest on potential to develop seed dormancy in canola, iv) to evaluate canola genotypes and harvest methods to reduce canola seedbank addition. A total of 66 canola fields were surveyed across Saskatchewan in 2010 and 2011. Shattered seeds from these fields were sampled within 3 weeks of harvest by using a vacuum cleaner. Agronomic- and harvest-related data were collected for each field using questionnaires. In a separate small plot study the effects of harvest methods (windrowing and direct-harvesting) and pod sealant products (Pod-Stik® and Pod Ceal DC®) on <b>seed</b> <b>loss</b> in five canola genotypes (InVigor 5440, RR 45 H 26, InVigor 5020, RR 4362, and CL 8571) were evaluated in 2010 and 2011. In both years, 6 harvest samples were collected weekly from InVigor 5440 and InVigor 5020 genotypes starting at early stage of crop maturity until harvest to assess the effect of seed maturity on dormancy induction. On commercial farms, the average seedbank addition was 5, 821 viable seeds m- 2, which was equivalent to 7. 3 % of the total seed yield. There was no difference in the reported yield and seedbank addition between windrowed and direct-harvested canola on commercial farms. But in the small plot study, windrowing resulted in higher seedbank addition. Higher seedbank addition was observed when the yield of canola was higher and when producers had a larger area seeded to canola. The observed seedbank addition was also higher in Roundup Ready genotypes and when a conventional combine harvester was used to harvest canola. Little primary dormancy and low potential to secondary dormancy induction was observed in InVigor 5440 and InVigor 5020 seeds at an early stage of crop maturity. But at full maturity seeds of both genotypes had no primary dormancy but showed high potential for secondary dormancy induction. This indicates that windrowing the evaluated genotypes at early stage of crop maturity lowered the potential for secondary dormancy induction. There were appreciable differences in seedbank addition among the evaluated canola genotypes but pod sealant products did not affect seed yield and seed shatter in canola.

40|$|Overland {{flow and}} {{sediment}} transport can carry away seeds at {{the soil surface}} and in the soil, cause a secondary seed dispersal event, lead to seed redistribution, and influence the spatial distribution of seedling renewal, which {{plays an important role}} in vegetation restoration and succession. The objectives of this study were to investigate the process of <b>seed</b> <b>loss</b> on loess slopes and its relationship to the yield of runoff and sediment, the effects of rainfall intensity, slope gradient and seed morphology on seed removal. Rainfall simulation experiments were carried out in 1 m(2) plots on 10 degrees, 15 degrees, 20 degrees and 25 degrees loess slopes for a 60 -minute duration with intensities of 50 mm/h, 100 mm/h and 150 mm/h, respectively. A mixture of 75 seeds from 16 species on the Chinese hilly-gullied Loess Plateau had been placed in these plots, and we measured the number of seeds lost, the distance seeds displaced, the runoff rate and amount, and soil loss rate and amount. Results showed that the accumulated <b>seed</b> <b>loss</b> rates in the rainfall process were closely related to the corresponding sediment yield, and even more closely related to the runoff amount. The seed removal obviously increased with rainfall intensity but did not obviously change with slope gradient, and results varied among species. At 50 mm/h rainfall, there was almost no <b>seed</b> <b>loss</b> on the four slopes, but 30 - 45 % of the seeds moved from their original position. However, 79. 5 % and 86. 4 % of the seeds were eroded at 100 mm/h and 150 mm/h, respectively. Of these, 46. 9 % and 20. 4 % of the seeds were displaced, and 32. 6 % and 66. 0 % of the seeds were lost. Total seed removal was also affected by the seed amount and position on slopes, species composition of the seeds, and slope length. It was suggested that seed removal during water erosion events can affect seed redistribution and, consequently, species composition and vegetation spatial distribution. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

30|$|There was a wide {{variation}} in <b>seed</b> <b>losses</b> between species, {{which could not}} be quantitatively explained by seed weight, size or shape indexes. Other features, such as mucilage secretion and the presence of appendices like as hairs or wings, may explain the differences in <b>seed</b> <b>losses</b> at the species level [9]. Seeds have specific mechanisms to avoid remobilization by water erosion, which may obscure the relationships between seed removal and seed quantitative indexes such as size or weight [9]. Combined with our pre-experiment, seed loss of some species are mainly affected by seed weight. For example, the seeds of RX, AS, Malus baccata, Ziziphus jujuba, Chinese date, Glycine max and Zea mays with weights over 190 mg were able to avoid loss, while the light seeds of HA, DC and BI had high loss rates. Some species are mainly due to seed shape, such as the elongated seed of BB and Stipa grandis had low loss rate and the winged fruit of Acer ginnala could avoid loss; while the spherical-shaped seed of SV had higher seed loss rate. Some are affected by seed surface structure, such as LD seeds, which have a smooth surface, were easily washed away. While DM seeds, having the ability to secrete mucilage under moist conditions, do not show loss in any of the experiment events. In short, seed removal effected by its specific morphology characteristics, and the seeds form different species have various responses to water erosion.|$|E

In addition, non-fatal damage by seed predatorsmay allow infection by fungi responsible for post-dispersal <b>seed</b> <b>losses.</b> The objectives {{of this study}} were (1) to quantify pre-dispersalseed predation and fungal infection in a Neotropical tree species, Luehea seemannii, that produces dehiscent fruits and wind-dispersedseeds, and (2) to link pre-dispersal effects on seed quality to seed survival in the soil. To examine how seed predators and fungi inﬂu-ence <b>seed</b> <b>losses,</b> mesh exclosures, fungicide, and the combination of both treatments were applied to separate branches in the canopyof trees in Gamboa and Parque Natural Metropolitano (PNM), Panama. To determine if treatments affect seed viability and survival inthe soil, half of the seeds collected from each treatment were buried for 4 weeks in forest soils and subsequently allowed to germinatebefore and after the breaking of dormancy. Overall, 24 percent of developing fruit were lost to insect attack. In contrast, fungi infectedonly 3 percent of seeds at the pre-dispersal stage. For seeds germinated directly after collection, fungicide signiﬁcantly increased germi-nation in the wetter site (Gamboa) but decreased germination in the drier site (PNM). The pre-dispersal insect exclosure treatmentincreased the fraction of seeds that remained dormant after burial in the soil. This result suggests that exposure to insect predators maycause physical damage to seeds that results in the loss of physical dormancy but does not necessarily increase the susceptibility of seedsto pathog en attack in the soil...|$|E
30|$|The role {{of water}} erosion on <b>seed</b> <b>loss</b> and on plant {{establishment}} and distribution is unknown on the Chinese Loess Plateau, which suffers serious soil erosion. The seed susceptibility of 16 local species to removal by water erosion from loess slopes {{was determined by}} rainfall simulation experiments. The experiments were performed on slopes with gradients of 10 °, 15 °, 20 ° and 25 ° for a 60 -min duration at an intensity of 50 mm/h, 100 mm/h and 150 mm/h, respectively. The total seed removal rate obviously increased with rainfall intensity but did not obviously change with slope gradient, and the responses were varied among the species. The morphological characteristics affecting <b>seed</b> <b>loss</b> of the various species are quite different. Our experiments showed that the seed removal from some species are mainly due to seed weight, some species are mainly affected by seed shape, some are affected by appendage, some by surface structure, some by the comprehensive effects of the different morphological characteristics, while seeds having mucilage secretion are not easily moved by water erosion. We argued that the seed removal during water erosion can clearly effect seed redistribution and deposition, and consequently, species composition and vegetation spatial distribution.|$|R

40|$|In field {{experiments}} (1993 – 1998) {{using an}} annual self-pollinated vetch species, Vicia angustifolia, {{the effects of}} pre-dispersal seed predators (pre-DSPs) on plant performance and demography were studied. Insect exclusion by insecticides, vegetation perturbation {{at the start of}} the experiment by removing the top soil layer, and sowing extra seeds were applied at one site (Site 1) on 32 plots, and only insect exclusion at another site (Site 2) on 14 plots, respectively, in the plant’s natural habitat. The number of seedlings was influenced most by perturbation at Site 1. There were 2 – 4 times more seedlings on bare plots in comparison with vegetation-covered plots, although significant difference was detected only in 1993, 1994 and 1997. Density of adult plants was lower on vegetation-covered plots. Dry matter, height, length of branches, and of pods were positively affected by perturbation on Site 1. The number of seeds infested by pre-DSPs was generally low, however, it was higher on unsprayed plots, regardless whether the plot was perturbed or not. Overall, <b>seed</b> <b>loss</b> to pre-DSPs was only ca. 10 %. Sowing extra seeds among vegetation increased net plant recruitment demonstrating that microsites were available in the habitat. V. angustifolia is assumed to be a weak competitor and, in spite of the low percentage of <b>seed</b> <b>loss</b> to pre-DSPs, it is most likely limited by seed number. Th...|$|R
