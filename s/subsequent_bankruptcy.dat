While {{on a date with}} the sexaroid, Vanilla recovers her memories of having been ordered to bury her master's corpse by her mistress. Meanwhile, Ichiro is captured by agents of the SG Corporation. Learning of this, the sexaroid leaves to rescue him, against the wishes of another reprogrammer, Psycho Candy. Captured, tagged for destruction, and reunited with Ichiro, the sexaroid finds himself ordered by Ichiro to switch places with him and escape. Ichiro then gives the sexaroid a name, Itsuki. With Itsuki's tag for destruction, Ichiro is killed at the moment his father finally recognizes him.

50|$|On 26 January 1934, the Western Mining Corporation {{and four}} of its {{directors}} sued {{the members of the}} Australian Air Convention, alleging false and malicious accusations contained in the circular by the Convention had damaged both Western and its directors. When the case went to trial in June 1934, Larkin and Convention Chairman W. T. Shaw attempted to prove they had no malicious intent. WMC's counsel entered into evidence both Larkin's unsuccessful prior accusation of Secretary Shepherd and a letter alleging corruption addressed to the Bribery and Secret Commissions Prevention League. WMC's Company Secretary and three members of the Board of Directors testified there were no aerial survey contract discussions. The three other members of the Convention publicly disavowed the circular and were dropped from the suit. The final weight of the ensuing loss of the suit fell entirely upon Larkin and Shaw. Their <b>subsequent</b> <b>bankruptcies</b> left Larkin as a salaried manager in his own liquidated company, Larkin Aircraft Supply Company. Larkin subsequently left for Europe in 1937.|$|R

The architect, however, fell out with the CPR {{and went to work}} for their competition, the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway.

500|$|Cleveland's {{military}} policy emphasized self-defense and modernization. In 1885 Cleveland appointed the Board of Fortifications under Secretary of War William C. Endicott {{to recommend a}} new coastal fortification system for the United States. No improvements to US coastal defenses had been made since the late 1870s. The Board's 1886 report recommended a massive $127 million construction program at 29 harbors and river estuaries, to include new breech-loading rifled guns, mortars, and naval minefields. The Board and the program are usually called the Endicott Board and the Endicott Program. Most of the Board's recommendations were implemented, and by 1910, 27 locations were defended by over 70 forts. Many of the weapons remained in place until scrapped in World War II as they were replaced with new defenses. Endicott also proposed to Congress a system of examinations for Army officer promotions. For the Navy, the Cleveland administration spearheaded by Secretary of the Navy William Collins Whitney moved towards modernization, although no ships were constructed that could match the best European warships. Although completion of the four steel-hulled warships begun under the previous administration was delayed due to a corruption investigation and <b>subsequent</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> of their building yard, these ships were completed {{in a timely manner}} in naval shipyards once the investigation was over.
