2500|$|Despite the {{completion}} of the building, the [...] "governor's palace" [...] was never used as a palace. The building became too cramped for its original intention as a palace and so in 1869 a new palace for the governor was planned. The new palace, known as the Paleis te Koningsplein, was completed in 1873 facing Koningsplein (King's Square). Over the years it has housed numerous government bureaus and departments including the post office, the <b>state</b> <b>printing</b> <b>office,</b> the general clerk's department, and the high court at the ground floor of the main building (1835). On May 1, 1848, the High Court ((Hoogeregtshof, Hoogerechter, Algemene Secretarie) was relocated to a building north of the Daendels Palace.|$|E
