5|$|Fame was {{the last}} musical film to be {{produced}} by MGM, before the studio merged with United Artists in 1981. The film has been credited with revitalizing the teen musical subgenre by adding dramatic elements into its story, echoing 1950s melodramas. Its presentation of musical numbers {{in the style of}} a music video—through the use of quick cuts with multiple angles and crowded, kinetic frames—was a major influence on other 1980s films in the dance film genre, such as Flashdance (1983), Footloose (1984) and Dirty Dancing (1987). It also inspired the creation of many similar performing arts <b>schools</b> <b>around</b> the world—notably the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts (LIPA)— and popularized the use of leg warmers.|$|E

5|$|As all cadets are {{commissioned}} {{as second}} lieutenants upon graduation, military and leadership education is nested with academic instruction. Military training and discipline {{fall under the}} purview of the Office of the Commandant. Entering freshmen, or fourth class cadets, are referred to as New Cadets, and enter the academy on Reception Day or R-day, which marks the start of cadet basic training (CBT), known colloquially as Beast Barracks, or simply Beast. Most cadets consider Beast to be their most difficult time at the academy because of the transition from civilian to military life. Their second summer, cadets undergo cadet field training (CFT) at nearby Camp Buckner, where they train in more advanced field craft and military skills. During a cadet's third summer, they may serve as instructors for CBT or CFT. Rising Firstie (senior) cadets also spend one-month training at Camp Buckner, where they train for modern tactical situations that they will soon face as new platoon leaders. Cadets also have the opportunity during their second, third and fourth summers to serve in active army units and military <b>schools</b> <b>around</b> the world. The schools include Airborne, Air Assault, Sapper, Pathfinder, etc.|$|E
