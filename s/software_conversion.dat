50|$|Additionally, the Akiko chip is able {{to perform}} simple 'chunky' to 'planar' {{graphics}} conversion in hardware. The Amiga's native display is a planar display which is simple and efficient to manipulate for routines like scrolling. However, chunky displays are faster and more efficient for 3D graphics manipulation. Akiko allows this conversion to be performed in hardware instead of relying on <b>software</b> <b>conversion</b> which would cause more overhead. The conversion works by writing 32 8-bit chunky pixels to Akiko's registers and reading back eight 32-bit words of converted planar data which can then be copied to the display buffer.|$|E

5000|$|PETSCII {{also has}} a text mode, in which {{lowercase}} letters occupy the range $41 - $5A, and uppercase letters occupy the range $C1 - $DA. The text mode is not available at powerup, but must be actuated by holding one of the SHIFT keys and then press and release the Commodore key. Regardless of whether the chip has undergone this graphic [...] "shift", there are block graphic characters {{in the range of}} $E0-FF. This serves to distinguish PETSCII from those kinds of ASCII that go back no farther than ASCII-1967, so any text transfer between an 8-bit Commodore machine and one that uses 1967-derived ASCII would result in text where uppercase letters appear to be lowercase, and lowercase letters uppercase. There is no easy Boolean operation to change these cases to the proper case. Thus, as with other computers based on non-standard-ASCII character sets, <b>software</b> <b>conversion</b> is needed when exchanging text files and/or telecommunicating with standard ASCII systems. The other ranges are unchanged in shifted mode; this means that the other characters added in ASCII-1967 besides lowercase lettersi.e. the grave accent, curly braces, vertical bar, and tildedo not exist in PETSCII.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare virtual {{volume to}} {{intraoperative}} volume and weight measurements of resected liver specimen and calculate appropriate conversion factors to reach better correlation. METHODS: Preoperative (CT-group, n= 30; MRI-group, n= 30) and postoperative MRI (n= 60) imaging {{was performed in}} 60 patients undergoing partial liver resection. Intraoperative volume and weight of the resected liver specimen was measured. Virtual volume measurements were performed by two readers (R 1,R 2) using dedicated <b>software.</b> <b>Conversion</b> factors were calculated. RESULTS: Mean intraoperative resection weight/volume: CT: 855 g/ 852 mL; MRI: 872 g/ 860 mL. Virtual resection volume: CT: 960 mL(R 1), 982 mL(R 2); MRI: 1112 mL(R 1), 1115 mL(R 2). Strong positive correlation for both readers between intraoperative and virtual measurements, mean of both readers: CT: R= 0. 88 (volume), R= 0. 89 (weight); MRI: R= 0. 95 (volume), R= 0. 92 (weight). Conversion factors: 0. 85 (CT), 0. 78 (MRI). CONCLUSION: CT- or MRI-based volumetry of resected liver specimen is accurate and recommended for preoperative planning. A conversion of the result is necessary to improve intraoperative and virtual measurement correlation. We found 0. 85 for CT- and 0. 78 for MRI-based volumetry the most appropriate conversion factors...|$|E

The tutor, known as Sherlock, {{is directed at}} teaching the diagnostic procedures necessary to investigate complex test equipment used to maintain F- 15 fighter aircraft. Since Dr. Gott's presentation in 1987, the tutor has undergone field testing at two Air Force F- 15 flying wings. The results of the field test showed that after an average of 20 hours on the tutor, the 16 airmen {{in the experimental group}} (who average 28 months of experience) showed significant performance gains when compared to a control group (having a mean experience level of 37 months) who continued participating in the existing on-the-job training program.

40|$|Control of AC {{induction}} machines {{using the}} vector control techniques {{is becoming more}} popular nowadays. The need for extensive computations has no more become an objection to the vector controlimplementation. This {{is due to the}} wide availability of high speed digital processors [...] The objective of vector control of induction machine is to allow an induction machine to be controlled just like a separately excited dc machine. When the dynamic equations for an induction machine is transformed by means of rotating transformation methods into a reference frame that coincides with rotor flux, the results become similar to that of a DC machine. This allows AC machine to be controlled just like a DC machine. This method of decoupling the variables and controlling them independently is termed as vector control. To relieve the controller from the time consuming computational task of PWM signal generation, a novel method of Space Vector PWM signal generation is implemented in FPGA using Hardware Description Language VHDL. The Space Vector PWM pulses are first designed in MATLAB/SIMULNK environment and relevant coding are written to generate the pulses and then by using <b>software</b> <b>conversion</b> tool the M files are converted into VHDL coding. Thus the triggering pulses are given to the inverter circuit and the induction motor operates. The switching pattern generated will reduce the harmonic content and switching losses...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThere are three major thrusts to this thesis. The first was {{to design and}} build a device to measure ground speed for testing the position estimating capabilities of the Small Autonomous Navigation System (SANS) filter. The ground tests consisted by placing the SANS unit on a golf cart and maneuvering it along a known track. The speed sensing device uses a bicycle wheel attached to the golf cart along with an appropriate time to speed <b>software</b> <b>conversion.</b> The next problem {{was to determine if}} the existing paddle wheel in use would be accurate enough for the SANS to conduct underway tests. To perform this, a mechanism had to be built to channel water and measure its speed while allowing the paddle wheel to be in the flow. Finally, the electronic compass was found to have heading dependent errors, thus a test was designed to determine its deviation. This was performed by swinging the compass using a transit aligned with its axis. This established a deviation table that was inserted into the SANS code, further refining its directional capabilities. As a final test for determining the effectiveness of the calibrated inputs, tests were conducted that showed that the SANS filter is capable of obtaining 3 meter accuracy with no Global Positioning Update for an excess of two minutes.
