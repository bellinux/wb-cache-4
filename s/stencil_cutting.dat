500|$|The {{general design}} of Oliver {{typewriters}} remained mostly unchanged throughout the company's history. The Olivers are [...] "down strike" [...] typewriters, meaning the typebars strike the platen (also {{known as the}} roller) from above, rather than from below ("up strike") or from the front ("front strike"). Unlike the [...] "up strike" [...] method, which prints text out of sight {{on the underside of}} the platen, the [...] "down strike" [...] is a [...] "visible print" [...] design, meaning the full page is visible to the typist as the text is being entered. The relatively greater striking power of the [...] "down strike" [...] design led Olivers to be preferred for specialty uses such as <b>stencil</b> <b>cutting</b> or [...] "manifolding" [...] (copying using carbon paper). The [...] "front strike" [...] method, a competing [...] "visible print" [...] design, was patented around the same time (1889–91), but an effective machine that did not interfere with the typist’s line of sight was not available until 1897 when, roughly three years after the introduction of the Oliver No. 1, the Underwood No. 1 appeared on the market.|$|E

50|$|Gestetner, Risograph, {{and other}} {{companies}} still make and sell highly automated mimeograph-like machines that are externally similar to photocopiers. The modern version of a mimeograph, called a digital duplicator, or copyprinter, contains a scanner, a thermal head for <b>stencil</b> <b>cutting,</b> and a large roll of stencil material entirely inside the unit. The stencil material consists of a very thin polymer film laminated to a long-fibre non-woven tissue. It makes the stencils and mounts and unmounts them from the print drum automatically, making it almost as easy to operate as a photocopier. The Risograph is {{the best known of}} these machines.|$|E

40|$|A yukata is {{the same}} shape {{regardless}} of the wearer's height or weight. An arrangement of its texture pattern becomes an important factor for designing the yukata. It is desirable to draw the cutting pattern so that the yukata is {{set up for the}} wearer. Because drawing the cutting pattern requires great skill, it causes difficulties for beginners. In this paper, the authors propose a CAD system that support designers for drawing cutting patterns: (1) by using this CAD system, beginners can draw cutting patterns of yukatas which are in harmony with the wearer's personality; (2) by the texture analysis of the striped pattern and the <b>stencil</b> pattern, the <b>cutting</b> pattern is drawn semi-automatically </p...|$|R
2500|$|Some ribbons were inked {{in black}} and red stripes, each being half the width and running {{the entire length of}} the ribbon. A lever on most {{machines}} allowed switching between colors, which was useful for bookkeeping entries where negative amounts were highlighted in red. The red color was also used on some selected characters in running text, for emphasis. [...] When a typewriter had this facility, it could still be fitted with a solid black ribbon; the lever was then used to switch to fresh ribbon when the first stripe ran out of ink. [...] Some typewriters also had a third position which stopped the ribbon being struck at all. [...] This enabled the keys to hit the paper unobstructed, and was used for <b>cutting</b> <b>stencils</b> for stencil duplicators (aka mimeograph machines).|$|R
50|$|The College's {{history is}} finely {{intertwined}} {{with that of}} the South London Gallery, with which the College shares its site. Manager of the South London Working Men's College in 1868, William Rossiter, purchased the freehold of Portland House on which the College now stands in 1889. The resulting Gallery opened in 1891, followed by the Technical Institute, the school's first guise in 1898. The philanthropist, John Passmore Edwards, gave a substantial sum of money for the erection of the building in memory of Lord Leighton. The architect was Maurice Bingham Adams. The school and gallery were the fruition of an artistic movement in Camberwell, supported by Edward Burne-Jones, Lord Leighton, Walter Crane and G F Watts. The school aimed to give the 'best artistic and technical education to all classes in the district'. Originally, the school offered classes in specific trades, such as architecture, cabinet design, embroidery, wood carving, wood block and <b>stencil</b> <b>cutting.</b> By 1920, a Fine Art Department had been created.|$|E

40|$|Solder paste masks or stencils are an {{integral}} part of the manufacturing process for surface mount PCBs. This study examines the feasibility of a process for rapid creation of a solder paste stencil using thermoplastic material. CNC laser <b>cutting</b> of the <b>stencil</b> geometry is replacing traditional use of chemical etching on metal sheets to produce <b>stencils.</b> Laser <b>cutting</b> has been used to improve process speed, accuracy, and cost. This research attempts to continue to simplify and reduce costs in the stencil making process by proposing as the stencil material a common thermoplastic that can be cut easily and quickly using a low-power rapid-prototyping laser process. The effects of several variables on the success of the process are experimentally tested to determine a feasible solution. Various solder pastes and solder material characteristics are studied for their effect on the new material. Stencil dimensions, including thickness and aperture characteristics, are examined. Several key process factors are also varied in the tests to determine recommendations for settings such as print direction, alignment procedures, squeegee pressure and attack angle, print speed, and stencil release method. Subjective evaluation is also made of important qualities of the paste in reaction to the new material, including paste roll and consistency, paste volume, adherence, and instances of cold slumping. The resulting process is demonstrated by producing plastic stencils on a rapid prototyping laser housed in the Cal Poly laboratories. Cost, cycle time, and performance characteristics of the plastic stencil are estimated...|$|R
