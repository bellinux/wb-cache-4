The fervent patriotism displayed by Canadian Broadcasting Corporation analyst Don Cherry in the aftermath led to a <b>sharp</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> his own popularity with Canadian fans. Several players in that game went on to play in the National Hockey League, including Brendan Shanahan, Theoren Fleury, Sergei Fedorov, Alexander Mogilny and Vladimir Konstantinov.|$|E
5|$|The {{pipeline}} {{was built}} between 1974 and 1977 after the 1973 oil crisis caused a <b>sharp</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> oil {{prices in the}} United States. This rise made exploration of the Prudhoe Bay oil field economically feasible. Environmental, legal, and political debates followed the discovery of oil at Prudhoe Bay in 1968, and the pipeline was built only after the oil crisis provoked the passage of legislation designed to remove legal challenges to the project.|$|E
5|$|Historically Bournemouth has {{suffered}} from negative rates of natural increase and has relied on immigration to maintain population growth. In 2007 however, births exceeded deaths for the first time, and this trend has continued through to 2011. This, coupled with {{a substantial increase in}} people moving into the area, has led to a <b>sharp</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> the resident population since 2001. Of the total population, 3.3% are 85 or over, compared to 2.2% nationally; however the largest group of people moving into the area are students in the 16-24-year age group, and 9% of the current population are between 20 and 24. In England this age group accounts for only 7%.|$|E

The population is primarily African American, which has maintained deep roots in the community for many years. There is a growing Hispanic and White population.|$|R
5|$|Pain is classed as acute (short term) {{or chronic}} (long term). Chronic pain may be {{continuous}} with occasional <b>sharp</b> <b>rises</b> <b>in</b> intensity (flares), or intermittent: periods of painlessness interspersed with periods of pain.

5|$|While {{the number}} of license holders started to rise gradually, firearm sales rose even faster in 2015, mostly {{prompted}} by the EU efforts to restrict law abiding citizens' access to firearms. Average annual rise in {{the number of}} registered firearms amounted to 14,500 guns between 2006 and 2014, there were 54,508 new registered firearms in 2015 alone. Local tendencies generally follow the nationwide trend, however any worsening of security in any given district is often followed by a <b>sharp</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> gun ownership therein. For example, in 2011, after a wave of racially motivated attacks by Romani perpetrators against majority population victims, there was a rise of gun ownership in Šluknov Hook area.|$|E
5|$|In November 2010, the PTC {{released}} a study, Habitat for Profanity: Broadcast TV's Sharp Increase in Foul Language, which claims {{that there was}} a <b>sharp</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> the usage of profanity between 2005 and 2010—during the 8PM to 9PM ET/PT time period commonly referred to them as the Family Viewing Hour, the PTC claimed that there were 111 instances of profanity during this hour in 2010 versus 10 in 2005; during all of prime time, 276 instances in 2010 against 11 in 2005. The study claimed {{that there was a}} 69.3% increase in prime time in general between 2005 and 2010, with the Fox network being heavily accused of bringing a 269% increase for the network during that period. The study also claimed instances in which there was profanity, but the offending word was bleeped out.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of the republic, Istanbul was {{overlooked}} in favor of Ankara, selected as Turkey's capital to distance the new, secular country from its Ottoman history. From the late 1940s and early 1950s, Istanbul underwent great structural change, as new public squares, boulevards, and avenues were constructed throughout the city, sometimes at the expense of historical buildings. The population of Istanbul began to rapidly increase in the 1970s, as people from Anatolia migrated to the city to find employment in the many new factories that were built on the outskirts of the sprawling metropolis. This sudden, <b>sharp</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> the city's population caused a large demand for housing, and many previously outlying villages and forests became engulfed into the metropolitan area of Istanbul.|$|E
50|$|Lean {{mixtures}} {{improve the}} fuel economy but also cause <b>sharp</b> <b>rises</b> <b>in</b> {{the amount of}} nitrogen oxides (NOX). If the mixture becomes too lean, the engine may fail to ignite, causing misfire and a large increase in unburned hydrocarbon (HC) emissions. Lean mixtures burn hotter and may cause rough idle, hard starting and stalling, and can even damage the catalytic converter, or burn valves in the engine. The risk of spark knock/engine knocking (detonation) is also increased when the engine is under load.|$|R

5|$|For {{the next}} three hundred years, Scotland was {{directly}} governed by the Parliament of Great Britain and the subsequent Parliament of the United Kingdom, both seated at Westminster, {{and the lack of}} a Parliament of Scotland remained an important element in Scottish national identity. Suggestions for a 'devolved' Parliament were made before 1914, but were shelved due to the outbreak of the First World War. A <b>sharp</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> nationalism in Scotland during the late 1960s fuelled demands for some form of home rule or complete independence, and in 1969 prompted the incumbent Labour government of Harold Wilson to set up the Kilbrandon Commission to consider the British constitution. One of the principal objectives of the commission was to examine ways of enabling more self-government for Scotland, within the unitary state of the United Kingdom. Kilbrandon published his report in 1973 recommending the establishment of a directly elected Scottish Assembly to legislate for the majority of domestic Scottish affairs.|$|E
5|$|In October 1973, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC, {{consisting}} of the Arab majority of OPEC plus Egypt and Syria) declared significant production cuts and an oil embargo against the United States and other industrialized nations that supported Israel in the Yom Kippur War. A previous embargo attempt was largely ineffective {{in response to the}} Six-Day War in 1967. However, in 1973, the result was a <b>sharp</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> oil prices and OPEC revenues, from US$3/bbl to US$12/bbl, and an emergency period of energy rationing, intensified by panic reactions, a declining trend in US oil production, currency devaluations, and a lengthy UK coal-miners dispute. For a time, the UK imposed an emergency three-day workweek. Seven European nations banned non-essential Sunday driving. US gas stations limited the amount of gasoline that could be dispensed, closed on Sundays, and restricted the days when gasoline could be purchased, based on license plate numbers. Even after the embargo ended in March 1974 following intense diplomatic activity, prices continued to rise. The world experienced a global economic recession, with unemployment and inflation surging simultaneously, steep declines in stock and bond prices, major shifts in trade balances and petrodollar flows, and a dramatic end to the post-WWII economic boom.|$|E
5|$|Quarrington was a rural {{community}} {{during the early}} and middle Anglo-Saxon period while mills along the River Slea in the Middle Ages gave the village its alternative name of Millthorpe. The Bishop of Lincoln and Ramsey Abbey held manors in Quarrington after the Norman Conquest, but the Carre family of Sleaford were the principal land-owners between 1559 and 1683, when its estate passed by marriage to the Marquesses of Bristol. Although the growth of Victorian Sleaford saw the town encroach into the parish's boundaries, the old village remained a small cluster of farm buildings and cottages for much of its history. The sale {{of most of the}} surrounding farmland by successive Marquesses of Bristol in the late 20th century led to the rapid development of residential estates on Quarrington Hill and in New Quarrington which have engulfed the original settlement. Low crime rates, affordable housing, high standards of living and access to good schools have attracted home-buyers to the area, contributing to a <b>sharp</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> the population.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{technological}} advances, about 34,000 {{people die}} {{every year in}} the U.S. Although the fatality rates per vehicle registered and per vehicle distance travelled have steadily decreased since the advent of significant vehicle and driver regulation, the raw number of fatalities generally increases as a function of rising population and more vehicles on the road. However, <b>sharp</b> <b>rises</b> <b>in</b> the price of fuel and related driver behavioural changes are reducing 2007-8 highway fatalities in the U.S. to below the 1961 fatality count. Litigation has been central in the struggle to mandate safer cars.|$|R

Relative deprivation reflects conditions of worsening relative poverty despite striking reductions in absolute poverty. The effects of relative deprivation explain why average happiness has been stagnant over time despite <b>sharp</b> <b>rises</b> <b>in</b> income. Consumption taxes on status-seeking spending, along with official and traditional sanctions on excess consumption and redistributive policies may lessen the negative impact of relative deprivation on well-being...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{hypothesis}} that high home-ownership damages the labor market. We show that <b>rises</b> <b>in</b> the home-ownership rate in a U. S. state are a precursor to eventual <b>sharp</b> <b>rises</b> <b>in</b> unemployment in that state. The elasticity exceeds unity: a doubling of the rate of home-ownership in a U. S. state is followed in the long-run {{by more than a}} doubling of the later unemployment rate. What mechanisms might explain this? We provide evidence that <b>rises</b> <b>in</b> home-ownership are associated with three potential concerns: (i) lower levels of labor mobility, (ii) greater commuting times, and (iii) fewer new businesses. Our argument is not that owners are disproportionately unemployed, nor that the observed patterns are due to Keynesian effects. The evidence implies, instead, that the housing market may produce negative 'externalities' upon the labor market. The time lags are long. That gradualness may explain why these patterns remain little-known...|$|R
