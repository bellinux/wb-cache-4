5|$|Perhaps {{because of}} her {{traumatic}} childhood, Sidle has demonstrated compassion and empathy for victims of domestic violence, and fury against their abusers. She also has a <b>soft</b> <b>spot</b> <b>for</b> animals, and became a vegetarian after she saw Grissom conduct an experiment on a dead pig. She has also shown a tendency to become very aggressive when under pressure or annoyed, especially in cases involving abused women - such as her arguments with Catherine and Ecklie, and engaging in a heated argument with a man suspected of murdering his wife. In recent years, perhaps {{because of her}} mother's schizophrenia, she has been seen to work several cases with a mental health aspect.|$|E
5|$|The {{club has}} also {{time and again}} shown to have a <b>soft</b> <b>spot</b> <b>for</b> clubs in {{financial}} disarray. Repeatedly the club has supported its local rival 1860 Munich with gratuitous friendlies, transfers at favourable rates, and direct money transfers. Also when St. Pauli threatened to lose its license for professional football due to financial problems, Bayern met the club for a friendly game free of any charge, giving all revenues to St. Pauli. More recently when Mark van Bommel's home club Fortuna Sittard was in financial distress Bayern came to a charity game at the Dutch club. Another well known example was the transfer of Alexander Zickler in 1993 from Dynamo Dresden. When Bayern picked up Zickler for 2.3 Million DM many considered the sum to be a subvention for the financially threatened Dresdeners. In 2003, Bayern provided a 2 Million Euro loan without collateral to the nearly bankrupt Borussia Dortmund which has since been repaid. On 14 July 2013, Bayern played a charity game against financially threatened third division Hansa Rostock. The game raised about €1 million, securing Hansa's licence.|$|E

2500|$|When Lucas {{drafted the}} script for The Phantom Menace, he envisioned a [...] "link between Padmé and Princess Leia, the {{daughter}} who follows so closely in her footsteps." [...] According to Natalie Portman, [...] "It definitely did come into play how strong and smart a character Carrie Fisher portrayed, because I {{think that a lot}} of that is passed on from parent to child. I think George wrote Amidala as a strong, smart character, but it helped to know that I had this great woman before me who had portrayed her character as a fiery woman." [...] Paul McDonald notes that there are [...] "inevitable comparisons" [...] between the two characters: [...] "both develop <b>soft</b> <b>spots</b> <b>for</b> rogue pilots, and both have a knack for slipping into and out of stilted British accents." [...] Despite being diplomats, each is also the best marksman of her respective trilogy, rarely missing.|$|R

500|$|Off-screen Wolfenden, Hardwick and Chittel {{were thrilled}} by Amy's inclusion. Wolfenden said Halfpenny's acting skill has [...] "freshened {{the whole place}} up." [...] In comparison, David was {{initially}} hostile to Amy's inclusion in his family. However, in one storyline his attitude towards her softens and results in Amy developing feelings for him. Wolfenden said David [...] "has a <b>soft</b> <b>spot</b> <b>for</b> Amy" [...] and flirted with her. Over time he began to see her as his [...] "little sister." [...] When David's girlfriend, Leyla Harding (Roxy Shahidi) accuses Amy of stealing from the shop, David proves her innocence by exposing Alicia Gallagher (Natalie Anderson) as the thief. Wolfenden added that David has given out the wrong signals and acted naive during the story arc. Wolfenden explained that Amy misreads the signs because [...] "she never had that sort of affection {{when she was growing}} up." [...] Amy kisses David which shocks him, though Wolfenden felt it should not surprise him. Amy lies to her best friend Victoria Sugden (Isabel Hodgins), claiming she has slept with him and runs away from home.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, while {{attending}} the successful revival of The King and I, Chinese-American playwright David Henry Hwang considered whether other Rodgers and Hammerstein shows could be revived {{and decided to}} work on Flower Drum Song. [...] To Chinese Americans, the musical [...] "represented political incorrectness incarnate. [...] But [...] had a secret <b>soft</b> <b>spot</b> <b>for</b> the movie version. 'It {{was kind of a}} guilty pleasure ... and one of the only big Hollywood films where you could see a lot of really good Asian actors onscreen, singing and dancing and cracking jokes.'" [...] Ted Chapin, president of the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization, announced that an unnamed [...] "Asian playwright" [...] had approached him about revising Flower Drum Song. [...] Chapin called the musical [...] "a naive, old fashioned, anti-feminist story with a truly great score.... It's one that ... needs changes." [...] Rodgers' will urged his heirs to do what they believed he would have agreed to (Hammerstein's instructions are unknown), but during her lifetime, his widow Dorothy had refused to countenance major changes in the plays. [...] Hwang's involvement was soon revealed, and in 1997, C. Y. Lee announced that the rewrite had his approval.|$|E
500|$|Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh {{admitted}} that his government {{was responsible for}} failure in preventing the attacks by MNS on north Indian candidates at Railways examination centres and ordered a probe into the incident, which will also enquire into why the job advertisements where not given in Marathi newspapers. [...] "What has happened is not good. Such incidents take place because of loopholes in the law. One can't hold only the Home Ministry responsible for it, it is (entire) government's responsibility. Such incidents are affecting {{the image of the}} state and I have instructed the DGP to take stern action," [...] Deshmukh said. However, NCP leader Narayan Rane, wrote a piece in 23 October 2008, issue of 'Prahar', in a city newspaper he owns, pleading that Marathis should get their legitimate share in the central government sector. The Times of India noted, the essay indicates that Rane continues to have a <b>soft</b> <b>spot</b> <b>for</b> MNS chief Raj Thackeray– the two were close friends when Rane was in the Sena. Stating that the Marathis were getting a raw deal in central government jobs such as income tax and the railways, Rane said it was perplexing that of 54,000, only 54 Marathis were summoned for the railway recruitment exams. The railways must give Marathis their legitimate share in employment, Rane said.|$|E
50|$|Kabuki is a Taiko Oni {{and is one}} of the antagonists in the movie, having double-crossed Asumu and {{the others}} into believing he cares for humans (as per his staged fight with a Makamou). He also caused trouble among the seven Oni when they were accused of attacking humans (with Nishiki's weapons found beside a murdered man, while it was {{actually}} him who committed it). He revealed that he was disillusioned with his relation with humans because no matter how hard he fights and risks his life for them, they just call him an Oni, a monster, an animal. Thus he forms a pact with the Makamou to become one of them. He has a <b>soft</b> <b>spot,</b> however, <b>for</b> children because even upon his defeat by Hibiki and death at the hands of Hitotsumi, he pleads for Asumu's safety.|$|R
40|$|By {{considering}} the low-frequency vibrational modes of amorphous solids, Manning and Liu [Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 108302 (2011) ] {{showed that a}} population of "soft spots" can be identified that are intimately related to plasticity at zero temperature under quasistatic shear. In this work we track individual <b>soft</b> <b>spots</b> with time in a two-dimensional sheared thermal Lennard Jones glass at temperatures ranging from deep in the glassy regime to above the glass transition temperature. We show that the lifetimes of individual <b>soft</b> <b>spots</b> are correlated with the timescale for structural relaxation. We additionally calculate the number of rearrangements required to destroy <b>soft</b> <b>spots,</b> and show that most <b>soft</b> <b>spots</b> can survive many rearrangements. Finally, we show that <b>soft</b> <b>spots</b> are robust predictors of rearrangements at temperatures well into the super-cooled regime. Altogether, these results {{pave the way for}} mesoscopic theories of plasticity of amorphous solids based on dynamical behavior of individual <b>soft</b> <b>spots.</b> Comment: 9 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} quasi {{localized}} low-frequency modes in the vibrational spectrum {{can be used}} to construct <b>soft</b> <b>spots,</b> or regions vulnerable to rearrangement, which serve as a universal tool for the identification of flow defects in solids. We show that <b>soft</b> <b>spots</b> not only encode spatial information, via their location, but also directional information, via directors for particles within each <b>soft</b> <b>spot.</b> Single crystals with isolated dislocations exhibit low-frequency phonon modes that localize at the core, and their polarization pattern predicts the motion of atoms during elementary dislocation glide in exquisite detail. Even in polycrystals and disordered solids, we find that the directors associated with particles in <b>soft</b> <b>spots</b> are highly correlated with the direction of particle displacements in rearrangements...|$|R
500|$|Together Frank and Peggy ran The Queen Victoria, {{and were}} {{involved}} in various family and business crises, including a [...] "tug-of-war" [...] for their public house with [...] "cuckoo-in-the-nest" [...] Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass). After taking time off in 2000 due to ill-health, Reid {{announced that he was}} quitting the soap in May 2000. After Reid publicly declared that he would love Frank to have a last fling with Pat before he left, EastEnders bosses granted his wish and an affair was scripted. The pair enjoyed a liaison on a Spanish beach during a week-long August special set on the Costa Blanca, which saw Frank and Peggy go away with Pat and Roy and Terry and Irene Raymond (Gavin Richards and Roberta Taylor). A BBC spokesperson said: [...] "Pat is obviously incredibly torn between her love for her husband, Roy, and her old feelings for Frank. She's been hurt by Frank in the past, but she's coming to realise that she still has strong feelings for him and he has made no secret of his <b>soft</b> <b>spot</b> <b>for</b> her. I can confirm they do enjoy a romantic kiss on the beach." [...] On-screen, Pat and Frank's affair continued until they decided, in November 2000, to elope. In the specially extended episode marking Frank's official exit — which aired on 2 November 2000, but was Guy Fawkes Night in the on-screen events – Peggy discovered the affair amidst Frank's attempt to retrieve a letter of confession, following Pat's change of heart.|$|E
500|$|In later episodes, Margaret {{develops}} into a {{more complex}} character. She is shown to be fiercely protective of her marriage to Victor by becoming easily suspicious and jealous. For example, of a Dutch marionette that Victor becomes occupied with repairing in the episode [...] "Hole in the Sky", eventually leading her to destroy it. In [...] "The Affair of the Hollow Lady", a greengrocer (played by Barbara Windsor) develops a <b>soft</b> <b>spot</b> <b>for</b> Victor and tries to convince Margaret {{that he has been}} unfaithful to her. In revenge, Margaret assaults her with a pair of boxing gloves. However, Margaret herself is shown to have contemplated infidelity with a man called Ben whom she met on holiday in the episode [...] "Warm Champagne". She decides against cheating on Victor. In this episode, she sums up her relationship with Victor by telling Ben, [...] "He's the most sensitive person I've ever met, and that's why I love him and why I constantly want to ram his head through a television screen." [...] She also began to develop a sense of cynicism, slowly beginning to see the world the way her husband Victor sees it. This is especially evident in [...] "Things aren't simple anymore" [...] where she voices that the world is [...] "all speed and greed" [...] and that [...] "nobody does anything about anything". In [...] "Rearranging the Dust", Margaret recounts the time she first chose Victor at a party and, during a power cut, [...] "shared their bodies" [...] in the garden. After this moment of passion, they went back inside and when the lights came back on Margaret realised that she had [...] "grabbed hold of the wrong person". Margaret's demeanor seemed to stem from an incident she had at school when she was a child. When she was five, she had two budgies and one day when she opened the door to their cage one flew straight out and hit the window killing itself while the other stayed in the cage despite her best efforts to get it to come out. The next day at school her teacher asked the class to write a story about something that had happened to them so Margaret wrote her story about the budgies. Her teacher made Margaret read it out loud {{in front of the whole}} class which resulted in everyone laughing at her. She then realized that the teacher had done it deliberately just to be cruel to her and knew why the other budgie never wanted to leave its cage.|$|E
