5|$|At 8:00 on {{the morning}} of the Test, there was a storm to the south of London but the rain did not reach Lord's, which was located in the north of the English capital. The first over bowled by Bedser to Barnes was watchfully played to {{complete}} a maiden. The debutant Coxon opened the bowling with Bedser and he removed Barnes for a duck in his second over, caught by Hutton at short fine leg from a <b>short</b> <b>delivery</b> to leave Australia 3/1. Barnes tried to knock the ball through square leg but misjudged the pace of the wicket and played his shot too early, mishitting the ball to Hutton. Coxon bowled from very close to the wickets and left substantial footmarks just outside the right-hander's leg stump in an area ideal for a leg spinner. Although he was not of particularly fast pace, Coxon ran in vigorously and landed heavily after a pronounced delivery stride, making a significant impact on the surface. Bradman received a loud, positive reception from the crowd as he came out to bat in his final Test at Lord's.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{opted to}} field an {{unchanged}} lineup for the Second Test at Lord's, {{the home of}} cricket. Before the match, Barnes wagered £8 at 15/1 on himself to score a century, and trained especially diligently in the lead-up to the Lord's fixture. He was motivated because the Australian Board of Control had given his wife rare permission to attend the match, and the refusal of the authorities at Lord's {{to allow him to}} practise there when he was in London a year earlier; Barnes saw a strong personal performance as an ideal response to what he regarded as a snub. On the first morning, Bradman won the toss and elected to bat, and Barnes continued his run of low scores since the First Test. The first over bowled by Bedser to Barnes was watchfully played to complete a maiden. The debutant Alec Coxon opened the bowling with Bedser and removed Barnes for a duck in his second over, caught by Len Hutton at short fine leg. Barnes tried to knock the <b>short</b> <b>delivery</b> through square leg but misjudged the pace of the wicket and played his shot too early, mishitting the ball to Hutton, and leaving Australia at 1/3. They eventually reached 350 and bowled England out for 215 early on the third day.|$|E
5|$|The debutant Coxon {{opened the}} bowling with Bedser and removed Barnes for a duck {{in his second}} over, caught by Hutton at short fine leg from a <b>short</b> <b>delivery,</b> leaving Australia 3/1. Morris and Bradman rebuilt the innings, taking the score to 87 before Bradman was caught for the third {{consecutive}} time by Hutton in the leg trap off Bedser. Hutton had dropped Bradman in the same position when the Australian captain was on 13. In the meantime, Morris, after a slow start, made 105 runs {{out of a total of}} 166 scored while he was at the wicket, including 14 fours and one six. His innings was noted for powerful, well-placed cover drives. He was out after hitting Coxon to Hutton in the gully, leaving Australia at 166/3. Miller came in and Bedser bowled three consecutive outswingers to him. A fourth ball swung the other way, with Miller not offering a shot. He was given out leg before wicket for four. Brown came in at 173/4 and helped Hassett to rebuild the innings after the two quick wickets of Morris and Miller. Both scored slowly, taking more than three and half minutes on average for each run. Hassett was dropped three times before Yardley bowled him and then trapped Brown lbw in the space of nine runs to leave Australia 225/6. Edrich had Johnson caught behind for four and England were well placed when Australia ended the day on 258/7.|$|E
40|$|Natural {{disasters}} like {{earthquake and}} flood will surely destroy the existing traffic network, usually accompanied by delivery delay or even network collapse. A logistics-network-related delivery time reliability model {{defined by a}} shortest-time entropy is proposed {{as a means to}} estimate the actual delivery time reliability. The less the entropy is, the stronger the delivery time reliability remains, and vice versa. The <b>shortest</b> <b>delivery</b> time is computed separately based on two different assumptions. If a path is concerned without capacity restriction, the <b>shortest</b> <b>delivery</b> time is positively related to the length of the shortest path, and if a path is concerned with capacity restriction, a minimax programming model is built to figure up the <b>shortest</b> <b>delivery</b> time. Finally, an example is utilized to confirm the validity and practicality of the proposed approach...|$|R

25|$|A long hop {{is a type}} of {{inadvertent}} {{delivery in}} the sport of cricket. It describes a <b>short</b> <b>delivery</b> which is not especially fast, which is thus easy for the batsman to hit because he has plenty of time to observe the speed and direction of the ball after the bounce and choose his shot accordingly. In contrast, a fast <b>short</b> <b>delivery</b> which bounces high (to the batsman's chest or higher) is termed a bouncer and is often bowled deliberately because it is difficult to hit safely, due to the height at which it reaches the batsman.|$|E

25|$|He {{looked the}} {{embodiment}} of India's famous opener, Gavaskar, and indeed was {{wearing a pair of}} his pads. While he displayed a full repertoire of strokes in compiling his maiden Test hundred, most remarkable were his off-side shots from the back foot. Though only 5ft 5in tall, he was still able to control without difficulty <b>short</b> <b>deliveries</b> from the English pacemen.|$|R
2500|$|During {{the course}} of their 89-run partnership, neither spin nor pace could unsettle the two batsmen. Then against the run of play, Zaheer Khan got the wicket of Ponting with a <b>short</b> <b>delivery.</b> Damien Martyn walked in at 162/2. He was unhurried and played his own game, which CricInfo writer Anand Vasu wrote, was [...] "very {{pleasing}} to the eye". Finally, when no play was possible due to bad light, Australia had finished at 262/2 from 62 overs at an above-par run-rate of 4.22, with Langer finishing at 115 from 175 balls, and Martyn finishing at 42. At the end of the day, Langer hailed this century as one of his [...] "best".|$|E
2500|$|India {{were reduced}} to shambles at 62/3, and then Ganguly {{came out to the}} middle. Ganguly was the unenviable {{possessor}} of a batting average of below 30 in Australia, and his weakness at handling the <b>short</b> <b>delivery</b> was only too well-documented. Therefore, there were some suggestions that Ganguly would drop himself down the order to no.6, so as to delay facing the Australian pacemen as much as possible. [...] His first scoring shot was a streaky shot between gully and third slip, which brought him three runs. Then he played the odd shot outside the off-stump, but other than a few risky fours, there was nothing to suggest that he would fail. Ganguly then drove Andy Bichel between cover and mid-off for another boundary. This proved to be the integral part of his innings as he was decidedly more at ease and runs started to flow from his bat. Previously, on India's tour of England in 2002, he stroked a 128, which had a lot of unorthodox shots and some savage hitting. This innings, though, seemed to have reclaimed the majesty and beauty that Ganguly's batting had been known for. His footwork was noted to be the most intriguing part of his stay at the wicket. He did not move his feet exaggeratedly during his innings and unfurled a huge variety of strokes {{towards the end of the}} innings, without once breaking the momentum he had set. He also left the balls that were way outside the off-stump and his defense grew progressively secure and certain. He handled the short ball extremely well too, slapping them away, or ducking safely. There was superb timing and placement written all over his trademark off-side shots. In fact, Ganguly's innings provoked humorous comments from the fans who suggested that his superb strokes were a result of him dining at the Taj Mahal restaurant, whose owner was a spectator.|$|E
2500|$|India {{started the}} fourth room facing a {{daunting}} situation. Dravid and Ganguly gave India a quiet start, adding only 11 {{runs in the}} first five overs, but in the third ball of the fifteenth over, Ganguly received a blow {{on the back of the}} head from Brad Williams, and had to retire. At this point, Sachin Tendulkar came in, and along with Rahul Dravid, rescued India from doldrums. India were 109/2 at lunch, as the two batsmen applied themselves on a wearing pitch with uneven bounce. After lunch, Tendulkar began confidently, playing some good shots off Brett Lee and Brad Williams, before getting out to Williams, attempting to play a wide delivery from him. He had, by then, made his highest score in the series, 44, and a poor year personally in terms of form for him, ended. His knock was described as being [...] "diligent in protecting(his)wicket and resisting temptation". Then the score was 126/3. From that point onwards, Australia executed their tactics well enough and did not employ over-attacking fields for VVS Laxman, the next batsman, knowing that he could score his runs freely anyhow. Laxman, in spite of being untroubled during his brief stay in the crease, got out to Stuart MacGill, getting drawn into edging a leg-break to slips. The score was 160/4 and India were still trailing by 32 runs. Ganguly came in after Laxman's dismissal, while Dravid was unbeaten at the other end on 53. The Dravid-Ganguly partnership resumed quietly, starting with a succession of three maiden overs within five overs. Ganguly, in particular, continued with his defensive style of play till tea. Just after the break, Australia played Simon Katich an Stuart MacGill, and the runs continue to flow freely. The second new ball was [...] taken after eighty overs, and by then Ganguly's strokeplay had become bolder. He reached his half-century against Brett Lee's bowling with a drive to mid-off. He reached his fifty from 106 balls with eight fours. After securing applause for his fifty, he sent the next ball racing past point for four. Against Brad Williams in the next over, Ganguly swung high over square leg for four against a <b>short</b> <b>delivery,</b> like the one which had hit him on the back of his head. Lee came steaming in the next over as well, but again, he was dispatched for four off successive balls. It was [...] "stirring stuff, not without an element of risk in it." ...|$|E

2500|$|At Sydney, Terry Jenner retired {{hurt when}} he ducked into a <b>short</b> <b>delivery</b> from Snow {{in the first}} innings. Umpire Lou Rowan warned the fast bowler for intimidatory bowling yet again, but Snow and Illingworth objected strongly, the captain saying [...] "That's the only bouncer he's bowled" [...] {{and that he would}} {{complain}} to the A.C.B. Rowan later claimed that Illingworth and Snow swore at him, which they denied. The bowler was loudly booed and [...] "when he returned to his fielding position at long-leg Snow was pelted with bottles, cans and eaten pies". Some of the crowd wanted to shake his hand, but then he was grabbed by a drunk [...] at Paddington Hill who was forced to let go by other spectators. In 1998 the eighty-year-old Trevor Guy told the Sydney Morning Herald that he was the man who had grabbed Snow in order to tell him what he thought about him hitting Jenner. Guy and Snow, in Australia for the 1998–99 Ashes series agreed that they had no hard feelings. To avoid injury to his team, Illingworth took his men back to the dressing room without the permission of the umpires, an unprecedented move in Test cricket. The England manager Clark tried to push Illingworth back onto the field and Alan Barnes of the A.C.B. demanded that they return immediately or they would forfeit the match and the Ashes. A furious Illingworth said he would not return until the playing area had been cleared and the crowd had calmed down. Furthermore, he strongly objected to Clark constantly siding with the Australians against his own team. It took seven minutes for the groundstaff to move the debris, during which one was hit on the head with a beer-can and had to be taken to hospital. Jenner returned to bat at 235–8 and made a brave 30, last man out on 264 to give Australia a lead of 80 runs. England made 302 in their second innings and set Australia 223 to win. Snow took a wicket in his first over, but smashed his finger on the wooden boundary fence trying to catch a six off Keith Stackpole. He was taken to hospital for an operation under general anaesthetic to reconstruct his shattered finger bones. England's spinners did the job, dismissing Australia for 160 to win by 62 runs and regain The Ashes while Snow was on the operating table. He recovered in time to join in [...] "the champagne-filled, beer-laden, hangover-inducing rejoicings of Sydney". Snow's 31 wickets (22.83) was the most by an England bowler in Australia since Harold Larwood's 33 wickets (19.51) in 1932–33. No England bowler after Snow has taken 25 wickets in a Test series in Australia.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Regarding {{disruptive}} innovation, Christensen and Raynor (2003) {{assume that}} {{there are two types of}} customers: overshot customers in existing markets and entirely new nonconsumers in other markets. In the case of large-scale casting market within the casting industry, customers demand high quality casting surfaces. The new method of casting termed full mold casting (FMC) could only achieve low quality results compared with existing wooden pattern-based sand mold casting, which had sufficiently high quality in its casting surfaces. Even in that market, however, the casting of metallic molds for automobiles had particular requirements because casting surfaces were later dealt by mold companies. Thus, customers welcomed <b>shorter</b> <b>delivery</b> times even with lower quality casting surfaces. Kimura Chuzosho Co., Ltd. first acquired certain customers who desired <b>shorter</b> <b>delivery</b> times, and then improved casting surface quality and productivity over the course of doing business with them. Eventually, they became successful in capturing more than half the market for automobile metallic mold castings. Improving the quality of casting surfaces led to market share gains for one-of...|$|R
