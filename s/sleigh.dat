5|$|Stealing a Ride follows two children, Susie Gay and Johnnie Eddy, {{who are out}} tobogganing on sleds. The two see Susie's parents {{going out}} for a drive in a <b>sleigh</b> and ask to come along. The parents refuse and {{secretly}} two hitch their sleds behind the <b>sleigh.</b> When going up a hill, Susie loses her grip on her sled and Johnnie tries to save her from falling in vain. The two fall off and are unable to catch up the <b>sleigh.</b> The children wander into the woods and become lost. When Susie's parents discover the empty sleds they turn back and track down the children by the footprints they left in the snow {{with the aid of a}} dog. The parents find them asleep in the snow and bring them back home in the <b>sleigh.</b> The children are punished by spanking and then kissed by their parents for their actions.|$|E
5|$|NORAD's {{tracking}} of Santa's <b>sleigh</b> on Christmas Eve, for example, was initiated in 1955 {{and has become}} an annual tradition. The stop motion animated film, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer remains an annual telecast on American televisionalmost fifty years after its debut, and Dr. Seuss's How the Grinch Stole Christmas! of 1957 has become a literary Christmas classic.|$|E

5|$|Beecham {{conducted}} the RPO {{in his last}} concert, given at Portsmouth Guildhall on 7 May 1960. The programme, all characteristic choices, comprised the Magic Flute Overture, Haydn's Military Symphony, Beecham's own Handel arrangement Love in Bath, Schubert's Fifth Symphony, On the River by Delius, and the Bacchanale from Saint-Saëns's Samson and Delilah, with Delius's <b>Sleigh</b> Ride as an encore. Beecham {{suffered a heart attack}} the following month, from which he did not recover; he died in March 1961.|$|E
5|$|Glittery {{bands of}} mica {{decorated}} some balls {{while others were}} silk screened with seasonal motifs such as snowy scenes, <b>sleigh</b> rides, carolers, and poinsettias. Some balls featured silvery indents on their surfaces that reflected the surrounding light. In the early 1950s, clear glass balls appeared decorated with bands of color or glittering sparkles. Molded plastic Santa Clauses, angels, snowmen, and other holiday icons were inexpensive, mass-produced, and readily available.|$|E

Harrison also contributed on organ, clavinet and percussion, the last of which included tubular bells (or chimes), <b>sleigh</b> bells and zither.|$|E
5|$|In 1884 {{a team of}} New Zealanders, {{organised}} by the Canterbury {{player and}} administrator William Millton, and Dunedin businessman Samuel <b>Sleigh,</b> was selected to tour New South Wales. This is now officially regarded as the first New Zealand representative rugby side. Warbrick was included in a squad that was selected from throughout the country; the entire endeavour was performed without the oversight of a national body – several provincial rugby unions existed, but the New Zealand Rugby Football Union was not formed until 1892. The squad's 19 players were expected to assemble in Wellington before disembarking for Sydney on 21 May, however Warbrick missed his ship from Auckland and so travelled to Sydney alone. Millton was elected captain, and <b>Sleigh</b> managed the team. The side won all eight of their matches on tour, including the three games against New South Wales. Warbrick appeared in seven matches and scored three drop goals; {{one of the goals}} was reportedly kicked from well inside his own half. He played at both fullback and three-quarter, and was noted for his good ball handling and speed, as well as his ability to drop kick.|$|E
5|$|Prompt Payment and Stealing a Ride are two 1911 American silent short comedy films {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Prompt Payment focuses on a lawyer who evades his creditors, dons a disguise and plays against them {{in a game of}} poker. After winning a large sum of money from them, he excuses himself and returns to pay them with their own money. Stealing a Ride is listed as a comedy, but has a clear dramatic element. Susie and Johnnie are out sledding when Susie's parents are about to go out for a <b>sleigh</b> drive. The children ask to come along, but are refused. The children hitch their sleds {{to the back of the}} <b>sleigh</b> and follow along, only to fall off and get lost in the woods. The parents later track them down and bring them home. Both films were released together on a single reel on January 27, 1911 and were met with praise by critics. Both films are presumed lost.|$|E

Pleasure vehicles, funeral wagons, <b>sleighs,</b> carts, and more are on display in the renovated 19th century warehouse. Housed in a renovated warehouse opposite the steam train depot in Frostburg, this museum houses an extensive collection of late-19th- and early-20th-century horse-drawn carriages, featuring more than 50 vehicles from the collection of the late James R. Thrasher.

She meets an ice harvester named Kristoff, and his reindeer, Sven, convincing them {{to escort}} her to the mountains. An attack by wolves leads to Kristoff’s <b>sleigh</b> being destroyed. On foot, they meet Olaf, a cheerful snowman brought to life unknowingly by Elsa, who offers to lead them to her. When Anna’s horse returns to Arendelle, Hans sets out to find Anna and Elsa, accompanied by the Duke's minions, who have secret orders to capture Elsa.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{elimination}} of the United States ice hockey team, American television stations needed to fill airtime and chose to focus on the Jamaican bobsleigh team in the four-man event. The first run ended poorly, as when Dudley Stokes jumped into the bobsleigh, the push-bar in the <b>sleigh</b> broke, resulting in the team coming in third from last in 24th place. On their second attempt, the team ranked second to last, due in part to White struggling to crouch down properly in his seat, remaining almost upright through the first corner.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} melody in {{this movement}} (E) {{is taken from}} an old Hussar song, for which Prokofiev provided an optional baritone part. The melody first appears in a slow and somewhat dissonant statement, after which the pace quickens: <b>sleigh</b> bells, rapid pizzicato strings, and piano combine {{to give the impression}} of a fast winter's journey by means of the troika, a traditional Russian three-horse sled. The ride is accompanied at regular intervals by the song theme, which brings the movement to its close with a slow repetition of its final phrase.|$|E

5|$|Webster went {{on trial}} at the Central Criminal Court– the Old Bailey– on 2 July 1879. In {{a sign of}} the great public {{interest}} aroused by the case, the prosecution was led by the Solicitor General, Sir Hardinge Giffard. Webster was defended by a prominent London barrister, Warner <b>Sleigh,</b> and the case was presided over by Mr. Justice Denman. The trial was just as well-attended as the earlier hearings in Richmond and attracted intense interest from all levels of society; on the fourth day of the trial, the Crown Prince of Sweden– the future King Gustaf V– turned up to watch the proceedings.|$|E
5|$|A soundtrack album, Soma Bringer Original Soundtrack, was {{released}} through the <b>Sleigh</b> Bells label on April 2, 2008. The soundtrack covers three discs. In addition to tracks used in-game, the album includes four tracks with full orchestral versions of particular tracks. Ben Schweitzer, writing for RPGFan, positively compared the score to earlier works by Mitsuda, calling it his best recent soundtrack despite some tracks being overly similar to earlier work. Don Kotowski of Video Game Music Online gave the soundtrack album a perfect score of 5/5 stars. He frequently praised Mitsuda's style, and like Schweitzer {{noted that it}} often recalled his earlier work. He also praised the additional tracks for their richness and depth, finishing his review by {{saying that it was}} a soundtrack not to be missed by buyers of video game music.|$|E
5|$|Bond veteran {{cameraman}} {{and professional}} skier Willy Bogner, Jr. {{was promoted to}} director of a second unit involving ski footage. Bogner designed the ski chase on the bobsleigh track of Cortina d'Ampezzo hoping to surpass his work in both On Her Majesty's Secret Service and The Spy Who Loved Me. To allow better filming, Bogner developed both a system where he was attached to a bobsleigh, allowing to film the vehicle or behind it, {{and a set of}} skis that allowed him to ski forwards and backwards to get the best shots. In February 1981, {{on the final day of}} filming the bobsleigh chase, one of the stuntmen driving a <b>sleigh,</b> 23-year-old Paolo Rigon, was killed when he became trapped under the bob.|$|E

5|$|By 1678, Frederick William {{had cleared}} Swedish Pomerania and {{occupied}} most of it, {{with the exception}} of Rügen which was held by Denmark–Norway. This was followed by another success against Sweden, when Frederick William cleared Prussia of Swedish forces in {{what became known as the}} Great <b>Sleigh</b> Drive. However, when Louis XIV of France concluded the Dutch War by the Nijmegen treaties, he marched his armies east to relieve his Swedish ally, and forced Frederick William to basically return to the status quo ante bellum by the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1679). Though the Scanian War resulted only in minor territorial gains, attaching a small strip of the Swedish Pomeranian right bank of the lower Oder to Brandenburg-Prussian Pomerania, the war resulted in a huge gain of prestige for the elector.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{job title}} as a composer, Mitsuda {{worked as a}} sound effects {{designer}} for two years. In 1994, after threatening to quit to Square's vice president, Hironobu Sakaguchi, {{he was assigned to}} compose the soundtrack to Chrono Trigger. After the game's success and the music's acclaim, he went on to compose several other games for Square, including Xenogears. In 1998, Mitsuda left Square to work as a freelance composer, founding his own music production studio in 2001, Procyon Studio, as well as his own record label, <b>Sleigh</b> Bells. Although Mitsuda continues to compose for video games, he began to produce music in other forms of media beginning in the 2010s, including various anime series, films, and television specials, as well as his own independent albums.|$|E
