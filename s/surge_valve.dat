With more and more cars equipped with turbocharged engines good turbo MVEM models are needed. A turbocharger consists of two major parts: turbine and compressor. Whereas the turbine is relatively durable, there exist phenomenons on the compressor that can destroy the turbocharger. One of these is surge. Several compressor models are developed in this thesis. Methods to determine the compressor model parameters are proposed and discussed both for the stable operating range {{as well as for}} the surge region of a compressor map. For the stationary region methods to automatically parameterize the compressor model are developed.

A general mathematical analysis of the conventional three-arc cam is presented, introducing the terms “eccentricity ” and “instantaneous radius”, and this is followed by a similar analysis of the new cam profile using the ‘same terms, together with the method of correcting the cam profile for high-speed operation. It is also shown how the new general equations can be used to deduce a variable eccentricity ramp, the purpose of which is to take up clearance at variable velocity.

50|$|Hydraulic surges {{are created}} when the {{velocity}} of a fluid suddenly changes and becomes unsteady or transient.

When the product on the inlet of the valve exceeds the set point it forces the valve to open and allows the excess surge to be bled out in to a breakout tank or recirculated into a different pipeline. So in the event of the surge, the majority of the pressure is absorbed in the liquid and pipe, and just that quantity of liquid which is necessary to relieve pressures of unsafe proportions is discharged to the surge relief tank. Some valve manufactures use the piston style with a nitrogen control system and external plenums, while others use elastomeric tubes, external pilots, or internal chambers.|$|R

50|$|Piston-style gas-loaded <b>surge</b> relief <b>valves</b> {{operate on}} the {{balanced}} piston design {{and can be used}} in a variety of applications because it can handle high and low viscosity products while maintaining a fast speed of response. An inert gas, most commonly nitrogen, is loaded on the back side of the piston forcing the valve closed. The nitrogen pressure on the back side of the piston is actually what determines the valves set point. These valves will remain closed until the inlet pressure exceeds the set point/nitrogen pressure, at which time the valve will open from the high pressure and remain open as long as the process pressure is above the nitrogen pressure. Once the process pressure starts to decay, the valve will start to close. Once the process pressure is below the nitrogen pressure, the valve will go closed again.|$|R

In this paper we provide a method to reduce the bandwidth and rate requirements for control of rotating stall by combining an axisymmetric bleed valve with continuous air injection.

40|$|Abstract-In a {{piped water}} {{distribution}} system, {{one of the}} hazards in water mains is frequent damage including rupture of the pipe line. The major cause of water hammer is rapid generation of surge pressure mainly due to sudden closure of valve. The occurrence of water hammer is however depends in various flow conditions and characteristics. In a steady state, the pipe flow may be laminar or turbulent. The factors such as pressure, viscosity, frictional stress plays a vital role for occurrence of water hammer. On the other hand, the pipe characteristics namely, material, thickness, length and diameters are all important in this connection. The gradual or rapid closure of valve is also considerable in water hammer study. A one-dimensional propagation of water surge in a pipe material has been studied theoretically with a simple conservation of energy model. The numerical solution for different times of valve closing, pipe materials, lengths, diameter has been worked out. It has been observed that the surge pressure depends intensely with time, pipe material and diameter; however, not much dependent on length. In the present study, the water hammer surge for an elastic pipe is worked out. Under similar conditions, a difference in surge pressure transmission is observed than a rigid pipe. The paper also discusses the surge pressure leading to rapid opening of valve leading to water hammer <b>surge</b> for <b>valve</b> closure. The paper proposes a protection scheme to curb the water hammer in a piped distribution system for uninterrupted supply of water.

The RCS is a subsystem of the Integrated Cryogenic Propulsion Test Article (ICPTA) and was initially developed under Project Morpheus. Composed of two 28 lbf-thrust and two 7 lbf-thrust engines, the RCS is fed {{in parallel with}} the ICPTA main engine from four propellant tanks. 40 tests consisting of 1, 010 individual thruster pulses were performed across 6 different test days.

Peak <b>surge</b> pressures from <b>valve</b> opening and closing events were examined. It was determined that these events were impacted significantly by vapor cavity formation and collapse. In most cases the valve opening transient was more severe than the valve closing. Under thermal vacuum conditions it was shown that TVS operation is unnecessary to maintain liquid conditions at the thruster inlets. However, under higher heat leak environments the RCS can still be operated in a self-conditioning mode without overboard TVS venting, contingent upon the engines managing a range of potentially severe thermal transients.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{compressor}} surge imposes a significant limit on the flow range of a turbocharged internal combustion engine. The centrifugal compressor is commonly placed upstream of the inlet manifold and hence, it is exposed to the intermittent flow regime of the inlet <b>valves.</b> <b>Surge</b> phenomena has been well studied over the past decades, there still remains limited information with regards to the unsteady impact caused by the inlet valves. This study presents an experimental evaluation of such a situation. Engine representative pulses are created by a downstream system comprising a large volume, two rotating valves, a throttle valve and the corresponding pipe network. Different pulsation levels are characterized by means of their frequency and the corresponding amplitude at the compressor inlet. The stability limit of the system under study is evaluated with reference to the parameter B proposed by Greitzer [7 - 9]. B describes the dynamics of the compression system in terms of volume, area, equivalent length and compressor tip speed as well as the Helmholtz frequency of the system. For a given compressor, as B goes beyond a critical value, the system will exhibit surge {{as the result of the}} flow instability progression. The reduced frequency analysis shows that the scroll-diffuser operates in an unsteady regime, while the impeller is nearly quasi-steady. In the vicinity of the surge point, under a pulsating flow, the instantaneous operation of the compressor showed significant excursions into the unstable side of the surge line. Furthermore, it has been found that the presence of a volume in the system has the greatest effect on the surge margin of the compressor under the unsteady conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract]: For most piping systems {{the maximum}} and minimum {{operating}} pressure occur during transient operations. Transient operations {{may result in}} column separation which refers to the breaking of liquid columns in fully filled pipelines. This may occur in a water hammer event when the pressure in a pipeline drops to the vapour pressure at specific locations such as closed ends, high points or knees (changes in pipe slope). The liquid columns are separated by a vapour cavity that grows and diminishes according to {{the dynamics of the}} system. The collision of two liquid columns, or of one liquid column with a closed end, may cause a large and nearly instantaneous rise in pressure. This pressure rise travels through the entire pipeline and forms a severe load on hydraulic machinery, individual pipes and supporting structures. The situation is even worse {{due to the fact that}} one water hammer event may cause many repetitions of cavity formation and subsequent cavity collapse. The magnitude of this pressure amplitude may result in high fatigue loading on the pipe and cause the pipe to fail over time due to fatigue. It is therefore essential for a good design to perform a transient analysis for normal start-up and shutdown and for unplanned events such as a pump trip associated with a power outage. The analysis of hyraulic transients has historically been a difficult and time consuming undertaking. It developed through various stages from the early 1900 's from a graphical method to today's fully interactive computer based software that can model the transients in real time. This paper reviews water hammer with column separation from the development of mathematical models of the phenomenon in the early 20 th century to the current numerical solutions techniques used in modern software such as the Method of Characteristics and Wave Characteristic Methods. A list and discussion on a wide range of transient mitigation methods and strategices are presented and reviewed. This list ranges from direct actions and devices such as <b>surge</b> anticipating control <b>valves</b> to indirect and passive mitigating techniques such sequencing of pump start ups. The paper aims to present a structured procedure whereby a pipeline can be analysed and married with an appropriate transient mitigating strategy...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} {{compressor}} instabilities in gas turbine engines has received much attention in recent ears. In particular, rotating stall and surge are major causes of problems ranging from component stress and lifespan reduction to engine explosion. In this thesis, modeling {{and control of}} rotating stall and <b>surge</b> using bleed <b>valve</b> and air injection is studied and validated on a low speed, single stage, axial compressor at Caltech. Bleed valve control of stall is achieved only when the compressor characteristic is actuated, due to the fast growth rate of the stall cell compared to the rate limit of the valve. Furthermore, experimental {{results show that the}} actuator rate requirement for stall control is reduced by a factor of fourteen via compressor characteristic actuation. Analytical expressions based on low order models (2 - 3 states) and a high fidelity simulation (37 states) tool are developed to estimate the minimum rate requirement of a bleed valve for control of stall. A comparison of the tools to experiments show a good qualitative agreement, with increasing quantitative accuracy as the complexity of the underlying model increases. Air injection control of stall and surge is also investigated. Simultaneous control of stall and surge is achieved using axisymmetric air injection. Three cases with different injector back pressure are studied. Surge control via binary air injection is achieved in all three cases. Simultaneous stall and surge control is achieved for two of the cases, but is not achieved for the lowest authority case. This is consistent with previous results for control of stall with axisymmetric air injection without a plenum attached. Non—axisymmetric air injection control of stall and surge is also studied. Three existing control algorithms found in literature are modeled and analyzed. A three—state model is obtained for each algorithm. For two cases, conditions for linear stability and bifurcation criticality on control of rotating stall are derived and expressed in terms of implementation—oriented variables such as number of injectors. For the third case, bifurcation criticality conditions are not obtained due to complexity, though linear stability property is derived. A theoretical comparison between the three algorithms is made, via the use of low—order models, to investigate pros and cons of the algorithms in the context of operability. The effects of static distortion on the compressor facility at Caltech is characterized experimentally. Results consistent with literature are obtained. Simulations via a high fidelity model (34 states) are also performed and show good qualitative as well as quantitative agreement to experiments.

40|$|Hydropower {{represented}} in 1999 19 % {{of the world}} electricity production and the absolute production {{is expected to grow}} considerably during the next 30 years. Francis turbines {{play a major role in}} the hydroelectric production due to their extended range of application. Due to the deregulated energy market, hydroelectric power plants are increasingly subjecting to off design operation, start-up and shutdown and new control strategies. Consequently, the operation of Francis turbine power plants leads to transients phenomena, risk of resonance or instabilities. The understanding of these propagation phenomena is therefore paramount. This work is a contribution to the hydroacoustic modelling of Francis turbine power plants for the investigation of the aforementioned problematic. The first part of the document presents the modelling of the dynamic behavior and the transient analysis of hydroelectric power plants. Therefore, the one-dimensional model of an elementary pipe is derived from the governing equations, i. e. momentum and continuity equations. The use of appropriate numerical schemes leads to a discrete model of the pipe consisting of a T-shaped equivalent electrical circuit. The accuracy in the frequency domain of the discrete model of the pipe is determined by comparison with the analytical solution of the governing equations. The modelling approach is extended to hydraulic components such as <b>valve,</b> <b>surge</b> tanks, surge shaft, air vessels, cavitation development, etc. Then, the modelling of the Francis, Pelton and Kaplan turbines for transient analysis purposes is presented. This modelling is based on the use of the static characteristic of the turbines. The hydraulic components models are implemented in the EPFL software SIMSEN developed for the simulation of electrical installations. After validation of the hydraulic models, transient phenomena in hydroelectric power plants are investigated. It appears that standard separate studies of either the hydraulic or of the electrical part are valid only for design purposes, while full hydroelectric models are necessary for the optimization of turbine speed governors. The second part of the document deals with the modelling and analysis of possible resonance or operating instabilities in Francis turbine power plants. The review of the excitation sources inherent to Francis turbine operations indicates that the draft tube and the rotor-stator interaction pressure fluctuations are of the major concern. As the modelling of part load pressure fluctuations induced by the cavitating vortex rope that develops in the draft tube at low frequencies is well established, the focus is put on higher frequency phenomena such as higher part load pressure fluctuations and rotorstator interactions or full load instabilities. Three hydroacoustic investigations are performed. (i) Pressure fluctuations identified experimentally at higher part load on a reduced scale model Francis turbine are investigated by means of hydroacoustic simulations and high speed flow visualizations. The resonance of the test rig due to the vortex rope excitation is pointed out by the simulation while the special motion and shape of the cavitating vortex rope at the resonance frequency is highlighted by the visualization. A description of the possible excitation mechanisms is proposed. (ii) A pressure and power surge measured on a 4 × 400 MW pumped-storage plant operating at full load is investigated. The modelling of the entire system, including the hydraulic circuit, the rotating inertias and the electrical installation provides an explanation of the phenomenon and the related conditions of apparition. A non-linear model of the full load vortex rope is established and qualitatively validated. (iii) The rotor-stator interactions (RSI) are studied in the case of a reduced scale pump-turbine model. An original modelling approach of this phenomenon based on the flow distribution between the stationnary and the rotating part is presented. The model provides the RSI pressure fluctuation patterns in the vaneless gap and enables to predict standing waves in the spiral case and adduction pipe. The proposed one-dimensional modelling approach enables the simulation, analysis and optimization of the dynamic behavior of hydroelectric power plants. The approach has proven its capability of simulating properly both transient and periodic phenomena. Such investigations can be undertaken at early stages of a project to assess the possible dynamic problems and to select appropriate solutions ensuring the safest and optimal operation of the facility...|$|R
