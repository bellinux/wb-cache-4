5|$|I was <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{theater at}} the back, showing {{it to people}} for the first time. I mean, {{it was like a}} puddle of sweat around my feet. It was like, 'Oh my God, oh my God, I hope I did the right thing. Oh, that scene is too long. Oh, that's too short. Are they going to get this part? Are they going to like this? Oh, they're going to think it's boring!' Just {{worrying}} the whole way, biting my fingernails off.|$|E
5|$|It was {{possible}} {{to look into the}} back yard from the road...the corpses in British uniform were lying in the yard near the buildings. They were lying in such a position that one can assume they were killed by machine-gun bursts. It struck me at once that the dead soldiers were not wearing helmets, nor did they have any equipment on them...I took pictures of the dead bodies, and the whole farm. At Thum's request these were to be placed at the disposal of the division...I believe I was already <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vehicle when Thum...told me that in the field which he had returned the equipment...the shot British soldiers were lying in a heap, from which he had {{come to the conclusion that}} a summary trial had taken place.|$|E
500|$|... "Eat, Pray, Queef" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-founder Trey Parker. It first aired on April 1, 2009 in the United States on Comedy Central. Although Parker and fellow co-creator Matt Stone acknowledged it was a particularly juvenile episode, Parker said it was his favorite show of the season to produce. He said, [...] "I seriously never laughed as hard doing retakes, just going shot-by-shot, <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> editing room laughing." [...] During the writing process, the female producers and employees with the show found the script largely unfunny, disgusting and offensive. They reportedly claimed vaginal flatulence would not bloom into a proud women's movement {{as it did in the}} episode, but Parker and Stone insisted that was what made the concept even funnier.|$|E
6000|$|Some one {{is always}} <b>sitting</b> <b>there,</b> [...] <b>In</b> <b>the</b> little green orchard; [...] Even {{when the sun}} is high [...] In noon's unclouded sky, [...] And faintly droning goes [...] The bee from rose to rose, [...] Some one <b>in</b> shadow is <b>sitting</b> <b>there,</b> [...] <b>In</b> <b>the</b> little green orchard.|$|R
6000|$|Quite by chance, Dschemil {{happened}} to pass by, and seeing a man <b>sitting</b> <b>there,</b> full <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{glare of the}} sun, he stopped, and said, 'Get up at once, Jew; {{you will have a}} sunstroke if you sit in such a place.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Sam," [...] she gasped, [...] "old Jerome Irving and Aunt Anne are <b>sitting</b> round <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark on {{the front}} porch and he had his arms around her, kissing her! And they never saw nor heard me, no more'n if they were deaf and blind!" ...|$|R
500|$|Pierre Sévigny, {{who would}} be elected an MP in 1958, {{recalled}} the gathering, [...] "When he had finished that speech, as he was walking to the door, I saw people kneel and kiss his coat. Not one, but many. People were in tears. People were delirious. And this happened many a time after." [...] When Sévigny introduced Diefenbaker to a Montreal rally with the words [...] "Levez-vous, levez-vous, saluez votre chef!" [...] (Rise, rise, salute your chief!) according to Postmaster General William Hamilton [...] "thousands and thousands of people, jammed into that auditorium, just tore the roof off in a frenzy." [...] Michael Starr remembered, [...] "That was the most fantastic election... I went into little places. Smoky Lake, Alberta, where nobody ever saw a minister. Canora, Saskatchewan. Every meeting was jammed... The halls would be filled with people and <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> front {{would be the first}} Ukrainian immigrants with shawls and hands gnarled from work... I would switch to Ukrainian and the tears would start to run down their faces... I don't care who says what won the election; it was the emotional aspect that really caught on." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 'When {{the kid is}} <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> base, I didn't do it, {{but nobody}} is {{thinking}} {{of him as a}} kid, you know—if there is someone blindfolded and handcuffed, he's probably done something really bad. It's OK to slap him, it's OK to spit on him, it's OK to kick him sometimes. It doesn't really matter.' ...|$|E
60|$|They {{all heard}} it. Sammy Jay heard it, too, and {{scratched}} {{himself to be}} sure that he was awake and <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> big pine-tree.|$|E
60|$|He {{loved to}} light the candles at the organ, and <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> alone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> little glow, {{practice}} the hymns and chants for the service. The whitewashed arches retreated into darkness, {{the sound of the}} organ and the organ-pedals died away upon the unalterable stillness of the church, there were faint, ghostly noises <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tower, and then the music swelled out again, loudly, triumphantly.|$|R
60|$|After a {{long time}} the water boiled, and we drank our hot tea and ate our {{sardines}} and bread and bits of remaining Nuoro sausage, <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> alone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intense starry darkness of that upper deck. I said alone: but no, two ghoulish ship's cats came howling at us for the bits. And even when everything was eaten, and <b>the</b> sardine-tin thrown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sea, still they circled and prowled and howled.|$|R
5000|$|... "Tweeter and the Monkey Man" [...] {{was really}} by Tom Petty and Bob Dylan. Well, Jeff [...] and I were there too, {{but we were}} just <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> around <b>in</b> <b>the</b> kitchen, and he was for some reason talking about all this stuff that didn't make much sense to me, you know, it was that Americana kinda stuff {{and we got a}} tape {{cassette}} and put it on and then transcribed everything they were saying.|$|R
60|$|So Parson Jones, <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{slanting}} light, {{read through}} these terrible records of piracy, and Tom, with {{the pile of}} gold and silver money beside him, sat and listened to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} to tell me, Thady, you believe all that d----d {{nonsense}} about knowing nothing about it; and he <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cabin, and the malt hadn't been in it half an hour?" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{is uncomfortable}} {{to sleep in}} a chair. But it is more uncomfortable to lie in bed, hour after hour, and not sleep, and to know that he is <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cold darkness.|$|E
6000|$|... “Yes,” said Mrs Verloc, <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> {{against him}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hansom all rigid with the dread of the gallows {{and the fear}} of death. “Yes, Tom.” And she added to herself, like an awful refrain: “The drop given was {{fourteen}} feet.” ...|$|R
60|$|But {{about this}} silent {{creature}} <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> so motionless, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark, <b>there</b> seemed a warmth, a hidden fervour of feeling, {{as if the}} whole of her being had been stirred, and some change were taking place in its very depths.|$|R
60|$|We {{went away}} {{out into the}} open where some stones gleamed white <b>in</b> <b>the</b> moonlight, and <b>there,</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sand, our backs against a rest, and with all quiet about us, we settled down for a long conference.|$|R
60|$|So {{there he}} sat, {{and when the}} people of the town awoke they beheld <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midst of that market-place one all naked and famished who gazed about him with wild and terrified looks like to a {{starving}} wolf who had come out of the forest driven by hunger.|$|E
6000|$|... "People {{who say it}} isn't a {{beautiful}} world don't {{know what they are}} talking about. Driving here in the car today to award the kind prizes, I was reluctantly compelled to tick off my host on this very point. Old Tom Travers. You will see him <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second row next to the large lady in beige." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not? It's {{all very}} simple. We're creatures of our surroundings, aren't we? Now, <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark to-night, {{it seemed to}} me that the people we think of as dead were all about me. It scared me at first; but, really, isn't it the most comforting faith in the world? I've always liked the idea of the Indian's happy 'hunting-grounds'--and this is {{something}} like it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Just {{as though}} Stalin had been <b>sitting</b> right <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hall, Yagoda {{confidently}} and insistently begged him directly for mercy: [...] "I appeal to you! For you I built two great canals!" [...] And a witness reports that at just that moment a match flared <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shadows behind {{a window on}} the second floor of the hall, apparently behind a muslin curtain, and, while it lasted, the outline of a pipe could be seen.|$|R
5000|$|Yagoda {{was found}} guilty of treason and {{conspiracy}} against the Soviet government at the Trial of <b>the</b> Twenty-One <b>in</b> March 1938. He denied to be a spy, but admitted most other charges. Solzhenitsyn describes Yagoda as expecting clemency from Stalin after the show trial: [...] "Just as though Stalin had been <b>sitting</b> right <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hall, Yagoda confidently and insistently begged him directly for mercy: [...] "I appeal to you! For you I built two great canals!" [...]|$|R
60|$|He lighted his {{cigarette}}. After all, Irene had {{not made}} a scene! She would come round--that {{was the best of}} her; she was cold, but not sulky. And, puffing the cigarette smoke at a lady-bird on the shining table, he plunged into a reverie about the house. It was no good worrying; he would go and make it up presently. She would be <b>sitting</b> out <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark, under the Japanese sunshade, knitting. A beautiful, warm night....|$|R
60|$|His {{face was}} dark and hollow, he seemed frail, <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> London {{afternoon}} darning the black woollen socks. His full brow was knitted slightly, there was a tension. At the same time, there was an indomitable stillness about him, as it were in the atmosphere about him. His hands, though small, were not very thin. He bit off the wool as he finished his darn.|$|E
60|$|The resting meant <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark on {{the side}} of the sleigh, and the feeding {{consisted}} in devouring a lump of seal's flesh raw. Although not very palatable, this was eminently profitable food, as Angut well knew. As for Rooney, he had learned by that time to eat whatever came in his way with thankfulness--when hungry, and not to eat at all when otherwise.|$|E
6000|$|... '"Yes," [...] I answered; [...] "I am Naass, head man of Akatan, {{the last}} of the blood, as you are {{the last of}} the blood." [...] 'And she laughed. By all the things I have seen and the deeds I have done may I never hear such a laugh again. It put the chill to my soul, <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> White Silence, alone with death and this woman who laughed.|$|E
60|$|Then I tossed him peanuts, {{throwing}} them first far away, then nearer and nearer till {{he would come}} to my window-sill. And when I woke one morning he was <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> looking <b>in</b> at <b>the</b> window, waiting for me to get up and bring his breakfast.|$|R
5000|$|He {{also spoke}} {{about how the}} album cover was {{inspired}} by Nas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film Belly, saying: [...] "Well, I’ve always like that picture. I felt like that picture describes my title: dreaming, zoning, and achieving, like, I’m doing all three in that picture. That image with Nas <b>sitting</b> <b>there,</b> back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> day just was so much for me. I just felt like flipping that into a cover would be the right thing to. Plus it was painted. Shout out to BK." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{first she}} was very indignant, oh, very indignant, indeed! She decided that Mr. Rabbit should be punished very severely. But as she watched him <b>sitting</b> <b>there,</b> dreaming <b>in</b> <b>the</b> warm sunshine, her anger began to melt away. The fact is, Old Mother Nature was {{like all the rest}} of Mr. Rabbit's neighbors--she just couldn't help loving happy-go-lucky Mr. Rabbit in spite of all his faults. With a long stick she reached <b>in</b> and tickled <b>the</b> end of his nose.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{was a kind}} {{of silence}} and more jabbering, and in he came, Bible in hand, after the manner of them--a little sandy chap in specks and a pith helmet. I flatter myself that me <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shadows, with my copper head and my big goggles, struck him a bit of a heap at first. 'Well,' I says, 'how's the trade in scissors?' for I don't hold with missionaries.|$|E
60|$|I turned {{towards the}} shape by the fire, and without her perceiving it, wafted kiss and prayer in her direction. Cold, {{careless}} Fanny--further than Uranus. We were alone, for at first stroke of St Peter's Mrs Bowater {{had left the}} room and had opened the front door. She was smiling; but was she smiling, or was that vague bewitchingness in her face merely an unmeaning guile of which she was unaware? It {{might have been a}} mermaid <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> firelight.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{faces of}} {{hundreds}} of English authors, I achieved a peaceful satisfaction with my outfit. A sense of being entirely inconspicuous, a realization that I was committed to convention, produced in me an air of perfect ease. By conforming I had become {{as much a part}} of the scene as Sir Walter or the waiter who shifted my plates and filled my glass. [...] "Zangwill is right," [...] I said, [...] "the clawhammer coat is in truth the most democratic of garments." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I started {{thinking}} as I was coming over here, {{why is it}} that Joe Biden is <b>the</b> first <b>in</b> his family ever to go to a university? [...] Why is it that my wife who is <b>sitting</b> out <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> audience is <b>the</b> first <b>in</b> her family to ever go to college? Is it because our fathers and mothers were not bright? Is it because I'm <b>the</b> first Biden <b>in</b> a thousand generations to get a college and a graduate degree that I was smarter than the rest?" ...|$|R
60|$|Little Alf Bergan popped <b>in</b> round <b>the</b> {{door and}} hid behind Barney's snug, {{squeezed}} {{up with the}} laughing. And who was <b>sitting</b> up <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> corner that I hadn't seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob Doran. I didn't know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the door. And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a poodle. I thought Alf would split.|$|R
60|$|For a time--at {{all events}} until my book should be completed, {{which would be}} the work of several months--I took up my abode in my aunt's house at Dover; and <b>there,</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> window from which I had looked out at the moon upon the sea, when that roof first gave me shelter, I quietly pursued my task.|$|R
