When the subtropical ridge shifts due to El Niño, <b>so</b> <b>will</b> <b>the</b> preferred tropical cyclone tracks. Areas west of Japan and Korea tend to experience many fewer September–November tropical cyclone impacts during El Niño and neutral years. During El Niño years, the break in the subtropical ridge tends to lie near 130°E, which would favor the Japanese archipelago. During La Niña years, the formation of tropical cyclones, and the subtropical ridge position, shift westward across the western Pacific Ocean, which increases the landfall threat to China and greater intensity to Philippines. Those that form near the Marshall Islands find their way to Jeju Island, Korea.|$|E
5|$|Restoring the {{primitive}} scene {{is not done}} easily nor can it be done completely. Some species are extinct. Given time, an eastern hardwood forest can be regrown to maturity but the chestnut will be missing and <b>so</b> <b>will</b> <b>the</b> roar of pigeon wings. The colorful drapanid finches {{are not to be}} heard again in the lowland forests of Hawaii, nor will the jack-hammer of the ivory-bill ring in southern swamps. The wolf and grizzly bear cannot readily be reintroduced into ranching communities, and the factor of human use of the parks is subject only to regulation, not elimination. Exotic plants, animals, and diseases are here to stay. All these limitations we fully realize. Yet, if the goal cannot be fully achieved it can be approached. A reasonable illusion of primitive America could be recreated, using the utmost in skill, judgment, and ecologic sensitivity. This in our opinion should be the objective of every national park and monument.|$|E

25|$|As stated earlier, the CO2 {{released}} by soil respiration is a greenhouse gas {{that will continue}} to trap energy and increase the global mean temperature if concentrations continue to rise. As global temperature rises, <b>so</b> <b>will</b> <b>the</b> rate of soil respiration across the globe thereby leading to a higher concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, again leading to higher global temperatures. This {{is an example of a}} positive feedback loop. It is estimated that a rise in temperature by 2 degrees Celsius will lead to an additional release of 10 Pg carbon per year to the atmosphere from soil respiration. This is a larger amount than current anthropogenic carbon emissions. There also exists a possibility that this increase in temperature will release carbon stored in permanently frozen soils, which are now melting. Climate models have suggested that this positive feedback between soil respiration and temperature will lead to a decrease in soil stored carbon by the middle of this century.|$|E

25|$|Beerus has superhuman strength, {{durability}} and reflexes. Some of Beerus' unique attacks include , where he creates two flaming energy spheres and merges {{them into a}} large one before launching it, and , where he surrounds himself in an aura resembling a sun prior to releasing an energy wave. Beerus is introduced as stronger than prior antagonists, being able to dominate Goku {{in all of his}} Super Saiyan forms; after his battle with Super Saiyan God Goku, it is revealed he may be weaker than Whis. Due to his tremendous strength, he is initially feared by the protagonists. Beerus notably acts a similar manner when {{in the presence of the}} Omni-King. After Freeza's defeat, Whis speculates Goku and Vegeta may be able to defeat Beerus with their combined power. Similarly to other Gods of Destructions and Kaiō-shins, Beerus is life linked to the East Kaiō-shin, where if one dies then <b>so</b> <b>will</b> <b>the</b> other. This amounts to a weakness given East Kaiō-shin's vast inferiority in strength to Beerus. Due to the East Kaiō-shin being killed in the alternate timeline, while assisting Trunks in facing Dabura, the version of Beerus that exists there dies during his sleep.|$|E
25|$|The Rock Band Network is a {{downloadable}} {{content service}} designed by Harmonix and Microsoft to allow artists and labels to author ("chart") their own songs for play in Rock Band. Using special software provided by Harmonix, these songs are peer-reviewed for content before {{being put on}} the Network, and users {{will be able to}} browse through the available songs by several means. The Network will augment the songs added by Harmonix as downloadable content for the game. The Network became publicly available to Xbox 360 players on March 4, 2010, with all of the songs immediately available to the Network Store for Xbox 360, and certain selections of songs available to the PlayStation 3 and Wii. A major update of the Network was released early in 2011, after Rock Band 3 release, to including authoring tools for normal and Pro keyboards and vocal harmonies, but will not initially support Pro guitar/bass authoring until Harmonix is able to judge the support required for these tools. Harmonix also plans to better support the PlayStation 3 through this iteration. Due to lack of interest and difficulties with Nintendo's Wii storefront, Harmonix has discontinued making Network songs available for the Wii. Xbox 360 players will still be able to create and add songs to the Rock Band Network following the April 2, 2013 end of regular DLC, but Harmonix has stated that while these mechanisms are generally automated, they are based on third-party technology like Microsoft XNA, and should those services cease, <b>so</b> <b>will</b> <b>the</b> functionality of the Network. As release of Network songs for the PlayStation 3 require Harmonix to be fully involved, no further Network songs will be available for the PlayStation 3 after April 2, 2013. The Network was fully shuttered in September 2014 to allow Harmonix to move forward on other projects. Rock Band Network songs are incompatible with Rock Band 4 at launch; however, Harmonix has stated they will explore the logistics of bringing RBN songs into Rock Band 4 after completing the transition of all official DLC, packs, and disc exports.|$|E
