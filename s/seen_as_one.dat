5|$|Due to its {{originality}} and longevity, Winnie Winkle {{became a}} household name and an icon, inspiring even Pop Art artist Roy Lichtenstein. Winnie Winkle was reprinted in Dell Comics, {{and for a time}} her face appeared on a cigar box lid.

5|$|These units linked {{up several}} times during this war and engaged in several furious battles with the enemy.

I bless your book, and the author's fine hand and brain, {{whatever it may}} consist of; and I bend with interest over your remarks about poor speculating and squirming Italy's desperate dilemma. The infusion of that further horror of local devastation and anguish is too sickening for words--I have been able only to avert my face from it; as, if I were nearer, I fear I should but wrap my head in my mantle and give up altogether. The truth is however that the Italian case affects me as on the whole rather ugly--failing to <b>see,</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> does, their casus belli, and having to <b>see,</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> also does, that they must hunt up one to give them any sort of countenance at all.

5|$|At Stanford, Hammonds {{was named}} an All-American. The Orioles {{selected}} Hammonds with the fourth overall {{selection of the}} 1992 MLB Draft. Though he was <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> of the best prospects in baseball, injuries limited his performance with Baltimore. After he was traded to Cincinnati and then to Colorado, he emerged with the Rockies in 2000, and was selected to appear at the 2000 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. He signed a three-year, $21.75 million contract with the Milwaukee Brewers that off-season, but continued to struggle with injuries. He had a resurgence with the Giants in 2003, after he was released by the Brewers, but struggled with the Giants in 2004 and Nationals in 2005 before retiring.|$|E
5|$|Bartolomé de las Casas spent 50 {{years of}} his life {{actively}} fighting slavery and the violent colonial abuse of indigenous peoples, especially by trying to convince the Spanish court to adopt a more humane policy of colonization. Unlike the other priests who sought to destroy all of the indigenous peoples native books and writings, he was strictly opposed to this action. Although he failed to save the indigenous peoples of the Western Indies, his efforts resulted in several improvements in the legal status of the natives, and in an increased colonial focus on the ethics of colonialism. Las Casas is often <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> of the first advocates for universal conception of human dignity (later human rights).|$|E
5|$|Debuting {{first in}} a {{work-in-progress}} version at the 1991 New York Film Festival before its November 1991 wide release, Beauty and the Beast, directed by Kirk Wise & Gary Trousdale, was an unprecedented critical and commercial success, and would later be <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> of the studio's best films. The film earned six Academy Award nominations, including one for Best Picture, a first for an animated work, winning for Best Song and Best Original Score. Its $145 million box office gross set new records and merchandising for the film– including toys, cross-promotions, and soundtrack sales– was also lucrative.|$|E

5|$|During {{a mission}} which {{occurred}} on a disputed date, either 23 January or 25 January, Overton and his squadron commander, ace Edwin L. Heller flew {{north of the}} Yalu River in search of MiG formations. Heller and Overton both shot down aircraft, some sources say {{this was one of}} Overton's first five victories, while others say they were his sixth and seventh, for which he never received credit, but Heller was struck by a MiG and crashed. He was either 60 or 150 miles north of the Yalu River line, so a rescue attempt was not made. This was later <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> of the reasons Overton was singled out for reprimand for crossing the Yalu River. Most sources attribute Overton with only five victories.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other species}} of Pokémon, Pikachu are often {{captured}} and groomed by humans to fight other Pokémon for sport. Pikachu {{are one of the}} most well-known varieties of Pokémon, largely because a Pikachu is a central character in the Pokémon anime series.

It is also <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> of the major mascots for Nintendo.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{interest}} in the 1886 season concerned the newly inaugurated Eclipse Stakes at Sandown in July, which offered a then record prize of £10,000. From {{the start of the}} year, St. Gatien was <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> of the leading contenders for the new race together with Bendigo and Minting. For the second year in succession, St. Gatien's spring preparation was disrupted, this time by injury, although he was able to resume his training in time for Royal Ascot. It was reported that St. Gatien had been defeated by Melton in a private trial race in early 1886, but there are few details and it is unclear whether or not this was a serious contest.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the late}} nineteenth century the rhyme has been <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> of the most popular and well known in the English-speaking world. It has also been {{referenced}} in both literature and popular culture. It was used by T. S. Eliot at the climax of his poem The Waste Land (1922). The final line of the verse was probably the inspiration for the title of Lerner and Loewe's 1956 musical My Fair Lady. The tune is often used by English football supporters as the basis for chants.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known religious monument is the Catholic holy well in Penrhys first {{mentioned in}} the 15th century, though {{it may have been}} a place of pagan worship before this. This pilgrimage site was identified as a 'manor' belonging to the Cistercian Abbey of Llantarnam and was <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> of the most important religious sites in Wales, because of its Marian shrine. This holy site was the main reason people would pass through the commote; it was even thought to be the main reason why the first bridges were built over the River Rhondda.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his career, Sakic {{was one of}} the top scorers in the league, but in {{his early}} years, he was criticized for not leading his team to playoff success.

After leading the Avalanche to the Stanley Cup in 1996 with his 34 playoff points, Sakic began to be seen as capable of leading a team to success, and he was <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> of the league's premier players.|$|E
