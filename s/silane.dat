5|$|The {{conservation}} {{was carried}} out between 1974 and 1986, wherever possible using non-invasive procedures such as washing with water and a solution of lime, filling gaps and damaged surfaces with soft mortar to prevent the ingress of water and stabilising statues that were fracturing because of the corrosion of metal dowels. The surfaces were finished by painting with a thin coat of mortar and <b>silane</b> to resist further erosion and attack by pollutants. The restoration of the façade revealed much paint adhering to the statues and their niches, indicating that it had once been brightly coloured.|$|E

50|$|There {{is usually}} little need for <b>silanes</b> to be {{synthesised}} in the laboratory, {{since they are}} usually commercially available. <b>Silanes</b> are generally reactive chemically and biologically, but do not undergo functional group interconversions cleanly. When <b>silanes</b> are produced in the laboratory, it is often a side-product of a reaction. For example, the use magnesium silicide as a base gives the conjugate acids, mixed <b>silanes</b> as a side-product.|$|R

25|$|In Japan, {{in order}} to reduce the danger of <b>silane</b> for {{amorphous}} silicon solar cell manufacturing, several companies began to dilute <b>silane</b> with hydrogen gas. This resulted in a symbiotic benefit of making more stable solar photovoltaic cells as it reduced the Staebler-Wronski Effect.|$|E
25|$|If a leaking {{stream of}} <b>silane</b> is {{obstructed}} or confined, energy release due to combustion is more concentrated leading to increasing reaction speed and burning velocity – up to gas phase detonation and potentially severe damages. <b>Silane</b> may autoignite at under 54°C (130°F).|$|E

40|$|Metathesis-catalyzed polymerizations {{of primary}} <b>silanes</b> were {{performed}} to generate polysilanes suitable for functionalization {{with a variety of}} side groups. Modeling was employed to predict conformations and estimate electronic properties of candidate functionalized polysilanes. Chemical functionalization of oligo(hydrido) <b>silanes</b> with terminal {alpha}, {omega}-dienes under free radical conditions yielded highly crosslinked, nonporous polysilane networks. Ketone reduction with oligo(hydrido) <b>silanes</b> under free radical conditions led to novel poly(phenylalkoxysilanes).

25|$|Asymmetric ion pairs {{can also}} be {{attacked}} in intermolecular reactions. In an interesting example, asymmetric addition of enol <b>silane</b> nucleophiles to oxocarbenium ions can be effected by catalytically forming the oxocarbenium through anion binding. Starting from an acetal, the chloroether is generated with boron trichloride and reacted with the enol <b>silane</b> and catalyst. The mechanism of formation of the oxocarbenium-thiourea-chloride complex is not fully resolved. It is thought that under the reaction conditions, the chloroether can epimerize and thiourea can stereoselectively bind chloride to form a closely associated ion pair. This asymmetric ion pair is then attacked by the <b>silane</b> to generate alkylated product.|$|E

5000|$|The melting {{points of}} the <b>silanes</b> follow a similar trend to boiling points {{for the same reason}} as {{outlined}} above. That is, (all other things being equal) the larger the molecule the higher the melting point. There is one significant difference between boiling points and melting points. Solids have more rigid and fixed structure than liquids. This rigid structure requires energy to break down. Thus the better put together solid structures will require more energy to break apart. The odd-numbered <b>silanes</b> have a lower trend in melting points than even numbered <b>silanes.</b> This is because even numbered <b>silanes</b> pack well in the solid phase, forming a well-organized structure, which requires more energy to break apart. The odd-number <b>silanes</b> pack less well and so the [...] "looser" [...] organized solid packing structure requires less energy to break apart.|$|R
