25|$|After a {{measuring}} time of 2 or 5 minutes, {{depending on the}} data sheet specification, the measured leakage current value has to be lower than the calculated value. Normally the leakage current is always lower the longer the capacitor voltage is applied. The leakage current during operation after, for example, one hour is the operational leakage current. This value depends strongly on the manufacturer's series characteristics. It could be lower than 1/100 of the <b>specified</b> <b>value.</b>|$|E

500|$|The CCU {{proposal}} {{recommended that}} {{the text of the}} definitions of all the base units be either refined or rewritten changing the emphasis from explicit-unit to explicit-constant type definitions. Explicit-unit type definitions define a unit in terms of a specific example of that unit—for example in 1324 Edward II defined the inch as being the length of three barleycorns and since 1889 the kilogram has been defined as being the mass of the International Prototype Kilogram. In explicit-constant definitions, a constant of nature is given a <b>specified</b> <b>value</b> and the definition of the unit emerges as a consequence. For example, in 1983, the speed of light was defined to be exactly [...] metres per second and, since the second had been independently defined, the length of the metre could thus be derived.|$|E
500|$|The {{precision}} {{applications in}} which mechanical filters are used {{require that the}} resonators are accurately adjusted to the specified resonance frequency. [...] This is known as trimming and usually involves a mechanical machining process. [...] In most filter designs, this {{can be difficult to}} do once the resonators have been assembled into the complete filter so the resonators are trimmed before assembly. [...] Trimming is done in at least two stages; coarse and fine, with each stage bringing the resonance frequency closer to the <b>specified</b> <b>value.</b> [...] Most trimming methods involve removing material from the resonator which will increase the resonance frequency. [...] The target frequency for a coarse trimming stage consequently needs to be set below the final frequency since the tolerances of the process could otherwise result in a frequency higher than the following fine trimming stage could adjust for.|$|E

500|$|One {{advantage}} that mechanical filters have over LC electrical filters {{is that they}} can be made very stable. The resonance frequency can be made so stable that it varies only 1.5parts per billion (ppb) from the <b>specified</b> <b>value</b> over the operating temperature range (...) , and its average drift with time can be as low as 4ppb per day. This stability with temperature is another reason for using nickel-iron as the resonator material. Variations with temperature in the resonance frequency (and other features of the frequency function) are directly related to variations in the Young's modulus, which is a measure of stiffness of the material. [...] Materials are therefore sought that have a small temperature coefficient of Young's modulus. [...] In general, Young's modulus has a negative temperature coefficient (materials become less stiff with increasing temperature) but additions of small amounts of certain other elements in the alloy can produce a material with a temperature coefficient that changes sign from negative through zero to positive with temperature. Such a material will have a zero coefficient of temperature with resonance frequency around a particular temperature. It is possible to adjust the point of zero temperature coefficient to a desired position by heat treatment of the alloy.|$|E

2500|$|For a given load, sizing of a {{smoothing}} capacitor is a tradeoff between reducing ripple voltage and increasing ripple current. The peak current is {{set by the}} rate of rise of the supply voltage on the rising edge of the incoming sine-wave, reduced by {{the resistance of the}} transformer windings. [...] High ripple currents increase I2R losses (in the form of heat) in the capacitor, rectifier and transformer windings, and may exceed the ampacity of the components or VA rating of the transformer. [...] Vacuum tube rectifiers specify the maximum capacitance of the input capacitor, and SS diode rectifiers also have current limitations. [...] Capacitors for this application need low ESR, or ripple current may overheat them. [...] To limit ripple voltage to a <b>specified</b> <b>value</b> the required capacitor size is proportional to the load current and inversely proportional to the supply frequency and the number of output peaks of the rectifier per input cycle. Full-wave rectified output requires a smaller capacitor because it is double the frequency of half-wave rectified output. [...] To reduce ripple to a satisfactory limit with just a single capacitor would often require a capacitor that's infeasibly large.|$|E
6000|$|The China Year Book for 1919[105] (a work {{as little}} {{concerned}} with politics as Whitaker's Almanack) gives {{a list of}} the five principal iron mines in China, with some information about each. The first and most important are the Tayeh mines, worked by the Hanyehping Iron and Coal Co., Ltd., which, as the reader may remember, was the subject of the third group in the Twenty-one Demands. The total amount of ore in sight is estimated by the China Year Book at 50,000,000 tons, derived chiefly from two mines, in one of which the ore yields 65 per cent. of iron, in the other 58 to 63 per cent. The output for 1916 is given as 603,732 tons (it has been greatly increased since then). The Year Book proceeds: [...] "Japanese capital is invested in the Company, and by the agreement between China and Japan of May 1915 [after the ultimatum which enforced the revised Twenty-one Demands], the Chinese Government undertook not to convert the Company into a State-owned concern nor to compel it to borrow money from other than Japanese sources." [...] It should be added that there is a Japanese accountant and a Japanese technical adviser, and that pig-iron and ore, up to a <b>specified</b> <b>value,</b> must be sold to the Imperial Japanese works at much below the market price, leaving a paltry residue for sale in the open market.[106] ...|$|E
