It includes, for example, the effects of solar coronal mass ejections, <b>solar</b> flares and <b>irradiances,</b> <b>solar</b> and galactic energetic particles, {{as well as the}} solar wind, all of which affect Earth’s magnetospheric particles and fields, geomagnetic and electrodynamical conditions, radiation belts, aurorae, ionosphere, and the neutral thermosphere and mesosphere during perturbed and quiet levels of solar activity. We present a summary of two ongoing activities to understand, then mitigate, space weather risks and their impacts to operational systems.

25|$|In optical radiometry, {{sheets of}} PTFE {{are used as}} {{measuring}} heads in spectroradiometers and broadband radiometers (e.g., illuminance meters and UV radiometers) due to PTFE's capability to diffuse a transmitting light nearly perfectly. Moreover, optical properties of PTFE stay constant {{over a wide range}} of wavelengths, from UV down to near infrared. In this region, the relation of its regular transmittance to diffuse transmittance is negligibly small, so light transmitted through a diffuser (PTFE sheet) radiates like Lambert's cosine law. Thus PTFE enables cosinusoidal angular response for a detector measuring the power of optical radiation at a surface, e.g. in <b>solar</b> <b>irradiance</b> measurements.|$|E

The cloud albedo is a measure for the portion of solar radiation reflected back to space by clouds. This information {{is essential for the}} analysis and interpretation of the Earth’s radiation budget and the <b>solar</b> surface <b>irradiance.</b> We present and discuss a method for the production of the effective cloud albedo and the <b>solar</b> surface <b>irradiance</b> based on the visible channel (0. 45 – 1 μm) on-board of the Meteosat satellites. This method includes a newly developed self-calibration approach and has been used to generate a 23 -year long (1983 – 2005) continuous and validated climate data record of the effective cloud albedo and the <b>solar</b> surface <b>irradiance.</b> Using these records we demonstrate the ability of the method to provide these essential variables in high accuracy and homogeneity. Further on, we discuss the role of the cloud albedo within climate monitoring and analysis. We found trends with opposite sign in the observed effective cloud albedo resulting in positive trends in the <b>solar</b> surface <b>irradiance</b> over ocean and partly negative trends over land. Ground measurements are scarce over the ocean and thus satellite-derived effective cloud albedo and <b>solar</b> surface <b>irradiance</b> constitutes a unique observational data source.

The total <b>solar</b> <b>irradiance</b> is measured by satellite to be roughly 1361 watts per square meter (see solar constant), though it fluctuates by about 6.9% during the year due to the Earth's varying distance from the sun.

25|$|The {{carbon dioxide}} {{solubility}} in seawater is also affected by temperature {{and by the}} carbonate buffer. The decrease of solubility of carbon dioxide in seawater when temperature increases {{is also an important}} retroaction factor (positive feedback) exacerbating past and future climate changes as observed in ice cores from the Vostok site in Antarctica. At the geological time scale, because of the Milankovich cycles, when the astronomical parameters of the Earth orbit and its rotation axis progressively change and modify the <b>solar</b> <b>irradiance</b> at the Earth surface, temperature starts to increase. When a deglaciation period is initiated, the progressive warming of the oceans releases CO2 in the atmosphere because of its lower solubility in warmer sea water. On its turn, higher levels of CO2 in the atmosphere increase the greenhouse effect and carbon dioxide acts as an amplifier of the general warming.|$|E

The highly {{variable}} solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation {{is the major}} energy input to the Earth’s upper atmosphere, strongly impacting the geospace environment, affecting satellite operations, communications, and navigation. The Extreme ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE) onboard the NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) will measure the <b>solar</b> EUV <b>irradiance</b> from 0. 1 to 105 nm with unprecedented spectral resolution (0. 1 nm), temporal cadence (10 sec), and accuracy (20 %). The EVE program will provide <b>solar</b> EUV <b>irradiance</b> data for NASA's Living With the Star (LWS) program, including near real-time data products for use in operational atmospheric models that specify the space environment and to assist in forecasting space weather operations. The EVE program will advance understanding of the physics of the <b>solar</b> EUV <b>irradiance</b> variations on time scales from flares to the solar cycle. This progress, which includes providing better predictions, will result from simultaneous measurements of the <b>solar</b> EUV <b>irradiance</b> and full Sun images of magnetic fields and brightness at wavelengths emitted from the chromosphere, transition region, and corona, which are obtained by other SDO instruments. The EVE includes several instruments that measure EUV irradiance {{over a wide range}} of wavelengths.

40|$|<b>Solar</b> {{spectral}} <b>irradiance</b> variations {{and related}} PV energy gains or losses {{are one of}} the last great unknowns in PV yield prediction.
