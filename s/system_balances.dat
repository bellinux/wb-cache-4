The concept of an intertemporal price system provides the unifying framework. This <b>system</b> <b>balances</b> current demands and supplies for products and factors of production.

The long-run dynamics of economic growth are captured through linkages among capital services, capital stocks, and past investments. Alternative policies are compared in terms of the impact of changes in policy on individual and social welfare. This approach was incorporated into the official guidelines for preparing economic analyses by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2000.|$|E

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to trigger the devolution of the <b>system</b> <b>balancing</b> responsibility entirely belonging to the transmission system operator (TSO) to several local distribution system operators by fairly allocating <b>system</b> <b>balancing</b> cost based on a cost-causality principle. Within the devolved <b>system</b> <b>balancing</b> scheme, distribution <b>system</b> operators (DSOs) have appropriate motivation for reducing the variability and uncertainty caused by units in their own area. As the number of renewable electricity sources (RES) being connected to the local distribution system increases, it would be advantageous for the TSO to share the increasing burden of the <b>system</b> <b>balancing</b> responsibility with multiple DSOs. To achieve this, we suggest that, first DSOs be designated as the representatives of their own jurisdictions with primary economic responsibility for balancing payments that are originally charged to each energy market participant. Second, {{this research}} proves that a cost-causality based cost allocation scheme(CC-CAS) is superior to an energy-amount based cost allocation scheme (currently widely used) in terms of economic efficiency. Additionally, to avoid the side effect that a DSO with a large amount of RES may face a high and risky balancing payment under the CC-CAS, this research also proposes an optimal balancing payment insurance (BPI) contract which helps the DSO hedge the risks associated with uncertain balancing payments...|$|R

Unlike other systems for automated builds and tests, our framework is not tied to a specific developer tool, revision control system, or testing frame-work, and allows access to computing resources across administrative boundaries. Users define complex soft-ware building procedures for multiple platforms with simple semantics.
