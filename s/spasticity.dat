5|$|Spasticity: <b>spasticity</b> is {{characterized}} by increased stiffness and slowness in limb movement, the development of certain postures, an association with weakness of voluntary muscle power, and with involuntary and sometimes painful spasms of limbs. A physiotherapist can help to reduce <b>spasticity</b> and avoid the development of contractures with techniques such as passive stretching. Nabiximols is safe and effective for relieving spacticity. There is evidence, albeit limited, of the clinical effectiveness of baclofen, dantrolene, diazepam, and tizanidine. In the most complicated cases intrathecal injections of baclofen can be used. There are also palliative measures like castings, splints or customized seatings.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} for erectile dysfunction to exist not {{as a direct result}} of SCI but due to factors such as major depression, diabetes, or drugs such as those taken for <b>spasticity.</b> Finding and treating the root cause may alleviate the problem. For example, men who experience erectile problems as the result of a testosterone deficiency can receive androgen replacement therapy.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin {{administration}} {{in the second and}} third trimesters is much less commonly associated with birth defects, and when they do occur, are considerably different from fetal warfarin syndrome. The most common congenital abnormalities associated with warfarin use in late pregnancy are central nervous system disorders, including <b>spasticity</b> and seizures, and eye defects. Because of such later pregnancy birth defects, anticoagulation with warfarin poses a problem in pregnant women requiring warfarin for vital indications, such as stroke prevention in those with artificial heart valves.|$|E
5|$|Both {{medications}} and neurorehabilitation {{have been shown}} to improve some symptoms, though neither changes the course of the disease. Some symptoms have a good response to medication, such as an unstable bladder and <b>spasticity,</b> while others are little changed. For neurologic problems, a multidisciplinary approach is important for improving quality of life; however, it is difficult to specify a 'core team' as many health services may be needed at different points in time. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs increase activity and participation of people with MS but do not influence impairment level. There is limited evidence for the overall efficacy of individual therapeutic disciplines, though there is good evidence that specific approaches, such as exercise, and psychology therapies, in particular cognitive behavioral approaches are effective.|$|E
5|$|Pain: {{acute pain}} is mainly due to optic {{neuritis}} (with corticosteroids {{being the best}} treatment available), as well as trigeminal neuralgia, Lhermitte's sign, or dysesthesias. Subacute pain is usually secondary to the disease and can be a consequence of spending too long in the same position, urinary retention, and infected skin ulcers, amongst others. Treatment will depend on cause. Chronic pain is very common and harder to treat as its most common cause is dysesthesias. Acute pain due to trigeminal neuralgia is usually successfully treated with anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine or phenytoin. Both Lhermitte's sign and painful dysesthesias usually respond to treatment with carbamazepine, clonazepam, or amitriptyline. Sativex is approved for treatment of pain in MS in different countries, but due to its derivation from cannabis, it is currently not available in others, such as the USA. This medication is also being investigated {{for the management of}} other MS symptoms, such as <b>spasticity,</b> and has shown long-term safety and efficacy.|$|E
5|$|Interferons, a {{subclass}} of cytokines, {{are produced}} in the body during illnesses such as influenza {{in order to help}} fight the infection. They are responsible of many of the symptoms of influenza infections, including fever, muscle aches, fatigue, and headaches. Many patients report influenza-like symptoms hours after taking interferon-beta that usually improve within 24 hours, being such symptoms related to the temporary increase of cytokines. This reaction tends to disappear after 3 months of treatment and its symptoms can be treated with over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, that reduce fever and pain. Another common transient secondary effect with interferon-beta is a functional deterioration of already existing symptoms of the disease. Such deterioration is similar to the one produced in MS patients due to heat, fever or stress (Uhthoff's phenomenon), usually appears within 24 hours of treatment, is more common in the initial months of treatment, and may last several days. A symptom specially sensitive to worsening is <b>spasticity.</b> Interferon-beta can also reduce numbers of white blood cells (leukopenia), lymphocytes (lymphopenia) and neutrophils (neutropenia), as well as affect liver function. In most cases these effects are non-dangerous and reversible after cessation or reduction of treatment. Nevertheless, recommendation is that all patients should be monitored through laboratory blood analyses, including liver function tests, to ensure safe use of interferons.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is calculated}} by a dietitian for each child. Age, weight, activity levels, culture and food preferences all affect the meal plan. First, the energy requirements are set at 80–90% of the recommended daily amounts (RDA) for the child's age (the high-fat diet requires less energy to process than a typical high-carbohydrate diet). Highly active children {{or those with}} muscle <b>spasticity</b> require more calories than this; immobile children require less. The ketogenic ratio of the diet compares the weight of fat to the combined weight of carbohydrate and protein. This is typically 4:1, but children who are younger than 18months, older than 12years, or who are obese may be started on a 3:1 ratio. Fat is energy-rich, with 9kcal/g (38kJ/g) compared to 4kcal/g (17kJ/g) for carbohydrate or protein, so portions on the ketogenic diet are smaller than normal. The quantity of fat in the diet can be calculated from the overall energy requirements and the chosen ketogenic ratio. Next, the protein levels are set to allow for growth and body maintenance, and are around 1g protein for each kg of body weight. Lastly, the amount of carbohydrate is set according to what allowance is left while maintaining the chosen ratio. Any carbohydrate in medications or supplements must be subtracted from this allowance. The total daily amount of fat, protein and carbohydrate is then evenly divided across the meals.|$|E
25|$|Surgical {{treatment}} for <b>spasticity</b> includes lengthening or releasing of muscle and tendons, procedures involving bones, and also selective dorsal rhizotomy. Rhizotomy, {{usually reserved for}} severe <b>spasticity,</b> involves cutting selective sensory nerve roots, as they probably {{play a role in}} generating <b>spasticity.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Spasticity.</b> Based on {{the results}} of 3 high quality trials and 5 of lower quality, oral {{cannabis}} extract was rated as effective, and THC as probably effective, for improving people's subjective experience of <b>spasticity.</b> Oral cannabis extract and THC both were rated as possibly effective for improving objective measures of <b>spasticity.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Spasticity</b> {{related to}} {{amyotrophic}} lateral sclerosis.|$|E
25|$|Contraindications {{for surgery}} are severe {{pressure}} sores, severe <b>spasticity,</b> inability {{to stabilize the}} trunk.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spasticity,</b> if present, {{can be very}} important. It is not a {{contraindication}} per se, but severe <b>spasticity</b> must {{be treated}} first depending in which muscle groups it is present. Spascticity can be treated with botox or myotomies. In some cases spastic tone can be useful to facilitate hand grasp and grip. Harmful <b>spasticity</b> that does not respond to medication or surgical treatment is a contraindication. The shoulder muscles, pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi, must be evaluated. The shoulder must not only have good motor condition but also good proprioceptive control. The trophicity and articular condition of the upper limb must also be considered. A poor condition requires a preoperative rehabilitation program.|$|E
25|$|Occasionally, {{terms such}} as monoplegia, paraplegia, triplegia, and pentaplegia may {{also be used to}} refer to {{specific}} manifestations of the <b>spasticity.</b>|$|E
25|$|No {{medication}} {{is effective in}} controlling the extrapyramidal motor features of the disease. <b>Spasticity,</b> however, can be reduced by the administration of baclofen or benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|Clonidine {{and other}} {{imidazoline}} compounds {{have also been}} shown to reduce muscle spasms by their central nervous system activity. Tizanidine is perhaps the most thoroughly studied clonidine analog, and is an agonist at α2-adrenergic receptors, but reduces <b>spasticity</b> at doses that result in significantly less hypotension than clonidine. Neurophysiologic studies show that it depresses excitatory feedback from muscles that would normally increase muscle tone, therefore minimizing <b>spasticity.</b> Furthermore, several clinical trials indicate that tizanidine has a similar efficacy to other spasmolytic agents, such as diazepam and baclofen, with a different spectrum of adverse effects.|$|E
25|$|A common way {{to manage}} striatal {{necrosis}} {{is to provide}} special seating. These special wheelchairs are designed to limit abnormal movements. However, <b>spasticity</b> can be worsened by constraint.|$|E
25|$|Animals {{with reduced}} {{expression}} of this transporter exhibit severe motor deficits, epileptiform activity, and <b>spasticity.</b> KCC2 knockout animals, in which KCC2 is completely absent, die postnatally due to respiratory failure.|$|E
25|$|As {{compared}} to other types of CP, and especially as {{compared to}} hypotonic or paralytic mobility disabilities, spastic CP is typically more easily manageable by the person affected, and medical treatment can be pursued on a multitude of orthopedic and neurological fronts throughout life. In any form of spastic CP, clonus of the affected limb(s) may sometimes result, as well as muscle spasms resulting from the pain or stress of the tightness experienced. The <b>spasticity</b> can and usually does lead to a very early onset of muscle stress symptoms like arthritis and tendinitis, especially in ambulatory individuals in their mid-20s and early-30s. Occupational therapy and physical therapy regimens of assisted stretching, strengthening, functional tasks, or targeted physical activity and exercise are usually the chief ways to keep spastic CP well-managed. If the <b>spasticity</b> {{is too much for}} the person to handle, other remedies may be considered, such as antispasmodic medications, botulinum toxin, baclofen, or even a neurosurgery known as a selective dorsal rhizotomy (which eliminates the <b>spasticity</b> by reducing the excitatory neural response in the nerves causing it).|$|E
25|$|Chemically it is a {{derivative}} of the neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). It {{is believed to}} work by activating (or agonizing) GABA receptors, specifically the GABAB receptors. Its beneficial effects in <b>spasticity</b> result from its actions {{in the brain and}} spinal cord.|$|E
25|$|Baclofen, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Lioresal among others, is a {{medication}} used to treat <b>spasticity.</b> It serves as a {{central nervous system depressant}} and skeletal muscle relaxant. It is also used in topical creams to help with pain.|$|E
25|$|Treatment of <b>spasticity</b> {{related to}} stroke often {{involves}} early mobilizations, commonly {{performed by a}} physiotherapist, combined with elongation of spastic muscles and sustained stretching through various positionings. Gaining initial improvement in range of motion is often achieved through rhythmic rotational patterns associated with the affected limb. After full range has been achieved by the therapist, the limb should be positioned in the lengthened positions to prevent against further contractures, skin breakdown, and disuse of the limb {{with the use of}} splints or other tools to stabilize the joint. Cold in the form of ice wraps or ice packs have been proven to briefly reduce <b>spasticity</b> by temporarily dampening neural firing rates. Electrical stimulation to the antagonist muscles or vibrations has also been used with some success.|$|E
25|$|Cerebral palsy is also {{classified}} {{according to}} the topographic distribution of muscle <b>spasticity.</b> This method classifies children as diplegic, (bilateral involvement with leg involvement greater than arm involvement), hemiplegic (unilateral involvement), or quadriplegic (bilateral involvement with arm involvement {{equal to or greater}} than leg involvement).|$|E
25|$|THC is also {{an active}} {{ingredient}} in nabiximols, a specific extract of Cannabis that was approved as a botanical drug in the United Kingdom in 2010 as a mouth spray for people with multiple sclerosis to alleviate neuropathic pain, <b>spasticity,</b> overactive bladder, and other symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Clinically, {{physicians}} have also classified cerebral palsy {{according to the}} topographic distribution of muscle <b>spasticity.</b> This method classifies children as diplegic, (bilateral involvement with leg involvement greater than arm involvement), hemiplegic (unilateral involvement), or quadriplegic (bilateral involvement with arm involvement {{equal to or greater}} than leg involvement).|$|E
25|$|Currently, {{there is}} no cure for laminopathies and {{treatment}} is largely symptomatic and supportive. Physical therapy and/or corrective orthopedic surgery may be helpful for patients with muscular dystrophies. Cardiac problems that occur with some laminopathies may require a pacemaker. Treatment for neuropathies may include medication for seizures and <b>spasticity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Muscle relaxants (according to one study) {{were not}} advised for {{orthopedic}} conditions, but rather for neurological {{conditions such as}} <b>spasticity</b> in cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis. Dantrolene, although thought of primarily as a peripherally acting agent, is associated with CNS effects, whereas baclofen activity is strictly associated with the CNS.|$|E
25|$|Neurologic {{symptoms}} and signs {{vary depending on}} the site of the brain abnormalities. Common symptoms are partial epilepsy, asymmetric <b>spasticity,</b> ataxia and cognitive impairment. The latter affects visuospatial and visuoconstructive skills first. The intracranial pressure can be elevated if cysts develop in the brain. Migraine-like headaches can occur.|$|E
25|$|Loss of KCC2 {{following}} neuronal damage (i.e. ischemia, {{spinal cord}} damage, physical {{trauma to the}} central nervous system) results {{in the loss of}} inhibitory regulation and the subsequent development of neuronal hyperexcitability, motor <b>spasticity,</b> and seizure-like activity as GABAA receptors and glycine receptors revert from hyperpolarizing to depolarizing postsynaptic effects.|$|E
25|$|Juvenile Tay–Sachs disease. Juvenile Tay–Sachs {{disease is}} rarer than {{other forms of}} Tay–Sachs, and usually is {{initially}} seen in children between two and ten years old. People with Tay–Sachs disease develop cognitive and motor skill deterioration, dysarthria, dysphagia, ataxia, and <b>spasticity.</b> Death usually occurs between {{the age of five}} to fifteen years.|$|E
25|$|The {{neurological}} {{symptoms are}} progressive {{and can lead}} to severe <b>spasticity,</b> bulbar symptoms and dysarthria within one to two decades. The life span is shorter than normal. Death occurs between 2 and 30 years of age, depending on the severity of the syndrome. The immediate cause of death is pneumonia, fulminant intestinal bleeding or multiple organ dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|GD type II (acute {{infantile}} neuropathic) typically begins within 6 {{months of}} birth and has an incidence rate around one 1 in 100,000 live births. Symptoms include an enlarged liver and spleen, extensive and progressive brain damage, eye movement disorders, <b>spasticity,</b> seizures, limb rigidity, and a poor ability to suck and swallow. Affected children usually die by age two.|$|E
25|$|Deficiency of {{magnesium}} can cause tiredness, generalized weakness, muscle cramps, abnormal heart rhythms, increased irritability {{of the nervous}} system with tremors, paresthesias, palpitations, hypokalemia, hypoparathyroidism which might result in hypocalcemia, chondrocalcinosis, <b>spasticity</b> and tetany, epileptic seizures, basal ganglia calcifications and in extreme and prolonged cases coma, intellectual disability or death. Other symptoms that have been suggested to be associated with hypomagnesemia are athetosis, jerking, nystagmus, and an extensor plantar reflex, confusion, disorientation, hallucinations, depression, hypertension and fast heart rate.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of affected children present with symptoms and signs {{relating to the}} eyes such as leukokoria, redness, irritation and impaired vision, which result from retinal detachment and glaucoma. A minority present with seizures or <b>spasticity.</b> The time of onset of symptoms varies from infancy to adolescence. Because a child born before term will need to undergo screening for retinopathy of prematurity, some will have abnormalities in their retinal blood vessels detected when they have no symptoms yet.|$|E
25|$|Since 1939, the Academy {{has held}} an Annual Assembly each fall. As the largest meeting of physiatrists in the world, the Assembly attracts nearly 2,000 {{attendees}} each year. The meeting offers an educational program with PM workshops that offer {{continuing medical education}} (CME) {{as well as a}} job fair and exhibit hall. In addition to the Annual Assembly, the Academy holds several other live courses and workshops covering musculoskeletal ultrasound, spinal procedures, coding and billing, and <b>spasticity</b> and dystonia.|$|E
25|$|Spastic diplegia (the lower {{extremities}} {{are affected}} {{with little to}} no upper-body <b>spasticity).</b> The {{most common form of}} the spastic forms. Most people with spastic diplegia are fully ambulatory and have a scissors gait. Flexed knees and hips to varying degrees are common. Hip problems, dislocations, and in three-quarters of spastic diplegics, also strabismus (crossed eyes), can be present as well. In addition, these individuals are often nearsighted. The intelligence of a person with spastic diplegia is unaffected by the condition.|$|E
25|$|Baclofen is {{considered}} to be at least as effective as diazepam in reducing <b>spasticity,</b> and causes much less sedation. It acts as a GABA agonist at GABAB receptors in the brain and spinal cord, resulting in hyperpolarization of neurons expressing this receptor, most likely due to increased potassium ion conductance. Baclofen also inhibits neural function presynaptically, by reducing calcium ion influx, and thereby reducing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters in both the brain and spinal cord. It may also reduce pain in patients by inhibiting the release of substance P in the spinal cord, as well.|$|E
