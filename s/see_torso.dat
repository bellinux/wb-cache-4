50|$|The {{technology}} {{differs from}} standard Virtual Reality. With standard Virtual Reality, people wear screens over their eyes, the headsets {{through which they}} are unable to <b>see</b> their own <b>torso,</b> arms or legs. Whereas in a VR CAVE, instead of going into the computer game, the person wears clear glasses and can see their own body, the computer-generated objects appearing to be in the real world with them.|$|R

5000|$|In 2012, NASA {{introduced}} the Z-1 spacesuit, {{the first in}} the Z-series of spacesuit prototypes designed by NASA specifically for planetary extravehicular activity. The Z-1 spacesuit includes an emphasis on mobility and protection for space missions. It features a soft torso versus the hard <b>torsos</b> <b>seen</b> in previous NASA EVA spacesuits, which provides reduced mass. It has been labeled the [...] "Buzz Lightyear suit" [...] due to its green streaks for a design.|$|R
5000|$|Jake's {{choice of}} {{clothing}} {{is almost always}} an orange T-shirt and blue jeans, although in some cases this changes (for example, in Wall Street he wears a business suit). In scenes where Jake is unclothed, we <b>see</b> his <b>torso</b> is quite muscular. He has spiky brown hair. He is also the only male character in the series to have his penis censored, mostly by pixelation, objects and occasionally, the [...] "LD" [...] (Long Dilsnic - [...] "Dilsnic" [...] standing for [...] "Dick") logo. The LD is often mentioned throughout the run of episodes. Jake's catchphrase is [...] "Fo' sheezy!", although he has a few other repeated phrases, such as [...] "Laaate," [...] "Once again, it's on!" [...] and [...] "Hells, no!". He deliberately uses these colloquialisms for comic effect. He {{appears to have a}} mercurial sense of humour, and laughs a lot.|$|R

40|$|Photograph of {{statue of}} Ifrit, [s. d. ]. At center, {{a statue of}} Ifrit can be seen. The statue depicts {{what appears to be}} a man with a {{bandanna}} in the shape of horns above its head. The rest of the bandanna flows along its bare chest. The statues eyes are narrowed and its lips are shown in a sneer. In its left had, the statue grips part of a sword. An elaborate alcove can be <b>seen</b> behind the <b>torso</b> of the statue. Small circular shadows and part of a column can be seen in the foreground. Photo sleeve reads: "Japanese, Chinese, Korean"...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The Phantom <b>Torso,</b> <b>seen</b> {{here in the}} Destiny {{laboratory}} on the International Space Station (ISS), {{is designed}} to measure the effects of radiation on organs inside the body by using a torso {{that is similar to}} those used to train radiologists on Earth. The torso is equivalent in height and weight to an average adult male. It contains radiation detectors that will measure, in real-time, how much radiation the brain, thyroid, stomach, colon, and heart and lung area receive on a daily basis. The data will be used to determine how the body reacts to and shields its internal organs from radiation, which will be important for longer duration space flights.|$|R
50|$|Later, Lee awakens on a {{small island}} beside Jim's body. She {{bandages}} her broken finger with the fabric from her shirt and <b>sees</b> that her <b>torso</b> is bleeding. She takes Jim's gun and washes it off. She takes the remains of one of Jim's arms and uses it to try to lure the crocodile to her. When this fails, she stands up and looks around, unaware that the crocodile has surfaced behind her. She turns around as it attacks her. She tries to shoot the crocodile but the gun misfires. A chase ensues {{as she tries to}} run. After running, the crocodile in close pursuit, Lee turns around to see it has vanished. She looks around everywhere, gun in hand, waiting to shoot it. The crocodile surfaces in front of her, and the gun misfires again. The crocodile grabs her and pulls her underwater. Lee realizes that the hand holding the gun is in the crocodiles mouth. She pulls the trigger while it thrashes her around and the gun shoots the crocodile in the head. The crocodile dies and Lee makes her way back to Grace.|$|R
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of Samuel B. Bell, [s. d. ]. Bell can be <b>seen</b> from his <b>torso</b> {{to his head}} facing to the right. He is visible wearing a dark jacket with a black collar, dark tie, and white shirt with and upturned collar. He has curly dark hair that extends almost to his shoulders. Bell was born in Orange County, New York, in 1817 and died in Santa Barbara in 1897. He came to California in 1853 {{as part of a}} group of eight clergymen sent out as missionaries by the Presbyterian General Assembly. His arrival in San Francisco on March 20, 1853, on the clipper ship Trade Wind, marked the end of a 102 day, record-setting voyage from New York via Cape Horn. Mr. Bell was the first minister of the first Presbyterian Church of Oakland, organized March 20, 1835 (?). He was one of the incorporators of the College of California, predecessor to the University of California, and was instrumental in the establishment of the University. He was Chairman of the first Republican Convention in 1856; in 1857 and 1858, he represented Alameda and Santa Clara in the Senate. In 1859, he was one of the candidates for the Republican nomination for governor. Dr. Bell was large, erect, and an effective speaker, self-denying and self-forgetful, and his influence and usefulness in the community was great...|$|R
5000|$|Egyptian art {{is famous}} for its {{distinctive}} figure convention, used for the main figures in both relief and painting, with parted legs (where not seated) and head shown as seen from the side, but the <b>torso</b> <b>seen</b> as from the front, and a standard set of proportions making up the figure, using 18 [...] "fists" [...] to go from the ground to the hair-line on the forehead. [...] This appears as early as the Narmer Palette from Dynasty I, but there as elsewhere the convention is not used for minor figures shown engaged in some activity, such as the captives and corpses. [...] Other conventions make statues of males darker than females ones. Very conventionalized portrait statues appear from as early as Dynasty II, before 2,780 BC, and {{with the exception of the}} art of the Amarna period of Ahkenaten, and some other periods such as Dynasty XII, the idealized features of rulers, like other Egyptian artistic conventions, changed little until after the Greek conquest.Egyptian art uses hierarchical proportion, where the size of figures indicates their relative importance. The gods or the divine pharaoh are usually larger than other figures and the figures of high officials or the tomb owner are usually smaller, and at the smallest scale any servants and entertainers, animals, trees, and architectural details.|$|R
500|$|The primary {{composition}} of the painting is in {{the contrast between the}} solemn jester (Stańczyk)– obviously the focus of the painting– and the lively ball going on in the background. Stańczyk is shown sitting alone in a dark room, while a ball, hosted by the royal family, is in full swing in the neighbouring hall. His appearance is unlike that one would expect in a jester– gloomy, deep in thought. His seriousness is reinforced by his accessories: his marotte lies discarded on the floor, whereas a holy medallion of the Black Madonna of Częstochowa can be <b>seen</b> on his <b>torso.</b> The wrinkled carpet at Stanczyk's feet could have been formed by his collapsing heavily into the chair upon reading the letter, or through a nervous shifting of the feet thereafter. On the table lies a letter likely announcing that Poland has lost Smolensk (now in Russia) to the Grand Duchy of Muscovy, causing Stańczyk's sorrow and reflection on his fatherland's fate. The letter seems to have been discarded by some official, and only the jester realizes its significance– while the rulers are partying, celebrating the recent victory at the battle of Orsha, disregarding the bad news about Smolensk. [...] It {{is interesting to note that}} the letter bears the year 1533 (A.d. MDXXXIII) and the name [...] "Samogitia", a province of the Commonwealth. [...] The note is incongruent with the actual date of the fall of Smolensk in 1514, and is a matter of ongoing debate, with an outright mistake by the meticulous Matejko, known for use of symbolism and iconography, being unlikely. [...] Another symbol, a lute, symbol of glory, is being carried by a midget, stereotyped as a person of low stature and morale in Matejko's time; this suggests a decline of the Jagiellon dynasty's fortunes. The window is thrown - or was blown - open, ruffling the tablecloth and alluding to an upset of the present order. [...] Through the open window, the darkened profile of Wawel Cathedral in Krakow is visible - the site of the coronation of Polish kings. [...] Next to it, a comet is seen– a portent of ill fortune. [...] The imagery of downfall is completed with the inclusion of the three stars of Orion's Belt seen above and to the left of the cathedral spire. [...] In Greek mythology, Orion was a powerful hunter blinded by ego and his own greatness, but was ultimately brought down by the pinprick of a scorpion's sting.|$|R
40|$|Am I as much— Am I as much as…being seen?” In this article, we take up M’s closing {{question}} from Play, {{arguing that it}} is the overriding central phenomenological conundrum in much of Beckett’s stage and screen work. The question we selectively take to Beckett’s oeuvre is: {{what is the relationship between}} perception and presence, consciousness and corporeality? To answer ‘yes’ to M’s question - to be is as much as being seen –– is to render the body not utterly useless, but periphery, or secondary, merely the flesh of perception. Beckett famously remarked that, in his increasing sense of minimalism, in his desire to ‘say the least necessary’, his final work would be a blank piece of paper. In Beckett, does the body suffer the same fate as language? To repeat the refrain, am I as much as being seen? If so, I need to present you (someone) with something to be <b>seen</b> – skin, <b>torso,</b> muscle, a boundaried mass of flesh. So, yes; the body is required. But perhaps not as much as the perception of the seer. And if a disconnect between seer and seen is possible – and there is no doubt, at least in a Beckettian world, that it is not only possible, but is the hallmark of the human condition – and the presence of the seen is dependant on the seer, then we have no choice but to be suspicious, or questioning of our very existence. Am I as much as being seen? Yes, and so, I disappear when you don’t see me. But I cannot not be seen, particularly in a world where vision is everywhere, not least because the “I” is always simultaneously an embodied seer. It is this circular phenomenon, this duality of absence and presence – which works itself out in corporeal terms in different but closely related ways on stage and on screen – that we tackle here. In the first section, we trace the role of different bodies in Beckett’s stage work, arguing that these bodies, especially as mediated by a fractured and incohesive sense of Time, actively ‘presence’ an absence (and, inevitably, absent a presence). In the second section, we argue that in Beckett’s Film, the dilemma of embodied consciousness and what is an anguished flight from being seen and seeing oneself is played out in terms of the complex star/celebrity signification of both Buster Keaton and Samuel Beckett. Star and phenomenological theory closely align in this respect, both discourses reliant on a tense, seemingly paradoxical absent/present union. The present article is an attempt to trace and, in some ways, explain this phenomenon of duality, this paradox between being there and not being there.. Our approach is largely phenomenological, drawing on the ideas of Bert O. States, Merleau-Ponty, and Vivian Sobchack to enrich our analysis. At the same time, we conjoin that approach with a cultural awareness of the living body in postmodern times. In the end, we offer the argument that the unique duality of presence and absence that is produced through the human body in Beckett’s stage works finds a corollary, and perhaps purer, realisation in the body of Film...|$|R
