5|$|Blackleg is a {{fungal disease}} of canola {{that results in}} major yield loss in {{affected}} crops. It overwinters on infected <b>stubble</b> (leftover crop residue) that is left on farm fields, and can continue to produce spores, infecting future crops, until the <b>stubble</b> is buried or broken down completely. The observation that C.olla grows and fruits on canola <b>stubble</b> has led to research on the potential of this fungus to degrade canola <b>stubble,</b> and {{reduce the incidence of}} stubble-borne diseases like blackleg and blackspot. In a study of its lignin-degrading abilities, C.olla was shown to colonize canola, wheat, and barley residue, but appeared to have a preference for the woody taproots of canola as compared to the cereal residue.|$|E
5|$|Cyathus olla {{has been}} {{investigated}} {{for its ability to}} accelerate the decomposition of <b>stubble</b> left in the field after harvest, effectively reducing pathogen populations and accelerating nutrient cycling through mineralization of essential plant nutrients.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{establishment}} of the Motul Ecological Park, the site was used for agriculture, specifically the cultivation of maize. The site has been damaged several times by wildfires caused by uncontrolled <b>stubble</b> burning in 1986, 1987 and again in 1998. This last fire badly damaged the stelae in the site core.|$|E
40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effect of different tillage implements and rice <b>stubbles</b> as residue on the yield of wheat in saline-sodic soil. Rotavator proved the best among all the tillage implements producing maximum germination counts (35. 5 m- 2 ). no. of tillers (289. 49 m- 2 ); 1000 grains wt. (45. 52 g), grain yield (3. 409 t ha- 1 ) and straw yield (3. 42 t ha- 1 ). Rice <b>stubbles</b> had better residual effect giving significantly higher values of these parameters than the rice <b>stubbles</b> removed from field before sowing the wheat crop. Incorporation of rice <b>stubbles</b> into soil proved also beneficial in improving health of saline-sodic soil...|$|R
40|$|Studies of {{the effect}} of the run-off of acidic mine waste from Wheal Jane tin mine after its closure in 1992 was carried out by <b>Stubbles</b> (1999) using benthonic foraminifera. Her results {{indicate}} an anthropenically driven impact on the benthonic assemblage mainly caused by the Wheal Jane incidence. Low diversity, high frequency of deformity and mono-dominance of species was recorded. This research re-evaluates the Restronguet Creek and the impact of the Wheal Jane incidence on the environment. Field sampling and laboratory methods were carried out in accordance with methods used by <b>Stubbles</b> (1999) for consistency and continuity. Samplmg stations used are also the same as <b>Stubbles</b> (1999). Diversity remams low with indigenous species, Elphidium williamsoni, Haynesina germanica and Ammonia beccarii. Haynesina germanica still dominates most of the stations in all the sampling seasons. There has been an increase in the population density of benthonic assemblage with a more even distribution with the indigenous species. Deformity has been reduced compared to that recorded by <b>Stubbles</b> (1999). Abiotic factors such as clunatic conditions (temperature, rainfall) and pH levels remain fairly constant with <b>Stubbles</b> (1999). However, there is an increase in sediment metal concentration and a decrease m acidity and metal concentration of the water readings of Restronguet Creek compared to <b>Stubbles</b> (1999). Overall, the results show that altiiough the Wheal Jane incidence {{had an impact on the}} environment, the background records (historical mining activities) still affect the diversity, dominance and ecology of the Restronguet Creek...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the winter habitat {{use by the}} European hare (Lepus europaeus) at the macro-habitat level in a farmland area of southern Tuscany during feeding activity using spot-light counts. Olive tree groves, cereal <b>stubbles</b> and winter cereals were used more than their availability, whereas ploughed fields, alfalfa and fallow fields were used less than their availability. Olive tree groves were the most used, followed by cereal <b>stubbles.</b> Since approximately 50 % of over-wintering cereal <b>stubbles</b> {{were the result of}} economic agreements between the hunting district and local farmers, the study confirms the importance of this kind of agro-environmental measure for hare conservation.

5|$|The poem {{has three}} eleven-line stanzas which {{describe}} a progression through the season, {{from the late}} maturation of the crops to the harvest and to {{the last days of}} autumn when winter is nearing. The imagery is richly achieved through the personification of Autumn, and the description of its bounty, its sights and sounds. It has parallels in the work of English landscape artists, with Keats himself describing the fields of <b>stubble</b> that he saw on his walk as being like that in a painting.|$|E
5|$|Francis has {{individualized}} features, to {{the point}} that the attention to his face gives it the quality of a portrait such as van Eyck's c. 1431 Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati. The head and face are minutely detailed. Francis is in his mid-thirties, wears <b>stubble</b> and has a somewhat jowly face and receding hairline. He is presented as a highly intelligent but perhaps detached and impassive individual. He is given a complex and inscrutable expression; physiological traits not uncommon in contemporary Flemish painting. He kneels on a bed of flowers, and his heavy robe and folded drapery have a choppy and overflowing feel. His lower limbs seem disconnected, positioned in an anti-naturalistic manner; giving the impression that he is levitating.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} study the effect of flaming on seed {{viability}} of Sinapis arvensis L., changes in microorganisms population and physicochemical characteristics of soil after canola (Brassica napus L.) harvesting, an experiment was carried out based on randomized complete block design with four replications and eight treatments at Karaj Research Center, Iran, during 2005 - 2006. After harvesting canola {{at the end of}} spring, wild mustard seeds were distributed evenly {{on the surface of the}} soil. In some plots, canola <b>stubbles</b> were left on the ground and in some plots canola <b>stubbles</b> were taken off. Under this condition, the following treatments were applied: Flaming under wet and dry soil condition, burning <b>stubbles</b> under wet and dry soil condition. In other plots canola <b>stubbles</b> were taken off the plots and then flaming was applied under wet and dry soil conditions. Check plots did not receive any treatment. Results indicated that all treatments reduced seed viability, and the highest loss in seedling density occurred in the flaming treatment on dry-soil. Flaming did not have any serious affect on soil microorganisms or on its other physiochemical aspects, however dry-soil treatments proved the safest...|$|R
40|$|Mineralization is {{the main}} {{mechanism}} of dissipation of glyphosate herbicide (N-[phosphonomethyl] glycine) in soil. However, there is scarce information about the mineralization process in strata formed by <b>stubbles</b> in no-tillage systems. The kinetics and rate of mineralization of herbicide in <b>stubbles</b> of soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) and corn (Zea mays L.) were investigated. To evaluate the effect of age of crop residues, samples of soybean <b>stubbles</b> were collected immediately after harvest (Soja 1) and four months after harvest (Soja 2). Corn crop residues were collected three months after harvest. Glyphosate evolution and total microbial activity (TMA) were monitored by release of 14 C-CO 2 and C-CO 2 under laboratory conditions with two temperatures, 15 and 28 ºC. Crop residues size was evaluated using grinding (1 mm) and cut (1 to 2 cm) <b>stubbles.</b> Results showed that glyphosate mineralization was affected by the incubation temperature and the origin and age of crop residues. Size of crop residues did not modify glyphosate mineralization. Average glyphosate mineralization after 56 days of incubation at 15 and 28 ºC was of 3. 9 and 9. 9 %, respectively, of the 14 C-glyphosate initially applied. In corn crop residues the percentages were 2. 0 and 3. 0 %, respectively, at 15 and 28 ºC. A similar evolution was detected for TMA. The co-metabolic nature of glyphosate mineralization was corroborated. An inverse relation between C/N ratio and glyphosate mineralization was detected. Higher glyphosate mineralization was detected in fresh soybean <b>stubbles,</b> suggesting that applications on aged crop residues could increase the persistence of glyphosate in notillage systems...|$|R
5|$|However, {{according}} to several authors, most of these gains have been lost, especially due to <b>stubble</b> burning, {{a rise in the}} market share of diesel cars and a considerable decline in bus ridership. According to CSE and System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), burning of agricultural waste in nearby Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh regions results in severe intensification of smog over Delhi. The state government of Uttar Pradesh is considering imposing a ban on crop burning to reduce pollution in Delhi NCR and an environmental panel has appealed to India's Supreme Court to impose a 30% cess on diesel cars.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{tree sparrow}} is {{widespread}} in the towns and cities of eastern Asia, but in Europe it is a bird of lightly wooded open countryside, with the house sparrow breeding in the more urban areas. The Eurasian tree sparrow's extensive range and large population ensure {{that it is not}} endangered globally, but there have been large declines in western European populations, in part due to changes in farming practices involving increased use of herbicides and loss of winter <b>stubble</b> fields. In eastern Asia and western Australia, this species is sometimes viewed as a pest, although it is also widely celebrated in oriental art.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight of}} the {{fieldfare}} is slow and direct. It takes several strong beats then closes its wings briefly before flapping on. It is highly gregarious, quite shy and easily scared {{in the winter and}} bold and noisy in the breeding season. When a group is in a tree they all tend to face in the same direction, keeping up a constant chatter. When foraging on the ground, often in association with redwings, the group works its way up wind, each bird pausing every so often to stand erect and gaze around before resuming feeding. When alarmed they fly off down wind and the feeding group reforms elsewhere. In woodland they do not skulk in the undergrowth as do blackbirds or song thrushes, instead they perch in the open on bushes and high branches. They roost socially, sometimes in overgrown hedges and shrubberies but usually on the ground. Common sites are in rough grass among bushes or clumps of rushes, in young plantations, on <b>stubble</b> and in the furrows of ploughed fields.|$|E
40|$|The present work {{regarding}} the overwintering population of maize stem borer Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) at larval stage {{was conducted in}} order to determine degree of overwintering population and the level of infestation of this pest at different localities of Azad Kashmir. Off 1796 <b>stubbles</b> of maize, present findings showed that over all high population of C. partellus (29. 1 %) larvae was recorded from locality Chota Gala while the lower (18. 73 %) was from Rawalakot locality. Whereas greater population (27. 77 %) of overwintering was found on the <b>stubbles</b> of maize genotype “Kashmir Gold” than “Sarhad White” (20. 75 %). A significant difference in overwintering population was found among all the studied localities. The percentage of infestation (on the basis of exit hole on <b>stubbles)</b> caused by C. partellus was significantly (P< 0. 001) high (27. 77 %) on “Kashmir Gold” than on the “Sarhad White” (15. 99 %) in all the studied areas. No clear relationship was found between the stem thickness and the overwintering population of maize stem borer or its infestation...|$|R

5|$|Although {{the tree}} sparrow has been {{expanding}} its range in Fennoscandia and eastern Europe, populations have been declining {{in much of}} western Europe, a trend reflected in other farmland birds such as the skylark, corn bunting and northern lapwing. From 1980 to 2003, common farmland bird numbers fell by 28%. The collapse in populations {{seems to have been}} particularly severe in Great Britain, where there was a 95% decline between 1970 and 1998, and Ireland, which had only 1,000–1,500 pairs in the late 1990s. In the British Isles, such declines may be due to natural fluctuations, to which tree sparrows are known to be prone. Breeding performance has improved substantially as population sizes have decreased, suggesting that decreases in productivity were not responsible for the decline and that survival was the critical factor. The large decline in tree sparrow numbers is probably the result of agricultural intensification and specialisation, particularly the increased use of herbicides and a trend towards autumn-sown crops (at the expense of spring-sown crops that produce <b>stubble</b> fields in winter). The change from mixed to specialised farming and the increased use of insecticides has reduced the amount of insect food available for nestlings.|$|E
5|$|Termites can {{be major}} {{agricultural}} pests, particularly in East Africa and North Asia, where crop losses can be severe (3–100% in crop loss in Africa). Counterbalancing {{this is the}} greatly improved water infiltration where termite tunnels in the soil allow rainwater to soak in deeply, which helps reduce runoff and consequent soil erosion through bioturbation. In South America, cultivated plants such as eucalyptus, upland rice and sugarcane can be severely damaged by termite infestations, with attacks on leaves, roots and woody tissue. Termites can also attack other plants, including cassava, coffee, cotton, fruit trees, maize, peanuts, soybeans and vegetables. Mounds can disrupt farming activities, {{making it difficult for}} farmers to operate farming machinery; however, despite farmers' dislike of the mounds, it is often the case that no net loss of production occurs. Termites can be beneficial to agriculture, such as by boosting crop yields and enriching the soil. Termites and ants can re-colonise untilled land that contains crop <b>stubble,</b> which colonies use for nourishment when they establish their nests. The presence of nests in fields enables larger amounts of rainwater to soak into the ground and increases the amount of nitrogen in the soil, both essential for the growth of crops.|$|E
