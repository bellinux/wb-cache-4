500|$|Miller's {{statistics}} are an inexact measure of his worth to the side. Many of the Australia teams {{he played in}} featured very strong batting line-ups, restricting his opportunities as a middle-order player. His verve and enthusiasm were also important contributors to Australian success, as was his ability to produce the unexpected (particularly with the ball) and help break partnerships. It {{is for this reason}} that he is remembered for his personality and his one-off feats, more than statistical accomplishment; in Ian Chappell's words [...] "People who saw it <b>still</b> <b>talk</b> of Keith Miller's monster shot that hit the Members Stand clock at the SCG in the 1950s".|$|E

After killing a police officer and a civilian, Rector shot himself in the head, leading to what his lawyers said was a state where he could <b>still</b> <b>talk</b> but did not understand the idea of death. According to both Arkansas state law and Federal law, a seriously mentally impaired inmate cannot be executed. The courts disagreed with the allegation of grave mental impairment and allowed the execution.

2500|$|Goblins are reptilian fairies, often {{described}} as upright, raptor like creatures (minus the claws and feathers). They are quite stupid as they have brains the size of rats, but they can <b>still</b> <b>talk</b> and (to a certain extent) work machinery like lasers and sometimes even computers. They {{have the ability to}} create fireballs in their hands, or shoot them through their nostrils (sometimes by inhaling fireballs created in their own hands). Groups of goblins are involved in an ongoing turf war with groups of dwarves. They make their clothing from their own shed skin. In Book 3, Holly describes goblins as [...] "Evolution's little joke", with the reasoning, [...] "pick the dumbest creatures on the planet, and give them the ability to conjure fire". Notable goblins include General Scalene who was killed along with Julius Root in book 4, also a general in the goblin revolution and public enemy No.2 [...] (after Opal Koboi). [...] Also there are Generals Sputa and Phlebum, leaders of the triad, and captain (now lieutenant after killing D'Nall and Aymon) [...] Nyle, a young, cocky goblin captain also enlisted in the goblin revolution. Another notable goblin is Lieutenant Poll. He was the leader of the goblin hit squad who nearly killed Root and Butler in book 2. After straying too close to an avalanche to inspect the [...] "bodies" [...] of Butler and Root, a one-ton pane of ice put [...] "some big hole in Lieutenant Poll. I could see right through 'im.

2500|$|Nevertheless, Makdisi has {{asserted}} that the European university borrowed many of its features from the Islamic madrasa, including the concepts of a degree and doctorate. Makdisi and Hugh Goddard have also highlighted other terms and concepts now used in modern universities which most likely have Islamic origins, including [...] "the fact that we <b>still</b> <b>talk</b> of professors holding the 'chairman' of their subject" [...] being based on the [...] "traditional Islamic pattern of teaching where the professor sits on a chair and the students sit around him", the term 'academic circles' being derived from {{the way in which}} Islamic students [...] "sat in a circle around their professor", and terms such as [...] "having 'fellows', 'reading' a subject, and obtaining 'degrees', can all be traced back" [...] to the Islamic concepts of [...] ('companions, as of Muhammad'), [...] ('reading aloud the Qur'an') and [...] ('licence ') respectively. Makdisi has listed eighteen such parallels in terminology which {{can be traced back to}} their roots in Islamic education. Some of the practices now common in modern universities which Makdisi and Goddard trace back to an Islamic root include [...] "practices such as delivering inaugural lectures, wearing academic robes, obtaining doctorates by defending a thesis, and even the idea of academic freedom are also modelled on Islamic custom." [...] The Islamic scholarly system of [...] and , meaning opinion and consensus respectively, formed the basis of the [...] "scholarly system the West has practised in university scholarship from the Middle Ages down to the present day." [...] According to Makdisi and Goddard, [...] "the idea of academic freedom" [...] in universities was also [...] "modelled on Islamic custom" [...] as practised in the medieval Madrasa system from the 9th century. Islamic influence was [...] "certainly discernible in the foundation of the first deliberately planned university" [...] in Europe, the University of Naples Federico II founded by Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor in 1224.|$|E
