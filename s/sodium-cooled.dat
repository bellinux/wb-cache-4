25|$|All {{operating}} plants {{today are}} PWRs. The <b>sodium-cooled</b> {{fast breeder reactor}} technology development reactors, Phénix and Superphénix, have been shut down with work ongoing for a more advanced replacement {{in the form of}} the ASTRID (reactor).|$|E
25|$|Sodium-bonded fuel {{consists}} of fuel that has liquid sodium {{in the gap}} between the fuel slug (or pellet) and the cladding. This fuel type is often used for <b>sodium-cooled</b> liquid metal fast reactors. It has been used in EBR-I, EBR-II, and the FFTF. The fuel slug may be metallic or ceramic. The sodium bonding is used to reduce the temperature of the fuel.|$|E
25|$|A {{specific}} {{risk of the}} <b>sodium-cooled</b> fast reactor is related to using metallic sodium as a coolant. In case of a breach, sodium explosively reacts with water. Fixing breaches may also prove dangerous, as the cheapest noble gas argon {{is also used to}} prevent sodium oxidation. Argon, like helium, can displace oxygen in the air and can pose hypoxia concerns, so workers may be exposed to this additional risk. This is a pertinent problem as demonstrated by the events at the loop type Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor Monju at Tsuruga, Japan.|$|E
25|$|TRW {{originated}} in 1901 with the Cleveland Cap Screw Company, founded by David Kurtz {{and four other}} Cleveland residents. Their initial products were bolts with heads electrically welded to the shafts. In 1904, a welder named Charles E. Thompson adapted their process to making automobile engine valves, and, by 1915, the company was the largest valve producer in the United States. Charles Thompson was named {{general manager of the}} company, which became Thompson Products in 1926. Their experimental hollow <b>sodium-cooled</b> valves aided Charles Lindbergh's solo flight across the Atlantic.|$|E
