5|$|Recently an {{alternative}} proteasome was identified in human cells that lack the α3 core <b>subunit.</b> These proteasomes (known as the α4-α4 proteasomes) instead form 20S core particles containing an additional α4 <b>subunit</b> {{in place of}} the missing α3 <b>subunit.</b> Interestingly, these alternative 'α4-α4' proteasomes have been known previously to exist in yeast. Although the precise function of these proteasome isoforms is still largely unknown, cells expressing these proteasomes show enhanced resistance to toxicity induced by metallic ions such as cadmium.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{the crystal}} {{structure}} of linezolid {{bound to the}} 50S <b>subunit</b> of a ribosome from the archaean Haloarcula marismortui was elucidated {{by a team of}} scientists from Yale University and deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Another team in 2008 determined the structure of linezolid bound to a 50S <b>subunit</b> of Deinococcus radiodurans. The authors proposed a refined model for the mechanism of action of oxazolidinones, finding that linezolid occupies the A site of the 50S ribosomal <b>subunit,</b> inducing a conformational change that prevents tRNA from entering the site and ultimately forcing tRNA to separate from the ribosome.|$|E
5|$|In a {{molecular}} {{study of the}} large <b>subunit</b> ribosomal DNA sequences of mycorrhizal fungi of the orchid Gastrodia confusa, M.inclinata {{was found to be}} closely related to M.aurantiomarginata, M.crocata, and M.leaiana.|$|E
40|$|Heterogeneity {{among the}} free small ribosomal <b>subunits</b> of rat liver was studied. Newly made free small <b>subunits</b> {{differ from the}} bulk of the free <b>subunits</b> in the {{following}} ways. (1) The newly made free small <b>subunits</b> sediment slightly faster than most free small <b>subunits</b> and form a band at slightly lower densities. (2) Mature free small <b>subunits,</b> prepared under conditions which minimize the amount of loosely bound protein, readily dimerize in solutions of low ionic strength. Little dimerization is found with newly formed <b>subunits.</b> This permits the separation of fractions enriched in newly formed <b>subunits.</b> (3) The fraction enriched in newly formed <b>subunits</b> contains a distinctive additional protein as compared the most of the free small <b>subunits...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{assembly and}} function of nicotinic acetylcho-line receptors (nAChRs) composed of 7 and 2 <b>subunits.</b> We measured optical and electrophysiological properties of wild-type and mutant <b>subunits</b> expressed in cell lines and Xenopus laevis oocytes. Laser scanning confocal microscopy indicated that fluorescently tagged 7 and 2 <b>subunits</b> colocalize. Förster resonance energy transfer between fluorescently tagged sub-units strongly suggested that 7 and 2 <b>subunits</b> coassemble. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy revealed that assemblies localized to filopodia-like processes of SH-EP 1 cells. Gain-of-function 7 and 2 <b>subunits</b> confirmed that these <b>subunits</b> coassemble within functional receptors. Moreover, 72 nAChRs composed of wild-type <b>subunits</b> or fluorescently tagged <b>subunits</b> had pharmacological properties similar t...|$|R
50|$|The NMDA {{receptor}} forms a heterotetramer {{between two}} GluN1 and two GluN2 <b>subunits</b> (the <b>subunits</b> were previously denoted as NR1 and NR2), two obligatory NR1 <b>subunits</b> and two regionally localized NR2 <b>subunits.</b> A related gene family of NR3 A and B <b>subunits</b> have an inhibitory effect on receptor activity. Multiple receptor isoforms with distinct brain distributions and functional properties arise by selective splicing of the NR1 transcripts and differential {{expression of the}} NR2 <b>subunits.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{eukaryotic}} organisms, pre-mRNA is transcribed in the nucleus, introns are spliced out, {{then the}} mature mRNA is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The small <b>subunit</b> of the ribosome usually starts by binding to {{one end of}} the mRNA and is joined there by various other eukaryotic initiation factors, forming the initiation complex. The initiation complex scans along the mRNA strand until it reaches a start codon, and then the large <b>subunit</b> of the ribosome attaches to the small <b>subunit</b> and translation of a protein begins. This entire process is referred to as gene expression; it is the process by which the information in a gene, encoded as a sequence of bases in DNA, is converted into the structure of a protein. A Morpholino can modify splicing or block translation, depending on the Morpholino's base sequence.|$|E
5|$|The {{proteasome}} subcomponents {{are often}} referred to by their Svedberg sedimentation coefficient (denoted S). The proteasome most exclusively used in mammals is the cytosolic 26S proteasome, which is about 2000 kilodaltons (kDa) in molecular mass containing one 20S protein <b>subunit</b> and two 19S regulatory cap subunits. The core is hollow and provides an enclosed cavity in which proteins are degraded; openings at the two ends of the core allow the target protein to enter. Each end of the core particle associates with a 19S regulatory <b>subunit</b> that contains multiple ATPase active sites and ubiquitin binding sites; it is this structure that recognizes polyubiquitinated proteins and transfers them to the catalytic core. An alternative form of regulatory <b>subunit</b> called the 11S particle can associate with the core in essentially {{the same manner as}} the 19S particle; the 11S {{may play a role in}} degradation of foreign peptides such as those produced after infection by a virus.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the genus}} Amanita, A.gemmata is {{classified}} in subgenus Amanita, section Amanita, subsection Gemmatae, and series Gemmatae. Tulloss places the species in a stirps (an informal ranking above species level) with A.russuloides and A.viscidolutea. Some mycologists believe that A.gemmata is not different from A.russuloides. Two molecular studies based on sequences {{of the large}} ribosomal <b>subunit</b> RNA gene (nLSU-rDNA) and the mitochondrial small ribosomal <b>subunit</b> RNA gene (mtSSU-rDNA) show that A.gemmata {{is part of a}} clade within Amanita with its close relatives A.muscaria, A.farinosa and A.roseitincta.|$|E
50|$|A heterotetramer is protein {{containing}} four non-covalently bound <b>subunits,</b> {{wherein the}} <b>subunits</b> {{are not all}} identical. A homotetramer contains four identical <b>subunits.</b>|$|R
50|$|A tetramer is {{a protein}} with a {{quaternary}} structure of four <b>subunits</b> (tetrameric). Homotetramers have four identical <b>subunits</b> (such as glutathione S-transferase), dimers of dimers contain two heterodimer <b>subunits</b> (such as hemoglobin), and heterotetramers are complexes of four different <b>subunits.</b>|$|R
40|$|Active 30 S and 50 S ribosomal <b>subunits</b> were {{isolated}} from Bacillus subtilis. These <b>subunits</b> {{were able to}} perform not only protein synthesis {{in the presence of}} artificial or natural messenger ribonucleic acid but also the specific functions characteristic of each of the <b>subunits.</b> Thus the 30 S <b>subunits</b> alone are able to bind formyl-methionyl-transfer ribonucleic acid, and the 50 S <b>subunits</b> carry the peptidyl transferase activity...|$|R
5|$|As protons {{cross the}} {{membrane}} through the channel {{in the base}} of ATP synthase, the FO proton-driven motor rotates. Rotation might be caused by changes in the ionization of amino acids in the ring of c subunits causing electrostatic interactions that propel the ring of c subunits past the proton channel. This rotating ring in turn drives the rotation of the central axle (the γ <b>subunit</b> stalk) within the α and β subunits. The α and β subunits are prevented from rotating themselves by the side-arm, which acts as a stator. This movement of the tip of the γ <b>subunit</b> within the ball of α and β subunits provides the energy for the active sites in the β subunits to undergo a cycle of movements that produces and then releases ATP.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{molecular}} {{analysis of}} the sequences of the D1/D2 regions of the large <b>subunit</b> ribosomal RNA gene and the internal transcribed spacer regions of rRNA, T.mesenterica is most closely related to T.coalescens, T.tropica, and T.brasiliensis. This analysis included 20 of the estimated 120 Tremella species.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin has a {{primarily}} bacteriostatic effect. It is {{a bacterial}} protein synthesis inhibitor by inhibiting ribosomal translocation, {{in a similar}} way to macrolides. It does so by binding to the 50S rRNA of the large bacterial ribosome <b>subunit,</b> overlapping with the binding sites of the oxazolidinone, pleuromutilin, and macrolide antibiotics, among others.|$|E
50|$|The MoFe {{protein is}} a heterotetramer {{consisting}} of two &alpha; <b>subunits</b> and two &beta; <b>subunits,</b> weighing approximately 240-250kDa. The MoFe protein also contains two iron-sulfur clusters, known as P-clusters, located at the interface between the &alpha; and &beta; <b>subunits</b> and two FeMo cofactors, within the &alpha; <b>subunits.</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe large {{membrane}} protein complexes of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation {{are composed of}} central <b>subunits</b> that are essential for their bioenergetic core function and accessory <b>subunits</b> that may assist in regulation, assembly or stabilization. Although sequence conservation is low, {{a significant proportion of}} the accessory <b>subunits</b> is characterized by a common single transmembrane (STMD) topology. The STMD signature is also found in <b>subunits</b> of other {{membrane protein}} complexes. We hypothesize that the general function of STMD <b>subunits</b> is to organize the hydrophobic <b>subunits</b> of large membrane protein complexes in specialized environments like the inner mitochondrial membrane...|$|R
2500|$|Quaternary {{structure}} is the three-dimensional structure {{consisting of the}} aggregation {{of two or more}} individual polypeptide chains (<b>subunits)</b> that operate as a single functional unit. In this context, the quaternary {{structure is}} stabilized by the same non-covalent interactions and disulfide bonds as the tertiary structure. Complexes of two or more polypeptides (i.e. multiple <b>subunits)</b> are called multimers. Specifically it would be called a dimer if it contains two <b>subunits,</b> a trimer if it contains three <b>subunits,</b> a tetramer if it contains four <b>subunits,</b> and a pentamer if it contains five <b>subunits.</b> The <b>subunits</b> are frequently related to one another by symmetry operations, such as a 2-fold axis in a dimer. Multimers made up of identical <b>subunits</b> are referred to with a prefix of [...] "homo-" [...] (e.g. a homotetramer) and those made up of different <b>subunits</b> are referred to with a prefix of [...] "hetero-", for example, a heterotetramer, such as the two alpha and two beta chains of hemoglobin.|$|R
5|$|In addition, {{there are}} two other isoforms of the {{catalytic}} <b>subunit</b> of PKA called Cβ and Cγ arising from different genes but have similar functions as Cα. Cβ is found abundantly in the brain and in lower levels in other tissues, while Cγ is most likely expressed in the testis.|$|E
5|$|Reduced {{function}} of NMDA receptors {{play a role}} in schizophrenia. This diminished {{function of}} NMDA receptor may be correlated with the reduced expression of the NMDA receptor 2B <b>subunit</b> (NR2b), which has also been linked to schizophrenia. TBR1, in complex with the protein, CINAP, is responsible for regulating transcription of the NR2b gene. It was hypothesized in one 2010 study that reduced TBR1 and CINAP expression may be responsible for the reduced expression of the NR2b <b>subunit</b> observed in brains of postmortem schizophrenics. However, TBR1 and CINAP expression were not significantly reduced in the postmortem brains, suggesting that synthesis and processing of NR2b via TBR1 is not responsible for reduced NR2b expression in schizophrenics.|$|E
5|$|The BCG vaccine has limitations, and {{research}} {{to develop new}} TB vaccines is ongoing. A number of potential candidates are currently in phase I and II clinical trials. Two main approaches {{are being used to}} attempt to improve the efficacy of available vaccines. One approach involves adding a <b>subunit</b> vaccine to BCG, while the other strategy is attempting to create new and better live vaccines. MVA85A, an example of a <b>subunit</b> vaccine, currently in trials in South Africa, is based on a genetically modified vaccinia virus. Vaccines are hoped to {{play a significant role in}} treatment of both latent and active disease.|$|E
50|$|Hemes and cofactors are {{inserted}} into <b>subunits</b> I & II. <b>Subunits</b> I and IV initiate assembly. Different <b>subunits</b> may associate to form sub-complex intermediates that later bind to other <b>subunits</b> {{to form the}} COX complex. In post-assembly modifications, COX will form a homodimer. This is required for activity. Both dimers are connected by a cardiolipin molecule, which {{has been found to}} {{play a key role in}} stabilization of the holoenzyme complex. The dissociation of <b>subunits</b> VIIa and III in conjunction with the removal of cardiolipin results in total loss of enzyme activity. <b>Subunits</b> encoded in the nuclear genome are known to play a role in enzyme dimerization and stability. Mutations to these <b>subunits</b> eliminate COX function.|$|R
5|$|Sequence {{analysis}} {{suggests that the}} catalytic β <b>subunits</b> diverged earlier in evolution than the predominantly structural α <b>subunits.</b> In bacteria that express a 20S proteasome, the β <b>subunits</b> have high sequence identity to archaeal and eukaryotic β <b>subunits,</b> whereas the α sequence identity is much lower. The presence of 20S proteasomes in bacteria may result from lateral gene transfer, while the diversification of <b>subunits</b> among eukaryotes is ascribed to multiple gene duplication events.|$|R
50|$|The yeast V-ATPase is {{the best}} characterized. There are at least 13 <b>subunits</b> {{identified}} to form a functional V-ATPase complex, which consists of two domains.

40|$|AbstractHeterotrimeric G {{proteins}} were purified from bovine brain by {{immunoaffinity chromatography}} on immobilized anti G protein monoclonal antibody 3 C 2. Release of βγ <b>subunits</b> was effectuated by exposure of immobilized trimeric G proteins to MgAlF 4. The resultant βγ <b>subunits</b> were pure and biologically active. Following immunization of mice with purified βγ <b>subunits</b> we obtained monoclonal anti β antibodies showing broad species cross-reactivity. Characterization of the epitope recognized by one such monoclonal antibody, ARC 9, indicated {{involvement of the}} extreme COOH-terminus, as assessed by its reactivity on β <b>subunits</b> lacking the COOH-terminal 15 residues, obtained by in vitro translation.
