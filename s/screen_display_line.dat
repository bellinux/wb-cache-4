40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{studied the}} comparison of two successive vertical lines presented {{in the middle of}} a <b>display</b> <b>screen.</b> <b>Line</b> lengths were barely discriminable. The first experiment showed that the absolute value of time errors decreased as line length discriminability increased. Time errors depended on the length of the second comparison line. The second experiment showed that the important length was this one relative to the range of comparison line lengths rather than relative to the size of the <b>display</b> <b>screen...</b>|$|R

The E-Ball concept PC, a sphere-shaped computer avowal to deliver the smallest physical design among all the hitherto extant laptops and desktops. This work of genius consists all the features pertaining to conventional computer elements like keyboard, mouse, DVD, large <b>screen</b> <b>display</b> but the <b>line</b> of attack incorporated by E-ball technology PC for integrating these elements is impeccable which outweighs the services offered by traditional systems. E-Ball PC magnanimously boasts a petite 6 inch diameter sphere and a seamless 120 × 120 mm motherboard. E-Ball is premeditated to be positioned on two stands, which open simultaneously using buttons located on each side. After opening the stand and switching on the PC, a detachable optical mouse and laser keyboard can be activated and put into use to experience this flummoxing technical revolution which has revolutionized the landscape of Personal Computers.

40|$|Abstract- Large <b>screen</b> <b>display</b> {{systems are}} common display systems. Especially projector-based PC cluster large <b>screen</b> <b>display</b> systems share most of large <b>screen</b> <b>display</b> system market {{and they are}} main {{research}} topics today. A lot of researchers research on cluster algorithms, computation power improvements, high performance graphic rendering technologies, high speed buses, networks, and HCIs. Remarkable research results are being published by technical leading groups. Whereas, following groups who want research on large <b>screen</b> <b>display</b> have difficulties even to build a test system. Hens {{there are not enough}} information to build large <b>screen</b> <b>display</b> systems. In this paper, we survey on projectorbased PC cluster large <b>screen</b> <b>display</b> technologies that use distributed rendering. Also, this paper shows basic implementation technologies for building projector-based PC cluster large <b>screen</b> <b>display</b> systems...|$|R
