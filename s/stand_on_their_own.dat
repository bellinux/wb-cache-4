5|$|Further {{inspiration}} for the album came from Madonna's exploration of other cultures and art, literature, and music, referencing them in the songs. She believed that the tracks should <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own,</b> so that one could sing them accompanied with just a guitar. Madonna {{enlisted the help of}} her daughter Lourdes and son Rocco, calling them her A advisers. They visited night clubs and were able to provide her with news about up-and-coming music and artists, helping to create the sounds she gravitated towards for the album.|$|E
5|$|Gestation is {{typically}} six months long, after which a single calf is born. Newborn are a light yellow; infant males {{may have a}} black patch {{on the head and}} the neck. Young are precocial - they can <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> soon after birth. Females can mate again after a month of parturition. Juveniles remain active and playful throughout the day. Juvenile males turn black gradually, darkening notably after the third year. The lifespan {{is typically}} 10 to 15 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{music and}} {{instruments}} in each level {{were chosen to}} correspond to the game world and the level's placement in the overall emotional arc. The music is composed of multiple layers of acoustic instrument tracks that rise and fall in correlation with the player's actions. The instruments used include pianos, string instruments such as classical guitars, and woodwinds such as bass flutes and bassoons. The number of instruments playing increases in correlation {{with the amount of}} petals that the player gathers. The music is meant to suggest natural sounds like wind. The instrument tracks were intended to be able to <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own,</b> even when used in a large orchestrated group as in levels three and six. Several times in the development process, Diamante became so attached to a piece of music that needed alteration that he composed a new piece to replace it. Diamante was long in talks with Sony to produce an album of music from the game. On April 8, 2010 a soundtrack album was released by Sony for purchase on the PlayStation Network. The album, titled Flower: Original Soundtrack from the Video Game, contains 8 tracks with a total duration of 1:04:37.|$|E

5|$|F. emasculata and Pinck Pharmaceuticals are fictitious, but {{pharmaceutical}} companies do send scientists {{all over the}} world looking for plants and animals that could have medicinal use. The appearance of The Smoking Man in a stand-alone episode is unusual, as Chris Carter did not like mixing the mythology and stand-alone episodes. Initially, the producers were wary of releasing the episode so close to the release of the similarly-themed movie Outbreak.

5000|$|By May 24, 2012, the [...] "Casseroles" [...] {{series of}} nightly protests had rapidly {{expanded}} to most Montreal residential neighborhoods {{outside of the}} usual protest routes. These protests, in which people <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> balconies banging pots and pans, emerged {{as a way of}} subverting the ban on unannounced street protests. Inspired by the cacerolazos of Chile in 1971, these involved residents banging on pots and pans from their windows or taking to the streets with their kitchenware at 8 o'clock. A viral amateur video of one such protest in the Plateau Mont-Royal neighborhood further fueled this phenomenon.|$|R

25|$|Most rattans {{differ from}} other palms in having slender stems, 2â€“5cm diameter, with long internodes between the leaves; also, {{they are not}} trees but are vine-like lianas, {{scrambling}} through and over other vegetation. Rattans are also superficially similar to bamboo. Unlike bamboo, rattan stems ("malacca") are solid, and most species need structural support and cannot <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own.</b> Many rattans have spines which act as hooks to aid climbing over other plants, and to deter herbivores. Rattans {{have been known to}} grow up to hundreds of metres long. Most (70%) of the world's rattan population exist in Indonesia, distributed among the islands Borneo, Sulawesi, and Sumbawa. The rest of the world's supply comes from the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and Bangladesh.|$|E
50|$|As {{the time}} and cost needed to develop a {{commercial}} role-playing game are rarely matched by the profits made from selling the end product, the rulesbooks are primarily sold to create a market {{for the sale of}} related products. TSR found a lucrative market when they released a series spinoff novels based on the Dragonlance and Dark Sun campaign settings. These novels <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> and did not require knowledge of the game rules, making them accessible by a more general audience. TSR published several gamebook series, such as Endless Quest, Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Adventure Gamebooks, Fantasy Forest, and HeartQuest, which were based on the D&D settings.|$|R
50|$|The entire series {{encompasses}} a large story arc, with several characters disappearing, and some reappearing, throughout the series.

A variety of barbecue sauces may be available, and some barbecue restaurants bottle their own sauces for customer purchase. Some barbecue restaurants prepare their foods without any sauces, and may not offer any as condiments.

500|$|In {{a summary}} of the Warlock oeuvre, Copley asserts that Heseltine was a natural melodist in the Schubert mould: [...] "With very few {{exceptions}} his melodies will <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> ... they can be sung by themselves with no accompaniment, as complete and satisfing as folk-songs". Copley identifies certain characteristic motifs or [...] "fingerprints", which recur throughout the works and which are used to depict differences of mood and atmosphere: anguish, resignation but also warmth, tenderness and amorous dalliance. The music critic Ernest Bradbury comments that Heseltine's songs [...] "serve both singer and poet, the one in their memorably tuneful vocal lines, the other in a scrupulous regard for correct accentuation free from any suggestion of pedantry".|$|E

40|$|Like their {{opposite}} {{numbers in}} other European states, the Spanish greens {{have tended to}} fare very badly in state elections. In the most recent (1996) general election, the green parties <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> platform and secured more than 0. 5 % in only one of Spain's 17 electoral regions. In most others, they scored so poorly that their vote was not even recorded in official statistics. In recent years the greens have taken steps towards achieving greater political power by building alliances with centre-left parties, but {{at the cost of}} compromising <b>their</b> <b>own</b> principles and beliefs. This paper discusses some of the other 'external' obstacles impeding their progress into the political mainstream. The author argues that the future for green parties in Spain remains extremely bleak, even if internal philosophical wrangles were satisfactorily resolved. Only when the country becomes more integrated into the European Union and its political culture becomes more like that of other Member States will the Spanish political system becomes receptive to green political ideas. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

500|$|The {{gestation}} period is about {{eight and a}} half months and between 80 and 90% of the calves are born within a three-week time period. Female wildebeest give birth {{in the middle of a}} herd rather than alone, and typically in the middle of the day. This allows time for the newborn to become steady on its feet before night falls and the predators become more active. Calves weigh about [...] at birth, and can usually <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> within a few minutes of birth. To escape predation, calves remain close to their mothers for a significant time, and may continue suckling until the next year's calf is nearly due. Some calves leave their mother at about eight months and form herds with other juveniles. In large female herds, 80% of the wildebeest offspring survive the first month, compared to a 50% survival rate in smaller herds.|$|E

Unlike earlier scrolls such as the Genji Emaki, in which architecture and landscape were used as metaphors for people's emotions, interpersonal or societal pressures, in these scrolls the people's feelings are painted directly on the faces or shown through gestures, in addition to being expressed by the placement of characters within the scene. Architectural elements such as pillars, beams or platforms continued to be used to convey moods.

500|$|Unlike his {{original}} model, Gilbert, Wodehouse preferred {{the music to}} be written first, fitting his words into the melodies.
