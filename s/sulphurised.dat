40|$|Photovoltaics is {{regarded}} as one of the most potentially important clean energy sources in the future providing it is able to meet the demands of a lower production cost. It requires cheap materials, equipment and processes as well as a high energy conversion efficiency. The focus of this thesis is on kesterite thin film solar cells, mainly Cu 2 ZnSnS 4 (CZTS) and Ge-alloyed Cu 2 ZnSnxGe 1 -xS 4 (CZTGS), prepared by a cost-effective two-step approach of magnetron sputtering and post-sulphurisation –an emerging thin film photovoltaic technology with a potential to meet the requirements stated above. It combines the advantages of the mature and high-performance Copper-Indium-Gallium-Selenide/Sulphide (CIGS) photovoltaic technology with cheaper and non-toxic materials. Besides, it allows a large-area production of thin film solar cell with the cheap and controllable deposition approach of magnetron sputtering. This thesis presents the author’s research results on kesterite thin film solar cell prepared by <b>sulphurising</b> sputtered metallic/metal-sulphide precursor. It covers a wide range of important topics: the influence of precursor parameters and sulphurisation conditions on kesterite thin film quality and the associated photovoltaic performance, complete cell fabrication and characterisation, thorough investigation of kesterite crystallization process and the influence of Ge alloying on the property of CZTGS thin film. It can be categorised into two parts according to the different kesterite materials studied. The first part focuses on fabricating the CZTS thin film absorber and the associate CZTS thin film solar cell. A novel precursor type of Zn/(Cu&Sn) with Zn as the bottom layer and Cu-Sn co-sputtered as the top layer is designed for synthesizing the CZTS thin film absorber. A best device efficiency of 4. 47 % is achieved by optimizing the sulphurisation conditions. The crystallization process of CZTS is studied to reveal the reaction sequence at different temperature ranges. Other important issues are also addressed, including the formation mechanism of voids, the influence of different precursor stacking orders and the influence of Zn concentration. The second part studies the Ge-alloyed CZTGS thin films. A systematic study is presented on the variation of structural, optical and electrical properties of CZTGS thin film caused by Ge alloying. Additionally, the fabrication of CZGS thin film by <b>sulphurising</b> sputtered metal-sulphide precursor is developed. The first working CZGS thin film device with an efficiency of 0. 56 % is manufactured. Related issues like the influence of sulphurisation conditions and the influence of sodium diffusion on the CZGS grain growth are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|FeSx layers were {{deposited}} onto {{aluminosilicate glass}} substrates over a temperature range of 180 °C to 500 °C using a horizontal AP-MOCVD reactor. Fe(CO) 5 {{was used as}} the Fe source in combination with t-Bu 2 S 2 or t-BuSH as S precursor to control the rate of reaction and film stoichiometry. The Fe and S partial pressures were kept at 7. 5 x 103 and 3. 0 mbar, giving a gas phase S/Fe ratio of 400. Reactions followed a non-Arrhenius relationship at higher temperatures. XRD revealed mixed FeSx phases in the layers, which consisted mainly of FeS and Fe 1 -xS. Post growth annealing of the FeSx films using S powder in a static argon atmosphere and temperatures ranging from 250 °C to 400 °C was carried out using a 30 minute soak time. Characterisation by XRD confirmed a transitional phase change to FeS 2 for the S anneal at 400 °C. These films were highly absorbing in the visible region of the solar spectrum, which extended into the NIR. Devices with a p-i-n structure were produced using either a <b>sulphurised</b> or non-sulphurised FeSx i-layer, and compared to p-n devices without an i-layer. A non-sulphurised p-i-n device had the best I-V results, which was attributed to reduced lateral inhomogeneity across the device relative to the thinner p-n device structures. Devices with <b>sulphurised</b> FeSx i-layers performed least efficiently which is suspected to be due to a less defined FeSx/CdS junction caused by severe conditions during the S annealing process...|$|E

Thallium {{sulphide}} {{layers of}} different composition were obtained {{on the surface}} of polyethylene when it was <b>sulphurised</b> in a solution of higher polythionic acid, H 2 S 33 O 6, and then treated with an alkaline solution of thallium(I) sulphate.

All of the bitumens contain isorenieratane (13 C ca. − 17) indicating {{the presence of}} Chlorobiaceae, and thus periods of euxinic conditions extended into the photic zone. Aliphatic hydrocarbon fractions are dominated by pristane and phytane and contain relatively low amounts of 4 - and 4 -methylsteranes (C 30, 13 C ca. − 16) believed to originate from 4 -methylsterols in dinoflagellates. 13 C values of gammacerane (ca. − 24) and C 30 17, 21 (H) -hopane (ca. − 23) are consistent with an origin from bacterivorous ciliates that fed on Chlorobiaceae.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a combinatorial method for the deposition and characterization of new metallic precursors for photovoltaic materials. Onedimensional thin film alloy “libraries” were electrodeposited on Mo-coated glass. The library elements were deposited in two consecutive baths and then heated in a reducing atmosphere to promote interdiffusion of the elements. At {{the end of}} this process, the libraries possessed a composition gradient along their lengths, with single elements at their two opposite ends and one or more alloys and/or a solid state solution in between. This continuous range of compositions can therefore be considered a collection of specific precursors that can be interrogated by examining their corresponding locations, with the crystallographic structure along the library changing in accordance with the phase diagram for the metals. The libraries were then <b>sulphurised</b> or selenised by heating in a sulphur-rich or selenium rich atmosphere; this converted the metallic precursors in a continuous range of materials, candidates for potential solar cells absorbers. The libraries were analysed by X-ray diffraction and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry.

40|$|Chapter I {{presents}} {{an overview of}} mass spectrometry on double focusing instruments. Special {{attention is paid to}} ionisation methods which may be of use in mixture analysis. In chapter II, following a brief introduction to chemometrics, results of the application of factor analysis to the problem of determining the components of a mixture from mass spectra of simple mixtures are given. After applying the technique to simulated data, the results of applying the technique to simple mixtures and to the deconvolution of overlapping GC/MC spectra are given. It is concluded that provided the pure compounds have 'unique' peaks in their mass spectra, and that the statistical variations in the intensities of peaks due to different mixtures are not correlated, then the technique will yield good results. Chapter III deals with the application of CI techniques and factor analysis to the analysis of engine oils. Attempts to use the factor analysis technique to yield a meaningful 'type' analysis of engine oil fractions was not successful. The use of proton transfer reagents and charge transfer reagents for CI spectra of engine oil fractions was also unsuccessful. It is concluded that the complexity of engine oil mixtures and the chemical similarity of the constituent molecules makes them difficult to differentiate by CI mass spectrometry. In the final chapter, details are gave of an investigation into the use of CI mass spectrometry and FAB mass spectrometry for the analysis of engine oil additives. The additives studied were calcium 2, 2 '-bis (4 -alkylphenyl) sulphides. The FAB mass spectrometry of these <b>sulphurised</b> phenates gave poor results with glycerol, triethanolamine, triethanolamine / sodium sulphate or squalane used as FAB matrix. Of the CI techniques used, electron capture ionisation of the hydrolysed sample gave the most promising results. The molecular ion peak intensities were higher than those encountered in the EI spectra. In addition, the fragmentation in the EC spectra was simpler than the fragmentation in the EI spectrum. Metastable ion studies of the EI and EC spectra of the <b>sulphurised</b> phenols, using the technique of metastable mapping, gave some useful results, but the poor mass resolving power and the long run times were a major drawback. It is concluded that the technique of metastable mapping is of no use where mass resolution is important, and the use of inlet systems, such as an AGHIS, which allow long sample lifetimes is recommended. Where possible, the use of tandem mass spectrometry or Fourier transform mass spectrometry for metastable ion studies for mixture analysis, is also recommended. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: CISCuT (copper indium {{sulphide}} (CIS) on Cu tape) is a {{new technology}} for thin film solar cells. In a roll-to-roll process, indium is deposited on a copper tape, and subsequently <b>sulphurised.</b> It was shown previously that various Cu-In-S phases are formed. After deposition of a window layer such as e. g. Cu(O,S), the structure behaves as a photovoltaic p-n junction. Analysis of IV-measurements in dark and under illumination of cell structures with circular Cu(O,S) revealed some peculiarities. Large values of the light current density were observed and the IV-characteristics showed pronounced shunt behaviour. When illumination of the cell was restricted {{to the area of}} the contact dot, light current showed an acceptable value. This phenomenon could be explained by assuming an internal p-n junction inside the absorber layer where the p-layer near the surface has a non-negligible lateral conductance. This phenomenon was described quantitatively and simulated in a numerical program. These simulations could explain the additional light current and also the shunt behaviour of the cell quantitatively. Fitting of measured and simulated IV-curves allowed estimating the sheet resistance of the p-type layer. This leads {{to the conclusion that the}} p-n junction is not at the Cu(O,S) interface, but that there is an internal p-n junction inside the CuInS 2 absorber...|$|E
40|$|The SRV {{test rig}} {{was used to}} {{evaluate}} the friction and wear properties of a lubricant in a laboratory setup. Normally, the coefficient of friction and the amount of wear that occurred are measured while the wear scar surface is also evaluated. Special attention was paid to factors that affect the repeatability. The test fluid was subjected to a friction and wear test on the SRV test rig in order to determine what factors affect the repeatability of the coefficient of friction, the amount of wear that occurred and the wear scar appearance. The test fluid used was based on rapeseed oil and white mineral oil. The fluid also contained an extreme pressure additive in the form of <b>sulphurised</b> ester. This was also compared for the same test fluid with dispersed hexagonal-boron nitride (h-BN) nanoparticles. The standard test method as described by ASTM D 6425, was used as test method. Instead of the standard temperature, the block temperature was increased to 100 °C in order to simulate harsher operating environments. The load was set at 200 N It was found that:  The rapid load increase from 50 to 200 N {{at the end of the}} running-in period (as described in the standard test method) caused poor repeatability. The test was modified with a more gradual load application for the duration of the running-in period (30 N/min), which resulted in improvement in the repeatability of the tests conducted.  The moisture content in the atmosphere also affected the repeatability of the friction and wear tests. This was most likely due to the formation of a corrosion layer that involves water and by keeping the relative humidity constant, a further improvement in the repeatability was observed. The addition of the h-BN nanoparticles resulted in an improvement of the repeatability of the coefficient of friction (COF), wear scar surface (WSS) and wear scar volume (WSV), since the wear scar surfaces indicated that the particles remove the corrosion layers. This could have led to more consistent wear surfaces for the duration of the test.  The particles also influenced the corrosion layer formation. For both fluids, Raman spectroscopy indicated that greigite (Fe 3 S 4) and goethite (α-FeOOH) were found on the surface, while additional corrosion products were found on the wear scar surface for the test fluid with dispersed particles. These compounds were melanterite (FeSO 4. 7 H 2 O) and rozenite (FeSO 4. 4 H 2 O). All these corrosion products were most likely formed due to the reaction of iron from the specimens with <b>sulphurised</b> esters in the test fluid.

40|$|Gasification {{technologies}} {{are among the}} most promising electrical power generation options both from an environmental and efficiency point of view, as they allow efficient, environmentally-friendly use of national coal, as well as other carbonaceous materials mixed with coal, including high sulphur by-products. During gasification, sulphur is converted mainly into H 2 S and secondly into COS, and control of these has been researched using several H 2 S adsorbents. The aim of this paper was advanced removal of these compounds. Dolomite, which reacts with H 2 S to yield calcium sulphide, was chosen from among several earth-alkaline compounds for research due to its properties and low cost in reducing the presence of H 2 S in coal gasification. Tests were carried out using dolomite from Granada, Spain, with this sorbent used without blending and with amounts of 100 g and 150 g in each test. The dolomite was sulphurized using a mixture of gases that simulates the gasification gas. The influence of sulphurisation conditions such as gas velocity, bed length, grain size, gas temperature, and gas composition were investigated. The solid products obtained were characterised by X-ray diffraction and chemical analysis. The behaviour of COS that normally accompanies H 2 S in gasification gases was investigated and found to follow a breakthrough curve similar to H 2 S, with equilibrium existing between the COS destroyed due to reaction with hydrogen and by hydrolysis and the COS formed by reaction of CO 2 with H 2 S. Hence, its content in outlet gases {{is a function of the}} composition of this gas, especially in terms of CO 2, H 2 S and H 2 O.

40|$|The {{naturally}} occurring mineral of Cu 2 ZnSnS 4 (CZTS) is a promising alternative absorber layer for thin film based photovoltaic devices. It has the remarkable advantage that {{it consists of}} abundant, inexpensive and non-toxic elements compared to its crystallographically related and highly successful counterparts: the Cu(In,Ga) (S,Se) 2 (CIGSSe) and CuIn(S, Se) 2 (CISSe) material systems. Therefore, there is real commercial potential for reduced material costs and improved device efficiencies. A two-stage high throughput combinatorial process for the fabrication of Cu-Zn-Sn-S thin film libraries is presented, which consists of either sequentially stacking or co-depositing Cu,Sn and Zn precursor layers by DC magnetron sputtering followed by a sulphurisation process. Sputtering conditions and target-substrate geometry are developed to give compositionally graded Cu-Zn-Sn precursor layers spanning a wide spatial region around the point of stoichiometry. Conversion into Cu-Zn-Sn-S libraries is achieved by thermally evaporating a uniform layer of sulphur directly onto the metal alloy and annealing the sample at 500 °C in a furnace. Effects of the precursor composition on the structural properties of the films prior to the incorporation of sulphur are investigated. The <b>sulphurised</b> libraries are then studied by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy {{as a function of}} composition, to assess the effects on morphology and phase formation. Observations of changes in lattice parameters and crystallinity are clear. The opto-electronic and electrical properties of the CZTS film libraries are measured using photoconductivity and hot point probe techniques, respectively. Changes in the band gap and conductivity type are studied as a function of atomic ratios. Based on high performing compositions, devices have been fabricated with the highest achieving cell at 1. 26 %. The observations are discussed {{in the context of the}} particular compositions and synthesis conditions, and recommendations are made for further work...|$|E
40|$|Dolomite {{reacts with}} H 2 S to produce calcium {{sulphide}} {{and has been}} broadly investigated as a desulphurization agent due to its low-cost and favourable properties. Because CaS reacts with water or water vapour in the environment to regenerate hydrogen sulphide and, therefore, disposal is problematic and the chemical cannot be uses as a landfill material. One ofthe methods used to make this material inert is oxidation to convert calcium sulphide into calcium sulphate or calcium oxide. In our study, tests were carried out using dolomite from Granada, Spain, that was previously calcined and <b>sulphurised</b> at high temperature with a gas similar to that produced in gasification facilities. To approximate real-scale results, a relatively large amount of substance was used for each sample (100 – 150 g) and the samples were used in a fixed-bed position. The influence of different conditions, such as grain size, composition of the oxidation gas, gas velocity, bed length and temperature, was them investigated. The final solid products were characterised by X-ray diffraction and chemical analysis and the CO 2, SO 2, H 2 S and COS concentrations in the gases produced during oxidation were analysed by gas chromatography. The {{results showed that the}} most influential factor was grain size and that the best oxidant was O 2 mixed with nitrogen. The presence of water vapour increases the residual concentration of CaS in the end product, butin creased the CaO content The higher the oxygen concentration and the higher the gas velocity, the lower the residual content ofCaS. CO 2 used alone oxidises CaS to produce SO 2 and COS, but at very low rates. It also produces some CS 2. Water vapour used alone can also oxidise the CaS to produce H 2 S and SO 2 but also at very low velocity.

40|$|The {{importance}} of organic sulphur fixation in {{the preservation of}} organic matter in humic coal-forming environments is demonstrated in this thesis. The transgression of coal depositional systems by marine waters during their deposition and early diagenesis enables the production of reduced inorganic sulphur species by sulphate-reducing bacteria. The presence of these reactive sulphur species, {{in combination with the}} altered chemical and microbial regime, influences the preservation and petroleum potential of humic coal. Three lignite samples taken over a two meter depth profile of a core in the Eocene, Heartbreak Ridge lignite deposit, SE Western Australia, were analysed by a suite of geochemical techniques to identify origins and transformation pathways of their organic matter. Rock-Eval, FTIR microscopy, and pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GCMS) indicate that the composition of the lignite and its extract are typical of immature type III organic matter with a predominance of aromatic and oxygen containing functionalities. Variation in the macromolecular composition of the three lignites are consistent with more pronounced degradation of the organic matter in the lowermost lignite horizon. Nickel boride desulphurisation of polar and asphaltene fractions of the lignites showed the presence of sulphur-bound higher plant triterpenoids, in particular olean- 12 -ene, n-alkanes of even predominance, C 29 steranes and extended 17 â(H), 21 â(H) -hopanes. Deuterium labelling experiments indicated that these components were mostly bound to a single sulphur, at sites about the original functionality in the natural product precursors. The presence of singularly sulphur-bound aromatic ring A degraded and pentacyclic triterpenoids represent the spectrum of aromatic triterpenoid intermediates undergoing diagenesis before sulphur incorporation. Stable carbon isotopic ++analyses of the free and sulphur-bound aliphatic hydrocarbons confirmed carbon sources from both higher plants and bacteria. Oxygenated lipids consisted of even carbon-numbered n-alkanoic monocarboxylic acids, ù-hydroxy fatty acids and n-alkanols, n-alkan- 2 -ones, 6, 10, 14 -triinethylpentadecan- 2 -one, and oxygenated hopanoids and higher plant triterpenoids. BY the onset of sulphurisation in the Heartbreak Ridge lignite, extended hopanoid degradation had come to a hiatus, in marked contrast to the variable alteration of the higher plant triterpenoids. The oxygen-containing lipids of the extracts are implicated as the primary source of the <b>sulphurised</b> hydrocarbons, although not necessarily via direct sulphurisation of their present sent form, but through the formation of more reactive intermediates. These results implicate sulphur fixation as a means by which lipids of similar structures to the natural product precursors are preserved in coal forming environments. That diagenetic alteration of the oxygenated lipids mirrors that of the sulphur-bound hydrocarbons confirms that the onset of marine incursion and the formation of reduced inorganic sulphides does inhibit (and also preserve) the normal biogeochemical transformations of organic matter in coal-forming environments. The technique of reaction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (R-GCMS) was also applied to the analysis of the polar extracts from a Heartbreak Ridge lignite, together with the polar extracts from the Monterey Formation shale (Naples Beach, USA; Miocene age). Palladium black acting as a catalyst under hydrogen carrier gas in the vaporising injection port of a GCMS, effected gas phase reaction of the volatile constituents in the polar mixtures. The fully active catalyst effected hydrogenation, desulphurisation and decarbonylation/decarboxylation reactions. Polar fractions of the Heartbreak Ridge lignite ++reacted to produce angiosperm-derived triterpenoids and bacterially-derived hopanoids. The reaction of the Monterey Formation shale polars resulted in the formation of high relative amounts of pristane and phytane with a predominance of the latter, as well. as a suite of steroidal and triterpenoid moieties, typical of marine organic matter. However, R-GCMS provided less detailed information on the exact nature of the functionalised lipids partitioned within the polar fraction than that obtained by more conventional wet chemical analyses. The compositions of 35 marine-influenced, bituminous coals, from the Eocene Brunner Coal Measures of New Zealand were studied to assess the effect of the timing of marine incursion on the molecular characteristics of coals. Based upon their stratigraphic position and their volatile matter and total sulphur contents, coal samples were classified into those where the mire was flooded during or at the end of deposition (Class A/B) and those that experienced postdepositional access of marine water during later diagenetic stages (Class C/D). Rock-Eval pyrolyses showed that sulphur-rich Brunner coals generally display moderate increases in pyrolytic yields with respect to the low-sulphur Brunner coals. Class A-C coals generally release larger quantities of hydrocarbons during Rock-Eval pyrolysis than the Class D coals, suggesting that sulphur fixation can enhance the hydrocarbon potential of buried mires, provided sulphur is introduced early. Variation in Carbon Preference Indices, isoprenoid/alkane ratios, the Methylphenanthrene Index and phenanthrene/anthracene of bitumens and pyrolysates both within different seam profiles and between different sampling localities can be attributed to changes in microbial regime as well as subtle variations in rank. Pristane/phytane, dibenzothiophene/phenanthrene and thiophene ratios are closely related ++to organic sulphur contents, but are also influenced by these changes in rank and differences in the timing of marine incursion. Organic sulphur contents and biomarker compositions are related through a drillcore profile, which confirms the role of diagenetic sulphur sequestration in preserving specific biomarkers (steranes, higher plant triterpanes, extended hopanes) in coal-forming environments. Biomarker ratios that vary accordingly include the homohopane index, Ts/Tm, C 29 Ts/norhopane, C 30 diahopane/hopane, sterane/hopane ratio, C 29 diasterane/sterane, oleanane/hopane, oleanoid triterpane/hopane, and ring A degraded triterpanes/des-E-hopane. Diasterane concentrations were greatest in high sulphur coals. It is suggested that sterenes, generated from sulphur-bound steroids of regular stereochemistry in the subsurface, undergo acid-catalysed rearrangement and hydrogenation to enhance diasterane concentrations. A similar formation mechanism can be invoked for the rearranged hopanes (Ts, C 29 Ts, C 30 diahopane) and oleanoid triterpanes. The timing of sulphur fixation {{does not appear to have}} influenced the formation of biomarkers except in one case. The only lipid class that degraded rapidly enough for the precursors required for sulphurisation to be removed prior to saline access is the higher plant triterpenoids. Stable carbon isotopic analysis of the n-alkanes, isoprenoids and hopanoids from the Pike River Outcrop seam section confirms both higher plant and microbial sources. In particular, the carbon isotopic composition of phytane suggests that methanogenic decomposition of the Pike River peat occurred. The isotopic signatures are invariant to changes in the degree or timing (Class A-C only) of sulphur access to this outcrop. This body of work finds that the introduction of marine waters (and the formation of reduced sulphides) in the early stages of mire and peat ++development preserves the inherited lipid composition of the peat and does not overwhelm this biotic signature during sulphate reduction. As such, the selective preservation of certain biomarkers enables their use as indicators of marine-influence in source rocks. The application of several biomarker ratios to the characterisation of crude oils from the Taranaki Basin of New Zealand provides further evidence for the generation of liquid hydrocarbons from marine-influenced, angiosperm-rich coals...|$|E
