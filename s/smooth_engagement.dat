50|$|In {{technical}} application such as actuators, an Acme thread is used, {{although it has}} higher friction, because {{it is easy to}} manufacture, wear can be compensated for, it is stronger than a comparably sized square thread and it makes for <b>smoother</b> <b>engagement.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{original}} trapezoidal thread form, {{and still}} probably {{the one most}} commonly encountered worldwide, is the Acme thread form ( [...] ). The Acme thread was developed in 1894 as a profile well suited to power screws that has various advantages over the square thread, which had been the form of choice until then. It is easier to cut via either single-point threading or die than the square thread is (because the latter's shape requires tool bit or die tooth geometry that is poorly suited to cutting); it wears better than square (because the wear can be compensated for); it is stronger than a comparably sized square thread; and it makes for <b>smoother</b> <b>engagement</b> of the half nuts on a lathe leadscrew than square does.|$|R

5000|$|In {{a modern}} {{car with a}} manual {{transmission}} the clutch is operated by the left-most pedal using a hydraulic or cable connection from the pedal to the clutch mechanism. On older cars the clutch might be operated by a mechanical linkage. Even though the clutch may physically be located {{very close to the}} pedal, such remote means of actuation are necessary to eliminate the effect of vibrations and slight engine movement, engine mountings being flexible by design. With a rigid mechanical linkage, <b>smooth</b> <b>engagement</b> would be near-impossible because engine movement inevitably occurs as the drive is [...] "taken up." ...|$|E
50|$|Another {{difference}} between semi-trucks and cars {{is the way}} the clutch is set up. On an automobile, the clutch pedal is depressed full stroke to the floor for every gear shift, to ensure the gearbox is disengaged from the engine. On a semi-truck with constant mesh transmission (non synchronized), such as by the Eaton Roadranger series, not only is double clutching required, but a clutch brake is required as well. The clutch brake stops the rotation of the gears, and allows the truck to be put into gear without grinding when stationary. The clutch is pressed to the floor only to allow <b>smooth</b> <b>engagement</b> of low gears when starting from a full stop; when the truck is moving, the clutch pedal is pressed only far enough to break torque for gear changes.|$|E
50|$|Hall effect sensors {{sense the}} {{direction}} of requested shift, and this input, together with a sensor in the gear box which senses the current speed and gear selected, feeds into a central processing unit. This unit then determines the optimal timing and torque required for a <b>smooth</b> clutch <b>engagement,</b> based on input from these two sensors {{as well as other}} factors, such as engine rotation, the Electronic Stability Control, air conditioner and dashboard instruments.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new iterative learning strategy to control wet clutches. These are complex hydraulic {{systems that are}} commonly used in automatic transmissions of heavy duty vehicles, and their control aims at performing fast and <b>smooth</b> <b>engagements.</b> Learning is used to overcome the need for complex models and to ensure performance is maintained despite large variations in the system behavior. Classical iterative learning control techniques can however not be employed directly since reference trajectories corresponding to the performance requirements are unavailable. Instead, the presented iterative learning strategy translates the performance requirements directly into an objective function and constraints, hence constituting a numerical optimization problem. After each engagement, this problem is solved {{in order to find}} the control signal for the next engagement, using a piecewise linear model for the clutch. Learning is included by using the measured response data to update the models and constraints used by the optimization problem. The presented strategy is successfully validated on an experimental test bench containing wet clutches. The learning process is shown to converge towards the desired engagement quality, and a demonstration is given of the robustness with respect to changes in the operating conditions. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|When {{starting}} out in Drive range, low gear was automatically selected {{and the low}} band applied under pressure modulated by a vacuum modulator which sensed engine output and adjusted clutch and band apply pressures to provide <b>smooth</b> <b>engagement</b> without slip. As the vehicle accelerated, rear pump output would increase and initiate a shift to direct. The rear pump pressures were modified by a throttle valve, and governor, both of which could delay the upshift, or even trigger a forced downshift at driver command. Full throttle downshifts were achieved by the throttle valve which permitted the transmission to stay in low range or be forced into downshifting to speeds between 45 - 50 mph. At speeds under 35 mph, heavy throttle would delay upshifts, or initiate a forced 'detent touch' kickdown for better performance. When Low Range or Reverse are selected, the apply pressures are not modulated and the full line pressure of the transmission is applied to ensure positive engagement. The multiple plate reverse clutch and double wrap low band design offered a slight buffer to engagement to prevent harshness even under high apply pressures. A quite sophisticated valve body timed shifts and apply pressures carefully in Drive range to ensure smoothness and prevent 'hunting' between gears, which is a common complaint of small cars with automatic transmission. Corvair Powerglides had a good reputation for reliability and were ordered on {{a large majority of}} Corvair passenger cars.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: To {{enable a}} {{realistic}} {{automated manual transmission}} (AMT) system performance evaluation and rapid prototyping, this paper focuses on constructing a practical Simulink model and a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) real-time simulation. The working principle and dynamic characteristics of the AMT system are first explored. The driveline, the engine control, and the dry clutch are modelled and analysed. In particular, a dynamic model for the hydraulic clutch actuator that is currently used in the actual transmissions is developed. To evaluate the performance and operation characteristics of the AMT system, the control methodology to ensure desirable performance is studied. The gearshift control logic and the proportional– integral–derivative-based clutch control are analysed and implemented. Based on the dynamic model and the controller, a Simulink model is developed and implemented into an HIL real-time simulator to enable rapid prototyping. In addition, to realize an energy-efficient and <b>smooth</b> clutch <b>engagement,</b> {{the possibility of using}} the dynamic programming method to generate the optimal clutch and engine torque control inputs is investigated as well. In particular, the controllability of the AMT system is studied to determine the number of control inputs necessary for optimal control. To this end, the simulation and experiment results in the HIL environment are presented...|$|R
40|$|Part 11 : Engineering Applications of AI and Artificial Neural NetworksInternational audienceIn a {{wet clutch}} system, a piston {{is used to}} {{compress}} the friction disks to close the clutch. The position and the velocity of the piston are the key effectors for achieving a good engagement performance. In a real setup, {{it is impossible to}} measure these variables. In this paper, we use transmission torque and slip to approximate the piston velocity and position information. By using this information, a process neural network is trained. This neural predictor shows good forecasting results on the piston position and velocity. It is helpful in designing a pressure profile which can result in a <b>smooth</b> and fast <b>engagement</b> in the future. This neural predictor can also be used in other model-based control techniques...|$|R
40|$|Forty {{years after}} AT&T’s Picturephone, video is still mainly {{considered}} {{as a way to}} enhance audio communication in an attempt to reproduce face-to-face conditions. In a 1992 paper, Hollan and Stornetta argued that we should develop communication tools that go beyond being there. In this paper, we discuss two different interpretations of their analysis. We then propose the concept of multiscale communication as an alternative approach for motivating telecommunication research, an approach that aims at creating systems that support a variable degree of <b>engagement,</b> <b>smooth</b> transitions between degrees and integration with other media. Finally, we present three video systems from which the multiscale communication concept emerged and that partly illustrate it.

40|$|A common {{approach}} when applying reinforcement learning to address control {{problems is that}} of first learning a policy based on an approximated model of the plant, whose behavior can be quickly and safely explored in simulation; and then implementing the obtained policy to control the actual plant. Here we follow this approach to learn to engage a transmission clutch, {{with the aim of}} obtaining a rapid and <b>smooth</b> <b>engagement,</b> with a small torque loss. Using an approximated model of a wet clutch, which simulates a portion of the whole engagement, we first learn an open loop control signal, which is then transferred on the actual wet clutch, and improved by further learning with a different reward function, based on the actual torque loss observed. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a controller development for an electro-mechanical friction clutch (EMFC) system for automotive applications {{and especially for}} vehicles that use continuously variable transmission. The work focuses on developing an EMFC engagement controller based on experimental work using a Proportional Derivative (PID) controller algorithm to engage the dry friction clutch. The EMFC is electromechanically actuated using a DC motor system, such that a <b>smooth</b> <b>engagement</b> process can be performed satisfactorily. To develop the controller, the dynamic behaviors of the EMFC system are investigated by performing tests on the EMFC bench-test. Results from this experiment show {{that the percentage of}} slip between the input and output shaft of the EMFC system depends on the input speed and output torque. Therefore, by applying slip control, engagement of the EMFC can be controlled and achieved for any input speed and torque during the standing start of a vehicle...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Posterior-stabilized (PS) total knee {{arthroplasty}} (TKA) components {{employ a}} tibial post and femoral cam mechanism to guide anteroposterior knee motion {{in lieu of}} the posterior cruciate ligament. Some PS TKA patients report a clicking sensation when the post and cam engage, while severe wear and fracture of the post; we hypothesize that these complications are associated with excessive impact velocity at engagement. We evaluated the effect of implant design on engagement dynamics of the post-cam mechanism and resulting polyethylene stresses during dynamic activity. In vitro simulation of a knee bend activity was performed for four cadaveric specimens implanted with PS TKA components. Post-cam engagement velocity and flexion angle at initial contact were determined. The experimental data were used to validate computational predictions of PS mechanics using the same loading conditions. A lower limb model was subsequently utilized to compare engagement mechanics of eight TKA designs, relating differences between implants to geometric design features. Flexion angle and post-cam velocity at engagement demonstrated considerable ranges among designs (23 ˚– 89 ˚, and 0. 05 – 0. 22 mm/˚, respectively). Post-cam velocity was correlated (r 0. 89) with tibiofemoral condylar design features. Condylar geometry, in addition to post-cam geometry, {{played a significant role in}} minimizing engagement velocity and forces and stresses in the post. This analysis guides selection and design of PS implants that facilitate <b>smooth</b> post-cam <b>engagement</b> and reduce edge loading of the post. 2013 Orthopaedic Research Society Published by Wile...|$|R
