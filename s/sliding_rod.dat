60|$|At last an {{extremely}} simple and remarkably successful deep-sea sounding apparatus {{was invented by}} Mr Brooke, an American officer. It consisted of nothing more than thin twine for a sounding-line, and a cannon ball for a sinker. The twine was made for the purpose, fine but very strong, and was wound on a reel {{to the extent of}} ten thousand fathoms. The cannon ball, which was from thirty-two to sixty-eight pounds' weight, had a hole quite through it, into which was fixed a <b>sliding</b> <b>rod,</b> the end of which, covered with grease, projected several inches beyond the ball. By an ingenious and simple contrivance, the cannon ball was detached when it reached the bottom of the sea, and the light rod was drawn up with specimens of the bottom adhering to the grease.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a novel {{design for a}} 4 degree of freedom pneumatically-actuated upper-limb rehabilitation device. BONES {{is based on a}} parallel mechanism that actuates the upper arm by means of two passive, <b>sliding</b> <b>rods</b> pivoting with respect to a fixed structural frame. Four, mechanicallygrounded pneumatic actuators are placed behind the main structural frame to control shoulder motion via the <b>sliding</b> <b>rods,</b> and a fifth cylinder is located on the structure to control elbow flexion/extension. The device accommodates a wide range of motion of the human arm, while also achieving low inertia and direct-drive force generation capability at the shoulder. A key accomplishment of this design is the ability to generate arm internal/external rotation without any circular bearing element such as a ring, a design feature inspired by the biomechanics of the human forearm. The paper describes the rationale for this device and its main design aspects including its kinematics, range of motion, and force generation capability. patients improved access to repetitive aspects of movement training at a reduced cost. Many upper limb robotic devices have been developed [e. g. 6 - 14]. Index Terms—arm exoskeleton, rehabilitation, stroke...|$|R

5000|$|The second {{component}} is the 4-way valve, {{known simply as}} a 4-way. The valve {{is commonly known as}} a 3-way valve because it has 3 visible ports, but this is technically incorrect. It is linked to the trigger via a short timing rod and activated when the trigger is pulled. The 4-way features three barbs on top, two of which are connected via small hoses to either end of the ram, and one of which is connected to the LPR. Gas from the LPR enters the 4-way through the center barb. Inside the 4-way is a small <b>sliding</b> <b>rod</b> (or [...] "spool") with 2 or 3 o-rings forming flow chambers that link the center barb to {{one or the other of}} the outer barbs depending on its position.

40|$|Scoliosis is {{a spinal}} {{deformity}} characterised by lateral curvatures of the spine. It typically occurs during adolescence, but in rare incidences {{can occur in}} young children. In adolescents, if severe or progressive, surgical treatment {{in the form of}} spinal fusion using screw and rod constructs may take place. However, in younger patients the spine and lungs are still growing, therefore, fusion is not recommended before the age of eight years. For early onset scoliosis fusionless techniques are used, with the current gold standard being traditional growing rods, incorporating pedicle screws and rods, which are periodically lengthened through frequent surgical interventions. Due to the number surgeries throughout the treatment period, this treatment suffers from high complication rates. As this treatment is far from ideal, alternative treatments are being explored to reduce these issues. This thesis describes the initial development of an alternative implant for the treatment of early onset scoliosis to alleviate the issues of traditional growing rods. The implant was based on a pedicle screw and rod system, but incorporated a bearing component to allow free extension of the construct without the need for further surgery. The development of the implant design was achieved through finite element analysis of individual components and of constructs using contact conditions. It was initially intended to use a UHMWPE bearing component incorporating a crosslink and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V <b>sliding</b> <b>rod,</b> with a commercially available pedicle screw. However, issues of the construct size lead {{to the development of a}} novel screw design incorporating an alumina bearing, a decoupled crosslink and CoCrMo <b>sliding</b> <b>rod.</b> The results of the finite element analysis show that an implant incorporating an alumina bearing component is a promising area for development, however, additional investigations of the construct are still required...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePainlevé’s {{paradox is}} a {{well-known}} problem in rigid-body dynamics, of which the forward dynamics equations could have no solution. To handle this situation, an assumption of tangential impact is often introduced. Although the assumption seems to provide a good fix, it {{still needs to be}} mathematically examined via analyzing the asymptotic property of a compliance-based model at the limit of rigidity. In this paper, we revisit the paradox using the typical Painlevé’s example of a rod sliding on a rough surface. For convenience, the interaction at the contact point of the rod is represented by a linear spring to scale the local normal compliance, coupled with Coulomb’s law to reflect friction. We perform an asymptotic analysis using the spring stiffness as a perturbation parameter. The rod dynamics in the Painlevé’s paradox, accompanying the variation of friction status, consists of three distinct phases as follows: An initial period of sliding which allows contact force to diverge with the increase of the spring stiffness, a period of sticking which ends at the occurrence of a reverse slip motion, and a reverse slip phase which causes the rod to be detached from the contact surface. As the stiffness goes to infinity, all the time intervals of the three phases converge to zero. This analysis theoretically confirms the assumption of the tangential impact in the paradox of <b>sliding</b> <b>rod</b> dynamics...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} and {{introduction of the}} closed locked intramedullary nail into clinical practice has revolutionized the treatment of fractures of long bone. The most difficult and technically demanding part of the procedure is often the insertion of the distal interlocking screws. A lot of efforts have been made during the past years to make it easier. In according with Whatling and Nokes, we can divide the different approaches to this issue in four main groups: Free-hand (FH) technique; Mechanical targeting devices mounted on image intensifier; Mechanical targeting devices mounted onto nail handle; Computer-assisted techniques. In addition of these, recently it has been proposed a navigational system using electromagnetic field. The main disadvantages of the FH technique, are prolonged exposure to radiation and results depend mostly on the dexterity of the surgeons. FH technique is however the most popular technique. Our targeting device is included into the mounted on image intensifier group. It consists of 2 radio-opaque rods at right angle to each over: one of this is fixed on the c-arm, whereas, {{the other is a}} <b>sliding</b> <b>rod</b> with a sleeve for the drill bit, which is the targeting guide itself. In the realization of this device, we have been inspired by the modification of the FH technique suggested by Kelley et al. To identify the distal holes we used the method described by Medoff (perfect circle). Once that the distal hole is seen as a perfect circle, with the C-arm in later view, the targeting guide is roughly positioned onto this and the drilling and the screwing operations are performed without the need for image intensifier. We used the device in bone models and in 9 clinical cases. In spite of authors demonstrated that the electromagnetic targeting device significantly reduced radiation exposure during placement of distal interlocking screws and was equivalent in accuracy when compared with the FH technique, the latter is the most used technique. Indeed, although all the studies have reported that the radiation exposure to orthopedic surgeon has been below the maximum allowable doses in all cases, there is still the risk of cumulative lifetime radiation exposure. From this point of view, namely the reduction of cumulative lifetime radiation exposure, we think that, paradoxically, our device could be more effective than electromagnetic targeting device, because it can be used in all the orthopedic operations that required a targeting device...|$|E
