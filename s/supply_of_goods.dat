Coffin's wife, Catharine, who was also dedicated to the effort, organized a sewing society that met at their home to produce clothing {{to give to the}} runaways. She also provided meals and shelter to runaway slaves in the Coffin home. Other aid was obtained from neighbors and others sympathetic to the cause, but were unwilling take the fugitives into their homes. Through these activities Coffin was able to secure a steady <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> to assist in the ongoing operations.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{inception}} of the program in 1955, around 20,000 CIP licenses were granted, but it was determined that the progress was too unwieldy to manage, so the number of licenses was decreased and people were obliged to assemble into conglomerates to access the scheme. At first, inflation was regarded as such a pressing concern that there were very few limitations on what could be imported, the most notable restrictions being alcohol and jewellery. It was reasoned that more restrictions on imports would cause a lack of <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> causing price increases. However, restrictions were increased in the next three years to an average of 75.|$|E
5|$|Spain forbade its American colonies {{to trade}} with other nations or foreign colonies, and imposed itself as the only buyer and vendor for their {{international}} trade. This situation damaged the viceroyalty, as Spain's economy was not powerful enough to produce the huge <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> that the numerous colonies would need. This caused economic shortages and recession. The Spanish trade routes favored the ports of Mexico and Lima, {{to the detriment of}} Buenos Aires. As a result, Buenos Aires smuggled those products that could not be obtained legitimately. Most local authorities allowed this smuggling as a lesser evil, even though it was illegal, and it occasionally equalled in volume the legal commerce with Spain. Two antagonistic factions emerged: the landowners wanted free trade so they could sell their products abroad, while the merchants, who benefited from the high prices of smuggled imports, opposed free trade because prices would come down.|$|E

Since it was feared at the time that any hostile action by the natives against the few burgeoning outposts might break Spain's tenuous hold on Alta California, the priests quickly buried the San Juan Capistrano Mission bells. Lieutenant José Francisco Ortega, military leader of the expedition, led all but a small contingent of Spanish soldiers back to El Presidio de San Diego to help quell the uprising; the priests, along with the few remaining soldiers as an escort, gathered up their belongings and fled to the safety of the Presido, where they were given further details of the disaster.|$|E

The result of a joint report by the England and Wales Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission, First Report on Exemption Clauses, the Act was granted the Royal Assent on 18 April 1973 and came into force a month later. It met with a mixed reaction from academics, who praised the additional protection it offered {{while at the same}} time questioning whether it was enough; several aspects of the Act's draftsmanship and implementation were also called into question. Much of the Act was repealed by the Sale of Goods Act 1979, which included many of the 1973 Act's provisions.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the commissioners}} were {{responsible}} for the regulatory framework within which the Poor Law Unions operated, each union was run by a locally elected board of guardians, comprising representatives from each of the participating parishes, assisted by six ex officio members.

500|$|Christopher Carr, an {{academic}} and practising lawyer, called {{the implementation of}} Section 1 [...] "slightly awkward", suggesting {{that in some ways}} it was more limited than the provisions contained in the Sale of Goods Act 1893 from the seller's point of view. Unlike with the 1893 Act, a seller cannot exclude the provisions, and while the right to sell can be excluded {{it is not clear how}} this might be done. Turpin complimented the section on hire-purchase agreements, although noting some flaws in draftsmanship; he also questioned whether or not the protection given to consumers would be sufficient. Prior to the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, the <b>Supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>Goods</b> (Implied Terms) Act 1973 was one of the few limitations on clauses in consumer contracts. Most of it was eventually superseded by the Sale of Goods Act 1979, which included many of the Act's provisions.|$|E
500|$|In Karsales (Harrow) Ltd v Wallis [...] 1 W.L.R. 936 {{the courts}} {{developed}} {{the doctrine of}} fundamental breach; if one party had breached the contract {{in such a way}} that, if there was no exclusion clause, it would void the contract, such a contract could be set aside. Although a step forward, this doctrine was problematic, as pointed out by Lord Reid in Suisse Atlantique Societe d'Armament SA v NV Rotterdamsche Kolen Centrale [...] 1 AC 361; it failed to discriminate between exclusion clauses that were the result of unequal bargaining and those that were not. [...] In 1970 the England and Wales Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission produced their First Report on Exemption Clauses, designed to reform this area of law. The <b>Supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>Goods</b> (Implied Terms) Act 1973 was partially based on that report, but it went further in some respects. It was given the Royal Assent on 18 April 1973, and came into force a month later.|$|E
500|$|In the 13thcentury, Poulton's {{economy was}} largely agricultural. Over the next centuries, the town became a {{commercial}} centre for the area, importing and exporting goods through harbours on the River Wyre at Skippool and Wardleys. Imports of flax were vital {{for a local}} linen industry, particularly in nearby Kirkham, and Poulton craftsmen were part of this industry {{by the beginning of}} the 19thcentury. During the early part of this century the changes brought by the Industrial Revolution led to a decline in the craft industries in Poulton. New methods were not embraced by local producers and the town suffered from its location, far from coalfields and large labour markets. Following the development of the new town and port of Fleetwood from 1836, Poulton's role as a major commerce centre waned. For some time, the town's market remained important as a local <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> for growing Fleetwood and Blackpool. Eventually Poulton was overshadowed by Fleetwood and Blackpool. In his 1837 work on Blackpool, William Thornber called Poulton the [...] "metropolis of the Fylde". This was a time when Poulton was still prominent among its near neighbours; David Foster commented in 1972 that not only was Thornber's description of the town no longer apt, it had ceased to be accurate even from 1850 with the rapid growth of the coastal resorts.|$|E

2500|$|Supply-side {{economics}} {{is a school}} of macroeconomic thought that argues that overall economic well-being is maximized by lowering the barriers to producing goods and services (the [...] "Supply Side" [...] of the economy).

Typical supply-side policy would advocate generally lower income tax and capital gains tax rates (to increase the supply of labor and capital), smaller government and a lower regulatory burden on enterprises (to lower costs).
