5|$|The {{legal system}} of <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia</b> <b>is</b> based on Sharia, Islamic law {{derived from the}} Qur'an and the Sunnah (the traditions) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The sources of Sharia also include Islamic {{scholarly}} consensus developed after Muhammad's death. Its interpretation by judges in <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia</b> <b>is</b> influenced by the medieval (Islamic Golden Age) texts of the literalist Hanbali school of Islamic jurisprudence. Uniquely in the Muslim world, Sharia has been adopted by Saudi Arabia in an uncodified form. This, {{and the lack of}} judicial precedent, has resulted in considerable uncertainty in the scope and content of the country's laws. The government therefore announced its intention to codify Sharia in 2010, but this is yet to be implemented. Sharia has also been supplemented by regulations issued by royal decree covering modern issues such as intellectual property and corporate law. Nevertheless, Sharia remains the primary source of law, especially in areas such as criminal, family, commercial and contract law, and the Qur'an and the Sunnah are declared to be the country's constitution. In the areas of land and energy law the extensive proprietorial rights of the Saudi state (in effect, the Saudi royal family) constitute a significant feature.|$|E
5|$|Most land in <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia</b> <b>is</b> {{owned by}} the {{government}} and only cultivated land and urban property are subject to individual ownership. All land titles must be registered, but there is no accurate information as to the extent of registration. Real estate could only be owned by Saudi citizens until 2000, when the property laws were amended to allow foreigners to own property in Saudi Arabia. Property investments by non-Saudis of more than 30 million Saudi riyals require approval of the Council of Ministers and foreigners remain prohibited from owning property in Medina and Mecca.|$|E

5|$|<b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia</b> <b>is</b> an {{absolute}} monarchy, {{and has no}} legally binding written constitution. However, in 1992, the Basic Law of Saudi Arabia was adopted by royal decree. The Basic Law outlines the responsibilities and processes of the governing institutions but is insufficiently specific {{to be considered a}} constitution. It declares that the king must comply with Sharia (that is, Islamic law) and that the Quran and the Sunna (the traditions of Muhammad) are the country's constitution. Interpretation of the Quran and the Sunna remains necessary, and this is carried out by the ulema, the Saudi religious establishment.|$|E
5|$|Saudi law recognizes only {{corporate}} or partnership entities established under Sharia or the Saudi Company Law of 1982. A {{contract with}} {{any other type of}} company will be void and the persons who made the contract in the company's name will be personally liable for it. Under Sharia, corporations can take a number of forms, but the most common in <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia</b> <b>is</b> Sharikat Modarabah where some partners contribute assets and others contribute expertise. In addition, the Company Law (which is based on Egyptian company law) identifies eight permissible forms of corporate entity including joint ventures, and limited liability partnerships.|$|E

5|$|Just as the Jeddah Tower will {{complement}} the Jeddah Economic City development {{that will be}} built around it, there are many infrastructure and revitalization projects underway and planned throughout Saudi Arabia, such as the US$7.2 billion (SR27.1 billion) new airport terminal under construction at King Abdulaziz (Jeddah) International Airport, that will {{complement the}} Jeddah Economic City as well as develop Saudi Arabia, which has been likened to a Third World country with crumbling infrastructure and widespread disasters, including severe flooding, such as the flash floods in early 2011 that damaged 90% of the roads and over 27,000 buildings in Jeddah. According to a representative of Standard Chartered, which invested US$75 million in Saudi Binladin Group, <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia</b> <b>is</b> going to spend over US$400 billion (SR1.5 trillion) on infrastructure {{over the next few}} years. According to reports by Citi Investment Research & Analysis, $220 billion worth of development, accounting for 36% of all construction spending in the MENA region, will be directly or indirectly beneficial to Jeddah Tower. Jeddah Tower and City themselves are intended to set an example of green development, using modern technology and having a low carbon footprint relative to the number of people they will support. However, there is also an increasing problem of poor education levels in Arab countries {{due to a lack of}} spending in research and education, which it is argued should be invested in rather than building skyscrapers, and that the tower is nothing more than a symbol of hubris. It has even been likened to the Tower of Babel.|$|E

The kingdom is categorized as a World Bank high-income economy with a high Human Development Index {{and is the only}} Arab country {{to be part of the}} G-20 major economies. However, the economy of <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia</b> <b>is</b> the least diversified in the Gulf Cooperation Council, lacking any significant service or production sector (apart from the extraction of resources). The state has attracted criticism for its treatment of women and use of capital punishment. <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia</b> <b>is</b> a monarchical autocracy, has the fourth highest military expenditure in the world and SIPRI found that Saudi Arabia was the world's second largest arms importer in 2010â€“2014. <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia</b> <b>is</b> considered a regional and middle power.
