25|$|Input current: Due to biasing {{requirements}} or leakage, a {{small amount}} of current (typically ~10 nanoamperes for bipolar op-amps, tens of picoamperes (pA) for JFET input stages, and only a few pA for MOSFET input stages) flows into the inputs. When large resistors or sources with high output impedances are used in the circuit, these small currents can produce large unmodeled voltage drops. If the input currents are matched, and the impedance looking out of both inputs are matched, then the voltages produced at each input will be equal. Because the operational amplifier operates on the difference between its inputs, these matched voltages will have no effect. It is more common for the input currents to be slightly mismatched. The difference is called input offset current, and even with matched resistances a <b>small</b> <b>offset</b> voltage (different from the input offset voltage below) can be produced. This offset voltage can create offsets or drifting in the operational amplifier.|$|E

30|$|The {{corresponding}} metric {{applied to}} two identical signal {{parts in the}} time domain yields the maximum likelihood estimator for the frequency offset, as derived in [14] and also used in [5]. For <b>small</b> <b>offsets,</b> when the influence of interference and amplitude degradation can be neglected, the metric for the frequency domain yields the MLE for the frequency offset. In case of larger offsets, the estimator is influenced not only by noise but also by interference from neighboring subchannels and the misalignment of the transmit and receive filters. Hence, due to the simplicity and the optimality in case of <b>small</b> <b>offsets,</b> the MLE from [14] is considered a useful and practical solution for frequency domain estimation.|$|R
