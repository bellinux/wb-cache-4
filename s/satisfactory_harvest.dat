25|$|In 1997, ADMARC {{had needed}} {{to sell the}} {{strategic}} reserve to repay its loans, and after a poor harvest later in 1997, maize stocks were low and consumer prices high. Rainfall in 1997/98 was erratic and the 1998 crop was also poor: ADMARC released reserves and imported maize to prevent famine. The 1999 and 2000 harvests were good, with large sweet potato and cassava crops {{as the result of}} USAIDprojects to promote drought-resistant foods. ADMARC undertook a partial sale of its reserves in 2000, as it could not pay the interest its commercial loans. Sales, including some exports at low prices continued in 2001 despite a poor harvest. The harvest of 2002 was also disappointing, and failure to prevent food shortages caused deaths from hunger and related diseases, mainly in 2002. Estimates of the death toll ranged from a semi-official figure of 500 to 1,000 to credible reports by NGO over 1,000. The harvest of 2003 was also poor and that of 2004 was deficient in maize and in root crops; the next <b>satisfactory</b> <b>harvest</b> was in 2005. Rural poverty increased and by 2005, about 14% of Malawian adult were HIV positive.|$|E
5000|$|After erratic {{rainfall}} and poor harvests in 1997 and 1998 maize stocks were low and consumer prices: ADMARC had to release reserves and import maize to prevent famine. The global committee National Food Reserve Agency (NRFA) introduced in 1998, was citizen and analyzed for letting the famine escalate to this proportion. Measurements of precaution which were created were deemed not effective. The warning system was not adapted properly {{to produce an}} effective warning. As well as the NRFA's selling of a large percent of the Maize stock in its rotation of the grain reserve. Both these failures are {{due to the lack}} of an infrastructure with modern technology and precautions in logistical arrangements [...]The lack of modernity in these matters demonstrates how the IMF who control the NRFA try to applied first world standards to an undeveloped country. However, both the 1999 and 2000 harvests were excellent, at over 2 million tonnes of maize, with large sweet potato and cassava crops. However, it appeared that Southern Africa was entering a decade of subnormal rains and 1997 and 1998 were a foretaste of this. The harvests of 2001, 2002 and 2003 were disappointing, that of 2004 was severely deficient in maize and in root crops; the next <b>satisfactory</b> <b>harvest</b> was in 2005. Average rainfall was light in the 2000/01 and 2003/04 growing seasons, locally high in 2001/02 and 2002/03: it was characterised by too much or too little rain at the wrong time or place. Between 2001 and 2004, Malawi produced more food in than in 1992 or 1994, but as its population was much higher, more maize had to be imported, and difficulty obtaining imports created internal food shortages in these years. Rural poverty increased and by 2005, about 14% of Malawian adult were HIV positive. Disabilities and deaths from AIDS may have discouraged growing labour-intensive tobacco or maize in favour of cassava, reducing family incomes and coping resources.|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the safety and}} efficacy of plerixafor, subsequent to disease-specific chemotherapy followed by granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), in 37 multiple myeloma (MM) or lymphoma patients, who were candidates for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) predicted as poor mobilizers (PMs). Patients were identified as predicted PMs according {{to the history of}} a previously failed mobilization attempt or the presence of ≥ 1 factors predicting an unsuccessful harvest, such as advanced disease, prior extensive radiotherapy, or prolonged treatment, with stem cell poisons, advanced age, or extensive bone marrow involvement. Plerixafor (0. 24 mg/kg) was administered subcutaneously for up to 3 consecutive days while continuing G-CSF for 9 to 11 hours before the planned apheresis. Plerixafor administration was safe and no significant adverse events were recorded. We observed a median 4 -fold increase (range: 1. 4 - 32) in the number of circulating CD 34 (+) cells following plerixafor compared with baseline CD 34 (+) cell concentration (from a median of 5 cells/μL, range: 1 - 32, to a median of 32 cells/μL, range: 6 - 201). Twenty-seven of the 37 patients (14 of 17 with MM and 13 of 20 with lymphoma) had ≥ 2 × 10 (6) CD 34 (+) cells/kg collected in 1 - 3 apheretic procedures. Of the 27 patients rescued with plerixafor, 24 (13 MM, 11 lymphoma) have been transplanted with plerixafor-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells, showing a rapid and durable hematologic recovery. Our results suggest that the addition of plerixafor to G-CSF after disease-oriented chemotherapy is safe and allows for a <b>satisfactory</b> <b>harvest</b> in order to perform a safe ASCT, in a relevant proportion of lymphoma and MM patients considered to be PMs...|$|E
40|$|The pejibaye, Bactris gasipaes H. B. K., is an {{important}} fruit common {{in some areas of}} the American Tropics and unknown in others. It is a palm native to South American forests, and was introduced to Central America in pre-Columbian times, but is still seldom found in the Caribbean and other tropical areas. The palm has several spiny trunks that each bear several multifruited panicles yearly. The fruits contain a single seed. The trees are usually propagated from seeds, but better techniques are needed to preserve selected trees as clones. The trees are adapted {{to a wide variety of}} tropical soils and climates, and so far, few important diseases have been found. When mature, the fruits are harvested by a variety of techniques, none of which is very <b>satisfactory.</b> <b>Harvested</b> fruit is easily damaged and damaged fruits rot rapidly. Mature fruits are boiled, and the pulp is eaten fresh, made into a meal, or macerated to make a drink. The seed is also edible. The palm cabbage is also harvested, usually from old trunks that are being removed anyway.

40|$|Skin {{scrapings}} from {{a patient}} with Pityriasis versicolor were plated on a bile salt medium containing 10 % glycerol (for cryoprotection) andPityrosporum orbiculare was harvested for freeze-fracture replication. Resting and budding cells were seen. The overall pattern of indentation of the plasma membrane towards the cytoplasm was well revealed s a spiral arrangement of major indentations with minor ones disposed more or less at right angles. Hexagonally-arranged particles were not observed. Mitochondria were elongated with constrictions at intervals, and the fracture face of the limiting membrane directed towards the exterior exhibited linear arrays of particles. An unusual type of organelle was also present, viz: a membi'ane-limited vesicle with regularly-spaced depressions r "dimples". Pityrosporum orbiculare is a lipophylic fungus responsible for Pityriasis versicolor; it can be grown in culture from skin scrapings (Caprilli, Mercantini, Nazarro Porro, Passi & Tonolo, 1971). Previous thin-section studies o f the fungus in skin (Pi 6 rard & Dockx, 1972) and in culture (Keddie & Barajas, t 969), have established its main ultrastructural features. These reports {{provide a basis for}} the present description and analysis of its structure as revealed by using the technique of freeze-fracture plica-tion to examine the organism grown in culture. MATERIALS AND METHODS Skin scrapings {{from a patient}} with Pityriasis versicolor were plated onto a bile salt medium (van Abbe, 1964) containing 10 ~ glycerol (for cryoprotection) and incubated at 30 °C for 3 days. Growth of fungus was <b>satisfactory.</b> <b>Harvested</b> material was packed in small-bore (1 mm) stainless steel tubes and rapidly frozen, without chemical fixation, in isopentane. Specimens were then transferred to an apparatus (Stolinski, 1973) for fracturing and replication as described elsewhere (Breathnach, Gross & Martin, 1973). "Etching", or sublimation of specimens was not performed andrepl icas were examined in a Phillips EM 300 electron microscope.

40|$|Pre-harvest {{sampling}} {{has proved}} to be a useful tool at Mhlume. Graphs are presented showing the improvement in the sucrose content of Mhlume's cane at the mill compared with that of the outgrowers over a 5 -year period. The method of sampling and analysis is discussed in detail. The data from the 2 seasons when the 8 - 10 internode sample was used are presented and the different correlations between the various cane analyses and the tons cane: tons sucrose ratio are discussed. It is concluded that the 8 - 10 internode- sample and the whole stalk sample taken together give the most <b>satisfactory</b> guide to <b>harvest</b> scheduling at Mhlume...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiment}} {{aimed at}} determining repeatability coefficients for four methods (analysis of variance, principal components-correlation and covariance matrices and structural analysis), number of harvests necessary to increase accuracy and phenotypic {{stability of yield}} characteristics of accessions of Panicum maximum. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design with 35 genotypes and three replications. Five cuts were made and material was weighed and dried to obtain total, stem, leaf and dead forage dry matter yields. The repeatability coefficients in the different methods, for the evaluated characteristics, ranged from 0. 1867 and 0. 6583. The estimates of repeatability coefficients obtained for the evaluated characteristics by analysis of variance were generally smaller than the ones obtained with the other methods. By the principal components (based on the covariance matrix), the estimates were usually larger than those for the other methods. Therefore, {{it is possible to}} recommend this method to estimate the coefficient of repeatability for traits evaluated in this study. Considering that levels of 80 or 90 % of confidence in the evaluation of the relative superiority of the accessions for all the evaluated characteristics are <b>satisfactory,</b> five <b>harvests</b> are sufficient for the choice of the best accession. ...|$|R
40|$|As most grown grapevine Vitis vinifera {{varieties}} {{are susceptible to}} diseases such as downy and powdery mildews, numerous treatments are required to ensure a <b>satisfactory</b> yield and <b>harvest</b> quality. However, the use of phytochemi cal fungicides has serious drawbacks : {{some of them are}} potentially harmful for the envir onment and human health and contribute to the selection of resistant pathogen st rains. Nowadays, in an object ive of sustainable viticulture, there are increasing societal request, political incitation and winegrower’s awareness to reduce the use of pesticides. For these reasons, alternative / complementary strategies of protection are under research. In our laborat ory, we are studying the activation of the grapevine defense reactions by compounds called elicitors. Regarding the elicitor-induced resistance of grapevine leaves against downy and powdery mildews, promising results have been obtained in greenhouse conditions but this strategy is still not controlled in the vi neyard conditions. We propose to present {{the state of the art}} concerning induced resistance in grapevine : from concept to vineyard application...|$|R
40|$|Owing to {{its water}} holding capacity, {{sphagnum}} {{has been used}} by people for hundreds of years. Currently it is being harvested commercially on the West Coast of the South Island, New Zealand. It is largely to supply Japanese horticultural companies. Resource extraction has increased rapidly in recent years and much basic information regarding the resource, the industry and the implications of use has been entirely lacking previous to this study. Resource characteristics are described in terms of sphagnum ecology. Sphagnum is adapted to life in wet, nutrient poor, peat producing ecosystems. Five species of sphagnum are recorded from the West Coast; the harvested species, S. cristatum, is most common. Sphagnum mires do not provide habitat for many species of plant or animal but some rare and uncommon species are present. The history of sphagnum use is outlined and current use and the West Coast industry described. The industry has increased in size rapidly since late 1979; numerous individuals and several large companies are currently involved. High net revenues are available to companies and individuals in the industry which is small with few people employed full time; it is restricted in size by market constraints. Sustainable yield harvesting is achievable; yields may be increased through intensive management or cultivation. Much of the sphagnum resource is on state owned land and is managed by the Department of Lands and Surveyor New Zealand Forest Service. Various management procedures are used, some of which have not been <b>satisfactory.</b> Sphagnum <b>harvesting</b> is compared as a land use with farming and forestry on similar land. From a national economics stance it has higher net benefits per hectare than the other options. The sphagnum industry is sustainable in its present form although the market is sensitive to product quality. Sphagnum harvesting affects adversely the mire ecosystem, displacing some components and reducing the overall environmental quality; these impacts are less than those of the other land use options. It is more labour intensive than sheep and beef cattle farming; numbers employed per hectare are similar to dairy cattle farming and forestry after forest maturity. Sphagnum harvesting has potential as a long term land use and is appropriate for land supporting substantial amounts of sphagnum. Management options are discussed with reference to various objectives. It is recommended that policies enabling sphagnum harvesters to have exclusive rights over areas for extended periods be designed and that reserves are established to preserve sphagnum mires and the various component species...|$|R
40|$|When {{faced with}} a choice, humans and animals {{commonly}} distribute their behavior {{in proportion to the}} frequency of payoff of each option. Such behavior is referred to as matching and has been captured by the matching law.  However, matching is not a general law of economic choice. Matching in its strict sense seems to be specifically observed in tasks whose properties make matching an optimal or a near-optimal strategy.  We engaged monkeys in a foraging task in which matching was not the optimal strategy.  Over-matching the proportions of the mean offered reward magnitudes would yield more reward than matching, yet, surprisingly, the animals almost exactly matched them.  To gain insight into this phenomenon, we modeled the animals' decision-making using a mechanistic model. The model accounted for the animals' macroscopic and microscopic choice behavior. When the models' three parameters were not constrained to mimic the monkeys' behavior, the model over-matched the reward proportions and in doing so, harvested substantially more reward than the monkeys. This optimized model revealed a marked bottleneck in the monkeys' choice function that compares the value of the two options. The model featured a very steep value comparison function relative to that of the monkeys. The steepness of the value comparison function {{had a profound effect on}} the earned reward and on the level of matching.  We implemented this value comparison function through responses of simulated biological neurons.  We found that due to the presence of neural noise, steepening the value comparison requires an exponential increase in the number of value-coding neurons.  Matching may be a compromise between <b>harvesting</b> <b>satisfactory</b> reward and the high demands placed by neural noise on optimal neural computation...|$|R
