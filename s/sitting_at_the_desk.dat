500|$|In season seven's [...] "Kara", {{while looking}} into Lex's {{research}} projects, Lois discovers an alien spaceship. Her attempt {{to craft a}} news story out of the situation lands her {{a job at the}} Daily Planet—in the basement alongside her cousin Chloe. While at the Daily Planet, Lois begins a new relationship with her editor Grant Gabriel (Michael Cassidy) in the episode [...] "Wrath". Their relationship comes under scrutiny from Chloe and Lex in [...] "Blue", with Chloe seeing it as a reason for co-workers to doubt Lois's true ability as a journalist, and Lex believing it will jeopardize the secret of Grant's true identity. In [...] "Gemini", the two finally agree to part ways. In the season eight premiere, Lois believes that Lex is responsible for Chloe's arrest by the Department of Domestic Security, and goes to his mansion to search his files for her location. She eventually discovers Chloe's whereabouts and arrives, alongside Clark, to save her. In [...] "Plastique", Lois takes Clark under her wing—teaching him how to be a reporter—after he accepts an internship at the Daily Planet, <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> directly across from Lois. Her feelings for Clark become stronger as the season progresses, admitting in the episode [...] "Committed" [...] that she is in love with Clark, and stating to Oliver in the episode [...] "Bride" [...] that she has never felt this way about someone before. In the same episode, she almost shares a kiss with Clark before being interrupted by the arrival of Clark's ex-girlfriend Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk). In the season eight finale, Lois and Tess Mercer (Cassidy Freeman), Lex Luthor's handpicked successor to LuthorCorp, get into a physical fight at the Daily Planet. During the fight, Lois picks up a Legion ring that falls out of Clark's desk and is instantly transported to another time and place.|$|E
500|$|The ride {{experience}} was different in its earlier years. Passengers would enter under {{the middle of}} the coaster's lift. After entering an eerie space soundtrack played. The first room was [...] "Mission Control". Black lights lit the room. Travel posters and a rocket diagram were on the side walls. Two airport loading gates were seen next to two TV monitors (showing the head of the company [...] "The Dispatch Master" [...] or random space pilots) and were on either side of a desk in the middle. An employee <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> would say to the riders that the loading gates on were both malfunctioning and the riders had to be rerouted through the [...] "service rooms" [...] of the hangar. Walking into the next room deemed [...] "Rocket Recovery", guests would see a [...] "rocket locator" [...] robot named [...] "Dave" [...] working up on a platform at a terminal trying to contact the companies rockets (one according to him crashed outside of Akron). Walking down another hallway, guests could glance at crates inside of a warehouse within the building. After the short hallway, guests entered the [...] "Repair Bay". A room showcasing a [...] "binocular security camera" [...] robot named [...] "Franc" [...] looking around the room (he was later removed). There were also suspended conveyor baskets carrying various items, a high voltage generator, pneumatic robotic arms [...] "repairing" [...] a rocket, and a security scanner that flashed [...] "REJECT" [...] after scanning guests.A small room outside the Repair Bay had the company's logo subtlety broken to reveal the ride's true name. Entering the [...] "Launch Area" [...] rockets moved from behind a curtain without passengers. After ten people loaded on a rocket the ride began. The rocket moved out on a block section where an [...] "on-board computer" [...] welcomed you and started the [...] "automatic launch sequence". Two spinning laser light spheres projected a star field around the rocket as it climbed the lift. Upon reaching the top your computer takes notice of nearby [...] "space pirates" [...] and begins to perform abrasive maneuvers. As riders went through the coaster, they would see exploding rockets, meteors, laser projections, and a satellite that shot lasers. Your on-board computer shouts [...] "I'm losing control, I'm losing control!" [...] before an Alaskan landscape came into view and the rockets entered the brake run. Riders entered the unloading station where they were greeted by an employee that yells [...] "WELCOME TO ALASKA!" [...] The riders disembarked their vehicle and exited on the left.|$|E
2500|$|After a {{demo version}} of the album was put down in Artane, Dickens {{requested}} to have it re-recorded digitally at a more professional studio as the analogue equipment used at Aigle had created an abundance of tape hiss, causing the music to suffer. Nicky found the quality of Enya's multi-track vocals had also diminished, leaving them the only option of re-recording them, though he later found digital record had lost [...] "warmth in the bottom end". With studio time booked at Orinoco Studios in Bermondsey, London, Enya and Nicky re-recorded and mastered Watermark with Ross Cullum who carried out co-production, engineering, and mixing duties. [...] "Storms in Africa" [...] and [...] "Orinoco Flow" [...] were completed on the studio's two Mitsubishi 32-track recording machines. Away from the [...] "intimate and personal" [...] setting of recording in Ireland, Enya found working in London more difficult as the busy city caused many distractions. Cullum completed {{the majority of the}} album's mixing at Wessex Sound Studios, with Jim Barton credited as the mixer on [...] "Orinoco Flow". During the final stages of recording, Enya tripped on a step which resulted in two cuts to her knee. She continued to work, [...] "taking these heavy pain-killers, <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk,</b> in the studio with one foot propped up on cushions."

Mr. Carter was <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> and got up to shake hands with Philip. He was dressed in a long frock coat. He looked like a military man; his moustache was waxed, his gray hair was short and neat, he held himself upright, he talked in a breezy way, he lived at Enfield. He was very keen on games and the good of the country. He was an officer in the Hertfordshire Yeomanry and chairman of the Conservative Association. When he was told that a local magnate had said no one would take him for a City man, he felt that he had not lived in vain. He talked to Philip in a pleasant, off-hand fashion. Mr. Goodworthy would look after him. Watson was a nice fellow, perfect gentleman, good sportsman--did Philip hunt? Pity, THE sport for gentlemen. Didn't have much chance of hunting now, had to leave that to his son. His son was at Cambridge, he'd sent him to Rugby, fine school Rugby, nice class of boys there, {{in a couple of years}} his son would be articled, that would be nice for Philip, he'd like his son, thorough sportsman. He hoped Philip would get on well and like the work, he mustn't miss his lectures, they were getting up the tone of the profession, they wanted gentlemen in it. Well, well, Mr. Goodworthy was there.

40|$|Iam {{not what}} I think I am. I’m not what youthink I am. I’m what I think you think Iam ” (Neal, cited in Wormeli, 2003, p. 175). To me, this {{statement}} {{of a middle}} school student’s perception exemplifies why {{it is essential for}} a developmentally responsive middle school to provide an adult advocate for every student. Each of our students needs at least one adult at school whom they know believes the best, knows the best, and wants the best for them. As a seventh grade teacher, I strove to advocate for all of my students, but despite my best efforts, I knew there were students who were missed and days when my lesson objective overshadowed <b>the</b> people <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>desks.</b> In This We Believe in Action (Burkhardt & Kane, 2005) stated, “If teachers expect students to be engaged learners, they must communicate to those students that they are cared for, respected, welcomed, and appreciated ” (p. 67). Research on middle level best practices revealed that an effective student advisory program allows middle schools to meet this objective. Unfortunately, this important component of a responsive middle school still remains largely elusive (Anfara, et al., 2003). A study of middle level teachers, parents, and students cited in Johnston (2005) found that although 75 % of teachers and 68 % of parents believe in the goals of advisory programs, only 32 % of teachers and 40 % of parents thought the program was realizing those goals.
