40|$|The {{susceptibility}} {{of a land}} {{surface to}} wind erosion is highly sensitive to changes in soil erodibility. Nonetheless, the performance of wind erosion models continues {{to be affected by}} the accuracy of their erodibility representations. There is thus an ongoing need for robust approaches for assessing and modelling <b>soil</b> erodibility <b>dynamics.</b> This paper provides a critical review of research into the controls on <b>soil</b> erodibility <b>dynamics.</b> The review focuses on progress in understanding temporal changes in soil aggregation and crusting as they influence the erodibility of agricultural and rangeland soils, and identifies deficiencies in approaches for resolving the nature and causes of spatio-temporal patterns of erodibility change. A conceptual model of <b>soil</b> erodibility <b>dynamics</b> is developed to represent erodibility changes within a single erodibility continuum. The model is used to identify ongoing research questions that are central to developing new measures and a deeper understanding of <b>soil</b> erodibility <b>dynamics,</b> and representations of soil erodibility for wind erosion and dust emission models. Finally, available soil erodibility metrics are evaluated {{in the context of their}} application in addressing these research needs, and new and alternate approaches for reducing the complexity of soil erodibility assessments and models are identified.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of these NASA-funded projects {{is to improve}} our understanding of land-use impacts on <b>soil</b> carbon <b>dynamics</b> in the Amazon Basin. Soil contains approximately one half of tropical forest carbon stocks, yet the fate of this carbon following forest impoverishment is poorly studied.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Soil {{moisture}} is a {{key variable}} in dryland ecosystems. Knowing how {{and to what extent}} soil moisture is influenced by rainfall and non-rainfall waters (e. g., dew, fog, and water vapor) is essential to understand dryland dynamics. The hyper-arid environment of the Namib Desert with its frequent occurrence of fog events provides an ideal place to conduct research on the rainfall and non-rainfall effects on <b>soil</b> moisture <b>dynamics.</b> Rainfall and <b>soil</b> moisture records was collected from three locations (gravel plain at Gobabeb (GPG), sand dune at Gobabeb (SDG), and gravel plain at Kleinberg (GPK)) within the Namib Desert using CS 655 Water Content Reflectometer and tipping-buckets, respectively. The fog data was collected from the FogNet stations. Field observations of rainfall and soil moisture from three study sites suggested that <b>soil</b> moisture <b>dynamics</b> follow rainfall patterns at two gravel plain sites, whereas no significant relationships was observed at the sand dune site. The stochastic modeling results showed that most of <b>soil</b> moisture <b>dynamics</b> can be simulated except the rainless periods. Model sensitivity in response to different soil and vegetation parameters was investigated under diverse soil textures. Sensitivity analyses suggested that soil hygroscopic point (sh), field capacity (sfc) were two main parameters controlling the model output. Despite <b>soil</b> moisture <b>dynamics</b> can be partially explained by rainfall, <b>soil</b> moisture <b>dynamics</b> during rainless period still poorly understood. In addition, characterization of fog distribution in the Namib Desert is still lacking. To this end, nearly two years’ continuous daily records of fog were used to derive fog distribution. The results suggested that fog is able to be well - characterized by a Poisson process with two parameters (arrival rate and average depth). Field observations indicated that there is a moderate positive relationship between soil moisture and fog at GPG and the relationship tend to be less significant at the other two sites. A modified modeling results suggested that mean and general patterns of soil moisture can be captured by the modeling. This thesis is of practical importance for understanding <b>soil</b> moisture <b>dynamics</b> in response to the rainfall and fog changing conditions...|$|R

The models include increasingly complex representations of leakage and evapotranspiration processes. We force the models with the local rainfall, and we determine model parameters with a least-square minimization procedure. We study separately summer and annual dynamics. When we use the models to reproduce annual dynamics, we include a simple representation of the annual cycle of evapotranspiration. We test the models both in simulation mode, estimating their parameters from the same data used to verify them, and in forecast mode, determining the model parameters from one period, and using them to forecast <b>soil</b> water <b>dynamics</b> in a different period. The results indicate that simple box models can estimate <b>soil</b> water <b>dynamics</b> at midlatitudes, using rainfall as the only meteorological driver.
