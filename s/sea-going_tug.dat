50|$|There was an {{increased}} need for boats {{to act on}} the salvage and rescue of ships attacked and damaged on the high seas, for which the civilian fleet was not sufficient. To meet this need the Admiralty placed an order for 64 <b>sea-going</b> <b>tugs</b> to operate in this capacity. These were to a single design, based on a civilian type, and, as they were built by specialist shipyards, incorporated merchant rather than navy features. However it was specified they be armed and equipped with radio.|$|R
50|$|Assigned to the Puget Sound Navy Yard {{the same}} day, Mohave {{operated}} in the Bremerton‑Seattle area {{and off the}} coast of Washington on various towing assignments into 1918. Because of the desperate need created by World War I for <b>sea‑going</b> <b>tugs</b> in the Atlantic Ocean, she was detached from Puget Sound Navy Yard 6 February 1918 and sailed ten days later for the east coast. Steaming via Mare Island and San Diego, California, various Mexican ports, the Panama Canal, and Key West, Florida, the ship reached Norfolk, Virginia, on 29 April, and following operations along the east coast and two towing voyages to Bermuda, was temporarily assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service (NOTS) on 6 August.|$|R

50|$|Patuxent {{spent her}} naval career {{operating}} with the U.S. Atlantic Fleet, providing {{the services of}} a <b>sea-going</b> <b>tug</b> to diverse elements of the fleet. She served during World War I, and {{in the aftermath of the}} war was outfitted as a minesweeper and took part in 1919 in the sweeping of the North Sea Mine Barrage. When the U.S. Navy adopted its modern hull code system on 17 July 1920, she was redesignated USS Patuxent (AT-11).|$|E
5000|$|The Nantuo 181 class tug is a {{class of}} little known naval {{auxiliary}} ship currently in service with the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN). [...] The name of this class is after the first unit commissioned, with the exact type still remains unknown, because the only official information released by the Chinese government is that this class is {{a new generation of}} 9000-hp class <b>sea-going</b> rescue <b>tug,</b> and that a total of three of this class have been confirmed in active service as of the mid-2010s.|$|R
5000|$|At {{one time}} USS McCloy held {{the record for}} largest {{military}} drug bust at 49.5 tons of marijuana (late 1980s). A <b>sea-going</b> <b>tug</b> was forcefully boarded after an over night chase while the tug's crew tossed bales of cocaine overboard and weapons fire was released the following morning at dawn. One of the tug's crew was wounded by [...]50 caliber gunfire and was helo'd off. A Coast Guard detachment estimated the amount and {{an attempt was made}} to tow the tug to port. The tug had too much damage and sank in the night after several attempts to salvage her.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, Hydro Tasmania gained {{state and}} federal {{approval}} to recharge the lake with seawater drawn from the sea outside Macquarie Harbour {{at the mouth of}} the Gordon River. This involved having a <b>sea-going</b> <b>tug</b> draw up around 1.4 million litres of salt water in lots of around 100,000 litres, and discharge the water through a diffuser that allowed the seawater to settle into the lower salt layer. (See diagrams at Hydro Tasmania press release, 18 June 2004) This was completed and the results confirmed in April 2005. However, it was noted that, if no natural recharging occurs, the process of recharging may need to be repeated in about 10-15 years.|$|E
5000|$|On 4 February 2014 Michael Murphy participated with {{aviation}} {{forces from}} the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps in joint training exercise Koa Kai. Participating units conducted integrated flight operations, anti-surface and anti-submarine training. On 28 February, the Royal Canadian Navy ship [...] suffered a fire and breakdown approximately 340 nmi km northeast of Pearl Harbor that left the ship stranded without power, lighting or water. Michael Murphy (already operating underway) was immediately dispatched to assist in her towing and recovery efforts. Michael Murphy received 17 {{family members of the}} crew and two civilian contractors from Protecteur; however, due to adverse weather conditions, Michael Murphys attempts to take her under tow were unsuccessful. The cruiser [...] arrived two days later and successfully connected and towed the stricken ship until the hawser broke. The <b>sea-going</b> <b>tug,</b> , arrived on 2 March and assumed the towing duties and returned Protecteur to Naval Station Pearl Harbor on 6 March.|$|E
