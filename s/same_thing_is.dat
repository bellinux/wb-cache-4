500|$|Newton {{later became}} {{involved}} in a dispute with Leibniz over priority {{in the development of}} calculus (the Leibniz–Newton calculus controversy). Most modern historians believe that Newton and Leibniz developed calculus independently, although with very different notations. Occasionally {{it has been suggested that}} Newton published almost nothing about it until 1693, and did not give a full account until 1704, while Leibniz began publishing a full account of his methods in 1684. (Leibniz's notation and [...] "differential Method", nowadays recognised as much more convenient notations, were adopted by continental European mathematicians, and after 1820 or so, also by British mathematicians.) But such a suggestion fails to account for the content of calculus in Book 1 of Newton's Principia itself (published 1687) and in its forerunner manuscripts, such as De motu corporum in gyrum ("On the motion of bodies in orbit") of 1684; this content has been pointed out by critics of both Newton's time and modern times. The Principia is not written in the language of calculus either as we know it or as Newton's (later) 'dot' notation would write it. His work extensively uses calculus in geometric form based on limiting values of the ratios of vanishing small quantities: in the Principia itself, Newton gave demonstration of this under the name of 'the method of first and last ratios' and explained why he put his expositions in this form, remarking also that 'hereby the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> performed as by the method of indivisibles'.|$|E
500|$|The album {{has been}} {{described}} as alternative metal, nu metal, hard rock and rap rock by professional reviewers. Shinoda described the album's sound as a 1990s style of rock record: [...] "It's a Rock record; [...] "it's loud and it's Rock, but not in the sense of what you've heard before, which is more like '90s hardcore-punk–thrash". He described the [...] "weak" [...] status of modern rock in the music industry as an inspiration in recording a heavier rock album; to try to bring the sound of the 1990s back to the forefront. Shinoda criticized the modern state of alternative radio, stating [...] "There’s so much stuff that sounds like HAIM or CHVRCHES or Vampire Weekend that I’m full. The thing I’m hungry for is not that. I turn on the rock station in L.A. and it sounds like Disney commercial music.” This led to a response from CHVRCHES, with their lead singer Lauren Mayberry calling Shinoda's comment [...] "a pointless dig." [...] Bennington agreed with Shinoda's comments, as he said, [...] "The bands I was listening to when I was growing up were all doing really innovative shit—Jane’s Addiction, Alice in Chains, Nirvana... Bands like the Refreshments and the Rembrandts, that music fucking angers me to this day. And the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> happening now, where there’s all this stuff that feels like the soundtrack to 'Friends' or 'The Wizards of Waverly Place.'” ...|$|E

2500|$|Other {{scholars}} underlined however that, {{to a great}} extent, Solomos did {{not care}} about the completion of his poems. A phrase attributed to the poet is illustrative: [...] "Lampros will remain an abstract, because the whole poem does not reach the height of some days". Linos Politis notes on the fragmentary nature of the Free Besieged: [...] "He did not want or did not care to incorporate these lyrical pieces into a narrative group [...] He stuck to the pure, lyrical expression, {{without regard to the}} non-lyrical linking substance, thus advancing [...] to the conquest of a 'pure' lyrical sphere, long before his time. We detected something similar in Kritikos too and the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> applied to the rest of his 'fragmented' works". [...] Later on, Solomos was considered by several poets and critics as the forerunner of [...] "pure poetry" [...] and the fragmented nature of his work did not [...] "disturb" [...] any more; on the contrary, it was considered as an advantage.|$|E
2500|$|In 1933 Chicharro {{was active}} {{mixing with the}} Alfonsist monarchists in the Tradicionalistas y Renovación Española alliance; by the local Castellon Liaison Committee he was agreed to {{represent}} it in the forthcoming elections. This gained him hostility among new radical Carlist activists like Jaime del Burgo, who despised fraternization with caciques and debris of the Alfonsine monarchy. Moreover, for the Carlist youth the landowners like Lamamié and Chicharro became marked men as privileged section of politically dominant potentates, who are [...] "obstructing the Agrarian Reform by the feudal egoism of the odious grandees of grain". Though indeed within Carlism Chicharro formed the most reactionary faction, conservatism did not render him averse to new radical social movements. Discussing Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler he declared that Traditionalism, “though not one and the <b>same</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>is</b> very sympathetic towards them, as they are waging war against Judaism, freemasonry and Marxism, building an organized corporative state. What is inacceptable to us is the state's overwhelming sovereignty and dominance.

2500|$|Adorno saw {{the culture}} {{industry}} as an {{arena in which}} critical tendencies or potentialities were eliminated. He argued that the culture industry, which produced and circulated cultural commodities through the mass media, manipulated the population. Popular culture {{was identified as a}} reason why people become passive; the easy pleasures available through consumption of popular culture made people docile and content, no matter how terrible their economic circumstances. [...] "Capitalist production so confines them, body and soul, that they fall helpless victims to what is offered them." [...] The differences among cultural goods make them appear different, but they are in fact just variations on the same theme. He wrote that [...] "the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> offered to everybody by the standardized production of consumption goods" [...] but this is concealed under [...] "the manipulation of taste and the official culture's pretense of individualism". By doing so, the culture industry appeals to every single consumer in a unique and personalized way, all while maintaining minimal costs and effort on their behalf. Consumers purchase the illusion that every commodity or product is tailored to the individual's personal preference, by incorporating subtle modifications or inexpensive [...] "add-ons" [...] {{in order to keep the}} consumer returning for new purchases, and therefore more revenue for the corporation system. Adorno conceptualized this phenomenon as pseudo-individualisation and the always-the-same.|$|E

2500|$|Expert trails include DJ's Tramline, {{a narrow}} trail that descends via {{a series of}} cliff steps. The trail is rarely open because {{of the amount of}} snow {{required}} to cover the boulders and cliffs scattered throughout the trail. DJ's Tramline has been included in Vermont Sports Magazine's [...] "Gnarly 10 Toughest Trails in the East". There are no double Black Diamonds on Cannon Mountain, only Black Diamonds, although the color/shape nomenclature for trail rating is always relative to the other trails on the mountain. The Tramline, for example, could earn double black diamond at another mountain, and the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> possible in the reverse. It is therefore recommended that skiers take careful note of the mountain's average challenge, and to proceed with caution when attempting a new run labeled as [...] "advanced" [...] or [...] "experts only". Besides the Tramline, Avalanche is the steepest run, measuring at a 31 degree vertical pitch. Trails such as Paulie's Folly and Hard Scrabble also have a high vertical pitch. The Mittersill area consists of some of New Hampshire's only sidecountry skiing. Many glades and mogul runs can be found here. One of the longest glades in the east is Kinsman Glade, on skier's right of the tramline. The Front Five trails are accessed via Paulie's Extension or Lower Cannon. Three of them, Avalanche, Paulie's Folly and Zoomer, are marked black. The other two, Rocket and Gary's, have less pitch and no bumps. From the summit, trails include Cannonball, Skylight or Upper Ravine.|$|E
2500|$|For a {{grapheme}} to {{be represented}} by various glyphs means that the grapheme has glyph variations that are usually determined by selecting one font or another or using glyph substitution features where multiple glyphs are included in a single font. Such glyph variations are considered by Unicode a feature of rich text protocols and not properly handled by the plain text goals of Unicode. However, when the change from one glyph to another constitutes a change from one grapheme to another—where a glyph cannot possibly still, for example, mean the same grapheme understood as the small letter [...] "a"—Unicode separates those into separate code points. For Unihan the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> done whenever the abstract meaning changes, however rather than speaking of the abstract meaning of a grapheme (the letter [...] "a"), the unification of Han ideographs assigns a new code point for each different meaning—even if that meaning is expressed by distinct graphemes in different languages. Although a grapheme such as [...] "ö" [...] might mean something different in English (as used in the word [...] "coördinated") than it does in German, {{it is still the}} same grapheme and can be easily unified so that English and German can share a common abstract Latin writing system (along with Latin itself). This example also points to another reason that [...] "abstract character" [...] and grapheme as an abstract unit in a written language do not necessarily map one-to-one. In English the combining diaeresis, [...] "¨", [...] and the [...] "o" [...] it modifies may be seen as two separate graphemes, whereas in languages such as Swedish, the letter [...] "ö" [...] may be seen as a single grapheme. Similarly in English the dot on an [...] "i" [...] is understood {{as a part of the}} [...] "i" [...] grapheme whereas in other languages, such as Turkish, the dot may be seen as a separate grapheme added to the dotless [...] "ı".|$|E
