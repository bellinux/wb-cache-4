40|$|Abstract. Micro grid can {{integrate}} various distributed {{generators and}} provide local load with green energy. Therefore, {{it becomes a}} hot spot of research in every country all over the world. Due to small inertia, large number of models, big difference among internal electric sources of Micro grid operation, {{it is more difficult}} to keep stabilization of voltage frequency of common points in the network, and more complicated to control the problems. The article puts forward the improved droop control strategy based on distributed power supply layer, on the basis of traditional droop control, it increases the feed forward regulation mechanism so as to change the droop coefficient, increase the power regulation scope, speed up the common point frequency voltage stability and improve the control precision, which has realized the specific control of power output when the Micro grid <b>synchronizes</b> <b>and</b> <b>closes,</b> as well as the purpose of power distribution according to load demand for islanding. Finally, we use power system simulation software PSCAD/EMTDC V 4. 4 to verify the practicability of the proposed scheme...|$|R

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the Journal, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part D: Journal of Automobile Engineering [© IMECHE]. The definitive version is available at: [URL] ideal function of a valvetrain system is to <b>synchronize</b> the opening <b>and</b> <b>closing</b> of the inlet and exhaust valves with the required thermodynamics of the combustion process. As such, ideally a kinematic-type mechanism is desired. However, the timing requirements in the action of each valve and between any inlet-exhaust pair necessitate the use of contacting pairs of suitable profiles. The very existence of contact renders the problem one of complex non-linear dynamics, which is further exacerbated by the translational imbalance of the reciprocating compliant elements such as the valve itself. The interplay between these various forms of dynamics, inertial, structural, and impact/contact, make the problem quite complex to analyse. As a result, {{some of the most important}} problems with valvetrains are only surmised at, rather than fundamentally understood. The multiphysics modelling approach proposed in this paper renders a better understanding, as well as conforming to experimental observations...|$|R

40|$|Motivated by {{suggestions}} that binaries with almost equal-mass components ("twins") {{play an important}} role in the formation of double neutron stars and may be rather abundant among binaries, we study the stability of <b>synchronized</b> <b>close</b> <b>and</b> contact binaries with identical components in circular orbits. In particular, we investigate the dependency of the innermost stable circular orbit on the core mass, and we study the coalescence of the binary that occurs at smaller separations. For twin binaries composed of convective main-sequence stars, subgiants, or giants with low mass cores (M_c ~ 0. 15 M), we find that stable contact configurations exist at all separations down to the Roche limit, when mass shedding through the outer Lagrangian points triggers a coalescence of the envelopes and leaves the cores orbiting in a central tight binary. In addition to the formation of binary neutron stars, we also discuss the implications of our results for the production of planetary nebulae with double degenerate central binaries. Comment: 17 pages, accepted to ApJ, final version includes discussion of planetary nebulae with central binaries and a new figure about shock heating, visualizations at [URL]...|$|R

40|$|The {{theory of}} Connectology sets forth three psychologically founded {{synaptic}} learning mechanisms that may describe {{all aspects of}} animal learning. Of particular interest to this thesis is the learning of animal motion behavior, or, more specifically, the development of <b>synchronized</b> <b>and</b> repetitive movement patterns - gaits. Computer simulations are performed according to the methodology of computational neuroethology: Artificial neural networks are simulated operating in a tight feedback loop with a structurally simple but mechanically realistic body and a physically realistic environment. Neural network learning is purely synaptical and is performed solely within the lifetime of one such ANN-controlled system. Additionally, the configuration parameter space is searched by means of genetic algorithms. Simulation results show examples of <b>synchronized</b> <b>and</b> repetitive movement patterns developing when neuronal and mechanical model parameters are appropriately specified. These simulations thereby provide the first examples known to us of a fully unsupervised and self-organized artificial neural system that synaptically learns <b>synchronized</b> <b>and</b> repetitive motor control. In spite of limited mechanical model complexity, the most efficient movement patterns to some degree resemble the gaits seen in nature. </p...|$|R
