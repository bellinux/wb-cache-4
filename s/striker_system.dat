5000|$|The Model 1895/99 {{also used}} an {{enclosed}} <b>striker</b> <b>system,</b> {{rather than an}} exposed hammer, {{and was the first}} mass-produced enclosed striker type rifle. The striker firing system, as used in the model 95 and 99, is superior to hammer type system because they have less mass, and achieve quicker ignition. The enclosed nature of the <b>striker</b> <b>system</b> prevented dirt and fouling from accumulating in the system. A hammerless rifle was therefore a substantially superior gun. The Model 95/99 also possessed a rotary magazine which allowed the use of pointed or [...] "spitzer" [...] type bullets which was not possible in period tubular magazine rifles.|$|E
5000|$|Working {{closely with}} Rousseau, Potter {{designed}} the Cynergy's reverse <b>striker</b> <b>system</b> which assured very fast lock times. He created a striker type ejection system and integrated a toggle-type safety/selector. Potter's design assured good function with the mechanical triggers via a design utilizing an inertia block that prevents doubling while preserving fast lock times.|$|E

50|$|According to the manufacturer, {{the pistol}} was under {{development}} {{for more than}} four years before its release in June 2014. Heckler & Koch has a long history with striker-fired pistols. As Hk was no stranger to making striker-fired pistols, they decided to update their current line-up with a newly designed <b>striker</b> <b>system</b> that gives their pistols a single stage like trigger feel with a clean break.|$|E
5000|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is based}} on The King of Fighters '99 and expands on the [...] "Striker Match" [...] format introduced in that game. The game now has an Active <b>Striker</b> <b>System,</b> which allows the player to summon the Striker member during any situation, whether the player is attacking or being attacked by the opponent, allowing the player to use their strikers in combos. Additionally, the player can now replenish Strike Bombs by either losing rounds or taunting the opponent (at the expense of one filled stock of the Power Gauge).|$|E
50|$|New Gen Electra & PilotThe new {{generation}} Electra and Pilot electric markers were {{introduced into the}} Spyder community in 2008. They were designed with a shorter body reverting to the old style valve and <b>striker</b> <b>system</b> of the past, replacing the gen II balance valve system used in the RS & VS markers. They are equipped with a regulator and run at a relative 300psi low pressure from the box. This generation Spyder is a streamlined version that is short and comfortable, light, fast with advanced electronics and has about every upgrade of the past including a metal locking feedneck.|$|E
5000|$|The Ruger American Pistol is a polymer-framed, {{semi-automatic}} pistol {{introduced by}} Ruger in December 2015. The pistol uses a pre-tensioned <b>striker</b> firing <b>system,</b> and is chambered in 9mm Luger and [...]45 ACP. The pistol uses a Browning-type locked-breech short recoil action, with a barrel cam {{system that is}} designed to reduce felt recoil. The serialized part of the pistol is a steel chassis, which is fit to a glass-filled nylon frame. The frame incorporates a Picatinny rail for mounting accessories.|$|R
40|$|Instrumented <b>striker</b> <b>systems,</b> dial indicators, {{and optical}} {{encoders}} {{are widely used}} for measurement of absorbed energy in both conventional and miniature Charpy tests. It has been observed that the total absorbed energy measured using these technologies, while generally in good agreement, sometimes differs by a significant amount. This paper presents experimental evidence from high speed photography of Charpy tests that the differences between dial/encoder energies and instrumented striker energies (measured with U-hammers) can largely be explained by post-fracture collisions with the striker. Further, experimental and numerical studies show that dynamic elastic deformations of the pendulum and striker, as well as load cell errors due to contact load distribution and inertial effects, can also significantly contribute to the energy differences for some test machine designs. Experimental evidence from the literature that was originally expected to show the significance of residual vibrational energy in the test machine may actually show that low energy Charpy specimen behavior can be significantly affected by {{the design of the}} test machine. A simple dynamic model of a specimen and test machine system shows that a 20 % increase in the stiffness of the striker and hammer assembly can lead to a 9 % decrease in the energy required to fracture a low energy Charpy specimen...|$|R
2500|$|The FV102 Striker was the Anti-tank {{guided missile}} {{version of the}} CVR(T). The British Army ordered 48 of the version, which were armed with the Swingfire missile <b>system.</b> <b>Striker</b> had five {{missiles}} ready to fire in a mounting {{at the rear of}} the vehicle, with another five stowed inside. Secondary armament consisted of a commander's 7.62mm GPMG and multi-barrelled smoke grenade dischargers. Striker looked very similar to Spartan in appearance, becoming more easily identifiable [...] only when the missile tubes were raised. Striker is no longer in service since the Swingfire missile was replaced by the Javelin in mid–2005.|$|R
5000|$|A third {{installment}} {{based on}} the Xtreme Xecutor anime, called Ikki Tousen: Xross Impact (Ikkitōsen Kurosu Inpakuto), was developed by Tamsoft for the PlayStation Portable and released on April 28, 2010 in Japan. It features a new character named Ato, the Japanese counterpart of Liu Shan along {{with the return of}} Ukitsu as a playable character, and Chinkyu, Bashoku, Kyocho, and Shibai are added as playable characters. The game adds a [...] "Super Arts" [...] bar, tag-team battles and combos, and the addition of the alternate <b>striker</b> <b>system.</b> The gameplay was also revamped to include an aerial pursuit rave and a Finishing Screen.|$|E
50|$|The pre-loaded {{internal}} striker is {{a variant}} of the partially cocked <b>striker</b> <b>system</b> of the Walther P99 Quick Action model. When the trigger is pulled, the already partially cocked striker is fully cocked and released, firing the pistol. An indicator {{on the back of the}} slide shows if the striker is partially cocked. The 'QuickSafe' trigger variant main difference with the Walther P99 Quick Action trigger is that removing the PPS pistol's backstrap will disable the gun for safe storage by decocking and blocking the striker until the backstrap is reinstalled.The PPS has a trigger travel of approximately 6 mm and a trigger pull of approximately 27 N. Unlike many other trigger systems preset internal strikers have a let-off point and trigger pull that remains unchanged from the first shot to the last and requires no decocker.|$|E
5000|$|Various {{video game}} {{publications}} have {{commented on the}} game, with GamePro giving it {{three and a half}} stars out of five. The game was criticized by GamePro because the new gameplay of strikers [...] "simply doesn't fit in the King of Fighters series, though, and is more of a novelty than a game mode." [...] Although they complained about the quality for the PlayStation port, they liked that the loading times became shorter. However, Andrew Seyoon Park of GameSpot found the PlayStation port to be very good considering the limitations from the console. He gave it a 6.6, complaining about the animation and the voices. Additionally, he found the reduction of characters from KOF '98 to be disappointing, noting also that the boss Krizalid is very hard to beat. The Dreamcast port also received a 6.6 by Park, who found it much better than the PlayStation version, but still found the game disappointing. He noted the <b>striker</b> <b>system</b> to be [...] "clearly derived from the tag system from Capcom's Marvel fighting games" [...] and complained about how there are popular characters who only appear as strikers in the game when he wanted them to be fully playable. IGN's Anthony Chau gave it an 8.5, commenting that although [...] "people are probably tired of 2D fighting games, saying that they all play the same", he found KOF '99: Evolution to be very distinct. He found the new gameplay to be very entertaining despite knowing some [...] "KOF purists hate the Striker system".|$|E
50|$|In January 2011, Paweł {{together}} with his twin brother Piotr, joined Turkish Süper Lig side Trabzonspor on a two-and-a-half year deal for an undisclosed fee from Wisła Kraków. Brożek made his debut for Trabzonspor in a Turkish Cup match against Beşiktaş on 26 January 2011, assisting Alanzinho's goal with a back-heel pass. In the 2010-11 Süper Lig season, he contributed with two goals and two assists for the eventual runners-up. In the following campaign, Brożek could not establish himself in the Trabzonspor starting line-up, blocked by Turkish international Burak Yılmaz, who played as the sole <b>striker</b> in the <b>system</b> preferred by coach Şenol Güneş.|$|R
40|$|Direct impact Hopkinson {{pressure}} bar systems offer many potential advantages over split Hopkinson {{pressure bar}}s, including access to higher strain rates, higher strains for equivalent <b>striker</b> velocity and <b>system</b> length, lower dispersion and faster achievement of force equilibrium. Currently advantages are gained at a significant cost: {{the fact that}} input bar data is unavailable removes all information about the striker impacted specimen face, preventing the determination of force equilibrium, and requiring approximations {{to be made on}} the sample deformation history. Recently photon Doppler velocimetry methods have been developed, which can replace strain gauges on Hopkinson bars. In this paper we discuss an experimental method and complementary data analysis for using Doppler velocimetry to measure surface velocities of the striker and output bars in a direct impact bar experiment, allowing similar data to be recorded as in a split bar system, with the same level of convenience. We discuss extracting velocity and force measurements, and improving the accuracy and convenience of Doppler velocimetry on Hopkinson bars. Results obtained using the technique are compared to equivalent split bar tests, showing improved stress measurements for the lowest and highest strains...|$|R
40|$|Strongly {{nonlinear}} waves {{were investigated}} experimentally, numerically and ana- lytically in two-mass and one mass systems. Experimental setups consist of one dimen- sional assembly of elastic stainless steel spheres or cylinders with different masses layered alternatively. When such assembly is not compressed, the sound speed is zero therefore {{creating a new}} state called “sonic vacuum”. Such systems does not supports sound waves but strongly nonlinear solitary waves can propagate in it. Band-gap phenomenon was observed and discussed for strongly nonlinear and nonlinear quasi-harmonic excitations in two-mass systems. Formation and transformation of short, strongly nonlinear stress pulses were investigated in granular systems with different mass ratios, but with the same contact. Dissipation in the system with mass ratio close to 1 was faster than in the system with mass ratio 0. 55. This {{is contrary to the}} expected behavior of corresponding non dissipative <b>systems.</b> <b>Striker</b> impact generates a single solitary wave or a train of solitary waves depend- ing on the mass ratio between the striker and the particle mass inside the chain. Imaginary scenarios of striker interacting with a single mass, that’s called “effective mass”, will be discussed to model the striker interaction with a collective of particles. This approach is based on two conservation laws. It satisfactorily predicts the upper estimate for the linear momenta, energies and amplitudes in the train of solitary wave in far field depending on the relative mass of the striker and particles in the chain...|$|R
