40|$|Introduction Researchers {{frequently}} include multiple cultivars {{and fertility}} levels in field experiments. Therefore, the experiments sowing operation must represent a considerable saving {{in time and}} labor, compared to hand sowing. Greater flexibility in experimental design and setup could be achieved by equipment that enables quick changes in the cultivar and fertilizer rates from one plot to the next. A satisfactory seed drill must distribute a given quantity of seed evenly over a predetermined length of coulter row, the coulters must be spaced at exact intervals and depth of sowing must be uniform. In a self-propelled type of plot seeder, no coulter should run in a wheel track as the compaction of the soil can cause observable differences in vigor between plants in such a row and those in un-compacted rows. The machine should sow in succession from a try in which a series of seed pocket separated clearly and must be put into distributer funnel by an assistant operator. The length of gap being varied according to the nature and purpose of the plot. The objectives of this experiment were 1 - to design and construct a local self-propelled plot seeder and 2 - To compare it with the imported (Wintersteiger) plot seeder in cereal breeding programs. Materials and Methods A small-plot seeder was designed and constructed to meet this objective. The unit consists of the following basic components: a toolbar for pulling a set of six blade coulter, an air compressor for lifting and putting down the openers and metering transmission drive wheel, an operators chair and work rack, one belt seed distribution. A cone-celled and rotor <b>seed</b> <b>distributor</b> is used for seed distribution to the openers. The cone system {{is connected to the}} gearbox and allows for great flexibility in changing cultivars, crop species, and plot length. This is driven by the separate drive wheel. The cone-celled distributor sows all the seed of the sample in making one complete turn. The spinner can be equipped with a 4 or 6 outlet delivery head, depending on row spacing. The planter is fitted with hoe openers. Alternatively, spear-point openers have sometimes been used under conventional tillage systems. Seeding depth control was achieved by an adjustment screw handle. The plot seeder is being moved by a 9. 6 kW engine, and has been successfully used in applications. Field experiment established by using 4 plot length (2, 3, 4 and 6) with 4 replication by the constructed plot seeder and imported plot seeder. Crop measurements were planted height, spike m- 2, seeds/spike, Thousand kernel weight, Biological and grain yield, harvest index and drill measurements were seeding depth, uniformity of row spacing in action, seed counter performance, power requirement, slippage evenly of rows after planting. Results and Discussion Results showed that there were significant differences between the plant emergences. The emergencies were higher in plots, which planted by the new plot seeder. The differences between seed distribution of openers were insignificant, but the variances of new plot seeder and imported plot seeder were 0. 267 and 1. 05 respectively. Mean planting depth of plots planted by the Wintersteiger plot seeder was 0. 8 cm shallower than the adjusted planting depth while mean planting depth in plots planted by constructing machine had only 0. 01 cm variation. Results of variance analysis revealed that effect of treatments on wheat grain yield and yield components was significant. So that, highest grain yield (4216 kgha- 1), biological yield (8704 kgha- 1), number of spikes per square meter (649 spike), obtained from a plot which planted by constructed plot seeder. Increasing yield of treatments which planted by constructed plot seeder might be because of increasing the number of spikes per square meter in those treatments. The mean of spike per square meter in plots of new planter was 691 spikes which were 116 spike more than plots planted by imported plot seeder. Conclusions The constructed plot seeder had up to 18500 cost reduction. The seeder was able to distribute the different type of seed to the seed tubes uniformly in laboratory tests, nevertheless it is necessary to test the constructed plot seeder in field condition by using different seed type and conducting new research project. Advantages of this planter include less variation of seed fall down in different coulters, perfect planting depth control, separate wheel for adjusting planting length, minimize the slippage of planter driven wheel and proper utility in different field condition. According to effects on crop parameters the constructed plot seeder had relative priority to imported one. In addition easily accessories supply and cheaper prime cost are profit of the designed and constructed plot seeder...|$|E
40|$|The {{past few}} months have seen a spate of major {{companies}} getting together across the globe. It really is wild out there in 'merger mania' land, with big organisations gobbling up small ones and giants climbing clumsily into the same bed. There are big implications for ACP agriculture and food security. If {{you were looking for}} proof that the world has gone crazy, you would simply need to look back to the last few months of the past century and the opening months of the new one. You would conclude that whilst some of humanity s follies regional wars and climate change induced by human activities to mention but two continue unabated and unchanged, respect for the traditional laws of the market place appears to have been absolutely forgotten. Energy prices have soared to levels unknown since the 1970 s, pushing up the price of a bus journey from Yaoundé to Douala in Cameroon to over $ 7. In Europe, a young airline headed by a lad in blue jeans sells tickets that allow you to fly from England to Spain that s over five times the distance from Yaoundé to Douala for less than $ 20, and it claims this is profitable. In the Netherlands, in March 2000, a company selling services on the Internet announced annual losses of $ 10 million and was sold on the Amsterdam stock exchange for about $ 25 billion more than some ACP countries net worth. No wonder market analysts, and the man and woman on the street, are left shaking their heads in incomprehension. Driven by the need to maximise profits and obsessed with cost-cutting efficiency, companies worldwide are rushing to become the fittest of all, and to thus ensure their survival. The method many choose is the time-honoured practice of buying out suppliers and taking over competitors. It has happened in market places ever since traders first came together to barter and exchange. Nowadays, the language used by such companies hostile take-overs reflects the rough-and-tumble of such transactions, whereas other terms, such as strategic alliances and permanent partnerships, are less than economical with the truth in describing how big fish eat small fish. At first sight, {{it would seem that the}} dire predictions made in the heady 1960 s, about the control of the world economy falling into the hands of a few transnational corporations, are now coming true. It is easy to make a simple calculation, particularly in the area of agriculture, to 'prove' this point of view. During part of the past decade, the US corporation Monsanto expanded its activities from its established base of chemical engineering into the Brave New World of genetic engineering, focused on seed manipulation. Where has this taken the company? It is an often told story: the company identified a smart way to lock farmers into a permanent relationship by ensuring that they had a need for their products. One ploy was to introduce the so-called terminator gene into improved seed varieties of essential crops. By halting the natural process whereby plants generate their own seeds, this gene would mean that growers would no longer be able to select and store seeds from one harvest for growing the next. The idea has not gone ahead, at least not yet. Opinions are divided about it, to put it mildly. The chair of the Monsanto board passionately believes that by ensuring the continued high quality of its seeds, his company would make a significant contribution to world food security, as well as to its long-term profit margins. Cynics say that the latter objective, seen as greed, far outweighs the moral objective, seen as self-interested protectionism. So it may seem, but people who sit in boardrooms have a mixed bag of motives for doing what they do: a wish for personal wealth, a feeling of responsibility to the workforce and the company s dependent communities, a similar responsibility to shareholders and customers, and a general social commitment to, for example, equitable and sustainable food production. Monitoring trends The dramatic implications of the Monsanto initiative were seized upon by such bodies as GRAIN in Barcelona, Spain, and the Rural Advancement Foundation International (RAFI) based in Manitoba, Canada. The mission of these non-governmental organisations is to promote and protect existing seed supply systems as part of the fabric of today s rural world, with special emphasis on countries of the South. They monitor trends that may endanger that equilibrium and they campaign against any undesirable developments. And campaign against the terminator gene they did, to such effect that Monsanto, not helped by some classic public relations blunders, announced towards the end of a turbulent 1999 that it was suspending its work on the programme. Mergers, conquests, value-added partnerships: what s in a name? Photo Corbis While the campaigners were prematurely celebrating their 'victory', Monsanto went ahead and continued a long-term strategy of mergers with related companies. The largest of its many steps along this road was to join forces with the American corporation Cargill, the largest <b>seed</b> <b>distributor</b> in North America, with activities worldwide. In January 2000, the Monsanto Corporation effectively disappeared from the map, by renaming its latest incarnation. Even if its work on the terminator gene continues to be suspended, the fact remains that much of the world s future seed supply and, equally awesome, of its research on new varieties is now concentrated in the hands of one transnational conglomerate. Similar trends are taking place in related fields of life science research: companies involved in the manufacture of agrochemicals, vaccines, and veterinary products and pharmaceutical companies like Ciba-Geigy, Rhône-Poulenc, Bayer, Hoechst have been moving in and out of mergers in the last few years, creating massive corporations with misty new names like Novartis and Aventis. The consequence of pooling programmes and patents again concentrates the knowledge of professional researchers with, some say, grave results for the future of Southern research, the ownership of indigenous knowledge, and the availability of scientific information. Their merging also tightens the links between research and the market place, with worrying forecasts that medical research priorities will be distorted. Some critics predict that research on new and resurgent strains of malaria will be dropped, since it is not as profitable as, for example, research on cosmetics based on plant materials from the rainforest. All along the food chain, mergers are concentrating power and profitability and are apparently eroding whatever flimsy influence the small farmer, trader, shipper, or processor ever had. In the field of finance, global mergers of banks are further marginalising ACP national banking services, enforcing attitudes of retrenchment and risk reduction not the sort of thinking that will encourage the innovative, and ultimately profitable, rural savings and credit schemes that are often essential to food security. Mergers and margins Perhaps the largest clouds on an already stormy horizon are in the allied fields of telecommunications and information. In Europe, North America and the Pacific Rim countries, transnational media corporations of unimaginable size are taking control of the means to exchange information, whether verbal, written or electronic, through mass media or between individuals. What, the everyday ACP agriculture professional may well ask, are the possibilities now for rural communication networks? How can the African Information Society (the jargon term for an Africa that participates fully on the global Internet and uses ICTs in all aspects of its economies and culture) flourish if it is primarily seen as a loss-making venture, with perhaps some market potential in five decades from now? And once the means to share are controlled by a few, and out of control of the many, will these few not start to dictate the content too? What will be the future for all our exciting networks of decentralised market information systems, women s banking programmes, alternative and fair trade, or specialised research? Merger mania is in the air, and not just in commercial enterprises. Non-governmental organisations in Europe are merging madly, as did the Dutch development co-funding agencies Bilance Cordaid. Environmental movements and trade unions, nationally and globally, have seen the values of pooling their work. National governments are slowly learning the benefits of partially merging, or at least sharing, their agendas. Regionalisation, whether in ACP or European terms, is also a form of merging. It might seem kind of funny, but merger mania may provide new opportunities for people who tend to think of themselves as being on the margin. Most mergers are in fact subject to the scrutiny and control of the stakeholders, in this case, the shareholders of transnational corporations (TNCs). Their accountability is often greater than that of many of the organisations that claim to operate in, and even to represent, civil society. Maybe the sincere partnerships developed by such TNCs in the food chain as Danone, Nestlé and Accor with suppliers and trade unions provide a model for moving forward, and away from a fear of mergers. Partnerships and openness there have to be. After the first wave of ACP independence there were several schools of thought that promoted self-reliance and autarchy, and 'de-linking' from the rest of the world. Globalisation, which barely allows such thinking today, may not be ours in the making, but surely it has to be ours in the taking.

50|$|The {{best way}} to prevent and {{minimize}} summer patch damage is by using disease-resistant turfgrass species/cultivars. To find these new cultivars one can visit turfgrass <b>seed</b> <b>distributors,</b> extension specialists, or visit the National Turfgrass Evaluation Program website at: http://www.ntep.org. If incorporating disease resistant varieties of turfgrass is not an option, then focus on better management practices. These practices should help promote adequate drainage, reduce soil compaction, and a balanced fertility program. Install an internal drainage system if you have severe drainage problems. An adequate aeration program will relieve compaction and improve drainage. Aeration should annually disrupt between 15-20% of the total surface area. Avoid using quick-release fertilizers; try using slow-release ammonium sources. If the soil pH is above 6, then use ammonium sulfate, which will acidify the soil. Turfgrass {{has been shown to}} be most resistant to summer patch when soil pH is between 5.5 and 6. Most balanced fertility programs for Kentucky Bluegrass lawns will consist of applying two to five lbs of nitrogen/1000 sq.ft. a year. Promote root growth by watering heavy and infrequently. Since low mowing heights are conducive to shallow rooting, raising the height of cut can possibly result in less summer patch injury.|$|R

Improve air circulation and avoid irrigation practices that will leave moisture on the grass blades for extended periods of time. An adequate aeration program will relieve compaction and improve drainage. Aeration should annually disrupt between 15-20% of the total surface area.

40|$|The {{marketing}} of Genetically Modified varieties took place from 1996 / 97 onward ; {{it led to}} harsh debate about their relevance for Developing countries (DCs). The actual use of Genetically Modified Cotton (GMC) in countries regarded as DCs (mainly South Africa, China, India), since 1997 / 98, provides materials to go beyond theoretical discussion. This use pertains to Bt-Cotton which results from the integration of an external gene controlling {{the production of a}} toxin against some cotton bollworms. There is yet some abundant literature to point out the positive impacts of GMC in terms of technical effectiveness, profitability, and environment and health externalities, {{as a result of the}} reduction in chemical sprays.

40|$|Graduation date: 1993 The {{ecology of}} netleaf {{hackberry}} (Celtis reticulata Torr.) is poorly known throughout its broad western range. To gain {{some understanding of}} the species' basic ecology, three components of its life history were studied. First, seed germination requirements were analyzed under laboratory conditions. Second, hackberry population dynamics were evaluated from tree size and age structures. Lastly, an examination of hackberry's response to fire was made, using tree-level post-fire data. A higher percentage of non-stratified hackberry seed germinates if the seed is mechanically scarified. While germination percent is low, the treatment may eliminate the 120 -day stratification period recommended by some authorities. Even with cold stratification, germination is usually quite low for Celtis species. Fermenting fruits for 72 hours and subsequent depulping prior to scarification did not significantly increase germination levels, as hypothesized. However, seed that was not scarified but was fermented with its pulp intact germinated {{at a higher rate}} than the non-fermented, non-scarified seed. This result may be significant to its biology. Seed is typically cleaned prior to planting by <b>seed</b> <b>distributors.</b> However, hackberry <b>seed</b> with its pulp retained may in fact have a superior germination rate, as it is allowed to undergo natural processes of fermentation resulting from moist field conditions. In Idaho, hackberry's uniquely fragmented distribution appears to be controlled by a variety of factors. Hackberry is generally restricted to semi-arid portions of the state where temperatures are least severe during the winter months, such as in moderated river canyons, or at elevations below 1600 m. It occurs in a variety of habitats, from riparian to upland, however it is most abundant on sites with a southeast-to southwesterly aspect and a rocky surface cover. The presence of rock below the surface may be equally important, but this factor was not quantified. Hackberry is a slow-growing species in Idaho, averaging 3. 9 m tall at 50 years. Differences in hackberry growth rate under a variety of site conditions were evaluated by a site index constructed from the log-log regression of height on age. Trees reach maximum heights where topographic shelter is greatest, such as in draws, and where soils are loamy. However, well-drained soils may be important, as nearly all soils had some sand or skeletal component. Hackberry can be long-lived, with the maximum age recorded at 374 years; the average age was 66 years (N = 959 trees). Hackberry appears to be reproducing, in spite of habitat degradation caused by livestock overgrazing, alien plant invasion, and increasing fire frequencies. However, newly established even-aged stands are rare and are generally found along waterways on stream terraces or at high water lines. In these areas, surface rock cover was typically high, with the rock providing a moderated below-ground microclimate, as well as protection from herbivores. Recruitment is favored by rockiness at the surface, but growth rates of established individuals are not higher with more surface rock. Under severe livestock grazing pressure, stands had a single dominant cohort and lowered recruitment. Fire-caused mortality of hackberry growing in low density stands appears to be uncommon in Idaho.

A critical aspect of simulation {{is the ability}} to evaluate large-scale systems within a reasonable time frame while modeling complex interactions between millions of components. However, modern simulations face limitations in provisioning this functionality for CPSs in terms of balancing simulation complexity with performance, resulting in substantial operational costs required for completing simulation execution. Moreover, users are required to have expertise in modeling and configuring simulations to infrastructure which is time consuming. In this paper we present Simulation EnvironmEnt <b>Distributor</b> (<b>SEED),</b> a novel approach for simulating large-scale CPSs across a loosely-coupled distributed system requiring minimal user configuration. This is achieved through automated simulation partitioning and instantiation while enforcing tight event messaging across the system. SEED operates efficiently within both small and large-scale OTS hardware, agnostic of cluster heterogeneity and OS running, and is capable of simulating the full system and network stack of a CPS. Our approach is validated through experiments conducted in a cluster to simulate CPS operation. Results demonstrate that SEED is capable of simulating CPSs containing 2, 000, 000 tasks across 2, 000 nodes with only 6. 89 times; slow down relative to real time, and executes effectively across distributed infrastructure...|$|R
40|$|The {{protection}} {{of intellectual property}} rights has been a contentious issue over the last 20 years. Industrialized nations have moved to knowledge-based economies and simultaneously trade barriers have fallen, making intellectual property vulnerable. Adding to this vulnerability are conflicting international institutional environments, belief systems, and economic realities. The debate over IPR protection has become a significant global trade issue pitting the net- technology producing North against the net-technology consuming South. The North maintains a comprehensive IPR institutional environment and actively employs enforcement mechanisms. The South on the other hand, is more conflicted. While {{in the last ten}} years many Southern countries have agreed to multilateral agreements on IPR protection, enforcement and real commitment has been lagging. With this in mind there has been much debate about the impact of alternative IPR regimes (tight or loose) on the welfare of Southern economies. Policy makers in both the South and the North search for arguments to convince recalcitrant Southern countries to follow the Northern model of strict IPR regimes. The South faced with a dilemma, searches for arguments to justify loose IPR regimes or alternatively to convince its populace that tighter IPR regimes are better for the nation. While there has been much analytical work, mostly theoretical, conducted on the subject, the final results are inconclusive whether a strong IPR regime is better or worse for Southern countries. The lack of clarity as to the impact of IPR regime has in part been due to the level of analysis. The theoretical models, while being extremely valuable highlighting the drivers of firm and social welfare, are by their nature abstractions and have produced contradictory conclusions. The empirical models have been limited focusing on either secondary aggregated data and proxy variables to uncover the relationship between IPR and economic outcome or qualitative surveys asking managers to describe the impact of weak IPR. One of the predicaments of empirical analysis in this area is trying to measure or assess the investment not made. For example in some research, investigators are forced to asked business leaders hypothetical questions as to what might they do if the institutional environment were different, i. e. IPR were protected. Our research takes a different empirical approach using the case study method and the unique setting of the corn and soybean seed business to actually measure how the lack of IPR protection distorts the strategy and investment behavior of a firm. Due to the agronomic differences between corn and soybeans, corn is naturally protected from IPR pirating while soybeans are not. In a Northern setting, the business are run in parallel with similar investment, human resource needs, and marketing strategies. In a Southern setting we hypothesize that there will be significant and measurable differences due to the firms' inability to protect its intellectual soybean technology. This research will document and quantify the impact on the firm. The firms' behavior indirectly effects the country as it shifts it physical and human capital investment. This too will be quantified. Finally the welfare gain to farmers from lower prices and wider access to new biotechnologies will also be empirically measured. Our research empirically analyzes hypotheses derived from the current theory on IPR with the purpose of providing evidence on the welfare impacts of weak IPR. The empirical setting is Pioneer Hi-Bred a global leader in agricultural seed production and sale. We focused on the Argentinean division which is uniquely appropriate for the study of the IPR question. The two leading products of Pioneer are corn and soybeans. These crops are complements and are used in rotation. Corn's intellectual property is naturally protected from piracy by the hybridization process. Because it is self-pollinating, soybeans (and the valuable Roundup Ready® technology) are very vulnerable. The study used the following sources of evidence: key informant interviews, direct observation, and quantitative data (financial documents analysis and industry statistics). The informant interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview instrument on managers and field staff within Pioneer, managers of competing firms, government officials, trade associations, <b>seed</b> <b>distributors</b> and multipliers, and producers. Direct observation was conducted on location at Pioneer R&D, production and distribution facilities. Financial document analysis was conducted using balance sheet, and income data at the business unit level and internal marketing research documents provided by Pioneer as well as secondary data on the industry. All interviews and site visit were digitally videotaped. Interviews were then transcribed and analyzed using QSR NUD-IST®, a text analysis software tool. We hypothesize that there will be sharp differences between the corn and soybean business units not found in a Northern setting. These differences will reflect the "investment not made" that has been so elusive to other empirical studies. Theory predicts that there will be differences in quality and quantity of infrastructure investment, differences in supply chain relationships, differences in resource needs, differences in human resource management, and differences in financial performance. At the firm level if such differences exist it would indicate that there are different business strategies for different IPR environments even though the traded products are identical. Finally and equally important the study will measure the impacts on the host country in terms of human capital, under investment, reduced cash flow, and smaller knowledge spillovers. These impacts plus the welfare gains from lower prices and wider product distribution will comprise our assessment of the economic impact of weak IPR.

40|$|The key {{questions}} {{which will be}} addressed in this report are: • Which variety characteristics are important for organic farming and are they different from conventional farmers demand? • What is an “appropriate“ variety for organic farming? • Is the actual variety offer available to organic farmers satisfactory? Is it different per crops type and/or per geographic area? • How should variety trials be conducted in order to supply the information needed by organic operators? The main answers may be synthesized as follows: Characteristics of varieties {{to be used in}} organic farming are partly different from the ones requested in conventional farming. Main differences are related to yield stability, processing properties and root-system development; The definition of “appropriateness”, related to variety for organic farming, is not easy to state as it may involves different aspects, depending on perspective (producers, processor, trader etc.). A list of characters that should be considered within the “appropriateness” concept is presented in the report; Among involved Members States experts there is no common evaluation of the actual variety availability: in general if for cereals there is a reasonably good level of availability, for vegetables and fodder crops mixtures the situation is never very positive even if it varies greatly among Member States; Valuable guidelines for cereal variety testing in organic farming have been produced by the COST 860 action “SUSVAR” (Sustainable low-input cereal production: required variety characteristics and crop diversity) and they are summarized in the report; Guidelines for vegetable variety testing are difficult to identify as among vegetables species the characteristics and requirements are very different. In the report some indications are reported. Recommendation for variety evaluation and testing in organic farming Several recommendation result from the report. For clarity sake they have been grouped in 3 parts, depending on which institution they are aimed to: Recommendations to EU and international authorities: • To implement the possibility offered by EU directives on seed trading (EEC Dir. 66 / 4021; EEC Dir. 66 / 4012 and EC Dir. 2002 / 553) to run controls on seeds for organic farming additional to the routine controls. This possibility may be used to evaluate variety appropriateness to organic farming conditions and consequently orientate the choice of varieties that seed companies offer to the organic sector. • To consider specific variety traits requested by organic farming systems in the test for variety inclusion into the registers of varieties. Recommendations to Member States: • To keep record of the variety requested for derogation and make it public. It may be a useful instrument for seed producers’ orientation. • To include specific local (National/Regional) demands from organic farmers in the variety trials. It means to include varieties that are supposed as fit to organic conditions by farmers but also to include specific characteristics in the evaluation criteria. • To promote public breeding for organic farming and to support spin-off of seed companies dedicated to organic seed production. A low-cost option may be participatory breeding that combines the advantages of introducing variety traits asked for by organic producers and facilitate dissemination. Recommendations to other stakeholders: • To involve nurseries in the debate about organic variety choice as they result to be an important bottle-neck for the use of organic seeds in vegetable production. • To promote timely programming of variety used and amounts of seed needed among producers in order to facilitate <b>seed</b> producers and <b>distributors</b> {{but at the same time}} to grand producers the right variety choice...|$|R
