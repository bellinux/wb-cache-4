5|$|Stone Rollin expands on the {{traditional}} soul music style of his 2008 album The Way I <b>See</b> <b>It,</b> <b>with</b> exploring rhythm and blues, rock, funk, and blues styles. A widespread critical success and deemed by some reviewers as Saadiq's best work, the record was noted for its stylistic breadth, groove-based compositions, varied subject matter, and incorporation of the Mellotron keyboard. It also became Saadiq's highest-charting album in the United States, reaching number 14 on the Billboard 200. He supported the album with a concert tour spanning from March to August 2011.|$|E

Selling it to RCA for $24,000, {{it was used to}} promote Presley's latest film, Frankie & Johnny. The Cadillac tour proved to be somewhat more successful than the film itself. In Houston alone in one afternoon, 40,000 people paid to <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> <b>with</b> one woman offering to have sex with the tour manager if he would allow her to sit in it.|$|E
25|$|During Charlotte's {{lifetime}} {{friends and}} sponsors visited the parsonage, including Sir James and Lady Kay Shuttleworth, Ellen Nussey, Elizabeth Gaskell, John Store Smith, a young writer from Manchester, Bessie Parkes, who recounted her visit to Mrs. Gaskell, and Abraham Holroyd, poet, antiquarian, and historian. However, following {{the publication of}} the book and the pastor's public remonstrations, the parsonage became a place of pilgrimage for admirers wanting to <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> their own eyes. Charlotte's husband recalled that he had to protect his father-in-law, when on the short path to the church they had to push their way through the crowds of people wanting to reach out and touch the cape of the father of the Brontë girls. The hundreds of visitors became thousands, coming from all over Britain and even from across the Atlantic. Whenever he agreed to meet them, Patrick received them with utmost courtesy and recounted the story of his brilliant daughters, never omitting to express his displeasure at the opinions held about Charlotte's husband.|$|E

500|$|Soon after Europeans reached Ming China in {{the early}} 16th century, {{accounts}} of the Great Wall started to circulate in Europe, even though no European would <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> their own eyes for another century. [...] The work A Treatise of China and the Adjoyning Regions by Gaspar da Cruz (c. 152070) offered an early discussion of the Great Wall in which he noted, [...] "a Wall of an hundred leagues in length. And some will affirme to bee {{more than a hundred}} leagues." [...] Another early account written by Bishop Juan González de Mendoza (15501620) reported a wall five hundred leagues long, but suggested that only one hundred leagues were man-made, with the rest natural rock formations. The Jesuit priest Matteo Ricci (15521610) mentioned the Great Wall once in his diary, noting the existence of [...] "a tremendous wall four hundred and five miles long" [...] that formed part of the northern defences of the Ming Empire.|$|E

[...] Former Mojo editor Mat Snow describes Material World as [...] "a treat for the ears" [...] and, while conceding Harrison's limitations as a singer compared with Lennon and McCartney, he writes that Harrison [...] "worked hard to ensure the choruses of... 'Who Can See It' caught the ear with their deep and delicious emotion". In his review of the 2014 reissue of Harrison's Apple catalogue, for Classic Rock, Paul Trynka refers to Material Word as an album that [...] "sparkles with many gems"; of these, he adds, [...] "it's the more restrained tracks – Don't Let Me Wait Too Long, Who Can See It – that entrance: gorgeous pop songs, all the more forceful for their restraint." [...] New Zealand Herald journalist Graham Reid writes of Harrison [...] "sound battered by recent events and the Beatle legacy" [...] on [...] "Who Can See It", yet he cites the song as a [...] "standout" [...] on an album that [...] "can be very moving".|$|E

The cats see {{themselves}} as the first and most important species; the novel takes the approach that all creatures consider their kind to be the dominant species of the planet. Their myths view humans, or [...] "M'an", as a race of deformed descendants of cats. The book makes reference to mythologies of frogs, foxes and ravens as well as more thoroughly developing a system of cat mythology.|$|E

2500|$|After {{a friend}} {{recommended}} English actress Lena Headey for the role, Friedman watched her audition tape, and {{thought she was}} [...] "a tough, tough woman". Having seen The Terminator {{when she was a}} teenager, which [...] "scared the hell out of" [...] her, Headey was aware of the iconic status of the character and in regards to Linda Hamilton's portrayal of the role in the film series, she remarked, [...] "Linda Hamilton will always be the original Sarah Connor and it's a very strong print that she's left, but hopefully people will embrace what I bring to Sarah and <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> fresh eyes". When asked about her approach to the role, Headey said [...] "I'm playing a mother who is a single parent, bringing up a teenage son, who also happens to save the world—as a byline to her life. And the way I would play that is someone who's passionate and scared and angry and a mother, all these things. So I approach that just trying to be honest within the boundaries of her". However, the choice to cast Headey was criticized by several fans and critics who argued that she bore no resemblance to the athletic, muscular woman established by Hamilton, who transformed her body into that of a muscled warrior for Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The controversy was covered by the Los Angeles Times, the Boston Herald, and The Guardian, as well as in online forums.|$|E

2500|$|Steinberg {{dismissed}} many of Barr's views which favoured that Les Demoiselles D'Avignon {{could be}} reduced to a strictly formal figure composition. In particular that Barr argued that the intellectual observer would address the work was to view it in strictly formalistic qualities: the work was a triumph of form over content; to <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> intelligence was to see it resolved into abstract energies. Barr's methodology of addressing Picasso's work was not fundamentally challenged until Leo Steinberg’s article. Steinberg felt that by 1988 this method of critique had transformed from criticism to cliché and that reducing the work to a purely formal figure composition would make it a mere forerunner of things to come. Picasso had indeed abandoned the memento mori allegory but not the sexual thematics of the painting. Anna C. Chave for example in [...] "New Encounters with Les Demoiselles d'Avignon: Gender, Race, and the Origins of Cubism" [...] addresses that the work had come to be understood to mark or even to have precipitated the demise of the old visual order and the advent of the new. A momentous act of destruction, the painting is also understood as one of creation. Designated the first Cubist painting [...] "the signal for the Cubist revolution" [...] in its full-fledged dismantling of representational conventions the painting is now more loosely considered a curtain raiser or trigger to Cubism. Others had pulled crucial triggers before Picasso. When Baudelaire told Manet, [...] "You are only the first in the decrepitude of your art," [...] he referred to the scandalously frank picture of a courtesan, Olympia (Manet), rendered with startling flatness in 1865. For that matter, a compressed or compromised female form, often that of prostitute or femme fatale, would come to serve almost as an avatar of modernism.’ Picasso, often lifted his imagery from the lexicon of European art and by revisiting works, jolted the viewer into reacting to it afresh.” If the disintegration of the great traditions of painting could already be detected in Olympia, the evidence of that decrepitude was plainly that much further advanced in Les Demoiselles. And insofar as it calls the very notion unified style, and so the possibility of finish, into question, the painting's ruptured aspect made it serve the purpose of signifying a moment of rupture particularly well. The evolution of Cubism was impelled by a realization of [...] "the conventional rather than the imitative nature of representation", as art history professor Christine Poggi succinctly phrases it; and a corollary of that realization was [...] "that style can be a kind of mask, to be worn at will", so that [...] "there was no reason to observe the law of unity".|$|E
