2500|$|Eventually, Joseph Henning's {{financial}} struggles {{caught up}} to him, and he handed over {{the management of the}} theatre to John T. Jackson in 1894, who married Joseph's daughter, Huldah Henning. Together they managed the theatre with Henning ultimately handing over ownership of the theatre to John and Huldah in 1904. They owned and operated the theatre until its sale to Dennis Vanes in 1920. In later years Huldah's younger sister Josephine Henning Beyer {{had this to say about}} the Jackson management: [...] "Under the superb management of John T. Jackson, Coldwater received the joy of witnessing the very best of dramas, operas, bands and orchestras, and various other amusements in a then modern theatre." [...] With knowledge and experience that previous managers lacked, Jackson, the [...] "first 'theatrical man' to manage the Tibbits", was able to make the opera house financially successful for the first time and at a time when other opera houses were on the wane. Not only was he more successful at booking groups for performance, but in the 1890s, he also made improvements to the theatre to give it every modern advantage. Jackson redesigned scenery mechanisms, moved girders to add wing space, made ticket sales more efficient, installed electric fans for the comfort of the audience, added a sprinkler system and <b>steel</b> <b>fire</b> <b>curtain,</b> and updated the available electric current. He may be responsible for the theatre's longevity, since many other theatres were destroyed by fire.|$|E

After her return to the UK later that year, her Type 79Z radar was replaced by a Type 281 system and a Type 285 gunnery radar was mounted on one of the main fire-control directors. The additional crewmen, maintenance personnel and facilities needed to support these aircraft, weapons and sensors increased her complement to 1,326.|$|R
5|$|The BPF {{returned}} to action on 12 May and no Japanese aircraft were seen or detected that {{day or the}} next. One of Formidables Avengers made a successful landing aboard Indomitable with only one landing gear leg extended and no flaps on 13 May. The BPF continued its routine of two days of operations alternating {{with one or two}} days to replenish its ships for the next several days with minimal interference by the Japanese. On the morning of 18 May, armourers were loading ammunition into aircraft when a Corsair's guns were accidentally fired into an Avenger, which caught fire. The overhead fire sprinklers were immediately turned on, but the fire could not be extinguished for nearly an hour, not least because the electric motors driving the <b>steel</b> <b>fire</b> <b>curtains</b> had been damaged in the first kamikaze attack and could only be repaired by a dockyard. Twenty-one Corsairs and seven Avengers were either damaged or destroyed in the incident. Rawlings decided to detach Formidable early to give her extra time for repairs in Sydney and she was ordered to depart on 22 May.|$|R
50|$|The ship's {{dimensions}} {{as built}} were 500 ft length overall, 485 ft between perpendiculars, 58 ft molded hull beam, 97 ft extreme beam over guards with extreme depth of hull at stem being 30 ft and 23 ft molded depth. The hull was entirely steel {{with a double}} bottom extending almost 365 ft feet containing water ballast and divided lengthwise with a watertight bulkhead and by transverse bulkheads into fourteen compartments. Above that 3 ft ballast compartment the ship was divided by eleven watertight bulkheads extending from keel to main deck with hydraulic doors operated from the engine room. In total there were seven decks: tank top, orlop, main, promenade, gallery, upper and dome. Steel was used to the promenade deck with fire protection for beams above that level and fireproof doors provided compartmentalization and <b>steel</b> <b>fire</b> <b>curtains</b> in cargo spaces. For fire alarm purposes the vessel was divided into fifty sections with fire hydrants spaced so that permanently attached hoses reached every point in the vessel and an extensive sprinkler system.|$|R

50|$|A {{permanently}} installed <b>fire</b> <b>curtain</b> line set, though not used for productions, {{is a typical}} element of a theatrical rigging system installation. Building and fire codes typically require that either a <b>fire</b> <b>curtain</b> or water deluge system be installed to separate an audience from the stage {{in the event of}} a fire.|$|R
40|$|A <b>fire</b> <b>curtain</b> is use where, {{if there}} is a fire, it is {{necessary}} to create a temporary barrier within an opening, which seals off the area on <b>fire.</b> The <b>curtain</b> descends and prevents any fire and smoke from spreading from one area to another. It also allows people access to protected escape routes without any loss of fire resistance.

50|$|A {{second result}} of the fire was the {{requirement}} that an asbestos <b>fire</b> <b>curtain</b> (or sheet metal screen) be raised before each performance and lowered afterward to separate the audience from the stage.|$|R
50|$|In smaller theatres, {{a safety}} curtain {{is not usually}} required. Specifically, most United States {{building}} codes only require a <b>fire</b> <b>curtain</b> in theatres with a stage height of more than 50 ft. The heavy, flame-retardant house tabs can provide some degree of fire separation.|$|R
50|$|From the 1920s to 1975, a <b>steel</b> <b>fire</b> tower stood atop Reddish Knob.|$|R
50|$|Probably {{because of}} his early Chicago based background, Guérin was a {{frequent}} collaborator with the Chicago architectural firm (and the successor firm to Daniel Burnham’s practice) Graham, Anderson, Probst & White. Most notable of these commissions was the dramatic <b>fire</b> <b>curtain</b> for the theatre in GAPW's Chicago Civic Opera Building in 1929.|$|R
50|$|During {{construction}} of the theatre, some acoustic tests were carried out with the <b>fire</b> <b>curtain</b> in place while technical work was carried out on stage, but great consideration was given to balance between pit and stage. If the orchestra is small or absent, the pit can be covered and additional seats {{can be added to}} the auditorium.|$|R
50|$|HKU Station {{features}} designated refuge areas, {{to which}} passengers can be evacuated {{in case of}} emergency. Refuge areas are pressurised and equipped with fire systems including sprinklers and <b>fire</b> <b>curtains,</b> and independent power supply units. The HKU station is the first station in the MTR network to apply such shelter design {{and the use of}} lifts to reach safety.|$|R
25|$|The {{community}} theatre organization quickly {{grew and}} in May 1924, {{the citizens of}} Pasadena raised funds {{to build a new}} theatre in the city center at 39 South El Molino Avenue. Completed in 1925, the theatre was designed in a Spanish Colonial Revival style by Pasadena artist and architect Elmer Grey, with a <b>fire</b> <b>curtain</b> painted by Pasadena artist Alson S.

50|$|A safety <b>curtain</b> (or <b>fire</b> <b>curtain</b> in America) is a {{fire safety}} {{precaution}} used in large proscenium theatres. It {{is usually a}} heavy fibreglass or iron curtain located immediately behind the proscenium arch. Asbestos-based materials were originally used to manufacture the curtain, before the dangers of asbestos were widely publicized. The safety curtain is {{sometimes referred to as}} an iron in British theatres, regardless of the actual construction material.|$|R
5|$|In 1902 {{the theatre}} closed {{for nine months}} to enable {{extensive}} building work {{to be carried out}} in accordance with the terms of the Royal Charter. This involved a new staircase, the installation of electric lighting, a new <b>fire</b> <b>curtain</b> and hot water radiators throughout the auditorium. In 1905, on the anniversary of the opening of the Theatre Royal, numerous William Shakespeare's plays were performed by the company of actors led by Frank Benson.|$|R
50|$|Otto Strack {{employed}} many {{technological innovations}} when designing the theater, {{including one of}} the country's first <b>fire</b> <b>curtains,</b> all-electrical illumination, and a very early air conditioning system which employed fans and large amounts of ice. The theater also contained an electric organ, an innovation at that time. The theater is believed the first to employ a counterweight system for hoisting scenery, which was installed after World War I and remains in use today.|$|R
50|$|The theatre was {{designed}} by architect John Eberson {{with the concept of}} creating the impression of a garden in old Andalusia. Its entire design, including that of the asbestos <b>fire</b> <b>curtain,</b> was that of a Spanish garden or courtyard. The Orpheum Wichita {{was an integral part of}} the famous Orpheum Circuit and in its heyday virtually every major star of vaudeville graced its stage, including such luminaries as Eddie Cantor and Fannie Brice.|$|R
5000|$|After {{completing}} {{work on the}} Riverside Studio, Goff invited Hrdy {{to collaborate}} on a project he had been awarded to redesign the interior of Tulsa's Brady Theater, (then known as Convention Hall).

50|$|A handpainted rolled canvas <b>fire</b> <b>curtain</b> was hand {{painted by}} artists from Sosman and Landes, a Chicago company. The curtain art shows a Venetian canal scene. Side and top panels along the stage depict draperies {{surrounding}} a tree-lined river. Recently, other painted scenes showing gardens, waterfalls and a {{turn of the}} century scene have been discovered in the building. Fife's mother demanded that one of the building's five interior art panels, the one that featured cherubs, be painted over to cover their nakedness.|$|R
2500|$|... {{non-flammable}} fire curtains; other {{openings in}} the proscenium wall required self-closing fire-resistant doors. Heat activated sprinkling systems were required for the fly space above the stage. At this time in New York City, uniformed fire department officers became permanent attendees of every theatrical production. These 'Theatre Detail Officers' were required {{to be in the}} theatre a half-hour before the performance, test the fire alarms, inspect fire wall doors and the <b>fire</b> <b>curtain,</b> and, during performances, ensure that aisles, passageways and fire exits remain clear and accessible.|$|R
50|$|Here, Pedrick {{suggests}} that <b>fire</b> <b>curtains</b> could be secured at the roof {{level of a}} high-rise building. When released, they would envelope substantially the entire building. The curtains could be provided with apertures which when the curtain is released are located opposite rooms in the building, these rooms being designated as ones in which the occupants should congregate {{in the event of}} fire. The concern however was that such large curtains would have prevented escape from the building as well as increase the risk of suffocation.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to landscape paintings, Alson Clark painted murals for the Carthay Circle Theatre in Los Angeles, and the <b>fire</b> <b>curtain</b> of the Pasadena Playhouse, depicting a Spanish galleon in full sail. A group of murals completed in 1929 {{can still be}} seen at the former 1st Trust & Savings Bank at 587 East Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena, California. The murals consist of four panels standing approximately ten feet in height, each depicting a major southern California industry: oil drilling, citrus farming, the movies, and shipping.|$|R
