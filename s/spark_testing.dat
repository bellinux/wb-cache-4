40|$|Despite 150 years' evolution, {{spark plug}} design and {{production}} testing methods have remained largely unchanged since their invention. Spark plug production {{is a complex}} process {{and there are many}} opportunities for faults to be manifested. During most of the history of spark plugs, an ingenious yet relatively simple "go/no go" batch test has been the test of choice, as it is rapid and well-proven for a variety of the most common faults. However, in recent years, some major disadvantages with this test have come to light. This paper describes the existing state of the art of <b>spark</b> plug <b>testing</b> tools and techniques, discovered during a comprehensive literature review. The predominant production <b>spark</b> plug <b>testing</b> system is evaluated, with a view to devising a more advanced method of <b>spark</b> plug <b>testing.</b> The work concludes {{that there is a need}} for a new production <b>spark</b> plug <b>test,</b> ideally offering: further increased reliability of fault detection, capacity for diagnosis of faults, high speed, and easier compliance with Health and Safety legislation...|$|R

In this paper we introduce a calculation method based on the combination of analytical vacuum equations with Monte Carlo test particle simulations, implemented in a PSpice environment via the vacuum-electrical network analogy. Pressure recovery times are calculated for the main gas species released during a breakdown. The number and type of molecules used for the calculation is the result of measurements performed in the DC <b>spark</b> <b>test</b> system...|$|R

40|$|Lightning Attach Point {{tests were}} {{conducted}} for the space shuttle launch configuration (Orbiter, External Tank and Solid Rocket Boosters).

The orbiter main engine and SRB exhaust plumes were simulated electrically with physical models coated with graded resistance paints. The tests showed that the exhaust plumes from the SRB provide additional protection for the main engine nozzles. However, the tests showed that the Orbiter Thermal Protection System (TPS), which has also been shown to be vulnerable to lightning damage, may be struck during launch.

40|$|Based on {{the safety}} <b>spark</b> <b>test</b> apparatus, the {{short-circuit}} spark discharge (SCSD) characteristics of the simple capacitive circuit and switching converter are studied. It is pointed out that their SCSD process {{can be divided into}} four stages, that is, dielectric-breakdown stage, spark-generated stage, spark-maintenance stage, and spark-extinguish stage; moreover, there is different equivalent spark resistance in each stage. For the simple capacitive circuit, its spark resistance is larger and maintaining voltage is almost unchanged in the spark-maintenance stage. For the switching converter, its output short-circuit characteristics depend strongly on the load resistance and its maintaining voltage reduces rapidly with the decrease of the load resistance. The circuit model is proposed, which can simulate the output SCSD process of the switching converter. By using the least-squares method, the relationship expressions between the discharge duration and capacitance in each time-stage are derived and the corresponding equivalent resistance is obtained. The mathematical models are established, and the expressions of the discharge current and voltage are deduced. Experiment and simulation results are positive in the analysis showing the feasibility of the proposed models...|$|R

50|$|In pyrotechnics, {{iron filings}} and metal alloys such as {{magnalium}} {{may be used}} to create sparks. The quantity and style of sparks produced depends on the composition and pyrophoricity of the metal and can be used to identify the type of metal by <b>spark</b> <b>testing.</b> In the case of iron, the presence of carbon is required, as in carbon steel â€” about 0.7% is best for large sparks. The carbon burns explosively in the hot iron and this produces pretty, branching sparks. The color of sparks used in pyrotechnics is determined by the material that the sparks are made from, with the possibility of adding different chemical compounds to certain materials to further influence the color of the sparks. The duration a sparkâ€™s existence is determined by the initial size of the particle, with a larger size leading to a longer-lasting spark.|$|E

This technique requires experienced sorters. Bureau researchers have shown that spectrophotometric methods can be used in lieu of the highly skilled sorter.

40|$|The {{survey of}} the {{possibilities}} for distinguishing between plain carbon and chromium-molybdenum steel tubing included the Herbert pendulum hardness, magnetic, sparks, and chemical tests. The Herbert pendulum test has the disadvantages of all hardness tests in being limited to factory use and being applicable only to scale-free, normalized material. The small difference {{in the range of}} hardness values between plain carbon and chromium-molybdenum steels is likewise a disadvantage. The Rockwell hardness test, at present used in the industry for this purpose, is much more reliable. It may be concluded {{on the basis of the}} experiments performed that of all methods surveyed, <b>spark</b> <b>testing</b> appears to be, at present, the most suitable for factory use from the standpoint of speed, accuracy, nondestructiveness and reliability.

40|$|Intrinsic safety {{testing is}} a method for {{ensuring}} that electrical apparatus designed {{to be used in}} explosive environments will not provide enough energy to cause an explosion. Under the current international standard an apparatus that is being tested for intrinsic safety is connected to a test device called "Spark Test Apparatus" (STA). The STA makes and breaks a short circuit fault condition inside an explosive gaseous chamber, and the device under test produces the energy for the electrical discharges inside the explosive environment. If an explosion does not occur during the test then the apparatus is considered to be safo for use in explosive environments. This is a stochastic testing process which has proven to be unreliable; therefore {{there is a need to}} develop a better method. A novel concept called the Electrical Spark Tester (EST) is being developed by CRC Mining in collaboration with German metrology institute Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, as an alternative <b>spark</b> <b>test</b> apparatus. The proposed method utilizes a semiconductor device to emulate the electrical characteristics of a spark phenomenon. The apparatus under test will be connected to the EST, and through a series of tests the results from a simulated spark will determine the risk of an explosion occurring. This paper presents work to date on the development of the EST...|$|R

The sensitivity of OSW-HE to mechanical stimuli was determined using standard industry tests. Some initial results are given. Pieces of OSW-HE {{were collected from}} active and inactive firing sites and from an area surrounding a drop tower at Los Alamos where skid and spigot tests were done.

40|$|In {{big data}} systems, the {{infrastructure}} {{is such that}} large amounts of data are hosted away from the users. In such a system information security is considered as a major challenge. From a customer perspective, {{one of the big}} risks in adopting big data systems is in trusting the provider who designs and owns the infrastructure from accessing user data. Yet there does not exist much in the literature on detection of insider attacks. In this work, we propose a new system architecture in which insider attacks can be detected by utilizing the replication of data on various nodes in the system. The proposed system uses a two-step attack detection algorithm and a secure communication protocol to analyze processes executing in the system. The first step involves the construction of control instruction sequences for each process in the system. The second step involves the matching of these instruction sequences among the replica nodes. Initial experiments on real-world hadoop and <b>spark</b> <b>tests</b> show that the proposed system needs to consider only 20 % of the code to analyze a program and incurs 3. 28 % time overhead.

40|$|In past years, the U. S. Bureau of Mines {{has been}} {{involved}} in safety research that could ultimately re-late the conditions of <b>spark</b> <b>testing</b> and actual use by estimating the simple ignition probability of a circuit in question. A major problem in estimating this probability is that results show a significant variability, even though gas mixtures and electrical parameters may be closely controlled. Some researchers have suggested that the ambient environmental conditions of the testing may influence the results. A series of tests were conducted using a spark test apparatus to simulate a failing electrical circuit. By independently adjusting the temperature, pressure, or relative humidity of the combustible gas mixture, multiple test environments were examined. At each ignition, a computer re-corded the temperature, pressure, and relative humidity of the gas immediately prior to the explosion. These data were then used to establish the effect of the test environment on the ignition probability and to create a mathematical model of the test environment's synergistic effects. The analysis indicated that these effects were not as significant as previously expected. No general algorithm was found {{that could be used to}} predict these effects across the range of circuits tested...|$|E

40|$|The {{characterization}} of the sensitivity to electrostatic discharge of solid propellants and the adaptation of the corresponding procedures in the production, handling, and operation of motors and systems using them have always been {{an essential part of}} the safety analysis of rocket systems. However, incidents or accidents have occurred during the past decades, which showed that the appreciation of the risks and the knowledge of the mechanisms of ignition were not sufficient. These incidents always involved hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene baqed aluminized composite propellants. After an analysis of the incidents, a new test was designed in France at the beginning of the 1980 s in order to characterize propellants as sensitive or not sensitive, and a criteria based on a percolation model was developed to classify propellant formulations. This test has never been contradicted by further experimental evidence. But other incidents or accidents happened later which showed that the model is not sufficient for some practical situations and that the evaluation of the level of sensitivity of a sensitive propellant remains today a difficult problem. After a history of the main events in the field and of the efforts conducted for characterization, testing, and modeling of the sensitivity to electrostatic discharge during the last 25 years, recent findings on the effect of some factors are presented, and some directions for the future are described.
