50|$|Large <b>hop</b> <b>trefoil</b> is a <b>small</b> erect {{herbaceous}} biennial plant {{growing to}} 10-30 cm tall. Like all clovers, it has leaves {{divided into three}} sessile leaflets, each leaflet 15-25 mm long and 6-9 mm broad. Its yellow flowers are arranged into small, elongated round inflorescences 12-20 mm diameter, located {{at the end of}} the stem. Each individual flower is decumbent.

40|$|High-performance liquid chromatography-UV-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometric {{detector}} (HPLC-UV-ESI-MSD) {{method for}} determination of isoflavones in red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and related species has been developed. The separated isoflavones including aglycones, glycosides and glycoside malonates, were individually analyzed and identified by their molecular ions and characteristic fragment ion peaks using LC-MSD under MS and MS-MS mode, and {{in comparison with}} the standard isoflavones. A total of 31 isoflavones were detected in red clover. Several isoflavones were also identified {{for the first time in}} related species, T. repense L. (white clover), T. hybridum L. (alsike clover) and T. campestre Schreber (<b>hop</b> <b>trefoil).</b> Based on reversed phase HPLC, all 10 isoflavone aglycones, daidzein, formononetin, genistein, pseudobaptigenin, glycitein, calycosin, prunetin, biochanin A, irilone and pratensein in acidic hydrolyzed extracts were successfully separated within 40 min and quantified individually by UV and MS detectors. For the 10 target compounds, the investigated concentrations ranged from ∼ 24 to ∼ 12500 ng/ml for UV detection and ∼ 6 to ∼ 3125 ng/ml for MS detection, and good linearities (r 2 > 0. 999 for UV and r 2 > 0. 99 for MS) for standard curves were achieved for each isoflavone. The accuracy and repeatability (n= 10) were within 15 % for these 10 compounds.

40|$|Future {{wireless}} communication devices {{are expected to}} support {{a wide range of}} applications, while coping with stringent energy budget requirements. Delivering at each moment in time the required performance with minimal energy consumption is a promising energy management technique to enable pervasive wireless networking. Considering transmission energy only, the use of multiple <b>small</b> <b>hops</b> results in a decrease of the energy consumption. On the other hand, decreasing the transmission rate of a single hop similarly results in a decrease of the energy needed to deliver a bit. In this paper we compare the use of multiple <b>small</b> <b>hops</b> along different paths with a single large hop in the Energy-Throughput design space. In contrast with earlier work, realistic transceiver models are used, that cover the complete MAC, transmit and receive chain and support different transmission rates. Results show that, compared to single hop link adaptation, the use of multiple hops in indoor environments is only optimal in the Energy-Throughput space for distances larger than 30 m or when there are obstacles present that can be avoided in alternative paths. For those larger distances, significant gains are possible though. Hence, to achieve energy optimal operation in 802. 11 a networks, it is important to adapt jointly the physical layer constellation and network layer path selection...|$|R
