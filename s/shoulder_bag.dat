The following morning Raviraj {{took part in a}} live discussion on TV Derana between 7.00am and 7.30am. Afterwards he returned to his home in Manning Town, Narahenpita, had breakfast and changed for work. Raviraj had to drive to work himself as his driver was on leave. He had intended to use his wife's car but finding its battery drained got into his Toyota Land Cruiser Prado (reg WP KE 1279). Raviraj's police bodyguard Sergeant Lokuwellamurage Shantha Laxman Lokuwella got onto the passenger seat. At 8.39am, as Raviraj was driving slowly down Martha Road and turning into Elvitigala Mawatha, a motorcycle (reg JE 3507) coming from the opposite direction stopped nearby. The motorcycle's passenger got down, removed his helmet, crossed the road and waited on the pavement with a bag over his shoulder. As Raviraj's vehicle went past, the motorcycle passenger ripped open the <b>shoulder</b> <b>bag</b> and fired the T-56 hidden inside. Raviraj's vehicle was hit from the front, side and rear at point blank range. After firing an entire magazine the assassin ran back to the motorcycle which then sped off, turning into Martha Road. The <b>shoulder</b> <b>bag,</b> with the T-56 inside, and the assassin's helmet were left at the roadside. According to the police a rickshaw parked nearby also drove off after the shooting. They believed that its driver had been a look out who had tipped off the assassins about the location of Raviraj's vehicle using a mobile phone.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{two types}} of {{electric}} breast pumps, hospital grade and personal use pumps. Hospital grade pumps are larger and intended for multiple users. Personal use pumps are smaller and generally intended for one user. Electric breast pumps are powered by a motor which supplies suction through plastic tubing to a horn that fits over the nipple. [...] The portions of the pump that come into direct contact with the expressed milk must be sterilized to prevent contamination. [...] This style provides a lot more suction, making pumping significantly faster, and allows pumping of both breasts at the same time. [...] Electric breast pumps are ideal for when a mother will be pumping daily. [...] Electric breast pumps are larger than manual ones, but portable models are available (e.g. in a backpack or <b>shoulder</b> <b>bag)</b> that allow the mother to transport the pump. Some manufacturers have battery packs or built in batteries to allow portable operation of the pumps. Some electric pumps allow for multiuser operation, requiring only an accessory kit for each user.|$|E

40|$|Most {{children}} and teens carry backpacks that {{weigh more than}} 10 % or 15 % of their body weight, putting their safety and health at risk. The present {{study was conducted to}} examine backpack usage factors that may influence the risk of carrying a heavy backpack: effects of carrying school <b>bags</b> on one <b>shoulder</b> or two, and relationship between body-mass index (BMI) and reports of pain resulting from carrying heavy school bags. In addition, usage of <b>shoulder</b> <b>bags</b> was examined. 223 male and female students, aged 12 - 17, from a combined junior high and high school participated. Results showed that carrying a backpack on both shoulders resulted in fewer reports of pain and discomfort only when the backpack exceeded 15 % body weight; younger students carried proportionately heavier backpacks than older students and reported more pain as a result of carrying a heavy backpack; and carrying <b>shoulder</b> <b>bags</b> resulted in more reports of pain, even though they did not exceed 15 % of body weight. While students with low BMI reported less pain from carrying a backpack than students with high BMI, the difference was not statistically different. Results are discussed in terms of potential interventions and future research directions...|$|R
