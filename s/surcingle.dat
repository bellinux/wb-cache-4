5|$|Two major {{innovations}} that revolutionised {{the effectiveness of}} mounted warriors in battle were the saddle and the stirrup. Riders quickly learned to pad their horse's backs {{to protect themselves from}} the horse's spine and withers, and fought on horseback for centuries with little more than a blanket or pad on the horse's back and a rudimentary bridle. To help distribute the rider's weight and protect the horse's back, some cultures created stuffed padding that resembles the panels of today's English saddle. Both the Scythians and Assyrians used pads with added felt attached with a <b>surcingle</b> or girth around the horse's barrel for increased security and comfort. Xenophon mentioned the use of a padded cloth on cavalry mounts as early as the 4th century BC.|$|E
25|$|Original events {{included}} buckjumping (saddle broncs), bullock riding, campdrafting, bulldogging, wild-cow milking, wild bullock races, {{wild horse}} races and releasing the <b>surcingle.</b> Other common sporting {{events such as}} flag and bending races (similar to pole bending) were held for the competitors' horses.|$|E
25|$|Equestrian vaulting: In vaulting, a <b>surcingle</b> {{with two}} hoops {{at the top}} is {{attached}} around a horse's barrel. The horse also wears a bridle with side reins. The vaulter is longed on the horse, and performs gymnastic movements while the horse walks, trots, and canters.|$|E
50|$|A crupper {{is used to}} {{keep the}} {{equipment}} placed on a horse's back from slipping forward. Cruppers are seen most often on horse harnesses. They are also used on the <b>surcingles</b> of bitting rigs, riding saddles, and, occasionally, pack saddles.|$|R
50|$|A horse {{wearing a}} shaft bow also {{commonly}} wears a collar and a saddle. In a troika, only the center horse wears a saddle. The side horses may wear collars, breastplate-and-breeching, or <b>surcingles.</b> An example from 1912 shows {{a team of}} three horses in Russia, all wearing collars, the center horse wearing a shaft bow and harness saddle.|$|R
60|$|On {{the second}} day of my {{experience}} of the Galu country I came upon a bunch of as magnificent horses as it has ever been my lot to see. They were dark bays with blazed faces and perfect <b>surcingles</b> of white about their barrels. Their forelegs were white to the knees. In height they stood almost sixteen hands, the mares being a trifle smaller than the stallions, of which there were three or four in this band of a hundred, which comprised many colts and half-grown horses. Their markings were almost identical, indicating a purity of strain that might have persisted since long ages ago. If I had coveted one of the little ponies of the Kro-lu country, imagine my state of mind when I came upon these magnificent creatures! No sooner had I espied them than I determined to possess one of them; nor did it take me long to select a beautiful young stallion--a four-year-old, I guessed him.|$|R
25|$|Bronc riding – {{there are}} two {{divisions}} in rodeo, bareback bronc riding, where the rider rides a bucking horse holding onto a leather <b>surcingle</b> or rigging with only one hand, and saddle bronc riding, where the rider rides a modified western saddle without a horn (for safety) while holding onto a braided lead rope attached to the horse's halter.|$|E
25|$|Side reins {{are usually}} used for more {{advanced}} horses. They give the horse something {{to take contact}} with, encourage balance and correct head carriage, help develop self-carriage, and keep the horse from putting its head too low. Side reins may be attached from the bit to the <b>surcingle</b> rings, or from the bit to the billets of the girth.|$|E
25|$|This {{developed}} into the Surge hanging milker. Prior to milking a cow, a large wide leather strap called a <b>surcingle</b> was put around the cow, across the cow's lower back. The milker device and collection tank hung underneath the cow from the strap. This innovation allowed the cow {{to move around}} naturally during the milking process {{rather than having to}} stand perfectly still over a bucket on the floor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Peace, I pr'ythee--Peace, good woman," [...] {{said the}} preacher, {{who had just}} {{recovered}} from a violent fit of coughing, and found his own anathema borne down by Mause's better wind; [...] "peace, and take not the word out of {{the mouth of a}} servant of the altar.--I say, I uplift my voice and tell you, that before the play is played out--ay, before this very sun gaes down, ye sall learn that neither a desperate Judas, like your prelate Sharpe that's gane to his place; nor a sanctuary-breaking Holofernes, like bloody-minded Claverhouse; nor an ambitious Diotrephes, like the lad Evandale; nor a covetous and warld-following Demas, like him they ca' Sergeant Bothwell, that makes every wife's plack and her meal-ark his ain; neither your carabines, nor your pistols, nor your broadswords, nor your horses, nor your saddles, bridles, <b>surcingles,</b> nose-bags, nor martingales, shall resist the arrows that are whetted and the bow that is bent against you!" ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{problem with}} a breastcollar harness was that the actual shafts of the cart, chariot, or other vehicle are {{attached}} to a <b>surcingle</b> around {{the barrel of the}} horse. [...] The breastplate primarily kept the <b>surcingle</b> from slipping back, not as the primary pushing object. This results in the horse literally pulling the load, a less efficient use of the animal. The modern breastcollar has traces which transfer the pull directly from the breastcollar, but a horse collar still is more effective for pulling heavy loads.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>surcingle</b> or roller is {{a padded}} band that straps around the horse's girth area, and has rings around {{on its side}} for side reins, or long reins or other {{training}} equipment, such as an overcheck. It may also be used on a young horse to get it used to girth pressure. It may be used with [...] or without an English saddle underneath.|$|E
2500|$|Bronc riding - {{there are}} two {{divisions}} in rodeo, bareback bronc riding, where the rider is only allowed to hang onto a bucking horse with a type of <b>surcingle</b> called a [...] "rigging"; and saddle bronc riding, where the rider uses a specialized western saddle without a horn (for safety) and hangs onto a heavy lead rope, called a bronc rein, which {{is attached to a}} halter on the horse.|$|E
2500|$|There is evidence, though disputed, {{that humans}} first began riding the horse {{not long after}} domestication, {{possibly}} as early as 4000 BC. [...] The earliest known saddle-like equipment were fringed cloths or pads used by Assyrian cavalry around 700 BC. [...] These were held on with a girth or <b>surcingle</b> that included breast straps and cruppers. From the earliest depictions, saddles became status symbols. To show off an individual's wealth and status, embellishments were added to saddles, including elaborate sewing and leather work, precious metals such as gold, carvings of wood and horn, and other ornamentation.|$|E
2500|$|The saddle [...] is a {{supportive}} structure for a rider or other load, fastened to an animal's back by a girth. The {{most common type}} is the equestrian saddle designed for a horse, but specialized saddles have been created for camels and other creatures. [...] It is not known precisely when riders first began to use some sort of padding or protection, but a blanket attached by some form of <b>surcingle</b> or girth was probably the first [...] "saddle," [...] followed later by more elaborate padded designs. [...] The solid saddle tree was a later invention, and though early stirrup designs predated {{the invention of the}} solid tree, the paired stirrup, which attached to the tree, was the last element of the saddle to reach the basic form that is still used today. [...] Today, modern saddles come {{in a wide variety of}} styles, each designed for a specific equestrianism discipline, and require careful fit to both the rider and the horse. [...] Proper saddle care can extend the useful life of a saddle, often for decades.|$|E

60|$|When {{the song}} was {{finished}} the loud snoring of Captain Wriothesley became audible. He had begun to spread some rugs to lie on, but, becoming hopelessly entangled in his bridle-reins, <b>surcingle,</b> and stirrup-straps, had fallen to sleep with his feet on his saddle and {{his head on the}} floor.|$|E
6000|$|While he thus meditated, he {{was engaged}} in {{fastening}} up his horse in a shed. [...] "Thou maun do without horse-sheet and <b>surcingle</b> now, lad," [...] he said, addressing the animal; [...] "you and me hae had a downcome alike; we had better hae fa'en i, the deepest pool o' Tarras." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Dick," [...] she said, [...] "there's {{not much}} comfort in that. Look at poor Bobby <b>Surcingle,</b> look at Oliver Semples and Victor Medallion; {{you could n't}} have better families. But if you 're sure he does n't drink! Algy 'll laugh, of course; that does n't matter--he laughs at everything." ...|$|E
60|$|After breakfast I spread my poncho on the {{dry grass}} under a tree to sleep the siesta. My slumbers lasted a long time, and on waking I was {{surprised}} to find my host and hostess seated on the grass near me, he busy ornamenting his <b>surcingle,</b> she with the maté-cup in her hand and a kettle of hot water beside her. She was drying her eyes, I fancied, when I opened mine.|$|E
60|$|I {{saw that}} some {{ten or twelve}} {{vibrations}} would bring the steel in actual contact with my robe, and with this observation there suddenly came over my spirit all the keen, collected calmness of despair. For the first time during many hours--or perhaps days--I thought. It now {{occurred to me that}} the bandage, or <b>surcingle,</b> which enveloped me, was unique. I was tied by no separate cord. The first stroke of the razorlike crescent athwart any portion of the band, would so detach it that it might be unwound from my person by means of my left hand. But how fearful, in that case, the proximity of the steel! The result of the slightest struggle how deadly! Was it likely, moreover, that the minions of the torturer had not foreseen and provided for this possibility! Was it probable that the bandage crossed my bosom in the track of the pendulum? Dreading to find my faint, and, as it seemed, in last hope frustrated, I so far elevated my head as to obtain a distinct view of my breast. The <b>surcingle</b> enveloped my limbs and body close in all directions--save {{in the path of the}} destroying crescent.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked like}} a grizzly bear in bad repair. He had an old fur cap on his head that {{concealed}} his ears {{and most of his}} face. He wore a ragged coat that was generally gray, but had white lines along the seams. Under this he wore another coat still more ragged, and the whole was belted at the waist with an old <b>surcingle.</b> Like his father, he was possessed of vast physical strength, and took pride in his powers of endurance.|$|E
60|$|Nor had I erred in my calculations--nor had I endured in vain. I {{at length}} felt that I was free. The <b>surcingle</b> hung in ribands from my body. But {{the stroke of}} the {{pendulum}} already pressed upon my bosom. It had divided the serge of the robe. It had cut through the linen beneath. Twice again it swung, and a sharp sense of pain shot through every nerve. But the moment of escape had arrived. At a wave of my hand my deliverers hurried tumultuously away. With a steady movement--cautious, sidelong, shrinking, and slow--I slid from the embrace of the bandage and {{beyond the reach of}} the scimitar. For the moment, at least, I was free.|$|E
60|$|Tying on Horseback.--In {{cases where}} a {{prisoner}} {{has to be}} secured and galloped off, there are but two ways: either putting him in the saddle and strapping his ankles together under the horse's belly--in which case, if he be mad with rage, and attempts to throw himself off, the saddle must turn with him; or else securing him Mazeppa-fashion--when four loops are passed, one round each leg of the horse, and {{to each of these}} is tied one limb of the prisoner, as he lies with his back against that of the horse; a <b>surcingle</b> is also passed round both horse and man. It is, of course, a barbarous method, but circumstances might arise when it would be of use.|$|E
60|$|It {{was then}} that Bradley's {{attention}} was attracted {{to the edge of}} the plateau by a movement there, and looking closely he saw a horse bearing two figures sliding down the steep declivity. Once at the bottom, the animal came charging across the meadowland at a rapid run. It was a magnificent animal--a great bay stallion with a white-blazed face and white forelegs to the knees, its barrel encircled by a broad <b>surcingle</b> of white; and as it came to a sudden stop beside Tan, the Englishman saw that it bore a man and a girl--a tall man and a girl as beautiful as Co-Tan. When the girl espied the latter, she slid from the horse and ran toward her, fairly screaming for joy.|$|E
60|$|All this I saw indistinctly and by much effort: for my {{personal}} condition had been greatly changed during slumber. I now lay upon my back, and at full length, on {{a species of}} low framework of wood. To this I was securely bound by a long strap resembling a <b>surcingle.</b> It passed in many convolutions about my limbs and body, leaving at liberty only my head, and my left arm to such extent that I could, by dint of much exertion, supply myself with food from an earthen dish which lay by my side on the floor. I saw, to my horror, that the pitcher had been removed. I say to my horror; for I was consumed with intolerable thirst. This thirst {{it appeared to be}} the design of my persecutors to stimulate: for the food in the dish was meat pungently seasoned.|$|E
60|$|I {{now believe}} that the sensations of {{sickness}} and approaching death in the riding-horse of the pampas resemble or similate the pains, so often experienced, of hunger, thirst and fatigue combined, together with the oppressive sensations caused by the ponderous native saddle, or recado, with its huge <b>surcingle</b> of raw hide drawn up so tightly as to hinder free respiration. The suffering animal remembers how at the last relief invariably came, when the twelve or fifteen hours' torture were over, the toil and the want, and when the great iron bridle and ponderous gear were removed, and he had freedom and food and drink and rest. At the gate or {{at the door of}} his master's house, the sudden relief had always come to him; and there does he sometimes go in his sickness, his fear overmastered by his suffering, to find it again.|$|E
6000|$|... "This it {{said and}} vanished. I lifted my whip, but needed not to strike my horse, for not {{a bird that}} has wings could fly faster than he now flew with me on his back. No path was before me, nor did I know where we were going. Through rushes and through thickets, over burrows of wild animals, stones, rivers, marshes, we flew {{as if all the}} devils that are on the earth and under it were at our heels; and when the horse stopped it was at my own door. I stayed not to {{unsaddle}} him, but, cutting the <b>surcingle</b> with my knife, left him to shake the saddle off; then with the bridle I hammered on the door, shouting to my wife to open. I heard her fumbling for the tinder-box. 'For the love of Heaven, woman, strike no light,' I cried. 'Santa Barbara bendita! have you seen a ghost?' she exclaimed, opening to me. 'Yes,' I replied, rushing in and bolting the door, 'and had you struck a light you would now have been a widow.' ...|$|E
60|$|At {{first the}} ravenous animals were startled and terrified at the change--at the {{cessation}} of movement. They shrank alarmedly back; many sought the well. But this was only for a moment. I had not counted in vain upon their voracity. Observing that I remained without motion, {{one or two of}} the boldest leaped upon the frame-work, and smelt at the <b>surcingle.</b> This seemed the signal for a general rush. Forth from the well they hurried in fresh troops. They clung to the wood--they overran it, and leaped in hundreds upon my person. The measured movement of the pendulum disturbed them not at all. Avoiding its strokes they busied themselves with the anointed bandage. They pressed--they swarmed upon me in ever accumulating heaps. They writhed upon my throat; their cold lips sought my own; I was half stifled by their thronging pressure; disgust, for which the world has no name, swelled my bosom, and chilled, with a heavy clamminess, my heart. Yet one minute, and I felt that the struggle would be over. Plainly I perceived the loosening of the bandage. I knew that in more than one place it must be already severed. With a more than human resolution I lay still.|$|E
60|$|Then I dismounted, and, {{with the}} {{careless}} {{air of a}} blameless, non-political person, strode into the spacious kitchen, where an immense cauldron of fat was boiling over a big fire on the hearth; while beside it, ladle in hand, sat a perspiring, greasy-looking woman of about thirty. She was engaged in skimming the fat and throwing the scum on the fire, which made it blaze with a furious joy and loudly cry out in a crackling voice for more; and from head to feet she was literally bathed in grease--certainly the most greasy individual I had ever seen. It was not easy under the circumstances to tell the colour of her skin, but she had fine large Juno eyes, and her mouth was unmistakably good-humoured, as she smiled when returning my salutation. Her husband sat on the clay floor against the wall, his bare feet stretched straight out before him, while across his lap lay an immense <b>surcingle,</b> twenty inches broad at least, of a pure white, untanned hide; and on it he was laboriously working a design representing an ostrich hunt, with threads of black skin. He was a short, broad-shouldered man with reddish-grey hair, stiff, bristly whiskers and moustache of the same hue, sharp blue eyes, and a nose decidedly upturned.|$|E
6000|$|Towards {{evening we}} would be bundled back into the trap and driven home. Then, when the day came round for the return visit, Mr. Royd would bundle his family into their [...] "carriage," [...] which he, without being a carriage-builder or even a carpenter, had made with his own hands. It had four solid wooden wheels about a yard in diameter, and upright wooden sides {{about four or five}} feet high. It was springless and without seats, and had a long pole to which two horses were fastened, and Estanislao, mounted on one, would thrash them into a gallop and carry the thing {{bounding}} over the roadless plain. The fat lady and other passengers were saved from being bumped to death by several mattresses, pillows, and cushions heaped inside. It was the strangest, most primitive conveyance I ever saw, except the one commonly used by a gaucho to take his wife on a visit to a neighbour's house when she was in a delicate condition or too timid to ride on a horse or not well enough off to own a side-saddle. This was a well-stretched, dried horse-hide, with a lasso attached at one end to the head or fore-part of the hide and the other end to the gaucho's horse, as a rule to the <b>surcingle.</b> A stool or cushion was placed in the centre of the big hide for the lady to sit on, and when she had established herself on it the man would whip up his horse and away he would gallop, dragging the strange conveyance after him--a sight which filled the foreigner with amazement.|$|E
60|$|Quite {{early in}} the morning we had breakfast, then every man was ordered to saddle his best horse; for every one of us was the owner of three or four steeds. I, of course, saddled the horse the General had given me, which had been {{reserved}} for important work. We mounted, and proceeded at a gentle pace through a very wild and broken country, still {{in the direction of the}} Cuchilla. About midday scouts came riding in and reported that the enemy were close upon us. After halting for half an hour, we again proceeded at the same gentle pace till about two o'clock, when we crossed the Cañada de San Paulo, a deep valley beyond which the plain rose to a height of about one hundred and fifty feet. In the cañada we stopped to water our horses, and there heard that the enemy were advancing along it at a rapid pace, evidently hoping to cut off our supposed retreat towards the Cuchilla. Crossing the little stream of San Paulo, we began slowly ascending the sloping plain on the farther side till the highest point was gained; then, turning, we saw the enemy, numbering about seven hundred men, beneath us, spread out in a line of extraordinary length. Up from the valley they came towards us at a brisk trot. We were then rapidly disposed in three columns, the centre one numbering about two hundred and fifty men, the others about two hundred men each. I was in one of the outside columns, within about four men from the front. My fellow-soldiers, who had hitherto been very light-hearted and chatty, had suddenly become grave and quiet, some of them even looking pale and scared. On one side of me was an irrepressible scamp of a boy about eighteen years old, a dark little fellow, with a monkey face and a feeble, falsetto voice like a very old woman. I watched him take out a small sharp knife and without looking down draw it across the upper part of his <b>surcingle</b> three or four times; but this he did evidently only for practice, as he did not cut into the hide. Seeing me watching, he grinned mysteriously and made a sign with head and shoulders thrust forward in imitation of a person riding away at full speed, after which he restored his knife to its sheath.|$|E
60|$|So many {{works have}} been written about these countries, that it is almost {{superfluous}} to describe either the lazo or the bolas. The lazo consists of a very strong, but thin, well-plaited rope, made of raw hide. One end is attached to the broad <b>surcingle,</b> which fastens together the complicated gear of the recado, or saddle used in the Pampas; the other is terminated by a small ring of iron or brass, by which a noose can be formed. The Gaucho, when he is going to use the lazo, keeps a small coil in his bridle-hand, and in the other holds the running noose, which is made very large, generally having a diameter of about eight feet. This he whirls round his head, and by the dexterous movement of his wrist keeps the noose open; then, throwing it, he causes it to fall on any particular spot he chooses. The lazo, when not used, is tied up in a small coil to the after part of the recado. The bolas, or balls, are of two kinds: the simplest, which is chiefly used for catching ostriches, consists of two round stones, covered with leather, and united by a thin plaited thong, about eight feet long. (See Chapter 11.) The other kind differs only in having three balls united by the thongs to a common centre. The Gaucho holds the smallest of the three in his hand, and whirls the other two round and round his head; then, taking aim, sends them like chain shot revolving through the air. The balls no sooner strike any object, than, winding round it, they cross each other, and become firmly hitched. The size and weight of the balls varies, according to the purpose for which they are made: when of stone, although not larger than an apple, they are sent with such force as sometimes to break the leg even of a horse. I have seen the balls made of wood, and as large as a turnip, for the sake of catching these animals without injuring them. The balls are sometimes made of iron, and these can be hurled to the greatest distance. The main difficulty in using either lazo or bolas is to ride so well as to be able at full speed, and while suddenly turning about, to whirl them so steadily round the head, as to take aim: on foot any person would soon learn the art. One day, as I was amusing myself by galloping and whirling the balls round my head, by accident the free one struck a bush, and its revolving motion being thus destroyed, it immediately fell to the ground, and, like magic caught one hind leg of my horse; the other ball was then jerked out of my hand, and the horse fairly secured. Luckily he was an old practised animal, and knew what it meant; otherwise he would probably have kicked till he had thrown himself down. The Gauchos roared with laughter; they cried out that they had seen every sort of animal caught, but had never before seen a man caught by himself.|$|E
50|$|Many {{trainers}} first teach a {{young horse}} to accept girth pressure by strapping on a <b>surcingle</b> before a saddle and girth. The <b>surcingle</b> {{is commonly used}} for longeing, often as a base from which to attach training equipment such as side reins, overcheck, lauffer reins (sliding side reins), or chambons. A <b>surcingle</b> is also important in long lining or ground driving, as it provides rings for the long reins to run through. Double longeing, using two longe lines, {{requires the use of}} a <b>surcingle</b> to thread the longe lines through the rings.|$|E
50|$|When used {{without a}} saddle, a <b>surcingle</b> sits {{just behind the}} withers. When used with a saddle, the <b>surcingle</b> runs over the seat near the pommel. A <b>surcingle</b> is also used {{over the top of}} certain types of pack saddle and pack to keep the pack bags and swag in place. A <b>surcingle</b> is usually used with a pad, and fit to the horse's back as {{carefully}} as a saddle would be. It is tightened enough to prevent slipping, more when used with a saddle and rider, less when used for ground training.|$|E
