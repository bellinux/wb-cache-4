5|$|After Jack Bauer {{fails to}} obtain a {{confession}} from Logan, she screams in public {{that he is a}} murderer during Palmer's funeral. Afterwards, President Logan hits her, and threatens to put Martha in an asylum for life. During his tirade, Logan acknowledges all of his misdeeds, unaware that there is a small listening device on his pen. The confession quickly reaches the Attorney General, who orders the U.S. Marshals to arrest Logan. As Charles is escorted away by agents, he turns to stare at Martha, who <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in triumph.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} {{different}} {{views from the}} city, then shifts to a store where Drake is speaking to the cashier. Rihanna enters, grabbing his attention. She <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> and walks towards a fridge and grabs a milk package. Drake follows her and his verse begins. He holds her hand as he raps his verse, the milk package falls from her hand as she holds his, thus spilling milk on the floor. When Drake's verse is over, Rihanna pushes him and walks away with a smile.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Kills walking {{around on a}} bridge, as she reminisces about her {{relationship}} with her boyfriend. As the song builds up to the first verse, they are depicted {{in the living room of}} a hazy-looking apartment, and Kills <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> who kisses her. They start to involve physically, however he pushes her away and opts to smoke a cigar; Kills, simultaneously, takes several pills. As they start to hallucinate, images of dilated pupils appear quickly on the screen and they are shown on the same setting dressed formally. They leave the apartment and drive to a bar—still smoking—and as they reach there, Kills observes an empty stage and decides to sing there. She keeps hallucinating and sees herself in a golden dress as opposed to what she is actually dressing—a black T-shirt. As she continues to sing, a short-haired man who is watching her performance smiles at her and hits on her. Kills' on-screen boyfriend walks up to him and they start a fight while Kills sings. A few moments after, Kills—who was oblivious to the fight—tries to break them up but gets hit by her boyfriend, and leaves the bar crying. He pursues her and they both argue inside their car. They abruptly stop arguing and begin having sexual intercourse. As the song reaches its end, Kills and her boyfriend are again in their apartment, where she spills a bottle of vodka on the ground. After looking at him, she lights it which causes the apartment to burn.|$|E

25|$|When Napoleon's Grand Army finally {{occupies}} {{an abandoned}} and burning Moscow, Pierre takes {{off on a}} quixotic mission to assassinate Napoleon. He becomes anonymous in all the chaos, shedding his responsibilities by wearing peasant clothes and shunning his duties and lifestyle. The only people he sees are Natasha {{and some of her}} family, as they depart Moscow. Natasha recognizes and <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> and he in turn realizes the full scope of his love for her.|$|E
25|$|The {{next morning}} during roll call, Miklós finds Saul {{and tells him}} that he needs a {{replacement}} body, {{similar to the one}} Saul has taken. The prisoners are then summoned into the crematorium to get back to work, where they discover that Biedermann and his unit have been gassed by the SS. Abraham starts a riot with the other prisoners and they attack the SS guards, starting the rebellion. After managing to escape from the crematorium, Saul retrieves the boy's body and escapes to the woods with Braun and few other prisoners. When they reach a river, Saul finds a chance to bury the body, only to discover that Braun is a fraud when he can't recite the Kaddish. When he hears the guards approaching, Saul tries to carry the body across the river. Unable to manage the current with the added weight, he loses his grasp on the sack and is pulled out of the river by Rabbi Frankel as the body floats away. When the prisoners arrive at a shed in the forest, they start to discuss a plan to join the Polish resistance. Saul notices a young peasant boy peeking into the shed and <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> the only time he is shown with a smile. As the boy runs away, guards run past {{in the direction of the}} shed. Gunfire echoes as the camera follows the boy into the woods.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Conflict Resolution", Dwight {{states that}} he does not like to smile, as showing one's teeth is a {{submission}} signal in primates, and that whenever someone <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "all [...] sees is a chimpanzee, begging for its life". Dwight owns many exotic pets including piranhas, frogs, an arctic wolf, a raccoon, a porcupine named Henrietta, and an opossum, although the wolf escaped due to poor restraints and he flushed his piranhas down the toilet. He also has an interest in bears, and is ready to debate the habits and characteristics of different species of bears.|$|E
60|$|Berenice, {{after the}} usual {{greetings}} and explanations, <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> thoughtfully.|$|R
60|$|She {{released}} {{herself and}} <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> wistfully through her tears.|$|R
60|$|She <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> a {{delightful}} mixture of graciousness and condescension.|$|R
2500|$|The video {{features}} Yamaguchi in {{the role}} of a black shawled ferryman, transporting a woman played by Ayami Nakajō across a darkened lake. As they progress across the lake, there are flashbacks to a [...] "painful story" [...] between her and a man, played by Akira Kameyama. Later in the video, the woman is shown embracing the man as he lies collapsed on a skating rink. He appears on the boat, and she reaches out and touches him, but he is no longer there. She sees him standing {{on the edge of the}} lake, and <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

60|$|She <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> an {{understanding}} <b>smile,</b> but her words defied him.|$|R
60|$|She <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> {{because of}} his bright boyish tone and manner.|$|R
6000|$|MISS HOWARD. Almost bedtime, Mr. Murray. Here's your diet. (He {{takes the}} glass. She <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> provokingly.) Well, is it {{love at first}} sight, Mr. Murray? ...|$|E
60|$|She who {{has been}} to so many theatres <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> 'No, you boy! It's {{something}} in a play. It means that if we know ourselves well, we know our parents also. From thinking of myself, Cosmo, I know mother. In her youth she was one who did not love easily; but when she loved once it was for aye. A nature very difficult to understand, but profoundly interesting. I can feel her within me, as she was when {{she walked down the}} aisle on that strong arm, to honour and obey him henceforth for aye. What cared they that they had to leave their native land, they were together for aye. And so--' Her face is flushed. Cosmo interrupts selfishly.|$|E
60|$|The modern {{young man}} may do adventurous things {{if they are}} thrust on him; but left to himself he will edge away uncomfortably and look in the other {{direction}} when the goddess of adventure <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Training and tradition alike pluck at his sleeve and urge him not to risk making himself ridiculous. And from sheer horror of laying himself open to the charge of not minding his own business he falls into a stolid disregard of all that is out of the ordinary and exciting. He tells himself that the shriek from the lonely house he passed just now was only the high note of some amateur songstress, and that the maiden in distress whom he saw pursued by the ruffian with a knife was merely earning the salary paid her by some motion-picture firm. And he proceeds on his way, looking neither to left nor right.|$|E
60|$|He bent towards her. She <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Her {{eyes were}} dancing.|$|R
60|$|Then he {{recalled}} his wandering thoughts as his hostess <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{pressed his}} hand and <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> {{but her eyes were}} wet.|$|R
6000|$|Upon {{the first}} point, also, letters from Mary soon enlightened him. It {{appeared}} that {{shortly after his}} departure Sir Jonah, in a violent fit of rage, brought on by drink and a remark of his wife's that had she married Colonel Monk she [...] "would have been a happy woman," [...] burst a small blood-vessel in his head, with the strange result that from a raging animal of a man he {{had been turned into}} an amiable and perfectly harmless imbecile. Under so trying a domestic blow, naturally, Mary explained, Colonel Monk felt it to be his duty to support and comfort his old friend to the best of his ability. [...] "This," [...] added Mary, [...] "he does for about three hours every day. I believe, indeed, that a place is always laid for him at meals, while poor Sir Jonah, for whom I feel quite sorry, although he was such a horrid man, sits in an armchair and <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> continually." ...|$|E
60|$|These {{young ones}} {{had had no}} {{instructors}} save their mother, and Doctor Tusher for their theology occasionally, and had made more progress than {{might have been expected}} under a tutor so indulgent and fond as Lady Castlewood. Beatrix could sing and dance like a nymph. Her voice was her father's delight after dinner. She ruled over the house with little imperial ways, which her parents coaxed and laughed at. She had long learned the value of her bright eyes, and tried experiments in coquetry, in corpore vili, upon rustics and country squires, until she should prepare to conquer the world and the fashion. She put on a new ribbon to welcome Harry Esmond, made eyes at him, and directed her young <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> not a little to the amusement of the young man, and the joy of her father, who laughed his great laugh, and encouraged her in her thousand antics. Lady Castlewood watched the child gravely and sadly: the little one was pert in her replies to her mother, yet eager in her protestations of love and promises of amendment; and as ready to cry (after a little quarrel brought on by her own giddiness) until she had won back her mamma's favor, as she was to risk the kind lady's displeasure by fresh outbreaks of restless vanity. From her mother's sad looks she fled to her father's chair and boozy laughter. She already set the one against the other: and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early.|$|E
60|$|I {{certainly}} don't {{think that}} the qualities, half savage and half freethinking, expressed in 'Jane Eyre' are likely to suit a model governess or schoolmistress; and it amuses me to consider them in that particular relation. Your account falls like dew upon the parched curiosity {{of some of our}} friends here, to whom (as mere gossip, which did not leave you responsible) I couldn't resist the temptation of communicating it. People are so curious--even here among the Raffaels--about this particular authorship, yet nobody seems to have read 'Shirley'; we are too slow in getting new books. First Galignani has to pirate them himself, and then to hand us over the spoils. By the way, there's to be an international copyright, isn't there? Something is talked of it in the 'Athenaeum.' Meanwhile the Americans have already reprinted my husband's new edition. 'Landthieves, I mean pirates.' I used to take that for a slip of the pen in Shakespeare; but it was a slip of the pen into prophecy. Sorry I am at Mrs. ---- falling short of your warm-hearted ideas about her! Can you understand a woman's hating a girl because it is not a boy--her first child too? I understand it so little that scarcely I can believe it. Some women have, however, undeniably an indifference to children, just as many men have, though it must be unnatural and morbid in both sexes. Men often affect it--very foolishly, if they count upon the scenic effects; affectation never succeeds well, and this sort of affectation is peculiarly unbecoming, except in old bachelors, for there is a pathetic side to the question so viewed. For my part and my husband's, we may be frank and say that we have caught up our parental pleasures with a sort of passion. But then, Wiedeman is such a darling little creature; who could help loving the child?... Little darling! So much mischief was not often put before into so small a body. Fancy the child's upsetting the water jugs till he is drenched (which charms him), pulling the brooms to pieces, and having serious designs upon cutting up his frocks with a pair of scissors. He laughs like an imp when he can succeed in doing anything wrong. Now, see what you get, in return for your kindness of 'liking to hear about' him! Almost I have the grace to be ashamed a little. Just before I had your letter we sent my new edition to England. I gave much time to the revision, and did not omit reforming some of the rhymes, although you must consider that the irregularity of these in a certain degree rather falls in with my system than falls out through my carelessness. So much the worse, you will say, when a person is systematically bad. The work will include the best poems of the 'Seraphim' volume, strengthened and improved as far as the circumstances admitted of. I had not the heart to leave out the wretched sonnet to yourself, for your dear sake; but I rewrote the latter half of it (for really it wasn't a sonnet at all, and 'Una and her lion' are rococo), and so placed it with my other poems of the same class. There are some new, verses also.[197] The Miss Hardings I have seen, and talked with them of you, a sure way of finding them delightful. But, my dearest friend, I shall not see any of the Trollope party--it is not likely. You can scarcely image to yourself the retired life we live, or how we have retreated from the kind advances of the English society here. Now people seem to understand that we are to be left alone; that nothing is to be made of us. The fact is, we are not like our child, who kisses everybody who <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> <b>him!</b> Neither my health nor our pecuniary circumstances, nor our inclinations perhaps, would admit of our entering into English society here, which is kept up much after the old English models, with a proper disdain for Continental simplicities of expense. We have just heard from Father Prout, who often, he says, sees Mr. Horne, 'who is as dreamy as ever.' So glad I am, for I was beginning to be uneasy about him. He has not answered my letter from Lucca. The verses in the 'Athenaeum'[198] are on Sophia Cottrell's child.|$|E
