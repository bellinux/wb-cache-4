40|$|This paper aims to {{understand}} the moderator effect of the salesforce control system {{in the relationship between}} sales behavior (locomotion, working hard and <b>working</b> <b>smart)</b> and salesperson performance. Two perspectives of the control system are addressed: outcome and behavior. To test the hypotheses, a descriptive survey was conducted with a convenience sample of 140 salespersons of retail stores of construction materials. The results demonstrate that high levels of behavior-based salesforce control systems decrease the performance of salespersons that present high level of locomotion and <b>working</b> <b>smart</b> and high levels of outcome-based salesforce control systems improve the performance of salesperson that present low levels of working hard and <b>working</b> <b>smart.</b> Furthermore, the study showed that the salesperson behavior interferes in performance, specially the working hard. The findings indicate that sales managers must take actions to evaluate the salesperson behavior individually, adopting distinct control system for different salesperson in the same sales team. Finally, the findings also indicate that the high performance salespersons must transmit their expertise to inefficient salesperson, through the creation of informal or formal ties. </p...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - This paper investigates <b>Smart</b> <b>Working</b> (SW), a set {{of modern}} and not-conventional {{organisational}} models that are characterised by high flexibility {{in the choice of}} the working spaces, time and tools, and that provides all employees of a organisation with the best working conditions to accomplish their tasks. Specifically, the paper aims to: (i) identify whether firms adopt different SW models: (ii) explore complementarities between the elements that can lead to choose a SW model, and (iii) figure out whether contingent variables matters in the implementation of a particular SW model. Design/methodology/approach - This study is based on a continuative research initia-tive promoted since 2012 by the School of Management of Politecnico di Milano, i. e. the <b>Smart</b> <b>Working</b> Observatory. In order to achieve the paper goal, during 2013 we have run a survey delivered to 100 HR directors of medium and large Italian organizations to col-lect empirical evidence on SW phenomenon, and accomplished multiple, embedded case studies to better explain the findings achieved in the quantitative analysis. Originality/value - The paper aims to look inside the black box of SW, by unpacking the elements that can generate complementarities between the adoption of digital tools, workplace and work practice innovation. Practical implications - Managers who aim to fully benefit of SW practices should not only invest in the enabling digital technologies, but also make the complementary trans-formations in organisational policies and workspace settings, according the contingent conditions under which they operate...|$|E

The proposed system perceives its envi-ronment with multiple sensor modalities and acts in it with an industrial robot manipulator to assemble capital goods together with a human worker. In combination with the reactive behav-ior of the robot, safe collaboration between the human and the robot is possible. Furthermore, the system anticipates human behavior, based on knowledge databases and decision processes, ensuring an effective collaboration between the human and robot. As a proof of concept, we introduce a use case where an arm is assembled and mounted on a robot’s body. I...|$|E

40|$|This article investigatesthe {{factors that}} {{determine}} workplace actors’ appeal to social norms of fairness {{in some situations}} and what ‘fairness’ is perceived as consisting of. When is a pay level considered as relativity fair, and when is it not? When are contingent pay systems (i. e. pay-for-performance systems) perceived as fair and when are they not? When can differences in contribution (equity) overrule the social norm of equality? Which contingent reward structure should be applied for teamwork members, if any? Which structure to motivate employees to a continuous search for <b>smarter</b> <b>working</b> procedures and solutions? These are central concerns of motivation theory, where rational choice decisions are counterbalanced by endowment effectsor other fairness concerns. Management is placed in a dilemma between what is, e. g., an economically rational structure of incentives, on the one hand, and what is considered as equitable by employees, on the other. Since equality in reward counts for more among employees, while equity in contribution counts more for employers, this is an inherent dilemma, constantly having to be negotiated and solved, but never reaching any ‘final solution’ in any company. On {{the basis of this}} dilemma, implications for management are spelt out, and recommendations for the utilization of and limitations for pay variance among peers are given...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Both {{privacy and}} trust relate to {{knowledge}} about an entity. However, {{there is an}} inherent conflict between trust and privacy: the more knowledge a first entity knows about a second entity, the more accurate should be the trustworthiness assessment; the more knowledge is known about this second entity, the less privacy is left to this entity. This conflict {{needs to be addressed}} because both trust and privacy are essential elements for a <b>smart</b> <b>working</b> world. The solution should allow the benefit of adjunct trust when entities interact without too much privacy loss. We propose to achieve the right trade-off between trust and privacy by ensuring minimal trade of privacy for the required trust. We demonstrate how transactions made under different pseudonyms can be linked and careful disclosure of such links fulfils this right trade-off. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{application}} of ICT {{can lead to}} considerable reductions in the energy consumption of society. Although ICT itself consumes energy, there are many good reasons to explore the possibilities of 'green ICT'. After decades of experiments and research, ICTs designed to be 'green ' still holds the promise of leading to substantial ecological benefits by means of dematerialisation, more efficient production processes and changed (more sustainable) human behaviour. Up till now, the effects of ICT on energy consumption are much less straightforward due to rebound effects: effects that have a negative influence on the intended positive effect. In parallel, rebound effects themselves have in turn other side effects as well, so there are many interacting effects to account for, greatly adding to complexity of the discussion. Despite evidence that suggests otherwise, initiatives that focus on 'greening by ICT ' do not account for a consistent analysis of these rebound effects. This paper proposes an approach that enables to map and analyze these rebound effects systematically. This approach is applied in two related cases, teleworking {{and the use of}} <b>Smart</b> <b>Working</b> Centres. The Rapid Assessment Program (RAP) is used as a simulation model to identif...|$|E
40|$|The current {{affordances}} of ubiquitous global connections, of a {{large number}} of open resources, and of social and professional networks may boost innovation in open-minded organisations through their personnel’s empowerment. Lifelong and ubiquitous learning, cloud computing and <b>smart</b> <b>working</b> frameworks are the pillars of the change that is replacing the traditional work model and transforming the way crowds of people communicate, collaborate, teamwork, produce value and growth for the entities of which they are part. All this directly involves the smart city concept. The “cloudworker” virtually works, learns and socially participates effectively from anywhere anytime, and comfortably interacts in a knowledge society built on networked ecologies. Cloud teamwork applications, such as Google+ can be, enable teams to be more productive and organisations to devote more time to their core mission. Social networking and collaboration technologies draw renewed attention on the evidence that organisations are social entities above all; as such, they can turn into whole systems of leadership and learning, that is high-performance work systems. This paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Google+ as a leveraging teamwork tool in learning organisations. Results show that technology is not only a means of social exchange, but it turns into the joint design of learning and organisational strategies, and into the growth of learning communities...|$|E
