40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of Basel ll on the South African banking system through possible changes in the way in which a bank conducts its business. This purpose arose from the publication of the new Basel ll Framework on 26 June 2004, which has been adopted for implementation by the South African Reserve Bank. South Africa has set January 1, 2008 as the implementation date for Basel ll. The South African banks have mainly been focussing their efforts on becoming Basel ll compliant. Business line management and marketers have up until now not paid much attention to the likely impact of Basel ll on their markets and product offerings. A literature study was undertaken which included a review of the Basel ll Framework, impact studies and a review of the relevant literature on the topic. The Framework was analysed in order to determine the major impact themes. Once these impact themes were identified, the literature on those areas of impact was researched. The analysis of the Basel ll Framework identified three important themes that will have a significant impact on banks. There will firstly be an impact on market segments and product offerings. Secondly, there will be an internal impact on the banks in the form of increased costs, decision-making and capital management. The final theme identified was the global impact on the banks, especially regarding procyclicality and mergers and acquisitions. vii The research indicates that there will be both winners and losers. Banks that have large retail and mortgage exposures will benefit the most from Basel ll, whereas banks that have large exposures to sovereigns, banks and <b>specialised</b> <b>lending</b> portfolios will be negatively impacted. A capital charge for operational risk will mean that some areas such as corporate finance and asset management will be allocated capital, which was not the case under Basel l. Studies indicate that this new operational risk capital requirement more than outweighs any reduction in credit risk capital requirements. Customers that have high credit ratings are more likely to benefit from lower credit spreads. Similarly customers that have poor credit ratings can expect an increase in their pricing due to the higher capital requirements for these customers, unless they can provide a bank with ancillary revenues. Competition in the retail and mortgage markets will intensify due to the favourable capital requirements for these portfolios. The large South African banks will become takeover targets because of their large exposures to these markets. Basel ll will have a major impact on the way in which banks will do business in the future and as a result banks should view the implementation of the Framework as an opportunity to gain strategic advantages rather than just a compliance obligation.

Bluestone was the first major non-bank reverse mortgage lender in Australia, and the first lender in Australia to offer a 'fixed for life' product so that borrowers were not exposed to long dated interest rate risk. Bluestone's lump sum reverse mortgage product was expanded to include a 'draw-down' style product in 2006, allowing borrowers to receive funds in regular payments. A 'capped for life' product soon followed, and in 2007, the reverse mortgage product was launched in New Zealand.|$|R
40|$|Real assets, {{represented}} by residential properties, hold {{about half of}} the tangible capital in developed countries. Consequently, mortgage market, which assigns the market for financing real assets, is a key component of the financial market. Because of this importance, the mortgage market’s efficiency {{is considered to be a}} key factor of the financial market’s efficiency. In particulary, a weak functionning of the former is believed „to pollute ” other components of financial market. The article is meant to emphasize, for the euro area, those institutional caracteristics that maintain the national mortgage markets’ heterogeneity. In this way, we have identified the presence of heterogeneity both in terms of mortgage products features (essential from the viewpoint of mortgage market integration) and of consumers preferences (influenced mainly by demographic factors). Also, we question about the possible implications of mortgage market’s expansion to the monetary policy and financial stability. Key words: mortgage products, mortgage debt, institutional heterogeneity, financial integration 1. Basic caracteristics and institutions of mortgage market The mortgage market represents a particular type of credit market, <b>specialised</b> in <b>lending</b> activities collateralised with real assets.

40|$|This {{research}} {{seeks to}} deepen {{the understanding of}} the causes of obstacles to bank lending to the smaller businesses in Nigeria, and to contribute to the literature aimed at finding solutions to this persistent problem. Smaller firms report access to finance as a major obstacle to their growth. With bank credit contributing up to 50 % of their external financing, the research focuses on banking institutions. Perceived as a credit market failure, the economics literature ascribes these credit shortages to problems of informational asymmetry and institutional failure, and in turn, these two issues have dominated the applied research on the subject. This thesis contends that small business credit shortage is a complex phenomenon which needs to be understood {{within the context of the}} specific operating environment. This research is a qualitative case study of a commercial bank in Nigeria that newly entered into the SME credit market using semi-structured interviews and documentary data to explore the obstacles to SME lending and possible solutions. Based on a thematic analysis of the data, the research found that a well-regulated finance industry within the growing economy stimulated opportunities for lending to SMEs. Attracted by these perceived lucrative opportunities, the commercial bank established a successful lending programme developing proprietary credit scoring techniques and innovative devices to overcome institutional barriers and informational obstacles. To encourage more banks to increase lending to the sector, the research concluded with proposals towards removing impediments to SME business lending. These included improving banks' knowledge of <b>specialised</b> techniques to <b>lend</b> to SMEs, business friendly policies to improve the business environment for smaller businesses to reduce their risk of failure, lower interest rates on loans and capacity building to improve management skills of business owners...|$|R
