25|$|In England and Wales, sex {{education}} is not compulsory in schools as parents can refuse to let their children {{take part in the}} lessons. The curriculum focuses on the reproductive system, foetal development, and the physical and emotional changes of adolescence, while information about contraception and safe sex is discretionary and discussion about relationships is often neglected. Britain {{has one of the highest}} teenage pregnancy rates in Europe and {{sex education}} is a heated issue in government and media reports. In a 2000 study by the University of Brighton, many 14- to 15-year-olds reported disappointment with the content of sex education lessons and felt that lack of confidentiality prevents teenagers from asking teachers about contraception. However, in a 2008 study conducted by YouGov for Channel 4 it was revealed that only three in ten teenagers say they need more <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>education.</b> In most primary/junior schools, students are taught a (non-compulsory) formal sex education program from Upper Key Stage 2 (ages 10–11), and then onwards into secondary school, where it becomes a topic in the overall subject of Citizenship or PSHE (Personal Social Health Education). In March 2017 it was made complusory all schools have to teach sex education.|$|E

40|$|GET REAL ABOUT SEX: The Politics <b>and</b> Practice of <b>Sex</b> Education explores how {{cultural}} {{ideas about}} gender, sexuality and parenthood {{play out in}} the <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>education</b> classroom. It presents new material from a detailed study and analyses the struggle to raise the status of <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>education</b> against academic <b>and</b> market-driven priorities. It locates {{the dynamics of the}} classroom within those of the school and asks: What do the different parties in teaching and learning - both staff and pupils - say about how <b>sex</b> education is <b>and</b> should be taught in the classroom? How do ideas about masculinity, femininity and parenthood operate in the classroom and in policy? What different agendas and professional perspectives are revealed in the views of teachers, PSHE coordinators, school nurses and head-teachers? The complex picture that emerges of forces at work within a single school is, in turn, situated within an analysis of the broader cultural forces at work in contemporary Britain. It considers how young people negotiate intensified pressure on them regarding academic attainment in an increasingly sexualised culture, and it develops a critique of the Achievement Agenda in education policy, contributing another arm to the critique of market rationalities in education. This book analyses the challenges facing the provision of quality <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>education</b> at the classroom level and at the political level, and makes sometimes provocative suggestions for changes at both these levels...|$|R

40|$|Aim.   This {{paper is}} a report of a study to explore how school nurses {{perceive}} the influence of schools on their role in delivering <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>education</b> in primary schools. Background.   School nurses {{play a key role}} in sex education in English schools. However, sex education is a contentious issue meaning the sex education of children is often an area of tension within the curriculum. However, the impact of these tensions upon school nursing practice is poorly described. Method.   Three focus groups with a convenience sample of 16 nurses experienced in conducting <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>education</b> were conducted during 2006. Focus groups were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim and subjected to a thematic analysis. Findings.   Four themes were identified in the data: ‘covert surveillance’ refers to school staff conducting clandestine surveillance of the classroom actions of the nurse; ‘overt surveillance’ reflects how nurses felt they were being openly monitored by teachers in the classroom; ‘Teacher attitude’ refers to the interventions of the supervising teacher in the classroom during the <b>sex</b> education session <b>and</b> ‘resistance practices’ detailed how nurses attempted to manage the disciplinary practices of the school. Conclusion.   School nurses need to be pragmatic about the fact that there will be some attempts by the school to regulate sex education. Developing an early dialogue with the school can mediate this. Closer working practices and the involvement of school nurses in the development of <b>sex</b> education policy <b>and</b> practice is vital to ensure that they continue to make a valuable contribution to sex education in schools...|$|R
