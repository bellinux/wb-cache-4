Downy mildew is a common disease of brassicas and closely related cruciferous crops. This thesis surveys downy mildew caused by Hyaloperonospora (Peronospora) spp. with focus on the rocket salad species. 	The susceptibility experiment was carried out to research the host specificity of plant parasitic Oomycetes Hyaloperonospora (Peronospora) spp. on rocket salad (wild rocket, Diplotaxis tenuifolia and cultivated rocket salad, Eruca sativa) and other chosen crops from the Brassicaceae family (broccoli, cauliflower, <b>swede,</b> oil seeds <b>rape)</b> at the seedlings stage. Seedlings were inoculated with different isolates (frozen plant material from 2008, diseased brassicas and closely related cruciferous crops from the fields in Norway and diseased cruciferous weeds grown close to the fields with the Brassicaceae family crops). The experiment {{has shown that the}} pathogen from a certain host plant species was more aggressive on plants of the same species. The pathogen from the host plant D. tenuifolia was significantly more aggressive on seedlings of D. tenuifolia. The pathogen from the host plant broccoli was more aggressive on broccoli seedlings, but was also capable to infect cauliflower, <b>swede</b> and oilseed <b>rape.</b> The pathogen from host plant swede was more aggressive on seedlings of swede, but disease was observed also on cauliflower and broccoli. 	The thesis also covers a survey of the survival of conidia in the air. The spores of Hyaloperonospora (Peronospora) spp. were exposed to solar radiation for different time intervals. Afterwards, the viability of these spores was evaluated. Results from the experiment indicate a certain decreasing trend in the viability of spores over the time of their exposure. 	The third experimental part surveys whether the overwintering structures of Hyaloperonospora (Peronospora) spp. in the soil can cause an infection on the seedlings of D. tenuifolia. The soil from the fields, where rocket salad was grown previous years, was sampled. An occurrence of the disease on the seedlings of D.  tenuifolia was observed. The disease was not observed on the experimental seedlings...|$|R
50|$|The crops most {{susceptible}} to P. brassicae damage in areas in Europe {{are those in}} the genus Brassica (cabbage, mustard, and their allies), particularly Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, kohlrabi, <b>rape,</b> <b>swede,</b> and turnip. The attacks to crops are rather localized {{and can lead to}} 100% crop loss in a certain area. In addition, because of its strong inclination to migrate, adults may infest new areas that were previously free from attack. Because many of the host plants of P. brassicae are sold for consumption, damage by these butterflies can cause a great reduction of crop value. Larvae may also bore into the vegetable heads of cabbage and cauliflower and cause damage. High populations of these larvae may also skeletonise their host plants. In present-day areas such as Great Britain, P. brassicae are now less threatening as pests because of natural and chemical control reasons. However, it is still considered a pest in other European countries, in China, India, Nepal, and Russia. In fact, it is estimated to cause over 40% yield loss annually on different crop vegetables in India and Turkey.|$|R
40|$|Na području Zagreba nađeni su primjerci biljaka Brassica napus var. napobrassica subvar. {{rutabaga}} i B. rapa var. sylvestris s deformiranim, mozaičnim i šarenim listovima i nekrotičnim promjenama na njima. Na osnovi seroloških pokusa, reakcije pokusnih biljaka i virusnih staničnih uklopina dokazano je da je te simptome uzrokovala infekcija virusom mozaika rotkve (RaMV). Serološki pokusi su pokazali da virusni izolat Brs iz biljke B. rapa var. sylvestris i izolat Bnr iz biljke B. napus var. napobrassica subvar. rutabaga pripadaju evropskom soju RaMV. Utvrđeno je da je izolat Brs serološki identičan evropskom soju, dok se izolat Bnr od njega razlikuje. Izgleda da do sada nisu zabilježene spontane infekcije navedenih biljaka s RaMV. Ustanovljeno je da RaMV zaražava vrstu Nicotiana debneyi, na čijim inokuliranim listovima uzrokuje simptome. Radish mosaic virus (RaMV) {{has been}} found in Zagreb area (Yugoslavia) naturally infecting yellow swede (Brassica napus var. napobrassica subvar. rutabaga) (isolate Bnr) and rape (B. rapa var. sylvestris) (isolate Brs), the latter one known as a weed plant. The percentage of infected plants was approx. 10 % (swede) and 30 % (rape). Symptoms on the leaves of infected swede specimens included mild mosaic, malformations and sporadic occurrence of ochre yellow on blades. Sometimes premature fall of lower leaves was present. The infection did not cause much damage to the roots. Leaves of infected rape specimens displayed variegation, malformations, faint necrosis and moderate stunting. The identity of isolates Bnr and Brs with RaMV was proved serologically, on basis of test plant reaction and intracellular inclusion bodies. It seems that yellow <b>swede</b> and <b>rape</b> plants have not been described so far as natural hosts of the virus. By means of spur test and intragel absorption test, using an antiserum to the HZ (type) isolate of the European strain, the isolates {{have been found to be}} serologically identical (isolate Brs) with or slightly different (isolate Bnr) from the HZ isolate. It was found that the virus (isolate Bnr) caused necrotic and chlorotic lesions in inoculated leaves of Nicotiana debneyi...|$|R
40|$|Bulb {{brassicas}} {{are used}} as supplementary feed in intensive pastures systems. However, {{there is a lack}} of quantitative data to define their growth and development. This has limited the creation and use of prediction models and decision support systems. Thus a series of experiments were used to clarify the growth and development of bulb turnips. Thermal time requirements for developmental phases of bulb brassicas were quantified and relationships to describe the time to bulb initiation were obtained in field and controlled environments. In the first controlled environment experiment cardinal temperatures were determined from germination of nine cultivars of forage brassicas and daily thermal time accumulation models were developed for three groups of forage brassicas and ‘Aparima Gold’ swede (Brassica napus spp. napobrassica). These models allowed the calculation of thermal time accumulation in two field experiments. The first field experiment evaluated ‘Aparima Gold’ swede and ‘Barkant’ and ‘Green Globe’ turnips sown on five dates from November 2008 to March 2009. A second field experiment evaluated ‘Green Globe’ turnip sown on four dates from December 2009 to March 2010 under two soil temperature regimes (covered with plastic sheets and uncovered). A second controlled environment experiment evaluated phyllochron and hypocotyl thickening of <b>swede,</b> turnips and <b>rape</b> cultivars sown on four dates and in three temperature regimes using two glasshouses and an outside environment from December 2011 to March 2012. ‘Aparima Gold’ swede had a thermal time requirement to 50 % emergence of 83 oCd (Tb = 0 oC) whereas the turnip cultivars averaged 56 oCd (Tb = 3. 6 oC). Total dry matter production of bulb brassicas was described by logistic curves where leaf production was the main component of yield until bulb development started. From this point, leaf production stabilized until leaf senescence became predominant and bulbs became the main component of yield. Dry matter yields decreased as sowing date was delayed and that was related to the total amount of radiation intercepted. Radiation use efficiency of ‘Green Globe’ turnips increased with mean temperature at a rate of 0. 07 g DM/MJ total/oC, from 10 to 20 oC. Bulb initiation was botanically defined as when hypocotyl was 10 mm thick and occurred at ~ 760 oCd for ‘Aparima Gold’ and at ~ 390 oCd for turnips. Until bulb initiation of ‘Green Globe’, increases in LAI (0. 4 m 2 /m 2 /oCd) and in leaf production (0. 3 kg DM/ha/oCd) were observed. From this point on, the relationship between the ratio leaf:root dry matter production and accumulated thermal time followed an exponential decline (R 2 = 0. 99) with a base parameter of 0. 995. Phyllochron of brassicas was not constant across sowing dates. The phyllochron of ‘Aparima Gold’ swede ranged from 52 to 106 oCd/leaf, ‘Goliath’ rape from 42 to 92 oCd/leaf (Tb = 3. 9 oC) and for turnips from 20 to 67 oCd/leaf across field and controlled environment experiments. Phyllochron increased with mean temperature at a rate of 3. 4 oCd/leaf/oC for ‘Green Globe’ and 3. 7 oCd/leaf/oC for ‘Barkant’ turnips from 7 to 21 oC. ‘Aparima Gold’ and ‘Goliath’ also increased phyllochron with mean temperature (2. 0 and 2. 8 oCd/leaf/oC, respectively) but further studies are recommended to uncouple the effects of temperature and photoperiod...|$|R
