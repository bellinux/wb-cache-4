2500|$|A more {{efficient}} {{alternative to a}} <b>shunt</b> <b>voltage</b> regulator is an active voltage regulator circuit. [...] An active regulator employs reactive components to store and discharge energy, so that most or all current supplied by the rectifier is passed to the load.

40|$|Damping torque {{analysis}} is a well-developed technique for understanding and studying power system oscillations. This paper presents the applications of clamping torque analysis for DC bus implemented clamping control in power transmission networks in two examples. The first {{example is the}} investigation of clamping effect of <b>shunt</b> <b>voltage</b> source converter (VSC) based flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) voltage control, i. e. static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) voltage control. It {{is shown in the}} paper that STATCOM voltage control mainly contributes synchronous torque and hence has little effect on the clamping of power system oscillations. The second example is the damping control implemented by a battery energy storage system (BESS) installed in a power system. Damping torque analysis reveals that when BESS clamping control is realized by regulating exchange of active and reactive power between the BESS and power system, respectively. BESS damping control exhibits different properties. It is concluded by damping torque analysis that BESS clamping control implemented by regulating active power is better with less interaction with BESS voltage control and more robust to variations of power system operating conditions.

These two robotic missions were aimed at examining the presence of water and, thus, any evidence of life, and at understanding the geological conditions on Mars. These rovers have been successfully assisted by primary lithium-sulfur dioxide batteries during the critical entry, descent, and landing (EDL) maneuvers. These batteries were located on the petals of the lander, which, unlike in the Mars Pathfinder mission, was designed only to cany the rover. The selection of the lithium-sulfur dioxide battery system for this application was based on its high specific energy and high rate discharge capability, combined with low heat evolution, as dictated by this application. Lithium-sulfur dioxide batteries exhibit voltage delay, which tends to increase at low discharge temperatures, especially after extended storage at warm temperatures. In the absence of a depassivation circuit, as provided on earlier missions, e. g., Galileo, we were required to depassivate the lander primary batteries in a unique manner.

40|$|Abstract: This {{document}} {{covers the}} three most popular topologies of voltage references. These include bandgap and buried zener topologies in three-terminal series voltage references and zener topologies in two-terminal <b>shunt</b> <b>voltage</b> references. Also demystified are the definitions of common voltage reference parameters. The first considerations in choosing a voltage reference are output voltage and initial accuracy. Often overlooked, however, are the various other data-sheet parameters that can assume major importance in specific applications. The following discussion of voltage-reference basics will help you better understand the performance parameters associated with the most common voltage-reference topologies: the two-terminal shunt and the three-terminal series designs. Two-Terminal (Shunt) Reference As its name implies, the shunt reference operates in parallel with its load (Figure 1). It {{can be viewed as}} a voltage-controlled current sink in which the controlling voltage is applied to its input terminal. With no load applied, the shunt reference sinks just enough current so that the voltage drop across R 1 produces the desired output voltage (VIN- IREFR 1 = VREF). If, for example, VIN = 6. 0 V and the desired VREF is 5. 0 V, the reference IREF creates a 1. 0 V drop across R 1. The reference then makes IREF adjustments as necessary to maintain 5. 0 V across its input. Figure 1. The shunt reference is connected in parallel with its load...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Industrial & Manufacturing EngineeringThis {{study was}} aimed at {{evaluating}} the performance of contact conditioners in sliding electrical contacts. Cu-Cu and Al-Cu sliding contacts have been tested at current densities up to 933 A/mm 2 and 733 A/mm 2 respectively. A pin on disc type test setup was developed around a high speed lathe. The setup comprises of a mechanical loading system, test circuit carrying high current, customized electronics and a data acquisition system. The mechanical system consists of a mechanism for loading the pin at a constant pressure independent of wear and a three component piezoelectric force dynamometer. The high current circuit consists of power switch arrangement, a shunt resistance for measuring the current and current control resistances for setting the peak current. The electronics includes circuitry for triggering, and controlling {{the width of the}} current pulse. A four terminal contact voltage measurement was performed during sliding. The contact voltage, <b>shunt</b> <b>voltage,</b> normal and frictional force components were recorded using an A/D card continuously at a rate of 5 kHz. The average pin wear rate was obtained by measuring the weight and length of the pin before and after the test. Two different contact conditioners, a solid lubricant interface conditioner (SLIC) and Uniflor 8511 ® a PTFE thickened lubricant from Nye Lubricants were used. Test results for the copper-copper (C 110) sliding with SLIC shows tremendous improvement in contact life. Contacts pre-conditioned with SLIC, loaded to 10 MPa normal contact pressure and subjected to 3. 6 ms long current pulses of nominal current density 933 A/mm 2, survived for more than 4000 revolutions or passes (single pulse/rev) prior to the galling and failure. Sliding under current occurred at an average friction coefficient of 0. 24. In comparison, testing without any conditioner shows an average friction coefficient above 0. 6 and that the pin fails in less than 9 revolutions. Similar tests were carried out for Al 7075 -T 6 pin sliding on copper (C 110) plate. Testing was carried out in three stages, namely, preliminary testing to evaluate performance of SLIC and Uniflor under high speed sliding, interrupted testing to identify test track condition in the initial stage of sliding and further additional circular testing. Preliminary test results showed that Al transfers from the pin to the copper plate under high current. Testing with SLIC it was found that that the conditioner is less effective in this sliding system considering the amount of Al transfer to the copper plate. Further additional testing has been performed using Uniflor 8511. Additional circular testing shows that the average wear rate for sliding without current is much smaller as compared to sliding with current. A new mode of wear, namely, cutting of the transfer layers by the pin in subsequent passes, has been observed to increase the wear rate significantly once galling begins. Results also show that the thickness of the lubricant layer has an effect, with a thin layer of lubricant showing considerably increased friction coefficient and increased Al transfer to the test plate. Repeat pass testing with re-lubrication of pin between two passes provides some improvement in the average pin wear rate obtained. SLIC is a promising conditioner for high current density Cu-Cu sliding contacts but needs to be tested at higher sliding speeds. For Al-Cu sliding contacts, Uniflor 8511 delayed the onset of galling to about 30 - 40 passes (up to 3 pulses/rev), but could not reduce transfer of Al from the pin to the Cu plate...|$|E

We generated a plasmid encoding a modified green fluorescence protein-sialyltransferase (GFP-ST) chimera protein that was pH-sensitive and localized to the Golgi when transfected into HeLa cells and also CF and normal or cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator- (CFTR) -corrected airway epithelial cells. Digital imaging microscopy of these Golgi-localized probes showed {{that there was no}} correlation between pH(G) (6. 4 - 7. 0) and the presence of CFTR, whether cells were in HCO(3) (-) /CO(2) -containing or in HCO(3) (-) /CO(2) -free solutions. Activation of CFTR by raising cell [cAMP] had no effect on pH(G). Thus, CFTR seemed not to be involved in controlling pH(G). Experiments on HeLa cells using an avidin-sialyltransferase chimera in combination with a pH-sensitive fluorescent biotin indicated that even in cells that do not express CFTR, Cl(-) and K(+) conductances of the Golgi and other organelle membranes were large and that pH(G) was controlled solely by the H(+) v-ATPase countered by a H(+) leak. A mathematical model was applied to these and other published data to calculate passive H(+) permeability (P(H+)) of the Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, trans-Golgi network, recycling endosomes and secrety granules from a variety of cells. An organelle's acidity was inversely correlated to its calculated P(H+). We conclude that the CFTR plays a minor role in organelle pH regulation because other (Cl(-) and K(+)) channels are present in sufficient numbers to <b>shunt</b> <b>voltages</b> generated during H(+) pumping.
