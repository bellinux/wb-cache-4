Zdekauer, native of Bohemia, trained by German historiography’s method, hereafter active in Toscana, when he moved in the Marche, he managed to start a new deal of study in statutes and became also the President of Deputazione di Storia patria. In 1905 Zdekauer curated a section “Archives Exibition”, as part of the “ Marche Regional exhibition”, held in Macerata in 1905 : here they were exposed many <b>statutory</b> <b>texts</b> for valuing a still largely unknown heritage, dispersed in municipal historical archives of Marche...|$|R

40|$|THESIS 10810 This PhD thesis {{addresses}} {{the theory that}} the default preference for literal interpretation in the statutory context instantiates a formal conception of the rule of law. This claim is reflected in the Irish constitutional framework, which centres on the law making role of the legislature and envisages a restrictive interpretative role of the courts in light of this. The theory holds that in their reticence to depart from the literal rule judges comply with the rule of law, ensuring both non-arbitrariness in adjudication and the predictability of law by channeling the literal implications of <b>statutory</b> <b>texts</b> and not their own biases or values. I will argue that this claim cannot be substantiated. This will be based on an analysis of a number of key issues to the interpretative theory outlined...|$|R

It also describes the global financial crisis and demonstrates conclusions adopted earlier against its background. The basis of the thesis is the description of the Czech National Bank as an institution and position of its representatives. It focuses on the independence of the central bank and it mentions its responsibility in this context. These phenomena are analyzed on the basis of constitutional and <b>statutory</b> <b>texts</b> and a conclusion is drawn on a relatively high independence and only a small responsibility of the Czech National Bank. We stress that the Czech Naitonal Bank is a highly transparent institution. Attention is paid to the organizational and personal structure of the Czech National Bank. In the first part of the thesis, the Czech National Bank is defined as a public legal person representing one degree of the two-degree bank system endowed with a high level of independence.

40|$|The {{designers}} of products {{subject to the}} European regulations on waste {{have an obligation to}} improve the recyclability of their products from the very first design stages. The <b>statutory</b> <b>texts</b> refer to ISO standard 22 628, which proposes a method to calculate vehicle recyclability. There are several scientific studies that propose other calculation methods as well. Yet the feedback from the CREER club, a group of manufacturers and suppliers expert in ecodesign and recycling, is that the product recyclability calculation method proposed in this standard is not satisfactory, since only a mass indicator is used, the calculation scope is not clearly defined, and common data on the recycling industry does not exist to allow comparable calculations to be made for different products. For these reasons, it is difficult for manufacturers to have access to a method and common data for calculation purposes. A critical analysis of the standard and the various calculation methods identified in scientific journals was performed. An initial discussion brought to light several possible scopes of calculation. Additional indicators, such as quality loss or economic value loss, would be complementary to the mass indicator. Case studies were performed to compare these different methods. A new method and its scope of calculation are proposed in order to develop a reference method. CREE...|$|R
40|$|In a 2006 decision, eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L. L. C., the U. S. Supreme Court {{held that}} {{traditional}} equitable factors apply to injunctions in patent and copyright cases, {{and therefore the}} mere fact that a defendant has infringed a patent or a copyright does not necessarily mean a final injunction must issue. In the three years since, lower courts have denied final injunctions more frequently than before and are now struggling with what relief, if any, to give prevailing plaintiffs in lieu of an injunction. Some courts permit plaintiffs to sue again later. But most award prospective relief to plaintiffs¾sometimes a lump-sum damages award or more commonly a continuing royalty¾to compensate plaintiffs for the defendant’s anticipated postjudgment infringements. Plaintiffs often object to prospective-compensation awards as constituting compulsory licenses. This Article demonstrates that federal courts lack the authority, in either law or equity, to award prospective compensation for postjudgment copyright or patent infringements. Until Congress creates a new form of compulsory licensing, future-damage awards and continuing royalties can be granted in lieu of a final injunction only by consent of the parties. This Article reaches its conclusion only after undertaking the most comprehensive treatment of the subject to date. Apart from surveying the relevant <b>statutory</b> <b>texts,</b> it relies on a historical review of future-damage and continuing-royalty jurisprudence in England and the United States from 1660 to the present...|$|R
40|$|The warp and woof of American law are {{threaded}} by {{the appellate}} courts, generating precedents on constitutional provisions, <b>statutory</b> <b>texts,</b> and common-law doctrines. While {{the product of}} the appellate courts is regularly the subject of empirical study, less attention has been given to the sources and methods of appellate advocacy. Given the paramount place of written briefs in the appellate process, we should examine seriously the frequent complaint by appellate judges that briefs are too long and that prolixity weakens persuasive power. In a study of civil appeals in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, we discover that, for appellants, briefs of greater length are strongly correlated with success on appeal. For the party challenging an adverse decision below, persuasive completeness may be more important than condensed succinctness. The underlying cause of both greater appellant success and accompanying longer briefs may lie in the typically complex nature of the reversible civil appeal. In light of our findings, the current proposal to reduce the limits on number of words in federal appellate briefs may cut more sharply against appellants. Experienced appellate advocates submit that familiarity with appellate courts, the honed ability to craft the right arguments with the appropriate style in briefing, and expertise in navigating the appellate system provide superior legal representation to clients. Our study lends support to this claim. We found a positive correlation between success and experience for lawyers representing appellees, thus warranting further study of lawyer specialization...|$|R
