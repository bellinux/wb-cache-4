25|$|ABC News {{conducted}} a live, 90-minute debate that aired <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning</b> <b>on</b> {{a special edition}} of This Week, moderated by George Stephanopoulos at Drake University. All Republican candidates were present. Mitt Romney defended his change from a pro-choice to pro-life position on abortion. Ron Paul spoke of pulling U.S. troops out of Iraq. The debate concluded with the candidates' revealing their biggest mistakes. Frontrunners Mitt Romney, Rudy Giuliani, and John McCain were given more time to speak than were lesser-known candidates, as in previous debates.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} hours of <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning</b> <b>on</b> 2 December 1984, in cold sleety conditions, Mac Giolla Bhrighde and Fleming stole a Toyota van in Pettigo, County Donegal. The van was then loaded with 9 beer kegs, each {{containing}} 100lbs of low explosives. They then crossed the border and travelled to nearby Kesh, a village in the north of County Fermanagh. At the Drumrush Lodge Restaurant, just outside Kesh, they planted a landmine in a lane leading to the restaurant and wired up a device which was connected to an observation point. From there a hoax call was made to lure the British Army to the restaurant on the pretence that there was a firebomb planted within the restaurant.|$|E

25|$|Like {{many of its}} CBS-owned sister stations, it also airs Let's Make a Deal at 9:00a.m. weekdays, {{instead of}} the 2:00p.m. time slot where the program is carried nationally (this scheduling, which {{originated}} when Guiding Light occupied the final hour of CBS' daytime lineup prior to that program's discontinuance in September 2009, is more common among the network's owned-and-operated stations as well as select affiliates in the Eastern and Pacific Time Zones, where Let's Make a Deal would normally air in the 3:00p.m. time slot). Since it joined the network, KTVT has also aired CBS' children's program blocks over both Saturdays and Sundays (currently, it airs a half-hour of the CBS Dream Team on Sunday mornings before CBS News <b>Sunday</b> <b>Morning</b> <b>on</b> weeks when the network is scheduled to air sports events on Saturday late mornings).|$|E
2500|$|At 0135 on a <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning</b> <b>on</b> {{which the}} Gatwick area was {{affected}} by patches of dense freezing fog, Boeing 727 registration number YA-FAR (the only such aircraft in the company's fleet) descended below its correct glide slope as it approached the airport from the east. As it passed over the hamlet of Fernhill on the Surrey/Sussex border, it hit trees and roofs, began to roll and crashed into a field south of Fernhill Lane, [...] short of the runway. It collided with a large detached house, demolished it and caught fire.|$|E
2500|$|Mathis {{was quoted}} in a 1982 Us Magazine article, stating [...] "Homosexuality {{is a way of}} life that I've grown {{accustomed}} to." [...] However, he made no further comments on this, and Us Magazine later retracted the statement. In 2006, Mathis revealed that his silence had been because of death threats he received as a result of that 1982 article. On April 13, 2006, Mathis granted a podcast interview with The Strip in which he talked about the subject once again, and how some of his reluctance to speak on the subject was partially generational. During an interview with CBS News <b>Sunday</b> <b>Morning</b> <b>on</b> May 14, 2017, Mathis discussed the Us Magazine article and confirmed he is gay. [...] "I come from San Francisco. It's not unusual to be gay in San Francisco. I've had some girlfriends, some boyfriends, just like most people. But I never got married, for instance. I knew that I was gay." ...|$|E

60|$|Saturday {{night was}} cold and raw. Philip {{suffered}} horribly. From midday on Saturday till he dragged himself wearily to Athelny's house he ate nothing. He spent his last twopence on <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning</b> <b>on</b> a wash and a brush up in the lavatory at Charing Cross.|$|E
60|$|There was {{something}} ethereal {{in the clear}} tones. The {{last time he had}} heard anything like them he was sitting one <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning</b> <b>on</b> a shady lawn while the call of the bells came softly up to him across the English woods. He glanced at his comrades, but they showed no sign of hearing, and raising himself on one elbow he lay and listened, until the music, growing fainter and fainter, died away. Then, puzzled and half convinced that his imagination had played him some fantastic trick, he went to sleep.|$|E
60|$|So the {{fortnight}} slipped away, {{varied by}} {{nothing but the}} variation of the tide, which altered Mr. Peggotty's times of going out and coming in, and altered Ham's engagements also. When the latter was unemployed, he sometimes walked with us {{to show us the}} boats and ships, and once or twice he took us for a row. I don't know why one slight set of impressions should be more particularly associated with a place than another, though I believe this obtains with most people, in reference especially to the associations of their childhood. I never hear the name, or read the name, of Yarmouth, but I am reminded of a certain <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning</b> <b>on</b> the beach, the bells ringing for church, little Em'ly leaning on my shoulder, Ham lazily dropping stones into the water, and the sun, away at sea, just breaking through the heavy mist, and showing us the ships, like their own shadows.|$|E

60|$|Robert Ingersoll {{once said}} that the genial climate of California would in a fairly brief time evolve a race {{resembling}} the Mexicans, and that {{in two or three}} generations the Californians would be seen of a <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning</b> <b>on</b> their way to a cockfight with a rooster under each arm. Never was made a rasher generalisation, based on so absolute an ignorance of facts. It is to laugh. Here is a climate that breeds vigour, with just sufficient geniality to prevent the expenditure of most of that vigour in fighting the elements. Here is a climate where a man can work three hundred and sixty-five days in the year without the slightest hint of enervation, and where for three hundred and sixty-five nights he must perforce sleep under blankets. What more can one say? I consider myself somewhat of climate expert, having adventured among most of the climates of five out of the six zones. I have not yet been in the Antarctic, but whatever climate obtains there will not deter me from drawing the conclusion that nowhere is there a climate to compare with that of this region. Maybe I am as wrong as Ingersoll was. Nevertheless I take my medicine by continuing to live in this climate. Also, it is the only medicine I ever take.|$|E
60|$|And so Martin's {{role was}} {{arranged}} for him, while he, led on by Arthur and Norman, was meditating an extravagance. They {{were going out}} for a ride into the hills <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning</b> <b>on</b> their wheels, which did not interest Martin until he learned that Ruth, too, rode a wheel and was going along. He did not ride, nor own a wheel, but if Ruth rode, it was up to him to begin, was his decision; and when he said good night, he stopped in at a cyclery on his way home and spent forty dollars for a wheel. It was more than a month's hard-earned wages, and it reduced his stock of money amazingly; but when he added the hundred dollars he was to receive from the Examiner to the four hundred and twenty dollars that was the least The Youth's Companion could pay him, he felt that he had reduced the perplexity the unwonted amount of money had caused him. Nor did he mind, in the course of learning to ride the wheel home, the fact that he ruined his suit of clothes. He caught the tailor by telephone that night from Mr. Higginbotham's store and ordered another suit. Then he carried the wheel up the narrow stairway that clung like a fire-escape to the rear wall of the building, and when he had moved his bed out from the wall, found there was just space enough in the small room for himself and the wheel.|$|E
6000|$|... "That do I, my son, {{whether we}} gain the Holy Land or no. Methinks {{that it will}} do good service to the nation that Saxon and Norman should fight {{together}} under the holy cross. Hitherto the races have stood far too much apart. They have seen each other's bad qualities rather than good; but methinks that when the Saxon and the Norman stand {{side by side on}} the soil of the Holy Land, and shout together for England, it must needs bind them together, and lead them to feel that they are no longer Normans and Saxons, but Englishmen. I intend to preach on the village green at Evesham next <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning</b> <b>on</b> this subject, and as I know you are in communication with the forest men, I would, Cuthbert, that you would persuade them to come in to hear me. You were wondering what could be found for these vagrants. They have many of them long since lost the habits of honest labor. Many of them are still serfs, although most have been freed by the good earl and the knights his followers. Some of those who would fain leave the life in the woods still cling to it because they think that it would be mean to desert their comrades, who being serfs are still bound to lurk there; but methinks that this is a great opportunity for them. They are valiant men, and the fact that they are fond of drawing an arrow at a buck does not make them one whit the worse Christians. I will do my best to move their hearts, and if they will but agree together to take the cross, they would make a goodly band of footmen to accompany the earl." ...|$|E

6000|$|It came {{perhaps even}} {{too much to}} stand to him for ALL freedom-- since, for example, it was as much there as ever {{at the very time}} of Mrs. Rance's conspiring against him, at Fawns, with the billiard-room and the <b>Sunday</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>on</b> the {{occasion}} round which we have perhaps drawn our circle too wide. Mrs. Rance at least controlled practically each other license of the present and the near future: the license to pass the hour as he would have found convenient; the license to stop remembering, for a little, that, though if proposed to--and not only by this aspirant but by any other--he wouldn't prove foolish, the proof of wisdom was none the less, in such a fashion, rather cruelly conditioned; the license in especial to proceed from his letters to his journals and insulate, orientate, himself afresh by the sound, over his gained interval, of the many-mouthed monster the exercise of whose lungs he so constantly stimulated. Mrs. Rance remained with him till the others came back from church, and it was by that time clearer than ever that his ordeal, when it should arrive, would be really most unpleasant. His impression--this was the point--took somehow the form not so much of her wanting to press home her own advantage as of her building better than she knew; that is of her symbolising, with virtual unconsciousness, his own special deficiency, his unfortunate lack of a wife to whom applications could be referred. The applications, the contingencies with which Mrs. Rance struck him as potentially bristling, were not of a sort, really, to be met by one's self. And the possibility of them, when his visitor said, or as good as said, [...] "I'm restrained, you see, because of Mr. Rance, and also because I'm proud and refined; but if it WASN'T for Mr. Rance and for my refinement and my pride!"--the possibility of them, I say, turned to a great murmurous rustle, of a volume to fill the future; a rustle of petticoats, of scented, many-paged letters, of voices as to which, distinguish themselves as they might from each other, it mattered little in what part of the resounding country they had learned to make themselves prevail. The Assinghams and the Miss Lutches had taken the walk, through the park, to the little old church, [...] "on the property," [...] that our friend had often found himself wishing he were able to transport, as it stood, for its simple sweetness, in a glass case, to one of his exhibitory halls; while Maggie had induced her husband, not inveterate in such practices, to make with her, by carriage, the somewhat longer pilgrimage to the nearest altar, modest though it happened to be, of the faith--her own as it had been her mother's, and as Mr. Verver himself had been loosely willing, always, to let it be taken for his--without the solid ease of which, making the stage firm and smooth, the drama of her marriage might not have been acted out.|$|E
