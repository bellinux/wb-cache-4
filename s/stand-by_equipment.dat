40|$|This paper {{deals with}} repair {{strategies}} for <b>stand-by</b> <b>equipment</b> which maximises the time until a catastrophic event occurs –i. e. {{when there is}} a vital need for the equipment, and it is unable to respond. We model conflict situations where the environment in which the equipment is needed is controlled by an opponent. In this case the opponent's actions force the need for the equipment, and this situation is modelled as a stochastic game. We develop stochastic game models with constraints on effort and describe the form of the optimal maintenance/repair policy as well as presenting some numerical examples. <br/...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{is concerned with}} developing repair and training strategies for <b>stand-by</b> <b>equipment</b> which maximise the time until the equipment is unable to respond when it is needed. Equipment can only be used {{if it is in}} an operable state and the users have had sufficient recent training on it. Thus it is necessary to decide when to maintain/repair the equipment and when to use the equipment for training. Both actions mean the equipment is not readily available for use in an emergency. We develop discrete time Markov decision process formulations of this problem in order to investigate the form of the optimal policies which maximise the expected survival time until a catastrophic event when an emergency occurs and the equipment cannot respond. We also calculate the solution in a number of numerical examples...|$|E

There are also <b>stand-by</b> fire fighting <b>equipment</b> and metal detectors which have been put in place to avoid any misfortunes. The stadium has been slated to host the AFCON qualifying series against South Africa on 17 November.Local team Akwa United moved into the stadium in 2015 when their ground was being brought up to code.|$|R
50|$|The Mark V system, {{the first}} {{installed}} at Burbank, was in operation for one day. Though the equipment operated correctly, it failed because the personnel {{could not remember}} the correct configuration from one rehearsal to the next. The crew then developed the simpler Mark VI setup that consisted of three stage speakers, three program tracks and a three-tone control track. The first serious dubbing of Fantasia was attempted on this system. The Mark VII {{was the first to}} be manufactured by RCA that closely resembled the Mark VI, but included tone rectifier modifications. The Mark VIII system was a rearranged version of the Mark VII. A log-log tone rectifier designed by RCA replaced the linear tone rectifier used in the Mark VII. The second dubbing of Fantasia was done through this system. Following the installation of a <b>stand-by</b> channel, this <b>equipment</b> was installed in New York City for the film's premiere. Two further systems were developed after the film's opening. The arrangement of the Mark IX setup was changed and two sets of rear speakers were manually switched in to supplement or replace the left and right front speakers at several points in the film. In the Mark X, the switching and level changes in the rear speakers are done automatically using a thyratron and mechanical relay system operated by means of notches {{on the edge of the}} film. This was developed by Disney engineers C. A. Hisserich and Tickner. Disney became an early customer for the newly established Hewlett-Packard company when it ordered eight of its Model 200B oscillators to test the Fantasound systems.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a part of a master’s degree in Technology and Safety in the High North at the University of Tromsø- The Arctic University of Norway. The thesis has been written during the spring {{semester}} of 2016. Safety is a large part of maritime operations and all tools to improve safety and reliability is considered. Even in these days when economy in the oil related industry is worse than ever. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) ensures that all suppliers and contractors are obliged to follow rules and regulations in order to ensure a safe workplace for all members the industry and protection of the environment all over the globe. One of those regulations is the International Code for Safe Operations of Ships and Pollution Prevention (International Safety Management (ISM) Code) paragraph 10. 3 : “The company should identify equipment and technical systems the sudden operational failure of which may result in hazardous situations. The SMS should provide for specific measures aimed at promoting the reliability of such equipment or systems. These measures should include the regular testing of <b>stand-by</b> arrangements and <b>equipment</b> or technical systems that are not in continuous use. “ The subject of the thesis is “Analysis of potential critical equipment and technical systems on a modern PSV- Recommending a method for Troms Offshore Management AS”. The thesis will look at several methods that may be used to comply with the ISM Code 10. 3. These methods is tested on an equipment or technical system that is used on a vessel in the Troms Offshore fleet, whereas those tests was presented to two expert panels in order to obtain information on how these methods are interpreted and found usable in practice. The method that is most suited in regards to being able to perform for all equipment and technical systems, being understandable for the intended readers, being constructed in a way that everyone can achieve the same result and being able to express enough information that everyone can access the reason for why the conclusion is what it is will be recommended for further use in Troms Offshore. Based on the feedback from the expert panels and the authors analysis was a method designed by the author, The Ajabu method, found most suitable. Some improvements was done before the method became recommended for use. Key words: ISM Code, maritime safety, hazardous situation, PSV, sudden failure, SMS, method, analysis, offshore...|$|R
