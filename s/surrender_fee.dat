40|$|Variable annuities {{represent}} certain unit-linked {{life insurance}} products offering {{different types of}} protection {{commonly referred to as}} guaranteed minimum benefits (GMXBs). They are designed for the increasing demand of the customers for private pension provision. In this paper we analytically price variable annuities with guaranteed minimum repayments at maturity and in case of the insured’s death. If the contract is prematurely surrendered, the policyholder is entitled to the current value of the fund account reduced by the prevailing <b>surrender</b> <b>fee.</b> The financial market and the mortality model are affine linear. For the surrender model, a Cox process is deployed whose intensity is given by a deterministic function (s-curve) with stochastic inputs from the financial market. So, the policyholders’ surrender behavior depends on the performance of the financial market and is stochastic. The presented pricing scheme incorporates the stochastic surrender behavior of the policyholders and is only based on suitable closed-form approximations...|$|E
50|$|The {{value of}} the {{investment}} is often subject to a surrender charge in determining the cash value. A surrender charge offsets {{the costs associated with}} selling the contract and allows these contracts to be sold with little or no up front <b>fees.</b> <b>Surrender</b> charges are imposed when a contract is cancelled within a set time frame. Any cancellation after that time frame are not subject to a surrender charge. Typically surrender charges decrease on an annual schedule until they disappear altogether.|$|R
