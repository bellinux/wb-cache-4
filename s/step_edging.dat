40|$|Abstract. Using an STMJHREELS system, we have {{investigated}} {{the relationship between the}} surface morphology and vibrational modes of C 60 adsorbed on Cu(l 11). At 300 K, CGO is mobile on the Cu(ll 1) terrace, but is more strongly bound at the <b>step</b> <b>edge.</b> Therefore, any C 60 which adsorbs on the terrace will migrate to the <b>step</b> <b>edge</b> where it is immobilized. Thus for very low coverages, the ChO preferentially adsorbs at the <b>step</b> <b>edge.</b> Adsorption of the molecule on metal surfacesresults in asignificant amount ofcharge transfer from the substrate to the C 60 molecule.

40|$|Scanning {{tunneling}} microscopy is used {{to monitor}} the formation and relaxation of nanoprotrusions and nanoindentations at extended <b>step</b> <b>edges</b> following submonolayer deposition of Ag on Ag(100). Deposition of up to about 1 / 4 ML Ag produces isolated two-dimensional (2 D) Ag clusters, which subsequently diffuse, collide, and coalesce with extended <b>step</b> <b>edges,</b> thus forming protrusions. Deposition of larger submonolayer amounts of Ag causes existing <b>step</b> <b>edges</b> to advance across terraces, incorporating 2 D islands.

(YBCO) <b>step</b> <b>edge</b> junctions, {{properties of the}} grain boundary, and Josephson flux-flow transistors based on YBCO <b>step</b> <b>edge</b> junctions. A home made dc magnetron sputtering system {{was used for the}} fabrication of GBCO thin films. Epitaxial films on various substrates with the critical temperature T c of about 90 K and the critical current density j c of above 10 6 A/cm 2 at 77 K were routinely obtained. A process based on an amorphous carbon (a-C) film mask and electron beam lithography was developed for making YBCO <b>step</b> <b>edge</b> junctions. Because of the very low ion milling rate of the a-C film and the high resolution of e-beam lithography, sharp and straight <b>step</b> <b>edges</b> were successfully fabricated on LaAlO 3 (LAO) substrates. YBCO thin films patterned to narrow strips across the <b>step</b> <b>edge</b> gave high quality Josephson junctions. Their current-voltage (I-V) curves could well be described by the resistively shunted junction (RSJ) model. Their critical current {{as a function of the}} applied magnetic field I c (B) showed Fraunhofer-like patterns. By intentionally fabricating wavy <b>step</b> <b>edges,</b> we found that junctions across the wavy <b>step</b> <b>edge</b> showed neither flux-flow type, nor RSJ type I-V curves. The magnetic field modulation of Ic was very small even at 77 K (less than 5 %), indicating large excess current and nonuniform current distribution. High resolution cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy studies showed that the nucleation and growth of the YBCO film on wavy <b>step</b> <b>edges</b> were much more complicated as compared to that on straight <b>step</b> <b>edges,</b> e. g., second phase particles usually appeared in the YBCO film along the wavy <b>step</b> <b>edge</b> region. Properties of the grain boundary were investigated. Electromagnetic resonances, i. e. Fiske and flux-flow resonances, were observed from the I-V curves. The existence of electromagnetic resonances suggested that the barrier was dielectric. Three different methods, i. e. the McCumber constant ß c, Fiske and flux-flow resonances, were used to estimate the shunting capacitance of the junction. The capacitance value per unit area was found to be between 12 - 35 fF/. my. m 2 for junctions on LAO substrates. Tunneling experiments on <b>step</b> <b>edge</b> junctions gave strong evidence that the grain boundary consisted of an insulating layer.
