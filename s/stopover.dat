40|$|<b>Stopovers</b> {{along the}} flyway of the Siberian Crane in the taiga zone of northeastern Asia {{have not been}} {{previously}} described. In this study, we provide the first investigation of the <b>stopovers</b> of its eastern population in the taiga zone (2006 - 2011). Seven spring <b>stopovers</b> at bogs were investigated for 10 - 24 hr each. The birds spent 5 - 6 hr sleeping at night, while 54 - 74 % of their time was spent foraging outside the sleep time budget. Based on excreta samples, only 5 / 109 cranes successfully obtained adequate food during <b>stopovers</b> at typical bogs. Favorable foraging conditions were found at the rare shallow lakes or at Elk Alces alces salt licks where the foraging efficiency was 16 times greater than at bogs unaffected by ungulates. Elk activity led to areas of peat exposure in bogs where the availability of edible grass rhizomes and readily extractable sprouts were increased for the Siberian Crane. Investigations at three autumn <b>stopovers</b> at poor forage riverbeds lasted for 0. 3 - 11. 0 hr and were interrupted by boating activities, as were 22 other reported <b>stopovers.</b> Cranes allocated {{a high proportion of}} their time to foraging, which they commenced immediately after landing. However, the cranes failed to acquire any significant sustenance during the overwhelming majority of taiga <b>stopovers.</b> Our investigation showed that the eastern population was not specialized in foraging at typical taiga wetlands. Humans indirectly aggravated the naturally harsh migration conditions by overhunting Elk on the flyway and intensive boating activities during the most intense migration period...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Transshipments and <b>stopovers</b> are {{considered}} to be an effective method to reduce traveling distance where a transportation job can be served by two vehicles: One picks up a load and drops it at a transshipment point and then another vehicle carries that load to the final delivery place. The goal {{of this study is to}} develop a decision support system for open vehicle routing with transshipments and <b>stopovers.</b> We propose a heuristic to find transshipments and <b>stopovers</b> opportunities from an initial routing. Decision methods consist of four main processes: (1) Searching jobs that allow transshipment opportunity, (2) searching paths that allow transshipment opportunity, (3) matching paths and (4) selecting jobs to create new paths with transshipment. The output is the improved routing with transshipments and <b>stopovers,</b> resulting lower total costs. From computational experiments, our proposed method could reduce the system’s total cost up to 12. 42 percent as compared to the typical routing without transshipments and <b>stopovers.</b> We design system database and user interfaces, considering all input requirement entering and result displays that are easily used, so that the system can be effectively applied in actual working environments...|$|R

Also, the Atlantic Coast Joint Venture has been protecting the habitat of the American black duck through habitat restoration and land acquisition projects, mostly within their wintering and breeding areas.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a network planning problem called the hub network design problem with <b>stopovers</b> and feeders. Most, if not all, {{of the recent}} logistics research on hub-and-spokes networks has assumed that all nodes in the network are connected by direct flights to the hub. However, in the network used by the Federal Express Co., most flights {{to and from the}} hub make one or more <b>stopovers,</b> and many smaller cities are served by feeder aircraft which connect to other nonhub cities. This paper explores the tradeoffs and savings involved with <b>stopovers</b> and feeders, and develops a mixed-integer program to design the least-cost single-hub air network assuming that the hub location is already determined. The model is then applied to the western U. S. portion of the Federal Express package collection system. Comparing the optimal results to the pure hub-and-spokes network proves that substantial improvements in cost, miles flown, load factor and number of aircraft can be achieved by using <b>stopovers</b> and feeders in a hub network, and that it is unrealistic to assume a network with only direct flights. Comparison with the actual Federal Express network shows many similarities (which suggest that the model is capturing the important design criteria), and several differences (which indicate the model's potential for improving efficiency). The usefulness of the model for a company's comprehensive network planning and for hub location modeling is discussed. ...|$|R
5|$|Often, the {{migration}} route of a long-distance migrator bird doesn't follow {{a straight line}} between breeding and wintering grounds. Rather, it could follow a hooked or arched line, with detours around geographical barriers.
