50|$|Internal water pulses {{from the}} straw (into the drop) and air {{movement}} around the suspended solution drop, {{can cause the}} rafts to spin swiftly around the drop surface. If {{there is almost no}} air movement around the suspended drop, then after approximately 12 minutes or more, the micro rafts may join up and form a latticework, which covers the entire drop surface. If the solution drop hangs too long on the straw (≈ >30 minutes), it may completely calcify over and block the calthemite <b>straw</b> <b>tip.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Calthemite straw stalactites precipitated (deposited) from hyperalkaline {{leachate}} {{have the}} potential to grow up to ≈200 times faster than normal cave speleothems precipitated from near neutral pH solution. One calthemite [...] "soda" [...] straw has been recorded as growing 2 mm per day over several consecutive days, when the leachate drip rate was a constant 11 minutes between drips. When the drip rate is more frequent than one drop per minute, there is no discernible deposition of CaCO3 {{at the tip of the}} stalactite (hence no growth) and the leachate solution falls to the ground where the CaCO3 is deposited to create a calthemite stalagmite. If the leachate supply to the stalactite straw's tip reduces to a level where the drip rate is greater than approximately 25 to 30 minutes between drops, there is a chance that the <b>straw</b> <b>tip</b> will calcify over and block up. New straw stalactites can often form next to a previously active, but now dry (dormant) straw, because the leachate has simply found an easier path through the micro cracks and voids in the concrete structure.|$|E
60|$|Elsie {{started toward}} the door, near which were {{gathered}} in groups some twenty or thirty girls. One big girl with a black <b>straw</b> hat <b>tipped</b> down over her eyes {{stepped in front of}} her.|$|R
60|$|The {{people in}} the outer room stared at him wonderingly and the officer of the guard saluted the boy respectfully. But Rob only smiled in an amused way as he marched past them with his hands thrust deep into his trousers' pockets and his <b>straw</b> hat <b>tipped</b> jauntily upon {{the back of his}} head.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked so}} bright and charming in her snowy apron and her boy's <b>straw</b> hat <b>tipped</b> jauntily over one pink ear that David and Steve and Bill, and even Shep, {{found a way}} to get a word with her, and the poor fellows in the high straw pile looked their disappoimment and shook their forks in mock rage at the lucky dogs on the ground. But Will worked on like a fiend, while the dapples of light and shade fell on the bright face of the merry girl.|$|R
60|$|The {{others were}} not at all afraid; but the Scarecrow at once decided to save those of the party who were liable to be injured by the angry birds. So he {{commanded}} Tip to take off Jack's head and lie down {{with it in the}} bottom of the nest, and when this was done he ordered the Woggle-Bug to lie beside Tip. Nick Chopper, who knew from past experience Just what to do, then took the Scarecrow to pieces (all except his head) and scattered the <b>straw</b> over <b>Tip</b> and the Woggle-Bug, completely covering their bodies.|$|R
30|$|Two {{months later}} the early rice in Gasa basin had all been reaped and the straw was already dried. One day Zhenggui Dao {{led me to the}} forest again. This time he first tied a large bunch of dried <b>straw</b> to the <b>tip</b> of a long bamboo pole. When we arrived at the nest we saw the branch that had been {{previously}} cut down was already dry but still hung there. Zhenggui Dao set fire to both the straw and the branch. The flames were so strong that it formed a huge one-meter-square fireball. Dao poked this long torch under the nest, and the wasps were all burned to death and fell down to the earth, crackling and smoking. After the torch went out, Dao climbed up the tree and cut the nest down with a knife. He cut open the burned comb with its layers of sieve like nests. There was a white and fat wasp larva as large as a little finger in almost every hole. Some pupated into light yellow pupae but did not emerge from the pupal case. Dao weighed it and told me happily that he had gained two or three catties of wasp “meat.” Back home that evening Dao fried the wasp larva and cooked a crisp golden dish. The grubs, eggs, and Chinese chive were also boiled into a full pot. We had a very good meal with self-brewed rice wine.|$|R
