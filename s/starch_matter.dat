40|$|The work {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} diversity and comparison of value for cultivation and use of early maturing potato cultivars registered with the Polish National Register of Cultivars. The comparison was based on 17 yield and appearance traits and quality attributes of tubers {{as well as their}} resistance to diseases. The analysis employed the following multi-dimensional statistical methods: principal component analysis and cluster analysis. The principal component analysis revealed that over 70 % of the total variation was associated with the first 6 principal components. Cluster analysis yielded 4 groups of genotypes. The first group consisted of the cultivars which produced tubers with the most shallow eyes, the best flavour and the least severe darkening of raw flesh. The cultivars in the second group produced high yields and were low in <b>starch,</b> dry <b>matter</b> and glycoalkaloids. The tubers of cultivars which were classified into the third group had the highest <b>starch,</b> dry <b>matter</b> and vitamin C contents. However, they produced the lowest yields and were quite susceptible to most diseases.

Twelve Chinese Holstein dairy cows (627 [*]±[*] 19.9  kg BW; 180 [*]±[*] 8 DIM) in second-parity fitted with 10  cm ruminal cannulas (Bar Diamond, Parma, ID) were divided into three treatments. Treatments included a control diet (CON; 20 % <b>starch,</b> dry <b>matter</b> basis), a high-concentrate diet (HC; 33.2 % <b>starch,</b> dry <b>matter</b> basis) and high-concentrate diet supplemented with 180  mg thiamine/kg dry matter intake (HCT).

40|$|The {{influence}} of starch structure (absolute (AAM), free (FAM), lipid complexed (LAM) amylose contents and amylopectin chain length distribution) on swelling behaviour (swelling power (SP), close packing concentration (C), total starch solubility (S) and amylose leaching (AML) in a temperature range between 55 and 125 degreesC) and pasting properties (6, 8 and 10 % dry <b>matter</b> <b>starch)</b> of five waxy and 10 normal (low (three), intermediate (four) and high (three) peak gelatinisation temperature) rice starches was investigated. At temperatures between 55 and 85 degreesC, waxy starches had higher SP than normal starches. In this temperature range, however, SP and C* {{of the normal}} starches were independent of AAM and FAM. On the contrary, at temperatures between 95 and 125 degreesC, SP and C* of all starches decreased and increased with AAM and FAM contents, respectively. For the normal starches, SP decreased and C* increased with LAM contents at 65 degreesC. For all starches, relative amounts of short amylopectin chains with degrees of polymerisation (DP) 6 - 9 led to increased SP and decreased C* at 55 and 65 degreesC. Opposite results were observed for relative amounts of longer amylopectin chains with DP 12 - 22. AAM and FAM contents decreased with starting gel point temperatures (6, 8 and 10 % dry <b>matter</b> <b>starch)</b> of normal intermediate and high peak gelatinisation temperature starches. Peak and breakdown viscosities (6 % dry <b>matter</b> <b>starch)</b> decreased, whereas setback and final viscosities (10 % dry <b>matter</b> <b>starch)</b> increased with AAM and FAM contents of all investigated starches. Chains of DP 6 - 9 and 12 - 22, respectively, decreased and increased starting gel point temperatures. No significant correlations between amylopectin chain length distribution and peak, breakdown, setback and final viscosities were observed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

30|$|Ruminal {{thiamine}} deficiencies {{occur when}} dairy cows are overfed with high-concentrate diet, and thiamine supplementation {{has been proved}} to attenuate high-concentrate diet induced SARA. However, there is limited knowledge {{of the relationship between}} thiamine supplementation in high-concentrate diets and ruminal fungi. In order to investigate the impacts of thiamine supplementation on ruminal fungi, twelve Chinese Holstein dairy cows were randomly assigned into three treatments: control diet (CON; 20 % <b>starch,</b> dry <b>matter</b> basis), high-concentrate diet (HC; 33.2 % <b>starch,</b> dry <b>matter</b> basis) and high-concentrate diet supplemented with 180  mg thiamine/kg dry matter intake. Dry matter intake and milk production were recorded during the experimental periods. On day 21, rumen fluid samples were collected at 3  h postfeeding and ruminal pH, thiamine concentration and volatile fatty acids were measured. Metagenome sequencing method was conducted to detect ruminal fungi composition. Feeding HC significantly decreased dry matter intake, milk production, ruminal pH, ruminal acetate and thiamine concentration, however, significantly increased propionate and isovalerate (P[*]<[*] 0.05). These changes were inversed by thiamine supplementation (P[*]<[*] 0.05). Totally, seven phyla and almost 1050 species of rumen fungi were identified across all samples in which especially, 3 genera and 10 species of strictly anaerobic fungi phylum Neocallimastigomycota was found. Principal coordinate analysis indicated that feeding HC and thiamine supplementation caused a significant inverse in ruminal fungi composition. Feeding HC significantly decreased the abundance of fungi compared with CON (P[*]<[*] 0.05) while thiamine supplementation significantly increased the abundance of ruminal fungi (P[*]<[*] 0.05). These results indicated that thiamine supplementation may effectively attenuate rumen metabolic disorder caused by HC diet through buffering the ruminal pH, shifting the rumen fermentation pattern and increasing the abundance of ruminal fungi. The findings in this study could therefore contribute to the further understanding of the mechanism of thiamine’s function in dairy cows.|$|R
40|$|An in vivo {{experiment}} {{was performed to}} determine the effect of level of maize starch in the diet on digestion and site of digestion of organic <b>matter,</b> <b>starch</b> and neutral detergent fibre (NDF). In a repeated change-over design experiment, three cows fitted with a rumen cannula and T-piece cannulae in duodenum and ileum received a low-starch (12 % of ration dry matter) and a high-starch (33 % of ration dry <b>matter)</b> diet. <b>Starch</b> level was increased by exchanging dried sugar beet pulp by ground maize. After a 2 -week adaptation period, feed intake, rumen fermentation parameters (in vivo and in situ), intestinal flows, faecal excretion of organic <b>matter,</b> <b>starch</b> and NDF were estimated. When the high-starch diet was fed, dry matter intake was higher (19. 0 kg/day vs. 17. 8 kg/day), and total tract digestibility of organic <b>matter,</b> <b>starch</b> and NDF was lower when the low-starch diet was fed. Maize starch concentration had no significant effect on rumen pH and volatile fatty acid concentration nor on the site of digestion of organic <b>matter</b> and <b>starch</b> and rate of passage of ytterbium-labelled forage. On the high-starch diet, an extra 1. 3 kg of maize starch was supplied at the duodenum in relation to the low-starch diet, but only an extra 0. 3 kg of starch was digested in the small intestine. Digestion of NDF was only apparent in the rumen and was lower on the high-starch diet than on the low-starch diet, mainly attributed to the reduction in sugar beet pulp in the high-starch diet. It was concluded that without the correction for the reduction in NDF digestion in the rumen, the extra supply of glucogenic (glucose and propionic acid) and ketogenic nutrients (acetic and butyric acid) by supplemented starch will be overestimated. The mechanisms responsible for these effects need to be addressed in feed evaluation...|$|R

40|$|An {{off-line}} near-infrared reflectance (NIR) {{feasibility study}} was conducted to explore the critical steps in the NIR determination of the major potato constituents (dry <b>matter,</b> <b>starch,</b> and protein) in relatively large (10 kg) potato samples. The results were important for the design of an automated industrial analysis system for potatoes with in-line NIR. The 10 -kg potato samples were pulped with an industrial rotary saw blade rasp. A critical step in the NIR measurements was the occurrence of phase separation in the potato pulp. Phase separation manifests itself directly after pulping the potatoes and significantly affects the NIR spectrum. Therefore, during the NIR measurements, the potato pulp had to be stirred continuously. The NIR spectra (1, 100 - 2, 500 nm) were measured by applying an optical fiber NIR probe (EDAPT- 1) connected to the NIR spectrophotometer (Technicon Infralyzer IA 500). NIR models for the concentration of dry <b>matter,</b> <b>starch,</b> and coagulating protein in potatoes have been developed. With the partial least squares regression procedure, promising NIR models were calculated. The NIR models were validated using an independent validation set of potato samples. The root mean square error in prediction of the samples in the validation set was 0. 5 % (w/w) for dry matter, 0. 63 (w/w) for starch concentration, and 0. 06 % (w/w) for the coagulating protein. © 2010 EAPR...|$|R

In both experiments, 6 multiparous, rumen-fistulated Holstein dairy cows were used in a 2 -treatment, 2 -period crossover design. Each experimental period consisted of 21 d (total of 42 d). Experiment 1 {{was to investigate the}} effects of SARA on thiamine status in blood and rumen fluid. Treatments were either control (20 % <b>starch,</b> dry <b>matter</b> basis) or SARA-inducing diet (SAID, 33. 2 % <b>starch,</b> dry <b>matter</b> basis). In experiment 2, the effects of dietary thiamine supplementation on attenuating SARA and ruminal fermentation characteristics in dairy cows were studied. All cows received the same SAID diet during the whole experimental period; treatments were with or without thiamine (180 mg of thiamine/kg of dry matter intake). In both experiments, rumen fluid samples were collected at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 h after morning feeding on d 21 and 42 of the experiments for measurement of pH, thiamine, volatile fatty acid, and lactate contents. Peripheral blood was also collected at 3 h after morning feeding on d 21 and 42 to measure thiamine, carbohydrate metabolites, and enzyme activities. In experiment 1, cows fed the SAID diet had lower ruminal and plasma thiamine concentrations and higher lactate than cows fed the control diet. The ruminal thiamine contents were positively related to pH and the concentrations of acetate in the rumen, and negatively correlated with the lactate contents. Experiment 2 demonstrated that ruminal pH and the concentrations of thiamine, acetate, and total volatile fatty acids in the rumen were increased, whereas ruminal lactate contents were reduced by thiamine supplementation. The concentrations of lactate and the activity of lactate dehydrogenase in blood were reduced in the thiamine supplemented group, and the opposite was true for the nonesterified fatty acids and α-ketoneglutarate dehydrogenase contents. In conclusion, the thiamine status was affected by SARA in dairy cows and ruminal infusion of thiamine could helpattenuate SARA by improving the proportions of ruminal volatile fatty acids and reducing lactate contents in rumen fluid and blood.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} the variability analysis of some quantitative characteristics, {{that is of}} tuber yield, starch content and yield, dry matter content and yield and vitamin C content in selected edible potato varieties. Reciprocal relations of variance components calculated and their percentage share in the total variability were a measure of variability evaluation for the characteristics examined. Moreover, the variability of the characteristics was characterised {{by means of the}} classical variability coefficient. It has been found that tuber yield and vitamin C content variability was determined mainly by the interaction effects of years and the factors examined, as well as the experimental error. The respective values were as follows: 44. 3 % and 34. 7 % for tuber yield, and 42. 2 % and 46. 2 % for vitamin C. The starch content was in 47. 5 % modified by the effects of the main factors (including 35. 0 % for years) and the error effect (39. 0 %). A similar interaction was observed in the case of dry matter content variability, but the error was 52. 4 %. <b>Starch</b> and dry <b>matter</b> yields were determined mainly by interaction effects of the years and the examined factors (40. 7 % and 39. 9 %, respectively) as well as the experimental error (32. 2 % of the total variability for both traits).

Differences among five sorghum lines were significant for 12 -h dry matter digestion and ranged from 229 to 272 g kg 21. This procedure provides a precise and rapid technique that can be used by feed grain breeders to evaluate modifications in grain digestion parameters...|$|R
40|$|An {{in vitro}} {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to assess how non-starch polysaccharide (NSP) -degrading enzymes influence fermentation of dietary fibre in the pig large intestine. Seven wheat and barley products and cultivars with differing carbohydrate fractions (CHO) were hydrolyzed using pepsin and pancreatin in the presence or not of NSP-degrading enzymes (xylanase and b-glucanase) and the filter retentate fermented with sow fecal bacteria. Dry <b>matter,</b> <b>starch,</b> crude protein and β-glucan digestibilities during hydrolysis were measured. Fermentation kinetics of the hydrolyzed ingredients were modelled. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) production and molar ratio were compared after 12, 24 and 72 h. Microbial communities were analyzed after 72 h of fermentation using terminal {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (TRFLP). The results showed an increase of nutrient digestibility (P< 0. 001), whereas fermentability and SCFA production decreased (P< 0. 001) with addition of the enzyme. SCFA and bacterial community profiles indicated also a shift from propionate to acetate and an increase in cellulolytic Ruminoccocus- and xylanolytic Clostridium-like bacteria. This is explained by the increase in slowly fermentable insoluble CHO and the lower proportion of rapidly fermentable β-glucan and starch in the retentate when grains were incubated with NSP-degrading enzymes. Shifts were also different for the 4 barley varieties investigated, showing that the efficiency of the enzymes depends on the structure of the CHO fractions in cereal products and cultivars.

40|$|Global {{awareness}} {{of health and}} environmental issues has stimulated interest in alternative Agricultural systems like organic farming. Elephant foot yam (Amorphophallus paeoniifolius) and yams (Dioscorea spp.) are ethnic starchy vegetables with high energy, nutritive and medicinal values. Field experiments were conducted at the Central Tuber Crops Research Institute, Thiruvananthapuram, India, during 2004 - 2011 to assess the agronomic, nutritional and economic advantages of organic farming over conventional system in these crops. Organic farming resulted in 10 - 20 % higher yield over conventional practice in these crops. A net profit of Rs 2, 15, 776 ha- 1, which was 28 % higher over chemical based farming was obtained under organic management in elephant foot yam. Elite and local varieties responded equally well to organic and conventional farming in elephant foot yam. White yam, greater yam and lesser yam responded similarly to both the systems, with slightly higher yield under organic practice. Soil physico-chemical properties and microbial count were also improved under organic management. Organic farming scored significantly higher soil quality index (1. 93) than conventional practice (1. 46). The soil quality index was driven by water holding capacity, pH and available Zn followed by soil organic matter. Tuber quality was improved with higher dry <b>matter,</b> <b>starch,</b> crude protein and lower oxalate contents. Cost effective technologies were field validated...|$|R
40|$|For {{determination}} of cooking quality characteristics of advanced clones and potato cultivars, this experiment {{was conducted to}} determine the quality characteristics on the three advanced clones (397009 - 3, 397082 - 2 and 396156 - 6) and three potato cultivars (Agria, Marfona and Savalan) under in vitro condition in Ardabil, Iran in 2009. Experimental design was completely randomized with three replications. In the study some of characters were measured such as dry <b>matter</b> and <b>starch</b> percent, specific gravity, french-fry and chips color and quality, cooking type, texture firmness and flavor. Analysis of variance showed that significant differences between cultivars and clones for tuber yield, dry <b>matter</b> and <b>starch</b> percent, specific gravity, french-fry and chips color and quality and reducing sugars amount. The 397082 - 2, 396156 - 6, 397009 - 3 clones and Savalan cultivar had the highest yield. The highest dry <b>matter,</b> <b>starch</b> and specific gravity belonged to 396156 - 6 and 397009 - 3 clones and Savalan cultivar. These cultivars had C cooking type. Therefore, the 396156 - 6 clone and Savalan cultivar are recommended for chips production, 397009 - 3 clone for french-fry, chips and starch production. The Marfona cultivar had a lower dry matter and B cooking type. Potatoes of this type are suitable for eating boiled, mashing and fresh and conserve potato consumption...|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} the waste {{sampling}} procedure and chemical analysis was evaluated in a research program on characterization of organic waste obtained after disc screening of source-separated organic household waste. The sampling procedures focused on a truckload of waste and involved several steps of subsampling including shredding, mixing, blending, high-speed-blending, drying and milling prior to analysis of the organic waste with respect to ash content, crude fibers, crude fat, crude protein, sugar, <b>starch,</b> enzyme-digestible organic <b>matter,</b> P, N, C, H, S and calorific value. The statistical evaluation of the procedures involved 10 samples of the same truckload of waste obtained by splitting the sample at each level in the procedure according to a staggered, incomplete nested statistical design. Furthermore, one sample was analysed six times {{over a period of}} approximately one year. The statistical evaluation showed that no single step in the sampling procedure contributed with excessive variance and that the variance caused by the sampling procedure was approximately the same as the variance in the chemical analysis observed over a year. The variance varied with the analytical parameter but for most parameters the uncertainty was satisfactorily low (of the order of 3 - 10 % expressed as the relative standard deviation, which is considered to be satisfactory for waste characterization).

40|$|Summary &mdash; It is {{recognized}} that {{an increase in}} digestible energy (DE) can improve the growth per-formance and protein retention efficiency in rainbow trout. Growth and digestibility trials were con-ducted to evaluate possible incorporation of triticale (Clercal, a soft wheat x rye hybrid, hexaploid va-riety) as a potential source of DE for rainbow trout. Four diets were formulated with graded levels of native triticale (0 - 30 % of dry matter) and 2 others with pre-cooked triticale at 20 and 30 % of DM. All diets were isoproteic (crude protein: 43 % DM) and isoenergetic (gross energy: 20 kJ/g DM). Digesti-bility of dry <b>matter,</b> <b>starch</b> and energy was affected by both level and nature of triticale. Cooking (15 5 min, 110 °C) improved nutrient digestibilities of diets containing triticale. Growth performance and nutrient retention efficiencies were higher in fish fed diets containing precooked triticale than in those receiving equivalent amounts of native triticale. Triticale appears to hold potential value as an ingredient in trout diets provided some pretreatment of the cereal is made to improve starch digesti-bility. triticale / rainbow trout I digestibility I starch / energy Résumé &mdash; Possibilité d’incorporation du triticale dans le régiment alimentaire de la truite arc-en-ciel.

40|$|Steers (379 +/- 10 kg) with ruminal, duodenal, and ileal cannulas {{were used}} in a 5 x 5 Latin square {{digestion}} trial to quantify and evaluate the relationship between intestinal protein supply and intestinal starch disappearance. Treatments were infusions of 0, 50, 100, 150, or 200 g/d of casein along with 1, 042 g/d of raw cornstarch. Abomasal infusions were accomplished by passing tubing and a pliable retaining washer through the reticular-omasal orifice into the abomasum. Steers were fed a 93 % corn silage, 7 % supplement diet that contained 12 % crude protein at 1. 65 % body weight in 12 equal portions/d. Periods lasted 17 d (12 d for adaptation, 2 d of collections, and 3 d of rest). The quantity and percentage of organic matter and protein disappearance from the small intestine increased linearly (P < 0. 03) with infused casein. Greater quantities of starch disappeared with increased casein infusion (P < 0. 01). The infusion of 200 g/d of casein increased small intestinal starch disappearance by 226 g/d over the control. Casein infusion {{did not affect the}} quantity or percent of organic <b>matter,</b> <b>starch,</b> or protein disappearance in the large intestine.

40|$|A {{model of}} kiwifruit berry {{development}} is presented, {{building on the}} model of Fishman and Gnard used for peach fruit. That model has been extended to incorporate a number of important features of kiwifruit growth. First, the kiwifruit berry is attached to the stem through a pedicel/receptacle complex which contributes significantly to the hydraulic resistance between the stem and the fruit, and this resistance changes considerably during the season. Second, much of the carbohydrate in kiwifruit berries is stored as starch until the fruit matures late in the season, when the starch hydrolyses to soluble sugars. This starch storage has a major effect on the osmotic potential of the fruit, so an existing model of kiwifruit starch dynamics was included in the model. Using previously published approaches, we also included elasticity and extended the modelling period to cover both the cell division and cell expansion phases of growth. The resulting model showed close simulation of field observations of fresh weight, dry <b>matter,</b> <b>starch,</b> and soluble solids in kiwifruit. Comparison with continuous measurements of fruit diameter confirmed that elasticity was needed to adequately simulate observed diurnal variation in fruit size. Sensitivity analyses suggested that the model is particularly sensitive to variation in inputs relating to water (stem water potential and the humidity of the air), and to parameters controlling cell expansion (cell wall extensibility). Some limitations in the model structure were identified, suggesting that a revised model including current apoplastic/symplastic concepts needs to be developed...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} {{breeding}} objectives to select sweetpotato materials with acceptable quality attributes for adaptation and subsequent utilisation in Ghana, the total amylase activity and physicochemical attributes (flesh colour, Beta-carotene, dry <b>matter,</b> <b>starch</b> and sugars) of 13 sweetpotato genotypes across five locations were evaluated. Near Infrared Reflectance Spectrometry (NIRS), was mainly employed in the study. The flesh colour of the materials ranged from white to deep orange while thedry matter content ranged from 20 % to 44 %. Starch, fructose, glucose and sucrose contents were 46 – 74, 0. 3 - 5, 2 – 8 and 9 – 22 % respectively. Apomuden, a deep orange type, recorded the highesttotal sugar content of 36 % and the lowest dry <b>matter</b> and <b>starch</b> content of 20 % and 46 % respectively. Hi-starch variety had the highest dry <b>matter</b> (45 %), <b>starch</b> (74 %) and the lowest sugar (11 %). Dry matter content correlated positively with starch content whilst orange colour intensity was inversely proportional to dry matter content. The outcome of the study supports the fact that sweet potato contains high extractable amylases. Amylase activity of the materials was fairly stable across locations. Okomkum, Faara, Santom Pona, Kemb, and Cemsa 74 - 228 recorded the highest activity while Hi-starch, Apomuden, Mohc, and 199062. 1 were low. There was no correlation between raw sugars and amylase activity.
