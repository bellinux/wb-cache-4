In {{the second half of}} 2009 job creation effectively came to a standstill, with employment remaining virtually unchanged (excluding independent workers). Despite the severity of the GDP decline, employment adjustment remained small, reflecting significant labour hoarding. Firms’ preference to reduce hours worked rather than employment levels relates to extensive use of short-time work schemes (e.g. in manufacturing) and <b>structural</b> <b>shortages</b> of skilled labour (e.g. in the banking sector).

This excess financial elasticity view contrasts sharply with two more popular ones, which stress the failure of the system to prevent disruptive current account imbalances and its tendency to generate a <b>structural</b> <b>shortage</b> of safe assets – the “excess saving ” and “excess demand for safe assets” views, respectively. In particular, the excess financial elasticity view highlights financial rather than current account imbalances and a persistent expansionary rather than contractionary bias in the system.

Historically, colonial and Brahminical doctrine portrayed indigenous subalterns as inferior and sub-human; subsequently, the modernist epistemology driven dominant development approach labeled them as objects or sites of reform and control. The mainstream development communication approaches employed unilateral tailored interventions in diffusing development, and transferring technology in the underserved spaces to `modernize 2 ̆ 7 the subalterns. Increasingly structural, cultural, and contextual issues have received importance in the contemporary theories of communication for development and social change. This study embraced the theoretical and methodological framework of the Culture-Centered Approach wherein the development processes, and subaltern negotiations are theorized at the interstices of culture, structure and agency of subaltern sectors. Attending to the co-constructive epistemic foundation of the Culture-Centered Approach, I engaged in nine months long ethnographic field research in indigenous villages of jungle, Himalayan, and coastal regions of eastern India; over which I conducted 75 in-depth interviews, and wrote field notes and reflexive journal entries. My study documents articulations and agentic enactments of indigenous subalterns in negotiating with material and communicative in-accesses. Studying the dialogic and participatory engagement of indigenous villagers, this research situates the subalterns as key stakeholders in identifying, and prioritizing situated development needs, {{as well as in}} planning, organizing, and implementing local development initiatives (i. e., building a mini-hospital, and constructing a wall to protect sacred trees and stones) to address <b>structural</b> <b>shortages.</b> This research foregrounds alternate development rationalities as emerged from the subaltern articulations, (a) in challenging the dominant discourses and conceptualizations of development, and (b) in legitimizing subaltern consciousness and praxis in bringing about social transformations. ...|$|R

This article aims at evaluating possible pathways implementing synergies between climate policies and development policies {{in order to create}} an incentive towards DCs to take part in climate mitigation. We focus on an illustrative example on India. When most reference scenarios postulate rapid energy decoupling of the GDP and rapid decarbonisation of DCs economies in the future, this article elaborates, with the IMACLIM-R model, a baseline taking into account weaknesses and current disequilibria of the Indian technico-economic system such as the high dependency on imported energy, or the <b>structural</b> <b>shortage</b> in electricity.

40|$|South Africa is {{currently}} experiencing an electricity crisis. A <b>structural</b> <b>shortage</b> of electricity supply {{remains one of}} the country s most critical challenges going forward as legacy infrastructure ages and needs to be replaced. In this context an understanding of the economic impact of load shedding is a critical consideration for all businesses in South Africa. This is particularly true for the retail sector as the impact of load shedding on consumers is dynamic and complex. The current research examines the impact of unstable electricity supply on South African retailers. A mixed-methods approach has been employed across three studies. Study 1 consists of a qualitative view of the impact of load shedding through semi-structured interviews with financial and operational retail managers. Study 2 and 3 contribute toward quantifying the cost of load shedding on the retail sector by implementing the subjective evaluation and marginal cost of backup methodologies respectively. The results of study 1 are captured in a model which highlights the major paint points experienced by the retail industry due to load shedding. The results of study 2 indicate that R 13. 72 billion rand was lost in revenue {{for the first six months}} of 2015. The results of study 3 indicate that a conservative estimate of R 716 million has been invested by retailers in backup generation power during the same period. The impact of load shedding has been significant and far reaching. It is hoped that these results will be of value for industry stakeholders in dealing with the crisis and will provide powerful motivation to ensure the correct measures are taken to keep lights on.

30|$|Secondly, the {{new middle}} class and {{business}} owners are the main force behind development-oriented consumption. Whether in big, medium, or small cities, they have driven the upgrades of consumer goods in either metropolitan areas or medium/small cities. However, owing to the rapid growth in development-oriented consumption, the qualities of consumer products and services provided by the domestic market can no longer satisfy these three classes; as a result, a <b>structural</b> <b>shortage</b> has emerged, which has further boosted the growth in sales from luxurious cars to very individualised cameras, foreign high-end products, smartphones, handbags, and cosmetic products—foreign brands have taken up {{a large portion of}} China’s consumer market. A major problem faced by most Chinese enterprises is the mismatch between the huge consumption drive (brought about by the rise in the Chinese middle class) along with the ever-expanding consumption desire (among business owners) as well as a shortage in development-directed consumer goods in the domestic market. From a 2015 report on smartphone consumption, it seems that in spite of the obvious economic downturn, Apple’s latest release—the iPhone 6 s and 6 s Plus—were sold out immediately in the presale period. Since consumption is mainly driven by symbolic value, advertising, and the hegemony of market discourse rather than the instrumental value of products, consumption is further promoted by intensified competition among merchants. In addition, consumption in the field of education, health, fitness, entertainment, tourist markets, etc., which are categorized as development-oriented consumption, remain to be further developed. In terms of the development of consumption, access to goods and quality of service in developed areas both remain poor. It is important to understand how to improve production and work efficiency for the whole society, to shorten people’s work hours and increase the “leisure supply” during holidays and weekends in order to develop policies that aim to improve consumption. It is clear that there is a mismatch between demand and supply rather than a simple shortage of supply given that overseas shopping has changed, from buying luxury products to instead purchasing daily necessities and medicine. This causes a spillover effect. In fact, the trend of shopping abroad cannot be turned back until such problem is solved.|$|E

Water competition between the economic system and ecosystem is very acute, and <b>structural</b> water <b>shortage</b> has become an important constraint against sustainable {{economic and social development}} of these countries (or regions). Under the centralized planning economic system of the Soviet Union, upstream countries of the Aral Sea basin (Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan) and downstream countries (Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan) complement each other. Upstream countries offer water resources to downstream countries for farmland irrigation, while downstream countries supply energy resources (petroleum, natural gas, and coal resources) to upstream countries. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, conflicts of energy structure, agriculture mode, and economic structure between upstream and downstream countries became increasingly prominent. With population growth and the economic rehabilitation of five Central Asian countries, the imbalance of water supply and demand as well as water competition among different countries was further intensified. Similar with most arid regions in the world, Northwest China has problems of an unsustainable water consumption structure and low water-use efficiency and benefit. The economic structure of the “Oasis economy and irrigation agriculture” leads to a high proportion of agricultural water use in Northwest China, valued at 95, 91, 78, and 90 % in Xinjiang, Ningxia, Gansu, and the whole Northwest China, respectively (Deng et al. 2011). Moreover, the conflict between water and natural resources utilization and ecological protection in Northwest China sharpened due to the lagging water conservancy construction, which brought severe challenges to water resources management (Li and Kang 2011).|$|R
30|$|Statistical {{discrimination}} (Aigner and Cain [1977]) and signalling theory (Spence [1973]) draw on {{the assumption}} that hiring is an uncertain investment since the worker’s productivity is unknown to the employer. Therefore the employer has to rely on observable characteristics, so-called signals (Spence [1973]), which serve as a proxy for worker’s unknown productivity. These signals then determine to a great deal job offers and the job quality attached to these (see Spence [1973]). In line with this theoretical argument, employers may not attribute early unemployment to <b>structural</b> problems and <b>shortages</b> in the demand for newcomers, but rather take prior unemployment as a “signal” about these worker’s lower capabilities, productivity or motivation. Following Aigner and Cain ([1977]) employer’s assumptions about differential reliability of credentials to proxy true productivity across different groups of workers in combination with risk-aversion may be thought to result in statistical discrimination. Thus, irrespective of their individual ability and productivity, young adults who experience unemployment at an early stage of career formation can be assumed to have worse employment prospects since they are less attractive to hire. Particularly in the absence of reliable information on ability as well as if costs to overcome imperfect ability assessments are high, firms may be assumed to take diverse individual characteristics as proxies for ability. On the other hand, where standardised and reliable credentials of individual skills are available, incentives to use and gather additional information may be weak (see Müller and Wolter [2014]).|$|R

40|$|Tourism resort {{represents}} {{an urban area}} mainly dedicated to tourism while including {{at the same time}} a permanent residential population. From the point of view of urban water networks, this characteristic induces a strong seasonal fluctuation of residential population and involves special water uses such as golf irrigation, production of artificial snow or functioning of thermal baths. Therefore, water supply planning can be tricky and difficult to predict. These difficulties are reinforced by the fact that temporary concentrations of water demand coincide generally with periods of water stress. In the case of seaside resorts, frequenting peaks arise in general during summer when water resource is less available. The problem is similar in mountainous tourist resorts where water is generally unavailable as it is stored as snow during months of highest frequenting. Furthermore, these difficulties are often reinforced by resorts’ geographical localisations, which are often situated in sensitive areas in terms of temporary or <b>structural</b> water <b>shortages.</b> These problematic issues often lead to strong rivalries between tourists’ water uses on the one hand, and between locals and tourists uses on the other hand. Thus, features of tourism tend to reinforce rivalries between different sectors of activity (supply of drinking water, tourism, hydroelectricity, artificial snow, irrigation, etc.). These different and competing water uses need the implementation of rules structured through public policies and property rights and through national, regional and local legal components; We propose to call this framework as an Institutional Resource Regime (IRR) (Knoepfel et al. 2001, 2007, 2009). Through this PhD thesis, we answer different research questions. We firstly aim to understand how those different IRR are implemented within tourism spaces? How do actors materialize them and what are their effects in term of technical, environmental, social and economical sustainability of urban water networks? We then, investigate effects of tourism on water networks infrastructures’ management at the scale of the tourist resort and its river basin. We focus our attention on two tourist resorts situated within two different institutional contexts (Crans-Montana, Switzerland and Morzine-Avoriaz, France) and study three types of institutional regime in particular: public, delegated and private management of infrastructures. Results of this PhD thesis indicate firstly how tourism modifies in a significant way the perception and management modalities of water resource and infrastructures. Results also show that functional space of infrastructures management rarely matches with the limits of the natural river basin and indicates what it means in terms of sustainability. Finally, the comparison of different institutional regimes reveals the strengths and weakness of each management model in the specific case of tourist resorts and shows the different solutions in locally implementing an institutional arrangement for a more or less sustainable management of network infrastructures and natural water system...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{analyses of}} climate change impacts in the Congo Basin on water for agriculture and hydropower, forest ecosystem functioning and carbon storage and impacts of climate variability and change on future economic development. To quantify the impacts of future climate we developed a modelling framework which links climate models with different impact models. Bias corrected climate model output was used to force the macro-hydrological model VIC and therefore {{it is necessary to}} use numerical models. For this project a modelling framework was developed which made it possible to link climate models with hydrological, agricultural and ecosystem models. In general, our analyses shows that more water will be available for hydropower in the future. So on average, climate change will {{have a positive impact on}} potential electricity production. However the river discharge will also become more variable which will increase the flood risks and could make the power production less reliable. The increased flow variability however will make dam management more complicated because the balance between flood prevention and optimal power production will be more difficult to manage. Climate change will have a range of different impacts of forest ecosystems. The higher atmospheric CO 2 concentrations will probably increase forest growth and carbon capture. Higher temperatures however will have negative impacts on forest growth and reduce the amount of carbon in the forests. The impact analyses show that as a result {{of climate change}}, the Congo basin is unlikely to see a decline in forest growth such as is sometimes predicted for the Amazon basin. Instead there could be a moderate increase in ecosystem carbon. Depending on how the climate will change there could be a shift in land cover of the different ecosystems. Based on the analyses a moderate expansion to the North and South of Evergreen forests into savannas and grasslands is the most likely future scenario. In general, climatic conditions are currently not limiting agricultural production in the Congo basin region. Only on the (drier) edges of the region water limitation is sometimes reducing the potential agricultural productions. In the tropical climates too much rainfall and high humidity limits agricultural production through nutrient leaching and fungal growth. The impact of future climate on agricultural production will therefore be limited in the region. In most of the area the water stress will increase slightly in the future. However the agriculture will not suffer from <b>structural</b> water <b>shortages.</b> Only the agriculture in the savanna regions surrounding the Congo basin could potentially face water shortages in the future. In the southern savanna region analyses indicate that more frequent droughts will affect agriculture production and water stress. In several of the COMIFAC countries there is a clear correlation between annual rainfall and GDP growth. GDP and Agricultural GDP growth rates tend to be higher in years with above-average rainfall than in the dry years. The impact of climate variability on GDP growth is most pronounced during dry years. During below-average rainfall years growth is sometimes severely reduced and generally the dryer the lower the GDP growth rate. All above-average rainfall years tend to have relatively similar economic growth rates. The correlation between rainfall and GDP growth rates is stronger in countries with lower and more variable rainfall. In most countries, agricultural GDP growth rates are affected stronger by climate variability than the total GDP growth rates. In terms of future climate change impacts on economic development our analysis shows that COMIFAC countries are especially vulnerable to a reduction in rainfall and a significant increase in interannual rainfall variability. Our results show that at a continental scale, climate change is likely to have a negative impact on development in Africa. However the economies of central African countries are likely to be less affected by climate change compared to countries in West, East and Southern Africa. Also at macro scale the climate scenarios seem to be more favourable in the central African part compared to the rest of Africa. However some climate change scenarios show large increases in climate variability and this could have a negative impact on development. In conclusion the climate change impacts on the different sectors shows that the main impacts will come from a more variable climate. No major impacts are expected in terms of water availability for agriculture and future carbon storage in the tropical forests. Also the average potential energy production from hydropower will not reduce. The most severe impacts will result from a more variable hydrological regime. This will result is higher flood frequency and will complicate future dam management. Keywords: Climate change; water resources; agriculture; forestry; carbon stocks; GD...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: TENSIONS IN THE LABOUR MARKET * (1) In {{the period}} 1960 - 1965 there has {{existed in the}} Dutch labour market a general {{shortage}} of personnel in the sector of skilled and unskilled labour. This personnel shortage is, however, not only {{a result of the}} great demand for workers, but also of a shrinking supply of people for specific types of work and skill. It refers to changes which take place {{in the structure of the}} working population. It is this structural problem which lends itself to sociological analysis, because not only the wage but a varied collection of ambitions influence the composition of the working population, ambitions which at present can be realised in many job vacancies. Considered historically a real choice of job, even for the workers, has recently become possible. Using extensive empirical material, this study examins which sub-markets have become specific bottlenecks in the supply of personnel and how this development ca,n be explained in a sociological and socialpsychological way. (2) The concept labour market and the study of labour mobility was formerly dealt with by the economist. First of all in the classic wage and labour market theory which presupposes that the man seeking work was a rational calculating individual, only guided in his decisions by financial motives. The theory comprises more suppositions which, in former times probably - and certainly at present -, do not conform to reality. A full understanding of labour market behaviour cannot be obtained in this way. The subject of the labour market was further developed by the American 'labour economists'. This group of economists tried to verify the classic theory as well as to collect labour turnover data and facts about labour supply, showing the connection between the level of wages and nonfinancial attractions. This second approach comes nearer to a sociological starting point. The objection is, however, that most labour economists do not go further than a loose collection of facts, without incorporating them in a theoretica 1 frame-work. It is in this last proposition that there is a task for the sociologist, which must begin with the changed structure of jobs, the opportunities for training and the ambition of workers for a higher social status. (3) Both in size and in composition the present employment situation in the Netherlands shows marked differences compared with the period before 1940. Unemployment no longer exists, the opportunities for work in industry are fast expanding and, compared with the number of workers, there is a marked and fast growth of staff employees. Of interest for the recruitment of personnel in industry is the fact that, because of the rapidly increasing desire for secundary education, the unskilled workers category begins to disappear from the labour market. The methods of production that have been developed in industry, however, still presuppose a large number of workers without training in any skill, available for the simple sub-divided work of industrial mass-production. However not only for industry but also, for example, for the mines, transport and the building industry, this structural changing threatens the continuity of personnel recruitment: In the manner in which the working population is divided over the groups of jobs, there are at present four remarkable tendencies to be seen, namely: a) the classic non-competing groups which could be distinguished by social position, that is to say, by type of work,' wage and social prestige, begin to disappear; b) the local isolation of the workers in the countryside is broken down so that they are no longer forced to accept employment locally; c) the recruitment in specific sections of the economy, for example employment on inland waterways (the Rhine), has long been based upon the traditional continuity of occupation (from father to son), which is now broken; d) given the much reduced economic constraint which the labour force experiences in the present situation, the acceptance of a job is now - much more than previously - based on the attitude-complex that the workers wish to find expression for (both in and outside of their work) and not so much on the necessity to accept any sort of work-. in order to earn a weekly wage. This attitude-complex is not free from the changing and converging work situations in a technical-organizational and an institutional sense. It is this dynamic which stimulates definite role expectations connected with the makeup of the job. The continuity of personnel recruitment - particularly in the shrinking labour market for unskilled workers - wil 1 specially be threatened by that sort of work which does not satisfy those role expectations. (4) In order to test the lines of development sketched above, the labour market of Rotterdam was chosen as an empirical subject. In former times this town had available, as a port to which tens of thousands of immigrants came, an overflow of unskilled workers. At present, however, the working population is undergoing a fast change: the number of young people who after compulsory school age do not follow further training is around 7 % for each year. In the years studied a gre 2 t shortage of personnel - an average of about 13, 000 men per year between 1960 and 1965 - appeared in the field of unskilled work at Rotterdam, specially in the metal and transport industries. This shortage would have become much bigger, had it not been for the tens of thousands of commutors who daily made the journey to Rotterdam. These commuting workers are for a great part working in heavy and dirty. or one way or another unattractive work, for which recruitment among the urban population has not yielded satisfactory results. As such the commuting groups are not only a quantitative but also a - in negative sense - qualitative addition to the labour supply of the local working population. Both in market position and in appraisal standards of work, the commuting workers differ from the Rotterdam workers. (5) In order to get a better understanding of the appraisal standards concerned with work and wage, which are a part of the previously mentioned attitude complex, a number of facts are assembled which deal with work situations in Rotterdam and with their evaluation by the workers. From this it appears that extreme inconvenience, or a accumulation of inconveniences, are not very evident in the present organization of work. This factual situation which for a great part in many firms has been realised, entourages expectations in those who give their labour which are against the kind of tasks involving heavy, dirty, or monotonous and isolated work. Thus a structural reduction of the labour supply is present in the unskilled sector caused by the rising educational level, whereas in the socio-psychological sphere there exists a sharpened sensitivity to inconveniences because these are not experienced by the majority of workers. There is here, therefore, mention of a reference-process which is part of existing sociological theory. A limited study of the standards of payment proved that the workers wanted the qrade of skill 'to be expressed in their income. But inconveniences also arid exceptional work times entitled them to extra payment. The research material, however, did not lead to the conclusion that a sufficient increase of the labour supply for unattractive types of work should result from wage regulations by themselves. The bottlenecks in personnel recruitment would not be significantly widened by such measures. In conclusion from the empirical facts four inhibiting factors could be formulated which threaten the continuity of recruitment. (6) In the last part of this study an attempt is made to show some limitations of the old theories about labour markets. These former considerations took too little account of the quality of the working population and the social positions of the workers. The changed composition of the working population and the increased influence of attitudes about labour market behaviour cause the firms to be dependent on the supply of particular categories of workers for unskilled or otherwise unattractive work: a) the commuters, b) urban workers who are insufficiently integrated in the culture current among working men, c). foreign workers. In a society with ample work opportunities and increasing prosperity therefore, a 'pseudo-proletarian' labour market develops. In contrast to the fixed frame-works of economic constraint and traditional occupational continuity, which formerly regulated the labour supply, there exists at present an attitude-complex which stimulates the labour market behaviour of urban workers and from which the types of work may not &viate too far lest <b>structural</b> labour <b>shortages</b> develop in the firms. These changes in the labour market wil 1 force the firms internally to a number of technical, organizational and institutional adaptations. -The results of this study are finally illustrated with a number of examples from dockwork, inland waterways and the electro-technica] industry. The whole study was rounded off with a - more or les - hypothetical job-model which promotes the integration of the demand- and supplyside of the modern labour market. ...|$|R
