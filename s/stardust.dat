5|$|In early 2015, the two again began {{showing signs}} of tension between them - with <b>Stardust</b> {{becoming}} further entrenched in his gimmick, leaving Goldust to {{have to try to}} communicate with his brother, Cody; through his new entity. <b>Stardust</b> would respond to this by walking out on Goldust before their match had concluded on the February 5 episode of SmackDown. On the February 16th edition of Raw - {{for the first time since}} their debut, Dusty Rhodes returned to speak to his sons as a way to commiserate and smooth out the problems they were having. Though at first Cody seemed to be in agreement with his family, after Goldust took the loss for his team against The New Day, <b>Stardust</b> hit his old finisher Cross-Rhodes thus dissolving their partnership entirely. After, when Dusty approached <b>Stardust</b> backstage, <b>Stardust</b> claimed that it was he and his brother that were responsible for the pressure Cody was subjected to from a young age. He then stated that Cody, and now his own family, were dead to him. A match between the two was set for Fastlane with Goldust promising to vanquish <b>Stardust</b> once and for all and to reclaim his brother and rekindle their partnership and brotherhood. Due to their father asking Goldust not to cause any real harm to Cody, Goldust won their first encounter via roll-up. Backstage, <b>Stardust</b> viciously assaulted Goldust and again proclaimed it was his family's fault for his mental decline.|$|E

5|$|While rare on Earth, {{silicon carbide}} is remarkably common in space. It {{is a common}} form of <b>stardust</b> found around carbon-rich stars, and {{examples}} of this <b>stardust</b> {{have been found in}} pristine condition in primitive (unaltered) meteorites. The silicon carbide found in space and in meteorites is almost exclusively the beta-polymorph. Analysis of SiC grains found in the Murchison meteorite, a carbonaceous chondrite meteorite, has revealed anomalous isotopic ratios of carbon and silicon, indicating an origin from outside the solar system; 99% of these SiC grains originate around carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars. SiC is commonly found around these stars as deduced from their infrared spectra.|$|E

40|$|Supernovae (SN) and {{supernova}} remnants (SNRs) play a {{major role}} in the life-cycle of interstel-lar dusts. Fast shock waves generated by SN explosions sweep out the interstellar space destroying dust grains and modifying their physical and chemical properties. The dense, cooling SN ejecta, on the other hand, provide an environment for dusts to condense. Recent space-infrared telescopes have revealed the hidden universe related to these fascinating microscopic processes. In this paper, I introduce the results on <b>stardusts</b> in young core-collapse supernova remnants obtained by AKARI. The AKARI results show diverse infrared characteristics of <b>stardusts</b> associated with SNRs, im-plying diverse physical/chemical stellar structures and circumstellar environments at the time of explosion...|$|R
