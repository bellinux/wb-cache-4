50|$|High {{copy number}} plasmids, also called relaxed plasmids, require {{a system to}} ensure that {{replication}} is inhibited once the number of plasmids in the cell reaches a certain threshold. Low copy number <b>plasmids,</b> also called <b>stringent</b> <b>plasmids,</b> require tighter control of replication.Relaxed plasmids are generally regulated through one of two mechanisms: antisense RNA or iteron binding groups.|$|R
5000|$|Iteron plasmids, {{including}} F and RK2-related plasmids, have oriV regions containing multiple (~3-7) repeats of 17-22 bp iteron sequences.pSC101 {{represents a}} simple model of an iteron plasmid. Iteron plasmids control copy number through two combined methods, suitable for low copy number <b>stringent</b> <b>plasmids.</b> One method is control of RepA synthesis. RepA {{is the only}} plasmid-encoded protein required for replication in pSC101. RepA protein represses its own synthesis by binding to its own promoter region and blocking transcription of itself (transcriptional autoregulation). Thus, the more RepA is made, the more its synthesis is repressed, and subsequently limiting plasmid replication. The coupling hypothesis proposes that the second method is coupling of plasmids through the Rep protein and iteron sequences. When the plasmid concentration is high, RepA plasmids bound to iterons form dimers in between two plasmids, [...] "handcuffing" [...] them at the origin of replication and inhibiting replication.|$|R
30|$|In this study, we {{developed}} a food-grade expression system for d-psicose 3 -epimerase production in B. subtilis. The plasmid co-expressing rdpe and dal was introduced into dal mutant, selection appeared highly <b>stringent,</b> and <b>plasmids</b> were stably maintained during culturing. Moreover, the production of RDPE in this food-grade expression system was comparable to that in neo-based system. The results showed that this system was very suitable for food-grade expression of heterologous proteins.|$|R
30|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{developed}} a food-grade expression system {{for the production of}} d-psicose 3 -epimerase (RDPE) from Ruminococcus sp. 5 _ 1 _ 39 BFAA in B. subtilis, using alanine racemase gene dal as the selection marker. The selection appeared highly <b>stringent,</b> and the <b>plasmid</b> was stably maintained during culturing. Moreover, the expression level of RDPE in the newly developed food-grade system was comparable to the level obtained in the conventional kanamycin-based system. This new expression system was therefore suitable for food-grade production of various heterologous proteins.|$|R

Subsequently, the plasmid-coded selection marker dal was complemented in the food-grade host, and RDPE was thus successfully expressed in dal deletion strain without addition of d-alanine. The selection appeared highly <b>stringent,</b> and the <b>plasmid</b> was stably maintained during culturing. The highest RDPE activity in medium reached 46  U/ml at 72  h which was comparable to RDPE production in kanamycin-based system.

40|$|A {{strain of}} Streptococcus faecalis with plasmid-mediated {{penicillinase}} production was studied further. Partially purified penicillinase from the S. faecalis strain hydrolyzed penicillin, ampicillin, and ureido-penicillins but not penicillinase-resistant semisynthetic penicillins, cephalosporins, or imipenem; hydrolysis was inhibited by clavulanic acid. Hydrolysis {{of a given}} antibiotic correlated with a marked increase in the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of that drug when a high inoculum was used. As with most enterococci, the MICs of cephalosporins and penicillinase-resistant semisynthetic penicillins were too high for clinical usefulness, although these agents did not show an inoculum effect. Based upon hybridization under <b>stringent</b> conditions of <b>plasmid</b> DNA from the S. faecalis strain to cloned penicillinase genes from Staphylococcus aureus, it appears that these resistance determinants are highly homologous and suggests that this enzyme was introduced into streptococci from staphylococci...|$|R
40|$|Both Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus plantarum {{contain a}} single alr gene, {{encoding}} an alanine racemase (EC 5. 1. 1. 1), which catalyzes the interconversion of D-alanine and L-alanine. The alr genes of these {{lactic acid bacteria}} were investigated for their application as food-grade selection markers in a heterologous complementation approach. Since isogenic mutants of both species carrying an alr deletion (alr) showed auxotrophy for D-alanine, plasmids carrying a heterologous alr were constructed and could be selected, since they complemented D-alanine auxotrophy in the L. plantarum alr and L. lactis alr strains. Selection {{was found to be}} highly <b>stringent,</b> and <b>plasmids</b> were stably maintained over 200 generations of culturing. Moreover, the plasmids carrying the heterologous alr genes could be stably maintained in wild-type strains of L. plantarum and L. lactis by selection for resistance to D-cycloserine, a competitive inhibitor of Alr (600 and 200 ?g/ml, respectively). In addition, a plasmid carrying the L. plantarum alr gene under control of the regulated nisA promoter was constructed to demonstrate that D-cycloserine resistance of L. lactis is linearly correlated to the alr expression level. Finally, the L. lactis alr gene controlled by the nisA promoter, together with the nisin-regulatory genes nisRK, were integrated into the chromosome of L. plantarum alr. The resulting strain could grow in the absence of D-alanine only when expression of the alr gene was induced with nisin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Food-grade {{expression}} systems {{require that}} the resultant strains should only contain materials from food-safe microorganisms, and no antibiotic resistance marker can be utilized. To develop a food-grade expression system for d -psicose 3 -epimerase production, we use an alanine racemase-encoding gene as selection marker in Bacillus subtilis. Results In this study, the d -alanine racemase-encoding gene dal was deleted from the chromosome of B. subtilis 1 A 751 using Cre/ lox system to generate the food-grade host. Subsequently, the plasmid-coded selection marker dal was complemented in the food-grade host, and RDPE was thus successfully expressed in dal deletion strain without addition of d -alanine. The selection appeared highly <b>stringent,</b> and the <b>plasmid</b> was stably maintained during culturing. The highest RDPE activity in medium reached 460 U/ml at 720 h which was comparable to RDPE production in kanamycin-based system. Finally, {{the capacity of the}} food-grade B. subtilis 1 A 751 D 2 R was evaluated in a 7. 50 l fermentor with a fed-batch fermentation. Conclusion The alanine racemase-encoding gene {{can be used as a}} selection marker, and the food-grade expression system was suitable for heterologous proteins production in B. subtilis...|$|R
40|$|The R-factor R 1 {{is present}} in a low number of copies per genome (near unity, {{so-called}} stringent control of replication). The replication of R 1 was studied in a density-shift experiment. One generation after the shift about 20 % of the R 1 copies had not replicated, whereas about 20 % had replicated at least twice. The results are in quantitative accordance with a random replication of R 1 in which the replicating molecules are taken from a cytoplasmic plasmid pool and transferred back to the pool after replication. This {{is analogous to the}} results obtained by Bazaral and Helinski (1970) and Rownd (1969) for plasmids that are present in 10 to 20 copies per genome (so-called relaxed control of replication). Hence, there seem to be no difference between <b>stringent</b> and relaxed <b>plasmids</b> with respect to selection of plasmid molecules for replication. However, we cannot tell whether all R 1 copies in a cell replicate during a fraction of or throughout the cell cycle. The random selction of plasmid copies for replication has to be considered when models for control of replication are constructed...|$|R
40|$|The {{arrangement}} {{and location of}} homologous DNA sequences within the genomes of equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV- 1) and EHV- 3 were investigated by using Southern blot hybridization analyses conducted under <b>stringent</b> conditions. Recombinant <b>plasmid</b> libraries comprising 95 and 84 % of the EHV- 1 and EHV- 3 genomes, respectively, were labeled with 32 P-deoxynucleotides by nick translation and were used as probes in filter hybridization studies. The DNA homology between the EHV- 1 and EHV- 3 genomes was dispersed throughout the genomes in a colinear arrangement. Significant hybridization was detected between the EHV- 1 short region inverted repeat sequences, which are known to encode immediate early transcripts, and the corresponding EHV- 3 inverted repeat sequences. Interestingly, probes derived from the EHV- 1 heterogeneous region, which is adjacent to the EHV- 1 short region, hybridized strongly to EHV- 3 DNA sequences within a similar genomic location, but did not reveal any corresponding heterogeneity within the EHV- 3 genome. Our results demonstrated {{that there is a}} highly conserved evolutionary relationship between EHV- 1 and EHV- 3 and provided the foundation for further investigations to determine whether similarities in protein function underpin the genetic relatedness between these two herpesviruses...|$|R
