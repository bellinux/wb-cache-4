40|$|We examine Nica-Pimsner algebras {{associated}} with semigroup actions of Z_+^n on a C*-algebra A by *-endomorphisms. We give necessary and sufficient {{conditions on the}} dynamics for exactness and nuclearity of the Nica-Pimsner algebras. Furthermore we parameterize the KMS states at finite temperature by the tracial <b>states</b> <b>on</b> A. A parametrization is also shown for KMS states at zero temperature (resp. ground states) by the tracial <b>states</b> <b>on</b> A (resp. <b>states</b> <b>on</b> A).

5|$|A non-tropical area of low pressure, first noted {{over the}} Gulf Stream on August7, entered the southeastern Gulf of Mexico and {{organized}} into a tropical depression about 120mi (190km) west of Fort Myers, Florida, by 18:00UTC on August10. As {{the newly formed}} cyclone moved west-northwest, a nearby upper-level low imparted high wind shear and dry air entrainment, and the depression degenerated into a remnant low twelve hours later without attaining tropical storm intensity. Upon degeneration, the low moved into the Gulf Coast of the United States and conducted a clockwise loop. It emerged into the Gulf of Mexico again on August16, where the disturbance nearly regenerated into a tropical cyclone before making a second landfall in Mississippi the next day. The remnants dissipated over the southeastern portion of the <b>state</b> <b>on</b> August18.|$|E

5|$|After much delay (two of its ten members {{died and}} several fell ill), the {{commission}} reported its findings in March 1912.

Over the next two months, Sihanouk introduced constitutional amendments to create the new post of Head of State of Cambodia, which provided ceremonial powers equivalent to that of the king. A referendum held on 5June 1960 approved Sihanouk's proposals, and Sihanouk was formally appointed Head of <b>State</b> <b>on</b> 14June 1960.
