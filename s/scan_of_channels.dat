40|$|Abstract – Channel {{scanning}} is {{an important}} aspect of seamless handovers since it is required in order to find a target point of attachment (PoA). In the IEEE 802. 11 WLAN, <b>scanning</b> <b>of</b> other <b>channels</b> causes service disruptions with the current AP so that the provided quality of service (QoS) will be degraded seriously during the handoff. In this paper, we propose a QoS supported dynamic channel scanning algorithm. The scanning period is scheduled to guarantee the user’s QoS requirements while the scan progresses. The simulation results show that the proposed mechanism reduces service disruptions and provides the desired quality of service to users during the scanning period. * I...|$|R
40|$|Visual {{inspection}} <b>of</b> fuel <b>channels</b> is {{an important}} element of the understanding of the health of the current fleet of AGR reactors. When a fuel channel is inspected, video footage of the entire inside surface is recorded through a series <b>of</b> vertical <b>scans</b> <b>of</b> the <b>channel.</b> When areas <b>of</b> interest such as cracks are identified, screenshots of these areas are taken and manually stitched together to produce a montage of the region of interest. This is a lengthy process, which requires an experienced person to undertake. The resultant montages are assessed and then included in the TV GAP sheet, a document that forms part of the case for return to service. This paper describes an automated approach which uses advanced image processing techniques to recreate a full 360 ° image of the inside surface <b>of</b> the <b>channel</b> using the same video input. These images offer a significant improvement in the quality over the manual approach, provides 100 % coverage <b>of</b> the <b>channel</b> and can be generated in a fraction of the time of the manual images.

It is probable that the spectral response and sensitivity, as discussed below, reproduce that previously demonstrated by 1 to 16 channel VUV-photodiodes; however, significantly more effort would be required to establish that experimentally. These detectors appear to be worth further evaluation where 25 w spatial resolution bolometers or spectrograph detectors of known sensitivity are required, and single-shot or 0. 02 - 0. 2 s time response is adequate.

Geostationary satellite FY- 2 B is an analogue of satellite GMS- 5, which finished the work in springtime 2001. Active using of satellite FY- 2 B images is blocked by problem of “noisy ” lines. Polar-orbital satellites FengYun- 1 C/ 1 D have ten spectral channels, five from which correspond to the NOAA/AVHRR channels and even have the same characteristics.

40|$|The low-dielectric plasma {{membrane}} provides an energy barrier hindering transmembrane movement of charged particles. The positively charged, voltage-sensing fourth transmembrane domain (S 4) <b>of</b> voltage-gated ion <b>channels</b> must surmount this energy barrier to initiate channel activation, typically necessitating both membrane depolarization and interaction with membrane lipid phospho-head groups (MLPHGs). In contrast, and despite containing S 4, the KCNQ 1 K+ channel α subunit exhibits predominantly constitutive activation when in complexes with transmembrane β subunits, MinK-related peptide (MiRP) 1 (KCNE 2) or MiRP 2 (KCNE 3). Here, using a 2 -electrode voltage clamp and <b>scanning</b> mutagenesis <b>of</b> <b>channels</b> heterologously expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, {{we discovered that}} 2 of the 8 MiRP 2 extracellular domain acidic residues (D 54 and D 55) are important for KCNQ 1 -MiRP 2 constitutive activation. Double-mutant thermodynamic cycle analysis revealed energetic coupling of D 54 and D 55 to R 237 in KCNQ 1 S 4 but not to 10 other native or introduced polar residues in KCNQ 1 S 4 and surrounding linkers. MiRP 2 -D 54 and KCNQ 1 -R 237 also similarly dictated susceptibility to the inhibitory effects of MLPHG hydrolysis, whereas other closely situated polar residues did not. Thus, by providing negative charge near the {{plasma membrane}} extracellular face, MiRP 2 uses a lipomimetic mechanism to constitutively stabilize the activated KCNQ 1 voltage sensor. —Choi, E., Abbott, G.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{sequential}} opportunistic channel sensing and access problem of an unlicensed or secondary user (SU) in presence of multiple licensed or primary users (PU). The SU senses one channel {{at a time}} {{for the presence of}} PU. The sensing is considered to be imperfect, i. e, {{the presence or absence of}} PU may not be detected correctly. The problem of selection <b>of</b> best <b>channel</b> amongst the sequentially scanned channels for the transmission of SU is modeled as an Optimal Stopping Problem (OSP) which also takes into account the cost <b>of</b> <b>scan</b> per <b>channel.</b> A simple threshold based policy is presented as a solution to OSP in which SU after sensing the channel to be free of PU activity checks the channel quality by comparing the channel gain with a threshold and if the channel gain is more than the threshold then SU selects this channel for transmission. The threshold is seen to be dependent on probabilities <b>of</b> <b>channel</b> occupancy and detection errors. The variation of threshold with respect to detection errors is analyzed and supported with plots. The plots for the variation are presented which match closely with the analytical results...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{practical}} distributed channel selection protocol for cognitive radio ad hoc networks considering single hop transmission. The proposed protocol uses the control channel in order to exchange information concerning the available data channels and also to establish communications. The channel selection is performed based on weights that are assigned to the channels. Each time a node receives over the control channel a message for which it is not the destination; it updates the weight <b>of</b> the <b>channel</b> included in the message. This methodology allows nodes to become aware of the distribution of the load over the different channels and therefore to perform channel selection {{in such a way that}} channel congestion is avoided. Moreover, the proposed protocol specifies a mechanism which uses sorting based on channel weights with the goal of reducing the sensing effort whenever this is possible. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol is up to 80 % more efficient in terms of delay when compared to an algorithm that neglects the current load <b>of</b> <b>channels</b> and which allows nodes to randomly select one <b>of</b> the available <b>channels.</b> Moreover, the results show a relevant decrease in the average number <b>of</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>channels.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{health status}} of a railway tunnel should be {{regularly}} inspected during its service period to ensure safe operation. Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) {{has been used as}} a key technique for tunnel detection; however, so far, the measurements of GPR are only obtainable in contact mode. Such methods cannot meet the requirements of the operational tunnel disease census and regular inspections. Therefore, a new method—vehicle-mounted GPR with long-range detection—has been developed. It consists <b>of</b> six <b>channels.</b> The distance from its air-launched antenna to the tunnel lining is approximately 0. 93 m– 2. 25 m. The <b>scanning</b> rate <b>of</b> each <b>channel</b> is 976 1 /s. When the sampling point interval is 5 cm, the maximum speed can reach up to 175 km/h. With its speed and air-launched antenna, this system has a significant advantage over existing methods. That is, for an electrified railway, there is no need for power outages. Indeed, the proposed system will not interrupt normal railway operation. Running tests were carried out on the Baoji–Zhongwei and Xiangfan–Chongqing railway lines, and very good results were obtained...|$|R

Under practical assumptions, we show that this problem is a monotone problem and that the optimal policy is completely characterized by the one stage look ahead or 1 - sla set.

40|$|As {{the radio}} range of access point (AP) in a {{wireless}} {{local area network}} (WLAN) is about 35 meters, mobile nodes (MNs) have to frequently undergo a handoff process when they move beyond the radio coverage area of their associated APs. However, legacy IEEE 802. 11 -based standards cannot provide sufficient support for mobility management. Besides, as the demands from wireless users for real-time multimedia services increase, quality of service provisioning becomes a challenging issue for mobile users in WLANs. Under the circumstances, this paper proposes a new handoff management scheme to support ongoing real-time applications while MNs change their network attachment points. This MAC-layer-based approach consists of minimizing the total number <b>of</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>channels</b> during handoff, and reducing the probe-waiting time for each examined channel. To analyze the efficiency of the proposal, simulations are conducted with the simulator SimulX for MNs roaming in an environment that integrates the standard mobile IPv 6 (MIPv 6) with IEEE 802. 11 b. Simulation results show that our proposed solution delivers better performance than the IEEE 802. 11 b standard, a variation of this standard in which an MN waits for MinChannelTime on each probed channel, and two other well-documented approaches in the literature: Selective scanning plus AP Caching (Selective...|$|R
