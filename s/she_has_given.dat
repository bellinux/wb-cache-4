5|$|Anna {{appears in}} the fourth season of Once Upon a Time, with actress Elizabeth Lail portraying the character. Following {{the events of the}} film Frozen, Anna is {{preparing}} to wed Kristoff when Elsa finds a diary from their mother stating their real reason for their parents' fatal trip. Determined to seek answers, Anna postpones her wedding and travels to the Enchanted Forest (known as Misthaven in Arendelle). Anna meets David, a friend of Kristoff's, and trains him in swordsmanship so he can defend his farm from the evil warlord Bo Peep. Following Bo Peep's defeat, David gives Anna his horse and David's mother gives Anna the name of Rumplestiltskin, a powerful wizard who she believes can give her the answers she is looking for. Anna visits Rumplestiltskin (Robert Carlyle) who tells her that the King and Queen of Arendelle came to him, and he will tell her what they said if she administers a potion to an old man. Anna is afraid the potion is poison and pours it into the old man's fire. She returns to Rumplestiltskin's lair and lies, saying <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>given</b> the man the potion, and quickly learns it was an antidote, not a poison. In not giving him the drink, Anna has broken her deal with Rumplestiltskin and subjected the man to turn into a mouse. The deal, when broken, meant that Anna had to be Rumplestiltskin's slave—but, alas, Anna gets control of the dagger that controls him, and orders him to never harm her or her sister, and to send her back home with Rumplestiltskin's weapon, a magic-stealing hat. Back in Arendelle, Anna admits to Kristoff that Rumplestiltskin told her that her parents were afraid of Elsa. She does not tell this to Elsa, but is shocked to see that Elsa is learning to control her power—due to a new woman by the name of Ingrid (Elizabeth Mitchell), who claims she is their mother's sister and also has magic snow powers like her sister Elsa. Anna never knew their mother had a sister, so she is immediately skeptical. She goes to meet Grand Pabbie and the rock trolls to find out if this is the truth. While purchasing supplies at Oaken's shop, Anna runs into Belle (Emilie de Ravin) and they become friends. Together, they journey to the rock trolls, where Anna learns that her mother had two sisters named Ingrid and Helga, but Grand Pabbie changed everyone's memory in all of Arendelle. On the return journey back to the castle, Anna and Belle run into Ingrid. Ingrid sees that Anna has Rumplestiltskin's magic-stealing hat and believes she will betray her, so she grabs hold of Anna and imprisons her. Ingrid tells Anna that she has nothing in common with either her or Elsa as she has no magic as they, and now Ingrid must replace her. Eventually, Anna reunites with her sister, helps Ingrid see the errors of her ways, and marries Kristoff.|$|E

25|$|The novel closes with an epilogue. Matthias has {{married the}} {{fieldmouse}} named Cornflower and <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>given</b> birth to their son, Mattimeo, an abbreviated {{version of his}} full name: Matthias Methuselah Mortimer. Also, Brother Alf is now the Abbot, and John Churchmouse, {{a resident of the}} Abbey, is now the Abbey recorder. The cracked Joseph Bell was made into two bells: the Matthias Bell, and the Methuselah Bell.|$|E
25|$|In {{the words}} of soprano Montserrat Caballé:She opened a new door for us, for all the singers in the world, a door that had been closed. Behind it was {{sleeping}} not only great music but great idea of interpretation. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>given</b> us the chance, those who follow her, {{to do things that}} were hardly possible before her. That I am compared with Callas is something I never dared to dream. It is not right. I am much smaller than Callas.|$|E
25|$|In Chapter 25, Lamb meets {{a little}} girl with her broken leg in a cast who spends the day looking {{out of the window}} at the neighbours, whom <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>given</b> fanciful {{descriptive}} names. The inspiration for this plot device is possibly Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 film, Rear Window, a nod to a classic. In the same chapter, the little girl refers to a neighbour called Miss Bulstrode, though it seems unlikely that the character is the same Miss Bulstrode from Cat Among the Pigeons.|$|E

Others in the party included Ivor Novello, Margaret Rutherford, Diana Wynyard and Bobbie Andrews. In her autobiography, A Star Danced, <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>given</b> a graphic account of their landing on a Normandy beach and of the progress of her unit through the wrecked towns, where {{there was still no}} water or electricity. Shows were given in shell-torn cinemas and hastily lighted casinos.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, Schwan {{married her}} first husband, Professor Alexander Schwan, {{with whom she}} had two {{children}} and who died in 1989. In 2004, Gesine Schwan celebrated her second wedding with longtime companion Peter Eigen in Berlin. He is a former World Bank manager as well as a founder and current Chair of the Advisory Council of Transparency International. Schwan is very engaged in German and Polish mutual understanding and therefore supports, in numerous ways, the work of the Freya von Moltke Stiftung for the New Kreisau. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>given</b> numerous presentations on this topic.|$|E
25|$|Female calves {{born on a}} {{dairy farm}} will {{typically}} be raised as replacement stock {{to take the place}} of older cows that are no longer sufficiently productive. The life of a dairy cow is a cycle of pregnancy and lactation starting at puberty. Obviously the timing of these events is very important to the production capacity of the dairy. A cow will not produce milk until <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>given</b> birth to a calf. Consequently timing of the first breeding as well as all the subsequent breeding is important for maintaining milk production levels.|$|E

Baez was {{presented}} with the first award in recognition of her human rights work with Amnesty International and beyond, and the inspiration <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>given</b> activists around the world. In future years, the award is to be presented to an artist — music, film, sculpture, paint or other medium — who has similarly helped advance human rights.|$|E
25|$|Chimpanzees {{tend to be}} used {{repeatedly}} over decades, {{rather than}} used and killed as with most laboratory animals. Some individual chimps currently in U.S. laboratories {{have been used in}} experiments for over 40 years. The oldest known chimp in a U.S. lab is Wenka, who was born in a laboratory in Florida on May 21, 1954. She was removed from her mother on the day of birth to be used in a vision experiment that lasted 17 months, then sold as a pet to a family in North Carolina. She was returned to the Yerkes National Primate Research Center in 1957 when she became too big to handle. Since then, <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>given</b> birth six times, and has been used in research into alcohol use, oral contraceptives, aging, and cognitive studies.|$|E

[...] Coyle also believes that people can connect with the character on different levels.

500|$|Rowling {{has lived}} a [...] "rags to riches" [...] life story, {{in which she}} progressed from living on state {{benefits}} to multi-millionaire status within five years.

The 2016 Sunday Times Rich List estimated Rowling's fortune at £600million, ranking her as the joint 197th richest person in the UK. Time magazine named her as a runner-up for its 2007 Person of the Year, noting the social, moral, and political inspiration <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>given</b> her fans.

Han's first solo exhibition was Four Dimensions at the National Museum Art Gallery from 18 to 28 February 1993.

Washington Post book critic Ron Charles opined in July 2007 that {{the large numbers of}} adults reading the Potter series but few other books may represent a [...] "bad case of cultural infantilism", and that the straightforward [...] "good vs. evil" [...] theme of the series is [...] "childish". He also argued [...] "through no fault of Rowling's", the cultural and marketing [...] "hysteria" [...] marked by the publication of the later books [...] "trains children and adults to expect the roar of the coliseum, a mass-media experience that no other novel can possibly provide".|$|E
