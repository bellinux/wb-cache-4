500|$|In {{the eighth}} inning, after {{recording}} the first out, Tyler Clippard walked two consecutive batters to force Terry Collins {{to bring in}} Familia. A key fielding error by Daniel Murphy allowed the tying run to score. [...] The Royals took the lead on an RBI single from Moustakas, and then Pérez added an insurance run with another RBI base hit to give Kansas City the 5–3 lead. For Familia, it was his second blown save of the series, and second out of seven opportunities this postseason, though this one could be partly attributed to Murphy's error. Wade Davis converted a two-inning save for the Royals, his fourth overall this postseason. [...] Davis pitched a perfect eighth, but got into some trouble with one out in the ninth when Murphy hit a hard grounder that Moustakas couldn't field cleanly, and then Céspedes got a base hit to bring the winning run to the plate in Duda. However, Duda hit a <b>soft</b> <b>line</b> drive that was caught by Moustakas, who then doubled off Céspedes at first base to end the game. Céspedes had started running thinking that the ball would hit the ground.|$|E

He criticised a campaign by Soviet troops to put down an uprising in his native Georgia in 1989. In protest over the growing influence of hardliners under Gorbachev, Shevardnadze suddenly resigned in December 1990, saying, [...] "Dictatorship is coming". A few months later, his fears were partially realised when an unsuccessful coup by Communist hardliners precipitated {{the collapse of the}} Soviet Union. Shevardnadze returned briefly as Soviet Foreign Minister in November 1991 but resigned with Gorbachev the following month, when the Soviet Union was formally dissolved.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} water temperature, in association with four denture cleansers, on the colour and surface roughness of five <b>soft</b> <b>lining</b> materials. Method: Two silicone <b>soft</b> <b>lining</b> materials (Molloplast B and Sofreliner) represented the heat-cured, laboratory-based and chairside materials that are available. The wide range of chairside, acrylic resin-based, temporary <b>soft</b> <b>lining</b> materials was represented by Coe-Soft, Viscogel and Eversoft. An alkaline hypochlorite (Dentural) and three effervescent peroxide solutions {{with a range of}} active pH values (Steradent Active Plus, pH 6; Steradent Extra Strength, pH 3; Superdrug Fresh, pH 11) were selected as the cleansers. The denture cleansers were used at two temperatures: 55 °C (manufacturers' recommended temperature) and 80 °C. The colour of the specimens was evaluated using a colorimeter and the surface roughness was assessed using a three-dimensional, non-contact surface profilometer. This study reported on the effect of using both the higher temperatures and the recommended temperature on the colour and roughness of permanent and temporary <b>soft</b> <b>lining</b> materials. Results and Conclusion: The results of the study showed that the temperature of the water used with denture cleansers might have a detrimental effect on the colour and surface roughness of some permanent and temporary <b>soft</b> <b>lining</b> materials...|$|R
40|$|Statement of problem. Colonization of denture <b>soft</b> <b>lining</b> {{materials}} by Candida albicans {{can result}} in clinical problems. Two experimental silicone <b>soft</b> <b>lining</b> materials have been developed and demonstrate good physical properties. Purpose of study. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the extent of candidal adherence to these materials compared with a commercially available <b>soft</b> <b>lining</b> material and an acrylic resin denture base. Material and methods. The experimental materials were constructed in a stainless-steel mold, and their surface energies were determined with a dynamic contact angle analyzer. The adherence of three strains of C. albicans was determined with an in vitro assay. In addition, one test strain was used to determine the effect on adherence of precoating the materials with whole saliva. Results. Adhesion to all materials was strain variable, with the lowest adherence recorded for the two experimental materials. Decreased adherence was also apparent after precoating the materials with saliva. Correlation between surface energy of the material and the degree of candidal adhesion was seen for one strain, but no correlation was seen for the other two strains. Conclusion. Adherence of C. albicans to the two experimental silicone <b>soft</b> <b>lining</b> materials was significantly less than that for an acrylic resin denture base and a commercially available <b>soft</b> <b>lining</b> material...|$|R
