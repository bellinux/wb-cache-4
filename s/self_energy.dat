We introduce the Born radii of the ions {{in the form of a}} charge distribution allowing for different Born radii between the cations and anions. The model thus automatically yields a theory free of divergences and accounts for the solvation of the ions at the level of continuous dielectric media. In an inhomogeneous dielectric medium, the <b>self</b> <b>energy</b> is in general position dependent and differences in the <b>self</b> <b>energy</b> between cations and anions can give rise to local charge separation in a macroscopically neutral system.
