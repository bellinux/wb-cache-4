Routine measurements over {{extended periods of}} time and geographic areas have the potential for parameterising the structure of the polar and auroral ionosphere. Averaged electron densities characteristic of different ionospheric features, locations, local times, Universal Times, seasons, geomagnetic activity and solar conditions can be compared with ionospheric models and used to test and develop the models. Tomographic images are presented of plasma structures characteristic of the polar and auroral ionosphere.
