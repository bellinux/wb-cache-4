5|$|At {{the end of}} August is {{the annual}} American celebration of Labor Day, the only holiday weekend during this period. Of all the year's holiday {{weekends}} it is reliably the weakest in terms of movie box office, with the top grosser for the weekend being the 2007 Rob Zombie-directed reimagining of Halloween, at $30.5 million. The <b>Sixth</b> <b>Sense,</b> then in its fourth week, is a close second after pulling in $29 million in 1999; in a distant second for opening weekends is yet another horror film, 2012's The Possession with $21.1 million.|$|E
5|$|Strickland's {{career began}} in 1999 {{with a brief}} {{appearance}} as a mourner at a funeral after-party in The <b>Sixth</b> <b>Sense,</b> a two-line part that she received after impressing writer-director M. Night Shyamalan when reading lines for those auditioning for the film. According to Strickland, {{her role in the}} film helped her learn to temper her fake crying. The same year, she served as an extra in the independent film The Sterling Chase, and appeared in a small role opposite Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie in James Mangold's drama Girl, Interrupted.|$|E

50|$|Most of the Gallery Hotel's {{interior}} decor {{was designed}} by Eva Shivdasani, a Swedish former fashion model, and Bernard Bohnenberger, from <b>Sixth</b> <b>Senses</b> Hotels and Resorts. While the Gallery Hotel's interior architecture embraces the exterior, it also reflects the surroundings {{through the use of}} materials. Metallic surfaces reflect the geometric roofs of former warehouses that occupied the area. Pipes and services are exposed in bright primary colours. The entrance foyer consists of an open-air space with a portable desk, like a valet parking kiosk. The smallness of the lobby and the translucency between inside and outside indicate the nature of expected guests, congruent with the concept of HIP hotels not catering to large tour groups.|$|R
5|$|The term Wicca {{appears to}} have {{developed}} within the Pagan Witchcraft community during the early 1960s, as increasing numbers of Pagan Witches learned of the Old English term wicca, the etymological origin of the Modern term witch. This etymological fact had been referred to five times in Gerald Gardner's book The Meaning of Witchcraft (1959), {{as well as in}} other early texts propagating Pagan Witchcraft, such as Doreen Valiente's Where Witchcraft Lives (1962) and Justine Glass' Witchcraft, The <b>Sixth</b> <b>Sense</b> – and Us (1965). None of these specifically referred to the Pagan Witchcraft religion as Wicca.|$|E

She made a cameo appearance as herself in the first episode of the situation comedy The Tim Conway Show, which aired on January 30, 1970. She starred {{on the big screen}} one final time, playing Dr. Brockton in Herman Cohen's science fiction horror film Trog (1970), rounding out a career spanning 45 years and more than eighty motion pictures. Crawford made three more television appearances, as Stephanie White in a 1970 episode ("The Nightmare") of The Virginian and as Joan Fairchild (her final performance) in a 1972 episode ("Dear Joan: We're Going to Scare You to Death") of The <b>Sixth</b> <b>Sense.</b>|$|E
5|$|Deep Blue Sea {{performed}} well {{when it opened}} on July 30, 1999 in 2,854 theaters, finishing third and grossing around $18.6 million at the US weekend box office. During its second weekend, the film grossed an estimated $11 million and finished in fifth place, behind The <b>Sixth</b> <b>Sense,</b> The Blair Witch Project, Runaway Bride, and The Thomas Crown Affair. Overall, Deep Blue Sea went on to make $73,648,142 in the United States and Canada, and $164,648,142 worldwide. The film's performance was compared to Stephen Sommers's The Mummy and Jan de Bont's The Haunting, which had a similar budget and made {{a significant impact on}} the box office in the summer of 1999.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} {{going to be}} made in 1975 as part of a series of four films, but shooting was abandoned after two days, only to be revisited by Rivette 27 years later. It premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2003 and had a cinema release in France, Belgium and the UK. It was shown in competition at the San Sebastian International Film Festival and was nominated for the Prix Louis-Delluc. Some critics found the film tedious, long, and pretentious, while others maintained that it was moving, intelligent, and among Rivette's best work. The film was frequently compared to other supernatural thrillers, among them Vertigo (1958), The <b>Sixth</b> <b>Sense</b> (1999), and The Others (2001).|$|E

40|$|Australia is a {{difficult}} market for horror movies. Particularly in recent years, Australia has been regarded as a graveyard for many horror films released theatrically. This {{is not to say}} that Australians have not enjoyed the occasional scary movie on the big screen. But what types of horror films have been popular with Australian audiences at the box-office remains poorly understood. Horror films revolve around monsters, the fear of death and the transgression of boundaries, and they aim to scare audiences through ‘gross-out’ or ‘creep-out’ factors (some combine both). The former refers to shocking and graphic portrayals of gore and violence – as seen in the sadistic torture of backpackers in Hostel (Eli Roth, 2005), which depicts limbs being hacked off and eyes being cut from nerve endings. The latter refers to the crafting of fear through mood and suspense without explicit bloodshed, achieved brilliantly in The <b>Sixth</b> <b>Sense’s</b> (M Night Shyamalan, 1999) chilling encounters with ‘dead people’. In creep-out films, it is often what viewers don’t see that is most disturbing. Using an analysis of the top fifty films each year at the Australian box office from 1992 to 2012, this article identifies the most successful horror movies over this period to ascertain what types of horror movies – with reference to creep-out and gross-out factors – have been most popular with domestic audiences...|$|R
60|$|Either {{would have}} been {{perfectly}} consistent with my feelings. I gazed at the door, hesitating, {{but in the end}} I did neither. The monition of some <b>sixth</b> sense--the <b>sense</b> of guilt, maybe, that sense which always acts too late, alas!--warned me to look round; and at once I became aware that the conclusion of this tumultuous episode was likely {{to be a matter of}} lively anxiety. Jacobus was standing in the doorway of the dining-room. How long he had been there it was impossible to guess; and remembering my struggle with the girl I thought he must have been its mute witness from beginning to end. But this supposition seemed almost incredible. Perhaps that impenetrable girl had heard him come in and had got away in time.|$|R

5|$|Eager {{to spread}} {{information}} about Wicca throughout Britain, she {{also began to}} interact with press, sending a 1962 letter to the Spiritualist newspaper Psychic News, and in 1964 being interviewed for her involvement with Wicca by Brighton's Evening Argus. During the 1960s, she began producing articles about Wicca and other esoteric subjects on a regular basis, for such esoteric magazines as Light, Fate, and Prediction. In this capacity, she also began to make appearances on television and radio. She also involved herself in the newly formed Witchcraft Research Association (WRA), becoming its second President after the resignation of Sybil Leek. Valiente's letter of welcome {{was included in the}} first issue of the WRA's newsletter, Pentagram, published in August 1964, while she also gave a speech at the WRA's Halloween dinner in October. It was at the speech that Valiente proclaimed the Wiccan Rede; this was its first public appearance in a recognisable form, with Doyle White arguing that it was Valiente herself who both created and named the Rede. It was through the WRA that Valiente came to communicate with the journalist Justine Glass, who was then conducting research for her book Witchcraft, the <b>Sixth</b> <b>Sense,</b> and Us.|$|E

40|$|Organisms {{continuously}} {{detect and}} process {{physical and chemical}} signals from their external and internal world, and they monitor their interaction with the environment. Aristotle was the first who defined the five external senses in humans: sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. In addition, we consider balance as the <b>sixth</b> external <b>sense.</b> Similarly important for the control of movement {{is the sense of}} body position, the proprioception. The physiological state of the organism is reported by a variety of internal receptors including those for gases, temperature, or pH. According to the activating stimulus sensory receptors can be classified into electromagnetic receptors (photoreceptor, thermoreceptor), mechanoreceptors (hearing, touch, balance, osmoreceptor), and chemoreceptors (odorant receptor, gustatory receptor). Sensory signals are perceived by specialized neurons equipped with one type of receptor molecules as photoreceptor cells or with various types of receptor...|$|R

The campaign investigated interactions between mesoscale sea-breeze, lake-breeze, and complex topographic flow regimes, and thus constituted an interesting coastal complex-terrain test for the TVM vorticity-mode formulation. The vorticity-mode model reproduced qualitative and quantitative features of the temporal and spatial variations of observed mesoscale sea, lake, and topographic flows. For example, the model reproduced the main features of observed sea, land, lake, katabatic, and upslope flows...|$|R
40|$|RESEARCH BACKGROUND Triply-Periodic minimal {{surfaces}} are mathematical objects that form a continuous partitioning of three-dimensional {{space with a}} surface of zero gaussian curvature (cylinder). Through the soap-film models {{and the work of}} such architects as Frei Otto, minimal surfaces have a history as architectural structures. This project is one of a series that explores the architectural properties of the Triply-Periodic family of minimal surfaces. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTIONEvolute is part of a series of projects by Paul Minifie that explores the architectural potential of Triply-Periodic minimal surfaces. Rather than considering structure or scale as other projects in this series have done, Evolute examines issues of programme, inhabitation and navigation. By proposing a crawler-lift, and using the mobile phone as a <b>sixth</b> navigational <b>sense,</b> Evolute shows how a continually curving surface can support innovative new kinds of urban inhabitation and social interaction. RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCEThe project was exhibited at the 3 rd Ljubljana Architecture Biennale, Slovenia, 2005. It has received several awards including: Second place, 3 rd International Architecture Biennale, &# 039;City of Skyscrapers&# 039; International Competition, 2005; Honourable Mention.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the social, psychological and emotional correlates of suicidal ideation in African American male adolescents. The author examined the following factors: First, the psychological correlates to suicidal ideation that were identified in the literature which included prior mental health treatment and family issues. Second, the social correlates to suicidal ideation that were identified in the literature which included deviance and the influence of the media on suicidal ideation. The data was collected from case records of adolescent clients that reported suicidal ideation to the emergency room of a major metropolitan hospital. Fifty case records were reviewed, the data was tabulated and analyzed by use of a computer. Three hypothesis were tested concerning suicidal ideation in relation to social factors, psychological factors and emotional factors. The findings demonstrated seven common correlates of suicidal ideation in Black male adolescents. First, depression. Second, a poor self-image. Third, a belief that life isn 2 ̆ 7 t worth living. Fourth, antisocial behavior. Fifth, verbal threats to commit suicide. <b>Sixth,</b> a <b>sense</b> of alienation and isolation from group life. Seventh, continual anger or rage. The results of this study indicated that social workers must be aware of the seven common correlates of suicidal ideation in Black male adolescents in order to properly intervene in preventing a potential suicide from occurring...|$|R
60|$|Remark, meanwhile, how from {{amid the}} wrecks and dust of this {{universal}} Decay new Powers are fashioning themselves, {{adapted to the}} new time and its destinies. Besides the old Noblesse, originally of Fighters, {{there is a new}} recognised Noblesse of Lawyers; whose gala-day and proud battle-day even now is. An unrecognised Noblesse of Commerce; powerful enough, with money in its pocket. Lastly, powerfulest of all, least recognised of all, a Noblesse of Literature; without steel on their thigh, without gold in their purse, but with the 'grand thaumaturgic faculty of Thought' in their head. French Philosophism has arisen; in which little word how much do we include! Here, indeed, lies properly the cardinal symptom of the whole wide-spread malady. Faith is gone out; Scepticism is come in. Evil abounds and accumulates: no man has Faith to withstand it, to amend it, to begin by amending himself; it must even go on accumulating. While hollow langour and vacuity is the lot of the Upper, and want and stagnation of the Lower, and universal misery is very certain, what other thing is certain? That a Lie cannot be believed! Philosophism knows only this: her other belief is mainly that, in spiritual supersensual matters no Belief is possible. Unhappy! Nay, as yet the Contradiction of a Lie is some kind of Belief; but the Lie with its Contradiction once swept away, what will remain? The five unsatiated Senses will remain, the <b>sixth</b> insatiable <b>Sense</b> (of vanity); the whole daemonic nature of man will remain,--hurled forth to rage blindly without rule or rein; savage itself, yet with all the tools and weapons of civilisation; a spectacle new in History.|$|R

These mantras salute Soma, Gandharva, Agni, Indra, Vayu, the Aswini Devas, Savita, Brihaspati, Viswa Devas and Varuna for blessing the marriage and beseeches them to confer long wedded life, health, wealth, children and freedom from all kinds of worries.
