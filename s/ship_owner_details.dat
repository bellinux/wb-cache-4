As most <b>ship</b> <b>owners</b> nowa-days employ broker for their insurance-related activities, well-structured, organized and time-ly communication in emergencies between <b>ship</b> <b>owners</b> and their insurance broker is analysed in this study.

Three different groups of <b>ship</b> <b>owners,</b> ranging from small to corpo-rate ship owning companies are focused on. The results of all three sample groups are put in contrast and unveil that actual communication pattern and ship owners’ perceived optimal communication are to great extent in line with each other, but are not ideal. The conclusion of this study shows various space for improvement of how communication between the <b>ship</b> <b>owner</b> and the insurance broker could be enhanced for a better flow of information.
