Lapinskas deemed his character [...] "pleased that somebody likes him", and said {{that while he was}} also interested in Jodie Gold (Kylie Babbington), he was put [...] "on the spot" [...] by Poppy and so did what he thought was expected of him in asking her out. He and Jodie later kissed; Lapinskas revealed that Jodie would be angry with herself for betraying Poppy and decide to leave London. An Inside Soap writer predicted that Anthony had landed himself in a big mess, and that he was [...] "playing with fire" [...] by kissing both Poppy and Jodie.

500|$|In 19 September 2011 episode, Poppy {{discovers that}} Jodie's fiance Darren (Hawkins) has cheated on her. Hawkins {{assessed}} the situation Poppy was in: [...] "as everyone knows, Poppy's loyalties lie with Jodie– they're super best friends! Poppy wants Darren to own up straight away, because {{she feels that}} if he doesn't, she'll be lying to Jodie as well". He explained, [...] "Poppy doesn't want to see Jodie in pain, but she can't keep the secret". Poppy and Jodie were reportedly used to add humour to the soap, {{in the style of}} reality-drama series The Only Way Is Essex, but The Sun assessed that the attempt had [...] "flopped". On 24 October 2011 it was announced that the pair were to leave the show. Her departure storyline saw her to start to date Anthony (Lapinskas), who considered his character to be [...] "pleased that somebody likes him". He added that while his character was also interested in Jodie, he did what he thought was expected of him in asking Poppy out. After he and Jodie kissed, Lapinskas revealed that Jodie would be angry with herself for betraying Poppy. An Inside Soap writer predicted that Anthony was heading for trouble, and that he was [...] "playing with fire" [...] by kissing both Poppy and Jodie. A source told RTÉ, [...] " [...] and Poppy have never let a man come between them. Poppy may have <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> Jodie when she finds out they have kissed". The Digital Spy Daniel Kilkelly and the Daily Star Susan Hill confirmed that Poppy would forgive Jodie, and they made their final appearance on 14 November 2011. According to an EastEnders spokesperson, there was potential for Poppy to return in the future; in an interview with Inside Soap, EastEnders executive producer Bryan Kirkwood said: [...] "We may see Poppy pop up as I'm a big fan of Rachel Bright and the character, but Kylie is keen to pursue other roles".|$|E
2500|$|... (2007) Experts {{studied the}} {{protective}} properties of full face masks. The measurements {{showed that the}} workers were adequately protected. The duration of the measurements was 1–3 hours. In these circumstances, of the 52 measurements, in 2 cases, the workers had removed the mask (because they had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> each other) - and these results were not {{taken into account in}} the analysis. However, use of respirators intermittently drastically reduces their efficiency. This shows how important to correctly organize the use of respirators, and to provide workers with the intercom stations (if necessary).|$|E
