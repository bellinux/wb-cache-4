She considered {{the writing of}} songs for Ketika Cinta Bertasbih {{to be more difficult}} than her previous work in teen romances, as it was a religious film. As such, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had to be extra careful.|$|E

She placed second behind teammate Ivana Hong. Liukin thought about competing uneven bars and beam at the U.S. Championships, but decided to once again just perform on beam. She placed fourth and looked on track to possibly make a fourth World Championships team. Liukin was added to the national team and included in the World Championships selection camp. However, she pulled out of Worlds selection consideration because <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was not quite up to World Championships standards.|$|E
5|$|Kawada's musical style mainly fuses {{rock with}} trance. When Kawada debuted in 2001, she {{originally}} {{felt that the}} music she earned in her career was pocket money. She also felt happy {{that she could be}} based in Sapporo where she could be close to her family and friends, as well as to I've Sound who she felt was like a second family to her. After Kotoko made her major debut in 2004, I've Sound management began discussing the possibility of Kawada making a major debut. At first, she was hesitant because <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would be thrust into the spotlight, but eventually she accepted the idea. For the first ten years of her career, she always felt that she was a beginner, but this began to change when younger singers made their debuts and began to treat her as an older sister.|$|E

5|$|About January 1944, Moyzisch hired a new {{secretary}} named Cornelia Kapp, {{also known}} as Nele Kapp, who had spied for the British and Americans in exchange for permission to immigrate to the United States. She had worked at the Germany embassy in Sofia, Bulgaria beginning in July 1943 and within a month had become a spy. In January 1944, she moved to Ankara {{to work at the}} German embassy under Moyzisch. Kapp was asked by the OSS to learn about the spy that Moyzisch met with. Kapp was adept at gathering intelligence within the office. She flirted with Cicero when he called the office to schedule a meeting with Moyzisch. When she could, Kapp also followed the two men to try to see what the spy looked like, but was unsuccessful at getting a good view of him. Kapp had gathered and shared a lot of information with the OSS over the months that she worked at the embassy, including all that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could learn about Cicero.|$|E

At this time she developed a crush on her older brother, who became embarrassed by her attentions — soon pushing her away. She suffered {{the first of several}} bouts of depression — an issue that would plague her {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E

25|$|The Wei Shu (魏書) {{mentioned}} that Cao Pi issued an edict to Lady Zhen, {{asking her to}} move to the newly constructed Changqiu Palace (長秋宮) in Luoyang. Lady Zhen declined humbly, stating that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was not capable enough to manage the imperial harem, and also because she was ill. Cao Pi then consecutively sent another two edicts but Lady Zhen rejected both. It was around summer at the time. Cao Pi intended to fetch Lady Zhen from Ye to Luoyang in autumn, when the weather was cooler. However, Lady Zhen died of illness in Ye a few months later. Cao Pi mourned her death and posthumously elevated her to the status of an empress.|$|E
500|$|... "Si No Te Hubiera Conocido" [...] is a Latin ballad {{featuring}} Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi. Aguilera wanted Fonsi {{to perform}} a duet with her because <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could relate to him as they [...] "grew up listening to the same things". The ballad {{tells the story of}} two happy lovers that cannot envision their lives if they had not met each other.|$|E
500|$|Milian {{began writing}} songs {{at the age}} of {{seventeen}} because she needed a demo to help her obtain a recording contract. According to Milian, every time she recorded a song, the producer would refuse to give her the demo, or would write lyrics that she did not agree with. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had to write a song, record a demo, and send it out on her own.|$|E

500|$|Duffy {{said that}} <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> should [...] "honour that great {{tradition}} of poets {{who were also}} soldiers", describing the poem as [...] "an attempt at healing and being at one with the world", and [...] "a tribute and blessing, even an apology, on behalf of poetry and all poets." [...] She added that she [...] "had been thinking about Afghanistan and trying to enthuse new war poetry among contemporary poets." [...] The poem was broadcast one week after Duffy published a selection of poems she had commissioned from poets such as Sean O'Brien, Paul Muldoon and Daljit Nagra about the ongoing war in Afghanistan.|$|E

500|$|Aside {{from her}} work with Clue and Jay-Z, Carey's {{longtime}} friend and background singer Trey Lorenz also {{took part in the}} song's production. He provided the back-up vocals in the song, and took part in several small areas of the development of Rainbow. When interviewed by Bronson, Carey spoke highly of Lorenz, [...] "He's an amazing writer and singer, he's so influenced by the old school stuff, yet he's so current. He's known me since before my first album, and he's a great, loyal friend." [...] Aside from the use of the sample and Jay-Z's verses, [...] "Heartbreaker" [...] contains strong female-empowering lyrics, which Carey wrote as a sort of anthem, especially because <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> personally has been in a similar predicament in the past.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>felt</b> somehow <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had wounded {{him very}} deeply, and was half angry with herself for her seeming ingratitude, and yet childishly {{glad to have}} {{suppressed}} in him that attitude of mentorship, which {{he was beginning to}} assume over her.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> if <b>she</b> {{let him go}} {{they might}} not meet again. After all, this might be wiser.

500|$|... "Telephone" [...] was {{originally}} written by Gaga for singer Britney Spears's sixth studio album, Circus, but Spears rejected it. Later, Gaga recorded the song as a collaboration with Beyoncé for The Fame Monster. Gaga said, [...] "I wrote {{it for her}} [...] {{a long time ago}} and she just didn't use it for her album. It's fine because I love the song and I get to perform it now." [...] Spears' demo for the song leaked in May 2010. Additionally, the guest vocalist {{was originally}} going to be Spears, but ultimately Gaga made Beyoncé the featured vocalist instead. The main inspiration behind the song was Gaga's fear of suffocation as <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> seldom found time to just let loose and have fun.|$|E

Close to [...] "a third of the way into the process" [...] <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was incapable of doing so because [...] "the humor just kept sneaking in". She stated, [...] "I have a macabre sense of humor. A lot of the things in the movie that are horrifying are funny to me." [...] Feeling that [...] "comedy films and horror films are kind of similar" [...] due to being films where you can significantly gauge intense reactions from the audience, Cody stated, [...] "They're laughing, they're screaming, it's not a passive experience. So, I actually think comedy and horror are kind of similar in that way." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{accordance}} with Lee Strasberg's method acting, Jolie preferred {{to stay in}} character in between scenes during many of her early films, {{and as a result}} had gained a reputation for being difficult to deal with. While shooting Gia, she told her husband, Jonny Lee Miller, that she {{would not be able to}} phone him: [...] "I'd tell him: 'I'm alone; I'm dying; I'm gay; I'm not going to see you for weeks.'" [...] After Gia wrapped, she briefly gave up acting, because <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had [...] "nothing else to give." [...] She separated from Miller and moved to New York, where she took night classes at New York University to study directing and screenwriting. Encouraged by her Golden Globe Award win for George Wallace and the positive critical reception of Gia, Jolie resumed her career.|$|E

60|$|She spoke kindly, but {{avoided the}} least tone of tenderness: for <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> if <b>she</b> gave way, {{she might be}} only too tender; and to re-awaken hope in his heart would be only cruelty.

For the role, Stone kept her natural blonde hair color, rather than maintaining her usual dyed red hair. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had a responsibility to educate herself on Spider-Man, admitting she [...] "hadn't read the comic book growing up, and my experience was with the Sam Raimi movies... I always assumed that Mary [...] Jane was his first love", and having only been familiar with her The Help co-star Bryce Dallas Howard's portrayal in Spider-Man 3. Stone said, [...] "There's {{a part of me}} that really wants to please people [...] love Spider-Man or Gwen Stacy and want her to be done justice. I hope they'll give me license to interpret her my way." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite being {{signed to}} Crai, {{this was more}} as {{promoter}} than as a record label itself. It was only when Roberts suggested that Catatonia record some extended plays (EPs) after two months with the label that Mwyn made the arrangements. The first, entitled For Tinkerbell, had a cover photo taken by Roberts and Matthews' housemate Roland Dafis. Mwyn successfully got the record on BBC Radio 1 after sending a copy to radio presenter Mark Radcliffe. After Iestyn George heard the release, the journalist named it as {{the record of the}} week for the magazine NME. For Tinkerbell contained some early tracks, including a version of [...] "Sweet Catatonia". Matthews later explained that while she had liked the songs on the EP, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> wasn't good at performing live at the time. They signed to Nursery Records to release the single [...] "Bleed". Catatonia's first national interview was published following the release of [...] "For Tinkerbell", a 300 word piece appearing in Melody Maker.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Diga Online, Suzuki described the production of her album Lead and single [...] "Blow Out". She described how difficult life was {{as a high school}} student while she was focusing on her music career. Following her graduation from high school and entering university, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had made many sacrifices for her career. The title of the album came from the idea that she had become a new person after her concert during her 20th birthday, as she wanted to [...] "lead everyone" [...] through her songs. The song [...] "My Shining Ray" [...] was written to represent a big star that would that would lead people; she also described her experience singing the song as feeling like she was spreading wings. While singing the song [...] "Redo" [...] for Re:Zero, she considered it fun to sing as it [...] "was completely different from herself". She describes [...] "Blow Out" [...] as a song about blowing away negative feelings.|$|E
