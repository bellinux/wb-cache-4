40|$|Purpose – <b>Sustainable</b> <b>property</b> {{development}} {{has increased in}} market share {{over the past two}} to three years globally and locally. This research aims to analyze the drivers and barriers to <b>sustainable</b> <b>property</b> development in Melbourne using the triple bottom line (TBL) theoretical framework. The TBL posits that sustainability has social, economic and environmental aspects to fulfil. Design/methodology/approach – A questionnaire was sent out to 190 developers in Melbourne who promoted <b>sustainable</b> <b>property</b> development to ascertain their views about the drivers and barriers. Findings – This research indicates that in the 2007 Melbourne market the drivers were social rather than economic. The data reveal that social reasons are considered more than economic arguments for incorporating sustainability into developments. The business case, or the economic drivers for sustainability alone do not convince developers. Research limitations/implications – The questionnaire survey informed us about developers 2 ̆ 7 views but not why they have these views. The sample was limited to Melbourne. Practical implications – More developments are required for developers to become convinced of the benefits. The relatively low price of energy undermines the business case for sustainability in property here and needs to be fully costed. Originality/value – This paper illustrates that whilst the theoretical framework cites three key areas for sustainability, the reality is that developers are currently driven by social and environmental factors primarily and the business case is not accepted by the majority of developers. <br /...|$|E

Conventional {{real estate}} {{development}} practices and the operation of existing buildings create significant negative externalities. New practices collectively known as ???green building??? or ???sustainable development??? offer mitigation for these externalities. However, the proliferation of green buildings has been hindered by, among other things, {{a lack of understanding}} of how property-level sustainability affects building valuation and investment and analysis. Sources of Data???I used the LEED New Construction rating system as framework for evaluating property-level sustainability???s interaction with building value. Various studies and market data provided the basis for assumptions about the value of various sustainable attributes. Personal communications with investment analysts provided insight into the trends, attitudes, and analytical framework employed by large investment funds with respect to sustainable properties. Conclusions Reached???Conventional financial analysis techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis can be modified to account for sustainable building features. Each property is unique and has a unique interaction between sustainability and value. Using the exercises presented in this thesis can help guide the process of underwriting <b>sustainable</b> <b>property</b> investment.

40|$|Introduction Numerous {{international}} studies {{have identified the}} fact that the take up of green building principles and practices by the commercial property sector are being hampered by a lack of documented project-specific evidence that clearly demonstrates the benefits that green buildings can deliver. Above all, the commercial property sector wants to be convinced by a compelling business case. A number of ground breaking studies into {{the costs and benefits of}} green buildings have been documented in the United States of America (California & Seattle), Canada and the United Kingdom. However, no comparable research has been undertaken in Australia and placed in the public domain for debate – until now. The Green Building Council of Australia (GBCA) is committed to driving the shift to a <b>sustainable</b> <b>property</b> industry in Australia. While the GBCA has already succeeded in creating momentum to build green in Australia, this Report aims to further drive the shift to a <b>sustainable</b> <b>property</b> industry in Australia. Building on international case studies and examples of the business case for green commercial buildings, this Report seeks to detail the financial and social benefits of green commercial buildings to the owner, manager, developer, investor and financier, tenant, and the community in an Australian context by incorporating Australian research and case studies of green developments. It also examines a number of challenges and barriers to green commercial buildings in Australia. Finally, this Report identifies a range of actions that could provide a way forward for industry and government to drive the transition to green commercial office buildings in Australia. They could also be used as a basis for the development of a national roadmap for future sustainable building in Australia.  ...|$|E

Blurb: People often reminisce on childhood memories of model making when they think about balsa wood, however history has seen balsa used predominately in marine and aviation industries. In the 21 st century balsa is found in applications that optimise the <b>sustainable</b> <b>properties</b> and lightweight nature of the material. Such applications include wind turbine blade manufacturing for wind energy generation and as a core catalyst in sandwich composites for the automotive industry. Balsa is a natural timber that grows very fast in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) balsa exports have declined resulting in a mass over-supply and under-demand for balsa causing hardship for balsa growers. Making matters worse {{is the fact that}} balsa consumers prior to the GFC are now consuming synthetic foams as a substitute material regardless of the environmental concerns synthetic materials poses. There is a need for designers to generate new concepts that promote the use of balsa in new applications to generate international demand for the material.

The case demonstrates how a proposed ecological improvement project is contested in discursive struggles over the space and time of environmental problems.

The radical imposition of a futuristic island town by the beach triggered an effective, localized popular movement unified through people’s desire to restore their sensual experiences of local environment. This desire linked people’s diverse demands for conservation behind a discursive frontier against anyone supporting North Port Quay.

40|$|The {{proportion}} of <b>sustainable</b> <b>property</b> {{in the total}} building stock remains small. One {{reason is that the}} financial added value resulting from sustainability is not sufficiently taken into account in property valuation due to the tendency of valuations to lag behind market trends. Quantitative information is provided to integrate those aspects of sustainability relating to value into valuations and thereby contribute to the reduction of valuation lag. The Centre for Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability (CCRS) Economic Sustainability Indicator (ESI) measures the risk of property to lose value and the opportunity to gain value due to future developments (e. g. climate change or rising energy prices). Five groups of value-related sustainability features were identified: flexibility and polyvalence; energy and water dependency; accessibility and mobility; security; and health and comfort. By minimizing the risk of loss in value through future developments, those sustainability features contribute to the property value. Their effects on property value were quantified by risk modelling. As an indicator for future-oriented property risk, the ESI is integrated into the discount rate of discounted cash flow valuations. The approach was tested for plausibility and practicability on more than 200 properties...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} some of {{the principles}} in conceptual design of commercial buildings that enhance the adaptability of a structure to different uses. These principles allow a building to be designed with increased longevity improving the potential environmental sustainability of the structure. The purpose {{of this research is}} to attempt to fill part of the gap in current methods of sustainable building design. The most prominent aspect addressed in the design of a sustainable building is energy efficiency. However, all buildings house embodied energy, the energy and resources used in construction, and all buildings demolished significantly add to waste that ends up in landfill. If a building is adaptable it can be easily adjusted to different uses. Therefore, construction that not only embraces energy-efficiency but also longevity and flexibility, through adaptable design, has much greater <b>sustainable</b> <b>properties</b> in that {{it has the potential to}} reduce long-term resource use and waste. It is impossible to predict exactly how buildings will be used in the future and what needs future societies will have. Therefore, the main factor determining adaptability is flexibility. This paper will begin with an overview of how adaptability has the potential to improve the sustainability of commercial buildings. Structural features of adaptable design will be examined; for example durability of main structural elements, inbuilt redundancy, large freecolumn space and floor to ceiling heights, flexible facades, and flexible location of services. Finally, current incorporation of adaptable design and the main challenges for the future are described.
