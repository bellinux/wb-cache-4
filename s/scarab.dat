5|$|Several {{species of}} dung beetle, {{especially}} the sacred <b>scarab,</b> Scarabaeus sacer, were revered in Ancient Egypt. The hieroglyphic {{image of the}} beetle may have had existential, fictional, or ontologic significance. Images of the <b>scarab</b> in bone, ivory, stone, Egyptian faience, and precious metals are known from the Sixth Dynasty {{and up to the}} period of Roman rule. The <b>scarab</b> was of prime significance in the funerary cult of ancient Egypt. The <b>scarab</b> was linked to Khepri, the god of the rising sun, from the supposed resemblance of the rolling of the dung ball by the beetle to the rolling of the sun by the god. Some of ancient Egypt's neighbors adopted the <b>scarab</b> motif for seals of varying types. The best-known of these are the Judean LMLK seals, where eight of 21 designs contained <b>scarab</b> beetles, which were used exclusively to stamp impressions on storage jars during the reign of Hezekiah. Beetles are mentioned {{as a symbol of the}} sun, as in ancient Egypt, in Plutarch's 1st century Moralia. The Greek Magical Papyri of the 2nd century BC to the 5th century AD describe scarabs as an ingredient in a spell.|$|E

5|$|A female may lay {{from several}} dozen to several {{thousand}} eggs during her lifetime, {{depending on the}} extent of parental care. This ranges from the simple laying of eggs under a leaf, to the parental care provided by <b>scarab</b> beetles, which house, feed and protect their young. The Attelabidae roll leaves and lay their eggs inside the roll for protection.|$|E

5000|$|By {{the end of}} the First Intermediate Period (about 2055 BCE) <b>scarabs</b> {{had become}} {{extremely}} common. [...] They largely replaced cylinder seals and circular [...] "button seals" [...] with simple geometric designs. Throughout the period in which they were made, <b>Scarabs</b> were often engraved with the names of pharaohs and other royal persons. In the Middle Kingdom <b>scarabs</b> were also engraved with the names and titles of officials and used as official seals. From the New Kingdom <b>scarabs</b> bearing the names and titles of officials became rarer, while <b>scarabs</b> bearing the names of gods, often combined with short prayers or mottos, like [...] "With Ra behind there is nothing to fear" [...] became more popular. These [...] "wish" [...] <b>scarabs</b> are often difficult to translate.|$|R

5|$|Insects have {{appeared}} in mythology around the world from ancient times. Among the insect groups featuring in myths are the bee, butterfly, cicada, dragonfly, praying mantis and <b>scarab</b> beetle. <b>Scarab</b> beetles held religious and cultural symbolism in Old Egypt, Greece and some shamanistic Old World cultures. The ancient Chinese regarded cicadas as symbols of rebirth or immortality. In Mesopotamian literature, the epic poem of Gilgamesh has allusions to dragonflies, signifying the impossibility of immortality. Amongst the Arrernte Aborigines of Australia, honey ants and witchety grubs served as personal clan totems. In {{the case of the}} San bushmen of the Kalahari, it is the praying mantis which holds much cultural significance including creation and zen-like patience in waiting.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the Middle Kingdom, new object types were {{introduced}} into burials, such as the first shabtis and the first heart <b>scarabs.</b> Shabtis were little clay statues made to perform tasks on command for the pharaoh. Now objects of daily use appear in tombs again, often magical items already employed for protecting the living. <b>Scarabs</b> (beetles) collect animal dung and roll it into little balls. To the Egyptians, these balls looked like the life-giving Sun, so they hoped that <b>scarabs</b> would bring them long life. <b>Scarabs</b> have been found in tombs and graves.|$|R
5000|$|Most of the <b>scarabs</b> {{are made}} of {{steatite}} painted blue or green. Their length varies between 4.7 and 11 cm, their width between 7 and 8.9 cm.

5|$|Whether Neferhotep I usurped {{the throne}} {{at the expense}} of Sobekhotep III or {{inherited}} it, he possibly acceded to power over a fragmented Egypt. The Egyptologist Kim Ryholt believes that the Canaanite 14th Dynasty was already in existence at the time, forming an independent realm controlling at least the Eastern Nile Delta. This could explain why Neferhotep's only attestation in Lower Egypt is a single <b>scarab</b> seal. While this analysis is accepted by some scholars, among whom are Gae Callender, Janine Bourriau and Darrell Baker, it is rejected by others, including Manfred Bietak, Daphna Ben-Tor and James and Susan Allen, who contend that Neferhotep I reigned over the whole of Egypt. Possible vindications of this are the several attestations of Neferhotep found northeast of Egypt, in the Levant, in particular the stela of the Governor of Byblos Yantinu and 4 <b>scarab</b> seals from Canaan, indicating that he retained enough power to maintain trade relations with this region.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} {{swallows}}, both martins feed on flying insects, hunting in single-species groups or with other swallows and swifts. They feed low over {{a variety of}} open habitats or woodland. Prey items recorded for the Mascarene martin include <b>scarab,</b> click and other beetles, Hemiptera and flying ants, and Brazza's martins will take termites. In eastern Africa, areas deforested by logging or conversion to agriculture are used for hunting by Brazza's martins.|$|E
50|$|<b>Scarabs</b> were {{generally}} either carved from stone or moulded from Egyptian faience. Once carved, they would typically be glazed {{blue or green}} and then fired. The most common stone used for <b>scarabs</b> {{was a form of}} steatite, a soft stone which becomes hard when fired (forming enstatite). Hardstone <b>scarabs</b> were also made and the stones most commonly used were green jasper, amethyst and carnelian.|$|R

5|$|Different species use {{different}} pheromones. <b>Scarab</b> beetles {{such as the}} Rutelinae use pheromones derived from fatty acid synthesis, while other scarabs such as the Melolonthinae use amino acids and terpenoids. Another way beetles find mates {{is seen in the}} fireflies (Lampyridae) which are bioluminescent, with abdominal light-producing organs. The males and females engage in a complex dialogue before mating; each species has a unique combination of flight patterns, duration, composition, and intensity of the light produced.|$|E
5|$|Egyptologists {{have noted}} that instead of hiding their non-royal origins, Neferhotep I, his {{predecessor}} Sobekhotep III, and his successor Sobekhotep IV, remarkably proclaimed them on their stelae and <b>scarab</b> seals. This {{is at odds with}} the traditional Egyptian system where the legitimacy of the new king rests mainly on his filiation. These proclamations of non-royal origins were possibly made to dissociate these kings from their immediate predecessors, in particular Seth Meribre whose monuments have been usurped and defaced. The reason for this remains unknown.|$|E
5|$|Decaying {{organic matter}} {{is a primary}} diet for many species. This can range from dung, which is {{consumed}} by coprophagous species (such as certain <b>scarab</b> beetles in the Scarabaeidae), to dead animals, which are eaten by necrophagous species (such as the carrion beetles, Silphidae). Some beetles found in dung and carrion are in fact predatory. These include members of the Histeridae and Silphidae, preying on the larvae of coprophagous and necrophagous insects. Many beetles feed under bark, some feed on wood while others feed on fungi growing on wood or leaf-litter. Some beetles have special mycangia, structures for the transport of fungal spores.|$|E

50|$|Amenhotep III (immediate {{predecessor}} of Akhnaten) {{is famous}} for having commemorative <b>scarabs</b> made. These were large (mostly between 3.5 cm and 10 cm long) and made of steatite. They are beautifully crafted <b>scarabs,</b> apparently created under royal supervision or control and carry lengthy inscriptions describing one of five important events in his reign (and all of which mention his queen, Tiye). More than 200 examples have survived {{and they have been}} found in locations that suggest they were sent out as royal gifts/propaganda in support of Egyptian diplomatic activities. These large <b>scarabs</b> continued and developed an earlier Eighteenth Dynasty tradition of making <b>scarabs</b> celebrating specific royal achievements, such as the erection of obelisks at major temples during the reign of Thuthmosis III. The tradition was revived centuries later during the Twenty-fifth Dynasty, when the Kushite pharaoh Shabaka (721-707 BCE) had large <b>scarabs</b> made commemorating his victories in imitation of those produced for Amenhotep III.|$|R

When the Pharaoh discovers the affair, Imhotep and Anck-su-Namun assassinate him. Imhotep flees, while Anck-su-Namun kills herself, intending for Imhotep to resurrect her. Imhotep and his priests steal her corpse and travel to Hamunaptra, the city of the dead, but the resurrection ritual is stopped by Seti's bodyguards, the Medjai. Imhotep's priests are all mummified alive, while Imhotep himself is sentenced to suffer the Hom Dai, the worst of Egyptian curses, buried alive with flesh-eating <b>scarab</b> beetles.
