30|$|For {{high-frequency}} results (Fig.  8), ρ _yx was downward-biased by noise {{over a large}} {{frequency bandwidth}} and ρ _xy was also biased around 0.08  Hz. Because {{of the position of}} the station near housing, it was difficult to assess where the noise source was (it could have been from electric fences or pipelines). In this case, the result given by robust processing in the <b>single</b> <b>site</b> <b>configuration</b> would lead to a wrong interpretation of the MT response. Wavelet processing allows one to drastically reduce the noise bias and recover the impedance tensor obtained by using remote processing even near the 50  Hz frequency.|$|E
40|$|We propose here a new, robust, {{methodology}} {{to estimate}} the errors on a magnetotel-luric (MT) impedance tensor. This method is developed with the bounded influence remote-reference processing (BIRRP) code in a <b>single</b> <b>site</b> <b>configuration.</b> The error is estimated by reinjecting an electric field residual obtained after the calculation of an impedance tensor into a tensor function calculation procedure. We show using synthetic examples that the error tensor calculated with our method yields a more reliable error estimate than the one calculated from Jackknife statistics. The modulus of realistic error estimates {{can be used as}} a quality control and an accurate inversion constraint of MT surveys. Moreover, reliable error estimates are necessary for new applications of MT to dynamic subsurface processes such as reservoir monitoring...|$|E

A detailed study on the validation of the numerical simulations is presented. Several issues about the numerical modelling of the contact line are {{addressed in order to}} define a global strategy to perform accurate and predictive simulations. Benchmarks from pioneering studies (Son et al., 1999) have been reproduced with more recent numerical methods and thinner grids in order to define the most relevant strategy for successful simulations. In particular, the grid sensitivityof the solution is thoroughly investigated by performing simulations with four successive grids. The numerical results are compared favorably with experimental data, since the discrepancy between the numerical solutions and the experimental data is always less than 10 % whether the departure diameter or the departure frequency are considered. The influence on the numerical solution of the thermal con duction in the solid heater is also assessed and we report that this parameter has no influence in the con figurations of thick and highly conductive materials that have been considered in this study. We also present clarifications about the requirement of a specific modelling in the contact line region in order to account for a possible impact of the micro-region. Finally, {{based on the results of}} this analysis of our numerical simulations, we formulate the following unusual conclusion: the implementation of a micro-region model and an additional coupling between the overall solver and such a model is not required to perform well-resolved and accurate numerical simulations in the case of high density ratio,high microscopic contact angle (up to 30 °) and moderate Jakob number. Next, we present some compar isons on the bubble shape evolution between the numerical simulations and a static force balance model, in order to investigate the mechanisms leading to the bubble detachment. Finally, we conclude this paper by presenting a parametric study, by varying the Jakob number, in order to propose a new correlation on the bubble detachment radius depending on the latter dimensionless number...|$|R

We use spreadsheet models to conduct a comparative cost and savings analysis between the current split workload scenario and a <b>single</b> <b>site</b> scenario at each depot.
