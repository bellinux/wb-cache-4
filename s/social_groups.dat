5|$|According to Znaniecki, {{sociology}} can {{be divided}} into the study of four dynamic social systems: social action theory, social relation theory, social actors theory, and <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> theory. Znaniecki saw social actions as the foundation of a society, as they give rise to more complex social relations, and he saw this theory as the foundation of all the others. Unlike Max Weber, he did not believe that everything can be reduced to social actions; he was also quite skeptical of any insights coming from the science of psychology, which he held in low esteem.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{a series}} of {{experiments}} Dunbar (1993; 1995; 1998) has demonstrated that <b>social</b> <b>group</b> size is related to brain size in non-human animals. In two experiments, the present study aimed to extend findings by Dunbar and Spoors (1995) using their measure of <b>social</b> <b>group</b> size in humans. This measure postulates {{that there are three}} different closeness levels in <b>social</b> <b>group</b> size and that the levels scale up in a ratio of 3 : 1, level 1 being the smallest. Moreover, we aimed to place studies in this field in the context of individual differences. Experiment 1 : Examining head size, general intelligence and personality, {{it was found that the}} three levels of <b>social</b> <b>group</b> size suggested by Dunbar (Zhou et al., 2005) are indeed distinct. However, they did not scale up in the ratios predicted. Dunbar’s measure of <b>social</b> <b>group</b> size was found to be related to head size and general intelligence, but not as consistently as reported in Dunbar’s studies (Dunbar & Spoors, 1995; Hill & Dunbar, 2003; Zhou et al., 2005). Moreover, <b>social</b> <b>group</b> size was found to be related to personality. Experiment 2 : Adding social cognition as a variable, it was found that <b>social</b> <b>group</b> size correlates with head size through social and general cognition, but personality is also a significant factor in <b>social</b> <b>group</b> size. These findings led us to suggest that although the relationship between head size and <b>social</b> <b>group</b> size is mediated by cognition, as suggested by Dunbar (Hill & Dunbar, 2003), this does not provide conclusive evidence for the claim that the brain expanded ‘for’ social ability, as personality was also a major factor in <b>social</b> <b>group</b> size. We suggest, therefore, that the field should focus more on individual differences and, furthermore, that the field is in need of more nuanced studies...|$|R
5|$|Apart {{from the}} lion, the cheetah {{is the only}} cat that is gregarious; however, female cheetahs tend to remain solitary. Tim Caro, of the University of California, Davis, {{identified}} the various social classes and their longevity. Pregnant and nursing females, a few adolescents, and males who have not joined any groups are typically solitary. Non-lactating females, their cubs, adolescent siblings, and several males will form their own groups. A loose association between individuals {{of the opposite sex}} can be observed during the breeding season. These <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> typically keep away from one another.|$|E
5|$|Because {{norms for}} {{language}} use {{are shared by}} members of a specific group, communicative style also becomes a way of displaying and constructing group identity. Linguistic differences may become salient markers of divisions between <b>social</b> <b>groups,</b> for example, speaking a language with a particular accent may imply membership of an ethnic minority or social class, one's area of origin, or status {{as a second language}} speaker. These kinds of differences {{are not part of the}} linguistic system, but are an important part of how people use language as a social tool for constructing groups.|$|E
5|$|Evidence that Daspletosaurus {{lived in}} <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> {{comes from a}} bonebed found in the Two Medicine Formation of Montana. The bonebed {{includes}} the remains of three Daspletosaurus, including a large adult, a small juvenile, and another individual of intermediate size. At least five hadrosaurs are preserved at the same location. Geologic evidence indicates that the remains were not brought together by river currents but {{that all of the}} animals were buried simultaneously at the same location. The hadrosaur remains are scattered and bear many marks from tyrannosaur teeth, indicating that the Daspletosaurus were feeding on the hadrosaurs at the time of death. The cause of death is unknown. Currie speculates that the daspletosaurs formed a pack, although this cannot be stated with certainty. Other scientists are skeptical of the evidence for <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> in Daspletosaurus and other large theropods; Brian Roach and Daniel Brinkman have suggested that Daspletosaurus social interaction would have more closely resembled the modern Komodo dragon, where non-cooperative individuals mob carcasses, frequently attacking and even cannibalizing each other in the process.|$|E

5|$|Matangi {{is often}} {{described}} as an outcaste and impure. Her association with pollution mainly streams from her relation to outcaste communities, considered to be polluted in Hindu society. These <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> deal in occupations deemed inauspicious and polluted like collection of waste, meat-processing and working in cremation grounds. In a Nepali context, such groups are collectively called Matangi, who collect waste—including human waste—and other inauspicious things, and often live outside villages. Thus she is associated with death, pollution, inauspiciousness and the periphery of Hindu society.|$|E
5|$|Social {{anthropology}} is {{the branch}} of anthropology that studies how contemporary living human beings behave in <b>social</b> <b>groups.</b> Practitioners of social anthropology, like sociologists, investigate various facets of social organization. Traditionally, social anthropologists analysed non-industrial and non-Western societies, whereas sociologists focused on industrialized societies in the Western world. In recent years, however, social anthropology has expanded its focus to modern Western societies, meaning that the two disciplines increasingly converge.|$|E
5|$|Active mainly {{during the}} day, the impala may be gregarious or {{territorial}} {{depending upon the}} climate and geography. Three distinct <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> can be observed: the territorial males, bachelor herds and female herds. The impala is known for two characteristic leaps that constitute an anti-predator strategy. Browsers as well as grazers, impala feed on monocots, dicots, forbs, fruits and acacia pods (whenever available). An annual, three-week-long rut takes place {{toward the end of}} the wet season, typically in May. Rutting males fight over dominance, and the victorious male courts female in oestrus. Gestation lasts six to seven months, following which a single calf is born and immediately concealed in cover. Calves are suckled for four to six months; young males—forced out of the all-female groups—join bachelor herds, while females may stay back.|$|E
40|$|Recently, a Canadian {{administrative}} tribunal recognized homosexuals as a particular <b>social</b> <b>group.</b> In April 1992, the Convention Refugee Determination Division (the “CRDD”) of the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Board (the “Canadian IRB”) granted refugee status to an Argentine {{man who was}} persecuted in Argentina because of his homosexuality. The Canadian IRB held in Re: Inaudi that homosexuals constitute a particular <b>social</b> <b>group</b> {{for the purpose of}} satisfying the definition of “refugee. ” Re: Inaudi is similar to the two U. S. administrative decisions in that Re: Inaudi does not have precedential value. This Comment argues that U. S. courts and administrative agencies should rely on Re: Inaudi to hold that homosexuals constitute a particular <b>social</b> <b>group.</b> Part I sets forth the origin of the <b>social</b> <b>group</b> category in U. S. and Canadian immigration law. Part I also examines how the phrase “membership in a particular social group” has been interpreted and applied in Canada and the United States. Furthermore, Part I discusses the U. S. government 2 ̆ 7 s treatment of homosexuals. Part II sets forth the facts and holding of the Canadian IRB 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Re: Inaudi. Part III argues that Re: Inaudi provides a thorough analysis of why homosexuals constitute a particular <b>social</b> <b>group,</b> integrating into its decision the various factors that the U. S. has applied in determining what constitutes a particular <b>social</b> <b>group</b> in general. Because Re: Inaudi provides a thorough, detailed and sound analysis of what constitutes a particular <b>social</b> <b>group</b> in general, and why homosexuals, in particular, form a particular <b>social</b> <b>group,</b> U. S. courts and administrative agencies should rely on Re: Inaudi to extend their definition of a particular <b>social</b> <b>group</b> to include homosexuals. This Comment concludes that, in the future, the U. S. BIA and the U. S. federal courts should recognize homosexuals as a particular <b>social</b> <b>group</b> for the purposes of satisfying the definition of “refugee. ...|$|R

5|$|Commoners {{known as}} guests and {{retainers}} (binke 賓客) {{who lived on}} the property of a host in exchange for services had existed since the Warring States period. Retainers often originally belonged to other <b>social</b> <b>groups,</b> and sometimes they were fugitives seeking shelter from authorities. Hosts were often wealthy nobles and officials, yet they were sometimes wealthy commoners. In a typical relationship, a host provided lodging, food, clothing, and carriage transport for his retainers in return for occasional and non-routine work or services such as an advisory role, a post as bodyguard, menial physical labor around the house, and sometimes more dangerous missions such as committing assassinations, fighting off roving bandits, or riding into battle to defend the host. Others could work as spies, scholarly protégés, or astrologers.|$|E
5|$|Dramatic performances, often {{accompanied}} by music, were popular in the markets. The actors were distinguished in rank by type and color of clothing, honing their acting skills at drama schools. Satirical sketches denouncing corrupt government officials were especially popular.

5|$|Manning explores {{these themes}} {{not only in}} her major novels set in Europe and the Middle East, but also in her Irish fiction, The Wind Changes (1937) and eight short stories which were mostly written early in her career. In these works, {{colonialist}} attitudes are reproduced by Manning's stereotyping of Catholic southerners as wild, primitive and undisciplined, while northerners live lives of well-ordered efficiency. Displaced principal characters struggle to find their place in <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> whose values they no longer accept. Manning has also been noted for her direct and early focus {{on the impact of}} the end of colonial rule. The Rain Forest (1974) presents a later, highly pessimistic view, satirising British expatriate values on a fictional island. It also critiques those involved in the independence movement, expressing a disillusioned view of the island's future post-independence prospects.|$|E

During 1964, South Vietnam had suffered a succession of setbacks on the battlefield, in part due to disunity in the military and a focus on coup plotting.

40|$|Background. Frequent attenders {{in primary}} care have complex {{physical}} and mental healthcare needs as well as low satisfaction with their healthcare. Interventions targeting mental health or psychoeducation have not been effective in reducing attendance. Here, we test the proposition that both frequent attendance and poor health are partly explained by unmet social needs (i. e., limited <b>social</b> <b>group</b> support networks). Methods. Study 1 (N= 1752) was a large cross-sectional community sample of primary care attenders in Scotland. Study 2 (N = 79) was a longitudinal study {{of a group of}} young people undergoing a life transition (moving countries and commencing university) that increased their risk of frequent attendance. Study 3 (N= 46) was a pre-post intervention study examining whether disadvantaged adults who joined a <b>social</b> <b>group</b> subsequently had reduced frequency of primary care attendance. Results. All three studies found that low <b>social</b> <b>group</b> connectedness was associated with a higher frequency of primary care attendance. This was not attributable to poorer health among those who were socially isolated. In Study 3, joining a <b>social</b> <b>group</b> led to reduced primary care attendance to the extent that participants experienced a (subjective) increase in their <b>social</b> <b>group</b> connectedness. Conclusions. Unmet social needs among frequent attenders warrant closer consideration. Interventions that target <b>social</b> <b>group</b> connectedness show promise for reducing overutilization of primary care services...|$|R
