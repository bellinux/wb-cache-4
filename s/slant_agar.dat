40|$|In {{the present}} {{experiments}} minute quantities (10 (- 4), 10 (- 5), 10 (- 6) TCID(50)) of adenovirus type 12 {{were used for}} the infection of culture cells, HeLa-S. After infecting the cells with virus, the tissue cultures were conducted by the <b>slant</b> <b>agar</b> and monolayer methods, to compare the degree of virus proliferation for successive generations in each experimental group. The results of the study are summarized as follows. 1. When HeLa S(3) cells were infected with minute quantities of virus for successive generations (30 days each generation), the virus proliferation, as determined by cytopathic effect (CPE), was better {{in the case of the}} <b>slant</b> <b>agar</b> culture than in the monolayer culture. 2. Similar cultures were conducted by two methods in which the culture period was changed to 7 days or 30 - 35 days for each generation. As a result it was found that the proliferation of the virus could be detected only at the fifth or sixth generation in all the experimental groups. Both the <b>slant</b> <b>agar</b> culture and the monolayer culture of infected HeLa-S(3) cells gave the results similar to those obtained in the successive cultures conducted by the freezingthawing method (reported in Part 1) ...|$|E

This method preserved the morphological features relatively undisturbed compared with adhesive tape preparations. However, it was necessary to modify method of basic slide culture to improve its usability and shorten the time it needed to identify mold fungi. There were four kinds of method carried out in this study; two kinds of modified slide culture, one kind of direct culture on <b>slant</b> <b>agar</b> plate, and a basic slide culture for identifying mold fungi, which result would be compared with each other. These four methods were tested to 4 species of dermatophytes which were known as mold fungi that could infect skin, hair, and nails in human; those were,,, Trichophyton mentagrophytes Microsporum canis Microsporum gypseum and. Result of this study showed that both modified slide culture and direct culture on Epidermophyton floccosum <b>slant</b> <b>agar</b> plate could visualize the structure of dermatophytes faster than basic slide culture method. These methods were also easier to prepare compared to basic culture method. Conclusion of this study showed that basic slide culture method needed to be modified for better identification of mold fungi.

40|$|A {{pure culture}} of a {{microorganism}} resembling in morphology and pathogenic action Bartonella bacilliformis has been obtained from blood taken during life from {{a case of}} Oroya fever which ended fatally. The blood taken at Lima into citrate solution and transported to New York at refrigerator temperature yielded positive cultures 28 days after its withdrawal from the patient. The strain of Bartonella bacilliformis thus isolated grows well on the semisolid leptospira medium, and also on <b>slant</b> <b>agar</b> containing animal blood. The initial growth is not readily recognizable to the naked eye, but {{the presence of the}} organisms can be determined by means of the dark-field microscope and by Giemsa and Gram staining methods. No growth has been obtained on the more ordinary culture media. The organism is an obligate aerobe, is Gram-negative, and under certain cultural conditions motile. All the forms which have been described as occurring in human red corpuscles may be found in the cultures, and in addition many granular and coarsely irregular forms have been met with. The inoculation of cultures of Bartonella bacilliformis into Macacus rhesus produces infection and gives rise to effects which differ with the mode of inoculation. The intravenous injection of the culture into young macaques induces a prolonged irregularly remittent fever. The organism can be cultivated from the blood over a long period, and it has been detected within the red corpuscles of the monkeys, reproducing the precise appearances observed in human cases of Oroya fever. The intradermal injection of the culture into the eyebrow of young macaques gives rise to nodular formations rich in new blood vessels and showing the bacilliform organism within the endothelial cells.

40|$|In part I of {{the present}} paper, the author {{reported}} {{the results of his}} experiments on the changes in the numbers of intestinal bacteria, an increase in weight and the nature of fecal discharges of 4 groups of mice which were fed on the basal diet alone, yoghurt, whole milk and skim milk in addition to the basal diet. Part IC deals with the results of experiments on Yoghurt 2 ̆ 7 s action of inhibiting the growth of pathogenic organisms in the intestines. The rat typhoid bacterium, S 9 Salmonella tyhimurium(1406), (M. L. D. 1 × 10 ^ mg), was orally given to three groups of young, male mice fed on the basal diet alone, and yoghurt and skim milk in addition to the basal diet. Then, {{the presence or absence of}} the symptoms of the disease, general condition, the nature of feces and the changes in the numbers of intestinal bacteria of the three groups of mice were examined in chronological sequence. The typhoid bacteria had been incubated in <b>slant</b> <b>agar</b> mediums for 24 hours at 37 ℃; 8 mg of them had been weighed by a platinum loop and dissolved in about 0. 5 - 1. 0 cc of bouillon. A piece of bread imbued with them was given to a mouce. In the same way or in the previous experiments, the number of typhoid bacteria excreted in the feces was computed in E. M. B. culture mediums every other day. The numbers of intestinal bacteria found in the feces were computed prior to, 7 days after and 13 days after the rat typhoid bacteria had been given. Examination of the general condition, the nature of feces, the number of the typhoid bacteria excreted in the feces, the time elapsed before the feces have become free of the rat typhoid bacteria, and the number of deaths in three groups of mice has led the author to the findings summarized as follows :. 1) The group fed on yoghurt in addition to the basal diet has shown the strongest resistance to an infection with the rat typhoid bacteria. 2) There has been no significant difference between hydrogen ion concentrations of the three groups of mice. This would suggest that, as has been claimed, there is some other function in yoghurt besides the acid production by L. bulgaric. 3) it would seem that the administration of yoghurt, is effective to a certain degree in inhibiting the growth of pathogenic organisms in the intestines.

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{adenovirus}} type 12 nduces tumor in {{a high proportion of}} young hamsters, and also other types of adenoviruses do so to some extent. In the study of this virus the problems are posed the survival of the virus inoculated in animals, {{the presence or absence of}} the virus in the tumor developed by the virus, and the isolation of virus from man. It is, therefore, necessary to find out some appropriate methods to detect even a minute quantity of virus. With this view in mind, the authors conducted a series of experiments by the following three methods of successive tissue cultures using monolayer HeLa cells in culture infected with adenovirus 12 for the period of 7 days for each generation to see which of the three methods is most suitable. The results of this study are briefly summarized as follows 1. The tissue culture conducted for generations of HeLa cells with freezing-thawing techniques: The cells growing in monolayer in the test tubes were infected with adenovirus type 12 and cultured for 7 days as one generation. At the termination of each culture period the medium was changed with 1 ml of fresh one. The first generation cells were frozen and thawed, cent-rifuged, and then the supernatant was placed into new monolayer HeLa cells. Subsequently, tissue culture was continued for generation after generation. In the doses of 1, and 10 (- 1) TCID(50) of virus used, 3 generations were needed to confirm proliferation of virus on the ground of cellular degeneration, and in the doses of 10 (- 2), 2 × 10 (- 3), and 10 (- 3) TCID(50), 4 generations were needed. 2. Virus culture through successive generations of infected cells: As in the preceding experiments the infected HeLa cells were cultured for 7 days, and after dispersing the cells in monolayer with trypsin solution, this first generation was divided into two equal parts, each of which was placed in the test tubes and cultured. Successive cultures were conducted in similar manner. The growth rate of virus in this series proved to be about the same as in the foregoing experiments. 3. Virus culture on slant agar: As in the preceding experiments the infected HeLa cells cultured for 7 days were dispersed with trypsin solution. This cell suspension of the first generation was centrifuged and the sediment, divided into about five equal masses of cells, was placed on slanted surface of agar, and cultured. Then one half the amount of the cells growing on the agar for 7 days was cultured again on the agar. The other half of the sediment was frozen-thawed with 1 ml of the medium, centrifuged, and the supernatant was placed in the new monolayer to determine the proliferation of the virus. This method also gave the results not so different from those by the two preceding methods. From these results it is concluded that the tissue culture conducted on the <b>slant</b> <b>agar</b> is the most suitable method for the detection of virus growth because it is easy to manipulate and simple to maintain successive generations...|$|E
