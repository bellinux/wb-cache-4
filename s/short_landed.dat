25|$|Normal {{landings}} {{are done}} by touching all three wheels {{down at the}} same time in a three-point landing. This method does allow the <b>shortest</b> <b>landing</b> distance but can be difficult to carry out in crosswinds, as rudder control may be reduced severely before the tailwheel can become effective.|$|R

50|$|The LAR fleet is {{expanded}} to include a Cessna Citation Mustang, an aircraft to be primarily used for the organ team transportation activities.

50|$|Runway 18C / 36C (1170m) is {{used for}} winch launches, in most cases 36C due to wind {{conditions}}. Landings are usually done on the two <b>shorter</b> <b>landing</b> fields, but in calm wind conditions and with little traffic the center runway {{is used in the}} opposite direction to reduce turnaround times.|$|R

50|$|The unique {{capabilities}} of the C-7 for <b>short</b> <b>landing</b> and takeoff made Caribou transports absolutely vital to the war effort. On many occasions the C-7s flew emergency airlift missions to airstrips and combat areas that no other aircraft could reach. Most notable were those in support of special forces camps in the Central Highlands.|$|R
5000|$|Agellos M.70, {{powered by}} a [...] Colombo S.53 engine, had among the three {{shortest}} takeoff runs and demonstrated the <b>shortest</b> <b>landing</b> distance {{of any of the}} 53 entrants, stopping in only 50 meters (164 feet). Overall, the point system placed the M.70 in the ninth starting position, allowing Agello to start with an 11-minute handicap.|$|R
5000|$|Terrain: this is {{especially}} a factor for eventers as they ride combinations cross-country. A combination on the downhill tends to lengthen the stride, and on the uphill it tends to shorten it. Going though water tends to shorten the stride. Landing up a bank causes a <b>shorter</b> <b>landing</b> distance than from an upright obstacle.|$|R
50|$|It has {{two main}} landing {{platforms}} on the 1st and 2nd tracks. On the 3rd (middle) {{track in the}} 1990s, during the repair of the line section after a landslide, an additional <b>short</b> <b>landing</b> platform for one car was built.

25|$|The XT-37 was aerodynamically clean, {{so much so}} that a speedbrake {{was fitted}} behind the {{nosewheel}} doors to help increase drag for landing and for use in other phases of flight.
