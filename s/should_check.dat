The United Kingdom consumer charity, Which? warned that consumers who could not get an adequate DAB signal could be misled by the in-store sets. The Digital Radio Development Bureau replied to the Which? report stating that stores contain a steel structure which produce a faraday cage effect where DAB signals are blocked out. The DRDB recommended that consumers <b>should</b> <b>check</b> DAB coverage online with their postcode before purchasing a DAB radio to avoid disappointment.|$|E

Presentation with fever, fatigue, and haemolytic anaemia requires diagnostic confirmation by identifying the parasites within red blood cells on blood film and by specific serology. Quinine (with or without clindamycin) is usually an effective treatment.|$|E
25|$|Scribing (also {{known as}} {{pencilling}} or writing) is the writing {{down of the}} scores and comments of judges at dressage events so that the judge can concentrate on the performance. In addition to this, the scribe <b>should</b> <b>check</b> the identity of each competitor, and ensure that the test papers are complete and signed before handing them to the scorers. The scribe should have some knowledge of dressage terminology, be smartly dressed and have legible handwriting. The scribe should also be professional in manner, neutral and not engage in small talk or make comments. It is permissible to use abbreviations provided they are accepted and intelligible.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to test whether a graph is bipartite, and to return either a two-coloring (if it is bipartite) or an odd cycle (if it is not) in linear time, using depth-first search. The main idea is to assign to each vertex the color that differs from the color of its parent in the depth-first search forest, assigning colors in a preorder traversal of the depth-first-search forest. This will necessarily provide a two-coloring of the spanning forest consisting of the edges connecting vertices to their parents, {{but it may not}} properly color some of the non-forest edges. In a depth-first search forest, one of the two endpoints of every non-forest edge is an ancestor of the other endpoint, and when the depth first search discovers an edge of this type it <b>should</b> <b>check</b> that these two vertices have different colors. If they do not, then the path in the forest from ancestor to descendant, together with the miscolored edge, form an odd cycle, which is returned from the algorithm together with the result that the graph is not bipartite. However, if the algorithm terminates without detecting an odd cycle of this type, then every edge must be properly colored, and the algorithm returns the coloring together with the result that the graph is bipartite.|$|E

500|$|The {{most famous}} {{incident}} in the hearings was an exchange between McCarthy and the army's chief legal representative, Joseph Nye Welch. On June 9, the 30th day of the hearings, Welch challenged Roy Cohn to provide U.S. Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr. with McCarthy's list of 130 Communists or subversives in defense plants [...] "before the sun goes down". McCarthy stepped in and said that if Welch was so concerned about persons aiding the Communist Party, he <b>should</b> <b>check</b> on {{a man in his}} Boston law office named Fred Fisher, who had once belonged to the National Lawyers Guild, a progressive lawyers association.|$|E
500|$|Positive {{reviews of}} the Sci-Fi Dine-In have {{indicated}} diverse reasons for appreciating the restaurant. In Vegetarian Walt Disney World and Greater Orlando, Susan Shumaker and Than Saffel write that the restaurant has [...] "the wackiest dining experience in any Disney park". Shumaker and Saffel contend that the Sci-Fi Dine-In provides a reasonable compromise when vegetarians and non-vegetarians are looking to eat together, {{and that it is}} also suitable for both large and small families with young children. The restaurant tends to be popular with children, and it is common for people who lived through the 1950s to enjoy the restaurant for its nostalgia value. Paul Schultz of the Daily News writes, [...] "Anyone who is a fan of trashy sci-fi movies of the 1950s <b>should</b> <b>check</b> [...] out". In his book Sci-Fi Movie Freak, Robert Ring calls the Sci-Fi Dine-In film clips [...] "hokey", while David Steele of The Rotarian calls them [...] "classically awful", and Rick Ramseyer of Restaurant Business Magazine calls them [...] "campy".|$|E
2500|$|Hence, {{to detect}} {{negative}} cycles using the Floyd–Warshall algorithm, one can inspect the diagonal {{of the path}} matrix, {{and the presence of}} a negative number indicates that the graph contains at least one negative cycle. To avoid numerical problems one <b>should</b> <b>check</b> for negative numbers on the diagonal of the path matrix within the inner for loop of the algorithm. Obviously, in an undirected graph a negative edge creates a negative cycle [...] (i.e., a closed walk) involving its incident vertices. Considering all edges of the above example graph as undirected, e.g. the vertex sequence 4 – 2 – 4 is a cycle with weight sum −2.|$|E

2500|$|In what {{played out}} to be the most {{dramatic}} exchange of the hearings, McCarthy responded to aggressive questioning from Army counsel Joseph Welch. On June 9, 1954, day 30 of the hearings, Welch challenged Cohn to give McCarthy's list of 130 subversives in defense plants to the office of the FBI and the Department of Defense [...] "before the sun goes down". In response to Welch's challenge, McCarthy suggested that Welch <b>should</b> <b>check</b> on Fred Fisher, a young lawyer in Welch's own Boston law firm whom Welch planned to have on his staff for the hearings. McCarthy then mentioned that Fisher had once belonged to the National Lawyers Guild (NLG), a group which Attorney General Brownell had called [...] "the legal bulwark of the Communist Party".|$|E
2500|$|At 3:41 AM, Gassiev {{told the}} {{supervisor}} {{in the first}} call that a Russian colonel had asked to inspect military vehicles that [...] "crowded" [...] the tunnel. Gassiev said: [...] "The commander, a colonel, approached and said, ‘The guys with you <b>should</b> <b>check</b> the vehicles.’ Is that O.K.?" [...] Asked about {{the identity of the}} colonel, Gassiev answered: [...] "I don’t know. Their superior, the one in charge there. The B.M.P.’s and other vehicles were sent here and they’ve crowded there. The guys are also standing around. And he said that we should inspect the vehicles. I don’t know. And he went out." [...] Gassiev informed the supervisor at 3:52 AM that armored vehicles had left the tunnel. They were commanded by a colonel Kazachenko.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2007, still {{campaigning for}} the Republican presidential nomination, Romney summed up his general {{position}} {{on gun control}} at that time as: [...] "we <b>should</b> <b>check</b> on the backgrounds {{of people who are}} trying to purchase guns. We also should keep weapons of unusual lethality from being on the street. And finally, we should go after people who use guns in the commission of crimes or illegally, but we should not interfere with the right of law-abiding citizens to own guns either for their own personal protection or hunting or any other lawful purpose." [...] He also said that, had it come before him as president, he would have signed a renewal of the federal assault weapons ban that had expired. The following month, during a presidential primary debate, he noted that the federal assault weapons ban that he would have signed as president had failed in Congress, and he insisted that he would not support any new gun control legislation: [...] "I do not believe we need new legislation. I do not support any new legislation of an assault weapon ban nature, including that against semiautomatic weapons. I instead believe that we have laws in place that if they're implemented and enforced, will provide the protection and the safety of the American people." ...|$|E
