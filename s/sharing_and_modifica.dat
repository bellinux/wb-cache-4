40|$|Introduction: High-density {{lipoprotein}} (HDL) cholesterol is {{a well-established}} inverse {{risk factor for}} cardiovascular disease. The extent to which cardiovascular risk can be modified through changes in HDL, however, is less clear. We further examined the role of aggressive HDL raising therapy on cardiovascular outcomes in the 143 patients enrolled in the Armed Forces Regression Study (AFREGS). Methods: Reanalysis of the AFREGS population. Patients with stable coronary disease were randomized to receive gemfibrozil, niacin, and cholestyramine in combination or matching placebos, on top of aggressive dietary <b>and</b> exercise <b>modifica...</b>|$|R

In this paper, a new analysis is described which can infer <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> freeness information to an unusually high degree of accuracy. By encoding structural properties of substitutions in a sharing group fashion, a powerful depth-k <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> freeness analysis is synthesised which exploits the synergy between tracing <b>sharing</b> information <b>and</b> tracking term structure. The analysis propagates groundness with the accuracy of <b>sharing</b> groups <b>and</b> yet can precisely infer <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> freeness. Correctness is formally proven...|$|R

However, huge amount of accumulated spatial data were not fully utilized due {{to the difficulty of}} <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> integration. A forest spatial data <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> integration system was developed based on GeoServer. A distributed architecture was adopted to address the data storage in different organizations.

40|$|<b>Sharing</b> <b>and</b> {{integrating}} Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System/Science (GIS) {{models are}} critical for developing practical application systems. Facilitating model <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> model integration {{is a problem for}} model publishers and model users, respectively. To address this problem, a framework based on a Web service for <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> integrating RS and GIS models is proposed in this paper. The fundamental idea of the framework is to publish heterogeneous RS and GIS models into standard Web services for <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> interoperation and then to integrate the RS and GIS models using Web services. For the former, a “black box” and a visual method are employed to facilitate the publishing of the models as Web services. For the latter, model integration based on the geospatial workflow and semantic supported marching method is introduced. Under this framework, model <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> integration is applied for developing the Pearl River Delta water environment monitoring system. The results show that the framework can facilitate model <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> model integration for model publishers and model users...|$|R

Along with traditional methods of load <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> job scheduling, it also examines methods referred to as epoch load <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> epoch scheduling respectively. Epoch load sharing evenly distributes the load among workstations with job migration that occurs {{only at the end}} of predefined intervals. The time interval between successive load sharing events is called an epoch. The objective is {{to reduce the number of}} times that global system information is needed to make allocation decisions, while at the same time achieving good overall performance and fairness of individual job service. In the epoch scheduling case, processor queues are rearranged only at the end of epochs. The objective is to find an epoch that minimizes the number of queue rearrangements, while being fair and producing good system performance. Simulation is used to measure performance issues associated with load <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> job scheduling.

40|$|Five {{small groups}} of {{preschool}} children were taught to <b>share</b> <b>and</b> praise by the modelling of these behaviors and reinforcement of their reports of <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> praising. Experiment I demonstrated that modelling and reinforcement of any (true or untrue) reports of <b>sharing,</b> <b>and</b> then of praising, promptly increased reports of the corresponding behaviors. Modelling and reinforcement for true reports of each behavior increased both reporting and actual behavior. Experiment II showed that both reported <b>and</b> actual <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> praising may be increased by modelling and reinforcement for true reports of the target behavior, without previous reinforcement for any (true or untrue) reports of those behaviors. Sharing, but not praising, generalized to a second setting. Experiment III replicated the results of Experiment II for <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> praising, and demonstrated similar success in increasing a third behavior, specific praising. In general, these experiments show that developing correspondence between children's reports of behavior and actual behavior may be an efficient means of increasing prosocial responses...|$|R
