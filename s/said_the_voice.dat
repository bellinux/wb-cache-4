500|$|With one exception, episode credits list {{only the}} voice actors, {{and not the}} {{characters}} they voice. Both Fox and the production crew wanted to keep their identities secret during the early seasons and, therefore, closed most of the recording sessions while refusing to publish photos of the recording artists. However, the network eventually revealed which roles each actor performed in the episode [...] "Old Money", because the producers <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> actors should receive credit for their work. In 2003, the cast appeared in an episode of Inside the Actors Studio, doing live performances of their characters' voices.|$|E

Every main cast member has won an Emmy for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance. Shearer was the last cast member to win, receiving his award in 2014 for the episode [...] "Four Regrettings and a Funeral."

2500|$|Caresse {{accepted}} Henry's proposal. She wrote {{at the top}} {{the title}} given her by Henry Miller, Opus Pistorum (later republished as Henry's work as Under the Roofs of Paris), and started right in. Henry left for his car tour of America. Caresse churned out 200 pages, and the collector’s agent asked for more. Caresse's smut was just what the oil man wanted, according to his New York agent. No literary aspirations, just plain sex. In her journal, Nin wrote, [...] "'Less poetry,' <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> over the telephone. 'Be specific.'" [...] In Caresse the agent had found the basic pornographic Henry Miller.|$|E

5000|$|British {{serial killer}} Peter Sutcliffe was a gravedigger in the 1960s. At his trial, Sutcliffe {{claimed to have}} heard voices that ordered him to kill prostitutes {{while working as a}} gravedigger. He <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> {{originated}} from a headstone of a deceased Polish man, Bronisław Zapolski, and that <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> were that of God.|$|R
6000|$|... "Only a few words. She {{came to my}} room {{last night}} and {{told me she had}} only a dim {{recollection}} of what took place. She <b>said</b> <b>The</b> <b>Voices</b> wanted to talk to me--but I didn't want them to talk to me--and said so--and she went away." ...|$|R
2500|$|CommonSenseMedia {{gave the}} show {{a rating of}} 3 stars out of 5, writing [...] "Despite the show's charms, it doesn't quite {{live up to the}} {{original}} film. But it does teach viewers about the responsibilities of growing up -- the good, the bad, and, of course, the funny -- and it's definitely something that families can watch together, especially as it {{spends a lot of time}} focusing on family dynamics." [...] The Hour praised the show for having Disney-quality animation, for being faithful to the film's storyline, and for giving viewers a chance to discover what happens after the movie ends. However, it noted the voice actors are not the same and <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> of Terk is [...] "really annoying".|$|E
6000|$|... "I hear you," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> of Benita, {{speaking}} in English, although Jacob, forgetting, had addressed her in Portuguese.|$|E
6000|$|... "I expect it’s a death-warning for you, George," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice,</b> solemnly. [...] "The last {{watchman}} died sudden, you remember." ...|$|E
500|$|Chris Roper of IGN <b>said</b> that <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> {{acting on}} Chains of Olympus was nice. For God of War: Ghost of Sparta, Nicole Tanner of IGN wrote that it [...] "ontinues the {{tradition}} of great voice acting" [...] that [...] "we've come to expect from a God of War installment." [...] Joe Juba of Game Informer <b>said</b> that <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> work was solid.|$|R
500|$|Reviewers {{variously}} appreciated and disliked <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> acting. Game Revolution and Computer Games <b>said</b> <b>the</b> acting {{ranged from}} adequate to good, while CGW <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> were inappropriate and [...] the 12th century European voices sounding like modern Americans, {{but that the}} modern-era featured better actors. ArsTechnica <b>said</b> <b>the</b> acting was inconsistent but was better than that of Deus Ex. The weather effects, background sound, and moody music were said to blend together well and help immerse the player in the game's world. CGW <b>said</b> <b>the</b> sound quality was sometimes poor.|$|R
6000|$|... "Monsieur," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> soft <b>voice</b> at last,--"Monsieur desire savoir si je consens--si--enfin, si je veux me marier avec lui?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never {{mind what}} you've demonstrated!--I'm starving," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>Voice,</b> [...] "and {{the night is}} chilly to a man without clothes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{ought to}} be ashamed of yourselves,' <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> of Mr. Raddle, which {{appeared}} to proceed from beneath some distant bed-clothes.|$|E
6000|$|... 'This is no {{time for}} stopping,' <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> of the giant's daughter, as he leant against the trunk to recover his breath.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Are you there, Montezuma, my brother?' she <b>said</b> in <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> of Papantzin; 'surely I {{feel your}} {{presence}} though I cannot see you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "God alone gives victory," [...] <b>said</b> {{suddenly}} <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> of Jaffir, who, {{very still}} at Jorgenson's elbow, {{had been listening}} to the conversation.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Bill's right enough,' <b>said</b> <b>the</b> coarse <b>voice</b> of <b>the</b> man {{who held}} me (it had been Miss Mowbray's). 'Bring out the picture, 'Arry.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He wonders," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> slowly--"he wonders! Frizzling, frizzling, frizzling, my pretty Talk-by-Night, {{with seven}} smoking Gelica-nuts for {{company on the}} spit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{coming in}} a minute," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> from the ledge above their heads, a voice {{somewhat}} suggestive of an articulate yawn.|$|E
6000|$|... "Friend-from-the-Sea" [...] (that was {{the name}} that these islanders had given to me), <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> of Marama, [...] "say--what are you doing here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘It’s only me, sir,’ <b>said</b> <b>the</b> soft <b>voice</b> of Dawson. ‘It’s the Viscount, sir. He is very desirous {{to speak}} with you on business.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Where is your master?" [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> {{well-known}} <b>voice</b> of Lord Lufton; {{and then}} in half a minute he also was in the book-room.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, very well," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> deep <b>voice</b> indifferently. [...] "All I {{wanted to}} ask was, if {{anything}} had been heard of Fanny Robin?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You couldn't oblige {{me with a}} light, could you, guv'nor?" [...] he <b>said.</b> <b>The</b> <b>voice</b> sounded strange, {{coming from}} the figure that it did.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, my fair visitor," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> {{which had}} {{acquired}} a tone of pleased anticipation, [...] "what mental repast has your goodness provided?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stranger," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> in Arabic, {{but much}} purer and more {{classical}} Arabic than the Amahagger talk--"stranger, wherefore art thou so much afraid?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let God {{deal with}} them," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> first <b>voice,</b> which to Adrian sounded familiar. [...] "We have done enough. Go home in peace." ...|$|R
25|$|Sutcliffe {{was charged}} at Dewsbury on 5 January. At his trial, he {{pleaded not guilty}} to 13 charges of murder, but guilty to {{manslaughter}} on the grounds of diminished responsibility. The basis of his defence was he claimed to be the tool of God's will. Sutcliffe claimed to have heard voices that ordered him to kill prostitutes while working as a gravedigger.

6000|$|... 'I hope he's {{going ahead}} with the {{destruction}} of himself,' <b>said</b> <b>the</b> quick <b>voice</b> of <b>the</b> Russian. Halliday giggled, and lolled his head back, vaguely.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bukawai's {{medicine}} is very strong," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice.</b> [...] "Five goats {{and a new}} sleeping mat are scarce enough in exchange for Bukawai's medicine." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Then {{leave him}} to me: I am his wife," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice,</b> clear and sharp {{now with the}} anguish those hard words had brought.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Watson," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> well-remembered <b>voice,</b> [...] "I owe you a {{thousand}} apologies. I {{had no idea}} that you would be so affected." ...|$|R
