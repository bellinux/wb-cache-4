5|$|Deptford {{railway station}} {{is one of}} the oldest {{suburban}} stations in the world, being built (c.1836-38) as part of the first <b>suburban</b> <b>service</b> (the London and Greenwich Railway), between London Bridge and Greenwich. Close to Deptford Creek is a Victorian pumping station built in 1864, part of the massive London sewerage system designed by civil engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette.|$|E

25|$|The {{core part}} of the route is the main line between King's Cross and Edinburgh, with the Hertford Loop used for local and freight {{services}} and the Northern City Line providing an inner <b>suburban</b> <b>service</b> direct to the city.|$|E
25|$|The {{first steps}} towards {{building}} additional tracks for <b>suburban</b> <b>service</b> between Gdańsk and Sopot {{were taken in}} 1912. Station tracks were modified, and buildings were torn down on the planned route. The project was interrupted by the outbreak of World War I.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s, the Rock Island {{tried to}} upgrade the <b>suburban</b> <b>service</b> with newer {{equipment}} at lower cost. Second-hand Aerotrains, while less than successful in intercity service, were purchased to provide further air conditioned accommodations that had proven popular with the 2700 series cars.|$|E
50|$|Electrification was {{cut back}} to Warragul in 1987, when <b>suburban</b> <b>services</b> started to Warragul. Electrification and <b>suburban</b> <b>services</b> were {{cut back to}} Bunyip in 1998, before ceasing beyond Pakenham in 2001. The Victorian Regional Fast Rail project {{upgraded}} {{one of the two}} lines in 2005, between Pakenham and Traralgon.|$|R

25|$|Local {{bus service}} in Rochester and its county suburbs is {{provided}} by the Rochester-Genesee Regional Transportation Authority (RGRTA) via its Regional Transit Service (RTS) subsidiary. RTS also provides <b>suburban</b> <b>service</b> outside the immediate Rochester area and runs smaller transportation systems in outlying counties, such as WATS (Wayne Area Transportation System).|$|E
25|$|Historically, 3,300 V DC {{was used}} for simplicity. The first {{experimental}} track was in Georgian mountains, then the suburban zones of the largest cities were electrified for EMUs - very advantageous due to much better dynamic of such a train compared to the steam one, which is important for <b>suburban</b> <b>service</b> with frequent stops. Then the large mountain line between Ufa and Chelyabinsk was electrified.|$|E

They {{operate on the}} Kiato–Athens International Airport suburban line and as a stopping service on the mainline between Thessaloniki and Larissa, which is also advertised as a <b>suburban</b> <b>service.</b> OSE is in litigation with the Joint Venture of Siemens & Hellenic Shipyards for the supply of those 20 Desiro.|$|E
25|$|Julio Prestes {{connected}} Southwest São Paulo State and Northern Paraná State to São Paulo. Agricultural {{products were}} transferred to Luz Station from which they headed to the Atlantic Ocean and overseas. Julio Prestes stopped transporting passengers through the Sorocabana or FEPASA lines and now only has limited <b>suburban</b> <b>service.</b> Due to its acoustics and interior beauty, surrounded by Greek revival columns, part of the rebuilt station was transformed into the São Paulo Hall.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{the agency}} is embarking on a massive bus {{restructuring}} effort entitled Metro Connections. The project is designed to convert the current grid-based bus system, implemented in 1980, to a hub and spoke system focused on activity centers. The system is to be phased {{in the next four}} years, and will include new express routes and reconfigured local service. <b>Suburban</b> <b>service</b> and low ridership shuttles will be considered for operation by municipal agencies, restructuring, or cancellation.|$|E

25|$|In 1901 a new {{direct line}} to Clifton Hill was opened {{from the central}} Princes Bridge station at the {{southern}} edge of the CBD though the inner eastern suburb of Abbotsford. This meant that Heidelberg-bound trains could run direct to their destination, removing the need for the reversal manoeuvre at Victoria Park. The Preston <b>suburban</b> <b>service</b> also ran via the new line. However, Whittlesea trains continued to use the more indirect route via the Inner Circle, albeit only from Spencer Street station.|$|E
25|$|In late 1912, PRR {{engineers}} recommended large-scale electrification of PRR {{lines with}} alternating current (AC) at 11,000 volts and 25 cycles, {{starting with the}} <b>suburban</b> <b>service</b> along the Main Line between Philadelphia and Paoli. This project was authorized soon thereafter. In 1914 the PRR started adding AC electrical equipment to 93 MP54-type cars at the Altoona shops for use in this service. Each car received a pantograph, a transformer, a power truck, a motorman's cab and controls at each end, and MU circuits. These cars were then designated MP54E to distinguish them from non-electrified cars.|$|E
25|$|The Central Line has two {{interchange}} stations {{with the}} Western Line at Parel and Dadar. Rolling stock {{consists of a}} fleet of AC as well as dual-powered DC-AC EMUs. The major car sheds on this line are at Kurla and Kalwa. There are fast and slow locals here for <b>suburban</b> <b>service.</b> Slow locals halt at every station, while fast locals halts vary between Byculla, Dadar, Kurla, Ghatkopar, Vikhroli, Bhandup, Mulund, Thane, Diva, Dombivali and Kalyan. All services plying beyond Kalyan run as slow service (halting at every station).|$|E

25|$|With the 1980 {{end of the}} Rock Island, the Regional Transportation Authority {{purchased}} the suburban territory and remaining Rock Island commuter equipment from the estate. LaSalle Street Station was torn down and replaced with the Chicago Stock Exchange building with a small station for commuters retained one block south of the old station. The RTA gradually rebuilt the track and added more new equipment to the service, leaving the property {{in better shape than}} it was in the Rock Island's heyday, albeit with less track. The Rock Island District, as the Rock Island's <b>suburban</b> <b>service</b> is now known, now operates as part of Metra, the Chicago Commuter Rail agency.|$|E
25|$|When the {{intensive}} <b>suburban</b> <b>service</b> of 1920 was introduced reliance was still placed largely on these 0-6-0s {{to maintain the}} new split-second timings, and they were quite equal to the task. By then their numbers had been further reinforced by the twenty built in 1900 and 1901 with 160lbf/in² (1.1 MPa) boilers, and by a further twenty turned out in 1904, the latter with 180lbf/in² (1.24 MPa) pressure, larger boilers giving 988sq ft (91.8 m²) heating surface and 14.5sq ft (1.35 m²) grate area, and side-tanks holding 1,200 gallons (5,500 L), which increased the weight to 42½ long tons (43 t). Those built from 1912 onwards were decorated with flared-top chimneys, in place of stovepipes, and the high-roofed cab with side-windows which was now the Holden standard.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} mainline railroads concentrated {{their efforts}} on moving freight and passengers over long distances. But many had suburban services near large cities, which might also be served by Streetcar and Interurban lines. The Interurban was an almost uniquely North American concept which relied almost exclusively on passenger traffic for revenue. Unable to survive the Great Depression, the failure of most Interurbans by that time left many cities without suburban passenger railroads, although the largest cities such as New York, Chicago, Boston and Philadelphia continued to have <b>suburban</b> <b>service.</b> The major railroads passenger flagship services included multi-day journeys on luxury trains resembling hotels, which were unable to compete with airlines in the 1950s. Rural communities were served by slow trains no more than twice a day. They survived until the 1960s because the same train hauled the Railway Post Office cars, {{paid for by the}} US Post Office. RPOs were withdrawn when mail sorting was mechanized.|$|E

It commenced operation in January 1997.|$|R
