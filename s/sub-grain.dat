50|$|As a result, the {{alternate}} theory proposed by Cahn in 1949 is now universally accepted. The recrystallized grains do not nucleate {{in the classical}} fashion but rather grow from pre-existing sub-grains and cells. The 'incubation time' is then a period of recovery where sub-grains with low-angle boundaries (<1-2°) begin to accumulate dislocations and become increasingly misoriented {{with respect to their}} neighbors. The increase in misorientation increases the mobility of the boundary and so the rate of growth of the <b>sub-grain</b> increases. If one <b>sub-grain</b> in a local area happens to have an advantage over its neighbors (such as locally high dislocation densities, a greater size or favorable orientation) then this <b>sub-grain</b> will be able to grow more rapidly than its competitors. As it grows its boundary becomes increasingly misoriented with respect to the surrounding material until it can be recognized as an entirely new strain-free grain.|$|E

Laterally grown {{crystalline}} grains {{can be as}} large as 17 µm, though the grains consist of small misorientated <b>sub-grains</b> and some <b>sub-grains</b> are divided further into overlapping upper and lower <b>sub-grains.</b> The nickel-induced crystallization starts with thin needle-like crystallites, which advance along the directions within the film plane. These thin needle-like crystallites grow by successive jumps with a very fast growth rate. The fast growth rate and the small probability that the growth directions are within the film plane result in the laterally grown large grains...|$|R

Monolike silicon wafers from two different bricks cut from interior and corner region of an ingot were compared. The mono grain in the interior brick is nearly perfect, but there are some large oblong shaped <b>sub-grains</b> in the corner brick. The large <b>sub-grains</b> at corner brick wafers are oriented at (311), instead of (100) orientation. The (311) grains contain high density of dislocation and cannot be effectively textured by alkaline solution, therefore lowering the cell efficiency significantly.

50|$|Such {{deformation}} {{increases the}} concentration of dislocations which may subsequently form low-angle grain boundaries surrounding <b>sub-grains.</b> Cold working generally results in a higher yield strength {{as a result of}} the increased number of dislocations and the Hall-Petch effect of the <b>sub-grains,</b> and a decrease in ductility. The effects of cold working may be reversed by annealing the material at high temperatures where recovery and recrystallization reduce the dislocation density.|$|R

The depth of subsurface zone was increased with applied loads from 25 µm with 20 N to 25 µm with 80 N. From the analyses results of the formation of wear debris generated by cracks between work hardened layer and matrix, wear mechanism is changed from abrasive wear to adhesive wear with increasing loads from 20 N to 80 N. The formation of <b>sub-grains</b> in the region of subsurface was clearly observed from the sample tested over 60 N loads.

50|$|The basic {{mechanism}} is that during deformation the grains {{will be increasingly}} flattened until the boundaries on each side are separated by only a small distance. The deformation is accompanied by the serration of the grain boundaries due to surface tension effects where they are in contact with low-angle grain boundaries belonging to <b>sub-grains.</b>|$|R

50|$|In metallurgy, {{materials}} science and structural geology, subgrain rotation recrystallization {{is recognized as}} an important mechanism for dynamic recrystallisation. It involves the rotation of initially low-angle <b>sub-grain</b> boundaries until the mismatch between the crystal lattices across the boundary is sufficient {{for them to be}} regarded as grain boundaries. This mechanism has been recognized in many minerals (including quartz, calcite, olivine, pyroxenes, micas, feldspars, halite and garnets) and in metals (various magnesium, aluminium and nickel alloys).|$|E
50|$|Theoretically, {{the concept}} of rock {{plasticity}} is based on soil plasticity which is different from metal plasticity. In metal plasticity, for example in steel, {{the size of a}} dislocation is <b>sub-grain</b> size while for soil it is the relative movement of microscopic grains. The theory of soil plasticity was developed in the 1960s at Rice University to provide for inelastic effects not observed in metals. Typical behaviors observed in rocks include strain softening, perfect plasticity, and work hardening.|$|E
50|$|Through a mechanochemical {{reaction}} process, β-C3N4 can be synthesized. This {{method is}} achieved by ball milling high purity graphite powders down to an amorphous nanoscale size while under an argon atmosphere, then the argon is purged and the graphite powders are introduced to an NH3 gas atmosphere, which after high energy ball milling, {{has been found to}} form a nanosized flake-like structure of β-C3N4. During milling, fracture and welding of the reactants and graphite powder particles occur repeatedly from ball/powder collisions. Plastic deformation of the graphite powder particles occur due to the shear bands decomposing into sub-grains that are separated by low-angle grain boundaries, further milling decreases the <b>sub-grain</b> size until nanosize sub-grains form. The high pressure and intense motion promotes catalytic dissociation of NH3 molecules into monatomic nitrogen on the fractured surface of the carbon. Nanosized carbon powders act substantially different from its bulk material as a result of particle dimension and surface area, causing the nanosized carbon to easily react with the free nitrogen atoms, forming β-C3N4 powder.|$|E

Considerable amount of creep data are available on P 91 steel. However similar data on boron containing P 91 steel are not readily available in open literature. The paper presen s creep and stress rupture data on this steel at several stresses in the temperature range of 600 - 650 °C. Comparison revealed that its creep resistance marginally {{higher than that of}} P 91 grade steel reported in NIMS creep database. The initial creep rates in all cases were found to be very high. This trend is similar to that in steel without boron. The microstructure of crept specimen revealed reduction in dislocation density, coarsening of <b>sub-grains</b> as well as precipitates as a result of creep exposure.

50|$|Krogh's {{main focus}} of {{research}} has been geochronology, an effort which has long involved the integration of field work (particularly in high-grade gneisses of the Grenville Province) with clean-laboratory isotope dilution techniques. With uranium-lead (U-Pb) dating he developed a simple, yet innovative air-abrasion technique for removing exterior portions of minerals that may have suffered Pb-loss, which, combined with improved magnetic separation methods, greatly improved the accuracy and precision of zircon geochronology. In addition, Krogh's laboratory methods for the dissolution of minerals and the subsequent chemical separation of trace quantities of uranium and lead resulted in a significant reduction of environmental Pb contamination (blank) to ultra-low levels, and permitted increasingly small quantities of mineral grains and <b>sub-grain</b> domains to be analyzed. In the mid-1980s, he was instrumental in producing a synthetic 205Pb isotopic tracer (spike) that was distributed for use in U-Pb geochronology laboratories worldwide. The application of Krogh's novel and innovative techniques has revolutionized U-Pb geochronology and permitted the ages of rocks to be determined with unprecedented accuracy and precision. Most {{of what is known}} of the Earth's 4.5 billion-year history has been placed in precise geological sequence using these dating methods.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of Mn solute atoms on <b>sub-grain</b> boundary mobilities in Al {{has been determined}} by accurate electron backscatter diffraction analysis of the <b>sub-grain</b> sizes and misorientations during recovery annealing. High purity Al- 0. 1 and 0. 3 wt. % Mn alloys were deformed by plane strain compression at room temperature to equivalent strains of 1. 8 and annealed in the temperature range 150 - 300 °C. An original method of image analysis on sub-boundaries from electron backscatter diffraction maps was applied to quantify the <b>sub-grain</b> size distributions. The change in average <b>sub-grain</b> size with time at several temperatures was then used to estimate <b>sub-grain</b> boundary mobilities in both Al-Mn alloys. The activation energies for <b>sub-grain</b> mobility {{were found to be}} 48 and 52 and kJ. mol - 1 for the 0. 1 and 0. 3 % Mn alloys respectively, with the higher Mn alloy exhibiting lower rates.

40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of a digital material framework is presented, allowing to build virtual microstructures in agreement with experimental data. The construction of the virtual material consists in building a multi-level Voronoï tessellation. A polycrystalline microstructure made of grains and <b>sub-grains</b> can be obtained in a random or deterministic way. A corresponding finite element mesh can be generated automatically in 3 D, and used for the simulation of mechanical testing under large strain. In the examples shown in this work, the initial mesh was non uniform and anisotropic, {{taking into account the}} presence of interfaces between grains and <b>sub-grains.</b> Automatic remeshing was performed due to the large strains, and maintained the non uniform and anisotropic character of the mesh. A level set approach was used to follow the grain boundaries during the deformation. The grain constitutive law was either a viscoplastic power law, or a crystallographic formulation based on crystal plasticity. Stored energies and precise grain boundary network geometries were obtained directly from the deformed digital sample. This information was used for subsequent modelling of grain growth with the level set approach, on the same mesh...|$|R

40|$|The aim {{off this}} thesis was to {{theoretically}} and experimentally study how the microstructure of additively manufactured 316 L (stainless steel) components {{is affected by}} different wall thicknesses. In addition, hardness and porosity are analyzed with a perspective of wall thickness. In this study 9 different thicknesses, ranging from 0, 2 mm up to 3 mm, were selected.
