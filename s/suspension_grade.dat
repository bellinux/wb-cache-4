40|$|Despite {{research}} {{evidence that}} social context and personal characteristics {{are related to}} girls 2 ̆ 7 violent behavior, {{little is known about}} the relative contribution of such antecedents. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the relative strength of predictors of school violence among a sample of middle school girls. Of special interest were the intervening variables, because knowledge of their relative strength could enable schools to design targeted interventions to reduce school violence. Social learning theory formed the theoretical foundation for the study. A four-part survey consisting of sociodemographic items, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, an amended version of the Attitudes Toward Violence Scale, and the School Violence Inventory (used to assess engagement in offenses that could result in school suspension) was administered to 229 girls enrolled in a middle school in a southern U. S. state. Data were analyzed using hierarchical multiple regressions in which intervenable variables were entered first as a block, followed by nonintervenable variables. The results indicated that the predictors of school violence (from strongest to weakest) were observation of school violence, gang membership, favorable attitude toward violence, school <b>suspension,</b> <b>grade</b> level, and drug use. This finding suggests that female middle school students may be learning to behave violently by observing others engaged in such behavior at school and through the influence of gangs. Implications for positive social change are that the results could be used by educators and other school officials develop specific interventions that more effective target known predictors of school violence among middle school girls (for example, increased student monitoring, after-school programming, and guided classroom discussions on the nature of violence and its motivations) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{macrophage}} receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO) is a class A scavenger receptor. Class A scavenger receptors are multifunctional type II transmembrane glycoproteins {{that have}} roles in modified lipoprotein uptake, innate immunity, and macrophage adhesion. It {{has been shown}} that the extracellular cysteine-rich domain of MARCO is important for ligand binding, but the role of the cytoplasmic N-terminal domain has not yet been characterised. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the role of the cytoplasmic domain in cell adhesion and motility, ligand binding and uptake. Two truncated forms of human MARCO were used in this study: N- MARCO lacks the entire cytoplasmic domain; Nmyr MARCO includes the membrane-proximal putative myristoylation site, but lacks the rest of the cytoplasmic domain. The constructs were expressed in transiently transfected HEK 293 T cells. The Nmyr MARCO mutant had reduced cell surface expression, an effect that was even more apparent in cells transfected with NMARCO. This indicates that the putative myristoylation site is not obligatory for cell surface expression of MARCO, but increases cell surface expression of the protein. When bound to ligand, the two mutants demonstrated a significant increase in cell surface expression, while the cell surface expression of the full-length MARCO remained unchanged. This indicates that the cytoplasmic tail affects membrane trafficking and the regulation of cell surface expression. Maleylated proteins are ligands for scavenger receptor A and other scavenger receptors. This study demonstrates that maleylated bovine serum albumin (MalBSA) is also a ligand for MARCO and this modified protein was used to study MARCO-mediated adhesion and ligand binding. The results show that the cytoplasmic domain of MARCO is not required for binding to MalBSA coated particles. Interestingly, the Nmyr MARCO mutant showed a decreased ability to bind soluble MalBSA compared to the full-length protein indicating that the cytoplasmic domain may be necessary for endocytosis. The cytoplasmic domain of MARCO appeared to be absolutely required for adhesion to tissue culture plastic, anti-MARCO antibody PLK- 1 coated surfaces and <b>suspension</b> <b>grade</b> plastic, and a lesser extent to MalBSA coated surfaces. MARCO mediated adhesion was shown not to require the presence of serum and divalent cations. Studies performed with murine primary resident peritoneal macrophages on a MalBSA coated surface indicated that MARCO is responsible for increased chemokinesis. The results of this study show that the cytoplasmic domain of MARCO affects cell surface expression, endocytosis and adhesion. Further research is needed to determine if and how the cytoplasmic domain on MARCO participates in signalling required for these processes and if it affects cell motility. </p...|$|E
40|$|Sandy {{deposits}} {{from the}} 29 September 2009 tsunami {{on the east}} coast of Upolu, Samoa were investigated to document their characteristics and used to apply an inverse sediment transport model to estimate tsunami flow speed. Sandy deposits 6 to 15 cm thick formed from ~ 25 to ~ 250 m inland. Sedimentary layers in the deposits, that are defined by vertical grain size variation and contacts, are interpreted to have formed during onshore runup of two waves. Deposits at 3 locations (100, 170, and 240 m inland) contained two layers that are predominately normally graded (~ 80 %), but contained massive sections (~ 15 %) and inversely graded sections (~ 5 %) at their bases. About 75 % of the total thickness of normally graded intervals exhibits a signature of sediment falling out of suspension at their top. This type of <b>grading,</b> termed <b>suspension</b> <b>grading</b> here, was first recognized in turbidity current deposits and is characterized by the entire distribution shifting finer upwards in a layer as high-settling velocity, coarser material deposits first and low-settling velocity finer material deposits last. The Jaffe and Gelfenbaum (2007) inverse sediment transport model was applied to intervals within layers that exhibited <b>suspension</b> <b>grading</b> to estimate tsunami flow speed and was able to reproduce the general trends of the observed <b>suspension</b> <b>grading.</b> A key unknown input in the modeling is the bottom roughness. For a bottom roughness parameterization using a Manning's n of 0. 03 (equivalent to a z₀ ~ 0. 006 m for the observed flow depths of 2 – 3 m) flow speeds calculated for the 2 layers at the 3 locations were 3. 8, 3. 6, and 3. 7 m/s (bottom layer/earlier wave) and 4. 4, 4. 4, and 4. 1 m/s (top layer/later wave) at 100, 170, and 240 m inland, respectively. These estimates are consistent with the ~ 3 – 8 m/s tsunami flow speed from boulder transport calculations and result in Froude numbers of ~ 0. 7 – 1. 0 when maximum measured flow depths are used. Because the inverse model assumes the deposit was formed by sediment falling out of suspension care must be taken to model only intervals of the deposit exhibiting <b>suspension</b> <b>grading.</b> Including intervals deposited by either bedload or suspended load transport convergences result in higher, and sometimes unrealistic, tsunami flow speed estimates. 15 page(s...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSediment samples {{have been}} {{collected}} from Lake Nasser during drought and flooding periods to study the effect of flood season on bottom sediment distribution and mode of transportation. Ten sectors with three sites in each sector were chosen from upstream of Aswan High Dam to Adindan. The study showed that Lake Nasser sediments are heterogeneous and are mainly silty clay and clayey silt. Eastern and western sides of the lake include more sand. Depth controlled distribution of grain size (deeper is finer). Sands increase with the starting of the flood season. During drought periods suspension was the most predominant mode of transportation; i. e. sediments transported by a medium of considerable density. During flooding period siltation and suspension were most predominant modes of transportation; i. e. environment with a high energy, various overlapping processes, and variety of depositional environments. C–M diagram indicates that sediments during drought periods behaved as pelagic suspension in which sediments settled from a suspension in stagnant water, rolling; overbank facies suspension and uniform suspension were of less importance.

40|$|This {{study is}} based upon a {{longitudinal}} analysis of data for a cohort of 181, 897 Florida state students who were first time 9 th graders in the 2000 - 01 school year and follows them trough to high school and post-secondary outcomes. Analysis of 9 th <b>grade</b> <b>suspension</b> data finds that black students, students who are economically disadvantaged, and special education students are three demographics subgroups that are disproportionately suspended, both {{in the frequency of}} suspensions and the duration in number of school days lost. While poverty and ethnicity are themselves highly correlated, poverty alone does not explain the disproportionate suspension rates amongst black students. Further analyses show that out-of-school suspensions in the 9 th grade year are also significantly and negatively correlated to later high school graduation as well as post-secondary enrollment and persistence. Thus demographic disparities in disciplinary incidents serve to further widen any academic achievement gaps. Closer analysis though shows though that disciplinary incidents are interrelated with other of indicators of student disengagement from school, such as course failures and absenteeism. Therefore, policies seeking to address these issues cannot focus on reducing suspensions alone, but must also address student attendance and course passing in a comprehensive and systematic manner...|$|R
40|$|Sediment samples {{have been}} {{collected}} from Lake Nasser during drought and flooding periods to study the effect of flood season on bottom sediment distribution and mode of transportation. Ten sectors with three sites in each sector were chosen from upstream of Aswan High Dam to Adindan. The study showed that Lake Nasser sediments are heterogeneous and are mainly silty clay and clayey silt. Eastern and western sides of the lake include more sand. Depth controlled distribution of grain size (deeper is finer). Sands increase with the starting of the flood season. During drought periods suspension was the most predominant mode of transportation; i. e. sediments transported by a medium of considerable density. During flooding period siltation and suspension were most predominant modes of transportation; i. e. environment with a high energy, various overlapping processes, and variety of depositional environments.

40|$|Grain size {{analysis}} {{is a vital}} sedimentological tool used to unravel the hydrodynamic conditions, mode of transportation and deposition of detrital sediments. In this study, detailed grain-size analysis was carried out on thirty-five sandstone samples from the Ecca Group in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Grain-size statistical parameters, bivariate analysis, linear discriminate functions, Passega diagrams and log-probability curves were used to reveal the depositional processes, sedimentation mechanisms, hydrodynamic energy conditions and to discriminate different depositional environments. The grain-size parameters show {{that most of the}} sandstones are very fine to fine grained, moderately well sorted, mostly near-symmetrical and mesokurtic in nature. The abundance of very fine to fine grained sandstones indicate the dominance of low energy environment. The bivariate plots show that the samples are mostly grouped, except for the Prince Albert samples that show scattered trend, which is due to the either mixture of two modes in equal proportion in bimodal sediments or good sorting in unimodal sediments. The linear discriminant function {{analysis is}} dominantly indicative of turbidity current deposits under shallow marine environments for samples from the Prince Albert, Collingham and Ripon Formations, while those samples from the Fort Brown Formation are lacustrine or deltaic deposits. The C-M plots indicated that the sediments were deposited mainly by suspension and saltation, and <b>graded</b> <b>suspension.</b> Visher diagrams show that saltation is the major process of transportation, followed by suspension...|$|R
