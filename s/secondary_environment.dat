40|$|Abstract:. Seawater is {{the most}} {{important}} reservoir for terrestrial iodine (mean concentration 58 #g 1 - 1 I); this is a major influence on iodine distribution in the <b>secondary</b> <b>environment.</b> Volatilization of iodine from the oceans, possibly as elemental iodine or as an organically-bound species, is the main source of the element in the environment. The distribution of iodine in the <b>secondary</b> <b>environment</b> is, therefore, largely controlled by proximity to the oceans, with rainwater and surface run-off relatively enriched in iodine in near-coastal regions. Soil iodine content is also strongly influenced with coastal soils being much enriched and central continental soils being depleted. Topography has a marked influence with soils in rain shadow areas being relatively depleted in iodine. While iodine input is a major controlling influence on its geographical distribution in soils, the soil's ability to retain iodine is also an important factor. Organic matter together with iron and aluminium oxides and clays are the important sinks of soil iodine. An additional factor in the distribution of iodine in the <b>secondary</b> <b>environment,</b> and its subsequent availability to the biosphere, relates o its speciation in soils. In acid oxidizing conditions iodine is likely to be present as the I- ion and as such liable to be volatilized as I 2...|$|E
40|$|First online: 05 April 2015 Niphanda fusca is an {{endangered}} myrmecophilous butterfly inhabiting environments at {{early stages of}} succession. Most of its habitats are places where succession is prevented by human activity. In some places, however, N. fusca lives in natural semi-bare areas, such as cliffs in mountains or grasslands around volcanos. We investigate the genetic structure of N. fusca in Japan and South Korea to address two questions. (1) Are populations in natural environments genetically different from those in <b>secondary</b> <b>environments?</b> and (2) Do populations in natural environments possess greater genetic diversity than those in <b>secondary</b> <b>environments?</b> The AMOVA {{results indicated that the}} populations in natural environments and those in <b>secondary</b> <b>environments</b> were differentiated to some extent; however, more than 80 % of genetic variation was found to occur within the same habitat type and within each population. We found no differences in genetic diversity between populations in the two environments. At present, we have not found a strong reason to consider populations in the two environments as different evolutionarily significant units. We think it is practical to conserve populations in natural environments at first, because in this case we need not manage habitats to protect N. fusca. We have only to inhibit habitat destruction. In contrast, in order to conserve populations in <b>secondary</b> <b>environments,</b> we would have to continue managing the habitats. This is far more difficult than inhibiting habitat destruction...|$|R

The study included children who do not speak yet, so their development is observed through the maturing of the basic movement, which is phylogenetically conditioned. The sample consisted of 80 children (aged 16 to 26 months), 4 teachers and 80 parents of those children. The sample of variables for measuring maturation is based on Delacat theory of a gradual integration of body limbs when moving around, while the pattern variables for measuring primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>environment</b> is represented by construct of four factors (material, substantive, organizational and human resources area).

40|$|MA (Afrikaans en Nederlands), North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2014 Upon {{entering}} {{tertiary education}} {{students have to}} undergo development {{with regard to the}} way in which information is gathered, processed and produced because the academic context (<b>secondary</b> <b>environment)</b> is different to the primary context in so many ways. Students have to acquire the identity or discourse of the <b>secondary</b> <b>environment,</b> in other words they must learn how to behave, interact, believe, speak, read and write in an academic way (Gee, 1996 :viii). When students have acquired the identity of the <b>secondary</b> <b>environment</b> they are well on their way to a successful academic career. The choice has been made to focus on one component of identity, namely reading, and specifically academic reading. The latter concept is defined as the process to accept, reject and synthesize incoming information from various sources – the guiding principle in this process is the aim of theorizing. It was found that comprehension of the semantics and function of conjunction markers played an important role in the academic reading process. And that the cloze test is a good method to teach comprehension of conjunction markers. The aim of the current study is to establish whether the use of cloze tests, focused on conjunction markers, will improve academic reading comprehension, within the framework of academic literacy. The empirical research was conducted amongst first year students at the North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus. Participants were selected using the following criteria: they had AGLA 111 and they were first year students during 2008 - 2010. As basis for this research a pretest-posttest control group experimental design was used. The nature of this research is quantitative and a null-hypothesis (H 0) was formulated: cloze tests as a teaching method will not improve reading comprehension. Six sets of data were used for this investigation: the January 2008 results, the June 2008 results, the January 2009 results, the June 2009 results, the January 2010 results and the June 2010 results. These sets of data were compared using independent t-tests to establish whether the means were statistically significant. The sets of data were compared looking at - the TAG as a whole and - only the questions that involved conjunction markers. The test in January is written before students commence with their studies and the test in June is written after they have received intervention by way of the academic literacy module. The only intervention in 2008 was the standard academic literacy module – this group serves as the control group. During 2009, besides the standard intervention, students underwent five weeks of cloze tests with conjunction markers as focus – this was the pilot study. The experimental group which had standard intervention as well as nine weeks of cloze tests, was the group of 2010. The results of the experiment show that the effect size was big with regard to the results of the TAG as a whole and medium with regards to the questions that involve conjunction markers. The results were statistically significant in both cases and the mean of the post tests were higher in each event. The finding is that cloze test training focussed on conjunction markers is a good method for improving academic reading comprehension, but more research is still necessary. Master...|$|E
30|$|With {{more and}} more {{attention}} paid to the environmental issues nowadays, the study of water treatment materials emerged in a continuous stream [1 – 4]. Hundreds of strategies were proposed {{for the treatment of}} polluted water.

The semiconductor materials were considered to be a promising candidate, and titanium oxide was {{recognized as one of the}} best photocatalyst materials due to its high photocatalytic activity and good chemical and mechanical stability [8 – 12]. Recently, TiO 2 materials with nanotube (NT) array were widely studied, and the tubular morphology was proved to be a promising structure for photocatalysis. Compared with other microcosmic morphologies, TiO 2 NT arrays owned several significant advantages [13 – 17]. Firstly, unique tubular structure could enhance electron-transporting efficiency and restrain the recombination of carriers, which will further produce more reactive oxygen species (ROS) [18, 19]. Secondly, TiO 2 NT arrays are much easier to recycle than the TiO 2 powder photocatalysts [20 – 24]. Thirdly, TiO 2 NT arrays have large specific surface area and high surface energy. However, due to the relatively wide gaps (~[*] 3.2  eV). TiO 2 NT photocatalyst is only active under UV irradiation [25 – 28]. In fact, a photocatalyst that is able to respond with visible light will surely take obvious advantages. At present, the focus of photocatalyst research is to adjust their light response band and improve their photocatalytic efficiency.|$|E

40|$|Stream {{sediment}} {{surveys were}} undertaken {{south of the}} Derbyshire limestone mass and north Leicestershire. The samples were analysed {{for a wide range}} of elements using a direct reading spectrometer. The analytical results were interpreted with the aid of computer-orientated techniques particularly, univariate and multivariate statistical methods. The univariate method used involved breaking down complex elemental distributions into discrete populations. The separated populations were then related to various causitive factors of the geological environment. The multivariate methods of cluster and principal components analyses were extensively used. From the application of Q-mode cluster analysis several criteria were deduced that may be useful in the interpretation of multi-element geochemical data. The results of the surreys showed some distinct elemental and sample associations that can be related to the effects of the <b>secondary</b> <b>environment,</b> bedrock and mineralization. Several areas were found deserving further attention. The Tickow Lane occurrence near Shepshed in Leicestershire showed a conspicuous enrichment of lead and molybdenum within the Triassic sandstones. The highest concentrations of lead and molybdenum were found in the grey sandstone below a dark brown layer. The apparent logarithmic decay pattern of certain elements across the stratigraphy and the clamming effect of finer sediments could imply a general downward percolation of metalliferous, solutions. Primary dispersion studies were also conducted on the limestone wallrocks adjacent to lead-zinc deposits in Derbyshire. Mineralogical, geochemical and thermoluminescence aureoles were determined from wallrock samples from five localities.

In addition, ground magnetic traverses were surveyed in the Foe 1 Fras and Drosgl areas where there are known to be positive aeromagnetic anomalies. The analytical results were examined in some detail by various statistical methods, from which it was concluded that most of the high zinc in stream sediment results were related to hydrous oxide precipitates. The distribution of elements in a few samples showed some indications of mineralisation, but mineralogical examination of the panned concentrates from these sites found no mineral phases which could be related directly to mineralisation or contamination, zinc occurring mainly in iron oxide coatings. It is thus apparent that a source of zinc exists in the general area, perhaps on the wide interfluves, but it is not known whether this source is dispersed or concentrated (i. e. mineralisation) ...|$|E

A good deal of thought and planning was invested in this enterprise in the year prior to the move being executed. This report examines how the move of year seven students to the <b>secondary</b> <b>environment</b> was managed by six Catholic schools, and investigates responses from students and parents during the transition year. It is hoped that the insights gleaned will be of assistance to other schools or sectors considering similar transition arrangements. The schools in the study adopted a variety of different approaches to the transition process and utilised different forms of organization, ranging from a traditional secondary school model to one typifying a strong middle schooling philosophy. In some schools, purpose built year seven learning communities had been constructed or modifications made to existing classrooms to provide a “base” for the students. In other schools the students simply moved from class to class as in a traditional secondary school. In some schools primary trained teachers were employed to teach in the “core” subjects and the year seven students had secondary teachers in the specialist areas. In other schools there was either a mix of primary and secondary trained teachers or the year seven program was taught exclusively by secondary trained teachers.

Examples driven from ceramist sites from Southeastern and Southern Brazil and from Amazonia demonstrate that these groups have transformed the forest landscape by creating areas of secondary vegetation and possible concentrating useful species.

40|$|The {{conference was}} a very useful and {{refreshing}} exploration of the challenges of teaching project management in the post <b>secondary</b> <b>environment.</b> My paper and presentation were both very well received. The paper was selected {{as one of the}} best of the conference and will be included in a Special Edition of the International Journal of Project Management to be published later this year. Interest in project management is growing significantly and an industry is evolving around project management training and education (Price & Dolfi, 2004; Thomas, Mengel & Andres, 2004). Yet the trend towards professionalism and the focus on standardization come into question as the behavioral and personal competencies of project managers outside of project management standards appear to be more relevant for their workplace performance (Crawford, 2005). Furthermore, projects continue to fail at an astonishing rate (Standish, 2001, 2004, Morris and Hough, 1994). At the same time, the role complexity, chaos and uncertainty play within our projects and project environments is gaining recognition in both research and practice. Hence, it is time to review our understanding of project management education and reflect about how we develop project managers to deal with the increasing level of complexity, chaos, and uncertainty in project environments (Aram & Noble, 1999; Stacey et al., 2000; Ives, 2005, Singh& Singh, 2002; Jaafari, 2003). In particular, we need to discuss new perspectives and concepts for an advanced level of project management education that may help develop the abilities necessary to confidently navigate the dynamic organizational environments and complex projects facing project managers today. In this paper, we first describe the evolution of project management and project management education. Next, we discuss the impact of taking complexity seriously on the requirements for professional development of project managers. Finally, we examine opportunities for distance based education in project management to meet these needs. Academic & Professional Development Fund (A&PDF...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the research and}} development of procedures for the preparation of regional geochemical maps of Great Britain. The maps are produced at the 1 : 250, 000 scale and represent the distribution of approximately twenty elements of economic or environmental significance. They are based on the analysis of drainage samples but the application of alternative sample types to regional geochemical mapping in Great Britain is briefly discussed. The first part of the study describes an orientation study carried out in the northern Highlands of Scotland. The area was selected since it presents the most difficult problems for sampling while the natural variation in heavy metal concentration can be assessed as a basis for evaluating pollution in industrialized areas. Investigation of sampling and sample preparation methods indicates that - 100 BSI mesh (150 um) material is the optimum size fraction for the regional survey (it provides adequate geochemical contrast; it includes all the size fractions in which metals are enriched; and it is available in amounts which are adequate for all analyses required). Grinding samples improves precision and reduces the preferential volatilization of metals co-precipitated with hydrous manganese and iron oxides when optical emission spectroscopic analysis is used. A study of the dispersion of metals in the drainage system of an area of Pb-Ba-Mo mineralization and an area of U-Pb mineralization respectively indicates that a sampling interval of 1 per 2 km 2 based on second or third order streams is adequate to define anomalous metal concentrations and regional variation is represented on the same interval. Modifications to the sampling procedure to reduce the effects of the <b>secondary</b> <b>environment</b> are complicated by the primary association of Mn and Fe with mineralization. The ratio of analytical and sampling error for regional variance shows that procedural precision is adequate to prepare regional geochemical maps with the exception of zirconium and zinc at low concentrations. The second part of the thesis {{describes the}} procedures developed for the systematic determination of accuracy and precision in the data for the geochemical maps. Changes in accuracy are monitored by analysis of standards and the re-determination of sub-sets of samples using a neutron activation method. Samples are assigned random numbers in the field and are reordered sequentially prior to preparation and analysis in order to determine systematic errors within batches of samples. Sampling, sub-sampling and analytical precision are monitored using analysis of variance methods on the results obtained on duplicate samples and analyses. The system for the efficient processing of this information is described and examples of the different types of error presented. Finally the application of an accurate and precise instrumental neutron activation analytical method to the geochemical mapping programme is described. The method provides a reference analytical procedure for orientation, error control and follow-up. The concentration of several metals not readily amenable to standard multi-element methods such as Au, W, Se, Sb, As, Hf, Cd, Cs and several REE can also be determined by the method. Conclusions are made with particular reference to the geochemical maps for Mo and U in Sutherland and Caithness, Scotland...|$|E

In order to introduce the effects of ‘modern’ society and era to children, we have to use appropriate and qualitative methods of presenting information throughout the whole teaching process, especially in Physical Education. In the process of physical education pupils develop their movement skills. We have to start building an appropriate attitude towards sport activities in pupils, starting very early, in pre-school period in order to engage them in sports in their later lives. If our aim is to make exercising an important personal value of people, we have to build a positive attitude towards it in children. Parents and the primary environment play a significant role here, since {{it is very important that}} exercising and active free time start in the child’s family. In the child’s <b>secondary</b> <b>environment,</b> that is school, the teachers are the ones who influence the individuals the most, especially in Physical Education, that is why they have to offer them as many sport activities as possible during the lessons as well as in other out-of-school activities. Therefore, sports education should start at a very early age. On account of the influences of modern society and technology we decided to investigate and focus on Physical Education and the teacher’s sports activity in this research, since the teacher is the one who can offer sports to children and make them integrate sports as an important part of their everyday lives. In addition, the teacher is the one who can plan and execute qualitative Physical Education lessons. The subjects of our research were: •	the present situation in Physical Education through separate quality indicators (lesson planning and execution, teaching methods and forms, checking and evaluation, student motivation, individualisation and differentiation, constant teacher professional development and training, inclusion in school as well as out-of-school activities, work conditions and satisfaction with one’s own work, frequency of sport activities, types of sport activities, participating in sport activities in one’s free time); •	differences according to separate criteria (lesson planning and execution, teaching methods and forms, checking and evaluation, student motivation, individualisation and differentiation, constant teacher professional development and training) for Physical Education quality as regards the teachers’ age, education, work experience and title; •	differences in the frequency and ways of engaging in sports according to the teachers’ age •	types of sports activities that teachers engage in; •	does the teacher’s own sport activity have a positive influence on teaching Physical Education. In presented Master’s Thesis there are a theoretical part and an empirical part. The first part describes facts and research results in the sports field, sports education and engaging in sports. The second part introduces the results of a basic statistic analysis questionnaire in the first part and results of a questionnaire of performed statistically important differences in the second part. The analysis of the present situation indicates that the teachers usually develop schemes of work and lesson plans in line with curriculum objectives of Physical Education. However, they also tend to cooperate with their fellow colleagues, the class teachers. The most commonly used teaching method is direct demonstration; most common teaching forms are circuit training, all-round exercising, obstacle courses and relay races. When forming a learner’s grade, teachers usually consider the progress the learner makes, their effort, cooperation during the lessons and their gained knowledge. The teachers’ most important components of motivation are stimulative words and setting realistic aims, as well as praising the learners for their achievements. When considering differentiation and individualisation, teachers most commonly talk about helping learners when they feel that they are falling behind and paying attention to all learners equally. Teachers rarely take part in permanent professional development seminars. They usually get involved in school activities at professional work group meetings and at Physical Fitness Report testing. Teachers never receive their own personal sport equipment (52, 6...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{emotional}} and social needs of integrated disabled pupils in the <b>secondary</b> school <b>environment.</b> The authors {{focused on the}} perception of emotional and social needs of pupils with physical disabilities who were individually integrated into a standard secondary school five {{years ago at the}} latest. The aim of the research was to determine how graduates with physical disabilities reflect on their emotional and social needs and their fulfillment in the <b>secondary</b> school <b>environment.</b> Its purpose was also to reveal how the participants describe their position within the school class. With regard to the research objectives, the authors decided for a qualitative research strategy using semi-structured interviews and an interpretative phenomenological analysis. The results showed that the emotions of the informants are mainly determined by their insufficiently fulfilled social needs. The graduates intensely experienced distrust of their classmates, but also a certain initial reluctance of the teachers to accept their specific needs. This stemmed from the lack of interpersonal communication and cooperation and the lack of shared experiences in the school environment. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
