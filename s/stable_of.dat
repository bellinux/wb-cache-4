5|$|Twenty-nine radioisotopes {{have also}} been synthesized, ranging in atomic mass from 138 to 173. The most <b>stable</b> <b>of</b> these is 154Dy, with a {{half-life}} of approximately 3years, followed by 159Dy with a half-life of 144.4days. The least stable is 138Dy, with a half-life of 200ms. As a general rule, isotopes that are lighter than the stable isotopes tend to decay primarily by β+ decay, while those that are heavier tend to decay by β− decay. However, 154Dy decays primarily by alpha decay, and 152Dy and 159Dy decay primarily by electron capture. Dysprosium also has at least 11 metastable isomers, ranging in atomic mass from 140 to 165. The most <b>stable</b> <b>of</b> these is 165mDy, which has a half-life of 1.257minutes. 149Dy has two metastable isomers, the second of which, 149m2Dy, has a half-life of 28ns.|$|E

5|$|All other cerium {{isotopes}} are synthetic and radioactive. The most <b>stable</b> <b>of</b> {{them are}} 144Ce with a half-life of 284.9days, 139Ce with a half-life of 137.6days, 143Ce with a half-life of 33.04days, and 141Ce with a half-life of 32.5days. All other radioactive cerium isotopes have half-lives under four days, {{and most of}} them have half-lives under ten minutes. The isotopes between 140Ce and 144Ce inclusive occur as fission products of uranium. The primary decay mode of the isotopes lighter than 140Ce is inverse beta decay or electron capture to isotopes of lanthanum, while that of the heavier isotopes is beta decay to isotopes of praseodymium.|$|E
5|$|Another 30 {{artificial}} radioisotopes {{of tungsten}} have been characterized, the most <b>stable</b> <b>of</b> which are 181W with a half-life of 121.2days, 185W with a half-life of 75.1days, 188W with a half-life of 69.4days, 178W with a half-life of 21.6days, and 187W with a half-life of 23.72 h. All {{of the remaining}} radioactive isotopes have half-lives of less than 3hours, {{and most of these}} have half-lives below 8minutes. Tungsten also has 4meta states, the most stable being 179mW (t1/2 6.4minutes).|$|E
5|$|At least 25 {{nuclear isomers}} have been described, ranging in atomic mass from 84 to 104. Within this range, only 96Nb, 101Nb, and 103Nb {{do not have}} isomers.

5|$|At least 32 {{metastable}} isomers {{have been}} characterized, ranging in mass number from 164 to 197. The most <b>stable</b> <b>of</b> these is 192m2Ir, which decays by isomeric transition with a half-life of 241years, {{making it more}} stable than any of iridium's synthetic isotopes in their ground states. The least stable isomer is 190m3Ir with a half-life of only 2µs. The isotope 191Ir {{was the first one}} of any element to be shown to present a Mössbauer effect. This renders it useful for Mössbauer spectroscopy for research in physics, chemistry, biochemistry, metallurgy, and mineralogy.|$|E
5|$|At least 32 {{synthetic}} isotopes of yttrium {{have been}} observed, and these range in atomic mass number from 76 to 108.

Apart from the isotopes 91Y, 87Y, and 90Y, with half-lives of 58.51days, 79.8hours, and 64hours, respectively, all the other isotopes have half-lives of {{less than a day}} and most of less than an hour.|$|E

Without the radio revenues that supported mighty NBC and CBS, DuMont programmers relied on their wits and on connections with Broadway.

On the November 3 episode of Raw, DiBiase was {{attacked}} by Orton, after he interfered in Orton's match. This storyline attack was to allow DiBiase to be written out of WWE storylines, so he could film the direct-to-video movie, The Marine 2.|$|E
5|$|Lisa Mary Moretti (born November 26, 1961) is an American retired {{professional}} wrestler. She is {{best known}} for her time with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE, previously the World Wrestling Federation) between 1999 and 2005 under the ring name Ivory. Moretti began her career and first found national exposure in the independent promotion Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling (GLOW), where she performed as Tina Ferrari from the mid-to-late-1980s. Moretti debuted in the World Wrestling Federation in 1999 as the manager for D'Lo Brown & Mark Henry. She won the WWE Women's Championship twice, before becoming a part of the villainous Right to Censor, a storyline <b>stable</b> <b>of</b> characters with harshly conservative sociopolitical views.|$|E

Schyster {{was one of the}} first wrestlers to join the group and remained in the stable until leaving the WWF in 1995. In 1996, DiBiase and Rotunda (the latter as V.K.

5|$|Niobium in the Earth's crust {{comprises}} one stable isotope, 93Nb. By 2003, {{at least}} 32 radioisotopes had been synthesized, ranging in atomic mass from 81 to 113. The most <b>stable</b> <b>of</b> these is 92Nb with a half-life of 34.7million years. One {{of the least}} stable is 113Nb, with an estimated half-life of 30milliseconds. Isotopes that are lighter than the stable 93Nb tend to decay by β+ decay, {{and those that are}} heavier tend to decay by β− decay, with some exceptions. 81Nb, 82Nb, and 84Nb have minor β+ delayed proton emission decay paths, 91Nb decays by electron capture and positron emission, and 92Nb decays by both β+ and β− decay.|$|E
5|$|Seaborgium should form a very {{volatile}} hexafluoride (SgF6) {{as well as}} {{a moderately}} volatile hexachloride (SgCl6), pentachloride (SgCl5), and oxychlorides SgO2Cl2 and SgOCl4.

5|$|The element {{also has}} 18 nuclear isomers, with mass numbers of 133 to 142, 144, 148, 149, 152, and 154 (some mass numbers {{have more than}} one isomer).
