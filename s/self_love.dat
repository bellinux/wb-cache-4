6000|$|Sept. 16.--Upon quietly {{reviewing}} past times, and {{the degree}} of [...] confidence which Sir Robert Peel had for years, habitually I may [...] say, reposed in me, and especially considering its climax, in my [...] being summoned to the meetings immediately preceding the debate on [...] the address in August, I am inclined to think, after allowing for [...] the delusions of <b>self</b> <b>love,</b> {{that there is not a}} perfect [...] correspondence between the tenor of the past on the one hand, and [...] my present appointment and the relations in which it places me to [...] the administration on the other. He may have made up his mind at [...] those meetings that I was not qualified for the consultations of a [...] government, nor would there be anything strange in this, except the [...] supposition that he had not seen it before. Having however taken [...] the alarm (so to speak) upon the invitation at that time, and been [...] impressed with the idea that it savoured of cabinet office, I [...] considered and consulted on the Chinese question, which I regarded [...] as a serious impediment to office of that description, and I had [...] provisionally contemplated saying to Peel in case he should offer [...] me Ireland with the cabinet, to reply that I would gladly serve his [...] government in the secretaryship, but that I feared his Chinese [...] measures would hardly admit of my acting in the cabinet. I am very [...] sorry now to think that I may have been guilty of an altogether [...] absurd presumption, in dreaming of the cabinet. But it was wholly [...] suggested by that invitation. And I still think that there must [...] have been some consultation and decision relating to me in the [...] interval between the meetings and the formation of the new [...] ministry, which produced some alteration.... In confirmation of the [...] notion I have recorded above, I am distinct in the recollection [...] that there was a shyness in Peel's manner and a downward eye, when [...] he opened the conversation and made the offer, not usual with him [...] in speaking to me.|$|E
6000|$|He was glorious {{from his}} youth. Every one loved him; no shadow of envy or hate cast {{even from the}} meanest mind ever fell upon him. He was, as one the {{peculiar}} delight of the Gods, railed and fenced in by his own divinity, so that nought but love and admiration could approach him. His heart was simple like a child, unstained by arrogance or vanity. He mingled in society unknowing of his superiority over his companions, not because he undervalued himself but {{because he did not}} perceive the inferiority of others. He seemed incapable of conceiving of {{the full extent of the}} power that selfishness & vice possesses in the world: when I knew him, although he had suffered disappointment in his dearest hopes, he had not experienced any that arose from the meaness and <b>self</b> <b>love</b> of men: his station was too high to allow of his suffering through their hardheartedness; and too low for him to have experienced ingratitude and encroaching selfishness: it is one of the blessings of a moderate fortune, that by preventing the possessor from confering pecuniary favours it prevents him also from diving into the arcana of human weakness or malice--To bestow on your fellow men is a Godlike attribute--So indeed it is and as such not one fit for mortality;--the giver like Adam and Prometheus, must pay the penalty of rising above his nature by being the martyr to his own excellence. Woodville was free from all these evils; and if slight examples did come across him[52] he did not notice them but passed on in his course as an angel with winged feet might glide along the earth unimpeded by all those little obstacles over which we of earthly origin stumble. He was a believer in the divinity of genius and always opposed a stern disbelief to the objections of those petty cavillers and minor critics who wish to reduce all men to their own miserable level--"I will make a scientific simile" [...] he would say, [...] "[i]n the manner, if you will, of Dr. Darwin--I consider the alledged errors of a man of genius as the aberrations of the fixed stars. It is our distance from them and our imperfect means of communication that makes them appear to move; in truth they always remain stationary, a glorious centre, giving us a fine lesson of modesty if we would thus receive it."[53] ...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a {{study of}} the first three plays that Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote for the operatic stage: Iphis and La Decouverte du nouveau monde, both examples of the genre tragedie lyrique, and Les Muses galantes, an opera-ballet. Semiotic and poetic analyses bring to light striking resemblances between the dramatic situations depicted in the operas and the personal drama of the young Rousseau in love. As a whole, the operas reveal two distinct portraits of the <b>self</b> in <b>love.</b> The first, painted in colours of passion, reveals a self implicated in triangular relationships that are resolved through the abnegation of desire; the second, brushed in shades of contentment, devotion, and fidelity, celebrate the delights of requited love. These two portraits are studied in the light of Rousseau's principal writings in order to demonstrate how the early operatic works reflect true images of an ever evolving <b>self</b> in <b>love...</b>|$|R
