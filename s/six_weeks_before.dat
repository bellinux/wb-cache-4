5|$|Theobald {{was present}} at Stephen's deathbed in October 1154, and Stephen named him as regent until Henry could take up the crown.

After Henry's arrival, Theobald crowned Henry and his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine on 19 December 1154 at Westminster Abbey.|$|E
5|$|American {{analysts were}} elated when they {{discovered}} {{that the number of}} trucks ordered by North Vietnam from its communist allies in late 1971 exceeded those of previous years. 6,000 vehicles had been ordered from the Soviet Union alone (as opposed to the usual 3,000) and this seemed to indicate that the enemy was hurting for transportation and that the campaign was working. However, since 80 percent of the vehicles arrived in North Vietnam at least <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> the launching of the Nguyen Hue Offensive (known to the U.S. as the Easter Offensive, they probably reflected anticipated losses.|$|E

50|$|Le métèque is a French chanson by Georges Moustaki (1934 - 2013). He {{wrote it}} in 1969, {{and it was}} his first {{breakthrough}} hit, reaching number one in the French charts for <b>six</b> non-consecutive <b>weeks.</b> <b>Before</b> he had written for singers like Edith Piaf (Milord).|$|R

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the pre-production phase, Carter and Bowman were busy with the television series, leaving Sackheim to work alone. Sackheim hired executive producer Lata Ryan, who had previously collaborated with Steven Spielberg for his 1993 film, Jurassic Park. Once hired, Ryan was allowed to read the script in front of the Ten Thirteen Productions staff members—but not to take it away. At this time, most of the staff members had not read the script for themselves. After Ryan accepted the offer of becoming executive producer, Chris Nowak was hired as production designer, Ward Russell as director of photography and Bill Liams as construction coordinator. According to Ryan, they had secured all key personnel <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> principal filming began.|$|E

5|$|Fingleton then scored his maiden {{first-class}} {{century of}} 117 {{in less than}} four hours in the following match, against the touring South Africa, helping his team to 3/430 in their runchase. The hosts were 18 runs short of victory when time ran out. Although Fingleton made only five in New South Wales' second match against the South Africans, Fingleton was selected for the Test series against the same team. This came after only ten matches for his state. Starting with the Second Test, he was twelfth man for three consecutive Tests, and as a result, did not play any cricket for <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> he added a pair of 40s in a win over arch-rivals Victoria.|$|E
5|$|However, {{following}} Manchester United's first league {{title in}} 1908 and the FA Cup a year later, {{it was decided}} that Bank Street was too restrictive for Davies' ambition; in February 1909, <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> the club's first FA Cup title, Old Trafford was named as the home of Manchester United, following the purchase of land for around £60,000. Architect Archibald Leitch was given a budget of £30,000 for construction; original plans called for seating capacity of 100,000, though budget constraints forced a revision to 77,000. The building was constructed by Messrs Brameld and Smith of Manchester. The stadium's record attendance was registered on 25 March 1939, when an FA Cup semi-final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town drew 76,962spectators.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1830, Yancey was {{enrolled}} at Williams College in northwestern Massachusetts. The 16-year-old Yancey was admitted as a sophomore based on the required entrance examinations. At Williams, he participated in the debating society and {{for a short time}} was the editor of a student newspaper. In the autumn of 1832, Yancey took his first steps as a politician by working on the campaign for Whig Ebenezer Emmons. Overall, Yancey had a successful stay at Williams academically that was marred only by frequent disciplinary problems. Despite being selected as the Senior Orator by his class, Yancey left the school in the spring of 1833, <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> graduation.|$|E
50|$|Small poultry farmers whose {{operations}} {{are not of}} sufficient size to warrant hiring a chicken sexer must wait until the hatchlings are four to <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> old <b>before</b> learning the sexes of their chickens.

5|$|Laying of {{the track}} was {{performed}} by Wiebe, signaling was installed by Norsk Jernbanedrift, Structon Rail installed the overhead wire, and YIT installed the power supply and telecommunications systems. The tunnel has the NSI-63 relay-based signaling system, although it {{was scheduled to be}} replaced by European Rail Traffic Management System shortly after 2015. The last <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> opening, the Vestfold Line was closed to allow the new and old sections to be connected. This was the most hectic part of construction, as it saw the tracks south of the tunnel be rearranged to allow trains to operate the opposite direction through the loop in Tønsberg. The work was performed by Reinertsen and took 100,000 man-hours.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} June 6, 2005.

Post-production was completed four days before its screening on nine screens at the Sundance Film Festival, where it had its premiere. The film was dedicated to Rebecca Annitto, the niece of producer Peter Saraf and an extra in scenes set in the diner and the convenience store, who was {{killed in a car accident}} on September 14, 2005.|$|E
5|$|Without {{ultrasound}} {{or other}} special tools, determining if a sheep is pregnant is difficult. Ewes only begin to visibly show a pregnancy about <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> giving birth, so shepherds often {{rely on the}} assumption that a ram will impregnate all the ewes in a flock. However, by fitting a ram with a chest harness called a marking harness that holds a special crayon (or raddle, sometimes spelled reddle), ewes that have been mounted are marked with a color. Dye may also be directly applied to the ram's brisket. This measure is not used in flocks where wool is important, since the color of a raddle contaminates it.|$|E
50|$|The Lenten {{period of}} the liturgical calendar, the <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> {{directly}} <b>before</b> Easter, was historically marked by fasting, study, and other pious or penitential practices. During Lent, no parties or celebrations were held, and people refrained from eating rich foods, such as meat, dairy, fat, and sugar. The first three classes were often totally unavailable during this period because of late winter shortages.|$|R

What a naughty little Susie, to want to throw any of her <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> away! ...|$|R
5|$|Harvey {{started the}} 195152 season poorly, scoring 9 and 5 against a full-strength New South Wales team. In the {{following}} match, he made 90 {{in the first}} innings as Queensland defeated the touring West Indies by ten wickets. Harvey was sidelined for <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> returning in late December against Victoria. He struggled in this match and the next against New South Wales, scoring 9, 20, 9 and 3. In the next match, he made 46 in the first innings before managing only five in the second, against South Australia. Nor did Queensland have success in these three matches. They were one wicket away from victory in the first match when time ran out, and lost the other two. Harvey was dropped {{for the remainder of}} the season, ending with 196 runs at 21.77.|$|E
5|$|In January 2010, due {{to strong}} digital sales, the song charted in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, debuting at numbers 85, 45, and 112 respectively. In the United States, the song re-entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number 92 {{on the issue}} date of August 7, 2010. The song {{steadily}} ascended the charts for <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> eventually reaching a peak of eight on its eighth week on the chart.

In September 2010, the song received platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of 1,000,000 units. With this feat Kesha became the second lead artist, following Lady Gaga, to achieve four million selling songs in 2010. The song later crossed the two million paid downloads mark in February 2011, becoming her fifth song to do so. As of June 2011, the song has sold 2,134,000 copies in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Lights and Sounds debuted {{at number}} five on the Billboard 200 and Top Internet Albums' charts, and sold over 95,000 copies {{in its first}} week of release. Since June 2006, Lights and Sounds has sold over 315,000 copies in the United States. The album did not exceed the {{expectations}} of Ocean Avenue, which approached 2million in record sales. Internationally, Lights and Sounds peaked at number four on the Canadian Top Album Chart, making it Yellowcard's highest debut in Canada.

5|$|Lord Guildford Dudley (also spelt Guilford) (c.1535 – 12 February 1554) was {{the husband}} of Lady Jane Grey who, {{declared}} as his heir by King Edward VI, occupied the English throne from 10July until 19July 1553. Guildford Dudley enjoyed a humanist education and was married to Jane in a magnificent celebration about <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> the King's death. After Guildford's father, the Duke of Northumberland, had engineered Jane's accession, Jane and Guildford spent her brief rule residing in the Tower of London. They {{were still in the}} Tower when their regime collapsed and they remained there, in different quarters, as prisoners. They were condemned to death for high treason in November 1553. Queen Mary I was inclined to spare their lives, but Thomas Wyatt's rebellion against her plans to marry Philip of Spain led to the young couple's execution, a measure that was widely seen as unduly harsh.|$|E
5|$|O'Brien {{completed}} a hat-trick of breaststroke doubles at the 1965 Australian Championships, {{but in a}} year with no international competition, he swam much slower times of 1min 11.1s and 2min 38.6s respectively. He {{completed a}} fourth consecutive medley relay win with New South Wales. At the 1966 Australian Championships, his times were again slower, at 1min 11.8s and 2min 41.6s respectively, more than 4% slower than his personal bests, {{but it was still}} enough to retain his titles and qualify for the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Kingston, Jamaica. Critics had written him off, because just <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> the competition, he was 16kg overweight. However, he returned to his peak form by the time the team reached Jamaica, where he won both breaststroke events with times of 1min 8.2s and 2min 29.3s respectively. His winning run in the 4100m medley relay came to an end when the Australians were disqualified for an illegal changeover.|$|E
5|$|The German–Yugoslav Partisan {{negotiations}} were held between German {{commanders in the}} Independent State of Croatia and the Supreme Headquarters of the Yugoslav Partisans in March 1943 during World War II. The negotiations – focused on obtaining a ceasefire and establishing a prisoner exchange – were conducted during the Axis Case White offensive. They were used by the Partisans to delay the Axis forces while the Partisans crossed the Neretva river, and to allow the Partisans to focus on attacking their Chetnik rivals led by Draža Mihailović. The {{negotiations were}} accompanied by an informal ceasefire that lasted about <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> being called off on orders from Adolf Hitler. The short-term advantage gained by the Partisans through the negotiations was lost when the Axis Case Black offensive was launched in mid-May 1943. Prisoner exchanges, which had been occurring between the Germans and Partisans for some months prior, re-commenced in late 1943 and continued {{until the end of}} the war.|$|E
