50|$|Selecting {{a nozzle}} {{based on the}} pattern and other spray {{characteristics}} that are required generally yields good results. Since spray nozzles are designed to perform under many different <b>spraying</b> <b>conditions,</b> more than one nozzle may meet the requirements for a given application. Surfaces may be sprayed with any pattern shape. Results are fairly predictable, {{depending on the type}} of spray pattern specified. If the surface is stationary, the preferred nozzle is usually some type of full cone nozzle, since its pattern will cover a larger area than the other styles. Spatial applications, in which the objective is not primarily to spray onto a surface, are more likely to require specialized spray characteristics. Success in these applications is often completely dependent on factors such as drop size and spray velocity. Evaporation, cooling rates for gases and solids, and cleaning efficiency are examples of process characteristics that may depend largely on spray qualities.|$|E

Using identical starting powders, coatings that were produced using two distinctly different <b>spray</b> <b>conditions</b> exhibited significant differences in both microstructure and strength.

To increase the efficiency and lifetime of gas turbines, the integration of MoSi 2 as a healing material was proposed. A new method of manufacture was explored in order to enable the spraying of a homogeneous mixed layer of YSZ and MoSi 2. As the chemical and physical properties of these powders are very different, they require contrasting process conditions.

40|$|Among {{bioactive}} ceramics, hydroxyapatite (HAp) {{has been}} widely studied, especially as a coating onto metallic substrates. In clinical applications,coating delamination has been observed, close to the interface between coating and substrate. This {{is due to a}} mismatch in the thermal expansioncoefficients of HAp and titanium/titanium alloy. In order to improve the adhesion, a proper bond coat may be introduced. In this work, a functionallygraded coating TiO 2 –HAp, in which the composition gradually changed from TiO 2 to HAp, was deposited onto Ti 6 Al 4 V substrates by atmosphericplasma spraying (APS). With the aim of defining the best spraying parameters to obtain the graded system, preliminary coatings of pure TiO 2 andpure HAp were deposited by varying systematically the typical <b>spraying</b> <b>conditions,</b> such as the torch power and H 2 flux.

To solve these problems, pH-sensitive Ca-alginate microparticles designed as an oral administration carrier were prepared by a spray-solidification method in this study. The <b>spray</b> <b>conditions</b> influenced the size of the Ca-alginate micropartides; thus, conditions were optimized to obtain microparticles with smaller particle size for oral administration to mice.

The results showed that LLEP could be well protected against simulated gastric fluid and that the final activity retention was up to 92. 9 %. The effects of alginate concentration on the release profile in vitro and the encapsulation efficiency (EE) were studied, and the results revealed that the microparticles possessed the highest EE and a reasonable release rate when the alginate concentration was 1. 0 wt %.
