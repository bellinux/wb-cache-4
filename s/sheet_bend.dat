5|$|Pathfinder : This is {{the first}} real {{advancement}} badge. It focuses on basic Scout training, including the six basic knots (Reef Knot, Bowline, <b>Sheet</b> <b>bend,</b> Sheepshank, Figure-of-eight, and Clove hitch), basic first aid (treatment of open wounds and bleeding), and introduces Scouts to camping. The badge encourages a Scout to participate in patrol activities. The Scout is required to have camped away from their normal Scout meeting place {{for at least five}} nights.|$|E

40|$|The {{hardness}} is {{a resistance}} {{for the local}} plastic deformation producing the stress field itself. The hardness number, therefore, is affected by applied or residual stresses. In order to clarify the influences of residual stresses on the hardness numbers quantitatively, shot peening and <b>sheet</b> <b>bending</b> were performed for a medium carbon steel (C: 0. 45 %). Hardness and residual stress measurements were made using a micro-Vickers hardness tester and a X-ray diffractometer respectively. The following results are obtained; (1) Hardness numbers increase in the compressive stress field induced by shot peening. (2) The maximum hardness increment was 13 HV in the compressive stress field. (3) The influences of compressive residual stresses induced by shot peening on the hardness number {{are similar to the}} case of <b>sheet</b> <b>bending.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{seeks to}} carry out design of a small scale {{electrically}} powered bending machine for a developing nation, case for Zimbabwe. The bending of metal is of great importance {{in the manufacture of}} products such as nut shelling machines and maize shelling machines. Currently being used at Company X engineering is a manual bending machine with a single operation hence this design will help {{to increase the number of}} metals being bent, an increase in the efficiency and production. The paper deals with manufacturing or <b>bending</b> of <b>sheet</b> metal by using power operated <b>sheet</b> <b>bending</b> machine. Especially discussion made the productivity analysis of manually or power operated <b>sheet</b> <b>bending</b> machine. Considering manual operation is replaced by power operated devices. It also gives information about limitation of manually operated <b>sheet</b> <b>bending</b> machine and power operated <b>sheet</b> <b>bending</b> machine. The existing machines are limited to a single operation. The aim of the research is to increase the number of bent parts and to place an adjustable table to suit the height of the user thereby reducing back pain internal injuries in the long run. The researchers visited the Company X to gather information concerning the problems faced by the employees. Material tests which are of great value were carried out and the use of software. A Plate Rolling Machine is a machine that will roll different kinds of metal sheet into a round or conical shape and a rod bending machine will roll or bend different kinds of metal sheet into right angles or circular shapes. The research aims at making it possible to do the operations on a single machine. We recommend the machine to be automated and the use of a servo motor to reduce human injuries at the workshop. Use of oils and maintenance is of great value to increase the life span of the machine...|$|R

[...] Even with these, it was always a bottom performer and the double <b>sheet</b> <b>bend</b> did little better. The butterfly bend did best, but the double fisherman's knot was recommended for being easier to untie.|$|E

40|$|The <b>bending</b> of cell <b>sheets</b> plays a {{major role}} in {{multicellular}} embryonic morphogenesis. Recent advances are leading to a deeper understanding of how the biophysical properties and the forceproducing behaviors of cells are regulated, and how these forces are integrated across cell <b>sheets</b> during <b>bending.</b> We review work that shows that the dynamic balance of apical versus basolateral cortical tension controls specific aspects of invagination of epithelial sheets, and recent evidence that tissue expansion by growth contributes to neural retinal invagination in a stem cell-derived, self-organizing system. Of special interest is the detailed analysis of the type B inversion in Volvox reported in BMC Biology by Höhn and Hallmann, as this is a system that promises to be particularly instructive in understanding morphogenesis of any monolayered spheroid system. Commentary Cell <b>sheet</b> <b>bending</b> is an active process, required for normal morphogenesis in many instances of multicellular embryogenesis, including the formation of the germ layers during gastrulation, the gut and neural tube, the eye, the otic system and the diverticula of the gut. A number of mechanisms have been proposed for cell <b>sheet</b> <b>bending,</b> including growth pressure, cell shape changes driven by cell-cell or cell-matrix adhesion, or by the cytoskeleton, for example, each with varying levels of experimental support. Recent combinations of live imaging, molecular interdictions, biophysical analysis, and computational modeling are providing a much better understanding of the key biomechanical processes underlying how cells generate forces, how local forces are integrated over large cell sheets, and how morphogenic function depends on geometric and biomechanical context...|$|R

On the basis of analysis and experiment, two different forming operations are studied in order to evaluate the practical relevance of ductile failure curves. These processes are <b>sheet</b> <b>bending</b> and backward can extrusion. As an illustrative material, recycled aluminium of moderate ductility is used.

The as-rolled specimens present a negative sensitivity, i. e., the bending angle decreases as the strain rate increases; however, the annealed specimens show a positive sensitivity, i. e., the bending angle increases as the strain rate increases. Such an inverse strain rate sensitivity of <b>sheet</b> <b>bending</b> may significantly impact the sheet forming of Mg alloys...|$|R
