2500|$|Boric acid {{was first}} {{registered}} in the US as an insecticide in 1948 for control of cockroaches, termites, fire ants, fleas, silverfish, and many other insects. The product is {{generally considered to be}} safe to use in household kitchens to control cockroaches and ants. It acts as a <b>stomach</b> <b>poison</b> affecting the insects' metabolism, and the dry powder is abrasive to the insects' exoskeletons. Boric acid also has the reputation as [...] "the gift that keeps on killing" [...] in that roaches that cross over lightly dusted areas do not die immediately, but that the effect is like shards of glass cutting them apart. This often allows a roach {{to go back to the}} nest where it soon dies. Cockroaches, being cannibalistic, eat others killed by contact or consumption of boric acid, consuming the powder trapped in the dead roach and killing them, too.|$|E

50|$|Chemical {{pesticides}} are contact <b>poisons</b> and <b>stomach</b> <b>poisons.</b> The {{timing of}} application is less critical {{than that of}} microbials and biologicals. Chemical pesticides can affect non-target organisms and may be hazardous to human health.|$|R
50|$|A {{larvicide}} (alternatively larvacide) is an insecticide that {{is specifically}} targeted against the larval life stage of an insect. Their most common use is against mosquitoes. Larvicides may be contact <b>poisons,</b> <b>stomach</b> <b>poisons,</b> growth regulators, or (increasingly) biological control agents.|$|R
50|$|Control of larvae can be {{accomplished}} through use of contact poisons, growth regulators, surface films, <b>stomach</b> <b>poisons</b> (including bacterial agents), and biological agents such as fungi, nematodes, copepods, and fish. A chemical commonly used in the United States is methoprene, considered slightly toxic to larger animals, which mimics and interferes with natural growth hormones in mosquito larvae, preventing development. Methoprene is frequently distributed in time-release briquette form in breeding areas.|$|R
5000|$|Sodium {{fluoride}} {{is used as}} {{a cleaning}} agent (e.g., as a [...] "laundry sour"). Sodium fluoride {{is used as a}} <b>stomach</b> <b>poison</b> for plant-feeding insects. Inorganic fluorides such as fluorosilicates and sodium fluoride complex magnesium ions as magnesium fluorophosphate. They inhibit enzymes such as enolase that require Mg2+ as a prosthetic group. Thus, fluoride poisoning prevents phosphate transfer in oxidative metabolism.|$|E
50|$|Hydramethylnon kills insects by disrupting energy {{production}} in their cells. Hydramethylnon is a slow-acting <b>stomach</b> <b>poison</b> (delayed toxicity) {{that does not}} need to be eaten to be effective. It is toxic to cockroaches both by topical application and by ingestion. Hydramethylnon residues are much less active against cockroaches by contact than by ingestion. A slow-acting poison is desirable, so they live long enough to return to the colony to share it with other cockroaches. In this way cockroaches that have eaten Hydramethylnon infect other cockroaches that have not had direct exposure to the baits. Hydramethylnon is known to cause cancer in rats, particularly uterine and adrenal tumours and lung cancer.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{effective}} against mushroom flies, aphids, spider mites, caterpillars, thrips, and whiteflies in greenhouse, outdoor fruit, and vegetable crops. It {{is also used}} in the milling and grain handling industries and to treat a variety of parasitic worm infections in dogs, livestock, and humans. It is fed to livestock to control bot fly larvae in the manure. It acts against insects as both a contact and a <b>stomach</b> <b>poison.</b> It is available as an aerosol and soluble concentrate. It is also used in pet collars and [...] "no-pest strips" [...] {{in the form of}} a pesticide-impregnated plastic; this material has been available to households since 1964 and has been the source of some concern, partly due to its misuse.|$|E
50|$|Attractive toxic sugar bait sprayed on {{vegetation}} {{has been}} successful in controlling Anopheles mosquitoes in outdoor environments. Additionally, indoor ATSB shows promise as a supplement to mosquito nets for controlling mosquitoes. Indoor ATSB constitute a novel application method for insecticide classes that act as <b>stomach</b> <b>poisons</b> and have not hitherto been exploited for mosquito control. Combined with long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), indoor use of ATSB has the potential to serve as a strategy for managing insecticide resistance. Mortality rates of indoor ATSB were comparable to LLINs previously tested against the same species in the same area.|$|R
40|$|Feeding of an "obligate" plant-parasitic {{nematode}} (nonfungal feeder), Pratylenchus scribneri, {{in the absence}} of plant tissue was demonstrated in an artificial system consisting of liquid media and indicator dyes including amaranth and various nontoxic food colors. Among the compounds tested, sucrose, dextrose, Gamborg's B 5 medium, and DL-methionine stimulated a small percentage of feeding (12 - 36 %). A high percentage of feeding (90 - 100 %) occurred in a filtrate from excised corn roots cultured in Gamborg's B 5 medium.

30|$|Termiticides can {{generally}} {{be characterized as}} (1) slow-acting, non-repellent <b>stomach</b> <b>poison</b> (e.g. naphthaloylhydroxylamine, sulfuramid) [22], (2) contact or cuticular toxin (e.g. fipronil) or (3) chitin synthetase inhibitor (e.g. hexaflumuron) that mimics insect hormones which regulate {{a wide array of}} physiological functions. Some examples include interfering with molting, pupal emergence or body wall formation. Little et al. [23] reported 100 % mortality to R. flavipes using the antioxidants butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), flavanone and propyl-gallate as surrogates for heartwood extractives. Fipronil is known to work by blocking the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-regulated chloride channel in neurons, thus disrupting the activity of the insect's central nervous system (i.e. neurotoxin) [24, 25]. Our results suggest that nano-ZnO behaves as a slow-acting, non-repellent <b>stomach</b> <b>poison.</b>|$|E
40|$|Helicoverpa armigera HÜbner {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} agricultural crop pests in the world causing heavy crop yield losses. The continued and indiscriminate use of synthetic insecticides in agriculture for their control has received wide public apprehension because of multifarious problems, including insecticide resistance, resurgence of pest species, environmental pollution, and toxic hazards to humans and nontarget organisms. These problems have necessitated the need to explore and develop alternative strategies using eco-friendly and biodegradable plant products. In view of this, the efficacy of Thevetia neriifolia methanol stem extract was evaluated against the early fourth instars of H. armigera as an antifeedant and <b>stomach</b> <b>poison</b> agent. Feeding of larvae with the diet containing 0. 005 %– 5. 0 % extract resulted in 2. 06 %– 37. 35 % antifeedant index; the diet with 5. 0 % extract caused 54. 3 % reduced consumption. The negative impact of extract on larval feeding resulted in 37. 5 %– 77. 7 % starvation, causing adverse effects on the larval weight. Choice between control and experimental diet resulted in feeding preference of larvae for the control diet, leading to 7. 3 %– 42. 9 % reduced consumption of extract-containing diet. The only exception was the diet with 0. 005 % extract, which could not cause any deterrence. The midgut histological architecture of H. armigera larvae fed with 0. 005 %– 0. 05 % extract-containing diet with negligible antifeedant potential showed significant damage, shrinkage, and distortion and vacuolization of gut tissues and peritrophic membrane, causing the disintegration of epithelial, goblet, and regenerative cells; the damage increased with the increase in concentration. These changes in the gut caused negative impact on the digestion and absorption of food and thus nutritional deficiency in the larvae, which could probably affect their growth and development. This study reveal the appreciable <b>stomach</b> <b>poison</b> potential of T. neriifolia stem methanol extract against H. armigera larvae, which can be explored as an eco-friendly pest control strategy...|$|E
5000|$|The abdomen {{contains}} the <b>stomachs,</b> <b>poison</b> glands, ovaries in the queen, and the Dufour's gland, among other things. Acromyrmex ants have two [...] "stomachs", including a dry, social stomach {{in which they}} can store food and later regurgitate to larvae, the queen and other ants. This is separated from the stomach proper by a small valve; once food enters the second stomach, it becomes contaminated with gastric juices and cannot be regurgitated. The exact function of the Dufour's gland is unknown, but is thought {{to be involved in the}} release of the chemicals used in the production of odour trails, which the ants use to recruit nest mates to a food source. It may also produce sex-attractant chemicals.|$|R

Three modes of exposures (1) direct contact application, (2) <b>stomach</b> <b>poisoning</b> activity (3) and inhalation toxicity activity, were tested. The results showed a potent contact and stomach toxicity on 1 st instars larvae regardless of the three crude extracts. But the plant extracts was less effective with older stages of the insects.

The device incorporates seemingly inexpensive (cost < 1 USD) olfactory and visual cues attractive to Aedes aegypti L. We incorporated 1 % boric acid in 10 % sucrose solution as toxic component on the devices and this showed to be effective killing female A. aegypti in controlled laboratory conditions (0 % survival probability after 48 h). In addition, we evaluated the biological action of the device and concluded that boric acid acts as a <b>stomach</b> <b>poison.</b> Using transmission electron microscopy we further determined that it disrupts {{the continuity of the}} epithelial tissue of the posterior midgut.

40|$|Abstract—The {{efficiency}} of wood vinegar mixed with each individual of three plants extract such as: citronella grass (Cymbopogon nardus), neem seed (Azadirachta indica A. Juss), and yam bean seed (Pachyrhizus erosus Urb.) were tested against the second instar larvae of housefly (Musca domestica L.). Steam distillation {{was used for}} extraction of the citronella grass while neem and yam bean were simple extracted by fermentation with ethyl alcohol. Toxicity test was evaluated in laboratory based on two methods of larvicidal bioassay: topical application method (contact poison) and feeding method (<b>stomach</b> <b>poison).</b> Larval mortality was observed daily and larval survivability was recorded until the survived larvae developed to pupae and adults. The study resulted that treatment of wood vinegar mixed with citronella grass showed the highest larval mortality by topical application method (50. 0 %) and by feeding method (80. 0 %). However, treatment of mixed wood vinegar and neem seed showed the longest pupal duration to 25 day and 32 days for topical application method and feeding method respectively. Additional, larval duration on treated M. domestica larvae was extended to 13 days for topical application method and 11 days for feeding method. Thus, the feeding method gave higher efficiency compared with the topical application method.

The most abundant were the ants 491 (77. 45 %), while the least were carpenter bees 10 (1. 43 %). Four species of ants – Camponotus maculatus Fab., C. vestitus Smith., Pheidole liengmei Forst and Pheidole sp. {{acting as a}} group or {{in conjunction with other}} wood-borers attacked and destroyed Azadirachta indica Juss, Albizia lebbeck (Linn.)

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{potential}} dietary effects of insecticidal substances on the predacious ladybird beetle, Coleomegilla maculata De Geer, a Tier- 1 laboratory testing system was developed. Artificial diets using shrimp eggs were developed, and a tier- 1 bioassay examining C. maculata development and survival was designed {{based on those}} diets. To further measure the artificial diet in a Tier- 1 testing system, larvae of C. maculata were fed the diet treated with different concentrations of an inorganic <b>stomach</b> <b>poison,</b> potassium arsenate (PA), or a cysteine protease inhibitor, E- 64. The results demonstrated that the testing system was capable of detecting the dietary effects of both substances on the survival and development of C. maculata. With increasing concentrations of PA in the diet, fewer larvae developed to adults, with only 22. 7 % larvae surviving to the adult stage in the treatment with the highest content of PA (32 μg/g of diet). Likewise, dose-dependent responses also were found for other life-table parameters of C. maculata. Similar to the assays with PA, the survival rates of C. maculata consistently decreased with increasing E- 64 content in the diet. Survival analysis showed that the insects fed E- 64 at 50, 150, and 450 μg/g in the diet had significantly lower survival rates compared with those on the untreated artificial diet.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} by greenhouse producers that adding sugar to a <b>stomach</b> <b>poison</b> insecticide enhances {{the efficacy of the}} insecticide in controlling western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis). As such, a series of laboratory, including no-choice and multiple-choice assays, and greenhouse experiments were conducted to determine if adding sugar-based compounds to insecticides enhances efficacy against western flower thrips. The sugar-based compounds evaluated were Mountain Dew, Diet Mountain Dew, white sugar, and brown sugar at two rates [initial (0. 18 mL/ 100 mL and 0. 12 g/ 100 mL) and high (0. 36 mL/ 100 mL and 0. 24 g/ 100 mL) ]. A water control was also included in all the assays. In the laboratory experiments, western flower thrips adults and nymphs were not attracted to any of the sugar-based compounds with < 60 s (out of 300 s total) spent in any of the treatments, and ≤ 29 s (out of 300 s total) spent in the treatments when the sugar-based compounds were mixed with three insecticides (tau-fluvalinate, pyridalyl, and spinosad). In the greenhouse experiments, the addition of the high rate of Mountain Dew (0. 36 mL/ 100 mL) and brown sugar (0. 24 g/ 100 mL) did not enhance the efficacy (based on percent mortality) of the insecticides against western flower thrips.

40|$|Origin {{and purpose}} of {{research}} Dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane or DDT as it is more commonly known, was first used extensively by the armed forces in the Pacific Area during World War II. This insecticide {{is not only a}} very toxic contact and <b>stomach</b> <b>poison,</b> but also is quite residual on most types of surfaces. Because of these qualities, it was selected to control the malaria mosquito and thus aided in the conquest of many disease-ridden islands of the Pacific. When DDT became available to the general public after the war, it was found not only to be effective against mosquitoes but also many other types of insects. Among these insects are the alfalfa weevil (Hypera postica hon.) and lygus bugs (Lygus elisus Van D., Lygus hesperus Knight) that had previously impaired the production of alfalfa in Utah and other areas. Although treatment of alfalfa fields is usually confined to alfalfa for seed production, DDT-dusted alfalfa straw and DDT dusted alfalfa hay are fed to farm livestock. In ruminant animals, microorganisms {{play an important role in}} the synthesis of protein from nitrogenous non-protein compounds and also aid in the break-down of many complex plant materials so that they may be more fully utilized by these animals. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of DDT upon the role played by the microflora and fauna of the rumen in the synthesis, digestion and utilization of certain nutrients by dairy calves. Scope Digestion and balance studies were conducted with Holstein bull calves fed different levels of DDT and protein equivalent in the ration. The experiment was designed so that each calf would receive one level of DDT throughout the experiment, and would receive a low protein basal diet plus three additional levels of protein equivalent. These additional protein levels were made up by adding a nitrogenous non-protein compound, urea, to the basal diet to give an increased level of protein equivalent in the diet. The nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus balance and the digestibility of dry matter, protein, and ether extract were determined...|$|E

40|$|Mosquito-borne {{pathogens}} {{are among}} the most important sources of human disease that cause morbidity and mortality worldwide. They include the viruses responsible for deadly outbreaks of yellow fever, Rift Valley fever, eastern equine encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis and dengue, and an assortment of other serious illnesses caused by the etiological agents of West Nile fever, St Louis encephalitis, Murray Valley encephalitis, Venezuelan equine encephalitis and chikungunya disease. Dengue viruses, of which there are 4 serotypes, cause an estimated 50 - 100 million new illnesses each year (and 25, 000 deaths) while the latest chikungunya epidemic has lasted longer, affected more people, and occurred over a wider geographic area than any previous outbreak of the disease. Yellow fever outbreaks continue to occur sporadically in South America and Africa when either vaccination or vector control are inadequate. These outbreaks have been controlled by creating barrier zones of vaccinated people and by increasing the intensity of vector control. The threat of devastating outbreaks of yellow fever remains, as illustrated by continuing quarantine and vaccination requirements for international travel. The most devastating of all mosquito-borne diseases is malaria, which kills an estimated 1 million people annually, while infecting another 500 million. Although public health efforts have been able to reduce or eliminate vector-borne pathogens in many situations, {{some parts of the world}} have actually suffered increases during the past 30 years. A number of agencies have responded to this problem with much increased levels of attention: World Health Organization, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, President’s Malaria Initiative, Institute Pasteur, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and US National Institutes of Health. However, morbidity and mortality due to mosquito-borne diseases is increasing. Today, mosquito wars are being fought around the globe and on many fronts. Insecticide-treated bed nets are mass-produced and distributed to the hardesthit malarious regions in Africa, India and southern Asia. Vaccines have been developed to protect humans and domestic animals against Yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, Rift Valley fever and eastern equine encephalitis, with intensive ongoing research targeting dengue, West Nile virus, and malaria vaccine development. New skin and clothing repellents for personal protection against all biting insects are being developed, and insecticide and related application technology development is in full swing. Of these, the key component for protecting humans from mosquito- borne illness is the use of effective insecticides that quickly kill millions of mosquitoes before they can pass their pathogens to sicken or kill humans. Mosquito adulticides and larvicides are a key component of our assault, along with indoor residual spraying and insecticide-treated bed nets. Unfortunately, mosquitoes are fighting back somewhat successfully by developing resistance to currently used mosquito adulticides. To date at least 100 species of pathogen-carrying mosquitoes have overcome the effects of today’s limited arsenal of adulticides. We now have only 2 chemical classes of adulticides available for adult mosquito control: organophosphates (OPs) and pyrethroids. Malathion is one of our oldest organophosphate adulticides and the workhorse of this class. It was developed in the early 1950 s for agricultural pest control and has been used extensively around the world as a mosquito adulticide since 1953. It is a cholinesterase inhibitor that impairs nerve cell transmission. Resistant mosquitoes have at least 3 biochemical processes for detoxifying this class of insecticide. Pyrethroid insecticides were developed in the 1970 s as analogs of pyrethrum, a natural product of chrysanthemum flowers, known for its insecticidal properties for hundreds of years. Pyrethroids provide rapid knockdown of mosquitoes by binding to sodium channels on nerve cells and subsequently depolarizing them to stop neural transmission. Resistant mosquitoes are now capable of detoxifying pyrethroids by the above 3 biochemical processes and target cell insensitivity. Larvicides offer more target sites for killing immature mosquitoes, but increased tolerance or resistance has also been reported among different larvicide classes including the <b>stomach</b> <b>poison</b> Bacillus sphaericus, insect growth regulator (methoprene), and a commonly used OP (temephos) among some mosquito species...|$|E
40|$|The {{advantages}} of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for farmers {{in developing countries}} have been clear for many years. It cuts production costs by reducing reliance on expensive agrochemicals, reduces hazards to both humans and the environment and, at the same time, stabilizes yields by ensuring the survival of natural enemies of major pests. Yet its use is not understood. Why is this so? The idea of integrated pest management is not new. The original definition envisaged 'applied pest control which integrates biological and chemical control. Chemical control is used in a manner which is least disruptive to biological control'. Many scientists would now regard such a definition as too restrictive and would view chemical control {{as a last resort}} when other methods fail to keep a pest in check. More recently, the concept of IPM has been applied to the integrated control of different types of pests (for example, insects, diseases and weeds) in the same crop. Although originally distinct, the two terms integrated control and IPM are now used almost interchangeably to imply both concepts. The essential features of IPM are straightforward, although their application in specific cases requires considerable understanding of the biology of the pests involved and their natural enemies. They include three important principles. Firstly, wherever feasible, control should rely on natural enemies of pests; methods that seriously disrupt natural regulation of pest populations should never be used. Secondly, natural enemies should be enhanced, either directly or indirectly, and plant resistance used to reduce the necessity for expensive chemical control. The third principle is that chemical control should be selective and should only be used as and when pest populations increase to a level above which serious economic loss will result. The last of these principles needs further explanation. In most cases, pest populations will be low following planting but, in the absence of adequate natural controls, will increase rapidly as the crop develops. However, up until a certain level, there will be little or no damage of economic significance to the crop. The population level at which significant economic damage is observed is known as the economic threshold for a given pest and only above this threshold is chemical control employed. In this way, natural enemies are allowed to build up and expensive chemicals are not wasted. The economic threshold is obviously a moving target and differs between crops, pest species and, since it is dependent on the market value of a given crop, between seasons. Nevertheless, use of economic thresholds has proved its value in reducing crop production costs and is now very widely used in pest control schemes. The components of integrated pest control The weapons available to the farmer are of four types; biological control, cultural control, selective pesticide use and plant resistance. Biological control using natural enemies of pests can be achieved through introduction of predators, parasites or diseases. Introduction (in some cases re-introduction) of natural enemies is now a familiar concept. Although there have been some spectacular successes, for example the control of prickly pear by the moth Cactoblastis cactorium in Australia and of cottony cushion scale on citrus in California, it should be said that less than half of all attempts at biological control by introduction have been successful. While the reasons for this are complex, it does emphasize the importance of retaining existing control agents through the rational use of pesticides. This is particularly true in the tropics where many crops face dozens of different pest species. Although the effect of any one member of this pest complex may be relatively minor, in combination they can cause drastic losses. To introduce specific predators or parasites for each pest would be totally uneconomic, even if they could be found; enhancement of existing natural enemies, many of which feed non-selectively, is a more sensible alternative. Cultural control, which involves manipulation of the crop and its surrounding habitat aims to increase the chance of survival of natural enemies or reduce that of the pests. One obvious technique is to practice mixed cropping rather than monoculture. This can both reduce the size of pest populations by limiting the food resource available and provide alternative refuges for natural enemies. Intercropping has similar aims but on a finer scale. Other techniques include the provision of refuges (not necessarily a crop species) or food sources for natural enemies. In some situations, complete weeding of the crop may reduce yields since 'weeds' can provide both refuges and food sources for natural enemies. Destruction of crop residues by removal or burning can sometimes be successfully used to interrupt the development of pests that have a resting stage in such residues. Selective pesticide use is another possible approach. The most important facet of selective pesticide use is employing economic thresholds to limit the amount of chemicals applied. However, modern developments in both pesticides and their application can also reduce the need to spray the crop. Several insecticides now available have some degree of inherent selectivity. An example is Endosulfan (Thiodan), which is effective against a wide variety of crop pests but which, at recommended application rates, has little effect on the minute parasitic wasps that are important natural enemies of many pests. When used in ultra-low volume formulation for control of tsetse flies, this insecticide was found to have virtually no detectable effect on other insect populations. Insecticides that are based on hormonal growth regulators or on microbial agents also show some degree of selectivity in their action. Even more selectivity can be achieved by careful formulation and application of pesticides. Because systemic insecticides are taken up through the foliage or roots of the plant they are only available to the chewing or sucking insects that attack it. The same principle applies to insecticides that are encapsulated, wrapped in a coating of gelatine or similar inert substance. The tiny capsules adhere {{to the surface of the}} plant and the insecticide can only be taken up by biting insects that feed on the plant. This avoids risk to predators and parasites. New application techniques can reduce the amounts of pesticide required to achieve effective control. Ultra low-volume (ULV) spraying is now widely used, particularly for aerial application. A rotating nozzle breaks the spray up into a haze of minute droplets. The droplets are sufficiently small that they can pass directly into the insect's body through the spiracles, the pores through which insects, breathe, killing them more rapidly. In this way, the amounts of insecticide required for effective control can be drastically reduced, often by as much as one hundredfold. One disadvantage of ULV spraying is that the droplets are so small that they are blown away by even the lightest breeze, reducing effectiveness. An ingenious technique called electrostatic deposition avoids this problem by giving each droplet a minute positive electric charge. The surface of the plant has a small negative charge, attracting droplets to the plant cuticle, where they are deposited. The pesticide is effectively 'glued' to the plant by electric forces! A cheap, portable sprayer, using this principle has now been marketed and has proved extremely effective in the Third World, particularly for the control of cotton pests. Plant resistance is a further option in IPM. Plant breeding has played a crucial role in the prevention of crop losses due to diseases throughout the 20 th century, and disease-resistance is a major objective in the development of new crop varieties. The concept of breeding for insect pest resistance is a more recent one but has had considerable success and is being actively pursued, particularly for tropical crops. A good example is the range of rice varieties developed at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines. IRRI has bred varieties resistant to four of the major insect pests of rice which are now very widely grown in S. E. Asia. Several varieties are available which combine resistance to three of the four major pests. Insect resistant varieties of cowpea, an important tropical pulse, have been developed at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) in Nigeria using advanced biotechnologies. Successes in integrated control One of the earliest examples of successful IPM comes from the Canete Valley in Peru, where from the 1940 s, cotton was grown as a monocrop with extremely heavy use of insecticides. By 1955, yields plummeted following blanket application of organochlorine and organophosphorus insecticides which resulted in breakdown of natural biological control and the development of pest resistance. In 1956, the government introduced compulsory crop rotation and mixed cropping and enforced a return to older insecticides. One of these, lead arsenate, is a <b>stomach</b> <b>poison</b> which only kills insects that chew the plant and is ineffective against natural insect enemies. These measures were combined with regular inspection of the crop for pests so that insecticides were only used when pest populations exceeded the economic threshold. Cotton yields rapidly recovered to levels close to those before the crisis and the Canete Valley remains today, over 40 years later, a major cotton producing area of Peru. Integrated control of pests has not been widely used in Africa but there have been some successes. The common coffee mealybug was a major pest of coffee in Kenya where its populations had exploded due to resistance to persistent organochlorine insecticides and to loss of natural enemies. Restrictions on the use of these insecticides, combined with the introduction and dissemination of a minute parasitic wasp (Anagyrus sp.) brought the pest back under control. Similarly, in Tanzania a major pest of sugar cane, the sugar cane scale insect, has been successfully controlled by carefully timed insecticide application in conjunction with the release of a ladybird beetle which preys specifically on the pest. Cassava, an important staple crop for some 200 million people in Africa, is seriously threatened by the cassava mealybug, accidentally introduced from South America 20 years ago. In this case, classical biological control is proving highly successful. A parasite of the mealybug, itself from South America, is released from the air and has successfully controlled the bug over large areas of West and Central Africa. In Asia, Indonesia experienced a severe reduction in rice yields in recent years due to the ravages of the Brown Planthopper. This has resulted from excessive use of insecticides, to many of which the planthopper now shows resistance. By 1986, 100, 000 hectares of rice had been destroyed by this pest alone, despite 4 to 5 applications of insecticide in each growing season. In 1988, the Indonesian government took the decision to ban the use of 57 different types of insecticides and to reduce severely the use of the recommended Carbamate insecticides. This has allowed populations of natural enemies to recover and to provide adequate control of the planthopper. Between 1986 and 1988, average yields of rice in Indonesia increased from 6. 1 tonnes per hectare to 7. 4 tonnes per hectare, a gain of 21 % in two years. Considering this was achieved simply by reducing the amount of insecticide applied, and, thus, production costs, the {{advantages of}} rational insecticide use had been confirmed. As a result, FAO is now planning experimental programmes of integrated rice pest control in 6 other countries in the region. The problems IPM is not a panacea and, as with biological control, there have been failures as well as successes. Clearly, IPM requires that farmers have a better knowledge of both the pests and their natural enemies than is the case with simple chemical control. It is also difficult for farmers to 'do nothing' until the pest reaches an economic threshold, even though it is clearly present in the crop. This is particularly true if, previously, they have been advised to spray at the first signs of the presence of pests. Neither can IPM be used against all types of pests. It has proved impossible to devise schemes for highly migratory pests, such as locusts, and soil nests. such as termites. The future of integrated control IPM is used on only a very small proportion of the world's crops. Apart from the problems mentioned above, the rapid development of synthetic pyrethroid insecticides since the 1970 s has largely overcome the problems of pest resistance to earlier insecticides. Nevertheless, the need for more rational pest management will grow. The problem of pest resistance will not simply go away (some insects already show resistance to pyrethroids) and the cost of agrochemicals, which are largely oil-based, is likely to continue to rise sharply. Several of the components of IPM are now widely used in crop protection in the industrialized countries. Crop surveillance, combined with the use of an economic threshold for chemical control, is now widely used in such crops as cotton, alfalfa, tobacco and many fruit crops. And biological control has proved particularly successful for glasshouse crops, where chemical control poses particular problems and where there is good environmental control. What, then, is the likely future of IPM in the tropics ? The need for food security has lead to greater emphasis on sustainable agriculture, within which IPM can play a crucial role. It has proved most successful where farmers have sufficient resources and education to exploit the possibilities of longer term control strategies, but there are many developing countries, particularly in Africa, where this does not yet apply. In the medium term, it is likely that more rational use of insecticides, based on crop surveillance, is likely to increase, if only for economic reasons. Whether this will develop into fully integrated control in the longer term will probably depend more on economic and political factors than on purely technical considerations. Above all, successful introduction of IPM depends critically on reasonably stable and fair prices for agricultural produce, both staple foods for home consumption and cash crops for export. The advantages of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for farmers in developing countries have been clear for many years. It cuts production costs by reducing reliance on expensive agrochemicals, reduces hazards to both humans and the environment and, [...] ...|$|E
