40|$|For {{nearly half}} a century, the Cummington Press and Abattoir Editions have {{distinguished}} themselves by publishing significant works of poetry and fiction in finely published editions of fewer than five hundred copies each. As both editor and publisher, Harry Duncan has been {{the driving force behind}} these presses and his contribution to twentieth century American Literature is well established. The introduction to this work summarizes some of the key elements in the growth and development of the two presses, and the bibliography provides a full record of Duncan 2 ̆ 7 s presswork, including works commissioned by other presses, such as New Directions. The introduction focuses on biographical and critical comments of a general nature, focusing in particular on the personal relationships of the authors and the printer; the bibliography supplies, in each case where the information is known, facts about: author, title, title page, collation, pagination, colophon, contents (page by page), typography, paper, binding, original sale price, <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>edition,</b> and copies examined. The bibliography is limited to items which have some literary content. Ephemeral items of a non-literary nature were deliberately excluded. An appendix containing a personal interview with Duncan completes the volume. ...|$|E

40|$|Lise Andries : Paris publisher-printers and {{the freedom}} of the press (1789 - 1795). Until 1791 the freedom to sell printed works was {{controlled}} by the Paris council. From the end of 1791 until 10 th August 1792, for about the only time during the Revolution, there was total freedom to print and sell. However it must be admitted that during the year II, it was mainly journalists rather than publisher-printers who were hit by repression. A study of police archives also gives us {{a better understanding of the}} conditions in which brochures were printed and sold, the peddlars' beats in Paris, <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>editions,</b> prices and titles sold.

To build statistical language models, {{we have used}} the both first edition [25] and second <b>edition</b> [26] <b>of</b> the Peykare corpus. As mentioned in Sect. 2.2. 2, the first <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> this corpus contains about ten million words that are annotated with POS tags. Using this corpus, we constructed different types of n-gram language models. Since the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> this <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> the corpus was not enough for making a reliable word-based n-gram language model, we built POS-based and class-based n-gram language models, {{in addition to the}} word-based n-gram model. These language models are used in the intermediate version of Nevisa. The final language model of the Nevisa has been constructed from the second <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> the Peykare corpus.|$|R
5000|$|In later times, printmakers {{recognized}} the value <b>of</b> limiting the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> an <b>edition</b> {{and including the}} volume <b>of</b> the <b>edition</b> in the print number (e.g., [...] "15/30" [...] for the 15th print in an <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> 30). Tight controls on the process to limit or eliminate variation in quality have become the norm. In monotyping, a technique where only two impressions at most can be taken, prints may be numbered 1/1, or marked [...] "unique". Artists usually print an edition {{much smaller than the}} plate allows, both for marketing reasons and to keep the edition comfortably within the lifespan of the plate. Specific steps may also be taken to strengthen the plate, such as electroplating intaglio images, which uses an electric process to put a very thin coat of a stronger metal onto a plate of a weaker metal.|$|R

It is around twice the traditional size and was published in a limited <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> 5,000.

30|$|We {{establish}} that language dyads do not edit {{articles about the}} same concept (co-occur) by chance. Large editions share concepts more frequently than expected: although in the data EN-DE and EN-FR overlap in 45 % of cases, only 15 % is expected by the null model. To little surprise, the amount <b>of</b> overlap between <b>editions</b> in the data decreases with the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the <b>editions.</b> One notable exception is the Japanese edition which, despite being among the ten largest Wikipedias, co-occurs with other top editions noticeably less frequently. Similarly, the Uzbek edition, being among the ten smallest in the dataset, shows high concept overlap with large editions. By simply plotting frequencies of co-occurrences, we do not observe any local blocks or clusters, neither among large nor small editions (see Figure A 1 in Additional file 1).|$|R

50|$|Prints {{by artists}} today may {{potentially}} retain their financial value as art (i.e., as an appreciating investment) {{because they are}} created by an artistic process rather than by a strictly mechanical one, and may become scarce {{because the number of}} multiples is limited. In Rembrandt's time, the limit on the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> an <b>edition</b> was practical: a plate degrades through use, putting an upper limit on the number of images to be struck. Plates can be reworked and restored to some degree, but it is generally not possible to create more than a thousand prints from any process except lithography or woodcut. A few hundred is a more practical upper limit, and even that allows for significant variation in the quality of the image. In drypoint, 10 or 20 may be the maximum number of top-quality impressions possible.|$|R

40|$|Books {{and other}} printed matter are media of communication, {{used to carry}} and {{distribute}} – mediate – "content". A medium, however, is always material, and as such it produces meaning in its own right. So even though content and medium might be separate and distinct entities, they are intimately connected, {{and in order to}} be communicated a piece of "content" is always given one or another material form. This form, whichever it may be, adds meaning to the actual content – it becomes part of it. In publishing this relation, that is fundamentally an epistemological one, rarely seems to be acknowledged. The overlook becomes especially apparent in the belief that the e-book can substitute the printed book whereas the two forms of mediation are exactly two – distinct, and representing different modi. For students within publishing studies digital publishing has made knowledge of the meaning of materiality, and {{of the history of the}} book and of the book market more acute than ever. Digital publishing might increase the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> an <b>edition</b> (a concept diluted in digital environments) but it decreases the publisher’s possibilities to use form and materiality as an important aspect of communication and as part of the business concept. At the same time, digital publishing faces the publisher with a completely new range of challenges, challenges that show that digital documents are made up of a far more heavy kind of materiality than analogue ones. The paper will address questions on how the form and materiality of both analogue and digital documents produce meaning, why this is an important issue to discuss within the field of publishing studies, and what the history of the book can learn us about the future of it...|$|R
