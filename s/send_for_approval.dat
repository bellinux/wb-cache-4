Like the other assistants, Heller would review works of art by other designers and <b>send</b> to Herdeg <b>for</b> <b>approval.</b> According to Heller, his relationship with Herdeg was a professional one that gave way to the business side, either the works reviewed by the correspondents reached the magazine, or were filtered out and the proceeding issues followed suit.|$|R
25|$|List of kulaks {{were to be}} {{prepared}} by local executive committees and officially approved by the Council of Ministers, but due to the tight deadline and top secret nature of the task, local MGB offices compiled their own lists of kulaks. This caused much confusion during the operation. Local MGB offices would prepare summary certificates for each family and <b>send</b> them <b>for</b> <b>approval</b> to the republican MGB office. For example, by 14 March, Estonian MGB approved summary certificates for 9,407 families (3,824 kulaks and 5,583 nationalists and bandits) which created a reserve of 1,907 families above the quota. Overall, {{due to the lack}} of time, the files on deportees were often incomplete or incorrect. Therefore, from April to June, retrospective corrections were made – new files were added for people deported but not on deportee lists and files of those who escaped deportations were removed.|$|R

From 1805 to 1808, he lived in Paris, tutoring the children of Tadeusz Mostowski, a prominent politician and writer, while studying with the miniaturist, Jean-Baptiste Jacques Augustin. When {{he went back to}} Warsaw, he worked as a clerk in the Ministry of Justice. He returned to Paris in 1809 on a government stipend; taking some lessons with Jacques-Louis David. Soon, he balked at the rules that required him to <b>send</b> paintings home <b>for</b> <b>approval</b> and his funds were cut off in 1812. He decided to stay in Paris and support himself by painting portraits while taking more lessons, this time from François Gérard, who became his patron.|$|R
25|$|Planned content {{begins with}} the creative/marketing team {{generating}} their ideas, once they have completed their ideas they <b>send</b> them off <b>for</b> <b>approval.</b> There is two general ways of doing so. The first is where each sector approves the plan one after another, editor, brand, followed by the legal team (Brito, 2013). Sectors may differ {{depending on the size}} and philosophy of the business. The second is where each sector is given 24 hours (or such designated time) to sign off or disapprove. If no action is given within the 24-hour period the original plan is implemented. Planned content is often noticeable to customers and is un-original or lacks excitement but is also a safer option to avoid unnecessary backlash from the public. Both routes for planned content are time consuming as in the above; the first way to approval takes 72 hours to be approved. Although the second route can be significantly shorter it also holds more risk particularly in the legal department.|$|R

40|$|The present {{research}} examines need <b>for</b> <b>approval</b> from social networks {{in regards to}} an individual's relationship as a dispositional trait, varying at individual levels. In order to explore trait-level need <b>for</b> <b>approval,</b> associations between need <b>for</b> <b>approval</b> and other dispositional-level traits were examined, including self-esteem, attachment dimensions, personality traits, including extraversion, neuroticism, and agreeableness, collectivistic and individualistic orientations, and the dimensions of autonomy and sociotropy. Measurement of need <b>for</b> <b>approval</b> involved an original scale construction. Two-hundred eighty participants completed a web-based questionnaire. Significant associations were identified between dispositional-need <b>for</b> <b>approval</b> and individualism, collectivism, attachment avoidance, sociotropy, extraversion (including its facet of warmth), and agreeableness. These results suggest that need <b>for</b> <b>approval</b> from social networks is distinct, but related to individual difference dimensions...|$|R

40|$|The {{literature}} cited {{points to}} an increase in sexual permissiveness among females which may be a function of their need <b>for</b> <b>approval.</b> It was hypothesized that there is a relationship between need <b>for</b> <b>approval</b> and sexual liberalism. In addition, several other aspects of female sexual attitudes and their relationship to need <b>for</b> <b>approval</b> were examined in the present study. Specifically, need <b>for</b> <b>approval</b> was hypothesized to be related to sexual satisfaction, sexual libido (drive), and sexual prudishness. In order to establish the relationship between need <b>for</b> <b>approval</b> and aspects of female sexuality the effects of religiosity must be considered. Previous studies cited in the literature indicate that religiosity is an important covariate in relation to sexual attitudes and behaviors (Cardwell, 1969; Deadman, 1959; Heltsley 2 ̆ 6 Broderick, 1969; Kinsey, 1953).
