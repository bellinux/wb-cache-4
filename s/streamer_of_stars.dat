50|$|The Carina-Sagittarius Arm (also {{known as}} Sagittarius Arm or Sagittarius-Carina Arm, labeled -I) is {{generally}} {{thought to be}} a minor spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy. Each spiral arm is a long, diffuse curving <b>streamer</b> <b>of</b> <b>stars</b> that radiates out from the galactic center. These gigantic structures are often composed of billions of stars and thousands of gas clouds. The Carina-Sagittarius Arm {{is one of the most}} pronounced arms in our galaxy as a large number of HII regions, young stars and giant molecular clouds are concentrated in it.|$|E
5000|$|The Scutum-Centaurus Arm, {{also known}} as Scutum-Crux arm, is a long, diffuse curving <b>streamer</b> <b>of</b> <b>stars,</b> gas and dust that spirals outward from the {{proximate}} end of the Milky Way's central bar. The Milky Way has been assumed since the 1950s to have four spiral arms although the evidence for this has never been strong. In 2008, observations using the Spitzer Space Telescope failed to show the expected density of red clump giants {{in the direction of}} the Sagittarius and Norma arms. In January 2014, a 12-year study into the distribution and lifespan of massive stars and a study of the distribution of masers and open clusters [...] both found evidence for four spiral arms.|$|E
50|$|About 1.2 {{billion years}} ago, the Antennae were two {{separate}} galaxies. NGC 4038 was a {{barred spiral galaxy}} and NGC 4039 was a spiral galaxy. Before the galaxies collided, NGC 4039 was larger than NGC 4038. 900 million years ago, the Antennae began to approach one another, looking similar to NGC 2207 and IC 2163. 600 million years ago, the Antennae passed through each other, looking like the Mice Galaxies. 300 million years ago, the Antennae's stars began {{to be released from}} both galaxies. Today the two <b>streamers</b> <b>of</b> ejected <b>stars</b> extend far beyond the original galaxies, resulting in the antennae shape.|$|R

40|$|A local dwarf galaxy, NGC 5253, has a young super {{star cluster}} that may provide an example <b>of</b> highly {{efficient}} <b>star</b> formation. Here we report the detection and imaging, with the Submillimeter Array, of the J= 3 - 2 rotational transition of CO at {{the location of}} the massive cluster associated with the supernebula. The gas cloud is hot, dense, quiescent, and extremely dusty. Its gas-to-dust ratio is lower than the Galactic value, which we attribute to dust enrichment by Wolf-Rayet stars within the embedded star cluster. Its star formation efficiency exceeds 50 %, ten times higher than clouds in the Milky Way: this cloud is a factory <b>of</b> <b>stars</b> and soot.

40|$|Gas {{clouds in}} present-day galaxies are inefficient at forming stars. Low star-formation {{efficiency}} {{is a critical}} parameter in galaxy evolution: it is why stars are still forming nearly 14 billion years after the Big Bang and why star clusters generally do not survive their births, instead dispersing to form galactic disks or bulges. Yet the existence of ancient massive bound star clusters (globular clusters) in the Milky Way suggests that efficiencies were higher when they formed ten billion years ago. A local dwarf galaxy, NGC 5253, has a young star cluster that provides an example <b>of</b> highly efficient <b>star</b> formation. Here we report the detection of the J = 3 2 rotational transition of CO {{at the location of}} the massive cluster. The gas cloud is hot, dense, quiescent and extremely dusty. Its gas-to-dust ratio is lower than the Galactic value, which we attribute to dust enrichment by the embedded star cluster.

40|$|We have {{performed}} {{the observation of}} the "Galactic Center Mini-spiral(GCMS) " in H 42 alpha recombination line {{as a part of}} the first large-scale mosaic observation in the Sagittarius A complex using Atacama Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA). We revealed the kinematics of the ionized gas <b>streamers</b> <b>of</b> the GCMS. We found that the ionized gas <b>streamers</b> <b>of</b> the Northern Arm(NA) and Eastern Arm(EA) in their outer regions somewhat deviate from the Keplerian orbits which were derived previously from the trajectories in the inner regions. In addition, we found that the streamer corresponding to the Bar of the GCMS has a Keplerian orbit with an eccentricity of e~ 0. 8, which is independent from the Keplerian orbits <b>of</b> the other <b>streamers</b> <b>of</b> the GCMS. We estimated the LTE electron temperature and electron density in the ionized gas streamers. We confirmed the previously claimed tendency that the electron temperatures increase toward Sgr A*. We found that the electron density in the NA and EA also increases with approaching Sgr A* without the lateral expansion <b>of</b> the gas <b>streamers.</b> This suggests that there is some external pressure around the GCMS. The ambient ionized gas may cause the confinement and/or the perturbation for the orbits. There is a good positional correlation between the protostar candidates detected by JVLA at 34 GHz and the ionized gas streamer, Northeastern Arm, newly found by our H 42 alpha recombination line observation. This suggests that the candidates had formed in the streamer and they were brought to near Sgr A* as the streamer falls. Comment: 35 pages, 12 figures, Accepted for publication in Ap...|$|R
