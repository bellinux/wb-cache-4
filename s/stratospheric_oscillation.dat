The temporal evolutions are different between the SIO and the TIO, suggesting different dynamic mechanisms. The planetary waves tend to be bent equatorward in the troposphere during a positive TIO phase, and in the mid- and upper stratosphere during a positive SIO phase. The result also suggests that upward propagation of planetary waves into the polar waveguide across the tropopause is closely associated with the TIO.

The cross correlation between this ENSO representation and LOD variation on the interannual time scale was found to have a maximum value of 0. 68 and the LOD phase lag of 2 months, indicating that most of the interannual LOD variation is caused by ENSO, and that the transfer of ENSO's axial angular momentum to the solid earth lags behind the Tahiti-Darwin pressure variation by about 2 months.

These correlations quantify the large-scale tropical temperature response to transient convection, showing coherent wave-like variations over ~ 12 - 18 km which span a hemisphere in longitude.

30|$|Using a 46 -year-long dataset of the thermospheric density during 1967 – 2012, we {{examined}} the inter-annual variability in the thermosphere at 400  km and its potential connection to El-Nino Southern <b>Oscillation</b> (ENSO) and <b>stratospheric</b> Quasi-Biennial <b>Oscillation</b> (QBO). Wavelet analysis reveals two major modes of the thermosphere inter-annual oscillation, with the slower mode having an average period of ~ 64  months and the faster mode of ~ 28  months. The slower mode bears high coherence with the ENSO during 1982 – 2012, while the faster mode is found to vary coherently with the QBO around 1972, 1982 and 2002. Further examination reveals that the coherence between QBO and the faster mode is significantly influenced by their common coherent variation with the solar flux, while high coherence between the slower mode and ENSO is much less contaminated. Therefore, we conclude that the 28 -month periodicity in thermospheric density {{may be caused by}} both QBO and solar radiation, whereas the 64 -month periodicity possibly arises mainly from ENSO processes, with little/small contribution from solar radiation.|$|R

The deep convection and latent heat release in the tropics are source processes for broadband atmospheric waves, such as Rossby, Kelvin, and gravity waves (Dunkerton 1997; Baldwin et al. 2001). Taguchi (2010) statistically analyzed the stratospheric zonal wind data archive of radiosonde observations at equatorial stations from 1953 to 2008 {{and found that the}} change in QBO amplitude between La Niña and El Niño conditions corresponds to about 9 % of the grand mean. In contrast, the phase progression rate for the ENSO cycle changes as much as 26 % compared to the grand mean. Broadband waves also drive for the QBO above 80  km altitude (Baldwin et al. 2001). Possible ENSO signals with temporal scales longer than one year in the thermosphere (Liu 2016 a) and ionosphere (Pedatella and Forbes 2009) have also been reported.|$|R

In particular, the indices of El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) including warming phase (El Niño), cooling phase (La Niña) and neutral phase relate to the activity of the tropical storms and tropical depressions in the Vietnamese coast.

In this note a simple one-layer model is used to demonstrate that the gross features of the observed QBO in total ozone can be attributed to meridional advection of the ozone perturbation by the annually reversing mean meridional Hadley circulation. This advection causes a displacement of the equatorial ozone anomaly toward the winter hemisphere, and thus produces an asymmetry with respect to the equator. It also modulates the amplitude of the ozone QBO, since the phase of the equatorial wind QBO with respect to the annual cycle may produce either constructive or destructive interference beween the effects of the annually reversing meridional transport and the vertical advection by the equatorial wind QBO...|$|R

There are two potentially important natural internal sources of long-term tidal variability in our atmosphere: the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the <b>stratospheric</b> quasi-biennial <b>oscillation</b> (QBO). With the large variations in the rainfall and latent heat patterns caused by ENSO, it is to be expected that it will have a noticeable effect on the tides.

40|$|In this study, {{statistical}} {{evidence of}} a possible modulation of the equatorial <b>stratospheric</b> quasi-biennial <b>oscillation</b> (QBO) by the solar wind dynamic pressure is provided.

These lower stratospheric easterly anomalies are primarily linked to the high-frequency component of solar wind dynamic pressure with periods shorter than 3 years. In annually and seasonally aggregated daily averages, the signature of solar wind dynamic pressure in the equatorial zonal wind is characterized by a vertical three-cell anomaly pattern with westerly anomalies in both the troposphere and the upper stratosphere and easterly anomalies in the lower stratosphere. This anomalous behavior in tropical winds is accompanied by a downward propagation of positive temperature anomalies from the upper stratosphere to the lower stratosphere over a period of a year. These results suggest that the solar wind dynamic pressure exerts a seasonal change of the tropical upwelling that results in a systemic modulation of the annual cycle in the lower stratospheric temperature, which in turn affects the QBO during austral late winter and spring...|$|R

Also a more dry-stable atmosphere would lead to fewer hurricanes.

40|$|On interannual time scales, quasi-cyclic {{activity}} in the troposphere is generally thought to arise from chaotic feedback processes, and therefore to be unpredictable in nature. Here, evidence is presented for periodic ‘clockwork’ climate behavior, seen as a stable quasi-biennial (QB) oscillation in Western US winter precipitation, estimated at a period of 2. 16  ± ~ 0. 05  years. In the Western US, the QB precipitation mode has an influence {{comparable to that of}} ENSO, with strongest effects observed at central latitudes of the region. The oscillation displays systematic phase-shifting with respect to the annual cycle, signifying a stable, nonseasonal and strongly periodic QB mechanism. The cycle in precipitation results proximally from a meridional standing pressure wave over the North American Pacific coast. Analysis of monthly pressure data confirms the nonseasonal, periodic character of the oscillation, which appears to have maintained phase from the mid- 20 th century to recent years. The regional QB pressure cycle is traced to a quasi-synchronous pulsation of meridional pressure waves in the extratropics of both hemispheres, termed a Biennial Annular Mode Oscillation (BAMO). The BAMO oscillates in quadrature with a weaker ~ 26 -month signal in the tropical Southern Oscillation.

Cross-validation of the coherent mode from each dataset and that of a global barotropic model demonstrates {{a high degree of}} correspondence between sea-level observations and model estimations and also indicates that the coherent oceanic mode is largely barotropically driven upon subannual time-scales, whilst baroclinic oceanic effects predominate at longer periods. Both the coherent mode and transport are shown to be modified by the <b>stratospheric</b> Quasi-Biennial <b>Oscillation</b> (QBO) and a mechanism is described by which QBO-dependent planetary wave activity may be guided from the stratosphere towards the surface by high-latitude easterly and westerly jets, inducing wind anomalies that force sea-level variability through equatorward Ekman transport. A longer (18 -year) tide-gauge record from the Vernadsky/Faraday station and a 22 -year time series of sea-level estimations from an ocean general circulation model are used to show that QBO-induced sea-level and transport variability may be modulated upon longer time-scales by a quasi-decadal cycle of solar activit...|$|R
40|$|Most chemistry-climate models show an {{intensification}} of the Brewer-Dobson circulation (BDC) {{in the stratosphere}} associated with increasing greenhouse gas emissions and ozone depletion in the last decades, but this trend remains to be confirmed in observational data. In this work {{the evolution of the}} advective BDC for the period 1979 – 2012 is evaluated and compared in three modern reanalyses (ERA-Interim, MERRA, and JRA- 55). Three different estimates of the BDC are computed for each reanalysis, one based on the definition of the residual circulation and two indirect estimates derived from momentum and thermodynamic balances. The comparison among the nine estimates shows substantial uncertainty in the mean magnitude (∼ 40 %) but significant common variability. The tropical upwelling series show variability linked to the <b>stratospheric</b> quasi-biennial <b>oscillation</b> and to El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and also reflect extreme events such as major sudden stratospheric warmings and volcanic eruptions. The trend analysis suggests a strengthening of tropical upwelling of around 2 – 5 %/decade throughout the layer 100 – 10 [*]hPa. The global spatial structure of the BDC trends provides evidence of an overall acceleration of the circulation in both hemispheres, with qualitative agreement among the estimates. The global BDC trends are mainly linked to changes in the boreal winter season and can be tracked to long-term increases in the resolved wave drag in both hemispheres...|$|R
40|$|The quasi-biennial {{oscillation}} (QBO) signature in the equatorial upper stratosphere and mesosphere is analyzed from MAECHAM 5 and HAMMONIA general circulation models. Our {{results show that}} this region is significantly influenced by the stratospheric QBO. In the upper stratosphere the QBO modulates the altitude of maximum descent of the <b>stratospheric</b> semiannual <b>oscillation</b> (SSAO) westerly phases. Our results also suggest that the QBO modulates the altitude of maximum descent and also {{the strength of the}} SSAO easterly phase. We explore the role of large-scale and small-scale waves and also momentum advection in the forcing of the QBO signature in the SSAO domain. The results show how the vertical propagation of the QBO signature to the middle and upper mesosphere depends on the vertical phase structure of the SAO and consequently on the seasonal cycle. During the solstices when MSAO westerlies prevail in the middle and upper mesosphere no QBO signature can be detected above the stratopause region. However, during the equinoxes, when MSAO easterlies dominate in the middle and upper mesosphere, the QBO signature extends throughout the mesosphere and low thermosphere. The QBO directly modulates MSAO easterlies by modifying the altitude at which they are generated in the upper mesosphere. A QBO signature is also detected on the MSAO westerly phase occurring in the mesopause region during the equinoxes. Copyright © 2010 by the American Geophysical Union...|$|R

The gravity wave perturbations showed periodicities in the 0. 5 ? 3 -h range and attained large amplitudes (4 ? 5 K) in the mesosphere. The phase propagation characteristics of gravity waves with different periods showed upward wave propagation with a vertical wavelength of 5 ? 7 km. The mean flow acceleration computed from the divergence of momentum flux of gravity waves is compared with that calculated from monthly values of zonal wind obtained from RH- 200 rockets flights.

30|$|Recent {{satellite}} and radar observations {{suggest that the}} semiannual oscillation (SAO) in the mesosphere is modulated by the <b>stratospheric</b> quasibiennial <b>oscillation</b> (QBO). The modulation is only apparent during the SAO easterly phase, which is considerably stronger when QBO winds are westerly than when they are easterly. We use an equatorial beta-plane model to demonstrate how such a modulation could come about through selective damping of the equatorial wave spectrum excited by deep convection. The waves affected most strongly are easterly inertia-gravity waves of phase speeds slower than ∼ − 40 m s− 1. This {{is close to the}} zonal wind speed during the easterly phase of the QBO (− 30 to − 35 m s− 1), so the waves suffer strong thermal damping or even absorption as they propagate through the stratosphere. Because these waves are important for driving the easterly phase of the mesopause SAO in the model, that phase is weaker when the stratospheric QBO winds are easterly. A similar modulation of the westerly phase of the SAO does not occur for two reasons: (1) QBO westerlies are only half as strong as QBO easterlies, and (2) much of the driving of the westerly phase of the SAO is accomplished by Kelvin waves of phase speed ∼ 40 – 60 m s− 1. As a consequence, the QBO winds have negligible influence on the vertical propagation of waves with westerly phase velocity and hence on the westerly phase of the modeled SAO.|$|R
40|$|Zonal-wind {{measurements}} obtained between October 2001 and July 2011 {{with the}} SKiYMET meteor radar located at Ascension Island (8 °S, 14 °W) {{have been used}} to study the interannual variability at meteor ablation altitudes (approximately 78 - 100 km) and its coupling to the <b>stratospheric</b> quasi-biennial <b>oscillation</b> (QBO). An upper mesospheric QBO (MQBO) with a period of 27. 5 months has been detected throughout the observational period. The MQBO is found to be out-of-phase with the stratospheric QBO (SQBO) at 15 - 20 hPa and in-phase compared to 70 hPa, whereas no significant zero time-lag correlation exists between the long-term mesospheric zonal winds and the SQBO at 40 - 50 hPa. The MQBO magnitude is found to be 4. 1 ± 0. 7 m/s at 88 km. No significant change in MQBO magnitude is found throughout the altitude range under consideration. It was found that the MQBO signal is mainly carried around the March equinox, although the MQBO signal is present throughout most of the year, although less pronounced, at the lower altitudes as well. No observational evidence was found that the MQBO, between approximately 78 - 100 km, plays a role in the interhemispheric ducting of the quasi- 16 day wave.

40|$|Abstract. The {{application}} of general circulation models (GCMs) to stratospheric hemistry and transport both permits and requires {{a thorough investigation}} of stratospheric water vapor. The National Center for Atmospheric Research as redesigned its GCM, the Community Climate Model (CCM 2), to enable studies of the chemistry and transport of tracers including water vapor; the importance of water vapor to the climate and {{chemistry of the stratosphere}} quires that it be better understood in the atmosphere and well represented in the model. In this study, methane is carried as a tracer and convened to water; this simple chemistry provides an adequate representation of the upper stratospheric water vapor source. The cold temperature bias in the winter polar strato-sphere, which the CCM 2 shares with other GCMs, produces excessive dehydration in the southern hemisphere, but this dry bias can be ameliorated by setting a minimum vapor pressure. The CCM 2 's water vapor distribution and seasonality compare favorably with observations in many re-spects, though seasonal variations including the upper <b>stratospheric</b> semiannual <b>oscillation</b> are generally too small. Southern polar dehydration affects midlatitude water vapor mixing ratios by a few tenths of a part per million, mostly after the demise of the vortex. The annual cycle of water vapor in the tropical and nonhem midlatitude lower stratosphere isdominated by drying at the trop-ical tropopause. Water vapor has a longer adjustment time than methane and had not reached equi-librium {{at the end of the}} 9 years simulated here. 1...|$|R
40|$|The UK {{experienced}} record average rainfall {{in winter}} 2013 – 14, leading to widespread and prolonged flooding. The immediate {{cause of this}} exceptional rainfall {{was a very strong}} and persistent cyclonic atmospheric circulation over the North East Atlantic Ocean. This was related to a very strong North Atlantic jet stream which resulted in numerous damaging wind storms. These exceptional meteorological conditions have led to renewed questions about whether anthropogenic climate change is noticeably influencing extreme weather. The regional weather pattern responsible for the extreme UK winter coincided with highly anomalous conditions across the globe. We assess the contributions from various possible remote forcing regions using sets of ocean–atmosphere model relaxation experiments, where winds and temperatures are constrained to be similar to those observed in winter 2013 – 14 within specified atmospheric domains. We find that influences from the tropics were likely to have {{played a significant role in}} the development of the unusual extra-tropical circulation, including a role for the tropical Atlantic sector. Additionally, a stronger and more stable stratospheric polar vortex, likely associated with a strong westerly phase of the <b>stratospheric</b> Quasi-Biennial <b>Oscillation</b> (QBO), appears to have contributed to the extreme conditions. While intrinsic climatic variability clearly has the largest effect on the generation of extremes, results from an analysis which segregates circulation-related and residual rainfall variability suggest that emerging climate change signals made a secondary contribution to extreme rainfall in winter 2013 – 14...|$|R
40|$|There is {{no single}} {{reference}} dataset of long-term global upper-air temperature observations, although several groups have developed datasets from radiosonde and satellite observations for climate-monitoring purposes. The existence of multiple data products allows for exploration of the uncertainty in signals of climate variations and change. This paper examines eight upper-air temperature datasets and quantifies the magnitude and uncertainty of various climate signals, including <b>stratospheric</b> quasi-biennial <b>oscillation</b> (QBO) and tropospheric ENSO signals, stratospheric warming following three major volcanic eruptions, the abrupt tropospheric warming of 1976 – 77, and multidecadal temperature trends. Uncertainty estimates are based both on the spread of signal estimates from the different observational datasets and on the inherent statistical uncertainties of the signal in any individual dataset. The large spread among trend estimates suggests that using multiple datasets to characterize large-scale upperair temperature trends gives a more complete characterization of their uncertainty than reliance on a single dataset. For other climate signals, there is value in using more than one dataset, because signal strengths vary. However, the purely statistical uncertainty of the signal in individual datasets {{is large enough to}} effectively encompass the spread among datasets. This result supports the notion of an 11 th climate-monitoring principle, augmenting the 10 principles that have now been generally accepted (although not generally implemented) by the climate community. This 11 th principle calls for monitoring key climate variables with multiple, independent observing systems for measuring the variable, and multiple, independent groups analyzing the data...|$|R
