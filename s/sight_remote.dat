On these grounds, I am glad to see our Government making friends with America and abandoning the militaristic Anglo-Japanese Alliance. But I do not wish this to be done in a spirit of hostility to Japan, or in a blind reliance upon the future good intentions of America. I shall therefore try to state Japan's case, although, for the present, I think it weaker than America's.|$|R

40|$|We {{update the}} Big Bang Nucleosynthesis {{calculations}} {{on the basis}} of the recent NACRE compilation. The average values of the calculated abundances of light nuclei do not differ significantly from that obtained using the previous Fowler's compilation. ^ 7 Li is slightly depressed at high baryon to photon ratio η. The main uncertainty concerns the D(p,γ) ^ 3 He reaction rate affecting the synthesis of ^ 7 Li (via the ^ 3 He(α,γ) ^ 7 Be(eν) ^ 7 Li) at rather high baryonic density. On the left part of the lithium valley the uncertainty is strongly reduced due to the improvement of the measurement of the T(α,γ) ^ 7 Li reaction rate. We use lithium- 7 as the main baryometer, since, though much efforts have been devoted to the determination of Deuterium in absorbing clouds in the line of <b>sight</b> of <b>remote</b> quasars, the statistics is very poor compared to the long series of lithium measurements. Taking into account the lithium constraints, two possible baryonic density ranges emerge, η_ 10 = 1. 4 - 1. 9 and η_ 10 = 3. 3 - 5. 1. The Be and B abundances produced in the big bang are orders of magnitudes lower, and spallation of fast carbon and oxygen is probably their unique source, in the early Galaxy.

50|$|First, {{the manual}} {{calculator}} {{was replaced by}} an external box operated by a new crew member. The box contained the inputs needed to drive the vector calculator, as well as copies of the various aircraft instruments displaying required information. The operator simply had to keep the input dials set so their indicators overlapped those on the instruments. This drove the machine to calculate the correct angles, as on the earlier CSBS models, and fed them directly into a <b>remote</b> <b>sighting</b> unit, the sighting head. This provided practically instant updates of the sighting angles. The wire sights of the earlier models were replaced by reflector sights indicating the location the bombs would hit if dropped at that instant. As the sighting head lacked the vector computer it was much smaller than earlier models, which allowed it to be easily mounted on a stabilized platform. This allowed the sights to be used even while the aircraft was maneuvering, and required only 10 seconds to settle.|$|R

40|$|The {{frequent}} {{occurrence of}} earthquake in New Zealand drives {{the research on}} snake robot for {{search and rescue operation}} because of its elongated body shape and locomotion mimicry of the biological snake. Both features are in favour of moving the snake robot through the earthquake disaster area. To facilitate the robot control and information gathering, it is usually required to install a camera on the snake robot head so that the video images of the disaster area can be send back to the human operator. This thesis presents the simulation of a snake robot performing serpentine motion. A camera is attached on the snake robot head to obtain the video image along the line of <b>sight.</b> A <b>remote</b> controller is incorporated to control the advancement based on the video images. This simulation reveals that the video images from the camera oscillate seriously because the camera on the snake robot head follows serpenoid curve during the locomotion. As a result, both robot control and information gathering are affected. A solution is proposed to stabilize the snake robot head and its camera by introducing a correction at the joint between the robot head and its body. This correction aligns the camera sight direction with the moving direction of the snake robot to yield satisfactory video images. Finally, an actual snake robot is implemented with a wireless camera installed on the head to show the effect of correction. Experiments are conducted to control the advancement of snake robot remotely just based on the video images obtained from the camera. This greatly improves the performance of the snake robot...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a comparative}} study of lives and works of two émigré writers : the Polish Witold Gombrowicz (1904 - 1969) and Cuban Virgilio Piñera (1912 - 1979). The two met in 1946 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where they developed a lifelong friendship grounded in intellectual compatibility and fueled by literary collaboration. My study focuses mainly {{on the body of}} work that the two authors produced during the twenty- three-year span of time between their initial meeting and the death of Gombrowicz. I argue that the writers shared a strong desire to renovate the world of literature in their home countries, including their host culture, Argentina. This desire in turn allowed them to develop in their writings a unique mode of cultural criticism which sought to build a bridge between the literary worlds of two geographically distant and, at least at first <b>sight,</b> culturally <b>remote</b> regions: Latin America and East-Central Europe. There are five chapters that comprise this dissertation. The introductory chapter conceptualizes the theoretical framework for analyzing Gombrowicz and Piñera's works in relation to their historical and biographical contexts. Chapter One focuses specifically on the year 1947 and the writers' collaboration on six critical texts which target the most prominent Argentine literary and intellectual figures of the time. The subsequent two chapters examine the novels La carne de René by Piñera and Trans-Atlantyk by Gombrowicz, both written in the early 1950 s, when the exchange of ideas between the two writers was still at its peak. Finally, the fourth chapter presents the long censured theater plays Los siervos (by Piñera) and Operetta (by Gombrowicz). Regardless of tangible similarities in their storylines as well as conceptual underpinnings - especially, a shared concern with cultural and political nationalism, including the particular case of Peronism in Argentina - neither the two novels nor the theater pieces to my knowledge have yet been addressed in parallel. By engaging with Gombrowicz and Piñera scholarship in English, Spanish, Polish, French and German, I aim to join a body of research that recovers and contextualizes the voices that come from the margins of the Western literary histor...|$|R

There is also an increasing rate of people in the blind community who are willing to learn and train to use canes and guide dogs.

As technology improves, the blind community will want to become more and more independent in hope that one day, they will be as normal as a person with no visual problems. One typical problem that the visually impaired have thus far is being able to shop at their own convenience and privacy. The GroZi Shopping Assistant is our solution to this problem. It is the next step towards being able to locate objects by the use of computer vision.

40|$|The Electronic System and Information Technology Research Group at Brunel University has {{designed}} a multifaceted navigation system for {{blind and visually}} impaired pedestrians. The primary operation of the system mimics the advantages of an informed sighted guide by using Global Positioning Systems and <b>remote</b> (<b>sighted</b> on the user) video cameras as navigational sensors. The information generated is streamed to a central control centre. This allows the system to operate in a fully automatic or operator assisted mode dependent on the users requirements. Initially the system used an audio link to transfer information to the user, however this has proved problematic. Clear unimpeded access to ambient sound is vital for visually impaired and blind pedestrians, both for efficient wayfinding and safety. Any system which has a continuing dialogue with the user, for example, navigational instructions received through an audio link, interferes with the users ability to process ambient sounds. To solve this problem a novel Tactile User Guidance System (TUGS) with vibrating actuators, has been designed and experimentally tested. In this paper we present the design and experimental verification of TUGS with both visually impaired and sighted users. Although we have taken the visually impaired user as the ‘worst case scenario’ a practical ability to transfer information through the tactile sense has considerable value to other groups who may find themselves in restricted or overloaded visual or audio situations. These groups include; front line responders in the emergency services, railroad workers, pilots and remote vehicle operators...|$|R

The rapid and powerful artist necessarily looks with such contempt on those who seek minutiæ of detail rather than grandeur of impression, that it is almost impossible for him to conceive of the great last step in art, by which both become compatible. He has so often to dash the delicacy out of the pupil's work, and to blot the details from his encumbered canvas; so frequently to lament the loss of breadth and unity, and so seldom to reprehend the imperfection of minutiæ, that he necessarily looks upon complete parts as the very sign of error, weakness, and ignorance. Thus, frequently to the latest period of his life, he separates, like Sir Joshua, as chief enemies, the details and the whole, which an artist cannot be great unless he reconciles; and because details alone, and unreferred to a final purpose, are the sign of a tyro's work, he loses <b>sight</b> of the <b>remoter</b> truth, that details perfect in unity, and, contributing to a final purpose, are the sign of the production of a consummate master.|$|R

As the path was by no means a straight one, Peveril could not but admire the intimate acquaintance with the mazes which his singular companion displayed, as well as the boldness with which she traversed them. He himself was not so utterly void of the prejudices of the times, but that he contemplated, with some apprehension, the possibility of their intruding on the lair of the phantom hound, of which he had heard so often; and in every <b>remote</b> <b>sight</b> of the breeze among the ruins, he thought he heard him baying at the mortal footsteps which disturbed his gloomy realm. No such terrors, however, interrupted their journey; {{and in the course of}} a few minutes, they attained the deserted and now ruinous guard-house.

Fenella made a sign to Peveril to move with silence and caution, and then showed him, to his surprise, from the window of the deserted guard-room, a boat, for it was now high water, with four rowers, lurking under the cliff on which the castle was built; and made him farther sensible that he was to have access to it by a ladder of considerable height placed at the window of the ruin.|$|R

The first part of the manuscript deals with the specific characteristics of the verbal description which could affect the corresponding mental representation. Thus, the influence of the serial position effect on different types of verbal stimuli has been investigated in order to clarify whether people are able to remember all the information provided with a verbal description of an environment or systematically lose information positioned in the central part of the description. Then, the effect of the direction of the verbal description (Clockwise or Counterclockwise) on the recall performance/modality has been considered; I found that people prefers to recall spatial relations that are congruent with the description encoded, extending a well-established effect of memory congruency also to the domain of spatial representation. 	The second part of the thesis, instead, deals with the influence of physical movement on spatial updating within described environments. Even though several researchers focused on the role of movement in immediate and remote environments, only few of them investigated its role on verbally described environments; moreover, they mainly targeted their studies on imagined movements, rotation and translation, neglecting more ecological movements, such as physical walking. Thus, two separate experiments shed light on the contribution of physical walking compared to both physical and imagined rotation, on spatial updating – that is, the ability to keep track of the self-to-object relations during observer’s movement. By manipulating the movements required during the encoding of the description or after the description, results suggested different effects of the multisensory pattern of information provided by physical walking on spatial updating, depending on the situation in which the movements were executed. Finally, a third experiment, which used an ecological experimental procedure, examined the effectiveness of the physical exploration of an environment in fostering the development of an adequate spatial representation. 	In conclusion, the results provide further evidence for the effectiveness of adopting verbal material to describe an environment, and highlight the important role of the physical movements in enhancing people’s ability to successfully interact with the described environments...|$|R
