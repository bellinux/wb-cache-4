50|$|Some {{facilities}} feature 60 or 100 ampere circuits {{which have}} larger {{versions of the}} <b>stage</b> <b>pin</b> connector to match the higher current rating. Since it is unusual to require more than 20 amperes on a single circuit with modern lighting equipment, adapters may be made to convert a single 60 or 100 ampere <b>stage</b> <b>pin</b> connection to three to five 20 ampere <b>stage</b> <b>pin</b> connections. However, each downstream connection must be independently protected by a fuse or breaker to avoid exceeding the current rating of downstream cables and connectors.|$|E

50|$|The primary {{advantage}} of the <b>stage</b> <b>pin</b> connector over the NEMA 5-15 connector (commonly known as an Edison plug) {{is its ability to}} lie flat on a stage lessening the likelihood of being a trip hazard. In addition the <b>stage</b> <b>pin</b> connector has an increased durability and resistance to damage due to its more robust construction and the ability to compensate for wear with a pin splitter. Having a distinct connector designated for dimmable power also helps prevent confusion of dimmed and non-dimmed circuits which could lead to equipment damage. Even the smallest <b>stage</b> <b>pin</b> connectors are rated for 20 A, which translates to 2.4 kW at 120 V, compared to the 15 A and 1.8 kW of the NEMA 5-15.|$|E

60|$|It was a {{scorching}} {{afternoon on}} the heights above, where rocky slope and climbing firs ran far up towards the blue heavens under a blazing sun, but it was dim and cool in the misty depths of the cañon. There was eternal shadow in that tremendous rift, and a savage desolation rolled away from it; but on this afternoon the sounds of human activity rang along its dusky walls. The dull thud of axes fell from a gully that rent the mountain-side, and {{now and then a}} mass of shattered rock came crashing down, while the sharp clinking of the drills broke intermittently through the hoarse roar of the fall. Wet with the spray of the fall, Nasmyth, stripped to blue shirt and old duck trousers, stood swinging a heavy hammer, which he brought down upon the head of the steel bar that his companion held so many times a minute with rhythmic precision. Though they changed round now and then, he had done much the same thing since early morning, and his back and arms ached almost intolerably; but still the great hammer whirled about his head, and while he gasped with the effort, came down with a heavy jar upon the drill. So intent was he that he did not notice the three figures scrambling along the narrow log-work <b>staging</b> <b>pinned</b> against the rocky side above the fall, until his companion flung a word at him. Turning with a start, he dropped his hammer.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 69 - 70) This thesis {{describes the}} design, analysis, {{and performance of}} an automatic level control amplifier. The microwave automatic level control amplifier provides a constant output power level of + 10 dBm ?? 1 dB for a large dynamic range of input power of - 20 dBm to + 20 dBm. The automatic level control amplifier, which uses an uncomplicated feedback circuit, has a leveling response time of approximately 60 nanoseconds. The automatic level control amplifier consists of three RF gain <b>stages,</b> a <b>PIN</b> diode attenuator, a detector, a voltage regulator, and an operational amplifier.

40|$|The linear and {{non-linear}} internal friction, effective Young’s modulus, and amplitude-dependent modulus defect of a Ti 50 Ni 46. 1 Fe 3. 9 alloy {{have been}} studied after different heat treatments, affecting hydrogen content, at temperatures of 13 – 300 K, and frequencies near 90 kHz. It {{has been shown that}} the contamination of the alloy by hydrogen gives rise to an internal friction maximum in the R martensitic phase and a complicated <b>pinning</b> <b>stage</b> in the temperature dependence of the effective Young’s modulus at temperatures corresponding to the high-temperature side of the maximum. Dehydrogenation of the H-contaminated alloy transforms the internal friction maximum into a plateau and minimizes the <b>pinning</b> <b>stage.</b> The internal friction maximum is associated with a competition of two different temperature-dependent processes affecting the hydrogen concentration in the core regions of twin boundaries. The amplitude-dependent anelasticity of the R phase is also very sensitive to hydrogen content, its temperature dependence reflects the evolution of extended hydrogen atmospheres near twin boundaries. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Agaricus bisporus, grown under {{standard}} composting conditions, {{was evaluated}} {{for its ability}} to produce lignin-degrading peroxidases, which have been shown to have an integral role in lignin degradation by wood-rotting fungi. The activity of manganese peroxidase was monitored throughout the production cycle of the fungus, from the time of colonization of the compost through the development of fruit bodies. Characterization of the enzyme was done with a crude compost extract. Manganese peroxidase was found to have a pI of 3. 5 and a pH optimum of 5. 4 to 5. 5, with maximal activity during the initial <b>stages</b> of fruiting (<b>pin</b> <b>stage).</b> The activity declined considerably with fruit body maturation (first break). This apparent developmentally regulated pattern parallels that observed for laccase activity and for degradation of radiolabeled lignin and synthetic lignins by A. bisporus. Lignin peroxidase activity was not detected in the compost extracts. The correlation between the activities of manganese peroxidase and laccase and the degradation of lignin in A. bisporus suggests significant roles for these two enzymes in lignin degradation by this fungus...|$|R

In applications where cables are on the floor, the low profile of the connector allows for connections that are only slightly higher than the cables they connect.|$|E
50|$|Though {{the initial}} cost of {{constructing}} a 12/3 <b>stage</b> <b>pin</b> extension cable {{is higher than}} simply purchasing an equivalent Edison extension cable, the maintenance costs of the former are ultimately lower for several reasons. To begin with, less maintenance will be required {{as a result of}} the more rugged construction. When maintenance is required, many cable faults may be repaired by disassembling the connector, replacing broken components with spares acquired by cannibalizing other broken connectors, trimming away defective sections of cable, and reapplying the connector to the cable. This sort of repair is not usually possible with Edison connectors, particularly the factory-molded type. If a connector is beyond repair, a new <b>stage</b> <b>pin</b> connector is often less expensive than a replacement Edison connector when purchased from local vendors.|$|E
5000|$|The first <b>stage</b> <b>pin</b> {{connectors}} had two cylindrical pins, one for line (hot) {{and one for}} neutral, arranged symmetrically in {{a rectangular}} housing.

Later connectors (including those currently manufactured) use molded plastic or machined phenolic resin laminate housings [...]|$|E
25|$|The {{cultivated}} mushroom {{as well as}} the common field mushroom initially form a minute fruiting body, referred to as the <b>pin</b> <b>stage</b> because of their small size. Slightly expanded they are called buttons, once again because of the relative size and shape. Once such stages are formed, the mushroom can rapidly pull in water from its mycelium and expand, mainly by inflating preformed cells that took several days to form in the primordia.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, a {{conspiracy}} is afoot {{in the city}} to depose the Patrician, Lord Vetinari. The wealthy and powerful (but anonymous) Committee to Unelect the Patrician hire Mr. Pin and Mr. Tulip, a pair of villainous mercenaries from outside Ankh-Morpork known as the New Firm, to frame Vetinari with a <b>staged</b> embezzlement. <b>Pin</b> and Tulip manage to catch off-guard the normally impassible Patrician with Charlie, a witless Vetinari look-alike that they had previously kidnapped and forced to collaborate. The plan starts going south, though, when Drumknott, Vetinaris clerk returns in middle of the scene and the New Firm is forced to stab him and render Vetinari unconscious, hoping to also frame him for murder; their efforts are hampered by Lord Vetinari’s prized terrier, Wuffles, who manages to escape, not before having bitten Mr. Pin.|$|R
40|$|A {{commercial}} Al-Mg-Si alloy {{has been}} used for the present investigation. After tensile deformation at about 100 K modulus and decrement have been measured simultaneously between 100 and 400 K with a torsion pendulum. The internal friction effects were found to be not very reproducible from sample to sample. However, continuous dislocation pinning between 90 and 300 K and two <b>pinning</b> <b>stages</b> between 300 and 350 K were observed. The deformation-induced damping peaks appeared between 115 and 265 K. Their annealing behaviour has been investigated. All peaks disappeared after annealing at 400 K...|$|R
50|$|Though <b>stage</b> <b>pin</b> {{connectors}} {{are usually}} used {{in part to}} distinguish dimmed circuits from non-dimmed Edison circuits, newer theatrical installations may have several dimmed circuits that terminate in Edison outlets at various locations for convenience; thus {{care must be taken}} to avoid using these circuits for non-dimmable equipment. Connecting certain non-dimmable appliances or equipment to dimmed circuits may result in damage to the dimming equipment or the downstream device.|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{advantages}} of <b>stage</b> <b>pin</b> connectors, many smaller installations use Edison connectors due to their availability and the ease of connecting equipment to outlets already available in a building. This reduces refit costs, particularly when small portable dimming packs (often 4×1.2 kW channel models) are used. Such installations may also use inexpensive store-bought extension cables, though {{care must be taken}} to ensure that the ratings of such extension cables are not exceeded.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>stage</b> <b>pin</b> {{extension}} cables may {{be constructed}} from cable with {{six or more}} conductors. This cable can be fitted with multiple stage-pin connectors at either end enabling the single cable to carry multiple independent output channels of dimmed power. Each channel or circuit should have its own line, ground, and neutral conductor independent of the other circuits, though {{in some cases the}} ground or neutral lines may be shared among circuits.|$|E
30|$|Application of the {{external}} fixator follows. The pin guides are inserted into the clamps and tightened to keep them parallel. The first Kirschner wire is placed through its wire guide positioned anterior to the subtalar joint and flush with the subchondral talar bone {{in the direction of}} the sustentaculum tali. A second wire is placed in the lateral joint fragment using the same procedure, and now both the anterior and posterior fragments are held. Following fluoroscopic confirmation of the position of these wires, the first pin is inserted through the empty guide in the clamp either using a drill or manually. At this <b>stage</b> of <b>pin</b> placement in the calcaneum, varus or valgus deformity may be corrected by inserting a pin at an angle through the clamp to act as a support. Again by using the pins as a joystick, it is possible to achieve proper alignment of the body of the calcaneus with the articular fragment fixed to the first clamp.|$|R
30|$|The {{presence}} or absence of pin-track infection was determined during dressing change at the ward round. Redness or tenderness near a <b>pin</b> (<b>stage</b> 1) or serous discharge (stage 2) or seropurulent or purulent discharge (stage 3) was taken as evidence of infection. The above classification set aside grades 4 and 5 of the Dahl classification [20] (4  = osteolysis requiring pin removal and 5  = ring sequestrum requiring debridement) which we presume are representative of a complicated infection. Swabs were taken from any pin-site with serous, seropurulent and purulent discharge for microscopy, culture and sensitivity. Antibiotic therapy was recommenced in those patients with pin-track infection.|$|R
