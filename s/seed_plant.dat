25|$|The {{parentage}} information, however, {{does not}} reveal how old the grape variety is, i.e., when the pollination of a Mondeuse blanche vine by Dureza took place, {{leading to the}} original Syrah <b>seed</b> <b>plant.</b> In the year AD 77, Pliny the Elder wrote in his Naturalis Historia about the wines of Vienne (which today would be called Côte-Rôtie), where the Allobroges made famous and prized wine from a dark-skinned grape variety that had not existed some 50 years earlier, in Virgil's age. Pliny called the vines of this wine Allobrogica, {{and it has been}} speculated that it could be today's Syrah. However, the description of the wine would also fit, for example, Dureza, and Pliny's observation that vines of Allobrogica were resistant to cold is not entirely consistent with Syrah.|$|E
25|$|The {{large size}} of the monolete pollen of Macroneuropteris and other seed ferns {{suggests}} {{that they may not}} have been well adapted to wind dispersal. This raises speculation about the possibility of insect pollination. One of those possibilities is Arthropleura, a very large millipede of the carboniferous. Scott and Taylor (1983) studied seed-fern pollen on the plates of Arthropleura and thought they might have a role in pollination. W. A. Shear and others have noted that this is very unlikely due to the size of Arthropleura. Other insects of the carboniferous however may have been pollinators. The cycads, a modern <b>seed</b> <b>plant</b> with some similar affinities to seed ferns, were previously thought to only be pollinated by wind. New studies have confirmed the role of Thrips and other beetles in their pollination. This form of pollination is now known to be present {{as far back as the}} Cretaceous. A similar relationship may have occurred between these seed ferns and some carboniferous insects.|$|E
500|$|A {{very rare}} version of Riesling which has {{recently}} received more attention is Red Riesling (Roter Riesling). As the name suggests, {{this is a}} red-skinned clone of Riesling (a skin color commonly found for e.g. Gewürztraminer), but not a dark-skinned clone, i.e., {{it is still a}} white wine grape. It is considered a mutation of White Riesling, but some experts have suggested the opposite relationship, i.e., that Red Riesling could be the forerunner of White Riesling. Small amounts of Red Riesling are grown in Germany and Austria. In 2006, the Rheingau winery Fritz Allendorf planted what has been claimed to be the first commercial amounts of Red Riesling. To confuse matters, [...] "Red Riesling" [...] has also been used as a synonym for red-skinned Traminer grapes (such as the Savagnin rose of Klevener de Heiligenstein) and the obscure variety Hanns, which is a <b>seed</b> <b>plant</b> of Roter Veltliner.

2500|$|In Macroneuropteris, each {{individual}} leaflet or pinnule {{of the compound}} frond were also notably large. In fact, the species [...] M. scheuchzeri's pinnules were the largest of any <b>seed</b> <b>plant</b> of the Carboniferous Period. Individual pinnules are typically lanceolate with a round base. They {{have been found to}} be as long as 12cm. These individual leaflets are often found fossilized by themselves separated from the frond. They have been inferred by some to be deciduous. In the famous Mazon Creek Fossil Beds of Illinois, these leaflets are one of the most commonly found plant fossils. The leaves have thick cuticles, sunken stomata, dense trichomes, and large hair-like structures. These foliar characteristics combined with the spiny stem structure where the leaflets drop, and the potential deciduous nature have led to many authors suggesting a xeromorphic tendency in the tree. Such adaptations may have allowed the genus to dominate the late Carboniferous landscape as other plants like Lepidodendrales steadily declined.|$|E
