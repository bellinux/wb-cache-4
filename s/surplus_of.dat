5|$|Because {{the thyroid}} {{concentrates}} iodine, it also concentrates the various radioactive isotopes of iodine produced by nuclear fission. In {{the event of}} large accidental releases of such material into the environment, the uptake of radioactive iodine isotopes by the thyroid can, in theory, be blocked by saturating the uptake mechanism with a large <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> non-radioactive iodine, taken {{in the form of}} potassium iodide tablets. One consequence of the Chernobyl disaster was an increase in thyroid cancers in children in the years following the accident.|$|E
5|$|In March, Finance Minister Walter Harris, who was {{believed}} to be St. Laurent's heir apparent, introduced his budget. The budget anticipated a <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> $258million, of which $100million was to be returned in the form of increased welfare payments, with an increase of $6 per month (to a total of $46) for old age pensioners—effective after the election. Harris indicated that no more could be returned for fear of increasing inflation. Diefenbaker attacked the budget, calling for higher old age pensions and welfare payments, more aid to the poorer provinces, and aid to farmers.|$|E

5|$|The foreign {{exchange}} rules also oblige Icelandic residents to deposit any new foreign currency they receive with an Icelandic bank. There is anecdotal evidence that some Icelandic exporters had been operating an informal offshore {{foreign exchange}} market, trading pounds and euros for krónur outside {{the control of}} any regulator and starving the onshore market of foreign currency. Hence the Central Bank had to sell €124 million of currency reserves in November 2008 {{to make up the}} difference, compared with an estimated trade <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> €13.9 million.|$|E

Most Republicans preferred to maintain the rates, spend the surplus on internal improvements and eliminate some internal taxes.|$|E

The {{deficit was}} $55.6 billion in 2009 and was gradually lowered to $5.2 billion in 2013. In 2014, {{the federal budget}} was balanced with a <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> $1.9 billion.

Following the 2015 federal election and a change in government, the 2015 fiscal year ended in a $1 billion deficit instead. In 2010, Canada had the lowest debt-to-GDP ratio in the G7 economies. The Economist magazine stated that Canada had come out the recession stronger than any other rich country in the G7. In 2013, Canada came out with Global Markets Action Plan to generate employment opportunities for Canadians.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the US Government Accountability Office said a {{shortage}} of lithium-7 critical to the operation of 65 out of 100 American nuclear reactors “places their ability to continue to provide electricity at some risk”. The problem stems from the decline of US nuclear infrastructure. The equipment needed to separate lithium-6 from lithium-7 is mostly a cold war leftover. The US shut down most of this machinery in 1963, when it had a huge <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> separated lithium, mostly consumed during the twentieth century. The report {{said it would take}} five years and $10 million to $12 million to reestablish the ability to separate lithium-6 from lithium-7.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1700s, Francis Hauksbee and French chemist Charles François de Fay {{independently}} discovered {{what they believed}} were two kinds of frictional electricity—one generated from rubbing glass, the other from rubbing resin. From this, Du Fay theorized that electricity consists of two electrical fluids, vitreous and resinous, that are separated by friction, and that neutralize each other when combined. American scientist Ebenezer Kinnersley later also independently reached the same conclusion. A decade later Benjamin Franklin proposed that electricity was not from different types of electrical fluid, but a single electrical fluid showing an excess (+) or deficit (-). He gave them the modern charge nomenclature {{of positive and negative}} respectively. Franklin thought of the charge carrier as being positive, but he did not correctly identify which situation was a <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> the charge carrier, and which situation was a deficit.|$|E

5|$|Keynes {{contended that}} {{economic}} output is {{positively correlated with}} money velocity. He explained the relationship via changing liquidity preferences: people increase their money holdings during times of economic difficulty by reducing their spending, which further slows the economy. This paradox of thrift claimed that individual attempts to survive a downturn only worsen it. When the demand for money increases, money velocity slows. A slowdown in economic activities means markets might not clear, leaving excess goods to waste and capacity to idle. Turning the quantity theory on its head, Keynes argued that market changes shift quantities rather than prices. Keynes replaced the assumption of stable velocity with one of a fixed price-level. If spending falls and prices do not, the <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> goods reduces the need for workers and increases unemployment.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the canals}} were {{owned by the}} London and North Western Railway, {{restrictions}} were imposed on what they could carry, and the canals failed to make sufficient money to cover the interest on mortgages. However, they made a substantial operating profit for some years. Around 1850, the average annual income was £104,638, which yielded a <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> £45,885. Most of the income was from carrying, and by 1870, income had risen to £143,976, although this only yielded a <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> £11,727. Total traffic was 855,462 tons in 1858, but this had dropped to 742,315 tons in 1868. The carrying business was expanded in the 1870s, but although turnover increased, operating profits fell dramatically, to just £1,568 in 1876. By 1905, total traffic was 469,950 tons, nearly all of it in boats owned by the company, and between the 1870s and {{the onset of the}} First World War the company sometimes made a small operating profit and sometimes a loss. Following the end of the war, working hours were cut, wages increased, and the cost of materials increased. Losses escalated, to £153,318 on an income of £227,845 in 1920, and carriage by the company ceased in 1921, in an attempt to reduce losses. 433,230 tons of goods carried in 1929 had dropped to 151,144 tons in 1940, by which time income from tolls was £17,763, and total income was £40,985.|$|E
