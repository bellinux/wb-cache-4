5|$|Four {{members of}} the same family were killed in Alkozai. According to a 16-year-old boy who was shot in the leg, Bales woke up his family members before {{shooting}} them. Another witness said <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> man drag a woman out of her house and repeatedly hit her head against a wall.|$|E
5|$|A Miss Williams {{from nearby}} Borley Lodge said <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> {{figure of the}} ghostly nun in the upstairs window and, {{according}} to Harry Price, demanded a fee of one guinea for her story. In August 1943, Price conducted a brief dig in the cellars of the ruined house and discovered two bones thought to be of a young woman. The bones were given a Christian burial in Liston churchyard, after the parish of Borley refused to allow the ceremony to take place {{on account of the}} local opinion that the bones found were those of a pig.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that the anti-Semitic passages in her memoir were intended to be used as evidence that she was not Jewish; alternatively, she may have been influenced by Ezra Pound's anti-Semitic radio broadcasts. Whatever the case, she did help a Jewish couple escape Italy, providing passage on a ship to the United States. By {{the end of the war}} her sympathies had again changed, and <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> Allies as liberators.|$|E

Stooping, <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>the</b> grass was bloody. Following the drops and smears, <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>the</b> watery margin of the bank was bloody. Following the current with her eyes, <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> a bloody face turned up towards the moon, and drifting away.|$|R
60|$|Had Lydia and {{her mother}} known the {{substance}} of her conference with her father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility. In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness. <b>She</b> <b>saw,</b> with <b>the</b> creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers. <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> herself <b>the</b> object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present unknown. <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> all <b>the</b> glories of the camp--its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with {{the young and the}} gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete <b>the</b> view, <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once.|$|R

5|$|When Genelia {{was offered}} a role in Tujhe Meri Kasam, {{initially}} she turned it down, as she was not keen {{to pursue a career}} in acting. But the crew insisted and kept contacting her for two months, and she agreed when <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> Telugu version of the movie. Tamil director, S. Shankar, was impressed with her performance in the Parker Pen commercial and decided to cast her in a leading role in his 2003 Tamil film Boys. Genelia was selected among 300 girls, who had auditioned for the movie. She signed three movies simultaneously in three different languages, Tujhe Meri Kasam (Hindi), Boys (Tamil), and Satyam (Telugu).|$|E
5|$|At dinner, Randyll insults Sam's bookishness, weight, {{and lack}} of {{fighting}} prowess. Gilly defends Sam, mentioning that Sam killed a Thenn and a White Walker. When Sam's brother Dickon insists that White Walkers don't exist, Gilly declares that <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> act herself, but in doing so reveals her Wildling heritage. Disgusted, Randyll further insults Sam and Gilly, prompting Melessa and Talla {{to leave the room}} with Gilly in anger. Randyll tells Sam that Gilly and Little Sam can remain at Horn Hill, but that he must never set foot in Horn Hill again. Sam bids farewell to Gilly, but then changes his mind and decides to bring her and Little Sam with him to the Citadel. As they leave, Sam takes House Tarly's ancestral Valyrian steel sword, Heartsbane, as well.|$|E
5|$|Dalton {{applied the}} logic of abolitionism {{to the cause of}} women's freedom. She said that just as no one should be made a slave because of their race, women should not have to be subservient because of their gender. <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> Victorian ideals for women in {{marriage}} as part of that slavish subservience. She argued that since a woman loses all her property when she marries, that it would be more advantageous for her to not officially marry so she could still buy and sell land and have legal claim over her own children and her own body. Dalton also argued that new brides should be allowed to decide when they have their first child. Some of her ideas were surprisingly radical for a Mormon woman at the time, and she and Elizabeth Cady Stanton agreed that women needed to protect themselves from unjust laws.|$|E

5|$|The trial {{ended with}} Lhermitte {{receiving}} the maximum sentence {{for the murder}} of her five children. The court and the jury did not take any extenuating circumstances into account. In her closing argument, Lhermitte said she would accept any punishment the court gave her and showed remorse for her actions. Earlier in the trial, psychiatrists had found that Lhermitte was not of sound mind when she committed the acts and should not be held accountable for her actions. They felt that she should be admitted into a psychiatric institution rather than going to prison, but the jury did not follow their opinions. Lhermitte had been battling with depression for many years. She concluded that <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> murder of her children and committing suicide as her only way out.|$|E
5|$|Harold is escorted {{back to the}} {{psychiatric}} center where he is tormented by Nurse Innes (Nancy Fish). Later, Mulder finds Innes lying on the floor, half-conscious. Innes claims Harold went berserk and attacked her. One of the other patients, Chuck Forsch, tells Scully that Nurse Innes was trying to poison Harold. Scully slowly realizes that Innes, not Harold, {{was responsible for the}} murders. When Innes attacks Scully with a scalpel, Scully draws her weapon and fires, striking her in the shoulder. While summarizing the case with Mulder, Scully explains that Innes had been taking Harold's unused medication, triggering violent and unpredictable behavior. Scully hypothesizes that Innes committed the murders in order to destroy the love Harold felt towards the young women. Later, Harold's body is discovered in a nearby alley, the apparent victim of respiratory failure. Scully, however, suspects that Harold died from what Innes took away from him. Scully admits to Mulder that <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> ghost of the fourth victim shortly after she was murdered. Later, Scully sees Harold's spirit sitting {{in the back seat of}} her car.|$|E
5|$|The White House's {{most famous}} alleged {{apparition}} {{is that of}} Abraham Lincoln. Eleanor Roosevelt never admitted to having seen Lincoln's ghost, but did say that she felt his presence repeatedly throughout the White House. Mrs. Roosevelt {{also said that the}} family dog, Fala, would sometimes bark for no reason at what she felt was Lincoln's ghost. President Dwight Eisenhower's press secretary, James Hagerty, and Liz Carpenter, press secretary to First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, both said they felt Lincoln's presence many times. The former president's footsteps are also said to be heard in the hall outside the Lincoln Bedroom. As reputable an eyewitness as Lillian Rogers Parks admitted in her autobiography My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House that she had heard them. Margaret Truman, daughter of President Harry S. Truman, said she heard a specter rapping {{at the door of the}} Lincoln Bedroom when she stayed there, and believed it was Lincoln. President Truman himself was once wakened by raps at the door while spending a night in the Lincoln Bedroom. Others have actually seen an apparition of the former president. The first person reported to have actually seen Lincoln's spirit was First Lady Grace Coolidge, who said <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> ghost of Lincoln standing at a window in the Yellow Oval Room staring out at the Potomac. Winston Churchill, Theodore Roosevelt, and Maureen Reagan and her husband have all claimed to have seen a spectral Lincoln in the White House. A number of staff members of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration claimed to have seen Lincoln's spirit, and on one occasion Roosevelt's personal valet ran screaming from the White House claiming he had seen Lincoln's ghost. Perhaps the most famous incident was in 1942 when Queen Wilhelmina of The Netherlands heard footsteps outside her White House bedroom and answered a knock on the door, only to see Lincoln in frock coat and top hat standing in front of her (she promptly fainted). Several unnamed eyewitnesses have claimed to have seen the shade of Abraham Lincoln actually lying down on the bed in the Lincoln Bedroom (which was used as a meeting room at the time of his administration), and others have seen Lincoln sit on the edge of the bed and put his boots on. The most famous eyewitness to the latter was Mary Eben, Eleanor Roosevelt's secretary, who saw Lincoln pulling on his boots (after which she ran screaming from the room).|$|E

25|$|The {{opponents to}} the Patriotic Party were mostly grouped in the Hetmans' Party (Stronnictwo hetmańskie), and {{included}} Hetmans Stanisław Szczęsny Potocki, Franciszek Ksawery Branicki and Seweryn Rzewuski. They formed the Targowica Confederation {{in defense of}} the traditional Golden Liberties and the Cardinal Laws, and called on the Russian Empire for assistance. Empress Catherine II of Russia readily obliged, as <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> Constitution as a threat to Russian influence in the Commonwealth, and a possible long-term danger to absolute monarchy in Russia itself.|$|E
25|$|Sage {{moved to}} Paris in March 1937 and rented a luxurious {{apartment}} there.

She was especially {{struck by the}} paintings of Italian artist Giorgio de Chirico, which featured what Magdalena Holzhey, in a book devoted to de Chirico, calls “empty squares and receding depths, shadowy arcades and soaring towers.” Sage bought one of de Chirico’s paintings, La Surprise, and kept it all her life.|$|E
