Paxton placed three of these 8' x 24' roof units side-by-side, horizontally supported by a grid of cast iron beams, which was held up on slim cast iron pillars.

40|$|The {{ribozyme}} from bacterial ribonuclease P recognizes two <b>structural</b> <b>modules</b> in a tRNA substrate: the T stem-loop and the acceptor stem. These two modules {{are connected}} through a helical linker. The T stem-loop binds at a surface confined in a folding domain {{away from the}} active site. Substrates for the Bacillus subtilis RNase P RNA were previously selected in vitro that are shown to bind comparably well or better than a tRNA substrate. Chemical modification of P RNA-substrate complexes with dimethylsulfate and kethoxal was performed {{to determine how the}} P RNA recognizes three in vitro selected substrates. All three substrates bind at the surface known to interact with the T stem-loop of tRNA. Similar to a tRNA, the secondary structure of these substrates contains a helix around the cleavage site and a hairpin loop at the corresponding position of the T stem-loop. Unlike a tRNA, these two <b>structural</b> <b>modules</b> are connected through a non-helical linker. The two <b>structural</b> <b>modules</b> in the tRNA and in the selected substrates bind to two different domains in P RNA. The properties of substrate recognition exhibited by this ribozyme may be exploited to isolate new ribozyme-substrate pairs with interactive <b>structural</b> <b>modules...</b>|$|R

50|$|Clathrin {{heavy chain}} is often {{described}} as a leg, with subdomains, representing the foot (the N-terminal domain), followed by the ankle, distal leg, knee, proximal leg, and trimerization domains. The N-terminal domain consists of a seven-bladed β-propeller structure. The other domains form a super-helix of short alpha helices. This was originally determined from the structure of the proximal leg domain that identified and is composed of a smaller <b>structural</b> <b>module</b> referred to as clathrin heavy chain repeat motifs. The light chains bind primarily to the proximal leg portion of the heavy chain with some interaction near the trimerization domain. The β-propeller at the 'foot' of clathrin contains multiple binding sites for interaction with other proteins.|$|E

Installation of CA-01 was long delayed due to both regulatory and production hurdles related to the module. It is the first of the US AP1000 reactors under construction to achieve placement of this critical module, beating Vogtle Unit 3 to this milestone, and allowing other construction activities in the Nuclear Island to progress that could not proceed until the module was in place. CA-01 is a large <b>structural</b> <b>module</b> that forms the internal structures of some compartments within the Containment Vessel, including the Steam Generator compartments, Reactor Vessel cavity, and Refueling Canal. The CA-01 Module is the heaviest module on site, weighing 1,200 tons, or 2.4 million pounds.
