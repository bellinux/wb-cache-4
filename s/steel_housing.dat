2500|$|During development, the Mark C had {{utilised}} {{the same}} sliding pillar suspension {{on the rear}} as the Mark B, but by September 1952, this had been changed for Flexitor suspension units produced by George Spencer Moulton & Co. Ltd. The Flexitor units were a type of lever arm shock absorber which used bonded rubber in torsion as the shock absorber. On these units a stub axle is mounted upon a trailing-arm with the pivot point being a steel rod. This rod is bonded inside a rubber tube which runs through and is also bonded to an external <b>steel</b> <b>housing.</b> The housing is bolted to {{the underside of the}} car. The units provide about [...] of vertical movement to each independent rear axle.|$|E

50|$|The {{core of the}} M134D was a <b>steel</b> <b>housing</b> {{and steel}} rotor. To focus on weight reduction, a {{titanium}} housing and rotor were introduced, creating the M134D-T. This reduced weight from 62 lb to 41 lb. The gun housing had a 500,000 round lifespan before it wore out, which was higher than a conventional machine gun's 40,000 round lifespan but was a reduced time for a rotary gun. A hybrid of the two weapons resulted in the M134D-H, which had a <b>steel</b> <b>housing</b> and titanium rotor. It was cheaper with the steel component, was only one pound (450 grams) heavier than the M134D-T, and had an increased lifespan of 1 million rounds. The M134D-H is currently in use on various 160th Regiment platforms.|$|E

50|$|To {{avoid any}} risk of explosion, the {{sensitive}} element is usually enclosed in a wire mesh housing.

50|$|Laiyuan had a <b>steel</b> <b>housing,</b> {{divided into}} 66 {{waterproof}} compartments filled with cork, a single smokestack, and single mast. Her belt armor had a thickness of 5.5 to 9.5 in {{but did not}} extend above the waterline or to the extremities of the hull, and was 8 in at the conning tower and barbettes. Her deck armor had a thickness of 2.5 to 3 in at the extremities. The prow was reinforced for ramming. The power plant was a double expansion reciprocating steam engine with four cylindrical boilers, driving two screws.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>steel</b> <b>housing</b> of {{the seat}} valve pump {{contains}} four hydraulically controlled seat valves, two suction and two delivery valves for the two hydraulic cylinders. The suction and discharge valves are synchronized with the hydraulics of the delivery pistons - this ensures that {{the contents of the}} delivery cylinder is equal at all times to the volume being pumped. Once the [...] "sucking" [...] piston reaches its end position, the corresponding suction or delivery valve is simultaneously closed or opened. If there is overpressure in the delivery line, the suction valve will close first. This prevents the pumped medium from being pushed out of the pressure line back into the hopper.|$|E
