However, although most LDCs gain (10 out of 13), most non-LDCs (about 60 %) lose. The overall welfare effect relative to GDP tends to be very small, whether positive or negative.

The agency should favour more thorough inspections than existing theory suggests, particularly in sectors where the <b>scope</b> <b>for</b> such <b>substitution</b> is great. Moreover, when monitorability adjusts only sluggishly to policy shocks (because it is an embodied characteristic of capital, for example) the environmental impacts of increased frequency and increased thoroughness well over- and under-shoot their respective long-run impacts.

Thus, in nature, substitution is most likely to be observed in intermediate-sized birds and mammals experiencing intermediate ambient temperatures. Activity-thermoregulatory heat substitution may be an important determinant of the activity patterns and metabolic ecology of endotherms. For example, a pattern of widely varying field metabolic rates (FMR) at low latitudes that converges to higher and less variable FMR at high latitudes has been interpreted as suggesting that warm environments at low latitudes allow a greater variety of feasible metabolic niches than do cool, high-latitude environments. However, activity-thermoregulatory heat substitution will generate this pattern of latitudinal FMR variation even if endotherms from cold and warm climates are metabolically and behaviorally identical, because the metabolic rates of resting and active animals are more similar in cold than in warm environments. Activity-thermoregulatory heat substitution is an understudied aspect of endotherm thermal biology that is apt to be a major influence on the physiological, behavioral and ecological responses of free-ranging endotherms to variation in temperature...|$|E

40|$|This {{report is}} {{addressed}} at modelling energy-economy interactions in small developing countries, those with populations less than 20 {{million or so}} and where neither the industrial or energy sectors are dominant. The overall objectives of the research were {{to learn more about}} how energy-economy interactions can be usefully modelled for policy purposes, to compare {{the pros and cons of}} alternative methods which have been used previously, and to test the feasibility of utilizing simple general equilibrium models by constructing an illustrative model for Sri Lanka. Various approaches to energy policy analysis [...] project evaluation, technology assessment, energy sector assessment, macro simulation models, economy-wide optimization models, and computable general equilibrium models [...] are surveyed and critically reviewed. A major deficiency of all but the latter two is their failure to account for the important two-way interactions between energy and the rest of the economy which are common in developing countries. The latter models are general in scope and can include the important energy-economy relationships. Since the computable general equilibrium models are somewhat easier to formulate and solve, they seen most appropriate for the type of countries under consideration. These types of models can analyze a large number of interrelated issues such as: the impact of energy costs and prices on aggregate growth and its sectoral composition; the relationship between energy imports, investment rates, and the balance of payments; the <b>scope</b> <b>for</b> <b>substitution</b> between energy and other factors of substitution; and the effect of energy prices on income distribution and employment. The Sri Lanka model is meant to illustrate how a simple computable general equilibrium model focussing on these issues can be built rather quickly in a situation with substantial data limitations. The model was constructed with data from existing sources, supplemented by some minimal econometric estimation, and was designed to run on a personal computer. The model includes eleven sectors: (1) paddy and other annual agricultural crops; (2) tree crops; (3) industry; (4) transportation: (5) housing; (6) services; (7) refined petroleum products; (8) electricity; (9) non-competing imports; (10) crude oil: and (11) traditional fuels. Prices determine factor allocations, production, and final demands. Trade flows are adjusted to ensure that total supply equals total usage. For the tradable goods, prices are exogenous. Electricity prices also are set by government policy. The model calculates prices for transportation and housing which insure supply/demand equilibrium for these non-traded sectors. The model is "closed" by specifying a rule for relating aggregate investment and the balance of payments deficit to national income (GDP). In some cases, the trade deficit is fixed in terms of GDP, and in others aggregate investment is fixed as a share of national income. Starting from a base year of 1983, the model simulates developments through 1989. Several alternative solutions are discussed to demonstrate how parametric changes can show the sensitivity of key variables to changes in prices, economic policy, and the external environment.

40|$|Carbonatite magmas {{characteristically}} expel fluids {{into the}} surrounding country rock, creating metasomatised alkali-rich fenite aureoles. This thesis examines evidence for the mobility ofhigh field strength elements (HFSE), including the rare earth elements (REE), niobium and zirconium into these fenite aureoles {{in order to provide}} a better understanding of element mobilisation, transportation and precipitation. The study is timely because the REE and Nb are recognised as critical metals. The REE, in particular, are used in green technologies, and have grown in importance in recent years. The combination of the concentration of REE mines in China, associated export restrictions and a severely limited <b>scope</b> <b>for</b> <b>substitution</b> of these elements, has highlighted the challenges of securing adequate supplies and of a better management of resources, together with the need for an improved knowledge of the processes by which mineral deposits are enriched to economic grade. The approach used here was to study fenite aureoles around two Cretaceous carbonatite complexes at Chilwa Island and Kangankunde in the Chilwa Alkaline Province of southern Malawi by re-examining samples held in the collections of the Natural History Museum, London (BM 1968 P 37 and BM 1957 1056). The geology of the complexes had already been well described by M. Garson and A. Woolley but the results of recent studies elsewhere suggested that it should now be possible to explore the fenitising process in more detail. Kangankunde is a rare earth-rich ferroan dolomite carbonatite, subject to active exploration for the REE. Chilwa Island contains a wider range of carbonatites, including apatite-, magnetite-bearing calcitic carbonatite, and REE mineral-bearing ankeritic and sideritic carbonatites. The presence ofassociated silicate rocks is minor at both these complexes. Samples were selected from across the fenite aureoles to represent areas of differing intensity and style of metasomatism. Whole-rock analyses were made to assess compositional changes across the aureole. Mineralogical studies by SEM-EDS, EPMA, LA-ICP-MS and SEM cathodoluminescence permitted the identification of mineral assemblages, the establishment of paragenetic sequences and also the characterisation of the REE compositions in apatite, zircon and the RE-bearing minerals from zones of varying degrees of alteration within the aureole. Fluid properties were further explored by fluid inclusion studies of secondary inclusions in the country rock quartz. Apatite and zircon in the fenite were dated by fission track analysis and a U-Pb LA-lCP-MS method, respectively, to determine their relationships with the carbonatite. At both complexes, fenite rocks contain micro-assemblages of minerals visible by backscattered electron imaging but not reported in previous studies. Examples include the assemblages of zircon, ilmenite, rutile, apatite and monazite found in veins of up to 500 um width in the sodi-potassic outer fenite at Chilwa Island, and the associations of strontianite, RE-minerals and carbonates in mm-sized veins in the more highly metasomatised parts of the aureole at Kangankunde. Alteration and dissolution-precipitation reactions seen in these micro-assemblages suggest that multiple fluid events occurred in the fenite aureole. The presence of alkaline minerals (aegirine, albite, K-feldspar, arfvedsonite) indicates pervasive fenitisation by fluids expelled from the carbonatite over distances of more than a kilometre. The micro-assemblages provide evidence that fluids were able to mobilise, transport and precipitate the HFSE and REE outwards over a similar distance into the country rock but that for the REE this event followed an earlier fenitisation by alkaline fluids. It is likely that fluids from more than one carbonatite have contributed to the variation in mineralogy and mineral composition. Fenite rocks and minerals have lower light REE:heavy REE ratios than those of the carbonatites in the core of the complexes. This cannot be explained by simple mixing between carbonatite and country rock end members, and fractionation of the REE during fluid transport is therefore invoked with relative preferential mobilisation and deposition of the mid to heavy REE. Zircon and apatite in the mineral assemblages at Chilwa Island appear petrographically to be co-eval. However, although fission track dating confirmed a carbonatitic age of c. 130 Ma for apatite, the U-Pb dating of associated zircon produced ages of between 520 and 770 Ma and so zircon must be part of the original country rock rather than having co-precipitated with apatite. In the less altered fenites, zircon is stable, and at Chilwa Island, appears to encourage the nucleation of carbonatite-derived mineral assemblages. In contrast, zircon is unstable in higher- grade fenite at both complexes where metasomatising fluids were most intense. Zirconium is thus released from highly altered rocks and, rather than forming alkali zirconosilicates as happens in alkaline complexes, it appears to be transported outwards and is re-precipitated as a secondary, sub-micron zircon population in low- grade fenite. Interpretative models require the ingress of multiple fluids at each complex. Early alkaline fluids were more extensive and predominantly sodic. Later potassic fluids produced more intensive alteration in the inner aureole. The mineral assemblages were precipitated in veins in the aureole by fluids carrying the REE, which were expelled in multiple episodes from the different carbonatites at each complex, both before and after alteration by potassic fluids. At Chilwa Island, modelling suggests that early REE mineralisation in the fenite rocks from the outer carbonatites of the complex occurred after pervasive initial alkaline alteration by sodic fluids. This was overprinted by intense potassic alteration in the innermost fenites. The subsequent relative MREE and HREE enrichment in the aureole is attributed to fluids from the late-stage carbonatites. At Kangankunde, fluid events produced the same pattern of alkaline alteration followed by HFSE mineralisation, but here enrichment in the MREE and HREE occurred early, after the sodic alteration, with later fluids precipitating minerals with higher LREE:HREE ratios and substantial carbonate. As at Chilwa Island, the distinct characteristics of each mineralising fluid show that it is likely they were expelled from different carbonatites in the complex...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the impact on}} a sample of 34 African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries of eliminating tariffs on imports from the EU under Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), considering trade, welfare and revenue effects. Even assuming ‘immediate’ complete elimination of all tariffs on imports from the EU, some two-thirds of ACP countries are likely to experience welfare gains; the ACP overall and the average ACP country gain. The overall welfare effect relative to GDP tends to be very small, whether positive or negative. While potential tariff revenue losses are non-negligible, given that countries have at least ten years in which to implement the tariff reductions, there is <b>scope</b> <b>for</b> tax <b>substitution.</b> An important issue is identifying the sensitive products (SPs) to be excluded from tariff reduction. We exclude products where ACP imports compete with the EU (as SPs have to be agreed at the regional ACP level). In general, excluding SPs on these criteria reduced the welfare gain (or increased the welfare loss) compared to estimates where no products are excluded. It remains {{the case that the}} ACP overall and on average gains, although only 13 countries (38 %) experience a net gain in this scenario (but for another nine the net effect is zero or almost zero). This is to be expected as if ACP products are excluded as SPs the potential trade creation gains are reduced. However, as the exclusion criterion was products that are traded between ACP countries, these import losses would be offset by gains to ACP exporting countries. Perhaps the most surprising result is that even where EPAs imply a welfare loss (on imports), the losses are likely to be very small.

We make use of the GTAP-W model, distinguishing between rainfed and irrigated land and irrigation water as input factors in agricultural production. We assess the scope of market adaptation to climate change by comparing the CGE results with the direct agricultural damage costs estimated using hydrological and crop growth models. We find considerable <b>scope</b> <b>for</b> market adaptation in that total economic impacts on agriculture are much lower when accounting <b>for</b> <b>substitution</b> effects and cross-sectoral and cross-country interlinkages, while the impact on the nonagricultural sectors becomes larger when these substitution effects and interlinkages are accounted for...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to, based on {{qualitative}} interviews with managers and group interviews with care providers, understand their interpretation of integrity and also their <b>scope</b> <b>for</b> action to satisfy disable people’s integrity at sheltered housing for adults. The questions of this study are: How do the managers and the care providers interpret the concept of integrity? Which <b>scope</b> <b>for</b> action do they have to satisfy the integrity of disabled people? Method: Individual – and group interviews have been used as methods to gather empirical data. Theory: The theories of <b>scope</b> <b>for</b> action and integrity as a theoretical conception have been used to analyze the empirical material. Results: The informants of this study found it difficult to give a specific definition of integrity. The main aspects we could distinguish were that integrity was interpreted as a personal sphere and self-determination. The result of this study shows that the <b>scope</b> <b>for</b> action to satisfy the integrity of disabled people is affected by many factors. First of all the <b>scope</b> <b>for</b> action is affected by the Swedish law LSS and the assignment within the organization. The <b>scope</b> <b>for</b> action is also affected by individual adaption for each person. This study shows the importance of the relationship between the managers, care providers and the persons. At last the informants emphasize some dilemmas in their <b>scope</b> <b>for</b> action to satisfy the integrity...|$|R
