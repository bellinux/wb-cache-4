In the cotreatment studies, the cells were exposed to NaVO 3 (50, 100 and 200 μ M) in the presence of nontox- ic concentrations of ZnCl 2 (5 μ M) or Na 2 SeO 3 (0. 5 μ M). Following 24 h incubation, the cell viability (assessed in MTT assay) and reactive oxygen species generation were evaluated. Our data suggest that zinc and selenium, in the concentrations mentioned above, provide no protection against adverse actions induced by <b>sodium</b> <b>metavanadate</b> at concentration levels of 50, 100 and 200 μ M. To our knowledge, this is the first report from in vitro studies on interaction between pentavalent vanadium and trace elements that function as antioxidants: zinc and selenium...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} 1, 10, or 40 micrograms/ml of vanadium, given {{for six or}} seven months as <b>sodium</b> <b>metavanadate</b> in {{drinking}} water on cardiovascular and biochemical variables and the electrolyte metabolism of male Sprague-Dawley rats were investigated. At {{the end of the}} exposure period, all animals exposed to vanadate had increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure. This effect was not dose dependent and heart rate and cardiac inotropism were not affected. The role of defective renal function and electrolyte metabolism in such effects was supported, in the rats exposed to 10 and 40 ppm of vanadium, by the following changes: (a) decreased Na, + K(+) -ATPase activity in the distal tubules of nephrons; (b) increased urinary excretion of potassium; (c) increase in plasma renin activity and urinary kallikrein, kininase I, and kininase II activities; (d) increased plasma aldosterone (only in the rats treated with 10 ppm of vanadium). The alterations in the rats exposed to 1 ppm of vanadium were: (a) reduced urinary calcium excretion; (b) reduced urinary kallikrein activity; (c) reduced plasma aldosterone. These results suggest that blood hypertension in rats exposed to vanadate depends on specific mechanisms of renal toxicity related to the levels of exposure...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} of a dual-cell, non-linear dielectric spectrometer is described. The system {{is applied to the}} study of resting cell suspensions of S. cerevisiae. Substantial harmonics are generated by these cells when stimulated by very modest exciting fields (ca. * 2 V cm- ‘, 20 Hz). The generation of these harmonics occurs only in living cells, and in a cell concentration-dependent manner. We studied the 3 rd harmonic in detail. The ability to generate this harmonic is observable only within rather narrow voltage and frequency windows. The generation of a third harmonic is strongly inhibited by low concentrations of <b>sodium</b> <b>metavanadate,</b> suggesting that it may be ascribed largely to the H+-ATPase present in the plasma membranes of these cells. When the enzyme is not at static head, the 3 rd harmonic disappears and strong second and 4 th harmonics may be observed. Non-linear dielectric spectroscopy constitutes a powerful and convenient means by which to monitor the ability of living cells to transduce exogenous electric field energy. This type of transduction may serve to account for the many reports of the ability of very weak electromagnetic fields to affect biological activity...|$|E
40|$|The {{alterations}} in the levels/activities of selected biomarkers for detecting kidney toxicity {{and in the}} levels of some oxidative stress (OS) markers and elements were studied in male rats to evaluate biochemically the degree of kidney damage, investigate the role of OS in the mechanism of functional renal disorders, reveal potential biomarkers of renal function, and assess the renal mineral changes in the conditions of a 12 -week <b>sodium</b> <b>metavanadate</b> (SMV, 0. 125 [*]mg[*]V/mL) exposure. The results showed that OS {{is involved in the}} mechanism underlying the development of SMV-induced functional renal disturbances. They also suggest that the urinary cystatin C (CysCu) and kidney injury molecule- 1 (KIM- 1 u) could be the most appropriate to evaluate renal function at the conditions of SMV intoxication when the fluid intake, excreted urinary volume (EUV), body weight (BW), and the urinary creatinine excretion (Creu) decreased. The use of such tests as the urinary lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, γ-glutamyltranspeptidase, and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (LDHu, ALPu, GGTPu, and NAGu) seems not to be valid given their reduced activities. The use of only traditional biomarkers of renal function in these conditions may, in turn, be insufficient because their alterations are greatly influenced by the changes in the fluid intake and/or BW...|$|E
40|$|Here, we {{demonstrate}} that in HeLa cells, Ser 317 of Chk 1 undergoes phosphorylation {{in response to}} replication stress induced by hydroxyurea. We also demonstrate the existence of constitutive (interphase and mitotic) Chk 1 kinase phosphorylation, the translocation of its phosphorylated form from the nucleus to cytoplasm in prometaphase as well as strong labeling of apoptotic nuclei with α-Chk 1 S 317 antibodies. Additionally, we show that caffeine, 2 -aminopurine, staurosporine and <b>sodium</b> <b>metavanadate</b> can induce premature chromosome condensation (PCC) by the abrogation of the S-M checkpoint. Staurosporine {{appeared to be the}} most effective PCC inductor, and {{as in the case of}} the remaining inductors, the addition of hydroxyurea each time brought about an increase in the number of cells showing PCC symptoms (synergic effect). The forced premature mitosis was accompanied by an increasing index of double-strand breaks marked by the phosphorylation of histone H 2 AX on Ser 139. Moreover, we found that the chemicals used brought about minor actin and tubulin network rearrangements that occurred following either replication stress or drug-induced cell cycle delay. At the same time, it was found that the extent of the cytoskeleton rearrangement did not hinder PCC in all its subperiods, i. e., from PCC-type prophase to PCC-type telophase...|$|E
40|$|Two {{methods are}} {{described}} for determination of captopril in pure form and in tablets. In titrimetric method, an aliquot {{of the drug}} solution containing 1 - 10 mg {{of the sample was}} allowed to react with a large excess of <b>sodium</b> <b>metavanadate</b> in HCl medium, and after the redox reaction, vanadium(IV) produced was titrated with cerium(IV) sulphate solution using ferroin indicator and in the presence of acetone catalyst. The spectrophotometric procedure involves the oxidation of the drug with vanadate in acetic acid medium and determination of vanadium(IV) by interacting with ferroin. The resulting ferroin was measured at 510 nm and correlated to drug concentration. Different variables affecting the reaction between captopril and vanadate, and subsequent determination of vanadium(IV) were studied and optimised. In titrimetry, the reaction stoichiometry was established. At 510 nm, the Beer's law is obeyed over 2. 5 - 20 mug ml(- 1) of captopril. The apparent molar absorptivity was 7. 31 x 10 (- 3) l mol(- 1) cm(- 1) and the Sandell sensitivity was 29. 74 ng cm(- 2). The limits of detection and quantification were 0. 18 and 0. 60 mug ml(- 1), respectively. Excipients used as additives in tablets did not interfere in the proposed procedures. The procedures were successfully applied to the determination of captopril in tablets and the results were statistically evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Hydroxy Citric Acid (HCA) {{is found}} to be the major organic acid present in the fruits of Garcinia cambogia plant. Recently it {{has been found to be}} used as a potent {{metabolic}} regulator of obesity and lipid abnormalities in mammalian system. HCA is isolated from Garcinia cambogia fruit extract and subjected to various modern analytical techniques for identifying and characterizing the active constituent. The ? max was obtained at 204 nm when the solution of isolated HCA was scanned between 200 - 400 nm. The structure of HCA was assessed by observing the characteristic frequency band in IR spectrum. HCA was identified by observing the orange spot on paper chromatography and TLC using 1 % <b>Sodium</b> <b>metavanadate</b> spraying reagent and the Rf values were observed at 0. 26 and 0. 35 respectively. The isolated HCA was subjected to HPTLC analysis and obtained graph was compared with standard HCA drug. Content of HCA present in the plant extract has been found to be in the range of 42 - 44 %by using isocratic elution in RP-HPLC with 0. 01 M Sulfuric acid as mobile phase with a flow rate of 1. 0 ml/min using UV detection at 210 nm. Retention time of HCA was observed at 5. 3 min in selected mobile phase. Inter day and Intra day precision studies were carried out and %RSD was found to be within the range of 0. 90 to 1. 12...|$|E
