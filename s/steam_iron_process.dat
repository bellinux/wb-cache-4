40|$|The {{present study}} is focused on two studies. The {{kinetics}} 0 : methane steam reforming over a Ni/MgO catalyst at high pressure is reported in the first study. The second study {{is focused on the}} <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> <b>process</b> over promoted Fe-oxide based catalyst using four different reductants; H 2, H 2 /CO mixture, CH 4 and CH 4 /C 02 mixture. A kinetic study of methane steam reforming over a Ni/MgO catalyst at high pressure was carried out. The kinetic orders of methane and steam at 40 bars and 600 QC were found to be 0. 82 and 0. 62 respectively. 1 ~he estimation of energy of activation of the process was found to be 106 KJ/mol. T 11 e reaction rate data was explained by a Langmuir - Hinshelwood - Hougen - Wastson model. Four differe 11 t reductants (H 2, H 2 /CO mixture, CI- 4 and CH 4 /C 02 mixture), were applied {{for the study of the}} <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> <b>process.</b> A study of the <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> <b>process</b> using H 2 as reductant focused on the first reduction of 4 %Cr 203 - 96 % Fe 203 with H 2. The first reduction was found to be composed of a two step reduction up to 550 QC. The estimation of energy of activation for the process was found to be 92. 4 KJ/mol and 68. 2 KJ/mol respectively. The study of the <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> <b>process</b> using H 2 ICO mixture as reductant over 4 %Cr 203 - 96 % Fe 2 O 3 found that FeO was an intermediate for the reduction of Fe 203 with H 2 ICO mixture to Fe metal. The application of methane as reductant for the <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> <b>process</b> gave the worst results. As a result, NiO was added to Cr 203 -Fe 203 to increase the activity. Carbon formation on NiO also was found to be a serious problem. In order to minimize carbon formation on NiO, CO 2 was introduced in a mix with CI- 4 for the oxidation of deposited carbon during the reduction step. Although the introduction of CO 2 can suppress carbon formation, the strong oxidation of reduced iron oxide by water formed during the reduction process coupled to the l 1 igher favorable reaction of the water gas shift reaction adversely affects the complete reduction of iron oxide to iron metal...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this project {{was to develop a}} hydrogen production technology for gasification applications based on a circulating fluid-bed reactor and an attrition resistant iron catalyst. The work towards achieving this objective consisted of three key activities: • Development of an iron-based catalyst suitable for a circulating fluid-bed reactor • Design, construction, and operation of a bench-scale circulating fluid-bed reactor system for hydrogen production • Techno-economic analysis of the steam-iron and the pressure swing adsorption hydrogen production processes. This report describes the work completed in each of these activities during this project. The catalyst development and testing program prepared and iron-based catalysts using different support and promoters to identify catalysts that had sufficient activity for cyclic reduction with syngas and steam oxidation and attrition resistance to enable use in a circulating fluid-bed reactor system. The best performing catalyst from this catalyst development program was produced by a commercial catalyst toll manufacturer to support the bench-scale testing activities. The reactor testing systems used during material development evaluated catalysts in a single fluid-bed reactor by cycling between reduction with syngas and oxidation with steam. The prototype SIP reactor system (PSRS) consisted of two circulating fluid-bed reactors with the iron catalyst being transferred between the two reactors. This design enabled demonstration of the technical feasibility of the combination of the circulating fluid-bed reactor system and the iron-based catalyst for commercial hydrogen production. The specific activities associated with this bench-scale circulating fluid-bed reactor systems that were completed in this project included design, construction, commissioning, and operation. The experimental portion of this project focused on technical demonstration of the performance of an iron-based catalyst and a circulating fluid-bed reactor system for hydrogen production. Although a technology can be technically feasible, successful commercial deployment also requires that a technology offer an economic advantage over existing commercial technologies. To effective estimate the economics of this steam-iron process, a techno-economic analysis of this <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> <b>process</b> and a commercial pressure swing adsorption process were completed. The results from this analysis described in this report show the economic potential of the <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> <b>process</b> for integration with a gasification plant for coproduction of hydrogen and electricity...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, the switch towards {{renewable}} sources for energy production is considered as necessary for the future sustainability of the world environment. Hydrogen {{is one of the}} most promising energy vectors for the stocking of low density renewable sources such as wind, biomasses and sun. The production of hydrogen by the steam-iron process could be one of the most versatile approaches useful for the employment of different reducing bio-based fuels. The <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> <b>process</b> is a two-step chemical looping reaction based (i) on the reduction of an iron-based oxide with an organic compound followed by (ii) a reoxidation of the reduced solid material by water, which lead to the production of hydrogen. The overall reaction is the water oxidation of the organic fuel (gasification or reforming processes) but the inherent separation of the two semireactions allows the production of carbon-free hydrogen. In this thesis, steam-iron cycle with methanol is proposed and three different oxides with the generic formula AFe 2 O 4 (A=Co,Ni,Fe) are compared in order to understand how the chemical properties and the structural differences can affect the productivity of the overall process. The modifications occurred in used samples are deeply investigated by the analysis of used materials. A specific study on CoFe 2 O 4 -based process using both classical and in-situ/ex-situ analysis is reported employing many characterization techniques such as FTIR spectroscopy, TEM, XRD, XPS, BET, TPR and Mössbauer spectroscopy. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} is to control if the <b>steam</b> <b>ironing</b> effect applied on cotton {{clothing}} can persist in different climatic conditions. For this purpose, the effect of <b>steam</b> <b>ironing</b> <b>process</b> on the sorption isotherms of plain weave fabrics made of cotton was investigated. An experimental device conceived around a magnetic suspension balance was used to regulate temperature at two levels (25 degrees C and 35 degrees C). Using the same proportions of mixed air, relative humidities can reach fixed values between 3 % and 97 %. Two successive cycles of continuous adsorption/desorption water vapor were used. The sorption isotherms of the ironed and non-ironed fabrics are compared. They define three sorption zones depending on the nature of links between structure and water vapor. The results show that the adsorption isotherm of the ironed fabrics is lower than the non-ironed one during the initial two zones of the sigmoid. Then, they are superposed in the last sector of the adsorption isotherm and during the entire desorption phase. Therefore, the ironing can reduce the sorption capacity of cotton at low and moderate relative humidities. A second adsorption/desorption cycle is performed on the same samples to prove that the ironing effect is completely cancelled...|$|R

40|$|The {{separation}} of reduction and oxidation steps of heterogeneous catalytic gas phase reactions in a spatial and/or temporal way was investigated {{only for a}} few systems {{at the beginning of the}} project. To use a forced period operated, adiabatic fixed bed reactor with periodic flow reversal (reverse flow reactor) for these reaction procedures must be assessed as a new reactor concept. So, special emphasis is given to the potentials and constraints of this reactor concept as a specific dynamic operation mode. The used model systems were investigated with the different techniques of chemical reaction engineering like investigations of the kinetic and microdynamic behaviour in different laboratory reactors, modeling and simulation studies to the kinetic and the reactor behaviour as well as working out periodic experiments in a larger laboratory scale. The results show the strong influence of the microdynamics of the reaction system on the whole system. The {{separation of}} the catalytic systems normally shows the desired increase of the product yield at the beginning of the reaction. The advantage of the reverse flow reactor is seen best in the coupling of endothermic an exothermic reaction steps. So the investigations were focused onto these examples. It was shown mainly by simulation studied that the usage of the investigated concept is useful only for some reaction systems depending on the reaction heats and the concentrations given by the process. So the results give a detailed understanding of the model processes <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> <b>process</b> and oxidehydrogenation of isobutyric acid as well as the common knowledge of working out reduction-oxidation cycles in a reverse flow reactor was increased.

50|$|There are {{two main}} types of <b>steam</b> {{generator}} <b>irons,</b> pressurised and non-pressurised. A non-pressurised <b>steam</b> generator <b>iron</b> will produce a lot of steam but the steam is released at a lower speed, typically around 80-100 grams per minute. A pressurised <b>steam</b> generator <b>iron,</b> on the other hand, creates a highly pressurised environment that helps the steam penetrate fabric more efficiently. A pressurised <b>steam</b> generator <b>iron</b> will typically have a steam output of 100-120 grams per minute.

50|$|In {{the industrialized}} world, these designs have been {{superseded}} by the electric iron, which uses resistive heating from an electric current. The hot plate, called the sole plate, {{is made of}} aluminium or stainless steel polished to be as smooth as possible; it is sometimes coated with a low-friction heat-resistant plastic to reduce friction below that of the metal plate. The heating element is controlled by a thermostat that switches the current on and off to maintain the selected temperature. The invention of the resistively heated electric iron is credited to Henry W. Seeley of New York City in 1882. In the same year an iron heated by a carbon arc was introduced in France, but was too dangerous to be successful. The early electric irons had {{no easy way to}} control their temperature, and the first thermostatically controlled electric iron appeared in the 1920s. Later, steam was used to iron clothing. Credit for the invention of the <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> goes to Thomas Sears. The first commercially available electric <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> was introduced in 1926 by a New York drying and cleaning company, Eldec, but was not a commercial success. The patent for an electric <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> and dampener was issued to Max Skolnik of Chicago in 1934. In 1938 Skolnik granted the Steam-O-Matic Corporation of New York the exclusive right to manufacture steam-electric irons. This was the first <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> to achieve any degree of popularity, and led the way to more widespread use of the electric <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> during the 1940s and 1950s.|$|R

40|$|The 2 -D {{deformation}} of bleached plain weave cotton ready-to-wear clothing was measured during adsorption and desorption cycles. A digital X-ray imaging system was {{coupled with a}} climatic chamber to control temperature and relative humidity. An image of each sample was recorded for several equilibrium states. The strain along warp (epsilon(cc)) and weft (epsilon(ww)) directions and the shear deformation (epsilon(wc)) were evaluated by image correlation process. The dimensional variations are explained by geometrical consideration of the structure at microscopic (fibers scale) and macroscopic levels (yarns scale). Indeed, the reaction between water vapor molecules and material enlightens two steps. At first, the swelling fibers fill the micropores inside the yarns. Then, the yarns swell and push on their neighbors to fill up the macropores and cause the macroscopic swelling of the overall structure. During the desorption phase, the fibers shrink to create a free space inside the plain weave structure that will be relaxed to find its initial state. The isotropy between the two main directions is explained by the weave symmetry and the similar yarn properties. The shear deformation {{is related to the}} cohesion by twist between cotton fibers. This work is more specifically focused on the <b>ironing</b> <b>process</b> (T = 200 degrees C + <b>steam).</b> The <b>ironing</b> generates flattened yarns and increases their friction, which amplifies the deformation during the first adsorption cycle.
