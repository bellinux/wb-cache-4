It can take more than one week to manually prepare a <b>summary</b> of question <b>items</b> from three or four surveys. In this research, a support tool that creates a <b>summary</b> of question <b>items</b> accurately and automatically for questionnaires stored in the “SRDQ ” social survey data archive is developed. We have also constructed a man-machine interface system that allows the user to edit the <b>summary</b> of question <b>items</b> created automatically with the proposed method.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to apply the Rasch model to {{investigate}} both the Van Hiele theory for geometric development and an associated test. In terms of the test, the objective is to investigate the functioning of a classic 25 -item instrument designed to identify levels of geometric proficiency. The data set consists of responses by 244 students (106 for a pre-test and 138 for a post-test) of which 76 students sat both the pre-test and the post-test. The <b>summary</b> <b>item</b> statistics do not show statistically discernible differences between observed and expected scores under the Rasch model (Chi-square statistic). The Rasch analysis confirms to some strong extent the Van Hiele theory of geometric development. The study identifies some problematic test items as they only require knowledge of a specific aspect of geometry instead of testing geometric reasoning. In terms of the Van Hiele theory, the Rasch analyses identified as problematic some items about class inclusion, an issue which has also been raised in other studies. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{shortage}} of empirical applications of the capability approach that employ closed survey instruments to assess self-reported capabilities. However, for those few instruments that have been designed and administered through surveys until now, no psychometric properties (reliability, validity, and factor structure) were reported. The {{purpose of this study is}} the assessment of the psychometric properties of three new language versions (German, French, and Italian) of an established (English) set of eight self-reported capability items. The set of items is taken from a previously published British study by Anand and van Hees (J Soc Econ 35 (2) : 268 – 284, 2006). Our sample consists of 17, 152 young male adults aged 18 – 25 years from the three major language regions in Switzerland. The results indicate good reliability of the three language versions. The results from the exploratory factor analyses suggest a one-dimensional factor structure for seven domain specific items. Furthermore, the results from multiple regression analyses suggest that a global <b>summary</b> <b>item</b> on overall capabilities represents a measurement alternative to the set of seven domain specific capability items. Finally, the results confirm the applicability of the closed capability instrument in a large scale survey questionnaire and represent the first attempt to measure self-reported capabilities in Switzerland...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{quality of}} {{reporting}} in systematic reviews (SRs) /meta-analyses (MAs) of diagnostic tests published by authors in China {{has not been}} evaluated. The aims of present study are to evaluate the quality of reporting in diagnostic SRs/MAs using the PRISMA statement and determine {{the changes in the}} quality of reporting over time. METHODS: According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, we searched five databases including Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and Web of knowledge, to identify SRs/MAs on diagnostic tests. The searches were conducted on July 14, 2012 and the cut off for inclusion of the SRs/MAs was December 31 (st) 2011. The PRISMA statement was used to assess the quality of reporting. Analysis was performed using Excel 2003, RevMan 5. RESULTS: A total of 312 studies were included. Fifteen diseases systems were covered. According to the PRISMA checklist, there had been serious reporting flaws in following items: structured <b>summary</b> (<b>item</b> 2, 22. 4 %), objectives (item 4, 18. 9 %), protocol and registration (item 5, 2. 6 %), risk of bias across studies (item 15, 26. 3 %), funding (item 27, 28. 8 %). The subgroup analysis showed that there had been some statistically significant improvement in total compliance for 9 PRISMA items after the PRISMA was released, 6 items were statistically improved regarding funded articles, 3 items were statistically improved for CSCD articles, and there was a statistically significant increase in the proportion of reviews reporting on 22 items for SCI articles (P< 0. 050). CONCLUSION: The numbers of diagnostic SRs/MAs is increasing annually. The quality of reporting has measurably been improved over the previous years. Unfortunately, there are still many deficiencies in the reporting including protocol and registration, search, risk of bias across studies, and funding. Future Chinese reviewers should address issues on these aspects...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship 				between nursing staffing and quality of life (QOL) in nursing 				homes (NHs). The relationships between nursing staff hours per 				resident day, nursing staffing skill mix, turnover of nursing 				staff, and the answers given to QOL questions by 231 residents 				in Iowa NHs were investigated. Unexpectedly, only part of 				staffing variables were statistically significantly correlated 				with QOL of residents and nurse staffing variables seemed to 				have little influence on predicting QOL of residents in this 				study. The major differences between this study and previous 				studies are that previous research focused on quality of care 				(QOC) and this study measured QOL by measuring residents 2 ̆ 7 				outcomes. Previous studies found that nurse staffing is an 				important factor in improving QOC (and by implication, QOL) of 				NH residents.

40|$|BackgroundPatients with {{advanced}} {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) require care that emphasizes symptom palliation {{in addition to}} extending survival. The low response rates and minimal survival gains observed in second-line studies underscore the need to assess treatment efficacy with symptomatic end points. MethodsTo characterize the relationship between patient-reported health-related quality of life outcomes and efficacy end points (tumor response, overall survival [OS], progression-free survival [PFS]), retrospective analyses were performed on Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) data (n = 488) from the phase III study of pemetrexed (500 mg/m 2 once every 3 weeks) versus docetaxel (75 mg/m 2 once every 3 weeks) in advanced NSCLC. The LCSS data consisted of patient ratings of six symptoms and three <b>summary</b> <b>items</b> using 100 -mm visual analogue scales. The mean maximum improvement for each item was categorized according to best tumor response, with statistical analyses based on a two-factor interaction model (with treatment arm and response group as fixed factors). Additional analyses pooled data between treatment arms and examined correlation (nonparametric and Pearson's) of time to first worsening of symptoms (TWS) with PFS and OS. ResultsAll LCSS items, except hemoptysis, showed mean maximum improvement over baseline for responders and patients with stable disease (p < 0. 01), with greater improvement associated with response. Median TWS for each LCSS item ranged between 2. 3 months (fatigue) and 7. 0 months (cough), with correlation between TWS and PFS and OS (all p values ≤ 0. 017). ConclusionsFor most NSCLC patients, second-line chemotherapy provides symptomatic improvement that is linked to standard efficacy outcomes. Health-related quality of life data provides complementary efficacy information that can guide routine clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that our visual system may {{construct}} a summary statistical representation over groups of visual objects. Although there is a general understanding that human observers can accurately represent sets of a variety of features, many questions on how summary statistics, such as an average, are computed remain unanswered. This study investigated sampling properties of visual information used by human observers to extract two types of <b>summary</b> statistics of <b>item</b> sets, average and variance. We presented three models of ideal observers to extract the summary statistics: a global sampling model without sampling noise, global sampling model with sampling noise, and limited sampling model. We compared the performance of an ideal observer of each model with that of human observers using statistical efficiency analysis. Results suggest that <b>summary</b> statistics of <b>items</b> in a set may be computed without representing individual items, which makes it possible to discard the limited sampling account. Moreover, the extraction of summary statistics may not necessarily require the representation of individual objects with focused attention when the sets of items are larger than 4...|$|R

It also facilitates concise interpretation of item relations by regulating complexity of a network underlying the test items. The viability and effectiveness are demonstrated via simulation and a real data example.
