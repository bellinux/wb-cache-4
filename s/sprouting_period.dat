40|$|Consumption of Brassica {{vegetables}} {{is related}} to a decreased incidence of certain cancer forms, {{and it has been}} linked to the presence of glucosinolates in these vegetables. After ripe seeds, Brassica sprouts contain the highest concentration of these compounds and are therefore a good source of glucosinolates for chemoprotection. In the present experiments, the content and distribution of glucosinolates in five varieties of B. oleracea (white cabbage, red cabbage, Savoy cabbage, broccoli and cauliflower) was determined in ripe seeds and sprouts of up to seven days by High Performance Liquid Chromatography. The type and concentration of individual glucosinolates varied according to B. oleracea variety, plant part and length of the <b>sprouting</b> <b>period.</b> Concentration of alkyl glucosinolates decreased whereas that of indol- 3 -ylmethylglucosinolates increased throughout the <b>sprouting</b> <b>period.</b> Roots had the highest glucosinolate concentration in four and seven day old sprouts whereas at both sprouting times, cotyledons had the highest concentration of alkylthio- and alkylsulphinylglucosinolates...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{extracted}} radish bud (Raphanus sativus L.) and investigated its nitrite scavenging activity, superoxide dismutases (SOD) -like activity, tyrosinase inhibition activity, {{xanthine oxidase}} inhibition activity, and angio-tensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibition activity according to extraction solvent and <b>sprouting</b> <b>period.</b> For nitrite scavenging activity, each extract recorded {{its highest level}} of 81. 44 ∼ 89. 71 % at pH 1. 2. Radish bud extracts on sprouting days 4 and 8 showed greater scavenging activities than those on sprouting day 12 at pH 1. 2 and pH 4. 0. There were differences in scavenging activity according to extraction solvent based on water extract exhibiting improved scavenging activity. Ethanol extract recorded scavenging activity of 16. 12 % at pH 6. 0, which was {{similar to those of}} ethanol and methanol radish bud extracts on sprouting day 12. SOD-like activity of radish bud extracts was in the range of 4. 57 ∼ 27. 05 %. For comparison purposes, SOD-like activity of L-ascorbic acid was 52. 15 %, which was higher than that of radish bud extracts. Acetone and methanol extracts showed high SOD-like activities on sprouting day 8. SOD-like activity of radish bud extracts on sprouting day 12 significantly decreased to 4. 57 ∼ 15. 59 %. Radish bud extracts recorded good tyrosinase inhibitory activities on sprouting 8 and 12, whereas methanol extracts recorded the greatest tyrosinase inhibitory activity at 62. 65 ∼ 84. 89 %. Radish bud extracts recorded xanthine oxidase inhibition activity of 21. 26 ∼ 29. 52 % on sprouting day 4, and acetone extracts showed the highest level of xanthine oxidase inhibition activity.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{consumption}} of glucosinolate-containing Brussels sprouts on plasma and urinary glutathione S-transferase (GST) class-α and -π were investigated. Five male and five female non-smoking volunteers {{were randomly assigned}} to two groups in a crossover design. Five persons started on a glucosinolate-free diet (control period), while the other five consumed 300 g of cooked Brussels sprouts per day, at the expense of 300 g of glucosinolate-free vegetables (<b>sprouts</b> <b>period).</b> Dietary regimes were reversed after 1 week, GST levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay. At the end of the <b>sprouts</b> <b>period,</b> a significant increase (1. 5 -fold) in plasma class-α GST levels was observed in males but not in females (control versus sprouts, paired t-test; P-values 0. 031 and 0. 317 respectively), while plasma GST class-π levels as well as secretion of urinary GST class-α and -π levels remained unchanged. We conclude that (i) increased plasma GST class-α levels in males originate probably solely from the liver and not from stomach, intestine or kidney; (ii) males are more susceptible for induction of hepatic GSTs than females; and (iii) urinary GST concentration seems less useful as a biomarker for hepatic GST induction...|$|R

40|$|A high {{intake of}} glucosinolate-containing cruciferous vegetables, such as Brussels sprouts (Brassica oleraceae), {{has been linked}} to a {{decreased}} cancer risk, but the underlying mechanism is still unclear. The aim {{of this study was to}} reveal possible modulating effects of consumption of Brussels sprouts on duodenal, rectal and lymphocytic (i) glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzyme activity, (ii) GST isozyme levels and (iii) glutathione (GSH) content. Ten healthy non-smoking volunteers were randomly assigned to two groups in a cross-over design. Five persons started on a glucosinolate-free diet (control period), while the other five consumed 300 g/day cooked Brussels sprouts, at the expense of 300 g glucosinolate-free vegetables (<b>sprouts</b> <b>period).</b> After 7 days the regimen was changed for a further meek. At the end of both periods blood samples and duodenal and rectal biopsies were taken. Mean GST activity showed marked differences between duodenal, rectal and lymphocytic cytosols (737 ± 54, 321 ± 29 and 154 ± 14 nmol/min/mg protein respectively), but was uninfluenced by the dietary regimen. Isozyme distribution varied greatly between the tissues. In duodenum GST-α, -π and -μ isozymes were expressed in considerable amounts (8441 ± 1365, 3002 ± 223 and 536 ± 248 ng/mg protein respectively). Rectal biopsies also contained above three GST classes, but here GST-π was the most pronounced expressed isozyme (2849 ± 246) followed by GST-μ (495 ± 242), while GST-α was only present in minor quantities (149 ± 31). In lymphocytes only GST-π (755 ± 96) and GST-μ (83 ± 54) could be detected. As a result of the dietary regimen rectal GST-α and -π levels were slightly increased at the end of the <b>sprouts</b> <b>period,</b> by 30 and 15 % respectively. GSH contents were uninfluenced by the dietary regimen. In conclusion, consumption of glucosinolate-containing Brussels sprouts for 1 week results in increased rectal GST-α and -π isozyme levels. We hypothesize that these enhanced detoxification enzyme levels may partly explain the epidemiological association between a high intake of glucosinolates (cruciferous vegetables) and a decreased risk of colorectal cancer...|$|R
40|$|The {{technique}} of seed osmoconditioning, {{which consists of}} a controlled hydration and dehydration, was evaluated for use in foodstuff production;In the first experiment, soybean, wheat, mungbean, and sesame seeds were hydrated in polyethylene glycol (PEG), chitosan plus water (CH), citric acid (CA), and water (W). Hydrated seeds were either dehydrated to their original moisture content or left fully-hydrated and stored at 5 °C or 15 °C for 2 or 4 weeks. Fully-hydrated and dehydrated seeds sprouted faster than untreated seeds, but the performance of fully-hydrated seeds declined during storage. Phytate content in soybean and mungbean seeds increased with the initial hydration. Phytate decreased when seeds were dehydrated, but phytate content in fully-hydrated seeds remained high. To assess microbiological safety, aerobic plate counts, total coliform counts, and yeast and mold counts were performed. Dehydrated seeds had lower microbial counts than fully-hydrated seeds. Polyethylene glycol and citric acid had an antimicrobial effect;In the second experiment, soybean and wheat seeds were surface-sterilized with NaOCl, EtOH, or a control. Seeds were hydrated in PEG, CA, or W. Following hydration, seeds were treated with calcium propionate or a control, and then dehydrated. The crops were analyzed as dry, unsprouted seeds and as 48 -hour sprouts. Citric acid and NaOCl had antimicrobial impacts on unsprouted seeds, but sprouted seeds had microbial counts up to 10 [superscript] 5 higher than unsprouted seeds regardless of treatment. The calcium propionate treatment reduced total coliform counts in wheat {{by a factor of}} 10. Some counts declined after 16 weeks of 4 °C storage. Sprouting resulted in increased phytate in soybeans (40 %) and wheat (10 %). Sprouts from osmoconditioned and untreated seeds were rated similarly in sensory analyses;In the final experiment, phytate content and phytase activity of soybean and wheat seeds were determined during the osmoconditioning process and during a subsequent 144 - 192 hour <b>sprouting</b> <b>period.</b> While phytate content in wheat seeds and sprouts did not change during osmoconditioning or sprouting, phytase activity increased throughout the <b>sprouting</b> <b>period.</b> Phytate in soybean seeds increased at 8 hours of sprouting, and decreased at 192 hours. The reduced content at 192 hours coincided with an increase in phytase activity. Osmoconditioned and untreated sprouts did not differ with regard to phytate content or phytase activity...|$|E
40|$|Dwarf bamboo is an ecologically and {{economically}} important forest resource that is widespread in mountainous regions of eastern Asia and southern America. Fargesia denudata, {{one of the}} most important dwarf bamboos, is a staple food of the giant panda, but our knowledge about how F. denudata copes with drought stress is very limited. The objective of this study was to determine the responses of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) metabolism to drought in leaves and roots of F. denudata plants. Plants were subjected to three water treatments, well-watered [WW, 85 % relative soil water content (RSWC) ], moderate drought (MD, 50 % RSWC), and severe drought (SD, 30 % RSWC), for two consecutive years during the <b>sprouting</b> <b>period.</b> Plant growth parameters, levels of carbohydrates and N compounds, and activities of key enzymes involved in C and N metabolism were analyzed. In young leaves, C metabolism was in balance after drought stress, but nitrate (NO 3 -) reduction and ammonium (NH 4 +) assimilation were accelerated. In old leaves, drought stress decreased carbohydrate contents by spurring the activities of the main enzymes that participate in C metabolism, whereas N metabolism was enhanced only under SD. Roots showed unchanged C metabolism parameters under MD, together with stable NO 3 - reduction and the key enzymes related to NH 4 + assimilation, whereas they were stimulated by SD. Hydrolysates of carbohydrates in old leaves could be transferred into roots, but only to meet MD. Meanwhile, roots could allocate more N nutrition to young leaves and less to old leaves. These changes regulated the overall metabolic balance of F. denudata. Consequently, the results indicate that different organs with various response strategies will be well adapted to different drought intensities for ensuring regular growth of F. denudata plants at the whole-plant level...|$|E
40|$|Outbreaks of {{foodborne}} illness from consumption of sprouts {{have been linked}} to contaminated seeds prior to germination. Due to the long <b>sprouting</b> <b>period</b> at ambient temperatures and high humidity, germinating seeds contaminated with low pathogen levels (0. 1 log CFU/g) can result in sprouts with high numbers (≥ 108 CFU/g) of pathogens. Currently, the recommended treatment method involves soaking seeds in 20, 000 ppm (2 %) calcium hypochlorite prior to germination. In this study, an alternative treatment involving soaking seeds in a carvacrol nanoemulsion was tested for its efficacy against Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Enteritidis (ATCC BAA- 1045) or EGFP expressing E. coli O 157 :H 7 (ATCC 42895) contaminated mung bean and alfalfa seeds. The antimicrobial treatment was performed by soaking inoculated seed batches in the spontaneous nanoemulsion (4000 or 8000 ppm) for 30 or 60 min. The spontaneous nanoemulsion was formed by titrating the oil phase (carvacrol and medium chain triglycerides) and water-soluble surfactant (Tween 80 ®) into sodium citrate buffer. Following treatment, the numbers of surviving cells were determined by suspending the seeds in TSB and performing plate counts and/or Most Probable Number (MPN) enumeration. Treated seeds were sprouted and tested for the presence of the appropriate pathogen. This treatment successfully inactivated low levels (2 and 3 log CFU/g) of S. Enteritidis and E. coli on either seed types when soaked for either 30 or 60 min at nanoemulsion concentrations corresponding to 4000 (0. 4 %) or 8000 (0. 8 %) ppm carvacrol. Inoculated alfalfa seeds treated with 4000 ppm nanoemulsion, required a 60 min treatment time to show a similar 2 – 3 log reduction. Complete inactivation was confirmed by germinating treated seeds and performing microbiological testing. Total sprout yield was not compromised by any of the tested treatments. These results show that carvacrol nanoemulsions may be an alternative antimicrobial treatment method for mung bean and alfalfa seeds...|$|E

The antioxidant activities were assessed by using various antioxidant models (DPPH, TBARS, Rancimat method, POV). The total polyphenol contents according to the extraction solvents were 84. 11 and 296. 51 mg/g, and the ethanol extract on day 4 of showed the highest value as 296. 51 mg/g. As for DPPH radical-scavenging activity, on the day 4 of sprouting, water extracts indicated the highest scavenging activity by 86. 67 %, and the acetone extracts indicated a rather low scavenging activity as 77. 23 %. As for TBARS measurement of the radish bud extracts on day 4 of sprouting the extract of 70 % ethanol was highest (71. 48 %). On day 8 of sprouting the TBARS value was increased and the methanol extract was highest (78. 99 %). As for the oxidative induction period on day 4 of sprouting in Rancimat measurement, the methanol extract was highest (6. 07 hours) on day 4 and the antioxidant index was 1. 16.

This study consists at an investor’s perspective analysis of the first-day returns of 59 IPOs listed on the Brazilian Stock Exchange Market from January 2004 to April 2007, where I have found a significantly mean positive underpricing of 6, 60 %. I have found also some evidences of a <b>sprouting</b> “hot-market” <b>period</b> in Brazil, since the number of the IPOs in Brazil has been growing almost in an exponential speed, taking advantage of the constant growing cash inflow and liquidity of the Brazilian market, followed by the high evaluation of the Ibovespa Index, with return of 140 % on the study time frame. When categorizing the study by year, by underwriter (investment bank) and by market segment, I always have found positive adjusted initial returns, which corroborates the fact that underpricing is a constant phenomenon in the Brazilian market. Other important facts that were identified in this study is that the average returns of the IPOs are decreasing along the years and that companies that depend to a large extent on their human capital and are in the business areas that are staff intensive have a high level of underpricing while companies that have a high level of fixed assets have a low level of underpricing. Finally, after performing a multivariate linear regression analysis with the chosen independent variables on the full sample and some categorized samples, the results did not have enough statistical significance and consistence that could make them useful to create a statistical model to explain the underpricing level of Brazilian IPOs between January 2004 and April 2007...|$|R
40|$|Protecting {{the quality}} of {{children}} growth and development becomes a supreme qualification {{for the betterment of}} a nation. Double burden child malnutrition is emerging worldwide which might have a strong influence to {{the quality of}} child brain development and could not be paid-off on later life. Milk places a notable portion during the infancy and childhood. Thus, the deep insight on milk consumption pattern might explain the phenomenon of double burden child malnutrition correlated to the cognitive impairments. Objective: Current study is intended (1) to examine the current face of Indonesian double burden child malnutrition: a case study in Bogor, West Java, Indonesia, (2) to investigate the association of this phenomenon with child brain development, and (3) to examine the contribution of socioeconomic status and milk consumption on this phenomenon so that able to formulate some possible solutions to encounter this problem. Design: A cross-sectional study using a structured coded questionnaire was conducted among 387 children age 5 - 6 years old and their parents from 8 areas in Bogor, West-Java, Indonesia on November 2012 to December 2013, to record some socioeconomic status, anthropometric measurements, and history of breast feeding. Diet and probability of milk intake was assessed by two 24 h dietary recalls and food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Usual daily milk intake was calculated using Multiple Source Method (MSM). Some brain development indicators (IQ, EQ, learning, and memory ability) using Projective Multi-phase Orientation method was also executed to learn the correlation between double burden child malnutrition and some brain development indicator. Results and conclusions: A small picture of child double burden malnutrition is shown in Bogor, West Java, Indonesia, where prevalence of Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) is 27. 1 %, Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM) is 24. 9 %, and overnutrition is 7. 7 %. This phenomenon proves to impair the child brain development. The malnourished children, both under- and over- nourished children have significantly (P-value< 0. 05) lower memory ability compared to the normal children (memory score, N; SAM = 45. 2, 60; MAM = 48. 5, 61; overweight = 48. 4, 43; obesity = 47. 9, 60; normal = 52. 4, 163). The plausible reasons behind these evidences are the lack of nutrient intake during the <b>sprout</b> growth <b>period</b> on undernourished children or increasing adiposity on overnourished children might influence the growth of hippocampus area which responsible to the memory ability. Either undernutrition or overnutrition, the preventive action on this problem is preferable to avoid ongoing cognitive performance loss of the next generation. Some possible solutions for this phenomenon are promoting breast feeding initiation and exclusive breast feeding practices for infants, supporting the consumption of a normal portion of milk (250 to 500 ml per day) for children, and breaking the chain of poverty by socioeconomic improvement. And, the national food security becomes the fundamental point for the betterment of the next. In the global context, the causes of under- and over- nutrition have to be opposed through integrated and systemic approaches for a better quality of the next generation of human beings.

40|$|Besides onions {{being one}} of the most {{cultivated}} and consumed vegetables, during storage onion bulbs are still affected by many physiological, biochemical and technological factors which can influence their quality. Respiration rate (RR O 2), soluble sugars (SS), total phenolics (TP), and peroxidase (POD) activity were measured in inner bud tissues during a dormancy break of onion bulbs treated four weeks at 0 ºC and stored in the dark at 20 ºC. Control bulbs were stored simultaneously in the same condition. Breakage of dormancy was checked by the appearance of first green internal leaves by cutting longitudinally 30 bulbs. After eight weeks, RR O 2 of sprouted onions was 52 % higher than that of freshly harvested and dormant bulbs. One week after cooling SS decreased from 15 to 9 mg g- 1 fresh weight, and then peaked from 9 to 19 mg g- 1 after three weeks. For control bulbs, a similar peak was observed after six weeks. For inner buds of cold-treated onions, a slight increase of TP (from 0. 17 to 0. 2 mg g- 1; fresh weight) was observed during {{the first two weeks of}} cooling, and then a decrease to 0. 11 mg g- 1 was observed after eight weeks. For inner buds of control bulbs, TP also increased slightly from 0. 17 to 0. 2 mg g- 1 after five weeks, and decreased to 0. 15 mg g- 1 after seven weeks when bulbs began to sprout.

40|$|The {{provision}} of crops {{of a light}} fry colour, from store, is {{of the utmost importance}} to processors. Poor fry colour leads to rejection of crops on a quality basis. The application of Chlorpropham (CIPC) sprout suppressant, as a thermal fog is associated with a deterioration in fry colour. The BPC funded project at the University of Glasgow and its collaborator Sutton Bridge Experimental Unit investigates the effects of CIPC use on the processing quality of stored potatoes. CIPC is the only sprout suppressant available for medium and long-term storage for processing in Britain. In the UK the majority of CIPC treatments are conducted as thermal fog applications. This is considered to be the most practical means of achieving successful sprout control. The introduction of a hot fog into potato stores has a disruptive influence. It can physiologically alter the potatoes by creating a stressful environment. Tuber respiration rate increases and so the crop will age. Experimental trials conducted as part of this project have shown that it is the fogging process itself that is responsible for the decrease in crop quality following application, not the CIPC formulation applied. Studies revealed that both carbon dioxide and ethylene were produced naturally by crop and from the combustion of petrol used to generate thermal fogs. Initially the fry colour problems were linked with carbon dioxide in combustion gases and from increased respiration. However, carbon dioxide output from thermal fogger machines was less significant than expected. The levels were consistently lower than concentrations shown to have a deleterious effect in previous BPC funded work. Ethylene is present in thermal fogs as a by-product of burning the hydrocarbon fuel used to generate fog. The concentration of ethylene produced is associated with the running conditions of the fogger machine I. e. burner temperature, type and volume of fuel used etc. The ethylene created in a standard CIPC thermal-fog application is sufficient to induce a physiological response in tubers. Exposure of crop to ethylene effects respiration, dormancy <b>period,</b> <b>sprout</b> morphology, reducing sugar concentration and hence fry colour. The extent of the outcome depends on exposure time and concentration. Following assessment of the fogging situation, various means of reducing the impact of CIPC application on fry colour were evaluated. Different approaches were undertaken and included both attempting to control and remove the contaminants present in thermal fogs. By ventilating stores earlier than the recommended twenty-four hour period after treatment a vast improvement in fry colour was observed. In doing this the exposure time of crop to contaminants was greatly reduced. In the experimental work the stores were ventilated eight hours after treatment. This allowed adequate time for the effective fraction of the thermal god to settle. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Potato is an {{important}} food and cash crop which in Ethiopia is produced two or more times in a year. However, its productivity is low owing {{to a number of}} constraints including a) limited availability of quality planting materials, and b) poor tuber sprouting due to long dormancy period of improved varieties at the time of planting. Two consecutive experiments were conducted from November 2013 to June 2014 : 1) to assess the effects of gibberellic acid (GA 3) and storage methods on seed tuber dormancy breakage of two potato varieties; and 2) to assess the effects of dormancy breakage treatments and storage methods on subsequent growth, yield and related traits of potato crop. The treatments in the first experiment consisted of two potato varieties (Bubu and Bate), three levels of GA 3 [0, 10 and 20 parts per million (ppm) ], and three storage methods [in diffused light store (DLS), in pit store (PS), and in farm-yard manure (FYM) ]. The first trial was laid out as a complete randomized design with four replications and conducted at Haramaya University, Ethiopia. The second trial consisted of seed from each treatment in the first experiment, planted in randomized complete block design with three replications on a farmers’ field. The results showed that varieties, application of GA 3 and storage methods as well as the interaction among the variety and treatments significantly affected tuber dormancy <b>period,</b> <b>sprouting</b> characteristics and subsequent tuber yield. When tubers were treated with 20 ppm GA 3 and stored under FYM, the dormancy period was reduced from 102. 5 and 52 to 36. 5 and 31 days in improved and farmer’s variety, respectively. Tuber treatment with 20 ppm GA 3 and stored under DLS, PS, and FYM, increased marketable tuber yield by 31. 6 %, 29. 6 %, and 33. 6 %, respectively for Bubu variety and by 92. 5 %, 78. 4 %, and 80. 9 % for Bate variety, respectively compared to non-GA 3 treated tubers stored under DLS, PS, and FYM. However, tubers of improved variety Bubu treated with 20 ppm GA 3 and stored under DLS produced the highest marketable tuber yield of 34. 20 ton per ha. Tuber quality attributes (specific gravity, dry matter, and total starch content) were affected only due to interaction effects of variety and GA 3 application with the highest values at 20 ppm GA 3 for improved potato variety Bubu. In general, the research indicated that treating seed tubers with GA 3 and storing under DLS, PS or FYM promoted early tuber sprouting and better tuber yield of both varieties. These results suggest that, use of GA 3 treatment combined with different storage methods enhances early tuber sprouting and increases tuber yield. Nevertheless, further research should be continued to evaluate different potato varieties, GA 3 treatment, and storage methods under different atmospheric conditions and production seasons...|$|R

Taxa de respiração (RR O 2), açucares solúveis (SS), fenóis totais (TP) e atividade de peroxidase (POD) foram medidos em tecidos internos de brotos, durante uma quebra de dormência de bulbos de cebola, tratados por quatro semanas a 0 ºC e armazenados no escuro a 20 ºC. Bulbos controle foram armazenados simultaneamente na mesma condição. A quebra da dormência foi verificada através do aparecimento das primeiras folhas internas verdes, cortando 30 bulbos longitudinalmente. Depois de oito semanas a RR O 2 de bulbos brotados foi 52 % maior em relação a bulbos recentemente colhidos e bulbos dormentes. Os SS diminuíram uma semana após resfriamento, de 15 para 9 mg g- 1 de peso fresco e depois apresentaram um pico, de 9 para 19 mg g- 1 depois de três semanas. Para os bulbos controle também foi observado um pico similar depois de seis semanas. Para os brotos internos de cebolas tratadas com frio, foi observado um pequeno aumento de TP (de 0, 17 a 0, 2 mg g- 1 de peso fresco), durante as duas primeiras semanas de resfriamento e, depois, um decréscimo para 0, 11 mg g- 1 depois de oito semanas. Para os brotos internos de bulbos controle, os TP também aumentaram pouco, de 0, 17 para 0, 2 mg g- 1 depois de cinco semanas, decrescendo para 0, 15 mg g- 1 depois de sete semanas, quando começaram a brotar. A atividade de POD apresentou uma tendência similar em relação aos TP. Para bulbos tratados a frio, a atividade POD aumentou para 1, 7 U g- 1 de peso fresco depois de duas semanas, decrescendo para 1, 1 U g- 1 durante as últimas quatro semanas. Para as amostras controle, a atividade POD permaneceu estável por quatro semanas e decresceu progressivamente de 29 % durante as últimas quatro semanas. O decréscimo da atividade de POD coincidiu com o decréscimo de TP e coincidiu com o início da brotação. Com o tratamento frio, os primeiros brotos foram observados durante a terceira semana, enquanto o brotamento total se deu depois de oito semanas. Em comparação, apenas 20 % dos bulbos controle brotaram depois de oito semanas...|$|R
