With regret, she says goodbye to Bert with a kiss and sets off ("A <b>Spoonful</b> <b>of</b> Sugar (Farewell Reprise)"). Jane and Michael accept that Mary is leaving them and tell her that they'll never forget her. The two {{children}} watch as their parents waltz happily together and Mary flies high above the audience, disappearing in a flash.|$|E
25|$|While Mary {{manages the}} children, other {{problems}} lie with their parents. Winifred {{is aware that}} she is somehow disappointing both her children and her husband ("Being Mrs Banks"). George, on the other hand, can't understand why she finds the role of wife and mother so difficult ("Cherry Tree Lane (reprise)"). In an effort to please her husband, Winifred sends out invitations for a smart tea party. Mrs. Brill makes the preparations, while telling an eager Robertson Ay to keep his hands off. The children inadvertently sabotage the kitchen preparations, but Mary sorts {{it out with a}} lesson ("A <b>Spoonful</b> <b>of</b> Sugar"). However, it is then revealed that none of the invitees are coming.|$|E
25|$|On {{their next}} adventure, Bert {{introduces}} {{the children to}} his friends the chimney sweeps ("Step in Time"). The sweeps' dance eventually enters the house, causing chaos. As the sweeps quickly exit, George receives a telegram from the bank requesting his presence there. George assumes that it is to seal his fate and decides it's time to sell the family heirloom. However, the vase is shattered accidentally by Mrs. Brill, who goes into a despairing shock since she had been cleaning it {{from the top of}} the shelf. When she is being led away for comfort, George goes to clean the broken pile himself, to find it reveal a collection of gingerbread stars from his childhood. This leads to a brief moment of reflection for George ("A Man Has Dreams/ A <b>Spoonful</b> <b>of</b> Sugar (Reprise)"). After shaking hands with Bert, George leaves to meet the Chairman of the Bank.|$|E

25|$|Fries {{are very}} popular in Belgium, where they are known as frieten (in Dutch) or frites (in French), and the Netherlands, where among the working classes they are known as patat in the north and, in the south, friet. In Belgium, fries are sold in shops called friteries (French), frietkot/frituur (Dutch), or Fritüre/Frittüre (German). They are served with a large variety of Belgian sauces and eaten either {{on their own or}} with other snacks. Traditionally fries are served in a cornet de frites (French), patatzak/frietzak/fritzak (Dutch/Flemish), or Frittentüte (German), a white {{cardboard}} cone, then wrapped in paper, with a <b>spoonful</b> <b>of</b> sauce (often mayonnaise) on top.

Although they jettisoned more of their possessions on the way, De Long insisted on carrying his maps and journals. His entry for October 10 recorded that there was [...] "nothing for supper but a <b>spoonful</b> <b>of</b> glycerine". A few days later [...] Alexey, the group's principal hunter, shot a ptarmigan which provided soup. But Alexey was weakening, and on October 17 he died. On October 20, trapped by the weather and without supplies, the party came to a final halt. [...] Throughout the march De Long had written up his journal each day, but after October 20 his entries became intermittent, largely limited to terse statements of the dying and the dead.

His last entry, dated October 30, records the deaths of Boyd and Görtz and ends [...] "Mr Collins dying".|$|E

She was the best selling Japanese female musical artist of 1975, and 4th best selling of 1976. In the summer of 1975 the single [...] "Juushichi No Natsu" [...] (Seventeen Summers) was released, and became her second best selling single; grossing over 404,000 copies and peaking at number 2 on the Oricon charts. At the 17th edition of the Japan Record Awards [...] "Juushichi No Natsu" [...] won her the award for most popular artist voted by the public.

500|$|Both [...] "Happy Working Song" [...] and [...] "That's How You Know" [...] {{also pay}} tributes to past Disney songs. [...] "Happy Working Song" [...] pays a lyrical homage to such songs as [...] "Whistle While You Work" [...] (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs), [...] "The Work Song" [...] (Cinderella) [...] "A <b>Spoonful</b> <b>of</b> Sugar" [...] (Mary Poppins) and “Making Christmas” (The Nightmare Before Christmas), and a musical {{homage to the}} Sherman Brothers (with a self-parodic [...] "Alan Menken style" [...] middle eight). [...] "That's How You Know" [...] is a self-parody of Menken's {{compositions}} for his Disney features, specifically such big production numbers as [...] "Under the Sea" [...] (The Little Mermaid) and [...] "Be Our Guest" [...] (Beauty and the Beast). To achieve this, Schwartz admitted he had to [...] "push {{it a little bit}} further in terms of choices of words or certain lyrics" [...] while maintaining [...] "the classic Walt Disney sensibility". However, Menken noted that the songs he has written for Disney have always been [...] "a little tongue-in-cheek". As the film progresses, the music uses more contemporary styles, which is heard through the adult ballad [...] "So Close" [...] and the country/pop number [...] "Ever Ever After" [...] (sung by Carrie Underwood as a voice-over).|$|E
500|$|Thomas Newman {{composed}} the film's original score. In regards to incorporating his own musical style to the film's period setting, Newman stated that [...] "there was {{room for a}} real tune-based score here that could reflect the basic joy {{in that kind of}} writing that the Sherman Brothers brought to Mary Poppins. Newman, however, refrained from creating an [...] "adaptation score" [...] of the Shermans' music from the original film. Newman's process of scoring the film included playing themes to filmed scenes, so that he could [...] "listen to what the music does to an image", and not wanting to [...] "clutter the proceedings with music." [...] The flashback sequences to Travers' childhood provided the most work for Newman. He explains that, [...] "You had to turn on a dime to make the transition back to the 'present,' when Travers and the Sherman brothers are working on the script for Mary Poppins. And that was fun, but also musically challenging.” For the score's instrumentation, Newman primarily employed a string orchestra with some woodwinds and brass, as well as including piano and hammered instruments that were [...] "appropriate to the time period", such as dulcimers. The film's score was recorded at the Newman Scoring Stage in Los Angeles, while the cast recorded several of the Shermans' songs at Capitol Studios for use as playback during the film's diegetic music scenes, including [...] "Chim Chim Cher-ee", [...] "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious", [...] "A <b>Spoonful</b> <b>of</b> Sugar", [...] "Fidelity Fiduciary Bank", [...] "Feed the Birds", and [...] "Let's Go Fly a Kite". Walt Disney Records released two editions of the soundtrack on December 10, 2013: a single-disc and a two-disc digipak deluxe edition, containing original demo recordings by the Shermans and selected songs from Mary Poppins.|$|E
