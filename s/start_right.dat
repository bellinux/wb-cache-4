Bogdanovich's agent, Jeff Berg, set up a special screening of his client's soon-to-be released The Last Picture Show (1971) for Foster with McQueen in attendance. They loved it and met with the director and a deal was made. However, Warner Bros. approached Bogdanovich with an offer to direct What's Up, Doc? (1972), starring Barbra Streisand, with the stipulation {{that he had to}} <b>start</b> <b>right</b> away. The director wanted to do both, and the studio refused. When McQueen found out, he became upset and told Bogdanovich {{that he was going to}} get someone else to direct The Getaway.|$|E

25|$|On 28 July 1941, Japanese forces {{occupied}} all of French Indochina. The United States was forewarned of {{this move}} through its monitoring of Japan's cable traffic.

Over 80% of Japan's need was being met through American imports, therefore on 31 July, the navy informed the Emperor that Japan's oil stockpiles would be completely depleted in two years.

25|$|Oklahoma City {{remained}} in the same division after an American Hockey League realignment {{in the summer of}} 2013, but it was renamed from the South Division to the West Division. Todd Nelson started his fourth year as Barons head coach in the 2013–14 season, despite rumors that he may depart following his disappointment with being passed over as the Edmonton Oilers coach after Ralph Krueger's departure. Nelson has two years remaining on his contract and said, but said he may explore job opportunities at other organizations in the future. The Barons saw several departures in the off-season, such as forwards Philippe Cornet, Darcy Hordichuk, Kristiāns Pelšs, and Chris VandeVelde; defensemen Randy Jones and Jordan Henry; and veteran goaltender Yann Danis. Center Mark Arcobello, an AHL-All Star and the team's all-time leading scorer, made the Edmonton roster. Winger Curtis Hamilton remained on the team, but injured his knee in a practice after {{the first game of the}} season and would not <b>start</b> <b>right</b> away. Newcomers to the team included forwards Travis Ewanyk, Matthew Ford, Austin Fyten, Ryan Hamilton, Ryan Jones, Kale Kessy, Philip Larsen, Andrew Miller, Nicholas Tremblay, and Derek Nesbitt; defensemen Martin Gernat, Brad Hunt, Oscar Klefbom and David Musil; and goaltender Richard Bachman, who was backup goal for NHL's Dallas Stars for the last two seasons. Winger Linus Omark, who had previously played for the Barons and Oilers but spent last season with the Swiss team EV Zug, returned to a one-year agreement with Oklahoma City. The new Oklahoma City roster included a mix of young and veteran forwards, as well as a young core of defensemen, with six of the starting eight between ages 20 and 22, as well as Hunt and Taylor Fedun, both of whom were 25.|$|E

2500|$|The {{commander}} of the Army of the Potomac, Maj. Gen. George Meade, and his cavalry commander, Maj. Gen.

[...] Meade reported the comments to Grant, who replied [...] "Did Sheridan say that? Well, he generally knows what he is talking about. Let him <b>start</b> <b>right</b> out and do it."

2500|$|Coltrane's {{spiritual journey}} was {{interwoven}} with his investigation of world music. He believed {{not only in}} a universal musical structure that transcended ethnic distinctions, but {{in being able to}} harness the mystical language of music itself. Coltrane's study of Indian music led him to believe that certain sounds and scales could [...] "produce specific emotional meanings." [...] According to Coltrane, the goal of a musician was to understand these forces, control them, and elicit a response from the audience. Coltrane said: [...] "I would like to bring to people something like happiness. I would like to discover a method so that if I want it to rain, it will <b>start</b> <b>right</b> away to rain. If one of my friends is ill, I'd like to play a certain song and he will be cured; when he'd be broke, I'd bring out a different song and immediately he'd receive all the money he needed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin said, [...] "What {{attracted}} me to [...] {{had nothing}} to do with Facebook. The invention itself is as modern as it gets, but the story is as old as storytelling; the themes of friendship, loyalty, jealousy, class and power. [...] I got a 14-page book proposal that Ben Mezrich had written for his publisher for a book he was going to call The Accidental Billionaires. The publisher was simultaneously shopping it around for a film sale. That's how it wound up in my hands. I was reading it and somewhere on page three I said yes. It was the fastest I said yes to anything. But Ben hadn't written the book yet, and I assumed that Sony was going to want me to wait for Ben to write the book, and I would start a year from now.

2500|$|When Meade quarreled with Sheridan for not {{performing}} his duties of screening and reconnaissance as ordered, Sheridan told Meade {{that he could}} [...] "whip Stuart" [...] if Meade let him. Meade reported the conversation to Grant, who replied, [...] "Well, he generally knows what he is talking about. Let him <b>start</b> <b>right</b> out and do it." [...] Meade deferred to Grant's judgment and issued orders to Sheridan to [...] "proceed against the enemy's cavalry" [...] and from May 9 through May 24, sent him on a raid toward Richmond, directly challenging the Confederate cavalry. The raid was less successful than hoped; although his raid managed to mortally wound Confederate cavalry commander Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart at Yellow Tavern on May 11 and beat Maj. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee at Meadow Bridge on May 12, the raid never seriously threatened Richmond and it left Grant without cavalry intelligence for Spotsylvania and North Anna. Historian Gordon C. Rhea wrote, [...] "By taking his cavalry from Spotsylvania Court House, Sheridan severely handicapped Grant in his battles against Lee. The Union Army was deprived of his eyes and ears during a critical juncture in the campaign. And Sheridan's decision to advance boldly to the Richmond defenses smacked of unnecessary showboating that jeopardized his command." ...|$|E
