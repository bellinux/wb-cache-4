25|$|The Scylla was a {{land-based}} {{development of}} the Short Kent (S.17) flying boat, essentially using the Kent's aerostructure above a redesigned fuselage. It was an all-metal biplane (wingspan of 113ft, 34,44 m) powered originally by four Bristol Jupiter XFBM radial engines mounted on vertical struts between {{the upper and lower}} planes. The square-section braced-framed fuselage was below the lower wing; the tail had a single vertical stabilizer and a horizontal stabilizer at about one quarter height. The Scylla was originally fitted with a Flettner-type <b>servo</b> <b>tab</b> trim control to ease the forces on the rudder controls. An experimental <b>servo</b> <b>tab</b> on the rudder was tested on G-ACJJ Scylla for a time. Experience gained with the latter possibly contributed to a later patent application submitted jointly by Shorts and Dudley Lloyd Parkes on 7 August 1936.|$|E
25|$|The primary flight {{controls}} are intrinsically safe. In {{the event of}} total hydraulic system failure or double engine failure, they will automatically and seamlessly revert to control via <b>servo</b> <b>tab.</b> In this mode, the servo tabs aerodynamically control the elevators and ailerons; these servo tabs are in turn controlled by cables running to the control yoke. The pilot's muscle forces alone control the tabs. For the 737 Next Generation, a six-screen LCD glass cockpit with modern avionics was implemented while retaining crew commonality with previous generation 737.|$|E
2500|$|The G.4/31 first flew, {{powered by}} an uncowled nine cylinder, 635hp (474kW) Bristol Pegasus IIM3 engine on 29 March 1934. Its early form {{became known as}} the Mk.I, but by 22 June it was flying as the cleaned-up Mk II. [...] This {{differed}} chiefly in having a smaller diameter, double row 750hp Armstrong Siddeley Tiger IV engine in a long chord cowling, a lengthened fuselage, a more rounded fin and rudder without the <b>servo</b> <b>tab</b> and a spatted main undercarriage without the tail wheel ventral fin.|$|E
2500|$|Some [...] {{mechanical}} {{flight control}} systems use <b>servo</b> <b>tabs</b> that provide aerodynamic assistance. <b>Servo</b> <b>tabs</b> are small surfaces hinged {{to the control}} surfaces. The flight control mechanisms move these tabs, aerodynamic forces in turn move, or assist {{the movement of the}} control surfaces reducing the amount of mechanical forces needed. This arrangement was used in early piston-engined transport aircraft and in early jet transports. The Boeing 737 incorporates a system, whereby in the unlikely event of total hydraulic system failure, it automatically and seamlessly reverts to being controlled via servo-tab.|$|R
2500|$|The {{all-metal}} {{tail unit}} had a dorsal fin {{integrated with the}} fuselage, and a [...] twin-spar tailplane with inset divided elevators. The control surfaces were mass-balanced, and each had controllable trim and <b>servo</b> <b>tabs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{conventional}} {{tail unit}} incorporated a variable incidence tailplane with rudder and elevators all with trim <b>tabs</b> and <b>servo</b> <b>tabs.</b> Hydraulically actuated ailerons operated {{in conjunction with}} upper surface spoilers inboard of the ailerons and forward of the outer flap segment. All powered controls were also to be provided with manual cable-operated backups.|$|R
2500|$|Changing {{the setting}} of a trim tab adjusts the neutral or resting {{position}} of a control surface (such as an elevator or rudder). As the desired position of a control surface changes (corresponding mainly to different speeds), an adjustable trim tab will allow the operator to reduce the manual force required to maintain that position—to zero, if used correctly. [...] Thus the trim tab acts as a <b>servo</b> <b>tab.</b> [...] Because the center of pressure of the trim tab is further away from the axis of rotation of the control surface than the center of pressure of the control surface, the movement generated by the tab can match the movement generated by the control surface. The position of the control surface on its axis will change until the torque from the control surface and the trim surface balance each other.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} initially {{carried a}} flat-topped fin and rudder, the latter with a conspicuous <b>servo</b> <b>tab.</b> [...] The horizontal surfaces {{were supported by}} struts to the lower fuselage and there were long, narrow anti-spin strakes along to top of the fuselage in [...] front of them. [...] A tailwheel had a small ventral fin in front of it. [...] The pilot's open cockpit, just behind [...] and below the upper wing, was a little unusual in being offset to port; the lower wing cut out was also asymmetric, [...] longer to starboard. [...] The asymmetry allowed a narrow passageway [...] between the observer/gunner's cockpit behind the pilot to a navigator's/bomb aimer's/ casualty cabin within the fuselage between the wings. [...] This windowed cabin had a starboard side door for ground access. [...] Beyond the cabin the fuselage diameter decreased to the radial engine.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the case}} of some large {{aircraft}} the <b>servo</b> <b>tab</b> is the only control that {{is connected to the}} pilot's stick or wheel, as in the Bristol Britannia and its Canadian derivatives. The pilot moves the wheel which moves the <b>servo</b> <b>tab</b> and then the <b>servo</b> <b>tab,</b> using its mechanical advantage, moves the elevator or aileron, which is otherwise free-floating. With a servo-tab variant named [...] "geared spring tab", a pilot is able [...] "to maneuver a vehicle weighing as much as 300,000 pounds flying at an airspeed of 300 miles per hour or more".|$|E
50|$|<b>Servo</b> <b>tabs</b> {{move in the}} {{opposite}} direction of the control surface. The tab has a leverage advantage, being located well aft of the surface hinge line, and thus can use the relative airflow to deflect the control surface in {{the opposite}} direction. This has the effect of reducing the control force required by the pilot to move the controls.|$|R
50|$|The C.570 had a twin tail {{with its}} {{tailplane}} mounted {{at the top}} of the fuselage. Together with the elevators it was trapezoidal in plan; the fins were of the endplate type, oval in profile and with rudders split into two sections to allow elevator movement. Both horizontal and vertical control surfaces had Flettner-type <b>servo</b> <b>tabs.</b> Below the tail was a fixed tailwheel.|$|R
2500|$|The wooden {{empennage}} was conventional, {{with a wire}} braced, {{constant chord}} tailplane mounted around one third fin height; its construction {{was similar to that}} of the wing. A photograph from mid-1934, at about the time of its first flight, shows the 110 with a trapezoidal fin, {{similar to that of the}} earlier CAMS 55. [...] Both the vertical-edged rudder and elevators had full-span, Flettner type <b>servo</b> <b>tabs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|During World War I, Flettner {{developed}} the <b>servo</b> <b>tab</b> / anti-servo tab. [...] The <b>servo</b> <b>tab</b> {{evolved into the}} [...] "trim tab" [...] which is still in use on all airplanes and many large vessels. [...] Trim tabs are extremely useful in moving large rudders on vessels with vastly reduced power.|$|E
5000|$|Trimm-Tab (Flettner <b>Servo</b> <b>tab)</b> systems, {{wind vane}} {{coupled with a}} small flap {{attached}} at the main rudder, an auxiliary rudder or a servo pendulum rudder ...|$|E
5000|$|... a <b>servo</b> <b>tab</b> used to {{move the}} main control surface, as well as act as a trim tab. Usually {{controlled}} by a cockpit wheel or crank.|$|E
25|$|The wings were {{constructed}} using corrugated duralumin box spars and tubular rib assemblies, with a fabric covering and Frise ailerons {{on the upper}} and lower wings. Duralumin walkways were provided to allow ready access to the engines for maintenance purposes. The tail unit consisted of braced monoplane horizontal and vertical stabilizers; the tailplane was fitted with Flettner-type <b>servo</b> <b>tabs</b> for trimming on the Short Scylla which had the same wings and tail as the Kent.|$|R
50|$|Carried an {{increased}} payload comparing {{to the earlier}} G.Va, and operated at a maximum takeoff weight of 4,550 kg (10,030 lb). To reduce the danger of flipping over during landing, Gothaer introduced the Stossfahrgestell ("shock landing gear"), a tandem two-bogie main landing gear. The Stossfahrgestell proved so good that it was fitted to all G.V's in Bogohl 3. Some G.Vb aircraft also had Flettner <b>servo</b> <b>tabs</b> on the ailerons to reduce control forces.|$|R

5000|$|... in {{the case}} of the elevator, an all-moving {{horizontal}} stabilizer, called a stabilator, the position of which can be adjusted in flight by a <b>servo</b> <b>tab</b> or an anti-servo tab.|$|E
50|$|A <b>servo</b> <b>tab</b> {{is a small}} hinged device {{installed}} on an aircraft control surface to assist {{the movement of the}} control surfaces. Introduced by the German firm Flettner, servo tabs were formerly known as Flettner tabs.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the absence}} of a {{conventional}} rudder the Habicht had drag rudders. [...] These were leading edge flaps placed near the tips and formed by mounting the leading edge surfaces on a hinge so they could open upwards and downwards (those of the Horten H.I had extended downwards only). [...] Their differential operational controlled yaw and they served as conventional airbrakes when opened together. The whole trailing edge was occupied by control surfaces; the outer panels had elevons outboard and landing flaps inboard and there were further landing flaps on the centre section. Rear control surfaces were assisted by Flettner <b>servo</b> <b>tabs</b> and were ply covered.|$|R
2500|$|By November 1941, many of {{the initial}} assembly-line {{challenges}} had been met, which freed up time for the engineering team to tackle the problem of frozen controls in a dive. Lockheed had a few ideas for tests that would help them find an answer. The first solution tried was the fitting of spring-loaded <b>servo</b> <b>tabs</b> on the elevator trailing edge designed to aid the pilot when control yoke forces rose over , {{as would be expected}} in a high-speed dive. At that point, the tabs would begin to multiply the effort of the pilot's actions. The expert test pilot, 43-year-old Ralph Virden, was given a specific high-altitude test sequence to follow and was told to restrict his speed and fast maneuvering in denser air at low altitudes, since the new mechanism could exert tremendous leverage under those conditions. A note was taped to the instrument panel of the test craft underscoring this instruction. On 4 November 1941, Virden climbed into YP-38 #1 and completed the test sequence successfully, but 15 minutes later was seen in a steep dive followed by a high-G pullout. The tail unit of the aircraft failed at about [...] during the high-speed dive recovery; Virden was killed in the subsequent crash. The Lockheed design office was justifiably upset, but their design engineers could only conclude that <b>servo</b> <b>tabs</b> were not the solution for loss of control in a dive. Lockheed still had to find the problem; the Army Air Forces personnel were sure it was flutter and ordered Lockheed to look more closely at the tail.|$|R
50|$|The LIBIS-17, {{originally}} {{known as}} the LIBIS KB-17, was designed to provide tandem seat training in advanced gliding flight, including aerobatics and cloud flying, as well as solo experience to gold and silver C standard as a single seater. It had a high wing of 5° dihedral, built around a single spar. The leading edge was a plywood torsion box, supported by Styrofoam, {{and the rest of}} the wing was fabric covered. The ailerons were of the Frise type, wooden, foam filled and fabric covered. It had Hütter type plate spoilers just behind the spar. Both vertical and horizontal rear stabilizers were all-moving, single piece surfaces, fitted with <b>servo</b> <b>tabs.</b> Both were wooden structures, near-rectangular in shape, with Styrofoam filling.|$|R
5000|$|An {{evolution}} of the C design the E is a new design which incorporates tricycle landing gear, including a fixed, non-steerable nosewheel, but no brakes. Some E models have been flown on floats. The standard engine is a [...] Cuyuna 215R or a Yamaha go-cart engine. The E maintains {{the use of a}} weight-shift sling seat acting on the rudder, although it also acts on the elevator through a <b>servo</b> <b>tab</b> attached to the seat to boost weight-shift control authority.|$|E
50|$|The primary flight {{controls}} are intrinsically safe.

Its early form {{became known as}} the Mk.I, but by 22 June it was flying as the cleaned-up Mk II. [...] This {{differed}} chiefly in having a smaller diameter, double row 750 hp Armstrong Siddeley Tiger IV engine in a long chord cowling, a lengthened fuselage, a more rounded fin and rudder without the <b>servo</b> <b>tab</b> and a spatted main undercarriage without the tail wheel ventral fin.|$|E
2500|$|With its low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane layout, retractable, wide-set conventional {{landing gear}} and enclosed cockpit, the Zero {{was one of the}} most modern carrier based aircraft in the world at the time of its introduction. It had a fairly high-lift, low-speed wing with very low wing loading. This, combined with its light weight, resulted in a very low stalling speed of well below [...] This was the main reason for its phenomenal maneuverability, allowing it to out-turn any Allied fighter of the time. Early models were fitted with <b>servo</b> <b>tabs</b> on the ailerons after pilots complained that control forces became too heavy at speeds above [...] [...] They were discontinued on later models after it was found that the lightened control forces were causing pilots to overstress the wings during vigorous maneuvers.|$|R
50|$|Several {{additional}} problems {{turned up}} during testing. stick forces were very low, {{but this was}} easily addressed by making the <b>servo</b> <b>tabs</b> 50% larger. A more worrying development was that the engines all had problems with mixture due to changes in engine speed or load, which led to rough engine operation. In August, while Bede was demonstrating the BD-5 (N501BD) to the FAA {{in order to receive}} permission to fly at Oshkosh, the engine seized. On its deadstick landing, the aircraft overran the runway, buckling the nose gear. Incorrect mixture was identified as the cause of a second wreck of N501BD, in September 1972, when the mixture control broke and Berven had to execute another forced landing. This landing resulted in damage to all the gear and the fuselage as well.|$|R
50|$|With its low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane layout, retractable, wide-set conventional {{landing gear}} and enclosed cockpit, the Zero {{was one of the}} most modern carrier based aircraft in the world at the time of its introduction. It had a fairly high-lift, low-speed wing with very low wing loading. This, combined with its light weight, resulted in a very low stalling speed of well below 60 kn. This was the main reason for its phenomenal maneuverability, allowing it to out-turn any Allied fighter of the time. Early models were fitted with <b>servo</b> <b>tabs</b> on the ailerons after pilots complained that control forces became too heavy at speeds above 300 km/h. They were discontinued on later models after it was found that the lightened control forces were causing pilots to overstress the wings during vigorous maneuvers.|$|R
50|$|An anti-servo tab, or anti-balance tab, {{works in}} the {{opposite}} way to a <b>servo</b> <b>tab.</b> It deploys {{in the same direction}} as the control surface, making the movement of the control surface more difficult and requires more force applied to the controls by the pilot. This may seem counter-productive, but it is commonly used on aircraft where the controls are too light or the aircraft requires additional stability in that axis of movement. The anti-servo tab serves mainly to make the controls heavier in feel to the pilot and also to increase stability. An anti-servo tab also functions as a trim device to relieve control pressure and maintain the stabilator in the desired position.|$|E
50|$|When a <b>servo</b> <b>tab</b> is employed, it {{is moved}} into the {{slipstream}} opposite to the control surface's desired deflection. For example, in order to trim an elevator to hold the nose down, the elevator's trim tab will actually rise up into the slipstream. The increased pressure {{on top of the}} trim tab surface caused by raising it will then deflect the entire elevator slab down slightly, causing the tail to rise and the aircraft's nose to move down. In the case of an aircraft where deployment of high-lift devices (flaps) would significantly alter the longitudinal trim, a supplementary trim tab is arranged to simultaneously deploy with the flaps so that pitch attitude is not markedly changed.|$|E
50|$|The {{fuselage}} initially {{carried a}} flat-topped fin and rudder, the latter with a conspicuous <b>servo</b> <b>tab.</b> The horizontal surfaces {{were supported by}} struts to the lower fuselage and there were long, narrow anti-spin strakes along to top of the fuselage in front of them.

The asymmetry allowed a narrow passageway between the observer/gunner's cockpit behind the pilot to a navigator's/bomb aimer's/ casualty cabin within the fuselage between the wings. This windowed cabin had a starboard side door for ground access. Beyond the cabin the fuselage diameter decreased to the radial engine.|$|E
50|$|The oval {{cross-section}} fuselage of the Delfin tapers {{gently to}} the rear to an integral fin. All Delfins were built with a fin and rudder strongly swept on both {{leading and trailing edges}} and with an all-moving tailplane, fitted with <b>servo</b> <b>tabs,</b> mounted on the fuselage. Four Delfin 2s were later modified into Delfin 3s with a more upright vertical tail and a fin-mounted fixed tailplane with conventional elevators. The Delfin cockpit is long, with the pilot seated in a semi-reclining position. On Delfin 1s, it is covered by a long, forward sliding, single piece canopy reaching almost to the nose but later marks have a shorter, starboard hinged one piece canopy, with the upper nose surface plywood skinned {{like the rest of the}} fuselage. The undercarriage consists of a fixed, unsprung, semi-protruding monowheel and a small tail bumper. A rubber spring nose skid was added to the Delfin 2.|$|R
50|$|The low-set, {{straight}} wing has a double-taper planform, 2½-deg dihedral {{from the}} roots, {{a relatively low}} aspect ratio, and 100 L fuel tanks permanently attached to the wingtips. The trailing edge has double-slotted trailing edge flaps inboard of mass-balanced ailerons; the flaps are separated from the ailerons by small wing fences. An automatic trimming system was present, the flaps and the trim system being connected in order to counteract the potentially large pitch changes {{that would otherwise be}} generated by vigorous movements of the flaps. The tall, swept vertical tail has an inset rudder. Variable-incidence horizontal stabilizers with inset elevators are mounted {{at the base of the}} rudder and over the exhaust nozzle. Side-by-side airbrakes are located under the fuselage ahead of the wing's leading edge. The flaps, landing gear, wheel brakes and air brakes are powered by a hydraulic system. Controls are pushrod-actuated and have electrically powered <b>servo</b> <b>tabs</b> on the ailerons and rudder. Operational g-force limits at 4,200 kg are +8/-4 g.|$|R
50|$|The wings were {{constructed}} using corrugated duralumin box spars and tubular rib assemblies, with a fabric covering and Frise ailerons {{on the upper}} and lower wings. Duralumin walkways were provided to allow ready access to the engines for maintenance purposes. The tail unit consisted of braced monoplane horizontal and vertical stabilizers; the tailplane was fitted with Flettner-type <b>servo</b> <b>tabs</b> for trimming on the Short Scylla which had the same wings and tail as the Kent. The anodised duralumin fuselage was mounted below the lower wing, with the planing bottom of the hull made of stainless steel (as on the Singapore II) with a transverse main step. The use of stainless steel reduced the frequency of land inspections of the hull. The bimetallic corrosion problems experienced on the Singapore II hull had been solved; Short Brothers became the first company to master the technique of building seaplane floats and flying boat hulls in this combination of metals.|$|R
