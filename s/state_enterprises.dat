To quell social unrest, provincial governors padded their payrolls. The government had embarked on a pension reform with costs reaching 3% of GDP in 2000, as it still had to pay pensioners but no longer received contributions.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} my thesis is {{to analyze the}} <b>State</b> <b>Enterprise</b> Act. The main aim is to {{describe}} the life of <b>state</b> <b>enterprise</b> from its foundation to its termination and {{to point out the}} major legal issues. My desire was to recommend some improvements to legal regulation of the <b>state</b> <b>enterprise.</b> My thesis is divided into several chapters, each of them dealing with different aspects of the <b>state</b> <b>enterprise.</b> The first theoretical chapter examines the question whether the <b>state</b> <b>enterprise</b> is a legal entity on the background of civil doctrine. The next chapter deals with the foundation process of the <b>state</b> <b>enterprise.</b> Who is authorized to create the <b>state</b> <b>enterprise</b> and what are the essential elements of the charter of foundation. It describes the process of signing into the Commercial Register and its legal impact. This thesis also provides a view to the relationship between the authorized representatives and the <b>state</b> <b>enterprise.</b> It shall answer the questions about the powers of governing bodies and their liability. The next part is devoted to the administration of state-owned property by the <b>state</b> <b>enterprise.</b> It examines the right of state to obtain the profit made by <b>state</b> <b>enterprise.</b> This chapter also deals with the public procurement related to the <b>state</b> <b>enterprise.</b> The last theoretical chapter [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Although the Convertibility {{plan had}} {{positive}} consequences {{in the short}} term, it caused problems that surfaced later. Large numbers of employees of privatized <b>state</b> <b>enterprises</b> were fired, and unemployment grew to over 10%. Big compensation payments prevented an immediate public reaction. The free trade, and the expensive costs in dollars, forced private companies {{to reduce the number}} of workers as well, or risk bankruptcy. Unions were unable to resist the changes. People with low incomes, such as retirees and state workers, suffered under tax increases while their wages remained frozen. The provinces of Santiago del Estero, Jujuy and San Juan had their first violent riots. To compensate for these problems, the government started a number of social welfare programs, and restored protectionist policies over some sectors of the economy. It was difficult for Argentine companies to export, and easy imports damaged most national producers. The national budget soon slid into deficit.|$|E
5|$|Congress sanctioned the {{economic}} emergency {{law and the}} state reform law. The first allowed the president to reduce or remove subsidies, and the latter to privatize <b>state</b> <b>enterprises</b> – the first being telephones and airlines. These privatizations were beneficial to foreign creditors, who replaced their bonds with company shares. Despite increased tax revenue, and the money from privatizations, the economy was still unstable. The Bunge and Born businessmen left the government in late 1989, amid {{a second round of}} hyperinflation. The first measure of the new minister of economy, Érman González, was a mandatory conversion of time deposits into government bonds: the Bonex plan. It generated more recession, but hyperinflation was reduced. He also reduces social spending, including those for people with disabilities.|$|E

Nouakchott was planned with the expectation that commerce and other economic activities would not take place in the city. Nouakchott's central business district was planned with broad streets and a grid-like structure; the new Cinquième Quartier (Fifth District) was located close to this area and became the location of a large open-air market and residential area within a few years. During the 1960s, the city obtained its own local government. By the 1970s, these new areas had grown so much that they replaced the old ksar in terms of importance, as they also hosted the governmental buildings and <b>state</b> <b>enterprises.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} {{months of the}} Chamorro administration, social {{programs}} including free bus tokens for the education sector, pensions {{for the elderly and}} disabled, child care and child development services, and health care initiatives were cut. By 1991 the austerity measures adopted by Chamorro's administration were leading to massive strikes. Chamorro chose to recognize the workers' right to 25% of the shares of privatized <b>state</b> <b>enterprises</b> despite of the disapproval that generated both at home and abroad. The Sandinistas, who had removed some of the businesses from the private sector during their administration were not in favor of privatization, but they were in favor of workers sharing in the revenues. The far-right of her own coalition was against making labor compromises of any kind. The US embassy and United States Agency for International Development both voiced displeasure at the concessions and speed with which the economic plan was being implemented. In spite of the other programs implemented, inflation was reduced by the renegotiation of the country's debt (called for by the Lacayo Plan). Through negotiations, Nicaragua was able to obtain a writedown of 75% of their international debt on the condition that they had no arrears. As noted previously, the US assisted Nicaragua in paying off the past-due debt to the IMF, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank through bridge loans and negotiating a 95% writedown of debts owed to Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela. These measures provided the means to end hyperinflation and reopen monetary markets, but they were overshadowed by high unemployment, underemployment and an overall recession. The trade deficit rose and GNP declined, and overall, low wages, reductions of education and health services caused poverty to escalate, and social tensions to rise.|$|E
5|$|Realizing {{the need}} for new leadership, in {{what became known as the}} Polish October, the Politburo chose Gomułka, who had been {{released}} from prison and reinstated in the party, and the Central Committee's 8th Plenum elected him without a Soviet approval the new first secretary of the PZPR. Subsequently, Gomułka convinced the Soviet leaders that he would preserve the Soviet influence in Poland. Gomułka's elevation was preceded by ominous Soviet military moves and an arrival of Soviet high-level delegation led by Khrushchev, which flew into Warsaw to witness and influence the upheaval in the Polish party. After the sometimes confrontational encounters and negotiations, they soon returned to Moscow, where the Soviet leader announced on 21 October that the idea of an armed intervention in Poland should be abandoned. This position was soon reinforced by the pressure from communist China, which expressed its great power aspirations and demanded that the Soviets leave the new Polish leadership alone. On 21 October in Warsaw Gomułka's return to power was accomplished, giving rise to the era of national communism in Poland. Gomułka pledged to dismantle Stalinism and in his acceptance speech raised numerous social democratic-sounding reformist ideas, giving hope to the left-wing revisionists and others in Polish society that the communist state was, after all, reformable. The revisionists replaced and claimed to represent the worker movement, recently defeated in Poznań. The main goals in pursuit of which they engaged were political freedom and self-management in <b>state</b> <b>enterprises.</b> However, the end of Soviet influence in Eastern Europe was nowhere in sight. On 14 May 1955, the Warsaw Pact was signed in the Polish capital, to counteract the earlier establishment of NATO.|$|E

25|$|By the mid-1980s, {{domestic}} debt nearly displaced {{foreign debt}} as Brazil's main economic problem. During the high-growth 1970s, {{a significant portion}} of foreign borrowing had been by <b>state</b> <b>enterprises,</b> which were the main actors in the import substitution industrialization strategy. Initially, they borrowed to finance their investments. However, {{toward the end of the}} decade, with the acute shortage of foreign exchange, the government forced <b>state</b> <b>enterprises</b> to borrow unnecessarily, increasing their indebtedness markedly. Their situation worsened with the sharp rise in international interest rates in the late 1970s, the devaluations of the austerity program, and the decreasing real prices of goods and services provided by the public enterprises stemming from price controls. Because the <b>state</b> <b>enterprises</b> were not allowed to go bankrupt, their debt burden was transferred gradually to the government, further increasing the public debt. This, and a growing disorganization of the public sector, transformed the public debt into a major economic problem. By the mid-1980s, the financial burden stemming from the debt was contributing decisively to its rapid expansion.|$|E

Despite Deng's death in 1997, reforms continued under his handpicked successors, Jiang Zemin and Zhu Rongji, who were ardent reformers. In 1997 and 1998, large-scale privatization occurred, in which all <b>state</b> <b>enterprises,</b> except a few large monopolies, were liquidated and their assets sold to private investors. Between 2001 and 2004, the number of state-owned enterprises decreased by 48 percent. During the same period, Jiang and Zhu also reduced tariffs, trade barriers, and regulations; reformed the banking system; dismantled much of the Mao-era social welfare system; forced the PLA to divest itself of military-run businesses; reduced inflation; and joined the World Trade Organization.

40|$|Summary) The {{presented}} paper {{focuses on}} adjusting a <b>state</b> <b>enterprise</b> (<b>state</b> - owned <b>enterprise)</b> as a receding form of public enterprise. It sets upon itself a task of clarification, whether this legal form, {{which has been}} dominant in the past, is henceforth suitable {{for use in the}} present body of laws. Professional literature was studied to acquire relevant knowledge, legal provisions, judicial decisions, and other documents. <b>State</b> <b>enterprise</b> is a specific legal entity conducting business with national property, which has a unique public function and is supposed to generate net operating income. Its institutor can only be a state, that has a similar status as a sole partner of a business entity. Unlike other legal entities engaging in business, the <b>state</b> <b>enterprise</b> doesn't have a legal capacity to acquire assets for itself, but does acquire assets for the state. It is not liable for state obligations and state is not liable for obligations of the enterprise at the same time. This structure causes problems, because it is not consistent with a current legal rule. The paper examines general characteristics of <b>state</b> <b>enterprise,</b> historical development, effective legal enactment, property status of <b>state</b> <b>enterprise,</b> definition of sphere of authority between a founder and business bodies, and business [...] ...|$|R
