30|$|It is {{challenging}} for the physician to reliably assess patient adherence and {{the link between}} non-adherence and inadequate response. Irregularity in the daily dosage may be a contributing factor. Most psychiatrists prefer to assess adherence of patients with bipolar disorder by asking the patient (Vieta et al. 2012), but physician perceptions are often incorrect and optimistic (Velligan et al. 2009; Baldessarini et al. 2008). For example, physicians overestimated adherence with second-generation antipsychotics, primarily by patients with bipolar disorder, as compared to claims data (Stephenson et al. 2012). For 97 patients who went to an emergency room for an exacerbation of psychosis, including 26 with bipolar disorder, <b>staff</b> <b>assessments</b> of adherence and non-adherence were correct 41.5 and 75 % of the time respectively, when compared to plasma antipsychotic levels (Lopez et al. 2017).|$|R
40|$|This study {{concerns}} {{the application of}} a model of effective interpersonal relationships to problems arising from <b>staff</b> <b>assessment</b> at I. C. I. Ltd. Corporate Laboratory between 1972 and 1974. In collaboration with academic and industrial supervision, the study commenced with a survey of management and supervisor opinions about the effectiveness of current staff (work) relationships, with particular reference to the problem of recognising and developing creative potential. This survey emphasised a need to improve the relationships between staff in the <b>staff</b> <b>assessment</b> context. A survey of research into creativity emphasised the importance of the interpersonal environment for obtaining creative behaviour in an organisation context. A further survey of theories of how inter­personal behaviour related to personal creativity (therapeutic psychology) provided a model of effective interpersonal behaviour (Carkhuff, 1969) that could be applied to the organisation context of <b>staff</b> <b>assessment.</b> The objective of the project was redefined as a need to improve the conditions of interpersonal behaviour in relation to certain (career development) problems arising from <b>staff</b> <b>assessment</b> practices. In order to demonstrate the application of the model of effective interpersonal behaviour, the research student recorded interviews between himself and members of staff designed to develop and operate the dimensions of the model. Different samples of staff were used to develop the 'facilitative' and the 'action oriented' dimensions of bahaviour, and then for the operation of a helping programme (based on vocational guidance tests). These interactions have been analysed, according to the scales of measurement in the model ana the results are presented in case study form in this thesis. At each stage of the project, results and conclusions were presented to the sponsoring organisation (e. g. industrial supervisor) in order to assess their (subjective) opinion of relevance to the organ­ isation. Finally, recommendations on further actions towards general improvement of the work relationships in the laboratory were presented in a brief report to the sponsor...|$|E

Depending on religious affiliations, some local congregations have oversight from a higher organizational structure.

Two areas of difficulty and negative reaction to the study of church assessment practices include the lack of knowledge of assessment procedures, and attitudes of many Christians regarding performance assessment.

40|$|Background: Since 1994, Taiwanese medical {{universities}} have employed the multiple application method comprising "recommendations and screening" and "admission application. " The {{purpose of this}} study is to examine whether medical students admitted using different admission programs gave different performances. Methods: To evaluate the six core competencies for medical students proposed by Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), this study employed various assessment tools, including student opinion feedback, multi-source feedback (MSF), course grades, and examination results. MSF contains self-assessment scale, peer assessment scale, nursing <b>staff</b> <b>assessment</b> scale, visiting <b>staff</b> <b>assessment</b> scale, and chief resident assessment scale. In the subscales, the CronbachÊs alpha were higher than 0. 90, indicating good reliability. Research participants consisted of 182 students from the School of Medicine at Chang Gung University. Results: Regarding studentsÊ average grade for the medical ethics course, the performance of students who were enrolled through school recommendations exceeded that of students who were enrolled through the National College University Entrance Examination (NCUEE) p = 0. 011), and all considered "teamwork" as the most important. Different entry pipelines of students in the "communication," "work attitude," "medical knowledge," and "teamwork" assessment scales showed no significant difference. The improvement rate of the students who were enrolled through the school recommendations was better than that of the students who were enrolled through the N CUEE in the "professional skills," "medical core competencies," "communication," and "teamwork" projects of self-assessment and peer assessment scales. However, the students who were enrolled through the NCUEE were better in the "professional skills," "medical core competencies," "communication," and "teamwork" projects of the visiting <b>staff</b> <b>assessment</b> scale and the chief resident assessment scale. Conclusion: Collectively, the performance of the students enrolled through recommendations was slightly better than that of the students enrolled through the NCUEE, although statistical significance was found in certain parts of the grades only...|$|E

40|$|Higher {{education}} institutions have increasingly invested in integrating Information and Communication Technology (ICT) into {{learning and teaching}} activities. However, the success of e-learning initiatives is influenced by academic staff’s beliefs and attitudes towards e-learning quality, concerns about new teaching situations, increased workload, insufficient technical and pedagogical skills and availability of institutional support. This mixed methods study aims to investigate the perceptions of academic staff in five public universities in Saudi Arabia (n= 518) about the actual and desired institutional support that is provided or should be provided by their institutions to motivate them to adopt Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs). Additionally, it aims to compare that actual and desired institutional support. The study also seeks {{to determine whether there}} are statistical significant differences in academic <b>staff’s</b> <b>assessment</b> of actual and desired institutional support according to their university, faculty, gender, main purpose of using VLEs and attitude toward participation in e-learning. In terms of actual institutional support, academic staff reported that their universities rarely provide the required institutional support (mean= 2. 29). They rated all seven sections of institutional support (i. e. supportive institutional practices, technical support, pedagogical support, technical training, pedagogical training, flexibility of training programmes, and institutional incentives) as rarely provided with means ranging between 2. 06 and 2. 59. In addition, the study revealed statistically significant differences in academic <b>staff’s</b> <b>assessment</b> of actual instuitional support according to their university, faculty, gender, main purpose and attitude toward participation in e-learning. In terms of desired institutional support, academic staff confirmed the importance of institutional support (mean= 4. 41). The results indicated that the seven sections of support are highly desired with means ranging between 4. 28 and 4. 60. Also, the results indicated statistically significant differences in academic <b>staff’s</b> <b>assessment</b> of desired institutional support according to their university, faculty, main purpose and attitude toward participation in e-learning. In terms of differences between actual and desired institutional support, paired t-test results revealed statistical significant differences between the actual and desired institutional support. According to academic staff, the widest gap between actual and desired support is in section five, “pedagogical training” (mean= 2. 06 and mean= 4. 45). On the other hand, they reported the smallest gap in section four, “technical training” (mean= 2. 59 and mean= 4. 42). The main contribution {{of this study is to}} provide a model based on the study findings; thus, an “Institutional Support Model” was proposed to assist universities to provide the required support for their academic staff. The model suggests forty-four items of support integrated into seven main areas of support: Institutional Support Practices (ten items), Technical Support (six items), Pedagogical Support (six items), Technical Training (six items), Pedagogical Training (six items), Flexibility of Training Programmes (five items) and Institutional Incentives (five items). In addition, many customised models can be generated from the quantitative results according to academic staff’s characteristics. ...|$|R

40|$|The Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSP) {{framework}} {{introduced by}} the World Bank and the IMF {{at the turn of}} the century goes well beyond the mainly macroeconomic conditionalities of the structural adjustment era by requesting that civil society participates in the preparation and the implementation of the strategy. Although constituting a significant shift in the international financial institutions’ discourse, the difference in the way in which the traditional and the “participation” conditions are scrutinized for compliance, considerably reduces the compulsory nature of the latter conditionality. Whereas clear standards and criteria are developed to evaluate compliance with the economic conditionalities, such standards seem to be lacking in the case of participation.
