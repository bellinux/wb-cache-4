Different lengths of legs and bills enable {{multiple}} <b>species</b> <b>to</b> feed {{in the same}} habitat, particularly on the coast, without direct competition for food.

5|$|A {{study of}} 32 {{basidiomycete}} mushrooms showed that Mutinus elegans {{was the only}} <b>species</b> <b>to</b> show antibiotic (both antibacterial and antifungal) activity against all six microorganisms tested, namely, the human pathogenic bacteris Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and the yeast Candida albicans.|$|E
5|$|Agaricales {{specialist}} Rolf Singer included Suillus brevipes in the subsection Suillus of genus Suillus, an infrageneric (a {{taxonomic level}} below genus) grouping of species {{characterized by a}} cinnamon-brown spore print, and pores less than 1mm wide. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of ribosomal DNA sequences shows that the most closely related <b>species</b> <b>to</b> Suillus brevipes include S.luteus, S.pseudobrevipes, and S.weaverae (formerly Fuscoboletinus weaverae).|$|E
40|$|There are 26 {{species of}} large mammals in Xinjiang, among of them, 2 <b>species</b> belong <b>to</b> Canidae, 1 <b>species</b> belongs <b>to</b> Ursidae, 1 <b>species</b> belong <b>to</b> Mustelidae, 3 <b>species</b> belong <b>to</b> Felidae, 3 <b>species</b> belong <b>to</b> Equidae, 1 <b>species</b> belongs <b>to</b> Camelidae, 1 <b>species</b> belongs <b>to</b> Suidae, 5 <b>species</b> belong <b>to</b> Cervidae, 9 <b>species</b> belong <b>to</b> Bovidae. All {{of them are}} {{classified}} as protected animals except wolf and Roe deer. Large mammals reportedly have steadily declined in recent decades throughout the species range. This perceived decline {{is thought to be}} due to the deterioration of environment, habitat lost and hunting. However, the endangered situation of large mammals have been realized by public and government. As a result, more and more natural reserves were built in Xinjiang, more and mote, protection project on wildlife were carried out...|$|R

5|$|Arctic terns are {{considered}} threatened or {{a species of}} concern in certain states. They are also among the <b>species</b> <b>to</b> which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds applies. The species reduced population in New England in the late nineteenth-century because of hunting for the millinery trade.

5|$|Cetiosauriscus longus: In 1990, John Stanton McIntosh {{recombined}} Cetiosaurus longus as {{a species}} of Cetiosauriscus. This classification is not accepted and Cetiosauriscus longus is a junior objective synonym of Cetiosaurus longus because it cannot be proven to possess any characteristic autapomorphies of Cetiosauriscus. In 1993, Charig found the <b>species</b> <b>to</b> be a nomen dubium.|$|E

5|$|Cortinarius violaceus {{mushrooms}} are considered edible, {{but they are}} not choice; instead, the primary appeal of the <b>species</b> <b>to</b> mushroom hunters, according to Arora, is its beauty.

40|$|AbstractAmong the 57 {{species of}} ants {{collected}} from 366 forest sites, 16 candidate species whose abundance has a close relation with temperature {{were selected to}} predict the changes in distribution and abundance according to the A 1 B climate change scenario.

Based on the qualitative estimation, the abundance of 10 species among the 31 <b>species</b> is predicted <b>to</b> increase, whereas that of 21 <b>species</b> is projected <b>to</b> decrease. The abundance of 32 species among 57 <b>species</b> was expected <b>to</b> decrease due to climate changes, whereas 15 <b>species</b> was expected <b>to</b> increase; the number of <b>species</b> expected <b>to</b> decrease was more than two times that of species {{that are expected to}} increase...|$|R

40|$|How <b>species</b> respond <b>to</b> {{changes in}} {{environmental}} variability {{has been shown}} for single species, but the question remains whether these results are transferable <b>to</b> <b>species</b> when incorporated in ecological communities. Here, we address this issue by analysing the same <b>species</b> exposed <b>to</b> a range of environmental variabilities when (i) isolated or (ii) embedded in a food web. We find that all species in food webs exposed to temporally uncorrelated environments (white noise) show {{the same type of}} dynamics as isolated species, whereas species in food webs exposed to positively autocorrelated environments (red noise) can respond completely differently compared with isolated species. This is owing <b>to</b> <b>species</b> following their equilibrium densities in a positively autocorrelated environment that in turn enables <b>species</b> <b>species</b> interactions <b>to</b> come into play. Our results give new insights into <b>species</b> response <b>to</b> environmental variation. They especially highlight the importance of considering both species interactions and environmental autocorrelation when studying population dynamics in a fluctuating environment.
