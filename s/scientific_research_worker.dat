Likewise, the essence of the scientific work is also viewed as an activity aiming at discovering new knowledge and its use for new changes. The importance of invention and scientific research work is stressed for economy and development of the country. The personality of the inventor and of the <b>scientific</b> <b>research</b> <b>worker</b> is described as the subject of inventiveness and creativity. Of special consideration are scientific research workers of universities and scientific institutions as possible inventors; the accompanying recommendation refers to the need for transforming a scientific result into a contrivance.

40|$|CDK {{activation}} requires activating phosphorylation of a conserved residue in the T-loop by the CAK (CDK-activating kinase). In both fission yeast {{and higher}} eukaryotes, CAK is a trimeric complex composed of Mcs 6 -Mcs 2 -Pmh 1 or its homologue [1 – 3]. Two hybrid assays revealed interaction of both Mcs 2 and Pmh 1 with Shp 1, a subunit of the SCF ubiquitin ligase. This prompted us {{to test the}} stability of these CAK regulators. Although the steady-state level of Mcs 2 {{does not seem to}} change during the cell cycle [4], we show that it is strongly correlated to Mcs 6 kinase activity and that Mcs 2 was nearly undetectable when Mcs 6 was strongly overexpressed. Interestingly, this effect is reversed by a mutation in shp 1. Taken together, these results suggest a putative regulation of Mcs 2 by Mcs 6 phosphorylation and SCF ubiquitin ligase complex. Thus, the hypothesis is under investigation. (1) Hermand D, Westerling T. Pihlak A, et al. 2001. EMBO J 20 : 82 – 90. (2) Hermand D, Pihlak A, Westerling T, et al. 1998. EMBO J 17 : 7230 – 7238.

30|$|In recent years, bibliometric {{method has}} been {{identified}} as a new strategy for figuring out useful points quickly and exactly from massive information. It can be used to evaluate the development of a domain mathematically during a given period. Zyoud et al. [16] offered guidance to future research on lithium toxicity by studying relative publications for nearly a century with bibliometric method. Zhang et al. [17] made a bibliometric analysis in water footprint and found that factors such as water-food-energy nexus and driving mechanism of water footprint variation promoted the development of this field. Yataganbaba et al. [18] introduced bibliometric measures into phase change material and encapsulation subjects and provided insights for the future research. CiteSpace is designed as a knowledge domain visualization software [19]. And the central concepts of this tool are burst detection, betweenness centrality, and heterogeneous networks [20]. In addition, it can present results in an easy understanding visual format through the diagrams [21]. As a result of above reasons, CiteSpace is gaining increasingly prevalence among <b>scientific</b> <b>research</b> <b>workers</b> [22, 23].|$|R
