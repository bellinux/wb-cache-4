5|$|The {{premiere of}} The Bartered Bride {{took place at}} the Provisional Theatre on 30 May 1866. Smetana conducted; the stage designs were by Josef Macourek and Josef Jiři Kolár {{produced}} the opera. The role of Mařenka was sung by the theatre's principal soprano, Eleonora von Ehrenberg – who had refused to appear in The Brandenburgers because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>her</b> proffered role was beneath her. The parts of Krušina, Jeník and Kecal were all taken by leading members of the Brandenburgers cast. A celebrated actor, Jindřich Mošna, was engaged to play the Ringmaster, a role which involves little singing skill.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Stafford {{said there}} were good and bad points to working closely with Weston. His {{knowledge}} of her {{made it easy for}} him to arrange her music, but sometimes it caused difficulties. Weston knew Stafford's abilities and would write or arrange elaborate music because he knew she was capable of performing it. She also said she did not believe she could perform in Broadway musicals because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>her</b> voice was not powerful enough for stage work. In 2003, she recalled that there was often limited rehearsal time before she recorded a song, and how Weston would sometimes slip musical arrangements under the bathroom door as she was in the bath {{getting ready to go to}} the studio.|$|E
25|$|Charles dutifully {{wrote to}} Amanda's mother (who was also his godmother), Lady Brabourne, about his interest. Her answer was supportive, but advised him that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>her</b> {{daughter}} still rather {{young to be}} courted.|$|E
60|$|Elsie's {{smile was}} sympathetic, for <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> {{understood}} <b>her</b> friend's belief in Rankine's talents.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>her</b> father, {{and with}} an effort {{dismissed}} him from her mind.|$|R
60|$|And {{then she}} gave a little sigh as <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>her</b> son's {{uncertain}} search.|$|R
25|$|In 1965 Ford's {{daughter}} Lynette Storm {{continued in}} the religion after her mother and was photographed with Margaret Ruhe commenting {{that her mother was}} at the 1893 Exposition and that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>her</b> mother had run into the religion there.|$|E
25|$|When White {{returned}} to the US in 1900, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>her</b> stay would be temporary, and she called for church re-organization at the pivotal 1901 General Conference Session. During her later years she wrote extensively for church publications and wrote her final books. During her final years she would travel less frequently as she concentrated upon writing her last works for the church. In 1915, White tripped while entering her study room and broke her hip. Her health subsequently began to decline, and she died on July 16, 1915. After three funeral services, she was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery with her husband.|$|E
500|$|She married J. L. Nipper. A {{year after}} their marriage, the couple moved to Cleveland, Ohio due to J. L.'s job. Out of boredom, Nipper bought an art kit and began painting. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>her</b> first efforts were [...] "horrible", {{but her husband}} liked her work {{and showed it to}} others.|$|E
60|$|She {{clapped her}} hands for joy. Then <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>her</b> father, and drew back from him in tears.|$|R
60|$|She was silent, therefore, and dismayed; {{and looked}} as though <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>her</b> ways and Mary's ways must be different.|$|R
60|$|English Jim merely bowed {{as he went}} out, and Millicent's {{eyes grew}} dim as <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>her</b> treachery to Geoffrey.|$|R
500|$|George W. Bush {{credited}} {{his wife}} with his decision to stop drinking in 1986. She reflected that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>her</b> husband [...] "was drinking too much" [...] amid her knowing {{it was not his}} desired way of living. Approaching him, she related that her father had been alcoholic and it was not a pattern she wished to repeat in their family.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after his}} wife's death, Rosebery left his grieving {{children}} and went {{alone on a}} tour of Spain. Following a visit to El Escorial he wrote on the sepulchral wonders of the building, but added [...] "for the dead alone the Taj is of course supreme." [...] On his return home he had designed for his wife a Victorian Gothic version of the Taj Mahal in miniature. For the remainder of his life he wore black and used black edged writing paper. Once, when talking with his daughter Sybil, he asked her what mourning <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>her</b> mother would have worn had the situation been reversed. Sybil replied, [...] "She would not have worn any, she would have died at once." ...|$|E
500|$|The revelation ruins their relationship. The actresses shared insight: [...] "Ruby {{just wants}} to get some {{security}} back, everything <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>her</b> life was is totally up in the air"; whilst Charlie was [...] "trying desperately to bridge this gap" [...] The events impact Ruby's self-identity, leaving her feeling confused and her backstory succumb the distortion Charlie causes. Ruby starts to ask herself questions such as [...] "Where do I stand now with everything?" [...] and [...] "How do I reconcile this?". Breeds {{said it was a}} [...] "big exploration" [...] and [...] "a journey" [...] for Ruby, with Anderson agreeing. Anderson felt there was a beautiful element to the storyline and opined [...] "Although it is tragic, you feel sorry for Charlie and you can sort of understand where it has all come from." [...] She said that ultimately everyone feels sorry for Ruby, meaning neither are wrong. Furthermore, she said [...] "You are just rooting for them, you just want them to get back to how they were and it {{is a bit of a}} journey." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The English {{girls were}} much worse,' hastily said Gillian, with a flush of alarm, as <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>her</b> own friends being suspected.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't {{make fun}} of me,' said Taffy, as <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>her</b> picture-letter and the mud in the Stranger-man's hair. 'You draw it, Daddy.' ...|$|R
60|$|Of course <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> in <b>her</b> {{own mind}} 'excepting myself!' for {{nothing could have}} made her believe it {{possible}} that anyone could eclipse her.|$|R
500|$|Following her {{acquisition}} of Hill Top Farm in 1905 in Lancashire (now Cumbria), Potter began her most creative and productive {{years as a}} children's author and illustrator. By {{the end of the}} decade, however, she had grown weary of writing for children. Her eyesight was failing, and the demands of operating her farm and caring for her aging parents limited the amount of time and attention she could allocate to the production of books. In 1912 however, she brought Peter Rabbit and his kin together for one last time in The Tale of Mr. Tod. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>her</b> editors too cautious and too concerned about offending the public, and knew she was capable of creating more complex characters and plots. In Mr. Tod she offered her fans two villainous characters [...] Mr. Tod and Tommy Brock, a fox and a badger. The Tale of Mr. Tod and the book to follow in 1913, The Tale of Pigling Bland, were her last completely original works. Her marriage to William Heelis in October 1913 effectively put an end to her career as a children's author and illustrator, but she continued to produce sporadically over the following years at the demand of fans and publisher, though relying upon decades-old ideas and sketches rather than new concepts and illustrations.|$|E
500|$|Another story arc saw Charlie {{reveal that}} her sister Ruby Buckton (Rebecca Breeds) {{is in fact}} her daughter. Charlie gave birth to Ruby after she was raped by Grant Bledcoe (Clayton Watson), when she was younger. Both Anderson and Breeds found the storyline {{challenging}} and felt {{they had to get}} it right. Breeds said it made her nervous but was pleased with the end result. She said she had to let it affect her own emotions to effect the viewing public. [...] "The revelation ruins their relationship, and Anderson said that Charlie was [...] "trying desperately to bridge this gap". Breeds added [...] "Ruby just wants to get some security back, everything <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>her</b> life was is totally up in the air". Ruby becomes confused and starts to ask herself questions such as [...] "Where do I stand now?" [...] and [...] "How do I reconcile this?" [...] Breeds said it was a [...] "big exploration" [...] and a journey for Ruby, with Anderson agreeing. Anderson felt there was a beautiful element to the storyline and opined: [...] "Although it is tragic, you feel sorry for Charlie and you can sort of understand where it has all come from." [...] She added that everyone feels sorry for Ruby, meaning neither are wrong. Furthermore, she said, [...] "You are just rooting for them, you just want them to get back to how they were and it {{is a bit of a}} journey." [...] Comparing the storyline to the lesbian plot she said, [...] "Perhaps this storyline was a little bit harder, you've seen the start of this storyline and there is a lot more to come and it wasn't easy." ...|$|E
2500|$|When the 1876 presidential {{election}} between Rutherford B. Hayes and Samuel Tilden ended in dispute, Julia {{saw an opportunity}} to extend her time in the White House. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>her</b> husband should remain President until the matter could be settled. She admitted that her [...] "policy {{would have been to}} hold the fort until another election could be held." [...] Her husband disagreed, and when Congress settled the election in favor of Hayes, Julia prepared to leave the White House.|$|E
60|$|It was a {{critical}} time in Grace's emotional life that night. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>her</b> husband a good deal, and for the nonce forgot Winterborne.|$|R
6000|$|But then <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>her</b> mother's rare tears glistening in her eyes, and the answer, 'Poor Alfred! I cannot {{give him}} up. Everything has been against him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>her</b> rent due on Saturday and the baby's keep, {{but did not}} say anything. They {{left the}} restaurant, and in the street Philip asked her: ...|$|R
2500|$|Sofonisba Anguissola's self portraits {{also offer}} {{evidence}} of what <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>her</b> place was as a woman artist. Normally, men were seen as creative actors and woman as passive objects, but in her self portrait of 1556, Anguissola presents herself as the artist, separating herself from the role as the object to be painted. Additional pieces show how she rebels against the notion that women are objects, in essence an instrument to be played by men. Her self portrait of 1561 show her playing an instrument, taking on a different role.|$|E
2500|$|Former President Johnson died {{four years}} after leaving office, {{of a heart attack}} in 1973. When he {{suffered}} the heart attack, Lady Bird was in a meeting, and the former president had died when she reached him. She arranged for the body to lie in state at the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library and Museum the following day, and the body was laid to rest two days later. The couple's elder daughter Lynda said that God [...] "knew what he was doing" [...] when her father died ahead of her mother; <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>her</b> father would not have been able to live without Lady Bird.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{schooling}} was erratic: {{she attended}} seven different schools, for a cumulative total of just four years, ending {{when she was}} fifteen. [...] Her mother was not affectionate with her children. To keep them from getting hurt as she had been, she forbade her children to make strong friendships or read fiction. In her autobiography, The Living of Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Gilman wrote that her mother showed affection only when <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>her</b> young daughter was asleep. Although she lived a childhood of isolated, impoverished loneliness, she unknowingly prepared herself for the life that lay ahead by frequently visiting the public library and studying ancient civilizations on her own. Additionally, her father's love for literature influenced her, and years later he contacted her {{with a list of}} books he felt would be worthwhile for her to read.|$|E
60|$|And then <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> of {{that lost}} pearl. How {{could she do}} other than think of it? <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> of what <b>her</b> {{life would have been}} had she bravely {{committed}} herself to his hands, fearing nothing, trusting everything. She remembered his energy during those happy days in which he had looked forward to an early marriage. She remembered his tenderness of manner, the natural gallantry of his heart, the loving look of his bold eye; and then <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>her</b> husband.|$|R
60|$|Ada's wild spirit was--we {{dare not}} say eradicated, but--thoroughly subdued at last. When <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>her</b> father <b>she</b> laid {{her head on}} Glumm's broad chest and wept bitterly.|$|R
60|$|The {{mention of}} war-path and scalps {{had the effect}} of quieting the poor child's {{tendency}} to repartee. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>her</b> father and Little Tim, and became suddenly grave.|$|R
2500|$|Everyone is {{thoroughly}} {{confused by the}} two mysteries – who moved the body and who rang the police? While the police are searching the house and grounds, Miss Peake comes downstairs and tells Clarissa and her three guests that she {{is responsible for the}} body being moved in order that a charge couldn't be made against her as the primary evidence is missing. She wasn't in the hysterical state that she made out and, hearing how things were developing, the strong woman removed the body from the recess from the library side and hid it under the bolster of the bed she was [...] "recovering" [...] on. Pippa also comes downstairs, still drowsy over her sleeping pill and talking about seeing policemen in her room in her dreams. She also thinks that her sighting of Oliver was a dream and links this to the wax doll she produces – her [...] "recipe" [...] book was an ancient book on witchcraft and this explains why she confessed to killing Costello: <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>her</b> [...] "spells" [...] had done the deed.|$|E
2500|$|A {{month before}} the {{election}} the inspector general of the Ohio General Assembly announced he was investigating three legislators for accepting gifts and failing to report them. Schmidt was implicated in this, but could not be investigated because {{she was no longer}} a member of the Ohio house. (The others were Representatives Jim Raussen of Springdale, Michelle G. Schneider of Madeira, and Diana M. Fessler of New Carlisle.) On October 24, 2004, the legislators had accepted dinner at Nicola's Ristorante on Sycamore Street in Cincinnati's Over-the-Rhine neighborhood and Cincinnati Bengals tickets from a lobbyist for pharmaceutical company Chiron. Schmidt said <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>her</b> $644 gift was from former Bengals player Boomer Esiason, who was, like Chiron, interested in cystic fibrosis. Schmidt repaid the lobbyist for the cost of the entertainment. Her spokesman told The Columbus Dispatch [...] "Jean specifically asked if this was a reportable gift. We immediately corrected it by paying the full price of the tickets." [...] Her former colleague Raussen blamed the lobbyist. [...] "Here we have a lobbyist who was extremely sloppy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jo Ann Compton's {{daughter}} Laurie Ann {{was stabbed}} to death in 1988—and a decade later, the mom was tangled in her grief. [...] "I hope they're in the same hell I'm in," [...] she said of her daughter's murderers on a 1998 show. Oprah brought in Dr. Phil to help Jo Ann. He asked her if <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>her</b> daughter would {{want her to be}} in so much pain—and Compton said no. [...] "Maybe the betrayal is focusing on the day of her death, rather than celebrating the event of her life," [...] Phil continued. [...] "She lived for 18 vibrant years, and you focus on the day she died." [...] After a moment, Compton uttered her breakthrough sentence: [...] "I never thought of it that way." [...] Later, she sobbed while revealing that she had been planning to end her life after the show. When Compton returned to the show in 2011, she had a new viewpoint on the daughter she lost: [...] "She continues to stay alive every time I do something positive." [...] Compton's surviving daughter, Cindy, said [...] "She went from existing to living. It was an amazing transformation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "About my dinner-party to-morrow. Oh," [...] {{said the}} child, {{clasping}} her hands earnestly as <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>her</b> playfellows, [...] "I do so {{hope it will}} go off well!" ...|$|R
