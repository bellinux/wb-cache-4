500|$|... "Human Nature" [...] also {{received}} nine official remixes clocking {{a total of}} 53 minutes and 26 seconds. Most of the remixes turned the R sounding song into a house one. The radio edit omitted the line [...] ""I'm not your bitch/Don't hang your <b>shit</b> <b>on</b> me" [...] but AllMusic's Jose F. Promis felt that the removal made the version repetitive and made it [...] "lack the punchline". The [...] "Runway Club Mix" [...] is stripped down while the [...] "I'm Not Your Bitch Mix" [...] replaced the verse and the chorus with whispered comments like [...] "I have no regrets", [...] "I'm not your bitch", [...] "Deal with it" [...] and [...] "I'm HIV negative" [...] which are added over a much deeper house groove. The hip hop mixes include one clean and one adult rated version.

500|$|The album's fourth track, [...] "Don't Stop", is {{characterized}} by a pulsating bass overlaid with strings punctuating and accompanying the riffs in sustained and glissandi gestures. The rhetoric of the track is displayed by Madonna's commands: [...] "Don't stop doin' what you're doin' baby, Don't stop, keep movin' keep groovin'". The next track [...] "Inside of Me" [...] starts with the same tempo as [...] "Don't Stop", with guitars, sustained strings, [...] "throbbing" [...] bass and jazz-y keyboards, with Madonna singing in a breathy vocal register. The singing conjures an erotic imagery as she sings on the chorus, [...] "Even though you're gone, love still carries on", however the lyrics were interpreted as both about her deceased mother, or a long-lost lover. The strings and an occasional saxophone sample makes [...] "Inside of Me" [...] a direct continuation of [...] "Erotica", with an interval where the drums drop off, exposing Madonna's vocals. On the sixth track, [...] "Human Nature", Madonna confronts chauvinism as she sings, [...] "And I'm not sorry, I'm not your bitch, don't hang your <b>shit</b> <b>on</b> me", while telling herself in whispered tones to [...] "express yourself, don't repress yourself". Consisting of heavy bass and looping drum sounds in its four chord sequence, the song finds Madonna delivering a nasal tone reminiscent of 90s soul style. Together with [...] "Survival", the song became a vehicle for Madonna to lyrically vent off her frustrations regarding the controversies surrounding her.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{performed}} the song again on her 2008–09 Sticky & Sweet Tour, while playing an electric guitar and adding vocoder voice {{effects on the}} background harmonies. The singer {{was dressed in a}} black leotard and fishnet tights. She also wore a white hat and black leather boots. During the performance a video backdrop portrayed American singer Britney Spears trapped in an elevator and trying to get out, while kicking the walls. At the end of the performance, the doors opened to reveal Spears saying the phrase [...] "It's Britney, bitch", from her song [...] "Gimme More" [...] (2007). Madonna explained that she intended the video to stand as an analogy of Spears' career, saying [...] "Didn't that explain what I thought? 'I'm not your bitch, don't hang your <b>shit</b> <b>on</b> me". On November 6, 2008 in the Los Angeles show at Dodger Stadium, Spears joined Madonna onstage halfway through the performance. Aidin Vaziri from Gibson.com was positive in his review, saying that the best moment of the tour was when Madonna picked up her black Les Paul guitar and emulated musician Slash while performing the song. Paul Schrodt from Slant Magazine was negative in his review of the performance, saying that by the time the performance of [...] "Human Nature" [...] had started, [...] "it's the same as all her shows: A remixed mind-fuck". The performance was included on the Sticky & Sweet Tour live CD and DVD release, recorded during Madonna's four shows in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in December 2008.|$|E
500|$|... "Human Nature" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Madonna and Hall. The song was recorded and mixed by Frederick Jorio and P. Dennis Mitchell with Robert Kiss {{working as an}} assistant engineer during the sessions and Joey Moskowitz doing the programming. Musically, [...] "Human Nature" [...] is a R song with a hip-hop influenced beat. It also includes a looping sample from the song [...] "What You Need" [...] performed by hip-hop group Main Source along {{with the sound of}} slamming doors, therefore its writers Shawn McKenzie, Kevin McKenzie and Milo Deering are also credited. [...] "Human Nature" [...] begins in a trip hop style with the sound of bass and drums and Madonna whispering [...] "express yourself, don't repress yourself". Throughout the song, the music continues looping around the same chord sequence and Madonna utters whispered phrases to counterpoint the actual lyrics. Her vocals utilized the 1990s soul style of music with a nasal, thin sound. The chorus ends with the line [...] "I'm not your bitch, Don't hang your <b>shit</b> <b>on</b> me" [...] which was often censored by the radio stations from airplay. Unlike the other tracks on the album, [...] "Human Nature" [...] does not employ the pentatonic melody and is devoid of the melancholy nature of Bedtime Stories, as observed by Jon Pareles of The New York Times. Composed in the time signature of common time, [...] "Human Nature" [...] has a key of C major while progressing in 88 beats per minute. Madonna's [...] "nasal" [...] vocals range from F3 to E7 and the song follows a repetitive sequence of Fmaj7–E7–Am7–Fmaj7–E7–Am7 as its chord progression.|$|E
