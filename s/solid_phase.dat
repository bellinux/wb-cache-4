5|$|In the past, {{oligonucleotide}} synthesis {{was carried}} out manually in solution or on <b>solid</b> <b>phase.</b> The <b>solid</b> <b>phase</b> synthesis was implemented using, as containers for the <b>solid</b> <b>phase,</b> miniature glass columns similar in their shape to low-pressure chromatography columns or syringes equipped with porous filters.|$|E
5|$|Oligonucleotides remain {{permanently}} {{attached to}} the <b>solid</b> <b>phase,</b> which {{requires the use of}} linkers that are stable under the conditions of the final deprotection procedure.|$|E
5|$|Along with manual exercises, several {{prominent}} automation companies attended the course. Biosearch of Novato, CA, Genetic Design of Watertown, MA, {{were two of}} several companies to demonstrate automated synthesizers at the course. Biosearch presented their new SAM I synthesizer. The Genetic Design had developed their synthesizer from the design of its sister companies (Sequemat) <b>solid</b> <b>phase</b> peptide sequencer. The Genetic Design arranged with Dr Christian Birr (Max-Planck-Institute for Medical Research) {{a week before the}} event to convert his <b>solid</b> <b>phase</b> sequencer into the semi-automated synthesizer. The team led by Dr Alex Bonner and Rick Neves converted the unit and transported it to Darmstadt for the event and installed into the Biochemistry lab at the Technische Hochschule. As the system was semi-automatic, the user injected the next base {{to be added to the}} growing sequence during each cycle. The system worked well and produced a series of test tubes filled with bright red trityl color indicating complete coupling at each step. This system was later fully automated by inclusion of an auto injector and was designated the Model 25A.|$|E

5|$|At a given {{temperature}} a {{lipid bilayer}} can exist in either a liquid or a gel (<b>solid)</b> <b>phase.</b> All lipids have a characteristic temperature at which they transition (melt) from the gel to liquid phase. In both phases the lipid molecules are prevented from flip-flopping across the bilayer, but in liquid phase bilayers a given lipid will exchange locations with its neighbor millions of times a second. This random walk exchange allows lipid to diffuse and thus wander {{across the surface of}} the membrane. Unlike liquid phase bilayers, the lipids in a gel phase bilayer have less mobility.|$|E
5|$|In halides, {{berkelium}} {{assumes the}} oxidation states +3 and +4. The +3 state is most stable, especially in solutions, and the tetravalent halides BkF4 and Cs2BkCl6 are only {{known in the}} <b>solid</b> <b>phase.</b> The coordination of the berkelium atom in its trivalent fluoride and chloride is tricapped trigonal prismatic, with a coordination number of 9. In the trivalent bromide, it is bicapped trigonal prismatic (coordination 8) or octahedral (coordination 6), and in the iodide it is octahedral.|$|E
5|$|Although {{white dwarf}} {{material}} is initially plasma—a fluid composed of nuclei and electrons—it was theoretically predicted in the 1960s {{that at a}} late stage of cooling, it should crystallize, starting at its center. The crystal structure {{is thought to be}} a body-centered cubic lattice. In 1995 it was suggested that asteroseismological observations of pulsating white dwarfs yielded a potential test of the crystallization theory, and in 2004, observations were made that suggested approximately 90% of the mass of BPM 37093 had crystallized. Other work gives a crystallized mass fraction of between 32% and 82%. As a white dwarf core undergoes crystallization into a <b>solid</b> <b>phase,</b> latent heat is released which provides a source of thermal energy that delays its cooling.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, {{substantially}} more reactive P(III) derivatives of nucleosides, 3'-O-chlorophosphites, were successfully {{used for the}} formation of internucleosidic linkages. This led to the discovery of the phosphite triester methodology. The group led by M. Caruthers took the advantage of less aggressive and more selective 1H-tetrazolidophosphites and implemented the method on <b>solid</b> <b>phase.</b> Very shortly after, the workers from the same group further improved the method by using more stable nucleoside phosphoramidites as building blocks. The use of 2-cyanoethyl phosphite-protecting group in place of a less user-friendly methyl group led to the nucleoside phosphoramidites currently used in oligonucleotide synthesis (see Phosphoramidite building blocks below). Many later improvements to the manufacturing of building blocks, oligonucleotide synthesizers, and synthetic protocols made the phosphoramidite chemistry a very reliable and expedient method of choice for the preparation of synthetic oligonucleotides.|$|E
5|$|To {{obtain the}} desired oligonucleotide, the {{building}} blocks are sequentially coupled to the growing oligonucleotide chain in the order required by the sequence of the product (see Synthetic cycle below). The process has been fully automated since the late 1970s. Upon {{the completion of the}} chain assembly, the product is released from the <b>solid</b> <b>phase</b> to solution, deprotected, and collected. The occurrence of side reactions sets practical limits for the length of synthetic oligonucleotides (up to about 200 nucleotide residues) because the number of errors accumulates with the length of the oligonucleotide being synthesized. Products are often isolated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to obtain the desired oligonucleotides in high purity. Typically, synthetic oligonucleotides are single-stranded DNA or RNA molecules around 15–25 bases in length.|$|E
25|$|The {{sol-gel process}} is a wet-chemical {{technique}} used for the fabrication of both glassy and ceramic materials. In this process, the sol (or solution) evolves gradually towards {{the formation of a}} gel-like network containing both a liquid phase and a <b>solid</b> <b>phase.</b> Typical precursors are metal alkoxides and metal chlorides, which undergo hydrolysis and polycondensation reactions to form a colloid. The basic structure or morphology of the <b>solid</b> <b>phase</b> can range anywhere from discrete colloidal particles to continuous chain-like polymer networks.|$|E

The experimental device used in this work allowed the distinction between stable and metastable <b>solid</b> <b>phases.</b> The influences of the alkyl chain length and pressure on the melting {{temperatures of}} the stable <b>solid</b> <b>phases</b> are discussed...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the behavior of electronic phases of the second Landau level under tilted magnetic fields. The fractional quantum Hall liquids at ν= 2 + 1 / 5 and 2 + 4 / 5 and the <b>solid</b> <b>phases</b> at ν= 2. 30, 2. 44, 2. 57, and 2. 70 are quickly destroyed with tilt. This behavior {{can be interpreted as}} a tilt driven localization of the 2 + 1 / 5 and 2 + 4 / 5 fractional quantum Hall liquids and a delocalization through melting of <b>solid</b> <b>phases</b> in the top Landau level, respectively. The evolution towards the classical Hall gas of the <b>solid</b> <b>phases</b> is suggestive of antiferromagnetic ordering...|$|R

25|$|Such data is {{critical}} in determining the effect of alloy constituents in a bulk material, identification of solid-state reaction features, such as <b>solid</b> <b>phase</b> precipitates. Such information may not be amenable to analysis by other means (e.g. TEM) owing to the difficulty in generating a three-dimensional dataset with composition.|$|E
25|$|PVC {{produces}} HCl upon combustion almost quantitatively {{related to}} its chlorine content. Extensive studies in Europe indicate that the chlorine found in emitted dioxins is not derived from HCl in the flue gases. Instead, most dioxins arise in the condensed <b>solid</b> <b>phase</b> by the reaction of inorganic chlorides with graphitic structures in char-containing ash particles. Copper acts {{as a catalyst for}} these reactions.|$|E
25|$|The most {{familiar}} examples of <b>phases</b> are <b>solids,</b> liquids, and gases. Many substances exhibit multiple <b>solid</b> <b>phases.</b> For example, {{there are three}} <b>phases</b> of <b>solid</b> iron (alpha, gamma, and delta) that vary based on temperature and pressure. A principal difference between <b>solid</b> <b>phases</b> is the crystal structure, or arrangement, of the atoms.

25|$|In static methods {{a mixture}} {{is brought to}} {{equilibrium}} and the concentration of a species in the solution phase is determined by chemical analysis.

25|$|If {{the water}} layer is thick enough, water {{at its base}} will be in <b>solid</b> <b>phase</b> (ice polymorphs) {{because of the high}} pressure.
