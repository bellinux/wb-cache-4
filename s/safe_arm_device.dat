We present a framework that relates the different activities and products from system engineering, safety engineering, system and software requirements, and software architecture explicitly, and demonstrate the proposed framework with a case study involving the architectural design of the software to control the arming device of a fictitious Surface-to-Air Missile. We describe the safety engineering steps for {{the identification of the}} system hazards and the critical functions that the software has to provide to avoid premature detonation, resulting in four safety requirements for the software that controls the missiles Electronic <b>Safe</b> <b>Arm</b> <b>Device</b> (ESAD). We formalize the software safety requirements as statechart assertions and validate their correctness via JUnit test. We develop a software architecture for the control software using the Safety Executive pattern, and implement the design in C++ to support a simple time-step simulation to produce the required log files for the automated verification of the design.

50|$|The NSDs {{provide the}} spark to ignite the CDF, {{which in turn}} ignites the LSC for booster destruction. The <b>safe</b> and <b>arm</b> <b>device</b> {{provides}} mechanical isolation between the NSDs and the CDF before launch and during the SRB separation sequence.|$|R
5000|$|In July 2012, Raytheon {{claimed the}} STM could be [...] "months" [...] away from fielding. In early August 2012, Raytheon renamed the munition Pyros and {{completed}} the first end-to-end {{test of the}} bomb. The test validated the weapon's guidance modes, height-of-burst sensor, electronic <b>safe</b> and <b>arm</b> <b>device,</b> and multi-effects warhead.|$|R
50|$|The M86 mine {{is similar}} in {{configuration}} and possesses functioning characteristics of the ADAM mine presently loaded in the 155mm projectile, M731 (and M692). The mine is wedge shaped, and contains a safety clip, arming strap assembly, internal <b>safing</b> and <b>arming</b> <b>device,</b> seven tripline sensor, a reserve battery, electronic circuitry containing an IC chip, and a kill mechanism surrounded by an overlay containing a liquid propellant, and encapsulated in a molded plastic form.|$|R
50|$|Next is {{a target}} {{detector}} with four IR emitters and detectors that detect whether {{the target is}} moving farther away. When it detects this action taking place, it sends {{a signal to the}} warhead <b>safe</b> and <b>arm</b> <b>device</b> to detonate the warhead. Versions older than the AIM-9L featured an influence fuze that relied on the target's magnetic field as input. Current trends in shielded wires and non-magnetic metals in aircraft construction rendered this obsolete.|$|R
50|$|The fire 2 {{commands}} {{cause the}} redundant NSDs to fire through a thin barrier seal down a flame tunnel. This ignites a pyro booster charge, which is {{retained in the}} <b>safe</b> and <b>arm</b> <b>device</b> behind a perforated plate. The booster charge ignites the propellant in the igniter initiator; and combustion products of this propellant ignite the solid rocket motor initiator, which fires down the entire vertical length of the solid rocket motor igniting the solid rocket motor propellant along its entire surface area instantaneously.|$|R
40|$|The Space Shuttle Redesigned Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM) {{static test}} of Qualification Motor (QM- 6) was {{conducted}} 20 April 1988 at Morton Thiokol, Inc., Space Operations.

50|$|In July 2014, Thales {{unveiled}} {{a modification of}} the LMM that turns it into a glide bomb, called the FreeFall LMM (FFLMM). Thales partnered with Textron to market it as the Fury for the U.S. market, who provides a height-of-burst sensor and electronic <b>safe</b> and <b>arm</b> <b>device.</b> The weapon had been in development for 18 months and undergone initial test drops in August 2013. In comparison to the LMM, the FFLMM removes the rocket motor and associated components while keeping the body and control actuators, as well as adding INS and GPS navigation, semi-active laser guidance {{in place of the}} beam-riding system, and four enlarged fins for increased lift.|$|R
50|$|The {{solid rocket}} motor {{ignition}} commands are {{sent by the}} orbiter computers through the Master Events Controllers (MECs) to the <b>safe</b> and <b>arm</b> <b>device</b> NASA standard detonators ("NSD"s) in each SRB. A PIC single-channel capacitor discharge device controls the firing of each pyrotechnic device. Three signals must be present simultaneously for the PIC to generate the pyro firing output. These signals — arm, fire 1 and fire 2 — originate in the orbiter general-purpose computers (GPCs) and are transmitted to the MECs. The MECs reformat them to 28 volt DC signals for the PICs. The arm signal charges the PIC capacitor to 40 volts DC (minimum of 20 volts DC).|$|R
50|$|Hughes had {{assembled}} a team including Aérospatiale (propulsion), Shorts (integration and final assembly), Thomson-Thorn Missile Electronics (TTME), Fokker Special Projects (fin actuation), and Diehl BGT Defence (warhead). Incidentally, {{the adoption of}} FMRAAM as the name of Hughes' proposal forced the UK MoD to change the title of SR(A)1239 to BVRAAM. Hughes would provide the seeker, with electronics from its Scottish subsidiary, based in Glenrothes. The upgraded guidance electronics would be compressed compared to the existing AMRAAM. Other changes included: a new electronic, {{as opposed to the}} usual mechanical, <b>safe</b> and <b>arm</b> <b>device,</b> based on Diehl BGT Defence's IRIS-T system; a TTME digital target detection device (a two-way conformal microwave proximity fuze unit); and a shortened control and actuation system. The seeker and warhead were basically unchanged from AMRAAM's.|$|R
40|$|An {{assessment}} of quantitative methods and measures for measuring launch commit criteria (LCC) performance measurement trends is made.

40|$|A laser {{initiated}} ordnance controller apparatus {{which provides}} a <b>safe</b> and <b>arm</b> scheme with no moving parts. The <b>safe</b> and <b>arm</b> apparatus provides isolation of firing energy to explosive devices {{using a combination of}} polarization isolation and control through acousto-optical deviation of laser energy pulses. The apparatus provides constant monitoring of the systems status and performs 100 % built-in-test at any time prior to ordnance ignition without the risk of premature ignition or detonation. The apparatus has a computer controller, a solid state laser, an acousto-optic deflector and RF drive circuitry, built-in-test optics and electronics, and system monitoring capabilities. The optical system is completed from the laser beam power source to the pyrotechnic ordnance through fiber optic cabling, optical splitters and optical connectors. During operation of the apparatus, a command is provided by the computer controller and, simultaneous with laser flashlamp fire, the <b>safe</b> and <b>arm</b> <b>device</b> is opened for approximately 200 microseconds which allows the laser pulse to transmit through the <b>device.</b> The <b>arm</b> signal also energizes the laser power supply and activated the acousto-optical deflector.

5000|$|Design and {{development}} originated when Los Alamos National Laboratory proposed that a bomb design using lithium deuteride with non-enriched lithium was possible. The new design was designated TX-17 on February 24, 1953. The TX-17 and 24 were tested as the [...] "Runt" [...] (Castle Romeo shot) device during Operation Castle in 1954. After the successful tests, basic {{versions of the}} Mk 17 and 24 were deployed {{as part of the}} [...] "Emergency Capability" [...] program. A total of five EC 17 and ten EC 24 bombs were rushed into stockpile between April and October 1954. The EC weapons lacked parachutes to delay the time between release and their detonation, ensuring the delivery aircraft would be destroyed with the target. Other safety features such as In Flight Insertion (IFI) and <b>safe</b> <b>arming</b> and fusing <b>devices</b> were also omitted to ensure a quick thermonuclear capability.|$|R
5000|$|The {{guidance}} and control unit (GCU) contains {{most of the}} electronics and mechanics that enable the missile to function. At the very front is the IR seeker head utilizing the rotating reticle, mirror, and five CdS cells or [...] "pan and scan" [...] staring array (AIM-9X), electric motor, and armature, all protruding into a glass dome. Directly behind this are the electronics that gather data, interpret signals, and generate the control signals that steer the missile. An umbilical {{on the side of}} the GCU attaches to the launcher, which detaches from the missile at launch. To cool the seeker head, a 5,000 psi (35 MPa) argon bottle (TMU-72/B or A/B) is carried internally in Air Force AIM-9L/M variants, while the Navy uses a rail-mounted nitrogen bottle. The AIM-9X model contains a Stirling cryo-engine to cool the seeker elements. Two electric servos power the canards to steer the missile (except AIM-9X). At the back of the GCU is a gas grain generator or thermal battery (AIM-9X) to provide electrical power. The AIM-9X features high off-boresight capability; together with JHMCS (Joint Helmet-Mounted Cueing System), this missile is capable of locking on to a target that is in its field of regard said to be up to 90 degrees off boresight. The AIM-9X has several unique design features including built-in test to aid in maintenance and reliability, an electronic <b>safe</b> and <b>arm</b> <b>device,</b> an additional digital umbilical similar to the AMRAAM and jet vane control.|$|R
5000|$|The AIM-9X Sidewinder, {{developed}} by Raytheon engineers, entered service in November 2003 with the USAF (lead platform is the F-15C; the USN lead platform is the F/A-18C) {{and is a}} substantial upgrade to the Sidewinder family featuring an imaging infrared focal-plane array (FPA) seeker with claimed 90° off-boresight capability, compatibility with helmet-mounted displays {{such as the new}} U.S. Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System, and a totally new three-dimensional thrust-vectoring control (TVC) system providing increased turn capability over traditional control surfaces. Utilizing the JHMCS, a pilot can point the AIM-9X missile's seeker and [...] "lock on" [...] by simply looking at a target, thereby increasing air combat effectiveness. It retains the same rocket motor, fuze and warhead of the 9-"Mike", but its lower drag gives it improved range and speed. AIM-9X also includes an internal cooling system, eliminating the need for use of launch-rail nitrogen bottles (U.S. Navy and Marines) or internal argon bottle (USAF). It also features an electronic <b>safe</b> and <b>arm</b> <b>device</b> similar to the AMRAAM, allowing reduction in minimum range and reprogrammable InfraRed Counter Counter Measures (IRCCM) capability that coupled with the FPA provide improved look down into clutter and performance against the latest IRCM. Though not part of the original requirement, AIM-9X demonstrated potential for a Lock-on After Launch capability, allowing for possible internal use for the F-35, F-22 Raptor and even in a submarine-launched configuration for use against ASW platforms. The AIM-9X has been tested for a surface attack capability, with mixed results.|$|R

40|$|All {{inspection}} and instrumentation {{data indicate that}} the QM- 8 static test firing conducted 20 January 1989 was successful. Ambient temperature at T- 0 was 28 F. With two flights successfully accomplished, this final test in the redesigned solid rocket motor (RSRM) program certified that the design meets motor performance requirements under extreme cold conditions. This test was a prerequisite to the third flight. The entire test article was cold conditioned at 20 to 25 F for approximately 31 days to assure a maximum propellant mean bulk temperature (PMBT) of 40 F, making it the lowest PMBT {{in the history of}} the program. This extreme condition also presented the opportunity to certify critical components at low temperatures. Certification of field joint and igniter heaters, adhesive bondline integrity, flex bearing performance, flight instrumentation performance, RSRM seal performance, and LSC and nozzle plug performance was accomplished. Prior to motor ignition, the field joints were maintained between 75 to 130 F, the igniter-to-case joint was maintained between 75 to 123 F, and the case-to-nozzle joint was maintained between 75 to 120 F. QM- 8 was tested with induced side loads to simulate the strut loads experienced during ignition and maximum aerodynamic loading conditions. The ability of the <b>safe</b> and <b>arm</b> <b>device</b> to change position from safe-to-arm and arm-to-safe was certified. Ballistics performance was certified at the lower limits. Values were within specification requirements. Nozzle performance was nominal with typical erosion. The use of Fiberite carbon-cloth phenolic was certified.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{design and}} control of a <b>safe</b> <b>arm</b> with passive {{compliant}} joints(PCJ) are presented. A new manipulator with passive compliance property has been developed at KIST. Strategy for the joint control method is implemented. Because the PCJ is a flexible joint, unwanted vibration is occurred during the joint motion. To reduce this vibration, we use the input-preshaping method which is motivated by the input shaping technique(IST) based on impulse response. The control method for a time-varying system like the <b>safe</b> <b>arm</b> is described in detail. The result of simulations and experiments proves that a fast motion of the <b>safe</b> <b>arm</b> without residual vibration can be achieved...|$|R

That is, using one type of structure named contact pairs to achieve stiffness change during the micro-spring’s stretching process. Using contact pairs, three types of variable stiffness springs are designed: stiffness increase spring, stiffness decrease spring and stiffness hump spring. Finally, the variable stiffness springs’ application for fuze setback <b>arming</b> <b>device</b> is discussed. When {{the three types of}} springs are used in setback <b>arming</b> <b>device,</b> the stiffness decrease spring is better than the other two springs from security analysis. Kinematic analysis shows that, if the variable stiffness spring’s design is reasonable, the setback <b>arming</b> <b>device</b> not only can effectively solve the safety and reliability issues for rocket fuze, but also applies in small caliber grenade fuze’s working environment without changing the setback <b>arming</b> <b>device’s</b> size and structure.
