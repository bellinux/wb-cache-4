Mesh selectivity and discarding practice, in terms of proportions of the catch discarded and landed, are described using a logistic fit to the proportions of the population entering the net that are caught, discarded and landed. The application of the model is illustrated using data from the mixed demersal fisheries in the Irish Sea, and the effects of including discards in the assessments and on yield-per-recruit are examined. Including discard estimates in the assessment results in increased estimates of stock numbers and increased fishing mortality on age groups that were subject to discarding.

40|$|Abstract—This paper derives a new {{infinite}} series representa-tion for the trivariate Non-central {{chi-squared distribution}} when the underlying correlated Gaussian variables have a tridiagonal {{form of an}} inverse covariance matrix. The {{joint probability density function}} is derived using Miller’s approach and Dougall’s identity. Moreover, the trivariate cumulative distribution function (cdf) and characteristic function (chf) are also derived. Finally, the bivariate non-central chi-squared distribution and some known forms are shown to be special cases of the more general distribution. However, the derivation of non-central chi-squared distribution for an arbitrary covariance matrix seems intractable via Miller’s approach. Two applications of the newly derived results are provided for performance analysis of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems with transmit antenna selection over a correlated Rician fading environment. Some numerical results are also presented to verify the accuracy of the analytical expressions.

Limits and Selection Effects A basic goal of galaxy research is to identify and characterize the galaxy populations which inhabit the universe.

In order to transform from the observed, apparent distributions of galaxy properties and recover the desired intrinsic distributions, one must understand and correct for the <b>selection</b> <b>characteristics</b> of galaxy surveys. An essential fact about galaxies, as they appear on survey plates, is that they are not point sources.

In the current study, I investigated the relationship between acculturation and mate selection preferences among Asian-Indians in the United States. The hypothesis was that respondents who spent their childhood in India would demonstrate Eastern mate selection preferences regardless of degree of acculturation, whereas for respondents who spent their childhood in the United States, acculturation would be predictive of mate selection preferences. Results revealed that generation and acculturation were too highly related to consider them as independent constructs. Therefore, the original hypotheses could not be tested.

We determined nest site <b>selection</b> <b>characteristics</b> (n= 80) and examined spatial patterns (n= 215) of snowy plover nests in saline lakes in the Southern High Plains (SHP) of Texas.

High use areas were generally located in areas with pebble substrate and on human-made or natural islands, berms, and peninsulas. Overall, nests placed on pebble substrate had lower temperatures during the day than nests placed on sand substrates. Nest placement on pebble substratemay be valuable to nesting snowy plovers, providing thermal advantages to incubating adults and depressing potentially high nest predation rates. Management guidelines for this region should emphasize the importance of addressing key elements of snowy plover nesting habitat including the presence of pebble substrate and reducing vegetation encroachment...|$|E

The accounting concepts have in common a concern with 'population thinking' and are essential elements in the study of economic development interpreted as the transformation of initial populations of activities into new kinds of populations. Development can be uncovered at many levels in an economic system, for example in the competitive process at the level of industries, sectors and markets.

In addition, sociodemographic background information was gathered from the Netherlands Internal Revenue Service and Municipal Personal Records Office. Trajectory analysis was conducted to approximate the underlying continuous distribution in criminal development by a discrete number of groups. Results:The criminal career characteristics and sociodemographic profile show a heterogeneous sample of white-collar offenders. Trajectory analysis distinguished four trajectory groups.
