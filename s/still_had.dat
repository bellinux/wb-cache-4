5|$|After leaving City, Trautmann played, for a month, for Wellington Town, {{who offered}} him Â£50 per match, signing in September 1964 to replace an injured regular keeper.

However, he was sent off at Tonbridge for violent conduct in his second match, and never played again. For Wellington, he had saved two matches and been on losing side in five.|$|E

Washington <b>still</b> <b>had</b> hopes of reopening a dialog with Sihanouk, and refrained from any actions that might alienate him further.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the war was}} {{entering}} its final stages, the squadron <b>still</b> <b>had</b> to watch for anti-aircraft artillery.

Baltimore eventually acquired Gambino, and to do so, they traded their first-round 1948 draft selection to the Cleveland Browns, who held Gambino's AAFC draft rights.|$|E
