5|$|Due {{to their}} {{frequent}} relocation, Kaif and her siblings were home-schooled {{by a series}} of tutors. Although she is thought to have grown up in London, she lived there for only three years before moving to India. According to Kaif, she then changed her surname to her father's because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> {{it would be easier to}} pronounce.|$|E
5|$|Gillian Jacobs as Britta Perry – Britta {{dropped out}} of high school because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> it would impress Radiohead. She then joined a group of anarchists who vandalized billboards. She has been in the Peace Corps, and done foot {{modeling}} before she enrolled at Greendale. She is strongly concerned with honesty, and does not take lightly to anyone lying to her.|$|E
5|$|Her son was {{diagnosed}} with autism {{at the age of}} three. As Phua consulted professionals and did research on how to help him, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> about how she could help other autistic children. She subsequently founded WeCAN, a charity which helps caregivers of autistic people and offers early intervention programmes for autistic preschoolers.|$|E

5|$|In casting, Nancy Cartwright {{originally}} planned {{to audition for}} the role of Lisa, while Yeardley Smith tried out for Bart. Smith's voice was too high for a boy, so she was given the role of Lisa. Cartwright found that Lisa was not interesting at the time, so instead auditioned for Bart, which <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> was a better role.|$|E
5|$|A pop ballad, {{the song}} {{includes}} instrumentation from guitars, keyboards, drums and a synthesizer, and its lyrics deal with deceit, mistrust and childhood scars. It {{is also about}} being strong, which Madonna recalled {{in an interview that}} <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> about her relationship with her parents, while writing the lyrics. The music video, directed by James Foley, shows Madonna's first image makeover, featuring her with a cleaner look, shoulder-length wavy golden blond hair, conservative wardrobe and subtle make-up. This toned down blond appearance was again inspired by Marilyn Monroe.|$|E
5|$|Amanita australis is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Amanitaceae. It is found only in New Zealand, where it occurs in Leptospermum and Nothofagus forest. The species was first {{described}} by New Zealand mycologist Greta Stevenson in 1962; in the same publication Stevenson also described what <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> was a unique species, Limacella macrospora, but over 30 years later this was reduced to synonymy with A.australis.|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Pierston {{reaffirmed the}} fact, {{adding that the}} girl often slept at home because she, her mother, was so lonely. <b>She</b> often <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> would like to keep her {{daughter}} at home altogether.|$|R
60|$|And Mary {{obtained}} a dreamy soothed submission, so that <b>she</b> almost <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was brushing her victim {{to sleep in}} her chair, before the maid {{came up with the}} viands that Dr. May had ordered.|$|R
5|$|By March 1905, Potter {{was anxious}} to begin work on the tale. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> the 1903 version too thin and rewrote the entire story, {{retaining}} Ribby the cat and Duchess the dog as the central characters while elaborating the setting and developing a stronger plot line. It was decided the tale would be published in a format slightly larger than her previous productions with ten full-colour illustrations and other illustrations in pen and sepia ink.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, Elizabeth Johnson {{discovered}} {{the remains of}} a Pawnee village in Republic County, Kansas. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> that it might be the site of Pike's flag incident; but hearing of another village in Webster County, Nebraska, she dispatched her husband and another man to investigate this site. Because the surface had been altered by cultivation, they found little evidence of habitation, and Johnson was persuaded that the Republic County site was Pike's village. She prevented its being plowed on several occasions, and eventually purchased the land.|$|E
5|$|Jinnah was {{the central}} figure of the 1998 film Jinnah, {{which was based on}} Jinnah's life and his {{struggle}} for the creation of Pakistan. Christopher Lee, who portrayed Jinnah, called his performance the best of his career. The 1954 Hector Bolitho's book Jinnah: Creator of Pakistan prompted Fatima Jinnah to release a book, titled My Brother (1987), as <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that Bolitho's book had failed to express the political aspects of Jinnah. The book received positive reception in Pakistan. Jinnah of Pakistan (1984) by Stanley Wolpert is {{regarded as one of the}} best biographical books on Jinnah.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} Miss Trotter was herself again. <b>She</b> reasoned, or <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> did, {{that this was}} a {{question}} of the business of the hotel, and it was clearly her duty to assent to Chris's coming. The strange yet pleasurable timidity which possessed her at the <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> ignored completely.|$|R
50|$|Arnold has a daughter, Alijah Kai Haggins (born March 16, 2004), {{with music}} {{producer}} Carvin Haggins. In {{an interview with}} Joan Rivers, Arnold revealed that <b>she</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was unable to conceive after bouts with endometriosis.|$|R
60|$|Laura {{gave him}} a keen glance and got a jar. He frowned and his mouth was tight. <b>She</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> could move Jimmy, but now she doubted, and because she was proud she dared not try.|$|R
5|$|Koenig {{first became}} {{involved}} with writing a script for The Animated Series after he asked Susan Sackett, Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry's assistant, to type up some writing he was working on. After reading it through, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> it was good and passed it to Roddenberry, who agreed and asked Koenig if {{he was interested in}} writing for the animated show. He accepted the offer, and started working on a plot involving cloning which was inspired by newspaper articles about the subject, becoming the first actor from Star Trek to write for the franchise.|$|E
5|$|Sarah {{was famous}} for telling the Queen exactly what <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> and did not offer her flattery. Anne and Sarah had invented petnames for {{themselves}} during their youths which they continued to use after Anne became queen: Mrs Freeman (Sarah) and Mrs Morley (Anne). Effectively a business manager, Sarah had control over the Queen's position, from her finances to people admitted to the royal presence.|$|E
5|$|She {{moved to}} Los Angeles and quickly secured {{a role in}} Dawson's Creek. Williams said later that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> she knew all she needed to know since age15. She said in 2011 that she chose {{emancipation}} as she was influenced by other young actors doing it. In 1997, unhappy with the roles they were being offered, Williams and several actor friends wrote a script entitled Blink. It was sold, but nothing happened with it.|$|E
50|$|When Victoria proposes an unthinkable plan, Olivia {{is forced}} to accept, leaving her with a {{marriage}} <b>she</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> could have and her sister going off to help in France, when World War I is in full throttle.|$|R
50|$|In the Ultimate Universe, Jean Grey {{was placed}} in a mental {{institute}} after she began hearing voices and seeing visions of an omnipotent Phoenix God. After her release, <b>she</b> later <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> had contacted a celestial God-entity which destroyed worlds.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> {{read his}} <b>thoughts.</b> <b>She</b> {{knew very well}} what was in his mind, what was almost on his lips, and she {{struggled}} {{to be free of}} him.|$|R
5|$|Skaði also {{included}} in her terms of settlement that the gods must do something <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> {{impossible for them to}} do: make her laugh. To do so, Loki tied one end of a cord around the beard of a nanny goat and the other end around his testicles. The goat and Loki drew one another back and forth, both squealing loudly. Loki dropped into Skaði's lap, and Skaði laughed, completing this part of her atonement. Finally, in compensation to Skaði, Odin took Þjazi's eyes, plunged them into the sky, and from the eyes made two stars.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} shot through special lenses {{to make it}} more {{reminiscent}} of the decade. At Peter's funeral, actress Blair Brown wanted her character Nina Sharp to wear sunglasses, because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> Nina would not share her emotions at the funeral. Unlike Noble, Brown wore a wig. The scenes at Reiden Lake were actually shot on a parking lot, and the crew placed a covering over it to simulate the cracks normally on a lake.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Audrina rejects {{an invitation}} to Frankie's birthday party when she realizes that Kristin will be in attendance. Lo and Stephanie are shocked that Justin tells Kristin that he and Audrina were not officially a couple, but decide against confronting Kristin. Audrina is saddened after hearing of Justin's comments, and is worried that he and Kristin are seeing each other. During a later date with Justin, Kristin confesses that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> he still has feelings for Audrina, and understands that Audrina looks at her as a threat.|$|E
60|$|Maggie felt a {{great relief}} in {{adjourning}} the decision. She was free now {{to enjoy the}} minutes of companionship; <b>she</b> almost <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> might linger a little; {{the next time they}} met she should have to pain Philip by telling him her determination.|$|R
50|$|Riggen {{found her}} way into writing and {{producing}} film, though <b>she</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> would end up as a director, comparing the chances of landing {{a career as a}} director to the chances of landing a career as an astronaut - slim to none.|$|R

5|$|The {{premiere of}} The Bartered Bride {{took place at}} the Provisional Theatre on 30 May 1866. Smetana conducted; the stage designs were by Josef Macourek and Josef Jiři Kolár {{produced}} the opera. The role of Mařenka was sung by the theatre's principal soprano, Eleonora von Ehrenberg – who had refused to appear in The Brandenburgers because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> her proffered role was beneath her. The parts of Krušina, Jeník and Kecal were all taken by leading members of the Brandenburgers cast. A celebrated actor, Jindřich Mošna, was engaged to play the Ringmaster, a role which involves little singing skill.|$|E
5|$|Tracey Macleod ate at Pétrus for The Independent {{shortly after}} {{it opened in}} 1999. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> that certain touches would impress the Michelin inspectors, and that the dishes were {{suitably}} elaborate. Jay Rayner visited the restaurant whilst {{it was at the}} Bekerley Hotel in 2003 for The Observer. He thought that the menu was over complicated, and not all the elements of the dishes worked together. Gillian Glover of The Scotsman thought in 2005 that some of the food served was forgettable, but stand out elements included frog leg lolipops which came with her main course of baked seabass with garlic puree.|$|E
5|$|Alex Weldon {{was hired}} to be {{supervisor}} of special effects for the film. Weldon was planning on retiring after 42years of effects work, but his wife urged him to take on Star Trek because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> {{he did not have}} enough to do. When Weldon was hired, many of the effects had already been started or completed by Rugg; it was up to Weldon to complete more complex and higher-budgeted effects for the motion picture. The first step of preparation involved analyzing the script in the number, duration, and type of effects. Before costs could be determined and Weldon could shop for necessary items, he and {{the other members of the}} special effects team worked out all possibilities for pulling off the effects in a convincing manner.|$|E
