5000|$|New Paradigm Daleks are {{taller than}} {{previous}} variants, having a substantial fender reminiscent of Movie Daleks. The skirt section consists of raised panels with bevelled edges to which forty-eight hemispheres are fixed in twelve columns. The hemispheres are coloured grey {{with the exception}} of the Eternal Dalek, where they are black. The central rear skirt panel is enlarged to form a broad spine featuring a recessed horizontal louvre assembly. Published design drawings and commentary by concept artist Peter McKinstry indicates that this section is capable of opening to deploy alternative weapons which would traverse around the midsection to replace the standard armament, although this has not been portrayed on screen. The skirt is surmounted by a prominent, slatless <b>shoulder</b> <b>section,</b> divided by a horizontal groove and featuring integral appendage boxes. The neck is devoid of struts and consists of four flared rings detailed with small vertical slots, and is mounted towards the front of the Dalek giving the appearance of a prominent hump to the rear <b>shoulder</b> <b>section.</b> The dome, to which two cylindrical lights are fitted, is missing the chamfered lower section applied to previous variants. The gun is larger than that previously seen on the programme and is shown causing the complete disintegration of another Dalek.

40|$|According to the National Research Council (2006), {{the field}} of {{infrastructure}} development and rehabilitation is one of seven critical categories that require attention of geotechnical researchers and practitioners. Therefore, in this dissertation, two topics related to infrastructure development were selected and studies. These topics were performance of granular shoulders and nondestructive evaluation of low volume road bridge substructures. The first topic investigated common problems associated with granular shoulders, evaluation of several test sections stabilized with selected chemical and mechanical stabilization techniques, laboratory box model, where mechanically stabilized shoulders were tested under cyclic loading, and simple design charts that can help design stable <b>shoulder</b> <b>sections.</b> The second topic evaluates the effectiveness of using nondestructive ultrasonic stress wave tests to determine the internal timber piles conditions and correlate it to capacity of in-service piles. Also, {{the results of a}} destructive static load are presented. During this test, the timber piles at one abutment, instrumented with strain gages and load cells, were consecutively damaged to simulate different scenarios of pile deterioration.

40|$|The Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT) {{evaluated}} the PAS I Road Survey System from PAVEDEX, Inc. of Spokane, Washington. This system uses video photograph {{to identify and}} quantify pavement cracking and patching distresses. Comparisons were made to procedures currently used in the State.

Repeatability and distress identification were excellent on rigid pavements. Differences in distress identification {{and the effect of}} surface textures in the flexible test sections limited the repeatability and correlation of data to that of the Iowa DOT method. Cost data indicates that PAVEDEX is capable of providing comparable results with improved accuracy at a reasonable cost, but in excess of that experienced currently by the Iowa DOT.

50|$|The {{standard}} New Series Dalek design incorporates additional detailing {{to many of}} {{the components}} including the dome, gun, appendage boxes, plunger and eyeball. The fender is larger with a bevelled edge, the lower collar is integral to the casing and the upper collar and mesh are omitted, being replaced by a raised <b>shoulder</b> <b>section</b> beneath the neck bin. The slats have an indented central channel running down their length and the neck bin mesh has a denser, more complex design. The dome lights are substantially larger and enclosed in metal cages and the eye stalk pivot is surrounded by a cowl, below which is a horizontal oblong depression containing an ideogram unique to each Dalek. The standard New Series Dalek is finished in a metallic bronze colour scheme.|$|E
50|$|To {{explain the}} Daleks' ability to travel {{away from the}} static-charged floors of their city, the {{narrative}} has the Doctor stating that an aerial located {{at the edge of}} a mine in Bedfordshire is the key to the Daleks' power supply on Earth. Although not referred to directly in the story, it is implied that the parabolic dishes now fitted to the rear <b>shoulder</b> <b>section</b> of each prop act as receptors for a form of transmitted energy. Other design changes are a reduction in the number of eye discs to five and painting some eyeballs silver instead of the standard black colour. An amphibious capability is demonstrated in the closing moments of the first episode of the serial when a Dalek emerges from beneath the waters of the River Thames.|$|E

40|$|Granular {{shoulders}} {{are an important}} element of the transportation system and are constantly subjected to performance problems due to wind- and water-induced erosion, rutting, edge drop-off, and slope irregularities. Such problems can directly affect drivers’ safety and often require regular maintenance. The present research study was undertaken to investigate the factors contributing to these performance problems and to propose new ideas to design and maintain granular shoulders while keeping ownership costs low. This report includes observations made during a field reconnaissance study, findings from an effort to stabilize the granular and subgrade layer at six shoulder test sections, and the results of a laboratory box study where a <b>shoulder</b> <b>section</b> overlying a soft foundation layer was simulated. Based on the research described in this report, the following changes are proposed to the construction and maintenance methods for granular shoulders: • A minimum CBR value for the granular and subgrade layer should be selected to alleviate edge drop-off and rutting formation. • For those constructing new shoulder sections, the design charts provided in this report {{can be used as a}} rapid guide based on an allowable rut depth. The charts can also be used to predict the behavior of existing shoulders. • In the case of existing shoulder sections overlying soft foundations, the use of geogrid or fly ash stabilization proved to be an effective technique for mitigating shoulder rutting...|$|E

40|$|Granular {{shoulders}} need to {{be maintained}} {{on a regular basis}} because edge ruts and pot holes could possibly develop which could pose a safety hazard to vehicles. To stabilize shoulders and reduce the number of necessary maintenance cycles per season, one possible stabilizing agent - acidulated soybean oil soapstock (referred to as 2 ̆ 2 soapstock 2 ̆ 2) is investigated in this research. By the end of the study, researchers were able to determine whether and under what conditions this soapstock could be effective in mitigating edge rutting and pot holes for granular shoulders. In order to achieve this goal, a pilot testing project was conducted for selected problematic shoulders around northern and northeastern Iowa. Soapstock was applied on granular shoulders with monitoring during application and pre-and post-observations. In this thesis, application techniques were documented and percentage of application success was calculated for each treated <b>shoulder</b> <b>section.</b> As a result of this research, it is concluded that Soybean oil soapstock can be an effective stabilizer for granular shoulders under certain conditions. The documented application techniques could be used as the basis for future guidance for applying soapstock or similar products on granular shoulders.

40|$|Granular {{shoulders}} need to {{be maintained}} {{on a regular basis}} because edge ruts and potholes develop, posing a safety hazard to motorists. The successful mitigation of edge-rut issues for granular shoulders would increase safety and reduce the number of procedures currently required to maintain granular shoulders in Iowa. In addition, better performance of granular shoulders reduces the urgency to pave granular shoulders. Delaying or permanently avoiding paving shoulders where possible allows more flexibility in making investments in the road network. To stabilize shoulders and reduce the number of maintenance cycles necessary per season, one possible stabilizing agent—acidulated soybean oil soapstock—was investigated in this research. A pilot testing project was conducted for selected problematic shoulders in northern and northeastern Iowa. Soapstock was applied on granular shoulders and monitored during application and pre- and post-application. Application techniques were documented and the percentage of application success was calculated for each treated <b>shoulder</b> <b>section.</b> As a result of this research, it was concluded that soybean oil soapstock can be an effective stabilizer for granular shoulders under certain conditions. The researchers also developed draft specifications that could possibly be used to engage a contractor to perform the work using a maintenance-type construction contract.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the topic of {{asymmetric}} vortices on slender bodies at high angles of attack called the Phantom Yaw Effect. In contrast {{to most of the}} existing studies, the Phantom Yaw is investigated both on the still and on the moving body undergoing pitching motions with almost realistic pitch rates. Tests were performed at different Mach numbers (0. 5 ≤ M ≤ 1. 1) and Reynolds numbers (2. 0 ≤ 10 ^ 5 ReD ≤ 4. 2 ≤ 10 ^ 5) but only some of the results obtained at M = 0. 8 and ReD = 4. 2 ∙ 10 ^ 5 are presented within this paper. The test model is a generic missile configuration with a blunt nose and a high fineness ratio of 20. With this model, the influence of the (nose) roll angle, as well as the effect of an asymmetric transition fixation (at the nose and <b>shoulder</b> <b>section)</b> on the formation of asymmetric vortices were studied. The tests showed that the asymmetry can be triggered but they also revealed that the mechanisms are not simple and the effects not always distinct. Furthermore, symmetrical longitudinal side-jets in the shoulder region (aerostrakes) were used to force a symmetric flow separation {{in order to reduce the}} occurring side forces and yawing moments.
