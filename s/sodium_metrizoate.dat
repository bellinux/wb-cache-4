40|$|Cerebral {{computed}} tomography {{was performed in}} 60 patients referred for pre- and postcontrast scanning. The patients were randomly sampled with a non ionic contrast medium, iohexol, and an ionic contrast medium, <b>sodium</b> <b>metrizoate.</b> No compli-cations were seen, and the adverse effects, usually a feeling of warmth, were very minor with both contrast media, but iohexol caused less discomfort than <b>sodium</b> <b>metrizoate.</b> A series of measurements of the attenuation values of well defined intracra-nial structures was performed and no difference in enhancement {{was found between the}} two contrast media. Although the importance of intravenous injection of contrast med ia for enhancement of patholog ic lesions in cerebral {{computed tomography}} (CT) has been documented in numerous publications, very few reports comparing the effects of various contrast media have been published (1). No c linical study comparing non ionic and ion ic con trast med ia in CT has hitherto been reported. One would not expect a priori to find differences in the enhancement propert ies of monomeric non ionic and ionic contrast media, since their mole-cules are of about the same size. However, the possibility cannot be excluded since minor differences were found in a recent exper-imental animal study comparing non ionic and ionic contrast media in CT of the liver in pigs (2). The introduction of non ionic contrast media in myelog raphy and angiog raphy has reduced the frequency of adverse effects in these procedures [3 - 5). Thus, one of the intentions with the present stud y was to find out wheth er the freq uency of adverse effec ts was reduced after intravenous injections of a non ionic contrast med ium. Our study was performed as a double-blind c linical trial compar-ing the ionic contrast medium <b>sodium</b> <b>metrizoate</b> (Isopaque) with the non ionic compound iohexol (fig. 1) (6). Th e recording of adverse effects was performed by using standardized questions in addition to careful recording of any signs caused by the contrast medium. To study the enhancement properties a series of measurements was performed in various well defined anatomic structures...|$|E
40|$|Numerous iodide-containing {{compounds}} {{are used}} in radiographic contrast media. Severe, un-toward reactions to these agents are of two types, cardiorespiratory collapse and, less commonly, anaphylactic reactions (Goodman and Gilman, 1965). This paper reports a case of severe laryngeal oedema which developed as an allergic reaction to <b>sodium</b> <b>metrizoate</b> 75 per cent (Triosil) administered during cardiac catheterization. Emergency laryn-gostomy was performed to prevent fatal asphyxia. Mullins et al. (1963) reported death due to asphyxia from laryngeal oedema after intravenous Hypaque (sodium diatrizoate), and Youngblood, Williams, and Tuggle (1956) a similar death after intravenous sodium acetrizoate, but survival of a patient under these circumstances has not been previously reported.

40|$|For {{in vitro}} {{isolation}} of lymphocytes from peripheral blood. Summary {{of the method}} Early methods for isolating leukocytes involved mixing blood with a compound which aggregated the erythrocytes but only slightly affected leukocytes. With centrifugation, erythrocytes pelleted due to their increase density, and leukocytes were collected from {{the upper part of}} the tube. Boyum 3 introduced a more convenient and rapid separation using centrifugation through a Ficoll-sodium metrizoate solution. Diluted blood was layered over the Ficoll-sodium metrizoate solution and centrifuged at a low speed for a short time. Erythrocytes and granulocytes sedimented to the bottom of the tube, and mononuclear cells (lymphocytes) and platelets were collected from the interface between the two phases. Modifications of the Boyum formulation have been made by numerous workers. "LSM " produced by MP Biomedicals, has a unique formulation using the successful substitution of sodium diatrizoate for the <b>sodium</b> <b>metrizoate.</b> Principle of the procedur...|$|E
40|$|Neutrophil {{polymorphonuclear}} granulocytes (PMN) are {{the most}} abundant leukocytes in humans and among the first cells to arrive {{on the site of}} inflammatory immune response. Due to their key role in inflammation, neutrophil functions such as locomotion, cytokine production, phagocytosis, and tumor cell combat are extensively studied. To characterize the specific functions of neutrophils, a clean, fast, and reliable method of separating them from other blood cells is desirable for in vitro studies, especially since neutrophils are short-lived and should be used within 2 - 4 hours of collection. Here, we demonstrate a standard density gradient separation method to isolate human neutrophils from whole blood using commercially available separation media that is a mixture of <b>sodium</b> <b>metrizoate</b> and Dextran 500. The procedure consists of layering whole blood over the density gradient medium, centrifugation, separation of neutrophil layer, and lysis of residual erythrocytes. Cells are then washed, counted, and resuspended in buffer to desired concentration. When performed correctly, this method has been shown to yield samples of > 95 % neutrophils with > 95 % viability...|$|E
40|$|Incubation of bovine thymus {{lymphocytes}} with SRBCs for 1 hr or more at 0 degrees C {{during the}} E-rosette test gave higher rosette counts than tests receiving no such incubation. Further enhancement was seen if lymphocytes were stored in foetal calf serum (FCS) or BSA solutions at 4 degrees C for 18 hr prior to rosette tests. Best enhancement due to storage in BSA was seen when cells were subsequently tested in FCS. However, after storage in BSA many rosettes occurred when tests {{were done in}} BSA, Albeit few rosettes occurred in BSA without prior storage. Less enhancement was seen after storage in <b>sodium</b> <b>metrizoate</b> (NaM). Enhancement in FCS and 10 % BSA occurred after 1 day, but not 2 or more days, of storage at 4 degrees C, but was not seen when cells were stored at 37 degrees C. Rosette formation was about doubled by centrifugation of lymphocytes through BSA gradients prior to rosette tests; centrifugation through NaM gradients had no such effect. It is suggested that rosette formation is a property of an immature bovine T cell, and that on storage some cells develop and subsequently lose the ability to form rosettes...|$|E
