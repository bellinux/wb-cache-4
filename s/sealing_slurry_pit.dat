The selection of an appropriate recipe for <b>sealing</b> <b>slurry</b> is a challenge for the cementing services and research units. Both fresh and set slurry should meet a number of technological requirements. Various chemical, physical and mechanical properties of the ground and rock mass media to a different degree influence the technological parameters of the injected fluid. The <b>sealing</b> <b>slurries</b> have to meet certain criteria if the high efficiency of works is to be provided. The first of them is the criterion of physicochemical congruence with the environment. The second condition stems from the criterion of pumping the slurry. It is realized by selecting an appropriate rheological model and rheological parameters of the <b>sealing</b> <b>slurry.</b> The third requirement is connected with the need of providing suitable strength and durability of hardened <b>sealing</b> <b>slurries</b> {{as a result of the}} physicochemical processes. The fourth condition should account for the economy and ecology factors. The selection of recipes for <b>sealing</b> <b>slurries</b> should not be accidental or an output of unfniished laboratory tests.

The objective of our study is {{to improve the quality of}} simulation results by PMM, and to assess the effects of air velocity above the slatted floor (as affected by wind), pit headspace height (as affected by amount of <b>slurry</b> in the <b>pit)</b> and sidewall height (as affected by the dairy house sidewall) on the airflow features inside the pit and ammonia emission from the pit. Three different CFD models of a slatted floor were developed to evaluate whether porous media is capable to represent a slatted floor for modelling the airflow inside and ammonia emission from the <b>slurry</b> <b>pit,</b> and to study the effect of turbulence treatment in the porous media on the modelling results: a slatted floor model (SFM) which models the slatted floor as it is, a turbulent porous media model (PMM-T) and a laminar porous media model (PMM-L). Both PMM-T and PMM-L represent the slatted floor by porous media, the PMM-T assumes turbulent airflow and the PMM-L assumes laminar airflow in the porous media. The SFM was verified for a dataset acquired from a 1 : 8 scale wind tunnel model of the <b>slurry</b> <b>pit.</b> Results showed that the PMM (PMM-T and PMM-L) were able to predict both the airflow features inside the <b>slurry</b> <b>pit</b> and the ammonia emission from the <b>slurry</b> <b>pit</b> if the resistance parameters and flow regime of the porous media were properly set. In comparison to the SFM, the PMM-T predicted the flow pattern better, but overestimated the turbulence intensity and the consequent emission rate.

The 100 % opening area meant that the headspace {{was an integral part}} of the room air space, and this configuration was used as the reference treatment. The pig house model had two sidewall inlets and exhaust in the middle of the ceiling. The liquid slurry used was from a growing/finishing pig building and consisted of 1 % to 2 % dry matter, had pH of 8. 05, and TAN (total ammonia nitrogen) of 2. 38 g/L. Experiments in a model growing/finishing swine barn were conducted to determine the effects of room ventilation rate, <b>slurry</b> <b>pit</b> air exchange rates, slatted floor openings, and pit headspace on ammonia emissions. The results showed that ammonia emission rate increased as ventilation rate increased with a constant inlet opening. Increase in the slatted floor opening ratio increased the air exchange rate in the <b>slurry</b> <b>pit,</b> resulting in a higher ammonia emission rate. Different correlations between the ammonia emission rate and the air headspace height in the <b>slurry</b> <b>pit</b> caused by the type of flow in the boundary layer influenced the ammonia transport from the slurry surface to the ventilation air. A statistical model was developed to calculate the ammonia emission rate as a function of ventilation rate, slatted floor opening ratio, and <b>slurry</b> <b>pit</b> headspace (R 2 = 0. 93). It was found that the NH 3 emission rate was more sensitive to the ventilation rate than to the slatted floor opening ratio and air headspace height in the pit. In addition, the NH 3 emission rate was much more sensitive to variations in the ventilation rate at low ventilation rates than at high ventilation rates. Similar sensitivity responses were obtained for both slatted floor opening ratio and air headspace height...|$|R
40|$|Pig {{production}} in Zambia {{is estimated to}} grow at 8 % per annum. This growth has resulted in increased amounts of manure that requires management consequently increasing methane emissions from the manure management systems used. Methane is a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. Despite the increase in pig production there is inadequate research based information pertaining to methane emissions from pig manure management systems and how to reduce them. The study is aimed at estimating the reduction in methane emissions through changing manure management systems {{from the use of}} <b>slurry</b> <b>pits</b> to the use of anaerobic digesters on three piggeries in Zambia. This study will provide information to: policy makers, donors, development planners, livestock farmers and other stakeholders on the appropriate type of manure management system that should be introduced on livestock farms in Zambia in order to reduce manure methane emissions. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodology was used to estimate the methane emissions reduction on the three study farms. This method relies on two primary types of inputs that affect the calculation of methane emissions from manure: manure characteristics and type of manure management system.

The impact on greenhouse gasemissions, methane (CH 4), nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) of covering the <b>slurry</b> <b>pit</b> was also evaluated. Simultaneous field experiments were carried out using two similar pits at a farm with peat and polystyrene ball covers, which allowed direct comparison of the feasibility ofthe two covers to reduce gas emissions (measured using the dynamic chamber technique).

The <b>slurry</b> <b>pit</b> was emptied and the litter removed after each fattening period. The mean daily weight gains of the pigs raised on slatted floor and on deep litter were of 742 and 729 g/day, the food conversion ratios 3. 0 and 3. 1 kg/kg, the lean meat percentages 59. 8 and 60. 0 % and the prices at slaughter 1. 06 and 1. 04 E/kg live weight, respectively. None of the differences was statistically significant. The amounts of slurry and manure produced were 290 and 187 kg per fattening pig, corresponding to 3. 04 and 2. 06 kg nitrogen per fattening pig, respectively. These differences were significant.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Slurry</b> <b>Seal</b> is an {{impermeable}} non-structural {{thin layer}} {{that is used}} for pavement maintenance consisting of a cold laid mixture of asphalt emulsion with continuous graded fine aggregate, mineral filler, water and other added ingredients. Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) as the main filler {{in the application of}} <b>slurry</b> <b>seal.</b> Due to the relatively high cement prices and the pollution control for the environment; it is required to maintain the quality of the slurry by using a combination of OPC and LCFA (Low Calcium Fly Ash). This research was conducted to determine the value of consistency, setting time and indirect tensile strength (ITS) of <b>slurry</b> <b>seal</b> containing LCFA. A consistency testing used to obtain optimum moisture content to produce the sample {{for the rest of the}} test. The results show that with the addition of 5 % water for pre-wetting and subsequently 10 % of water content, the mixture provide appropriate consistency as required by highways standard. The time settings also meet the requirements of highways standard between 15 to 720 minutes for all types of mixtures. The mixture with composition of 50 % OPC and 50 % LCFA is considered as an ideal mixture at the optimum density value of 1. 769 g/cm 3, porosity of 9. 55 % and the indirect tensile strength of 30. 99 kPa. It could be concluded that fly ash can be used as OPC partial replacement and enhance the properties on <b>slurry</b> <b>seal</b> application...|$|R
