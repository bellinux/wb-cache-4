50|$|In 1981 the <b>Standardization</b> <b>policy</b> of Sri Lankan {{universities}} {{was introduced}} as an affirmative action program for students from areas which had {{lower rates of}} education than other areas due to missionary activity {{in the north and}} east, which essentially were the Tamil areas. Successive governments cultivated a historical myth after the colonial powers had left that the British had practised communal favouritism towards Christians and the minority Tamil community for the entire 200 years they had controlled Sri Lanka. However, the Sinhalese in fact benefitted from trade and plantation cultivations over the rest of the other groups and their language and culture as well as the religion of Buddhism was fostered and made into mediums for schools over the Tamil language, which did not have the same treatment and Tamils learned English instead as there was no medium for Tamil until near independence. Tamils' knowledge of English and education came from the very American missionary activity by overseas Christians that the British were concerned will anger the Sinhalese and destroy their trading relationships, so they sent them to the Tamil areas instead to teach, thinking it would have no consequences and due to their small numbers. The British sending the missionaries to the north and east was {{for the protection of the}} Sinhalese and in fact showed favouritism to the majority group instead of the minorities to maintain trading relationships and benefits from them. The Tamils, out of this random benefit from learning English and basic education excelled and flourished and were able to take many civil service jobs to the chagrin of the Sinhalese. The myth of Divide and Rule is untrue. The 'policy of standardisation' was typical of affirmative action policies, in that it required drastically lower standards for Sinhalese students than for the more academic Tamils who had to get about ten more marks to enter into universities. The policy, were it not implemented would have prevented the civil wars ahead as the policies had no basis and in fact is an example of discrimination against the Tamil ethnic group.|$|E

40|$|Information and {{communication}} technologies (ICT) have been combined with products from other industries to provide new functionality, as recently {{shown in the}} cases of Internet of Things (IoT). Modularity assumes a crucial role in such technological convergence, and has impacts on the relationship between organizations as well as competition within an industry. Interface standards, which ensure the connectivity between modules, serve as a critical factor in the process by which modularity affects organization systems and industry structure. To understand the aforementioned phenomenon, we studied modularity and interface standards with a focus on the interaction between technology and organization systems and subsequent changes in industrial dynamics. This paper examines previous literature on modularity and interface standards in the aspects of product architecture, organization systems, and institutional factors. With this analytical framework, we conducted a comparative analysis of electronic and automotive industries to derive implications for <b>standardization</b> <b>policy.</b> This research has shown the significance of external open interface standards in shaping an industrial landscape where a variety of module producers horizontally compete.

Much has been written on how this is a purposeful selection process often tied to larger social and political status and relationships. Moreover, knowledge is largely deemed appropriate based upon whose knowledge it is and for what student it is appropriate. Also, within the past two decades, there has been an increase in neoliberal school choice <b>policies</b> and neoconservative <b>standardization</b> <b>policies</b> in public education largely in the form of charter schools and high-stakes testing. These market policies aim to increase innovation and academic achievement via increased competition among schools and students.

In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, it is applied on several operating Hellenic transmission lines of 150 kV carefully selected among others due to their high failure rates during lightning thunderstorms.

Emailing, Blogging, Instant Messaging [...] . have become customary daily activities for many. While the wealth of media enriches our interaction experiences, it nonetheless constrains our ability to assimilate information from one location (information is stored online, on a local machine, and on the local network) and in one format. As a matter of fact, given our reliance on multiple communication channels, we have to resort to using several distributed applications that lack a unified visual interface and storage structure. Result: 1 - Incompatible message description and storage structures. 2 - Incompatible message transfer and notification standards. As in the case of Email and Instant Messaging which despite their many similarities are still highly non interoperable. 3 - No horizontal visibility across and within message media formats (Email, Blog, IM, etc [...] .) preventing unified searches, correspondence logging and centralized information management. 4 - Distributed contact and address repository, preventing access to a unified comprehensive 'Address Book'. Large corporations have the ability to resolve the issues above by forcing a top down <b>standardization</b> <b>policy</b> that regulates correspondence forms and formats between and across their business units.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 08 This {{dissertation}} takes {{national standard}} essential patent (“SEP”) policy for telecommunication markets {{as a case}} study of global regulatory competition. Nations or regions use technical standard-setting processes as a regulatory tool to promote or protect their local industries. A SEP is one that reads on a specific industry standard so that {{it is not possible to}} implement the technical standard without infringing or licensing the patent. Regulatory competition in information and communication technology (“ICT”) markets is complicated in part because ICT standards spread worldwide and they may cover hundreds or thousands of SEPs in different countries around the world. Different countries have different intellectual property (“IP”) regimes, standardization policies and SEP policies. Private enterprises may try to exploit these differences in an effort in order to dominate global ICT markets. In the past, global multinational corporations (“GMNCs”) based in western market economies have dominated global ICT standard-setting organizations (“SSOs”) and benefited enormously from SEP revenues earned in global markets, but China is now making progress in challenging this system. American telecommunication enterprises are strong innovators and so often obtain first-mover advantage in global markets. When they succeed in dominating global ICT standard setting processes, American telecommunication enterprises receive royalties through licensing SEPs around the world. American <b>standardization</b> <b>policy</b> is “market-led” because private enterprises are the leaders and the U. S. government only plays a supporting role. A major People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) government policy is to reduce or eliminate SEP royalties paid by Chinese enterprises to foreign enterprises, and to promote PRC indigenous standards as global standards, permitting PRC enterprises to collect SEP royalties from foreign sources. However, Chinese telecommunication enterprises are not as strong in innovation capacity as their American competitors. The PRC government encourages domestic enterprises to engage in Indigenous Innovation and to develop indigenous standards, so technology standard-setting in China is not “market-led. ” The processes are dominated by the government with the Chinese private sector only playing a supporting role. Both ICT standards and IP may support the construction of global markets through harmonization. To achieve harmonization, the ICT standardization and IP policies that make up national SEP policies should be similar around the world. But U. S. and China have different national cultures of innovation and legal cultures resulting in different SEP policies. Because U. S. and China are today among the most important national markets for the global telecommunication industry, it is interesting and important to consider how their competing SEP policies might support or resist the global harmonization trend. This dissertation uses global 3 G international telecommunication standards {{as a case study}} to compare U. S. and Chinese regulation of telecommunication technology standardization and national SEP policies. The analysis in this dissertation shows that, although the regulatory competition strategies of the United States and China have evolved over time, they are each largely determined by long-term historical and cultural factors that cannot change quickly. Because national strategies regarding patent law, standardization and SEPs tend to evolve slowly in response to rapidly changing global market conditions, it may be possible to predict the outcome of the coming contest over global 5 G telecommunication standards based on the outcomes of contests for control over 2 G, 3 G and 4 G standards...|$|E
