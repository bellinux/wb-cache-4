40|$|Copper {{in steel}} causes {{metallurgical}} problems, but is pervasive in end-of-life scrap and cannot currently be removed commercially {{once in the}} melt. Contamination can be managed to an extent by globally trading scrap for use in tolerant applications and dilution with primary iron sources. However, the viability of long-term strategies can only be evaluated with a complete characterization of copper in the global steel system and this is presented in this paper. The copper concentration of flows along the 2008 steel supply chain is estimated from a survey of literature data and compared with estimates of the maximum concentration that can be tolerated in steel products. Estimates of final steel demand and scrap supply by sector are taken from a global stock-saturation model to determine when the amount of copper in the steel cycle will exceed that which can be tolerated. Best estimates show that quantities of copper arising from conventional <b>scrap</b> <b>preparation</b> can be managed in the global steel system until 2050 assuming perfectly coordinated trade and extensive dilution, but this strategy will become increasingly impractical. Technical and policy interventions along the supply chain are presented to close product loops before this global constraint. K. D. is funded by a Cambridge Trust scholarship. A. S. and J.

40|$|In {{the last}} decades an inquiry {{increase}} of safe and lightweight material in the automotive industry was observed and therefore new steel grades such as high manganese steel were developed. Due to its reduction in weight and its high tensile strength, high manganese steel is a very attractive for the automotive. The focus of the SFB 761 “Stahl – ab initio” lays on the production and recycling of Fe-Mn-C(-Al). The production of high manganese steel takes place in various ways depending on the required process steps and following secondary metallurgical treatments. Recycling of high manganese steel is accompanied by different challenges in <b>scrap</b> <b>preparation</b> and melting procedure. HMnS is not crushed but deformed during shredding processes; [Mn]-deficiency is observed during melting processes. This {{can be explained by}} the manganese vapor pressure and [Mn]-affinity to oxygen which leads to a manganese loss. In this dissertation the recycling process and its metallurgical concept of high manganese steel was investigated by various laboratory experiments at the Department of ferrous metallurgy at Aachen University. The focus of this investigation lays on the [Mn]-deficiency caused by manganese oxidation und manganese vaporization, manganese phase distribution during HMn(Al) S-melting, the interfacial reactions as well as mass transfer of [Al] and [Si] at the melt/slag interface. The foamability of high (MnO) -containing slag were be studied too. Manganese loss can be reduced by high slag basicity, low melting temperature and low atmospheric pressure. These operating conditions leads to reduce the manganese phase distribution (LMn). An increase of [Mn]- and [Al]-concentration in the melt leads to manganese loss, which is mainly caused by vaporization. In addition, low [Mn]- and [Al]-concentration in slag leads to manganese loss caused by manganese oxidation. A low [Al]-concentration in the slag disagrees with the reduction of [Al]-transfer coefficient (β[Al]). (β[Al]) decreases with increasing [Al]-concentration at constant [Mn]-concentration. With increasing of slag basicity, (β[Al]) decreases because of low [Mn]-slagging and therefore low quantity of O 2 - ions in slag. Two mechanism were identified at the interface of HMnAl melt/slag, which regulate β[Al] and β[Si] at the phase boundary: viscosity and surface tension. Furthermore, the formation of crystalline phases such as Al-spinel as (Mg, Mn) Al 2 O 4 has a major influence. With increasing of [Al]-concentration, more crystalline Al-spinel were formed in the slag. With increasing of concentration of spinel phases at the interface, the influence of slag basicity on β[Al] and β[Si] increases. On the other hand, with decreasing of concentration of crystalline phases, slag basicity decreases which leads to higher surface tension and consequently to higher viscosity of slag and melt at the interface. To that effect, β[Al] decreases. The knowledge of melting temperature (Tliq. sl) and phase equilibrium of the slag were used to calculate viscosity and foamy index of the slag. High temperature destabilizes the foamability of slag containing high (MnO) -concentration. It should be avoided. High slag basicity and high (MnO) -concentration in slag consequence in poor foamability. It should be mentioned that the foamy index of slag is higher during HMnS production compared to the index in carbon steel production. The poor foamability of slag containing high MnO is attributed to the low reduction rate of (MnO) with carbon compared to (FeO) with carbon. Alternatively to {CO}-gas formation as a main component of foamy slag, slag can be foamed by {Ar}-gas injection. No indication of influences of {Ar} injection in the slag was observed, which improved the foamability of slag containing high MnO. Nevertheless, {Ar}-gas injection leads to a higher bath agitation in slag and consequently to higher manganese loss...|$|E
50|$|Since {{the late}} 1980s defense cuts, Ranger did not undergo the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) {{modernization}} process as did her three sisters and the later Kitty Hawk-class ships, {{and by the}} early 1990s, her material condition was declining. Both the outgoing Bush and incoming Clinton administrations recommended cuts to the defense budget, so the retirement of Ranger, along with her sisters Forrestal and Saratoga, was put forth. Ranger was decommissioned on 10 July 1993 after 36 years of service, and was at the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility, Bremerton, Washington. This decommissioning came instead of a refit scheduled for the same year. Such an extension would have extended Rangers life into 2002, requiring a reauthorization in 1994. In September 2010, the not-for-profit USS Ranger Foundation submitted an application to Naval Sea Systems Command proposing the donation of Ranger {{for use as a}} museum ship and multipurpose facility, to be located on the Columbia River at Chinook Landing Marine Park in Fairview, Oregon.

This report describes fuel handling development testing performed from May 1, 1997 through the end of August 1997. Testing during this period was mainly focused on performance of a Schilling Robotic Systems` Conan manipulator used to simulate a custom designed version, labeled Konan, being fabricated for K-Basin deployment. In addition to the manipulator, the camera viewing system, process table layout, and fuel handling processes were evaluated. The Conan test manipulator was installed and fully functional for testing in early 1997. Formal testing began May 1. The purposes of fuel handling development testing were to provide proof of concept and criteria, optimize equipment layout, initialize the process definition, and identify special needs/tools and required design changes to support development of the performance specification. The test program was set up to accomplish these objectives through cold (non-radiological) development testing using simulated and prototype equipment...|$|R
40|$|Mobile communication, in {{particular}} mobile telephony, is a service whose nonexistence nowadays is unimaginable. The ongoing, ever increasing penetration of mobile communication equipment, presently intensified by {{the transition from}} second generation 1 to third generation 2 mobile telephone technology, raises the necessity for environmentally sound production, operation and End-of-Life 3 treatment. In order to determine potentials to improve the overall environmental performance of large technical systems, such as mobile phone networks, Life Cycle Assessment 4 is increasingly accepted as the state-of-the art tool. Up to now, this tool has been primarily {{used to determine the}} environmental effects of the production and the use phase. The environmental consequences related to the EOL treatment of mobile telephone electronic scrap has been addressed only marginally. A reliable assessment of the overall environmental consequences however, requires a comprehensive analysis of all life cycle phases. The focus of the present thesis is directed towards the environmental assessment of the EOL treatment of scrap of mobile phone networks that comply with present and forthcoming mobile phone standards in order to provide in-depth knowledge on the related environmental effects. Additionally, reliable environmental data for future studies shall be generated. After a brief introduction in Chapter 1, the application of LCA for the environmental analysis of mobile phone networks is outlined in general in Chapter 2 (LCA method applied to mobile phone technology). A decomposition 5 of the mobile telephone network infrastructure is proposed in order to investigate the network components separately (hierarchical classification of the network components into classes A-D). Technical background knowledge, compiled in parallel, is used in order to assemble a mobile phone network model used for network recomposition later on. Similar to the network decomposition, a dissection of the End-of-Life 6 phase is proposed in order to explore and model the processing of the electronic scrap in the EOL phase appropriately. Subsequently, the infrastructure and communication techniques of the presently applied 2 G and 3 G mobile telephone networks are described in detail in Chapter 3 (Technical characterisation of mobile phone technology). Using the decomposition approach the mobile phone network infrastructure is characterised in detail. Technique related effects are explained. Applying the subdivision approach, the various EOL stages are presented. Chapters 4 and 5 compile the results of LCA studies performed for a separate network component and an entire network. The objects of the studies both comply with the modern Global System for Mobile communication standard 7. The Screening LCA of an antenna station rack (Chapter 4) is based on comprehensive inventories of an antenna station rack 8 and currently applied EOL treatment. The environmental impacts related to the End-of-Life treatment of the rack are investigated. Six different EOL treatment scenarios are developed to find an environmentally acceptable treatment alternative. System expansion, i. e. inclusion of the production phase, is applied to all scenarios in order to consider different amounts of recycled materials. The production of primary rack materials to substitute lost materials, especially that of palladium (which accounts for almost 40 % of the ecotoxicity impact category), dominates the overall environmental impact. Emissions of heavy metals from landfilled rack components/ materials and of by-products to the environment greatly influence the overall impacts on human health and ecosystem quality. The final disposal of rack components contributes to about 70 % of the non-carcinogenic effects. Landfilled dust from steel production contributes to nearly 11 % of this impact category. The results suggest that all precious metals containing electronic scrap should be treated in specially equipped metal recovery plants. A complete rack disassembly before processing in high-standard metal recovery plants is not necessary. An elaborated pre-treatment and fractionation of the scrap prior to precious material recovery does not lower the environmental impacts and is not mandatory and would only become environmentally interesting if high recovery of heavy metals is achieved. To avoid the formation and release of volatile and toxic heavy metals, incineration of electronic scrap and of by-products prior to landfilling should be avoided. To reduce the overall environmental load, standardisation of the sizes of rack components is recommended in order to facilitate their re-use. The LCA of a GSM Network (Chapter 5) comprises a life cycle assessment based on a detailed life cycle inventory for a typical GSM mobile phone network and related EOL treatment infrastructure. The environmental relevance of the three life cycle phases: production, use and EOL treatment has been analysed using IMPACT 2002 +. The environmentally preferable EOL treatment alternative was identified adopting the six earlier developed EOL treatment scenarios. Results indicate that environmental impacts attributable to the use phase dominate the environmental impacts during the entire life cycle of the network. The impacts of the production phase are primarily attributable to the energy intensive manufacturing of Printed Wiring Board Assemblies 9. The EOL phase dominates impacts on ecosystem quality. In particular long-term emissions of heavy metals cause critical effects. Detailed analysis of the EOL phase shows that recycling of network materials in general leads to a two fold reduction of environmental impacts: in the EOL phase itself as well as by means of the avoided primary production of materials that are recovered in the EOL phase. An increase in the material quality of the secondary precious and rare materials leads to a significant reduction of impacts on human health. The EOL phase is assessed in-depth by developing different EOL treatment scenarios. Comprehensive experimental results on the volatilisation of heavy metals from PWBA during thermal EOL treatment are presented in Chapter 6 (Heavy metal partitioning from electronic scrap during thermal End-of-Life treatment). Samples of identical PWBA have been incinerated in a Quartz Tube Reactor 10 in order to detect the volatility of selected key heavy metals in electronic <b>scrap.</b> In <b>preparation,</b> evaporation experiments were performed using a Thermo-Gravimeter 11 in connection with an Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emissions Spectrometer 12. The QTR-experiments were performed under reducing and under oxidising conditions at 550 and 880 °C. The volatilisation has been determined for As, Cd, Ni, Ga, Pb, Sb and Zn using ICP-OES. The results were evaluated by thermodynamic equilibrium calculations and in comparison with similar studies. Neither As nor Cd nor Ga could be detected in the incineration ash residuals, expressing a high volatility. Ni remains as stable compound in the ash. Zn shows an increasing volatility with increasing temperature and depending on the supply of oxygen. Sb shows a high volatility nearly independent on temperature and oxygen supply. The results imply that, if electronic scrap is incinerated, attention has to be paid {{in particular}} to Sb, As and Ga. These metals are increasingly used in new electronic equipment such as mobile phone network equipment of the third generation. The series of the core chapters is finalised by presenting results of a comparative LCA study performed for mobile phone networks complying with the GSM and Universal Mobile Telecommunication System standard 13 (Chapter 7 : LCA of of Second Generation (2 G) and Third Generation (3 G) Mobile Phone Networks). The environmental performance of presently operated GSM and UMTS networks was analysed, concentrating on the environmental effects of the EOL phase using the LCA method. The study was performed based on comprehensive life cycle inventory and life cycle modelling. The environmental effects were quantified using the IMPACT 2002 + method and the robustness of the results was tested with other LCIA methods. Based on technological forecasts, the environmental effects of forthcoming mobile telephone networks were approximated. The results indicate that a parallel operation of GSM and UMTS networks is environmentally detrimental and the transition phase should be kept as short as possible. The use phase (i. e. the operation) of the radio network components account for a large fraction of the total environmental impact. In particular, {{there is a need to}} lower the energy consumption of those network components. Seen in relation to each other, UMTS networks provide an environmentally more efficient mobile communication technology per bit transferred than GSM networks and a slightly higher absolute impact. In assessing the EOL phase, recycling the electronic scrap of mobile phone networks has clear environmental benefits. Under the present conditions, material recycling could help to lower the environmental impact of the production phase by up to 50 %. Based on the recapitulation of the achievements of the thesis and an outline of the thematic limitations, challenges for future studies are formulated in Chapter 8. The results documented in the thesis are supported by the complementing appendices (A-D).
