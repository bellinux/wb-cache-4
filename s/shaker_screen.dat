50|$|The tipple {{operated}} as a {{sorting station}} for coal {{to be shipped}} from the Reliance Mine. Loaded coal cars filled with mined coal were moved to a rotary car dumper {{at the south end}} of the tipple. The coal was dumped into a hopper, then moved to a <b>shaker</b> <b>screen</b> that sorted the coal by size. After sorting to slack, or powdered, nut, egg and lump, the coal went to a sorting table where debris was removed by hand. The sorted and inspected coal then went to chutes and hoppers for storage. Much of this equipment remains at the site.|$|E
5000|$|Levi New {{invented a}} non-chemical and non-thermal {{separation}} technique that utilizes airflow to pull egg shells through a venturi. The material {{is subjected to}} pressure waves while passing through the venturi. [...] A PulverDryer machine configured with a venturi sized to process egg shell pulverizes the shell component into fine powder and discharges the membrane as an intact dry flake material. The two components are separated in post processing by a standard <b>shaker</b> <b>screen</b> table, then the membrane is cleaned via one of several standard washing processes, depending on end use. Up to several tons of egg shell material can be processed per hour.|$|E
5000|$|These differing panel shapes {{are used}} {{in an attempt to}} reduce the {{quantity}} of panels on each frame but still provide maximum rigidity and support for the mesh attached to them. The purpose of reducing these panels is to maximize usable screening area as the walls of each panel {{get in the way of}} the mesh and prevent it from being used, this is known as [...] "blanking". The non-blanked screening area of a <b>shaker</b> <b>screen</b> is widely used as a selling feature, the more screen surface you have available to work the more efficient your shaker becomes and therefore can handle a higher quantity of fluid.|$|E
50|$|Some feeders can be {{equipped}} with a bypass valve {{at the bottom of}} the feeder which allows the drilling fluid to bypass the shaker basket and go directly into the hopper and back into the mud system without being processed by the <b>shaker</b> <b>screens.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Hopper - The Hopper, {{commonly}} called the [...] "base" [...] serves {{as both a}} platform for the shaker and collection pan for the fluid processed by the <b>shaker</b> <b>screens,</b> also known as [...] "underflow". The hopper can be ordered according {{to the needs of}} the drilling fluid, aka [...] "mud" [...] system. It can come in different depths to accommodate larger quantities of drilling fluid as well as have different ports for returning the underflow to the mud system.|$|R
5000|$|The {{semi-bituminous}} coal bed at Jerome, {{part of the}} Upper Kittanning formation, was approximately six feet thick, capped by shale and limestone, with a smooth, hard sandstone floor. In 1911, the mine had a capacity of 1,700 tons a day, with an average daily output of 1,020 tons. [...] The tipple had four loading tracks with a capacity of 80 cars. Within the tipple, coal was cleaned first by machine through <b>shaker</b> <b>screens,</b> then by hand, along a conveyor and at loading. [...] Refuse coal and rock was dumped in a hillside {{to the south of}} the tipple.|$|R
50|$|A <b>shaker</b> <b>screen</b> {{consists}} of the following parts:*Screen Frame- Much like a canvas for painting a screen has to be supported on a frame {{in order to do}} its job, this frame differs between manufacturers in both material and shape. Screen frames can be made from materials such as, square steel tubing, flat steel sheets, plastic type composites or they can just be supported on the ends with strips of steel (similar idea to a scroll). These frames consist of a rectangular shaped outer perimeter which is divided into small individual inner panels. These smaller panels differ in shape from manufacturer to manufacturer and have been known to come in shapes such as square, hexagonal, rectangular and even triangular.|$|E

5000|$|... 3D Screen Technology- One of {{the more}} recent {{advances}} in oilfield screen technology has brought us the [...] "3D screen", this technology is an innovative method for increasing the screening area of a shale shaker without the need to build larger machines. When seen from the side these screens look like corrugated cardboard, having a flat bottom and wave like shapes on top. These waves are designed to increase the surface area of the screen panel by building up instead of out, thereby maximizing the surface area of the screen without the need to build larger <b>shaker</b> <b>screens</b> and in turn larger, heavier and more expensive shakers.|$|R
50|$|Feeder- The Feeder is {{essentially}} a collection pan for the drilling fluid before it is processed by the shaker, it can come in many different shapes and sizes to accommodate {{the needs of the}} mud system. The most commonly used feeder is known as the weir feeder, the drilling fluid enters the feeder usually through a pipe welded to the outside wall {{near the bottom of the}} feeder tank, it fills the feeder to a predetermined point and like water flowing over a dam the mud (drilling fluid) spills over the weir and onto the screening area of the shaker. This method of feeding the shaker is most widely used due to its ability to evenly distribute the mud along the entire width of the shaker allowing for maximum use of the <b>shaker's</b> <b>screening</b> deck area.|$|R
5000|$|The Navalis AWP system {{utilizes}} a seven-stage {{process in}} order to treat wastewater. [...] The first stage involves wastewater entering the <b>shaker</b> <b>screens</b> which removes any noticeable solids. Then the wastewater is passed through an AET Roughing Reactor which help with chemical equalization and load. Then the influent is treated by a three-stage particle removal process which involve chemical flocculation, Hydraulic Separation, Tubular Filtration, and Ultra Filtration membranes. The waste influent is then passed through Oxidation Reactors which serve to oxidize pollutants and aid the production of carbon dioxide gas and water. The seventh and final stage consists of a powerful Ultraviolet Reactor in which the ozonated water is broken down into oxygen compounds that provide further treatment of the water. The leftover solids are then oxidized which provide safe bio-disposal or land based discharge if needed.|$|R
2500|$|Many whole {{oat groats}} break during the {{dehulling}} process, leaving the following types of groats to be sized and separated for further processing: whole oat groats, coarse steel cut groats, steel cut groats, and fine steel cut groats. Groats are sized and separated using <b>screens,</b> <b>shakers</b> and indent <b>screens.</b> After the whole oat groats are separated, the remaining broken groats get sized {{again into the}} three groups (coarse, regular, fine), and then stored. [...] "Steel cut" [...] refers to all sized or cut groats. When not enough broken groats are available to size for further processing, whole oat groats are sent to a cutting unit with steel blades that evenly cut groats into the three sizes above.|$|R
40|$|Maurer Technology Inc. (MTI) {{formed a}} joint-industry {{partnership}} {{to fund the}} development of a hollow sphere dual-gradient drilling (DGD) system. Phase I consisted of collecting, compiling, analyzing, and distributing information and data regarding a new DGD system for use by the oil and gas industry. Near the end of Phase I, DOE provided funding to the project that was used to conduct a series of critical follow-on tests investigating sphere separation in weighted waterbase and oilbase muds. Drilling costs in deep water are high because seawater pressure on the ocean floor creates a situation where many strings of casing are required due to the relatively close spacing between fracture and pore pressure curves. Approximately $ 100 million have been spent {{during the past five years}} on DGD systems that place pumps on the seafloor to reduce these drilling problems by reducing the annulus fluid pressure at the bottom of the riser. BP estimates that a DGD system can save $ 9 million per well in the Thunderhorse Field and Conoco estimates it can save $ 5 to $ 15 million per well in its deepwater operations. Unfortunately, previous DGD development projects have been unsuccessful due to the high costs ($ 20 to $ 50 million) and reliability problems with seafloor pump systems. MTI has been developing a simple DGD system concept that would pump hollow glass spheres into the bottom of the riser to reduce density of the mud in the riser. This eliminates the requirement for seafloor pumps and replaces them with low cost mud pumps, shale shakers, and other oilfield equipment that can be operated on the rig by conventional crews. A $ 1. 8 million Phase I joint-industry project funded by five service companies and three operators showed that hollow spheres could be pumped well, but difficulties were encountered in separating the spheres from a polymer mud supplied by Halliburton due to the high viscosity of this mud at the low shear rates encountered on oilfield shale <b>shaker</b> <b>screens.</b> As a result, an excessive amount of this polymer mud flowed across the screen with the beads instead of through the screen. At the completion of the Phase I project, it was concluded that the hollow sphere system would not work effectively with the polymer mud tested. ExxonMobil and Shell engineers proposed that additional sphere separation tests needed to be conducted with weighted oilfield waterbase and oilbase muds to determine if the DGD system would work with these muds. The DOE agreed to provide a $ 200, 000 grant for these tests. The DOE-funded tests, described in this report, showed that the spheres could be pumped with conventional oilfield centrifugal and triplex mud pumps and separated effectively from both oilfield waterbase and oilbase muds using conventional oilfield shale shakers and hydrocyclones. As a result of the success of these DOE tests, this DGD system is ready for full-scale field testing, first on land wells and later in the offshore environment. Maurer Technology Inc. is currently proposing a Phase II project to oil companies to further develop this DGD concept. This project would be funded by four to eight operators. If Phase II tests are successful, Noble plans to commercialize this system with a service company partner that will market and operate the DGD system on Noble's and other drilling contractors' rigs...|$|R
