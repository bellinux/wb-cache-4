5|$|Most {{plays in}} the game are {{resolved}} {{in such a way}} that the <b>scorer</b> is not given more than one choice when recording the outcome of the play, but several types of plays are open to the interpretation of the official <b>scorer.</b> In any difficult judgment call where the official <b>scorer</b> is required to decide whether to credit a hit to the batter, the <b>scorer</b> is guided by rule 10.05. This rule directs the official <b>scorer</b> to give the benefit of the doubt to the hitter when the <b>scorer</b> believes that the decision to credit the batter with a hit is equally valid to an alternative scoring decision. In a similarly difficult judgment call where the official <b>scorer</b> believes that an earned run or an unearned run are equally valid scoring decisions, rule 10.16 directs the official <b>scorer</b> to give the benefit of the doubt to the pitcher.|$|E

5|$|The {{rules of}} {{baseball}} {{require that the}} official <b>scorer</b> view the game only from the press box, for two basic reasons. First, this ensures that every <b>scorer</b> has nearly the same perspective of the game. One of the intentions of this rule is to improve consistency in scorekeeping decisions between different official scorers working on different games at the same stadium, and between scorers in different stadiums. Second, the press box is the most neutral position within the stadium. Seated in the press box, the official <b>scorer</b> is surrounded by writers and broadcasters who are ostensibly neutral, and the <b>scorer</b> {{is less likely to}} be unduly influenced by the players, the coaches, and the crowd.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide the {{prevalence}} rates of mild, moderate and severe symptoms of social anxiety in a sample of high school students and to analyze gender differences and associated impairment levels within these three levels of severity. Five hundred and twenty students were assessed with the Social Anxiety Spectrum Self-Report (SHY-SR), a questionnaire that explores social anxiety spectrum. By applying two cut-off scores determined on a separate sample by using ROC analysis, the large majority (73. 3 %) of subjects were classified as low <b>scorers,</b> 9 % as medium <b>scorers</b> and 17. 7 % as high <b>scorers.</b> Fears related to social situations were reported both by high and medium <b>scorers.</b> Functional impairment defined by avoidance and school difficulties was more common among high <b>scorers,</b> but it was also reported to a significant extent by medium <b>scorers.</b> Compared to low and medium <b>scorers,</b> high <b>scorers</b> showed a higher F/M ratio (about 4 : 1) and a more homogeneous symptomatological profile in the two genders. In conclusion, our report confirms, in line with the literature, that even moderate levels of social anxiety are associated with significant functional impairment and distress for the individuals...|$|R
