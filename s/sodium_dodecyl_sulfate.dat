X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry/thermogravimetric analysis, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and N- 2 -adsorption/desorption techniques are employed for morphology and structure characterizations. The different morphologies of NiO are obtained, which change from a two-dimensional flake to a zero-dimensional mesoporous sphere, dispersing {{on the surface of}} CNTs by changing the <b>sodium</b> <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulfate's</b> fraction in the reacting system. The electrochemical performance of NiO/CNT composites is largely affected by the morphology and distribution of the NiO phase. The zero-dimensional mesoporous sphere NiO shows the largest specific capacitance of 1329 F g(- 1) as well as a good cycle life during 1000 cycles in a 1 M KOH electrolyte at a very high current density of 84 A g(- 1) by chronopotentiometry measurement.

25|$|The first {{proteins}} to be purified are water-soluble proteins. Purification of integral membrane proteins requires {{disruption of}} the cell membrane in order to isolate any one particular protein from others {{that are in the}} same membrane compartment. Sometimes a particular membrane fraction can be isolated first, such as isolating mitochondria from cells before purifying a protein located in a mitochondrial membrane. A detergent such as <b>sodium</b> <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulfate</b> (SDS) can be used to dissolve cell membranes and keep membrane proteins in solution during purification; however, because SDS causes denaturation, milder detergents such as Triton X-100 or CHAPS can be used to retain the protein's native conformation during complete purification.|$|E
25|$|Proteins, unlike nucleic acids, {{can have}} varying charges and complex shapes, {{therefore}} {{they may not}} migrate into the polyacrylamide gel at similar rates, or at all, when placing a negative to positive EMF on the sample. Proteins therefore, are usually denatured {{in the presence of}} a detergent such as <b>sodium</b> <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulfate</b> (SDS) that coats the proteins with a negative charge. Generally, the amount of SDS bound is relative to the size of the protein (usually 1.4g SDS per gram of protein), so that the resulting denatured proteins have an overall negative charge, and all the proteins have a similar charge-to-mass ratio. Since denatured proteins act like long rods instead of having a complex tertiary shape, the rate at which the resulting SDS coated proteins migrate in the gel is relative only to its size and not its charge or shape.|$|E
40|$|A {{critical}} {{advantage of}} electrostatic assemblies over covalent and crystalline bound materials is that associated structures can be disassembled into their original constituents. Nanoscale devices {{designed for the}} controlled release of functional molecules already exploit this property. To bring {{some insight into the}} mechanisms of disassembly and release, we study the disruption of molecular electrostatics based interactions via competitive binding with ionic surfactants. To this aim free-standing micron-size wires were synthesized using oppositely charged poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) and poly(acrylic acid) coated iron oxide nanoparticles. The disassembly is induced by the addition of <b>sodium</b> <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulfates</b> that complex preferentially the positive polymers. The process is investigated at two different length scales: the length scale of the particles (10 nm) through the Quartz Crystal Microbalance technique, and that of the wires (> 1 micron) via optical microscopy. Upon surfactant addition, the disassembly is initiated at the surface of the wires by the release of nanoparticles and by the swelling of the structure. In a second step, erosion involving larger pieces takes over and culminates in the complete dissolution of the wires, confirming the hypothesis of a surface-type swelling and erosion process.

25|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulfate</b> (SDS) (C12H25NaO4S; mW: 288.38) (only used in {{denaturing}} protein gels) is {{a strong}} detergent agent used to denature native proteins to individual polypeptides. This denaturation, which {{is referred to as}} reconstructive denaturation, is not accomplished by the total linearization of the protein, but instead, through a conformational change to a combination of random coil and α helix secondary structures. When a protein mixture is heated to 100°C in presence of SDS, the detergent wraps around the polypeptide backbone. It binds to polypeptides in a constant weight ratio of 1.4 g SDS/g of polypeptide. In this process, the intrinsic charges of polypeptides become negligible when compared to the negative charges contributed by SDS. Thus polypeptides after treatment become rod-like structures possessing a uniform charge density, that is same net negative charge per unit weight. The electrophoretic mobilities of these proteins is a linear function of the logarithms of their molecular weights. Without SDS, different proteins with similar molecular weights would migrate differently due to differences in mass-charge ratio, as each protein has an isoelectric point and molecular weight particular to its primary structure. This is known as native PAGE. Adding SDS solves this problem, as it binds to and unfolds the protein, giving a near uniform negative charge {{along the length of the}} polypeptide.|$|E
25|$|For nucleic acids, urea is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used denaturant. For proteins, <b>sodium</b> <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulfate</b> (SDS) is an anionic detergent applied to protein samples to coat proteins in order to impart two negative charges (from every SDS molecule) to every two amino acids of the denatured protein. 2-Mercaptoethanol may also be used to disrupt the disulfide bonds found between the protein complexes, which helps further denature the protein. In most proteins, the binding of SDS to the polypeptide chain imparts an even distribution of charge per unit mass, thereby resulting in a fractionation by approximate size during electrophoresis. Proteins that have a greater hydrophobic content – for instance, many membrane proteins, and those that interact with surfactants in their native environment – are intrinsically harder to treat accurately using this method, due to the greater variability in the ratio of bound SDS. Procedurally, using both Native and SDS-PAGE together can be used to purify and to separate the various subunits of the protein. Native-PAGE keeps the oligomeric form intact and will show a band on the gel that is representative of the level of activity. SDS-PAGE will denature and separate the oligomeric form into its monomers, showing bands that are representative of their molecular weights. These bands can be used to assess the purity of and identify the protein.|$|E

[...] For this technique, proteins are run across an immobile gel with a pH gradient until they stop at the point where their net charge is neutral.

2500|$|By far {{the most}} common type of gel {{electrophoresis}} employs polyacrylamide gels and buffers loaded with <b>sodium</b> <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulfate</b> (SDS). [...] SDS-PAGE (SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) maintains polypeptides in a denatured state once they have been treated with strong reducing agents to remove secondary and tertiary structure (e.g. disulfide bonds [...] to sulfhydryl groups [...] ) and thus allows separation of proteins by their molecular mass. [...] Sampled proteins become covered in the negatively charged SDS and move to the positively charged electrode through the acrylamide mesh of the gel. Smaller proteins migrate faster through this mesh, and the proteins are thus separated according to size (usually measured in kilodaltons, kDa). The concentration of acrylamide determines the resolution of the gel - the greater the acrylamide concentration, the better the resolution of lower molecular weight proteins. [...] The lower the acrylamide concentration, the better the resolution of higher molecular weight proteins. Proteins travel only in one dimension along the gel for most blots.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{separating}} the proteins by mass, {{they are treated}} with <b>sodium</b> <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulfate</b> (SDS) along with other reagents (SDS-PAGE in 1-D). [...] This denatures the proteins (that is, it unfolds them into long, straight molecules) and binds a number of SDS molecules roughly proportional to the protein's length. [...] Because a protein's length (when unfolded) is roughly proportional to its mass, this is equivalent to saying that it attaches a number of SDS molecules roughly proportional to the protein's mass. [...] Since the SDS molecules are negatively charged, {{the result of this}} is that all of the proteins will have approximately the same mass-to-charge ratio as each other. [...] In addition, proteins will not migrate when they have no charge (a result of the isoelectric focusing step) therefore the coating of the protein in SDS (negatively charged) allows migration of the proteins in the second dimension (SDS-PAGE, it [...] is not compatible for use in the first dimension as it is charged and a nonionic or zwitterionic detergent needs to be used).|$|E

[...] Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry is also limited in its lack of a reference map from which to work with. [...] Complex algorithms are usually used to analyze the fringe results that occur after a procedure is run.

2500|$|As {{with all}} forms of gel electrophoresis, {{molecules}} may be run in their native state, preserving the molecules' higher-order structure. This method is called Native-PAGE. Alternatively, a chemical denaturant may be added to remove this structure and turn the molecule into an unstructured molecule whose mobility depends only on its length and mass-to-charge ratio. This procedure is called SDS-PAGE. <b>Sodium</b> <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulfate</b> polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) is a method of separating molecules based on the difference of their molecular weight.

[...] In this way, the detergent provides all proteins with a uniform charge-to-mass ratio, independently of their original charge. By binding to the proteins the detergent destroys their secondary, tertiary and/or quaternary structure denaturing them and turning them into negatively charged linear poly peptide chains. When subjected to an electric field in PAGE, the negatively charged poly peptide chains travel toward the anode with different mobility. Their mobility, or the distance traveled by molecules, is inversely proportional to the logarithm of their molecular weight. By comparing the relative ratio of the distance traveled by each protein {{to the length of}} the gel (Rf) one can make conclusions about the relative molecular weight of the proteins, where the length of the gel is determined by the distance traveled by a small molecule like a tracking dye.|$|E

Evidence for different types of hexagonal (H) phases, in systems with detergent and lipid amphiphiles, are reviewed.
