25|$|Many {{oscilloscopes}} {{have different}} plug-in modules for different purposes, e.g.,high-sensitivity amplifiers of relatively narrow bandwidth, differential amplifiers, amplifiers with {{four or more}} channels, sampling plugins for repetitive signals of very high frequency, and special-purpose plugins, including audio/ultrasonic <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzers,</b> and stable-offset-voltage direct-coupled channels with relatively high gain.|$|E
25|$|Other {{instruments}} {{convert the}} results of their measurements to a repetitive electrical signal, and incorporate an oscilloscope as a display element.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the field}} of {{satellite}} communications, <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzer</b> {{is one of the}} primary means of frequency monitoring, and it {{plays an important role in}} ensuring communication quality. According to the principle of the superheterodyne <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzer,</b> the design and realization of a spectrum acquisition unit based on MSP 430 F 149 MCU is given in this paper. Comparing the test results with those of the Agilent N 9020 <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzer,</b> the comparison shows that in the intermediate frequency signal monitoring, the <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzer</b> designed in this paper has reached the current performance level of the mainstream <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzer...</b>|$|R

They can {{provide you with a}} clear and precise window into the frequency spectrum. Also it discusses its function and requirement of a <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzer</b> in signal analysis. Also it discusses the types of <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzer</b> and their various applications in factories and in laboratories...|$|R
25|$|Usually the {{intermediate}} frequency {{is lower than}} the reception frequency fRF, but in some modern receivers (e.g. scanners and <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzers)</b> a higher IF frequency is used to minimize problems with image rejection or gain the benefits of fixed-tuned stages. The Rohde & Schwarz EK-070 VLF/HF receiver covers 10kHz to 30MHz. It has a band switched RF filter and mixes the input to a first IF of 81.4MHz. The first LO frequency is 81.4 to 111.4MHz, so the primary images are far away. The first IF stage uses a crystal filter with a 12kHz bandwidth. There is a second frequency conversion (making a triple-conversion receiver) that mixes the 81.4MHz first IF with 80MHz to create a 1.4MHz second IF. Image rejection for the second IF is not a major problem because the first IF provides adequate image rejection and the second mixer is fixed tuned.|$|E
2500|$|In 1978, the NASA SETI {{program had}} been heavily criticized by Senator William Proxmire, and funding for SETI {{research}} {{was removed from}} the NASA budget by Congress in 1981; however, funding was restored in 1982, after Carl Sagan talked with Proxmire and convinced him of the program's value. [...] In 1992, the U.S. government funded an operational SETI program, {{in the form of the}} NASA Microwave Observing Program (MOP). MOP was planned as a long-term effort to conduct a general survey of the sky and also carry out targeted searches of 800 specific nearby stars. MOP was to be performed by radio antennas associated with the NASA Deep Space Network, as well as the [...] radio telescope of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory at Green Bank, West Virginia and the [...] radio telescope at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. The signals were to be analyzed by <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzers,</b> each with a capacity of 15 million channels. These <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzers</b> could be grouped together to obtain greater capacity. Those used in the targeted search had a bandwidth of 1 hertz per channel, while those used in the sky survey had a bandwidth of 30 hertz per channel.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Harvard University {{physicist}} Paul Horowitz took {{the next step}} and proposed {{the design of a}} spectrum analyzer specifically intended to search for SETI transmissions. Traditional desktop <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzers</b> were of little use for this job, as they sampled frequencies using banks of analog filters and so were restricted in the number of channels they could acquire. However, modern integrated-circuit digital signal processing (DSP) technology could be used to build autocorrelation receivers to check far more channels. This work led in 1981 to a portable spectrum analyzer named [...] "Suitcase SETI" [...] that had a capacity of 131,000 narrow band channels. After field tests that lasted into 1982, Suitcase SETI was put into use in 1983 with the [...] Harvard/Smithsonian radio telescope at Oak Ridge Observatory in Harvard, Massachusetts. This project was named [...] "Sentinel" [...] and continued into 1985.|$|E

2500|$|A {{wide range}} of {{instrumentation}} is used by electrical engineers. [...] For simple control circuits and alarms, a basic multimeter measuring voltage, current, and resistance may suffice. [...] Where time-varying signals need to be studied, the oscilloscope is also an ubiquitous instrument. [...] In RF engineering and high frequency telecommunications, <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzers</b> and network analyzers are used. [...] In some disciplines, safety can be a particular concern with instrumentation. [...] For instance, medical electronics designers {{must take into account}} that much lower voltages than normal can be dangerous when electrodes are directly in contact with internal body fluids. Power transmission engineering also has great safety concerns due to the high voltages used; although voltmeters may in principle be similar to their low voltage equivalents, safety and calibration issues make them very different. [...] Many disciplines of electrical engineering use tests specific to their discipline. [...] Audio electronics engineers use audio test sets consisting of a signal generator and a meter, principally to measure level but also other parameters such as harmonic distortion and noise. [...] Likewise, information technology have their own test sets, often specific to a particular data format, and {{the same is true of}} television broadcasting.|$|E
5000|$|This {{form factor}} {{is useful for}} {{applications}} where the spectrum analyzer can be plugged into AC power, which generally means in a lab environment or production/manufacturing area. Bench top <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzers</b> have historically offered better performance and specifications than the portable or handheld form factor. Bench top <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzers</b> normally have multiple fans (with associated vents) to dissipate heat produced by the processor. Due to their architecture, bench top <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzers</b> typically weigh more than 30 lbs kg. Some bench top <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzers</b> offer optional battery packs, allowing them to be used away from AC power.
