500|$|Though Jackson {{considered}} the ending [...] "overwrought", {{he felt that}} it [...] "pulled the rug"; [...] "turning on a sixpence, the screams of 'Kathy' turned truly horrifying; the tackiness suddenly real and disturbing". Mellor {{considered the}} ending [...] "a terrific twist {{as long as you}} didn’t look at it too closely", arguing that the interviewer's patience and the crew's collusion were unlikely. However, she suggested, there is little to be gained by criticising these aspects of the episode. For Baylis, the ending was unexpected, revealing [...] "darkness of the shabby human kind". In the closing seconds of the episode, he said, [...] "we suddenly <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> without seeing anything".|$|E
2500|$|After the Tate Britain's 2007 {{exhibition}} of Hogarth's works, the art critic Brian Sewell commented that, [...] "Hogarth <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> {{and saw it}} straight, without Rowlandson's gloss of puerile humour and without Gainsborough's gloss of sentimentality," [...] but in a piece entitled Hogarth the Ham-fisted condemned the heavy-handedness and lack of subtlety that made his images an [...] "over-emphatic rant in his crude insistence on excessive and repetitive detail to reinforce a point." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Esquire in January 2010, Blagojevich said about President Obama, [...] "Everything he's saying's on the teleprompter. I'm blacker than Barack Obama. I shined shoes. I {{grew up in a}} five-room apartment. My father had a little laundromat in a black community not far from where he lived. I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> growing up." [...] He soon backpedaled from the term [...] "blacker than", saying that he chose his words poorly, but he stood by his message that [...] "the frustration is real, and the frustration is still, today, average, ordinary people aren't getting a fair shake." ...|$|E
6000|$|Oh he <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> now <b>all</b> lucidly--if not rather luridly--and thereby {{the more}} tragically. [...] "He {{described}} {{me in his}} nasty rage as consistently--well, heroic!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is wonderful," [...] said George. [...] "I never <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> at <b>all</b> out before. I wonder," [...] he added, with a sigh, [...] "if I shall {{ever have}} the {{fingering}} of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But my point," [...] Mr. Raymond Greene persisted, [...] "is that it wasn't suicide at all. I {{maintain}} that the situation as I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> presented <b>all</b> the possibilities {{of a different sort}} of crime." ...|$|R
2500|$|Common to {{the trilogy}} was a {{somewhat}} morbid {{look at the}} history of the Russian monarchy of the previous three centuries, where, as the author <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> <b>all</b> the efficient rulers happened to be evil, and all the 'good' ones proved to be inefficient. The three stories of three different historical figures had similarly didactic finales: [...] "God help you, Tsar Ivan, and God forgive us all! That's the fate autocracy deserved! Here's the result of our disintegration!" [...] (Zakharyin's words over Ivan the Terrible's dead body), [...] "I am to blame for all of this... Oh God, why did you make me Tsar?!" [...] (Tsar Fyodor), [...] "What Evil spawns is only more evil and nothing else." [...] (Boris Godunov). All three parts of the trilogy, which, according to Nestor Kotlyarevsky, were [...] "united by the idea of tragedy being intrinsic to Tsarist power in Russia," [...] had serious problems with the censorship. The trilogy continued to divide opinion in Russia up until 1917. Not long before the Revolution, in Alexandrinsky Theatre the public reacted to Tsar Boris in an overtly political fashion. Monarchists applauded Boris Godunov's words, the left [...] "supported" [...] boyarin Sitsky, seeing in him a fighter of despotism.|$|E
60|$|Now {{the trap}} had closed on her--and she <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> {{when it was}} too late.|$|E
60|$|He <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> well enough--he the {{man with}} the far-seeing mind and the eagle-eyes that missed nothing--neither a look of indecision, nor an {{indication}} of revolt. He <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> but he could do nothing, for he too felt overwhelmed by that wave of indecision and of discouragement. Faith in himself, energy in action, had gone. He envisaged the possibility of a vanquished and dismembered France.|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{did you get}} here?" [...] she asked, rather shamelessly, {{since she}} had kept him from coming in the victoria, but amusingly, since she seemed {{to see it as}} a joke, if she <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> at <b>all.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'She {{talked of}} her duty! She sympathized! It was not till I {{was out of}} the house that I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> was <b>all</b> by way of letting me down easy-trapping me into binding myself on honour not to correspond.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Then-Chief Justice Rehnquist said White [...] "came {{as close}} as anyone I have known to meriting Matthew Arnold's {{description}} of Sophocles: 'He saw life steadily and he <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> whole.' <b>All</b> of us who served with him will miss him." ...|$|R
60|$|Orlando baptised the giant. The two companions then issued forth, {{and hearing}} a mighty {{noise in the}} house, looked back, and <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> vanished.|$|E
60|$|Poor abused girl! She stood dumb, smitten, paralyzed. It was pitiful to see. She {{had been}} beguiled, lied to, betrayed; she <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> now.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Wilkins's quick eyes <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> and {{she said}} to herself, in the closet, as she cut bread and rattled down a cup and saucer: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Was. And then I {{became a}} married man. I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> was <b>all</b> up {{with black and}} white, very soon--at least for a mediocrity, and I jumped on to process. Those posters on the Cliffs at Dover are by my people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing, for you," [...] he went on, [...] "is impossible. So go on." [...] He {{repeated}} it again--wanting her so {{to feel that}} to-day he <b>saw</b> <b>it.</b> [...] "You're <b>all</b> right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't see it, Jim. I don't {{think any}} of us <b>saw</b> <b>it.</b> We were <b>all</b> too much {{occupied}} looking for the trail. Another time, {{you tell me what you}} see without my asking.|$|R
6000|$|... "My darling," [...] {{said the}} mother, {{embracing}} her, [...] "I {{could not believe}} you more thoroughly even though I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> and heard it all." ...|$|E
60|$|Archie {{had spoken}} fast and brokenly but Rose {{understood}} {{and at the}} last word hid her face with a little moan, as if she <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{had never}} thought before of Hugh, but now, now, Dora's words {{came back to him}} at once, and he saw it all--he <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> plainly.|$|E
6000|$|But {{this was}} not the moment for remorse and despair. She had done--unwittingly--an awful and terrible thing--the very worst crime, in her eyes, that woman ever committed--she <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> in <b>all</b> its horror. Her very {{blindness}} in not having guessed her husband's secret seemed now to her another deadly sin. She ought to have known! she ought to have known! ...|$|R
6000|$|Polly {{looked up}} to thank him, but never did, for there was {{something}} deeper than gratitude in the honest blue eyes, that could not hide the truth entirely. Tom <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> flushed <b>all</b> over his brown face, and dropping the rubbers with a crash, took her hands, saying, in his old impetuous way, [...] "Polly, I {{want to tell you}} something!" ...|$|R
60|$|Old Mr. Toad looked where Danny was pointing, and {{his tongue}} darted out {{and back again}} so quickly that Danny wasn't sure that he <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> at <b>all,</b> but when he looked for the ant it {{was nowhere to be}} seen, and there was a {{satisfied}} twinkle in Mr. Toad's eyes. There was an answering twinkle in Danny's own eyes as he continued.|$|R
6000|$|ENID. It's such a horrid {{position}} for us. If {{you were the}} wife of the manager, and lived down here, and <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> You can't realise, Dad! ...|$|E
6000|$|Ah, he <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>all!</b> Yes, it was to-day, {{the day he}} left. Yes, she {{had thought}} it safe to cast Miguel off now--now that HE was gone! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh yes! Nurse Dolly told me. She <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> in {{a mystery}} play long long ago--when a Hand came out, {{and put in}} the stars and sun and moon.' ...|$|E
60|$|Such a hubbub had {{not been}} heard in that town for many a day. Back came Simon Agricola running, and there he <b>saw,</b> and took <b>it</b> <b>all</b> in in one look.|$|R
60|$|By {{the light}} of this blaze, they gave the first notice to their comrades that they were landed; and they in return, as was agreed as before, fired two guns as a signal that they <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> and were <b>all</b> safe.|$|R
500|$|The duo were {{disappointed}} with their performance, particularly Garfunkel, {{who felt that}} he sang poorly. Simon {{said that he did}} not immediately realize the magnitude of the event: [...] "I didn't get what had happened– how big it was– until I went home, turned on the television and <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> on <b>all</b> the news ... and later that night on the front pages of all the newspapers. Then I got it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Although I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> in the mind's eye [...] There can {{be nothing}} solider till I die; [...] I saw by the moon's light [...] Now at its fifteenth night.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush, hush! don't {{say another}} word," [...] he {{interrupted}} with a majestic {{wave of his}} hand. [...] "You needn't {{tell me what you}} have. I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> before you spoke." ...|$|E
60|$|The girl <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> now--the whole {{scheme to}} lure her to Blentz. Even then, though, {{she could not}} believe the king {{had been one of}} the conspirators of the plot.|$|E
6000|$|I {{was at my}} wit's end, and {{the young}} ladies <b>saw</b> <b>it.</b> They <b>all</b> {{surrounded}} my unmanageable sitter, and appealed to her compassion for me. [...] "Certainly!" [...] said mademoiselle, expressing astonishment by flinging up both her hands with all the fingers spread out in the air. [...] "But why apostrophize me thus? I am here, I am ready, I am {{at the service of}} this skillful artist. Why apostrophize me?" ...|$|R
60|$|There were trunks to {{be looked}} after, but the checks for these were turned over to Aleck, and the colored man <b>saw</b> to <b>it</b> that <b>all</b> the baggage was {{properly}} transferred to the steam yacht.|$|R
2500|$|... 2003 <b>saw</b> Sick of <b>It</b> <b>All</b> {{release their}} seventh studio album: Life on the Ropes. In 2004, the band also {{released}} {{an album of}} b-sides, covers and rare tracks entitled Outtakes for the Outcast, which contains some Sick of <b>It</b> <b>All</b> recordings.|$|R
