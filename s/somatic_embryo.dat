5000|$|The {{selection}} of seed source by the tree nursery is critical. The specific variety that is selected {{must meet the}} needs of its customers and be capable of germinating and growing in the climate where the nursery is located. The variety must also be able to thrive in the region where the tree farm that is purchasing the seedlings is located. Genetic variations within the species of conifers that are used for Christmas trees have produced individual varieties of trees that can thrive in certain climates where other varieties of the same species cannot. This same genetic variation can also produce trees that are aesthetically more pleasing than others. Knowledge of the seed source allows the nursery to provide trees that are suitable for their customer specific locations and needs as well as satisfy the desires of the end-purchaser who will take the tree home for Christmas. Scientists are working on methods to reduce the costs of artificially producing seeds for White spruce, Norway spruce, and Douglas fir through <b>somatic</b> <b>embryo</b> production in a liquid medium.

50|$|Somatic {{embryogenesis}} is {{an artificial}} {{process in which}} a plant or embryo is derived from a single somatic cell or group of somatic cells. Somatic embryos are formed from plant cells that are not normally involved {{in the development of}} embryos, i.e. ordinary plant tissue. No endosperm or seed coat is formed around a <b>somatic</b> <b>embryo.</b> Applications of this process include: clonal propagation of genetically uniform plant material; elimination of viruses; provision of source tissue for genetic transformation; generation of whole plants from single cells called protoplasts; development of synthetic seed technology. Cells derived from competent source tissue are cultured to form an undifferentiated mass of cells called a callus. Plant growth regulators in the tissue culture medium can be manipulated to induce callus formation and subsequently changed to induce embryos to form from the callus. The ratio of different plant growth regulators required to induce callus or embryo formation varies with the type of plant. Somatic embryos are mainly produced in vitro and for laboratory purposes, using either solid or liquid nutrient media which contain plant growth regulators (PGR’s). The main PGRs used are auxins but can contain cytokinin in a smaller amount. Shoots and roots are monopolar while somatic embryos are bipolar, allowing them to form a whole plant without culturing on multiple media types. Somatic embryogenesis has served as a model to understand the physiological and biochemical events that occur during plant developmental processes as well as a component to biotechnological advancement. The first documentation of somatic embryogenesis was by Steward et al. in 1958 and Reinert in 1959 with carrot cell suspension cultures.|$|E

Use of {{secondary}} <b>somatic</b> <b>embryos</b> promotes genetic fidelity in cryopreservation of cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.). Agricultural and Food Science, 18, (2 (Special issue)), 152 - 159. Sponsorship: COCOA RESEARCH UK IMPF: 00. 92 RONO: 00 The inability to conserve cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) germplasm via seed storage and {{the vulnerability of}} field collections make the establishment of cryopreserved genebanks for the crop a priority. An effective encapsulation-dehydration based cryopreservation system has been developed for cocoa but because the <b>somatic</b> <b>embryos</b> used for freezing arise after a protracted period of callus culture there is concern about maintenance of genetic fidelity during the process. Microsatellite markers for seven of the 10 cocoa linkage groups were used to screen a population of 189 primary somatic embryo-derived emblings and the 43 secondary <b>somatic</b> <b>embryos</b> they gave rise to. Of the primary <b>somatic</b> <b>embryos,</b> 38. 1 % exhibited polymorphic microsatellite profiles while for secondary <b>somatic</b> <b>embryos</b> the frequency was 23. 3 %. The same microsatellite markers used to screen another population of 44 secondary <b>somatic</b> <b>embryos</b> cryopreserved through encapsulation-dehydration revealed no polymorphisms. Scanning electron microscopy showed the secondary <b>somatic</b> <b>embryos</b> were derived from cotyledonary epidermal cells rather than callus.

40|$|Somatic {{embryogenesis}} is {{a powerful}} tool for plant regeneration and also provides a suitable material for investigating the molecular events that control the induction and development of <b>somatic</b> <b>embryos.</b> This study focuses on expression analysis of the QrCPE gene (which encodes a glycine rich protein) during the initiation of oak <b>somatic</b> <b>embryos</b> from leaf explants and also during the histodifferentiation of <b>somatic</b> <b>embryos.</b> Northen blot and in situ hybridization were used to determine the specific localization of QrCPE mRNA. The results showed that the QrCPE gene is developmentally regulated during the histodifferentiation of <b>somatic</b> <b>embryos</b> and that its expression is tissue- and genotype- dependent. QrCPE was strongly expressed in embryogenic cell aggregates and in embryogenic nodular structures originated in leaf explants {{as well as in the}} protodermis of <b>somatic</b> <b>embryos</b> from which new embryos are generated by secondary embryogenesis. This suggests a role for the gene during the induction of <b>somatic</b> <b>embryos</b> and in the maintenance of embryogenic competence. The QrCPE gene 2 was highly expressed in actively dividing cells during embryo development, suggesting that it participates in embryo histodifferentiation. The localized expression in the root cap initial cells of cotyledonary <b>somatic</b> <b>embryos</b> and in the root cap of somatic seedlings also suggests that the gene may be involved the fate of root cap cells.

40|$|The {{composition}} of basal medium determines the regeneration success of in vitro culture. The study aimed {{to evaluate the}} effect of basal medium in the primary callus induction medium and explant type on the formation of cacao <b>somatic</b> <b>embryo.</b> The research was conducted at the Tissue Culture Laboratory of IAARD, Bogor, from June 2014 to December 2015. Primary callus induction derived from staminoid and petal explants of ICCRI 4 clone used two types of basal medium, i. e. DKW+ 9 µM 2. 4 -D + 1. 16 µM kinetin or WPM + 9 µM 2. 4 -D + 1. 16 µM kinetin. After 14 days, callus was subcultured onto secondary callus induction medium (WPM + 2. 4 -D 9 μM + kinetin 0. 58 μM), and then onto DKW medium without growth regulators to induce the formation of <b>somatic</b> <b>embryo.</b> The research was designed in two-factor factorial design with five replications. The first factor {{was the type of}} basal medium on the primary callus induction medium (DKW and WPM) and the second factor was the type of explants (petal and staminoid). The results showed significant interaction effect between basal medium type and explant type on the formation of callus and <b>somatic</b> <b>embryo</b> of cacao. The highest percentage of callus formation was derived from staminoid explants on the DKW basal salt medium (92. 5 %). However, the highest percentage of <b>somatic</b> <b>embryo</b> formation and the number of <b>somatic</b> <b>embryo</b> per explant were obtained from DKW basal salt medium with petal explants (36. 5 % and 2. 3).

40|$|Abstract: An {{efficient}} {{somatic embryogenesis}} {{system has been}} established in Carthamus tinctorius (L.) in which primary and secondary embryogenic calluses were developed from hypocotyls and primary cotyledonary somatic embryos (PCSEs). Two types of calluses were different in morphology and growth behaviour. Hypocotyl-derived embryogenic callus (HEC) was friable and fast-growing, while secondary callus derived from PCSE was compact and slow-growing. HEC differentiated into somatic embryos which proliferated quickly on 1 1 medium supplemented with thidiazuron (TDZ) (1. 0 mg l) and spermidine (SPD) (1. 5 mg l). Although differentiation and proliferation of somatic embryos were faster in primary HEC, maturation and germination efficiency were better in somatic embryos developed from primary cotyledonary <b>somatic</b> <b>embryo</b> derived secondary embryogenic callus (PCSEC). At the biochemical level, two somatic embryogenesis systems were different. Both primary and secondary adventives somatic embryogenesis and the role of plant growth regulators in two modes of <b>somatic</b> <b>embryo</b> formation have been discussed.
