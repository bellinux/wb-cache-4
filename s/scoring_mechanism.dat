25|$|Pinball scoring can be {{peculiar}} and varies {{greatly from}} machine to machine. During the 1930s and the 1940s, lights mounted behind the painted backglasses {{were used for}} scoring purposes, making the scoring somewhat arbitrary.

Then later, during the 1950s and 1960s when the <b>scoring</b> <b>mechanism</b> was limited to mechanical wheels, high scores were frequently only in the hundreds or thousands. (Although, {{in an effort to keep}} with the traditional high scores attained with the painted backglass games, the first pinball machines to use mechanical wheels for scoring, such as Army Navy, allowed the score to reach into the millions by adding a number of permanent zeros to the end of the score.) The average score changed again in the 1970s with the advent of electronic displays. Average scores soon began to commonly increase back into tens or hundreds of thousands. Since then, there has been a trend of scoring inflation, with modern machines often requiring scores of over a billion points to win a free game. At the peak of this trend, two machines, Johnny Mnemonic and Attack from Mars, have been played into the trillions. Another recent curiosity is the 1997 Bally game NBA Fastbreak which, true to its theme, awards points in terms of a real basketball score: Each successful shot can give from one to three points. Getting a hundred points by the end of a game is considered respectable, which makes it one of the lowest scoring pinball machines of all time. The inflated scores are the source of one of the Spanish-language names of pinball machines, máquina del millón ("million machine").|$|E

The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate 3 different <b>scoring</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of p 16 INK 4 a immunohistochemical (IHC) staining in distinguishing between primary ECAs and EMAs. Methods A tissue microarray (TMA) was constructed using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from hysterectomy specimens, including 14 ECAs and 24 EMAs. Tissue array sections were immunostained with a commercially available antibody of p 16 INK 4 a. Avidin-biotin complex (ABC) method was used for antigens visualization. The staining intensity and area extent of the IHC reactions was evaluated using the semi-quantitative scoring system. The 3 scoring methods were defined on the bases of the following: (1) independent cytoplasmic staining alone (Method C), (2) independent nucleic staining alone (Method N), and (3) mean of the sum of cytoplasmic score plus nucleic score (Method Mean of C plus N). Results Of the 3 <b>scoring</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for p 16 INK 4 a expression, Method N and Method Mean of C plus N showed significant (p-values Conclusion According to the data characteristics and test effectiveness in this study, Method N and Method Mean of C plus N can significantly signal to distinguish between ECAs and EMAs; while Method C cannot do.

40|$|Abstract - Learning from rewards {{generated}} by a human trainer observing an agent in action has been {{proven to be a}} powerful method for teaching autonomous agents to perform challenging tasks, especially for those non-technical users. Since the efficacy of this approach depends critically on the reward the trainer provides, we consider how the interaction between the trainer and the agent should be designed so as to increase the efficiency of the training process. This article investigates the influence of the agent’s socio-competitive feedback on the human trainer’s training behavior and the agent’s learning. The results of our user study with 85 participants suggest that the agent’s passive socio-competitive feedback—showing performance and score of agents trained by trainers in a leaderboard—substantially increases the engagement {{of the participants in the}} game task and improves the agents’ performance, even though the participants do not directly play the game but instead train the agent to do so. Moreover, making this feedback active—sending the trainer her agent’s performance relative to others—further induces more participants to train agents longer and improves the agent’s learning. Our further analysis shows that agents trained by trainers affected by both the passive and active social feedback could obtain a higher performance under a <b>score</b> <b>mechanism</b> that could be optimized from the trainer’s perspective and the agent’s additional active social feedback can keep participants to further train agents to learn policies that can obtain a higher performance under such a <b>score</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China (Grant No. 841713015) China Postdoctoral Science Foundatio...|$|R
