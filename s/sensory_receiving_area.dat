40|$|International audienceTo be {{considered}} specific for nociception, a cortical region should (a) have plausible connections with ascending nociceptive pathways; (b) be activated by noxious stimuli; (c) trigger nociceptive sensations if directly stimulated, and (d) tone down nociception when injured. In addition, lesions {{in this area}} should have a potential to develop neuropathic pain, {{as is the case}} of all lesions in nociceptive pathways. The single cortical region approaching these requirements in humans encompasses the suprasylvian posterior insula and its adjoining medial operculum (referred to as "PIMO" in this review). This region does not contain, however, solely nociceptive networks, but represents in primates the main <b>sensory</b> <b>receiving</b> <b>area</b> of the spinothalamic system, and as such contributes to the processing of thermo-sensory, nociceptive, C-fibre tactile, and visceral input. Nociception (and, a fortiori, pain) should therefore not {{be considered}} as a separate sensory modality, but rather as one component of a global system subtending the most primitive forms of somatosensation. The medial opercular part of the PIMO is cytoarchitectonically and functionally distinct from the outer operculum containing the S 2 /PV sensory areas. Although a clear functional segregation of PIMO sub-areas has not yet been achieved, some preferential distribution has been described in humans: pain-related networks appear preferentially distributed within the posterior insula, and non-noxious thermal processing in the adjacent operculum. Thus, spinothalamic sub-modalities may be partially segregated in the PIMO, in analogy with the separate representation of dorsal column input from joint, muscle spindle and tactile afferents in S 1. Specificity, however, may not wholly depend on ascending 'labelled lines' but also on cortical network properties driven by intrinsic and extrinsic circuitry. Given its particular anatomo-functional properties, thalamic connections, and tight relations with limbic and multisensory cortices, the PIMO region deserves to be considered as a third somatosensory region (S 3) devoted to the processing of spinothalamic inputs...|$|E
40|$|In cats anaesthetized with chloralose, {{evidence}} has been sought for the projection of information from tendon organs to the <b>sensory</b> <b>receiving</b> <b>areas</b> of the cerebral cortex. Selective stimulation of afferent fibres from tendon organs has been achieved by raising the threshold to electrical stimulation of the fibres from primary endings of muscle spindles. The method uses longitudinal vibration at 200 - 250 Hz to elicit, {{over a period of}} 20 min, one impulse for each excursion of the vibrator from all of the spindles in the test muscle, soleus or medial gastrocnemius. The accumulated post-spike positivities following passage of the impulses are thought to be responsible for the rise in threshold. Segmental monosynaptic reflex testing after a bout of vibration was used to confirm that the residual Group I volley no longer contained impulses from muscle spindles. The volley in response to stimulating the nerve of the test muscle was timed to facilitate the monosynaptic reflex of a synergist. Before vibration 5 - to 10 -fold facilitation of reflex amplitude could be produced; however, after vibration, if all the spindle primary endings had been effectively engaged by the stimulus, no detectable facilitation remained. This test was found to be sensitive and reproducible. An afferent volley containing only activity of tendon organ afferents evoked small-amplitude potentials from the post-sigmoid gyrus of the contralateral pericruciate cortex. The field was highly localized and lay caudal to the main <b>receiving</b> <b>area</b> for activity from the sural nerve and from afferents of hip flexor muscles. Recordings with tungsten micro-electrodes revealed that the surface-evoked activity took origin in cellular discharges in the internal pyramidal layer of area 3 a. Recent psychophysical experiments have provided evidence for a sense of muscle tension, as distinct from a sense of effort, and the tendon organ has been suggested as the likely receptor of origin. Our electrophysiological observations now provide a firm experimental basis for such a proposal...|$|R
50|$|The {{cerebral}} cortex is typically described as comprising three parts: the sensory, motor, and association <b>areas.</b> These <b>sensory</b> <b>areas</b> <b>receive</b> and process {{information from the}} senses. The senses of vision, audition, and touch are served by the primary visual cortex, primary auditory cortex and primary somatosensory cortex. The cerebellar cortex is the thin gray surface layer of the cerebellum, consisting of an outer molecular layer or stratum moleculare, a single layer of Purkinje cells (the ganglionic layer), and an inner granular layer or stratum granulosum. The cortex is the outer surface of the cerebrum and is composed of gray matter.|$|R
50|$|The {{thalamus}} {{has multiple}} functions. It may {{be thought of}} as a kind of hub of information. It is generally believed to act as a relay between different subcortical areas and the cerebral cortex. In particular, every sensory system (with the exception of the olfactory system) includes a thalamic nucleus that <b>receives</b> <b>sensory</b> signals and sends them to the associated primary cortical area. For the visual system, for example, inputs from the retina are sent to the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, which in turn projects to the visual cortex in the occipital lobe. The thalamus is believed to both process sensory information as well as relay it—each of the primary <b>sensory</b> relay <b>areas</b> <b>receives</b> strong feedback connections from the cerebral cortex.Similarly the medial geniculate nucleus acts as a key auditory relay between the inferior colliculus of the midbrain and the primary auditory cortex. The ventral posterior nucleus is a key somatosensory relay, which sends touch and proprioceptive information to the primary somatosensory cortex.|$|R
5|$|The cortex {{is mapped}} by {{divisions}} into about fifty different functional areas known as Brodmann's areas. These areas are distinctly different when seen under a microscope. The cortex {{is divided into}} two main functional areas – a motor cortex and a sensory cortex. The primary <b>sensory</b> <b>areas</b> <b>receive</b> signals from the sensory nerves and tracts by way of relay nuclei in the thalamus. Primary sensory areas include the visual cortex of the occipital lobe, the auditory cortex in parts of the temporal lobe and insular cortex, and the somatosensory cortex in the parietal lobe. The primary motor cortex, which sends axons down to motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord, occupies the rear portion of the frontal lobe, {{directly in front of the}} somatosensory area. The remaining parts of the cortex, are called the association <b>areas.</b> These <b>areas</b> <b>receive</b> input from the sensory areas and lower parts of the brain and are involved in the complex cognitive processes of perception, thought, and decision-making. The main functions of the frontal lobe are to control attention, abstract thinking, behavior, problem solving tasks, and physical reactions and personality. The occipital lobe is the smallest lobe; its main functions are visual reception, visual-spatial processing, movement, and colour recognition. There is a smaller occipital lobule in the lobe known as the cuneus. The temporal lobe controls auditory and visual memories, language, and some hearing and speech.|$|R

40|$|Primary <b>sensory</b> {{cortical}} <b>areas</b> <b>receive</b> {{information through}} multiple thalamic channels. In the rodent whisker system, lemniscal and paralemniscal thalamocortical projections, from the ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPM) and posterior medial nucleus (POm) respectively, carry distinct types of sensory information to cortex. Little {{is known about}} how these separate streams of activity are parsed and integrated within the neocortical microcircuit. We used quantitative laser scanning photostimulation to probe the organization of functional thalamocortical and ascending intracortical projections in the mouse barrel cortex. To map the thalamocortical projections, we recorded from neocortical excitatory neurons while stimulating VPM or POm. Neurons in layers (L) 4, L 5, and L 6 A received dense input from thalamus (L 4, L 5 B, and L 6 A from VPM; and L 5 A from POm), whereas L 2 / 3 neurons rarely received thalamic input. We further mapped the lemniscal and paralemniscal circuits from L 4 and L 5 A to L 2 / 3. Lemniscal L 4 neurons targeted L 3 within a column. Paralemniscal L 5 A neurons targeted a superficial band (thickness, 60 lm) of neurons immediately below L 1, defining a functionally distinct L 2 in the mouse barrel cortex. L 2 neurons received input from lemniscal L 3 cells and paralemniscal L 5 A cells spread over multiple columns. Our data indicate that lemniscal and paralemniscal information is segregated into interdigitated cortical layers...|$|R
