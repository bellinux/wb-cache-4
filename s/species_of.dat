30|$|Some {{reports have}} shown that for single species the {{correlation}} between modulus of elasticity (MOE) and modulus of rupture (MOR) in bending is quite high. Tropical timbers consist <b>of</b> hundreds <b>of</b> <b>species</b> {{that are difficult to}} identify. This report deals with the mechanical stress grading of tropical timber regardless <b>of</b> <b>species.</b> Nine timber <b>species</b> or groups <b>of</b> <b>species</b> with a total number of 1094 pieces measuring 60 × 120 × 3000 [*]mm, were tested in static bending. The MOE was measured flat wise, while MOR was tested edge wise. Statistical analysis of linear regression with a dummy model and analysis of covariance were used to analyze the role of MOE and the effect <b>of</b> <b>species</b> on prediction <b>of</b> MOR. The analysis showed that using MOE as a single predictor caused under/overestimation for one or more <b>species</b> and/or groups <b>of</b> <b>species.</b> The accuracy <b>of</b> prediction would be increased with species identification. An allowable stress and reference resistance for <b>species</b> and/or groups <b>of</b> <b>species</b> were provided to compare with the prediction of strength through timber grading. The timber strength class for <b>species</b> and/or groups <b>of</b> <b>species</b> was also established to support the application of mechanical timber grading.|$|R

5|$|About 17.8 percent——of {{the total}} forested area of Vietnam was sprayed during the war, which {{disrupted}} the ecological equilibrium. The persistent nature of dioxins, erosion caused by loss of tree cover, {{and loss of}} seedling forest stock meant that reforestation was difficult (or impossible) in many areas. Many defoliated forest areas were quickly invaded by aggressive pioneer species (such as bamboo and cogon grass), making forest regeneration difficult and unlikely. Animal-species diversity was also impacted; in one study a Harvard biologist found 24 <b>species</b> <b>of</b> birds and five <b>species</b> <b>of</b> mammals in a sprayed forest, while in two adjacent sections of unsprayed forest there were 145 and 170 <b>species</b> <b>of</b> birds and 30 and 55 <b>species</b> <b>of</b> mammals.|$|E

Additionally, commonly seen species such as the gray jay, American three-toed woodpecker, mountain bluebird, Clark's nutcracker, mountain chickadee and pipit are frequently found in the lower elevations. The white-tailed ptarmigan is a ground bird that is often seen in the alpine zones. Rivers and lakes are frequented by over a hundred different species including loon, heron and mallard which spend their summers in the park.|$|E

40|$|Assessing the <b>species</b> {{diversity}} <b>of</b> {{an urban}} forest {{is important for}} understanding its structure and functions, but {{the result can be}} affected by sampling methods, times, and delimitations of the study area. In this study, we examined the influence of different ways to delimit boundaries of urban areas on the assessment <b>of</b> <b>species</b> diversity <b>of</b> urban forests through a case study conducted in Haikou, China. We surveyed the <b>species</b> diversity <b>of</b> the urban forest in Haikou twice using the same sampling protocol but two commonly used delimitations of the urban area. The two surveys produced significantly different estimates <b>of</b> <b>species</b> richness <b>of</b> the urban forest. Recorded species richness was 228 (144 woody and 84 herbaceous species) and 303 (164 woody and 139 herbaceous species) for the first and the second survey, respectively. The rarefaction analysis indicated that <b>species</b> richness <b>of</b> woody plants recorded in the two surveys could converge by doubling the sample size, but <b>species</b> richness <b>of</b> herbaceous plants was significantly different between the two surveys at the 95 % confidence interval even at three times the original sample size. The value of the Simpson dissimilarity index between the two surveys was 0. 417 and 0. 357 for woody and herbaceous plants respectively, which implied noticeable dissimilarity <b>of</b> <b>species</b> compositions <b>of</b> plant assemblages in the two areas. We concluded that the assessment of biodiversity of an urban forest can be affected significantly by how the boundary of an urban area is defined. Caution should be taken when comparing <b>species</b> diversities <b>of</b> urban forests reported in different studies, especially when richness measures are used...|$|R
