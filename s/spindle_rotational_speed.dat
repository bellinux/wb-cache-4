The key enabling drive technologies for <b>spindle</b> <b>rotational</b> <b>speeds</b> in the 100, 000 rpm range includes electric motors, both AC and DC powered, and air turbines.

40|$|Chatter is a {{major problem}} causing poor surface finish, low {{material}} removal rate, machine tool failure, increased tool wear, excessive noise and thus increased cost for machining applications. Chatter vibrations can be avoided using stability diagrams for which tool point frequency response function (FRF) must be determined accurately. During cutting operations, due to gyroscopic moments, centrifugal forces and thermal expansions bearing dynamics change resulting in tool point FRF variations. In addition, gyroscopic moments on spindle-holder-tool assembly cause separation of modes in tool point FRF into backward and forward modes which will lead to variations in tool point FRF. Therefore, for accurate stability predictions of machining operations, effects of operational conditions on machine tool dynamics should be considered in calculations. In this study, spindle bearing dynamics are identified for various <b>spindle</b> <b>rotational</b> <b>speeds</b> and cutting forces. Then, for a real machining center, tool point FRFs under operating conditions are determined using the identified speed dependent bearing dynamics and the mathematical model proposed. Moreover, effects of gyroscopic moments and bearing dynamics variations on tool point FRF are examined separately. Finally, computationally determined tool point FRFs using revised bearing parameters are verified through chatter tests...|$|R

Used was a tool made from high resistance Sverker 21 steel alloy with a 19 mm diameter cylindrical shoulder and a 6. 4 mm diameter pin that extrudes 2. 7 mm {{from the bottom of}} the shoulder. A large number of welded joints were prepared according to a test matrix of various combinations of <b>rotational</b> <b>speed</b> and feed rate.

For specimens welded at spindle speeds larger than 1400 rpm, microstructural observations revealed the presence of micro cracks and voids located in the zone between the nugget and the thermally affected zone. In order to monitor the effect of lengthy testing times and the observed grain growth associated with slow strain tests, annealing tests under different temperatures and time durations were performed while monitoring grain diameter.

This {{results in the}} requirement of tool stoppage or slowdown during a micro-end-milling operation, a deterrent to productivity and to part acceptability. A circular tool path geometry can avoid discontinuities in the tool movements leading to a more consistent and smooth material removal. However, optimal process planning for such a tool path will require detailed understanding of the chip-formation mechanism in circular end-milling. The cut geometry during end-milling along a circular tool path is often approximated {{as that of a}} linear tool path. Although this assumption works well for circular tool paths with higher tool path radius, {{this is not the case}} for lower tool path radius often used in micro-milling. In this study, the effect of circular tool path on the cutting force for varying tool path rotation angle, tool path radius, and feed rate is experimentally investigated. Systematic signal processing was applied to analyse the measured cutting force signal along linear and several circular tool paths. Qualitative as well as quantitative differences were observed in the cutting force profiles obtained using different tool path radii, tool path orientations, and feed rates. This implies the need for an improved chip thickness formulation dedicated to micro-end-milling with circular tool path rather than approximating it with formulations derived for linear tool path. 9 Authors 2011.

40|$|A new three-color {{infrared}} radiation pyrometer using an optical fiber is developed for measuring cutting temperature in high speed machining by small ball end mill. The high speed air spindle unit is adopted to the ordinary milling machine so that the maximum spindle revolution of 40000 rpm is attainable. The ball radius of the carbide cutter is 3 mm and the side cutting of carbon steel with ballnose is executed without cutting fluid. Cutting temperature distribution along the ball-nosed cutting-edge is measured. The influences of <b>spindle</b> <b>rotational</b> <b>speed,</b> radial depth of cut and feed per tooth on the temperature distribution at the flank face are examined. The maximum temperature of peripheral cutting edge about 700 Â°C is obtained even at the rotation angle of 180 Â° after cutting, and it drops along the ballnose toward the ball tip. Relatively large temperature gradient arises along the ball cutting-edge at higher spindle revolution because cutting speed depends on the local tool radius. Depth of cut and feed per tooth, at the same time, affect the overall temperature at the ball cutting edges. The cooling characteristics in air cutting reveals that the temperature difference during one cycle of intermittent cutting increases as spindle speed decreases. The relationship between the peripheral cutting speed and the tool temperature varies from tool shank to ball tip because the interactions between cutting edge and workpiece change along the ballnose...|$|E

Reinforced cowrap spinning yarns and thermoplastics offer {{a potential for}} low-cost manufacturing of complex-shaped and good, drapable composite parts, due to reduced impregnation times and resin flow distance during processing. In this article, the cowrap spinning yarns were produced by cowrap spinning method with flax and polypropylene (PP) and then woven to fabric preforms. The natural flax fibers were twistless in yarns and preforms, and PP served as a carrier for flax and prevented damage to flax fibers during processing, and became the polymer matrix in the final composites.

40|$|AbstractWire {{electrical}} discharge turning (WEDT) {{is suitable}} for machining of precise cylindrical forms on hard and difficult-to-cut materials. In WEDT electrical discharge takes place between the traveling wire and the rotating workpiece to be machined. However, {{in many cases the}} machining efficiency of WEDT is considered to be rather low. One of the methods to enlarge the application envelope of WEDT and to improve its machining performance on difficult-to-machine materials is introduction of ultrasonic vibration to the wire electrode. An investigation has been made to combine ultrasonic vibration and wire electrical discharge turning. Design of a submerged, precise, flexible and corrosion-resistant rotary spindle is introduced. The spindle was mounted on a five-axis wire EDM machine to rotate the workpiece in order to generate free form cylindrical geometries. An auxiliary device which produces ultrasonic vibration was installed between the two wire-guides. The ultrasonic system consists of an ultrasonic generator, a transducer and a wire holder. When the wire is being driven, the transducer together with the wire holder vibrate under the resonance condition.

40|$|Most drill wear {{monitoring}} {{research found}} in the literature is based on conventional vibration technologies. However, these conventional approaches still have not attracted real interest from manufacturers for multiples of reasons: some of these techniques are not practical and use complicated Tool Condition Monitoring (TCM) systems with less value in industry. In addition, they are also prone to give spurious drill deterioration warnings in industrial environments. Therefore, drills are normally replaced at estimated preset intervals, sometimes long before they are worn or by expertise judgment. Two of the great problems in the implementation of these systems in drilling are: the poor signal-to-noise ratio and the lack of system-made sensors for drilling, as is prevalent in machining operations with straight edge cutters. In order to overcome the noise problems, many researchers recommend advanced and sophisticated signal processing while the work of Rehorn et al. (2005) advises the following possibilities to deal with the lack of commercial system-made sensors: ï· Some research should be directed towards developing some form of instrumented tool for drill operations. ï· Since the use of custom-made sensors is being ignored in drilling operations, effort should be focused on intelligent or innovative use of available sensor technology. It is expected that the latter could minimize implementation problems and allows an optimal drill utilization rate by means of modern and smart sensors. In addition to the accelerometer sensor commonly used in conventional methods, this work has considered two other sensor-based methods to monitor the drill wear indirectly. These methods entail the use of an instrumented drill with strain gauges to measure the torque and the use of an encoder to measure the Instantaneous Angular Speed (IAS). The signals from these sensors were analyzed using signal processing techniques such as, statistical parameters, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and a ii preliminary Time-Frequency (TF) analysis. A preliminary investigation has revealed that the use of a Regression Analysis (RA) based on a higher order polynomial function can very well follow and give prognosis of the development of the monitored parameters. The experimental investigation has revealed that all the above monitoring systems are sensitive to the deterioration of the drill condition. This work is however particularly concerned with the use of IAS on the spindle of the drill, compared to conventional monitoring systems for drill condition monitoring. This comparison reveals that the IAS approach can generate diagnostic information similar to vibration and torque measurements, without some of the instrumentation complications. This similitude seems to be logical, as {{it is well known that}} the increase of friction between the drill and workpiece due to wear increase the torque and consequently it should reduce or at least affect the <b>spindle</b> <b>rotational</b> <b>speed.</b> However, the use of a drill instrumented with a strain gauge is not practical, because of the inconvenience it causes on production machines. By contrast, the IAS could be measured quite easily by means of an encoder, a tachometer or some other smart rotational speed sensors. Thus, one could take advantage of advanced techniques in digital time interval analysis applied to a carrier signal from a multiple pulse per revolution encoder on the rotating shaft, to improve the analysis of chain pulses. As it will be shown in this dissertation, the encoder resolution does not sensibly affect the analysis. Therefore, one can easily replace encoders by any smart transducers that have become more popular in rotating machinery. Consequently, a non-contact transducer for example could effectively be used in on-line drill condition monitoring such as the use of lasers or time passage encoder-based systems. This work has gained from previous research performed in Tool Condition Monitoring TCM, and presents a sensor that is already available in the arsenal of sensors and could be an open door for a practical and reliable sensor in automated drilling. iii In conclusion, this dissertation strives to answer the following question: Which one of these methods could challenge the need from manufacturers by monitoring and diagnosing drill condition in a practical and reliable manner? Past research has sufficiently proved the weakness of conventional technologies in industry despite good results in the laboratory. In addition, delayed diagnosis due to time-consuming data processing is not beneficial for automated drilling, especially when the drill wears rapidly at the end of its life. No advanced signal processing is required for the proposed technique, as satisfactory results are obtained using common time domain signal processing methods. The recommended monitoring choice will definitely depend on the sensor that is practical and reliable in industry.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Brookfield Viscometer is {{described}} {{and its use}} in rheo-logical measurements is analyzed and discussed. The significance of <b>spindle</b> shape and <b>rotational</b> <b>speed</b> for different types of viscoelastic fluids is de-termined. Methods for using this viscometer to obtain {{the greatest amount of}} significant information are def ied. HE BROOKFIELD Synchro-Lectric Viscometer {{is probably one of the}} most T commonly used rotational viscometers. A relatively large number of publica-tions, of which several are pharmaceutical, provide evidence of its use both for industrial plant control and for scientific investigations. It therefore seemed important to the author to make an attempt to find a mathematical background for a correct interpretation of the experimental results obtained with the Viscometer. In addition, a method of measurement for plastic materials was developed for this apparatus which exploits, in a better manner than the methods recommended by the manufacturer and used in the investigations so far published, the possibilities for obtaining information concerning the rheological properties of the material investigated. Because of the shape of those spindles which were specially designed for measurements on plastic materials, it is clear that the Brookfield Viscometer should often be more suitable for such purposes than, for example, concentric cylinder/viscometers or cone and plate viscometers. DESCRIPTION OF THE INSTRUMENT The principle of the Brookfield Viscometer is quite simple. A synchronous motor drives at a constant speed a spindle which is immersed in the material under investigation. The force which is necessary to overcome the resistance of the material to the rotation of the spindle is provided by a calibrated spring, the tension of which is read as a deflection of a pointer over a graduated scale rotating with th...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Dissimilar {{friction}} stir welding {{was carried}} out between AA 6061 -T 6 and AA 7075 -T 6 aluminum alloys. The effect of tool <b>rotational</b> <b>speed</b> and welding speed, on microstructure and mechanical properties were analysed in detail and presented. The tool <b>rotational</b> <b>speed,</b> welding speed, axial load and shoulder diameter to pin diameter (D/d ratio) were the parameters taken into consideration for the study. It was concluded that the tensile strength and hardness value gradually increased {{with the increase in}} tool <b>rotational</b> <b>speed</b> and decreased with the further increase in tool <b>rotational</b> <b>speed.</b> The microstructural analysis was carried out for the high strength specimen at various zones. Fine grain size and proper material mixing were observed in the stir zone. Fractographic image of the fractured surface for the high strength joint was presented and discussed. The joint fabricated with tool <b>rotational</b> <b>speed</b> 1000 RPM, welding speed 25 mm/min, axial load 6 kN and D/d ratio 3 exhibited superior mechanical properties when compared to all other joints...|$|R
