5|$|Akodon caenosus is a rodent in {{the genus}} Akodon found in northwestern Argentina and south-central Bolivia. Since its {{description}} in 1918, {{it has been}} alternatively classified as a separate <b>species</b> <b>or</b> a subspecies of Akodon lutescens (formerly Akodon puer). The species Akodon aliquantulus, described from some very small Argentine specimens in 1999, is now recognized as a synonym of A.caenosus.|$|E

5|$|As {{frigatebirds}} rely {{on large}} marine predators such as tuna for their prey, overfishing threatens to significantly impact on food availability and jeopardise whole populations. As frigatebirds nest in large dense colonies in small areas, they {{are vulnerable to}} local disasters that could wipe out the rare <b>species</b> <b>or</b> significantly impact the widespread ones.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{sometimes}} use plumage {{to assess}} and assert social dominance, to display breeding condition in sexually selected <b>species,</b> <b>or</b> to make threatening displays, as in the sunbittern's mimicry of a large predator to ward off hawks and protect young chicks. Variation in plumage also allows for the identification of birds, particularly between species.|$|E

5|$|Community ecology is {{the study}} of the {{interactions}} among a collections of species that inhabit the same geographic area. Community ecologists study the determinants of patterns and processes for two or more interacting species. Research in community ecology might measure species diversity in grasslands in relation to soil fertility. It might also include the analysis of predator-prey dynamics, competition among similar plant <b>species,</b> <b>or</b> mutualistic interactions between crabs and corals.|$|E

5|$|In {{a general}} sense, the {{principal}} chemical reaction in bioluminescence involves some light-emitting molecule and an enzyme, generally called the luciferin and the luciferase, respectively. Because these are generic names, the luciferins and luciferases are often distinguished by including the <b>species</b> <b>or</b> group, i.e. Firefly luciferin. In all characterized cases, the enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of the luciferin.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{account of}} ant sting fatalities in Australia was first recorded in 1931; two adults and an infant girl from New South Wales died from ant stings, possibly from the jack jumper ant or Myrmecia pyriformis. 30 years later, another fatality {{was reported in}} 1963 in Tasmania. Historical and IgE results have suggested these two <b>species</b> <b>or</b> perhaps another species were responsible for all recorded deaths.|$|E
5|$|The {{protection}} of habitats {{is a necessary}} step in the maintenance of biodiversity because if habitat destruction occurs, the animals and plants reliant on that habitat suffer. Many countries have enacted legislation to protect their wildlife. This may {{take the form of}} the setting up of national parks, forest reserves and wildlife reserves, or it may restrict the activities of humans with the objective of benefiting wildlife. The laws may be designed to protect a particular <b>species</b> <b>or</b> group of <b>species,</b> <b>or</b> the legislation may prohibit such activities as the collecting of bird eggs, the hunting of animals or the removal of plants. A general law on the {{protection of}} habitats may be more difficult to implement than a site specific requirement. A concept introduced in the United States in 1973 involves protecting the critical habitat of endangered species, and a similar concept has been incorporated into some Australian legislation.|$|E

5|$|The two {{proteins}} can later fuse {{together to}} form a single polypeptide. Regardless of which protein comes first, this fusion protein may show similar function. Thus, if a fusion between two proteins occurs twice in evolution (either between paralogues within the same <b>species</b> <b>or</b> between orthologues in different species) but in a different order, the resulting fusion proteins will be related by a circular permutation.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotics are {{not usually}} used for gastroenteritis, {{although}} they are sometimes recommended if symptoms are particularly severe or if a susceptible bacterial cause is isolated or suspected. If antibiotics are to be employed, a macrolide (such as azithromycin) is preferred over a fluoroquinolone due to higher rates {{of resistance to the}} latter. Pseudomembranous colitis, usually caused by antibiotic use, is managed by discontinuing the causative agent and treating it with either metronidazole or vancomycin. Bacteria and protozoans that are amenable to treatment include Shigella Salmonella typhi, and Giardia species. In those with Giardia <b>species</b> <b>or</b> Entamoeba histolytica, tinidazole treatment is recommended and superior to metronidazole. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of antibiotics in young children who have both bloody diarrhea and fever.|$|E
5|$|As {{a center}} for trade and travel between the U.S., the Caribbean, and South America, South Florida is {{especially}} vulnerable to invasive <b>species,</b> <b>or</b> species {{of plants and animals}} that adapt aggressively to conditions in the Everglades, allowing them to reproduce faster and grow larger than they would naturally in their native environments. Approximately 26% of all species of fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals in South Florida are exotic—more than in any other part of the U.S.—and the region hosts one of the highest numbers of exotic plant species in the world. Controlling invasive species in 1,700,000 acres (6,900km2) of infested land in South Florida costs authorities about $500 million a year.|$|E
