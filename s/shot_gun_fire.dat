40|$|Concrete is {{relatively}} weak in tension and may require {{some form of}} reinforcement to cope with tensile forces. Steel reinforcing bar {{is often used to}} cater for tensile and compressive forces. However, current research shows that the use of steel reinforcing bar does not afford concrete protection against impact. Alternatively {{it has been shown that}} where fibres are added to concrete mixes protection is afforded through increased energy absorption. It would appear that the dispersion of fibres throughout a concrete mix affords a degree of toughness between the reinforcement bar spacing. This research investigates the use of Type 1 micro synthetic fibres, Type 2 macro synthetic fibres and steel fibres used as post crack reinforcement in concrete samples when subject to a variety of stress induced states and compares the performance of these fibre mixes to that of a plain concrete mix. The test programme adopted, subjected cube specimens to compressive strength tests, beam samples to both three point flexural bending and single point impact loading, and concrete slab sections to <b>shot</b> <b>gun</b> <b>fire.</b> The parameters investigated under test were: compressive strength, flexural strength, load deflection analysis, energy absorption and impact performance/resistance. Modelling the impact of shot fire on the test specimens was carried out using Finite Element Analysis, to inform slab design. The results of this investigation are of particular significance to the resilience of concrete structures under terrorist attack. The results show that the adoption of Type 2 macro synthetic fibres as concrete post crack reinforcement provide the greatest toughness when compared with the other fibre types and offer the greatest protection from spalling of the back face of the concrete slab, being the main consideration with regard to the performance of the slab on testing with shotgun fire. Damage containment after ballistic testing was also noted where Type 2 fibres were used. The Finite Element Analysis models were successful at predicting the damage recorded to the concrete slabs, when subject to the shotgun fire performance test...|$|E
40|$|Concrete is weak {{in tension}} and {{requires}} {{some form of}} reinforcement. Steel rebar is often used in order to cater for tensile and compressive forces. Millard et al. (2009) suggests that when concrete is subject to blast forces, failure occurs at {{the surface of a}} concrete wall, and the presence of conventional steel reinforcement will generally not prevent the wall from material spalling. An explosion near to a concrete wall causes a high speed pressure wave to load the front face of the wall (Millard et al., 2009). A small proportion of this energy will be reflected back, while a significant proportion of the energy will travel through the wall as a compressive stress wave (Millard et al., 2009). The reflection of the compressive stress wave within the concrete causes a tension rebound from the back face; it is this tension rebound that can cause the back face to spall (Millard et al., 2009). Impact by a high speed point load, such as a bullet, has similarities with a small standoff blast (Millard et al., 2009). Back face spall is an important consideration for protecting the public against fragmentation due to impact on concrete structures and this article investigates fibre concrete performance. Synthetic fibres may offer additional protection with regard to energy absorption; the fibres are dispersed throughout the mix during batching and this can provide additional toughness of the concrete, especially between the rebar spacing. This research investigates the use of Type 1 micro synthetic fibres, Type 2 macro synthetic fibres and steel fibres used as reinforcement in concrete samples when subject to various forces. The purpose of this test programme was to compare each of these fibre types against a plain concrete control sample. The tests subjected the specimens to flexural bending, single point loading impact and <b>shot</b> <b>gun</b> <b>fire.</b> The parameters of the test were: compressive strength, flexural strength including load deflection analysis, energy absorption and impact resistance using a drop hammer, and a shotgun fire performance test. The test specimens were modelled using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in order to predict the damage on the slabs from the shotgun fire performance test and inform the apriori slab design. The overall test programme is displayed in Figure 1. Although many tests were carried out, the shotgun test is the main focus of this article...|$|E

50|$|The {{game has}} {{a total of}} five stages, many of which share design {{similarities}} to Super C (the NES version of Super Contra). The three odd-numbered stages (1, 3, and 5) are played from a side-view perspective, while the two even-numbered ones (2 and 4) are top-view. The soundtrack consists primarily of arranged background music from the original Contra, {{with the exception of a}} few tunes (namely the Area 2 theme, the Stage Select theme, the sub-boss theme in Area 3, and the ending theme). Operation C was the first Contra game to feature auto-fire as a default feature, resulting in the removal of the Machine Gun power-up from previous games. The Laser Rifle is also removed, leaving only the Spread <b>Shot</b> and <b>Fire</b> <b>Gun</b> from Super C. However, the game introduces a new Homing <b>Gun</b> that <b>fires</b> bullets that chase after enemies. The Spread Shot starts out as a three way shot, but it can be upgraded to a five way version after picking it up a second time. Unlike Super C, the <b>Fire</b> <b>Gun</b> does not have chargeable shots, while the Barrier and Rapid Bullets power-ups are not featured in this installment either.|$|R

Using numerically estimated sensitivity kernels for coda waves, separate images of each quality factor were produced. Results appear stable and robust. They show that scattering attenuation prevails over intrinsic attenuation. The scattering pattern shows a strong concordance with the tectonic lineaments in the area, while an area of high total attenuation coincides with the zone {{where most of the}} volcanic activity occurs. Our results provide evidence that the most important attenuation effects in volcanic areas are associated with the presence of geological heterogeneities...|$|R

Before this, their five years plan of 1981-1985 did not offer a solution for the economic problems of resident. During 1981-1991 fifty one Albanian soldiers were unjustly murdered during their service in the Yugoslavian army. The most notable event of the time were the demonstration of 1981, organized in Pristina but who were later followed by massive demonstrations around Kosovo. The city of Podujevo during that time was blocked except Medical Center. The route near the border was blocked and so was the route to Pristina. The police were <b>shot</b> with <b>gun</b> <b>fires</b> while they were driving tanks. [...] Some thousands of people were in prison.During the Serbian Rule, Albanians were organized into several political parties such as “NDSH” or Albanian National Democratic Party, Albanian Youth National Democratic Committee, in The Albanian League [...] and so on. Demonstrations were organized in March 1989 and 1990. During this decade many workers were expelled from their jobs and the funds were stopped for educational institutions. That continued for a while, but Albanians were organized and they offered private funds themselves, in that way the education process did not stop. During 1989-1997, 22 people were killed from this region. These actions motivated the Albanian populations such that they started to mobilize and resolve their disputes. During 1990-1992, 114 blood sheet issues and 60 other disputes were resolved.|$|R
