40|$|This study {{examined}} the hypothesis that numbers of newts captured were correlated with the phase of the moon. During the spring of 2008 <b>smooth</b> <b>newts</b> and great crested newts were captured in bottle traps laid in two ponds at Riseholme Park, University of Lincoln, UK. Highest rates of capture for <b>smooth</b> <b>newts</b> were {{either side of the}} new moon but for great crested newts the highest rate was immediately before the new moon. Identification of individuals showed that during the observation period <b>smooth</b> <b>newts</b> regularly moved between aquatic and terrestrial habitats, but great crested newts appeared to leave ponds and did not return. This is the first report that numbers of newts captured are affected by the lunar cycle. Activity during the darkest nights may limit the risk of predation as individuals leave breeding ponds to forage on land or to move between ponds. These results have implications for surveys of newt breeding sites because lack of individual identification and trapping events at the wrong time of the month can both seriously undermine estimates of population sizes...|$|R
50|$|<b>Smooth</b> <b>newts</b> {{are also}} {{potential}} transmitters of chytrid fungus, because {{a close relative}} of the newt carries this disease. Chytrid fungus has decimated frog populations worldwide, and caused extinctions and widespread declines in Australian frogs.|$|R
25|$|The {{park has}} all major Swedish species of amphibians. Among these species, one can number the common toad, the common frog and the moor frog, {{as well as}} the {{northern}} crested newt and the <b>smooth</b> <b>newt.</b> Among the reptiles, the most common species are two snakes, the common European adder and the grass snake, {{as well as the}} viviparous lizard and the slowworm.|$|E
25|$|Most {{amphibians}} of the Loire {{are found}} in the slow flow areas near the delta, especially in the floodplain, marshes and oxbows. They are dominated by the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra), frogs and toads. The toads include Bufo bufo, Alytes obstetricans, Bombina variegata, Bufo calamita, Pelobates fuscus and Pelobates cultripes. The frogs are represented by the Parsley frog (Pelodites punctatus), European tree frog (Hyla arborea), Common Frog (Rana temporaria), Agile Frog (R. dalmatina), Edible Frog (R. esculenta), Perez's Frog (R. perezi), marsh frog (R. ridubunda) and Pool Frog (R. lessonae). Newts of the Loire include the Marbled Newt (Triturus marmoratus), <b>Smooth</b> <b>Newt</b> (T. vulgaris), Alpine Newt (T. alpestris) and Palmate Newt (T. helveticus).|$|E
25|$|Important {{aspects of}} {{courtship}} displays include male alert posture, approach and pursuit, the marking of the substrate trail, and tail undulations. Once a male has {{the attention of}} the female, he may release pheromones, which are used for individual recognition, mate recognition, and mate choice decisions, and generally increase female receptivity towards the male’s spermatophore and improve his chances of reproductive success with her. In the red-legged salamander (Plethodon shermani), males directly apply pheromones onto the female's nares. In the aquatic <b>smooth</b> <b>newt</b> (Lissotriton vulgaris), the pheromones are delivered indirectly; the male wafts them towards the female with his tail. In some species, {{it has been shown that}} the size a larger, more elaborate male’s tail has played a role in the female’s decision to mate. In the newt species of the Italian crested newt (Triturus carnifex), males that possessed large mid-dorsal body crests were more favorable to the females looking to mate.|$|E
50|$|As {{indicated}} in the foregoing section, while <b>smooth</b> <b>newts</b> are a protected species in Europe, they were declared a 'controlled pest animal' {{in the state of}} Victoria, Australia, in 1997, and prohibited Australia-wide in 2010, due to their invasive potential.|$|R
50|$|There {{is also a}} {{risk that}} <b>smooth</b> <b>newts</b> could poison their predators, like cane toads do. Any native animal that ingests the {{potentially}} deadly skin secretions produced by the newt could be affected, including wading birds, snakes, lizards, turtles, fish and mammals.|$|R
50|$|<b>Smooth</b> <b>newts</b> are generalist {{carnivores}} {{with a broad}} diet including invertebrates, crustaceans, and {{the eggs}} and hatchlings of frogs and fish. Therefore, {{they are likely to}} prey on and compete for food {{with a wide range of}} Australian terrestrial and freshwater species.|$|R
500|$|After {{the common}} frog (Rana temporaria), the edible frog (Pelophylax esculentus) and the <b>smooth</b> <b>newt</b> (Lissotriton vulgaris), the common toad {{is the fourth}} most common {{amphibian}} in Europe. [...] It is found throughout the continent {{with the exception of}} Iceland, the cold northern parts of Scandinavia, Ireland and a number of Mediterranean islands. These include Malta, Crete, Corsica, Sardinia and the Balearic Islands. Its easterly range extends to Irkutsk in Siberia and its southerly range includes parts of northwestern Africa in the northern mountain ranges of Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. A closely related variant lives in eastern Asia including Japan. The common toad is found at altitudes of up to [...] {{in the southern part of}} its range. It is largely found in forested areas with coniferous, deciduous and mixed woodland, especially in wet locations. It also inhabits open countryside, fields, copses, parks and gardens, and often occurs in dry areas well away from standing water.|$|E

40|$|The {{breeding}} population {{sizes of}} newts at Llysdinam Pond in 1981 are estimated at around 800 Palmate and 300 <b>Smooth</b> <b>newts.</b> Females were more numerous than males with sex ration of 3. 0 : 1 for Palamte and 2. 6 : 1 for <b>Smooth</b> <b>newts.</b> The movement of males of both species {{into the pond}} preceded that of females, and female Palmate newts {{moved out of the}} pond significantly later than the other classes. The number of females of both species leaving the pond was much less than the number entering, apparently as a result of mortality whilst in the pond. Females leaving the pond were significantly lighter than those entering, and for female Palmate newts the weight loss in only partly attributable to loss of egg load. Temperature and humidity were important factors influencing the number of newts active during the inward migration period, but had little effect on activity during the outward migration...|$|R

50|$|Adult <b>smooth</b> <b>newts</b> {{emerge from}} {{hibernation}} on land from late February to May, and head towards fresh water to breed. They favour ponds and shallow lakesides over running water. At this time, both sexes become more strikingly and colourfully marked, with vivid spots and orange bellies. The male also develops a wavy crest {{along the back}} and tail - the sexes are clearly different during the breeding season.|$|R

Quarryhouse Moor Ponds, to the north-east of the middle section of the site, is notable as habitat for amphibians including great crested, palmate and <b>smooth</b> <b>newts</b> (Triturus cristatus, T. helveticus and T. vulgaris), the common frog (Rana temporaria) and the common toad (Bufo bufo).|$|R
40|$|Migration {{patterns}} {{across a}} drift fence with pitfall traps were studied between 1997 and 1999 at a breeding pond with populations of great crested newts, Triturus cristatus, and <b>smooth</b> <b>newts,</b> T. vulgaris, at a study site in south-central Sweden. Metamorphs and older newts emigrated from the pond non-randomly {{and seemed to}} avoid exiting where open fields adjoined, but were oriented towards a patch of forest immediately {{to the east of}} the pond. Movement patterns changed slightly over the years, but metamorphs were more dispersed and less concentrated than older newts, and did not choose directions identical to those of older newts. Older great crested and <b>smooth</b> <b>newts</b> showed similar directional orientation. Great crested newt metamorphs dispersed towards both edges of the forest patch, and possible explanations for this are discussed. The results suggest that orientation in relation to cues from the surroundings of a breeding pond may be used by newts to make migratory decisions.
