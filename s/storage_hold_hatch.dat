500|$|Batavier V resumed Rotterdam–London {{passenger}} service {{after her}} release from German control at Zeebrugge. On 16 May 1916, while outbound from London for Rotterdam, Batavier V struck a mine near the north buoy at Inner Gabbard. The mine had been recently planted by the German coastal minelaying submarine [...] According to one witness, the ship's decks were awash within three {{minutes of the}} explosion, which blew the rear cargo <b>hold</b> <b>hatch</b> and sent {{a great deal of}} cargo flying through the air. Batavier V sank within twenty minutes, taking with her three members of the crew and one American passenger.|$|R
50|$|Sophie Theresia {{was built}} in 1911 by Van der Vuijk shipyard, Capelle aan de IJssel, Netherlands. She is 37 m in length overall, with a beam of 6.6 m, and a draught of 2.9 m. The hull was {{constructed}} from riveted steel plates, with wooden decking and ketch rigging. The vessel originally operated out of Katwijk, fishing the North Sea. An engine was fitted in the 1930s. The vessel was refitted for cargo carrying in 1957, with <b>hold</b> <b>hatches</b> widened and a new engine fitted. She was renamed Aaltje en Willem, and carried cargo between the Netherlands and several small North Sea ports.|$|R

50|$|The {{following}} day the weather worsened {{and the ship}} was soon caught in a force 10 storm 240 nmi km south west of Ireland with 35 feet (10 meter) waves ramming her deck. The ship quickly took on water as the <b>hold</b> <b>hatch</b> covers failed. The crew knowing that the ship was taken in water and was in mortal danger quickly radioed a distress signal at 4 PM. The last radio contact was made at 4:30 PM, at this time the ships {{is believed to have}} sunk. Rescuers searched the {{following day}} for any survivors near the last known location of the ship but it was soon clear that the 27 Greek and Filipino crew members had perished.|$|R

50|$|An en primeur wine {{gives the}} owner {{the right to}} receive the {{respective}} bottles of wines once the producer has completed the maturing phase of the wine. Wine bought en primeur is often directly placed into custom-free <b>storage</b> <b>holding,</b> 'in bond'. Known as a delicate method of investment, a purchase may ultimately be deemed a loss, or there may be considerable profit. For example, the 1982 vintage of Château Latour, was sold at £250 a case en primeur in 1983, while valued in 2007 at £9,000, although the major part of this price increase occurred after bottling.|$|R

50|$|The open hatch bulk carrier, often {{referred}} to as OHBC or conbulker, is designed to offer direct access to the <b>hold</b> through <b>hatches</b> which extend the full width of the vessel. As a result, large cargo units can be lowered into place. If it is possible, the <b>holds</b> or <b>hatches</b> are designed around standard cargo unit sizes. Sometimes a gantry crane is fitted. There is special attention for cargo-handling shipping gear. These conbulkers are expensive because there is extra steel necessary to widen the hatches. This is crucial to provide strength. The open hatches are useful for forest products, such as pre-slung timber and logs. The heavy units are more easy to handle than in a conventional bulk carrier. The open hatch bulk carriers {{can also be used to}} carry containers on the outward leg, and dry bulk on the return leg. The first open hatch bulk carrier was built in 1962, for the use of paper trade.|$|R
