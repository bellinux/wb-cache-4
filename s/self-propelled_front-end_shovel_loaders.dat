30|$|The {{geologic}} formations in WV {{consist of}} overburden and {{multiple layers of}} interburden with bituminous coal seams of varying thicknesses interspersed between these layers. Overburden and interburden must be removed before the coal is extracted. In most WV surface coal mines several machines are used to dig and load overburden material. This equipment includes hydraulic and electric (rope) <b>shovels,</b> <b>front-end</b> wheel <b>loaders,</b> and draglines (which are used for stripping and dumping into the excavated area). Depending on {{the thickness of the}} interburden layers, various methods are used for its removal. Layers with a thickness of generally less than 1.5 meter are ripped by a bulldozer. If the rock is ripped, additional equipment is required to load the material. If the interburden is too thick or too hard to rip, drilling and blasting is required to loosen the rock. The process of ripping or blasting continues with each interburden layer that is encountered in the mine.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{shortage}} of labors in Taiwan's livestock farming is an apparent problem now. How to mechanize {{to help the}} daily works in the farm using limited labors becomes a very important issue. Meanwhile, cleaning and managing the livestock's waste take time and {{cost a lot of}} labors. Therefore, the objective of this research is to develop a scraping shovel with movable flanks to replace the traditional shovels attaching on the <b>shovel</b> <b>loaders</b> and it could be used in both livestock and poultry houses. Utilizing this scraper with a <b>shovel</b> <b>loader</b> on cleaning floors in either livestock or poultry houses is able to improve the percentages of cleaning floors as well as to save labors. The direction of this research starts with basic analysis in the prototype of a scraping shovel with movable flanks. To find the geometric relationship of a scraper with movable flanks is able to ensure the functioning of open and close when the size of scraper is increased. A commercially available program of finite element analysis method, ANSYS, was used to analyze the stresses that resulted from the changes of the structures associated with various loads. The load for the scraper with movable flanks was considered to be loaded as the same volume of a traditional shovel carried, 200 kg. The result confirmed the safety of this new scraper. When we increase the volume of the shovel scraper having three bars under the bottom plate, the load goes up to 300 kg. The safe design of plate components holds firmly as well as other components in the scraper with movable flanks. To scale up the model of scraper using the methods developed in the research, thus, is possible. 摘 要 目前臺灣畜牧工作人力短缺，能使用的人力資源有限，所以如何將工作機械化是很重要的課題，而現今處理畜禽舍的排泄物乃是一項既費時且耗費人力的工作。中興大學農機系開發一組改良式蛋雞舍適用之活動鏟斗雛型機，功能佳，但容量小，部份強度不足，因此本研究之目標為改良一套二段式活動鏟斗，替代人力並取代一般傳統的鏟斗，來從事畜禽舍的清潔，以提高清潔率及節省勞力為主要目標，且使用鏟裝車及二段式活動鏟斗，收集動物所產生的糞尿，可以減少直接用水沖洗畜禽舍所耗費寶貴的水資源。 本研究的方向是從二段式活動鏟斗的雛型斗之基礎分析著手，研究二段式鏟斗的幾何關係，得到改變鏟斗尺寸時，其兩臂為了保持正常開合之動作，兩臂製作前所需之步驟，以及使用有限元素法分析軟體ANSYS研究鏟斗負載時，所承受應力之變化。經設計分析結果顯示：當二段式活動鏟斗負載量以傳統工程用鏟斗容量為考量時，在承載量為 200 kg下，其分析結果是合乎安全標準，當鏟斗容量加大，負載達 300 kg時，在鏟斗下方支撐架增加至三支，其分析結果同樣達到安全標準，進而分析二段式活動鏟斗其餘重要部分，分析結果也都符合設計上之要求。依本研究之方法可以將此活動鏟斗尺寸放大，而兼顧運轉之平順性與結構之安全性。目 錄 中文摘要I 英文摘要II 目 錄III 圖目錄VI 表目錄IX 第一章 前言 1 1. 1 畜禽舍糞尿處理之簡介 1 1. 2 畜禽舍糞尿處理之方法 1 1. 3 研究項目 4 1. 4 研究目的 5 第二章 文獻探討 6 2. 1 牛舍清潔的探討 6 2. 1. 1 牛舍環境對牛隻之影響 6 2. 1. 2 牛糞尿之處理方式 7 2. 2 豬舍清潔的探討 8 2. 2. 1 豬舍環境對豬隻之影響 8 2. 2. 2 豬糞尿之處理方式 8 2. 3 雞舍清潔的探討 9 2. 3. 1 雞舍環境對雞隻之影響 9 2. 3. 2 雞糞之處理方式 10 2. 4 畜禽舍產生的糞尿對環境的污染 11 2. 4. 1 畜禽舍產生的糞尿對空氣品質的影響 11 2. 4. 2 畜禽舍產生的糞尿對對水源的影響 12 2. 5 畜禽舍產生的糞尿與有機農業的關係 13 2. 5. 1 何謂有機農業 13 2. 5. 2 畜禽舍產生的糞尿對有機農業的影響 14 2. 6 有限元素法在農業力學方面的應用 17 第三章 實驗原理 19 3. 1 何謂有限元素法 19 3. 2 有限元素法的簡史 19 3. 3 有限元素法和有限差分法之比較 20 3. 4 有限元素法之基本學理 21 3. 5 電腦輔助分析軟體ANSYS之源由 23 3. 6 電腦輔助分析軟體ANSYS之基本架構 24 3. 6. 1 元素、截面及材料的定義 24 3. 6. 2 建構幾何模型 25 3. 6. 3 分割網格 25 3. 6. 4 夾持及負載 25 3. 6. 5 分析 25 3. 6. 6 結果 26 第四章 實驗設備 27 4. 1 山貓牌鏟裝車 27 4. 2 二段式活動鏟斗之雛型斗 28 4. 3 電腦主機 29 4. 4 Working Model軟體 29 4. 5 Auto Cad軟體 30 4. 6 有限元素法軟體ANSYS 30 第五章 實驗步驟 31 5. 1 研究二段式活動鏟斗之幾何關係 31 5. 2 使用有限元素分析軟體ANSYS模擬受力狀況 31 5. 3 建構模組及其邊界條件之設定 32 5. 3. 1 底板模組及其邊界條件 32 5. 3. 2 前刮板模組及其邊界條件 35 5. 3. 3 前刮板及側擋板模組及其邊界條件 37 5. 3. 4 後機箱關節模組及其邊界條件 37 第六章 結果與討論 39 6. 1 二段式活動鏟斗之幾何關係 39 6. 1. 1 測出鏟斗開啟之軌跡 39 6. 1. 2 逆推滑槽型板元件鑿孔所需之不規則曲線 40 6. 1. 3 比對所得結果 42 6. 2 利用ANSYS分析二段式活動鏟斗之應力 44 6. 2. 1 建構鏟斗底板之模組 44 6. 2. 2 鏟斗底板分析結果 47 6. 2. 3 更改底板尺寸之分析 50 6. 2. 4 前刮板之分析 52 6. 2. 5 前刮板與側擋板組合分析 56 6. 2. 6 後機箱關節之分析 58 第七章 結論與建議 68 參考文獻 71 附錄 75 附錄 1 雞糞的平均密度 75 附錄 2 鏟斗前刮板前端點開合的 18 個點座標 76 附錄 3 二段式活動鏟斗零件圖 7...|$|R

Another primary limitation is their dig depth, which {{is limited by}} the length of rope the dragline can utilize. Inherent with their construction, a dragline is most efficient excavating material below the level of their base.

50|$|The main {{difference}} between a swing yarder and a tower yarder is that the upperworks is mounted on a large slewing bearing. This bearing permits the boom and cable system to be 'swung' across a setting without relocating the machine. An experienced operator uses timing and cable tension to swing the grapple to the desired location. In practice, however, the main benefit of a swinging machine is that once the logs are yarded up to the machine, they can be swung {{to the side and}} landed. This allows the machine to be positioned in a small area such as on a road, and to land (set down) the logs on the road behind (or in front of) the machine. By contrast a tower has no options on where to set the logs---so the tower has to be positioned back from the break of the hill so as to leave a landing area on the downhill side of the machine, the logs can only be pulled up to near the tower and then lowered to the ground making it necessary for a <b>shovel</b> (log <b>loader)</b> to also be present to remove the logs once landed. Implicitly a swing machine {{does not need to be}} as tall as a tower machine particularly in steep ground because the swing machine can be set right up to the 'edge' of the steep ground while the tower must be set back from the 'edge' to allow landing space.|$|R
40|$|The Aitik mine is {{the largest}} copper mine in Sweden. In the {{surrounding}} area several minor deposits have been found. If these deposits will be mined the ore can be handled in the concentrator of the Aitik mine, {{which means that the}} ore has to be transported to the Aitik mine. Transportation options of one of these satellite mines, 15 km away from Aitik, are investigated. This is based on a pre-feasibility study provided by Boliden. The transportation scenarios of nearby mines have been analysed in order to find similarities to the satellite mine. The similarities are as follows: the Renstrom mine is located 15 km from the concentrator, the ore of the Aitik mine has the same composition and pit of the Kaunisvaara project is in the same order of magnitude. Selection criteria are listed, involving limitations, environmental issues and economics. The criteria are listed from low influence to high influence: forest, animals, emission, shareholders, employees, transportation costs, profit, maximum weight and fragmentation size. Eight different transportation scenarios are listed based on these similarities and selection criteria. Two of these scenarios are further analysed. In these scenarios the ore is loaded on a mine ruck to the surface and further transported with highway trucks to the concentrator. One of these scenarios involves stockpiling before the ore is brought to the concentrator, this is found to be the best option. In this scenario 11 mine trucks with a payload of 50 tonnes, 16 mine trucks with a payload of 25 tonnes, 3 <b>shovels,</b> 1 wheel <b>loader</b> and 4 highway trucks are needed. The total costs of the mining and the transportation to the concentrator will be 36 SEK/tonnes, which is about 5. 5 USD/tonnes. Further investigation can be done by changing the duration of the project, in order to conclude what this will do to the costs. One can also investigate what will happen when the equipment will break down and what will happen when the equipment will be leased from a contractor. Finally, the mining schedule and the amount of equipment need to be geared to each other. Resources EngineeringGeoscience & EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|In 2001, the Catholic University of Chile {{undertook}} a maintenance benchmarking study of six open pit copper mines having mill capacities varying between 18, 000 t/d and 156, 000 t/d, and collectively responsible for 58 % of Chilean copper production. Key performance indices {{were selected to}} measure the effectiveness, efficiency, {{and development of the}} maintenance process. Key effectiveness indices used in the mining industry are equipment availability, reliability, and maintainability and safety indices. Reliability is often measured by mean time between failures (MTBF) and maintainability as the mean time to repair or restore service (MTTR). At the time of undertaking the benchmarking study (2001), only two of the six participating mines routinely measured these parameters. For this reason, the study focused on comparing fleet availabilities. Accident rate and accident severity (expressed as the number of lost time incidents and lost time hours per million man hours, respectively) were solicited for all permanent and contracted maintenance personnel. Financial data provided by the participating companies included total annual maintenance and mining costs, as well as a breakdown of labour, materials, and contractor costs. This data, when combined with ore and waste production data, enabled the unit costs of maintenance to be calculated. Internal efficiency indicators were solicited for: * the percentage of planned maintenance (preventive, predictive, and programmed major component replacement) carried out on each equipment fleet (blasthole drills, hydraulic and cable <b>shovels,</b> wheel <b>loaders,</b> haul trucks, and auxiliary equipment); * scheduled maintenance compliance (actual planned hours versus scheduled planned hours); * organizational efficiency in terms of the ratio of supervisors to maintenance technicians; * investment in maintenance planning as evident from the ratio of planners to maintenance technicians (planning clerks and statisticians were also considered to be maintenance planners); and * efficiency in inventory practices as evident from the stores turnover ratio and service level. Development indices were solicited for the educational level of maintenance employees and the level of commitment to maintenance training by both the companies and their collaborators, in terms of annual training hours and investment per employee. The principal conclusions of the study were as follows: * For the six open pit mines that participated in the study, maintenance costs were found to average 44 % of mining costs. This highlights the importance of the direct cost of maintenance to the financial performance of mines. * Percentage planned maintenance of equipment fleets were low by world standards, averaging 35 %, 56 %, and 44 %, respectively, for blasthole drill, shovel, and haul truck fleets. * Fleet availabilities were significantly influenced by the percentage of planned maintenance achieved. For example, haul truck fleet availabilities were found to increase on average by 1 % for every 4 % increase in planned maintenance over the range examined. * Maintenance cost per equipment was found to decrease non-linearly with increases in percentage planned maintenance. An empirical relationship was determined {{that can be used to}} estimate potential cost savings as a result of improved planned maintenance practices (see figure). * The ratio of maintenance planning staff to maintenance technicians varied between 1 : 10 and 1 : 24, indicating improvement opportunities for some of the participating companies. Investment in technical training (including planned maintenance practice) was found to be low by global industry standards. It was concluded that fleet availability and maintenance costs in Chilean open pit operations could be considerably improved by improving and/or developing maintenance planning standards, and training personnel in planned maintenance technique...|$|R
