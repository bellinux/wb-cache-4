30|$|According to the {{structure}} of the drill tool, the interaction between the drill tool and lunar regolith simulant is divided into four parts: <b>cuttings</b> <b>screw</b> conveying, chip extruding, chip bulldozing, and in situ simulant cutting. Considering the boundary condition and simulant density difference among these four parts, a drill-simulant interaction model is developed to predict the drilling load during simulant drilling, based on the screw conveying and the passive earth pressure theory.|$|R
30|$|Drilling and coring, as {{effective}} ways to obtain lunar regolith along the longitudinal direction, are widely applied in the lunar sampling field. Conventionally, modeling of drill-soil interaction was divided into soil <b>cutting</b> and <b>screw</b> conveyance processes, ignoring the differences in soil mechanical properties between them. To improve the modeling accuracy, a hypothesis that divides the drill-soil interaction into four parts: <b>cuttings</b> <b>screw</b> conveyance, <b>cuttings</b> extruding, cuttings bulldozing, and in situ simulant cutting, is proposed to establish a novel model based on the passive earth pressure theory. An iterative numerical calculation method is developed to predict the drilling loads. A drilling and coring testbed is developed to conduct experimental tests. Drilling experiments indicate that the drilling loads calculated by the proposed model match well the experimental results. The proposed research provides the instructions to adopt a suitable drilling strategy to match the rotary and penetrating motions, to increase the safety and reliability of drilling control in lunar sampling missions.|$|R

50|$|And, in effect, eighty-three almost noseless black brachycephalic Deltas were cold-pressing. The fifty-six four-spindle {{chucking}} {{and turning}} machines were being manipulated by fifty-six aquiline and ginger Gammas. One hundred and seven heat-conditioned Epsilon Senegalese {{were working in}} the foundry. Thirty-three Delta females, long-headed, sandy, with narrow pelvises, and all within 20 millimetres of 1 metre 69 centimetres tall, were <b>cutting</b> <b>screws.</b> In the assembling room, the dynamos were being put together by two sets of Gamma-Plus dwarfs. The two low work-tables faced one another; between them crawled the conveyor with its load of separate parts; forty-seven blonde heads were confronted by forty-seven brown ones. Forty-seven snubs by forty-seven hooks; forty-seven receding by forty-seven prognathous chins. The completed mechanisms were inspected by eighteen identical curly auburn girls in Gamma green, packed in crates by thirty-four short-legged, left-handed male Delta-Minuses, and loaded into waiting trucks and lorries by sixty-three blue-eyed, flaxen and freckled Epsilon Semi-Morons.|$|R
50|$|Metalworking taps {{and dies}} were often made by their users during the 18th and 19th centuries (especially if the user was skilled in toolmaking), using such tools as lathes and files for the shaping, and the smithy for {{hardening}} and tempering. Thus builders of, for example, locomotives, firearms, or textile machinery {{were likely to}} make their own taps and dies. During the 19th century the machining industries evolved greatly, and the practice of buying taps and dies from suppliers specializing in them gradually supplanted most such in-house work. Joseph Clement was one such early vendor of taps and dies, starting in 1828. With the introduction of more advanced milling practice in the 1860s and 1870s, tasks such as cutting a tap's flutes with a hand file became a thing of the past. In the early 20th century, thread-grinding practice went through significant evolution, further advancing {{the state of the art}} (and applied science) of <b>cutting</b> <b>screw</b> threads, including those of taps and dies.|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the prevalence and characteristics of deliberate self-harm in a Swedish University population. Method: A random sample of first year students at University of Kalmar was invited to participate in an Internet-based survey in the autumn of 2007. A total of 139 (53, 1 %) completed the anonymous survey. Results: The results showed that 25, 2 % (n= 35) of the students reported having engaged in some kind of deliberate self-harm at least once, and deliberate self-harm was endorsed by 7, 9 % within the past year. The most frequently procedures to self-harm were to tear, carve or pinch <b>self,</b> <b>cutting</b> skin and hitting self on purpose. 37, 1 % reported that they had told no one about their self-injurious behaviors and 36, 4 % significantly reported that they had no one they trusted and who they could talk to if they were concerned about something. Students with self-injurious behavior were also more likely to report a history of emotional, sexual and/or physical abuse, alcohol and drug use, cut classes and questioning their sexual orientation. Conclusions: Findings suggest that self-harm is associated with risk factors and that self-injury is not only associated with adolescence but also with adulthood. It is therefore important to continue studies in both populations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Deliberate self harm is {{major public}} health problem, in {{particular}} among young people. Although {{several studies have}} addressed the prevalence of deliberate self harm among {{young people in the}} community, {{little is known about the}} extent to which deliberate self harm comes to the attention of medical services, the self harm methods used and the underlying motives. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of deliberate self harm in adolescents and the methods, motives and help seeking behaviour associated with this behaviour. Methods A cross-sectional survey using an anonymous self-report questionnaire was administered in 39 schools in the Southern area of the Health Service Executive, Ireland. Of the 4, 583 adolescents aged 15 – 17 years who were invited to participate in the survey, 3, 881 adolescents took part (response: 85 %). Results A lifetime history of DSH was reported by 9. 1 % (n = 333) of the adolescents. DSH was more common among females (13. 9 %) than males (4. 3 %). <b>Self</b> <b>cutting</b> (66. 0 %) and overdose (35. 2 %) were the most common DSH methods. A minority of participants accessed medical services after engaging in DSH (15. 3 %). Conclusion DSH is a significant problem in Irish adolescents and the vast majority do not come to the attention of health services. Innovative solutions for prevention and intervention are required to tackle DSH in adolescents. </p...|$|R
40|$|Pear {{trees on}} their own roots are tested in {{comparison}} to grafted trees in growth and yield characteristics and with special regard to the tolerance to diseases, above all fire blight (Erwinia amylovora). In spring 2004 15 randomized trees of the cultivar 'Williams' from three variants (self rooted in vitro, <b>self</b> rooted long <b>cuttings,</b> grafted on Quince A) were planted in a pear orchard, which was heavily infected with fire blight (Erwinia amylovora) the previous years.

After four years the in vitro self rooted trees were significantly more vigorous in growth than those grafted on quince A. The <b>self</b> rooted long <b>cuttings</b> were comparable in growth with grafts on quince, but showed high tree losses probably due to frost damages in the first winter one year after planting.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to examine the {{correlation}} between the chosen position of screws and the complications observed in patients who underwent locked plating of proximal humeral fractures. We evaluated radiographs of 367 patients treated by locked-plating for proximal humeral fractures. Radiographs were taken at one day, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after surgery, and were analyzed for secondary fracture displacement, loss of fixation, <b>cutting</b> out of <b>screws</b> and necrosis of the humeral head. Secondary loss of fixation occurred in 58 cases (15. 8 %) and among those <b>cutting</b> out of <b>screws</b> was observed in 25 cases (6. 8 %). In cases of secondary loss of fixation a mean of 6. 7 screws were used to fix the fracture (vs 6. 6, P= 0. 425). There was neither significant correlation between position of screws and the occurrence of postoperative loss of fixation in Spearman correlation nor relationship from backward logistic regression analysis. Loss of fixation following locked plating of proximal humeral fractures does not relate to the number of screws and their positions in the humeral head. In consequence, anatomic fracture reduction and restoration of the humeral head-shaft angle are still important factors and should not be disregarded...|$|R
