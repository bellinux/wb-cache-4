500|$|... "West Coast" [...] {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from contemporary music critics. Michael Nelson of Stereogum commented, [...] "This {{is just a}} haunting, hypnotic piece of music that sends chills {{up and down my}} entire skeleton, especially when the tempo shifts downward on the chorus". Nylon writer Liza Darwin deemed the track [...] "silky-smooth" [...] and [...] "total ear candy". Lauren Valenti of Marie Claire lauded the song as [...] "a slice of retro heaven". The track was noted by Stern to be [...] "revolutionary" [...] {{in the sense that it}} sounded [...] "entirely different from anything being offered in pop music at the moment" [...] and deemed it [...] "the very antithesis of everything radio in 2014". Kyle Fowle of The A.V. Club named [...] "West Coast" [...] as the album's most accomplished track and [...] "the one song on Ultraviolence that gets the formula of Lana Del Rey right". AltSounds deemed the track as one of Del Rey's best works and one of the best singles released in 2014. The publication went on to opine, [...] "when songs defy descriptions, and artists defy expectation, they tend to stick around long after the 'pop hits' and divas have <b>suck</b> <b>back</b> into obscurity". Oyster journalist Jerico Mandybur commented, [...] "there's no denying that the song has excellent aural pulling power, especially if you like your odes to LA mysterious, darkly surfy and dripping in femme fatale".|$|E
6000|$|Sandra Wentworth Williams {{certainly}} woke {{to find a}} copy of Donne's poems {{upon her}} dressing-table. And the book would be stood on the shelf in the English country house where Sally Duggan's Life of Father Damien in verse would join it one of these days. There were ten or twelve little volumes already. Strolling in at dusk, Sandra would open the books and her eyes would brighten (but not at the print), and subsiding into the arm-chair she would <b>suck</b> <b>back</b> again {{the soul of the}} moment; or, for sometimes she was restless, would pull out book after book and swing across the whole space of her life like an acrobat from bar to bar. She had had her moments. Meanwhile, the great clock on the landing ticked and Sandra would hear time accumulating, and ask herself, [...] "What for? What for?" ...|$|E
50|$|Social {{attitudes towards}} {{spitting}} have changed greatly in Western Europe since the Middle Ages. Then, frequent spitting {{was part of}} everyday life, and {{at all levels of}} society it was thought ill-mannered to <b>suck</b> <b>back</b> saliva to avoid spitting. By the early 1700s, spitting had become seen as something which should be concealed, and by 1859 many viewed spitting on the floor or street as vulgar, especially in mixed company. Spittoons were used openly during the 19th century to provide an acceptable outlet for spitters. Spittoons became far less common after the influenza epidemic of 1918, and their use has since virtually disappeared, though each justice of the Supreme Court of the United States continues to be provided with a personal cuspidor.|$|E

5000|$|The CDC has {{acknowledged}} that {{the most widely used}} jet injector in the world, the Ped-O-Jet, <b>sucked</b> fluid <b>back</b> into the gun. [...] "After injections, they CDC observed fluid remaining on the Ped-O-Jet nozzle being <b>sucked</b> <b>back</b> into the device upon its cocking and refilling for the next injection (beyond the reach of alcohol swabbing or acetone swabbing)," [...] stated Dr. Bruce Weniger.|$|R
50|$|Fluid suck-back is the {{undesirable}} phenomenon when blood, present {{upon the}} nozzle {{of the jet}} injector, is <b>sucked</b> <b>back</b> into the injector orifice, contaminating the next dose to be fired.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} 2 ̆ 2 {{regularly}} spaced twisted tape 2 ̆ 2 on heat transfer of high Prandtl number fluid flow was investigated using Large Eddy Simulation. This tape has {{a pair of}} a swirl region with twisted tape and an intermittent region with tape-connecting rod. In each swirl region, there is a gap between inner pipe wall and twisted tape. It was found that appropriate width gap can generate the <b>suck</b> <b>back</b> in the gap. The mixing of near gap region is enhanced and the local Nusselt number near the gap becomes high. Consequently, the mixing of whole fluid can be further promoted in the intermittent region...|$|E
40|$|Poets may {{describe}} {{the context in}} which they create poetry. They may use context as a means of saying something else. The sea is calm to-night. The tide is full, the moon lies fair Upon the straits,- on the French coast, the light Gleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand, Glimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay. Come to the window, sweet is the night-air! Only, from the long line of spray Where the sea meets the moon-blanch’d sand, Listen! You hear the grating roar Of pebbles which the waves <b>suck</b> <b>back,</b> and fling, At their return, up the high strand, Begin, and cease, and then again begin, With tremulous cadence slow, and bring The eternal note of sadness in. Sophocles long ago Heard it on the Aegean, and it brought Into his mind the turbid ebb and flow Of human misery; we Find also in the sound a thought, Hearing it by this distant northern sea. Physical context The sea of Faith Was once, too, at the full, and round earth’s shore Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furl’d. But now I only hear Its melancholy, long, withdrawing roar, Retreating, to the breath Of the night-wind, down the vast edges drear And naked shingles of the world...|$|E
5000|$|A devil {{wearing a}} black diaper using the Axe Gitaroo. He is the first Gravillian to fight U-1. He warps the reality in U-1's room, but is <b>sucked</b> <b>back</b> into his own portal in the end.|$|R
60|$|Just then Sherburn {{steps out}} {{on to the}} roof of his little front porch, with a double-barrel gun in his hand, and takes his stand, {{perfectly}} ca'm and deliberate, not saying a word. The racket stopped, and the wave <b>sucked</b> <b>back.</b>|$|R
50|$|The fourth WildCats {{series has}} shown Cole to {{be a man}} who has {{attempted}} to change himself, but keeps getting <b>sucked</b> <b>back</b> into the hero lifestyle. He appears to be an employee of Hadrian as a core member of the new WildCats team that he is assembling.|$|R
25|$|The AISE valves were {{developed}} to prevent solids being <b>sucked</b> <b>back</b> into the air lines when individual downcomers become blocked. Solids depositing in the air lines and their build {{up in the air}} distributor decreases flotation performance as it prevents air from being efficiently entrained in the downcomers.|$|R
50|$|Erica {{works as}} a {{physicist}} along with Phil Seleski at Edgewater Nuclear Plant during the original near-explosion incident. The same accident that gives Phil Seleski his powers also grants Erica powers. Later, when Seleski accidentally destroys Earth and sends himself back in time, Erica is <b>sucked</b> <b>back</b> with him.|$|R
50|$|The company {{installed}} a very complete electrical transmission plant and the ore was hoisted up an inclined tramway {{to the top}} of the hill by means of motors; the dust was <b>sucked</b> <b>back</b> from the chambers, a Roots blower was operated, the furnace was rabbled, and the ore conveyed.|$|R
50|$|Mercury bubblers {{are largely}} similar in {{construction}} to oil bubblers. They {{usually have a}} longer body to prevent mercury from splashing out through the bubbler outlet, and the inlet connection usually has a sintered glass disc to prevent mercury from being <b>sucked</b> <b>back</b> into the inert gas system when refilling an evacuated vessel.|$|R
5000|$|Stone Monster Army - The Stone Monster Army is a {{group of}} rock monsters that are reanimated by the Cloud of Monstrox's {{lightning}} even after being re-petrified by normal attacks. When a combo attack defeats the Stone Monsters, they are destroyed with the animating energies <b>sucked</b> <b>back</b> into the Cloud of Monstrox.|$|R
5000|$|One {{condition}} {{to watch out}} for is the formation of a short circuit in propeller discharge race. If part of the discharge race is <b>sucked</b> <b>back</b> into the propeller, efficiency decreases sharply. This could occur due to a trial that is performed in too shallow water or too close to a wall.|$|R
5000|$|During Eric's {{time with}} the Defenders, he helped confront a host of demons, {{including}} Balthazar, who {{had taken over the}} form of an Air Force commander. The Defenders almost died when Balthazar convinced innocent Air Force pilots that they were spies. Though his demon compatriots were eventually <b>sucked</b> <b>back</b> to their own realm, Balthazar somehow stayed on Earth.|$|R
25|$|Assuming that Apatosaurus, like dinosaurs' nearest {{surviving}} relatives crocodilians and birds, did {{not have}} a diaphragm, the dead-space volume of a 30-ton specimen would be about 184 liters. This is the total volume of the mouth, trachea and air tubes. If the animal exhales less than this, stale air is not expelled and is <b>sucked</b> <b>back</b> into the lungs on the following inhalation.|$|R
50|$|A {{special case}} {{of this is the}} {{formation}} of small droplets when water is dripping from a faucet/tap. When a segment of water begins to separate from the faucet, a neck is formed and then stretched. If the diameter of the faucet is big enough, the neck doesn't get <b>sucked</b> <b>back</b> in, and it undergoes a Plateau-Rayleigh instability and collapses into a small droplet.|$|R
50|$|Hermaphroditic; 'Corella willmeriana' breeds {{throughout}} the year. The eggs are fertilized in the atrial chamber, where they develop into the free-swimming tadpole stage before released. Swimming larvae remain juveniles for <2 days before anterior adhesive organs allow for attachment to substratum. This triggers metamorphism, which entails enlargement of pharynx for filter feeding; the notochord is <b>sucked</b> <b>back</b> into body {{and is no}} longer present in adult form.|$|R
50|$|The {{remaining}} zombies {{return to}} the house, where Zoe is alone. Remembering the zombies only attack when they sense fear, Zoe invites the zombies in, and they become docile. Zoe discovers a mirror on the basement door, tricks the zombies into entering the basement, and they go berserk. After they consume each other, their remains are <b>sucked</b> <b>back</b> into the television, and Zombie Blood Nightmare finally ends.|$|R
60|$|In height he was {{not above}} the middle size, {{but he had a}} very muscular and well-knit frame. Just as he drew near, Gaff, who was bearing a little boy through the surf in his arms, was hurled against the stones of the pier, {{rendered}} insensible, and <b>sucked</b> <b>back</b> by the retreating water. Billy was farther out at the moment, and did not see what had occurred.|$|R
5000|$|An {{expansion}} tank {{is also used}} in the cooling system of most internal combustion engines, to allow the coolant, the antifreeze, and {{the air in the}} system to expand with rising temperature and pressure. The tank is also called a [...] "coolant recovery tank", since it prevents venting and permanent loss of coolant, by allowing it to be <b>sucked</b> <b>back</b> into the cooling system as the engine cools.|$|R
2500|$|The Daleks {{reject the}} Cybermen's {{proposal}} for an alliance {{to conquer the}} universe and the Ark is opened, releasing millions of Daleks to wage all-out war against the Cybermen across the planet. Ultimately, both armies are <b>sucked</b> <b>back</b> into the Void due to {{the actions of the}} Tenth Doctor. However, Sec is seen activating an [...] "emergency temporal shift" [...] before being sucked in. The following series reveals that Caan, Thay and Jast were also able to escape in the same fashion.|$|R
50|$|In the museum, a {{fight between}} the harpy and Jason, and a {{struggle}} between Celestia and Vorian occurs—upon their arrival, the professor is killed by a ball of fire. Jason breaks the glass of a sword display, and takes one of the two. With it he slays the queen and Vorian, who both are <b>sucked</b> <b>back</b> in time. Celestia and Jason exit the museum arm in arm. Ted observes Jason's destruction and yells for answers. Giving up, Ted heads out of frame, and the story ends.|$|R
5000|$|Kovel also advises {{political}} parties attempting to [...] "democratize the state" [...] {{that there should}} be [...] "dialogue but no compromise" [...] with established {{political parties}}, and that there must be [...] "a continual association of electoral work with movement work" [...] to avoid [...] "being <b>sucked</b> <b>back</b> into the system". Such parties, he believes, should focus on [...] "the local rungs of the political system" [...] first, before running national campaigns that [...] "challenge the existing system by the elementary means of exposing its broken promises".|$|R
5000|$|Nicknamed [...] "The Leopard," [...] Jero {{worked for}} his father's {{mattress}} store in X-City until he joined Team Shark Tooth. When Gabu {{gave him an}} MTB that has a motor engine, he didn't use it until Gabu {{took control of the}} bike. After that and being defeated by Sho, he quit the Shark Tooth team. He later ended up under the control of Team X and Idaten Battled Sho on Earth and was defeated again. He was <b>sucked</b> <b>back</b> into the X-Zone for his failure.|$|R
5000|$|The {{resurrection of}} the series was both a {{critical}} and commercial success. Entertainment Weekly was quoted praising that [...] "creator Whedon effectively <b>sucks</b> devotees <b>back</b> into his Hellmouth." ...|$|R
50|$|The first {{tethered}} {{hover flight}} {{took place on}} 9 January 1963. There were initial problems with hot gas reingestion where hot exhaust gasses are <b>sucked</b> <b>back</b> into the intakes causing poor airflow through the engines and loss of thrust. The suction effect of the exhaust on the ground (which made a higher engine power needed) and problems with control systems caused further difficulties. After modifications, the first untethered vertical flight was made on 23 June 1963, followed by the first full {{transition to horizontal flight}} on 16 September 1963.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Work {{mechanism}} of jam jar jet. (b) Mixture {{of air and}} fuel vapors could ignite using external igniter or by residual free radicals from last work cycle. (a) The previous jet expelled more air than conform to equilibrium pressure in chamber, thus some of the fresh air is <b>sucked</b> <b>back.</b> The pressure drop {{in this case is}} caused more by cooling of the gas in chamber than by gas inertia. Gas inertia can not be used well in this design because of lack of exhaust (resonator) pipe and very dissipative aerodynamics of the aperture.|$|R
5000|$|In the Jonny Quest comic, #10, March 1987: [...] "Winters of Discontent", Jonny and Hadji are accidentally <b>sucked</b> <b>back</b> in {{time and}} meet Richard III, {{only to find the}} princes are not locked in the tower (they adore their uncle), that Richard, not deformed, is loved by the people, {{and that there is a}} plot by Henry to usurp Richard and launch a smear {{campaign}} to legitimize his own claim to the throne. The theme is that history is written by the winners and that the truth will out.|$|R
6000|$|There was a {{grinding}} and splintering of planks, {{as the men}} rushed forward, and then a wave swept over the vessel, carrying all on deck before it into the cove beyond the rock, rolling {{them over and over}} up a sandy shore behind. Some managed to dig their hands and feet into the sand and to scramble out; more were <b>sucked</b> <b>back</b> again by the receding waters. As Wulf found himself in the water he felt his arm clutched, and Osgod shouted in his ear: [...] "Do not struggle, I can keep you up!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Dor. Thou hast dared To tell me, what I durst {{not tell}} myself: I durst {{not think that}} I was spurned, and live; And live to hear it boasted to my face. All my long avarice of honour lost, Heaped up in youth, and hoarded up for age! Has honour's {{fountain}} then <b>sucked</b> <b>back</b> the stream? He has; and hooting boys may dry-shod pass, And gather pebbles from the naked ford.-- Give me my love, my honour; give them back-- Give me revenge, while I have breath to ask it! ...|$|R
50|$|A team of six men, {{nicknamed the}} Big Six, from No. 1 Parachute Training School {{was formed in}} 1961 at the school's base which {{at that time was}} RAF Abingdon. The Big Six were the first to jump from large {{military}} aircraft such as the Beverley - a feat previously thought impossible on the premise that anybody trying to exit from the ramp would be <b>sucked</b> <b>back</b> by the air turbulence. A popular attraction at air displays, the team was doubled in size and in 1965 was adopted by the RAF as their official display team, and named The Falcons.|$|R
