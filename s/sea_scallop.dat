40|$|The {{process of}} {{removing}} adductor muscles (meat) through manual shucking of Iceland <b>scallops</b> and <b>sea</b> <b>scallops</b> at <b>sea</b> results in loss of meat {{yield to the}} fishing industry. In the study of Iceland scallops, this loss was negatively correlated with shell size and decreased from about 30 % at 60 mm (shell height) to 11 % at 90 mm, with an average loss of 23 %. Meat recovery was somewhat more efficient from <b>sea</b> <b>scallops,</b> but paradoxically the loss in yield increased slightly with shell size from 8 % at 60 mm to 10 % at 90 mm.

50|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>scallops</b> {{typically}} {{occur at}} depths ranging from 18-110 m, {{but may also}} occur in waters as shallow as 2 m in estuaries and embayments along the Maine coast and in Canada. In southern areas, scallops are primarily found at depths between 45 and 75 m, and are less common in shallower water (25-45 m) due to high temperature. Although <b>sea</b> <b>scallops</b> are not common at depths greater than about 110 m, some populations have been found as deep as 384 m, and deep-water populations at 170-180 m {{have been reported in}} the Gulf of Maine. <b>Sea</b> <b>scallops</b> often occur in aggregations called beds. Beds may be sporadic (perhaps lasting for a few years) or essentially permanent (e.g., commercial beds supporting the Georges Bank fishery). The highest concentration of many permanent beds appears to correspond to areas of suitable temperatures, food availability, substrate, and where physical oceanographic features such as fronts and gyres may keep larval stages in the vicinity of the spawning population.|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{is an independent}} review of the activities and findings of the 50 th Northeast Regional Stock Assessment Review Committee Meeting (SARC 50), held June 1 - 5, 2010 at the Northeast Fisheries Science Center in Woods Hole Massachusetts.

The survey did not catch many fish, the landings were subject to large errors and assumptions, the catch was not well sampled for many years, and there were serious aging problems which cause large uncertainties in the growth model. Second, the model {{does not appear to}} be performing well. The model predicts monkfish increases in the past 7 years or so in both management regions, and there is no indication of the population increasing in the raw survey or length frequency data.

50|$|On {{the east}} coast of the United States, over the last 100 years, the populations of bay {{scallops}} have greatly diminished due to several factors, but probably is mostly due to reduction in sea grasses (to which bay scallop spat attach) caused by increased coastal development and concomitant nutrient runoff. Another possible factor is reduction of sharks from overfishing. A variety of sharks used to feed on rays, which are a main predator of bay scallops. With the shark population reduced - this apex predator in some places almost eliminated - the rays have been free to feed on scallops to the point of greatly decreasing their numbers.By contrast, the Atlantic <b>sea</b> <b>scallop</b> (Placopecten magellanicus) is at historically high levels of abundance after recovery from overfishing.|$|E

40|$|Poor {{growth and}} {{survival}} of scallops is often reported during early developmental stages. Stage- and species-specific dietary requirements have been identified, but the mechanisms responsible for these differences remain largely unknown. Dietary success depends on food biochemical properties, digestive and/or assimilative capacity, {{as well as the}} animal's specific nutritional demands, which can vary over development and between species. The present study examines developmental changes in the activities of key digestive enzymes in larval and postlarval bay scallops Argopecten irradians and <b>sea</b> <b>scallops</b> Placopecten magellanicus raised on a mixed algal diet until 4 to 5 mm in shell height (SH) and sampled at intervals encompassing major transitions in feeding organ development. Colorimetric assays measured general protease, lipase (esterase) and carbohydrase (3 ̆b 1 -amylase, cellulase and laminarinase) activities. The most pronounced changes in enzymatic activity occurred prior to scallops attaining 1. 2 mm SH in both scallop species. The esterase:protease ratio exhibited similar ontogenetic patterns in both scallop species, decreasing sharply between larval and immediate postlarval stages before increasing to an intermediate level and stabilizing around 1. 2 mm SH. In contrast, mean carbohydrase activities measured over the experimental duration differed between species, with bay scallops exhibiting higher specific activities of 3 ̆b 1 -amylase and cellulase but much lower activities of laminarinase than <b>sea</b> <b>scallops.</b> These findings have implications for understanding scallop utilization of the food supply in nature, as well as developing targeted diets that could enhance their {{growth and survival}} in culture.
