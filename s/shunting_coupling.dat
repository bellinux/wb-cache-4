50|$|Once it {{had been}} {{demonstrated}} that the employment of low power Class I locomotives was economical, the project team developed a standard, small locomotive (Einheitskleinlokomotive) for the DRG. This was heavily based on the latest delivery from Gmeinder. As a result, the entire locomotive, apart from the diesel engine, was standardised. The footplate on the locomotives was open at the sides and all controls were duplicated {{on both sides of}} the engine. The Kleinlokomotiven had buffers and a very simple <b>shunting</b> <b>coupling,</b> that could be automatically coupled and then released using a foot pedal. Transmission was achieved from the engine using simple roller chains on both axles.|$|E
50|$|The same {{sequence}} in reverse order is effected for loading, {{with the side}} slots being replaced by the retaining pins on the wagon.In the unloading cycle, the side slots of the corner fitting are as an achievement of the VIT project also partly funded by the European Union.Operating under the catenary, though disconnected during the operation for safety reasons, Metrocargo eliminates the cost and time associated with <b>shunting</b> (<b>coupling</b> and decoupling wagons, transfer to marshalling yards by diesel locos, train breakdown and composition) {{that take place in}} traditional terminals, where trains need to be removed from the electrified line for unloading. Metrocargo was originally developed as a technical means necessary for creating a network for the intermodal transport of containers and swap bodies, distributed over a territory. In the process, it proved to be very fast (projections show a 40 wagon train can be unloaded and reloaded in less than one hour), which opened up new business possibilities, typically shuttling load units between ports and dry-ports. The construction technology being modular, equipment can be planned according to available space and number of containers to be handled, and increased as necessary. Today the system is fitted with a stand-alone active safety system detecting human presence in the work area, (which means that sound alarms {{do not have to be}} used). This system has been developed within the VIT project.Metrocargo is perfectly consistent with the goal of minimising environmental impact, because both atmospheric and acoustic pollution are almost totally eliminated by the electrically powered automation system. There are no local GHG emissions other than by trucks servicing the terminal, and noise level is very low.Electro-mechanical parts and plant automation software for load/unload were subjected to an exhaustive stress test under the control of an independent entity with specific knowledge of automated plants: Functionality and performance of all components were analysed and data collected and validated. The two main applications of Metrocargo are distributed intermodality and Port to dry-port shuttling.|$|E

A novel electrical circuit layout is addressed, {{based on the}} use of two negative capacitances.

Then, the article focuses on the comparison of a simple resistive shunt, enhanced by a pair of negative capacitances, with a classical resonant shunt. It is shown that the newly proposed enhanced resistive shunt can show equivalent performances in terms of vibration attenuation than the resonant shunt, with at the same time an increased robustness to frequency detuning, in the case of mono-modal damping.

30|$|Overall, Baervelt eyes {{appear to}} {{experience}} more complications {{than the other}} treatment groups. Specifically, both the ABC and ABV studies found more complications associated with Baerveldt than Ahmed eyes [15 – 18]. Iverson et al. found similar complication rates between Baerveldts and trabeculectomies specifically in uveitic eyes, which echoed the findings in the TVT study. However, the TVT study was a relatively smaller study (n[*]=[*] 76), {{and it did not}} include uveitic eyes [14, 24]. In our study, we observed a pattern of Baerveldt eyes experiencing greater early and late number of complications, with a trend towards significance. They tended to have more persistent hypotony in the late postoperative period. This could be related to the lack of a valve along with the larger drainage plate size of Baerveldts, leading to overfiltration. However, there have been mixed results on whether a robust correlation between end plate size and IOP reduction exists [22, 30 – 33]. While we were concerned that this tendency for hypotony with Baerveldt <b>shunts</b> <b>coupled</b> with postoperative ciliary body shutdown in uveitic glaucoma would produce worse outcomes, the vast majority of failures overall were still due to high IOP; only one failure was attributed to persistent hypotony, which was in a Baerveldt eye.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} bafilomycin A 1, a blocker of V-type H +-ATPases, were {{investigated}} in Malpighian tubules of Aedes aegypti. Bafilomycin A 1 reduced rates of transepithelial fluid secretion and the virtual short-circuit current (vIsc) with an IC 50 of approximately 5 µmol l− 1. As vIsc decreased, the electrical resistance increased {{across the whole}} epithelium and across the apical membrane, indicating effects on electroconductive pathways. Bafilomycin A 1 had no effect when applied from the tubule lumen, pointing to the relative impermeability of the apical membrane to bafilomycin A 1. Thus, bafilomycin A 1 must take a cytoplasmic route to its blocking site in the proton channel of the H +-ATPase located in the apical membrane of principal cells. The inhibitory effects of bafilomycin A 1 were qualitatively {{similar to those of}} dinitrophenol in that voltages across the epithelium (Vt), the basolateral membrane (Vbl) and the apical membrane (Va) depolarized towards zero in parallel. Moreover, Vbl always tracked Va, indicating electrical coupling between the two membranes through the <b>shunt.</b> Electrical <b>coupling</b> allows the H + Summary-ATPase to energize not only the apical membrane, but also the basolateral membrane.

An array of such nonlinear resonators can be considered a scalable superconducting quantum simulator for a Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian.

Methods and Results-A 3 -dimensional computational model of hybrid palliation {{was developed by the}} finite volume method, along with models of the Norwood operation with a modified Blalock-Tausig or right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt. Hybrid circulation was modeled with a 7 -mm ductal stent and bilateral pulmonary artery banding to a 2 -mm diameter. A 3. 5 -mm conduit was used in the Blalock-Tausig shunt model, whereas a 5 -mm conduit was used in the right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery <b>shunt</b> model. <b>Coupled</b> to all the models was an identical hydraulic network that described the entire circulatory system based on pre-stage 2 hemodynamics. This clinically validated multiscale approach predicts flow dynamics, as well as global cardiac output, mixed venous oxygen saturation, and systemic and cerebral oxygen delivery.

40|$|AbstractStructural {{control for}} civil {{structures}} was {{born out of}} a need to provide safer and more efficient designs with the reality of limited resources. The purpose of structural control is to absorb and to reflect the energy introduced by dynamic loads such as winds, waves, earthquakes, and traffic. Today, the protection of civil structures from severe dynamic loading is typically achieved by allowing the structures to be damaged. Semi-active control devices, also called “smart” control devices, assume the positive aspects of both the passive and active control devices. A semi-active control strategy is similar to the active control strategy. Only here, the control actuator does not directly apply force to the structure, but instead it is used to control the properties of a passive energy device, a controllable passive damper. Semi-active control strategies can be used in many of the same civil applications as passive and active control. One method of operating smart cable dampers is in a purely passive capacity, supplying the dampers with constant optimal voltage. The advantages to this strategy are the relative simplicity of implementing the control strategy as compared to a smart or active control strategy and that the dampers are more easily optimally tuned in- place, eliminating the need to have passive dampers with unique optimal damping coefficients. This research investigated semi-active control of civil structures for natural hazard mitigation. The research has two components, the seismic protection of buildings and the mitigation of wind-induced vibration in structures. An ideal semi-active motion equation of a composite beam that consists of a cantilever beam bonded with a PZT patch using Hamilton's principle and Galerkin's method was treated.
