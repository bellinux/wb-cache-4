5|$|September 16, 1999 — Hurricane Floyd {{produces}} rainfall up to 13inches (325mm) {{and wind}} gusts {{of up to}} 60mph (95km/h) affect Southeastern New York. Severe flooding results from the storm, killing two people and causing an early estimate of $14.6million (1997USD, $18million 2007USD), although it is reported that damage could total to far more than that. One of the deaths occurred when a person was <b>swept</b> <b>into</b> a flooded river.|$|E

5|$|In 1700 Sweden was {{attacked}} {{by a coalition of}} Saxony, Russia, and Denmark–Norway. Saxony, under Augustus II, invaded Swedish oversea dominions in Livonia and quickly attacked the city of Riga. Meanwhile, Frederick IV of Denmark attacked the Swedish allied duchies of Holstein and Gottorp in order to secure his rear, before commencing with the planned invasion of Scania, which had been previously annexed by Sweden in the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658. A short time later, Russia under Peter I <b>swept</b> <b>into</b> Swedish Ingria and besieged the strategic city of Narva. Unprepared for these developments, the Swedes were forced into a war on three fronts.|$|E
5|$|Due to flooding, troops {{evacuated}} {{dozens of}} communities along the Gulf coast. Many desert communities {{throughout the state}} were left without any telephone or electrical service; wood, tarpaper, and cardboard were all scattered. Dozens of scores of huts were destroyed. Many humans were <b>swept</b> <b>into</b> the gulf. Sixteen people died inside {{the remains of a}} building. Moreover, the Piojillo river overflowed its banks, killing many people and resulting in considerable damage. Elsewhere, destruction was reported in San Jose del Cabo, Cabo San Lucas, San Lucas, and Puntas Arena; Pichilinague also received moderate damage. However, there are no known reports of any casualties in all four of those places. Hurricane Liza was also one of six hurricane to directly impact Los Cabos.|$|E
5|$|Late in the night, Thảo and Phát {{met with}} Kỳ {{in a meeting}} {{organized}} by the Americans, and insisted that Khanh be removed from power. The coup collapsed when, between midnight and dawn, anti-coup forces <b>swept</b> <b>into</b> the city; it was generally thought that the rebels did not {{put up a fight}} after being assured that Khánh would be ousted. Early in the morning, Thi, who gained the support of Kỳ, proposed a motion within the junta to remove Khánh and force him into exile, and the final vote was unanimous—Khanh was absent from the meeting. Kỳ, Thi and Thiệu then became the key figures in a junta that continued with Sửu and Prime Minister Phan Huy Quát as a civilian front, although General Minh became the nominal commander-in-chief of the armed forces.|$|E

5|$|On December29, Alibera began {{a steady}} track to the {{southwest}} after the ridge weakened, and briefly deteriorated to minimal tropical storm status. However, it re-intensified to just shy of tropical cyclone status on January1. Shortly thereafter, Alibera made landfall north of Mananjary in southeastern Madagascar, at 3 a.m. local time on New Year's Day, with 10‑minute winds of 115km/h (70mph). The storm quickly weakened over land, but again restrengthened upon reaching the Mozambique Channel on January3. This was short-lived, as Alibera weakened back to tropical depression status by January5. The storm moved to the southeast, turned {{to the southwest}}, and finally back to the southeast before dissipating on January7, having been <b>swept</b> <b>into</b> the westerlies.|$|E
5|$|The {{asteroid}} belt formed from the primordial solar nebula {{as a group}} of planetesimals. Planetesimals are the smaller precursors of the protoplanets. Between Mars and Jupiter, however, gravitational perturbations from Jupiter imbued the protoplanets with too much orbital energy for them to accrete into a planet. Collisions became too violent, and instead of fusing together, the planetesimals and most of the protoplanets shattered. As a result, 99.9% of the {{asteroid belt}}'s original mass was lost in the first 100 million years of the Solar System's history. Some fragments eventually found their way into the inner Solar System, leading to meteorite impacts with the inner planets. Asteroid orbits continue to be appreciably perturbed whenever their period of revolution about the Sun forms an orbital resonance with Jupiter. At these orbital distances, a Kirkwood gap occurs as they are <b>swept</b> <b>into</b> other orbits.|$|E
5|$|Waves between 5 and 13feet (1.5–4meters) were {{reported}} along the East Coast of the United States from Florida to Maryland. A weather buoy in Outer Banks, North Carolina reported swells up to 10feet (3meters). One death occurred by drowning in New Jersey. A 37‑year‑old man {{was reported missing}} in New York City and presumed dead after his houseboat capsized in the heavy surf. Another houseboat also capsized, drowning a 58‑year‑old woman. On shore, a large wave swept two fishermen into the sea, where they drowned. Overall, four fatalities occurred {{in the state of}} New York. In Rhode Island two teenagers were rescued by the United States Coast Guard after being <b>swept</b> <b>into</b> the water by the waves.|$|E

5|$|Antiochus VII Sidetes (r.138–129BC), {{a brother}} of Demetrius, assumed the Seleucid throne and married the latter's wife Cleopatra Thea. After {{defeating}} Diodotus Tryphon, Antiochus initiated a campaign in 130BC to retake Mesopotamia, {{now under the}} rule of Phraates II of Parthia (r.c.138–128BC). The Parthian general Indates was defeated along the Great Zab, followed by a local uprising where the Parthian governor of Babylonia was killed. Antiochus conquered Babylonia and occupied Susa, where he minted coins. After advancing his army into Media, the Parthians pushed for peace, which Antiochus refused to accept unless the Arsacids relinquished all lands to him except Parthia proper, paid heavy tribute, and released Demetrius from captivity. Arsaces released Demetrius and sent him to Syria, but refused the other demands. By spring 129BC, the Medes were in open revolt against Antiochus, whose army had exhausted the resources of the countryside during winter. While attempting to put down the revolts, the main Parthian force <b>swept</b> <b>into</b> the region and killed Antiochus in battle. His body was sent back to Syria in a silver coffin; his son Seleucus was made a Parthian hostage and a daughter joined Phraates' harem.|$|E
5|$|Early in its duration, Lili caused {{flooding}} in Central America that left thousands homeless and killed 14people. Damage was heaviest in Cuba, mostly {{due to the}} hurricane's heavy rainfall which totaled 29.41in (747mm). The hurricane affected 11Cuban provinces, damaging 92,542houses and destroying another 6,369. The rains heavily damaged the sugar cane and banana crops, and overall damage in the country was estimated at $362million (1996USD). After 269,995people were evacuated in advance of Lili, there were no deaths in the country. In nearby Florida, one person died after being <b>swept</b> <b>into</b> a drain during the storm's heavy rains. Moisture from Lili also fueled a storm that struck the northeastern United States, which contributed indirectly to a death when a man in Maine tried driving across a flooded roadway. Damage in the Bahamas was not severe, limited to some damaged roofs and downed trees. When the remnants of Lili struck Ireland and the United Kingdom, it produced strong winds and high seas that damaged hundreds of houses, causing $300million in damage (1996USD) and six deaths.|$|E
5|$|Effects from Helene in South Carolina {{were less}} severe than in North Carolina. Helene made its closest {{approach}} to the state on September27, 85mi (135km). In Charleston, sustained winds reached 63mph (101km/h) and there was minor damage reported Trees and street signs were blown down, and beach houses suffered shingle damage. Sporadic and small power outages occurred throughout the city. Damage became progressively worse from Georgetown to Little River, with automobile accidents, torn roofs, and damaged piers. On Harbor Island, 50percent of structure {{were reported to have}} roof damage, causing and estimated $125,000in damages. Elsewhere along the South Carolina coast, beach erosion occurred due to the strong waves, and sections of pier were <b>swept</b> <b>into</b> sea. In Windy Hill and Cherry Grove Beach, three fishing piers were damaged. Damage was minor in Myrtle Beach, and was limited to roof and window damage. Further inland, in Columbia, damage was minimal, with no rainfall reported. Light damage to crops was reported inland, particularly in Marion County. Across the state, damages were estimated at $200,000from the hurricane, though this did not include beach erosion or damage to sand dunes.|$|E

5|$|In Clear Lake City, heavy {{rainfall}} collapsed {{a portion of}} a grocery store roof, killing two workers. The precipitation caused moderate flooding across eastern portions of Harris County; over 400homes and 40businesses were flooded. Flooding across the Greater Houston area briefly halted the METRORail and closed several state roads. One person drowned after driving into a retention pond. Several people required rescue assistance, and in Comal County a car accident caused three fatalities. The passage of the storm temporarily left about 20,000electrical customers without power, though most outages were quickly restored. In San Antonio, one body was recovered from a creek and another died after driving into a flooded road and was <b>swept</b> <b>into</b> a drainage ditch in which four others survived. In Sisterdale, two people were killed when they were swept away stalled over Sister Creek. In Taylor County, near Abilene, flooding killed one person and forced the evacuation of about 2,000people. Damage in Texas totaled over $45million (2007USD).|$|E
5|$|In England {{he met the}} King {{on several}} {{occasions}} and dined {{with a number of}} influential British politicians, including William Pitt, Charles James Fox and Edmund Burke. Metternich was nominated the new Minister Plenipotentiary to the Austrian Netherlands and left England in September 1794. Unfortunately, he found an exiled and powerless government in headlong retreat from the latest French advance. In October a revitalised French army <b>swept</b> <b>into</b> Germany and annexed all of the Metternich estates except Königswart. Disappointed, and affected by strong criticism of his father's policies, he joined his parents in Vienna in November. On 27 September 1795 he married Countess Eleonore von Kaunitz, a granddaughter of former Austrian chancellor Wenzel Kaunitz. The marriage was arranged by Metternich's mother and introduced him to Viennese society. This was undoubtedly part of the motivation for Metternich, who demonstrated less affection for her than she for him. Two conditions were imposed by the father of the bride, Prince Kaunitz: first, the still youthful Eleonore was to continue to live at home; and second, Metternich was forbidden from serving as a diplomat as long as the Prince was still alive. Their daughter Maria was born in January 1797.|$|E
5|$|In the 1830s, the Whigs {{split from}} the Democratic-Republicans in {{response}} to national policies. The Whigs held a strong majority in the General Assembly in that decade. In 1843, {{the remnants of the}} old slavery party had strengthened into the Democratic Party and <b>swept</b> <b>into</b> power, the Whigs never regained their majority and the Democrats maintained power until the middle of the American Civil War. In 1836 the General Assembly passed the Mammoth Internal Improvement Act and set plans into motion to modernize the state's infrastructure. The wilderness of northern and central Indiana was slowly developed as the General Assembly approved the construction of roads, canals, railroads, and numerous other infrastructure projects. This led the state to near bankruptcy in the late 1830s, but it was avoided when the General Assembly spun off the failing canals, and half of their debts, to private companies in 1841. The failure of the projects was the main factor in the Whig's loss of power.|$|E

5|$|Most of the storm's {{effects were}} felt in Florida where it made {{landfall}} {{on the morning}} of June 18, causing gales, heavy rains, flooding, beach erosion and tornadoes. The highest winds were recorded at 41mph (66km/h) and up to 48mph (77km/h) during a thunderstorm at Macdill Air Force Base in Tampa on June 18. Rainfall peaked at 10.72inches (272.28mm) in Desoto City, while {{much of the rest of}} the state reported between 15inches (25125inches) of precipitation. High tides and waves caused flooding and beach erosion from Naples to the Tampa Bay area. Some waterfront buildings suffered damage from undermining including widespread damage of marinas and some boats. Several bulkheads and rock revetments experienced minor damage in Naples and Marco Island. Several man‑made dune structures seaward of the Coastal Construction Control Line in Collier County received minor damage at Vanderbilt Beach and Marco Island. Three people were killed in Florida in association with the subtropical storm with a further thirteen people injured. A Brevard County woman died when a canoe overturned and an Orange County child was killed when he was <b>swept</b> <b>into</b> a drainage ditch. 130 families were evacuated a few days after the storm from the Arcadia River area because the Peace River crested above flood stage.|$|E
5|$|On the Texas coast, Arlene {{produced}} a small storm surge peaking at 4 ft (1.2 m) in some areas, breaching sections of Padre Island and causing flooding. The storm tide also eroded up to a foot (0.3 m) of sand from beaches {{in the lower}} Texas coast. Combined with the heavy rainfall associated with Arlene, the storm surge produced significant tidal flooding in some coastal stretches. Beach erosion occurred {{as far north as}} Galveston Bay, where tides were reported to be as high as 5 ft (1.5 m). A woman was <b>swept</b> <b>into</b> the sea off a jetty near Freeport and required rescue by United States Coast Guard. Over the waters of Lake Corpus Christi, a large funnel cloud was reported but never touched down or caused any damage. Nearby, the John F. Kennedy Memorial Causeway was completely inundated {{with the exception of one}} lane, prompting an extensive study of possible solutions to raising the causeway nearly two years later.|$|E
5|$|The {{heavy rains}} caused {{two people to}} drown in Charlotte. A girl drowned after being <b>swept</b> <b>into</b> a creek, and a woman drowned while in her car. Also in North Carolina, {{tropical}} rains related to Danny caused a CSX train to derail from its trestle into Little Sugar Creek, spilling about 2,500 gallons (9,500L) of diesel and therefore forcing a nearby public housing development to be evacuated. Sustained tropical-storm force winds affected Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket Island, and parts of Cape Cod, {{in addition to the}} coastal waters from the entrance of Buzzards Bay to the south and east of Cape Cod. Only minor damage occurred, despite these strong winds, which were experienced primarily in southeastern Massachusetts. The minor damage included localized flooding, power outages, downed tree limbs, and lost boats. A suspension of ferry service to Nantucket Island occurred for most of July 25, with a shorter suspension happening on the service to Martha's Vineyard. No significant coastal flooding affected the region, although a storm shelter was opened on Nantucket Island to host a Boy Scout group camping there. Danny was the fifth tropical cyclone to affect Southern New England in the 20th century during the month of July.|$|E
