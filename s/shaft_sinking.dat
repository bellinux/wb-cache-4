5|$|On October 1, 2010, MTA {{awarded a}} $431 million {{contract}} to SSK Constructors (a joint venture) for the mining of the tunnels connecting the 72nd Street station {{to the existing}} 63rd Street station, and for the excavation and heavy civil structures of the 72nd Street Station. Construction was to be done through two shafts at 69th and 72nd Streets, {{the locations of the}} future entrances; <b>shaft</b> <b>sinking</b> work was started in late 2010. Projected completion of the contract was estimated at November 2013. The rock around the area is mostly Manhattan schist, and was generally considered to be a stable location for blasting, so blasting for the station commenced on January 18, 2011.|$|E

60|$|Now Firby-Smith {{not only}} possessed rather {{prominent}} teeth; {{he was also}} sensitive on the subject. Mike's <b>shaft</b> <b>sank</b> in deeply. The fact that emotion caused him to swipe at a straight half-volley, miss it, and be bowled next ball made the wound rankle.|$|R
60|$|By and by {{he turned}} and watched Harry, who had not struck once yet. He stood upon a ledge, alert, strung-up, and steady-eyed, but {{absolutely}} motionless, with the long spear running up above his shoulder. At last, however, he drove his right arm down and the beautiful, straight <b>shaft</b> <b>sank</b> into the pool. It stopped suddenly for a second, quivering, and then bent and twisted upward in the boy's clenched hands.|$|R
50|$|Near {{the west}} end of the mastaba, an {{isolated}} vertical <b>shaft</b> <b>sinks</b> 21 metres down to the underground grave chambers. These are oriented to the south and divided into three levels. The top level contains two main passages which lead to several rooms and magazines. The west passage divides into two and ends in stairs which descend to the other two levels and lead to unfinished passages. The actual grave chamber had already been plundered when it was discovered.|$|R

50|$|RJR's {{dominant}} {{feature is the}} 152 m Storstupet ("Big Shaft"). All of the water falls down a parallel shaft only a few metres away. The Ulvgangen ("Wolf Walk") traverses across the cascades {{at the mouth of}} this wet shaft to the dry Storstupet. A pulldown descent of Storstupet is complicated by its low angle (about 80 degrees), and many teams prefer to detackle this pitch from above. Halfway down Storstupet is a window connecting back with the wet shaft, so descending cavers can enjoy all of the sound and fury of the wet shaft in relative comfort. All of the water from the parallel <b>shaft</b> <b>sinks</b> into the floor at its bottom, and is not seen again in the cave.|$|R
50|$|The son of E. Scharpwinkel, Heinrich Heitkamp, {{assumed the}} {{management}} of the still young construction company and expanded the field of activity by, amongst others, entering the mining business which was the characteristic industry in the Ruhr area at the time.In the following decades, the construction activities were expanded beyond the limits of Herne: Civil engineering, track and infrastructure construction as well as mining services became the main pillar of the company.At that time the projects included, for example, the new construction of the Herne railway station, the construction of the Chemische Werke Hüls in Marl, earthwork, canal and regulation work for the Emschergenossenschaft and the Lippeverband, the beginning of motorway constructions as well as numerous <b>shafting</b> <b>sinking</b> activities for regional coal mines (Shamrock Mine, Unser Fritz Mine and others).|$|R

40|$|Tutorialpg. 179 - 194 The {{basics of}} {{tilting pad bearing}} design are {{discussed}} to include limits of operation for load, speed, and metal temperature. Optimum temperature sensor locations are recommended for self-aligning and nonaligning tilting pads. Tilting pad bearing geometric properties and their influence on bearing and rotordynamics are addressed including {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of zero preloaded pads. Also, the advantages of increasing the pad axial length are shown. Example calculations are presented for the tilting pad pivot film thickness which is necessary to determine if the top pads are loaded or unloaded. Tilting pad static <b>shaft</b> <b>sink</b> and clearance measurement techniques are addressed. The equations to calculate normal force and break away torque are derived including an example calculation comparing a tilting pad bearing to a two axial groove bearing. Tilting pad bearing oil flow and temperature rise are included along with a discussion of reduced temperature tilting pad designs...|$|R

50|$|Old Boston The Old Boston Pit began winding coal in 1868 {{and closed}} in 1952. On 29 June 1900, eight workers {{were killed when}} pockets of gas were {{encountered}} while <b>shaft</b> <b>sinking.</b> The deepest of its three shafts reached 476 yards. The pit closed after an underground fire in 1952. From 1953 until 1989 the pit-head buildings were used as the Area Training Centre for miners.|$|E
50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1889 by Emerson Muschamp Bainbridge, a Northumberland born mine owner, who secured a lease from the Duke of Portland for land at Bolsover in Derbyshire and started <b>shaft</b> <b>sinking</b> to reach the coal in 1891. The {{general manager of the}} company at this time was John Plowright Houfton, who was knighted for his work for the local {{community}} in 1929.|$|E
50|$|<b>Shaft</b> <b>sinking</b> at Peelwood {{began in}} 1878 and the {{colliery}} opened in 1883. The colliery, {{owned by the}} Tyldesley Coal Company, was situated {{to the east of}} Shakerley Lane {{on the south side of}} the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway's Manchester to Southport line and where the company had a siding. A fault caused the company to sink another shaft, the Daisy Pit, to win coal from seams close to the surface.|$|E

5000|$|The Hamstead Colliery Company {{was formed}} in April 1875. It {{acquired}} land {{in an area of}} Staffordshire, on what is now the north west border of Birmingham, from G.C. Calthorpe of nearby Perry Hall, and in 1876 <b>sank</b> <b>shafts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Dalton Main Collieries Limited {{became a}} public company which was floated on the London Stock Exchange in December 1899. The purpose of the company was to buy out the {{business}} of Roundwood Colliery, purchase land at Silverwood, between Thrybergh and Ravenfield, and sink a new deep colliery there. These installations were {{to be connected to}} a boat staithe on the River Don by a railway. The first <b>shaft</b> commenced <b>sinking</b> in 1900 and coal was being worked by 1904.|$|R
50|$|The {{colliery}} {{was originally}} opened as Arael Griffin {{on the site}} of an earlier balance shaft which had been sunk in 1863 by Thomas Phillips Price at Hafod Van. In 1892 John Lancaster and Co. began sinking two 352 yd shafts {{on the opposite side of}} the Ebbw Fach River. On 9 February 1895 four men lost their lives during the <b>shaft</b> <b>sinking,</b> when the boat in which they were riding capsized, and they fell to the shaft bottom.|$|E
50|$|The {{early years}} were {{characterized}} by the struggle to develop the lead-zinc ore bodies, including the need to finance drilling, metallurgical test work and <b>shaft</b> <b>sinking,</b> and there was significant doubt that Miles' discovery would ever amount to much. However, {{by the end of}} 1928, the drilling had allowed an estimate of reserves of 21.2 million tons, which were at the time the largest in Australian history, and rose to an estimate of 32 million tons in 1930.|$|E

50|$|With {{the failure}} of Stuart's Pit all the plant from this mine was {{relocated}} to the Raspberry Gully mine. By July 1876 the railway line had reached the boundary of the mine. The Borehole seam had finally been struck at the Raspberry Gully mine but had also been proven to be too thin, with the seam being only 0.838m thick at the <b>shafts.</b> During <b>sinking</b> a 3.2m thick seam of coal had been struck {{at a depth of}} 81.3m, a decision was made to work this seam which as known as the Gully Seam instead.|$|R
60|$|Winter in {{the upper}} heights of the Bear Tooth Range is a {{glittering}} desolation of snow with a flaming blue sky above. Nothing moves, nothing utters a sound, save the cony {{at the mouth of}} the spiral <b>shaft,</b> which <b>sinks</b> to his deeply buried den in the rocks. The peaks are like marble domes, set high in the pathway of the sun by day and thrust amid the stars by night. The firs seem hopeless under their ever-increasing burdens. The streams are silenced--only the wind is abroad in the waste, the tireless, pitiless wind, fanged like ingratitude, insatiate as fire.|$|R
50|$|Brotherhood left Chippenham in 1868 and was {{appointed}} {{general manager of}} the Bute Ironworks in Cardiff.

50|$|In 1907, the Butte Miners' Union {{had decided}} to {{increase}} wages to $4.00 per day, and $4.50 per day for <b>shaft</b> <b>sinking.</b> Previously, the union {{had been able to}} inform the management of its demands, and, for the most part, the union got what it wanted. But this time, the company pushed back. Instead of a raise, the company offered a sliding scale based on the price of copper. The agreement was not popular with the membership, so the local leadership simply did not put it to a vote.|$|E
50|$|The shaft liner {{does not}} reach {{right to the}} bottom of the shaft during sinking, but lags behind by a fixed {{distance}}. This distance is determined by the methodology of excavation and the design thickness of the permanent liner. To ensure the safety of persons working on the shaft bottom temporary ground support is installed, usually consisting of welded mesh and rock bolts. The installation of the temporary ground support (called bolting) is among the most physically challenging parts of the <b>shaft</b> <b>sinking</b> cycle as bolts must be installed using pneumatic powered rock drills.|$|E
5000|$|Five {{coal mines}} were opened {{after the first}} <b>shaft</b> <b>sinking</b> {{commenced}} in 1920. The coal mines were at Clipstone (coal won 1922), Ollerton (1925), Blidworth (1926), Bilsthorpe (1927) and Thoresby near Edwinstowe (1928). The landowners auctioned or leased their mineral rights: Earl Manvers' Thoresby estate in May 1919 and Lord Savile of Rufford Abbey's lease for Ollerton in 1921. Colliery companies such as the Butterley Company at Ollerton and the Stanton Company at Thoresby bought the rights. The companies financed the construction of pit villages to house the miners and their families, who migrated from older coalfields throughout Britain.|$|E
5000|$|In January 1916, the 173rd Tunnelling Company {{moved to}} the Hulluch-Loos area.

The English penetrated the castle courtyards at night without resistance.|$|R
50|$|Copper was {{discovered}} on Virgin Gorda. Local legends also suggest the shafts were dug by Spanish adventurers to mine {{silver in the}} late fifteenth century, but no documentary evidence can be found to support this theory, and no firm evidence of Spanish occupation of the islands prior to the Dutch settlement exists, much less the size of settlement which {{would be needed to}} <b>sink</b> <b>shafts.</b>|$|R
