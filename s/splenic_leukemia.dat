40|$|In the {{preceding}} paper (1), we reported the clonal isolation and characterization of two replication-defective spleen focus-forming viruses: SFFVA, present in stocks of the anemia-inducing isolate of Friend leukemia virus complex (FV-A) and SFFVp, {{present in the}} polycythemia-inducing isolate of Friend leukemia virus complex (FV-P). These studies indicated that SFFVA and SFFVe can be distinguished by biological and molecular criteria and that, at least in adult mice, the type of erythroleukemic transformation induced by these defective SFFV appears to be independent of whether the helper virus was derived from FV-A or FV-P. These findings, however, do {{not rule out the}} possibility that the replication-competent type C viruses, F-MuLVA and F-MuLVp, present in FV-A and FV-P, respectively, are leukemogenic under certain circumstances. Indeed, other reports have demonstrated that infection of fetal liver cells in culture with an anemia-inducing strain of Friend leukemia virus leads to the generation of permanent cell lines (2), and that injection of newborn BALB/c or NIH Swiss mice with F-MuLVA is characterized by a <b>splenic</b> <b>leukemia</b> and anemia (3, 4). We report here characterization of the cell populations observed in the leukemic spleens of newborn BALB/c mice infected with either cloned F-MuLVA or F-MuLVp. The results suggest that both of these replication-competent viruses induce an anemic form of erythroleukemic transformation when administered to newborn, but not adult, mice.

40|$|The elucidation of splenic {{function}} {{in health and}} disease has been continuously evolving since Aristotle dismissed the concept that {{it is essential for}} human existence more than 2000 years ago. The first recorded splenectomy was performed by Zaccarelli in 1549 for presumed malaria in a young woman who survived at least 6 years postoperatively [1]. The nonessential nature of the spleen was reinforced in subsequent animal experimentation following Read’s successful splenectomy in a dog in 1638 [2]. Quittenbaum [3], in 1826, is credited with the initial well-documented splenectomy in a young woman with probable portal hypertension and splenomegaly. The patient expired postoperatively from exsanguination. Despite this dismal early outcome, splenectomy became an acceptable practice for idiopathic hypertrophy, malarial hypertrophy, <b>splenic</b> anemia, <b>leukemia,</b> cysts, and tuberculosis, with an associated mortality rate of 13 % by 1908 [4]...|$|R

40|$|B cell {{neoplasms}} comprise> 50 % {{of blood}} cancers. However, {{many types of}} B cell malignancies remain incurable. Identification and validation of novel genetic risk factors and oncogenic signaling pathways are imperative {{for the development of}} new therapeutic strategies. We and others recently identified TRAF 3, a cytoplasmic adaptor protein, as a novel tumor suppressor in B lymphocytes. We found that TRAF 3 inactivation results in prolonged survival of mature B cells, which eventually leads to spontaneous development of B lymphomas in mice. Corroborating our findings, TRAF 3 deletions and inactivating mutations frequently occur in human B cell chronic lymphocytic <b>leukemia,</b> <b>splenic</b> marginal zone lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma, Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, and Hodgkin lymphoma. In this context, we have been investigating TRAF 3 signaling mechanisms in B cells, and are developing new therapeutic strategies to target TRAF 3 downstream signaling pathways in B cell neoplasms. Here we discuss our new translational data that demonstrate the therapeutic potential of targeting TRAF 3 downstream signaling pathways in B lymphoma and multiple myeloma...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHairy cell leukemia (HCL) is an {{uncommon}} B-cell lymphoid neoplasia, representing 2 – 3 % of all leukemias. It {{is more common}} in men, with a median age at diagnosis of 52 years. The hair-like projections on its surface are its principal characteristic. Although its etiology has not been established, the recent gene sequencing of HCL identified the presence of the BRAF V 600 E mutation, absent in other malignant neoplasias of the lymph cells. The clinical course of the disease is usually indolent. The majority of patients initially present weakness and fatigue, pancytopenia and splenomegaly. HCL must be distinguished from other indolent lymphoid neoplasias such as prolymphocytic <b>leukemia,</b> <b>splenic</b> marginal zone lymphoma, the variant of HCL (HCLv), and mantle cell lymphoma. Peripheral blood flow cytometer is essential for the detection of CD 11 c, CD 19, CD 20, CD 22, CD 25, and CD 10, as well as a bone marrow aspirate to detect immunophenotypes. In addition, a bone biopsy is useful to perform an immunohistochemistry analysis for TRAP, DBA- 44 and A 1 annexin. Purine analogues remain the first line of treatment. However, interferon and rituximab are a valid option, if the ideal treatment is unavailable. New discoveries in the pathophysiology of HCL have brought the creation of pharmaceuticals with distinct therapeutic targets. These pharmaceuticals are currently undergoing testing...|$|R
40|$|Background: Hairy-cell leukemia (HCL) is a {{well-defined}} clinicopathological entity whose underlying genetic lesion is still obscure. Methods: We searched for HCL-associated mutations by performing massively parallel sequencing {{of the whole}} exome of leukemic and matched normal cells purified from the peripheral blood of an index patient with HCL. Findings were validated by Sanger sequencing in 47 additional patients with HCL. Results: Whole-exome sequencing identified five missense somatic clonal mutations that were confirmed on Sanger sequencing, including a heterozygous mutation in BRAF that results in the BRAF V 600 E variant protein. Since BRAF V 600 E is oncogenic in other tumors, further analyses were focused on this genetic lesion. The same BRAF mutation was noted in all the other 47 patients with HCL who were evaluated by means of Sanger sequencing. None of the 195 patients with other peripheral B-cell lymphomas or leukemias who were evaluated carried the BRAF V 600 E variant, including 38 patients with splenic marginal-zone lymphomas or unclassifiable <b>splenic</b> lymphomas or <b>leukemias.</b> In immunohistologic and Western blot studies, HCL cells expressed phosphorylated MEK and ERK (the downstream targets of the BRAF kinase), indicating a constitutive activation of the RAF-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in HCL. In vitro incubation of BRAF-mutated primary leukemic hairy cells from 5 patients with PLX- 4720, a specific inhibitor of active BRAF, led to a marked decrease in phosphorylated ERK and MEK. CONCLUSIONS; The BRAF V 600 E mutation was present in all patients with HCL who were evaluated. This finding may have implications for the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and targeted therapy of HCL.

40|$|Background: The t(ll; 14) (ql 3;q 32) is a {{chromosomal}} ab-normality {{usually associated}} with mantle cell (centrocytic) lymphomas, although it has occasionally been reported in other chronic lymphoproliferative disorders such as chronic lymphocytic <b>leukemia,</b> prolymphocytic <b>leukemia,</b> <b>splenic</b> lymphoma with villous lymphocytes, and multiple myeloma. This abnormality results in the translocation of the bcl- 1 oncogene from chromosome 11 to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus on chromosome 14. The bcl- 1 oncogene {{is a member of}} the cyclin gene family, and high levels of cyclin Dl mRNA are consistently found in malignant B cell prolif-erations with t(ll; 14). Patients and methods: We examined cyclin Dl protein expression in 33 patients with low grade lymphoproliferative disorders and 2 patients with reactive hyperplasias by West-ern blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody. Results: 8 / 11 mantle cell lymphomas, 0 / 11 chronic lym-phocytic leukemias, 0 / 4 hairy cell leukemias, 0 / 2 Sezary syn-drome, 0 / 2 monocytoid B-cell lymphomas, 0 / 3 follicular lymphomas, and 0 / 2 reactive hyperplasias had overexpres-sion of cyclin Dl. Cytogenetic analysis was performed in four cases of mantle cell lymphoma; three of these cases had the t(ll; 14), one of which was hypotetraploid with two copies of t (l l; 14). Immunophenotypically, all cases of mantle cell lym-phoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia had coexpression ofCD 5 andCD 20. Conclusion: Mantle cell lymphoma may be difficult to dis-criminate from chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a more indo-lent disease, on morphologic and immunophenotypic grounds. Our findings suggest that analysis of cyclin Dl pro-tein expression may be helpful in differentiating mantle cell lymphomas from other low grade lymphoproliferative dis-orders.

40|$|Background. Chronic {{lymphoproliferative}} disorders are considered rare in Oriental patients and {{are thought to}} constitute only 2 % of all leukemias in these patients, compared to 20 - 30 % in Western patients. We conducted a retrospective analysis of Chinese patients with chronic {{lymphoproliferative disorders}} to define the frequency and spectrum of these disorders. Methods. A consecutive series of Chinese patients with leukemia and lymphoproliferative disorders seen at two regional hospitals in Hong Kong were analyzed retrospectively. The diagnosis of chronic lymphoproliferative disorders was based on morphologic and immunologic criteria proposed by the French- American-British Cooperative Study Group. Results. Sixty-four Chinese patients with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders were identified, and these patients constituted 19 % {{of a total of}} 342 cases of leukemia diagnosed in 3 years. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia was the most common form, occurring at a frequency of 12. 5 % of all leukemias. The clinicopathologic features of these patients were similar to those of Western patients, except that Chinese patients tended to present with more advanced (Rai's Stages III and IV; Binet's Stage C) and bulky (splenomegaly > 9 cm) disease, and expressed λ light chain about six times more frequently. Other chronic lymphoproliferative disorders identified in this study included prolymphocytic leukemia, mantle zone lymphoma, hairy cell <b>leukemia,</b> <b>splenic</b> lymphoma with villous lymphocytes, large granular lymphocyte leukemia, and Sezary syndrome. The authors did not identify any case of human T-cell lymphotropic virus-I-related lymphoproliferative disorders within the study period. Conclusion. In addition to providing the frequencies of various chronic lymphoproliferative disorders in southern Chinese people, this study also showed that these disorders no longer should be considered rare in this population. Inherent biologic differences between lymphoproliferative disorders in Chinese and Western patients also may exist. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Limited {{knowledge}} exists {{about the}} impact of specific genetic abnormalities on the proliferation of neoplastic B cells from chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (B- CLPDs). Here we analyze the impact of cytogenetic abnormalities on the proliferation of neoplastic B cells in 432 B-CLPD patients, grouped according to diagnosis and site of sampling, versus their normal counterparts. Overall, proliferation of neoplastic B cells highly varied among the different B-CLPD subtypes, the greatest numbers of proliferating cells being identified in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Burkitt lymphoma (BL). Compared with normal B cells, neoplastic B-CLPD cells showed significantly increased S + G 2 /M-phase values in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), BL, and some DLBCL cases. Conversely, decreased proliferation was observed in follicular lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/ Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (LPL/ WM), and some DLBCL patients; hairy cell <b>leukemia,</b> <b>splenic</b> marginal zone, and MALT-lymphoma patients showed S + G 2 / M phase values similar to normal mature B lymphocytes from LN. Interestingly, in B-CLL and MCL significantly higher percentages of S + G 2 /M cells were detected in BM versus PB and in LN versus BM and PB samples, respectively. In turn, presence of 14 q 32. 3 gene rearrangements and DNA aneuploidy, was associated with a higher percentage of S + G 2 /M-phase cells among LPL/WM and B-CLL cases, respectively. © 2008 by The American Society of Hematology.
