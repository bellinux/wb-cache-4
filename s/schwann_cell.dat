In addition, neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) is known to enhance <b>Schwann</b> <b>cell</b> motility in vitro. NCAM is a glycoprotein that is expressed on axonal and <b>Schwann</b> <b>cell</b> membranes. Polysialic acid (PSA) is synthesized on NCAM by polysialyltransferase (PST) and sialyltransferase X (STX). During {{the development of the}} CNS, PSA expression on NCAM is upregulated until postnatal stages. However, in the adult brain PSA is found only in regions with high plasticity. PSA expression does not occur on Schwann cells.|$|E
25|$|Collagen is {{the major}} {{component}} of the extracellular matrix and has been widely used in nerve regeneration and repair. Due to its smooth microgeometry and permeability, collagen gels are able to allow diffusion of molecules through them. Collagen resorption rates are able {{to be controlled by}} crosslinking collagen with polypoxy compounds. Additionally, collagen type I/III scaffolds have demonstrated good biocompatibility and are able to promote <b>Schwann</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation. However, collagen conduits filled with Schwann cells used to bridge nerve gaps in rats have shown surprisingly unsuccessful nerve regeneration compared to nerve autografts. This is because biocompatibility is not the only factor necessary for successful nerve regeneration; other parameters such as inner diameter, inner microtopography, porosity, wall thickness, and <b>Schwann</b> <b>cell</b> seeding density will need to be examined in future studies in order to improve the results obtained by these collagen I/III gels.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two kinds}} of <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells,</b> myelinating and nonmyelinating. While myelinating <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells</b> cover large {{diameter}} (>1 micrometer) peripheral nervous system (PNS) axons with myelin, nonmyelinating <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells</b> encapsulate small diameter PNS axons with their cytoplasmic processes. Nonmyelinating <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells</b> are the neoplastic element in neurofibromas. This conglomeration of nonmyelinating <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells</b> and axons is called a Remak bundle.|$|R
50|$|<b>Schwann</b> <b>cells</b> are {{a variety}} of glial cell that keep {{peripheral}} nerve fibres (both myelinated and unmyelinated) alive. In myelinated axons, <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells</b> form the myelin sheath. The sheath is not continuous. Individual myelinating <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells</b> cover about 100 micrometres of an axon—equating to approximately 10,000 <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells</b> along a 1-metre length of the axon. The gaps between adjacent <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells</b> are called nodes of Ranvier.|$|R
40|$|Neurofibromas are benign tumors from {{patients}} with von Recklinghausen Neurofibromatosis (NF 1) that are comprised primarily of <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells.</b> These <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells</b> are found both {{in association with}} axons and in the extracellular matrix that is prevalent in neurofibromas, and in which fibroblasts are also abundant. An unresolved question has been whether cells in neurofibromas are normal cells or are intrinsically abnormal. We have tested the hypothesis that cells in neurofibromas are abnormal and have shown that neurofibroma <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells,</b> unlike normal <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells,</b> promote angiogenesis in the chick chorioallantoic membrane model system, and invade basement membranes in this system. In contrast, neurofibroma fibroblasts neither promote angiogenic reactions nor invade basement membranes. When injected into nude mice, neurofibroma <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells</b> do not form progressive tumors. These results suggest that NF 1 <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells</b> differ from normal <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells,</b> that they are preneoplastic, and that genetic and/or epigenetic changes in <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells</b> may be required for development of peripheral nerve tumors in NF 1...|$|R
25|$|C fiber axons {{are grouped}} {{together}} {{into what is}} known as Remak bundles. These occur when an unmyelinated <b>Schwann</b> <b>cell</b> bundles the axons close together by surrounding them. The <b>Schwann</b> <b>cell</b> keeps them from touching each other by squeezing its cytoplasm between the axons. The condition of Remak bundles varies with age. The number of C fiber axons in each Remak bundle varies with location. For example, in a rat model, large bundles of greater than 20 axons are found exiting the L5 dorsal root ganglion, while smaller bundles of average 3 axons are found in distal nerve segments. Multiple neurons contribute axons to the Remak bundle with an average ratio of about 2 axons contributed per bundle. The cross sectional area of a Remak bundle is proportional to the number of axons found inside it. Remak bundles in the distal peripheral nerve are clustered with other Remak bundles. The Remak Schwann cells {{have been shown to be}} electrochemically responsive to action potentials of the axons contained within them.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the cell}} membrane, {{cholesterol}} also functions in intracellular transport, cell signaling and nerve conduction. Cholesterol {{is essential for}} the structure and function of invaginated caveolae and clathrin-coated pits, including caveola-dependent and clathrin-dependent endocytosis. The role of cholesterol in endocytosis of these types can be investigated by using methyl beta cyclodextrin (MβCD) to remove cholesterol from the plasma membrane. Recent studies show that cholesterol is also implicated in cell signaling processes, assisting in the formation of lipid rafts in the plasma membrane, which brings receptor proteins in close proximity with high concentrations of second messenger molecules. In multiple layers, cholesterol and phospholipids, both electrical insulators, can facilitate speed of transmission of electrical impulses along nerve tissue. For many neuron fibers, a myelin sheath, rich in cholesterol since it is derived from compacted layers of <b>Schwann</b> <b>cell</b> membrane, provides insulation for more efficient conduction of impulses. Demyelination (loss of some of these Schwann cells) is believed {{to be part of the}} basis for multiple sclerosis.|$|E

50|$|<b>Schwann</b> <b>cells</b> {{are known}} for their roles in {{supporting}} nerve regeneration. Nerves in the PNS consist of many axons myelinated by <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells.</b> If damage occurs to a nerve, the <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells</b> will aid in digestion of its axons (phagocytosis). Following this process, the <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells</b> can guide regeneration by forming a type of tunnel that leads toward the target neurons. The stump of the damaged axon is able to sprout, and those sprouts that grow through the Schwann-cell “tunnel” do so at the rate of approximately 1mm/day in good conditions. The rate of regeneration decreases with time. Successful axons can therefore reconnect with the muscles or organs they previously controlled with the help of <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells,</b> however, specificity is not maintained and errors are frequent, especially when long distances are involved. Because of their ability to impact regeneration of axons, <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells</b> have been connected to preferential motor reinnervation as well. If <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells</b> are prevented from associating with axons, the axons die. Regenerating axons will not reach any target unless <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells</b> are there to support them and guide them. They {{have been shown to be}} in advance of the growth cones. <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells</b> are essential for the maintenance of healthy axons. They produce a variety of factors, including neurotrophins, and also transfer essential molecules across to axons.|$|R
25|$|<b>Schwann</b> <b>cells</b> (SC) {{are crucial}} to {{peripheral}} nerve regeneration; they play both structural and functional roles. <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells</b> are responsible for taking part in both Wallerian degeneration and bands of Bungner. When a peripheral nerve is damaged, <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells</b> alter their morphology, behavior and proliferation {{to become involved in}} Wallerian degeneration and Bungner bands. In Wallerian degeneration, <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells</b> grow in ordered columns along the endoneurial tube, creating a band of Bungner (boB) that protects and preserves the endoneurial channel. Additionally, they release neurotrophic factors that enhance regrowth in conjunction with macrophages. There are some disadvantages to using <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells</b> in neural tissue engineering; for example, it is difficult to selectively isolate <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells</b> and they show poor proliferation once isolated. One way to overcome this difficulty is to artificially induce other cells such as stem cells into SC-like phenotypes.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{experiments}} on rats {{have raised the}} possibility that <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells</b> can present antigens to T lymphocytes. We have investigated whether this mechanism might be relevant in leprosy by determining under what conditions human <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells</b> express class I and class II antigens, and whether infection with Mycobacterium leprae affects this expression. The distribution of these antigens was examined on human <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells</b> in dissociated cell cultures derived from human fetal peripheral nerves. We find that both <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells</b> and fibroblastic cells in these cultures normally express class I antigens but not class II antigens. When <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells</b> are infected with live Mycobacterium leprae for 48 h, 73 % of <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells</b> phagocytose the bacteria. Mycobacterium leprae prevents 3 H-thymidine incorporation into cultured human <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells,</b> but does not affect class I expression in these cells. Treatment of normal and Mycobacterium leprae infected cultures with gamma-interferon for 72 h induces class II expression on most <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells</b> {{but not on the}} majority of fibroblastic cells. The fact that human <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells</b> infected with Mycobacterium leprae can be induced by gamma-interferon to express class II antigens suggests that {{they may be able to}} present Mycobacterium leprae antigens to T lymphocytes and thus initiate immune responses against the bacteria. We suggest that a failure of this response, such as that seen within nerve trunks in lepromatous leprosy, is caused by deficient class II expression on <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells.</b> This deficiency in class II expression, in turn, may be caused by the reduced gamma-interferon production characteristic of lepromatous leprosy...|$|R

When cultured on the collagen fibers, <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells</b> aligned along the magnetically oriented collagen after two hours of 8-T magnetic field exposure.

Seven days from sciatic nerve crush, transverse cryostat sections were cut 5 mm distal to lesion and incubated for double immunostaining to indicate <b>Schwann</b> <b>cells</b> (GFAP or S 100 b) and individual investigated cytokines or to demonstrate growing axons (GAP 43).

However, it is not clear whether or not the increase in length of the myelin sheath can be accounted solely by the increase in length of axon covered by each successive turn of the spiral, as previously explained.
