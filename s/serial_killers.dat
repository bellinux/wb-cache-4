5|$|Slayer's musical style {{involves}} fast tremolo picking, {{double bass}} drumming, riffs in irregular scales and shouted vocals. In the original line-up, King, Hanneman and vocalist/bassist Tom Araya {{contributed to the}} band's lyrics, {{and all of the}} band's music was written by King, Hanneman and Lombardo. The band's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as murder, <b>serial</b> <b>killers,</b> necrophilia, torture, genocide, human experimentation, Satanism, hate crimes, terrorism, religion, antireligion, Nazism and warfare, have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits and criticism from religious groups and the general public. However, its music has been highly influential, often being cited by many bands as an influence musically, visually and lyrically. Between 1991 and 2013, the band sold 4,900,000 albums in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The first {{industrial}} artists {{experimented with}} noise and aesthetically controversial topics, musically and visually, such as fascism, <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> and the occult.

40|$|This article {{presents}} a feminist {{analysis of the}} <b>serial</b> <b>killer</b> portrait film - a cycle of contemporary low-budget films featuring <b>serial</b> <b>killer</b> protagonists. Although unusal within <b>serial</b> <b>killer</b> cinema for their frustration of identification and suspense, portrait films remain locked into wider popular discourses around serial murder, particularly in their intertextual aspects. In the portrait film, {{this results in a}} tautological construction of the <b>serial</b> <b>killer</b> (he kills because he is a killer, he is a killer because he kills) that places him not only beyond understanding but also outside society and, so, unconnected to normaive constructions of masculinity...|$|R

5|$|There {{were four}} {{different}} artworks released for the album, each which completed one-fourth of a map, that when put together, illustrates the earth painted with red.

It is the band's first studio album {{to be played}} mostly in E-flat tuning since Divine Intervention. World Painted Blood is the last Slayer album to feature the band's original lineup, as drummer Dave Lombardo was fired from the band and guitarist Jeff Hanneman died of alcohol-related cirrhosis, both in 2013. It also the band's final album to be released through American Recordings.|$|E
5|$|When writing material, {{the band}} would write the music first before {{incorporating}} lyrics. King or Hanneman used a 24-track and drum machine to show band members the riff that they created, {{and to get}} their opinion. Either King, Hanneman or Lombardo would mention if any alterations could be made. The band played the riff to get the basic song structure, and figured out where the lyrics and solos would be placed. Hanneman, King and Araya tended to have different lyrical influences. Hanneman's lyrics dealt with Nazis, religion, warfare and similar topics; King's lyrics are generally anti-religious; Araya's lyrics usually dealt with topics {{that could be considered}} less controversial than Hanneman's and King's, such as <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> and warfare.|$|E
5|$|Writer Vince Gilligan was {{inspired}} to write the episode based on Time-Life mail order books he read as a child discussing the lives of <b>serial</b> <b>killers.</b> One of the books featured mass murderer Howard Unruh. The episode was also inspired by Ted Serios, whose thought-photographs were mentioned by Fox Mulder in the episode. The use of the dentist chair where Schnauz sat his victims was included considering people's common fear of the dentist. Gilligan had written the role of Schnauz with Taylor Vince {{in mind when he}} saw him in the Adrian Lyne film Jacob's Ladder. Vince had been approached to be a guest star on the show in the first season but declined the role due to it being too small.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) {{released}} {{the results of}} a five-year-long study (the Highway Serial Killings Initiative) investigating the unsolved murders of prostitutes, hitchhikers, and stranded motorists. Over 500 female victims have been compiled in a database, most of whom were killed or discarded at truck stops, hotels, and roadsides. The FBI has speculated that many of these victims were murdered by long-haul truck drivers, some of whom may be <b>serial</b> <b>killers.</b> Investigators speculate that the easy access to potential victims, mobility, and lack of supervision enjoyed by long-haul truck drivers have contributed to this phenomenon. The head of the initiative, Michael Harrigan, says most of the victims lead high-risk lifestyles (e.g., prostitution) which left them particularly vulnerable. In 2004, the FBI began investigating a string of murders in which the victims were found along the Interstate 40 corridor in Oklahoma and several other states, which sparked the creation of the Highway Serial Killings Initiative.|$|E
5|$|The Friday the 13th novella storyline was not {{connected}} to the Jason X series, and did not continue the stories set forth by the films, but furthered the character of Jason in its own way. Friday the 13th: Church of the Divine Psychopath has Jason resurrected by a religious cult. Jason is stuck in Hell, when recently executed serial killer Wayne Sanchez persuades Jason to help him return to Earth in Friday the 13th: Hell Lake. In Hate-Kill-Repeat, two religious <b>serial</b> <b>killers</b> attempt to find Jason at Crystal Lake, believing that {{the three of them}} share the same contempt for those that break the moral code. In The Jason Strain, Jason is on an island with a group of convicts placed there by television executives running a reality game show. The character of Pamela Voorhees returns from the grave in Carnival of Maniacs. Pamela is in search of Jason, who is now part of a traveling sideshow and about to be auctioned off to the highest bidder.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Henry Dion {{appears to be}} a composite of several real life <b>serial</b> <b>killers.</b> His fondness for conversing with his victims' bodies and the gregarious demeanour shown during this seems to be based on Milwaukee-based murderer Jeffrey Dahmer, who would also, like Dion, document his victims photographically. The habit of photographing victims, and the notion of killing women to use them as props, stems from killer Henri Nadeau, who murdered several women in order to use them as mannequins for his photography. The use of an overbearing matriarchal figure as a stressor harkens to Edmund Kemper, who was driven to kill young women by his hatred of his mother, who he eventually murdered before turning himself in; both Dion and Kemper cut their mother's vocal folds from their throats after killing them.|$|E
