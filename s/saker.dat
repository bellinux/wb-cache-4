5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon {{belongs to a}} genus whose lineage includes the hierofalcons and the prairie falcon (F.mexicanus). This lineage probably diverged from other falcons {{towards the end of}} the Late Miocene or in the Early Pliocene, about 5–8million years ago (mya). As the peregrine-hierofalcon group includes both Old World and North American species, it is likely that the lineage originated in western Eurasia or Africa. Its relationship to other falcons is not clear, as the issue is complicated by widespread hybridization confounding mtDNA sequence analyses. For example, a genetic lineage of the <b>saker</b> falcon (F.cherrug) is known which originated from a male <b>saker</b> producing fertile young with a female peregrine ancestor, and the descendants further breeding with sakers.|$|E
5|$|A 2014 {{study of}} falcons of {{different}} species (gyrfalcon, <b>saker</b> falcon, and peregrine falcon) used video cameras mounted {{on their heads}} or backs to track their approaches to prey. Comparison of the observed paths with simulations of different pursuit strategies showed that these predatory birds used a motion camouflage path consistent with CATD.|$|E
5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamsters {{may also}} live near areas of human civilization. In Mongolia, {{they may be}} found in yurts to keep warm during the winter, as they do not have {{thermoregulation}} like the Djungarian hamster. They have five main predators: the Eurasian eagle owl, the steppe eagle, the corsac fox, the common kestrel, and the <b>saker</b> falcon. All distribution areas have more females than males, because males are at higher risk from predators, as they cannot move as quickly.|$|E

50|$|In 1636, former pirate Sir Henry Mainwaring {{was placed}} {{in command of the}} Unicorn. The ship's initial {{armament}} comprised 16 demi-cannon, 11 demi-culverin, 26 culverin, and 10 <b>sakers.</b> When she underwent a refit in 1677, her armament was upgraded to 22 demi-cannon on the lower gun deck, 22 demi-culverin on the middle gun deck, 14 <b>sakers</b> on the upper gun deck, and 6 <b>sakers</b> on the quarterdeck. Originally comprising 250 men in 1636, Unicorns crew increased to 300 in 1653, and 410 in 1666.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, England was {{at peace with}} France and Spain and the coastal forts, {{included}} Portland, received little attention. A 1623 survey reported that the castle was equipped with three culverins, nine demi-culverins and a <b>saker,</b> but that the fortifications had suffered badly from sea erosion and required extensive repairs. Fourteen years later, the castle had 15 guns and a garrison of a captain and 12 men.|$|E
5|$|Falco peregrinus cassini, {{described}} by Sharpe in 1873, {{is also known}} as the Austral peregrine falcon. It includes kreyenborgi, the pallid falcon, a leucistic morph occurring in southernmost South America, which was long believed to be a distinct species. Its range includes South America from Ecuador through Bolivia, northern Argentina, and Chile to Tierra del Fuego and the Falkland Islands. It is non-migratory. It is similar to nominate, but slightly smaller with a black ear region. The variation kreyenborgi is medium grey above, has little barring below, and has a head pattern like the <b>saker</b> falcon, but the ear region is white.|$|E
5|$|Opportunistic {{and highly}} adaptable, the western jackdaw varies its diet {{markedly}} depending on available food sources. They {{have been recorded}} taking eggs and nestlings from the nests of the skylark (Alauda arvensis), Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus), razorbill (Alca torda), common murre (Uria aalge), grey heron (Ardea cinerea), rock pigeon (Columba livia), and Eurasian collared dove (Streptopelia decaocto). A field study of a large city dump {{on the outskirts of}} León in northwestern Spain showed that western jackdaws forage there in the early morning and at dusk, and engage in some degree of kleptoparasitism. The <b>saker</b> falcon (Falco cherrug) has been reported stealing food from western jackdaws on powerlines in Vojvodina in Serbia.|$|E

5000|$|HMS Oxford was a 54-gun fourth rate ship of {{the line}} of the Royal Navy, built by Francis Baylie in Bristol and {{launched}} in June 1674. Her guns comprised twenty-two 24-pounders on the lower deck, with twenty-two large <b>sakers</b> (8-pounders) on the upper deck and ten smaller <b>sakers</b> (5-pounders) on the quarter deck.|$|R
5|$|Walmer {{was built}} between April 1539 and autumn 1540, {{by a team}} {{including}} Richard Benese as the surveyor, William Clement as the master carpenter, and Christopher Dickenson as the master mason. It was initially garrisoned by a captain, two lieutenants, two porters, ten gunners and three soldiers, at an annual cost of £174. It was probably equipped {{with a range of}} brass and cast-iron guns, along with arquebuses and bows for close defence. In 1597, a report listed the castle's artillery as comprising a cannon, a culverin, five demi-culverins, a <b>saker,</b> a minion and a falcon.|$|E
5|$|In England cannon {{were being}} used to besiege various {{fortified}} buildings during the English Civil War. Nathaniel Nye is recorded as testing a Birmingham cannon in 1643 and experimenting with a <b>saker</b> in 1645. From 1645 he was the master gunner to the Parliamentarian garrison at Evesham and in 1646 he successfully directed the artillery at the Siege of Worcester, detailing his experiences and in his 1647 book The Art of Gunnery. Believing that war {{was as much a}} science as an art, his explanations focused on triangulation, arithmetic, theoretical mathematics, and cartography as well as practical considerations such as the ideal specification for gunpowder or slow matches. His book acknowledged mathematicians such as Robert Recorde and Marcus Jordanus as well as earlier military writers on artillery such as Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia and Thomas (or Francis) Malthus (author of A Treatise on Artificial Fire-Works).|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{invasion}} threat from France passed and a lasting peace {{was made in}} 1558, but the Spanish threat to the south-west of England grew in importance to the government. War broke out in 1569, {{with the threat of}} invasion and the garrison at St Mawes was strengthened: in 1578 it comprised 100 soldiers. An additional battery of guns was built to allow the fort to fire further upriver. Fears of a Spanish attack continued especially after the failed Armada of 1597; two earth and timber bastions were built out from the original stone castle to hold guns, eventually becoming the main batteries for the castle. By 1623 the castle held two brass culverins, six iron culverins, one demi-culverin and one <b>saker,</b> with a small garrison of 14 men, overseen by a captain and a lieutenant. A survey in 1634 indicated structural problems, and suggested that £534 was needed for repairs.|$|E
50|$|From 1660 Fairfax carried 52 guns. In 1666 {{this was}} {{increased}} to 66, comprising twenty-two demi-cannons, four culverins, twenty-six 12-pounders and fourteen 5-pounder <b>sakers.</b> A further {{substantial increase in}} armament occurred in 1672, with {{the replacement of the}} unwieldy demi-cannons and an increase in total weaponry to 72 guns. Her lower deck was fitted with twenty-six iron-cast 24-pounders, supported by twenty-four 12-pounders on the upper deck. Fourteen brass <b>sakers</b> were placed along the quarterdeck with another four in the forecastle. Two additional <b>sakers</b> and two 12-pounder cannons, were located in the captain's cabin running the length of the stern.|$|R

5|$|The {{work was}} carried out quickly due {{to the risk of}} a French attack, and by July two brass <b>saker</b> guns were mounted on the site. It cost at least £3,100, £1,300 of which came from the {{proceeds}} of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, with chalk, stone and timber being brought across from the neighbouring Isle of Wight. The castle was completed by October and formed a fortification with a square keep, rectangular gun platforms to the east and west, and angled bastions to the front and rear. Chatterton was appointed the new captain, with a team of eight soldiers, twelve gunners and a porter. The castle was well-armed, with seven brass artillery pieces - a culverin, demi-culverin, cannon and demi-cannon - and eight iron guns.|$|E
5|$|A survey {{conducted}} in 1603 recorded that Upnor Castle had 20 guns of various calibres, plus another 11 guns split between two sconces or outworks, known as Bay and Warham Sconces. The castle's armament {{consisted of a}} demi-cannon, 7 culverin, 5 demi-culverin, a minion, a falconet, a <b>saker,</b> and four fowlers with two chambers each. Bay Sconce was armed with 4 demi-culverin, while Warham Sconce had 2 culverin and 5 demi-culverin. Eighteen guns were recorded as being mounted in the castle twenty years later. The garrison's armament included 34 longbows, an indication that archery was still of military value even at this late date. By this time, however, the castle {{was in a state}} of disrepair. The drawbridge and its raising mechanism were broken, the gun platforms needed repairs, and the courtyard wall had collapsed. A new curtain wall had to be built to protect the landward side of the castle. The foundations of Warham Sconce were reported to have been washed away by the tide, and it appears that both sconces were allowed to fall into ruin.|$|E
