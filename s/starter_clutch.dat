5000|$|Care is {{required}} with the automatic start. The <b>starter</b> <b>clutch</b> will break down easily with longer pressing of the starter switch. Riders in the Philippines complains frequent replacements of their starter clutches.|$|E
50|$|In {{the last}} few years the World Championship was raced with 100 cc Formula A karts. In 2007, the change in {{regulations}} introduced the KF1, 125 cc karts equipped with electric <b>starter,</b> <b>clutch</b> and rpm limiter set at 16,000 rpm, to replace Formula A. The 2010 edition was raced with KF2 karts.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1982 model, {{lightning}} quick steering {{was considered}} too extreme for some, though was highly appreciated by sporting riders. The weight distribution was 55/45 and the lightly loaded front end {{benefited from the}} installation of a slightly larger than usual front tire. The front suspension was described as too soft, the rear, even with an adjustable shock, difficult to dial in. On the electrical side, the Vision had [...] "a well deserved reputation for eating starters and stators." [...] There is also {{a problem with the}} <b>starter</b> <b>clutch.</b> It has a tendency to loose a three bolt fastening in the <b>starter</b> <b>clutch</b> mechanism. The fairing was an option in '82, and that proved to be the bike's downfall, along with being pricier than the other twins of similar size on the market then. But not having the beautiful fairing available at the outset proved the '82 undoing. It was just too unattractive without the fairing. This point came home when all 1000 1983 models sold out immediately...with the non-optional black fairing. The motorcycling public knew a good thing when they saw it..while the marketers did not...|$|E

50|$|It can {{consist of}} {{mechanical}} or electrical devices, {{or a combination}} of both. Mechanical soft <b>starters</b> include <b>clutches</b> and several types of couplings using a fluid, magnetic forces, or steel shot to transmit torque, similar to other forms of torque limiter. Electrical soft starters can be any control system that reduces the torque by temporarily reducing the voltage or current input, or a device that temporarily alters how the motor is connected in the electric circuit.|$|R
50|$|While being {{inspired}} by the Honda RVF endurance racer (not {{to be confused with}} the Honda RVF750 RC45) the VFR750R instead had its engine based on the 1986-7 VFR750F (RC24). The engines are almost identical externally, the only visible differences being in the cylinder heads and the engine side covers. Inside the engine no major parts were identical to the RC24. The clutch, gearbox, crankshaft, oil pump, connecting rods, water pump, pistons, <b>starter</b> <b>clutch,</b> and the entire valvetrain and cylinder heads are specific to the RC30. There were race kits available from HRC Honda.|$|E
5000|$|The {{engine is}} a 90°, liquid cooled, {{four-stroke}} V-twin, with 81.0 mm bore and a 62.6 mm stroke, four valves per cylinder, and {{intake and exhaust}} valving each with their own camshaft. Its more relaxed cam profiles, compared with the SV engine, boost the power between 4,000 and 6,500 rpm, along with slight changes to the airbox and exhaust. Relative to the SV, the crank inertia (flywheel effect) is also increased by 4% via a redesigned <b>starter</b> <b>clutch.</b> [...] As well, the DL650 engine uses a plastic outer clutch cover and engine sprocket cover for reduced weight and noise.|$|E
50|$|In 1975, the {{internal}} {{parts of the}} fork were changed, the engine was re tuned to 53hp now with chrome bores plated directly onto the alloy barrels and the bike was heavily restyled, this stylng ran to the model run out with only minor changes. Was known for the <b>starter</b> <b>clutch</b> to engage while riding locking up the engine, this was modified under warranty. The Exhaust Coupler Tube System (ECTS) link between the exhaust pipes disappeared in some markets outside of North America. The North America area kept the exhaust coupler tubes and older engine tune {{through to the end}} of production. This MY sales were 14,000+.|$|E

5000|$|Walker {{would only}} start in 5 of the Lakers 19 playoff games, with Robert Horry entrenching {{himself as the}} <b>starter</b> with <b>clutch</b> plays. In Game 4 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals on May 26, 2002, Walker made a 3-pointer {{at the end of}} halftime; by then the Sacramento Kings led over the Lakers 65-51. Although the shot counted, {{television}} replays showed Walker had released the ball after the buzzer went off. [...] The Lakers won the game 100-99 on a buzzer-beating 3-pointer from Horry that tied the series at 2. The Lakers then won the series in 7 to advance to the Finals. Walker's shot influenced the NBA's decision to institute instant replay for review the following season.|$|R
5000|$|The 1996 GSX-R {{introduced}} a new twin-spar frame which was derived from Suzuki's RGV 500 GP racer. A new compact and lightweight engine incorporated magnesium covers on the cylinder head, <b>starter</b> motor and <b>clutch</b> cover to aid weight reduction. These changes resulted in a decrease in weight by 20 kg to 179 kg, while power had increased to a [...] This year's model finally addressed the weight problems that had plagued the GSX-R through {{the first half of}} the 90s.|$|R
50|$|The solenoid also closes high-current {{contacts}} for {{the starter}} motor, which begins to turn. Once the engine starts, the key-operated switch is opened, a {{spring in the}} solenoid assembly pulls the pinion gear away from the ring gear, and the starter motor stops. The <b>starter's</b> pinion is <b>clutched</b> to its drive shaft through an overrunning sprag clutch which permits the pinion to transmit drive in only one direction. In this manner, drive is transmitted through the pinion to the flywheel ring gear, but if the pinion remains engaged (as for example because the operator fails to release the key {{as soon as the}} engine starts, or if there is a short and the solenoid remains engaged), the pinion will spin independently of its drive shaft. This prevents the engine driving the starter, for such backdrive would cause the starter to spin so fast as to fly apart.|$|R
25|$|The first models, known generically as the T300s, {{all used}} a common piston {{diameter}} (76mm) {{in a common}} wet cylinder liner. Basic engine variations were achieved {{through the use of}} two specifications of piston stroke: 65mm to create individual cylinder capacity of 300cc, and 55mm to create a 250cc individual cylinder. Two 750cc models were released – and the Daytona and Trident 750 triples (3 x 250cc). There was one 1000cc model – the Daytona 1000 four (4 x 250cc). Two 900cc models were the Trophy 900 and Trident 900 triples (3 x 300cc). The Trophy 1200 four was the largest model (4 x 300cc). All were remarkably smooth running. The three cylinder models were equipped with a contra-rotating balance shaft mounted {{at the front of the}} engine. The four cylinder models benefitted from twin balance shafts – unique at the time – mounted beneath the crank shaft. Contemporary road tests noted the solidity and smoothness of performance as positives but the weight of the machines as negatives. For brand new machines produced by a totally new concern, there were remarkably few early problems. These were an insecure oil pressure switch and a longer-lived problem with the <b>starter</b> (or sprag <b>clutch).</b> The cosmetic finish on the first machines was simple and not very robust. Revisions to crankcases for the three-cylinder models in 1993, together with a move to high pressure casting, reduced engine weight considerably. All painting and plating operations were brought in house in 1993, as the Hinckley factory benefitted from further investment after the initial success of the range. The result was improved quality and durability of finish, added to the basic engineering integrity of the engine and chassis, made for a long-lasting and robust motorcycle.|$|R
