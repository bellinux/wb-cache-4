Engine Start/Stop button is for the <b>S</b> <b>Limited</b> only. The Yaris received minor changes for 2009 model year with new bumpers, grille, tail lights, and revised interior. The new base model J was added into the line up. The mid-level E got aero-style mudguards and roof spoiler, while full body kits are remained on the <b>S</b> and <b>S</b> <b>Limited.</b> The <b>S</b> <b>Limited</b> TRD Sportivo with extreme body kits and lowered springs was offered in small numbers. The Yaris received a facelift again in 2012 with the Vitz RS look but with different bumper, bodykit and spoiler, new steering wheel on E, S, and TRD Sportivo type (similar with the 2010 Grand New Corolla Altis Type V), and new interior with red stitching on S and TRD Sportivo types. The <b>S</b> <b>Limited</b> type was renamed to S A/T and the TRD Sportivo variant added manual transmission (previously available in automatic transmission only), a new aggressive body kit, and no longer used TRD suspension to reduce cost.

40|$|Purpose To {{establish}} the criterion {{validity of the}} activPAL activity monitor in measuring sedentary behaviour (sitting/lying) and physical activity (standing/walking) in people with Parkinson’s Disease, using direct observation as the criterion measure. Design A cross-sectional observational study, evaluating the criterion validity of the activPAL in a laboratory setting. Participants 12 individuals with a Parkinson’s Disease diagnosis and Hoehn and Yahr Disease Severity Classification of ≤ 3 who could walk five minutes independently or with an aid. Methods Participants wore one activPAL monitor and completed a test protocol involving 3 modules: body-postures, {{activities of daily living}} and indoor/outdoor walking. Each trial was video-recorded where the camera was synchronised with the activPAL. Researchers classified the time spent in different postures and compared it to the activPAL output. Results Using the Bland and Altman method, the activPAL appeared to over-estimate sedentary behaviour compared to direct observation. Mean difference for module 1 was - 35. 6 <b>s</b> (<b>limits</b> of agreement - 75. 3 s to 4. 1 s) and for module 2 - 16. 5 <b>s</b> (<b>limits</b> of agreement - 29. 4 s to - 3. 6 s). When measuring physical activity, in module 1, the activPAL slightly underestimated compared to direct observation. Mean difference of 2. 3 <b>s</b> (<b>limits</b> of agreement - 21. 1 to 25. 7 s). Modules 2 and 3 had better agreement. Mean differences of - 0. 2 s and - 0. 1 <b>s</b> with <b>limits</b> of agreement of - 16. 9 s to 16. 5 s and - 1. 2 s to 1. 01 s, respectively.
