South Australia's coastal, estuarine and marine waters have significant environmental, economic, social, and cultural value to South Australians. South Australia’s coastline spans approximately 5, 000 km (including islands) and varies from cliffs, rocky shores, and sandy beaches in the South-East and West Coast, to mud flats and mangrove habitats in the upper Gulf St Vincent and Spencer Gulf. The related marine environment extends over 60, 000 km 2 of State waters and supports a diverse range of habitats including seagrass meadows, benthic <b>sand</b> habitats, <b>sponge</b> gardens and a variety of intertidal and sub tidal reef habitats. Over 100 estuaries which are significant breeding and nursery habitats for a broad range of ecologically diverse species are also found across the State...|$|R
40|$|Prehistoric and {{traditional}} ceramics contain {{a wide range}} of tempers (non-plastic inclusions), including <b>sand,</b> sherd (grog), <b>sponge</b> spicules, phytoliths (siliceous bark ash), diatomite, organic fibers, shell, calcite, mica and asbestos. The use of these materials in traditional and archaeological ceramics and their association with cooking pottery and thermal shock resistance are examined. The thermal shock parameters that are relevant to low-fired ceramics are identified and tested. The primary factor in the thermal shock resistance is identified as fracture toughness. By increasing the amount and size range of temper additions, and by selecting tempers that are platy and fibrous, fracture toughness can be enhanced. Secondary factors include porosity, thermal expansion and relative strength. These parameters are tested employing fracture energy and thermal expansion measurements, and quench tests...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of shell theory has added {{new and exciting}} dimension to modern Civil Engineering, particularly {{in the design of}} super structures. Shells foundations, by virtue of its form will necessarily be more economical. This research is primarily focused on the behavior of three different shapes of foundation viz; pyramidal shell foundation, hyperbolic paraboloid shell foundation and square flat foundation under axial loading with different founding levels. Three different height/ thickness ratio of flat and shell foundation made out of different materials (namely Plaster of Paris and polyester resin) were studied. All foundations were subjected to loading test in a soil box as purposefully designed and fabricated special for this research to model testing conditions. The test observation of foundation model was measured using dial gauges to observe the stress characteristic deformation. Experimental results from direct shear test, particle size distribution, specific gravity and compression test were analyzed to characterize the material tested (<b>sand</b> and <b>sponge).</b> Results from foundation loading tests presented in graphical form show that that foundation shape, shell aspect ratio and embedment depth significantly affected the result of load carrying capacity. The load carrying capacity of shell footing was found to increase with shell aspect ratio (0. 3, 0. 4 and 0. 5) and embedment depth increase from 0. 3 to 0. 5 compared to the square flat foundation for a similar cross-sectional area. Crack patterns were observed to investigate the movement and the location of crack. The crack pattern for shell foundation started initially in the corner of edge beams. However, for the square flat foundation, failure mechanism was distributed over the whole foundation starting at the edge of foundation and ended at column base interface. Shell foundation showed higher load bearing values compared to square flat foundation...|$|R
40|$|The Kent Group {{of islands}} are {{situated}} {{in the middle of}} eastern Bass Strait and consists of Deal, Dover, Erith, North East and South West Islands, as well as various small rocky islets. The island group is in the Twofold Shelf Bioregion and represents the only location for this bioregion in Tasmanian waters. This report details the spatial distribution of seabed habitat types in the Kent Group of islands out to the 3 nautical mile (Nm) limit. Habitat boundaries were logged in the field using a combination of echosounder and video analysis of the seabed, with the video also used to identify the dominant macroalgae and seagrass present. Habitats were defined at two hierarchical levels, with the higher level categories being rocky reef, unconsolidated vegetated and unconsolidated unvegetated substrate. The Kent Group of islands has a diverse range of habitats reflecting the regions bathymetry, oceanography and geomorphology; including rocky reefs of varying exposure and depth, sheltered coves with seagrass, and extensive areas of <b>sponge</b> and <b>sand</b> habitat.

40|$|The world's {{coral reefs}} {{appear to be}} in a global decline, yet most {{previous}} research on coral reefs has taken place at depths shallower than 30 m. Mesophotic coral ecosystem (depths deeper than ~ 30 m) studies have revealed extensive, productive habitats and rich communities. Despite recent advances, mesophotic coral ecosystems remain understudied due to challenges with sampling at deeper depths. The few previous studies of mesophotic coral ecosystems have shown variation across locations in depth-specific species composition and assemblage shifts, potentially a response to differences in habitat or light availability/water clarity. This study utilized scuba to examine fish and benthic communities from shallow and upper mesophotic (to 45 m) zones of Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary (FGBNMS, 28 ° 0 'N; 93 ° 50 'W) from 2010 - 2012. Dominant planktivores were ubiquitous in shallow and upper mesophotic habitats, and comparisons with previous shallow research suggest this community distribution has persisted for over 30 years. Planktivores were abundant in shallow low-relief habitats {{on the periphery of the}} coral reef, and some of these sites that contained habitat transitioning from high to low relief supported high biomass of benthic predators. These peripheral sites at FGBNMS may be important for the trophic transfer of oceanic energy to the benthic coral reef. Distinct differences between upper mesophotic and shallow communities were also observed. These included greater overall fish (as well as apex predator) biomass in the upper mesophotic, differences in apex predator community composition between depth zones, and greater percent cover of algae, rubble, <b>sand,</b> and <b>sponges</b> in the upper mesophotic. Greater fish biomass in the upper mesophotic and similar fish community composition between depth zones provide preliminary support that upper mesophotic habitats at FGBNMS have the capacity to serve as refugia for the shallow-water reefs. Diving surveys of the upper mesophotic and shallow-water coral reef have revealed valuable information concerning the reef fish community in the northern Gulf of Mexico, with implications for the conservation of apex predators, oceanic coral reefs, and the future management of FGBNMS...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{clean water}} {{resources}} are reduced due to water pollution problems. Pollution {{carried by the}} wastewater is considered {{as one of the}} contributors to the water pollution problems. One of the ways to reduce water pollution is to treat wastewater at the source points. This can be accomplished by constructing a biofilter system at the point sources of polluted water before being discharged into rivers. Biofilter system consists of several compartments of filtration media, which is located at Kolej Kediaman 3, UMP Gambang. This research focused on the performance of biofilter for water quality improvement before and after passing through the filtration system and the effect of increasing the quantity of filtration materials. This system utilizes <b>sponge,</b> <b>sand</b> and granite, EM rnudball, activated carbon, charcoal and empty palm oil fruit bunch as its filtration media for the removal of constituents in water. Results of these experiments were analyzed by evaluating the water quality parameters such as Turbidity, SS, AN, BOD and COD in comparison to Standard A and Standard B Environmental Quality Standards Act (1974) and in terms of their percentages of removal. The results indicated that all effluent discharge of parameters pH, temperature, COD, BOD, and TSS are complying Standard B only. However, the performance of biofilter in terms of BOD, COD, and TSS removal is excellent where the removal efficiency range from 0. 97...|$|R
40|$|Doble titulacióSome papers dealing qith the {{modelisation}} of {{injection of}} cement fluids in cavities like vertebras for the vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, {{have already been}} publicized. Previously, advances made in the matter were {{the basis of the}} Level Set. But those projects done on the software called COMSOL multiphysics, did not try to simulate real injections in cavities. This papers goes further on that way. Even if the experiments could not be done with real alpha-TCP, a viscous liquid was used to simulate similar conditions to the ones experienced in vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. These results have benn compared to those given by the numerical problems computed on COMSOL and it has been shown taht the computational power provided by actual personal computers, is nowadays enough to obtain results approaching reality. This paper explains also how to use the Level Set mode on numerical software, and explains also the signification of the results obtained. Moreover, an opening is done by introducing the porous equations that govers the fluid flow in porous medias. To approach the real situation of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, a fluid melted with sand was injected to little pieces of sponge to see the distribution of <b>sand</b> inside the <b>sponge</b> porosity and the pressure constraints.

6000|$|To filter Muddy Water.--When, at the watering-place, {{there is}} little else but a mess of mud and filth, take a good handful of grass or rushes, and tie it roughly {{together}} {{in the form of}} a cone, 6 or 8 inches long; then dipping the broad end into the puddle, and turning it up, a streamlet of fluid will trickle down through the small end. This excellent plan is used by the Northern Bushmen--at their wells quantities of these bundles are found lying about. (Anderson.) Otherwise suck water through your handkerchief by putting it over the mouth of your mug, or by throwing it on the gritty mess as it lies in the puddle. For obtaining a copious supply, the most perfect plan, if you have means, is to bore a cask full of auger holes, and put another small one, that has had the bottom knocked out, inside it; and then to fill the space between the two, with grass, moss, etc. Sink the whole in the midst of the pond; the water will run through the auger-holes, filter through the moss, and rise in the inner cask clear of weeds and sand. If you have only a single cask, holes may be bored in the lower part of its sides, and alternate layers of sand and grass thrown in, till they cover the holes; through these layers, the water will strain. Or any coarse bag, kept open with hoops made on the spot, may be moored in the mud, by placing a heavy stone inside; it will act on The same principle, but less efficiently than the casks. <b>Sand,</b> charcoal, <b>sponge,</b> and wood, are the substances most commonly used in properly constructed filters: peat charcoal is excellent. Charcoal acts not only as a mechanical filter for solid impurities, but it has the further advantage of absorbing putrid gases. (See below, [...] "Putrid Water.") Snow is also used as a filter in the Arctic regions. Dr. Rae used to lay it on the water, until it was considerably higher than its level, and then to suck the water through the snow.|$|R
40|$|While the remote-sensing {{community}} {{attempts to}} find measures of reef "health" able to be detected and mapped using satellite image data, internationally recognized field assessments are already in place to document benthic cover, among other parameters, {{as an indicator of}} coral reef status. Reef Check is one such program, designed in 1996 as a globally applicable, rapid, field-survey protocol for coral reef health monitoring by volunteer divers (Hodgson 1999). The protocol is designed to provide a measure of reef health based on indicator species or families for fish, invertebrates, and substrates. Data collected contribute to a global-scale database on coral reef status for use in management plans (Hodgson 1999). Today, over 5, 000 trained volunteer divers are led by more than 160 scientists in surveys of 1, 500 reefs in 60 countries. During the survey, they record substrate type directly under a measuring tape at 0. 5 -m intervals on 4 · 20 m consecutive transects between 3 - and 10 -m depth (Hodgson and Liebler 2002). The Reef Check substrate classification scheme provides information on benthic habitats such as hard coral, dead coral, soft coral, fleshy algae, rock, rubble, <b>sand,</b> silt <b>sponge,</b> and other. This is the same type of information that remote-sensing scientists are often asked to extract from image data by coral reef scientists and managers. Reef Check programs are an important source of reef-health information, yet the data collected will always be point based, and extrapolation to non-surveyed areas will be required. Remotely sensed data can provide a spatially extensive survey if methods are developed to successfully link ground-survey observations, like those provided by Reef Check, with satellite or airborne images. Thus, the objectives of our project were (1) to determine whether Reef Check substrate classes could be successfully mapped with Landsat ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) image data, and (2) to determine whether Reef Check data that are currently collected globally may be used for training and assessing the accuracy of remotely sensed image classifications. We address our objectives using a case study in the Capricorn Bunker Group, southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia...|$|R
40|$|International audienceStegastes adustus and Stegastes planifrons are {{two species}} of {{damselfishes}} commonly found in the Caribbean. These territorial fishes have been widely studied due to their major ecological role on coral reef in controlling the growth of macroalgae that compete with corals for space and, inversely, on their deleterious role in destroying coral tissues to impulse the development of algae. However, few studies were conducted on the biotic and abiotic components of their territories. In the present study, territory size and surfaces of benthic components (macroalgae, algal turf, massive corals, branching corals, Milleporidae, <b>sponges,</b> <b>sand</b> and rubbles) were estimated for the two species at two contrasted sites. At Ilet Pigeon site (IP), the two damselfishes were found at different depth and exhibited different territory sizes. S. adustus defended a larger territory characterized by massive corals, sand and Milleporidae, while S. planifrons territories were smaller, deeper and characterized by branching corals, sponges and rubble. At Passe-à-Colas site (PC), the two fish species coexisted in the same depth range and defended territories of similar size. Their territories presented higher proportions of macroalgae, but smaller surfaces of Milleporidae than at IP. At PC, {{the main difference between}} the two species was a higher surface of massive corals inside S. planifrons territories than S. adustus territories. Differences in microhabitat characteristics between the two Stegastes seemed mostly site related. This resulted from the high plasticity of two species, allowing them to persist on Caribbean coral reefs after the decline of most branching acroporids, their former favorite habitats...|$|R
40|$|Palaemon affinis is the commonest prawn in {{intertidal}} habitats of the North and South Islands, New Zealand. The population dynamics, community composition, {{and natural}} food preferences of P. affinis were {{studied in the}} Avon-Heathcote Estuary, and rock pools at Taylors Mistake and Kaikoura, South Island, in 2000. Bimonthly samples were taken at all three sites at low tide using a suction sampler for the hyperbenthic communities and a corer or quadrat for the benthic communities. The distribution of P. affinis was patchy and its abundance fluctuated seasonally, peaking at the estuary and Kaikoura in winter (~ 580 individuals per m 2) and at Taylors Mistake in autumn (294 individuals per m 2). The carapace length (CL, mm), total body length (TBL, mm), and wet weight (W, g) of P. affinis were measured. Males were 15 - 19 mm CL, 19 - 50 mm TBL, 0. 060 - 1. 091 g W, and females were 5 - 21 mm CL, 13 - 54 mm TBL and 0. 021 - 1. 691 g W. The size ranges differed between the populations. Males from Kaikoura grew at a slower rate than females (CL against TBL or W), but not those from the Culvert or Taylors Mistake. There were no differences in growth rate {{between males and females}} for pooled data. For the pooled samples, males were significantly smallerllarger than females in TBL, but not in CL or W. The sex ratios were skewed: males dominated the medium size class (9 - 14 mm CL at the Culvert and Taylors Mistake; 9 - 12 mm CL at Kaikoura), and females the large size class (15 - 21 mm CL at the Culvert and Taylors Mistake, 13 - 15 mm CL at Kaikoura). The breeding season of P. affinis was in spring and summer, but the time when ovigerous femaLes first appeared differed between populations. Size at onset of maturity for females in the pooled data was 13 mm CL, but the size differed between sites. Ovigerous female were 13 - 20 mm CL, 33 - 53 mm TLB, and 0. 370 - 1. 729 g W and carried 110 - 690 eggs that weighed 0. 033 - 0. 260 g W. There was no relationship between femaLe body size and fecundity (number eggs), perhaps because of low sample size. The communities at the three sites shared 8 species in common: 2 molluscs (Melagraphia aethiops and Notoacmea sp.), 2 polychaetes (Haploscoloplos cylindrifer and Nereidae), a crab (Halicarcinus varius), an amphipod (Gammaridae), an isopod (Sphaeromatidae), and a brittle star (Amphiura hinemoa). Gammarid amphipods and P. affinis itself contributed most to the similarity index for withinpopulation analysis and to the dissimilarity between populations. Environmental variables (minimum/maximum water depth, water temperature, substratum, site size, salinity) were not well correlated with community composition. At Taylors Mistake, salinity was important (~ 89 % similarity), but substratum type was responsible for most of the similarity (~ 51 % similarity) between communities. Contrary to expectation, P. affinis was mainly carnivorous. Gammarid amphipods were the main food item which was found in ~ 71 % of P. affinis stomachs. Other items included unidentifiable matter, polychaetes, molluscs, plant material, ostracods, isopods, <b>sand</b> grains, <b>sponge</b> spicules and crab. No difference in diet between sexes, size classes or seasons was found. Low fullness values were found with only ~ 28 % of 264 stomachs ~ 50 % full. Periodicity in the locomotor and feeding activities of P. affinis from Kaikoura were examined in laboratory experiments in tanks provided with a continuous supply of fresh flowing seawater. Prawns were recorded using a 24 h time-lapse video camera under constant (red) light. To test for the effect of tide on locomotion, two experiments were conducted with artificial tide cycles simulating natural tide cycles at Kaikoura under constant light (water temperature, 12 ± 1 °C), and under constant darkness (water temperature, 20 ± 2. 5 °C). The effects of day-night cycles on locomotion used a 12 h light: 12 h dark regime with a constant (low) tide (7 em water depth) at 14. 5 ± 2 °C. Feeding experiments were conducted using both a simulated 25 h tidal cycle and a 12 h light: 12 h dark regime (water temperature 19. 5 ± 1. 5 °C). Diel and circatidal rhythms in locomotor activity were found, with maximum activity at night and at high tide. No rhythmicity was found in the feeding activity of P. affinis...|$|R
