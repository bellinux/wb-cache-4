5|$|In {{the first}} trial, 38 Dutch-speaking local {{elementary}} school girls circled the letters they preferred in two yoked lists of letter pairs. A significant {{preference for the}} letters of one's own name over {{those of the other}} person was found. The second experiment used 98 Dutch-speaking local university students, to see if more years of reading made a difference. Four other factors were varied: 1) either pairs or triads of letters; 2) encircling the preferred letter or crossing out the less preferred one(s); 3) the letters QXYZ, infrequent in Dutch, included or excluded; 4) own-name letters presented first or last. All conditions gave a name-letter effect, with a stronger effect when QXYZ were included and the less preferred letter was crossed out. No <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> found using family name rather than first name or both names. While the effect was strongest for initials, subsequent data analysis revealed a significant effect even without the first and last initial.|$|E
25|$|The {{mortality}} rate due to chronic ITP varies but {{tends to be}} higher relative {{to the general population}} for any age range. In a study conducted in Great Britain, it was noted that ITP causes an approximately 60 percent higher rate of mortality compared to gender- and age-matched subjects without ITP. This increased risk of death with ITP is largely concentrated in the middle-aged and elderly. Ninety-six percent of reported ITP-related deaths were individuals 45 years or older. No <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> noted in the rate of survival between males and females.|$|E
25|$|One <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> the {{incorporation}} of the camshaft and magneto drives into the propeller reduction gears {{at the front of}} the engine, rather than using a separate system of gears driven from the back end of the crankshaft; this allowed the overall length of the engine to be reduced as well as making the drive train more reliable and efficient. The drive for the supercharger was also taken off the front of the engine, which required a long shaft to run to its location at the back of the engine.|$|E

25|$|The M1 {{was very}} similar in {{construction}} and appearance to the 155mm Howitzer M1. The only <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> its tube of 4.5 inch (114mm) caliber. The tube had uniform right hand twist, with one turn in 32 calibers. The unbalanced weight of the barrel was supported by two equilibrator springs. The breach was of interrupted screw type; the recoil system hydropneumatic, variable length. The carriage was of split trail type, unsprung and had wheels with pneumatic tires. In firing position, the weapon {{was supported by a}} retractable pedestal. The gun was equipped with M12 panoramic sight.|$|E
25|$|There {{were also}} further {{follow-up}} studies conducted {{using a different}} approach. In these follow-up studies the experimenters contacted certain individuals after foreseeable emotional experiences, such as {{the birth of a}} child, giving blood, or taking an exam. This way, the experimenters chose not only the emotional event to be recalled, but furthermore the types of emotional events they would be studying so that they could examine possible differences between types of emotional events. The findings of these studies supported those of the retrospective studies: 96–100% of emotional events were socially shared. Furthermore, no <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> found in the frequency of social sharing between different types of emotional events.|$|E
25|$|In a {{study done}} in 1979, the effect of {{aspartame}} ingestion on blood and milk amino acid levels in lactating women was tested. In this study, six women from the ages of 20 to 29 with established lactation were studied after oral administration of aspartame or lactose (50mg/kg body weight) in a random order, {{with the intent to}} study the differences in breast milk between the two. The study resulted with the conclusion that aspartame administration at 50mg/kg body weight has a small effect upon the milk aspartate levels; and, although a small increase in aspartate time-effect scores was noted over the four-hour postabsorptive period, no <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> noted over the entire 24-hour watching period.|$|E

30|$|Results: No <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> seen {{in patient}} {{demographics}} between surgical groups. <b>Significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> seen for length of hospital stay, operative time, estimated blood loss, total hospital charges, and most post-operative outcomes (pain level, days of pain analgesics use, days until self care, and days until returning to work).|$|R
40|$|The study {{compared}} the brain electrical activity of {{two groups of}} gifted {{children between the ages}} of 9 and 13 years. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded with eyes closed: "at rest" and during three simple cognitive tasks. <b>Significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> found in absolute power in the resting state EEG between the gifted high achievers and non-gifted, age-matched peers. No <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> found between the gifted underachievers and age-matched peers. <b>Significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> found in absolute and relative power during the word recognition task compared to the resting EEG. No <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> found in the comparisons of the topographic maps for the other cognitive tasks and the resting EEG. Results suggest that topographic mapping of brain activity may provide an educational method for discriminating among children of different cognitive abilities. Implications for education are discussed and suggestions for further research are given...|$|R
500|$|In a 1998 study, the {{carotenoid}} {{composition of}} this species was compared to several other Cantharellus species, including C.cibarus, C.cibarius var. amythysteus, and C.tabernensis. The carotenoid content between species was [...] "virtually identical", comprising γ-carotene, α-carotene, and β-carotene. The only <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> that C.lateritius contained a significant quantity of an unidentified carotene that {{was thought to be}} a breakdown product of β-carotene.|$|E
500|$|Design {{work on the}} I-210 (I-21 version 0) was {{concurrent}} {{with the}} I-21, probably as a fall back for any lack of availability of the latter's TR-2 engines. The only <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> the substitution of [...] BMW 003 engines (or the reverse-engineered RD-20), but the ex-German engine's significantly inferior thrust rating meant {{that it would never}} meet the I-21's speed requirement. Even replacing the BMW 003 with the slightly more powerful (...) Jumo 004 would not allow the I-210 to meet the speed requirement and the project was cancelled before any metal was cut.|$|E
500|$|Most of the PowerBook100's {{internal}} components {{were based on}} its predecessor, the Macintosh Portable. It included a Motorola 68HC000 16MHz processor, had 2MB memory, no floppy disk drive, and cost approximately $2,300. An external floppy disk drive was available for $279. The dimensions of the PowerBook100 were an improvement over the Portable. It was [...] deep, [...] wide, and [...] high, compared to the Portable, which was [...] deep, [...] wide and [...] high. Another <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> the less expensive passive matrix display used instead of the sharper active matrix used on the Portable (and the 170). The PowerBook100 included the System 7.0.1 operating system as standard, with support for all versions up to System 7.5.5. Apple, however, released System 6.0.8L, which allowed the PowerBook100 to run System 6. It {{could also be used}} with some earlier System6 versions, although Apple did not officially support this.|$|E

500|$|After a 7–6–1 {{season in}} 1962, Modell fired Brown and offered the head {{coaching}} job to Collier. Collier told Modell he first needed {{the blessing of}} his wife and of Brown, to whom he still felt a sense of loyalty. He called Brown, who told him he had to take the job because he had a family to support. Collier accepted a three-year contract that would pay him $35,000 a year (about $ in [...] dollars). In contrast with Brown, Collier was almost universally liked by players and other coaches. He was soft-spoken, which was unusual for a head coach, but he earned the respect of the team with his extensive knowledge and his willingness to give players more freedom than Brown ever did. [...] One <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> his approach to play-calling. [...] Like Brown, Collier served as his own play-caller. [...] However, he let Frank Ryan, who replaced Plum as the team's starting quarterback in 1963, change plays at the line of scrimmage and allowed more flexibility in pass routes and blocking schemes.|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} many studies {{relating}} activated brain areas to tool-use, in both physical object manipulation and pantomimes. Meta-analyses have found that tool-use is largely lateralized in the left-hemisphere {{of the brain and}} independent of handedness. Specifically, the brain region which showed the greatest activity was the left superior parietal lobule. Other areas that showed significant activity was bilaterally in both the ventral and dorsolateral premotor cortex, areas by the inferior parietal lobule, and tissue around the medial temporal gyrus. Furthermore, even when object-use was imagined, activation was found to be largely [...] lateralized in the left hemisphere and was very similar to the brain activation in actual tool-use and pantomiming. The only <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> additional activation in the left occipito-parietal region.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Internet {{theories}} arose {{about how}} the vote counting itself had been suspect, due to discrepancies between machine-counted votes (which supported Clinton overall) and hand-counted votes (which supported Obama overall). Fifth-place finisher Dennis Kucinich's campaign paid $25,000 to have a recount done of all Democratic ballots cast in the primary, saying [...] "It is imperative that these questions be addressed {{in the interest of}} public confidence in the integrity of the election process and the election machinery." [...] On January 16 the New Hampshire Secretary of State’s office began the recount. After recounting 23 percent of the state's democratic primary votes, the Secretary of State announced that no <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> found in any candidate's total and that the oft-discussed discrepancy between hand-counted and machine-counted ballots was solely due to demographic factors.|$|E

2500|$|The {{experiment}} of Kemenes et al. {{demonstrated that}} in an extrinsic modulatory neuron, nonsynaptic plasticity influences the expression of long-term associative memory. The relationship between nonsynaptic plasticity and memory was assessed using cerebral giant cells (CGCs). Depolarization from conditioned stimuli increased the neuronal network response. This depolarization lasted {{as long as the}} long-term memory. Persistent depolarization and behavioral memory expression occurred more than 24 hours after training, indicating long-term effects. In this experiment, the electrophysiological expression of the long-term memory trace was a conditioned stimulus induced feeding response. CGCs were significantly more depolarized in the trained organisms than the control group, indicating association with learning and excitability changes. When CGCs were depolarized, they showed an increased response to the conditional stimuli and a stronger fictive feeding response. This demonstrated that the depolarization is enough to produce a significant feeding response to the conditioned stimuli. [...] Additionally, no <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> observed in the feeding rates between conditioned organisms and ones that were artificially depolarized, reaffirming that depolarization is sufficient to generate the behavior associated with long-term memory.|$|E
2500|$|Many genetic {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that most of the various Jewish ethnic divisions and Druze, Palestinians, Bedouin, Lebanese and other Levantines cluster near one another genetically. Many studies have found that Jews and Palestinians are closer to each other than the Palestinians or European Jews are to non-Jewish Europeans or Africans. They also found substantial genetic overlap between Israeli and Palestinian Arabs and Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews. A small but statistically <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> found in the Y-chromosomal haplogroup distributions of Sephardic Jews and Palestinians, but {{no significant differences were found}} between Ashkenazi Jews and Palestinians nor between the two Jewish communities, However, a highly distinct cluster was found in Palestinian haplotypes. 32% of the 143 Arab Y-chromosomes studied belonged to this [...] "I Arab clade", which contained only one non-Arab chromosome, that of a Sephardic Jew. This could possibly be attributed to the geographical isolation of the Jews or to the immigration of Arab tribes in the first millennium. The Druze people, a [...] "genetic sanctuary" [...] for the diversity of the Near East in antiquity, have been found in genetic studies to be the closest to Jews of the populations in the Levant. Lebanese also cluster closely with Jewish ethnic groups, closer than Syrians and Palestinians, according to a 2010 study by Behar et al.
