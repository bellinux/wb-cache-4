"I {{am quite}} easy, for I {{really do think}} that Alec will improve the child's health; {{and by the time}} his year is out, it will be quite soon enough for her to go to Madame Roccabella's and be {{finished}} off," [...] said Aunt Clara, <b>settling</b> her <b>rings,</b> and thinking, with languid satisfaction, of the time when she could bring out a pretty and accomplished niece.|$|R
5000|$|The goal {{of modern}} engine break-ins is the <b>settling</b> of piston <b>rings</b> into an engine's {{cylinder}} wall. A cylinder wall is not perfectly smooth {{but has a}} deliberate slight roughness to help oil adhesion. As the engine is powered up, the piston rings between the pistons and cylinder wall will begin to seal against the wall's small ridges.|$|R
40|$|Perturbations in the Saturn ring's {{mass density}} are noted to {{be prone to}} instabilities through the {{sporadic}} elevation of submicron-size dust particles above the rings, which furnishes an effective angular momentum exchange between the rings and Saturn. The dust thus elevated from the <b>ring</b> <b>settles</b> back onto it at a different radial distance. The range of wavelength instability is determinable in light of the dust charge, the average radial displacement of the dust, and the fluctuation of these quantities. It is suggested {{that at least some of}} the B-ring's ringlets may arise from the instability...|$|R

2500|$|In January 1821 {{internal}} {{conflicts between}} the radical South and the aristocratic North led to {{the dissolution of the}} Union of Prosperity. Members of the Northern Society indulged in writing elaborate aristocratic constitutions while Pestel and his <b>ring</b> <b>settled</b> on changing the regime by military force. Pestel's own political program, influenced by Antoine Destutt de Tracy, Adam Smith, Baron d'Holbach and Jeremy Bentham envisioned [...] "one nation, one government, one language" [...] for the whole country, a uniform Russian-speaking entity with no concessions to ethnic or religious minorities, even the Finns or the Mongols. Contrary to the aspirations of the Northern Society, Pestel planned to reduce the influence of landed and financial aristocracy, [...] "the main obstacle to national welfare that could be eliminated only under a republican form of government." ...|$|R
30|$|In {{comparison}} to rural migrant women, educated young professional women {{are much less}} susceptible to this marketised idea of romance, even though they seem more desirous of obtaining it. Shen, the bank clerk in Nanjing quoted earlier, may have been blasé about bridal photography (she booked hers online), but she was serious about {{the purchase of a}} diamond ring and told her fiancé that this would be absolutely essential. Rather than waiting for her fiancé to surprise her 1  day, as depicted in the ads, she enlisted him into investing quite a few weekends with her, trekking between many jewellery shops in Nanjing, before finally <b>settling</b> on her <b>ring</b> of choice: a half-carat diamond engagement ring costing 20, 000 yuan. But prior to these shopping expeditions, Shen had spent hours browsing online, ‘doing homework’, in her own word, looking at countless images of diamond rings, searching for one which meets her criteria in terms of style and price range.|$|R
40|$|The {{disruption}} of an icy moon in {{a collision with}} an interloping comet a few hundred million years ago is {{a simple way to}} create Saturn's rings. A ring parent moon with a mass comparable to Mimas could be trapped in mean motion resonance with Enceladus and Dione in an orbit near the current outer edge of the rings just beyond the Roche zone. I present collisional N-body simulations of cometary impacts that lead to the partial {{disruption of}} a differentiated moon with a rocky core and icy mantle. The core can survive largely intact while the debris from the mantle <b>settles</b> into a <b>ring</b> of predominantly ice particles straddling the orbital radius of the parent moon. The nascent ring spreads radially due to collisional viscosity while mass re-accretes onto the remnant rocky core to form a new moon that can be identified as Mimas. The icy debris that migrates into the Roche zone evolves into Saturn's ring system. Torques from tidal interaction with Saturn and resonant interactions with the rings push the recently formed Mimas outward to its current position on the same timescale of a few hundred million years. This scenario accounts for the high ice fraction observed in Saturn's rings and explains why the ring mass is comparable to the mass of Mimas. The prior existence of a ring parent moon in mean motion resonance results in a tidal heating rate for Enceladus in the recent past that is significantly larger than the current rate.

40|$|Generally, the {{oblateness}} of {{a planet}} or moon is what causes <b>rings</b> to <b>settle</b> into its equatorial plane. However, the recent suggestion that a ring system might exist (or have existed) about Rhea, a moon whose shape includes a strong prolate component pointed toward Saturn, {{raises the question of}} whether rings around a triaxial primary can be stable. We study the role of prolateness in the behavior of rings around Rhea and extend our results to similar problems such as possible rings around exoplanets. Using a Hamiltonian approach, we point out that the dynamical behavior of ring particles is governed by three different time scales: the orbital period of the particles, the rotation period of the primary, and the precession period of the particles' orbital plane. In the case of Rhea, two of these are well separated from the third, allowing us to average the Hamiltonian twice. To study the case of slow rotation of the primary, we also carry out numerical simulations of a thin disk of particles undergoing secular effects and damping. For Rhea, the averaging reduces the Hamiltonian to an oblate potential, under which rings would be stable only in the equatorial plane. This is not the case for Iapetus; rather, it is the lack of a prolate component to its shape that allows Iapetus to host rings. Plausible exoplanets should mostly be in the same regime as Rhea, though other outcomes are possible. The numerical simulations indicate that, even when the double averaging is irrelevant, <b>rings</b> <b>settle</b> in the equatorial plane on an approximately constant time scale.

50|$|Sebei {{eventually}} <b>settled</b> on the <b>ring</b> name Sami Zayn. Zayn {{made his}} televised debut on the May 22 NXT by defeating two former champions in WWE, first defeating Curt Hawkins {{in the opening}} match and then challenging and scoring an upset win over Antonio Cesaro later in the show. The following week he took part in an 18-man battle royal {{to determine the number}} one contender to the NXT Championship, but was eliminated by Mason Ryan. On the June 12 NXT, Zayn suffered his first pinfall loss in NXT in a rematch with Cesaro. On the July 17 NXT, Zayn failed to win another #1 contender match also involving Cesaro and Leo Kruger. On the July 31 NXT, Zayn teamed with NXT Champion Bo Dallas against Cesaro and Kruger; after Cesaro and Zayn brawled to the back, Dallas lost the match and later blamed Zayn for the loss. On the August 21 NXT, Cesaro defeated Zayn in a two-out-of-three falls match to conclude the feud. On September 6, Zayn made his WWE debut at a house show in his hometown of Montreal, where he defeated Cesaro. When Zayn targeted Dallas' NXT Championship, Dallas cost Zayn his match against Cesaro's fellow Real American, Jack Swagger. Dallas held an open challenge to determine the next title contender but banned Zayn from competing, so Zayn masqueraded as the masked El Local and defeated Dallas to earn his title shot. The match occurred on the October 16 episode of NXT; General Manager JBL restarted the match when Zayn won despite Dallas' foot being on the ropes. Dallas sent Zayn into an exposed turnbuckle to retain his title.|$|R
