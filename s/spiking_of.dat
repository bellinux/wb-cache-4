5|$|The episode relates three {{parallel}} plots, in intertwining scenes. The first plot concerns George being {{banned from}} the executive toilet. Because of this he quits his job, but immediately regrets the decision. He discusses job opportunities with Jerry, but is unable to think of an occupation that would suit him. Jerry suggests that George could try {{to go back to}} work and pretend he never quit. George takes this advice, but his former boss, Rick Levitan (Fred Applegate), refuses to let him stay and insults him. As revenge, George decides to slip a Mickey Finn into his drink during an office party, and enlists Elaine Benes to help him. At the party, Elaine distracts Levitan while George puts the mickey in his drink. When Levitan notices George, however, he decides he was unreasonable and tells George he can have his job back. George attempts to intercept the drink, but after Levitan welcomes him back with a toast sprinkled with insults at George's expense, he changes his mind. In the following scene we see George once again brainstorming job opportunity ideas, the subtext being that his boss discovered the <b>spiking</b> <b>of</b> his drink, connected it to George, and has fired him once again.|$|E
25|$|McNabb {{held the}} record for most {{consecutive}} pass attempts completed with 24 over two games in 2004 against the New York Giants (his final 10 passes on November 28, 2004) and Green Bay Packers (his first 14 passes on December 5, 2004), until Ryan Tannehill broke this record on October 25, 2015 with 25 consecutive passes completed over two games. Mark Brunell and David Carr hold {{the record for}} most consecutive completed passes in a single game with 22. McNabb also completed 25 consecutive passes against the San Diego Chargers on October 23, 2005, but this record is not counted by the NFL as it included a <b>spiking</b> <b>of</b> the ball to stop the clock {{at the end of}} the half. The 2005 game was also noteworthy for Coach Reid calling for McNabb to have 25 pass attempts in a row, without interruption by a running play.|$|E
500|$|Because of its {{densely packed}} neural layers, {{of all the}} brain {{structures}} which generate the hippocampal theta rhythm, the hippocampus generates {{some of the largest}} EEG signals as theta waves [...] In some situations the EEG is dominated by regular waves at 3 to 10Hz, often continuing for many seconds. [...] These reflect subthreshold membrane potentials and strongly modulate the <b>spiking</b> <b>of</b> hippocampal neurons and synchronise across the hippocampus in a travelling wave pattern. The trisynaptic circuit is a relay of neurotransmission in the hippocampus that interacts with many brain regions. From rodent studies it has been proposed that the trisynaptic circuit generates the hippocampal theta rhythm.|$|E

The frill <b>spikes</b> <b>of</b> Achelousaurus are more outwards oriented than the <b>spikes</b> <b>of</b> Einiosaurus, which are medially curved; the <b>spikes</b> <b>of</b> Achelousaurus are nevertheless less {{directed to the}} outside than the comparable <b>spikes</b> <b>of</b> Pachyrhinosaurus. Achelousaurus also differs from Pachyrhinosaurus in its smaller nasal boss that does not reach the frontal bones at its rear.

2500|$|Grade {{inflation}} {{has become an}} issue in Indian secondary education. In CBSE, a 95 per cent aggregate is 21 times as prevalent {{today as it was}} in 2004, and a 90 per cent close to nine times as prevalent. In the ISC Board, a 95 per cent is almost twice as prevalent today as it was in 2012. [...] CBSE called a meeting of all 40 school boards early in 2017 to urge them to discontinue “artifical <b>spiking</b> <b>of</b> marks”. CBSE decided to lead by example and promised not to inflate its results. But although the 2017 results have seen a small correction, the board has clearly not discarded the practice completely. Almost 6.5 per cent of mathematics examinees in 2017 scored 95 or more — 10 times higher than in 2004 — and almost 6 per cent of physics examinees scored 95 or more, 35 times more than in 2004.|$|E
2500|$|After hearing alarmist {{reports of}} the {{approach}} of a large German force, apparently from General Jean Pelissier de Féligonde, who had commanded a unit attacked by German tanks at Hesdin, [...] to the south-east of the port. Dutfoy ordered his men to disable the Coastal artillery in the forts and {{to head for the}} harbour for evacuation. Dutfoy left for Dunkirk and discipline broke down, looting took place and civilians waiting for places on evacuation ships began to panic, until the commander in charge of the sea front threatened people with a gun. The commander decamped at [...] and the <b>spiking</b> <b>of</b> the naval guns continued, until the order was questioned and Admiral Leclerc in Dunkirk was contacted, who ordered the remaining guns to be preserved for the defence of the town and then visited Boulogne early on 22 May.

50|$|Curiously, {{it turns}} out that when a place cell fires is {{determined}} by how far the animal is from the landmark. There is a background oscillation in the hippocampus in the theta band (4 - 8 Hz). As the animal approaches the landmark, the <b>spiking</b> <b>of</b> the place cell moves earlier in phase relative to the background theta oscillation, so that the phase offset essentially measures or represents the distance. This phase shifting relative to spatial distance is called phase precession.|$|E
5000|$|Encoding. Encoding {{of working}} memory {{involves}} the <b>spiking</b> <b>of</b> individual neurons induced by sensory input, which persists {{even after the}} sensory input disappears (Jensen and Lisman 2005; Fransen et al. 2002). Encoding of episodic memory involves persistent changes in molecular structures that alter synaptic transmission between neurons. Examples of such structural changes include long-term potentiation (LTP) or spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). The persistent spiking in working memory can enhance the synaptic and cellular changes in the encoding of episodic memory (Jensen and Lisman 2005).|$|E

50|$|Different {{types of}} GEVIs are seen {{being used in}} many {{biological}} or physiological research areas.

It can show neuron signals with subcellular spatial resolution. It has fast temporal resolution (sub-millisecond), matching or surpassing that of the electrode recordings, and about one magnitude faster than calcium imaging. Researchers have used it to probe neural communications of an intact brain (of Drosophila or mouse), electrical <b>spiking</b> <b>of</b> bacteria (E. coli), and human stem-cell derived cardiomyocyte.|$|E

The huge demand during the peak Christmas/New Year tourist season results in the sharp <b>spiking</b> <b>of</b> air fares during this period.
