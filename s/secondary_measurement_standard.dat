40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the {{development}} of the state <b>secondary</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>standard</b> of mass fraction units and mass (molar) concentration of organic components in liquid and solid substances and materials based on gas and liquid chromatography. The composition of the state <b>secondary</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>standard,</b> as well as the results of evaluating metrological characteristics have been considered. The problem of ensuring the traceability of measurement results to SI units is given in the article. Two approaches are proposed for obtaining a unit from the state primary standard of mass (molar) fraction units and mass (molar) concentration of organic components in liquid and solid substances and materials based on liquid and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with isotopic dilution and gravimetry GET 208 - 2014 : by comparing and using transfer standards. Examples of implementing the indicated approaches used during the development of reference materials of toxic substances, namely a certified reference material for composition of p,p -DDT (p,p -DDT, CRM of UNIIM) and a certified reference material for composition of benz(a) pyrene solution in acetonitrile (C 20 H 12, CRM of UNIIM) are given. Results of determining metrological characteristics of reference materials including standard uncertainty due to characterization and standard uncertainties due to inhomogeneity, short and long-term instabilities are described...|$|E
40|$|SI-traceability ("absolute") {{values have}} been {{obtained}} for sulfur isotope amount ratios n(33 S) /n(32 S) and n(34 S) /n(32 S), in two batches of high purity SO 2 gas (IRMM- 2012 and IRMM- 2013). The SO 2 gas was converted at IMR-Beijing to Ag 2 S, then fluorinated to SF 6 gas both at IMR-Beijing and at IRMM-Geel. Yields of different conversion methods exceed 99 %. The sulfur amount-of-substance measurements were performed by gas mass spectrometry on SF 5 + ions using "IRMM's amount comparator II". These isotope amount ratios were calibrated by means of gravimetrically prepared synthetic mixtures of highly enriched sulfur isotopes (32 S, 33 S and 34 S) in Ag 2 S form. The ratio values in the SO 2 <b>Secondary</b> <b>Measurement</b> <b>Standard</b> are traceable to the SI system.

40|$|Molybdenum {{isotopes}} {{are increasingly}} widely applied in Earth Sciences. They are primarily used {{to investigate the}} oxygenation of Earth's ocean and atmosphere. However, more and more fields of application are being developed, such as magmatic and hydrothermal processes, planetary sciences or the tracking of environmental pollution. Here, we present {{a proposal for a}} unifying presentation of Mo isotope ratios in the studies of mass-dependent isotope fractionation. We suggest that the Mo- 98 / 95 of the NIST SRM 3134 be defined as + 0. 25. The rationale is {{that the vast majority of}} published data are presented relative to reference materials that are similar, but not identical, and that are all slightly lighter than NIST SRM 3134. Our proposed data presentation allows a direct first-order comparison of almost all old data with future work while referring to an international measurement standard. In particular, canonical Mo- 98 / 95 values such as + 2. 3 parts per thousand for seawater and - 0. 7 parts per thousand for marine Fe-Mn precipitates can be kept for discussion. As recent publications show that the ocean molybdenum isotope signature is homogeneous, the IAPSO ocean water standard or any other open ocean water sample is suggested as a <b>secondary</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>standard,</b> with a defined Mo- 98 / 95 value of + 2. 34 +/- 0. 10 parts per thousand (2 s) ...|$|E

40|$|Molybdenum {{concentration}} and δ 98 / 95 Mo values for NIST SRM 610 and 612 (solid glass), NIST SRM 3134 (lot 891307; liquid) and IAPSO seawater reference material are presented based on comparative measurements by MC-ICP-MS performed in laboratories at the Universities of Bern and Oxford. NIST SRM 3134 and NIST SRM 610 and 612 {{were found to}} have identical and homogeneous 98 Mo/ 95 Mo ratios at a test portion mass of 0. 02 g. We suggest, therefore, that NIST SRM 3134 should be used as reference for the δ–Mo notation and to employ NIST SRM 610 or 612 as solid silicate <b>secondary</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>standards,</b> {{in the absence of an}} isotopically homogeneous solid geological reference material for Mo. The δ 98 / 95 MoJMC Bern composition (Johnson Matthey ICP standard solution, lot 602332 B as reference) of NIST SRM 3134 was 0. 25 ± 0. 09 ‰ (2 s). Based on five new values, we determined more precisely the mean open ocean δ 98 / 95 MoSRM 3134 value of 2. 09 ± 0. 07 ‰, which equals the value of δ 98 / 95 MoJMC Bern of 2. 34 ± 0. 07 ‰. We also refined the Mo concentration data for NIST SRM 610 to 412 ± 9 μg g− 1 (2 s) and NIST SRM 612 to 6. 4 ± 0. 7 μg g− 1 by isotope dilution. We propose these concentration data as new working values, which allow for more accurate in situ Mo determination using laser ablation ICP-MS or SIMS...|$|R

40|$|<b>Measurement</b> <b>standards</b> {{are like}} {{institutional}} facts – they enable the travel of information across different domains: geographical, social, institutional or contextual. Uncovering the reasons underlying {{how and why}} <b>measurement</b> <b>standards</b> are adopted can provide insights into how ‘well’ such facts travel. Using the example of measurements in the London coal trade c 1830, I explore how <b>measurement</b> <b>standards</b> travel across different domains and why groups switch from one standard to another. In this specific example, I investigate how standardized measurements replaced the customary practice of heaped measures and, and argue that <b>measurement</b> <b>standards</b> replaced the system of public measurements as a mechanism to ensure transparency in transactions. I further argue that <b>measurement</b> <b>standards</b> were embedded in an institutional ‘package’ of artefacts, regulations and customary practices making this a process of negotiated change.

In this case of <b>measurement</b> <b>standards,</b> facts appear to have travelled well when a change was made to the entire institutional context {{and not just the}} measurement artefact...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} ensure a {{reliable}} calibration of surface topography measuring instruments the use of practical calibration strategies is required. This requirement can be fulfilled when <b>measurement</b> <b>standards</b> with a defined surface structure in accordance to the later obsessed application are used. Different examples for the design and manufacturing of accordant <b>measurement</b> <b>standards</b> have been investigated by the authors. Within this publication a generic reverse engineering approach {{for the design of}} geometrical <b>measurement</b> <b>standards</b> is deducted from these results. The physical effects that occur because of the manufacturing with an ultraprecision turning machine and the sampling of the <b>measurement</b> <b>standards</b> are mathematically inversed and considered. The practical abilities of the approach are illustrated exemplarily. These theoretical considerations for the design can be verified experimentally by the manufacturing of the samples with an ultra-precision turning process. In doing so, the high precision of the new design approach can be validated.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Division of Acoustics and Vibration (DIAVI) of INMETRO establishes, validates and {{maintains}} the Brazilian national <b>measurement</b> <b>standards</b> {{used for the}} realization of the units of physical quantities related to the field of acoustics and vibration. The basic vibration quantity realized by DIAVI is translational acceleration, from which the other motion quantities, i. e., velocity and displacement can be derived. Acoustical physical quantities include sound pressure and sound power. The national <b>measurement</b> <b>standards</b> comprise both absolute (primary) and comparison (secondary) calibration set-ups, which are used to cover the wide range of calibration and testing services demanded by the Brazilian society, trade, industry and science.
