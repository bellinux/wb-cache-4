25|$|This {{instrument}} {{could not}} have been developed without the improvement of piston valves by Silesian oboe player Friedrich Blühmel and Heinrich Stölzel in the early 19th century. These two instrument makers almost simultaneously invented valves, though it is likely that Blühmel (or Blümel) was the inventor, and Stölzel who developed a practical instrument. They jointly applied for a patent and were granted this for a period of ten years. Later, and most importantly, François Périnet received a patent in 1838 for an improved valve which is the basis of all modern brass instrument piston valves. The first notable virtuoso player was Jean-Baptiste Arban, who studied the cornet extensively and published La grande méthode complète de cornet à piston et de <b>saxhorn,</b> commonly referred to as the Arban method, in 1864. Up until the early 20th century, the trumpet and cornet coexisted in musical ensembles. Symphonic repertoire often involves separate parts for trumpet and cornet. As several instrument builders made improvements to both instruments, they started to look and sound more alike. The modern day cornet is used in brass bands, concert bands, and in specific orchestral repertoire that requires a more mellow sound.|$|E

500|$|Heinrich Christian Eisenbrandt, {{originally}} of Göttingen, Germany, {{settled in}} Baltimore in 1819, {{going on to}} manufacture brass and woodwind instruments of high quality. His output included several brass instruments, flageolets, flutes, oboes, bassoons, clarinets with between five and sixteen keys, {{and at least one}} drum and basset-horn. Eisenbrandt owned two patents for brass instruments, and was once praised for [...] "great improvements made in the valves" [...] of the <b>saxhorn.</b> His flutes and clarinets won him a silver medal at the London Great Exhibition of 1851, and he also earned high marks for those instruments and the <b>saxhorn</b> at several Metropolitan Mechanics Institute exhibitions. The Smithsonian Institution now possesses one of Eisenbrandt's clarinets, adorned with jewels, and the Shrine to Music Museum at the University of South Dakota is in possession of a drum and several clarinets made by Eisenbrandt. He is also known to have made a cornet which uses a key mechanism that he had patented. Eisenbrandt died in 1861, and his son, H. W. R. Eisenbrandt, continued the business until at least 1918.|$|E

They include French basse, <b>saxhorn</b> basse, and tuba basse; German Baryton, Tenorbass, and Tenorbasshorn; Italian baritono, bombardino, eufonio, and flicorno basso.

2500|$|During a {{rehearsal}} of Respighi's Pines of Rome in London, de Sabata [...] "demonstrated the bowing and fingering {{of the high}} cello part in the first movement by playing it—without even {{a glance at the}} part. The pianist asked for advice about the solo cadenza, which de Sabata also played by heart. In the rehearsal interval, he asked the flicorni for the final movement to play their brass fanfares. They did. 'What are you playing?' he asked. 'It is an octave higher.' 'Can't be done, Maestro.' ... The Maestro borrowed one of their instruments and blew the correct notes in the right octave."

2500|$|The {{earliest}} surviving solo composition written {{specifically for}} euphonium {{or one of}} its <b>saxhorn</b> cousins is the Concerto per Flicorno Basso (1872) by Amilcare Ponchielli.

[...] However, in the 1960s and 1970s, American composers began to write the first of the [...] "new school" [...] of serious, artistic solo works specifically for euphonium. [...] Since then, there has been a virtual explosion of solo repertoire for the euphonium. [...] In a mere four decades, the solo literature has expanded from virtually zero to thousands of pieces. [...] More and more composers have become aware of the tremendous soloistic capabilities of the euphonium, and have constantly [...] "pushed the envelope" [...] with new literature in terms of tessitura, endurance, technical demands, and extended techniques.|$|E

50|$|The use of saxhorns spread rapidly. The <b>saxhorn</b> valves were {{accepted}} as state-of-the-art {{in their time}} and remain largely unchanged today.
