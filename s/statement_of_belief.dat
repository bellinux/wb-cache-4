500|$|The Westminster Assembly of Divines was {{a council}} of theologians (or [...] "divines") {{and members of}} the English Parliament {{appointed}} to restructure the Church of England which met from 1643 to 1653. Several Scots also attended, and the Assembly's work was adopted by the Church of Scotland. As many as 121 ministers were called to the Assembly, with nineteen others added later to replace those who did not attend or could no longer attend. It produced a new Form of Church Government, a Confession of Faith or <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>belief,</b> two catechisms or manuals for religious instruction (Shorter and Larger), and a liturgical manual, the Directory for Public Worship, for the Churches of England and Scotland. The Confession and catechisms were adopted as doctrinal standards in the Church of Scotland and other Presbyterian churches, where they remain normative. Amended versions of the Confession were also adopted in Congregational and Baptist churches in England and New England in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The Confession became influential throughout the English-speaking world, but especially in American Protestant theology.|$|E

2500|$|Maimonides' 13 {{principles}} were controversial {{when first}} proposed, evoking criticism by Crescas and Joseph Albo.

The 13 principles were ignored by much of the Jewish community {{for the next few}} centuries. (Dogma in Medieval Jewish Thought, Menachem Kellner).

2500|$|The Athanasian Creed, {{also known}} as Pseudo-Athanasian Creed or Quicunque Vult (also Quicumque Vult), is a Christian <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> focused on Trinitarian {{doctrine}} and Christology.

It is the first creed in which the equality of the three persons of the Trinity is explicitly stated. It differs from the Nicene-Constantinopolitan and Apostles' Creeds in the inclusion of anathemas, or condemnations of those who disagree with the creed (like the original Nicene Creed).|$|E

2500|$|Roman Catholic {{is a term}} {{sometimes}} used to differentiate members of the Catholic Church in full communion with the Pope in Rome from other Christians, especially those who also self-identify as [...] "Catholic", such as Anglo-Catholics and Independent Catholics.

2500|$|In 1988, the Leadership Council of Conservative Judaism finally {{issued an}} {{official}} <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>belief,</b> [...] "Emet Ve-Emunah: Statement of Principles of Conservative Judaism". It {{noted that a}} Jew must hold certain beliefs. However, the Conservative rabbinate also notes that the Jewish community never developed any one binding catechism. Thus, Emet Ve-Emunah affirms belief in God and in God's revelation of Torah to the Jews. However, it also affirms the [...] legitimacy of multiple interpretations of these issues. Atheism, Trinitarian views of God, and polytheism are all ruled out. All forms of relativism, and also of literalism and fundamentalism are also rejected. It teaches that Jewish law is both still valid and indispensable, but also holds to a more open and flexible view of how law has and should develop than the Orthodox view.|$|E
2500|$|Conservative Judaism (also {{known as}} [...] "Masorti" [...] outside North America) takes an {{intermediate}} perspective, {{claiming that the}} Oral tradition is entitled to authority, but regarding its rulings as flexible guidelines rather than immutable precepts, that may be viewed {{through the lens of}} modernity. Jewish scholar and philosopher Ismar Schorsch has postulated that Conservative Judaism is tied to [...] "sensing divinity both in the Torah and in the Oral Law," [...] but not in a literalist manner. Rabbi Zecharias Frankel, considered intellectual founder of Conservative Judaism, was respected by many Orthodox until writing in 1859 that the Talmudic term [...] "Law given to Moses at Sinai" [...] always meant ancient customs accepted as such. His opponents demanded that he issue an unequivocal <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> in the total divinity of Oral Law, yet he refrained from doing so.

2500|$|For modern Disciples the one {{essential}} is {{the acceptance}} of Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, and obedience to him in baptism. There is no requirement to give assent to any other <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> or creed. Nor is there any [...] "official" [...] interpretation of the Bible. Hierarchical doctrine was traditionally rejected by Disciples as human-made and divisive, and subsequently, freedom of belief and scriptural interpretation allows many Disciples to question or even deny beliefs common in doctrinal churches such as the Incarnation, the Trinity, and the Atonement. Beyond the essential commitment to follow Jesus {{there is a tremendous}} freedom of belief and interpretation. As the basic teachings of Jesus are studied and applied to life, there is the freedom to interpret Jesus' teaching in different ways. As would be expected from such an approach, there is a wide diversity among Disciples in what individuals and congregations believe. It is not uncommon to find individuals who seemingly hold diametrically opposed beliefs within the same congregation affirming one another's journeys of faith as sisters and brothers in Christ.|$|E
2500|$|Beautiful Vision {{received}} acclaim {{from contemporary}} critics. In a review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau deemed it a musically cohesive album whose songs nonetheless all sound distinct, especially [...] "Cleaning Windows", {{which he said}} ranks among Morrison's greatest songs: [...] "This music is purely gorgeous (or at times lovely), its pleasure all formal grace and aptness of invention." [...] Chip Stern from High Fidelity believed even the inferior songs are a pleasure to listen to because of Morrison's maturation into a more relaxed and disciplined singer, while his band is eclectic yet subtle enough to incorporate a number of styles without sounding ostentatious: [...] "On tunes like 'Dweller on the Threshold', an r groove will suddenly support Celtic, Oriental, or Northern European folk references." [...] Rolling Stone magazine's John Milward was less enthusiastic and lamented four of the songs {{because of what he}} felt were unimaginative lyrics, instances [...] "when he lets his brain trivialize his heart" [...] on an album that is otherwise superior to the temporal, superficial nature of most popular music, [...] "a cogent <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> that finds Morrison touching his dangerously dogmatic themes with the grace of God".|$|E
2500|$|In a 1957 {{discussion}} with Whitcomb, Walter E. Lammerts suggested an [...] "informal association" [...] to exchange ideas, and possibly research, on flood geology. Morris was unavailable {{to get things}} started, then around 1961 Wiliam J. Tinkle got in touch, and they set about recruiting others. They had difficulty in finding supporters with scientific qualifications. The Creation Research Committee of ten they put together on 9 February 1962 had varying views on {{the age of the}} Earth, but all opposed evolution. They then succeeded in recruiting others into what became the Creation Research Society (CRS) in June 1963, and grew rapidly. Getting an agreed <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> was problematic, they affirmed that the Bible was [...] "historically and scientifically true in the original autographs" [...] so that [...] "the account of origins in Genesis is a factual presentation of simple historical truths" [...] and [...] "The great flood described in Genesis, commonly referred to as the Noachian Flood, was an historic event worldwide in its extent and effect", but to Morris's disappointment they did not make flood geology mandatory. They lacked a qualified geologist, and Morris persuaded the group to appoint Clifford L. Burdick as their only Earth scientist, overcoming initial concerns raised by Lammerts. The CRS grew rapidly, with an increasing proportion of the membership adhering to strict young Earth flood geology.|$|E
