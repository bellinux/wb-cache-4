Having an estimated $4,928.57 in <b>scrap</b> <b>value,</b> 1290 was broken up in St. Thomas, while 1291 was taken to Buffalo, New York. The branch line lasted only three years beyond that.|$|E
25|$|Worth $2 million {{immediately}} after electrification, the railroad {{was sold to}} a scrap dealer for $118,756. The tracks were removed and the catenary structures cut down for <b>scrap</b> <b>value.</b> The passenger cars failed to be sold at auction and were burnt in mid-1940to retrieve their metal components. The motorized trucks were sold to the Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway.|$|E

25|$|Numerous accusations have {{related to}} the value of both the vintage airtankers that were being retired, and that of the surplus {{military}} aircraft being provided to the contractors. According to an investigation by the Los Angeles Times, some of the planes being traded in were of no historical significance and, due to their age, were only worth <b>scrap</b> <b>value,</b> as little as $10,000 per aircraft. The Forest Service contends, though, that 28 of the trade-ins ended up in museums across the country.|$|E
25|$|In fact, {{the ship}} was sold to an American naval {{demolition}} dealer for <b>scrap</b> <b>value</b> in December 2005. After eventually reselling the ship to a scrap yard, {{the ship was}} to be towed to India for demolition. In light of protests from Greenpeace, potentially lengthy legal battles due to environmental concerns over the ship's breakup, and amidst charges of fraudulent declarations made by the company to obtain permission to leave Bremerhaven, her owners cancelled the sale contract, refunded the purchase price, and left the ship where she was.|$|E

25|$|Recyclability is a {{key factor}} of a {{sustainable}} material. It reduces the need to mine new resources and requires less energy than mining. Copper and its alloys are virtually 100% recyclable and can be recycled infinitely without any loss of quality (i.e., copper does not degrade (i.e., downcycle) after each recycling loop as do most non-metallic materials, if they are recyclable at all). Copper retains much of its primary metal value: premium-grade scrap normally contains at least 95% {{of the value of}} primary metal from newly mined ore. <b>Scrap</b> <b>values</b> for competing materials range from about 60% down to 0%.

25|$|Between 2005 and 2008 new, lighter fifty-paise, one-, two- and five-rupee coins were introduced, {{made from}} {{ferritic}} stainless steel. The move {{was prompted by}} the melting-down of older coins, whose face value was less than their <b>scrap</b> <b>value.</b> The demonetisation of the 25-(chawanni) paise coin and all paise coins below it took place, and {{a new series of}} coins (50 paise– nicknamed athanni– one, two, five and ten rupees, with the new rupee symbol) were put into circulation in 2011. Coins commonly in circulation are one, two, five and ten rupees. Although it is still legal tender, the 50-paise (athanni) coin is rarely seen in circulation.|$|E
25|$|Scavenging of {{abandoned}} radioactive material {{has been the}} cause of several other cases of radiation exposure, mostly in developing nations, which may have less regulation of dangerous substances (and sometimes less general education about radioactivity and its hazards) and a market for scavenged goods and scrap metal. The scavengers and those who buy the material are almost always unaware that the material is radioactive and it is selected for its aesthetics or <b>scrap</b> <b>value.</b> Irresponsibility {{on the part of}} the radioactive material's owners, usually a hospital, university or military, and the absence of regulation concerning radioactive waste, or a lack of enforcement of such regulations, have been significant factors in radiation exposures. For an example of an accident involving radioactive scrap originating from a hospital see the Goiânia accident.|$|E
25|$|Gould's {{campaign}} was ultimately successful and Congress canceled the subsidy. Owed {{a million dollars}} by Pacific Mail, Roach was now in financial difficulty himself as nervous creditors began calling for immediate settlement of their debts. Roach bluffed {{his way out of}} the crisis by declaring his readiness to settle any debt within three days of receiving a detailed statement. But he now had to decide whether to foreclose on Pacific Mail in order to secure at least some of his investment in the ships, or to renegotiate the payment plan. He chose the latter, accepting Pacific Mail's old ships for their <b>scrap</b> <b>value</b> as part payment, and reducing its monthly payment obligation from $75,000 to $35,000. Roach was embittered by the affair, but ironically, his handling of the crisis increased his reputation as a businessman able to deal with adverse circumstances.|$|E

40|$|Most {{empirical}} {{and theoretical}} econometric studies of dynamic discrete choice models assume the discount factor to be known. We show {{the knowledge of}} the discount factor is not necessary to identify parts, or even all, of the payoff function. We show the discount factor can be generically identified jointly with the payoff parameters. On the other hand it is known the payo¤ function cannot be nonparametrically identified without any a priori restrictions. Our identification of the discount factor is robust to any normalization choice on the payoff parameters. In IO applications normalizations are usually made on switching costs, such as entry costs and <b>scrap</b> <b>values.</b> We also show that switching costs can be nonparametrically identified, in closed-form, independently of the discount factor {{and other parts of the}} payoff function. Our identification strategies are constructive. They lead to easy to compute estimands that are global solutions. We illustrate with a Monte Carlo study and the dataset used in Ryan (2012) ...|$|R

40|$|We {{provide a}} general model of dynamic {{competition}} in an oligopolistic industry with investment, entry, and exit. To {{ensure that there}} exists a computationally tractable Markov perfect equilibrium, we introduce firm heterogeneity {{in the form of}} randomly drawn, privately known <b>scrap</b> <b>values</b> and setup costs into the model. Our game of incomplete information always has an equilibrium in cutoff entry/exit strategies. In contrast, the existence of an equilibrium in the Ericson & Pakes (1995) model of industry dynamics requires admissibility of mixed entry/exit strategies, contrary to the assertion in their paper, that existing algorithms cannot cope with. In addition, we provide a condition on the model's primitives that ensures that the equilibrium is in pure investment strategies. Building on this basic existence result, we first show that a symmetric equilibrium exists under appropriate assumptions on the model's primitives. Second, we show that, as the distribution of the random scrap values/setup costs becomes degenerate, equilibria in cutoff entry/exit strategies converge to equilibria in mixed entry/exit strategies of the game of complete information. Finally, we provide the first example of multiple symmetric equilibria in this literature. dynamic oligopoly; industry dynamics; Markov perfect equilibrium...|$|R
40|$|Forecasting {{category}} or industry sales {{is a vital}} {{component of}} a company 2 ̆ 7 s planning and control activities. Sales for most mature durable product categories are dominated by replacement purchases. Previous sales models which explicitly incorporate a component of sales due to replacement assume there is an age distribution for replacements of existing units which remains constant over time. However, {{there is evidence that}} changes in factors such as product reliability/durability, price, repair costs, <b>scrapping</b> <b>values,</b> styling and economic conditions will result in changes in the mean replacement age of units. This paper develops a model for such time-varying replacement behaviour and empirically tests it in the Australian automotive industry. Both longitudinal census data and the empirical analysis of the replacement sales model confirm {{that there has been a}} substantial increase in the average aggregate replacement age for motor vehicles over the past 20 years. Further, much of this variation could be explained by real price increases and a linear temporal trend. Consequently, the time-varying model significantly outperformed previous models both in terms of fitting and forecasting the sales data. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
