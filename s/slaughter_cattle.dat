But here to day, within striking distance of a mobile enemy whom we wish to circumvent, every private soldier has canvas shelter, and the other arrangements are on an equally elaborate scale. The consequence is that roads are crowded, drifts are blocked, marching troops are delayed, and all rapidity of movement is out of the question.

This study determined the prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) and factors associated with MTC among <b>slaughtered</b> <b>cattle</b> at Jos South Abattoir in Plateau State, Nigeria. Methods: We conducted a cross sectional study in which we collected 168 lung samples systematically from 485 <b>slaughtered</b> <b>cattle</b> from May-June, 2012, and tested for acid fact bacilli (AFB) using Ziehl-Neelsen test and a duplex polymerase chain reaction technique (PCR) for MTC detection...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{detect the}} {{prevalence}} of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) in the lymph nodes of <b>slaughtered</b> <b>cattle</b> collected from selected abattoirs in Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Methods: A total of 376 lymph nodes were collected from <b>slaughtered</b> <b>cattle</b> {{over a period of}} 12 months. Certain characteristics (sex, age, body condition score, and breed) were observed to be associated with MTBC among <b>slaughtered</b> <b>cattle.</b> Collected samples were cultured and tested for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). DNA was isolated, purified, and quantified using a spectrophotometer. Quantified DNA was confirmed to be MTBC by multiplex PCR targeting two genes (IS 6110 and mpb 64). Results: Of the 376 collected lymph nodes, 182 were positive when tested by Ziehl–Neelsen stain and 162 were confirmed positive for MTBC by PCR. MTBC was isolated from lymph nodes with nodular lesions (72. 8 %, 118 / 162) and inflamed lymph nodes (27. 1 %, 44 / 162). All detected MTBC isolates were positive for region of deletion 1 (RD 1). No isolate was detected to have Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG). However, 3. 1 % had M. bovis and 96. 9 % had M. tuberculosis.
