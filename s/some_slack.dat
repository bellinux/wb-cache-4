Huckabee argued that Obama [...] "handled this {{about as well as}} anybody could" [...] and suggested that it was [...] "a very historic speech." [...] While he decried the remarks made by Wright, Huckabee, a former pastor himself, also noted that [...] "sermons...are rarely written word-for-word" [...] and that pastors often get [...] "caught up in the emotion of the moment." [...] Referencing his experience growing up in the segregated South and the legacy of Jim Crow, the former Arkansas governor noted that [...] "we've got to cut <b>some</b> <b>slack</b> to people who grew up being called names, being told, 'You have to sit in the balcony when you go to [...] movie'...Sometimes people do have a chip on their shoulder and resentment.

2500|$|By 1956, Jake and {{his family}} have moved to Miami. After he stays out all night at his new nightclub there, Vickie tells him she wants a divorce (which she has been {{planning}} since his retirement) as well as full custody of their kids. She also threatens to call the cops if he comes anywhere near them. He is later arrested for introducing under-age girls to men in his club. He tries and fails to bribe his way out of his criminal case using the jewels from his championship belt instead of selling the belt itself. In 1957, he goes to jail, sorrowfully questioning his misfortune and crying in despair. Upon returning to New York City in 1958, he happens upon his estranged brother Joey, who forgives him, but is elusive. Returning to the opening scene in 1964, Jake refers to the [...] "I coulda been a contender" [...] scene from the 1954 film On the Waterfront starring Marlon Brando, complaining that his brother should have been there for him but is also keen enough to give himself <b>some</b> <b>slack.</b> After a stagehand informs him that the auditorium where he is about to perform is crowded, Jake starts to chant [...] "I'm the boss" [...] while shadowboxing.|$|E

40|$|With the {{scaling down}} of the CMOS technologies, leakage power is {{becoming}} an increasingly important issue in IC design. There is a trade-off between subthreshold leakage power consumption and clock frequency in the circuit; i. e., for higher performance, leakage power consumption must be sacrificed and vice versa. Meanwhile, timing analysis during synthesis and physical design is pessimistic, which means there are <b>some</b> <b>slacks</b> available to be traded for leakage power minimization. This power minimization can be done after the sign-off which is more accurate and realistic than if it is done before the sign-off. The available slack can be traded for leakage power minimization by footprint-based cell swapping and threshold voltage assignment. In this paper, we introduce our post sign-off leakage power optimization problem as a nonlinear mathematical program and solve it by using conjugate gradient (CG) method. We set up a novel transformation technique to manipulate {{the constraints of the}} optimization problem to be solved by CG. We show that by doing this optimization we can reduce the leakage power consumption by 34 % on average in comparison with no power optimization after sign-off. All experiments are done on the real industrial designs...|$|R

40|$|After {{resection}} of the radial head, {{the load}} transmission through the forearm is changed dramatically. Most of the axial load is {{transmitted to the}} ulna. This can happen through the interosseous membrane, if intact, thus preventing proximal migration of theradius. However, radial head resection entails <b>some</b> <b>slacking</b> of the interosseous membrane, thereby reducing its ability to transmit load. In traumatic lesions of the interosseous membrane there is no limit to the proximal migration of the radius until the ulnar head abuts on the carpus. In both cases the load transmitted by the ulna increases dramatically and can promote fractures thereof. A 52 -year-old, right-handed male patient presented with a periprosthetic fracture of the right ulna 6 weeks after implantation of an ulna head prosthesis. He had previously undergone radial head excision for malunion of the radial head and secondary humeroradial osteoarthritis. This operation had reduced pain and improved the range of motion at the elbow but entailed degenerative arthritis and related symptoms at the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ). From the spectrum of possible treatment options, ulnar head resurfacing/hemiprosthesis was elected and performed without intraoperative or postoperative irregularities. However, 6 weeks postoperatively, as he was lifting a heavy object, a periprosthetic fracture of the ulna occurred, which ultimately was treated successfully by open reduction and plate fixation. Plate fixation of periprosthetic fractures is an established treatment concept after excluding implant loosening. Periprosthetic fracture of the ulna {{seems to be a}} rare complication but can be treated similarly...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the problem of delay-dependent robust {{stochastic}} stability analysis and controller synthesis for Markovian jump systems with state and input delays.

By constructing a new Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional and introducing <b>some</b> appropriate <b>slack</b> matrices, new delay-dependent stochastic stability and stabilization conditions are proposed by means of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). An important feature of the results proposed here is that all the robust stability and stabilization conditions are dependent on the upper bound of the delays. Memoryless state feedback controllers are designed such that the closed-loop system is robustly stochastically stable. Some numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ...|$|R
