5|$|After Kamo's {{release from}} prison, {{he worked in}} the Soviet customs office, by <b>some</b> <b>accounts</b> because he was too {{unstable}} to work for the secret police. He died in 1922 when a truck hit him while he was cycling. Although there is no proof of foul play, some have theorized that Stalin ordered his death to keep him quiet.|$|E
5|$|Christian and Muslim {{philosophers}} modified Ptolemy's {{system to}} include an unmoved outermost region, the empyrean heaven, which came {{to be identified as}} the dwelling place of God and all the elect. Medieval Christians identified the sphere of stars with the Biblical firmament and sometimes posited an invisible layer of water above the firmament, to accord with Genesis. An outer sphere, inhabited by angels, appeared in <b>some</b> <b>accounts.</b>|$|E

5|$|Responsibility for the {{shooting}} in Maribor was never conclusively established. Austrian sources attributed blame to Rudolf Maister, and referenced him in <b>some</b> <b>accounts</b> as the Butcher of Maribor.

5|$|While {{pressing}} {{forward with}} the troops at Mantinea, Epaminondas {{was hit in the}} chest by a spear (or, in <b>some</b> <b>accounts,</b> a sword or large knife). Cornelius Nepos suggests the Spartans were deliberately aiming at Epaminondas in the hope of killing him, and thereby demoralizing the Thebans. The enemy who struck the killing blow was variously identified as Anticrates, Machaerion, or Gryllus, son of Xenophon.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{two sides}} were about even in number, Brant had won a {{lopsided}} victory. All of the Americans were killed or captured; none of Brant's men were injured. According to a detailed list prepared by Brant and sent to Detroit, 37 Americans were killed and 64 were captured. Some of the American dead—some sources say most—had been executed after surrendering. This included Lochry, who {{was sitting on a}} log after the battle when a Shawnee warrior killed him with a tomahawk blow to the head. According to <b>some</b> <b>accounts,</b> Brant prevented the Indians from killing even more of the prisoners. The dead were scalped and left unburied.|$|E
5|$|At 5:17pm on 30 January 1948, Gandhi {{was with}} his grandnieces {{in the garden of}} the former Birla House (now Gandhi Smriti), on his way to address a prayer meeting, when Nathuram Godse fired three bullets from a Beretta 9mm pistol into his chest at point-blank range. According to <b>some</b> <b>accounts,</b> Gandhi died on the spot. In other accounts, such as one {{prepared}} by an eyewitness journalist, Gandhi was carried into the Birla House, into a bedroom. There he died about 30 minutes later as one of Gandhi's family members read verses from Hindu scriptures.|$|E
5|$|By <b>some</b> <b>accounts,</b> Smith {{had been}} {{teaching}} a polygamy doctrine {{as early as}} 1831, and there is unconfirmed evidence that Smith was a polygamist by 1835. Although the church had publicly repudiated polygamy, in 1837 there was a rift between Smith and Oliver Cowdery over the issue. Cowdery suspected Smith had engaged {{in a relationship with}} his serving girl, Fanny Alger. Smith never denied a relationship, but insisted it was not adulterous, presumably because he had taken Alger as a plural wife.|$|E

5|$|Fairfax {{wrote that}} his second-in-command, Major-General Lambert, {{could not get}} up to him, and so charged in another place. A lane, the present-day Atterwith Lane, crossed the ditch on this flank, and <b>some</b> <b>accounts</b> suggest that several units were easy targets for the Royalist musketeers as they {{advanced}} along the lane only four abreast. When a small embankment alongside the ditch at this point was removed in the 1960s, several hundred musket balls were recovered.|$|E
5|$|Hess {{acquired}} full {{ownership of}} the Jets on February 9, 1984, when Helen Dillion sold her 25%interest to him. Before the season, New York traded quarterback Richard Todd to the New Orleans Saints.

The Jets had a second consecutive mediocre season, finishing 7–9 after starting the season 6–2.|$|E
