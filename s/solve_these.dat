5|$|Dubček's reforms {{guaranteed}} {{freedom of}} the press, and political commentary was allowed {{for the first time}} in mainstream media. At the time of the Prague Spring, Czechoslovak exports were declining in competitiveness, and Dubček's reforms planned to <b>solve</b> <b>these</b> troubles by mixing planned and market economies. Within the party, there were varying opinions on how this should proceed; certain economists wished for a more mixed economy while others wanted the economy to remain mostly planned. Dubček continued to stress the importance of economic reform proceeding under Communist Party rule.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the {{previous}} episode, alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) is trapped in a prison from which escape is impossible, the TARDIS has blown up with River Song (Alex Kingston) inside, and the Doctor's companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) has been shot and killed by an Auton replica of her fiancé Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill). As the universe is collapsing, the Doctor uses time travel to <b>solve</b> <b>these</b> problems and ultimately reboot the universe.|$|E
5|$|To <b>solve</b> <b>these</b> {{problems}} Michael Palaeologus began consolidating his rule; he had {{the younger}} co-emperor John IV blinded, which resulted in much resentment. To counter this, the Byzantine Emperor installed a new Patriarch of Constantinople, Germanus III, ordering him to lift an excommunication that had been placed against him by the former Patriarch Arsenios Autoreianos and {{to submit to the}} authority of Rome in order to alleviate the Latin threat.|$|E

5|$|One can <b>solve</b> <b>these</b> problems, {{according}} to Fodor, with functionalism, a hypothesis {{which was designed}} to overcome the failings of both dualism and reductionism. What is important is the function of a mental state regardless of the physical substrate which implements it. The foundation for this view lies in the principle of the multiple realizability of the mental. Under this view, for example, I and a computer can both instantiate ("realize") the same functional state though we are made of completely different material stuff (see graphic at right). On this basis functionalism can be classified as a form of token materialism.|$|E
5|$|Over time, {{professional}} play {{became increasingly}} common, {{and with it}} came rising salaries and unpredictable player movement, {{as well as the}} illegal payment of college players who were still in school. The National Football League (NFL), a group of professional teams that was originally established in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association, aimed to <b>solve</b> <b>these</b> problems. This new league's stated goals included an end to bidding wars over players, prevention of the use of college players, and abolition of the practice of paying players to leave another team. By 1922, the NFL had established itself as the premier professional football league.|$|E
5|$|Transport in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) was an {{important}} part of the nation's economy. The economic centralisation of the late 1920s and 1930s led to the development of infrastructure at a massive scale and rapid pace. Before the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, there were a wide variety of modes of transport by land, water and air. However, because of government policies before, during and after the Era of Stagnation, investments in transport were low. By the late 1970s and early 1980s Soviet economists were calling for the construction of more roads to alleviate some of the strain from the railways and to improve the state budget. The Civil aviation industry, represented by Aeroflot, was the largest in the world, but inefficiencies plagued it until the USSR's collapse. The road network remained underdeveloped, and dirt roads were common outside major cities. At the same time, the attendance of the few roads they had were ill-equipped to handle this growing problem. By the late-1980s, after the death of Leonid Brezhnev, his successors tried, without success, to <b>solve</b> <b>these</b> problems. At the same time, the automobile industry was growing at a faster rate than the construction of new roads. By the mid-1970s, only 0.8 percent of the Soviet population owned a car.|$|E

25|$|In {{spite of}} {{existing}} proofs of impossibility, some persist {{in trying to}} <b>solve</b> <b>these</b> problems.

25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} ways to prove something is impossible. A more rigorous proof would be to demarcate the limit of the possible, and show that to <b>solve</b> <b>these</b> problems one must transgress that limit.

Population. street systems, traffic control, parking, and land use as well as street appearance are considered. Problems of congested traffic, shabby, out-of -date and even dilapidated store fronts, as well as pollution, street construction, parking availability are all very real problems in city centers. Contemporary concepts, approaches, ideas of landscape architects and city planners are examined and applied to <b>solving</b> <b>these</b> problems. The commercial district of Logan, Utah is considered, the problems are identified, and the methodology for <b>solving</b> <b>these</b> problems is applied to this particular situation...|$|R
