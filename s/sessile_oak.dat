5|$|Deciduous forests cover 80% of the park's {{area and}} belong to 28 forest and 18 bush habitats. This variety {{is due to}} the lower river valleys, the sea coast and the karstic terrain. These include forests of oriental beech (Fagus orientalis), <b>sessile</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus petraea), Strandzhan oak (Quercus hartwissiana), Hungarian oak (Quercus frainetto), common {{hornbeam}} (Carpinus betulus), oriental hornbeam (Carpinus orientalis) and small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata) with undergrowth of pontic rhododendron (Rhododendron ponticum), Caucasian whortleberry (Vaccinium arctostaphylos), cherry laurel (Prunus laurocerasus), Black Sea holly (Ilex colchica), Himalayan meadow primrose (Primula rosea) and common heather (Calluna).|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} common liverworts such as Conocephalum conicum and Marchantia polymorpha. Autumn Flapwort (Jamesoniella autumnali), a nationally scarce species most {{commonly found in}} the <b>sessile</b> <b>oak</b> woods of western Scotland, was discovered at a site on Ben Lomond in 2008. The species is named after the Scottish botanist, William Jameson. Northern prongwort is an endemic liverwort found only in the Beinn Eighe nature reserve.

5000|$|Supramediterranean zone (Mid-Montane) 1300 to 1900 m elevation. The summers {{are here}} {{temperate}} and frosts and snow are frequent in winter. Quercus pyrenaica predominates, Portuguese Oak (Quercus faginea) and maple appear too; these three species {{make up the}} forest. More frequent are the <b>Sessile</b> <b>Oaks</b> (Quercus petraea) between 1,300 and 1,750 m. The <b>Sessile</b> <b>Oaks</b> are dominated by the Holm Oaks (Quercus ilex) and, depending on soil and altitude, by bushes as Common Juniper (Juniperus oxycedrus), barberry (Berberis hispanica), (Daphne gnidium), Butcher's broom (Ruscus aculeatus) and Common Hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna) over basic soils.|$|R
25|$|Much of Nova Wood was coppiced for {{pit props}} for Gomersal Colliery but the trees have regrown to produce multi-stemmed <b>sessile</b> <b>oaks</b> and birch.

50|$|The wood is {{a remnant}} of ancient oakwood that once spanned the Atlantic coasts of Europe from Norway to Portugal. It is a {{temperate}} rainforest. The trees are mostly <b>sessile</b> <b>oaks,</b> with other native species including holly, hazel, birch, rowan, willow, ash and wych elm.|$|R
5|$|The hill is {{blanketed}} in heather, {{which gives}} it a deep purple colour during the summer. Ling and bell heather, gorse, <b>sessile</b> <b>oak,</b> ash, rowan, hazel, bracken, mosses, liverworts, lichens and ferns all grow on the hill or in surrounding woodland, {{as well as some}} unique whitebeam species. Exmoor ponies, red deer, pied flycatchers, wood warblers, lesser spotted woodpeckers, redstarts, dippers, snipe, skylarks and kestrels are some of the fauna to be found on or around the hill and in nearby Horner Woods, home to 14 of the 16 UK bat species and including barbastelle and Bechstein's bats.|$|E
25|$|The {{habitat in}} the valleys of the Cong Burn, and its {{tributary}} Little Burn, and the South Burn, is broadleaved woodland. The principal species are <b>sessile</b> <b>oak,</b> Quercus petraea, birch, Betula pubescens and hazel, Corylus avellana, with alder, Alnus glutinosa, locally dominant along the watercourses and at spring-lines. The understorey includes species such as wavy hair-grass, Deschampsia flexuosa, common bracken, Pteridium aquilinum, broad buckler fern, Dryopteris dilatata, and rowan, Sorbus aucuparia.|$|E
25|$|The {{woodland}} {{is dominated}} by silver birch, with aspen, holly, rowan, <b>sessile</b> <b>oak</b> and wild cherry also present. The undergrowth includes heather and bilberry, with patches of broad buckler-fern (Dryopteris dilatata). Over two hundred plants of the nationally rare fern, Lobed Maidenhair Spleenwort (Asplenium trichomanes subsp pachyrachis), were discovered in 1997, growing on calcareous sandstone at two different locations; this is possibly the largest population of the subspecies in Britain. A few plants have since been recorded at Raw Head.|$|E
50|$|The large <b>sessile</b> <b>oaks</b> {{date from}} about 1850. Those in Colonel's Grove were felled in 1920, and {{this part of}} the wood was replanted with ash and beech. Also present are wild cherry and wild service-tree and small-leaved lime. The shrub layer is mostly hazel coppice.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{on the results of}} the soil and its {{production}} potential in the types of forests of <b>sessile</b> <b>oaks</b> (Quercus petraea) {{in the area of the}} National Park „Đerdap” in the community units of Zlatica, Đerdap, Štrbačko korito, Desna reka and Kožica. There are the most widely spread types of the sprout forests of the <b>sessile</b> <b>oaks</b> in the research area, deep deluvium, luvisoil, eutric cambsoils, and a great number of subtypes of acid brown soil. Considering the fact that the production potential of the defined types of soil depends on the depth, skeleton and other physical characteristics which determine acception, keeping and moving of water and this means that the production value of the studied soils is in the direct correlation with physical-geographical conditions of the environment. Taking into account that solum is well developed and the low contents of skeleton, all the studied soil in the most widely spread types of <b>sessile</b> <b>oaks</b> in the area of N. P. „Đerdap”, are very productive natural habitats. The exception is acid brown soil, which characteristics vary as well as their production potential. Apart from a good production potential of the studied soils within this paper, sessile forests in the researched areas irrationally use production potential of the habitat. In the research area in the last 20 years, the processes of devitalizing and the appearance of decaying of <b>sessile</b> <b>oaks</b> are expressed. In the sessile forests of Serbia, there are forests of the production and protection character, and the structure of the sessile forests at global level is characterized by not normal state with domination of middle aged and in great extent mature withering ingredients, what is the main cause of insufficiently used good potential of the soil...|$|R
25|$|After {{the end of}} the Weichselian Ice Age (115,000 to 10,000 years ago) {{the first}} woods {{appeared}} in the area that now forms Lüneburg Heath which, following the natural ecological succession and encouraged by a gradual improvement in the climate, progressed from birch and pine forest through hazel woods to light woods of <b>sessile</b> <b>oaks.</b>|$|R
25|$|Along the Atlantic coast, birches (Betula species) form small {{enclaves}} or copses at {{the foot}} of rocky cliff edges or in the clearings of beech forests, on poor or acidic soils, accompanied by aspen (Populus tremula) and mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia). Birch may also grow in pure stands near the beech forests, in the mountainous areas on siliceous bedrock; these areas are typically of only small extent and generally quite patchy with <b>sessile</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus petraea) and trees of the genus Sorbus.|$|E
25|$|The reserve, {{in northeastern}} Poland, lies {{adjacent}} to the Belovezhskaya Pushcha Biosphere Reserve in Belarus. The forest complex, the last and largest remaining mixed deciduous primeval forest on the North European Plain, is situated in the transition between the hemiboreal and continental climate areas. The forest is composed of a mosaic of diverse communities, principally composed of grey willow (Salix cinerea), European hornbeam (Carpinus betulus), arctic dwarf birch (Betula humilis) English oak (Quercus robur), small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), Norway spruce (Picea abies), which reaches its southern limits in the northern hemisphere here, and <b>sessile</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus petraea), which reaches its northeastern limit here.|$|E
25|$|There are 35 {{tree species}} in the park, which is 32% of the 109 tree species found in Bulgaria. Coniferous woods form 68.3% of the forests and {{deciduous}} woods make up the other 31.7%. The distribution by species is as follows: European beach – 21.6%, dwarf mountain pine – 17.4%, Norway spruce – 16.7%, Scots pine – 14.6%, silver fir and Bulgarian fir – 12.7%, Macedonian pine – 6.9%, <b>sessile</b> <b>oak</b> and Rila oak – 4.6%, silver birch – 1.5%, common aspen – 1.3%, grey alder – 1.1%, other – 1.6%. The {{average age of the}} woods is 99 years; centenary forests form 53.7% of the total forest mass.|$|E
50|$|The valleys {{that border}} and {{cut through the}} Holzland are, in places, largely natural. Many, mighty {{sandstone}} rock formations outcrop on the valley sides. Hillsides and heights are covered by valuable mixed forest, except {{in the immediate vicinity}} of villages. The old <b>sessile</b> <b>oaks</b> harvested here, which are often several centuries old, earn the highest lumber prices overall.|$|R
50|$|This {{site has}} diverse {{habitats}} of woodland, meadows, scrub and hedges. The main trees are <b>sessile</b> <b>oaks,</b> hornbeams and sweet chestnut, and {{plants such as}} wood sorrel and are indicators of ancient woodland. The reserve {{is one of only}} 25 in the courty where the rare heath fritillary is well established. The hedges provide nesting sites for migrating birds such as whitethroats.|$|R
25|$|Farndale {{is famous}} for its wild daffodils in spring. Sheltered {{woodlands}} dominated by <b>sessile</b> <b>oaks</b> can be found to the south of the high ground. These woodland areas are the home of pied flycatchers, sparrow hawks and wood warblers. Roe and fallow deer can also be found here. The woodlands and south facing grasslands on the limestone belt provide a good habitat for many butterflies.|$|R
25|$|Oak forests, {{above all}} of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), {{are the most}} common in the Atlantic zone. They {{represent}} the typical forest floor formation of basal trees, extending to an altitude of some 600 metres. In higher regions, as one ascends the mountains, they yield to beech forests; {{at the bottom of the}} valleys they are replaced by ash trees and hazel tree groves. There are two main types of oak: the pedunculate oak and the <b>sessile</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus petraea). The latter extends furthest into the interior and highest in altitude, but plays a secondary part; in general, when the climate begins to show its continental character, these oak forests are replaced by Pyrenean oak.|$|E
25|$|Oak marble galls {{develop as}} a {{chemically}} induced distortion of leaf buds on pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), <b>sessile</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus petraea) or their hybrid Quercus × rosacea, trees, {{caused by the}} parthenogenetic gall wasp (Andricus kollari, (Hartig, 1843)) which lays eggs within leaf buds using their ovipositor. The Turkey oak (Quercus cerris), introduced into Britain in 1735, {{is required for the}} completion of the life cycle of the gall. The oak marble gall is frequently confused with the oak apple gall, caused by another gall wasp, Biorhiza pallida. Oak marble galls are also known as the bullet gall, oak nut or Devonshire gall. Synonyms for the species are Cynips kollari, Andricus quercusgemmae, A. minor, A. indigenus and A. circulans.|$|E
25|$|Forest {{ecosystems}} cover 70% of the park's territory. The lowest zones (800–1500m) are {{occupied with}} beech forests consisting primarily of European beech (Fagus sylvatica), riparian deciduous forests dominated by grey alder (Alnus incana) and mixed forests of beech, common hornbeam (Carpinus betulus) and hop hornbeam (Ostrya carpinifolia). Above these ecosystems are located xerothermic oak forests, {{dominated by the}} local endemic Rila oak (Quercus protoroburoides) and <b>sessile</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus petraea), whose upper zones are covered by European beech, European silver fir (Abies alba) and Bulgarian fir (Abies borisii-regis). Coniferous ecosystems occupy altitudes between 1300 and 2200m and consist of Norway spruce (Picea abies), Macedonian pine (Pinus peuce), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and firs. Secondary ecosystems that replace primeval forests cover 5% of the park consist mainly of common aspen (Populus tremula), silver birch (Betula pendula) and common hazel (Corylus avellana) replacing spruce and pine forests.|$|E
50|$|Clatworthy {{reservoir}} {{features a}} range of habitats including acid grassland, Fox glove, broadleaf woodlands and scrub leading to marshy areas around the inlet streams. Clatworthy woodland is mainly beech with <b>sessile</b> <b>oaks,</b> silver birch and rowan. The site is home to {{a range of}} passage and woodland birds as well as geese, grebes and swans. Red deer, roe deer and badgers are often seen in the woods.|$|R
50|$|At this time, {{many species}} were {{growing in the}} park, {{including}} park include: elms, <b>sessile</b> <b>oaks,</b> pyramidal English oaks, ailanthi, horse-chestnuts, sugar maples, maple trees, birches, Siberian peashrubs, purple hazels , purple European beeches, Kentucky coffeetrees, grandiflora hortensias , kerrias, magnolias, American sycamores, peony bushes, black locusts, robinias, snowberry bushes, large-leaved lindens, small-leaved lindens, yews, pines, black pines, Caucasian walnuts, cypresses, London planetrees and other trees and shrubs.|$|R
50|$|The {{forest is}} {{exceptionally}} damp, creating the perfect habitat for nature to flourish. There are over 200 species of liverwort, {{many forms of}} moss and lichen too. Trees include <b>Sessile</b> <b>Oaks,</b> as well as Beech, Rowan and Silver Birch. Lichens form on these birch, such as Graphina ruiziana and Parmeliella Horrescens. However, the conditions are not kind to flowering plants, due to the shady and damp nature of the environment.|$|R
25|$|The heath and its {{surrounding}} area belong to those regions of the North German Plain in which the hunter culture of the Mesolithic era was superseded quite early on by Neolithic farmers. By about 3000 BC, during the Neolithic, large open areas appeared on the lightly undulating, sandy stretches of geest on Lüneburg Heath. This {{was a result of}} the intensive grazing of the <b>sessile</b> <b>oak</b> woods and the associated destruction of successive new stands of trees. These open areas became dominated by the common heather (Calluna vulgaris), a largely grazing-resistant species of plant. Nevertheless, oak and beech woods succeeded time and again in establishing themselves wherever man left areas of heath untended. Over {{a long period of time}} the region of Lüneburg Heath alternated between periods when the heathlands spread and dominated the scene and times when it was largely covered with forest and only small areas of heath existed. Finally, after the migration period, the wooded areas of the region increased considerably.|$|E
500|$|The South Exmoor SSSI is smaller, {{covering}} [...] {{and including}} the River Barle and its tributaries with submerged plants such as alternate water-milfoil (Myriophyllum alterniflorum). There are small areas of semi-natural woodland within the site, including some which are ancient. The most abundant tree species is <b>sessile</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus petraea), the shrub layer is very sparse and the ground flora includes bracken, bilberry {{and a variety of}} mosses. The heaths have strong breeding populations of birds, including whinchat (Saxicola rubetra) and European stonechat (Saxicola rubicola). Wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe) are common near stone boundary walls and other stony places. Grasshopper warbler (Locustella naevia) breed in scrub and tall heath. Trees on the moorland edges provide nesting sites for Lesser redpoll (Acanthis cabaret), common buzzard (Buteo buteo) and raven (Corvus corax).|$|E
500|$|Dunkery Beacon is {{the summit}} of Dunkery Hill, and the highest point on Exmoor and in Somerset.

The site has been visited by humans since the Bronze Age with several burial mounds {{in the form of}} cairns and bowl barrows. Sweetworthy on the lower slopes is the site of two Iron Age hill forts or enclosures and a deserted medieval settlement. At the top of Selworthy Beacon is a National Trust plaque and a view of the south coast of Wales across the Bristol Channel. The South West Coast Path also climbs the hill and ends slightly shy of the summit. Its elevation is [...] Behind the hill, there are precipitous cliffs. Near the summit are a series of cairns, thought to be the remains of round barrows, and the Iron Age Bury Castle. The round cairns have been scheduled as an ancient monument. In the 16th century, Selworthy Beacon was [...] the site of a beacon to warn of impending invasions. The mausoleum of Sir Thomas Dyke Acland is about [...] from Selworthy Beacon. The hills have a deep purple colour during the summer due to the covering of heather. Ling and bell heather, gorse, <b>sessile</b> <b>oak,</b> ash, rowan, hazel, bracken, mosses, liverworts, lichens and ferns all grow here or in surrounding woodland, as well as some unique whitebeam species.

In the Reserve there are different kinds of wood: from turkey copses and abandoned chestnut woods to parts of more rare woodlands like <b>oak</b> woods with <b>sessile</b> <b>oaks,</b> turkey oaks and english oaks. Because of the extremely varied morphology there are many species of vegetation: linden and gentians, typical of the cold climates, and Mediterranean plants such as tree heath, service tree, whitebeam, Pyrus pyraster, hawthorn, sea buckthorn, laburnum and blackthorn.Even undergrowth plants can appear on this territory, including Malus florentina, Sorbus torminalis, medlar, hazelnuts and white alder.|$|R
2500|$|The park {{is perhaps}} most famous for its oak {{woodland}}s, which are about [...] in size. They form the largest area of native woodland remaining in Ireland and are a remnant of the woodland that once covered much of Ireland. Derrycunihy Wood {{is perhaps the most}} natural <b>sessile</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus petraea) wood in Ireland. Most of the oak woodlands are located on the lower slopes of the Shehy and Tomy mountains, adjacent to Lough Leane. They are typically dominated by <b>sessile</b> <b>oak,</b> which favours the acidic soils of the sandstone mountains. The woods have Annex I status in the EU Habitats Directive because of their diverse and rich flora, most notably their bryophytes (mosses and liverworts).|$|E
2500|$|This drought was {{intensified}} by the exceptional heat that occurred all through it. Records were {{set for the}} heat {{as well as the}} lack of rain, resulting in very high evaporation rates. From 23 June, temperatures were over [...] for two consecutive weeks around the United Kingdom, peaking at [...] in June on the 28th at Mayflower Park in Southampton. This still is the highest ever June temperature since records began. The highest temperature in the summer was [...] at Cheltenham on 3 July. The effects of the drought included substantial and long-lasting changes to the tree composition of forests. European Beech was severely affected by the drought and took around twenty years to recover. To date, their growth has failed to recover completely, reaching only about 75% of their pre-drought growth rates, even decades after the drought. Additionally, death due to drought resulted in the loss of around 15% of the mature beech trees in the forest. In contrast, <b>sessile</b> <b>oak</b> did not suffer any death or growth suppression due to drought, but instead benefited from reduced competition with beech. <b>Sessile</b> <b>oak</b> growth increased suddenly after the drought and remained unusually high until the 1990s, when beech recovered and regained dominance. European Beech dominates temperate forests over large areas of Europe, but is considered to be particularly drought sensitive and is predicted to be outcompeted by more drought tolerant species in many regions as the climate warms.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the lower}} {{slopes of the}} {{mountains}} are dominated by <b>sessile</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus petraea), above [...] the mountains are virtually treeless and are dominated by blanket bog and wet heath.

Large-flowered butterwort (Pinguicula grandiflora) is common. The bogs also support a number of notable species, including mosses (Sphagnum pulchrum, S. fuscum, S. platyphyllum, S. strictum, S. contortum and Calliergon stramineum), liverworts (Cladopodiella francisci and Calypogeia azurea) and lichens (Cladonia mediterranea, C. macilenta, C. rangiferina, C. arbuscula and Cetraria islandica).|$|E
