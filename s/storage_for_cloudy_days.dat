However, NSR is seldom measured due to the technical and economical limitations associated with direct measurements. An artificial neural network (ANN) technique with Levenberg–Marquardt learning algorithm was used to estimate NSR for a tropical mangrove forest of Indian Sundarban with routinely measured meteorological variables. The {{root mean square error}} (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), modelling efficiency (ME), coefficient of residual mass (CRM) and coefficient of determination (R 2) between ANN estimated and measured NSR were 37  W m− 2, 26  W m− 2, 0. 95, 0. 017 and 0. 97 respectively under all-weather conditions.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to propose and evaluate a new approach to overcome the major limitation of downscaling methods based on optical/thermal data, particularly the DlSaggregation based on Physical And Theoretical scale Change (DISPATCH) algorithm. Data collected over an agricultural site located in Winnipeg (Manitoba, Canada) during the SMAP Validation Experiments 2012 (SMAPVEXI 2) field campaign were used. At this site, SMOS soil moisture estimates showed a relatively good correlation for both AM and PM overpasses (R >= 0. 67), but with a significant underestimation (bias approximate to - 0. 10 m(3) /m(3)), when compared to ground data. SMOS soil moisture data also showed a significant sensitivity to rainfall events. The DISPATCH algorithm was used to downscale bias-corrected SMOS soil moisture data over the study area for the cloud-free days during SMAPVEXI 2. Compared to ground data, DISPATCH performed well, especially with the soil evaporative efficiency (SEE) linear model (R = 0. 81, bias = - 0. 01 m(3) /m(3), RMSE = 0. 05 m(3) /m(3)), which slightly outperformed the SEE non-linear model (R = 0. 72, bias = - 0. 01 m(3) /m(3), RMSE = 0. 06 m(3) /m(3)). For both models, the accuracy of the downscaling soil moisture is inversely proportional to the absolute value of soil moisture. <b>For</b> <b>cloudy</b> <b>days,</b> a new operational downscaling approach was proposed.

40|$|Potential Evapotranspiration (PET) {{is used as}} {{a common}} input to {{calculate}} evaporative demand in hydrological, ecological and biological modeling. Dynamic and distributed measurement of PET is important for improved hydrologic predictions at the watershed scale since PET varies with time and space. In this work, an advanced dynamic PET estimation is proposed by integrating geostationary satellite products into a currently existing remote sensing-based PET algorithm and evaluated in the framework of operational hydrologic forecasting modeling. The development work is approached through a series of studies. At first, a previously developed Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) based PET (MODIS-PET) product applied over several flux towers and basins in the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) to determine its applicability and predictive ability in comparison to other ground based distributed PET methods. Results from this primary study indicate the MODIS-PET is an improved PET estimation method compared to the other two contemporary distributed PET products that were tested over this geographically complex study region. In addition to elevation and cloud cover, uncertainties are associated with the MODIS-PET algorithm pertaining from three model variables; land surface temperature, air temperature and surface emissivity. The crude hypothetical sinusoidal curve considered in the conversion of instantaneous MODIS-PET to the daily PET estimation can potentially be replaced with satellite data with improved temporal resolution. Hence, integration of Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES), a series of geostationary satellites with frequent observations, data in the MODIS-PET algorithm is performed in the second part. The coupling of GOES within the MODIS-PET algorithm shows significant improvement over the previously developed stand-alone MODIS-PET product, especially <b>for</b> <b>cloudy</b> <b>days</b> and high temperature pixels. Finally, evaluation of these two remote sensing products (merged GOES-MODIS and stand-alone MODIS) is undertaken as lumped input in the National Weather Service (NWS) River Forecasting Centers (RFC) operational forecasting models in two mountainous watersheds from the UCRB. The preliminary results show that PETs estimated using the satellite data is a suitable replacement of the static PET in the snow-dominated basins of the UCRB region. The new remote-sensing PET available in near-real-time which we advocate will ultimately provide more reasonable representation of current climatological conditions for streamflow forecasting, drought monitoring and crop water demand...|$|R

Canberra, Australia: Modelling and Simulation Society of Australia and New ZealandEstimation {{of actual}} {{evapotranspiration}} (AET) and its spatial distribution {{are important to}} understanding of catchment hydrology. The AET is driven by net energy available to evaporate water from soil and vegetation surfaces, and to transpirate water from vegetation. However, estimating AET is difficult as the evapotranspiration process involves complex physical and biological processes. It is further complicated when there is lack of measured meteorological variables data which are required for estimation. These data are essential to quantify the availability of net energy and the aerodynamic effects of the evapotranspiration process. Remote sensing (RS) data, which are widely available and easily accessible than the measured ground data, {{can be used to}} estimate the availability of net energy for AET. However, still some measured ground data are required to quantify the aerodynamic effects on AET. In this study, remote sensing data and readily available climate datasets were used as inputs to an energy balance technique to estimate AET, {{as an alternative to the}} traditional ET estimation procedures, which require measured hydrometeorological data. The Macalister subcatchment in the Thomson catchment in Victoria (Australia) was used as the case study considering the study period from January 2003 to December 2008. Reflectance and radiance data of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Terra satellite were the primary source of RS data. Tilted and absent images of Terra MODIS were replaced with Aqua satellite data. First, vegetation indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Leaf Area Index, fractional vegetation coverage and broadband albedo were calculated based on MODIS reflectance data for non-cloudy days. Similarly, MODIS radiance data were used to generate daily surface temperature on non-cloudy days. Vegetation indices and surface temperature were then used in the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) to estimate AET for non-cloudy days. However, SEBS requires data on a limited number of meteorological variables to quantify the aerodynamic effect of AET, and those data were obtained from ground measurements and global climate datasets (i. e. IWMI climate and water atlas). Once the AET was estimated for non-cloudy days, eostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) data were used to calculate fractional cloud cover and used to estimate net radiation available <b>for</b> <b>cloudy</b> <b>day</b> AET. The accuracy of the non-cloudy and <b>cloudy</b> <b>day</b> AET estimated using RS data was studied using root mean square error (RMSE) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (Ef), by considering Penman-Monteith (PM) based AET as the observed AET, at four different sites in the atchment. A crop coefficient was used to convert PM based reference crop evapotranspiration to PM based AET. Remote sensing based AET shows higher coefficient of determination (R 2) compared to PM based AET on non-cloudy days and comparatively less R 2 on <b>cloudy</b> <b>days.</b> Results revealed that RS based AET overestimated during non-cloudy days, especially when the AET is more than 3 mm/day. However, RS based AET underestimated during partial and total cloud days. The above observations are common to all selected sites. Similar observations were seen with RMSE and Ef at all sites. The results show that remote sensing data and global climate dataset can be successfully used to estimate AET for the catchments where required ground measured meteorological data are not available. The estimated AET can be used as input to streamflow simulation models to generate streamflow in data poor catchments...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Global {{radiation}} {{is an important}} input for evaporation calculations; however, limited measurements exist. Current models for estimating global radiation are deterministic and do not give {{an estimate of the}} errors associated with the predicted radiation amounts. In this thesis, five stochastic models are developed to estimate the mean amount and associated uncertainty of global, direct and diffuse radiation from sunshine duration data. The modelled global {{radiation is}} used to estimate evaporation amounts using a variety of models, including the Penman-Monteith model, radiation-based models, and temperature-based models. Evaporation estimates are compared to determine the influence of uncertainty in the global radiation estimate on evaporation amounts. The second part of this thesis deals with the relationship between temperature and evaporation, with implications for anthropogenic climate change studies. The influence of temperature on evaporation amounts is analysed using a combination of empirical evaporation models and a more physically-based planetary boundary layer model. The results indicate that global radiation can be accurately estimated using all of the developed radiation models (average error = 9 %), when compared with measured data. The variance of the errors is greater <b>for</b> <b>cloudy</b> <b>days</b> compared with clear days. The diffuse radiation component is best modelled using a quadratic model (average error = 22 %). The direct radiation component is best modelled using a linear model (average error = 23 %). Two types of regional models are also developed to calculate radiation amounts at any location. These models have only a small loss of accuracy compared to the locally calibrated models. While the variance of the errors for the locally calibrated models is shown to be location dependent, these regional models allow for the model parameters and the error variance to be estimated at any location, as there is a statistically significant relationship between the model and error parameters and latitude. The regional models are also comparable in accuracy to satellite estimates of global radiation. It is also found that the uncertainty in global radiation leads to considerable uncertainty in evaporation rates, up to ± 31 % for the radiation-based models. The locations with greater uncertainty in the radiation estimate have an associated greater uncertainty in the evaporation estimate. Temperature increases are shown to have minor influences on evaporation rates. Soil moisture is the most dominant influence. Consequently, temperature-based models are shown to lead to unreasonable estimates of evaporation when temperatures are increased...|$|R

Additionally, five configurations of sun tracking systems have been considered while a seasonal and a yearly optimum slope have been applied to those based on rotating axes systems.

Ten years data sets of one hour temporal resolution for several meteorological sites of Russian north-west region are used. Known and novel interrelationships between various atmospheric and linked soil variables are reviewed. The revealed relationships between solar downward radiation fluxes and soil temperature diurnal patterns allow to simulate all principal elements of surface energy exchange: long-wave outgoing radiation fluxes in the atmosphere, soil heat fluxes, sensible, turbulent and latent heat fluxes.

(2) Long wave : The downward long wave radiation on a <b>cloudy</b> <b>day</b> increases from that on a clear day, because of additional emission from the cloud. In addition, since the air temperature is very low and the water vapor contained in the atmosphere is very little on a clear day, the equivalent black body temperature of the {{downward radiation}} is very low so that the difference of downward radiation between clear and <b>cloudy</b> <b>days</b> is large.

The OLTC's operation is studiedin two different weather conditions - sunny and <b>cloudy</b> <b>days.</b> The aspects analysed are the OLTC's time delay setting, PV penetration levels and PV installation location. The {{results suggest that the}} number of tap changes in a <b>cloudy</b> <b>day</b> is approximately 1. 5 times higher than in a sunny day. In addition, at 50 % PV penetration level on a <b>cloudy</b> <b>day,</b> the OLTC operation increases by 38 % and it is doubled at 100 % penetration...|$|R
