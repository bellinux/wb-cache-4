In this article, the authors show that such local modifications {{can be used to}} selectively induce further localized growth of silicon nanocrystals. First, a-Si:H films by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition on nickel/glass substrates are prepared. After the FE-MISPC process, yielding both conductive and non-conductive nano-pits in the films, the second silicon layer at the boundary condition of amorphous and microcrystalline growth is deposited. Comparing AFM morphology and current-sensing AFM data on the first and second layers, it is observed that the second deposition changes the morphology and increases the local conductivity of FE-MISPC-induced pits by up to an order of magnitude irrespective of their prior conductivity. This is attributed to the silicon nanocrystals (< 100 nm) that tend to nucleate and grow inside the pits. This is also supported by micro-Raman spectroscopy.|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the effects of local Ge-insertion in a-Si films on <b>solid-phase</b> <b>crystallization</b> (SPC). Experiments were performed by using three types of stacked structures, i. e., (a) a-Si/a-Ge/a-Si/SiO_ 2, (b) a-Si/a-Ge/SiO_ 2, and (c) SiO_ 2 /a-Ge/a-Si/SiO_ 2. These samples were annealed at 600 °C. The results for the structure (a) with Ge films of 5 nm, Ge atoms were completely diffused into a-Si regions, and no-enhanced SPC was detected. However, if Ge thickness was increased to 15 nm, Ge atoms were localized. Such phenomena became significant by (b) and- (c) structures even for samples with Ge films of 5 nm. In addition, significant enhancement of SPC of a-Si was found. These results indicated that crystal nucleation was initiated at Ge layers, and then propagated into a-Si layer.

MLG was formed on a SiO 2 substrate at 800 °C for 10 min; however, it disappeared during wet etching for removing Co.

30|$|Recently, our {{previous}} {{studies have shown that}} field-enhanced [4, 5] metal-induced [3] <b>solid-phase</b> <b>crystallization</b> (FE-MISPC) at room temperature can be used to achieve spatially localized current-induced crystallization of a-Si:H films using a sharp tip such as those employed in atomic force microscopy (AFM) [10]. This process resulted in the formation of microscopic crystalline rings and dots as well as resistive nano-pits at controlled positions in the a-Si:H thin films. The smallest sizes of the crystallized objects ranged from a few hundred nanometers to several micrometers due to electrical discharge from the inherently present parallel capacitance, caused by a drastic increase of local material conductivity (and hence a decrease of potential difference on the parallel capacitance) after the dielectric breakdown of the films. The process was then further miniaturized below 100 nm by limiting the passing current (which was fluctuating below a given set-point) and thus also the electrical discharge between the conductive AFM tip and bottom nickel electrode [11]. On the other hand, perfectly stabilized electrical current during FE-MISPC process produced mainly non-conductive pits [12].|$|E

Previous attempts to fabricate Si nanocrystals failed to achieve control over their shape and crystallographic orientation, the latter property being important in systems such as Si quantum dots.
