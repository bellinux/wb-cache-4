A partially purified model system of gelation and contraction (S 6) was prepared from the contracted pellets, {{and the presence of}} calcium- and pH-sensitive gelation and contraction in this model demonstrated that a functional cytoskeletal-contratile complex remained at least partially associated with the actin and myosin during contraction. Semi-quantitative assays of gelation and <b>solation</b> in the myosin-free preparation S 6 included measurements of turbidity, relative viscosity, and strain birefringence. The extent of gelation was optimal at pH 6. 8 and a free calcium ion concentration of approximately 3. 0 x 10 (- 8) M. <b>Solation</b> was favored when the free calcium ion concentration was greater than 7. 6 x 10 (- 7) M or when the pH was increased or decreased from pH 6. 8. Gelation was reversibly inhibited by increasing the free calcium ion concentration to approxomately 4. 6 x 10 (- 6) M at pH 6. 8. The solation-gelation process of this model has been interpreted to involve the reversible cross- linking of actin filaments. The addition of purified D. discoideum myosin to S 6 served to reconstitute calcium- and pH-regulated contraction. The results from this study indicate that contraction is coupled functionally to the local breakdown (<b>solation)</b> of the gel. Therefore, <b>solation</b> has been identified as a structural requirement for extensive shortening during contraction. We have called this concept the solation-contraction coupling hypothesis. Fractionation of a preparation derived from the contracted pellets yielded a fraction consisting of actin and a 95, 000 -dalton polypeptide that exhibited calcium-sensitive gelation at 28 degrees C and a fraction composed of actin and 30, 000 - and 18, 000 -dalton polypeptides that demonstrated calcium-sensitive genlation at 0 degrees C...|$|E
40|$|Many {{problems}} having enormous search spaces can nevertheless {{be solved}} because {{only a very}} small fraction of that space need be traversed to find the needed <b>solation(s).</b> The ability of assumption-based truth maintenance systems to rapidly switch and compare contexts is an advantage for such problems, but existing ATMS techniques generally perform badly on them. This paper describes a new strategy, the implied-by strategy, for using the ATMS that efficiently supports problem solving in domains which are infinite and where the inference engine must retain tight control in the course of problem-solving. We describe the three mechanisms required to implement this strategy: focus environments, implied-by consumers, and contradiction consumers. Wecompare the implied-by strategy to previous ATMS strategies, and demonstrate its effectiveness by performance comparisons in two simple domains. Finally, we discuss the implications for parallel processing and future ATMS design. ...|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a reconstituted gel-sol and contractile model system that mimics the structure and dynamics found at the ectoplasm/endoplasm interface in the tails of many amoeboid cells. We tested the role of gel-sol transformations of the actin-based cytoskeleton in the regulation of contraction and in the generation of endoplasm from ectoplasm. In a model system with fully phosphorylated myosin II, we demonstrated that either decreasing the actin filament length distribution or decreasing the extent of actin filament cross-linking initiated both a weakening of the gel strength and contraction. However, streaming of the solated gel components occurred only under conditions where the length distribution of actin was decreased, causing a self-destruct process of continued <b>solation</b> and contraction of the gel. These results offer significant support that gel strength {{plays an important role}} in the regulation of actin/myosin II-based contractions of the tail cortex in many amoeboid cells as defined by the solation-contraction coupling hypothesis (Taylor, D. L., and M. Fechheimer. 1982. Phil. Trans. Soc. Lond. B. 299 : 185 - 197). The competing processes of <b>solation</b> and contraction of the gel would appear to be mutually exclusive. However, it is the temporal-spatial balance of the rate and extent of two stages of <b>solation,</b> coupled to contraction, that can explain the conversion of gelled ectoplasm in the tail to a solated endoplasm within the same small volume, generation of a force for the retraction of tails, maintenance of cell polarity, and creation of a positive hydrostatic pressure to push against the newly formed endoplasm.

These extracts gelled on warming to 25 degrees Celsius and contracted in response to micromolar Ca++ or a pH in excess of 7. 0. Optimal gelation occurred in a solution containing 2. 5 mM ethylene glycol-bis (β-aminoethyl ether) N,N,N',N'-tetraacetate (EGTA), 2. 5 mM piperazine-N-N'-bis [2 -ethane sulfonic acid] (PIPES), 1 mM MgC 1 (2), 1 mM ATP, and 20 mM KCI at ph 7. 0 (relaxation solution), while micromolar levels of Ca++ inhibited gelation. Conditions that solated the gel elicited contraction of extracts containing myosin. This was true regardless of whether chemical (micromolar Ca++, pH > 7. 0, cytochalasin B, elevated concentrations of KCI, MgC 1 (2), and sucrose) or physical (pressure, mechanical stress, and cold) means were used to induce <b>solation.</b> Myosin was definitely required for contraction. During Ca++-or pH-elicited contraction: (a) actin, myosin, and a 95, 000 -dalton polypeptide were concentrated in the contracted extract; (b) the gelation activity was recovered in the material sqeezed out the contracting extract;(c) electron microscopy demonstrated {{that the number of}} free, recognizable F-actin filaments increased; (d) the actomyosin MgATPase activity was stimulated by 4 - to 10 -fold. In the absense of myosin the Dictyostelium extract did not contract, while gelation proceeded normally. During <b>solation</b> of the gel in the absense of myosin: (a) electron microscopy demonstrated that the number of free, recognizable F- actin filaments increased; (b) solation-dependent contraction of the extract and the Ca++-stimulated MgATPase activity were reconstituted by adding puried Dictyostelium myosin. Actin purified from the Dictyostelium extract did not gel (at 2 mg/ml), while low concentrations of actin (0. 7 - 2 mg/ml) that contained several contaminating components underwent rapid Ca++ regulated gelation. These results indicated : (a) gelation in Dictyostelium extracts involves a specific Ca++-sensitive interaction between actin and several other components; (b) myosin is an absolute requirement for contraction of the extract; (c) actin-myosin interactions capable of producing force for movement are prevented in the gel, while <b>solation</b> of the gel by either physical or chemical means results in the release of F-actin capable of interaction with myosin and subsequent contraction.

40|$|The {{report that}} microvillar cores of isolated, demembranated brush borders retract into the {{terminal}} web {{in the presence}} of Ca(++) and ATP has been widely cited as an example of Ca(++) -regulated nonmuscle cell motility. Because of recent findings that microvillar core actin filaments are cross-linked by villin which, {{in the presence of}} micromolar Ca(++), fragments actin filaments, we used the techniques of video enhanced differential interference contrast, immunofluorescence, and phase contrast microscopy and thin-section electron microscopy (EM) to reexamine the question of contraction of isolated intestinal cell brush borders. Analysis of video enhanced light microscopic images of Triton- demembranated brush borders treated with a buffered Ca(++) solution shows the cores disintegrating with the terminal web remaining intact; membranated brush borders show the microvilli to vesiculate with Ca(++). Using Ca(++) /EGTA buffers, it is found that micromolar free Ca(++) causes core filament dissolution in membranated or demembranated brush borders, Ca(++) causes microvillar core <b>solation</b> followed by complete vesiculation of the microvillar membrane. The lengths of microvilli cores and rootlets were measured in thin sections of membranated and demembranated controls, in Ca(++) -, Ca(++) + ATP-, and in ATP-treated brush borders. Results of these measurements show that Ca(++) alone causes the complete <b>solation</b> of the microvillar cores, yet the rootlets in the terminal web region remain of normal length. These results show that microvilli do not retract into the terminal web in response to Ca(++) and ATP but rather that the microvillar cores disintegrate. NBD-phallicidin localization of actin and fluorescent antibodies to myosin reveal a circumferential band of actin and myosin in mildly permeabilized cells in the region of the junctional complex. The presence of these contractile proteins in this region, where other studies have shown a circumferential band of thin filaments, is consistent with the hypothesis that brush borders may be motile through the circumferential constriction of this “contractile ring,” and is also consistent with the observations that ATP-treated brush borders become cup shaped as {{if there had been a}} circumferential constriction...|$|E
40|$|Brevin is {{a protein}} which regulates the actin gel-sol transformation: it severs F-actin {{filaments}} into shorter ones. This action is Ca-dependent and is prevented by tropomyosin.

We observed a marked increase of the velocity of shortening {{in the presence of}} brevin.

40|$|In the {{presence}} of aldosterone, plasma sodium in the high physiological range stiffens endothelial cells and reduces the release of nitric oxide. We now demonstrate effects of extracellular potassium on stiffness of individual cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells by using the tip of an atomic force microscope as a mechanical nanosensor.

A high physiological sodium concentration, in {{the presence}} of aldosterone, prevents these changes. We propose that the potassium effects are caused by submembranous cortical fluidization because cortical actin depolymerization induced by cytochalasin D mimics the effect of high potassium.

In three tumours loss of both alleles of this gene (homozygous deletion) was detected. Two of these, both leiomyosarcomas, contained a chromosomal breakpoint within the RB 1 gene, while in the third tumour, a radiation induced sarcoma, complete deletion was observed. Using a probe that detects a polymorphic locus within the RB 1 gene we found loss of only one allele (heterozygous deletion) in 33 % of soft tissue sarcomas examined, including two leiomyosarcomas, a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour, a rhabdomyosarcoma and a chondrosarcoma.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{report that}} microvillar cores of isolated, demembranated brush borders retract into the {{terminal}} web {{in the presence}} of Ca ++ and ATP has been widely cited as an example of Ca++-regulated nonmuscle cell motility. Because of recent findings that microvillar core actin filaments are cross-linked by villin which, {{in the presence of}} micromolar Ca ++, fragments actin filaments, we used the techniques of video enhanced differential interference contrast, immunofluorescence, and phase contrast microscopy and thin-section electron microscopy (EM) to reexamine the question of contraction of isolated intestinal cell brush borders. Analysis of video enhanced light microscopic images of Triton-demembranated brush borders treated with a buffered Ca ++ solution shows the cores disintegrating with the terminal web remaining intact; membranated brush borders show the microvilli to vesiculate with Ca ++. Using Ca++/ EGTA buffers, it is found that micromolar free Ca ++ causes core filament dissolution in membranated or demembranated brush borders while the rootlets are insensitive to this Ca ++ effect.

The absorption spectrum, emission spectrum, and fluorescence lifetime of the solution were measured. Very obvious characteristic fluorescence peaks were observed at 898 and 1058 nm. Based on Judd-Ofelt theory, three intensity parameters were obtained: Omega(2) = 4. 9 x 10 (- 20) cm(2), Omega(4) = 5. 1 x 10 (- 20) cm(2) and Omega(6) = 2. 5 x 10 (- 20) cm(2). Line strengths S-cal, oscillator strengths f(cal), radiative transition probabilities A(ed), radiative lifetimes tau(r) and branch ratios beta were calculated too. The measured lifetime tau of 1058 nm peak is 460 mu s, and that of 898 nm 505 mu s. Comparison between theoretically computed radiative lifetime tau(r) (682 mu s) and the measured lifetime indicates that the non-radiative transition probability of the solution is very low and the fluorescence quantum efficiency very high. High values of three intensity parameters prove the high asymmetric surroundings of Nd 3 +, which is important for Nd 3 + to absorb the excitation energy. Spectropic quality factor Omega(4) /Omega(6) > 1 makes radiation at 898 nm stronger than at 1058 nm...|$|E
40|$|Print OnlyAn {{electrically}} conducting Newtonian fluid is squeezed {{between two}} parallel infinite axisymmetric discs {{placed in an}} orthogonal magnetic field. Both discs are permeable. The upper disc is allowed to rotate in its own plane while moving freely along the z-axis. The lower disc is fixed {{with respect to the}} z-axis, but is allowed to rotate within its own plane. This paper addresses two cases, the first where each disc is set at a constant uniform temperature, the temperature of the upper disc being higher than the temperature of the lower disc. Using a similarity <b>solation</b> for small Reynolds numbers, analytical and numerical solutions are derived through which the effects of the permeability on the temperature and heat transfer profiles of the fluid film are studied. In the first case, the heat transfer profile is affected by the disc permeability up to the limiting where the discs rotate at the same speed. The temperature profile however is unaffected. In the second case considered, the lower disc is subjected to a heat flux whilst keeping the upper disc at a uniform constant temperature. In the second case, analytical and numerical solutions show that although the temperature and heat transfer profiles are influenced by the temperature ratio of the disc, they however remain unaffected by disc rotation and disc permeability.

We have obtained best fits for depthsof faul ting between 30 and 39 km; the results are consistent with the previous results for o ther lobate scarps on Mercury. The so-derived fault depths have been used to calculate surface heat flows for the time of faulting, taking into account crustal heat source sand a heterogeneous surface temperature due to the variable in <b>solation</b> pattern.

Both BDT depth sand heat flows are consistent with the predictions of thermal history models for the range of time relevant for scarp formation...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} several structural {{aspects of the}} intestinal epithelial brush border from rachitic chicks. At both the light and electron microscope levels, rachitic brush borders are indistinguishable from controls. Although several of the prominent periodic acid-Schiff-positive proteins of the brush border membrane have slightly slower mobilities on sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gels than do corresponding proteins from control brush borders, the major components of the microvillus core, including subunits of 105, 95, and 68 kilodaltons, actin, and calmodulin, are not detectably different. As assayed by a 125 I-labeled calmodulin gel overlay technique, the same calmodulin-binding proteins are present in rachitic and control brush borders. Two proteins, the 105 -kilodalton subunit of the microvillus core and an approximately 30 -kilodalton membrane protein, bind calmodulin in a calcium-independent manner. Four cytoskeletal proteins (250, 190, 180, and 150 kilodaltons) and one membrane protein (35 kilodaltons) bind calmodulin only {{in the presence of}} calcium. Calcium-dependent <b>solation</b> of microvillus core proteins and calcium-dependent phosphorylation of the 20 -kilodalton light chain of brush border myosin both occur as in controls. Our results show that rachintic chicks have brush borders that are quite similar to controls with respect to their ultrastructural organization, constituent contractile proteins, and calcium-dependent regulation of contractility and microvillus core structure. Therefore, the decreased absorption of calcium by intestinal epithelial cells in rachitic chicks is probably not due to gross structural or chemical differences in the brush border cytoskeleton...|$|E
40|$|The {{interactions}} between ferric ions and the anticancer antibiotic adriamycin {{have been investigated}} by Fe- 57 Mossbauer and electronic spectroscopies. The Mossbauer parameters are markedly dependent on the preparation procedure, the equilibration time, the metal-to-ligand ratio, and the concentration of the drag. At millimolar drag concentration, the 4. 2 K Mossbauer spectra exhibit a broad Fe(III) magnetic sextet attributed to polynuclear aggregates of high magnetic anisotropy, and a quadrupole split Fe(III) doublet attributed to a species of lower magnetic anisotropy, which exhibits superparamagnetic behavior. The two species are in equilibrium, {{as indicated by the}} time evolution of both Mossbauer and electronic spectra. At 3. 0 10 (- 5) M drag concentration, when adriamycin is mainly monomeric, the 4. 2 K Mossbauer spectra exhibit a quadrupole split doublet, connected with a superparamagnetic system, as for the concentrated preparations, and a broad magnetic sextet whose relative area increases with aging. The species responsible for this sextet should be some polymerizable hydrolysis product of the Fe(III) ions present in the dilate <b>solation.</b> In addition, the presence of a transient Fe(II) quadrupole doublet, both in this preparation and when the [Fe]/[ADR] ratio is 1 : 5 at millimolar drag concentration, is explained with the known intramolecular one-electron redox reaction which ferric-adriamycin undergoes under anaerobic conditions. The present results confirm that adriamycin is markedly more reactive than daunomycin due to its hydroxymethyl side-chain, and suggest that the stacking of the drug molecules plays a role in the observed cooperative phenomena...|$|E
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{for developing a}} simple theoretical model for calculating global insolation on a horizontal surface is described in this paper. The input parameters to the model are the latitude of the desired location {{and the amount of}} total precipitable water content in the vertical column at that location. Both the parameters are easily measurable with inexpensive instrument such as global positioning system (GPS). The principal idea behind the paper is to have-a model {{that could be used for}} designing a photo voltaic system quickly and within reasonable accuracy. The model in this paper has been developed using measured data from 12 locations in India covering length and breadth of the country over a period of 9 - 22 years. The model is validated by calculating theoretical global insolation for five locations, one in north (New Delhi), one in south (Thir-uvanandapuram),one in east (Kolkata), one in west (Mumbai) and one in central (Nagpur) part of India and comparing them with the measured in <b>solation</b> values for these five locations. The measured values of all these locations had been considered for developing the model. The model is further validated for a location (Goa) whose measured data is not considered for developing the model, by comparing the calculated and measured values of the insolation. Over the range of latitudes covering most parts of India, the error is within 20 % of the measured value. This gives the credibility of the model and the methodology used for developing the model for any region in the world...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Serum-deprived Swiss 3 T 3 {{fibroblasts}} constitutively form stress fibers {{at their}} edges. These fibers move centripetally towards the perinuclear region where they disassemble. Serum stimulation causes shortening of fibers {{in a manner}} suggesting active actin-myosin-based contraction (Giuliano, K. A. and D. L. Taylor. 1990. Cell Motil. and Cytoskeleton. 16 : 14 - 21). To elucidate the role of actin-based gel structure in these movements, we {{examined the effects of}} disrupting actin organization with cytochalasin. Serum-deprived fibroblasts were microinjected with rhodamine analogs of actin or myosin II and fiber dynamics were monitored with a multimode light microscope workstation using video-enhanced contrast and fluorescence modes. When cells were perfused with> 3 I,M cytochalasin B or 0. 5 uM cytochalasin D, formation and transport of stress fibers were reversibly inhibited, and rapid and immediate shortening of existing fibers was induced. Quantification of actin and myosin II fluorescence associated with individual shortening fibers demonstrated that fluorescence per length of fiber increased for both components, suggesting sliding filament contraction. However, there was also a net loss of both actin and myosin II from fibers as they shortened, indicating a self-destructive process. Loss of material from fibers coupled with increased overlap of actin and myosin II remaining in the fibers suggested that contraction could be induced not only by increasing the force exerted by contractile motors, but also by decreasing gel structure through partial <b>solation.</b> Finally, cytochalasin accelerated contraction of actin-myosin-based gels reconstituted from purified proteins in the absence of myosin-based regulation, further supporting solation-contraction coupling as a possible mechanism for modulating cytoplasmi...|$|E
