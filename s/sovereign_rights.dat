5|$|This line of {{argument}} follows the political philosophy of John Locke in the Two Treatises on Government (1689). Locke wrote that the people {{had the right to}} resist their government when their property rights were violated, and that nations have the same <b>sovereign</b> <b>rights</b> even when they have been conquered by another.|$|E
5|$|Factors {{in favour}} of Croatia's {{preservation}} of its pre-war borders were the Yugoslav Federal Constitution Amendments of 1971, and the Yugoslav Federal Constitution of 1974. The 1971 amendments introduced a concept that <b>sovereign</b> <b>rights</b> were exercised by the federal units, and that the federation had only the authority specifically transferred to it by the constitution. The 1974 Constitution confirmed and strengthened the principles introduced in 1971. The borders had been defined by demarcation commissions in 1947, pursuant to decisions of AVNOJ in 1943 and 1945 regarding the federal organization of Yugoslavia.|$|E

In late 1991, the Commission stated, among other things, that Yugoslavia {{was in the process of}} dissolution, and that the internal boundaries of Yugoslav republics could not be altered unless freely agreed upon. Factors in the preservation of Croatia's pre-war borders, defined by demarcation commissions in 1947, were the Yugoslav federal constitutional amendments of 1971 and 1974, granting that <b>sovereign</b> <b>rights</b> were exercised by the federal units, and that the federation had only the authority specifically transferred to it by the constitution.|$|E
5|$|During the Second Sacred War Pericles led the Athenian army against Delphi and {{reinstated}} Phocis in its <b>sovereign</b> <b>rights</b> on the oracle. In 447 BC Pericles {{engaged in}} his most admired excursion, the expulsion of barbarians from the Thracian peninsula of Gallipoli, {{in order to establish}} Athenian colonists in the region. At this time, however, Athens was seriously challenged by a number of revolts among its subjects. In 447 BC the oligarchs of Thebes conspired against the democratic faction. The Athenians demanded their immediate surrender, but after the Battle of Coronea, Pericles was forced to concede the loss of Boeotia in order to recover the prisoners taken in that battle. With Boeotia in hostile hands, Phocis and Locris became untenable and quickly fell under the control of hostile oligarchs.|$|E

25|$|The European Union, {{after the}} Lisbon Treaty entered into force, can be {{characterized}} as a transnational sui generis political and legal entity. The Institutions of the European Union derive their authority based upon <b>sovereign</b> <b>rights</b> delegated by member states to Brussels. Institutions of the European Union have no <b>sovereign</b> <b>rights</b> but may enter into treaties (subject to ratification in national parliaments of EU member states) in those fields where competence has been fully delegated to the European Union.

25|$|Conflicts also arose over {{different}} {{interpretations of the}} legal status of the Demilitarized Zone. Israel maintained that it had <b>sovereign</b> <b>rights</b> over the zone, allowing the civilian use of farmland. Syria and the UN maintained that no party had <b>sovereign</b> <b>rights</b> over the zone. Israel was accused by Syria of cultivating lands in the Demilitarized Zone, using armored tractors backed by Israel forces. Syria claimed that the situation was the result of an Israeli aim to increase tension so as to justify large-scale aggression, and to expand its occupation of the Demilitarized Zone by liquidating the rights of Arab cultivators. The Israeli defense minister Moshe Dayan said in a 1976 interview that Israel provoked more than 80% of the clashes with Syria.|$|E
