Two small sub-basins draining distinct lithologies in their headwater (Plio-Villafranchian conglomerate versus Triassic gypsum-rich marls and dolomites) and the Miocene formations downstream are investigated. The Ca/Na vs. Mg/Na ratios and Ca/Sr vs. 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios allow the different facies that imprint the water signature to be identified, according to the hydrological conditions (low/high flows).

Modal analysis allowed to quantify the framework components and to identify four microfacies through which the main steps of the carbonate ecosystem were traced. The healthy phase of the carbonate shelf, dominated by bryozoans and echinoids, originated in a high-energy transgressive setting and evolved during a warm period characterized by a progressive increase of nutrients.

The drowning succession corresponds to deepening upward facies formed by fine-grained hybrid arenites to <b>sandy</b> <b>marls</b> with abundant planktonic foraminifera, glauconitic grains and clay matrix. The demise of the carbonate shelf might have resulted from a combination of regional and global factors that interplayed controlling the detrital input, the nutrient budget and the deepening of the basin.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the context}} of climate change, this study {{presents}} the ability of major/trace elements together with strontiumisotopes to trace back water paths at small scale and to deconvolve the geochemical signal of a small watershedsubject to intense flash floods episodes (Peyne, Hérault, France). Two small sub-basins draining distinct lithologiesin their heads (Plio-Villafranchian conglomerate versus Triassic gypsum-rich marls and dolomites) and the sameMiocene lithology downstream are investigated. Major elements and Ca/Na vs. Mg/Na ratios classically applied at large scale to distinguish carbonate from silicateweathering, allow here discriminating the three main lithologies from the two sub-basins. Trace elements Rband Sr coupled to calcium, also allow this lithological discrimination but in addition the Ca/Rb vs. Sr/Rb tracersappear {{to be much more}} discriminant for the various hydrological conditions. Thus, in combination with detailedlithological descriptions, they allow identifying the different facies that imprint the water signature through water-rock interaction according to the hydrological conditions. Strontium isotopes and Rb/Sr ratio, discriminate more precisely the drained lithologies of the 2 sub-basins. Firstly,the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios allow identifying the nature of the lithologies and their main component(s) contributing to theSr budget in water and thus imprint the isotopic signature. Secondly, Sr isotopes evidenced two distinct Miocenefacies: the detritric faction (<b>sandy</b> <b>marls),</b> and the marine carbonates. The geochemical signatures of the brook samples draining both compartments were compared to the signatureof the Peyne River outlet just before the confluence into the Hérault River. It appears that the signature of thePeyne River, integrating all the water draining the basin, is relatively stable whatever the hydrological conditionsand mainly marked by the Miocene formations. Sr isotopes further highlight that this signature seems to resultfrom the mixing of both Miocene facies present in {{the lower part of the}} Peyne watershed, i. e. the <b>sandy</b> <b>marls</b> andthe carbonates. The typical signatures of the Plio-Villafanchian conglomerates and Triassic gypsiferous marls anddolomites of the headwaters of each sub-basin are completely hidden by the Miocene signatures. This should berelated to the large drainage area of the Miocene compared to other lithologies, despite the high solubility of thegypsum formations releasing large quantities of dissolved elements in solution. Understanding water paths at small scale is even more efficient when the geochemical approach is coupled with adetailed geological description. Indeed, the geochemical tracers are extremely dependent on the facies sequences(morphology) and of the soil nature (mineralogical composition), this is particularly sensitive at small scale. In {{the context of}} climate change increasing the intensity of rain events in the Mediterranean region, and resultingin catastrophic floods events (flash floods), tracing the origin of water contributing to the runoff is of primaryimportance and this must be investigated at small scale. Geochemical and isotopic fingerprinting thus constituteexcellent tools which can help to define the area of interest to be monitored in the framework of flood forecast andwarning network...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{critical}} problems in projecting soil bioengineering interventions is the difficulty in developing precise calculations {{of the evolution of}} the structures and the type and combination of vegetation plantations that are planned for the particular site and problem. This is mainly due to the uncertainties in the plant development in each type of soil, the long and short term weather patterns and other edapho-climatic factors that determine limited calculation possibilities causing considerable degrees of uncertainty. This leads to a reduced level of reliability of bioengineering projects in terms of pre-determined factors of safety. In Mediterranean conditions this problem is even stronger due to the high seasonal and year-to-year climatic variability, and high degree of uncertainty in the vegetation instalment and growth patterns. To evaluate the comparative short and long term (up to 20 years) efficacy of the most used slope stabilization techniques, common calculation models were used to assess the factor of safety of those techniques. SLIP 4 EX was used to evaluate the factor of safety, while the normal Coulomb model was used to assess the resistance to sliding and overturning. Considering the average Mediterranean climatic conditions, the considered environmental conditions were the least favourable, in order to assess the reliability of the “worst case scenario”. Two common tree species in the western Mediterranean region (Pinus halepensis and Quercus faginea) were selected for the simulation and three common soil types were considered (stony clay, loose sandstone and <b>sandy</b> <b>marl).</b> The results of the simulations for different types of substrates, plant combinations and designs, show that, according to the modelling approaches, the use of soil bioengineering techniques, present a reliable effectiveness, confirmed by the experience gathered in interventions in Mediterranean sites with similar edapho-climatic conditions. Additionally, because bioengineering is about the factor of safety of the target vegetation after the decay of the combined structure, the efficiency as a slope support structure of a vegetated log cribwall was compared with the expected developed vegetation. It was concluded that an adequate development of the vegetation ensures all safety requirements even in the worst considered scenarios. Our results also illustrate that there is a generalized lack of data on the geotechnical characteristics of the Mediterranean vegetation, which is particularly critical in a geo-ecological context where bioengineering techniques face important limitations (very few species able of vegetative development of roots and shoots from live cuttings) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{decipher}} the PETM (Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum) impact on the “Sparnacian” diversified and interconnected paleoenvironments of the Paris Basin, and to ensure correlation of the events and processes identified, a high resolution temporal framework is essential. Historically, the Paris and adjacent basins are the cradle of stratigraphy, where the notion of "Sparnacian" took shape (Dollfus 1880), pointing terrestrial to lagoonal deposits with particular facies and faunas, interstratified between two easily distinguishable Thanetian and Ypresian sandy marine formations. Since that time stratigraphy has evolved, and we refer now to the lithostratigraphy of Aubry et al. (2005). A 31. 5 m deep drilling has been augered at Sinceny, a key locality for the “Sparnacian” of the Paris Basin. Various analyses have been performed on the samples collected: granulometry, XRD mineralogy, carbonate and organic carbon contents, biostratigraphy, palynofacies, rock-eval pyrolysis and chemostratigraphy (δ 13 C of the dispersed organic matter). Seven lithological units are defined among which five {{may be attributed to}} the “Sparnacian” intercalated between fine glauconiferous sands of Late Thanetian and Early Ypresian, with in ascending order: 1) a carbonated silty medium-sized sand, 2) a <b>sandy</b> <b>marl</b> with carbonated concretions and limestone beds, 3) a plastic clay, oxidized at the bottom, but with increasing pyrite upwards, 4) lignite and clay beds, all pyritic but more shelly upwards, 5) a shelly crag with small flint pebbles (“Falun et Sable à Galets Avellanaires de Sinceny”: FSGA). The CIE (Carbon Isotopic Excursion), proxy of the PETM, extents over nearly 20 m of the section. In this interval, isotopic values fluctuate around – 26 to – 28 ‰. They are more negative in the lower part and show short term fluctuations in the upper part, which may reflect changes in depositional environment. The Apectodinium acme, another proxy of the PETM, is recorded in the lagoonal facies. Clay minerals do not show any kaolinite influx in relation with the CIE, and interstratified kaolinite/smectite is characteristic of the third unit. The palynofacies and pollen and spore assemblages are fairly similar to those from other “Sparnacian” NW European units, with some charcoal beds and Plicapollis pseudoexcelsus, Juglandaceae and other taxa acmes. The FSGA is chemostratigraphically (averaging - 24 ‰) and biostratigraphically different (Apectodinium less abundant, other taxa present or abundant). Correlation with published sections in the Paris Basin is possible using litho- and bio-stratigraphy, but not chemostratigraphy (Thiry et al, 2006). Indeed such a long, regular and unequivocal CIE had never been recorded in the Paris Basin, neither in Limay, nor in the Mont Bernon and Provins reference sections, all situated on the Paris Basin edges where the deposits are more prone to sedimentary hiatuses. The FSGA unit postdates the PETM episode and evidences the Ypresian s. s. transgression in the “Sparnacian” lagoonal setting. Correlation with the P/E successions of the Belgian, London and Dieppe-Hampshire Basins is also possible, although further high resolution data are necessary in the Paris Basin...|$|E
40|$|A N T U N Š I M U N IĆ GEOLOGICAL-TECTONIC BASIS OF THERMO-MINERAL SPRINGS IN VARAŽDINSKE TOPLICE In the {{neighborhood}} of Varaždinske Toplice (Fig, 1) lie the northern slopes of Kalnik and {{the central part of}} Varaždinskotopličko mountains. The oldest rocks that crop out to the surface are dolomites and lime^stones from the Upper Triassic. The same rocks were found by drilling in Varaždinske Toplice, and most of the thermo-mineral water is contained in these rocks. The Upper Triassic layers have been hit by numerous tectonic stirs for which reason they are heavily crushed and split. This tectonization has greatly increased their capacity for accumulation. The connection between the dolomites and lime-stones {{in the area of the}} northern slopes of Kalnik, and the dolomites found by drilling in Varaždinske Toplice is presumed. The Lower Miocene olasts are transgressive on the Triassic carbonates. They consist of various pebbles, sands, marl, tuff and ribs of coal. Because these sediments alternate laterally and vertically, their porosity is rather poor. Large cobbles, measuring 10 — 30 cm in diameter, orginating from destruction of high^rank metamorphic rooks, appear at the boundary of the dolomites and limestones. Such rocks are not known in either Kalnik or the Ivančica area, so it is presumed that the »Moslavačko-Vrbovečki shelf« extended in the Lower Miocene to the southern slopes of Kasnik. Because of the transgressive character of the Lower Miocenean clasts, their greatest thickness is not known, although it is not presumed to exceed 400 m. After the very intensive tectonic movements in the Middle Miocene, the whole area was under the marine transgression. At first, Kalnik was an elevation from where large clastic materials were eroded and denuded, but at the beginning of the Sarmatian the whole area was completely overflown. Sedimentation, together with gradual sweetening, lasted unitl the Upper Pontian. During the Upper Neogene, approximately 1800 m of strata were deposited. Of these, roughly 600 m of Upper Pontian sediments are completely eroded. The great thickness of Upper Pontian sediments (650 — 700 m) suggests very intense synsedimentation movements. During the Badenian, Sarmatian and Lower Pannonian, marl and limestones were mainly deposited while sands and <b>sandy</b> <b>marl</b> mostly appear during the Pontian. The tectonic movements of great intensity occur after the Upper Pontian. It is difficult to reconstruct the chain of tectonical events, but it is clear that even the younger sediments of the Neogene were folded and rifted. Neotectonic movements formed plicated structures of great dimensions, the segments of which are shown on the Index Map (Fig. 1). These are the anticline Varaždinske Toplice— Margečan and antiform Ljubelj, and, between them, the syncLine Lobor—Zajezda—Pötkovec. These folds are very important for the explanation of the system of thermal-water heating. After the folding ceased, the elevation of Kalnik and Varaždinskotopličko mountains took place. The various movements of separete blocks towards normal and inclined clefts happened contemporaneously. It should be emphasized that »leaps« of the blocks were not so big as to cut off the connections among the Triassic dolomites, which are the main containers of the thermal waters. The Ljubelj area is the part most elevated by the neotectonic movements, and it is there where water accumulater. Limestones and doloimites conduct water down under the bottom of the Neogene syncline (about 1300 m). The water is heated as it travels downwards. Afterwards, it rises up to the top of the anticline and reaches the surface throughe the small fault. For the water to be able to run through the system of linked containers, hydrostatic pressure is of great importance. This pressure arises due to the differences of 200 — 350 m in height above sea level in the dolomites. Triassic dolomites from the Ljubelj area are the most elevated (558 m) and the thermal spring is 198, 7 m above sea level. According to A. R u b i n i ć (1961) the geothermal gradient for northern Croatia is 25, 6 to 27 ^ 2 ̆ 7 C. Water wofuld have to go as for as 1300 to 1400 m deep in order to be heated from 8 * to 56 «C.

However, samples taken there in 1966 by one of us make feasible a reinterpretation of this series {{in the light of}} taxonomic and biostratigraphic data from a recent study of Aptian microfaunas from La Tuilière area, some 5 km away. This new micropaleontologic interpretation shows that the historical section is truncated at its base : the lower (not lowermost) Gargasian is in quasi-direct contact with Urgonian limestones; the uppermost (marly) Bedoulian, known to be present westward towards Le Chêne as well as at La Tuilière, is absent in the stratotype outcrop. In the samples from the stratotypic succession we have identified (bottom upward) : * {{the upper part of the}} Praehedbergella luterbacheri zone and the Globigerinelloides ferreolensis zone, * the G. barri zone, * the beginning of the G. algerianus zone,i. e. these zones comprise the major part of the lower Gargasian, the middle Gargasian and the transition to the upper Gargasian.

A new facies analysis study let us to recognize 9 - 10 depositional cycles consisting of 7 rhythmically interbedded primary gypsum bodies, and 2 - 3 sandstone bodies separated by marly terrigenous horizons showing a laterally persistent vertical organization: a basal thin gypsum bed is overlain by a cluster of 5 thicker gypsum bodies; a marly interval containing 2 distinct sandstone horizons separate this cluster from the overlying uppermost 7 th gypsum body. The terrigenous Arenazzolo Formation, in turn followed by the lower Pliocene Trubi Formation, conformably overlies the Upper Gypsum unit. The rhythmic alternation of the <b>sandy</b> <b>marls</b> and gypsum/sandstone bodies records the response of shelfal to deltaic systems to precession-driven arid-wet climate fluctuations causing cyclical changes of both base-level and water concentration.

All these rocks belong to the Vrdnik series (Vrdnik Formation). The evolution of the Vrdnik series is distinguished by several stages (e. g. pre-lacustrine, lacustrine, peat-swamp, etc.). Each of these phases was proved by their sedimentologic and structural characteristics. On the other hand, among the fossils, only the swamp flora remains (Sequoia, Laurus, Taxodium, Glyptostrobus, etc.) and poor and fragmented ostracode valves (Candona sp.) were documented. Presently, the exact stratigraphic position of the Vrdnik series is unknown. Discordantly over the mentioned rocks, real marine sediments of the Paratethys Sea occur. To date, it was a completely unknown subsurface distribution of these sediments. Among a few types of rocks that have a small distribution, the so-called the Leitha limestones (Middle Miocene, Badenian) have great significance (up to 98 % of CaCO 3). The total thickness of the limestones reaches up to 70 meters (borehole B- 11). The findings of key foraminifer species (Orbulina - Globigerinoides Zone) indicate an early Badenian (Moravian) transgressive event (ca. 15 Ma). Lithologically, it is represented by gray, <b>sandy</b> <b>marls</b> and <b>sandy</b> clays, coarse-grained sands and microconglomerates in the base of the mentioned limestones (boreholes B- 11, B- 15, B- 19, and B- 21) with a total thickness of up to 15 meters.

40|$|Introduction: The drilled {{wells in}} central Iran basin {{representing}} the Oligo-Miocene Qom Formation {{could be considered}} as a hydrocarbon system wherever the complete successions of these marine sediments are deposited (Baghbani 1998). Gansser (1955), introduced the Oligo-Miocene marine Formation in the Qom basin and Furrer and Soder (1955) subdivided the Qom Formation in its type locality into six lithostratigraphic units including a to f members (a basal limestone, b- <b>sandy</b> <b>marl,</b> c- alternating marl and limestone, d- evaporates, e- green marls and f- limestone). Dozzy (1944, 1955) introduced the name of the Qom Formation. Soder (1956, 1959) subdivided the c member into c 1 to c 4 and Abaie (1964) explained them. The name of the Qom Formation and its members (a, b, c 1, c 2, c 3, c 4, d, e and f) have been accepted in National Iranian Stratigraphic Committee since 1975 (Stocklin and Setudehnia 1991). As the Oligo-Miocene deposits of the Qom Formation posses the high potential for hydrocarbon exploration, they have been subjected to a lot of studies but most of them were focused on central part of the basin. This study represents Sequence stratigraphic analysis based on new biostratigraphic framework and paleoenvironmental interpretations of the Oligo-Miocene shallow water carbonate successions of the Qom Formation in Morreh Kuh surface section and Yourt e Shah No. 1 well in the north- east of the central iran basin (Southern Tehran). To set the Qom Formation in a global time framework, the study was carried out in the context of European standard biozonation (SBZ zonal scheme). Material and Methods: The studied area is located in back arc basin in the central Iranian Basin. This paper represents sequence stratigraphy of the marine marls, gypsiferous marls, limestone, sandy and silty limestones and evaporates of the Qom Formation in Morreh Kuh (45 m thick) and Yourt e Shah No. 1 well  (372 m thick) in South of Tehran. In this study 334 thin sections were investigated. In order to evaluate larger foraminifera some examples in several different directions thin section was prepared. In order to determine the larger foraminifera specially, Miogypsinids, multiple thin sections in different orientation were prepared to obtain the oriented sections of this group. The microfacies analysis based on depositional texture, grains (skeletal and non-skeletal) composition, grain size and fossil content. The classification of carbonate rocks followed the scheme of Dunhum (1962) and Embry and Klovan (1971). Microfacies and facie belts were described based on Read (1985) and Burchette and Wright (1992). The age dating of the Qom for is based on larger foraminifera following the European standard shallow benthic zonation by Cahuzac and Poignant (1997). The sequences stratigraphy method is used by Hunt and Tucker (1993, 1995). Discussion of Results and Conclusions: From lithological point of view, the Yourt e Shah No. 1 well includes c 4 to f members. The c 4 member contains larger foraminifera as Miogypsinoides gunteri/tani, Miogypsinoides sp., and Nephrolepidina sp. This association marks the SBZ 24 Zone by Cahuzac and Poignant (1997) with the Aquitanian age. The undifferentiated e-f members in this well are marked by larger foraminifera including Borelis melo-curdica, Pseudotaberina malabarica, and Miogypsina gr. globulina. This foraminiferal association correlates with the SBZ 25 Zone revealing the Burdigalian age. In this report Pseudotaberina malabarica for the first time has been reported from Central Iran and Qom Formation. Lithologically, the Morreh Kuh surface section comprises only of the limestone and sandy limestones of the f member which contains larger foraminifera as the following. Borelis melo-curdica, and Austrotrillina howchini. The foraminiferal association could also be correlated with SBZ 25 Zone, referring to the Burdigalian age. This study shows that sedimentary environment of the Qom Formation is related to a carbonate ramp platform. Based on sedimentary texture and percentage of skeletal and non-skeletal allochems, 2 lithofacies and 9 microfacies from outer to inner ramp were determined. The most part of the Qom Formation in the study area are deposited in inner ramp setting. In the lower part of c 4 and undifferentiated e and f member sedimentary environment get deeper and for this reason argillaceous limestone of mid to outer ramp are deposited. The sequence stratigraphic studies led to the determination of three 3 rd order sequences in Yourt e Shah well No. 1. The first sequence with the Aquitanian age that includes c 4 and d members. The e and f members belong to the second and third depositional sequences with the age of Burdigalian. In the Morreh Kuh surface section only the youngest sequence with the age of Burdigalian is deposited. The results of the sequence stratigraphic studies showed that toward the North and West of study area the age of the Qom Formation and the sequences get younger...|$|E
500|$|Five {{geologic}} formations make up {{the southern}} portion of Florida: the Tamiami Formation, Caloosahatchee Formation, Anastasia Formation, Miami Limestone (or Miami Oolite), and the Fort Thompson Formation. The Tamiami Formation is a compression of highly permeable light colored fossiliferous sands and pockets of quartz, [...] thick. It is named for the Tamiami Trail that follows the upper bedrock of the Big Cypress Swamp, and underlies the southern portion of the Everglades. Between the Tamiami Formation and Lake Okeechobee is the Caloosahatchee Formation, named for the river over it. Much less permeable, this formation is highly calcitic and is composed of <b>sandy</b> shell <b>marl,</b> clay, and sand. Water underneath the Caloosahatchee Formation is typically very mineralized. Both the Tamiami and Caloosahatchee Formations developed during the Pliocene Epoch.|$|R
40|$|A {{multidisciplinary}} {{study of}} some extensively cored boreholes {{together with the}} new 1 / 25. 000 geological mapping of wallonia lead us to propose a new lithostratigraphic canvas for belgian lorraine. This area {{is located on the}} n-e border of the paris basin, south of the ardennes; the studied stratigraphic interval covers the keuper to the toarcian. Each of the newly defined units is sedimentologicaly interpreted on the basis of macroscopic and microscopic observations. Detailed palynological and claystratigraphical analyses have been performed, providingadditional stratigraphical, palaeoecological and sedimentological data. Moreover, a first sequence stratigraphic interpretation is proposed for this highly transgressive sedimentary body. The habay formation (conglomerates and red mudstones) is a fluvial unit, with immature channel conglomerates and paleosoils; the attert formation (dolomitic marls with gypsum and pseudomorphs) exhibites an evaporitic trend. The Mortinsart formation (sands and marls) corresponds to a restricted marine unit, evolving towards an alluvial plain (levallois member). The second cycle begins with the Jamoigne Formation (bioturbated marls and limestones), a marine subtidal restricted unit, evolving towards a more sandy sedimentary body (Metzert Member). The base of the third cycle corresponds {{to the rest of the}} Luxemburg Formation, comprising a succession of sandy waves. The Ethe Formation (laminar mudstones and marls) marks a deepening of the basin and the outset of open marine dysaerobic conditions. The Aubange Formation (bioturbated marls with sandstones and limestones) is characterized by the reappearance of a normal benthic fauna. The Grandcourt Formation (laminar mudstones and marls) marks a return to open marine dysaerobic conditions. The Mont-Saint-Martin Formation (<b>marls,</b> <b>sandy</b> <b>marls</b> and oolitic ironstone) is a highly regressive unit, while the Longwy Formation (limestones) marks the initiation of a carbonate platform.

50|$|The up to 500 m {{thick layer}} of Lower Triassic (Buntsandstein) {{comprises}} conglomerates, breccia, brown sandstones, argillites, shales, and siltstones. The Middle Triassic (Muschelkalk) can attain a thickness of 400 m and shows silty shales, evaporite deposits, and dolomitic micrites. The up to 500 m thick Upper Triassic Keuper deposits {{are made up of}} carbonate-rich sediments, salt, siltstones, and intercalated ophitic diabases/olivine dolerites. The lower Lias is a transgressive sequence with up to 200 m of non-marine sandstone, near-shore marine limestone and evaporites. A pelagic fauna at the top suggests open marine conditions. The middle and upper Lias consist of 230 m of shallow marine platform sediments (bioclastic limestone, argillaceous limestone, and micritic limestone). During the Middle Jurassic, an oolitic barrier, made up mostly of argillaceous micrites, separates an outer shelf from an inner shelf. The Upper Jurassic (Malm) deposits are mainly shales and carbonates. Near the end of the Jurassic, restricted environments were established with dolomicrites, banded limestones, and evaporites. The Lower Cretaceous layer starts with sandstones, shales, limestones, and calcareous breccia in the Neocomian, followed by Barremian marls and limestones. During the lower Aptian, sandstones, shales, <b>sandy</b> <b>marls,</b> and limestones were laid down. The upper Aptian and the Albian are mainly marls and limestones. The Upper Cretaceous includes a littoral Turonian with sandstones and sandy limestones. By the beginning of the Senonian (Campanian), a deep trough had formed (the Subpyrenean Basin) receiving a very thick flysch sequence. The Campanian and Maastrichtian flyschs comprise 2000 to 3000 m of periodically interlayered fines (marls, calcareous shales, and mudstones) and coarser sediments (conglomerates, sandstones, and greywackes). Near the K/T boundary, the Subpyrenean Basin was filled with continental red deposits in Garumnian facies even including dinosaur eggs in a few places. At this point, the Subpyrenean Basin underwent folding accompanied by a weak metamorphism.|$|R
