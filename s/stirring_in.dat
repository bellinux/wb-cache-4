25|$|A {{significant}} democratic <b>stirring</b> <b>in</b> the MENA region ensued from 2004 to 2006, {{marked by}} demonstrations, open calls for reform, and enhanced {{activity on the}} part of pro-democracy activists, yet U.S. pressure on regimes to implement top-down political reform had declined significantly by mid-2006 following strong parliamentary gains by the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood in 2005 elections and a Hamas victory in the 2006 Palestinian elections. This receding of U.S. diplomatic pressure was criticized by Arab pro-democracy advocates and was followed by an increase in authoritarian crackdowns on political opposition.|$|E
25|$|Sui Generis began {{shifting}} from their classic acoustic rock {{to a more}} electric and visceral sound. Also, <b>stirring</b> <b>in</b> the Argentine underground were new bands with a radically different sound from either acoustic or heavy rock: influenced by some of acoustic rock's more experimental works (such as Arco Iris and their phenomenal Agitor Lucens V with its world music influences), by Tango music and also by British progressive rock. This would be the blueprint of Argentine progressive rock that would bloom into {{the apex of the}} movement in 1975. As that year began few could foresee what a watershed it would become not just in Argentine rock history, but the country's too.|$|E

500|$|Nearly a {{thousand}} years passed without incident, and both worlds prospered due to the powers of their Crystals of Wind, Water, Fire, and Earth. New kingdoms and towns flourished, and travel by ship acted as a critical means of commerce and communication. However, a sinister force was <b>stirring</b> <b>in</b> the second world—ever since the Void incident, malicious demons had been sealed inside a tree in the Great Forest of Moore. [...] The corrupted amalgamation of spirits emerged as Exdeath, the game's primary antagonist. When Exdeath attempted to claim the world for himself, a group of heroes called the [...] "Four Warriors of Dawn" [...] (Galuf, Xezat, Dorgann, and Kelger) sealed him within the first world using its Crystals, and peace returned for another thirty years.|$|E
500|$|Two more {{magazines}} {{appeared in}} early 1941, Stirring Science Stories and Cosmic Stories, on alternating months, starting in February. These were published by {{a father and}} son operating under the name of Albing Publications; they had almost no capital, but persuaded Donald Wollheim to edit the magazine for no salary at all, with no budget for fiction. [...] The plan was to start paying contributors once the magazine was profitable. [...] Like Pohl, Wollheim knew several budding writers who were willing to donate stories, and managed to acquire some good fiction, including [...] "Thirteen O'Clock" [...] and [...] "The City in the Sofa", by Kornbluth, which Ashley describes as [...] "enjoyable tongue-in-cheek fantasies". [...] In the event only six issues appeared in 1941 before Albing failed financially, though Wollheim was able to find another publisher for one more issue of <b>Stirring</b> <b>in</b> March 1942.|$|E

2500|$|Titian {{explained}} {{in a letter to}} Philip that the two paintings would offer contrasting front and rear views of a nude Venus, thus allowing painting to compete with sculpture. [...] This apart, contemporary accounts show the powerful effect these paintings had on male viewers. [...] The squashed bottom of the sitting Venus here was still novel in art and considered exceptionally erotic. [...] The Venetian critic Lodovico Dolce praised (in the Prado version) the [...] "marvellous piece of dexterity ... in that one recognises in her hindmost parts here the distension of the flesh caused by sitting ... there is no man so sharp of sight and discernment that he does not believe when he sees her that she is alive; no one so chilled by age or so hard in his makeup that he does not feel himself growing warm and tender, and the whole of his blood <b>stirring</b> <b>in</b> his veins." ...|$|E
2500|$|Barrie {{also had}} friendships with other children, both before {{he met the}} Davies boys and after they had grown up, and there has since been {{speculation}} that Barrie was a paedophile. One source for the speculation is a scene in the novel The Little White Bird, in which the protagonist helps a small boy undress for bed, and at the boy's request they sleep in the same bed. However, {{there is no evidence}} that Barrie had sexual contact with children, nor that he was suspected of it at the time. Nico, the youngest of the brothers, denied as an adult that Barrie ever behaved inappropriately. [...] "I don't believe that Uncle Jim ever experienced what one might call 'a <b>stirring</b> <b>in</b> the undergrowth' for anyone—man, woman, or child", he stated. [...] "He was an innocent—which is why he could write Peter Pan." [...] His relationships with the surviving Davies boys continued well beyond their childhood and adolescence.|$|E
2500|$|The Platte River and the North Platte River in {{the future}} states of Nebraska and Wyoming {{typically}} had many channels and islands and were too shallow, crooked, muddy and unpredictable for travel even by canoe. The Platte as it pursued its braided paths to the Missouri River was [...] "too thin to plow and too thick to drink". While unusable for transportation, the Platte River and North Platte River valleys provided an easily passable wagon corridor going almost due west with access to water, grass, buffalo, and buffalo chips for fuel. The trails gradually got rougher as it progressed up the North Platte. There were trails {{on both sides of}} the muddy rivers. The Platte was about [...] wide and [...] deep. The water was silty and bad tasting but it could be used if no other water was available. Letting it sit in a bucket for an hour or so or <b>stirring</b> <b>in</b> a 1/4 cup of cornmeal allowed most of the silt to settle out.|$|E
