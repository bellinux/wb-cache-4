5|$|Epstein {{died of an}} {{overdose}} of Carbitral, a form of barbiturate or <b>sleeping</b> <b>pill,</b> in his locked bedroom, on 27 August 1967. He was discovered after his butler had knocked on the door, and then hearing no response, asked the housekeeper to call the police. Epstein was found on a single bed, dressed in pyjamas, with various correspondence spread over a second single bed. At the statutory inquest his death was officially ruled an accident; caused by a gradual buildup of Carbitral in his system, combined with alcohol. It was revealed {{that he had taken}} six Carbitral pills in order to sleep, which was probably normal for him, but in combination with alcohol they reduced his tolerance to lethal levels.|$|E

25|$|Meena Kumari was {{a patient}} of chronic {{insomnia}} {{and was on}} sleeping pills {{for a long time}} {{since the days of the}} telephoning conversations with Kamal Amrohi. During 1963, Dr. Saeed Timurza, her physician, then prescribed a small peg of brandy as a <b>sleeping</b> <b>pill</b> alternative and this was officially how she came into contact with the habit that was to kill her. Somehow this prescribed peg of brandy turned into heavy drinking after her separation from her husband. Meena Kumari and Kamal Amrohi never formally divorced, but separated in 1964. During those years of separation from her husband, Kumari's name was associated with Rahul, Gulzar, Dharmendra and Sawan Kumar Tak.|$|E
25|$|Humbert {{retrieves}} Dolores {{from camp}} and tells her Charlotte has been hospitalized. He then takes {{her to a}} high-end hotel. Humbert wants {{to have sex with}} her and, to make her more compliant, he gives her a <b>sleeping</b> <b>pill.</b> As he waits for the pill to take effect he wanders through the hotel and meets an anonymous man who, in fact, is famous playwright Clare Quilty, a friend of the now-deceased Charlotte. Quilty talks to him ambiguously about Dolores. Humbert excuses himself from the conversation and returns to the hotel room. There, he finds that the sedative was too mild after seeing Dolores drifting in and out of sleep. He dares not touch her that night, but in the morning Humbert is surprised when she initiates sex with him. While driving the next day, Humbert finally reveals to Dolores that her mother is dead after Dolores insists on calling her from a pay phone.|$|E

He tries to dial 911 {{on the cell phone}} but Cooper comes in, interrupting him. Michael speaks to Nancy, who admits that she helped Cooper escape but didn’t know he would abduct anyone. She claims that she helped him because he claimed that he was innocent. Tara notes that Cooper had phoned Tara, and told him to go to a payphone near his police station. He goes there, and speaks to Cooper, who tells him to meet him at a warehouse. Cooper then apologizes to Rex, stating that [...] "no son should pay for the sins of the fathers", and walks out of the shack. Michael meets with him; he claims that he met him for [...] "justice", and said that he was innocent. Cooper explains that Rex will die without him, confirming that he will die from dehydration possibly soon. He goes home and takes a <b>sleeping</b> <b>pill,</b> transferring to the [...] "red reality". Later, in the [...] "red reality" [...] (where Hannah is alive and Rex isn't), he speaks with Cooper at jail. He says that he didn't do it, and asks if he knows who did. He claimed that Jim Mayhew, another cop, committed the crime and framed him.|$|E

2500|$|As {{zopiclone}} is sedating, it is {{marketed as}} a <b>sleeping</b> <b>pill.</b> It works by causing a depression or tranquilization {{of the central}} nervous system. [...] After prolonged use, the body can become accustomed {{to the effects of}} zopiclone. When the dose is then reduced or the drug is abruptly stopped, withdrawal symptoms may result. These can include a range of symptoms similar to those of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Although withdrawal from therapeutic doses of zopiclone and its isomers (i.e. eszopiclone) do not typically present with convulsions and are therefore not considered life-threatening, patients may experience such significant agitation or anxiety that they seek emergency medical attention.|$|E

He states that Simpson had smoked marijuana, taken a <b>sleeping</b> <b>pill</b> and was drinking beer when he confided at his Brentwood home weeks after his trial what happened {{the night of the}} murders. Simpson allegedly said, [...] "If she hadn't opened that door with a knife in her hand... she'd still be alive." [...] This, Gilbert said, confirmed his belief that Simpson had confessed. Simpson has denied ever having said this.|$|E
2500|$|Approximately {{one month}} after his sentencing, Warmbier {{suffered}} severe neurological injury from an unknown cause. North Korean authorities did not disclose his medical condition until June 2017, when they announced he had fallen into a coma {{as a result of}} botulism and a <b>sleeping</b> <b>pill.</b> The United States made diplomatic efforts to seek Warmbier's release, and Warmbier was freed in June 2017, in a comatose state after 17 months in captivity. He was repatriated to the United States, [...] arriving in Cincinnati, Ohio, on June 13, and was taken to University of Cincinnati Medical Center for immediate evaluation and treatment. His U.S. physicians found no evidence of botulism. Nevertheless, a Coroner's report was unable to identify the cause of the injury, finding no evidence of physical torture on Warmbier's body.|$|E

2500|$|Everyone is {{thoroughly}} {{confused by the}} two mysteries – who moved the body and who rang the police? While the police are searching the house and grounds, Miss Peake comes downstairs and tells Clarissa and her three guests that she {{is responsible for the}} body being moved in order that a charge couldn't be made against her as the primary evidence is missing. She wasn't in the hysterical state that she made out and, hearing how things were developing, the strong woman removed the body from the recess from the library side and hid it under the bolster of the bed she was [...] "recovering" [...] on. Pippa also comes downstairs, still drowsy over her <b>sleeping</b> <b>pill</b> and talking about seeing policemen in her room in her dreams. She also thinks that her sighting of Oliver was a dream and links this to the wax doll she produces – her [...] "recipe" [...] book was an ancient book on witchcraft and this explains why she confessed to killing Costello: she thought her [...] "spells" [...] had done the deed.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{following}} days, while at {{work with the}} other firemen ransacking the book-filled house of an old woman before the inevitable burning, Montag steals a book before any of his coworkers notice. The woman refuses to leave her house and her books, choosing instead to light a match and burn herself alive. Montag returns home jarred by the woman's suicide. While getting ready for bed, he hides the stolen book under his pillow. Still shaken by the night's events, he attempts to make conversation with Mildred, starting by asking her {{when they first met}} and where. Mildred goes to answer, but immediately forgets. As she laughs off her ignorance and heads for the bathroom to take more sleeping pills, Montag realizes just how much Mildred's <b>sleeping</b> <b>pill</b> addiction, love of interactive entertainment, and fast driving has ruined her mind and their marriage. Later, as Mildred is sleeping, Montag wakes her up and asks her if she has seen or heard anything about Clarisse McClellan. Mildred initially brushes off the question until she finally reveals what happened: Clarisse's family moved away after Clarisse got hit by a speeding car and died four days ago. Dismayed by her failure to mention this earlier, Montag uneasily tries to fall asleep. Outside he suspects the presence of [...] "The Hound", an eight-legged robotic dog-like creature that resides in the firehouse and aids the firemen.|$|E
2500|$|Eminem had {{continued}} recording throughout 2005, and released {{most of this}} work on his Shady Records compilation album [...] He also recorded the track [...] "Beautiful" [...] in late 2007, which would later become the fifth and final single on Relapse, and {{also one of the}} only songs on the entire album in which Eminem recorded when he was not sober. Eminem began the major recording stages of Relapse in mid-2008, after completing a 12-step program to control his drug addiction. Record producer and long-time Detroit collaborator Jeff Bass of the Bass Brothers worked with Eminem on 25 tracks, two years after the rapper had received treatment for his <b>sleeping</b> <b>pill</b> addiction in 2005. Depressed by Proof's death, Eminem fell into a period of [...] "writer's block", where he felt everything he wrote was not worth recording. To compensate for this, Bass chose to follow a production style that would allow the artist to rap [...] "off the top of his head, as opposed to writing a story". Eminem would then freestyle or record vocals one line at a time before interrupting and then recording another line. At the same time, according to Eminem's song rights supervisor Joel Martin, the rapper began to collect additional songs without noticing it. He would often record or produce material initially intended for the musical projects of other artists, but end up with tracks he really liked.|$|E
