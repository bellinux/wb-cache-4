5|$|At {{almost the}} same time as Chesapeake lost control of her helm, her fore-topsail halyard was shot away, her fore-topsail yard then dropped, and she 'luffed up'. Losing her forward momentum, she yawed further into the wind until she was 'in irons', her sails were pressed back against her masts and she then made <b>sternway</b> (went backwards). Her port stern quarter (rear left corner) made contact with Shannons {{starboard}} side, level with the fifth gunport from the bow, and Chesapeake was caught by the projecting fluke of one of Shannons anchors, which had been stowed on the gangway. Chesapeakes spanker boom then swung over the deck of the British ship. Mr Stevens, Broke's boatswain, lashed the boom inboard to keep the two ships together, and lost an arm as he did so.|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep {{clear of}} the counter," [...] said Lingard, {{speaking}} in quiet warning tones into the night. [...] "The brig may {{get a lot of}} <b>sternway</b> on her should this squall not strike her fairly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you feel}} {{strong enough to}} prevent the rudder taking charge if she gets <b>sternway</b> on her? It wouldn't do to get {{something}} smashed about the steering-gear now. We've enough difficulties to cope with as it is." ...|$|E
60|$|And I {{watched the}} hat--the {{expression}} of my sudden pity for his mere flesh. It had been meant {{to save his}} homeless head from {{the dangers of the}} sun. And now--behold--it was saving the ship, by serving me for a mark to help out the ignorance of my strangeness. Ha! It was drifting forward, warning me just in time that the ship had gathered <b>sternway.</b>|$|E
60|$|Suddenly, {{glancing up}} at the dim cloud of sails above, I saw that we were aback and making <b>sternway.</b> We might have tossed a biscuit aboard the big Serapis as she glided ahead of us. The broadsides thundered, and great ragged {{scantlings}} brake from our bulwarks and flew {{as high as the}} mizzen-top; and the shrieks and groans redoubled. Involuntarily my eyes sought the poop, and I gave a sigh of relief {{at the sight of the}} commanding figure in the midst of the whirling smoke. We shotted our guns with double-headed, manned our lee braces, and gathered headway.|$|E
60|$|As the day wore along I {{improved}} on my obstructive tactics. When the Elsinore {{was up in}} the eye of the wind, {{and making}} <b>sternway,</b> I found that by putting the wheel sharply over, one way or the other, I could swing her bow off. Then, when she had paid off till the wind was abeam, by reversing the wheel hard across to the opposite hard-over I could take advantage of her momentum away from the wind and work her off squarely before it. This made all the wood-floated triangles of bird-snares tow aft along her sides.|$|E
6000|$|An hour later: [...] "Heard a noise {{similar to}} grounding. Knowing {{this to be}} {{impossible}} in the water in which the boat then was, I came up to 20 feet to investigate, and observed a large mine preceding the periscope {{at a distance of}} about 20 feet, which was apparently hung up by its moorings to the port hydroplane." [...] Hydroplanes are the fins at bow and stern which regulate a submarine's diving. A mine weighs anything from hundredweights to half-tons. Sometimes it explodes if you merely think about it; at others you can batter it like an empty sardine-tin and it submits meekly; but at no time is it meant to wear on a hydroplane. They dared not come up to unhitch it, [...] "owing to the batteries ashore," [...] so they pushed the dim shape ahead of them till they got outside Kum Kale. They then went full astern, and emptied the after-tanks, which brought the bows down, and in this posture rose to the surface, when [...] "the rush of water from the screws together with the <b>sternway</b> gathered allowed the mine to fall clear of the vessel." ...|$|E
50|$|The crewâ€™s efforts {{began to}} take effect. Chopper lost the headway that was taking her deeper, and even began to make <b>sternway.</b> Her bow began to rise, reached level, and {{continued}} to climb. Chopper began to ascend with a rapidly increasing up-angle until she was again nearly vertical in the water, now bow up.|$|E
50|$|As its up-angle passed 45 degrees, {{the boat}} slowed, {{coming to a}} halt and then falling backward, {{gathering}} <b>sternway</b> and sinking until it grounded. The second, third, and fourth compartments were crushed, though 24 crewmen survived in the after compartments. Their attempts to escape the wrecked submarine using IDA-51 apparatuses failed, and all 68 officers and men of S-80 were lost. Their fate remained unknown for seven and a half years.|$|E
5000|$|On 21 June 2001 Houston was {{conducting}} normal training {{operations in the}} Pacific {{off the coast of}} Washington state, which included a [...] "crash back" [...] drill, in which the ship goes from ahead flank (maximum forward speed) to back full emergency (maximum engine power in reverse). The maneuver proceeded well, despite the tremendous shaking, noise, and stress the maneuver creates, until the boat began to gain <b>sternway</b> (actually moving backwards through the water).|$|E
50|$|Club hauling is an archaic technique. When {{a vessel}} is {{in a narrow}} channel or on a lee shore {{so that there is}} no room to tack the vessel in a {{conventional}} manner, an anchor attached to the lee quarter may be dropped from the lee bow. This is deployed when the vessel is head to wind and has lost headway. As the vessel gathers <b>sternway</b> the strain on the cable pivots the vessel around what is now the weather quarter turning the vessel onto the other tack. The anchor is then normally cut away, as it cannot be recovered.|$|E
50|$|When {{a vessel}} is moving backwards, her rudder {{and in the}} case of a submarine, her planes, {{function}} in the opposite manner than when she is moving forwards. The stern planesman failed to compensate for this phenomenon and continued to try to trim the boat as if they still were making headway. When the stern began to rise, he raised the stern planes, which would have depressed the stern if they had been moving forward. While making <b>sternway,</b> it had the opposite effect, increasing the down-angle. The stern continued to rise, more rapidly as the boat accelerated backwards. Before the problem could be corrected, Houston had attained a 70 degree down-angle and her screw broached the surface while still turning at a high rpm. The control team performed a partial emergency ballast tank blow and safely surfaced the boat, and the engineering team safely scrammed (emergency shutdown) the reactor plant to prevent damage.|$|E
5000|$|Tacoma was a well-designed vessel which handled {{extremely}} well. Captain Coffin, {{in later}} years after Tacoma had {{been taken out of}} service, described the vessel in comparison to Flyer. Previous to becoming master of S.S. Tacoma in 1914, I had been mate and master of S.S. Flyer for twelve years and I was a little doubtful if Tacoma could equal the workings of Flyer. But I soon found out that Tacoma was superior in every point. She was faster and much easier to handle, and as for time, she could be depended on to a second. Day in and day out, her time between points, allowing for tidal conditions, was the same, and in making landings at the different piers, it was like landing in a row boat. Her reversing power was wonderful and from full ahead to dead stop required seventeen seconds, a feat that was tried several times. Going astern, she was almost as fast as ahead, when she would gain in speed. Another point she had, when emergency required a sudden reversal, by a slight change in the rudder she could be held in perfect position until she commenced to gain <b>sternway.</b> Then she would crawl rapidly to port. Her ability on the points mentioned often prevented accidents in fog.|$|E
50|$|Captain Lawrence {{realised}} {{that his}} ships speed {{would take it}} past Shannon and ordered a pilots luff. This was a small and brief turn to windward which would make the sails shiver and reduce the ships speed. Just after Chesapeake began this limited turn away from Shannon, she had her means of manoeuvring entirely disabled as {{a second round of}} accurate British fire caused more losses, most critically to the men and officers manning Chesapeakes quarterdeck. Here the helmsmen were killed by a 9-pounder gun that Broke had ordered installed on the quarter deck for that very purpose, and the same gun shortly afterwards shot away the wheel itself. Surviving American gun crews did land hits on Shannon in their second round of fire, especially American carronade fire which swept Shannons forecastle, killing three men, wounding others and disabling Shannons nine pounder bow gun while one round shot demolished Shannons ships bell.At almost the same time as Chesapeake lost control of her helm, her fore-topsail halyard was shot away, her fore-topsail yard then dropped, and she luffed up. Losing her forward momentum, she yawed further into the wind until she was in irons, her sails were pressed back against her masts and she then made <b>sternway</b> (went backwards). Her port stern quarter (rear left corner) made contact with Shannons starboard side, level with the fifth gunport from the bow, and Chesapeake was caught by the projecting fluke of one of Shannons anchors, which had been stowed on the gangway. Chesapeakes spanker boom then swung over the deck of the British ship. Mr Stevens, Brokes boatswain, lashed the boom inboard to keep the two ships together, and lost an arm as he did so.|$|E
