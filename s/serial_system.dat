6000|$|Mr. Pardon, as Olive observed, was {{a little}} out of this combination; but he was not a person to allow himself to droop. He came and seated himself by Miss Chancellor and {{broached}} a literary subject; he asked her if she were following any of the current [...] "serials" [...] in the magazines. On her telling him that she never followed anything of that sort, he undertook a defence of the <b>serial</b> <b>system,</b> which she presently reminded him that she had not attacked. He was not discouraged by this retort, but glided gracefully off to the question of Mount Desert; conversation on some subject or other being evidently a necessity of his nature. He talked very quickly and softly, with words, and even sentences, imperfectly formed; there was a certain amiable flatness in his tone, and he abounded in exclamations--"Goodness gracious!" [...] and [...] "Mercy on us!"--not much in use among the sex whose profanity is apt to be coarse. He had small, fair features, remarkably neat, and pretty eyes, and a moustache that he caressed, and an air of juvenility much at variance with his grizzled locks, and the free familiar reference in which he was apt to indulge to his career as a journalist. His friends knew that in spite of his delicacy and his prattle he was what they called a live man; his appearance was perfectly reconcilable with a large degree of literary enterprise. It should be explained {{that for the most part}} they attached to this idea the same meaning as Selah Tarrant--a state of intimacy with the newspapers, the cultivation of the great arts of publicity. For this ingenuous son of his age all distinction between the person and the artist had ceased to exist; the writer was personal, the person food for newsboys, and everything and every one were every one's business. All things, with him, referred themselves to print, and print meant simply infinite reporting, a promptitude of announcement, abusive when necessary, or even when not, about his fellow-citizens. He poured contumely on their private life, on their personal appearance, with the best conscience in the world. His faith, again, was the faith of Selah Tarrant--that being in the newspapers is a condition of bliss, and that it would be fastidious to question the terms of the privilege. He was an enfant de la balle, as the French say; he had begun his career, at the age of fourteen, by going the rounds of the hotels, to cull flowers from the big, greasy registers which lie on the marble counters; and he might flatter himself that he had contributed in his measure, and on behalf of a vigilant public opinion, the pride of a democratic State, to the great end of preventing the American citizen from attempting clandestine journeys. Since then he had ascended other steps of the same ladder; he was the most brilliant young interviewer on the Boston press. He was particularly successful in drawing out the ladies; he had condensed into shorthand many of the most celebrated women of his time--some of these daughters of fame were very voluminous--and he was supposed to have a remarkably insinuating way of waiting upon prime donne and actresses the morning after their arrival, or sometimes the very evening, while their luggage was being brought up. He was only twenty-eight years old, and, with his hoary head, was a thoroughly modern young man; he had no idea of not taking advantage of all the modern conveniences. He regarded the mission of mankind upon earth as a perpetual evolution of telegrams; everything to him was very much the same, he had no sense of proportion or quality; but the newest thing was what came nearest exciting in his mind the sentiment of respect. He was an object of extreme admiration to Selah Tarrant, who believed that he had mastered all the secrets of success, and who, when Mrs. Tarrant remarked (as she had done more than once) that it looked as if Mr. Pardon was really coming after Verena, declared that if he was, he was one of the few young men he should want to see in that connexion, one of the few he should be willing to allow to handle her. It was Tarrant's conviction that if Matthias Pardon should seek Verena in marriage, it would be with a view to producing her in public; and the advantage for the girl of having a husband who was at the same time reporter, interviewer, manager, agent, who had the command of the principal [...] "dailies," [...] would write her up and work her, as it were, scientifically--the attraction of all this was too obvious to be insisted on. Matthias had a mean opinion of Tarrant, thought him quite second-rate, a votary of played-out causes. It was his impression that he himself was in love with Verena, but his passion was not a jealous one, and included a remarkable disposition to share the object of his affection with the American people.|$|E

25|$|Serialism, {{along with}} John Cage's {{indeterminate}} music (music composed {{with the use}} of chance operations), and Werner Meyer-Eppler's aleatoricism, was enormously influential in post-war music.

40|$|A {{practice}} in systems reliability studies {{has been to}} assume that the components making up these systems fail independently, i. e., correlation effects are ignored. As a result, the reliability computations are somewhat simplified. Correlation among the system components, however, will in fact result in a system reliability which may be quite different from that computed under the assumption of independence. For <b>serial</b> <b>systems,</b> distributions are developed for the multivariate normal. The reliability of <b>serial</b> <b>systems</b> undergoing these failure distributons is then investigated for selected values of correlation. Comparison is made with reliability values assuming independent failure, computed using the 'product rule' by multiplying the component reliabilities. The differences between these two estimates are tabulated and graphed. An analysis of the results indicates that increasing system complexity and correlation is accompanied by a corresponding increase in the reliability difference, and for certain parametric values the effect of correlation can be quite important.

50|$|Performance:Traditional systems, {{because of}} their serial architecture, can suffer {{significant}} performance issues due to individual cell issues, module issues, or even light shading. One cell failure within a module will bring down the performance of that whole module. A module performance issue or outright failure will in turn bring down {{the performance of the}} whole string of modules. In a traditional <b>serial</b> <b>system,</b> the performance of the system depends on its worst performing component, and that will have a material cascading impact to the overall system. In tenK’s system, a cell issue will impact only that cell, and a module performance issue will impact only that module. The performance issue is isolated, and has an immaterial impact to the overall system. Likewise, shading has an impact only on the shaded component, and does not impact the rest of the system.|$|E

Between the second and the third season, Burge left, leaving her former position to executive producer Kern. She remained as creative consultant until season four.

The formula contains fifteen notes divided into five segments of 1 + 2 + 5 + 3 + 4. The durations of the notes within these segments are measured in quavers: 1, 1+2, 5+3+2+4+1, 2+1+3, and 3+1+2+4.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} {{implementation}} of a data parallel system. A sequential knowledge-based deductive and inductive system, INDED (pronounced &quot;indeed&quot;), {{is transformed into a}} parallel system. In this parallel system the learning algorithm, the fundamental component of the induction engine, is distributed among many processors. The parallel system is implemented with a master node and several worker nodes. The master node is responsible for coordinating the activity of the worker nodes, and organizing the overall learning process. All the worker nodes share the processing of the basic induction algorithms and report their results to the master node. The goal of the data parallel system is to produce, more efficiently, rules that are equal to or better than those produced by the <b>serial</b> <b>system.</b> In this paper, we present the architecture of the parallel version of INDED, and comparison results involving execution speeds and quality of generated rules of the new parallel system to those of the <b>serial</b> <b>system.</b> Key Words. data parallel, inductive logic programming (ILP), distributed reasoning systems 1...|$|E
