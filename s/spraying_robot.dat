40|$|For the <b>spraying</b> mobile <b>robot</b> {{working in}} greenhouse, {{due to the}} {{inconsistency}} of drive motors and the rough walking surface, {{it is easy to}} track off. For the liquidity of pesticide, the load always changes even the speed jumps. Because of these uncertainties, external disturbances and the difficulty of constructing the system dynamic model, it is hard to implement the trajectory tracking control of the <b>spraying</b> mobile <b>robot</b> steadily, precisely and quickly. In order to solve the problem, a smooth sliding mode trajectory tracking control method is proposed based on the distribute control strategy for each branch. Moreover, its stability is proved using the Lyapunov function. The simulation results show that the proposed method can track the reference trajectories precisely, quickly and steadily under the strong white noise. The chattering phenomenon of the control law is restrained compared to the conventional sliding mode control. The trajectory tracking performance is better than that of the fuzzy control.

The techniques developed to evaluate the economic impact of automation technology, however, are in their infant stage. During the process of automation, firms invest new technology in the absence of analytical methods {{to determine whether or not}} they are making the best economic choice. The lack of analytic techniques to assess the productivity effects of automation technology prevents progress from being monitored in financial terms. Without defined economic objectives, any disruption in the production process can be used to abondon [i. e. abandon] the new system.

Several variables were evaluated as the most probable key factors influencing the amorphous phase formation. These variables include powder feed size, in-flight particle characteristics (temperature and velocity), <b>spraying</b> <b>robot</b> travel speed, preheating the substrate, number of deposition passes {{and the presence of}} bond coat. It was found that larger particle size, higher robot speed and substrate preheating lead to larger amounts of amorphous phase. Moreover, it is shown that particle velocity and temperature need to be reasonably low to get greater amorphous content while the presence of a bond coat has no significant influence on the amorphous phase formation. In contrast, increasing the number of deposition passes is detrimental to this phase.

40|$|Atmospheric plasma {{spraying}} is a commonly used process to deposit ceramic coatings for applications of wear and corrosion protection. Feedstock materials include for example aluminium oxide, titanium oxide and chromium oxide. Plasma sprayed chromium oxide coatings {{are widely used}} in for example anilox rolls, pump seals and wear rings for their good surface quality, high hardness and wear resistance. Chromium oxide is however challenging to spray due to its high melting point, low thermal conductivity and tendency to vaporize in high temperatures. The vaporization of chromium oxide during spraying creates extremely fine dust particles, which gather on the workpiece and are trapped inside the coating layers reducing the cohesion and mechanical properties of the coating. Dry ice blasting {{has been used in}} the field {{to improve the quality of}} chromium oxide and many other plasma sprayed coatings by keeping the surfaces clean and helping with thermal management. The use of dry ice blasting during spraying was investigated by {{plasma spraying}} chromium oxide coating at TUT with two different commercial dry ice blasters attached to the <b>spraying</b> <b>robot.</b> Several parameters were tested and temperature monitoring was implemented. Metallographic specimens were prepared and analysed by SEM. Hardness, adhesion, gas permeability and wear tests were also conducted. It was found that dry ice blasting modifies the temperature history of the substrate and coating dramatically having unexpected effects. Excessive cooling lessened splat to splat bonding lowering cohesion and wear resistance but adjusting the spraying parameters hotter eliminated some of the adverse effects. There were also great differences in different blaster models related to the size of the particles exiting the nozzle. While the other blaster sprayed only small dry ice dust that mainly cooled the substrate, the other sprayed larger pellets with greater kinetic energy having a much more positive effect on coating cohesion increasing wear resistance compared to non-dry ice blasted samples...|$|E

Eye-in-hand camera was used to precisely determine spray position of each crop. Based on the center and area of 2 D minimum-enclosing-circle (MEC) of crop canopy, a method to calculate spray position and spray time was determined. In addition, locating algorithm for the MEC center in nozzle reference frame and the hand-eye calibration matrix were studied. The processing of a mechanical arm guiding nozzle to spray was divided into three stages: reset, alignment, and hovering spray, and servo method of each stage was investigated.

40|$|In the EU-funded CROPS (Clever Robots for Crops) project {{high tech}} robots are {{developed}} for site-specific spraying and selective harvesting {{of fruit and}} fruit vegetables. The harvesting robots are being designed to harvest high-value crops such as greenhouse vegetables, fruits in orchards and grapes for premium wines. The CROPS robots are also developed for canopy spraying in orchards and for precision target spraying in grape vines to reduce the use of pesticides. A CROPS robot {{will be able to}} detect the fruit, sense its ripeness, then move to grasp and gently detach only the ripe fruit. For crop protection the canopy sprayer can detect contours of trees in an orchard and consequently only spraying on the trees and the precision target sprayer can detect diseases on leaves of vine grapes and only spray pesticides on the affected spots of the leaves. In the CROPS project also attention is paid to reliable detection and classification of objects and obstacles for autonomous navigation in a safe way in plantations and forests. For the several applications within the CROPS project platforms were developed. Sensing systems and appropriate vision algorithms for the platforms have been developed. For the software platform the Robot Operating System (ROS) is used. A 9 degrees of freedom (DOF) manipulator was designed and built and tested for sweet-pepper harvesting, apple harvesting and in close range spraying. The 9 -DOF manipulator is modular, since the joint configuration can be adapted to the applications, e. g. 6 DOF for the close range spraying.

In order to improve the steering performance of the greenhouse <b>spraying</b> mobile <b>robot,</b> based on the characteristics that each wheel torque of the robot can be separately controlled, the dynamic model of the four-wheel independent steering system is firstly established by using the D'alembert’s Principle and choosing the sideslip angle and the yaw velocity as the state variables.
