5|$|To {{properly}} {{tell the}} international {{aspects of the}} story, filming for Sense8 took place almost entirely on location around the globe. In the first season they filmed in nine cities located in eight countries: Berlin, Chicago, London, Mexico City, Mumbai, Nairobi, Reykjavík, San Francisco, and Seoul. Production on the first season began on June 18, 2014 in San Francisco. The filmmakers successfully negotiated with {{the organizers of the}} Clarion Alley Mural Project and select artists to feature their artwork in the show. Shooting in Chicago began on July 9 and wrapped up on August 8, with filming taking place both on location and at the Cinespace Film Studios. They shot some scenes in the Superdawg drive-through restaurant, while customers were being asked not to stare at the filming. Lana and Lilly Wachowski are frequent customers of the place. During location scouting, the producers found the City Methodist Church in Gary, Indiana which is nearby Chicago, and changed one site's description in the scripts to a church accordingly in order to fit that particular site into the filming. They filmed in the church from July 25 to 28. Filming proceeded to London for a <b>short</b> <b>shoot</b> and then to Iceland, where between August 26 and September 6 they shot in Reykjavik and nearby places such as Akranes. Filming then started in Nairobi, where a sequence required a crowd of 700 extras, 200 cars and a helicopter. In Seoul they filmed from September 18 to 30. Next they moved to Mexico City and later to Germany, where they filmed in Berlin and inside Babelsberg Studio. Last place they visited was Mumbai where they also shot a Bollywood dance number that was choreographed by Slumdog Millionaires Longinus Fernandes. The writers wanted to feature an event in each city. They were able to schedule the Pride scenes with its Dykes on Bikes on the Dyke March in San Francisco, the Fourth of July fireworks celebration in Chicago, and the Ganesha Chaturthi Hindu festival in Mumbai. Additionally they recorded footage from the Fresh Meat Festival of transgender and queer performance in San Francisco, a club event taking place at the KOKO in London, and a real lucha libre (Mexican professional wrestling) event with the fighters wearing wrestling masks in Arena Naucalpan, in Mexico City. Lastly the scenes where characters are flying on an airplane were recorded during the real flights the cast and crew had to do to get from London to Iceland. On November 17, 2014 Straczynski wrote that the main unit shooting had wrapped, with only a few winter shots in Iceland remaining to be captured the next month. These scenes were further delayed to mid-January 2015, until Iceland had the necessary amount of snow, with the wrap party taking place in Reykjavík's Harpa Music and Concert hall on January 21. By the end of the shooting, the filmmakers had completed 100,000 miles of flight time, or four times around the globe.|$|E

Short shoots have very short internodes (so they may grow {{only one or}} two centimeters in several years) and their leaves are usually unlobed. They are short and knobby, and are arranged regularly on the branches except on first-year growth. Because of the short internodes, leaves appear to be clustered at the tips of short shoots, and reproductive structures are formed only on them (see pictures below - seeds and leaves are visible on short shoots). In ginkgos, as in other plants that possess them, short shoots allow the formation of new leaves in the older parts of the crown.

50|$|The term {{fascicle}} and its derived {{terms such}} as fasciculation are from the Latin fasciculus, the diminutive of fascis, a bundle. Accordingly such words occur in many forms and contexts wherever they are convenient for descriptive purposes. A fascicle may be leaves or flowers on a <b>short</b> <b>shoot</b> where the nodes of a shoot are crowded without clear internodes, such as in species of Pinus or Rhigozum.

50|$|The genus Berberis has dimorphic shoots: long shoots {{which form}} the {{structure}} of the plant, and short shoots only 1 - 2 mm long. The leaves on long shoots are non-photosynthetic, developed into one to three or more spines 3 - 30 mm long. The bud in the axil of each thorn-leaf then develops a <b>short</b> <b>shoot</b> with several normal, photosynthetic leaves. These leaves are 1 - 10 cm long, simple, and either entire, or with spiny margins. Only on young seedlings do leaves develop on the long shoots, with the adult foliage style developing after the young plant is 1-2 years old.|$|E

There are between eight and fourteen secondary veins, with up to three veins branching off the undersides of each secondary close to the leaf base, though one to no veins branch from the secondaries near the leaf tip. The teeth on short-shoot leaves are simple, with the apical side of each tooth usually concave and the basal side usually convex.|$|E

For the second season, production credited 16 cities located in 11 countries for having {{been part of the}} filming. The major locations they shot in include all of the first season's except Reykjavík, and the following new ones: Amsterdam, Argyll, Chippenham, Los Angeles, Malta, Positano, Redwoods, and São Paulo. Production start for the main unit of the second season was given an expected date of March 2016, but a separate shoot involving the principal actors began on December 30, 2015 in Berlin to capture footage during the Christmas holidays. This was followed by a short two-day shoot in Chicago on January 23 and 24, 2016. Filming resumed in Berlin in the middle of March 2016 and proceeded to Mumbai on March 25 for a ten-day shoot. Aml Ameen left production after Mumbai. On April 7 filming started in Positano. Later in April filming moved to Mexico with Toby Onwumere replacing the departed Ameen, in Mexico City and for one day in Metepec. On May 7 filming began in California in San Francisco and lasted up to the 23rd of May. Location manager Matthew Riutta was fined by the Department of Parks and Recreation when [...] "someone accidentally got naked" [...] during a romantic scene set at the tree swing in Billy Goat Hill. A <b>short</b> <b>shoot</b> in Los Angeles, Malibu followed. Filming in São Paulo, including its 20th Gay Pride Parade took place in late May. Filming in Chicago began on June 5 and wrapped up on June 15, then moved to the United Kingdom in London, Cambridge and Scotland, and wrapped on July 4. Then, filming moved to the Netherlands, in Amsterdam and The Hague, up to the 19th. Then, filming proceeded to Nairobi and in South Korea, in Seoul and Bucheon. Afterwards, filming returned briefly to London and to Berlin until the middle of September. Filming then moved to Malta for a two-day shoot, where they used the water tanks in Kalkara. On September 19, 2016 with the completion of the Malta shoot, filming for the second season came to an end.

Horizontal rhizomes produced 1 new <b>short</b> <b>shoot</b> every 17 (H. tasmanica) or 582 d (P. sinuosa).

A study of the rhizome growth of T. testudinum was completed in December 2004 in southern Tampa Bay that determined growth after 26. 5 months. Two PVC planting frames each containing four rhizomes with 2 short shoots, two rhizomes with 4 short shoots, and two rhizomes with 8 short shoots were planted next to existing T. testudinum beds at 5 sites (n = 10 planting frames). The rhizome apical meristem was removed from half of each set of <b>short</b> <b>shoot</b> units on each planting frame. Plants initially lacking a rhizome meristem produced more new long shoot meristems than those planted with an intact meristem, and larger planting units produced more new rhizome meristems than smaller ones, P = 0. 001 and P 3 ̆c 0. 001, respectively. The total number of rhizome meristems per planting unit (new meristems + initial meristem) was greater in plantings initially lacking a long shoot meristem in the 2, 4 and 8 <b>short</b> <b>shoot</b> size classes. Only the two <b>short</b> <b>shoot</b> plants benefited from an intact rhizome meristem at planting time, elongating 66. 4 cm versus 60. 4 cm for plants initially lacking a rhizome meristem at 26. 5 months.
