50|$|The 24 {{countries}} were split into eight groups of three. Each team played one best of nine leg match {{against the other}} two in their group. The top two from each group advanced to the last 16 where the tournament became a <b>straight</b> knockout <b>bracket.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{roof of the}} {{building}} extends over the platform. A series of horizontal timber members extend from the wall out to the rafters over the platform. The space between the members and the rafters is in-filled with vertical slats. Short <b>straight</b> timber <b>brackets</b> extend from the mid-point of the horizontal member down to the wall at an angle of approximately 45°.|$|R
50|$|The northeastern {{verandah}} roof {{is extended}} by a skillion, approximately one metre wide, running {{the full length}} of the elevation. The extended roof is supported by a series of horizontal members extending from the verandah posts out to the rafters. Short <b>straight</b> timber <b>brackets</b> extend from the mid-point of each horizontal member down to the posts at an angle of approximately 45°. The space between the members and the rafters are in-filled with vertical slats. Two double-hung sash windows and a set of French doors (which open into the rear bedroom) are spaced evenly along the elevation.|$|R
5000|$|Roth {{received}} his orthodontic degree from Loyola University Chicago School of Dentistry. Roth {{was known to}} work well with Dr. Lawrence Andrews. He initially met Dr. Andrews in 1968. During his work, Dr. Andrews gave Roth two sets of his Andrews <b>Straight</b> Wire <b>Brackets</b> for evaluation. Roth believed {{that as long as}} the condyles and mandible were positioned correctly in centric relation, Andrew's six keys to occlusion was compatible for orthodontic treatment. Dr. Andrews had come up with [...] "Andrews Prescription" [...] for the straight-wire brackets he developed. This meant that the orthodontic brackets had pre-adjusted tip and torque built into the brackets.|$|R
40|$|The early {{pioneers of}} orthodontics, like Angle, Kingsley and Farrar, devised {{appliances}} that have now evolved {{into what is}} known as the pre- adjusted edgewise appliance. With the introduction of preadjusted appliances, the focus has moved to customization of brackets to achieve specific and exact positioning of the dentition. These preprogramed features of the orthodontic bracket can be completely effective only if the bracket slot is accurate. Aims and objectives : The purpose of this study is to evaluate the slot size of eight different commercially available <b>straight</b> wire <b>brackets</b> of 0. 018 inch slot and 0. 022 inch slot with two different measuring devices. Materials and methods : Out of 80 <b>straight</b> wire <b>brackets</b> (Roth), 40 each of 0. 018 inch slot and 0. 022 inch slot from four commercially available manufacturers (3 M Unitek, TP, Ortho Organizers and Ormco) were used for the study. Each bracket sample from all the eight groups was measured for its slot size at the top and the base of the slot using two different measuring devices namely Starrett profile projector and PrakaVision profile projector. Both the measuring devices give a digital read out to the accuracy of 0. 001 mm. Data obtained were subjected to statistical analysis. Results : The slot size for ortho organizer- 0. 018 inch slot brackets was very close to the standard, whereas the other brackets were either oversized or undersized as compared to the standard...|$|R
50|$|The skillion-roofed {{passenger}} station is lowset, and is clad with weatherboards over a timber frame. <b>Straight</b> timber <b>brackets</b> support the awning, {{and there is}} a picket fence to the waiting shed section at the south-west end of the building. An office is at the centre of the building, with toilets at the north-east end. The small gable-roofed shed is clad in corrugated iron, and is set on concrete stumps. It has double timber doors and a small timber loading platform on its north- west elevation, which is reached by modern steel steps with a steel balustrade. The loading banks are made of earth, with retaining walls made with a combination of concrete, steel and timber.|$|R
50|$|The goods shed has a gabled {{corrugated}} iron roof, and is clad with weatherboards. Small eaves {{to the east}} and west sides are supported on <b>straight</b> timber <b>brackets.</b> A timber loading dock extends along the east and south side of the shed, and extends south to where a whip crane is mounted. The shed has two sliding doors and a window on the east elevation; a door on the south elevation; two sliding doors with their own small platforms on the west side, along with a window; and a small window on the north side. Internally the shed has exposed ceiling beams and wall studs, and an office or workshop area has been partitioned off at the south end, with the walls and ceiling lined with fibrous cement sheeting. Internally, each timber sliding door has a protective timber frame which it slides behind when opened.|$|R
50|$|The {{passenger}} station is a lowset timber-framed building, with chamferboard-clad {{walls and a}} skillion corrugated iron roof that has been extended to form an awning supported by <b>straight</b> timber <b>brackets.</b> The central waiting area has a picket fence and gate, toilets are on the left hand side of the building, and an office with a stable style door is on the right. Some original sash windows survive. There is a modern plastic water tank {{to the rear of}} the station building (not significant). The goods shed is a lowset, timber-framed building clad in corrugated iron. Its gabled corrugated iron roof has an awning over a loading platform on the north-west elevation which is supported by curved timber brackets. The goods shed has timber doors on its north- west, south-west and south-east elevations, and narrow windows on the north-east and south-west elevations. A plastic water tank on the north-east elevation is not significant. The small, gable-roofed timber shed south-west of the station building is clad in chamferboard, with an exposed stud to the exterior. It stands on a recent timber and steel platform, has a single timber door on its south-east elevation, a double timber door on its north-west elevation, and fixed timber louvers at each end. The area between the above three buildings has been turfed, up to and between the rails, which gives the appearance that the train is running on grass.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{if there is any}} significant difference in excess adhesive flash (EAF) with the use of APC PLUS adhesive coated appliance system and Transbond XT and if other variables such as side of the mouth, time taken to bond the brackets, the age of the orthodontic specialist, or the years of clinical experience affected the amount of EAF. Materials and Methods: Twenty orthodontic specialists bonded 20 preadjusted <b>straight</b> wire <b>brackets</b> (Victory, 3 M Unitek) on a typodont with a Class I crowded malocclusion in a split-mouth design, with one-half of the brackets bonded with APC PLUS adhesive system and the other half with Transbond XT. The teeth were sputter coated with gold and an image was taken at 32 × magnification in a scanning electron microscope (Philips XL 30). The resultant tagged image file (TIF) was opened in AnalySIS Pro 3. 1 (Soft Imaging System, Munich, Germany) and the area of EAF was measured. Results: t-Tests demonstrated that: (1) there was no statistically significant difference in EAF between two adhesives when bonding in different quadrants of dentition; and (2) there was no statistically significant difference in EAF between two adhesives overall. Analysis of variance models demonstrated there were no statistically significant differences found regarding the age of the orthodontic specialists, years of clinical experience, and time in performing the bonding. Conclusions: The addition of a coloring agent to assist in the visualization of the excess adhesive does not reduce the amount of excessive adhesive around orthodontic brackets. 8 page(s...|$|R
50|$|Heading {{into the}} Infinite Warfare season, Optic Gaming's roster {{remained}} {{the same as the}} Black Ops 3 Season even after a disappointing 7th-place finish at COD Champs 2016. Optic's first LAN tournament was CWL Las Vegas which took place on 16-18 December 2016. Prior to the event Optic had a mediocre start to Infinite Warfare online in 2K tournaments with some 2nd-place finishes throughout {{the weeks leading up to}} the event. Optic's first game was against Team Revenge; they took the Hardpoint with confidence winning Retaliation 250-113, they then won Scorch Search and Destroy 6-0 and closed out the series 3-0 with a win on Throwback Uplink 11-0. The second pool play match was against Black Ops 3 rivals, Rise Nation. The series proved to be tough for Optic and they went onto lose the series 3-2 by losing Throwback SND 6-4 on Map 5. The last pool play match was against Enigma 6 who was the open bracket team who got placed in their pool, surprisingly they came out and beat Optic 3-0; this meant Optic would end up finishing 3rd in their group. The 3rd-place finish meant Optic would be placed in the losers <b>bracket</b> <b>straight</b> away and their first game was against Elevate which they then went onto win 3-1 and proceed to losers bracket round 4. Round 4 was a rematch of the shocking result in pool play against Enigma 6. This time however things were very different and Optic came out and won 3-1 closing the series out on Throwback Hardpoint winning 250-117. Round 5 was against Call of Duty rivals, Faze Clan; this was a match highly anticipating due to the two biggest organisations in the esport playing against each other. The series ended in 4 maps with Faze taking the victory 3-1 with a victory on Breakout Hardpoint to close it out. This meant that Optic would still be without a win against Faze with the current lineups since Advanced Warfare in Mid 2015. Optic finished 5-6th and went home with 3,200 pro points each and $4000 total.|$|R
