Another successful new direction was neural networks—programs based on the actual structures within human bodies {{that gave rise to}} intelligence and learning. In the 90s, statistical AI achieved high levels of success in industry without using any symbolic reasoning, but instead using probabilistic techniques to make [...] "guesses" [...] and improve them incrementally. This process is similar to the way human beings are able to make fast, intuitive choices without stopping to reason symbolically.|$|R

40|$|Relations among {{specific}} {{aspects of}} language (comprehension and production, semantics and utter-ance length) and relations between language and symbolic play were evaluated when children were 13 and 20 months of age. The contributions of maternal stimulation to toddler performance and whether associations among toddler abilities might be explained by maternal behaviors were also examined. Although measures of toddler language covaried, language-play associations in toddlers were specific to semantic aspects of language. Associations between mother and toddler behaviors emerged and tended to be specific: Maternal language related to toddler language, and maternal play related to toddler play. Moreover, relations among toddler abilities maintained after maternal influences were partialed. The multidimensional structure of language and specificities in language-play associations were discussed with reference to models of early representational development. Developmental psycholinguists theorize that nonlinguistic representations of the world contribute to, as well as constrain, the structure of child language and the course of its development (e. g., Bloom, 1973; Brown, 1973; de Villiers & de Villiers, 1992). This cognitive model of language acquisition evolved from Piaget's (1962) claim that language emerges out of nonlin-guistic <b>sensorimotor</b> <b>intelligence</b> {{and is one of}} several manifes-tations of a general underlying symbolic capacity. However, em-pirical investigation has not supported the strong cognitive claim that <b>sensorimotor</b> <b>intelligence</b> is prerequisite to all aspect...|$|E

40|$|We are {{interested}} in developing a computational model of Piaget’s theory of <b>sensorimotor</b> <b>intelligence.</b> The main difficulty is that Piaget’s theory is quite vague. We analyse existing approaches and find that they model {{some of the major}} features of his theory, but that these are not adequate to account for the stage transitions which Piaget described. Instead of copying features of his theory we advocate developing a cognitive model to account for the infant development paths which he described. As a first step in this direction we present a computational model of Piagetian development in the early sensorimotor stages. In order to extend our computational model to later sensorimotor stages, we believe that further psychological studies are required to clarify issues left open in Piaget’s account. 1...|$|E
40|$|Nonhandicapped infants {{exhibit a}} number of manual {{strategies}} in their explorations that are suited to examining the salient aspects of particular objects. With maturity, simple strategies, such as mouthing, are replaced by more complex behaviors, such as fingering object surfaces, transferring objects from one hand to the other, and rotating the object with both hands. High-risk pre-terms exhibit the complex strategies less than full-terms and low-risk pre-terms. Object manipulation at 9 months predicted Bayley Mental Scale scores at 24 months. Suitable interventions can enhance the development of manipulation skills. The earliest play involves learning to manipulate objects. As infants handle objects they increase {{their understanding of the}} world; in a sense, they build their <b>sensorimotor</b> <b>intelligence</b> with their hands. In this article we discuss the strategies children use for interacting with objects {{during the first year of}} life and the manner in which this information can help developmental specialists who work with infants...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} current status of Piaget's theory of <b>sensorimotor</b> <b>intelligence</b> in {{relation}} to three persistent issues about the abilities of human infants: the nature of initial mechanisms � the traditional view that re-presentational functioning is the outcome of infant development � and the place of generalpurpose developmental processes. Varela's view of three successive paradigms for cognitive science | cognitivism, emergence and enaction | is introduced as a means for locating Piaget's ideas on action and epigenesis in relation to approaches of particular relevance to understanding infancy. The contribution of work that aims to understand how situated systems can be organized to function as autonomous agents exhibiting adaptive behaviour is considered through examples of computational work in behaviour-based robotics. This supports Piaget's stress on action, but challenges his assumptions about the outcome of infant development. Finally, the relevance to infancy, and to Piaget's theory, of Karmilo-Smith's proposals for cognitive development through a process o...|$|E
40|$|Object {{permanence}} is {{a cognitive}} ability to mentally represent {{the existence and}} the movement of hidden objects. This phenomenon is being developed since birth in six different stages following the development of the <b>sensorimotor</b> <b>intelligence.</b> Not only the humans but also the other animals possess a certain notion of hidden objects and acquire various degrees of this ability depending on their life strategies. This thesis summarizes the research conducted up to the present in the field of the object permanence within the infant developmental psychology, but particularly in the animal world with the emphasis on the taxa where this ability has been most researched, that is in primates and birds. This thesis also recapitulates the types of the cognitive tasks used in the object permanence research and compares the methods of experiments applied to the humans, the primates and the birds. Part of this thesis also involves a phylogenetic reconstruction estimate of the ancestral character status in terms of the object permanence and testing the progress dependance of such character in relation to the selected ecological factors in primates...|$|E
40|$|Grounding {{autonomous}} {{behavior in}} the nervous system is a fundamental challenge for neuroscience. In particular, the self-organized behavioral development provides more questions than answers. Are there special functional units for curiosity, motivation, and creativity? This paper argues that these features can be grounded in synaptic plasticity itself, without requiring any higher level constructs. We propose differential extrinsic plasticity (DEP) as a new synaptic rule for self-learning systems {{and apply it to}} a number of complex robotic systems as a test case. Without specifying any purpose or goal, seemingly purposeful and adaptive behavior is developed, displaying a certain level of <b>sensorimotor</b> <b>intelligence.</b> These surprising results require no system specific modifications of the DEP rule but arise rather from the underlying mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking due to the tight brain-body-environment coupling. The new synaptic rule is biologically plausible and it would be an interesting target for a neurobiolocal investigation. We also argue that this neuronal mechanism may have been a catalyst in natural evolution. Comment: 18 pages, 5 figures, 7 video...|$|E
40|$|Narrative, the {{creation}} of imaginative projects and experiences displayed in expressions of movement and voice, is how human cooperative understanding grows. Human understanding places the character and qualities of objects and events of interest within stories that portray intentions, feelings, and ambitions, and how one cares about them. Understanding the development of narrative is therefore essential for understanding the development of human intelligence, but its early origins are obscure. We identify the origins of narrative in the innate <b>sensorimotor</b> <b>intelligence</b> of a hypermobile human body and trace the ontogenesis of narrative form from its earliest expression in movement. Intelligent planning, with self-awareness, {{is evident in the}} gestures and motor expressions of the mid-gestation foetus. After birth, single intentions become serially organised into projects with increasingly ambitious distal goals and social meaning. The infant imitates others’ actions in shared tasks, learns conventional cultural practices, and adapts his own inventions, then names topics of interest. Through every stage, in simple intentions of foetal movement, in social imitations of the neonate, in early proto-conversations and collaborative play of infants and talk of children and adults, the narrative form of creative agency with it four-part structure of ‘introduction’, ‘development’, ‘climax’ and ‘resolution’ is present. We conclude that shared rituals of culture and practical techniques develop from a fundamental psycho-motor structure with its basic, vital impulses for action and generative process of thought-in-action that express an integrated, imaginative and sociable Self. This basic structure is evident before birth and invariant in form throughout life. Serial organisation of single, non-verbal actions into complex projects of expressive and explorative sense-making become conventional meanings and explanations with propositional narrative power. Understanding the root of narrative in embodied meaning-making in this way is important for practical work in therapy and education, and for advancing philosophy and neuroscience...|$|E
40|$|The {{basic idea}} of our anticipatory {{approach}} to perception {{is to avoid}} the common separation of perception and generation of behavior and to fuse both aspects into a consistent neural process. Our approach tries to explain the phenomenon of perception, in particular, of perception {{at the level of}} <b>sensorimotor</b> <b>intelligence,</b> from a behavior-oriented point of view. Perception is assumed to be a generative process of anticipating the course of events resulting from alternative sequences of hypothetically executed actions. By means of this sensorimotor anticipation, it is possible to characterize a visual scenery immediately in categories of behavior, i. e. by a set of actions which describe possible methods of interaction with the objects in the environment. Thus, the competence to perceive a complex situation can be understood as the capability to anticipate the course of events caused by different action sequences. Starting from an abstract description of anticipatory perception and the essential biological evidence for internal simulation, we present two biologically motivated computational models that are able to anticipate and evaluate hypothetically sensorimotor sequences. Both models consider functional aspects of those cortical and subcortical systems that are assumed {{to be involved in the}} process of sensory prediction and sensorimotor control. Our first approach, the Model for Anticipation based on Sensory IMagination (MASIM), realizes a sequential search in sensorimotor space using a simple model of lateral cerebellum as sensory predictor. We demonstrate the efficiency of this model approach in the light of visually guided local navigation behaviors of a mobile system. The second approach, the Model for Anticipation based on Cortical Representations (MACOR), is actually still at a conceptual level of realization. We postulate that this model allows a completely parallel search at the neocortical level using assemblie...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{suggestions for}} "Genetic A. I. ": {{an attempt to}} model the genesis of intelligence in human infants, particularly as described by Piaget's theory of the Sensorimotor period. The paper includes a synopsis of <b>Sensorimotor</b> <b>intelligence,</b> followed by preliminary suggestions for a mechanism (the "Schema mechanism") for its development, and a hypothetical Scenario which partially reinterprets Sensorimotor development {{in terms of that}} mechanism. The Schema mechanism focuses on Piaget's concept of the competition and evolution of mental "schemas. " The schema is modelled here as an assertion that one partial state of the mechanism's world-representation is transformable to another via a given action, taken when the schema is "activated". A proposed process of "correlation" allows a schema's assertion to be extended or revised in response to empirically-observed effects of the schema's activation. Correlation uses the the formation and activation of schemas to propose and test hypothesis, in contrast with the passive tabulation characteristic of associationist mechanisms. Further features are proposed to enable schemas to become coordinated into composite structures, "compound actions", which can be used by other schemas; and to synthesize new "items" (state-elements) when existing ones prove inadequate to model the world. The Scenario outlines how the Schema mechanism might begin to make its way through the progression of Sensorimotor stages; development culminating in Piaget's third stage is discussed. This development includes learning about the visual and tactile effects of eye and hand motions [...] eg, learning how to look directly at an object, or to move a hand into view; and the organization of that knowledge to designate the tactile properties of "visual objects", and vice versa [...] eg knowing how to touch an object which is seen [...] paving the way to a sensory-modality-invariant representation of objects and space. The Schema mechanism attempts to "learn from scratch", without built-in expertise or built-in structure in its learning domains. In the past there has been little success among AI programs of this genre. But many such attempts have suffered from mechanisms which were trivial in that they placed the full burden of acquiring and structuring knowledge on one or two simple tricks, whereas, I claim, the present effort shows a willingness to incorporate a multiplicity of elements in a complicated mechanism. In addition, the Schema mechanism benefits from its orientation around a nontrivial theory of development. Piaget gives a comprehensive account of the infant's evolution of primitive problem-solving and domain-specific (chiefly object-manipulation) knowledge; this account is used here as a roadmap that describes the proper course for the mechanism to follow. Thus, there is a nontrivial (or at least nonarbitrary) sequence of target abilities to use as a framework for evaluating and revising the mechanism's performance.
