An ADI is the quantity of a food additive, expressed in milligrams per kilogram body weight, that can be ingested daily over a whole life span without causing additional health risks. We studied most <b>sweeteners</b> in use, including acesulfame K (E 950), aspartame (E 951), cyclamate (E 952), saccharin (E 954) and sucralose (E 955). In the Netherlands almost all children aged between two to six are exposed to artificial <b>sweeteners.</b> The assessment shows that for the <b>sweeteners</b> tested the ADIs were not exceeded.

5|$|A pisco sour is an {{alcoholic}} cocktail of Peruvian origin that {{is typical of}} the cuisines from Chile and Peru, considered also a South American classic. The drink's name comes from pisco, which is its base liquor, and the cocktail term sour, in reference to sour citrus juice and <b>sweetener</b> components. The Peruvian pisco sour uses Peruvian pisco as the base liquor and adds freshly squeezed lime juice, syrup, ice, egg white, and Angostura bitters. The Chilean version is similar, but uses Chilean pisco and pica lime, and excludes the bitters and egg white. Other variants of the cocktail include those created with fruits like pineapple or plants such as coca leaves.|$|E

40|$|The food {{industry}} {{is looking at}} possibilities to reduce, amongst others, the amount of sugar in food. Sugar can be replaced by <b>sweeteners.</b> The intake of artificial, non nutritive <b>sweeteners</b> of young Dutch children was estimated and compared to the health limit (ADI). An ADI (Acceptable Daily Intake) {{is the amount of}} a food additive, expressed as milligrams per kilogram of body weight, which can be ingested daily throughout life without causing additional health risks. The most commonly used <b>sweeteners</b> were examined, namely acesulfame-K (E 950), aspartame (E 951), cyclamate (E 952), saccharin (E 954) and sucralose (E 955). In the Netherlands, almost all 2 - 6 year old children were exposed to these artificial <b>sweeteners.</b> The assessment showed that the ADIs for these <b>sweeteners</b> were not exceeded. Given the rising trend in adding <b>sweeteners</b> to foods and drinks, it is important to continue monitoring the intake of <b>sweeteners</b> periodically.

5|$|An {{example of}} a low-maintenance {{experiment}} was the protein crystal growth experiment, which had also been flown on previous shuttle missions. The goal was to produce better protein crystallizations than those produced on the Earth, and hence allowing for a more accurate model of protein structures. Of the 23 proteins and viruses attempted during Expedition 1, only four resulted in successful crystallizations, which was a lower success rate than predicted. Of those successful was the low-calorie <b>sweetener</b> Thaumatin, whose crystals diffracted at a higher resolution than Earth-grown crystal, {{which resulted in a}} more accurate protein structure model.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} of the American Civil War, syrup makers started using large, flat sheet metal pans as they were more {{efficient}} for boiling than heavy, rounded iron kettles, because of a greater surface area for evaporation. Around this time, cane sugar replaced maple sugar as the dominant <b>sweetener</b> in the US; as a result, producers focused marketing efforts on maple syrup. The first evaporator, used to heat and concentrate sap, was patented in 1858. In 1872, an evaporator was developed that featured two pans and a metal arch or firebox, which greatly decreased boiling time. Around 1900, producers bent the tin that formed the bottom of a pan into a series of flues, which increased the heated surface area of the pan and again decreased boiling time. Some producers also added a finishing pan, a separate batch evaporator, as a final stage in the evaporation process.|$|E

40|$|Sweetness {{is one of}} the 5 prototypical {{tastes and}} is {{activated}} by sugars and non-nutritive <b>sweeteners</b> (NNS). The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate measures of sweet taste function [detection threshold (DT), recognition threshold (RT), and suprathreshold intensity ratings] across multiple <b>sweeteners.</b> Sixty participants, 18 - 52 years of age (mean age in years = 26, SD = ± 7. 8), were recruited to participate in the study. DT and RT were collected for caloric <b>sweeteners</b> (glucose, fructose, sucrose, erythritol) and NNS (sucralose, rebaudioside A). Sweetness intensity for all <b>sweeteners</b> was measured using a general Labeled Magnitude Scale. There were strong correlations between DT and RT of all 4 caloric <b>sweeteners</b> across people (r = 0. 62 - 0. 90, P 0. 05). In contrast, there were strong correlations between the sweetness intensity ratings of all <b>sweeteners</b> (r = 0. 70 - 0. 96, P < 0. 001). This suggests those caloric <b>sweeteners</b> and NNS access at least partially independent mechanisms with respect to DT and RT measures. At suprathreshold level, however, the strong correlation between caloric <b>sweeteners</b> and NNS through weak, moderate, and strong intensity indicates a commonality in sweet taste mechanism for the perceived intensity range...|$|R

40|$|To {{understand}} the functional similarities of fly and mammalian taste receptors, {{we used a}} top–down approach that first estab-lished the fly sweetener–response profile. We employed the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, an omnivorous human commen-sal, and determined its sensitivity to an extended set of stimuli that humans find sweet. Flies were tested with all <b>sweeteners</b> in 2 assays that measured their taste reactivity (proboscis extension assay) and their ingestive preferences (free roaming ingestion choice test). A total of 21 <b>sweeteners,</b> comprised of 11 high-potency <b>sweeteners,</b> 2 amino acids, 5 sugars, 2 sugar alcohols, and a sweet salt (PbCl 2), were tested in both assays. We found that wild-typeDrosophila responded appetitively tomost high-potency <b>sweeteners</b> preferred by humans, even those not considered sweet by rodents or new world monkeys. The similarities in taste preferences for <b>sweeteners</b> suggest that frugivorous/omnivorous apes and flies have evolved promiscuous carbohydrate taste detectors with similar affinities for myriad high-potency <b>sweeteners.</b> Whether these perceptual parallels {{are the result of}} con-vergent evolution of saccharide receptor–binding mechanisms remains to be determined.
