5|$|By 1956, Sanders had <b>six</b> <b>or</b> <b>eight</b> franchisees, {{including}} Dave Thomas, {{who eventually}} founded the Wendy's restaurant chain. Thomas developed the rotating red bucket sign, {{was an early}} advocate of the take-out concept that Harman had pioneered, and introduced a bookkeeping form that Sanders rolled out across the entire KFC chain. Thomas sold his shares in 1968 for US$1 million (around US$7 million in 2013), and became regional manager for all KFC restaurants east of the Mississippi before founding Wendy's in 1969.|$|E
5|$|Beginning around 1 pm, Union {{artillery}} fired first, initially upon infantry in the woods, {{and later}} upon any Confederate artillery that attempted {{to move into}} firing position. On the Confederate left flank, two batteries from Whiting's division and one from Jackson's soon began firing from their position upon Darius Couch's division of the IV Corps, who were {{near the center of}} the Union line. This began a fierce firefight, with the Union's eight batteries and 37 guns concentrated against three Confederate batteries and sixteen guns. The Union fire silenced the Rowan Artillery and made their position untenable. The other two Confederate batteries, placed by Jackson himself, were in somewhat better positions, and managed to keep firing. Over a period of more than three hours, a total of <b>six</b> <b>or</b> <b>eight</b> Confederate batteries engaged the Union Army from the Confederate left flank, but they were usually engaged only one at a time.|$|E

5|$|Lambertia formosa grows as a {{spreading}} shrub to 2m (7ft) tall, {{with one}} or more stems arising from a woody base known as a lignotuber. The new growth is covered with a fine brownish hair. The stiff leaves are arranged in whorls of 3, or sometimes up to 4 to 6, on the stems, and are linear to narrow-oblanceolate in shape. Measuring anywhere from 1 to 8cm (0.4–3in) in length and 0.2–0.7cm wide, they have a pointed tip or apex. Flowers are seen at any time of the year, but more often over spring and summer (September to January). Their bases are covered by greenish and reddish bracts. The inflorescences are almost always made up of seven smaller individual flowers (less than 1% of flowerheads have either <b>six</b> <b>or</b> <b>eight</b> flowers), known as florets, and can be shades of red or pink in colour. The tubular perianths are 4.5cm (1.6in) long, with the styles protruding another 1–1.5cm (0.5in) beyond. Flowering is followed by the development of woody fruit which measure 2–3 by 1–2cm. They have two 1–1.5cm sharp horny protuberances, and a 0.5cm 'beak', initially pale green in colour before fading to a grey-brown. These woody follicles each have two flat, winged seeds that are retained until burnt by fire.|$|E

25|$|Beaver lodges are {{constructed}} {{with the same}} materials as the dams, with little order or regularity of structure. They seldom house more than four adults and <b>six</b> <b>or</b> <b>eight</b> juveniles.

Usually, the dens have no connection with each other except by water.|$|E

About 24 more airframes were built at Long Beach but not delivered to USAAF, {{some of those}} later sold to other civil and military customers. A-26B was redesignated B-26B with USAF in 1948.|$|E
25|$|Generally, mortars of the Nebeltruppen were {{organized}} into batteries of <b>six</b> <b>or</b> <b>eight</b> mortars, three batteries per battalion. The towed rocket launchers had six launchers per battery, three batteries per battalion. Usually, three battalions formed a regiment. Midway through the war brigades were formed, each with two regiments. A regiment was sometimes reinforced with a Panzerwerfer battery of 6-8 vehicles. From 1942, their designations changed from Nebelwerfer to simply Werfer.|$|E
25|$|They {{appear to}} have been more highly thought of during the reign of Henry IV (1553–1610), who {{presented}} a pack to James I of England. By the end of the reign of Louis XIV (1715), they were already rare. In 1788, D’Yauville, who was master of the Royal hounds, says those sent by the St Hubert monks, once much prized, had degenerated, and scarcely one of the annual gift of <b>six</b> <b>or</b> <b>eight</b> was kept.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the postwar}} Packards sold well, {{the ability to}} {{distinguish}} expensive models from lower-priced models disappeared as all Packards, whether <b>sixes</b> <b>or</b> <b>eights,</b> became virtually alike in styling. Further, amid a booming seller's market, management had decided to direct the company more to volume middle-class models, thus concentrating on selling lower-priced cars instead of more expensive—and more profitable—models. Worse, they also tried to enter the taxi cab and fleet car market. The idea was to gain volume for the years ahead, but that target was missed: Packard simply was not big enough to offer a real challenge to the Big Three, and lacked the deep pockets with which a parent company could shelter them, {{as well as the}} model lineup through which to spread the pricing.|$|R
50|$|A common {{art form}} of the Sarmatian period were coffin portraits, {{particular}} {{to the culture of}} the Commonwealth, used in funerals and other important ceremonies.

25|$|In February 1977 World Championship Tennis (WCT) sued Borg and his {{management}} company IMG claiming that Borg had committed {{a breach of}} contract by electing {{to participate in the}} competing 1977 Grand Prix circuit instead of the WCT circuit. Borg eventually played, and won, a single WCT event, the Monte Carlo WCT. An out-of-court settlement was reached whereby Borg committed to play <b>six</b> <b>or</b> <b>eight</b> WCT events in 1978 which were then part of the Grand Prix circuit.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of windmills have four sails. Multiple-sailed mills, with five, <b>six</b> <b>or</b> <b>eight</b> sails, {{were built in}} Great Britain (especially {{in and around the}} counties of Lincolnshire and Yorkshire), Germany, and less commonly elsewhere. Earlier multiple-sailed mills are found in Spain, Portugal, Greece, parts of Romania, Bulgaria, and Russia. A mill with an even number of sails has the advantage of being able to run with a damaged sail and the one opposite removed without resulting in an unbalanced mill.|$|E
25|$|Spiders of the ecribellate haplogyne family Caponiidae are {{unusual in}} a number of ways. They differ from other spiders in lacking book lungs and having the {{posterior}} median spinnerets anteriorly displaced to form a transverse row with the anterior lateral spinnerets. Most species have only two eyes, which is also unusual among spiders. A few species of Caponiidae variously have four, <b>six</b> <b>or</b> <b>eight</b> eyes. In some species the number of eyes will increase when the spiderling changes its skin as it grows towards adulthood.|$|E

25|$|In the class-II locus, {{each person}} {{inherits}} {{a pair of}} HLA-DP genes (DPA1 and DPB1, which encode α and β chains), a couple of genes HLA-DQ (DQA1 and DQB1, for α and β chains), one gene HLA-DRα (DRA1), and one or more genes HLA-DRβ (DRB1 and DRB3, -4 or -5). That means that one heterozygous individual can inherit <b>six</b> <b>or</b> <b>eight</b> functioning class-II alleles, three or more from each parent. The role of DQA2 or DQB2 is not verified. The DRB2, DRB6, DRB7, DRB8 and DRB9 are pseudogenes.|$|E
25|$|A cricket cap {{is a type}} of soft cap, {{often made}} from felt, that is a {{traditional}} form of headwear for players of the game of cricket, regardless of age or gender. It is usually a tight-fitting skullcap, usually made of <b>six</b> <b>or</b> <b>eight</b> sections, with a small crescent shaped brim that points downwards over the brow to provide shade for the eyes. It is often, but not always, elasticised at the rear to hold it in place upon the wearer's head. Sometimes, rather than tight-fitting, the cricket cap comes in a baggy variety, that is always kept in place by elastic.|$|E

The main points were: the champion must be prepared to defend his title once a year; the match should be won by whichever player first won <b>six</b> <b>or</b> <b>eight</b> games (the champion had the right to choose); and the stake should be at least £1,000 (worth about £347,000 or $700,000 in 2006 terms).|$|E
