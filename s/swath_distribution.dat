40|$|The {{question}} {{of the effect of}} distribution and magnitude of spanwise circulation and shed vorticity from an airplane wing on the distribution pattern of agricultural products distributed from an airplane was studied. The first step in an analysis of this question is the determination of the actual distribution of lift along an airplane wing, from which the pattern of shed vorticity can be determined. A procedure is developed to calculate the span loading for flapped and unflapped wings of arbitrary aspect ratio and taper ratio. The procedure was programmed on a small programmable calculator, the Hewlett Packard HP- 97, and also was programmed in BASIC language. They could be used to explore the variations in span loading that can be secured by variable flap deflections or the effect of flying at varying air speeds at different airplane gross weights. Either an absolute evaluation of span loading can be secured or comparative span loading can be evaluated to determine their effect on swath width and <b>swath</b> <b>distribution</b> pattern. The programs are intended to assist the user in evaluating the effect of a given spanload distribution...|$|E
