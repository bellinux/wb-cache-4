50|$|RNA {{silencing}} suppressor p19 (also {{known as}} Tombusvirus P19 core protein and 19 kDa symptom severity modulator) is a protein expressed from the ORF4 gene in the genome of tombusviruses. These viruses are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that infect plant cells, in which RNA silencing forms a widespread and robust antiviral defense system. The p19 protein {{serves as a}} counter-defense strategy, specifically binding the 19- to 21-nucleotide double-stranded RNAs that function as small interfering RNA (siRNA) in the RNA <b>silencing</b> <b>system.</b> By sequestering siRNA, p19 suppresses RNA silencing and promotes viral proliferation. The p19 protein is considered a significant virulence factor and a component of an evolutionary arms race between plants and their pathogens.|$|E
40|$|The {{definition}} of a disease is fundamentally difficult, even if one considers only genetically based diseases. In its broadest sense, disease {{can be defined as}} any deviation from the norm that results in a physiological disadvantage. Natural selection ensures that the norm for any given species is constantly changing. In addition, some disadvantages are latent and might only manifest under certain environmental conditions. Conversely, an apparent disadvantage can carry a benefit, for example, the disease sickle-cell anemia that is an advantage in malarial areas. Because of the difficulties in giving disease a precise definition, in this review, gene silencing-based disease resistance will be restricted to the description of gene inactivation processes that contribute to maintain the physical fitness of an organism. In this sense, we are concerned with the elimination of invasive nucleic acid expressing. In numerous organisms, a variety of severe diseases are caused by the attack of invasive nucleic acids such as viruses and retroviral or transposable elements. Organisms have developed diverse mechanisms to defend themselves against such attack that include immune responses and apoptosis. Fungi, plants, invertebrates and vertebrates also enlist gene <b>silencing</b> <b>systems</b> to counteract the harmful effects of invasive nucleic acids. In particular, plants that lack interferon and immune responses have established efficient transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene <b>silencing</b> <b>systems.</b> In this review, we describe how plants defend against invasive nucleic acids and focus on the continual evolutionary battle between plants and viruses. In addition, the importance of controlling transposon activity is outlined. Finally, gene silencing-related mechanisms of genomic imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation are discussed in the context of disease resistance...|$|R

The analysis of transgene <b>silencing</b> <b>systems</b> has enriched our understanding of other epigenetic phenomena, including paramutation, as well as heterosis and genome evolution.

40|$|International audienceA barrier for {{horizontal}} {{gene transfer}} is high gene expression, which is metabolically expensive. Silencing of horizontally-acquired {{genes in the}} bacterium Escherichia coli {{is caused by the}} global transcriptional repressor H-NS. The activity of H-NS is enhanced or diminished by other proteins including its homologue StpA, and Hha and YdgT. The interconnections of H-NS with these regulators and their role in silencing gene expression in E. coli are not well understood on a genomic scale. In this study, we use transcriptome sequencing to show that there is a bi-layered gene <b>silencing</b> <b>system</b> - involving the homologous H-NS and StpA - operating on horizontally-acquired genes among others. We show that H-NS-repressed genes belong to two types, termed ``epistatic'' and ``unilateral''. In the absence of H-NS, the expression of ``epistatically controlled genes'' is repressed by StpA, whereas that of ``unilaterally controlled genes'' is not. Epistatic genes show a higher tendency to be non-essential and recently acquired, when compared to unilateral genes. Epistatic genes reach much higher expression levels than unilateral genes {{in the absence of the}} <b>silencing</b> <b>system.</b> Finally, epistatic genes contain more high affinity H-NS binding motifs than unilateral genes. Therefore, both the DNA binding sites of H-NS as well as the function of StpA as a backup system might be selected for silencing highly transcribable genes...|$|E
40|$|Background: Introduction of a {{transgene}} that transcribes RNA homologous to an endogenous gene in {{the plant}} genome can induce silencing of both genes, a phenomenon termed cosuppression. Cosuppression was first discovered in transgenic petunia plants transformed with the CHS-A gene encoding chalcone synthase, in which nonpigmented sectors in flowers or completely white flowers are produced. Some of the flower-color patterns observed in transgenic petunias having CHS-A cosuppression resemble those in existing nontransgenic varieties. Although the mechanism by which white sectors are generated in nontransgenic petunia {{is known to be}} due to RNA silencing of the CHS-A gene as in cosuppression, whether the same trigger(s) and/or pattern of RNA degradation are involved in these phenomena has not been known. Here, we addressed this question using deep-sequencing and bioinformatic analyses of small RNAs. Results: We analyzed short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) produced in nonpigmented sectors of petal tissues in transgenic petunia plants that have CHS-A cosuppression and a nontransgenic petunia variety Red Star, that has naturally occurring CHS-A RNA silencing. In both <b>silencing</b> <b>systems,</b> 21 -nt and 22 -nt siRNAs were the most and the second-most abundant size classes, respectively. CHS-A siRNA production was confined to exon 2, indicating that RNA degradation through the RNA silencing pathway occurred in this exon. Common siRNAs were detected in cosuppression and naturally occurring RNA silencing, and their ranks {{based on the number of}} siRNAs in these plants were correlated with each other. Noticeably, highly abundant siRNAs were common in these systems. Phased siRNAs were detected in multiple phases at multiple sites, and some of the ends of the regions that produced phased siRNAs were conserved. Conclusions: The features of siRNA production found to be common to cosuppression and naturally occurring silencing of the CHS-A gene indicate mechanistic similarities between these <b>silencing</b> <b>systems</b> especially in the biosynthetic processes of siRNAs including cleavage of CHS-A transcripts and subsequent production of secondary siRNAs in exon 2. The data also suggest that these events occurred at multiple sites, which can be a feature of these silencing phenomena...|$|R
40|$|Some RNA <b>silencing</b> <b>systems</b> in plants, nematodes, {{and fungi}} show {{spreading}} of silencing along target sequences, termed transitive silencing. Here, we {{address the question}} of whether endogenous targets can be silenced by a transitive silencing signal in plants. In transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants that harbored a silencing-inducing locus and a transgenic chimeric primary target, silencing of a secondary transgenic target occurred and the expression of the endogenous catalase genes was down-regulated, coinciding with a knock-down phenotype. Strikingly, the efficiency of the catalase silencing appeared to be correlated with the zygosity of the primary target locus and, to a lesser extent, with that of the silencing-inducing locus. These data suggest that silencing of an endogene induced by transgenic secondary small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) might depend on the amount of primary target transcripts that can act as template for the production of an efficient transitive silencing signal...|$|R
40|$|Microalgae exhibit {{enormous}} {{diversity and}} can potentially {{contribute to the}} production of biofuels and high value compounds. However, for most species, our knowledge of their physiology, metabolism, and gene regulation is fairly limited. In eukaryotes, gene silencing mechanisms play important roles in both the reversible repression of genes that are required only in certain contexts and the suppression of genome invaders such at transposons. The recent sequencing of several algal genomes is providing insights into the complexity of these mechanisms in microalgae. Collectively, glaucophyte, red, and green microalgae contain the machineries involved in repressive histone H 3 lysine methylation, DNA cytosine methylation, and RNA interference. However, individual species often only have subsets of these gene-silencing mechanisms. Moreover, current evidence suggests that algal <b>silencing</b> <b>systems</b> function in transposon and transgene repression but their role(s) in gene regulation or other cellular processes remains virtually unexplored, hindering rational genetic engineering efforts...|$|R

We have analysed these plants for evidence of the hallmarks of silencing. The GUS transcript was not detectable in the leaves of GUS-silenced tobacco plants. These plants contained siRNAs of approximately 23 nt in length homologous to both the 35 S promoter region and the GUS ORF. The absence of GUS expression and the existence of siRNAs in transgenic plants show that the silencing induced by TLCV sat-DNA is due to RNA silencing.

40|$|CpG islands (CGIs) are {{associated}} with most mammalian gene promoters. A subset of CGIs act as polycomb response elements (PREs) and are recognized by the polycomb <b>silencing</b> <b>systems</b> to regulate expression of genes involved in early development. How CGIs function mechanistically as nucleation sites for polycomb repressive complexes remains unknown. Here we discover that KDM 2 B (FBXL 10) specifically recognizes non-methylated DNA in CGIs and recruits the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC 1). This contributes to histone H 2 A lysine 119 ubiquitylation (H 2 AK 119 ub 1) and gene repression. Unexpectedly, we also find that CGIs are occupied by low levels of PRC 1 throughout the genome, suggesting that the KDM 2 B-PRC 1 complex may sample CGI-associated genes for susceptibility to polycomb-mediated silencing. These observations demonstrate an unexpected and direct link between recognition of CGIs by KDM 2 B and targeting of the polycomb repressive system. This provides {{the basis for a}} new model describing the functionality of CGIs as mammalian PREs. DOI:[URL]...|$|R

Expressions for flow resistance across perforated elements, derived by means of flow experiments, have been implemented in the flow resistance network.
