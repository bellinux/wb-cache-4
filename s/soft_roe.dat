25|$|When the {{internal}} ovaries or egg masses {{of fish and}} certain marine animals are ripe for spawning they are called roe. Roe from certain species, such as shrimp, scallop, crab and sea urchins, are sought as human delicacies {{in many parts of}} the world. Caviar is a name for the processed, salted roe of non-fertilized sturgeon. The term <b>soft</b> <b>roe</b> or white roe denotes fish milt. Lobster roe is called coral because it turns bright red when cooked. Roe (reproductive organs) are usually eaten either raw or briefly cooked.|$|E

40|$|Implications of {{multiple}} climate drivers for sea urchins were investigated across {{a spectrum of}} biological organization ranging from the urchin guild scale, to individual life history traits, to the geochemistry, material properties and porosity of sea urchin calcium carbonate skeletal tests. Using pink fragile sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus fragilis) on the southern California upwelling margin as a model species, links between biological traits and environmental parameters in nature across multiple spatial and temporal scales revealed correlations with dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, and temperature. Temporal trends in sea urchin populations assessed from trawl surveys conducted in southern California over the last 20 years (1994 - 2013) revealed changes in deep-sea urchin densities and depth distributions that coincide with trends in DO and pH on multidecadal and interdecadal (El Niño Southern Oscillation) time scales. The shallower urchin species (Lytechinus pictus) decreased in density in the upper 200 m by 80 %, and the deeper S. fragilis increased in density by ~ 300 %, providing the first evidence of habitat compression and expansion in sea urchin populations associated with secular and interdecadal variability in DO and pH. In this context, marketable food quality properties of the roe were compared between S. fragilis and the currently fished California red urchin, Mesocentrotus franciscanus, to assess the feasibility of developing a climate change-tolerant future S. fragilis trap fishery. Although roe color, texture, and resilience were similar between the two species, smaller and <b>softer</b> S. fragilis <b>roe</b> suggest it may only supplement, but not replace M. franciscanus in future fisheries. In comparisons across natural margin depth and climate gradients from 100 - 1100 m, S. fragilis exhibited reduced gonad production, smaller, weaker and more porous calcified tests in the Oxygen Minimum Zone (DO < 22 µmol kg- 1) and pH Minimum Zone (in situ pHTotal < 7. 57) than those collected from less acidic and more oxygenated shelf and oxygen limiting zones above and the lower OMZ below. Thus S. fragilis may be more vulnerable to crushing predators if low oxygen, low pH OMZs continue to shoal and intensify in the future. This research highlights the utility of quantifying natural variability in species’ traits along natural gradients on upwelling margins to improve understanding about potential impacts of changing climate drivers...|$|R

5000|$|In Russian, {{all types}} of fish roe are called [...] "икра" [...] (ikra, caviar), {{and there is no}} {{linguistic}} distinction between the English words [...] "roe" [...] and [...] "caviar." [...] Sturgeon roe, called [...] "чёрная икра" [...] (chyornaya ikra, [...] "black caviar") is most prized. It is usually served lightly salted on buttered wheat or rye bread, or used as an ingredient in various haute cuisine sauces and dishes. It is followed in prestige by salmon roe, called [...] "red caviar," [...] which is less expensive, but still considered a delicacy. More common roes, such as cod, pollock, and herring are everyday dishes. Salted cod or pollock roe on buttered bread is common breakfast fare and herring roe is often eaten smoked or fried. The roe of freshwater fish is also popular but the commercial availability is lower. <b>Soft</b> <b>roe</b> of various fishes is also widely consumed, mostly fried, and is a popular cantina-style dish.|$|E

It is established, that DNA has modulatory effect on secretion of all investigated cytokines - IL- 3, GM-CSF, TNFα, INFγ and IL- 10 by blood cells of healthy donors, increases their initially low concentration, reduces initially high and does not have essential influence at an average level of their secretion. Under action of DNA IFNγ level (stimulation index= 3, 3) increases more significantly than IL- 10 level (stimulation index = 1, 9).

40|$|Abstract. We studied some {{effects of}} a biologically active food {{additive}} (BAFA) «DNAaC» which contains DNA from salmon <b>soft</b> <b>roe</b> and vitamin C as active substances. This BAFA was investigated as a complementary remedy during radiation therapy of women with breast cancer (BrC), with respect to dynamics and levels blood serum cytokines, i. e., early hematopoietic factors (IL- 3, GM-CSF, TNFa), and balance of marker cytokines for Th 1 - and Th 2 -response (IFNγ, IL- 10). It was shown that «DNAaC» has modulating effect on secretion of all investigated cytokines. There was, however, a higher and statistically valid corrective effect upon GM-CSF, along with increase of initially low IFNγ and TNFa concentrations, and reduction of initially high IL- 10 levels. Hence, «DNAaC» contributes to improvement of cell-mediated immune deficiency, stabilization of hematopoietic system, and brings about tolerance to basic treatment approaches in oncological diseases...|$|E

Because JCBN {{rheumatoid}} arthritis (RA), an autoimmune disease, the patients often recognize side-effects {{due to the}} medication, alternative therapeutic strategies might potentially offer a clinical advantage. We evaluated the effect of nucleoprotein from salmon <b>soft</b> <b>roe</b> on animal model of arthritis. Mice transgenic for human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV- 1 Tg) were divided into three experimental groups and supplemented on either nucleoproteinfree (nonNP), or 0. 6 % or 1. 2 % nucleoprotein mixed (NP 0. 6 or NP 1. 2) diet for 3 months. The mice were evaluated arthritis by morphology, and measured with rheumatoid factor (RF). Moreover, macrophages and oxidative metabolites were assessed in the ankle and/or serum. Anti-oxidative potentials in nucleoprotein were determined with biological anti-oxidative potential (BAP) test, and electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis. NonNP-diet HTLV- 1 Tg mice increased an arthritis symptoms and RF. The symptoms were ameliorated in NP-diet groups. Macrophages detected by F 4 / 80 staining, and oxidative metabolites in the serum and/or joints were clearly decreased in 1. 2 % NP-diet HTLV- 1 Tg mice. Nucleoprotein and DNA-nucleotide, but less protamine, had direct anti-oxidative potency with BAP test and/or ESR in vitro.

40|$|A {{study has}} been made of a-tocopherol in some marine sources. Apart from {{commercial}} oils, which were of normal quality, care was taken to ensure fresh material. The a-tocopherol contents have been determined in eleven marine oils, four liver oils and seven body oils. The liver oils showed values from 35 - 700 µg per g. Cod liver oil ranged from 150 - 225, whereas Greenland shark liver oil showed very high contents, 300 - 700 µg a-tocopherol per g. The body oils normally contained 20 - 80 µg per g, thus eight samples of unspecified fish oils for hydrogenation showed 40 - 70 µg per g. Capelin oil showed high values, 50 - 230 µg per g. Fish livers varied greatly, the highest values were found in wrasse and catfish with respectively 108 - 180 and 290 - 300 µg a-tocopherol per g. Estimated. values for the liver oils were in the order of 200 µg per g for most species studied, exceptions were again wrasse and catfish with 1540 and 3100 µg per g, respectively. Values of this extremely high order were confirmed in additional analysis on extracted oils from these species. The muscle of ten species of fish were analysed. The a-tocopherol contents varied from 1. 0 to 16 µg per g, with a clear tendency for fat fillets to show the highest values. Estimation of the contents in the fats showed values generally in the order 300 - 500 µg a-tocopherol per g. Some values were confirmed on extracted oils. The distribution of a-tocopherol in different organs were studied on male and female herring, cod and coalfish. There was a striking difference between the content in the liver of the male and female herring. Both were in the spawning state and the male contained ten times more than the female, the estimated values for the liver fat being respectively 7000 and 700 µg per g. No difference of importance could be observed between the testis (<b>soft</b> <b>roe)</b> and ovaries (hard roe), with 32 and 41 µg per g, respectively. The pyloric caeca showed similar values for all species, 8 - 18 µg per g. The a-tocopherol content of ten species of echinoderms and mollusks were investigated. The analysis refer to the whole animal except for the squid. The values were in the order 4 - 15 µg per g fresh weight, and approx. 100 µg per g dry weight. Exceptions were the littoral snails periwinckle and limpet, with approx. 40 and 150 µg per g fresh weight, or approx. 200 and 1000 µg per g dry weight, respectively. The high values in the limpet was confirmed in extracted oils. Fat extracted from the deep sea prawn showed 950 µg a-tocopherol per g...|$|E
