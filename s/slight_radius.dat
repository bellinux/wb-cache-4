5000|$|Seagull Guitars {{have also}} {{released}} a [...] "compound-curve" [...] top design {{on all of}} their lines. The idea behind this is to add an arch {{to the top of}} the guitar to allow the company to use a thinner and a more lightly braced top. This is opposed to the typical flat top of an acoustic guitar which has problems with the sound hole sinking in. As part of the new design, the top has a <b>slight</b> (30' <b>radius)</b> curve to it which is slightly above the sound hole and then levels out around the bridge of the guitar. This provides stability while maintaining the same sound as a normal acoustic. They have been working on this new shape over the last twenty years. The company is still keeping a lot of the same attributes that they had in their previous guitars such as a wild cherry colour on the back and sides of the guitar, a solid top, and the same distinctive headstock.|$|R

40|$|A time {{dependent}} x-ray {{spot size}} measurement {{is critical to}} understanding beam target physics such as target plasma generated beam instabilities. The so-called roll bar measurement uses a heavy metal material which is optically thick to X-rays, to form a 1 D shadow of the x-ray origination spot. This spot is where an energetic electron beam interacts with a high Z target to produce the x-rays. The material (the “roll bar”) has a <b>slight</b> <b>radius</b> to avoid alignment problems. If a beam profile is assumed (or measured by other means), the equivalent x-ray spot size can be calculated from the x-ray shadow cast by the roll bar. Typically a radiographic film is exposed over {{the duration of the}} beam pulse, and the shadow is analyzed for a time integrated measurement. This paper explores various techniques to convert the x-rays to visible photons which can be imaged using a gated camera or streak camera for time evolved x-ray spot size. Data will be presented from the measurements on the ETA II induction linac. ...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} the inner regions of protoplanetary disks, we performed near-infrared interferometric {{observations of the}} classical TTauri binary system S CrA. We present the first VLTI-GRAVITY high spectral resolution (R∼ 4000) observations of a classical TTauri binary, S CrA (composed of S CrA N and S CrA S and separated by ∼ 1. 4 "), combining the four 8 -m telescopes in dual-field mode. Our observations in the near-infrared K-band continuum reveal a disk around each binary component, with similar half-flux radii of about 0. 1 au at d∼ 130 pc, inclinations (i= 28 ± 3 ^o and i= 22 ± 6 ^o), and position angles (PA= 0 ^o± 6 ^o and PA=- 2 ^o± 12 ^o), suggesting that they formed from the fragmentation of a common disk. The S CrA N spectrum shows bright HeI and Brγ line emission exhibiting inverse P-Cygni profiles, typically associated with infalling gas. The continuum-compensated Brγ line visibilities of S CrA N show {{the presence of a}} compact Brγ emitting region the radius of which is about ∼ 0. 06 au, which is twice as big as the truncation radius. This component is mostly tracing a wind. Moreover, a <b>slight</b> <b>radius</b> change between the blue- and red-shifted Brγ line components is marginally detected. The presence of an inverse P-Cygni profile in the HeI and Brγ lines, along with the tentative detection of a slightly larger size of the blue-shifted Brγ line component, hint at the simultaneous presence of a wind and magnetospheric accretion in S CrA N.

40|$|We analyze {{extensive}} BVR_cI_c time-series photometry and radial-velocity {{measurements for}} WOCS 40007 (Auner 259; KIC 5113053), a double-lined detached eclipsing binary {{and a member}} of the open cluster NGC 6819. Utilizing photometric observations from the 1 -meter telescope at Mount Laguna Observatory and spectra from the WIYN 3. 5 -meter telescope, we measure precise and accurate masses (~ 1. 6 % uncertainty) and radii (~ 0. 5 %) for the binary components. In addition, we discover a third star orbiting the binary with a period greater than 3000 days using radial velocities and Kepler eclipse timings. Because the stars in the eclipsing binary are near the cluster turnoff, they are evolving rapidly in size and are sensitive to age. With a metallicity of [Fe/H]=+ 0. 09 +/- 0. 03, we find the age of NGC 6819 to be about 2. 4 Gyr from CMD isochrone fitting and 3. 1 +/- 0. 4 Gyr by analyzing the mass-radius (M-R) data for this binary. The M-R age is above previous determinations for this cluster, but consistent within 1 sigma uncertainties. When the M-R data for the primary star of the additional cluster binary WOCS 23009 is included, the weighted age estimate drops to 2. 5 +/- 0. 2 Gyr, with a systematic uncertainty of at least 0. 2 Gyr. The age difference between our CMD and M-R findings may be the result of systematic error in the metallicity or helium abundance used in models, or due to <b>slight</b> <b>radius</b> inflation of one or both stars in the WOCS 40007 binary.

40|$|A novel {{electrostatic}} {{sensor array}} {{was designed to}} measure particle concentration downstream of a swirl burner. The fundamental mechanism and the primary constituent elements of the sensor array were described. The root-mean-square magnitude of the measured electrostatic voltage was determined {{as an indication of}} the particle concentration. The accuracy of the electrostatic sensor array was calibrated by the optical fluctuation method. Local particle concentrations at different cross-sections of the measuring chamber were measured to investigate the diffusion characteristic of the pulverized coal particles. Electrostatic sensor array showed its ability in the field measurement in this work. The measurements indicated that the velocity of the inner secondary air had a significant effect on the diffusion of the pulverized coal particles. The particles concentrated {{in the center of the}} cross-section after leaving the burner. With the development of the gas–solid two-phase flow, the particles distributed like a ring shape. The radius of the particle ring increased with the increase of the velocity of the inner secondary air.

40|$|We present {{measurements}} of the velocity dispersion profile (VDP) for galaxy groups in the final data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). For groups of given mass we estimate the redshift-space cross-correlation function (CCF) {{with respect to a}} reference galaxy sample, xi(r_p, pi), the projected CCF, w_p(r_p), and the real-space CCF, xi(r). The VDP is then extracted from the redshift distortion in xi(r_p, pi), by comparing xi(r_p, pi) with xi(r). We find that the velocity dispersion (VD) within virial radius (R_ 200) shows a roughly flat profile, with a <b>slight</b> increase at <b>radii</b> below ~ 0. 3 R_ 200 for high mass systems. The average VD within the virial radius, sigma_v, is a strongly increasing function of central galaxy mass. We apply the same methodology to N-body simulations with the concordance Lambda cold dark matter cosmology but different values of the density fluctuation parameter sigma_ 8, and we compare the results to the SDSS results. We show that the sigma_v-M_* relation from the data provides stringent constraints on both sigma_ 8 and sigma_ms, the dispersion in log M_* of central galaxies at fixed halo mass. Our best-fitting model suggests sigma_ 8 = 0. 86 +/- 0. 03 and sigma_ms = 0. 16 +/- 0. 03. The slightly higher value of sigma_ 8 compared to the WMAP 7 result might be due to a smaller matter density parameter assumed in our simulations. Our VD measurements also provide a direct measure of the dark matter halo mass for central galaxies of different luminosities and masses, in good agreement with the results obtained by Mandelbaum et al. (2006) from stacking the gravitational lensing signals of the SDSS galaxies.

Naval Observatory's 60 -inch telescope, Flagstaff, Arizona, {{comprises}} an f / 10 collimator {{designed by}} Meinel and Wilkerson, and a Leica 50 -mm f/ 2 Summicron camera lens. The collimator {{consists of a}} thick, 5 -inch field lens located close to the focal plane of the telescope, plus four additional elements extending toward the camera. The collimator has an efl of 10 inches, yielding a 1 -inch exit pupil that coincides with the camera's entrance pupil, 1. 558 inches beyond the final surface of the collimator. There is room between the facing lenses of the collimator and camera to place filters and a grating. The collimated light here is the best possible situation for interference filters. Problems of the collimator design work included astigmatism due to the stop's being so far outside the collimator, and field curvature. Two computer programs were used in development of the collimator design. Initial work, begun in 1964, was with the University of Rochester's ORDEALS program (this {{was the first time}} the authors had used such a program) and was continued through July, 1965. Development subsequently was continued and completed on the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory's program, LASL. The final design, completed January 24, 1966, was evaluated with ORDEALS. This project gave a good opportunity to compare ORDEALS, an "aberration" program, with LASL, a "ray deviation" program. It was felt that LASL was the superior program in this case, and some experimental runs beginning with flat slabs of glass indicated that it could have been used for the entire development of the collimator. Calculated optical performance of the design indicated that the reducing camera should be "seeing limited" for most work. Some astigmatism was apparent, but the amount did not turn out to be harmful in actual astronomical use. After the final design was arrived at, minor changes were made to accommodate actual glass indices of the final melt, and later to accommodate <b>slight</b> changes of <b>radii</b> and thicknesses of the elements as fabricated. An additional small change in spacing between two of the elements was made at the observatory after the reducing camera had been in use for a short time.
