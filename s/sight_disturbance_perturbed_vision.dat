40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore whether a short {{postural}} training period could affect postural stability in dyslexic children. Postural performances were evaluated using Multitest Equilibre from Framiral. Posture was recorded in three different viewing conditions (eyes open fixating a target, eyes closed and eyes open with <b>perturbed</b> <b>vision)</b> and in two different postural conditions (on stable and unstable support). Two groups of dyslexic children participated in the study, i. e.

Findings showed that short postural training improved postural stability on unstable support surfaces with perturbed vision: indeed the surface, the mean velocity of CoP and the spectral power indices in both directions decreased significantly, and the cancelling time in the antero-posterior direction improved significantly.

The adaptive predictive controller consists of an on-line identification technique coupled with a control scheme. Various system identification techniques are investigated and implemented including batch least squares, projection algorithm, and recursive least squares. The control algorithms used include Generalized Predictive Control and Deadbeat Predictive Control. This dissertation combines system identification and control to regulate broadband disturbances in modally-dense structures. As {{it is assumed that}} the system to be regulated is unknown or time varying, the control schemes presented in this work have the ability to identify and regulate a plant with only an initial estimate of the system order. In addition, theoretical development and experimental results presented in this work confirm the fact that an adaptive controller operating in the presence of disturbances will automatically incorporate an internal noise model of the <b>disturbance</b> <b>perturbing</b> the plant if the system model order is chosen sufficiently large. It is also shown that the adaptive controller has the ability to track changes in the disturbance spectrum as well as track a time varying plant under certain conditions. This work presents a broadband multi-input multi-output control scheme which utilizes both the DSP processor and the PC processor in order to handle the computational demand of broadband regulation of a modally-dense plant. Also, the system identification technique and the control algorithm may be combined to produce a direct adaptive control scheme which estimates the control parameters directly from input and output data.

Previous work has focused on transformations based on kinematics and dynamics, but has not explicitly taken into account the emerging knowledge of how humans control their movement. In this paper, we show how {{this can be done}} using a simple human neuromuscular control model. Our model of muscle forces includes a feedforward term, and low-gain passive feedback. The feedforward component is calculated from motion capture data using inverse dynamics. The feedback component generates reaction forces to unexpected external <b>disturbances.</b> The <b>perturbed</b> animation is then resynthesized using forward dynamics. This allows us to create animation where the character reacts to unexpected external forces in a natural way (e. g.,when the character is hit by a flying object), and still retain the quality of the captured motions.

40|$|Offshore {{operations}} can be {{harsh and}} demanding and set personnel and equipment at risk. Ships {{will be exposed}} to the environmental forces of wind, waves and current, which will influence offshore crane operations considerably. This thesis addresses the use of a crane head, a Three Axis Compensator (TAC), constructed as a Delta parallel robot, to compensate for the motions of the ship in three axes. This type of robot has a rigid and accurate structure, and because of its highly nonlinear nature, advanced control algorithms must be derived. This thesis includes both forward and inverse kinematics for the robot, as well as velocity kinematics and workspace analysis. The kinematics of a full crane system, with the TAC as its head, has also been modelled. To evaluate the control algorithms and to prove the concept of using a Delta parallel robot for motion compensation, two products were made, a simulator and a prototype of the TAC. A simulator which includes a model of a supply ship, a full scale crane with the TAC as its head has been created. The <b>disturbances</b> <b>perturbed</b> on the system from the elements are translated and rotated to the crane head frame of reference for use in the compensation procedure. PID-regulators are used to control the crane head, and simulations are conducted to verify that the crane head is able to compensate for the motions created by waves, tested at different sea states. In addition a small-scale prototype of the TAC has been built. This robot uses two-phase stepper motors to control the position of the Tool Center Point (TCP) which is where the cargo will be suspended. The prototype's body is of 3 D-printed plastic parts (ABS), magnets, steel balls and carbon tubes, and an Arduino microcontroller board is used to control the steppers. The sensor used to track the movements of the TAC is an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), which is a unit used to measure linear acceleration and rotational velocity. These signals were thoroughly filtered to avoid measurement noise on the measurements required in the control algorithms. Because of the structure's highly non-linear nature, some of the calculations in the control algorithm are strenuous affairs and are conducted in MATLAB on a computer connected to the Arduino, due to high computational costs. The subject matter described in this thesis, merging the Delta robot with an IMU into the TAC is a novel application, and as such has resulted in a conference paper at the 10 th IFAC Conference on Control Application Marine Systems (CAMS) to be held in Trondheim, Norway September 13 - 16, 2016...|$|R

40|$|The target {{tracking}} system of an IR (InfraRed) guided missile is constantly subjected to disturbances {{due to the}} linear and angular motion of the missile. To diminish these LOS (Line Of <b>Sight)</b> <b>disturbances</b> the seeker of the missile can be built from a free gyroscope mounted in a very low friction suspension. The ability of the spinning gyroscope to maintain its direction relative to an inertial frame is used to stabilize the seeker LOS while tracking a target. The tracking velocity of the seeker, i. e. its angular velocity, is controlled by a feedback control unit where the signal from the IR detector is used as input. The electrical driven actuator consists {{of a set of}} coils and a magnet on the gyroscope. The purpose of this thesis is to develop a real-time model of the seeker gyroscope in an existing IR MANPAD (MAN Portable Air Defense) missile. The aim is a model that is able to simulate the real system with consideration to the tracking velocity. The model should also be integrated into a hybrid simulator environment. With relatively good knowledge of the system and its subsystems an initial physical modelling approach was used where elementary equations and accepted relations were assembled to describe the mechanism of the subsystems. This formed the framework of the model and gave a good foundation for further modelling. By using experimentation and more detailed system knowledge the initial approach could be developed and modified. Necessary approximations were made and unknown parameters were determined through system identification methods. The model was implemented in MATLAB Simulink. To make it suitable for real-time operation Real-Time Workshop was used. The model design was evaluated in simulations where the tracking performance could be tested for different positions of the gyroscope. The results where satisfying and showed that the model was able to reproduce the output of the system well considering the speed of the model and the approximations made. One important reason that good results can be achieved with a relatively simple model is that the seeker is limited to small rotations. The model can be tuned to operate in a smaller range and the complexity can be kept low. A weakness of the model is that the output error increases for wide angles...|$|R
30|$|Some recent bursty {{bulk flow}} (BBF) {{studies in the}} near-Earth magnetotail {{revealed}} that the cross-tail width of the BBF outflow is around 3 - 5 Re which is much narrower than {{the width of the}} tail current sheet (Angelopoulos et al. 1996, 1997; Sergeev et al. 1999, 2000; Nakamura et al. 2004, 2005). It is still unclear why the BBFs are strongly localized in the sheet current (cross-tail) direction. Our study shown here suggests that BBFs generated by the 3 D fast reconnection process can be strongly localized in the sheet current direction without any distinct externally driven mechanism to localize the reconnection region in the sheet current direction. In other words, once the 2 D fast reconnection process is established in the 1 D current sheet, it is consequently localized to the 3 D fast reconnection process, due to the 3 D instability. Our study does not answer how the 2 D fast reconnection process can be triggered. However, any distinct externally driven mechanism is not needed to localize the 3 D reconnection process and keep them in a localized area of the much wider current sheet. Any weak plasma <b>disturbances</b> slightly <b>perturbed</b> in the sheet current direction are enough to localize the fast reconnection process in 3 D.|$|R

However, latencies between the stimuli and the head motion have never been quantified. The {{aim of this study}} is to quantify the influence of a <b>perturbed</b> <b>vision</b> on the head kinematics. Seven healthy volunteers without uncorrected vision (26. 7 ± 6. 9 years old, 1 female, 2 right-handed/right-dominant eye, 5 right-handed/left-dominant eye) were studied. Visual stimuli were performed through an immersive personal 3 D viewer (HMZ-T 1, Sony), securely tied on the head. Motion analysis of the head and the torso were performed using the optoelectronic Vicon system (100 Hz). Three markers were glued on the personal viewer, close to the nasion, left and right tragus, in order to create the head frame. Three markers were glued to create the torso frame (both acromia and C 7). Two different 3 D animated scenes were created on Blender and displayed at 24 Hz. The first animation was a landscape with a ball rolling on the ground, and then the ball stopped before being virtually launched via a catapult toward the screen. Two velocities were programmed: 4. 67 and 10. 58 m. s- 1. The second animation was a beach with sea and sky, where horizon tilted anticlockwise at 2 different constant rates: 0. 24 deg. s- 1 and 0. 48 deg. s- 1 with maximal amplitude of 8 ° and 16 ° respectively. The motion of the head relative to the torso was calculated for both scenes on seated and upright position, at the 2 different velocities, 2 times each, for a total of 16 random tests on each volunteer. For the launched ball animated scene, the reaction time seated was, as expected, shorter for the fast launches. For the beach animated scene, the head profiles followed most of the time the kinematic profile of the tilted animation, linearly or by steps, and not necessary until the end. Volunteers who were right-handed and right dominant eye tilted their head clockwise, at the inverse of the stimuli. Both experiments confirmed that visual stimulus could influence the kinematics of the head-neck system. In the ball animation, velocity of the stimulus does not seem to affect the amplitude of movement. In the beach animation, the head motions were variable, but performed at the same mean speed than the stimuli. Furthermore, the limited number of volunteer cannot conclude on the direction of rotation of the head, depending of the dominant hand and eye...|$|R
50|$|Frequent <b>disturbance</b> often <b>perturbs</b> {{agricultural}} {{habitats and}} the response to disturbance varies among EPN species. In traditional agricultural systems, tilling disturbs the soil ecosystem, affecting biotic and abiotic factors. For example, tilled soils have lower microbial, arthropod, and nematode species diversity (Lupwayi et al. 1998). Tilled soil also has less moisture and higher temperatures. In a study examining the tolerances of different EPN species to tillage, the density of a native nematode, H. bacteriophora, was unaffected by tillage, while the density of an introduced nematode, S. carpocapsae, decreased. The density of a third nematode introduced to the system, Steinernema riobrave, increased with tillage (Millar and Barbercheck 2002). Habitat preferences in temperature and soil depth can partially explain the nematodes’ different responses to disturbance. S. carpocapsae prefers to remain near the soil surface and so is more vulnerable to soil disturbance than H. bacteriophora, which forages deeper and can escape the effects of tillage. S. riobrave may have responded well to tillage because it is better at surviving and persisting in hotter and drier conditions created by tillage (Millar and Barbercheck 2002). The data showed that Steinernema sp. found in some Indonesia regions showed high adaptive capability when applied on another region or condition (Anton Muhibuddin, 2008). The response of EPNs {{to other forms of}} disturbance is less well defined. Nematodes are not affected by certain pesticides and are able to survive flooding.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} subjects {{ability to}} track a constant altitude {{as a function}} of the structure in the optical flow field. Optic flow was manipulated by using four different types of ground texture (splay angle, depression angle, random dot, and block textures) crossed with two global optical flow (GOF) rates (0 and 3 eyeheights/s). The subjects were asked to maintain a constant altitude while wind <b>disturbances</b> randomly <b>perturbed</b> them on vertical, lateral, and fore-aft axes. The critical independent variables were texture type and GOF rate. Texture type was a within-subjects variable while GOF rate was a between-subjects variable. The main dependent variables included RMS height error and the correlation between subjects stick activity and the three wind disturbances. For both dependent variables, an interaction was found in that the depression angle texture provided superior performance in a hover or 0 GOF rate condition. The splay angle texture provided a constant level of performance for both GOF rates, being superior to depression angle in the higher GOF rate. These results are consistent with Flach et al. 2 ̆ 7 s (1992) hypothesis that the ability to pick-up altitude information from the optic flow field depends upon the amount of optical activity that is specific to changes in altitude (signal) rather than specific to changes in lateral or fore-aft position (noise). This hypothesis provides a higher order explanation for previous results on the control of altitude which had been thought to be inconsistent...|$|R

40|$|Cooperative {{control of}} {{networked}} systems (or multi-agent systems) has {{attracted much attention}} {{during the past few}} years. But most of the existing results focus on first order and second order leaderless consensus problems with linear dynamics. The second part of this dissertation solves a higher-order synchronization problem for cooperative nonlinear systems with an active leader. The communication network considered is a weighted directed graph with fixed topology. Each agent is modeled by a higher-order nonlinear system with the nonlinear dynamics unknown. External unknown <b>disturbances</b> <b>perturb</b> each agent. The leader agent is modeled as a higher-order non-autonomous nonlinear system. It acts as a command generator and can only give commands to {{a small portion of the}} networked group. A robust adaptive neural network controller is designed for each agent. Neural network learning algorithms are given such that all nodes ultimately synchronize to the leader node with a small residual error. Moreover, these controllers are totally distributed in the sense that each controller only requires its own information and its neighbors' information. Receding horizon control (RHC), also called model predictive control (MPC), is a suboptimal control scheme over an infinite horizon that is determined by solving a finite horizon open-loop optimal control problem repeatedly. It has widespread applications in industry. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a computational intelligence method in which an optimal control policy is learned over time by evaluating the performance of suboptimal control policies. In this dissertation it is shown that reinforcement learning techniques can significantly improve the behavior of RHC. Specifically, RL methods are used to add a learning feature to RHC. It is shown that keeping track of the value learned at the previous iteration and using it as the new terminal cost for RHC can overcome traditional strong requirements for RHC stability, such as that the terminal cost be a control Lyapunov function, or that the horizon length be greater than some bound. We propose improved RHC algorithms, called updated terminal cost receding horizon control (UTC-RHC), first in the framework of discrete-time linear systems and then in the framework of continuous-time linear systems. For both cases, we show the uniform exponential stability of the closed-loop system can be guaranteed under very mild conditions. Moreover, unlike RHC, the UTC-RHC control gain approaches the optimal policy associated with the infinite horizon optimal control problem. To show these properties, non-standard Lyapunov functions are introduced for both discrete-time case and continuous-time case. Two topics of modern control are investigated in this dissertation, namely receding horizon control (RHC) and cooperative control of networked systems. We apply learning techniques to these two topics. Specifically, we incorporate the reinforcement learning concept into the standard receding horizon control, yielding a new RHC algorithm, and relax the stability constraints required for standard RHC. For the second topic, we apply neural adaptive control in synchronization of the networked nonlinear systems and propose distributed robust adaptive controllers such that all nodes synchronize to a leader node.

One bright summer's morning Silas had been more engrossed than usual in [...] "setting up" [...] a new piece of work, an occasion on which his scissors were in requisition. These scissors, owing to an especial warning of Dolly's, had been kept carefully out of Eppie's reach; but the click of them had had a peculiar attraction for her ear, and watching the results of that click, she had derived the philosophic lesson that the same cause would produce the same effect. Silas had seated himself in his loom, and the noise of weaving had begun; but he had left his scissors on a ledge which Eppie's arm was long enough to reach; and now, like a small mouse, watching her opportunity, she stole quietly from her corner, secured the scissors, and toddled to the bed again, setting up her back as a mode of concealing the fact. She had a distinct intention as {{to the use of the}} scissors; and having cut the linen strip in a jagged but effectual manner, in two moments she had run out at the open door where the sunshine was inviting her, while poor Silas believed her to be a better child than usual. It was not until he happened to need his scissors that the terrible fact burst upon him: Eppie had run out by herself--had perhaps fallen into the Stone-pit. Silas, shaken by the worst fear that could have befallen him, rushed out, calling [...] "Eppie!" [...] and ran eagerly about the unenclosed space, exploring the dry cavities into which she might have fallen, and then gazing with questioning dread at the smooth red surface of the water. The cold drops stood on his brow. How long had she been out? There was one hope--that she had crept through the stile and got into the fields, where he habitually took her to stroll. But the grass was high in the meadow, and there was no descrying her, if she were there, except by a close search that would be a trespass on Mr. Osgood's crop. Still, that misdemeanour must be committed; and poor Silas, after peering all round the hedgerows, traversed the grass, beginning with <b>perturbed</b> <b>vision</b> to see Eppie behind every group of red sorrel, and to see her moving always farther off as he approached.

Here, however, sat Eppie, discoursing cheerfully to her own small boot, which she was using as a bucket to convey the water into a deep hoof-mark, while her little naked foot was planted comfortably on a cushion of olive-green mud.

It {{is not a question}} for Mr. Tylor whether clairvoyance ever occurs: whether 'death-bed wraiths' have been seen to an extent not explicable by the laws of chance, whether disturbances and movements of objects not to be accounted for by human agency are matters of universal and often well-attested report. Into the question of fact, Mr. Tylor explicitly declines to enter; these things only concern him because they have been commonly explained by the 'animistic hypothesis,' that is, by the fancied action of spirits. The animistic hypothesis, again, is the result, naturally fallacious, of savage man's reasonings on life, death, sleep, dreams, trance, breath, shadow and the other kindred biological phenomena. Thus clairvoyance (on the animistic hypothesis) is the flight of the conscious 'spirit' of a living man across space or time; the 'deathbed wraith' is the visible apparition of the newly- emancipated 'spirit,' and 'spirits' cause the unexplained disturbances and movements of objects. In fact it is certain that the animistic hypothesis (though a mere fallacy) does colligate a great number of facts very neatly, and has persisted from times of low savagery to the present age of reason. So here is a case of the savage origin and persistent 'survival' of a hypothesis,--the most potent hypothesis in the history of humanity.|$|R
40|$|Disturbances play {{important}} roles in shaping ecological and evolutionary processes. By using <b>disturbances</b> to <b>perturb</b> natural systems, biologist can both develop generalizable predictions about how disturbances alter natural systems as well as utilize disturbances {{as a tool to}} test ecological and evolutionary theory. Using pesticide disturbances in aquatic systems, {{the first half of this}} thesis integrates ecology, evolution, and toxicology to develop predictions about the consequences of pesticides in aquatic communities and patterns of pesticide tolerance across populations of wood frogs (Lithobathes sylvaticus). Towards this goal, I first conducted a mesocosm study tracking the direct and indirect effects of four insecticides–applied individually and as a mixture– across 18 weeks and demonstrated that insecticides applied individually and in a mixture have complex direct and indirect consequences on aquatic system response and recovery not predicted by traditional laboratory tests. Second, I investigated the potential for cross-tolerance in non-target populations of wood frogs and demonstrate that amphibian populations with tolerance to one pesticide may be cross-tolerant to many other pesticides. The second half of this dissertation uses pesticides as a tool, to test theoretical predictions about the role of phenotypic plasticity in evolutionary innovation to novel environments. I investigated whether natural populations of wood frogs can respond plastically to pesticides (i. e. by inducing increased tolerance) and whether there is evidence supporting the process of genetic assimilation. This study is the first to demonstrate that sublethal and ecologically relevant concentrations of a common insecticide can, within the same generation, induce adaptive tolerance in amphibians and the population-level patterns of inducibility are consistent with predictions of genetic assimilation. Induced pesticide tolerance would be particularly beneficial to non-target species if it were to confer increased tolerance not only against the pesticide it first experienced, but also against many other pesticides (e. g., induced cross-tolerance). Using wood frogs, the final chapter of this dissertation demonstrated the phenomenon of induced cross-tolerance and suggests that cross-tolerance is not limited to insecticides that share mode of action. Overall, the inducible tolerance and cross-tolerance findings suggest that phenotypic plasticity may play a role in shaping patterns of species abundance in nature. ...|$|R

But those who press it as a reproach against Burke's memory, may be justly {{reminded}} that when Pitt died, after drawing the pay of a minister for twenty years, he left debts to the amount of forty thousand pounds. Burke, as I have said elsewhere, had none of the vices of profusion, but he had that quality which Aristotle places high among the virtues--the noble mean of Magnificence, standing midway between the two extremes of vulgar ostentation and narrow pettiness. At least, every creditor was paid in good time, and nobody suffered but himself. Those who think these disagreeable matters of supreme importance, and allow such things to stand between them and Brake's greatness, are like the people--slightly to alter a figure from a philosopher of old--who, when they went to Olympia, could only perceive that they were scorched by the sun, and pressed by the crowd, and deprived of comfortable means of bathing, and wetted by the rain, and that life was full of disagreeable and troublesome things, and so they almost forgot the great colossus of ivory and gold, Phidias's statue of Zeus, which they had come to see, and which stood in all its glory and power before their <b>perturbed</b> and foolish <b>vision.</b>|$|R
40|$|Rainforests in Southeast Asia are {{enormously}} important, both ecologically and socio-economically, {{but their}} sustainability is severely threatened by {{various forms of}} <b>disturbance</b> that <b>perturb</b> the dynamics of forests here and elsewhere. To help efforts to counter such threats, this thesis focuses {{on two of the}} most important forms of disturbance that currently affect tropical rainforests: logging and extreme climatic events. It is based on research conducted in the Gunung Rara Forest Reserve, in Sabah, Malaysia (approx. 4 ° 33 ´N, 117 ° 02 ´E). The project started in 1992 in a mixed dipterocarp lowland rainforest, involving establishment of a long-term experiment with a 2 x 2 factorial randomized block design, where slope was the blocking factor. Two selective logging methods, supervised logging (SL) and conventional logging (CL), both with (CC) and without (NCC) pre-harvest climber cutting, and a control treatment (C), were applied to evaluate their effects on key parameters of forest dynamics, including: ingrowth of new trees (≥ 10 cm diameter at breast height, DBH), growth of standing trees (survivor growth), tree mortality, and overall development of the stands. Analysis of data covering 18 years of subsequent stand development shows that SL with CC resulted in consistently higher stand volume recovery and ingrowth of dipterocarps, while suppressing establishment of pioneer species by up to 40 %, compared to either CL treatment, especially at high harvest intensities In addition, CC reduced overall mortality, suggesting that it can effectively reduce negative effects of harvest operations. Using linear mixed effect models, I also found that the stand level growth rate of dipterocarps was two times higher following SL with CC than following the CL treatment. Furthermore, diversity patterns of naturally regenerating trees (≥ 10 cm DBH) were studied over 10 years after selective logging, using the gradient of harvest intensity (0 - 16 trees ha- 1). Species richness peaked at intermediate levels of extraction, corroborating the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH), and suggesting that moderate levels (< 8 trees ha- 1) of harvesting may maintain tree biodiversity. Finally, I studied the effects of El Niño Southern Oscillation events on uncut forests and found that both the intensity and duration of these events strongly influenced the forest dynamics. However, long periods of moderate-intensity El Niño-associated drought had stronger effects on tree mortality and subsequent growth of survivor trees than peak intensities. The results also indicate that cumulative effects of multiple events, rather single events, should be considered. However, although fluctuations in basal area were observed over 19 years of repeated events, the findings suggest that the uncut tropical rainforest was quite resilient and has fairly good capacity to withstand repeated extreme climatic fluctuation...|$|R
40|$|During last years, wind {{generation}} {{has experienced a}} great expansion due to concern about climate change, the greenhouse effect caused by air pollution and scarcity of fossil resources. In this context, research efforts on new wind generators have increased new power converters topologies and its control strategies. Much of these resources done by innovation centers are focused on high-power (> 100 kW), leaving to a second place lower power applications mainly applied in isolated applications. However, these kinds of systems are really important considering a rural or isolated electrification framework. The present master’s project aims to contribute the study and development of electrical systems for micro-wind generation in off-grid systems. It has been designed an AC/DC converter with the capability of extracting the maximum power of the wind turbine. This is possible thanks to a maximum power point system based on <b>disturbance</b> based on <b>perturb</b> and observe algorithm, which does not require parameterization of the wind turbine, as usual. This last alternative involves a time and cost spending which is not justifiable in low power applications. In order to validate the converter and maximum power point search system, the present project has designed and implemented an experimental platform able of emulating real operation conditions of a wind system, too. In Chapter 3, it’s done {{the study of the}} state of art about the more relevant electrical systems of isolated low power wind applications. It has been fixed a group of needs and requirements of the electrical system, as well as a proposed power converter structure. Once the converter is proposed, Chapter 4 details its design considerations. First, the topology of Ac/DC converter is selected the chosen alternative consists in a three-phases rectifier diode bridge, a buck-boost converter and a current output filter for batteries. Then, has been chosen the design criteria and the components of the converter have been dimensioned. Then Chapter 5 develops a small-signal average model of the power converter getting the transfer functions necessary for control design. The control of the converter is managed by a "Observe & Perturbe" MPPT algorithm with fixed step followed by two cascaded PI controllers. This control allows working in a maximum power point with rectified voltage changes avoiding sudden changes in battery current. Once validated the control and the design of the converter through simulations, it has been implemented on an experimental platform for verify the prototype under various test proposed in Chapter 6. It has been also developed a wind turbine emulator able of generating a real operation environment by the wind system platform (Generator, AC/DC converter and batteries). Finally, Chapter 7 ends the work with some conclusions on the developed prototype and its design. This chapter allows extracting that the converter meets the aforementioned objectives. The system works on the maximum power point and the platform is able to emulate the operation of a wind turbine. Chapter 8 details some future work ideas to improve the current performance...|$|R
40|$|Given the {{increasing}} rate of environmental change that free-living animals are exposed to, {{there is a}} growing need to understand the causes and consequences of environmentally-induced phenotypic change and to what extent this phenotypic plasticity is adaptive. As well as being of fundamental biological significance, this knowledge is necessary for the development of effective conservation policies. This thesis examines variation in behavioural, morphological and physiological responses to repeated exposure to environmental stressors. In particular, I focus on early-life effects and discuss the potential consequences of developmental plasticity for later-life performance. Although negative effects of human disturbance on wild animals have been widely reported, few studies have considered the potential for effects on animals occupying burrows or cavities. Procellariiform seabirds are among the most globally-threatened avian taxa and include many species that nest underground. Human disturbance {{is one of the main}} threats they face, yet breeding colonies attract increasing numbers of tourists. The European storm petrel Hydrobates pelagicus is a small seabird, belonging to the Procellariiformes, that nests in cavities and is strictly nocturnally active at the breeding colony. The UK’s largest storm petrel colony at Mousa, Shetland, offers a novel system for investigating the potential impacts of human recreational disturbance on a cavity-dwelling animal and the capacity for environmentally-induced developmental plasticity within the remarkably slow development strategy displayed by nestlings. I show that, despite remaining out of <b>sight,</b> human <b>disturbance</b> above ground can have profound effects on cavity-dwelling animals. Nestling survival was significantly lower in areas exposed to high levels of human recreational activity, compared with those reared in areas subject to very low levels of visitor activity (Chapter 1). Furthermore, disturbed nestlings that survived to fledging displayed depressed growth rates (Chapter 2). Plasticity in developmental pathways, however, enabled nestlings to mitigate for poor growth conditions by prioritising energy allocation to structural components and extending the growth period. While such growth plasticity can be adaptive and avoid short-term costs, there may also be long-term costs associated with this strategy. Repeated exposure to stressors can give rise to chronic stress and measures of baseline glucocorticoids are widely considered to be useful for detecting stress in natural populations. Nestlings displayed no evidence for chronic stress, as measured by baseline corticosterone (the main glucocorticoid in birds), in response to repeated exposure to human recreational disturbance (Chapter 2) or investigator handling (Chapter 3). Furthermore, baseline corticosterone did not reflect the differences observed in growth trajectories between the two disturbance categories. Although it is unknown whether the induced changes in growth trajectories of high-disturbance nestlings carry costs, the lack of any effects on corticosterone levels suggests that glucocorticoids are not always an informative measure of individual state. Additional behavioural and physiological data are required to develop an integrated understanding of phenotypic responses to environmental cues. Besides immediate effects on growth and survival, it is well known that conditions experienced during early life can have profound influences on later-life performance. Telomere dynamics potentially provide a mechanistic link between the early environment and fitness outcomes. I show that environmental conditions during growth strongly influence early-life telomere dynamics of entire cohorts, and early-life telomere length is a good predictor of imminent mortality (Chapter 4). Natural variation in the natal environment can lead to marked differences in life-history traits between cohorts and telomere dynamics may be one of the mechanisms underlying cohort effects observed in nature. Unfavourable natal conditions were also associated with the occurrence of hypothermic responses in nestlings (Chapter 5). Such thermoregulatory responses may be adaptive, by facilitating survival during periods of food shortage or cold, but nonetheless could carry costs for growth and long-term fitness. An enhanced knowledge of the causes and consequences of facultative hypothermic responses can advance our understanding of the effects of environmental change. Understanding and predicting how populations will respond to environmental change, however, requires accurate estimation of population size. The ecology of Procellariiformes presents a major challenge to achieving this. Using spatially-explicit capture-recapture data from three closely-related species of storm petrel, it was shown that capture probability varies across spatial and temporal scales (Chapter 6). This quantified variation was used to inform optimal sampling strategies. The results demonstrate that spatially-explicit capture-recapture models can be effectively used to monitor vulnerable burrowing seabird populations, but require a species-specific approach. This thesis addresses key questions concerning the capacity for adaptation and response to environmental stress exposure and the mechanisms underlying individual variation in responses. I demonstrate that multidisciplinary studies of behaviour, morphology and physiology are required to develop an integrated understanding of responses to environmental stressors...|$|R
