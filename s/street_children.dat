5|$|Following {{cooperation}} between the local governmental council and the Prison Fellowship Romania Foundation, homeless people, <b>street</b> <b>children</b> and beggars are taken, identified and accommodated within the Christian Centers for <b>Street</b> <b>Children</b> and Homeless People, respectively, and the Ruhama centre. The latter features a marshaling center for beggars and <b>street</b> <b>children,</b> {{as well as a}} flophouse. As a consequence, the fluctuating movement of children, beggars and homeless people {{in and out of the}} centre has been considerably reduced, with most of the initial beneficiaries successfully integrated into the programme rather than returning to the streets.|$|E

There are numerous <b>street</b> <b>children,</b> whose poverty and lack of documented identity brings them into constant conflict with local law enforcement.|$|E

40|$|The <b>street</b> <b>child</b> that {{is driven}} by {{circumstances}} to live outside the supportive structure of the family, is on his own. He doesn’t have the educational developmental opportunities that children who grow up in families and societies do. He finds himself in a unique educational and living environment. From an educational psychologist’s point of view, this environment is abnormal. It is therefore a great challenge for the educational psychologist to try and avoid or resolve negative effects of the child's living environment. An exploratory-, descriptive-, contextual- and qualitative study was done, {{with the aim of}} gaining insight and understanding into the life of the <b>street</b> <b>child</b> in Hillbrow as well as his experiences of his situation. The results obtained from the interviews were placed in four categories. These categories are: The <b>street</b> <b>child’s</b> continuous struggle to survive, his need for a “normal child life”, his inability to accept responsibility and the presence of a normative awareness within the <b>street</b> <b>child.</b> In conclusion {{it is clear that the}} experiential world of the <b>street</b> <b>child</b> is multi-facetted. In general it appears that the <b>street</b> <b>child</b> has many limitations and difficulties which he experiences, and that input by an educational psychologist can have meaningful influence in his life...|$|R

The visit was conducted for an NDTV show, Jai Jawan, on which entertainers and actors visit Indian troops. While there, she also met children with disabilities at a special school maintained by the army. In August, along with Mumbai-based artist Gurcharan Singh, Zinta painted for the cause of <b>street</b> <b>children</b> for the non-governmental organisation Khushi. In December, she joined the efforts of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) to curb human trafficking in India. She spoke on behalf of awareness against the practice, the need for protection and rehabilitation for those rescued from it, and punishment for perpetrators.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, the Belgian team {{directly}} supported charity. Between 1914 and 1941 {{they played}} at minimum five unofficial games {{of which the}} returns were for charitable purposes: two against France, and three against the Netherlands. In mid-1986, when the Belgian delegation reached the Mexico World Cup semi-finals, the squad started a project titled Casa Hogar, an idea of delegation leader Michel D'Hooghe. Casa Hogar is a home for <b>street</b> <b>children</b> in the Mexican industrial city of Toluca, to which the footballers donated part of their tournament bonuses. In August 2013, the national team supported four social projects through the charity fund Football+ Foundation, by playing an A-match with a plus sign {{on the shoulders of}} their jerseys and auctioning the shirts.|$|E

Later on in 1988, she provided coverage of that year's Summer Olympics, held in Seoul, for ITV. During the mid-1980s, she also joined the presenting team of the BBC children's news programme, Newsround, with a view to increasing its sports coverage, and presented several features on topics such as gymnastics and female jockeys, as well as presenting Newsround Extra, a show that covered a specific issue in more detail. One such programme was a report on the <b>street</b> <b>children</b> of Bogotá, a subject that deeply moved her and reduced her to tears on screen.|$|E

5|$|Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol at a {{time when}} the British were {{examining}} and exploring Christmas traditions from the past, such as carols, as well as new customs such as Christmas trees. He was influenced by experiences from his own past, and from the Christmas stories of other authors, including Washington Irving and Douglas Jerrold. Dickens had written three Christmas stories prior to the novella, and was inspired to write the story following a visit to the Field Lane Ragged school, one of several establishments for London's half-starved, illiterate <b>street</b> <b>children.</b> The treatment of the poor and the ability of a self-interested man redeeming himself by transforming into a more sympathetic character are the key themes of the story. There is discussion among academics as to whether this was a fully secular story, or if it is a Christian allegory.|$|E
25|$|Other {{studies have}} found that many {{illnesses}} are very prevalent among <b>street</b> <b>children.</b> A study conducted in 2002 on the <b>street</b> <b>children</b> in Kolkata found that six in every 554 <b>street</b> <b>children</b> from ages five to fourteen are HIV positive. In Bangor Basti, 98 percent of children are estimated to have dental caries. Additionally, most <b>street</b> <b>children</b> do not have winter clothing, leaving them more vulnerable to illness during the winter.|$|E
25|$|Because it is {{difficult}} to obtain precise and accurate statistics about <b>street</b> <b>children,</b> information about their ages is approximate. Most of the <b>street</b> <b>children</b> in India are over 6, and the majority is over 8. The mean age of <b>street</b> <b>children</b> in a National Institute of Urban Affairs study in 1989 was 13 years. Another study in 1989 by UNICEF found that 72 percent of the <b>street</b> <b>children</b> studied were ages 6–12 and 13 percent were under 6 years of age.|$|E
