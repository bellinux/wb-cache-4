In this paper, corporate motives for CSR are explored, along with the notion of an altruistic ethical impulse among business leaders or managers, perhaps motivated by religious beliefs. It is suggested that the formal adoption of CSR by corporations could be associated with the changing personal values of managers and that there may be an association between different industries, the personal values of the managers who work in them and their commitment to CSR. This paper is preparatory to an empirical investigation that will address how corporate social responsibility (CSR) is interpreted and institutionalised by organisations, including an analysis of firms’ perceptions of the boundaries regarding where and to whom their corporate social responsibilities lie...|$|E

To limit the scope of my research to a reasonable size, I selected year 2004 because three elections were held that year: European Parliament elections, Senate elections, and local authority elections. The exact topic of this thesis is "Analysis of the Means of Communication and Self-Presentation of Czech Parliamentary Parties in 2004, Before and After the Czech Republic Joined the European Union". There are three basic components of my thesis: the theoretical part exploring the notion of political communication, the descriptive part dealing with the political system of the Czech Republic in the given year, and finally the analysis of the communication methods of the selected parties.

Various methodological issues are relevant in determining whether there is merely an association or also a causal relationship. These include the definition of sexual abuse, the degree and timing of abuse, the methods of data collection, sample selection, {{the presence or absence}} of control groups, possible recall bias, difficulties with prospective studies for this <b>subject,</b> <b>and</b> the <b>definition</b> of alcohol misuse or dependence. Results with community and victim samples are conflicting, but studies on samples of problem drinkers suggest an association between severe alcohol problems and previous sexual abuse, at least in women. The association may be especially strong for earlier and more severe forms of sexual abuse. Possible mechanisms for an association were examined and are: (1) sexual abuse as a cause of alcohol misuse; (2) alcohol misuse predisposing people to sexual assault; (3) sexual assault and alcohol misuse both resulting from another factor; (4) sexual abuse predisposing to other conditions associated with alcohol misuse; and (5) an artefactual association. Regardless of the role of sexual abuse in causing alcohol problems, the available evidence suggests that victims of sexual abuse may present to services with more problematical patterns of drinking and more concurrent psychiatric disorder...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} items exposure rate in computer adaptive testing and its relation with the structure of an item bank. An item is a structure defined by real and/or virtual components possibly containing text, image, audio and/or video elements, which are useful to build a context where a question is made about, and of diverse elements or mechanisms for information acquisition to provide an answer to this question. Every item has an associated difficulty that depends on how easy is {{to answer the question}} about the defined context. An item bank is a deposit of this kind of structures and, in this paper, the item bank structure is defined in terms of statistical indexes arising from the onedimensional Order Statistics Theory, namely, nearest neighbor index and the standard variate of normal curve; and another one from the concept of compactness of intervals of real numbers. In this sense, the work talks about items difficulty exposure rate assuming that the item bank is, in fact, defined by a finite discrete set of items difficulties. Therefore, the emphasis is given on the items difficulty and it is assumed that the number of items per difficulty in the item bank is unlimited. The experimental results are obtained through a simulation environment that takes into account the definition of the structure of an item bank, the definition of a testing <b>subject</b> <b>and</b> the <b>definition</b> of an item administration context. Therefore, the results are mainly experimental rather than theoretical, although the validation of the simulation environment is based on theoretical results of other authors in the field...|$|R
40|$|The growing {{realisation}} {{that the}} benzodiazepines have potential for causing serious harm has caused concern {{due to their}} wide and common use. This has stimulated interest in {{the costs and benefits}} of their use. This paper is a review of the adverse effects of benzodiazepines, and concentrates on four areas of particular concern: drug dependence which the consequent withdrawal symptoms; psychological effects while on the drugs; use by the elderly’ and tolerance to the drug effects. Although the phenomenon of a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome is generally accepted, there is still controversy over the frequency amongst users. A number of major studies are reviewed here, and the main methodological issues are discussed. These include definition of the withdrawal symptoms, selection of <b>subjects,</b> <b>and</b> use of double-blind, placebo-controlled conditions. The studies investigating impairment with benzodiazepine use deal mainly with motor performance and coordination, although there is a large group of studies looking at the effect of the drugs on memory. Although the studies reviewed make a considerable contribution to the understanding of the effects of benzodiazepines, they focus on physiological and specific psychological variables, rather than more global measures of functioning and behaviour. It is suggested here that this emphasis needs to change in order to obtain a clearer picture of how benzodiazepines affect quality of life. Future studies should also be prospective in design, and include clear criteria for the selection of <b>subjects</b> <b>and</b> for the <b>definition</b> of withdrawal symptoms. benzodiazepine, adverse effects, drug, withdrawl...|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} my {{research}} is the degree of alignment between standards and assessment in the history A-level course in the Swedish upper secondary school. The aim is to measure the alignment and find explanations for the degree in general and for differences, if any, among the teachers. The theoretical backdrop for my research is (a) assessment theories about curriculum validity and the validity of assessment and (b) theories of history education. These two theoretical frameworks are chosen {{for their ability to}} clarify the relationship between the standards and the teacher made assessment material. My research relies on both quantitative and qualitative methods. The teachers in the study are chosen by single random sampling, using cluster sampling in two stages. First 35 schools were selected and then one history teacher at each school was selected. 23 teachers have contributed with all the written assessment material used in one course. The material comprises of tests and instructions for various assignments. The standards and the items in the assessment material are categorised, by qualitative text analyses, using Blooms revised taxonomy. A comparison between standards and assessment has been made with regard to two perspectives, balance and share. Five teachers in the sample have been interviewed in order to find out about their assessment strategies. They have been chosen {{on the basis of their}} assessment materials alignment with the standards. The strategies found have been used, together with the theoretical framework, to explain the degree of alignment of all teachers in average as well as the differences in alignment between teachers. The results indicate weak alignment between standards and assessment in average. There also seem to be differences between teachers. The interviews indicate that both (a) factors specific to the <b>subject</b> of history <b>and</b> (b) factors external to the subject can help explaining the alignment results. Subject specific factors, among others, are views on <b>subject</b> construction <b>and</b> <b>definition</b> of standards cognitive complexity. External factors are the absence of both assessment education and professional discussions about assessment at work. A tentative conclusion is that assessment can be regarded as both a <b>subject</b> specific <b>and</b> a general competence...|$|R
40|$|The article {{deals with}} Maimon’s {{critical}} reinterpretation of Kant’s theory of analytic judgments. Maimon {{contributed to the}} history of the German Idealism primarily through his criticism of Kant’s theoretical philosophy, which largely predetermined some ideas of Fichte and later exerted a certain influence on the thinkers of some very different schools (from Marburg Neo-Kantianism to Deleuze). Maimon’s attitude toward Kant’s views on the nature of analytic judgments underwent an essential change in the process of his theoretical evolution: while in “Essay on Transcendental Philosophy” (1790) he had generally agreed with the definitions given to them by Kant, in “Essay Towards a New Logic or Theory of Thought” (1794) he already accomplished a detailed criticism of Kant’s differentiation between analytic and synthetic judgments. According to Maimon, the definition given to analytic judgments by Kant deprived these judgments of the status of thinking at all, since it reduced them to the extraction of something, which the thinking had already ins erted in to the concept, from the same concept. Maimon proposed his own formulation of the difference between analytic and synthetic judgments, based on his theory of a real cognition as of a connection of a definable (<b>subject)</b> <b>and</b> a <b>definition</b> (predicate). According to this formulation, he defined analytic judgments as the ones in which thinking proceeded from a given definite to the definable that is contained in it. Therefore in his philosophy analytic judgments became full-fledged cognitive acts, which differed from the synthetic ones only in that they provided cognition not of some new objects, but of the ones which had already been thought of. Thereby Maimon substantially broadened the area of analytic judgments at the cost of the synthetic ones, which ultimately allowed him to reinterpret the relation of the formal and transcendental logic, <b>and</b> also to <b>subject</b> the formal logic itself to a thorough revision...|$|R

40|$|A cohort {{mortality}} {{study of}} rock salt workers {{was carried out}} in Volterra, Italy. The occupational risk factors identified during environmental hygiene surveys were high noise levels and exposure to dusts and to chrysotile asbestos. The cohort consists of 487 <b>subjects</b> (367 males <b>and</b> 120 females) employed in the mine between 1 / 1 / 1965 and 12 / 31 / 1989. At the end of follow-up, 387 individuals were alive (295 males and 92 females), and 100 were decreased (72 males and 28 females). For two decedents, {{the cause of death was}} unknown. Regional rates were used for the computation of standardized mortality ratios (SMRs). In the entire cohort, observed mortality for all causes was similar to expected (SMR = 98, 100 obs); SMR for all cancer was 127 (41 obs); for lung cancer, the SMR was 146 (10 obs). Two cases of pleural mesothelioma, both in males, resulted in a statistically significant elevation of this cause (SMR = 741, 90 % confidence interval (CI) 131 - 2, 332). Two malignant brain tumors were detected (SMR 328, 90 % CI 58 - 1, 032); one of these was identified as a secondary neoplasm with consideration of additional clinical information. Among males, mortality for all cancers was significantly increased (SMR = 140, 90 % CI 106 - 192). The observed mortality for malignant tumors of the digestive and the respiratory systems was higher than expected. In women, two cases of malignant ovarian cancer were observed vs. 0. 42 expected on the basis of the regional rates. Increased mortality from lung and pleural tumors was consistent with the exposure to asbestos, which has also been shown to play a role in the development of ovarian tumors. The main limitations of this study were the small number of <b>subjects</b> <b>and</b> the <b>definition</b> of exposure solely in terms of duration of employment.

Primary outcomes have typically utilized overly simplistic outcomes that fail to entirely account for complex illness syndromes. We sought to characterize clinical outcomes associated with experimental infection with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and to develop a disease score. Data were obtained from prior controlled human ETEC infection studies. Correlation and univariate regression across sign and symptom severity was performed. A multiple correspondence analysis was conducted. A 3 -parameter disease score with construct validity was developed in an iterative fashion, compared to standard outcome <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> applied to prior vaccine challenge trials. Data on 264 subjects receiving seven ETEC strains at doses from 1 x 105 to 1 x 1010 cfu were used to construct a standardized dataset. The strongest observed correlation was between vomiting and nausea (r = 0. 65); however, stool output was poorly correlated with subjective activity-impacting outcomes. Multiple correspondence analyses showed covariability in multiple signs and symptoms, with severity being the strongest factor corresponding across outcomes. The developed disease score performed well compared to standard outcome <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> differentiated disease in vaccinated <b>and</b> unvaccinated <b>subjects.</b> Frequency <b>and</b> volumetric <b>definitions</b> of diarrhea severity poorly characterize ETEC disease. These data support a disease severity score accounting for stool output and other clinical signs and symptoms.
