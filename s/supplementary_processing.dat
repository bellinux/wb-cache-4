It {{is consistent with the}} intuition that in the human vision system the edge points always appear where the change of grey-level is greatest within their neighbourhood. In this paper, triple-diagonal gradient-based {{edge detection}} is introduced. It is based on the features of Spiral Architecture and computes the gradients in three diagonal directions instead of approximating the gradient in one direction only as the traditional methods do. Essentially, it improves the accuracy for locating edge points. As a result, it does not need any <b>supplementary</b> <b>processing</b> to enhance the edge map...|$|E

40|$|The AIC 111 is an ultralow-power, {{fixed sample}} rate, sigma-delta codec {{with a sample}} rate of 40 kHz and a usable {{bandwidth}} of 10 kHz. Typically, most applications process data at sample rates of 8 kHz, 16 kHz, and 20 kHz. This requires that the DSP or microprocessor connected to the AIC 111 decimate the incoming data from 40 kHz down to the required sampling frequency, and interpolate the data back up to 40 kHz. This document outlines several methods and examples of resampling incoming data from the AIC 111 at 40 kHz to the required processing sampling rate between 8 kHz and 20 kHz using decimation and interpolation techniques on a digital signal processor (DSP) or a microprocessor. In many situations, {{it may also be}} possible to exploit characteristics of <b>supplementary</b> signal <b>processing</b> stages in the system to relax filter specifications or even remove certain resampling stages for additional savings in computation.

The Bank selects the range of age (18 - 50 years) for ligament allograft and the evaluation protocol for detection of microbic contaminations (following international guidelines).

When a careful review of the medical social history, and serologic tests shows eligibility of the tissue for transplant, the allograft is processed in a clean room at the appropriate size and x-ray are taken for future matching.

40|$|Seismic {{reflection}} {{surveys are}} frequently conducted over very complicated geological structure, but survey-ing often must {{be confined to}} existing crooked roads or tracks. Typically, data from such 2 D crooked-line surveys are processed using standard common midpoint (CMP) stacking techniques to obtain a 2 D time section which is then 2 D migrated. In Part I, we show that a reflector dip component across the processing line can cause serious problems for standard CMP stacking. We also propose a <b>supplementary</b> <b>processing</b> step in which cross-dip is determined locally and cross-dip moveout (CDMO) is removed from data to form an optimum cross-dip stack. However, a crooked-line survey is really a swath 3 D sur-vey, and ideally {{we would like to}} obtain a 3 D image of reflectivity surrounding the profile. Here we investigate the potential of 3 D prestack Kirchhoff migration to directly image all observed re-flections; i. e., we attempt to construct a 3 D image volume of all reflectors viewed by the survey. Because reflectors that face away from the acquisition line cannot return much wave energy from available sources to available re-ceivers, they cannot be imaged even if they lie directly be-neath the survey profile. Tests show that the cross-profile spread of trace midpoints usually is sufficient to pro-vide a useful degree of cross-line positioning of reflection points. A very helpful image volume is thus obtained. Kirchhoff 3 D prestack migration is computationally laborious. A much quicker but less complete method is to create the 3 D migrated image volume from the 2 D optimum cross-dip stack and the associated set of cross-dips. Robustness of migration methods to time errors in the prestack data traces such as poorly corrected statics is also an issue. Tests show that in difficult cases, particu-larly where only 2 D processing is warranted, migration of trace absolute amplitude rather than standard phase data may lead to a superior result...|$|E
40|$|In {{translation}} process and language production research, pauses {{are seen as}} indicators of cognitive processing. Investigating the correlations between source text machine translatability and post-editing effort involves an assessment of cognitive effort. Therefore, an analysis of pauses is essential. This paper presents data from a research project which includes an analysis of pauses in post-editing, triangulated with the Choice Network Analysis method and Translog. Results suggest that the pause-to-keyboarding ratio does not differ significantly for sentences deemed to be more suitable for machine translation than for those deemed to be less suitable. Also, results confirm the finding in research elsewhere that pause duration and frequency is subject to individual differences. Finally, we suggest that while pauses provide some indication of cognitive <b>processing,</b> <b>supplementary</b> methods are required to give a fuller picture...|$|R

40|$|A {{scalable}} {{and reverse}} compatible multichannel method of spatial audio using transaural coding designed for multiple-loudspeaker feeds is described {{with a focus}} on attaining optimum ear signals. A Fourier transform method for computing HRTF matrices is employed, including the generation of a subset of band-limited reproduction channels. Applications considered embrace multichannel audio, DVD, virtual reality, and telepresence. 0 INTRODUCTION The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate how transaural processing can enhance conventional multichannel audio both by embedding perceptually relevant information and by improving image stability using additional loudspeakers integrated with <b>supplementary</b> digital <b>processing</b> and coding. The key objective is to achieve scalability in spatial performance while retaining full compatibility with conventional multichannel formats. This enables the system in its most basic form with unprocessed loudspeaker feeds to be used in a conventional multichannel installation. However, by appropriate signal processing additional loudspeaker feeds can be derived, together with the option of exploiting buried data to extract more signals in order to improve spatial resolution. The system is therefore hierarchical in terms of number of loudspeakers, channels, and ultimately spatial resolution, while in its simplest incarnation it remains fully compatible with the system configurations used with multichannel DVD-A and SACD replay equipment. The multichannel capabilities of DVD 1 technology [1], [2] were designed to enhance stereo 2 sound reproduction by offering surround image and improved envelopment capabilities. Normally multichannel audio encoded onto DVD assumes the ITU standard of a five-loudspeaker configuration driven by five discrete wide-band “loudspeaker feeds. ” However, a limitation of this system is the lack of a methodology to synthesize virtual images capable of three-dimensional audio (that is, a perception of direction, distance, and height together with acoustic envelopment...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} quickest {{detection}} {{of a change}} in distribution is considered under the assumption that the pre-change distribution is known, and the post-change distribution is only known to belong to a family of distributions distinguishable from a discretized version of the pre-change distribution. A sequential change detection procedure is proposed that partitions the sample space into a finite number of bins, and monitors the number of samples falling into each of these bins to detect the change. A test statistic that approximates the generalized likelihood ratio test is developed. It is shown that the proposed test statistic can be efficiently computed using a recursive update scheme, and a procedure for choosing the number of bins in the scheme is provided. Various asymptotic properties of the test statistic are derived to offer insights into its performance trade-off between average detection delay and average run length to a false alarm. Testing on synthetic and real data demonstrates that our approach is comparable or better in performance to existing non-parametric change detection methods.

ConclusionsThe degree of similarity between cognitive profiles of younger and older MA-matched groups suggests that a common mechanism may indeed underlie variability in individual differences and development. The findings further suggest that children of different ages, who are of the same overall ability level, are at the same developmental and intellectual level.
