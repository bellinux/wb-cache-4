40|$|The black poplar, Populus nigra L. (Salicaceae), grows {{predominantly}} along {{rivers and}} streams in Turkey. It is valuable because of its rapid growth and has been the tree chosen for plantations where a quick return on the investment was desired by growers. It has been planted for firewood and timber, and, to a lesser extent, for soil conservation and ornamental plantings. The <b>small</b> <b>poplar</b> <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle,</b> Saperda populnea L. (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), {{is one of the}} most injurious and widespread Holarctic insect pests of poplars (Populus spp.) and willows (Salix spp.) (Georgiev, 2001). It is a xylophagous insect; larvae bore into the xylem tissue, causing galls at the point of infection on young stems and twigs of the host plants (Georgiev et al., 2004). Saperd...|$|E

40|$|<b>Longhorn</b> <b>beetles</b> (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) {{have been}} used to {{identify}} sites of high biological diversity and conservation value in cultivated landscapes, but were rarely studied in changing landscapes of humid tropics. This study was conducted in a region of southern Yunnan, China, which was dominated by natural rainforest until 30 years ago, but is successively transformed into commercial rubber monoculture plantations since that time. The objectives were to investigate <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle</b> species diversity and distribution in the major land use types of this landscape and to estimate the effects of an expected expansion of rubber plantations on the <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle</b> assemblages. The results showed that tree species diversity (181 species in total) and <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle</b> diversity (220 species in total) were closely related with {{no significant differences between the}} tree and <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetles</b> assemblages shown by similarity distance analysis. There was a highly positive relationship between the estimated species richness of <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetles</b> and the number of tree species. Individual numbers of <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetles</b> and trees were also highly positive related at the sampling sites. Non-metric multidimensional scaling revealed that the degree of canopy coverage, succession age and tree diversity explained 78. 5 % of the total variation in <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle</b> assemblage composition. Natural forest sites had significantly higher numbers of species and individuals than any other type of habitat. Although young rubber plantations bear the highest <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle</b> diversity outside forests (half of the total number of <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle</b> species recorded in total), they can not provide permanen...|$|R
