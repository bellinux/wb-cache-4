25|$|Phenomena from {{mathematics}} {{and computer science}} such as cellular automata, random graphs, and some instances of evolutionary computation and artificial life exhibit features of self-organization. In <b>swarm</b> <b>robotics,</b> self-organization is used to produce emergent behavior. In particular the theory of random graphs {{has been used as}} a justification for self-organization as a general principle of complex systems. In the field of multi-agent systems, understanding how to engineer systems that are capable of presenting self-organized behavior is an active research area. Optimization algorithms can be considered self-organizing because they aim to find the optimal solution to a problem. If the solution is considered as a state of the iterative system, the optimal solution is the selected, converged structure of the system. Self-organizing networks include small-world networks and scale-free networks. These emerge from bottom-up interactions, unlike top-down hierarchical networks within organizations, which are not self-organizing. Cloud computing systems have been argued to be inherently self-organising, but while they have some autonomy, they are not self-managing as they do not have the goal of reducing their own complexity.|$|E

40|$|<b>Swarm</b> <b>robotic</b> {{systems are}} often {{considered}} to be dependable. However, there is little empirical evidence or theoretical analysis showing that dependability is an inherent property of all <b>swarm</b> <b>robotic</b> system. Recent literature has identified potential issues with respect to dependability within certain types of <b>swarm</b> <b>robotic</b> algorithms. There {{appears to be a}} dearth of literature relating to the testing of <b>swarm</b> <b>robotic</b> systems; this provides motivation {{for the development of the}} novel testing methods for <b>swarm</b> <b>robotic</b> systems presented in this paper. We present a search based approach, using genetic algorithms, for the automated identification of unintended behaviors during the execution of a flocking type algorithm, implemented on a simulated <b>robotic</b> <b>swarm.</b> Results show that this proposed approach is able to reveal faults in such flocking algorithms and has the potential to be used in further <b>swarm</b> <b>robotic</b> applications...|$|R

2500|$|Ant {{robotics}} is {{a special}} case of <b>swarm</b> <b>robotics.</b> Swarm robots are simple and cheap robots with limited sensing and computational capabilities. This makes it feasible to deploy teams of swarm robots {{and take advantage of}} the resulting fault tolerance and parallelism. In 1991, American electrical engineer James McLurkin was the first to conceptualize the idea of [...] "robot ants" [...] while working at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The robots consisted of sensors, infrared emitters, and communication systems capable of detecting objects in their path. McLurkin's invention was through studying the behavior of real ants in ant colonies and keeping ant farms as a basis for his programming. Through this examination, he could better understand how insects structured their workloads in order to produce a viable and working prototype of robotic ants.|$|E
2500|$|Partially {{inspired}} by colonies of insects such as ants and bees, researchers are modelling the behaviour of swarms {{of thousands of}} tiny robots which together perform a useful task, such as finding something hidden, cleaning, or spying. Each robot is quite simple, but the emergent behaviour of the swarm is more complex. The whole set of robots {{can be considered as}} one single distributed system, in the same way an ant colony can be considered a superorganism, exhibiting swarm intelligence. The largest swarms so far created is the 1024 robot Kilobot swarm. [...] Other large swarms include the iRobot swarm, the SRI International/ActivMedia Robotics Centibots project, and the Open-source Micro-robotic Project swarm, which are being used to research collective behaviours. Swarms are also more resistant to failure. Whereas one large robot may fail and ruin a mission, a swarm can continue even if several robots fail. This could make them attractive for space exploration missions, where failure is normally extremely costly. In addition to ground vehicles, <b>swarm</b> <b>robotics</b> includes also research of swarms of aerial robots and heterogeneous teams of ground and aerial vehicles.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Granuloma is {{a medical}} term for a ball-like {{collection}} of immune cells that attempts to remove foreign substances from a host organism. This response is a special type of inflammatory reaction common {{to a wide variety}} of diseases. Granulomas are an organised collection of macrophages, whose formation involves the stimulation of macrophages as well as T-Cells. Fault tolerance in <b>swarm</b> <b>robotic</b> systems is essential to the continued operation of <b>swarm</b> <b>robotic</b> systems. Under certain conditions, a failing robot can have a detrimental effect on the overall swarm behaviour, causing stagnation in the swarm and affecting its ability to undertake its task. Our study is concerned specifically with modelling the trafficking of macrophages and T-cells in the development of granuloma formation, and using that as a basis to create a self-healing <b>swarm</b> <b>robotic</b> system, in the context of power system failure.

In <b>swarm</b> <b>robotic</b> systems, a number of simple robots can perform complex tasks efficiently than a single robot, giving robustness and flexibility to the group. However, robustness is {{one of the issues that}} need to be resolved as most of time the robots are suffering from low energy while performing the task. The main objectives of this paper are to highlight the robustness issue in <b>swarm</b> <b>robotic</b> systems and propose a solution to allow swarm robots to remain robust on achieving its task. To demonstrate the problem, foraging algorithm, which is inspired by ant’s behaviour, is simulated to highlight the problem of low energy in <b>swarm</b> <b>robotic</b> system and its effect on its robustness. One of the solutions is mainly by using power stations or banks, but both have its own limitation which are highlighted and discussed in this paper. Finally, the paper also explains on a potential mechanism, inspired by an immune system response, that will help swarm robots overcome the problem of low energy...|$|R

40|$|<b>Swarm</b> <b>robotic</b> {{systems can}} offer {{advantages}} of robustness, flexibility and scalability, just like social insects. One assumption {{that is made}} {{by the majority of}} <b>swarm</b> <b>robotic</b> researchers, particularly in software simulation, is that a <b>robotic</b> <b>swarm</b> is a group of identical robots, there is no difference between any two of them. However, differences among hardware robots are unavoidable. These hardware differences, albeit small, affect the robots response to its environment. In this work, robots with hardware variation have been modeled and simulated in a line following scenario. It is found that even small hardware variations can result in behavioral heterogeneity. Although the variations can be compensated by the controllers in training, the hardware variation and resulting differences in controller settings are amplified in the non-linear interaction between robot and environment. Accordingly, the behavior of the identically trained robots in the same environment are subject to divergence...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Morphogenesis is the {{biological}} process that governs self-organized spatial pattern formation of cells during the embryonic development of multi-cellular organisms. Inspired by this process, we {{have proposed a}} morphogenetic framework for pattern formation and boundary coverage in a distributed <b>swarm</b> <b>robotic</b> system. The framework is based only on local communications among robots and will set up a local coordinate system. This paper focuses on the theoretical and empirical analysis of the framework regarding two aspects, namely, local communication load among the robots, and system performance such as system convergence time and average travel distance of robots for several pattern formation tasks. Results show that the proposed framework is efficient and scalable for self-organizing distributed <b>swarm</b> <b>robotic</b> systems with reasonable local communication load among robots.

40|$|A <b>swarm</b> <b>robotic</b> {{system is}} {{normally}} characterised by many individuals, each having a partial/limited {{knowledge about the}} global pattern of which it constitutes an element. In such a system, decision-making processes may be problematic. However, inspiration {{can be drawn from}} insect societies, in which self-organisation plays a crucial role in most of the decisions taken by the colony. In this work, we show how, in a <b>swarm</b> <b>robotic</b> system, a decision can be the result of a collective process: it emerges from the numerous interactions among the individuals and between individuals and environment. We present a task in which a swarm of physically connected, simulated robots has to take a decision whether to pass over a trough or change direction of motion if the gap is too wide to be bridged. We show how such a decision can be collectively taken, based only on a self-organising process. ...|$|R

40|$|Embryonic {{development}} of multi-cellular organisms {{is governed by}} gene regulatory networks (GRNs), which are a collection of genes that {{interact with one another}} and with other chemicals in the cell. Inspired by the morphogenesis of biological organisms, in this paper, we propose a morphogenetic approach using a gene regulatory network (GRN) for <b>swarm</b> <b>robotic</b> systems to form complex shapes in a distributed manner. The target pattern, represented by non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS), is embedded into the gene regulatory model, analogous to the morphogen gradients in multi-cellular development. Since the total number of robots is unknown to each robot, a dynamic neighborhood adaptation mechanism is proposed to evenly deploy the robots on the boundary of the target pattern. A theoretical proof of the system convergence is provided. Various simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed algorithm offers an effective and robust distributed control mechanism for <b>swarm</b> <b>robotic</b> systems to construct complex shapes. Furthermore, proof-of-concept experiments were successfully undertaken using e-puck mobile robots, which demonstrate that the proposed model works well with physical constraints of real robots. © 2012 Elsevier B.
