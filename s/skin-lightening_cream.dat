5000|$|Hindustan Unilever's [...] "Fair and Lovely" [...] is {{the leading}} <b>skin-lightening</b> <b>cream</b> for women in India. The company had to cease {{television}} advertisements for the product in 2007. Advertisements depicted depressed, dark-complexioned women, who had been ignored by employers and men, suddenly finding new boyfriends and glamorous careers after the cream had lightened their skin. In 2008 Hindustan Unilever made former Miss World Priyanka Chopra a brand ambassador for Pond's, and she then appeared in a mini-series of television commercials for another skin lightening product, 'White Beauty', alongside Saif Ali Khan and Neha Dhupia; these advertisements, showing Priyanka's face with a clearly darker complexion against the visibly fairer Neha Dhupia, were widely criticised for perpetuating racism and lowering the self-esteem of women and girls throughout India who were misled by HULN {{to believe that they}} needed to be white to be beautiful.|$|E
40|$|The {{popularity}} of the Internet and online media {{has led to the}} increased availability of prescription-strength, skin-lightening products contributing to a rise in their use among people with various skin pigment disorders. These products may contain a wide variety of active ingredients such as heavy metals, hydroquinone, and corticosteroids that can be highly toxic, especially after prolonged application. For decades, there have been case reports of both corticosteroid and heavy metal toxicity related to <b>skin-lightening</b> <b>cream</b> use. We report a case of a child who developed status epilepticus after ingesting a skin-lightening solution containing 2 % hydroquinone.

40|$|The adult {{nephrotic}} syndrome as met with in Nairobi is predominantly encountered in young sophisticated African women, {{most of whom}} began to use <b>skin-lightening</b> <b>creams</b> containing mercury before the symptomatic onset of their illness. The particular form of mercury involved is well known to cause the {{nephrotic syndrome}} in other circumstances—for example, when applied to the skin {{in the treatment of}} psoriasis. In these circumstances the pathogenetic mechanism is thought to be of an idiosyncratic type. The use of mercury-containing <b>skin-lightening</b> <b>creams</b> in the patients studied seemed to be particularly associated with a “minimal-change” (“light-negative”) renal glomerular lesion, this lesion being present in half of the patients. The prognosis in this group of patients seems remarkably good, with 50 % entering remission, 77 % of these doing so spontaneously on discontinuing the use of the creams...|$|R
30|$|Majority of the <b>skin-lightening</b> <b>creams</b> {{analysed}} in {{this study}} originated for Cote d’Voire (34  %), Italy (30  %) and India (13  %). The rest originated from UK, USA, Senegal, China, Germany, Nigeria and Ghana. T-mercury concentration (μg/g) in the <b>skin-lightening</b> <b>creams</b> imported from Cote d’Voire ranged from < 0.001 to 0.327  ±  0.062, < 0.001 to 0.250  ±  0.031 in creams imported for Italy and < 0.001 to 0.182  ±  0.057 in creams imported from India. About 28 % of the creams recorded T-mercury concentration below detection (< 0.001  μg/g). The highest concentration of T-mercury was recorded in EG which is imported from Cote d’Voire. T-mercury concentration in soaps ranged from 0.003  ±  0.000 to 0.337  ±  0.073  μg/g. All the <b>skin-lightening</b> <b>creams</b> and soaps analysed had T-mercury concentration below 1.0  μg/g maximum limit set by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) (USFDA 2009). Similar results were reported by Voegborlo et al. (2008). However, previous studies conducted by Al-Saleh and Al-Doush (1997) on mercury concentration in creams obtained from the Saudi Arabians market which originated from Asia and Middle East contained T-mercury concentration above the US FDA limit. Results of T-mercury determined in cosmetic products obtained on Dares Salaam market in Tanzania also showed very high concentration of mercury in some creams and soaps above the US FDA limit with T-mercury ranged from 0.11 to 8665  μg/g in cosmetic soaps and 0.16 – 25.30  μg/g in cosmetic creams (Kinabo 2003).|$|R

30|$|Most of {{the skins}} {{lightening}} creams and soaps on the Ghanaian market are imported from USA, Europe, Italy and Cote d’Voire (Voegborlo et al. 2008). The demand for skin-lightening products in Ghana {{is on the}} increase despite the health hazards {{associated with the use}} of these products. However, data on mercury and hydroquinone levels in <b>skin-lightening</b> soaps and <b>creams</b> sold on the Ghanaian market are lacking and only little work has been done on mercury (Voegborlo et al. 2008) even though concerns have been raised on the negative effect of <b>skin-lightening</b> <b>creams</b> and soaps on the skin. The aim of this work was to analyse the mercury and hydroquinone content in some skin toning creams and cosmetic soaps using automatic mercury analyser coupled with Cold Vapour Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (CV-AAS) and High Performance Liquid Chromatography.|$|R

30|$|In this study, sixty-two (62) <b>skin-lightening</b> <b>creams</b> and soaps were {{analysed}} for total mercury and hydroquinone levels. Total mercury {{was determined by}} the Cold Vapour Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry using an automatic mercury analyser and hydroquinone by High Performance Liquid Chromatography. The mean concentration of total mercury in skin toning creams and cosmetic soaps were 0.098  ±  0.082 and 0.152  ±  0.126  μg/g, respectively. The mean concentration of hydroquinone was 0.243  ±  0.385 and 0.035  ±  0.021  % in skin toning creams and cosmetic soaps, respectively. All the creams and soaps analysed had mercury and hydroquinone levels below the US Food and Drug Administration’s acceptable limit of 1  μg/g and 2  %, respectively. The low levels of mercury and hydroquinone in the creams and soaps analysed in this study therefore do not pose any potential risk to consumers who are mostly women in Ghana.|$|R

This irreversible disfiguring cosmetic problem assumes epidemic proportions in South African blacks. Mild ochronosis is characterized clinically by coarsening and darkening of the skin; severe ochronosis, by coalescing, caviar-like black papules and atrophy. Histology shows ochronotic collagen fibers with eventual formation of ochronotic colloid milium. A variable cellular infiltrate, which may be granulomatous, is present. We describe two patients with severe exogenous ochronosis who developed superimposed papular lesions. Histology in both cases showed transfollicular elimination of ochronotic fibers. In one patient, gross epidermal hyperplasia, a dense lichenoid infiltrate, and partial destruction of ochronotic fibers accompanied the process of elimination (cell-rich type). In the other, concomitant epidermal hyperplasia and a cellular infiltrate were absent (cell-poor type). Further studies are needed to prove or disprove the existence of such a proposed subdivision. Transepidermal elimination in exogenous ochronosis has been mentioned in a previous report, but to our knowledge this is the first detailed documentation of this phenomenon. The clinical and histopathological spectrum of exogenous ochronosis is thus expanded. Articl...|$|R
40|$|Mercury is {{considered}} one of the most toxic elements for plants and animals. Nevertheless, in the Middle East, Asia and Latin America, whitening creams containing mercury are being manufactured and purchased, despite their obvious health risks. Due to the mass distribution of these products, this can be considered a global public health issue. In Mexico, these products are widely available in pharmacies, beauty aid and health stores. They are used for their skin lightening effects. The aim of this work was to analyze the mercury content in some cosmetic whitening creams using the cold vapor technique coupled with atomic absorption spectrometry (CV-AAS). A total of 16 <b>skin-lightening</b> <b>creams</b> from the local market were investigated. No warning information was noted on the packaging. In 10 of the samples, no mercury was detected. The mercury content in six of the samples varied between 878 and 36, 000 ppm, despite the fact that the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined that the limit for mercury in creams should be less than 1 ppm. Skin creams containing mercury are still available and commonly used in Mexico and many developing countries, and their contents are poorly controlled...|$|R

40|$|The {{formally}} accepted {{meaning of}} the term ochronosis is musculoskeletal and skin manifestation of alkaptonuria. Additionally, exogenous ochronosis has been reported following long-term application of <b>skin-lightening</b> <b>creams,</b> which contain hydroquinone, phenol or resorcinol. It exclusively affects black individuals, particularly in South Africa, but with an increasing number of reports on a worldwide scale. We describe a 57 -year-old female patient with a 3 -year history of asymptomatic, dark-brown macules on the skin of the eyelids and the malar regions. Histopathological examination of HE sections revealed light to dark-brown granules presenting as free bodies, which were mainly situated in the papillary dermis. Despite the very detailed history, taken from the patient, it was impossible to identify any exogenous cause for her condition. The investigation of blood and urine samples excluded alkaptonuria. On the basis of the presented data we propose the existence of an idiopathic variant of skin ochronosis. This presents with a negative for precipitating factor patient history, monomorphic lenticular macular lesions and brown granules in the papillary dermis without close association with collagen fibres and easily stained black with methylene blue. Our results may expand the aetiopathogenesis as well as the clinical and histopathological spectrum of this irreversible disfiguring cosmetic problem.

30|$|Hydroquinone {{levels in}} the skin-lightening {{products}} ranged from below detection to 0.83  ±  0.51  % in creams imported from Cote d’Voire, 0.02  ±  0.01 to 0.51  ±  0.18  % in creams imported from Italy, below detection to 0.32  ±  0.16  % in creams imported from India. Creams originating from USA, Indonesia, Germany, Senegal, Ghana and China recorded hydroquinone levels below the detection limit. The highest concentration of hydroquinone was recorded in ZC (1.61  ±  0.72  %) imported from UK followed by CD (0.83  ±  0.51  %) imported from Cote d’Voire, Skin Solution Cream (0.51  ±  0.18  %) imported from Italy, DSC (0.40  ±  0.71  %) imported from Nigeria and CLC (0.32  ±  0.16  %) imported from India. Hydroquinone {{levels in the}} skin-lightening soaps ranged from below detection to 0.05  ±  0.03  %. Classic white soap and CTS recorded hydroquinone concentration of 0.05  ±  0.03 and 0.02  ±  0.01  %, respectively. Overall, 64  % of the creams and 75  % of soaps analysed recorded hydroquinone concentrations below detection. All the <b>skin-lightening</b> <b>creams</b> and soaps analysed recorded hydroquinone concentration below the US FDA threshold limit of 2  % (USFDA 2009). Doreen (2010) recorded levels of hydroquinone (0.001 – 3.45  %) in some skin lighteners in Ghana, which was higher than the present study. However, levels of hydroquinone (0.0002 – 0.0350  %) in body creams and lotions by Terer et al. (2013), Kenya are comparable with the present study.|$|R
40|$|In this ever-advancing global world, {{people are}} mindful to beauty and well-being. As a result, the {{market share of}} beauty {{products}} is increasing radically. Therefore, several skin-lightening products are commercially on hand to get lighter skin tone. Clinically, such creams are prescribed to treat hyper pigmentation disorders [1]. Even in the cosmetics market, numerous functional products such as those developed for skin moisturizing, skin whitening, wrinkle care and anti-ageing have been launched. The misleading advertisements and irrational use of such creams often leads to adverse consequences to human skin. For that reason, {{the aim of this}} study was to assess the depigmenting efficacy of branded <b>skin-lightening</b> <b>creams</b> in-vivo (human). Owing to this, four branded creams were used, coded as P- 1, P- 2, P- 3 and P- 4. Prior to in-vivo evaluation, physicochemical characterization and in-vitro stability studies of all the creams were performed to ensure the quality of the creams. In-vivo evaluation of the creams was carried out in 36 healthy human volunteers. The volunteers were screened for any reaction to cream using patch test (Burchard test). The creams were applied on cheeks twice a day for 8 weeks. The skin measurements for melanin, erythema, sebum content and trans epidermal water loss (TEWL) were recorded using mexameter, sebumeter and tewameter respectively. In addition, increase in skin moisture content was measured using corneometer. The measurements were taken at the end of week 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8. Lastly, panel test was conducted to assess the volunteers’ sensory evaluation of the creams. The results of physicochemical characterization and stability analyses recommended that the creams were suitable for skin application at room temperature. The pH values of all the creams were found to be at 6 ± 0. 5...|$|R
40|$|Residential {{exposure}} to vapor from current or previous cultural use of mercury could harm {{children living in}} rental (apartment) homes. That concern prompted the following agencies to conduct a study to assess pediatric mercury exposure in New York City communities by measuring urine mercury levels: New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene’s (NYCDOHMH) Bureau of Environmental Surveillance and Policy, New York State Department of Health/Center for Environmental Health (NYSDOHCEH), Wadsworth Center’s Biomonitoring Program/Trace Elements Laboratory (WC-TEL), and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A previous study indicated that people could obtain mercury for ritualistic use from botanicas located in Brooklyn, Manhattan, and the Bronx. Working closely with local community partners, we concentrated our recruiting efforts through health clinics located in potentially affected neighborhoods. We developed posters to advertise the study, conducted active outreach through local partners, and, as compensation {{for participation in the}} study, we offered a food gift certificate redeemable at a local grocer. We collected 460 urine specimens and analyzed them for total mercury. Overall, geometric mean urine total mercury was 0. 31  μg mercury/l urine. One sample was 24  μg mercury/l urine, which exceeded the (20  μg mercury/l urine) NYSDOH Heavy Metal Registry reporting threshold for urine mercury exposure. Geometric mean urine mercury levels were uniformly low and did not differ by neighborhood or with any clinical significance by children’s ethnicity. Few parents reported the presence of mercury at home, in a charm, or other item (e. g., <b>skin-lightening</b> <b>creams</b> and soaps), and we found no association between these potential sources of exposure and a child’s urinary mercury levels. All pediatric mercury levels measured in this study were well below a level considered to be of medical concern. This study found neither self-reported nor measured evidence of significant mercury use or exposure among participating children. Because some participants were aware of the possibility that they could acquire and use mercury for cultural or ritualistic purposes, community education about the health hazards of mercury should continue...|$|R

Most <b>skin-lightening</b> hydroquinone <b>creams</b> contain 4 %– 5 % hydroquinone. We have investigated the role of resveratrol in prevention of hydroquinone induced cytotoxicity in mouse primary hepatocytes. We found that 400 µM hydroquinone exposure alone induced apoptosis of the cells and also resulted in a significant drop of cell viability compared with the control, and pretreatment of resveratrol to a final concentration of 0. 5 mM 1 h before hydroquinone exposure did not show a significant improvement in the survival rate of the hepatocytes, however, relatively higher concentrations of resveratrol (≥ 1 mM) inhibited apoptosis of the mouse primary hepatocytes and increased cell viability in a dose-dependent manner, {{and in particular the}} survival rate of the hepatocytes was recovered from 28 % to near 100 % by 5 mM resveratrol. Interestingly, pretreatment with resveratrol for longer time (24 h), even in very low concentrations (50 µM, 100 µM), blocked the damage of hydroquinone to the cells. We also observed that resveratrol pretreatment suppressed hydroquinone-induced expression of cytochrome P 450 2 E 1 mRNA dose-dependently. The present study suggests that resveratrol protected the cells against hydroquinone-induced toxicity through its antioxidant function and possibly suppressive effect on the expression of cytochrome P 450 2 E 1...|$|R
