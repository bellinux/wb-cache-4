40|$|A <b>stylus</b> <b>instrument</b> was {{characterized}} and calibrated, including a dynamic calibration of the probe. This <b>stylus</b> <b>instrument</b> {{was used to}} calibrate ten roughness standards for six surface roughness parameters. The sensitivity of each parameter of each standard to such measurement conditions as stylus geometry, measurement force, cut-off wavelength, and so forth was deter-mined experimentally. These results were used for an uncertainty evalua-tion of each parameter for each roughness standard. It is shown that the manufacturers ’ specification for the <b>stylus</b> <b>instrument</b> (2 % uncertainty in roughness parameters) is approximately correct for {{the most commonly used}} samples and parameters, but the uncertainty may range from 0. 03 % (for sinusoidal profiles) to 100 % (for very fine surfaces), depending upon the standard and parameter to be calibrated. © 1998 Elsevier Science Inc...|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} simulation {{has been used}} to systematically investigate the characteristics of a stylus surface profiling instrument. The model bridges together previously used concepts to incorporate both tip size and tip dynamics. The dynamics incorporate a tip flight phenomenon, inferring detachment from zero value of the reaction force and the trajectory from a free vibration solution to a second order system. Tip shape is handled by a rigid kinematic model. Following brief discussions of the modelling and the process for generating test profiles with defined correlation lengths, the influences of the inherent parameters of the <b>stylus</b> <b>instrument</b> and the testing method on the measurement fidelity are examined. The tip shape effect of the <b>stylus</b> <b>instrument</b> is also considered in the dynamic measurement. It is noted that the finite tip size can increase the critical scanning speed to avoid tip flight, but decreases the signal fidelity of the measurement due to the bridging effect...|$|E

40|$|Abstract − In the {{uncertainty}} budget of Rockwell C hardness (HRC) tests, geometric error of the Rockwell diamond indenter {{is a major}} contributor. The geometric calibration of Rockwell diamond indenters has been a key issue for Rockwell hardness standardization. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed a microform calibration system based on a <b>stylus</b> <b>instrument</b> for the geometric calibration of Rockwell diamond indenters. Using that system, a NIST master standard Rockwell diamond indenter No. 3581 was established in 1995, by which approximately 300 standard reference material (SRM) Rockwell hardness blocks of HRC scale were calibrated for implementation of the HRC scale in the United States. This indenter has been re-calibrated in 1997, 2005 and 2007. The calibration results have shown both high stability for the NIST standard Rockwell diamond indenter and high reproducibility for the NIST microform calibration system. After more than fifteen years of service, the <b>stylus</b> <b>instrument</b> was recently replaced by a new one. In order to test the measurement agreement between the two stylus instruments, another NIST master Rockwell diamond indenter No. 101 has been recently calibrated by the new instrument and the calibration result shows good agreement with the previous results...|$|E

40|$|At the Laboratory for Precise Measurements of Length, {{currently}} the Croatian National Laboratory for Length, unique nano-roughness calibration standards were developed, {{which have been}} physically implemented {{in cooperation with the}} company MikroMasch Trading OU and the Rudee Boskovic Institute. In this paper, a new design for a calibration standard with two measuring surfaces is presented. One of the surfaces is for the reproduction of roughness parameters, while the other is for the traceability of length units below 50 nm. The nominal values of the groove depths on these measuring surfaces are the same. Thus, a link between the measuring surfaces has been ensured, which makes these standards unique. Furthermore, the calibration standards available on the market are generally designed specifically for individual groups of measuring instrumentation, such as interferometric microscopes, <b>stylus</b> <b>instruments,</b> scanning electron microscopes (SEM) or scanning probe microscopes. In this paper, a new design for nano-roughness standards has been proposed for use in the calibration of optical instruments, as well as for <b>stylus</b> <b>instruments,</b> SEM, atomic force microscopes and scanning tunneling microscopes. Therefore, the development of these new nano-roughness calibration standards greatly contributes to the reproducibility of the results of groove depth measurement as well as the 2 D and 3 D roughness parameters obtained by various measuring methods...|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} this Ph. D {{work is to}} {{evaluate}} fidelity in surface measurements in nanometric metrology for both contact and non-contact methods, namely <b>stylus</b> <b>instruments</b> and scanning tunnelling microscopy. Fidelity is defined, in this thesis, as a measure to which an instrument system reproduces the surface features and thus the parameters of interest. High fidelity measurement has two meanings; less distortion in the measured result and less disturbance to the surface being measured. Interaction at the interface between the probe and the surface {{is the source of}} failure to achieve high fidelity. No instrument measures surface topography alone: all instruments measure a convolution of topography and the geometrical and physical interaction of the measured probe and the surface. In the case of a mechanical stylus, factors extraneous to the topography include (a) the shape and size of the stylus, (b) mechanical properties of the stylus and the specimen such as elastic moduli and hardness, (c) frictional force of the sliding pair. and (d) dynamic interaction forces during the sliding. For the scanning tunnelling microscope, factors which affect measurement in addition to topography include the geometry of the tip, the electronic properties of the surface and mechanical deformation due to electrostatic forces and contamination. 'These factors have been investigated in great detail, particularly for the <b>stylus</b> <b>instruments.</b> A specially designed electro-magnetic force actuator has been developed to give a better control on loading force during the experiments. Tracking force effects were evaluated by profiling statistical parameters, and scanning electron microscopy. Friction between a stylus and specimen has been measured for different loading force, sliding speed, material and surface finish. Improvement on dynamic characteristics of a stylus system has been achieved by active damping control. An optimal damping ratio for <b>stylus</b> <b>instruments</b> is found to be within 0. 5 - 0. 7. Through the study, the tracking force and traversing speed are found to be the crucial factors to be tackled so that high fidelity measurement can be obtained. A similar investigation has been also made on two home-built scanning tunnelling microscopes to explore the potential applications of STM on nanometric metrology. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} this Ph. D. {{project was to}} design and {{construct}} an in-process, non contact surface finish sensor for high quality components generated using diamond turning. For this application the instrument must have the following properties: i rapid acquisition of data. ii capability of measuring translating and or rotating surfaces. iii ruggedness for in-process use. iv insensitivity to moderate vibrations. v remoteness from the surfaces to be measured. The remoteness requirement virtually excludes the otherwise ubiquitous <b>stylus</b> <b>instrument,</b> while the rapid gathering of data from rotating surfaces excludes other profiling techniques. The above mentioned properties strongly suggest an optical method. An optical diffraction technique has been chosen, since it produces an optical Fourier Transform of the surface. This transform is produced {{at the speed of}} light, since the optical system has the property of parallel data processing, unlike a typical electronic computer. With the aid of a microprocessor various surface finish parameters can be extracted from the optical transform. These parameters are respectively the rms surface roughness, slope and wavelength. The actual sensor consists of a measuring head and a minicomputer. It fulfils the above mentioned requirements. Its only limitations are: i limited to surface finishes up to 100 nm ii presence of cutting fluids has to be avoided, although certain modern lubricating fluids can be tolerated. The algorithms devised to extract the surface finish parameters from the optical transforms have initially been tested on optical spectra produced by Thwaite. Comparison of the optical roughness values and the values quoted by Thwaite show close agreement.
