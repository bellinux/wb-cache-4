500|$|With the {{exception}} of [...] "Method Man" [...] and GZA's [...] "Clan in da Front", every song features multiple rappers contributing verses of varying lengths. The verses are essentially battle rhymes, mixed with humor and outsized tales of urban violence and drug use. There is some debate about whether the lyrics on 36 Chambers are properly classified as gangsta rap or <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>entirely.</b> In a Stylus magazine review, writer Gavin Mueller evokes the bleakness of the Wu-Tang world view: ...|$|E
500|$|Slipknot {{received}} acclaim {{by critics}} and fans; following its release the band gained popularity beyond their own expectations. Reviewing for AllMusic, Rick Anderson awarded the album {{four out of}} five stars, calling it [...] "an auspicious debut" [...] and proclaimed, [...] "You thought Limp Bizkit was hard? They're The Osmonds. These guys are <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>entirely.</b> And it's pretty impressive." [...] The album's aggression and heavy sound was widely praised; Rolling Stone stated Slipknot is [...] "metal with a capital m", Kerrang! added [...] "raw and wholly uncompromising, each track delivered a powerful blow to the senses", and in 2001, Q magazine included the album in their list [...] "50 Heaviest Albums of All Time". CMJ ranked the album as the twelfth highest [...] "Editorial Pick" [...] for 1999. The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die by Robert Dimery.|$|E
500|$|Miller later {{noted that}} unlike other episode scenes {{such as in}} [...] "Grey Matters", Walter's {{breakdown}} at the supermarket [...] "came largely out of nowhere. It was a thought experiment that took {{on a life of}} its own." [...] Miller continued that at the time, he and Stentz thought they were writing Olivia-focused episodes, but [...] "In retrospect, we really wrote a four-part story about Walter, his relationship to children, and the struggle between Walter-who-was and Walter-who-is. If you look at it that way, his decision at the end of 'Northwest Passage' becomes the moment where he reconciles those things. He doesn't resolve them, but he comes to grips with them. Once again in retrospect, I think that's what the supermarket breakdown was really about. This happens — you think a scene is about one thing when you're in the middle of it, and realize it's <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>entirely</b> when you look back. Characters can be sneaky motherfuckers that way." ...|$|E
5000|$|... it's hard {{to think}} of any poem where the word [...] "marginalization" [...] occurs.It is being used here, but this {{may or may not be}} [...] a poem: the couplets of six word lines don't {{establish}} an audible [...] rhythm; perhaps they haven't, to use the Calvinist mercantile metaphor, [...] "earned" [...] their right to exist in their presentform--is this a line break [...] or am I simply chopping up ineradicable prose? But to defend this [...] (poem) from its own attack, I'll say that both the flush left [...] and irregular right margins constantly loom as significant events, often interrupting what [...] I thought I was about to write and making me write <b>something</b> [...] <b>else</b> <b>entirely.</b> Even though I'm going back and rewriting, the problem still [...] reappears every six words. So this, and every poem, is a marginal [...] work in a quite literal sense.|$|R

2500|$|What {{was to be}} a short caption quickly {{grew into}} <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>entirely.</b> Thompson first {{submitted}} to Sports Illustrated a manuscript of 2,500 words, which was, as he later wrote, [...] "aggressively rejected." [...] Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner was said to have liked [...] "the first 20 or so jangled pages enough to take it seriously on its own terms and tentatively scheduled it for publication— which gave me the push I needed to keep working on it", Thompson later wrote.|$|E

[...] (NOTE: Though many modern reenactors {{refer to this}} garment as a [...] "snood", {{it is not a}} period term for this article of clothing; snoods were <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>entirely.)</b> These hairnets were frequently made of very fine material to match the wearer's natural hair color, but occasionally more elaborate versions were made of thin strips of velvet or chenille (sometimes decorated with beads). Whether plain or resplendent, many hairnets were edged with ruchings of ribbon that would serve to adorn the crown of the wearer's head.|$|E

2500|$|In a book {{published}} by Encounter Books, Caroline Fourest {{claimed to have}} analysed Tariq Ramadan's 15 books, 1,500 pages of interviews, and approximately 100 recordings, and concludes [...] "Ramadan is a war leader", an [...] "islamist" [...] and the [...] "political heir of his grandfather", Hassan al-Banna, stating that his discourse is [...] "often just a repetition of the discourse that Banna had {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century in Egypt", and that he [...] "presents [...] as a model to be followed." [...] She argues that [...] "Tariq Ramadan is slippery. He says one thing to his faithful Muslim followers and <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>entirely</b> to his Western audience. His choice of words, the formulations he uses – even his tone of voice – vary, chameleon-like, according to his audience." [...] Ramadan claims that Fourest's book contains 200 errors, only three of which she has confirmed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{sources have}} {{recently}} been reexamined by the scholar Mary Valante, who has taken an economic approach. Accepting Mac Airt's translation of súaitrech not as soldiers but officials, she interprets this as Ivar and Norse Limerick's dominance of international trade within its region, sphere of influence, or [...] "periphery" [...] in Ireland. She notes that the poll tax described in the Cogad [...] "is {{very similar to that}} listed in the Book of Rights and the Book of the Uí Maine from Dublin [...] ", referring to that collected for the Kings of Dublin, and furthermore finds a possible reference to Norse Limerick's royal [...] "officials" [...] in two versions of the Book of Rights itself. However, whether this tribute from Limerick's hinterland (as with Dublin's) was extracted in [...] "a sort of protectionism racket, or as tolls on trade, or as <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>entirely</b> is unclear." [...] In any case the Norse economy in Munster, judging from silver finds, appears to have operated somewhat differently from that of the Dublin region. Trade with France, and from there southern Europe and the Mediterranean, can be assumed, but that with elsewhere in the Anglo-Celtic Isles and the wider Norse world may have been more limited by Limerick's location.|$|E
2500|$|According to his {{promoter}} Cisek, Theodorescu-Sion's organic {{treatment of}} nature emanates from [...] "the fundamental law" [...] of Romania's ancient folk arts, namely: [...] "man does not master surrounding nature; he grows from the stony and craggy soil [...] like plants, like trees, like animals." [...] This, Cisek argues, was {{the revelation of}} a true artistic expression of the Romanian soul, opposed to the idyllic canvasses of Impressionist master Nicolae Grigorescu, but akin to the Poporanist prose of Calistrat Hogaș. In 1926, he assessed: [...] "It has been said—and many among the artistically illiterate continue to repeat as much to this day—that only Grigorescu's art can ever be Romanian, and that Theodorescu-Sion's painting can {{have nothing in common}} with the substance of our soil. [...] tomorrow perhaps, [...] may find himself able to overturn skeptical impressions and theories". Cisek depicts Sion as Romania's [...] "best connoisseur of artistic techniques", with a [...] "sovereign mastery", locating him at the opposite end from post-Grigorescu official art. Sion's understanding of national specificity, he argues, had nothing in common with the [...] "mulligan" [...] traditionalism of Octav Băncilă and Kimon Loghi: [...] "if Mr. Loghi is a painter, then Teodorescu-Sion must surely be <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>entirely!</b> One should bear in mind that Mr. Teodorescu-Sion is still developing, whereas 'Master' Loghi has reached his summit. The summit of mediocrity." [...] Contrarily, Nichifor Crainic, who was a Grigorescu aficionado, posthumously described Sion as Grigorescu's one equal; however, he noted, Sion bowed to commissions, and as such never produced an actual masterpiece.|$|E

60|$|I did {{not allow}} my resolution, {{with respect to the}} Parliamentary Debates, to cool. It was one of the irons I began to heat immediately, and one of the irons I kept hot, and {{hammered}} at, with a perseverance I may honestly admire. I bought an approved scheme of the noble art and mystery of stenography (which cost me ten and sixpence); and plunged into a sea of perplexity that brought me, in a few weeks, to the confines of distraction. The changes that were rung upon dots, which in such a position meant such a thing, and in such another position <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> <b>entirely</b> different; the wonderful vagaries that were played by circles; the unaccountable consequences that resulted from marks like flies' legs; the tremendous effects of a curve in a wrong place; not only troubled my waking hours, but reappeared before me in my sleep. When I had groped my way, blindly, through these difficulties, and had mastered the alphabet, which was an Egyptian Temple in itself, there then appeared a procession of new horrors, called arbitrary characters; the most despotic characters I have ever known; who insisted, for instance, that a thing like the beginning of a cobweb, meant expectation, and that a pen-and-ink sky-rocket, stood for disadvantageous. When I had fixed these wretches in my mind, I found that they had driven everything else out of it; then, beginning again, I forgot them; while I was picking them up, I dropped the other fragments of the system; in short, it was almost heart-breaking.|$|E
