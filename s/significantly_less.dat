40|$|The {{influences}} of smoking and age on the elimination kinetics of disopyramide were studied in 27 subjects. Total elimination clearance of disopyramide was measured after an infusion to steady state. The total elimination clearance was <b>significantly</b> (P <b>less</b> than 0. 05) decreased in elderly non-smoking patients compared with young non-smoking subjects (1. 54 +/- 0. 33 vs 2. 12 +/- 0. 67 ml kg- 1 min- 1) (mean +/- s. d.). Smoking more than 20 cigarettes per day <b>significantly</b> (P <b>less</b> than 0. 05) increased total elimination clearance in elderly (2. 02 +/- 0. 35 vs 1. 54 +/- 0. 33 ml kg- 1 min- 1), while no significant induction by tobacco {{was observed in}} young healthy persons. Serum concentrations of alpha 1 -acid glycoprotein, the major binding protein of disopyramide, were <b>significantly</b> higher (P <b>less</b> than 0. 001) in the elderly patients. However, the volume of distribution (V) was <b>significantly</b> (P <b>less</b> than 0. 001) greater in the elderly patients (2. 44 +/- 0. 64 vs 1. 16 +/- 0. 15 1 kg- 1). Steady-state serum concentrations of the free drug were <b>significantly</b> (P <b>less</b> than 0. 01) lower in the young volunteers (0. 75 +/- 0. 13 micrograms ml- 1) than in the elderly (0. 90 +/- 0. 10 micrograms ml- 1).

40|$|Fecal {{bile acid}} concentration, fecal characteristics, bowel habits and {{habitual}} food intake were measured in male distance runners (n = 14) and sedentary men (n = 14).

This study has identified lower fecal bile acid concentration in distance runners, which was probably due mainly to dilution of colon contents by higher consumption of dietary fibre.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{preliminary}} {{results of a}} prospective randomized trial comparing endoscopic variceal sclerosis and distal splenorenal shunt (DSRS) {{in the management of}} patients with cirrhosis and variceal bleeding. Seventy-one patients have been entered; 36 have received sclerosis and 35 DSRS. Randomization of the study population was stratified on Child's A/B (56 %) and Child's C (44 %). Sixty-one per cent had alcoholic and 39 % non-alcoholic cirrhosis. No patients have been lost to follow-up, which currently stands at a median of 26 months. Rebleeding occurred <b>significantly</b> (p <b>less</b> than 0. 05) more frequently in patients in the sclerosis group (19 of 36 : 53 %) compared to DSRS (1 of 35 : 3 %), but only 11 of 36 (31 %) were not controlled by further sclerosis and failed that therapy. Patients in whom sclerosis failed underwent surgery. Survival was <b>significantly</b> (p <b>less</b> than 0. 01) improved in the sclerosis group (+ surgery in 31 %), with an 84 % 2 -year survival compared to a 59 % 2 -year survival in the DSRS group. Portal perfusion was <b>significantly</b> (p <b>less</b> than 0. 05) better maintained in the sclerosis (95 %) compared to the DSRS (53 %) group. Galactose elimination capacity improved <b>significantly</b> (p <b>less</b> than 0. 05) in 21 patients successfully managed by sclerosis at 1 year and was <b>significantly</b> (p <b>less</b> than 0. 01) better maintained in the sclerosis compared to DSRS group. The authors conclude that endoscopic sclerosis: has a higher rebleeding rate than DSRS, with one third of patients failing therapy from rebleeding; allows significant improvement in liver function when successful; and gives significantly improved survival in the management of variceal bleeding when backed up by surgical therapy for patients with uncontrolled rebleeding...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{exposure}} of animals to ammonia on their delayed type of dermal response, the mitogenic and antigenic responses of their lymphocytes, and the bactericidal and phagocytic activities of their alveolar macrophages were examined. Experimental guinea pigs vaccinated with Mycobacterium bovis BCG were exposed to 3. 75 micrograms of ammonia per dl of air (50 ppm) or 6. 75 micrograms of ammonia per dl of air (90 ppm), whereas control animals also vaccinated with BCG were maintained in the normal environment. The delayed type of dermal response to tuberculin injected 3 weeks later was <b>significantly</b> (P <b>less</b> than 0. 05) less in experimental animals exposed to 6. 75 micrograms of ammonia per dl than in control animals. In vitro, the response of blood lymphocytes and bronchial lymphocytes to phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A, and tuberculin stimulation was <b>significantly</b> (P <b>less</b> than 0. 01) less than the response of lymphocytes from control animals. The response of normal blood lymphocytes to phytohemagglutinin incubated in medium containing 1 or 10 mg of ammonia per dl was <b>significantly</b> (P <b>less</b> than 0. 01) reduced {{as compared with the}} response of lymphocytes incubated without ammonia.

5|$|A study {{conducted}} at the Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS), at the University of California, Davis (UC Davis) published in 2014 found that many car dealers are less than enthusiastic about plug-in vehicles. ITS conducted 43 interviews with six automakers and 20 new car dealers selling plug-in vehicles in California’s major metro markets. The study also analyzed national and state-level J.D.

The researchers found that buyers of plug-in electric vehicles were <b>significantly</b> <b>less</b> satisfied and rated the dealer purchase experience much lower than buyers of non-premium conventional cars, while Tesla Motors earned industry-high scores.

40|$|Nineteen healthy {{subjects}} were studied and 17 patients with gastric ulcer {{before and after}} ulcer healing with carbenoxolone. Gastric deoxytibonucleic acid (DNA) loss was measured as an index of epithelial cell turnover, and N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA) content of gastric juice as an index of mucus secretion. In normal subjects there was a negative correlation (p less that 0 - 025) between gastric DNA loss and NANA secretion; the lower the cell turnover the higher the NANA production. In gastric ulcer patients DNA loss or turnover was <b>significantly</b> (p <b>less</b> than 0 - 01) higher than normal, and fell <b>significantly</b> (p <b>less</b> than 0 - 01) after four weeks' treatment with carbenoxolone when 16 of the 17 ulcers had healed. At the same time NANA output increased <b>significantly</b> (p <b>less</b> than 0 - 01).

40|$|Patterns of LH and PRL {{secretion}} {{have been}} evaluated in 15 postmenopausal women {{before and after the}} chronic blockage of the D 2 dopamine receptors with veralipride (100 mg twice daily, for 30 days). In addition, the possible influence of the antidopaminergic drug on the activity of the endogenous opioid system has been evaluated by the infusion of the opioid antagonist naloxone, performed before and during veralipride administration. Mean plasma LH levels were <b>significantly</b> blunted (p <b>less</b> than 0. 05) and mean plasma PRL levels were <b>significantly</b> increased (p <b>less</b> than 0. 001) by veralipride administration.
