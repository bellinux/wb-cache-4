The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the flexural strength of heat-cured acrylic resin samples repaired with Iranian and foreign <b>self-curing</b> acrylic resins alone and impregnated with uni-directional fiberglass. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study 40 specimens with a dimension of 65 × 10 × 2. 5 mm were fabricated from Meliodent heat-cured acrylic resin. Eight specimens were left intact as the control group. The other specimens were first fractured and then 8 specimens were repaired with <b>self-curing</b> Acropars acrylic resin; 8 specimens were repaired with <b>self-curing</b> Acropars acrylic resin impregnated with fiberglass; 8 specimens were repaired with <b>self-curing</b> Meliodent acrylic resin and finally, 8 specimens were repaired with <b>self-curing</b> Meliodent acrylic resin impregnated with fiberglass. Then the flexural strengths of repaired and intact specimens were measured by DARTEC machine. The results were analyzed with one-way ANOVA, and Tukey and two-sided Dunett tests (α 0. 05).

To carry out this study the cement content of 300, 400, 500 kg/m 3, water/cement ratio of 0. 5, 0. 4, 0. 3 and 0. 0 %, 15 % silica fume of weight of cement as an additive were used in concrete mixes. The {{mechanical properties}} were evaluated while the concrete specimens were subjected to air curing regime (in the laboratory environment with 25 °C, 65 % R. H.) during the experiment. The results show that, the use of <b>self-curing</b> agents in concrete effectively improved the mechanical properties. The concrete used polyethylene-glycol as <b>self-curing</b> agent, attained higher values of mechanical properties than concrete with saturated Leca.

This research makes an attempt to investigate the performance of <b>self-curing</b> concrete with recycled coarse aggregate by evaluating its structural properties in terms of compressive strength, split tensile strength and flexure strength. The comparative results show that recycled coarse aggregate achieves up to 94. 82 % of the normal aggregate compressive strength with normal curing and 91. 73 % normal aggregate when <b>self-curing</b> agent is used. A compressive strength increase of 3 % was observed between normal curing and <b>self-curing</b> specimens with recycled coarse aggregate.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the sorption and solubility of heat-cure and <b>self-cure</b> acrylic resins in different solutions. Materials and Methods: One heat-cure acrylic resin (Trevalon) and one <b>self-cure</b> acrylic resin (Rapid Repair) were studied. Five groups of square-shaped specimens (20 mm × 20 mm × 2 mm) were prepared for each acrylic resin and then immersed in five solutions: distilled water, artificial saliva, denture cleansing solution, distilled water, and denture cleaning solution for 12 h alternatively, artificial saliva and denture cleaning solution for 12 h alternatively at 37 ± 2 °C, and tested sorption and solubility by weight gain/loss method, respectively, after 1, 6, and 11 weeks. The data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by post hoc Tukey's test. Results: Water sorption mean values varied from 17. 5 ± 0. 88 to 27. 25 ± 1. 04 μg/mm 3 for heat cure and from 12. 75 ± 0. 55 to 19. 75 ± 1. 04 μg/mm 3 for <b>self-cure</b> in the different solutions after different interval periods of 1, 6, and 11 weeks. These values were statistically significant (P 0. 05). There was no linear correlation between sorption and solubility values.

The term “universal” adhesive is not new. In fact, many early bonding agents were named or described as “universal” adhesives, such as XP Bond-Universal Total-etch Adhesive (Dentsply), One-Step-Universal Dental Adhesive (Bisco). However, there is still not a definition of dental “universal adhesive”. It is highly confusing what the term “universal” means. In 2012, the term “universal adhesive” has several definitions which may include: a)Can be used in total-etch, self-etch, and selective etch techniques; b)Can be used with light-cure, <b>self-cure,</b> and dual-cure materials (without the separate activators); c)Can be used for both direct and indirect substrates; d)Can bond to all dental substrates, such as dentin, enamel, metal, ceramic, porcelain, and zirconia. Currently (2012), only two new “universal adhesives” have been commercialized. In November 2011, 3M ESPE released a new ScotchBond Universal. ScotchBond Universal requires a separate <b>self-cure</b> activator or a special amine-free dual-cure cement when use with dual-cure or <b>self-cure</b> materials, unless used with specific cements recommended by the manufacturer, such as RelyX Ultimate. In addition, ScotchBond Universal also contains silane and MDP, enabling it to effectively bond every type of dental restorative material, such as glass ceramics, metal, composite resin, and zirconium oxide. In March 2012, Bisco scientist Dr Liang Chen and his coworkers developed a new All-Bond Universal, which can be use in total-etch, self-etch and selective etch techniques, {{can be used with}} any dual-cure, <b>self-cure</b> and light-cure materials without the need of a separate activator, can be used for both direct and indirect substrates, and can bond with any dental substrates (additional silane or ceramic primer is required when using to bond glass ceramics or cured composite materials as a separate, additional step).

In addition to infecting people, S. japonicum can infect over 40 species of wild and domestic animals which have varying impacts on human infection. It is now generally accepted that bovines, particularly water buffaloes, are the major reservoir for human infection in China as they are naturally infected with schistosomes and deposit more eggs into the environment than humans or any other animal host. This complicates control efforts and the economic burden associated with schistosomiasis morbidity and mortality has taken its toll on both human and livestock populations. Over the last 50 years, the schistosomiasis control program in China has made great strides in reducing prevalence and morbidity, and the Chinese authorities now aim to eliminate the disease nationwide in the next decade. Current Chinese control strategies place particular importance on interventions targeting bovines including: praziquantel treatment, barrier farming to prevent grazing in transmission areas, their replacement with mechanized tractors and possible bovine vaccination.

5000|$|Cavendish {{asserted}} in A True Relation of My Birth, Breeding, and Life {{that her}} bashful nature, what she described as [...] "melancholia", made her [...] "repent my going {{from home to}} see the World abroad." [...] This melancholic nature manifested itself in a reluctance {{to talk about her}} work in public spheres, but it was something she satirised and reconceptualised in her writing Cavendish both defined and administered <b>self-cures</b> for the physical manifestations of her melancholia, which included [...] "chill paleness," [...] an inability to speak, and erratic gestures.|$|R
40|$|In {{the primary}} dentition, {{anterior}} crossbite is usually {{indicative of a}} skeletal growth problem and a developing Class III malocclusion. In permanent incisors (Class I), it is a dental-type malocclusion due to abnormal axial inclination of maxillary anterior teeth which should be treated without delay. Thirteen patients with central or lateral crossbites were selected with ages ranging from 8 - 11. 5 years. Criteria for selection included: patient having normal occlusion at molar and canine areas (Class I); root of in-locked tooth must be completely developed; there must be sufficient room to move the crossbite tooth mesiodistally; parents' consent and medical fitness of the patient. In this report, composite resin type II <b>self-cure,</b> two paste system was used to construct the bite plates. The appliance {{was left in the}} patient's mouth for a maximum of two weeks and was then removed. The purpose of this report was {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} <b>self-cure</b> composite resin as a material and technique for lower inclined bite plane to correct anterior crossbites. The use of composite resin lower inclined plane not only appeared effective in treating the selected cases, but also reduced the number of patient's visits and chair time. Enamel remained normal and healthy without etching. There was also no cementation or recementation needed to fix the appliance on the lower anterior teeth...|$|R
