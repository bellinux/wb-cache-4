She showed enthusiasm for politics from an early age, an interest she later attributed to her father's own interest in reading and discussing political issues. The economic climate in Paarl during Abrahams's childhood severely limited job opportunities, and after the death of her father she dropped out of school to work as a <b>seasonal</b> <b>labourer</b> on a local fruit canning factory. There she became aware of the harsh conditions workers faced, including long working hours and low wages.|$|E
5000|$|The {{frequent}} {{periods of}} unemployment associated with {{life as a}} <b>seasonal</b> <b>labourer</b> contributed to Abrahams's increasing awareness of the poor conditions endured by the workers, and especially by women. A Food and Canning Workers Union (FCWU) was established in 1941; Abrahams was persuaded to join by Ray Alexander, who was then an active Communist and trade unionist. Though women members were granted only a limited role in the union's early days, Abrahams - among other female members - began to take on an important organizational and uniting role. Abrahams promoted the cause of non-racialism among union members, an issue of increasing controversy after a 1947 apartheid law banned racially mixed unions, threatening the FCWU's stability and unity.|$|E

This paper is a first attempt to begin a discussion of these issues by focussing on the Lomwe people who immigrated into Malwi from Mozambique after 1890. Entering the country as refugees, most Lomwe had to accept servility under Yao and Mang'an j a headmen or as tenants on estates. As their numbers grew they formed their own villages on Crown Land and became a peasantry producing cotton and tobacco as cash crops and maize for sale to Lomwe migrants employed as <b>seasonal</b> <b>labourers</b> on the estates.

40|$|This article {{concerns}} {{social relations}} in the estate villages of northern Germany between 1890 and 1923. It focuses primarily on the strategies adopted by <b>seasonal</b> <b>labourers</b> from Russian Poland in their relations with estate managements. Using police and union reports, and the letters and accounts of the migrants themselves, it argues that seasonal workers cannot simply be viewed as exploited, passive victims of this phase of agricultural modernization. This is evident, above all, {{in the practice of}} job-switching, which, although criminalized, was a widespread phenomenon both before 1914 and during the war, when the Poles were kept back as forced labour. Escaping estates to which they had been contracted, many workers outsmarted the system of registration by carrying multiple sets of identity papers. But such `contract breaking' was also greatly facilitated by the endemic shortage of labour in the countryside; there were always some owners prepared to hire illegal fugitives. Examining the post-war years, the article also argues for a more nuanced understanding of relations between foreign and local workers. While most contemporary and historical accounts concentrate on social distance and mutual hostility between Germans and Poles, evidence from a number of different villages in the Mecklenburgs indicate that amicable relations and mutual cooperation were not uncommon...|$|R

40|$|Background: Visceral {{leishmaniasis}} is {{a lethal}} parasitic disease transmitted by phlebotomine sand flies. The largest focus of VL in Ethiopia {{is located in}} the lowland region bordering Sudan, where the epidemiology is complicated by the presence of thousands of seasonal agricultural workers who live under precarious conditions. Methodology/Principal Findings: We conducted two parallel case-control studies to identify factors associated with VL risk in residents and migrants. The studies were conducted from 2009 to 2011 and included 151 resident cases and 157 migrant cases, with 2 matched controls per case. In multivariable conditional regression models, sleeping under an acacia tree at night (odds ratios (OR) 5. 2 [95 % confidence interval 1. 7 – 16. 4] for residents and 4. 7 [1. 9 – 12. 0] for migrants), indicators of poverty and lower educational status were associated with increased risk in both populations. Strong protective effects were observed for bed net use (OR 0. 24 [0. 12 – 0. 48] for net use in the rainy season among residents, OR 0. 20 [0. 10 – 0. 42] for any net use among migrants). For residents, living in a house with thatch walls conferred 5 -fold and sleeping on the ground 3 -fold increased risk. Among migrants, the risk associated with HIV status was borderline significant and sleeping near dogs was associated with 7 -fold increased risk. Conclusions/Significance: Preventive strategies should focus on ways to ensure net usage, especially among migrant workers without fixed shelters.

By the late 19th century, emigration was heaviest from Ireland's most rural southern and western counties. Cork, Kerry, Galway, Mayo, Sligo, Tipperary and Limerick alone provided nearly half of Ireland's emigrants. Some of this movement was temporary, made up of <b>seasonal</b> harvest <b>labourers</b> working in Britain and returning home for winter and spring. By the mid-1930s, Great Britain was the choice of many who had to leave Ireland. Britain's wartime economy (1939-45) and post-war boom attracted many Irish people to expanding cities and towns such as London, Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow and Luton. Prior to the 2000s financial crisis, ongoing sectarian violence and its economic aftermath was another major factor for immigration.|$|R

This money often originated from fortunes earned outside Scotland, whether the great wealth of Sir James Matheson (the second son of a Sutherland tacksman, who returned from the Far East with a spectacular fortune), the more ordinary profits from Empire of other returning Scots, or English industrialists attracted by lower land values in Scotland. Large amounts of capital were used to start industrial and commercial enterprises or build infrastructure like roads, bridges and harbours - but the return on this capital was very low by contemporary standards.

40|$|Agricultural {{production}} in the semi-arid agro-ecosystems of the Sahel centres on cereal staple crops and pastoralism with increasing crop-livestock integration. Animals mobilize soil fertility through manure production, graze crop by-products, and transfer nutrients from distant pastures to cropped areas. Yet in these systems various interacting factors, i. e. climate variability, poor soil fertility, poverty, and institutional constraints limit the capacity of agri culture {{to keep pace with}} the growing needs of an increasing human population. The major trends associated with population growth are (1) increasing area cropped at the expense of rangelands; (2) reduced availability of and access to good quality grazing resources, and (3) <b>seasonal</b> migration of <b>labourers</b> and transhumance of herds. These trends lead to co-evolution of farming systems towards increased privatisation of resource use. This study examines the implications of the development processes where farming systems co-evolve with their surroundings. It explores the impact of integrated management of livestock and crops in rural communities on both the livelihoods of differently. endowed farms, and on the-agro-ecosystem. Different scenarios explored the co-evolution of three site's situated in Western Niger with their environment. The sites differ in relative area cropped. The scenarios simulate-the different future outcomes for varying socio-economic and biophysical criteria with either current or more intensive management. Explorative bio-economic models are used to compare a range of farm, livelihood and ecological indicators, and to reveal social and ecological trade-offs. If current agro-ecosystems and their environments co-evolve towards increased privatisation of grazing resources, then soil fertility is likely to deteriorate on the lands managed by the agro-pastoral groups. Soil fertility may improve on lands managed by the livestock-scarce farmers settled in villages, at the cost of declining farm incomes. The agro-pastoral groups are likely to resort to more distant pastures for feed. The village-based, livestock-endowed farms will resort to feeding on on-farm crop residues. Intensification, though associated with relative decreases in real incomes, will enhance food security in these new systems, except for the poorer settled farmers. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Accidents in {{the field}} and on the farm require as much {{attention}} as the appalling lack of safety elsewhere in the food chain. For producers, processors and consumers worldwide, safety measures are often too little, too late and for the unorganised too far away. We all need to eat, and we all need to live. Agriculture is what makes us what we are. Why then do we treat agriculture so badly? At one end of the food chain, in the consumer s shopping basket, there are shrill yelps about food safety. They {{are only part of the}} issue and, with all due respect, a small part of the safety equation. All along the food chain, from the plough to the plate, there is scant respect for the safety of those who produce and process food. Their health and safety is vital, and not only for themselves: without a safe production process, without safe producers, there are no safe consumers. Agriculture is not a romance. Among everything else it means to us, it is a rough, tough world of injury, disability, disease and death. It is the third most hazardous sector after mining and construction. About half of the world s 250 million workplace injuries are estimated to occur in agriculture. Each year, worldwide, according to estimates from the International Labour Office (ILO), 170, 000 workers are killed in the agricultural sector. The sector employs half the world s labour force, with about 1. 3 billion workers active in agricultural production. About 10 per cent (17, 000) of these deaths take place in sub-Saharan Africa. The agricultural labour force in ACP States and other developing countries is known for its high levels of self-employment, although overall half is in some form of waged employment. Self-employed or not, no worker deliberately injures himself or herself, although many people will take highly dangerous shortcuts in their work, under pressure to produce and earn marginal incomes. But danger there is, partly rooted in a lack of safety awareness and education, partly in incomplete training and instructions, and in part in the age-old predominance of gain over sane. Danger! Farmers at work The high levels of fatalities and injuries in agriculture twice as high as most other sectors are due to its special conditions. Much agricultural work involves multiple tasks and multiple locations, most of them in the open air, exposing workers to climatic conditions. Much work is seasonal, with added urgency. Workers are in frequent or constant contact with animals and plants, and are exposed to bites, poisoning, infections, parasitic diseases, allergies and toxicity. The postures required in many agricultural tasks, coupled with ill-designed manual tools or mechanical equipment, lead to injury and disabilities. The levels of exposure to pesticides and other chemicals are renowned many small-scale farmers are unaware of the dangers of pesticides and have no practical access to either clear instructions or protective clothing. The safety position on formal, large-scale farms is often no better. The ILO reports many cases in Zimbabwe and Ethiopia where neither training nor protection is available to most workers, at least not to casual or temporary workers. Away from the field, the lack of safety is equally alarming. Small, ill-lit, ill-ventilated workplaces with poorly-protected equipment are often the icons of agro-processing plants, at least in the informal sector. The risks for the safety of workers, and the hygiene of the end-product, are serious. Read the rule-book As production intensifies, the techniques for crop cultivation and livestock rearing, food processing and distribution become more complex. The introduction of more machinery and numerous chemical compounds, from fertilisers to cleaning agents, each bring potentially harmful human and environmental effects in their wake. And yet the sector, and those agencies and legislative bodies which provide its enabling environment, are failing to accompany these changes with appropriate information, training and, to be blunt, safety legislation. There are already about twenty conventions on occupational safety and health (OSH) which have been adopted by the governments, employers and workers organisations which comprise the ILO. Countries such as Sweden and Finland have ratified 85 % or more; most ACP States between four and none. Even where laws can be realistically applied, agriculture is often omitted from OSH legislation of many countries. In Kenya and Brazil, for example, labour laws apply to agriculture as well as to other industries but the laws of Ghana, Sierra Leone, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo exclude agricultural workers completely or partially. The legislation of yet other countries has a wider scope: in Fiji, Namibia and South Africa, employers are required to safeguard the safety and health of people other than employees who might be affected by the work of the enterprise. It is the casual labourer and self-employed farmer who are least likely to be protected. In Ethiopia it is estimated that 80 per cent of national economic activity falls outside the Labour Code, consisting of small-scale and subsistence farming. Women often fall into these categories, working on self-employed smallholdings and as <b>seasonal</b> <b>labourers.</b> In all, more than 700 million agricultural workers worldwide, and more than 130 million in ACP countries, fall outside the theoretical or real protection of OSH legislation. Where there is no enforcer The well-known saying Safety begins at home applies in agriculture as much as in any other sector. The unacceptable numbers of occupational fatalities and injuries in agriculture could clearly be substantially reduced by a more general safety -mindedness among workers. This is a question of on-the-job training, to be sure, but also of general education. One by one, the measures are easy enough to list. How about encouraging blacksmiths to add covers to chopping machines, or involving women in designing lighter hand tools which cause less muscle strain? It is at the grassroots level that safety will take hold, but it is at other levels that it will be made possible. At a seminar on Safety and Health organised in Bamako, Mali, by the ILO, the International Union of Food workers (IUF) and the CTA in December 2000, participants called for action across the political and legislative stage, as well as by civil society and development bodies (more about this in Spore 92). Safety in agriculture is, though, virgin territory in terms of development policies; it has, quite simply, been neglected by many bodies of national and global governance for decades. That could be about to change, with a Safety and Health in Agriculture Convention being presented for adoption to the general conference of the ILO in June 2001. It is ambitious, it is overdue and, praised be its designers, it is inclusive. It insists that the specific needs of self-employed farmers, women, seasonal workers and young workers be addressed, and that they enjoy protection equivalent to that provided to other workers in agriculture. It does not, however, cover subsistence farming, forestry or agro-processing, the latter being covered in principle by industrial conventions. For those accustomed to working in the formal sector, whether government inspectors or trade union organisers, this convention will challenge attitudes and ways of work. The task of getting it adopted is in itself a massive challenge, as the participants to the Bamako seminar affirmed. The harder, and even more necessary, task is to find ways and means to implement it. We all need to eat, and we all need to be safe. [summary points] Among measures needed to promote occupational safety and health in agriculture: - school curriculum development and media campaigns on safety awareness - re-training of extension workers, agricultural engineers, government inspectorates and trade unions - incentives (credit, awards, prizes) for safe tools and equipment - promotion of safe use, storage and disposal of chemicals at all stages of agricultural production - strengthening enforcement capacity of national safety bodies - inclusion of national safety bodies in agricultural policy formulation and implementation - overall legislative framework, adoption of ILO Convention See 'Links' for access to Safety and Health informationAccidents {{in the field}} and on the farm require as much attention as the appalling lack of safety elsewhere in the food chain.
