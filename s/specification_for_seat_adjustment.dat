40|$|Problem statement: The {{purposes}} of this study are twofold: First, to recommend a range of angles for driving posture comfort from measurement of participants and second, to investigate the relationships between drivers' anthropometric characteristics, comfortable postural angles and <b>seat</b> <b>adjustment.</b> Approach: Forty five participants were involved in the study. Both anthropometric data and postural angles were measured and recorded by using the photographic technique and analyzed further using software. During the study, each participant was required to sit on the driver's seat in his or her preferred comfortable driving postures. Images of the participant's driving posture were taken after 5 min he or she has been in the driving position to allow him/her to adapt with the seat environment and fabrics. The <b>seat</b> <b>adjustment</b> data were measured manually after the <b>seat</b> is adjusted <b>for</b> comfort by the participant. Prior to that, 10 anthropometric data of each participant was measured and recorded. Data on comfortable driving postural angles, anthropometry and <b>seat</b> <b>adjustment</b> were analyzed statistically with Pearson correlation using the SPSS software. Results: From the study, a range of angles are proposed based on the participant's perception on comfort. The ranges of comfortable angles for Malaysian citizen proposed shows significant different between Caucasian and Korean populations. The relationships between the comfortable postural angles, anthropometric data and <b>seat</b> <b>adjustment</b> were analyzed and discussed with several outcome shows that taller participants preferred a driving posture with their arms outstretched in order to achieve comfort, participants with bigger body dimension have a tendency to sit farther back from the steering wheels and smaller participants prefer to sit closer to the steering wheels with a slightly greater trunk thigh angle. Conclusion: The result obtained and discussed in this study can be applied in the driver's car seat design and construction to ensure comfort and safety...|$|R

40|$|A {{wheelchair}} user makes {{direct contact}} with the wheelchair seat, which serves as the interface between the user and the wheelchair, for much of any given day. <b>Seat</b> <b>adjustment</b> design is of crucial importance in providing proper seating posture and comfort. This paper presents a multiple-DOF (degrees of freedom) <b>seat</b> <b>adjustment</b> mechanism, which is intended to increase the independence of the wheelchair user while maintaining a concise structure, light weight, and intuitive control interface. This four-axis Stewart platform is capable of heaving, pitching, and swaying to provide seat elevation, tilt-in-space, and sideways movement functions. The geometry and types of joints of this mechanism are carefully arranged so that only one actuator needs to be controlled, enabling the wheelchair user to adjust the seat by simply pressing a button. The seat is also equipped with soft pressure-sensing pads to provide pressure management by adjusting the seat mechanism once continuous and concentrated pressure is detected. Finally, by comparing with the manual wheelchair, the proposed mechanism demonstrated the easier and more convenient operation with less effort for transfer assistance...|$|R
40|$|This work's general {{topic is}} {{advanced}} driver assistance systems. In particular, it's about the assisted driver <b>seat</b> <b>adjustment</b> in dependence on anthropometric data, {{the detection of}} Out-of-Position postures and the driver drowsiness detection. Already existing systems use sensors like in- and off-cabin cameras to detect drowsiness or require the manual input of anthropometric data to adjust the driver's seat. Contrary to these system's approaches, {{the aim of this}} work is to build a system which captures drowsiness symptoms, tracks the head position and captures anthropometric data only by the use of invisible seat integrated capacitive proximity sensors. Still, the aim includes the evaluation of the system's concepts to give direction for further examinations. The idea is the integration of several capacitive proximity sensors at meaningful positions into a driver's seat. Owing {{to the fact that the}}se sensors can sense through non-conductive materials, the sensors can be installed invisible under the seat cover. Furthermore, the sensors measure changes in the electric field. Occupants, which are in range of the sensors, change the electric field. Therefore, the sensor values shall give information about the occupant's anthropometry and position. With these anthropometric data, an assisted <b>seat</b> <b>adjustment</b> shall be possible. Especially the movement of the driver's head could give information about the driver's drowsiness. A first question of this report addresses the driver's anthropometry. What's a proper <b>seat</b> <b>adjustment?</b> Furthermore, what are the symptoms for drowsiness and which could be measured with capacitive proximity sensors? Moreover, what is an Out-of-Position posture? With information about the anthropometrical requirements, the work shows which concepts can meet the demands on the system. Owing to the fact that the system needs evaluation, how shall a prototype be developed with reference to the concepts? Due to the results of the evaluation, the concepts can satisfy the demands on the system. The ideas which rely on machine learning classifiers result in reliable data. Nevertheless, the different approaches show different demands on the collected data's diversity, which is used to train the algorithms. Besides the machine learning classifiers, many functions of the assisted <b>seat</b> <b>adjustment</b> depend on generic relations between the prototype's sensor system and the occupant's anthropometry. These functions show positive results. Nevertheless, a multiclass SVM approach with discrete adjustment classification could lead to better results, because this approach can include more sensors. Therefore, further obedience between the sensors' data and the anthropometry could be included. Several functions of advanced driver assistance systems are integrated into the capacitive proximity sensing supported advanced driver assistance system. The evaluation shows that invisibly seat integrated capacitive proximity sensors can sense several symptoms of driver drowsiness. Furthermore, the system can assist the driver's <b>seat</b> <b>adjustment</b> and detect "Out-of-Position" postures. The detection concepts are constrained by several requirements for a proper working system. Consequently, the next step is a further integration of the system into a real car. Supplementary, the evaluation shows that the machine learning concepts require a plenty of miscellaneous data. Hence, a further data collection will improve the systems creditableness. Besides the further data collection and real system integration, the developed prototype can be the basis for a further function development, like the gesture recognition for the control of a multimedia system...|$|R

In the highly competitive marketplace for personal transportation, the desire to improve the customerâ€™s experience has driven extensive research in both the physical and cognitive interaction between the vehicle and its occupants. Human models provide vehicle designers with tools to view and analyze product interactions before the first prototypes are built, potentially improving the design while reducing cost and development time. The focus of DHM research and applications began with prediction and representation of static postures for purposes of driver workstation layout, including assessments of <b>seat</b> <b>adjustment</b> ranges and exterior vision. Now DHMs are used <b>for</b> <b>seat</b> design and assessment of driver reach and ingress/egress. DHMs and related simulation tools are expanding into the cognitive domain, with computational models of perception and motion, and into the dynamic domain with models of physical responses to ride and vibration. Moreover, DHMs are now widely used to analyze the ergonomics of vehicle assembly tasks. In this case, the analysis aims to determine whether workers can be expected to complete the tasks safely and with good quality.
