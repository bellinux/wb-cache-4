There are several conventions for the <b>solar</b> <b>azimuth,</b> however it is traditionally defined as the angle between a line due south and the shadow cast by a vertical rod on Earth. This convention states the angle is positive if the line is east of south and negative if it is west of south. For example, due east would be 90° and due west would be -90°. Another convention is the reverse; {{it also has the}} origin at due south, but measures angles clockwise, so that due east is now negative and west now positive.|$|E

40|$|Pronounced {{effects on}} the {{reflective}} response of a crop canopy due to changes in <b>solar</b> <b>azimuth</b> and row azimuth angle have been noted on soybeans planted in wide rows. Understanding the interaction between row azimuth and illumination direction on the crop canopy spectral response is {{necessary in order to}} utilize effectively the spectral data collected on row crops. The objective of this experiment was {{to determine the effects of}} rows and row direction on the reflective response of a soybean canopy as a function of <b>solar</b> <b>azimuth</b> and zenith angles. Data were acquired over eleven plots in 1979. One plot was planted in east-west and north-south rows 25 cm wide to obtain, at later growth stages, a canopy with negligible row effects. A bare soil plot was included in order to monitor the sunlit soil background reflectance of the soybean plots. The remaining nine plots were planted in soybeans with 76 cm wide rows with the following azimuthal directions: 90 - 270, 105 - 285, 120 - 300, 135 - 315, 150 - 330, 165 - 345, 180 - 360, 210 - 030, and 240 - 060 degrees. The row directions were selected to favor the data collections during the morning hours when cloud free conditions are more likely. Reflectance data were acquired with a Landsat band radiometer (Exotech 100) at 15 minute intervals throughout the day on three days, representing three canopy growth stages with 65, 75 and 95 percent soil cover for those plots with 76 cm wide rows. Analysis of the data has shown minor effects on reflectance due to solar zenith angle. (Significant effects may be observed at lower latitudes whose wider diurnal variations of solar zenith angle are observed.) The two visible bands (0. 5 - 0. 6 µm) and (0. 6 - 0. 7 µm) were significantly affected by the interaction of solar and row azimuth angles.

40|$|In the {{performance}} {{analysis of a}} trough compound parabolic concentrator (CPC), the concept of south projection angle is often used for the nonmeridional sunlight to compare with the acceptance angle of CPC to determine if solar radiation could be collected. The <b>solar</b> altitude and <b>azimuth</b> {{are the only two}} factors used to calculate the south projection angle. However, for the solid CPC made of dielectric material, due to the refraction on the air–dielectric interface, the optical path of refracted light within a dielectric CPC would also depend on the refractive index of dielectric material and the tilt angle of CPC. The conventional south projection angle would not be suitable for performance analysis of a solid dielectric CPC. This paper therefore introduces a concept of inner south projection angle which is based on the refracted light and derives a formula using vector analysis. The formula relates the inner south project angle with the <b>solar</b> altitude and <b>azimuth,</b> the refractive index, and the CPC tilt angle as well. Photopia software is meanwhile employed to predict the optical performance of dielectric CPC. The simulation results confirm that use of the inner south projection angle can determine if solar radiation could be collected or transmitted through a dielectric CPC rather than conventional south projection angle. Discussions are given about the correlation between the inner south projection angle and the optical efficiency and transmittance of a trough dielectric CPC. This provides a convenient way to evaluate {{the performance}} of a dielectric CPC over a period such as a whole year...|$|R

Corn was planted on a Typic Argiaquoll on 14 May and 24 June 1982 and thinned to densities of 50 and 100 thousand plants/ha. APAR was computed from clear sky measurements of incident PAR, PAR transmitted through and to the floor of the canopy (TPAR), and PAR reflected from the soil and canopy. APAR was proportioned by the amount of incident PAR. Intercepted PAR was calculated as 1. 0 minus the proportion of incident PAR that was TPAR.

These methods use a series of graphs for estimating the solar shadow. To many architects, these methods are not easy to apprehend and are time-consuming for implementation. Furthermore, many projection lines will have to be drawn on the drawing paper, causing likely confusion and difficulty in identifying each line. Also, separate sheets of pre-drawn graphs have to be produced for different latitudes. There are now software developed for architects and students [5] to help them design for fenestration and obtain solar shading masks, and for obtaining solar shadows for buildings. In the learning process of a person, however, physical tools do maintain their contribution, and complement learning with the computer software. In pursuing this complementing contribution of the physical tools, a physical universal-solar-chart shadowplotter has been invented. This tool performs as a universal solar chart [6] for relating the latitude, day, apparent solar time, <b>solar</b> <b>azimuth</b> angle, and solar altitude angle, for any latitude selected.
