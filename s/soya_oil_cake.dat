40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest for the organic residues from various sectors of agriculture and industries {{over the past few}} decades. Their application in the field of fermentation technology has resulted in the production of bulk chemicals and value-added products such as amino acid, enzymes, mushroom, organic acids, single-cell protein, biologically active secondary metabolites, etc. (Ramachandran et al., Bioresource Technology 98 : 2000 – 2009, 2007). In this work, the production of extracellular xylanase by the fungus Penicillium canescens was investigated in solid-state fermentation using five agro-industrial substrates (<b>soya</b> <b>oil</b> <b>cake,</b> soya meal, wheat bran, whole wheat bran, and pulp beet). The best substrate was the <b>soya</b> <b>oil</b> <b>cake.</b> In order to optimize the production, the most effective cultivation conditions were investigated in Erlenmeyer flasks and in plastic bags with 5 and 100 g of <b>soya</b> <b>oil</b> <b>cake,</b> respectively. The initial moisture content, initial pH, and temperature of the culture affected the xylanase synthesis. The optimal fermentation medium was composed by <b>soya</b> <b>oil</b> <b>cake</b> crushed to 5 mm supplemented with 3 % and 4 % (w/w) of casein peptone and Na 2 HPO 4. 2 H 2 O. After 7 days of incubation at 30 °C and under 80 % of initial moisture, a xylanase production level of 18, 895 ± 778 U/g (Erlenmeyer flasks) and 9, 300 ± 589 U/g (plastic bags) was reached. The partially purified enzyme recovered by ammonium sulfate fractionation was completely stable at freezing and refrigeration temperatures up to 6 months and reasonably stable at room temperature for more than 3 months.

40|$|Among hemicellulases, xylanases are {{catalysts}} {{of considerable}} interest so as fundamental than applied point of view. However, it is paradoxical {{to note that}} the high cost of their production limits their use on a large scale. The use of purified xylan as culture substrate increases the production cost of the enzyme. Consequently, for commercial applications, it is advisable to develop processes starting from inexpensive substrates. The {{purpose of this study is}} to optimise xylanases production in solid-state fermentation based on agricultural residues. The strain is Penicillium canescens 10 - 10 c, selected in our laboratory for his ability to produce xylanase activity free of cellulase. Assays concern optimization of different culture parameters in order to develop in the future a solid-state fermentation reactor with <b>soya</b> <b>oil</b> <b>cake.</b> These parameters are: medium composition, temperature incubation, induction and repression mechanisms. <b>Soya</b> <b>oil</b> <b>cake</b> in pellets (size> 10 mm) gave a higher enzymatic activity. Great volume of culture medium reduced the enzymatic production. The presence of lactose, saccharose or starch of corn has a positive effect on the production of xylanase while the presence of xylose, mannose, galactose, arabinose, cellobiose and pectin or methylcellulose reduces the production of xylanase. The sources of phosphorus (di-potassic and di-sodic) enhance xylanase production. The enzymatic production obtained in Erlenmeyer flasks (250 ml) after 7 days incubation at 30 °C is about 14 000 U. g- 1 of carbon source. The nature of inoculum affects the enzymatic productivity. Indeed, better productivity was obtained with inoculation by solid preculture (956 U. g- 1 per day) than liquid preculture (473 U. g- 1 per day) and spores suspension (383 U. g- 1 per day). These observed enzymatic activity levels are higher than those related in the literature, whic...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MPhil (Animal Sciences)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2004. African Grey Parrots are {{now being}} bred on a {{commercial}} scale in South Africa, mainly for the export market. In order to produce the best breeding results {{it is necessary to}} formulate balanced diets but no research has been done on the feeding value for African Grey parrots of ingredients used in formulating diets. Once the apparent metabolisable energy (AME) of extruded maize for African Greys has been established {{it will be possible to}} calculate the AME of other ingredients such as full fat soya, <b>soya</b> <b>oil</b> <b>cake</b> or sunflower oil cake. By feeding an extruded mix containing a known amount of maize mixed with a known amount of <b>soya</b> <b>oil</b> <b>cake</b> and establishing experimentally the AME of the mix, the AME of <b>soya</b> <b>oil</b> <b>cake</b> for African Greys can be calculated by difference. This information will make it possible to decide whether AME results obtained for poultry can be used in formulating diets for African Grey parrots. The study consisted of two parts where the determination of the apparent metabolisable energy (AME) of extruded maize and the practical application thereof in formulating parrot diets, and the economic viability of a commercial African Grey parrot breeding operation was investigated. A reference procedure adopted by several European laboratories for the in vivo determination of metabolisable energy (ME) was used to determine the apparent metabolisable energy (AME) of extruded whole maize for African Grey parrots. The long term goal is to make a well balanced, extruded diet for these birds. Extruded maize is the form in which maize is generally included in commercial parrot diets and was therefore chosen as the experimental feed. Maize can be conveniently extruded with other single ingredients such as full fat soyabean meal, soyabean oil cake meal or sunflower oil cake meal to determine, by difference, the AME of those ingredients. For the first part of the study, ten, 3 -year-old African Grey parrots were individually housed and fed in cages designed to facilitate collection of the faeces. Cage design varied between a tall type (n= 6) and a low type (n= 4). The parrots were acclimatized to their new environment before the trial commenced to ensure normal feeding behaviour. The average AME value established for the ten African Grey Parrots was 16. 8 MJ/kg. In the trial it became apparent that it is very difficult to get consistent results with the cages used and a modified cage design is proposed for the future. The second part of the study investigated the economic viability of breeding African Grey parrots commercially, with extruded maize as part of their diet. It was generally concluded that the breeding of African Grey parrots for the pet market can be considered as an economical venture...|$|E

40|$|The {{available}} {{literature on}} abalone nutrition was synthesised {{and the prospects}} for developing a complete pelleted dry feed for Haliotis midae evaluated. The similar body compositions, digestive structures, enzyme activity, acceptance {{of a wide variety}} of feed ingredients and comparable growth performance on formulated diets of various abalone species suggests that they have similar nutritional requirements. Abalone also appear to be similar to other farmed monogastric animals in that digestion is primarily extracelluar and they possess a large, muscular crop and stomach. Abalone energy metabolism is carbohydrate based. They are capable of digesting high levels of dietary protein but their ability to utilise fat is limited. Abalone have been shown to consume predictable amounts of dry feed which is efficiently converted into body weight. Efficiency indices of utilisation of formulated feeds, such as feed conversion ratio, protein efficiency ratio, net protein utilisation and apparent digestibility have been successfully applied to abalone. It was concluded that the prospects for developing complete diets for H. midae using a conventional animal feed science model were good. The ability of H. midae to utilise a range of proteins which had potential for inclusion in practical diets was investigated. Five protein rich ingredients, namely, casein, fishmeal, <b>soya</b> <b>oil</b> <b>cake,</b> Spirulina, and torula yeast, were fed to H. midae in semi-purified diets. Two algal diets, fresh Plocamium corallorhiza and dried Ecklonia maxima were fed as controls. Abalone fed on fishmeal and Spirulina based diets displayed significantly higher growth rates than diets containing <b>soya</b> <b>oil</b> <b>cake,</b> torula yeast, casein and E. maxima. Growth rates of abalone fed with P. corallorhiza were significantly lower than all other diets. All artificial diets yield lower feed conversion ratios (0. 7 - 1. 8) and higher protein efficiency ratios (3. 3 - 6. 5) ratios than the seaweed control diets (FCR = 2. 8 - 3. 4; PER = 2. 2 - 3. 0). The results indicated that fishmeal and Spirulina were the most suitable proteins for inclusion in practical diets for H. midae. The effect of protein level on growth rate and nutritional indices was evaluated by feeding starch bound, fishmeal based diets containing 27, 32, 37, 42 and 47 % protein to juvenile H. midae. Weight gain was positively related to the level of dietary protein, increasing by 18 % between 27 % and 47 % protein. Protein efficiency ratio declining from 3. 2 to 2. 3 with an increasing dietary protein content. Feed consumption rate was approximately 1 % of body weight per day for all diets. Post-weaning abalone (ca. lOmm shell length, 0. 2 g) differed from larger juveniles (ca. 35 mm, 8 g) in their response to varying proportions of dietary protein and energy. The smaller animals appeared to have a lower protein requirement and poorer ability to utilise lipid than the larger juveniles. Proximate analyses revealed that the levels of protein, lipid and carbohydrate in abalone soft tissue increased with increasing dietary levels of these nutrients. Larger juveniles contained significantly higher levels of protein and carbohydrate, but lower levels of lipid, ash and moisture, than the smaller post-weaning abalone. The assimilation efficiency of [U-¹⁴C]-arginine by H. midae fed diets enriched with [U-¹⁴C]-arginine was only 0. 45 %. Furthennore, supplementation of diets with graded levels of crystalline arginine did not have any effect on growth rates. It was concluded that the prospects for defining the quantitative amino acid requirements of H. midae using crystalline amino acids are not promising. Rates of gastric evacuation and enzyme secretion were monitored in juvenile H. midae fed an extruded, fishmeal based dry feed. Gut fullness peaked 6 h after feed was offered and the bulk of feed consumed was digested within 24 h. Enzyme secretion appeared to begin with the onset of feeding and continued for at least 6 h after peak gut fullness was attained. Protease activity increased significantly following ingestion but amylase activity was maintained at a more or less constant level. A low level of lipase activity was observed suggesting that the ability of H. midae to digest fat is limited. The growth rate of H. midae fed an extruded, fishmeal based feed increased with increasing temperature between 12 °C and 20 °C. Between 20 °C and 24 °C a marked decline in growth rate accompanied by a deterioration in feed conversion and increased mortality was observed. Consumption of a dry pelleted feed was shown to be a function of body size and temperature. Based on these data a model which predicts a daily ration for H. midae was developed. The present study showed that H. midae efficiently utilises extruded dry feeds containing conventional feed ingredients. Although technical difficulties were encountered in measuring apparent digestibility, it was concluded that the prospects for developing practical diets according to established nutritional principles are promising...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the nutrition of a popular ornamental fish, the swordtail (Xiphophorus helleri), under intensive aquaculture conditions. The study focused on the formulation and manufacture of artificial dry diets, as well as the influence of livefeed supplementation on growth and nutritional indices of both juvenile and broodstock fish. A combination of 65 % fishmeal and 35 % <b>soya</b> <b>oil</b> <b>cake</b> meal was found to closely approximate the essential amino acid profile of X helleri (r² = 94, 3 %) and lysine was identified as the first limiting amino acid. The influence of dietary protein and energy on the growth of X helleri was investigated by means of a growth trial comparing a range of nine test diets combining 3 crude protein (45, 38 and 30 %) and 3 digestible energy (16, 5, 14, 5 and 12, 5 kJ/gram) levels. A high crude protein content (45 % dry matter) and a protein to energy ratio of ≥ 27 mg protein per kJ digestible energy was shown to promote optimal growth rate and feed conversion ratio in juvenile X helleri. The final body protein and lipid content of the fish were significantly correlated with the dietary protein to energy ratio. The nutritional value of identical dietary formulations prepared by drum-drying or cold extrusion techniques and presented either as flake or crumble particles was evaluated in a growth trial and through analysis of vitamin C levels in the diets. Up to 27 % of vitamin C activity was destroyed during the drum-drying of flake diets, while 80 % of the remaining vitamin C was lost through leaching within 10 minutes of immersion in water. A crumble-type diet was shown to be acceptable to X helleri, and yielded significantly better growth rate and feed conversion than the equivalent flake feed. Almost 19 % of fish fed the flake diets developed vitamin C deficiency symptoms including scoliosis and lordosis, while this was completely prevented by feeding crumbles, indicating a significant restriction of leaching losses from this type of particle. The use of livefeed (Daphnia spp.) as a daily supplement to dry feeds was shown to result in a significant improvement in growth rate and survival of juvenile swordtail fish. Furthermore, the synergistic action of nutrients contained in the livefeed resulted in an improvement in the feed conversion efficiency of the artificial formulation. While mortalities of 13, 4 % and 15 % were recorded in fish fed exclusively on flake feed or Daphnia, no mortality occurred in the group fed the supplemented diet. Furthermore, the incidence of vitamin C deficiency symptoms was prevented by daily supplementation with Daphnia. Fish fed exclusively on Daphnia exhibited significantly more intense pigmentation due to carotenoids contained in the livefeed. In broodstock fish maintained primarily on flake diets, growth rate, feed conversion ratio as well as reproductive performance, as measured by fecundity, were significantly improved by daily livefeed supplementation. Weekly supplementation showed no measurable advantage over flake feed only. A direct correlation was demonstrated between fecundity and size of female fish with a mean fecundity of 190 embryos per female in those fed a daily Daphnia supplement. This was significantly higher than the yield from the non-supplemented or weekly supplemented treatments (133 and 140 embryos per female respectively). Despite these differences, the number of young harvested during the experiment did not differ between treatments and this discrepancy was ascribed to parental cannibalism of newborn juveniles. This phenomenon constitutes a major potential bottleneck in production with estimates of up to seventy percent of young lost in some exp experimental tanks. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that established aquaculture nutrition principles and techniques are applicable to the tropical ornamental fish species, X helleri. It was demonstrated that by using balanced crumble feed formulations, and regular livefeed supplementation, production yields under intensive conditions may be significantly improved. Suggestions for future work on poeciliid production in South Africa include investigation of the economic implications of the recommendations stemming from this project, and further research into effective restriction of parental cannibalism of newborn fish. ...|$|E

The diets were formulated to be isonitrogenous. A total of 40 weaners (20 heifers and 20 steers) at an average weight of 192. 3 ± 20 kg were used. The experiment was a randomized block design with ten replicates per treatment and was conducted over 98 days. The group mass of the steers (700 ± 7. 80 kg) was significantly heavier when compared with the heifers (6480 ± 7. 80 kg). The average daily gain (ADG) (1. 5 ± 2. 72) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) (5. 5 ± 0. 051) of the steers was significantly better than the heifers (1. 35 ± 2. 72 and 5. 7 ± 0. 051, respectively) while the steers consume more feed (8. 2 ± 14. 4 kg) per day as compared to the 7. 4 ± 14. 4 kg consumed by heifers.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare roasting and deep frying method cooking plantain. The fat soluble vitamins constituent of unripe plantain was determined fried with three different <b>oils</b> (canola <b>oil,</b> <b>soya</b> <b>oil</b> and vegetable oil). The vitamins content were determined using High Performance Liquid Chromatography. Roasted plantain samples gave a higher value of vitamins A (0. 08 ± 0. 01 mg/g), D (0. 02 ± 0. 01 mg/g), E (0. 01 ± 0. 00 mg/g) and K (0. 05 ± 0. 00 mg/g) compared to plantain samples fried with canola oil which gave low level of vitamin D (0. 03 ± 0. 00 mg/g), E (0. 25 ± 0. 00 mg/g) and K (0. 03 ± 0. 00 mg/g). However, canola oil gave a very high level of vitamin A (0. 72 ± 0. 02 mg/g). The result showed that roasting plantain in oven retains the vitamin contents compared to deep fat frying. Canola oil is recommended for frying although <b>soya</b> <b>oil</b> can also be used.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the long-term effects of}} total and partial replacement of dietary fish meal (FM) by a mixture of agricultural products on sperm quality of African catfish Clarias gariepinus. Four isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets were formulated containing graded levels of either 50 % FM and maize meal (diet 1); 25 % FM mixed with crude sunflower <b>oil</b> <b>cake</b> (SFOC) and bean meal (BM) (diet 2); 12. 5 % FM mixed with sunflower <b>oil</b> <b>cake,</b> BM and ground nut <b>oil</b> <b>cake</b> (GOC) (diet 3) and 0 % FM mixed with de-hulled sunflower <b>oil</b> <b>cake</b> (SFOCD), BM and ground nut <b>oil</b> <b>cake</b> (diet 4). Gonadosomatic index (GSI), sperm quality, plasma sex steroids (11 -keto testosterone [11 -KT]; testosterone [T]; estradiol- 17 beta [E 2]) were evaluated on 10 to 24 fish fed on each diet. Sperm quality was assessed using computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA). Total replacement of fish meal by plant products markedly increased sperm volume, spermatocrit, spermatozoa integrity, and sperm motility. Fish fed diet 3 (12. 5 % fish meal) provided intermediate results on sperm quality whereas the lowest values were obtained in fish fed diets 1 and 2. In fish fed 0 % fish meal (diet 4), androgen levels were higher and estrogen levels were lower than in fish fed fish meal diets. Based on dietary lipid and fatty acid analyses, these results suggest a positive impact of short chain n- 6 fatty acids on androgen synthesis and sperm quality. In conclusion, a combination of ground nut <b>oil</b> <b>cake,</b> bean meal and sunflower <b>oil</b> <b>cake</b> (preferably when the sunflower is dehulled) in African catfish diet improves the sperm quality...|$|R
40|$|Large {{amounts of}} excess plant biomass are {{produced}} by agroindustries. Biotechnological innovations, mainly in the fermentation technology, have opened new areas for utilization of <b>oil</b> <b>cakes</b> as raw materials {{for the production of}} value added products. <b>Oil</b> <b>cakes</b> have been used as substrates in solid-state fermentation (SSF) for the enzymes production by filamentous fungi. This work deals with the optimisation of fermentation conditions which maximise the production of lipase from Aspergillus ibericus MUM 03. 49 under SSF using different <b>oil</b> <b>cakes</b> from Brazil. Combinations of <b>oil</b> <b>cakes,</b> moisture content (MC) and nitrogen sources were studied. Finally, the obtained lipase was applied in esterification reactions with different carboxylic acids and alcohols. SSFs were performed in 250 mL containing 15 g of <b>oil</b> <b>cake.</b> After lipase extraction, lipase activity was determined by spectrophotometric method, using p-nitrophenyl butyrate as substrate. Esterification reactions were performed in 15 mL falcon tubes with 5 mL volume reaction. Conversion yield was determined by the titration of the residual acid content, using 0. 1 M sodium hydroxide. Lipase production was significantly influenced by the <b>oil</b> <b>cake</b> used. Palm kernel <b>oil</b> <b>cake</b> (PKOC) presented higher lipase production (127 ± 17 U/g), following by sesame <b>oil</b> <b>cake</b> (SOC) (78 ± 2 U/g), after 7 days of SSF. The combination of <b>oil</b> <b>cakes</b> PKOC+SOC led to maximum lipase production of 328 ± 6 U/g. Also, on PKOC+CrOC (crambe <b>oil</b> <b>cake)</b> it was possible to obtain high lipase activity (272 ± 23 U/g). A central composite design was performed to set optimum MC and ratio of PKOC+SOC. A MC of 57 % and a ratio of 0. 45 : 0. 55 PKOC:SOC were determined predicting a lipase production of 360 U/g. NH 4 Cl was found to be the best nitrogen source at concentration of 1 % (w/w). From the profile of lipase production over fermentation time, it was observed a continuous enzyme activity increase till the 6 th day, reaching 460 ± 38 U/g, corresponding to a productivity of 3. 2 ± 0. 3 U/(g h); and stabilizing till the end of 20 days, yielding 578 ± 20 U/g. Finally, the whole fermented cake with lipase was lyophilized and applied in esterification reactions, combining different carboxylic acids with alcohols. A 100 % conversion yield was obtained for decanoic acid with butanol using 20 % (w/w) lipase. Optimisation process led to the use of 5 % lipase in universal buffer at pH 7 or 8, for 24 h at 37 ºC, to obtain butyl decanoate ester. The biotechnological valorisation of SSF combining <b>oil</b> <b>cakes</b> is an interesting strategy to produce considerable amounts of lipase. Further, lipase produced may be applied to produce butyl decanoate ester, a natural flavor with interest for food industry...|$|R

Treatments included application of 0, 25, 50, 75, or 100 % of the recommended amount (RA) of <b>oil</b> <b>cake,</b> respectively. <b>Oil</b> <b>cake</b> application at 50 %, 75 %, or 100 % of the RA increased dry matter (DM) production by > 1, 500 kg ha⁻¹ compared to the 0 % RA control. All rates of application of <b>oil</b> <b>cake</b> increased the pH, organic matter content, macro-nutrient concentrations, cation exchange capacity, and electrical conductivity of the soil at depths of 0 – 20 cm in 2012 and in 2013. Consequently, all applications of <b>oil</b> <b>cake</b> increased leaf N concentrations by > 1 %, and resulted in more than four water sprouts (shoots) per tree compared to the 0 % RA treatment in 2012 and in 2013. Light interception by the central region of the canopy of each tree was reduced as rates of application of <b>oil</b> <b>cake</b> increased (R² = 0. 559). All rates of application of <b>oil</b> <b>cake</b> increased mean fruit weights by > 8 g, and fruit firmness values by > 1. 4 N, compared to the 0 % RA controls. The 3 -year average fruit yield was highest (29, 110 kg ha⁻¹) in the 50 % RA treatment. Gross incomes from the 50 % RA treatment in 2012 and in 2013 were approx. 19 % higher than those from the 0 % RA controls.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A pot {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the efficacy of different <b>oil</b> <b>cakes</b> against the root knot nematode. Root knot nematodes are the major agricultural pest of wide range of crops worldwide. Chickpea, Cicer arietinum L., family Fabaceae, is a high yielding proteinaceous pulse crop with India being the leading producer. Root knot nematodes {{are one of the}} major biological constraint that reduces per capita yield of this pulse crops. In the present investigation, studies were made to determine the efficacy of different <b>oil</b> <b>cakes</b> viz. Azadirachta indica (Neem), Brassica campestris (Mustard) and Gossypium hirsutum (Cotton). Two doses (50 and 100 g) of each neem, mustard and cotton <b>oil</b> <b>cakes</b> were applied to reduce nematode infestation in chickpea. Results revealed that root gall development due to Meloidogyne incognita were significantly reduced in all the treatments and enhance all the plant growth characters of C. arietinum. Higher dose of neem <b>oil</b> <b>cake</b> was found to be most effective as compared to other treatments. Hence, it may be concluded that <b>oil</b> <b>cakes</b> are better substitute against nematicide for the effective control of root-knot nematode and reduce environmental hazards for ecologically safe environment...|$|R
