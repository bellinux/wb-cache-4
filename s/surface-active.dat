5|$|According to the varying-permeability model, {{gas bubble}} nuclei are simply stable microbubbles. The {{stability}} of these microbubbles {{is due to}} elastic skins or membranes consisting of <b>surface-active</b> molecules. These skins are normally permeable to gas, and collapse is prevented by their compression strength. These skins can become stiff and effectively impermeable to gas when they are subjected to large compressions, typically exceeding 8atm, at which stage the pressure inside increases during further compression as predicted by Boyle's law.|$|E
5|$|This {{decompression}} {{model was}} developed by D.E. Yount {{and others at the}} University of Hawaii to model laboratory observations of bubble formation and growth in both inanimate and in vivo systems exposed to pressure variations. It presumes that microscopic bubble nuclei always exist in aqueous media, including living tissues. These bubble nuclei are spherical gas phases that are small enough to remain in suspension yet strong enough to resist collapse, their stability being provided by an elastic surface layer consisting of <b>surface-active</b> molecules with variable gas permeability. These skins resist the effect of surface tension, as surface tension tends to collapse a small bubble by raising internal pressure above ambient so that the partial pressure gradient favours diffusion out of the bubble in inverse proportion to the radius of the surface.|$|E

25|$|Using these data, he {{quantified}} radical {{loss from}} particles, showing that simple diffusion theory {{could explain the}} results. Gilbert and his coworkers then revealed the mechanism for initiation in emulsion polymerisation by the entry of radicals into particles—in terms of fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic precepts—in a theory that clarifies the process as being through production of <b>surface-active</b> species in the water phase. This model produced various qualitative predictions. One prediction, that of {{the independence of the}} entry-rate coefficient of the size and surface properties of particles, was widely seen as counterintuitive because of the deep-rooted belief in models that he had shown to be wrong. Subsequently, this prediction was experimentally verified by Gilbert and others. He used the understanding from this knowledge to develop a priori models for particle formation and molecular-weight distribution.|$|E
25|$|A solvent {{can carry}} a {{supersaturated}} load of gas in solution. Whether it {{will come out of}} solution in the bulk of the solvent to form bubbles will depend on a number of factors. Something which reduces surface tension, or adsorbs gas molecules, or locally reduces solubility of the gas, or causes a local reduction in static pressure in a fluid may result in a bubble nucleation or growth. This may include velocity changes and turbulence in fluids and local tensile loads in solids and semi-solids. Lipids and other hydrophobic surfaces may reduce surface tension (blood vessel walls may have this effect). Dehydration may reduce gas solubility in a tissue due to higher concentration of other solutes, and less solvent to hold the gas. Another theory presumes that microscopic bubble nuclei always exist in aqueous media, including living tissues. These bubble nuclei are spherical gas phases that are small enough to remain in suspension yet strong enough to resist collapse, their stability being provided by an elastic surface layer consisting of <b>surface-active</b> molecules which resists the effect of surface tension.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the term}} [...] "Janus particles" [...] {{was not yet}} used, Lee and {{coworkers}} reported the first particles matching this description in 1985. They introduced asymmetric polystyrene/polymethylmethacrylate lattices from seeded emulsion polymerization. One year later, Casagrande and Veyssie reported the synthesis of glass beads that were made hydrophobic on only one hemisphere using octadecyl trichlorosilane, while the other hemisphere was protected with a cellulose varnish. The glass beads were studied for their potential to stabilize emulsification processes. Then several years later, Binks and Fletcher investigated the wettability of Janus beads at the interface between oil and water. They concluded Janus particles are both <b>surface-active</b> and amphiphilic, whereas homogeneous particles are only <b>surface-active.</b> Twenty years later, a plethora of Janus particles of different sizes, shapes and properties, with applications in textile, sensors, ...|$|E
2500|$|Dispersants {{can be used}} to {{dissipate}} oil slicks. A dispersant is either a non-surface active polymer or a <b>surface-active</b> substance added to a suspension, usually a colloid, to improve the separation of [...] and to prevent settling or [...] They may rapidly disperse large amounts of certain oil types from the sea surface by transferring it into the water column. They will cause the oil slick to break up and form water-soluble micelles that are rapidly d. The oil is then effectively spread throughout a larger volume of water than the surface from where the oil was dispersed. They can also delay the formation of persistent oil-in-water emulsions. However, laboratory experiments showed that dispersants increased toxic hydrocarbon levels in fish by a factor of up to 100 and may kill fish eggs. Dispersed oil droplets infiltrate into deeper water and can lethally contaminate coral. Research indicates that some dispersants are toxic to corals. A 2012 study found that Corexit dispersant had increased the toxicity of oil by up to 52 times.|$|E

50|$|Degradation {{can occur}} on the {{polymers}} during the flow. Because of the pressure and temperature on the polymers, {{it is easier to}} break them down. Because of this, the drag reducing agent is re-injected after points like pumps and turns, where the pressure and temperature can be extra high. To safeguard against degradation at high temperature, a different class of drag reducing agents are at times used, namely, surfactants. Surfactant is a very convenient contraction of the term <b>Surface-active</b> agent. It connotes an organic molecule or an unformulated compound having <b>surface-active</b> properties. All three classes of surfactants, namely, anionic, cationic and nonionic surfactants, have been successfully tried as drag-reducing agents.|$|E

50|$|Proteins are {{the main}} <b>surface-active</b> agents {{responsible}} for the formation, and stabilization of the dispersed gas phase. <b>Surface-active</b> molecules are prominent at {{the surface of a}} liquid, rather than at the bulk of it due to their structure. A portion of the molecule is hydrophilic with a polar charge, and another portion is hydrophobic because it is non-polar. The non-polar section has little or no affinity for water, and so it is energetically favorable for this section to be as far away from the water as possible. However, the polar section is attracted to the water and has little or no affinity for the air. Therefore, the molecule orients at the surface with the polar section in the water, with the non-polar section in the air. Two primary proteins that are commonly used as aerators in marshmallows are albumen (egg whites) and gelatin.|$|E
