40|$|Version 068 â€“ Page 2 The unstructured-mesh SWAN {{spectral}} wave {{model and}} the ADCIRC shallow-water circulation model have been integrated into a tightly-coupled SWAN+ADCIRC model. The model components are applied to an identical, unstructured mesh; share parallel computing infrastructure; and run sequentially in time. Wind speeds, water levels, currents and radiation stress gradients are vertex-based, and therefore can be passed through memory or cache to each model component. Parallel simulations based on domain decomposition utilize identical sub-meshes, and the communication is highly localized. Inter-model communication is intra-core, while intra-model communication is inter-core but is local and efficient because it is solely on adjacent sub-mesh edges. The resulting integrated SWAN+ADCIRC system is highly scalable and allows for localized increases in resolution without the complexity or cost of nested meshes or global interpolation between heterogeneous meshes.

40|$|Abstract: Solar chromospheric surges {{are often}} {{reported}} to contain rotational motion. However, {{the details of}} the motion and driving mechanism of the surges are not yet fully understood. Recurrent surges with rotational motion at AR 10930 on the west limb are observed by Hinode Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) continuously from 11 : 21 UT on December 18 to 09 : 58 UT on December 19, 2006, using the Ca ii H broadband filter. We analyze details of the motion including number of turns from the rise of the surge to the fall, axial speed and acceleration. During the observation, rise and fall motion accompanying rotation appears recurrently. There occur a total of 14 <b>surges</b> at <b>AR</b> 10930 over 17 hours. The average duration is 45 minutes, and the average width, and length are 8 Mm, and 39 Mm, respectively. We speculate that the surges occurred by recurrent reconnections between the twisted prominence and large untwisted flux tube...|$|R
40|$|JOP 17 and JOP 33 are SOHO Joint Observing Programs in {{collaboration}} with Yohkoh/SXT and ground based observatories (GBO's), dedicated to observe dynamical events through the atmosphere. During runs of these programs we observed in restructuring active regions (<b>ARs),</b> <b>surges,</b> subflares, bright knots, but not large flares and jets. From these observations {{we have been able}} to derive some of the responses of the coronal and chromospheric plasma to the evolution of the photospheric magnetic field. Emerging flux in an AR led to the formation of Arch Filament Systems in the chromosphere, hot loops and knots in the transition region, and X-ray loops. Frequent surges have been observed in relation to parasitic or mixed polarities, but coronal jets have not yet been found. We discuss the possible mechanisms acting during the restructuring of the active regions (reconnection or "sea-serpent" geometries). INTRODUCTION The evolution of active regions is mainly due to emerging flux, while in For t [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We {{observe a}} solar <b>surge</b> in NOAA <b>AR</b> 11271 using SDO AIA 304 image data on 25 August, 2011. The surge rises {{vertically}} from its origin upto {{a height of}} 65 Mm with a terminal velocity of 100 km/s, and thereafter falls and fades gradually. The total life time of the surge was 20 min. We also measure the temperature and density distribution of the observed surge during its maximum rise, and found an average temperature and density of 2. 0 MK and 4. 1 x 109 cm- 3, respectively. The temperature map shows the expansion and mixing of cool plasma lagging behind the hot coronal plasma along the surge. As SDO/HMI temporal image data does not show any detectable evidence of the significant photospheric magnetic field cancellation {{for the formation of}} the observed surge, we infer that it is probably driven by magnetic reconnection generated thermal energy in the lower chromosphere. The radiance (thus mass density) oscillations near the base of the surge are also evident, which may be the most likely signature of its formation by a reconnection generated pulse. In support of the present observational base-line of the triggering of the surge due to chromospheric heating, we devise a numerical model with conceivable implementation of VAL-C atmosphere and a thermal pulse as an initial trigger. We find that the pulse steepens into a slow shock at higher altitudes that triggers plasma perturbations exhibiting the observed features of the surge, e. g., terminal velocity, height, width, life-time, and heated fine structures near its base.
