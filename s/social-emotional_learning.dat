40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between special health care needs and <b>social-emotional</b> and <b>learning</b> competence in the early years, reporting on two waves of data from the Kindergarten Cohort of Growing up in Australia: The Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC). Six hundred and fifty children were identified through the 2 -question Special Health Care Needs Screener as having special health care needs. Children with special health care needs {{were more likely to be}} male, to have been of low birth weight, to be taking prescription medications, to be diagnosed with a specific health condition and to be from families where the mother was less well educated. These children scored significantly lower on teacher-rated <b>social-emotional</b> and <b>learning</b> competencies prior to school compared to a control group of children without special health care needs. Multiple regression analyses indicated that being identified with a special health care need prior to school predicted lower <b>social-emotional</b> and <b>learning</b> competencies in the early years of school.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{children}} with special health care needs surviving infancy and attending school has been increasing. Due to their health status, these children {{may be at risk}} of low <b>social-emotional</b> and <b>learning</b> competencies (e. g., Lightfoot, Mukherjee, & Sloper, 2000; Zehnder, Landolt, Prchal, & Vollrath, 2006). Early social problems have been linked to low levels of academic achievement (Ladd, 2005), inappropriate behaviours at school (Shiu, 2001) and strained teacher-child relationships (Blumberg, Carle, O‘Connor, Moore, & Lippmann, 2008). Early learning difficulties have been associated with mental health problems (Maughan, Rowe, Loeber, & Stouthamer-Loeber, 2003), increased behaviour issues (Arnold, 1997), delinquency (Loeber & Dishion, 1983) and later academic failure (Epstein, 2008). Considering the importance of these areas, the limited research on special health care needs in <b>social-emotional</b> and <b>learning</b> domains is a factor driving this research. The purpose of the current research is to investigate <b>social-emotional</b> and <b>learning</b> competence in the early years for Australian children who have special health care needs. The data which informed this thesis was from Growing up in Australia: The Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. This is a national, longitudinal study being conducted by the Commonwealth Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. The study has a national representative sample, with data collection occurring biennially, in 2004 (Wave 1), 2006 (Wave 2) and 2008 (Wave 3). Growing up in Australia uses a cross-sequential research design involving two cohorts, an Infant Cohort (0 - 1 at recruitment) and a Kindergarten Cohort (4 - 5 at recruitment). This study uses the Kindergarten Cohort, for which there were 4, 983 children at recruitment. Three studies were conducted to address the objectives of this thesis. Study 1 used Wave 1 data to identify and describe Australian children with special health care needs. Children who identified as having special health care needs through the special health care needs screener were selected. From this, descriptive analyses were run. The results indicate that boys, children with low birth weight and children from families with low levels of maternal education are likely to be in the population of children with special health care needs. Further, these children are likely to be using prescription medications, have poor general health and are likely to have specific condition diagnoses. Study 2 used Wave 1 data to examine differences between children with special health care needs and their peers in <b>social-emotional</b> competence and <b>learning</b> competence prior to school. Children identified by the special health care needs screener were chosen for the case group (n = 650). A matched case control group of peers (n = 650), matched on sex, cultural and linguistic diversity, family socioeconomic position and age, were the comparison group. Social-emotional competence was measured through Social/Emotional Domain scores taken from the Growing up in Australia Outcome Index, with learning competence measured through Learning Domain scores. Results suggest statistically significant differences in scores between the two groups. Children with special health care needs have lower levels of <b>social-emotional</b> and <b>learning</b> competence prior to school compared to their peers. Study 3 used Wave 1 and Wave 2 data {{to examine the relationship between}} special health care needs at Wave 1 and <b>social-emotional</b> competence and <b>learning</b> competence at Wave 2, as children started school. The sample for this study consisted of children in the Kindergarten Cohort who had teacher data at Wave 2. Results from multiple regression models indicate that special health care needs prior to school (Wave 1) significantly predicts <b>social-emotional</b> competence and <b>learning</b> competence in the early years of school (Wave 2). These results indicate that having special health care needs prior to school is a risk factor for the <b>social-emotional</b> and <b>learning</b> domains in the early years of school. The results from these studies give valuable insight into Australian children with special health care needs and their <b>social-emotional</b> and <b>learning</b> competence in the early years. The Australia population of children with special health care needs were primarily male children, from families with low maternal education, were likely to be of poor health and taking prescription medications. It was found that children with special health care needs were likely to have lower <b>social-emotional</b> competence and <b>learning</b> competence prior to school compared to their peers. Results indicate that special health care needs prior to school were predictive of lower <b>social-emotional</b> and <b>learning</b> competencies in the early years of school. More research is required into this unique population and their competencies over time. However, the current research provides valuable insight into an under researched 'at risk' population...|$|R

5000|$|Mindfulness in the {{classroom}} is being touted as a promising new intervention tool for young students. According to Choudhury and Moses, “Although still marginal and in some cases controversial, secular programs of mindfulness have been implemented with ambitious goals of improving attentional focus of pupils, <b>social-emotional</b> <b>learning</b> in “at-risk” children and youth, not least, to intervene in problems of poverty and incarceration”. Emerging research is concerned with studying teachers and programs using mindfulness practices with students, and is discovering tension arising from the moral reframing of eastern practices in western school settings. As cited by Renshaw and Cook, “Unlike most other approaches to contemporary school-based intervention, which are squarely grounded in behavioral, cognitive-behavioral, and ecological systems theories, MBIs have their origins in Eastern religious traditions”. Some school administrators are concerned about implementing such practices, and parents have been reported to take their children out of mindfulness programs because of their personal religious beliefs. Yet, MBI’s continue to be accepted by the mainstream in both primary and secondary schools because, “Mindfulness practices, particularly in relationship to children who might otherwise be considered broken or unredeemable, fill a critical niche - one that allows its advocates to imagine a world where people can change, become more compassionate, resilient, reflective, and aware; a world with a viable future”. [...] As mindfulness in education continues to develop, ethical consequences will remain a controversial issue because the generic description for the “benefits” and “results” of MBI’s are largely concerned with individual and inward-focused achievement, rather than the original Buddhist ideal of global human connection.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this evaluative study was to develop and {{implement}} a program evaluation design for a model of early mental health intervention to primary grade level classrooms. in a public elementary school. The design reflects a formative evaluation study, providing information for current and future programming and is manageable to implement, thus facilitating longitudinal data collection. This therapeutic model of classroom intervention stresses the integration of children’s social, emotional and intellectual development and proposes a collaborative approach between therapist and educator. Levels of intervention for collaborators include (1) children identified as requiring therapeutic approaches to social-emotional difficulties experienced in the classroom, (2) all children in the classroom and, (3) the classroom milieu. The overall goal is to promote optimal growth at all levels. The program evaluation design includes a format for monitoring the service delivery system of the model and to identify procedural and collaborative discrepancies. Information regarding collaborators 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of identified children is collected from written intervention plans. Assessment of the frequency and nature of peer interactions was accomplished in this study through an observational technique in the classrooms.

40|$|Background A {{relatively}} new theoretical concept is proposed in this paper, namely, the individual learning path. Learning paths {{are created by}} individual employees and comprise a set of learning-relevant activities that are both coherent {{as a whole and}} meaningful to them. Objectives To explore the empirical basis of this theoretical concept. Design A qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews. Settings Two academic medical centers (university hospitals) and two general hospitals in the Netherlands. Participants A total of 89 nurses were involved in the study. Methods Semi-structured interviews were analyzed qualitatively; cluster analysis was then performed on quantified data from the interviews. Results Four types of learning path emerged, namely, the formal-external, self-directed, <b>social–emotional,</b> and information-oriented <b>learning</b> paths. Conclusions The {{relatively new}} theoretical concept of an individual learning path can be observed in practice and a number of different learning-path types can be distinguished. Nurses were found to create their own learning paths, that is, select a theme that is relevant primarily to themselves, conduct a variety of learning activities around this theme, participate in social contexts that might help them, and mobilize learning facilities provided by their organization. These activities go way beyond the notion of employees as self-directed learners merely in a didactic sense (establishing learning goals, choosing the right learning activities for these goals, evaluating to what extent their goals have been met as a result). The findings can be interpreted as evidence of employees acting strategically {{when it comes to their}} professional development.

50|$|Up {{until the}} 1990s, Selman's risk and {{prevention}} framework {{had been used}} primarily to understand one-on-one social interactions between individuals. By moving these ideas into a school-based curriculum, Selman and his colleagues experimented with how the approach applied to children’s understanding of their relationships with peers from different cultures or identity groups. One method of delivery was to children's literature that contained stories with social justice themes, and then to design teachers’ guides for these texts. Selman partnered with colleagues, such as literacy expert and linguist Catherine E. Snow, to develop methods of literacy instruction {{that could be used}} in grades K-6. Selman and Snow collaborated with colleagues at Zaner-Bloser to develop Teachers’ Guides for books such as Freedom Summer and Felita. The guides were designed to teach reading and writing but also included exercises to develop students’ ability to take perspectives on other individuals’ experiences, their understanding of others’ cultural beliefs, and to strengthen their conflict-resolution strategies. Selman and colleagues conducted qualitative and quantitative studies of classrooms as they used the texts. In these studies, and subsequent work, Selman and his colleagues questioned the ways in which social perspective-taking and understanding may be related to student’s reading, writing, and oral communication skills. For Selman, this work signaled a transition in his career from conducting primarily foundational research in child development to developing school-based practices to negotiating school policy and then cycling back to research, this time focused on working with and learning from schools and communities. He has also consulted with and contributed to the content for Facing History and Ourselves curricular materials designed to promote civic and moral engagement in youth, and he is a guest expert for the Random Acts of Kindness Foundation's (RAK) online curriculum for educators who want to promote <b>social-emotional</b> <b>learning</b> in their classrooms (RAK is funded by Philip Anschutz's The Foundation for a Better Life).|$|E

40|$|Latino adolescents, {{especially}} English {{language learners}} (ELLs) {{are considered to}} be a highly vulnerable group in our schools today. Despite their apparent need for additional <b>social-emotional</b> and academic <b>learning</b> (SEAL) supports, there is very little research to inform the type of cultural modifications (if any) needed to make SEAL interventions more appropriate for this population. Accordingly, this study focused on identifying the effects of acculturative stress (a culturally specific stressor) and general mental health problems on students' academic performance. More specifically, this study aimed to identify which factor (mental health problems or acculturative stress) best explains Latino adolescent ELLs' academic performance. This study defined mental health problems as being comprised of internalizing and externalizing symptoms and acculturative stress as being comprised of perceived discrimination, immigration related stress, parent-child acculturative gap, and school belonging. Hierarchical multiple regression was used {{to examine the effects of}} mental health problems and acculturative stress on the academic performance of Latino adolescents. Although both mental health problems and acculturative stress explained significant variance in academic performance, acculturative stress was the stronger contributing variable. Interactions between ELL status and mental health problems and ELL status and acculturative stress were examined to determine whether ELL status influenced the degree to which these two contributing constructs explained academic performance. Non-significant interactions between ELL status and mental health problems and ELL status and acculturative stress suggest that ELL status was not a moderating factor. Although ELL status was not a moderating factor in the relationship between acculturative stress and academic performance, independent sample t-tests suggest that acculturative stress levels were significantly higher for Latino adolescent ELLs than for Latino adolescent non-ELLs. The results of this study suggest that while generic mental health problems are still important to address in SEAL interventions for Latino students, it may be of equal or even more importance to also address acculturative stress. Addressing acculturative stress in SEAL interventions for ELLs has been supported by the results of this study and previous research...|$|R

A new method: the Mixed Interval Classroom Observation (MICRO) schedule was used to collect data about teachers’ use of 4 different types of verbal feedback and make associations with the proportion of students’ time in academic classes that they were following teachers’ directions and were ‘on-task’. Key findings from 27 UK secondary schools included: students were significantly less ‘on-task’ than students in UK primary schools; secondary school teachers used low frequencies of positive verbal feedback directed towards academic work and behaviour and much higher frequencies of critical comments directed towards behaviour; teachers’ critical comments directed towards behaviour {{were significantly associated with}} lessons where students were less compliant with teachers’ directions; and teachers who used high frequencies of positive comments directed towards academic work and social behaviour were not associated with lessons where students followed teachers’ directions more. The number of teachers who did not use any positive comments about social behaviour was high compared to the findings of previous researchers. Teachers who used verbal feedback were more likely to use more with the lower year groups. Unlike primary students, no evidence was found that secondary students were more engaged with academic work when taught by teachers who used higher levels of verbal teaching behaviour: teachers who talked more. A number of contextual factors were also examined for their association with students’ compliance with teachers’ directions. Findings included: teachers who were more experienced {{were more likely to be}} teaching students who followed their directions. Subsequently, every teacher in one particular secondary school that had been placed in ‘special measures’ following an Ofsted inspection, was observed twice, A. M. and P. M., using the MICRO schedule, and the results were statistically compared with the UK dataset of 27 secondary schools described above. Initial findings of this exercise were shared with the school’s senior leadership team (SLT) and their discussion was recorded, transcribed and analysed using the ‘Iterative Learning Conversations’ (ILCS) discourse analysis method (Apter, 2014). Findings revealed that the SLT believed that the exercise of exploring the statistical comparison was of significant utility in strategic planning. The results provided evidence for their beliefs as to why the maths department had been found to have serious weaknesses during the inspection, and that the way that teachers used verbal feedback throughout the school required further monitoring and improvement. Conclusions are drawn about the nature of teachers’ verbal feedback in secondary schools and how Bandura’s (1977) Social Learning Theory and reciprocal determinism provide a robust psychologically explanatory model (more-so than a behavioural stimulus-response model) as to how the bi-directional interaction of teacher-feedback and student behaviour works to indicate the conduciveness of the <b>social-emotional</b> climate for <b>learning</b> in a school...|$|R
40|$|The study {{evolved from}} a {{professional}} interest in the difficulties faced by boys in an academically challenging school context. Existing research evidence {{suggests that there is}} a link between performance at school and specific pedagogical styles used within the teaching environment. This study builds on this evidence-base with the implementation of an intervention program incorporating aspects of Social Constructivist and Essentialist models of pedagogy. The study was designed to monitor this implementation. Students 2 ̆ 7 academic performance, behaviour, motivation and attitude were explored {{in the context of this}} pedagogical intervention using the lens of a two-part research question. The research is informed by a pragmatic understanding of the epistemology of constructivism and the principles associated with the theoretical framework of symbolic interactionism. It is a case study of an intervention program, supported by a combination of quantitative and qualitative research methods. The context is a Senior Catholic College catering for the final two years of high school with a student population exceeding 1100. The school is a receiver school for associated junior schools and caters for both males and females. Students remain with the College for 18 months, the duration of their studies in preparation for the New South Wales Higher School Certificate. The researcher is a teacher in the English Department. The interest in boys 2 ̆ 7 education stems from a longstanding association with students from a broad spectrum of academic abilities, particularly in remedial and low-ability classes. A review of literature served to identify three main groups of influence on the education of boys: school context; student <b>social-emotional</b> well-being; and <b>learning</b> theory models. The literature review helped situate the problem of boys 2 ̆ 7 academic experiences of underachievement more firmly within the theoretical perspectives of pedagogy.;Two models were examined more closely: the Essentialist and the Social Constructivist. Data in response to the Research Questions identified that: Positive experiences at school and the subsequent changes in the patterns of behaviour, attitude and motivation were aligned to a number of factors including experiences within an intervention program using information technology and audio-visual stimulus. Other positive factors included the trialing of single-sex groupings in mixed-ability co educational settings. Self-reported negative experiences at school were not confined to gender but aligned to the complexity and demands of the senior school English curriculum; its perceived irrelevance and mismatch with post-school needs. Similarly, the reported discrepancies between student and teacher perception of social-emotional well-being problems among students and a lack of decision-making opportunities may have further contributed to the sense of alienation, stress and frustration. Implications were drawn from the research and the study concludes with recommendations which focus on creating more positive school experiences for academically less capable students. First, it recommends the implementation of aspects of Social Constructivist and Essentialist models of pedagogical structures using information technology and audio-visual stimulus. Second, it recommends the organization of single-sex groupings in mixed-ability co-educational settings to assist in improving academic experiences of low-ability boys in Year 11 English classes - both aspects of the intervention program central to thi...|$|R

Langerian Mindfulness is also considered as a tool for increasing <b>Social-Emotional</b> <b>Learning</b> in integrated classrooms. It is recommended that mindful interventions be further investigated in the primary and secondary school context...|$|E
40|$|The problem {{this study}} {{addresses}} {{is the extent}} to which <b>social-emotional</b> <b>learning</b> programming is effectively implemented. Since <b>social-emotional</b> <b>learning</b> programming has emerged as a significant aspect of U. S. education, man states have included social-emotional standards and programming as an essential part of the curriculum. Researchers have found that effective reform includes not only emphasis on academic and standardized test scores, but also on social-emotional influences. As a school reform initiative, a Social Emotional Learning (SEL) program is being implemented at a Midwestern high school. The purpose of this qualitative descriptive interview study was to explore the perceived effectiveness of the implementation. The conceptual framework was drawn from Fullan 2 ̆ 7 s 6 assertions that serve as a guide to monitor school success when implementing education reforms. The study 2 ̆ 7 s guiding questions concerned teachers 2 ̆ 7 perceived supports and challenges in the process of implementation, as well as any perceived role changes they experienced during the process. Eight high school teachers who had taught the SEL classes were interviewed. Data were transcribed, coded for themes using Hatch 2 ̆ 7 s typology, and thematically analyzed. The key findings included that participants were supported by the counselors and their peers. However, they encountered implementation challenges including the class schedule, lack of student buy-in, and the need for ongoing supports to facilitate social emotional learning. This study contributes to social change by informing school leaders of best practices necessary to ensure the implementation and sustainability of SEL practices. <b>Social-emotional</b> <b>learning</b> initiatives that implemented with fidelity can improve both the academic and personal success of students...|$|E

The teaching of specific social and emotional (SEL) skills enable students to demonstrate these values in action. These include social skills such as sharing, cooperation, anger management, respectful disagreeing, negotiation, playing fairly and being a good winner and loser, having an interesting conversation, telling a funny story and managing a disagreement well (McGrath and Francey 1991; McGrath and Noble 2010, 2011). The findings of a large-scale meta-analysis of SEL programs (Durlak et al. 2011) confirmed the positive impact of such programs on student learning and achievement. This meta-analysis focused on 213 school-based, universal <b>social-emotional</b> <b>learning</b> (SEL) programs and involved over 270, 000 students from primary-school entry to year 12. Compared {{to those in the}} control group, students who participated in <b>social-emotional</b> <b>learning</b> programs not only showed significant improvements in social-emotional skills and behaviour but also demonstrated an 11 -percentile-point gain in academic achievement.|$|E

To consider these issues, this paper focuses on (a) the suggested data science research methodology that is applicable to reach these goals, and (b) the case study of <b>social-emotional</b> <b>learning</b> in which we used the data science research methodology.|$|E

However, {{there has been no}} empirical work to date that identifies the factors important for the long-term sustainability of programs established as excellent models of implementation. Using a series of case studies of evidence-based socialemotional learning programs implemented successfully for at least five years, this study articulates principles that characterize programs that were found to be well-sustained over time. These principles have implications for practice and serve as starting points for future research. peer-reviewe...|$|E
