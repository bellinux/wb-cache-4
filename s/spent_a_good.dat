5|$|An {{economic}} {{boom in the}} south {{following the end of}} World War I greatly increased Southern's revenues. Harrison <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal of time traveling around the southern United States, endeavoring to increase southern industry. When he traveled, he used two private railroad cars, named the Carolina and the Virginia. Other railroad presidents used only one, which made Harrison's practice unique. The Carolina was a sleeping car and the Virginia was set up to serve members of the Board of Directors, with a kitchen, dining room, and observation area.|$|E
5|$|Thereafter Asser {{seems to}} have divided his time between Wales and Alfred's court. Asser gives no {{information}} about his time in Wales, but mentions various places that he visited in England, including the battlefield at Ashdown, Cynuit (Countisbury), and Athelney. It is evident from Asser's account that he <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal of time with Alfred: he recounts meeting Alfred's mother-in-law, Eadburh (who {{is not the same}} Eadburh who died as a beggar in Pavia), on many occasions; and says that he has often seen Alfred hunting.|$|E

6000|$|The whole neighbourhood, in fact, teemed with sad yet {{interesting}} {{sights and}} scenes, and with strange violent contrasts. It {{was not a}} spot which one would naturally select for a ramble on a summer evening after dinner; nevertheless it was a locality where time might have been profitably <b>spent,</b> where <b>a</b> <b>good</b> lesson or two might have been learned {{by those who have}} a tendency to [...] "consider the poor." ...|$|R
5|$|In late 1833 Etty was {{commissioned}} by Williams-Wynn to paint a portrait of two of his seven children. Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball depicts Williams-Wynn's daughters Charlotte and Mary, dressing up in lavish Italian-style costume. Although their dress is generally described as Italian, Dennis Farr's 1958 biography of Etty speculates that elements of the costumes were possibly intended to be Russian, based on Charlotte's headdress. The Italian-style clothing likely represents {{the high level of}} interest in Italian culture in early 19th-century England. The popularity of the style of music now known as bel canto, widely associated with Italy, was at its peak; likewise, the Italian plays of William Shakespeare had become extremely popular in the period. Etty, who had <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal of time in Venice and other Italian cities, would have been very familiar with Italian clothing designs, and the costumes worn by the Williams-Wynn sisters closely resemble those of women in Venetian scenes painted by Etty, such as 1831's Window in Venice, During a Fiesta. As art historian Leonard Robinson points out, despite the title the sisters are not in fact shown preparing for the ball, but are fully dressed. The style of the work reflects that of Thomas Lawrence, who had been Etty's teacher in 1807–08, {{as well as that of}} Joshua Reynolds, of whom Etty was a great admirer and of whose works Etty had often made copies as an exercise.|$|E
25|$|Anthony Appiah {{was raised}} in Kumasi, Ghana, and educated at Bryanston School and Clare College, Cambridge, where he earned his BA (First Class) and PhD degree in philosophy.

25|$|Around 1901, {{acting on}} a tip about a {{racetrack}} soon to be built outside Hot Springs, Arkansas, the Baroness traveled there and bought the Potash Sulphur Springs Hotel. She <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> {{amount of time and}} money renovating the hotel and sold it for a tidy profit prior to the opening of the racetrack in 1903. Shaver acted as her legal advisor on matters related to this real estate deal.|$|E
50|$|In microeconomics, an Engel curve {{describes}} how household expenditure on <b>a</b> particular <b>good</b> or service varies with household income. There are two varieties of Engel curves. Budget share Engel curves describe how {{the proportion of}} household income <b>spent</b> on <b>a</b> <b>good</b> varies with income. Alternatively, Engel curves can also describe how real expenditure varies with household income. They are named after the German statistician Ernst Engel (1821-1896), {{who was the first}} to investigate this relationship between goods expenditure and income systematically in 1857. The best-known single result from the article is Engel's law which states that the poorer a family is, the larger the budget share it spends on nourishment.|$|R
50|$|For example, if {{the money}} cost of <b>a</b> <b>good</b> is $100, and the ratio of {{consumption}} to production is 3/4, then the real cost of the good is $100(3/4) = $75. As a result, if <b>a</b> consumer <b>spent</b> $100 for <b>a</b> <b>good,</b> the National Credit Authority would rebate the consumer $25. The good costs the consumer $75, the retailer receives $100, and the consumer receives the difference of $25 via new credits created by the National Credit Authority.|$|R
25|$|Upon {{completion}} of his studies in Munich, Kraljević {{returned to his}} family, who had by then moved to Požega, and where he <b>spent</b> 1910 and <b>a</b> <b>good</b> part of 1911. During this time, he painted Self-portrait with Dog (Croatian: Autoportret sa psom), {{and many of his}} other well-known portraits, landscapes and other works with rustic themes. He also returned to his interest in sculpture, producing works in clay, plaster and bronze.|$|R
25|$|Oded Irshai {{observed}} that Cyril {{lived in a}} time of intense apocalyptic expectation, when Christians were eager to find apocalyptic meaning in every historical event or natural disaster. Cyril <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> part of his episcopacy in intermittent exile from Jerusalem. Abraham Malherbe argued that when a leader's control over a community is fragile, directing attention to the imminent arrival of the antichrist effectively diverts attention from that fragility.|$|E
25|$|In February 1752, the Virginia House of Burgesses {{granted the}} fourth city charter in Virginia to 'Winchester' as Frederick Town was renamed after Colonel Wood's birthplace in England. In 1754, Abraham Hollingsworth built the local {{residence}} called Abram's Delight, {{which served as}} the first local Quaker meeting house. George Washington <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> portion of his young life in Winchester helping survey the Fairfax land grant for Thomas Fairfax, Sixth Lord Fairfax, as well as performing surveying work for Colonel Wood. In 1758 Wood added 158 lots to {{the west side of}} town. In 1759 Thomas Lord Fairfax contributed 173 more lots to the south and east.|$|E

50|$|After {{six months}} spent in England, {{he made the}} most of the change of {{president}} in Paris (Charles Biétry replacing Michel Denisot) to return to the capital's club, where he spent two more seasons. Despite a more than decent 1999-00 season, he was notified that, due to Paris' youth policy, his services were no longer needed and that Lionel Letizi would replace him as the club's first choice goalkeeper. He quickly found a new club, Rennes, where he <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> season, {{at the end of which}} he expressed his desire to fulfill his childhood's dream and play for a Brazilian club. Unfortunately for him, no club expressed any interest in signing him, which led to his announcing the end of his career.|$|R

Her obituaries ran in newspapers across the country, including those in Portland, New Bedford, Massachusetts, and in the New York Times. Equi’s activist friend Julia Ruuttila described her as “a woman of passion and conviction (and) a real friend of the have-nots of this world.” She is buried alongside Harriet Speckart at Wilhelm's Portland Memorial, Portland, Multnomah County, Oregon.|$|R
25|$|James Livingston was a 15th-century cleric from East Lothian in {{south-eastern}} Scotland. Born at {{an unknown}} {{date in the}} 15th century, he was a son of the Laird of Saltcoats. He chose {{a career in the}} church, and became rector of the churches of Forteviot and Weme, and vicar of Innerleithen. By 1474, if not earlier, he had become dean for the whole diocese of Dunkeld. After the death of Thomas Lauder, Livingston was chosen as his successor as Bishop of Dunkeld. Although Livingston's appointment was contested at Rome by Thomas Spens, Bishop of Aberdeen, who wanted to be translated to Dunkeld, Livingston was consecrated on 30 June 1476. Livingston's episcopate is relatively obscure; he <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal of time in Edinburgh, where he is witness to several charters. He died at Edinburgh, on 28 August 1483. He was buried in Inchcolm.|$|E
25|$|Donovan {{was in fact}} {{very active}} in {{virtually}} every theater of World War II. He <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal {{of time in the}} Balkans, to which he had urged both Roosevelt and Churchill to pay more attention. He met in Europe with highly placed anti-Nazi Germans to broker an early peace that would allow for occupation by the Western Allies, establish a democratic Germany, and leave the Soviets out in the cold. In China, he struggled with Chiang Kai-shek and his underlings for permission to carry out espionage activities in their territory. He inspected OSS operations in Burma, met with Vyacheslav Molotov in Moscow to arrange for cooperation between the OSS and NKVD, and was present for MacArthur's successful April 1944 invasion of Hollandia on the northern coast of New Guinea. Overall, the OSS was most effective in the Balkans, China, Burma, and France.|$|E
25|$|Her {{father was}} Sir Bache Cunard, an {{heir to the}} Cunard Line {{shipping}} businesses, interested in polo and fox hunting, and a baronet. Her mother was Maud Alice Burke an American heiress, who adopted the first name Emerald and became a leading London society hostess. Nancy had been brought up on the family estate at Nevill Holt, Leicestershire but when her parents separated in 1911 she moved to London with her mother. Her education was at various boarding schools, including time in France and Germany. Whilst in London she <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal of her childhood with her mother's long time admirer, the novelist George Moore. Indeed, it was even rumoured that Moore was her father, and though this has been largely dismissed, {{there is no question}} that he played an important role whilst she was growing up. She would later write a memoir about her affection for 'GM'.|$|E
50|$|Waste of {{time and}} resources: Mission {{statements}} require planning, this takes time and effort {{for those who are}} responsible for creating the mission statement. If the mission statement is not achieved, then the process of creating the mission statement could be seen as a waste of time for all of the people involved. A lot of thought and time is <b>spent</b> in designing <b>a</b> <b>good</b> mission statement, and to have all of that time wasted is not what businesses can afford to be doing. The wasted time could have been spent on much more important tasks within the organisation such as decision-making for the business.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Solving {{constraint}} optimization {{problems is}} hard {{because it is}} not enough to find the best solution; an algorithm does not know a candidate is the best solution until it has proven that there are no better solutions. The proof can be long, compared to the time <b>spent</b> to find <b>a</b> <b>good</b> solution. In the cases where there are resource bounds, the proof of optimality may not be achievable and a tradeoff needs to be made between the solution quality and the cost due to the time delay. We propose a decision theoretic meta-reasoning-guided COP solver to address this issue. By choosing the action with the estimated maximal expected utility, the meta-reasoner finds a stopping point with <b>a</b> <b>good</b> tradeoff between the solution quality and the time cost. 1...|$|R

25|$|When Herod {{was still}} {{military}} {{governor in the}} Galilee, he <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal of time fighting bandits {{under the leadership of}} Ezekias. These bandits are best understood as a peasant group whose targets were local elites (both Hasmonean and Herodian) rather than Rome. Ventidius Cumanus (procurator 48 to 52 CE) often retaliated against brigandry by punishing peasant communities he believed to be their base of support. When a Galillean pilgrim on the way to Jerusalem was murdered by a Samaritan, the bandit chief Eliezar organized Galilleans for a counter-attack, and Cumanus moved against the Jews. A Syrian legate, Quadratus, intervened and sent several Jewish and Samaritan officials to Rome. The Emperor Claudius took the Jewish side, and had the Samaritan leaders executed and exiled, and turned one named Veler over to the Jews who beheaded him. Thus, widespread peasant unrest of this period was not exclusively directed against Rome but also expressed discontent against urban elites and other groups; Roman policy sought to contain the power of the bandits while cultivating Jewish support.|$|E

40|$|Determining {{the best}} initial {{parameter}} values for an algorithm, called parameter tuning, {{is crucial to}} obtaining better algorithm performance; however, it is often a time-consuming task {{and needs to be}} performed under a restricted computational budget. In this study, the results from our previous work on using the Taguchi method to tune the parameters of a memetic algorithm for cross-domain search are further analysed and extended. Although the Taguchi method reduces the time <b>spent</b> finding <b>a</b> <b>good</b> parameter value combination by running a smaller size of experiments on the training instances from different domains as opposed to evaluating all combinations, the time budget is still larger than desired. This work investigates the degree to which it is possible to predict the same good parameter setting faster by using a reduced time budget. The results in this paper show {{that it was possible to}} predict good combinations of parameter settings with a much reduced time budget. The good final parameter values are predicted for three of the parameters, while for the fourth parameter there is no clear best value, so one of three similarly performing values is identified at each time instant...|$|R
