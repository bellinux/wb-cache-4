He claims to have worked behind the scenes with the Fleming family, and believed this was the reason why filmmakers finally went ahead with Casino Royale.

In February 2005, Martin Campbell was announced as the film's director. Later in 2005, Sony led a consortium that purchased MGM, allowing Sony to gain distribution rights starting with the film.|$|E

The date for the attempted negotiations is debated; Some scholars including John F. Drinkwater set the event in 253 while others such as Alaric Watson <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> 256 following the destruction of Dura-Europos.|$|E

5|$|Muammar Mohammed Abu Minyar Gaddafi {{was born}} near Qasr Abu Hadi, {{a rural area}} outside the town of Sirte in the deserts of Tripolitania, western Libya. His family came from a small, {{relatively}} uninfluential tribal group called the Qadhadhfa, who were Arabized Berber in heritage. His mother was named Aisha (died 1978), and his father, Mohammad Abdul Salam bin Hamed bin Mohammad, was known as Abu Meniar (died 1985); the latter earned a meagre subsistence as a goat and camel herder. Nomadic Bedouins were illiterate and kept no birth records. As such, Gaddafi's date of birth is not known with certainty, and sources have <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> 1942 or {{in the spring of}} 1943, although his biographers David Blundy and Andrew Lycett noted {{that it could have been}} pre-1940. His parents' only surviving son, he had three older sisters. Gaddafi's upbringing in Bedouin culture influenced his personal tastes for the rest of his life; he preferred the desert over the city and would retreat there to meditate.|$|E

25|$|Isaac Newton's (1642–1727) {{mathematical}} {{explanation of}} universal gravitation explained the behavior both of objects {{here on earth}} and of objects in the heavens {{in a way that}} promoted a worldview in which the natural universe is controlled by laws of nature. This, in turn, suggested a theology in which God created the universe, <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> motion controlled by natural law and retired from the scene. The new awareness of the explanatory power of universal natural law also produced a growing skepticism about such religious staples as miracles (violations of natural law) and about religious books that reported them.|$|E

She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1943. In 1944, Cather received the gold medal for fiction from the National Institute of Arts and Letters, an award given once a decade for an author's total accomplishments. Though Cather suffered from no specific medical problems in her last years, those closest to her felt that her health was deteriorating.|$|E
25|$|Laurents {{was soon}} hired {{to write the}} {{screenplay}} for a remake of the 1934 Greta Garbo film The Painted Veil for Ava Gardner. While in Hollywood, he contacted Bernstein, who was in town conducting at the Hollywood Bowl. The two met at The Beverly Hills Hotel, and the conversation turned to juvenile delinquent gangs, a fairly recent social phenomenon that had received major coverage {{on the front pages}} of the morning newspapers due to a Chicano turf war. Bernstein suggested they rework East Side Story and <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> Los Angeles, but Laurents felt he was more familiar with Puerto Rican immigrants and Harlem than he was with Mexican Americans and Olvera Street. The two contacted Robbins, who was enthusiastic about a musical with a Latin beat. He arrived in Hollywood to choreograph the dance sequences for The King and I, and he and Laurents began developing the musical while working on their respective projects, keeping in touch with Bernstein, who had returned to New York. When the producer of The Painted Veil replaced Gardner with Eleanor Parker and asked Laurents to revise his script with her in mind, he backed out of the film, freeing him to devote all his time to the stage musical.|$|E

You should have <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> its prime, mere months ago". Matthew Gilbert of Boston Globe similarly wrote that [...] "It has become a powerful, promotional machine, long on hype and short on the human feeling--the glee--that once made it so addictive".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{went through}} several changes in production: working titles {{included}} [...] "Old Friends" [...] and [...] "Black Ops", {{the latter being}} set in an army base. Davies requested that Whithouse <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a school instead, mainly for simplicity, but also for a desire for the Doctor to masquerade as a school teacher. Additionally, the Krillitanes were to be named [...] "Krillians" [...] until the BBC found the name was trademarked, and Finch's forename was originally Hector, until the BBC found a real teacher by the same name, and renamed him Lucas. K9's eye grill was initially filmed flashing in sync with his lines, not unlike the Daleks, until Phil Collinson saw the footage and nixed the practice (which was inconsistent with the robot dog's past appearances). A scene that was cut was of Milo's brain being [...] "shorted out" [...] by the Doctor's rapid-fire questions {{at the beginning of}} the episode, which was later alluded to in the episode.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the end of}} , {{which had}} been used to launch UPN, they were seeking a new Star Trek series. The network {{contacted}} Rick Berman during the [...] of , and informed him that if he didn't develop a new Star Trek show then they would find someone else who would. Berman had previously been an executive producer on Voyager, and other series dating back to The Next Generation. Berman contacted Brannon Braga, and the two became the executive producers on the new show. The new series launched after the end of Voyager, but was set some 150 years before the events seen in The Original Series. The new series was originally called Enterprise, without the Star Trek prefix. UPN president Dean Valentine said that [...] "Paramount felt it was no longer necessary. Enterprise is synonymous with Star Trek". Berman's idea was to <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> an earlier time period, with limited technology such as the ship only being able to travel up to warp 5, as he felt that after three series being set in roughly the same time period it would be exciting for the fans.|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} and head writer Russell T Davies {{came up with}} the concept of [...] "The Unquiet Dead". As the third episode of the revived series, it was designed to continue to show the range of the programme by exploring the past, after the contemporary [...] "Rose" [...] and far-future [...] "The End of the World". The episode also reintroduces the TARDIS' habit of taking the Doctor to the wrong places, something that had not yet happened in the revived series. Davies felt that it was important for an episode to be set in Cardiff as that is where the new series is produced, and wanted the story to be set in Victorian times and feature Charles Dickens. Davies' original brief also included [...] "fake mediums", and Gatiss originally <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a [...] "spiritualist hotel", which had fake mediums (such as a character named Mrs Plumchute) on the lower floors and Mr Sneed on the top, though he was unaware he was a true medium. However, Gwyneth became a more popular character with the production team, and she took on much of the medium role. Gatiss was also more interested in possession and zombies. Mrs Sneed was another character that was cut out of the episode; Gatiss believed she was unnecessary as Gwyneth was the [...] "heart" [...] of the story.|$|E

500|$|The Guardian {{attempted}} to aggregate {{what they found}} to be polarised reviews of Imperial Bedrooms, noting that one Times reviewer felt the novel was simply dull, [...] "impoverished", and [...] "ghastly", whereas the London Review of Books felt {{that in spite of}} its flaws, the book was enjoyable for its [...] "beautiful one-liners" [...] and the fun of [...] "seeing the old Easton Ellis magic applied to the popular culture of our era ... iPhones, Apple stores, internet videos and Lost." [...] The New Statesman compiled reviews from The Independent, The Observer, and The New York Times. The first two reviews are positive, praising Ellis' [...] "modern noir", the book's [...] "atmosphere", and indebtedness to Philip Roth and F. Scott Fitzgerald, with the Observer saying it [...] "ranks with his best in the latter register [...]" [...] The latter review accused Ellis of falling flat, attracting negative comparison to Martin Amis; both have [...] "a flair for such perfect, surreal description" [...] but [...] "struggle to <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> an effective context." [...] Other writers attempting to gauge the book's reception also describe it as [...] "mixed". The Periscope Press deemed that the novel's reviews were mostly negative, citing Dr. Alison Kelly's article for The Guardian as the only counter-example, while deeming that it [...] "still read more like restrained criticism than outright praise".|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Lundgren {{directed}} {{and starred in}} the Mongolia-based action adventure, Diamond Dogs. Lundgren portrays the character of Xander Ronson, a mercenary hired {{by a group of}} American fortune hunters to act as their guide and bodyguard, while they search for a priceless Buddhist artifact deep within the Chinese wilderness. They get more than they bargained for, however, as they {{come face to face with}} Russian mercenaries also after the artifact. The film, a Canadian-Chinese production, was shot on location in Inner Mongolia. Later in 2007, Lundgren wrote, {{directed and}} starred in Missionary Man alongside Charles Solomon Jr.. Described as a [...] "modern western" [...] by Lundgren, He plays a lone, Bible-preaching stranger named Ryder who comes into a small Texas town on his 1970's Harley-Davidson motorcycle to attend the funeral of his good friend J.J., a local Native American carpenter, only to later get mixed up in a series of brawls with a local gang. According to Lundgren, it had long been a desire of his to direct a western, having long been a fan of Clint Eastwood and John Wayne, yet he did not want to spend the time and money building an old western town and hiring horses, so decided to <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> modern times with a motorbike instead of entering the town on a horse in the manner than Clint Eastwood would. Lundgren's co-writer, Frank Valdez's wife's brother happened to be a notable actor working in Texas and invited Lundgren's team to shoot there. The film was shot on location in Waxahachie, a southern suburb of Dallas and was produced by Andrew Stevens and it was specially screened at the 2008 AFI Dallas Film Festival.|$|E
