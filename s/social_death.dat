It deplored the Frenchified culture which had produced Claymoor, but {{also noted that}} his metaphorical style was being laughed at by the Belgian paper La Réforme. Yet, as Bacalbașa notes, Claymoor's writings made him [...] "a tiny celebrity": [...] "for 24 years Bucharest has had its Claymoor epoch." [...] According to the same source, Claymoor could describe [...] "wonderfully and competently the ladies' full attire at the various soirées that he attended. Some claimed that [...] was being paid by luxury seamstresses, but this was never proven true." [...] Reportedly, subscribing to L'Indépendence Roumaine and [...] "only reading Claymoor's notebook therein" [...] was a central preoccupation for girls just out of boarding school. According to Crutzescu: [...] "not being cited by Claymoor [...] was a catastrophe, an insult that equated <b>social</b> <b>death.</b> Which is why Claymoor's home was always full of diverse gifts, from ladies who wished not to be forgotten, or overlooked." [...] Văcărescu's recommendations were such [...] "that all fashionable society would adopt both the seamstress and the attire." ...|$|E

6000|$|As {{for that}} {{breathing}} {{in the wrong place}} which is known as dropping one's aitches, I found that in the long time between the first and last of my English sojourns, there had arisen the theory that it was a vice purely cockney in origin, and that it had grown upon the nation through the National Schools. It is grossly believed, or boldly pretended, that till the National School teachers had conformed to the London standard in their pronunciation the wrong breathing was almost unknown in England, but that now it was heard everywhere south of the Scottish border. Worse yet, the teachers in the National Schools had scattered far and wide that peculiar intonation, that droll slip or twist of the vowel sounds by which the cockney alone formerly proclaimed his low breeding, and the infection is now spread as far as popular learning. Like the wrong breathing, it is <b>social</b> <b>death</b> [...] "to any he that utters it," [...] not indeed that swift extinction which follows having your name crossed by royalty from the list of guests at a house where royalty is about to visit, but a slow, insidious malady, which preys upon its victim, and finally destroys him after his life-long struggle to shake it off. It is even worse than the wrong breathing, and is destined to sweep the whole island, where you can nowhere, even now, be quite safe from hearing a woman call herself [...] "a lydy." [...] It may indeed be the contagion of the National School teacher, but I feel quite sure, from long observation of the wrong breathing, that the wrong breathing did not spread from London through the schools, but was everywhere as surely characteristic of the unbred in England as nasality is with us. Both infirmities are of national origin and extent, and both are individual or personal in their manifestation. That is, some Americans in every part of the Union talk through their noses; some Englishmen in every part of the kingdom drop their aitches.|$|E

60|$|The picture still progressed up in Mrs. Dobbs Broughton's room, and {{the secret}} was still kept, or {{supposed}} to be kept. Miss Van Siever was, at any rate, certain {{that her mother had}} heard nothing of it, and Mrs. Broughton reported from day to day that her husband had not as yet interfered. Nevertheless, there was in these days a great gloom upon the Dobbs Broughton household, so much so that Conway Dalrymple had more than once suggested to Mrs. Broughton that the work should be discontinued. But the mistress of the house would not consent to this. In answer to these offers, she was wont to declare in somewhat mysterious language, that any misery coming upon herself was matter of moment to nobody,--hardly even to herself, as she was quite prepared to encounter moral and <b>social</b> <b>death</b> without delay, if not an absolute physical demise; as to which latter alternative, she seemed to think that even that might not be so far distant as some people chose to believe. What was the cause of the gloom over the house neither Conway Dalrymple nor Miss Van Siever understood, and to speak the truth Mrs. Broughton did not quite understand the cause herself. She knew well enough, no doubt, that her husband came home always sullen, and sometimes tipsy, and that things were not going well in the City. She had never understood much about the City, being satisfied with an assurance that had come to her in early days from her friends, that there was a mine of wealth in Hook Court, from whence would always come for her use, house and furniture, a carriage and horses, dresses and jewels, which latter, if not quite real, should be manufactured of the best sham substitute known. Soon after her brilliant marriage with Mr. Dobbs Broughton, she had discovered that the carriage and horses, and the sham jewels, did not lift her so completely into a terrestrial paradise as she had taught herself to expect that they would do. Her brilliant drawing-room, with Dobbs Broughton for a companion, was not an elysium. But though she had found out early in her married life that something was still wanting to her, she had by no means confessed to herself that the carriage and horses and sham jewels were bad, and it can hardly be said that she had repented. She had endeavoured to patch up matters with a little romance, and then had fallen upon Conway Dalrymple,--meaning no harm. Indeed, love with her, as it never could have meant much good, was not likely to mean much harm. That somebody should pretend to love her, to which pretence she might reply by a pretence of friendship,--this was the little excitement which she craved, and by which she had once flattered herself that something of an elysium might yet be created for her. Mr. Dobbs Broughton had unreasonably expressed a dislike to this innocent amusement,--very unreasonably, knowing, as he ought to have known, that he himself did so very little towards providing the necessary elysium by any qualities of his own. For a few weeks this interference from her husband had enhanced the amusement, giving an additional excitement to the game. She felt herself to be a woman misunderstood and ill-used; and to some women there is nothing so charming as a little mild ill-usage, which does not interfere with their creature comforts, with their clothes, or their carriage, or their sham jewels; but suffices to afford them the indulgence of a grievance. Of late, however, Mr. Dobbs Broughton had become a little too rough in his language, and things had gone uncomfortably. She suspected that Conway Dalrymple was not the only cause of all this. She had an idea that Mr. Musselboro and Mrs. Van Siever had it in their power to make themselves unpleasant, and that they were exercising this power. Of his business in the City her husband never spoke to her, nor she to him. Her own fortune had been very small, some couple of thousand pounds or so, and she conceived that she had no pretext on which she could, unasked, interrogate him about his money. She had no knowledge that marriage of itself had given her the right to such interference; and had such knowledge been hers she would have had no desire to interfere. She hoped that the carriage and sham jewels would be continued to her; but she {{did not know how to}} frame any question on the subject. Touching the other difficulty,--the Conway Dalrymple difficulty,--she had her ideas. The tenderness of her friendship had been trodden upon and outraged by the rough foot of an overbearing husband, and she was ill-used. She would obey. It was becoming to her as a wife that she should submit. She would give up Conway Dalrymple, and would induce him,--in spite of his violent attachment to herself,--to take a wife. She herself would choose a wife for him. She herself would, with suicidal hands, destroy the romance of her own life, since an overbearing, brutal husband demanded that it should be destroyed. She would sacrifice her own feelings, and do all in her power to bring Conway Dalrymple and Clara Van Siever together. If, after that, some poet did not immortalize her friendship in Byronic verse, she certainly would not get her due. Perhaps Conway Dalrymple would himself become a poet in order that this might be done properly. For it must be understood that, though she expected Conway Dalrymple to marry, she expected also that he should be Byronically wretched after his marriage on account of his love for herself.|$|E

5000|$|The chief {{proponent of}} the {{relationship}} between <b>social</b> <b>death</b> and slavery is Orlando Patterson, who states his findings in his 1982 book, Slavery and Social Death: A Comparative Study. Patterson first defines slavery as “one of the most extreme forms of the relation of domination, approaching the limits of total power from the viewpoint of the master, and of total powerlessness from the viewpoint of the slave.” [...] <b>Social</b> <b>death</b> had both internal and external effects on enslaved people, changing their views of themselves and the way they were regarded by society. Slavery and <b>social</b> <b>death</b> can be linked in all civilizations where slavery existed, including China, Rome, Africa, Byzantium, Greece, Europe, and the Americas.|$|E
50|$|The {{beginning}} of <b>social</b> <b>death</b> {{comes from the}} initial enslavement process, which would most likely come from capture during a battle.

40|$|ObjectivesThe Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database {{has been}} linked to the <b>Social</b> Security <b>Death</b> Master File to verify “life status” and {{evaluate}} long-term surgical outcomes. The objective of this study is explore practical applications of the linkage of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database to <b>Social</b> Securtiy <b>Death</b> Master File, including the use of the <b>Social</b> Securtiy <b>Death</b> Master File to examine the accuracy of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons 30 -day mortality data. MethodsOn January 1, 2008, the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database began collecting Social Security numbers in its new version 2. 61. This study includes all Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database records for operations with nonmissing Social Security numbers between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2010, inclusive. To match records between the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database and the <b>Social</b> Security <b>Death</b> Master File, we used a combined probabilistic and deterministic matching rule with reported high sensitivity and nearly perfect specificity. ResultsBetween January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2010, the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database collected data for 870, 406 operations. Social Security numbers were available for 541, 953 operations and unavailable for 328, 453 operations. According to the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database, the 30 -day mortality rate was 17, 757 / 541, 953  =  3. 3 %. Linkage to the <b>Social</b> Security <b>Death</b> Master File identified 16, 565 cases of suspected 30 -day deaths (3. 1 %). Of these, 14, 983 were recorded as 30 -day deaths in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons database (relative sensitivity =  90. 4 %). Relative sensitivity was 98. 8 % (12, 863 / 13, 014) for suspected 30 -day deaths occurring before discharge and 59. 7 % (2120 / 3551) for suspected 30 -day deaths occurring after discharge. ConclusionsLinkage to the <b>Social</b> Security <b>Death</b> Master File confirms the accuracy of data describing “mortality within 30 days of surgery” in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons and <b>Social</b> Security <b>Death</b> Master File link reveals that capture of 30 -day deaths occurring before discharge is highly accurate, and that these in-hospital deaths represent the majority (79 % [13, 014 / 16, 565]) of all 30 -day deaths. Capture of the remaining 30 -day deaths occurring after discharge is less complete and needs improvement. Efforts continue to encourage Society of Thoracic Surgeons Database participants to submit Social Security numbers to the Database, thereby enhancing accurate determination of 30 -day life status. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons and <b>Social</b> Security <b>Death</b> Master File linkage can facilitate ongoing refinement of mortality reporting...|$|R
