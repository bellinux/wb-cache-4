40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of {{different}} radiative transfer schemes on the properties of 3 D simulations of near-surface stellar convection in the <b>superadiabatic</b> <b>layer,</b> where energy transport transitions from fully convective to fully radiative. We employ two radiative transfer schemes that fundamentally differ in the way they cover the 3 D domain. The first solver approximates domain coverage with moments, while the second solver samples the 3 D domain with ray integrations. By comparing simulations that differ only in their respective radiative transfer methods, we are able to isolate the effect that radiative efficiency has on the structure of the <b>superadiabatic</b> <b>layer.</b> We find the simulations to be in good general agreement, but they show distinct differences in the thermal structure in the <b>superadiabatic</b> <b>layer</b> and atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|The {{response}} of solar models to perturbations of {{the efficiency of}} convective energy transport is studied {{for a number of}} cases. Such perturbations primarily effect the shallow <b>superadiabatic</b> <b>layer</b> of the convective envelope (at depth of approx. 1000 km below the photosphere). Independent of the details of the perturbation scheme, the resulting change in the solar radius is always very small compared to the change in luminosity. This appears to be true for any physical mechanism of solar variability which operates in the outer layers of the convection zone. Changes of the solar radius have been inferred from historical observations of solar eclipses. Considering the constraints on concurrent luminosity changes, this type of solar variability must be indicative of changes in the solar structure at substantial depths below the <b>superadiabatic</b> <b>layer</b> of the convective envelope...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine how}} {{metallicity}} affects convection and overshoot in the <b>superadiabatic</b> <b>layer</b> of main sequence stars. We present {{results from a}} grid of 3 D radiation hydrodynamic simulations with four metallicities (Z= 0. 040, 0. 020, 0. 010, 0. 001), and spanning a range in effective temperature (4950 < T_ eff < 6230). We show that changing the metallicity alters properties of the convective gas dynamics, {{and the structure of}} the <b>superadiabatic</b> <b>layer</b> and atmosphere. Our grid of simulations show that the amount of superadiabaticity, which tracks the transition from efficient to inefficient convection, is sensitive to changes in metallicity. We find that increasing the metallicity forces the location of the transition region to lower densities and pressures, and results in larger mean and turbulent velocities throughout the superadiabatic region. We also quantify the degree of convective overshoot in the atmosphere, and show that it increases with metallicity as well. Comment: Accepted for publication in Ap...|$|E
40|$|Two {{cases of}} the most severe bora episodes along the Adriatic coast of Croatia are investigated. In the first case of 29 January 1994 the {{absolute}} maximum gust of 48. 5 m s- 1 was recorded in Split.

Although in both cases the bora onset is caused by a frontal passage, the maximal local speeds occur afterwards and coincide with a pronounced short period pressure perturbation. Both cases were characterized by the temporal occurrence of the well marked <b>superadiabatic</b> <b>layers</b> in the low troposphere.

40|$|The {{calculation}} of the thermal stratification in the <b>superadiabatic</b> <b>layers</b> of stellar models with convective envelopes is a long-standing problem of stellar astrophysics, and has {{a major impact on}} predicted observational properties such as radius and effective temperature. The mixing length theory, almost universally used to model the <b>superadiabatic</b> convective <b>layers,</b> contains one free parameter to be calibrated (αml) whose value controls the resulting effective temperature. Here we present the first self-consistent stellar evolution models calculated by employing the atmospheric temperature stratification, Rosseland opacities, and calibrated variable αml (dependent on effective temperature and surface gravity) from a recently published large suite of three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations of stellar convective envelopes and atmospheres for solar stellar composition. From our calculations (with the same composition of the radiation hydrodynamics simulations), we find that the effective temperatures of models with the hydro-calibrated variable αml (that ranges between ~ 1. 6 and ~ 2. 0 in the parameter space covered by the simulations) present only minor differences, by at most ~ 30 – 50 K, compared to models calculated at constant solar αml (equal to 1. 76, as obtained from the same simulations). The depth of the convective regions is essentially the same in both cases. We also analyzed the role played by the hydro-calibrated T(τ) relationships in determining the evolution of the model effective temperatures, when compared to alternative T(τ) relationships often used in stellar model computations. The choice of the T(τ) can have a larger impact than the use of a variable αml compared to a constant solar value. We found that the solar semi-empirical T(τ) by Vernazza et al. (1981, ApJS, 45, 635) provides stellar model effective temperatures that agree quite well with the results with the hydro-calibrated relationships...|$|R

We build stellar models and compute the seismic signal expected from main sequence objects in the 0. 8 - 1. 6 Msun range. We first evaluate apparent magnitudes and oscillations-induced luminosity fluctuations expected in the Hyades, the Pleiades and the alpha Persei clusters. The closest cluster presents a feasible challenge to observational asteroseismology in the present and near future. We combine seismological and classical computations to address three questions: what can be inferred about 1) mass, 2) composition and 3) extension of outer convection zones of solar analogs in the Hyades. The first issue relies on the strong sensitivity of the large separation to mass. Then large separations and second differences are used to respectively constrain metal and helium fractions in the Hyades. When plotted for several masses, the relation of effective temperature vs large separation is found to be strongly dependent on the metal content. Besides this the second difference main modulation is related to the second ionization of helium. The second difference modulations are also partly due to the discontinuity in stellar stratification at the convective envelope / radiative core transition. They permit direct insight in the stellar structure. We compute acoustic radii of the convective bases for different values of the mixing length theoryparameter alpha_MLT in convection modelling, i. e. different convective efficiency in the <b>superadiabatic</b> <b>layers.</b> For a given effectivetemperature we show that the acoustic radius changes with convection efficiency...|$|R

The mechanism of flux expulsion by convective cells can concentrate magnetic flux up to the equipartition field strength, which is only about 200 G at the solar surface for the observed granular convection. Other mechanisms that partially evacuate the flux tube are needed to produce further concentration of magnetic flux to the observed values of 1000 - 1500 G.

40|$|The Monte Carlo {{code for}} the {{physically}} correct tracing of photons in cloudy atmospheres (MYSTIC) three-dimensional radiative transfer model {{was used in}} a parametric study to determine the strength of longwave radiative heating and cooling in atmospheres enclosed in idealized valleys and basins. The parameters investigated included valley or basin shape, width, and near-surface temperature contrasts. These parameters were varied for three different representative atmospheric temperature profiles for different times of day. As a result of counterradiation from surrounding terrain, nighttime longwave radiative cooling in topographic depressions was generally weaker than over flat terrain. In the center of basins or valleys with widths exceeding 2 km, cooling rates quickly approached those over flat terrain, whereas the cooling averaged over the entire depression volume was still greatly reduced. Valley or basin shape had less influence on cooling rates than did valley width. Strong temperature gradients near the surface associated with nighttime inversion and daytime <b>superadiabatic</b> <b>layers</b> over the slopes significantly increased longwave radiative cooling and heating rates. Local rates of longwave radiative heating ranged between 230 (i. e., cooling) and 90 K day 21. The effects of the near-surface temperature gradients extended tens of meters into the overlying atmospheres. In small basins, the strong influence of nocturnal near-surface temperature inversions could lead to cooling rates exceeding those over flat plains.

Periods and growth rates are computed for oscillatory modes arising in a simple two-layer model umbra.

Model atmosphere computations employ parameter choices different from what is used in stellar interior modelling, raising {{the question of whether}} a single MLT flavour and mixing length value can be used to compute interiors and atmospheres of stars of all types.

We build stellar models and compute the seismic signal expected from main sequence objects in the 0. 8 - 1. 6 M⊙ range. We first evaluate apparent magnitudes and oscillations-induced luminosity fluctuations expected in the Hyades, the Pleiades and the α Persei clusters. The closest cluster presents a feasible challenge to observational asteroseismology in the present and near future. The remainder of the work therefore focuses on the Hyades. We combine seismological and classical computations to address three questions: what can be inferred about 1) mass; 2) composition; and 3) extension of outer convection zones of solar analogs in the Hyades. The first issue relies on the strong sensitivity of the large separation to mass. We show that seismic constraints provide masses to a precision level (0. 05 M ⊙) that is competitive with the actual mass estimations from binary systems. Then large separations (Δv) and second differences (δ 2 v) are used to respectively constrain metal and helium fractions in the Hyades. When plotted for several masses, the relation of effective temperature (Teff) vs. large separation (Δv) is found to be strongly dependent on the metal content. Besides this the second difference main modulation is related to the second ionization of helium. An accuracy in the helium mass fraction of 0. 02 to 0. 01 can be achieved provided mass and age are accurately known, which is the case for a few Hyades binary systems. The second difference modulations are also partly due to the discontinuity in stellar stratification at the convective envelope/radiative core transition, They permit direct insight in the stellar structure.

This motion, which is driven by the granulation, takes place in a time approximately half the turnover time of the largest granules; The main reason for the radically different radiative-convective behaviour in Procyon A compared to the Sun is the role played by turbulent eddies in determining the overall flow/thermal structure. The turbulent pressure and turbulent kinetic energy can exceed 50 % of the local gas pressure (compared to about 10 - 20 % in the Sun). The Procyon A simulation thus reveals two distinct timescales - the autocorrelation time of the vertical velocity and the characteristic timescale of the SAL which is tied to granulation. Just below the surface the autocorrelation decay time is about 5 minutes in Procyon A, and the SAL motion timescale is 20 - 30 mins. When the SAL penetrates the optically thin region there are efficient radiative losses and the peak of the SAL is low. We speculate that these losses damp out the relative amplitudes in luminosity (temperature fluctuations) compared to velocity (Doppler). Although this will not affect the frequencies of the peaks in the power spectrum, it will probably lower the average amplitude of the peaks relative to the noise background.

40|$|In {{interacting}} binaries, {{comparison of}} a donor star's radial response to mass loss with {{the response of}} its Roche radius determines whether mass loss persists and, if so, determines the timescale and stability of the ensuing evolutionary phase. For giants with deep convective envelopes, the canonical description holds that once mass transfer begins it typically proceeds catastrophically on the dynamical timescale, as the star cannot lose sufficient heat {{in order to avoid}} expansion. However, we demonstrate that the local thermal timescale of the envelope's <b>superadiabatic</b> outer surface <b>layer</b> remains comparable to that of mass loss in most cases of "dynamical" mass loss. We argue therefore that if mass loss proceeds on a timescale longer than this, then even a deep convective envelope will not dramatically expand, as the surface layer will have time to relax thermally and reconstitute itself. We demonstrate that in general the polytropic approximation gives much too strict a criterion for stability, and discuss the dependence of the donor's response on its radius in addition to its core mass. In general, we find that the effective response of the donor on rapid timescales cannot be determined accurately without detailed evolutionary calculations. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures, 1 table.

40|$|We compare a new 3 D {{radiative}} hydrodynamical {{simulation of}} the surface layers of Procyon A to a similar 3 D simulation {{of the surface}} layers of the Sun. Both simulations include realistic input physics and are performed using the same numerical techniques and computer codes. Convection in the surface layers of Procyon A {{is very different from}} the Sun. Compared with the Sun, the atmospheric structure and convective flow in Procyon A exhibit the following characteristics. (i) The highly <b>superadiabatic</b> transition <b>layer</b> (SAL) is located at a much shallower optical depth; it is in a dynamically active region and its outer region is sometimes located in the optically thin atmosphere. (ii) The outer region of the SAL moves from an optically thin region to a thick region and back again over a time of 20 - 30 min. This motion, which is driven by the granulation, takes place in a time approximately half the turnover time of the largest granules. (iii) The peak rms velocity in the vertical direction is much larger in Procyon A. The main reason for the radically different radiative-convective behaviour in Procyon A compared with the Sun is the role played by turbulent eddies in determining the overall flow/thermal structure. The turbulent pressure and turbulent kinetic energy can exceed 50 per cent of the local gas pressure (compared with about 10 - 20 per cent in the Sun). In such regions, the mixing lengthy theory is a poor approximation. The Procyon A simulation thus reveals two distinct time-scales: the autocorrelation time of the vertical velocity and the characteristic time-scale of the SAL, which is tied to granulation. Just below the surface, the autocorrelation decay time is about 5 min in Procyon A and the SAL motion time-scale is 20 - 30 min. In the simulations, the peak value of the superadiabaticity varies between 0. 5 and 3. When the SAL penetrates the optically thin region, there are efficient radiative losses and the peak of the SAL is low. We speculate that these losses damp out the relative amplitudes in luminosity (temperature fluctuations) compared with velocity (Doppler). Although this will not affect the frequencies of the peaks in the power spectrum, it will probably lower the average amplitude of the peaks relative to the noise background...|$|R
40|$|The general {{consensus}} is {{that in order to}} reproduce the observed solar p-mode oscillation frequencies, turbulence should be included in solar models. However, there is no well-tested efficient method to incorporate turbulence into solar modeling. We present two methods to include turbulence in solar modeling within the framework of mixing length theory, using the turbulent velocity obtained from numerical simulations of the highly <b>superadiabatic</b> <b>layer</b> of the sun at three stages of its evolution. The first approach is to include the turbulent pressure alone, and the second is to include both the turbulent pressure and the turbulent kinetic energy. The latter is achieved by introducing two turbulent variables, the turbulent kinetic energy per unit mass and the effective ratio of specific heats due to the turbulent perturbation. These are treated as additions to the standard thermodynamic coordinates (e. g. pressure, temperature). We test these two methods by investigating the effect of different treatments of turbulence on the adiabatic sound speed and the p-mode frequencies. We find that only the second method can reproduce the observed data. This is because the effects of the turbulent pressure are much less than that of turbulent kinetic energy (and turbulent entropy).
