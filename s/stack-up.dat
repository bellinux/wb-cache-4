40|$|In recent years, {{projected}} capacitance {{has become}} {{by far the}} most used method of touchscreen sensing in the consumer electronics industry. Touch screen panels (TSPs) consist of varying transparent layers of lens, substrate, adhesive and indium-tin-oxide (ITO) electrodes. ITO has become the material of choice for manufacturing TSPs due to its high conductivity and high transparency. A touch is detected when there is a change in mutual capacitance between transmitting and receiving electrodes embedded the touch-screen. As a core feature in all aspects of modern electronics, there is a constant need to reevaluate and customize existing designs. Utilizing computer simulations allows a designer to predict the behavior of a design without building the physical sensor. Simulations have 3 main uses for touch-screen developers. (1) Building and testing new prototype designs, (2) optimization of existing designs and (3) testing the linearity and uniformity of existing designs due to vendor process variation. This thesis asks the questions: “What key metrics characterize a good TSP?” and “How can TSP designs be optimized using computer simulations?” This thesis contains a literature review of recent simulation approaches and review of the rise of projected capacitance technology in the touch-screen industry. The main focus of this thesis is the electrostatic simulation of touch-screen sensors. The relevant physics of electromagnetism is introduced and the dominant mathematical methods of simulation are reviewed and compared - namely the Finite Element Method (FEM) and the Method of Moments (MOM). Both these methods are used in experimental studies. The operation of a typical sensor and the mechanism of mutual capacitance is explained and accompanied by an equivalent circuit diagram. Important features of sensor design are introduced such as typical patterns, <b>stack-ups,</b> and trace routes. Simulations produce a capacitance matrix. From this matrix critical parameters which characterize sensor performance are derived such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and change in mutual capacitance (ΔCm). Several experimental studies of contrasting pattern designs and <b>stack-ups</b> are conducted in order to demonstrate optimization of touch-screen designs. Within each simulation, features of the design are paramaterized in order to perform parametric sweeps. These sweeps can include layer thickness, relative permittivity of a layer, sensor pitch and size of a specific geometric feature. In each case, several parameters of the design are varied and the effect on the capacitances are recorded. From these values the critical parameters of the sensor are determined along with the overall performance of the sensor. A design-of-experiments (DOE) methodology is also described in order to demonstrate the optimal simulation for a touch-screen design with an exhaustive number of variable parameters. This thesis also examines some of the implications of limited computational resources and its effect on solution time and convergence. Methods of decreasing the computational load will also be discussed. In summary, this body of work serves as a complete guide in the designing, running and analysis of electromagnetic simulations for modern TSPs...|$|R
40|$|We {{focus on}} the design of systems where memory {{performance}} is the principal bottleneck. Two kinds of systems have been considered, an FFT engine for use in high performance DSP systems and forwarding engines used in high-speed routers. The FFT engine was designed using Seamless High Off-Chip Connectivity (SHOCC), a high-density interconnect and packaging technology. The SHOCC substrate was analyzed for different substrate <b>stack-ups</b> to determine the I/O bandwidth attainable by the technology. The FFT engine was designed to make full use of this available bandwidth. It provides for rotation of data to maintain a constant stride between stages, ensuring a constant data access pattern between different stages of the FFT. Data is twiddled before storing in memory, and an efficient scheduling algorithm allows generation of twiddle factors on-chip in parallel with other operations. The memory controller uses a novel memory-mapping scheme to avoid precharge and refresh penalties in DRAMs and achieves SRAM-like access speeds. Forwarding engines in IP routers need to perform a longest-matching-prefix search on the routing database. Two types of forwarding schemes are presented, a hardware-implementable trie based scheme and software implementations of modified binary searches. The hardware trie-based scheme uses a small amount of on-chip SRAM along with an off-chip DRAM (which stores the complete forwarding table). Only a single DRAM access is required to determine the next hop address. The binary search schemes store an additional field in the forwarding database to avoid any backtracking while searching for prefixes...|$|R
40|$|The under bump {{metallurgy}} (UBM) {{structure is}} {{a critical component of}} any solder interconnect system. The UBM typically provides three functions: adhesion to underlying dielectric and metal, barrier to protect the silicon circuitry, and a solder wettable surface. For lead-free solder bumps, the barrier layer is key to reliability due to their higher Sn content. A common barrier layer used in the industry is electroplated nickel. This layer provides good protection from degradation of the silicon metallurgy by tin rich lead free solders. Controlled Collapse Chip Connection - New Process (C 4 NP) provides an opportunity to eliminate electroplating, and its associated costs for plating chemistry, analysis, supply and waste treatment. This paper analyzes electroless Ni/immersion Au (ENIG), with and without Pd, as an alternative UBM structure. Wafers were fabricated with these UBM structures, solder applied with C 4 NP, and chip level stressing performed to determine the robustne ss of these alternative <b>stack-ups.</b> Analysis of these structures following multiple reflows and thermal cycling is presented. In addition, the paper also reviews production cost analysis for various UBM stackups and solder bump processes, based on a specifically developed cost model. The ENIG UBM structures in combination with C 4 NP solder bumping provide a significant cost reduction over alternative structures. C 4 NP is a unique solder bumping technology developed by IBM which addresses the limitations of existing bumping technologies by enabling low-cost, fine pitch bumping using a variety of lead-free solder alloys. It is a solder transfer technology where molten solder is injected into pre-fabricated and reusable glass molds. The glass mold contains etched cavities which mirror the bump pattern on the wafer.

40|$|Rotorcraft {{structures}} do {{not readily}} {{lend themselves to}} quantifiable inspection methods due to airframe construction techniques. Periodic visual inspections are a common practice for detecting corrosion. Unfortunately, when the telltale signs of corrosion appear visually, extensive repair or refurbishment is required. There {{is a need to}} nondestructively evaluate airframe structures in order to recognize and quantify corrosion before visual indications are present. Nondestructive evaluations of rotorcraft airframes face inherent problems {{different from those of the}} fixed wing industry. Most rotorcraft lap joints are very narrow, contain raised fastener heads, may possess distortion, and consist of thinner gage materials ({approximately} 0. 012 [...] 0. 125 inches). In addition the structures involve <b>stack-ups</b> of two and three layers of thin gage skins that are separated by sealant of varying thickness. Industry lacks the necessary data techniques, and experience to adequately perform routine corrosion inspection of rotorcraft. In order to address these problems, a program is currently underway to validate the use of eddy current inspection on specific rotorcraft lap joints. Probability of detection (POD) specimens have been produced that simulate two lap joint configurations on a model TH- 57 / 206 helicopter. The FAA's Airworthiness Assurance Center (AANC) at Sandia Labs and Bell Helicopter have applied single and dual frequency eddy current (EC) techniques to these test specimens. The test results showed enough promise to justify beta site testing of the eddy current methods evolved in this study. The technique allows users to distinguish between corrosion signals and those caused by varying gaps between the assembly of skins. Specific structural joints were defined as prime corrosion areas and a series of corrosion specimens were produced with 5 [...] 20 % corrosion distributed among the layers of each joint. Complete helicopter test beds were used to validate the laboratory findings. This paper will present the laboratory and field results that quantify the EC technique's corrosion detection performance. Plans for beta site testing, adoption of the new inspection procedure into routine rotorcraft maintenance, and NDI training issues will also be discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} faster, {{portable}} and reliable electronic devices is increasing {{the pressure on}} the development of assembly techniques for signal integrity (SI). The advance of integrated circuits toward a large number of Input/Output (I/Os), a high number of operations and up to microwave communication frequencies, is behind the drive for the search for new packaging solutions. The materials and assembly techniques have an important impact on the propagation of high speed signals. Signal integrity issues emerge due to the electrical losses of materials, reflections from impedance discontinuities in the signal path and fast transitions of the signals. For these reasons, signal integrity in lead-free connections of WLCSP, flip chip (FC) and Integrated Module Board (IMB) assemblies were investigated up to 50  GHz. The increase of conductor loss resulting from the presence of thick oxide layers on the surface of solder bumps of hot running components was experimentally studied for the first time. Utilizing theoretical calculations, a design rule was developed to account for the 40  % increase in losses due to the presence of oxide layers at high frequencies. The research into the influence of solder microstructure on signal quality showed that it did not negatively affect the wave propagation. Experimental results proved that the presence of underfills and high density routing on printed wiring boards (PWBs) under the WLCSP components, detuned the components and the connections. The effects of three different underfills on signal propagation were studied. It was proven that the changes resulting from the rheology and parameters of curing process influence the losses and reflections of circuits. The analysis of microwave performances of flip chip (FC) and Integrated Module Board (IMB) assembly techniques demonstrated that they are well suited to Radio frequency (RF) and high speed applications. Comparison showed that IMB performed better as the wave encountered smaller discontinuities and had an optimized propagation path. Full wave simulations of IMB assemblies were performed considering finite ground coplanar waveguide (FGCPW), microstrip and stripline connections with <b>stack-ups</b> that included high dielectric constant materials and four connection possibilities. The research was carried out in the domains of both frequency and time to rigorously determine the sources of signal reflections.

40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyThe present work {{investigates the}} effect of the bending loads on the {{wellhead}} systems and predicts the response of the conductor with the introduction of CAN™ (Conductor Anchor Node) and Seabed BOP Supporter. Performance of the wellhead and conductor system is dependent on field design parameters. These parameters can include local environmental loading, drilling rig motions, marine riser <b>stack-ups</b> and BOP (Blow-out Preventer) configuration and soil conditions. These loads may cause severe damage to the wellhead system. In order to reduce {{the effect of}} these loads, the possibility of incorporating other components such as the CAN™ and Seabed BOP Supporter can be considered. The present work aims at introducing the mentioned CAN™ and Seabed BOP Supporter in the wellhead system and assessing their influence on the bending moment response of the conductor. This has been analyzed considering different load cases outlined below. Load Case 1 : The analysis was carried out considering a conventional drilling mode with a 30 ” wellhead system, drilling riser and a BOP system. Load Case 2 : The analysis was performed considering Wellhead system with BOP and drilling riser supported in a CAN™ foundation developed by NeoDrill AS. Load Case 3 : The analysis also considers Seabed BOP Support in addition to the CAN™. The Seabed BOP Supporter is located in between CAN™ and BOP. The purpose of a Sea bed BOP supporter is to transfer pre-set part of BOP weight directly to CAN™ and to counteract riser induced BOP moments on Wellhead. 3 -D FE (Finite Element) model based on PIPE element was established for the mentioned three load cases. The analyses have been performed by considering various factors that include internal axial casing load, external load from BOP, drilling riser tension, foundation soil support stiffness, and the cement level within the annulus of the conductor and surface casing. The shear loads that occur when the well is configured for drilling operations are applied at the lower flex joint over a range from - 490 kN to + 490 kN. The results from the analysis are discussed against the two criteria established to assess the structural integrity of the wellhead conductor. These criteria are: allowable bending capacity of the conductor and limiting flex joint rotation angles. The results show that the introduction of CAN™ and Seabed BOP Supporter influences the response for bending moment of Wellhead conductor considerably. The results further conclude that the reduction in the bending moment of the conductor is in the order of 25 % and 80 % due to introduction of CAN™ and Seabed BOP Supporter in the wellhead system, respectively...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{the causes}} and effects of {{dimensional}} and geometric variation {{is a major concern}} in the design and manufacturing of products. Geometry assurance is a generic name for different activities with the aim to secure the quality of the company’s geometry definition and verification process, which includes both virtual and physical processes. Methodology and support for a robust design, simulation and visualization of variation is important {{to be able to make}} the product as insensitive to manufacturing variation as possible. It is important to have an internal overall picture of the geometry process to become more effective and achieve higher quality on the products and an efficient manufacturing process. To be more competitive in the market Volvo Aero has launched the concept of Make it light. This design objective is partly met by fabrication, i. e. designing products with an increased number of subparts. Fabrication leads to new/increased demands on the ability to break down geometrical requirements to subparts and to be able to sum up the expected variation from subparts to a top level to assess producibility/quality. It is important to be able to take control of geometrical variation in an early stage of product development, and this requires new tools and working methods. Volvo Aero is currently developing several products that will enter into service in the near future, and several other product development projects are in the planning. When this happens, and production volume increase, the number of deviations might increase many times compared to the present levels according to internal estimations. This will result in increased cost of poor quality (non-conformance handling, tied up material and scrap). This thesis work has through analysis, of Volvos GDP (Global Development Process) and Geometry Assurance processes in the automotive industry, worked towards a description on how this method can be used at Volvo Aero. An interview study was made to be able to form a description of how the Geometry Assurance process could be visualized today. Suggestions of improvements of today’s Geometry Assurance process was discussed and visualized through a future Geometry Assurance process, which shows the possibilities for what Volvo Aero could achieve. Through the studies and the interviews it became quite clear that improvements regarding handling and visualizing variation is something that is needed at Volvo Aero. A case was used to show the possibilities of improvements with a method to analyze and visualize stability, contribution of locating points, variation envelope and <b>stack-ups,</b> this all in 3 D environment, which could be implemented early into the design process. The recommendations are that Volvo Aero should implement the suggested Geometry Assurance process, because it is a good way of visualizing the working process and highlights problem/improvement areas for further discussions. The process is in line with Volvo Aero’s current strategy regarding producibility and fabrication. A 3 D visualization stability and variation simulation tool should be acquired since it shows a lot of potential of minimizing deviations and creating a better connection between tolerance chains and the 3 D model. The tool is also most likely to improve the efficiency of the Product Development process, because of the few hours it takes to perform the analysis. If the Geometry assurance process and a 3 D visualization tool are implemented at Volvo Aero, future work is needed regarding easy access and search ability of capability data and Geometry Assurance process support for the projects etc. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis, focused on {{cognitive}} sensor monitoring of machining processes for zero defect manufacturing, has been addressed {{within the framework}} of the international research project EC FP 7 CP-IP “IFaCOM – Intelligent Fault Correction and self Optimizing Manufacturing systems” (2011 - 2015; FoF NMP – 285489) and the national MIUR PON Project on “Development of eco-compatible materials and technologies for robotised drilling and assembly processes – STEP FAR” (2014 - 2016). The vision of the IFaCOM project is to achieve near zero defect level of manufacturing with particular emphasis on the production of high value, large variety and high performance products. This goal is achieved through the development of improved methodologies for monitoring and control of the performance of manufacturing processes with the aim to detect abnormal process conditions leading to defects on the produced parts. The overall aim of the STEP FAR project is the study of issues related to drilling and cutting techniques of advanced lightweight components, such as composite material parts, and their relative assembly, using cooperating anthropomorphic robots. The use of innovative materials and processes developed in this research will lead to a reduction in weight and environmental impact in the construction and maintenance of primary aircraft structures. At least a 5 % reduction in weight of the structures is foreseen without increase of costs (a possible rise in the cost of raw materials is compensated with the reduction of process costs). In aeronautical industry the reduction of the weight of the aircraft is becoming an increasingly important aim both for environmental requirements (lower emissions) and contraction of the management costs (lower fuel consumption). Therefore new structural architectures through the use of innovative materials and technologies have been developed. One of the innovative processes analysed in this project is the drilling via machining of carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) <b>stack-ups.</b> In the framework of these projects, this thesis work is focused on the development of cognitive condition monitoring procedures for zero defect machining processes with reference to two different industrial manufacturing applications. The thesis is organized as follows: Chapter 2 reviews the general concept of sensor monitoring of manufacturing processes and provides a comprehensive survey of sensor technologies, advanced signal processing techniques, sensor fusion approach, and cognitive decision making strategies for process monitoring. In Chapter 3, the Strecon industrial case, as a partner of the IFaCOM project, is discussed and analysed. The STRECON end-user case is focused on improving repeatability and predictability of the surface finish produced by a Robot Automated Polishing (RAP) process. In order to establish a robust method for the detection of the polishing process end-point, i. e. the determination of the right moment for tool and abrasive paste change, STRECON sensor system selection focuses on monitoring the progress of the surface quality during the polishing process by means of variation in VQCs (Vital Quality Characteristics), i. e. roughness and gloss of the polished surface. The output data have been used to train a neural network. The employed NN learning procedure was the leave-k-out method where k cases from the training set are put aside in turn, while the other cases are used for NN training. In Chapter 4, the Alenia Aermacchi industrial case, as coordinator and partner of the STEP FAR project, is discussed and analysed. The Alenia Aermacchi user case is based on the analysis of drilling of stacks made of two overlaid carbon fibre reinforced plastic composite laminates. In this case, a neural network based cognitive paradigm based on a bootstrap procedure has been used for the identification of correlations with tool wear development and product hole quality. Finally, Chapter 5 reports the concluding remarks and future developments of this work...|$|R
