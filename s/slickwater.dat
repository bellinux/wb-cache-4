50|$|The main {{purposes}} of fracturing fluid are to extend fractures, add lubrication, change gel strength, and to carry proppant into the formation. There are two methods of transporting proppant in the fluidhigh-rate and high-viscosity. High-viscosity fracturing tends to cause large dominant fractures, while high-rate (<b>slickwater)</b> fracturing causes small spread-out micro-fractures.|$|E
50|$|Other than proppant, <b>slickwater</b> {{fracturing}} fluids {{are mostly}} water, generally 99% or more by volume, but gel-based fluids can see polymers and surfactants comprising {{as much as}} 7 vol% , ignoring other additives. Other common additives include hydrochloric acid (low pH can etch certain rocks, dissolving limestone for instance), friction reducers, guar gum, biocides, emulsion breakers, emulsifiers, and 2-Butoxyethanol.|$|E
50|$|With {{the success}} of {{hydraulic}} fracturing, {{also referred to as}} <b>slickwater</b> fracturing, as a means of economically recovering unconventional gas reserves, use of polymeric friction reducers has become widespread. Polyacrylamides are used for their drag reducing properties on water to decrease frictional pressure losses, thereby maximizing bottom hole injection pressures allowing for a higher pressure from the same number of pump trucks.|$|E
50|$|A type of the {{fracking}} {{technique called}} <b>slickwater</b> fracking {{was used in}} Texas in 1998 to complete natural gas wells in the Barnett Shale. This type of completion {{was made possible by}} a number of advances in directional drilling and microseismic 3-dimensional imaging supported by the Department of Energy and other federal agencies, Drilling into shale now accounts for 30 percent of US gas production.|$|E
50|$|Horizontal oil or gas wells were unusual {{until the}} late 1980s. Then, {{operators}} in Texas began completing thousands of oil wells by drilling horizontally in the Austin Chalk, and giving massive <b>slickwater</b> hydraulic fracturing treatments to the wellbores. Horizontal wells proved much more effective than vertical wells in producing oil from tight chalk; sedimentary beds are usually nearly horizontal, so horizontal wells have much larger contact areas with the target formation.|$|E
50|$|The {{fracturing}} fluid {{varies depending on}} fracturing type desired, and the conditions of specific wells being fractured, and water characteristics. The fluid can be gel, foam, or slickwater-based. Fluid choices are tradeoffs: more viscous fluids, such as gels, are better at keeping proppant in suspension; while less-viscous and lower-friction fluids, such as <b>slickwater,</b> allow fluid to be pumped at higher rates, to create fractures farther out from the wellbore. Important material properties of the fluid include viscosity, pH, various rheological factors, and others.|$|E
50|$|The {{combination}} of horizontal drilling and multistage hydraulic fracturing was pioneered in Texas’ Austin Chalk {{play in the}} 1980s. Stephen Holdich, head of the Department of Petroleum Engineering at Texas A&M University, commented: “In fact, the Austin Chalk is the model for modern shale development methods.” The Austin Chalk play started in 1981 with vertical wells, but died with {{the decline in the}} oil price in 1982. In 1983, Maurer Engineering designed the equipment to drill the first medium-range horizontal well in the Austin Chalk. Horizontal drilling revived the play by increasing production, and lengths of the horizontal parts of the wellbores grew with greater experience and improvements in drilling technology. Union Pacific Resources, since absorbed by Anadarko Petroleum, entered the Austin Chalk play in a major way in 1987, and drilled more than a thousand horizontal wells in the Austin Chalk, with multistage massive <b>slickwater</b> hydraulic fracture treatments, making major improvements in drilling and fracturing techniques.|$|E

Mitchell has been called the [...] "father of fracking" [...] because of his role in applying it in shales. The first horizontal well in the Barnett Shale was drilled in 1991, but was not widely done in the Barnett until it was demonstrated that gas could be economically extracted from vertical wells in the Barnett.|$|E
50|$|For <b>slickwater</b> fluids {{the use of}} sweeps is common. Sweeps are {{temporary}} {{reductions in}} the proppant concentration, which help ensure that the well is not overwhelmed with proppant. As the fracturing process proceeds, viscosity-reducing agents such as oxidizers and enzyme breakers are sometimes added to the fracturing fluid to deactivate the gelling agents and encourage flowback. Such oxidizer react with and break down the gel, reducing the fluid's viscosity and ensuring that no proppant is pulled from the formation. An enzyme acts {{as a catalyst for}} breaking down the gel. Sometimes pH modifiers are used to break down the crosslink {{at the end of a}} hydraulic fracturing job, since many require a pH buffer system to stay viscous. At the end of the job, the well is commonly flushed with water under pressure (sometimes blended with a friction reducing chemical.) Some (but not all) injected fluid is recovered. This fluid is managed by several methods, including underground injection control, treatment, discharge, recycling, and temporary storage in pits or containers. New technology is continually developing to better handle waste water and improve re-usability.|$|E
30|$|Creation of {{openings}} in the reservoir rock involves pumping fracturing fluids into the wellbore at elevated flow rates and pressures. The viscosity of a fracturing fluid has a remarkable effect on the fracture initiation and the final size of the fracture (Kalgaonkar and Patil 2012). The main component of low-viscosity fracturing fluids is water and low concentrations of polymer ranging from 0.25 to 10  lb per thousand gallons (Bunger et al. 2013; Palisch et al. 2010). In the last decade, an amazing shift from traditional gel-based fracturing fluids toward using <b>slickwater</b> has occurred. Because of the relatively low viscosity of <b>slickwater,</b> cleanup problems and damage associated with using viscous fluids are minimized, which makes <b>slickwater</b> suitable for fracturing low-permeability reservoirs (Wu et al. 2013; Palisch et al. 2010). As a result of lower viscosity, <b>slickwater</b> cannot suspend and transport proppants as effectively as gelled fluids. To overcome poor proppant transport, higher pumping rates are applied, which in turn leads to significant energy loss due to friction and turbulence in the tubular pipeline (Palisch et al. 2010; Kaufman et al. 2008). In order to lower the surface pumping pressures and compensate for the energy losses during pumping, {{a small amount of}} high molecular weight polymer is dissolved in the fluid, which acts as a drag reducer. In <b>slickwater</b> treatments, friction reducer is a significant component of the fluid. Long, flexible chain polyacrylamide-based polymers are known to be the most effective drag reduction polymers (Kim et al. 1998).|$|E
30|$|The {{effect of}} {{fracture}} conductivity on CO 2 -EOR performance needs further investigation due to proppant being transported limited distances {{away to the}} dominant fractures in <b>slickwater</b> fracture treatments. A modeling case study of the Barnett shale gas well hydraulic fracturing treatment with Formation mechanical properties illustrates the propagation process of complex hydraulic fracture networks (Xu et al. 2010). Proppant settles very quickly near the wellbore due to the low viscosity of <b>slickwater.</b> (The viscosity of <b>slickwater</b> is low {{so it is not}} able to carry the sand long distances). However, the settling velocity of 100 mesh sands is slower than 40 / 70 mesh sands. The 100 mesh sands tend to be transported further from the wellbore and placed in the secondary fracture networks. The chance that the proppant is evenly distributed in the fracture networks is small (Warpinski et al. 2008; Warpinski 2009). The Bakken field fracturing observations reported that the 20 / 40 mesh sand was transported to distances of 2200 ft away at the offset wells with cross-linked fluids. With <b>slickwater</b> fracturing, the radioactive traced 40 / 70 mesh sand was identified at a distances of 500 ft (Warpinski et al. 2008). Laboratory and field applications indicate that the distances that particles will be transported is a function of fracturing fluid viscosity, slurry rate and particle sizes. A lower slurry rate is designed to create larger fracture width and spacing. Similarly, experimental results also demonstrate that a low injection rate has a greater chance of increasing the complexity of fracture networks and interconnecting more natural fractures (Wang and Miskimins 2010).|$|E
30|$|The {{viscosity}} of {{a fracture}} fluid affects the width and length {{profile of the}} created fracture {{as well as the}} proppant distribution in the fracture. In most designs, moderate or high viscosity fluids are used because of their ability to create sufficient fracture width and proppant carrying capacity. The use of low viscosity fluids such as <b>slickwater</b> is the predominant trend because of their low cost and availability.|$|E
40|$|As a {{new type}} of {{fracturing}} fluid, supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO 2) has now become the research hotspot in domestic and foreign academia. However, the relevant technique is limited by the unclear sand-carrying mechanism. In this study, the concept of following performance is introduced to investigate the sand-carrying performances of fracturing fluid; the following performance of proppant and the sand-carrying performance of fracturing fluid are characterized by the ratio of the proppant horizontal velocity to the fracturing-fluid horizontal flow velocity. Then the following performance of proppant is used as the criteria for evaluating the horizontal sand-carrying performances of SC-CO 2. Based on the classic BBO equation, the expression of drag force has been modified; in combination with the auxiliary equations of drag force coefficients, a calculation model has also been established to analyze the following performance of proppant in SC-CO 2, which provides the theoretical foundation for evaluating and optimizing the transportation of proppant in SC-CO 2. To verify the correctness of the model, an experiment is conducted on the following performance of proppant using the self-developed equipment, and then the factors that affect the following performance of proppant in SC-CO 2 are analyzed. The results show that the following perfomance of proppant is slightly affected within the common range of density, which is consistent with the previous experimental results. In addition, a comparative analysis is performed on the following performance of sands in SC-CO 2, <b>slickwater</b> and air. The analysis results indicate that the sand-carrying performance of SC-CO 2 is more affected by its high-density property but less affected by its low viscosity. Because of high-density and low-viscosity properties, SC-CO 2 is far better than air but worse than or approximately equal with <b>slickwater</b> in terms of sand-carrying performances. Especially at a high flow velocity, the horizontal sand-carrying performance of SC-CO 2 is comparable to that of <b>slickwater.</b> ...|$|E
30|$|Since {{recipes for}} {{fracking}} fluids are normally tailored to specific reservoirs, the hazard potentials of each fluid {{need to be}} assessed site-specifically. Based on the assessment method described in the Methods section, we have assessed the two fluids used to date in shale gas and CBM reservoirs in Germany as two examples. Planned improvements of fracking fluids were taken into account by assessing two fluids mentioned by an operator as potentially being suitable for shale gas reservoirs and, possibly, CBM reservoirs (improvements of <b>slickwater</b> and gel fluids) [4].|$|E
30|$|In this work, {{we focus}} on {{studying}} the DR behavior and shear stability of anionic HPAM/XG binary polymer solution. Anionic PAM is the partially hydrolyzed form of polyacrylamide with more flexibility and relatively large molar mass. Both polymers are widely used in industrial applications such as <b>slickwater</b> treatments. There has been little or no work regarding the DR behavior of anionic HPAM and XG mixtures. We believe {{that it would be}} interesting to verify the DR behavior of two negatively charged molecules coexisting in a solution. Since various HPAM and XG molecules with different molecular weights are available in the market, we also study the behavior of single polymer solutions, so that we can compare them with binary solutions and assess the degree of improvement in shear stability.|$|E
40|$|Horizontal {{drilling}} and <b>slickwater</b> hydrofracturing have enabled shale gas {{to become a}} significant contributor to the United States ’ energy supply. Hydrofracturing typically requires 2 MM – 6. 5 MM gallons of water per shale gas well.

In addition to high salinity and hardness levels (Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba), much Marcellus produced water also contains significant levels of naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM), particularly radium.

30|$|Information on fluid volumes was {{available}} {{for a total of}} 30 fracking fluids used in various unconventional reservoirs (and in one conventional reservoir) in Germany between 1982 and 2011. Most of the reservoirs in which the fluids were injected were tight gas reservoirs in Lower Saxony. The quantities used varied considerably, {{depending on the type of}} fracking fluid and the characteristics of the reservoirs. The quantities of fracking fluids used per frac ranged from less than 100  m 3 to more than 4, 000  m 3. With the modern gel fluids used since 2000, an average of about 100  t of proppants and about 7.3  t of additives (of which usually less than 30  kg were biocides) were injected per frac. The quantities used can be quite large especially with multi-frac stimulations and/or use of <b>slickwater</b> fluids: for example, a total of about 12, 000  m 3 of water, 588  t of proppants, and 20  t of additives (of which 460  kg were biocides) were injected into the “Damme 3 ” borehole in three frac operations in 2008.|$|E
40|$|Friction {{reducers}} {{are essential}} additives used to economically achieve the high pumping rates required for <b>slickwater</b> fracturing. Decreased friction reducer performance in high-TDS brines {{has been a}} major challenge for reusing produced water in hydraulic fracturing. Little work has been done to identify the specific parameters that affect polymeric friction reduction. This research uses friction flow loop experiments to characterize the performance of partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide friction reducers in conditions relevant to the oil field. Polymer concentration and degree of hydrolysis effects on friction reduction are evaluated in the ranges of 0. 25 - 2 gpt and 0 - 30 %, respectively. The decrease in friction reducer performance is measured in brines up to 120, 000 mg/L TDS with varying multivalent cation concentrations. The friction reducer interactions with Na+, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Fe 3 +, and Al 3 + ions are individually assessed. The results are compared to experiments with a commercial friction reducer, and used to propose an empirical model to predict friction reducer performance based on water composition...|$|E
30|$|Partially hydrolyzed {{polyacrylamide}} (HPAM) as {{the main}} component of <b>slickwater</b> fracturing fluid is a shear-sensitive polymer, which suffers from mechanical degradation at turbulent flow rates. Five different concentrations of HPAM as well as mixtures of polyacrylamide/xanthan gum were prepared to investigate the possibility of improving shear stability of HPAM. Drag reduction (DR) measurements were performed in a closed flow loop. For HPAM solutions, the extent of DR increased from 30 % to 67 % with increasing HPAM concentration from 100 to 1000  wppm. All the HPAM solutions suffered from mechanical degradation and loss of DR efficiency over the shearing period. Results indicated that the resistance to shear degradation increased with increasing polymer concentration. DR efficiency of 600  wppm xanthan gum (XG) was 38 %, indicating that XG was not as good a drag reducer as HPAM. But with only 6 % DR decline, XG solution exhibited a better shear stability compared to HPAM solutions. Mixed HPAM/XG solutions initially exhibited greater DR (40 % and 55 %) compared to XG, but due to shear degradation, DR% dropped for HPAM/XG solutions. Compared to 200  wppm HPAM solution, addition of XG did not improve the drag reduction efficiency of HPAM/XG mixed solutions though XG slightly improved the resistance against mechanical degradation in HPAM/XG mixed polymer solutions.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Recent {{domestic}} {{growth in}} oil and gas natural gas production from shales and sandstones called “tight” formations—largely enabled by a modified technology called <b>slickwater</b> hydraulic fracturing—has driven both economic growth and environmental concerns. Public concerns have often focused on the chemicals used in the fracturing process, yet federal regulations requiring disclosure of chemicals are weak. In the midst of initial “threats” of federal intervention, industry—along with state regulators—developed a website that enabled chemical disclosure. State regulations later mandated disclosure through this website, or allowed it as one option within a mandatory disclosure regime. Independently, gas companies also have begun to experiment with less toxic fracturing chemicals and to take other substantive efforts toward identifying and limiting the risks of tight oil and gas development. This example of a public-private effort to enhance informational access in fracturing, and to make limited substantive changes, may offer important lessons for other oil and gas regulation moving forward. Agencies and policymakers must make independent assessments of risks and avoid directly adopting industry solutions if those solutions are incomplete or avoid needed change. But oil and gas operators have shown how public action, combined with industry coordination and innovation, can sometimes inspire productive responses to the risks of unconventional oil and gas production...|$|E
40|$|Water {{shortage}} {{has been}} a challenge in developing hydraulic fracturing in drought-affected areas such as South (Eagle Ford) and West (Permian Basin) Texas. Non-potable groundwater is a potential alternative to fresh water in making hydraulic fracture fluids. The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the technical feasibility of using non-potable waters from the Southern Carrizo-Wilcox aquifer to make hydraulic fracturing fluids in the Eagle Ford play. The first phase of the research is to compare fracture fluid compositional requirements with the water compositions of the Southern Carrizo-Wilcox aquifer by searching through literature, manufacturer?s, and service company?s specifications. The second phase of the research is to evaluate the performance of two different types of fracture fluids using synthetic saline water in the laboratory. Two major lab experiments will be conducted: (1) using a flow loop system to test for friction reducer performance in <b>slickwater</b> and (2) performing viscosity measurements and ?lipping gel? experiments for crosslinked gel performance. After completing literature reviews and laboratory evaluations, a conclusion of the technical feasibility of using non-potable groundwater to make these fracture fluids can be derived. This research will demonstrate the possibility of eliminating the use of fresh water by utilizing the available abundant non-potable groundwater from the Southern Carrizo-Wilcox aquifer in hydraulic fracturing...|$|E
40|$|After fluid {{injection}} (<b>slickwater)</b> during hydraulic fracturing, the flow-back of fracture fluid {{is necessary}} before gas production starts. A review of fracture treatments {{indicates that the}} incomplete return of treating fluids is {{a reason for the}} failure of hydraulic fracturing and is associated with poor gas production. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the parameters that limit flow-back in low permeability gas wells in the Cooper Basin. The authors used numerical simulation to find the critical controlling parameters to introduce the best practice for maximising the flow-back in the Cooper Basin. Several 3 D and multiphase flow simulation models were constructed for three wells in the Patchawarra Formation during fracture fluid injection, soaking time and during flow-back. All models were validated using history matching with the production data. The results show that the drainage pattern is distinctly different in the following directions: vertically upward, vertically downward, and horizontal along the fracture half-length and along the matrix. The lowest recovery is observed during the upward vertical displacements due to poor sweep efficiency. Furthermore, it is observed that drawdown does not influence the recovery significantly for upward displacements. Surface tension reduction, however, can improve sweep efficiency and improve recovery considerably. Also, the wettability of the rocks has a significant impact on ultimate recovery when the effect of gravity is dominant. The authors conclude that a significant amount of injected fluid is trapped in the formation because of poor sweep efficiency and formation of gas fingers, which results from low mobility ratio and gravity segregation.

40|$|In recent years, great {{progress}} has been made in geologic evaluation, engineering test and development optimization of the Lower Cambrian Wufeng Fm–Lower Silurian Longmaxi Fm shale gas in the Sichuan Basin, and the main shale gas exploitation technologies have been understood preliminarily. In addition, scale productivity construction has been completed in Jiaoshiba, Changning and Weiyuan blocks. In this paper, the Wufeng Fm–Longmaxi Fm shale gas wells in Changning Block were taken as the study object to provide technical reference for the development design of similar shale-gas horizontal wells. The technology combining geology with engineering, dynamic with static, and statistical analysis with simulation prediction was applied to quantify the main factors controlling shale-gas well productivity, develop the shale-gas well production prediction model, and optimize the key technical parameters of geologic target of shale-gas horizontal wells in the block (e. g. roadway orientation, location and spacing, horizontal section length and gas well production index). In order to realize high productivity of shale gas wells, it is necessary to maximize the included angle between the horizontal section orientation and the maximum major stress and fracture development direction, deploy horizontal-well roadway in top-quality shale layers, and drill the horizontal section in type I reservoirs over 1000  m long. It is concluded that high productivity of shale gas wells is guaranteed by the horizontal-well wellbore integrity and the optimized low-viscosity <b>slickwater</b> and ceramsite fracturing technology for complex fracture creation. Based on the research results, the technical policies for shale gas development of Changning Block are prepared and a guidance and reference are provided for the shale gas development and productivity construction in the block and the development design of similar shale-gas horizontal wells...|$|E
40|$|The water {{leak-off}} during {{hydraulic fracturing}} in shale gas reservoirs {{is a complicated}} transport behavior involving thermal (T), hydrodynamic (H), mechanical (M) and chemical (C) processes. Although many leak-off models have been published, none of the models fully coupled the transient fluid flow modeling with heat transfer, chemical-potential equilibrium and natural-fracture dilation phenomena. In this paper, a coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical (THMC) model based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics, hydrodynamics, thermo-poroelastic rock mechanics, and non-isothermal chemical-potential equations is presented to simulate the water leak-off process in shale gas reservoirs. The THMC model takes into account a triple-porosity medium, which includes hydraulic fractures, natural fractures and shale matrix. The leak-off simulation with the THMC model involves all the important processes in this triple-porosity medium, including: (1) water transport driven by hydraulic, capillary, chemical and thermal osmotic convections; (2) gas transport induced by both hydraulic pressure driven convection and adsorption; (3) heat transport driven by thermal convection and conduction; and (4) natural-fracture dilation considered as a thermo-poroelastic rock deformation. The fluid and heat transport, coupled with rock deformation, are described {{by a set of}} partial differential equations resulting from the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. The semi-implicit finite-difference algorithm is proposed to solve these equations. The evolution of pressure, temperature, saturation and salinity profiles of hydraulic fractures, natural fractures and matrix is calculated, revealing the multi-field coupled water leak-off process in shale gas reservoirs. The influences of hydraulic pressure, natural-fracture dilation, chemical osmosis and thermal osmosis on water leak-off are investigated. Results from this study are expected to provide {{a better understanding of the}} predominant leak-off mechanisms for <b>slickwater</b> fracturing-fluids in hydraulically fractured shale gas reservoirs...|$|E
30|$|Results {{showed that}} the {{viscosity}} and injection rate of the fracturing fluid had important influences on the fracture propagation and penetration. Appropriate viscosity and injection rate could ensure large vertical fracture propagation height and formation of complex fracture networks in the coal seam. When the viscosity or injection rate of the fracturing fluid was too small, leakage would occur along the weak plane, forming multiple fractures, which is not conducive to fracture height. When the viscosity or injection rate of the fracturing fluid was too high, a single fracture was formed and the stimulated reservoir volume would be smaller. In the stimulated coalbed gas well, {{in order to reduce}} the formation damage caused by high-viscosity guanidine gum fracturing fluid, low-viscosity <b>slickwater</b> or clean fracturing fluid was used. However, for coal seams with well-developed natural fractures, low-viscosity fracturing fluid may easily cause leakage, thus forming multiple fractures hampering the main fracture propagation, also inducing tip screening out. Xiao et al. (2013, 2017) improved the anti-filtration and sand carrying capacity of the fracturing fluid by incorporating biodegradable fiber material in the active water fracturing fluid and fracturing stimulation of the coalbed methane well was enhanced as a result. Therefore, in the process of co-fracturing of a tight sandstone–coal interbedded reservoir, the method of mixed fracturing can be used. In the initial stage of fracturing, a high-viscosity fracturing fluid (such as cleaning fracturing fluid) is used to form a wide main fracture, reducing the complexity of the near-wellbore fracture and improving the effect of fracture penetration; then a biodegradable fiber active water fracturing fluid is used in the coal seam to effectively improve the communication of hydraulic fractures and natural fractures, and at the same time to reduce the amount of filtration, and to improve fracture growth propagation, so as to optimize the fracture morphology. In addition, due to higher breakdown pressure in the sandstone layer, optimization of perforation parameters in advance is needed in order to reduce operation difficulty.|$|E
40|$|In the United States, Congress has {{traditionally}} relied, in part, upon citizen participation to control industrial activity {{and its effects}} on public welfare. It has also required industry to disclose certain information to the public in order to enable this participation. Early on in the movement toward expanded federal regulation of industry, Congress granted broad standing to individuals in generous “private attorney general” provisions in environmental and business-related statutes. It also required agencies to follow strict notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures, which directed agencies to publicize proposed rules and receive citizen comments. Through statutes such as the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) and the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), Congress further mandated that industry publish information about releases of toxic materials and that public water providers disclose violations of water quality standards. These statutes all envisioned that informed citizens would influence industrial activity through open public venues. But a recent revolution in energy development – inspired by a new technique to extract natural gas from shale – called <b>slickwater</b> hydraulic fracturing (fracing) – does not fall squarely within traditional venues for public disclosure and participation. In September 2010, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) took one step toward the “publicization” of fracing when it sent a letter to nine natural gas companies, requiring that they disclose to the agency the chemicals used in fracing in order to support a comprehensive EPA study of the potential drinking water quality and public health impacts of fracing. Although this administrative action appears to open a door to public access to information veiled by trade secrets, it is not currently clear that natural gas companies will promptly disclose the requested information – as shown by Halliburton’s refusal to disclose information in response to the letter and a subsequent subpoena issued by EPA – or that the information will be publicly available. Unless Congress or state legislatures partially remove trade secret protections from fracing fluids, communities experiencing the brunt of the energy boom may have inadequate tools to evaluate and address the potential impacts of this development...|$|E
40|$|Multiphase and non-Darcy flow {{effects in}} {{hydraulically}} fractured gas wells reduce effective fracture conductivity. Typical proppant pack laboratory experiments are oriented {{in such a}} way such that phase segregation is not possible, which results in mixed flow. Tidwell and Parker (1996), however, showed that in proppant packs, gravity segregation occurs for simultaneous gas and liquid injection at laboratory scale (1500 cm 2). Although the impact of gravity on flow in natural fractures has been described, previous work has not fully described the effect of gravity on multiphase non-Darcy flow in hydraulic fractures. In this work, reservoir simulation modeling was used to determine the extent and impact of gravity segregation in a hydraulic fracture at field scale. I found that by ignoring segregation, effective fracture conductivity can be underestimated by up to a factor of two. An analytical solution was developed for uniform flux of water and gas into the fracture. The solution for pressures and saturations in the fracture agrees well with reservoir simulation. Gravity segregation occurs in moderate-to-high conductivity fractures. Gravity segregation impacts effective fracture conductivity when gas and liquid are being produced at all water-gas ratios modeled above 2 Bbls per MMscf. More realistic, non-uniform-flux models were also run with the hydraulic fracture connected to a gas reservoir producing water. For constant-gas-rate production, differences in pressure drop between segregated cases and mixed flow cases range up to a factor of two. As the pressure gradient in the fracture increases above 1 to 2 psi/ft, the amount of segregation decreases. Segregation is also less for fracture half-length-to-height ratios less than or close to two. When there is less segregation, the difference in effective conductivity between the segregated and mixed flow cases is reduced. I also modeled the water injection and cleanup phases for a typical <b>slickwater</b> fracture treatment both with and without gravity effects and found that for cases with segregation, effective fracture conductivity is significantly higher than the conductivity when mixed flow occurs. Gravity segregation is commonly ignored in design and analysis of hydraulically fractured gas wells. This work shows that segregation is an important physical process and it affects effective fracture conductivity significantly. Hydraulic fracture treatments can be designed more effectively if effective fracture conductivity is known more accurately...|$|E
40|$|Despite all {{advantages}} of <b>slickwater</b> fracturing such as low cost, high possibility of creating complex fracture networks, {{and ease of}} clean-up, large quantities of water are still left within the reservoir after flowback. Invasion of aqueous fracturing fluids can reduce the relative permeability to gas and thereby cause a water blockage. Compared to conventional surfactants that lose activity after contacting the first few inches of the formation due to adsorption to the rock surface, microemulsions with advantage of having combined effect of microemulsion-forming surfactants and organic solvents, outperform pure organic solvent or pure surfactant when used independently. Microemulsions can provide maximum surface area of contact with the formation due to their structure and can increase penetration and cleaning efficiency. The research proposed in this study {{has been designed to}} assess the performance of microemulsions when it is used as an additive to the fracturing fluid to stimulate the gas bearing formations. Microemulsions formulated with a blend of anionic surfactant, nonionic surfactant, oil and water were used to prepare the microemulsion systems. The average size of the microemulsion-V droplet (as received) was detected by transmission electron micrographs (TEM). Microemulsions were tested to assess their efficiency in reducing the surface tension and in wettability alteration. Experiments were conducted using cores from an outcrop of Bandera sandstone to measure the effect of microemulsions on the gas permeability enhancements. The increase in gas permeability was quantified by comparing the relative gas permeability before and after treatment. The alteration of wettability after the chemical treatment was evaluated by measuring the contact angles between the treatment fluid and rock. Thermal stability tests were conducted using hot rolling cells for temperatures up to 400 ?F, which proved the high stability of microemulsions at high-temperature conditions. Microemulsions caused enhancement in the relative gas permeability, when compared to the mutual solvent, fluoropolymer surfactant, anionic, and non-ionic surfactant solutions. Microemulsions altered the wettability of water-wet rocks to less water-wet. Aging the shale rock particles in contact with different treatment solutions, showed an increase in the concentration of tested elements including Ca, Mg, Al, and Si in the solutions that can be an explanation of high total dissolved solid (TDS) in the flow back fluid after completion...|$|E
40|$|Use of high‐volume {{hydraulic}} fracturing (HVHF) in unconventional reservoirs to recover previously inaccessible {{oil and natural}} gas is rapidly expanding in North America and elsewhere. Although {{hydraulic fracturing}} has been practiced for decades, the advent of more technologically advanced horizontal drilling coupled with improved <b>slickwater</b> chemical formulations has allowed extensive natural gas and oil deposits to be recovered from shale formations. Millions of liters of local groundwaters are utilized to generate extensive fracture networks within these low‐permeability reservoirs, allowing extraction of the trapped hydrocarbons. Although the technology is relatively standardized, the geographies and related policies and regulations guiding these operations vary markedly. Some ecosystems are more at risk from these operations than others because of either their sensitivities or {{the manner in which the}} HVHF operations are conducted. Generally, the closer geographical proximity of the susceptible ecosystem to a drilling site or a location of related industrial processes, the higher the risk of that ecosystem being impacted by the operation. The associated construction of roads, power grids, pipelines, well pads, and water‐extraction systems along with increased truck traffic are common to virtually all HVHF operations. These operations may result in increased erosion and sedimentation, increased risk to aquatic ecosystems from chemical spills or runoff, habitat fragmentation, loss of stream riparian zones, altered biogeochemical cycling, and reduction of available surface and hyporheic water volumes because of withdrawal‐induced lowering of local groundwater levels. The potential risks to surface waters from HVHF operations are similar in many ways to those resulting from agriculture, silviculture, mining, and urban development. Indeed, groundwater extraction associated with agriculture is perhaps a larger concern in the long term in some regions. Understanding the ecological impacts of these anthropogenic activities provides useful information for evaluations of potential HVHF hazards. Geographic information system–based modeling combined with strategic site monitoring has provided insights into the relative importance of these and other ecoregion and land‐use factors in discerning potential HVHF impacts. Recent findings suggest that proper siting and operational controls along with strategic monitoring can reduce the potential for risks to aquatic ecosystems. Nevertheless, inadequate data exist to predict ecological risk at this time. The authors suggest considering the plausibility of surface water hazards associated with the various HVHF operations in terms of the ecological context and in the context of relevant anthropogenic activities.

40|$|In this Article, {{we argue}} that {{property}} theory, appropriately understood, shows that subsurface water, oil, and gas ought {{to be treated as}} shared property that can be exploited, {{if it is to be}} exploited at all, by the coordinating agreements of owners of the surface property, or their licensees, supervised by common law courts. We therefore offer the paradigm of shared property as the appropriate analysis for thinking about the law 2 ̆ 7 s approach to rights in oil and natural gas. We also argue that the shared property paradigm is largely consistent with the common law 2 ̆ 7 s approach to subsurface resource pools, even though conventional understanding of the law vacillates between the private property and commons property paradigms. Much of this Article is revisionist. We argue, unconventionally, that the common law embraced the paradigm of shared property in much of its regulation of subsurface resource pools because it essentially treated those resources as owned by tenants in common, as modified by the common law nuisance exception for injuries to subsurface resource pools. Under this reading, the special common law rules regarding subsurface resource pools have been misunderstood either as providing for (1) commons property treatment of subsurface resource pools underground followed by private property treatment after the resources are extracted from the subsurface pools or (2) private property treatment of the resources even while underground but subject to loss of title if the resources crossed property boundaries. Under our reading of the cases, when interpreted against the paradigm of shared property, the common law consistently recognized shared ownership of subsurface resource pools yet limited surface owner 2 ̆ 7 s rights to quiet enjoyment of subsurface resource pools based solely on courts 2 ̆ 7 own perceived incapacity, because the resources are hidden, to understand the causal relationship between land use and disruption of enjoyment of subsurface resource pools. But this limit did not prevent courts from coordinating the exploitation of subsurface resource pools between surface owners by * 1043 recognizing causes of action for malicious interference, waste, and unreasonable exploitation. This analysis supports our claim that the property issues inherent in today 2 ̆ 7 s concerns over horizontal <b>slickwater</b> fracturing can be addressed under private agreements that are subject to judicial supervision. Moreover, because we now have the seismic technology to understand resource location and flows, the common law 2 ̆ 7 s reluctance to provide common owners of shared property with an accounting should dissipate...|$|E
40|$|IC 3 G 2016 Challenge the Limits with Knowledge. Theme 3 : Shale gas {{extraction}} - Simulation of Hydraulic Fracturing with CO 2 Foam Using a Fracture Propagation Model Coupled with Geomechanics in a Shale Gas Reservoir from Cooper Basin, South AustraliaEnergized fluids have been previously used in hydraulic fracture treatment in depleted and low permeable gas reservoirs and {{have proven to}} be highly efficient to aid well cleanup as well as to minimize liquid retention effect and clay swelling. On the other hand, the Australian Cooper Basin has a very complex stress regime where high fracture gradients, high tortuosity induced fractures and high pressure dependent leakoff are commonly observed. Therefore, the application and optimisation of this technology in unconventional reservoirs of the Cooper Basin which needs to be adapted to counter these and reservoir effects. The Murteree and Roseneath shale formations in the Cooper Basin are 8, 500 ft in depth and have been targets for shale gas production by different oil and gas operators. In this paper, petrophysical evaluation of shale gas potential (Total Organic Carbon) from the Permian Murteree formation has been studied. Next, a geomechanical evaluation was carried out by generating a 1 D vertical mechanical earth modelling (MEM) to define the stress regime and the principle stresses variation which requires full-wave sonic logs and a diagnostic fracture injection test (DFIT) to construct and calibrate the model. A 3 D hydraulic fracture simulation in a vertical well was developed and validated with postfrac production data. Then, a sensitivity analysis was performed using a selection of different fracturing fluid treatments. In the fracture propagation model, a large number of cases were simulated based on different types of fracturing fluids. It was found that the foam quality could contribute to a higher fracture pressure. This is because higher viscosity of foam contributes to higher net pressure in the fracture by improved leakoff control, with greater proppant carrying capacity comparing with <b>slickwater</b> to increase fracture conductivity. Based on our reservoir inputs, the simulation results indicated that the optimum scenario is a foam quality of 70 % for both N 2 and CO 2 as it generates the maximum gas productivity. Modelling predictions support the expectation of long term productivity gains through the use of foams fracturing fluid. It is concluded that the use of foam results in a more rapid clean-up of the fracture itself and inside the wellbore, which is expected to provide higher productivity. Y. Fei, M.
