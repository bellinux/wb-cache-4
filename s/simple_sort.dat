500|$|Hex Enduction Hour takes {{influence}} from the Velvet Underground's [...] "Sister Ray", Captain Beefheart {{and the early}} 1970s Krautrock band Can. Smith {{has said that the}} title was intended to invoke witchcraft, that he concocted the word [...] "Enduction" [...] to suggest the album could be a listener's induction into the Fall and that [...] "Hex" [...] was a reference to this being the band's sixth release. His vocals are higher in the mix than on previous Fall releases and were described in 1982 by Sounds as [...] "emerg like a loudhailer from a fog of guitar scratch". The songs were deliberately produced in a raw and low-fi approach by Smith, Grant Showbiz and Richard Mazda in a sound described at the time as a [...] "well produced noise" [...] that was acceptable by Fall standards. Critic Mark Storace claimed that he [...] "could {{have done a better job}} on a 4-track if I was pissed out of my head". Smith responded by saying that [...] "nowadays people just can't just shut up if they don't know what they're talking about." [...] Elaborating on the purposely amateurish production values, Smith remarked that [...] "it was all recorded in deliberately bad places...deliberately <b>simple</b> <b>sort</b> of thing.

The very earliest birds {{seem to have been}} seabirds living upon fish, and their fore limbs were not wings but paddles rather after the penguin type. That peculiarly primitive bird, the New Zealand Ki-Wi, has feathers of a very <b>simple</b> <b>sort,</b> and neither flies nor appears to be descended from flying ancestors. In the development of the birds, feathers came before wings. But once the feather was developed the possibility of making a light spread of feathers led inevitably to the wing. We know of the fossil remains of one bird at least which had reptilian teeth in its jaw and a long reptilian tail, but which also had a true bird's wing and which certainly flew and held its own among the pterodactyls of the Mesozoic time. Nevertheless birds were neither varied nor abundant in Mesozoic times.

Napoleon, for instance, who had run over these Battles of Friedrich (apparently somewhat in haste, but always with a word upon them which is worth gathering from such a source), speaks thus of Leuthen: [...] "This Battle is a masterpiece of movements, of manoeuvres, and of resolution; enough to immortalize Friedrich, and rank him among the greatest Generals. Manifests, in the highest degree, both his moral qualities and his military." [...] [Montholon, [...] Memoires &c., de Napoleon, vii. 211.
