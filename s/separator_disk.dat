40|$|Buffet and flutter {{characteristics}} of Saturn Apollo mission were studied using a dynamically scaled model. The model was {{built around a}} central aluminum tube for scaled stiffness distribution and strength to resist loads imposed during testing. Styrofoam sections attached to the core provided the correct external contours. Lead weights were added for correct mass distribution. An electromagnetic shaker was used to excite the model in its flexible modes of vibration during portions of the test. The model was supported on a sting, mounted by leaf springs, cables and torsion bars. The support system provided for simulating the full scale rigid body pitch frequency with minimum restraint imposed on elastic deflections. Bending moments recorded by sensors on the aluminum tube. Several modified nose configurations were tested: The basic configuration was tested with and without a flow <b>separator</b> <b>disk</b> on the escape rocket motor, tests also were made with the escape tower and rocket motor removed completely. For the final test, the Apollo capsule was replaced with a Jupiter nose cone. The test program consisted of determining model response throughout the transonic speed range at angles of attack up to 6 degrees and measuring the aerodynamic damping over the same range for the basic model and the modified configurations. Signals from the model pickup were recorded on tape for later analysis. The data obtained were used to estimate bending moments that would be produced on the full-scale vehicle by aerodynamic forces due to buffeting...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of {{frequency}} on cleaning of various Hard Disk Drive (HDD) components. The disk drive components {{used for this study}} was aluminum metal spacer, e-coated <b>disk</b> <b>separator</b> and plastic separator. The frequency used for this study was 58 / 132 kHz, 132 kHz, 360 kHz, 470 kHz and 1 MHz. In this study multiple extraction method was used to find the cleanability and erodability of the parts and liquid particle counter was used to measure the particle concentration in the extracted solution. The result indicates that dual frequency i. e 58 / 132 kHz is more suitable for cleaning of aluminum metal spacer and e-coated <b>disk</b> <b>separator,</b> 360 kHz and 470 kHz is more suitable for cleaning of plastic <b>disk</b> <b>separator.</b> The result shows that 360 kHz is the supreme frequency for final rinsing. 360 kHz frequency also found to be a better washing and rinsing frequency for various HDD components. Cleaning the parts with multiple frequencies gives higher cleanabili...|$|R
40|$|Rotating <b>disks</b> <b>separators,</b> {{mounted on}} single and double hollow shafts, are {{investigated}} experimentally. The shaft and disks were enclosed in stainless steel housing. Many parameters were measured to study {{their influence on}} the performance of single and double shaft disk filters at various rotation speeds. These parameters are pressure inside the housing, permeate flux, and electrical power consumption. The average velocity coefficient ˜k for single and double shaft <b>disk</b> <b>separators</b> was estimated and was found to be a good criterion of module performance as well. The comparison of measured and calculated filtration flow rate at various rotation speeds was in a good agreement. The estimated average shear stress is found to be about twice in double shaft filter disk. The feasibility of double shaft <b>disk</b> <b>separator</b> in treating filtration without filter cake is highly appreciated. Copyright © 2008 Y. Taamneh and S. Ripperger.

50|$|The planar {{separator}} theorem may {{be proven}} {{by using the}} circle packing theorem to represent a planar graph as the contact graph {{of a system of}} disks in the plane, and then by finding a circle that forms a geometric <b>separator</b> for those <b>disks.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2005, Hengst {{founded the}} {{subsidiary}} companies Hengst of North America, Inc. in Camden, USA, and Hengst Filter Systems (Kunshan) Co., Ltd. in Kunshan, China. Around the same time, Hengst developed a multifunctional module with an integrated coolant pump. In 2008, the company launched a high-speed centrifuge for all performance classes on the market.Furthermore, the company opened its own day-care facility, Hengst Kinderland (Hengst Children’s Land) in 2008.In 2010, Hengst developed the Blue-Engine-Care System (BECS) modular system for engine optimization. This range spawned the Blue.tron, an electrical <b>disk</b> <b>separator,</b> in 2011, and in 2013, the fuel care system, Blue.maxx, was also launched. Hengst opened an engineering office in Bangalore, India in early 2013 {{in order to}} expand its worldwide presence. In 2014 the site in Singapore was founded. The site in Poland followed in May 2015.|$|R
40|$|The {{friction}} transmission {{model of}} wet clutch is established {{to analyze the}} friction transmission mechanism of its engagement. The model is developed by applying both the average flow model and the elastic contact model between the friction <b>disk</b> and <b>separator</b> plate. The key components during wet clutch engagement are the <b>separator</b> plate, friction <b>disk,</b> and lubricant. The one-dimension transient models of heat transfer in radial direction for the three components are built {{on the basis of}} the heat transfer theory and the conservation law of energy. The friction transmission model and transient heat transfer models are coupled and solved by using the Runge-Kutta numerical method, and the radial temperature distribution and their detailed parametric study for the three components are conducted separately. The simulation results show that the radial temperature for the three components rises with the increase of radius in engagement. The changes in engagement pressure, lubricant viscosity, friction lining permeability, combined surface roughness RMS, equivalent elasticity modulus, difference between dynamic and static friction coefficients, and lubricant flow have important influence on the temperature rise characteristics. The proposed models can get better understanding of the dynamic temperature rise characteristics of wet clutch engagement...|$|R
40|$|A trade study {{conducted}} in 2001 selected a rotary <b>disk</b> <b>separator</b> {{as the best}} candidate {{to meet the requirements}} for an International Space Station (ISS) Carbon Dioxide Reduction Assembly (CRA). The selected technology must provide micro-gravity gasfliquid separation and pump the liquid from 10 psia at the gasfliquid interface to 18 psia at the wastewater bus storage tank. The rotary disk concept, which has pedigree in other systems currently being built for installation on the ISS, failed to achieve the required pumping head within the allotted power. The separator discussed in this paper is a new design that was tested to determine compliance with performance requirements in the CRA. The drum separator and pump @SP) design is similar to the Oxygen Generator Assembly (OGA) Rotary Separator Accumulator (RSA) in that it has a rotating assembly inside a stationary housing driven by a integral internal motor. The innovation of the DSP is the drum shaped rotating assembly that acts as the accumulator and also pumps the liquid at much less power than its predecessors. In the CRA application, the separator will rotate at slow speed while accumulating water. Once full, the separator will increase speed to generate sufficient head to pump the water to the wastewater bus. A proof-of- concept (POC) separator has been designed, fabricated and tested to assess the separation efficiency and pumping head of the design. This proof-of-concept item was flown aboard the KC 135 {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the separator in a microgravity environment. This separator design has exceeded all of the performance requirements. The next step in the separator development is to integrate it into the Sabatier Carbon Dioxide Reduction System. This will be done with the Sabatier Engineering Development Unit at the Johnson Space Center...|$|R
