The ship models required multiple camera passes because {{different parts of}} the ship and its lights were filmed at different exposure levels. The Excelsior required eight passes to supplement the main [...] "beauty pass", the Enterprise six. ILM could have combined passes with multiple exposures, but not without risk; [...] "If anything got out of synch, or <b>somehow</b> <b>we</b> dropped a frame, we would have to reshoot—and then you're stuck.

Although I realized all the great things that had been accomplished largely because of the sacrifices made by so many people, I found myself wishing that <b>somehow</b> <b>we</b> could have done it another way." ...|$|E
500|$|Black Sabbath {{also had}} {{a huge impact on}} the band's sound, {{especially}} on the guitar riffs and tunings. Joel McIver stated: [...] "Soundgarden are one of the bands I've heard closest to the original Sabbath sound." [...] Soundgarden, like other early grunge bands, were also influenced by British post-punk bands such as Gang of Four and Bauhaus which were popular in the early 1980s Seattle scene. Cornell himself said: [...] "When Soundgarden formed we were post-punk – pretty quirky. Then <b>somehow</b> <b>we</b> found this neo-Sabbath psychedelic rock that fitted well with who we were." [...] Thayil described the band's sound as a [...] "Sabbath-influenced punk".|$|E

500|$|In February 2011, Isaacs {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Michael Britten, the central {{character}} of the series. Gordon summarized the character: [...] "He's a guy who goes to sleep, wakes up, he's with his wife, goes to sleep, wakes up, and he's with his son. [...] And so—and he's a cop who sees clues and details that crossover from one world to the next, and he uses that insight to solve crimes." [...] " [...] was somebody that you couldn't decide if you liked or hated, and I think that 's dilemma is something that we're not only sympathetic for, but <b>somehow</b> <b>we</b> want him to win."

However, Laura Allen {{was cast in}}stead; McManus obtained the role of Tara (for which Allen originally auditioned).|$|E
500|$|Attempts to find {{sources for}} the work in {{literature}} from the period have not been successful. Art historian Erwin Panofsky wrote in 1953 that, [...] "In {{spite of all the}} ingenious, erudite and in part extremely useful research devoted to the task of [...] "decoding Jerome Bosch", I cannot help feeling that the real secret of his magnificent nightmares and daydreams has still to be disclosed. We have bored a few holes through the door of the locked room; but <b>somehow</b> <b>we</b> do not seem to have discovered the key." [...] The humanist Desiderius Erasmus has been suggested as a possible influence; the writer lived in 's-Hertogenbosch in the 1480s, and it is likely he knew Bosch. Glum remarked on the triptych's similarity of tone with Erasmus's view that theologians [...] "explain (to suit themselves) the most difficult mysteries... is it a possible proposition: God the Father hates the Son? Could God have assumed the form of a woman, a devil, an ass, a gourd, a stone?" ...|$|E
500|$|Two {{months after}} the airing of the fourth season finale episode, co-showrunner and {{executive}} producer Robert Carlock was asked if Jack McBrayer's character Kenneth Parcell would return in the upcoming season after he was fired as an NBC page in [...] "I Do Do". Carlock said [...] "We haven't cracked [...] he is getting [...] back, {{but of course he}} will get back <b>somehow.</b> <b>We</b> wanted a fun thing to shuffle the deck a little bit and send him off into the world. Of course, he will miss it and he will be missed. Events will bring him back." [...] In [...] "The Fabian Strategy", Kenneth is now working at CBS as a page for the Late Show with David Letterman. The scene in which Kenneth throws himself in front of a car to prove to Tracy Jordan that he is real and not Tracy's imagination was filmed on August 27, 2010, in front of the Ed Sullivan Theater.|$|E

500|$|In February 2011, Jason Isaacs {{obtained}} {{the role of}} Michael Britten, the central character of the series.

[...] And so—and he's a cop who sees clues and details that crossover from one world to the next, and he uses that insight to solve crimes." [...] Killen thought that the premise behind the series would be relatable to audiences, making it easier to expand his fanbase. [...] "I think there were aspects of Lone Star that were more difficult to get a wider, broader audience interested in," [...] he articulated. [...] " [...] was somebody that you couldn't decide if you liked or hated, and I think that Britten's dilemma is something that we're not only sympathetic for, but <b>somehow</b> <b>we</b> want him to win."

500|$|After Duane's death, {{the band}} held {{a meeting on}} their future; clearly all wanted to continue, and after a short period, the band {{returned}} to the road. [...] "We all had this thing in us and Duane put it there. He was the teacher and he gave something to us—his disciples—that we had to play out," [...] said drummer Butch Trucks. The band returned to Miami in December to complete work on their third studio album. Completing the recording of Eat a Peach raised each member's spirits; [...] "The music brought life back to us all, and it was simultaneously realized by every one of us. We found strength, vitality, newness, reason, and belonging as we worked on finishing Eat a Peach," [...] said Allman. [...] "Those last three songs [...] just kinda floated right on out of us [...] The music was still good, it was still rich, and it still had that energy—it was still the Allman Brothers Band." [...] Released in February 1972, Eat a Peach was the band's second hit album, shipping gold and peaking at number four on Billboard Top 200 Pop Albums chart. [...] "We'd been through hell, but <b>somehow</b> <b>we</b> were rolling bigger than ever," [...] said Gregg Allman.|$|E
500|$|In August 2010, it was {{reported}} that Paramount Pictures and Marvel Studios were planning to start shooting in February. Simultaneously, it was declared that the film would be shot in 3D, although Mark Ruffalo later tweeted that this was not the case. In October 2010, Grumman Studios in Bethpage, New York and the Steiner Studios in Brooklyn, New York City, were announced as filming locations, with set construction slated to begin in November, but as Whedon later explained, [...] "Originally {{we were supposed to be}} in Los Angeles, then for a short period we were supposed to be in New York, and then <b>somehow</b> <b>we</b> ended up in Albuquerque." [...] Also that October, Walt Disney Studios agreed to pay Paramount at least $115million for the worldwide distribution rights to Iron Man3 and The Avengers. The deal also allowed Paramount to continue to collect the 8percent box office fee it would have earned for distributing the film and a marquee credit—placement of the company's production logo on marketing materials and the film's opening titles. As a result, the onscreen production credit reads [...] "Marvel Studios presents in association with Paramount Pictures" [...] though the film is solely owned, distributed, financed, and marketed by Disney. Paramount's Epix retained pay TV rights.|$|E

500|$|Before {{the release}} of Eat a Peach, {{industry}} talk suggested {{the demise of the}} group after the death of Duane Allman. The record's promotional campaign was coordinated by Dick Wooley, the former head of promotion for Atlantic Records. He had recently quit his position there and was contacted by Walden to help Capricorn in its efforts. (Capricorn Records had recently separated from Atlantic Records as well; Eat a Peach would be among the first Capricorn albums released under a new distribution deal with Warner Bros. Records.) [...] "They needed help because the buzz in the record business and on the street was that the ABB was finished as a band and would never survive without Duane," [...] said Wooley. After being played some songs from Eat a Peach by Sandlin, Wooley was [...] "blown away" [...] and accepted the offer at half his usual salary. He arranged to have the band's New Year's Eve performance at New Orleans' Warehouse live simulcast on radio. [...] "I took a gamble and cobbled together a network of radio stations in the Southeast via Ma Bell phone lines," [...] said Wooley. The stunt helped launch Eat a Peach, which was issued by Capricorn in February 1972 and became an instant success. The album shipped enough copies to be certified by the RIAA as gold and peaked at number four on Billboard Top 200 Pop Albums chart. [...] "We'd been through hell, but <b>somehow</b> <b>we</b> were rolling bigger than ever," [...] said Gregg Allman.|$|E
500|$|At the {{suggestion}} of manager Lenny Poncher and Hassinger, The Electric Prunes agreed to record a concept album that integrated Gregorian music into psychedelic pop, with the belief it would launch them into commercial success. Poncher recruited David Axelrod, a formally neo-classically trained musician, to compose all of the material for the project. The result, Mass in F Minor, was a complex arrangement of religious-based rock, which was sung entirely in Latin. Although the band did record the songs [...] "Kyrie Eleison", [...] "Gloria", and [...] "Credo", the intricate orchestration proved to be too difficult and time-consuming for the group. As a consequence, Hassinger enlisted the Canadian group, The Collectors, among other session musicians, in completing the album, although Lowe, Tulin, and Weakley did contribute to every track. Mass in F Minor was released in January 1968 and reached number 135 on the Billboard 200. An eerie version of the opening track, [...] "Kyrie Eleison", became somewhat of an underground favorite when it appeared in the soundtrack for the counterculture film, Easy Rider. The Electric Prunes performed with the new songs in concert just once, at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, which Tulin described: [...] "From the outset the performance was a disaster. We missed the intro on the first song and it never got any better. Amp speakers blew, charts fell off music stands and everyone was, in general, in a complete state of confusion. Ended up each song turned into one long jam. I think we were, at times, {{all in the same}} key. I made my way over to the four celli and four French horns and told them to 'jam in E.' <b>Somehow</b> <b>we</b> would hit a break and James would manage a vocal". As a result of financial and musical issues, Weakley and Lowe left the group in early 1968. Tulin and Williams finished a tour with a line-up that also included Kenny Loggins and Jeremy Stuart, but by mid-1968 they too departed the group.|$|E

"The beast {{could find}} its food <b>somehow</b> if <b>we</b> left it loose, and it's quite {{probable}} {{that it would}} work down along the back trail to the settlements when the grass round here gets scarce," [...] he said.
