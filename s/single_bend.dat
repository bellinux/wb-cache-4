[...] Material investigation was carried out on the durability of high-strength concrete tensile properties under cold ocean environment (freeze-thaw cycles). Tensile properties of high-strength concrete in terms of modulus of rupture, direct tensile strength and fracture energy were examined up to 700 freeze-thaw cycles in laboratory simulated environment. [...] An experimental investigation on shear enhancement was carried out on seven high-strength concrete slabs to study the punching shear capacity and shear enhancement. Five types of different shear reinforcement, namely <b>single</b> <b>bending,</b> U-stirrup, double bending, shear-stud and T-headed shear reinforcement were tested and evaluated. The emphasis is placed upon the evaluation of their contribution to punching shear capacity of high-strength concrete plates. Structural behaviours were evaluated in terms of overall load-deflection response, ultimate loading capacity, post-ultimate loading capacity, ductility and energy absorption. Failure patterns and strain distribution were also discussed. [...] The analytical investigation was conducted by using the finite element analysis. The finite element analysis reported herein is an application of the nonlinear analysis of reinforced concrete structures using three-dimensional solid finite element. The purpose of this application {{is based on the}} fact that employing three-dimensional elements is the only successful way to model out-of-plane shear reinforcement in the slabs.

40|$|Communication orale + résuméIn {{their natural}} environment, plants are {{continuously}} exposed to highly variable wind loads, {{and in particular}} to the days-to-week scale alternation of windy and quiet periods. In response to a single mechanical load, plants usually exhibit a dramatic growth response (thigmomorphogenesis) and genes involved are being characterized. However, molecular mechanisms involved in plant acclimation to recurring and successive mechanical loadings are not well characterized. More specifically how plants avoid over-responding in to continuously changing wind conditions is unknown. Through {{the analysis of the}} short-time effects of quantified stem bending on young poplars, we demonstrated the rapid induction of PtaZFP 2 expression, a gene encoding a putative C 2 H 2 zinc finger transcription factor. The PtaZFP 2 transcripts accumulate 10 min after a <b>single</b> <b>bending</b> and the relative abundance of PtaZFP 2 transcripts was linearly correlated with the amount of applied mechanical solicitation (Martin et al., 2009; Coutand et al., 2009). To test the effect of successive bending, young trees were submitted either to one transient bending per day for several days or to two bendings, 1 – 14 days apart. Our results indicate that both diameter growth and gene expression responses are reduced after several bendings. In particular, PtaZFP 2 mRNA accumulated to a lesser extent after two bendings than after a single one. The minimum rest period between two successive loadings necessary to recover a response similar to that observed after a <b>single</b> <b>bending,</b> was 5 days. This response was observed for three other early mechano-responsive genes having different functions in the plant mechanosensing pathway, such as calcium signalling or wall modifications. These results clearly show a partial desensitization of plants to recurrent successive bendings, indicating a day-scale acclimation of sensitivity (accommodation) (Martin et al., 2010). Our objectives are now to identify molecular actors involved in such mechanism by studying the regulation of early responsive gene such as PtaZFP 2 (Gourcilleau et al., 2011) ...|$|R

To date, there have been very few bench tests of the different systems and the aim of our study was to test two catheters on different models of arteries with 6 and 12 -hour-old thrombi. MethodsThe test apparatus consisted of 3 -mm diameter glass tubes of 150 mm in length. The thrombi were left for either 6 or 12 hours and ten models of tubes were used: straight, with a <b>single</b> <b>bend</b> and with two bends. Two types of catheter were tested: the Export® aspiration catheter (EAC) and the Proxis® embolic protection system (PES). The main assessment criterion was total thrombectomy. ResultsTotal thrombectomy was achieved in only 55. 3 % of the tests and no difference appeared between the two systems. Total thrombectomy was achieved more frequently with 6 -h thrombi than with 12 -h thrombi for the two techniques, 62. 5 % vs. 42. 5 % (p = 0. 018) and 67. 5 % vs. 48. 7 % (p = 0. 025) for EAC and PES catheter, respectively. In contrast, total thrombectomy was more frequent in straight tubes and in tubes with a <b>single</b> <b>bend</b> than in tubes with double bends, respectively for EAC (64 % vs. 44. 8 %, p = 0. 028) and for PES (85. 9 % vs. 35. 4 %, p< 0. 001).

The pull-out of the fibres is first studied by means of accurate three-dimensional models which {{take into account the}} non linearities that are present in the physical model. The bonding properties of the fibre-matrix interface considered in the numerical model are based on experimental results of pull-out tests on straight fibres. The results of the numerical model are compared with respect to the results of experimental tests on hooked fibres. Then, the paper studies the effect of different fibre geometries to the load-displacement pull-out curves. It is concluded that fibres having a doubly bended shape have a superior behaviour compared to fibres having a <b>single</b> <b>bended</b> part.

40|$|Mechanical {{signals are}} {{important}} factors that control plant growth and development. External mechanical loadings {{lead to a}} decrease in elongation and a stimulation of diameter growth, a syndrome known as thigmomorphogenesis. A previous study has demonstrated that plants perceive the strains they are subjected to and not forces or stresses. On this basis, an integrative biomechanical model of mechanosensing was established ("sum-of-strains model") and tested on tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) elongation but not for local responses such as diameter growth or gene expression. The first aim of this interdisciplinary work {{was to provide a}} quantitative study of the effect of a <b>single</b> transitory <b>bending</b> on poplar (Populus tremula 3 alba) diameter growth and on the expression level of a primary mechanosensitive transcription factor gene, PtaZFP 2. The second aim of this work was to assess the sum-of-strains model of mechanosensing on these local responses. An original bending device was built to study stem responses according to a controlled range of strains. A <b>single</b> <b>bending</b> modified plant diameter growth and increased the relative abundance of PtaZFP 2 transcripts. Integrals of longitudinal strains induced by bending on the responding tissues were highly correlated to local plant responses. The sum-of-strains model of mechanosensing established for stem elongation was thus applicable for local responses at two scales: diameter growth and gene expression. These novel results open avenues for the ordering of gene expression profiles {{as a function of the}} intensity of mechanical stimulation and provide a generic biomechanical core for an integrative model of thigmomorphogenesis linking gene expression with growth responses...|$|R
