In case of pipe conduits various flow meters are used for flow estimation; out of which venturimeter and orifice meter are most commonly used and conventional means. Pipes or conduit carrying <b>sediment</b> <b>laden</b> flow or slurry-water mixture is very common in most of the industries, sewage carrying system etc. Suitability of flow meters i. e. venturimeter and flow meter need to be analyzed for <b>sediment</b> <b>laden</b> flow. Due to the presence of slurry or sediments, coefficient of discharge of flow meter will vary. In the present paper, various works that have been carried out till now in the analysis of characteristics of venturimeter and orifice meter with <b>sediment</b> <b>laden</b> flow are described...|$|R

Tongues of clear oceanic water are observed to enter the inlet through Kennedy Channel along the east shoreline in the vicinity of Cape Elizabeth.

40|$|Hydraulic model {{tests and}} flume {{experiments}} for mountainous torrents and rivers {{have been conducted}} to clarify flow characteristics for many kinds of sediment movement modes such as mud flow, debris flow and so on. Especially, in case of mud flows and <b>sediment</b> <b>laden</b> flows with wide sediment grain size distribution, there are problems to be solved for not only similarity in experimental approach, but also flow model and constitutive relationship in numerical simulation. In flume tests, coarse sediment particles can reproduce sediment erosion/deposition in those flow regimes, focusing on that locally spatial and time averaged bed variation is formed mainly by bedloads. However, it can be quite difficult to reproduce turbulent flow with fine sediment particles in model flume. In case of mud flows, modeling and treatments for muddy flow body which is liquid-phase are still now difficult and coarse sediment particles {{can be regarded as}} particles with small specific weight in comparison to sand. Additionally, in case of <b>sediment</b> <b>laden</b> flows with nonuniform sediment, it can be important to consider how to reproduce wide grain size distribution of sediment particles in model. It can be better that artificial material is used in place of sand particles based on Froude and dimensionless bed shear stress similarity to reproduce several sediment transport modes. In present study, the applicability of light and heavy artificial material for hydraulic experimental teats is examined using experimental data such as sediment flux concentration and flow resistance in flows over erodible bed...|$|R

Many run-of-river hydro power projects are coming up on these rivers and suspended sediment enters into the power intake of these projects. Desilting chambers are provided to remove / minimize the suspended sediment from water conductor system. The settled sediment in the desilting chamber is flushed out continuously through the flushing tunnels provided just below the chamber. These flushing tunnels carry the settled <b>sediment</b> <b>laden</b> water up to their outfall in river downstream of the dam.

The experimental bed was a smooth fixed bed. It was observed that with the tetrahedron frame the mean longitudinal velocity decrease in the retardation zone. However, both the longitudinal and the vertical turbulence intensities are larger than those for the undisturbed approach flow. The tetrahedron frame may reduce the probability of sediment entrainment by retarding the flow and reducing the boundary shear stress.

40|$|This {{study focused}} on impact of <b>sediment</b> <b>laden</b> water of the Nile - {{especially}} during flood season - on viscosity, rheological properties and flow characteristics of water within water network and piping systems. Laboratory experiments, performed at the National Research Centre Laboratories at Khartoum, were conducted on water samples collected from the Blue Nile and for carefully prepared synthetic slurries that resembled turbid flood water during the period 2009 to 2011. Experiments showed that water viscosity increased due {{to an increase in}} amount of sediment load and concentration in tested water samples. Moreover, laboratory investigations revealed that viscosity of water <b>laden</b> with <b>sediment</b> increased whenever sediment remained within the water for a period of time. Experimental results on rheological characteristics of samples showed that slurries and water <b>laden</b> <b>sediments</b> have flow properties of Non-Newtonian fluids with thixotropic characteristics and flow behavior. This may be attributed to the nature of suspended loads, characteristics of colloidal solids and particulate matter constituting the sediments. Such behavior will have its critical impact on pumping of such waters, their transportation and conveyance within networks and piping lines. SPSS program was used for analyzing laboratory data to deduce an equation that would suitably reflect and explain the relationship between water viscosity and sediment concentration. Likewise, the study achieved same results as laboratory investigations and findings. Modeling through COMSOL multiphysics program. enabled developing a relationship between viscosities, pressures and flow velocities within water network systems. Flow pattern, streamlines, changes in velocity, variations in velocity gradients, pressures, currents and pattern of flow under different structural, loading and hydraulic conditions were significant. Results and findings showed the decrease of velocity of flow with an increase in sediment concentration and load. The integrated holistic modelling tested in this research work reflected the influence of rheological aspects of quality factors (such as viscosity), engineering design parameters (such as hydraulic loading conditions), geometry and shape (such as size and area of conduits).

30|$|The {{ratio of}} {{reservoir}} capacity to inflow indirectly provides {{an index of}} residence time of <b>sediment</b> <b>laden</b> water in the reservoir (Reddy 2005). Most sediment enters reservoirs during high inflow periods and ideally if the capacity–inflow ratio is small, much {{of it will be}} discharged over the spillway (Reddy 2005). If the capacity–inflow ratio is large, much of this water is retained in the reservoir resulting in high sediment trap efficiency (Reddy 2005). The capacity–inflow ratio for the dam was 0.8 which is higher than the recommended ratio of 0.3 for long economic life of the dam. In highly degraded catchments, where large sediment yield is expected, the capacity to inflow ratio of about 0.5 is mostly recommended (Wallingford 2004). With such a high capacity–inflow ratio for the dam, the reservoir is expected to have high siltation and shorter economic life.|$|R

Generally, the equilibrium bed slope can be predicted in terms of particle to particle friction angle and sediment concentration in the case that sediment particles be-have as a laminar motion, which is common in debris flows composed of coarse sediment. But, it is rearized that the bed slope becomes smaller than that of debris flows. A two-layer model which constitutes the upper and lower layers is proposed to describe such phenomena.

40|$|Summary. Observations {{and studies}} were {{conducted}} on the origin and destina-tion of sediment in irrigation water, {{and the effects of}} sediment adsorbed on the wetted perimeter of furrows on water intake and erosion. Fine sediment adsorbed on the perimeter reduced intake and increased soil water tension which was the primary mechanism holding the sediment on the perimeter. This self enhancing effect causes this thin seal to decrease erosion and intake rates. In contrast, removal of a few square centimeters of this seal by chance events after water velocities and shear forces have increased often causes reduced tensions, exfoliation of the surface seal and erosion pits which develop into head cuts.

40|$|Open channel confluences {{are present}} in many natural and {{man-made}} waterways. The dynamics of the flow {{in and around the}} junction are complex; in particular, immediately downstream of the junction, the flow develops a zone of separation on the inner wall, with accompanying secondary re-circulation patterns. The structure of this complex flow is a function of several parameters such as flow rates in both channels, angle of confluence, channel geometry including longitudinal slope and bed discordance, boundary roughness and intensity of turbulence and has a major influence on bed erosion, bank scouring, etc. If in addition, one or both streams are sediment-laden, the structure of the downstream flow becomes even more complex due to additional variables such as variation in sediment particle size and sediment concentration. This makes detailed experimental investigation of such flows very challenging. In order to investigate the junction flow behavior, laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were performed in an equal-width, equal-depth and 90 ° flat bed open channel junction. Two separate computational codes PHOENICS and CFX were used for numerical simulations. Water heights, water velocities and sediment particle tracks were computed for different flow ratios and feed concentrations. For investigating the junction flow behavior experimentally, a laboratory scale open channel junction was designed and constructed at the hydraulics laboratory of the University of Wollongong. Experiments were conducted for clean water and <b>sediment</b> <b>laden</b> flows with different flow ratios and feed concentrations. The downstream Froude number was kept constant (0. 37) for all experiments. In <b>sediment</b> <b>laden</b> flow experiments, Corvic vinyl was introduced uniformly to the branch channel as sediment and then captured at the downstream end of the main channel to facilitate clean water flow through the main channel and <b>sediment</b> <b>laden</b> flow through branch channel. Water heights and turbidity were measured at different locations of the main channel utilizing point gauges and a custom made optical turbidity probe respectively. Numerical predictions showed higher water levels upstream of the junction followed by a sudden drop of water levels immediately downstream of the junction. This phenomenon is accompanied by flow separation at the inner bank. Higher velocities were generated adjacent to the outer bank and velocities were diminished towards the inner bank. The separation zone length and width were diminished with increasing flow ratio q* (q*=main channel flow / total flow). Using a ‘body-fitted’ computational mesh, conforming to the shape of the free surface, and carrying out a ‘water-only’ simulation imposing free slip boundary condition for the free surface produced accurate velocity patterns near the bed and the free surface, showing a good agreement with experimental results. In laboratory experiments higher sediment concentrations were observed adjacent to the inner wall immediately downstream of the junction, indicating particle deposition in the low-velocity separation region. It was observed that with increasing source sediment concentration from the branch channel, the turbidity downstream of the confluence increased while covering a larger area across the width of the main channel. Low sediment concentrations were observed upstream of the junction in all experiments. Higher turbidity gradients exist close to the junction whereas the turbidity gradients gradually diminish along the downstream of the main channel. The sediment concentrations across the main channel were controlled by the location of the shear layer. This layer was moved towards inner wall with increasing discharge ratios showing higher sediment concentration adjacent to inner wall of the main channel. For lower discharge ratios q*= 0. 25 and q*= 0. 417, sediment particles were dispersed across the entire channel width of the main channel while in higher discharge ratios q*= 0. 583 and q*= 0. 75, flow from the main channel occupied most of the cross section and therefore branch channel sediment was confined to a small area adjacent to the inner wall. Similar scenario was observed in simulated particle paths as more particle tracks were shifted towards the outer wall direction for lower discharge ratios q*= 0. 25 and q*= 0. 417 than for higher discharge ratios q*= 0. 583 and q*= 0. 75. The shape factor of the separation zone (defined as the ratio of maximum separation zone width S w to separation zone length S L) was found to vary between 0. 12 to 0. 15 for all experimental conditions tested. However the shape factor for clean water is found to be lower compared to <b>sediment</b> <b>laden</b> flow at all q* values. The current study provides new data contributing {{to a better understanding of}} flow and sediment dynamics at channel junctions.

50|$|The first dams {{date back}} to 3000 BC and were built to control flood waters for agriculture. When <b>sediment</b> <b>laden</b> river flow reaches a dam’s reservoir, the water slows down as it pools. Since slower water can’t carry as much sediment, {{virtually}} all of the sediment falls out of suspension before the water passes through the dam. The result is that most dams are nearly 100% efficient sediment traps. Additionally, the use of dams for flood control reduces the ability of downstream channels to produce sediment. Since the vast majority of sedimentation occurs during the biggest floods, reduced frequency and intensity of flood-like flows can drastically change production rates. For thousands of years there were too few dams to {{have a significant impact on}} global sedimentary cycles, except for local impacts on a few river deltas such as the Nile which were significant. However The popularization of hydroelectric power in the last century has caused an enormous boom in dam building. Currently only a third of the world’s largest rivers flow unimpeded to the ocean.|$|R

The simulation result is fit for river-bed changes after dam-break. 2007 年石門水庫上游的巴陵防砂壩潰壩事件，導致上游河床沖刷約 20 公尺，下游最大淤積約 10 公尺。本文蒐集巴陵防砂壩 1980 至 2011 年潰壩前後 8 次地形測量資料與 2008 - 2012 年共進行三次河床質粒徑調查以分析潰壩對於河床變動及河床質粒徑變化的影響。結果顯示，巴陵壩潰壩 3 個月後河床已逐漸趨於動態平衡，河床質粒徑整體有粗化再細化的趨勢。最後，本文以適用於土石流及高含砂水流的數值模式進行潰壩事件模擬，並利用河床測量成果進行比較...|$|R
