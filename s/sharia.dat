5|$|Muslim {{countries}} that retain or adopt <b>Sharia</b> usually determine which {{parts of the}} <b>Sharia</b> are enforceable and codify (and thereby modernize) them. Unlike other Muslim countries, Saudi Arabia regards uncodified <b>Sharia</b> in its entirety as {{the law of the}} land and does not interfere with it. It is, therefore, unique not only when compared to Western systems, but also in comparison to other Muslim countries, and according to one source is the closest system in the modern world to the form of <b>Sharia</b> adopted at the advent of Islam.|$|E
5|$|Royal decrees (nizam) are {{the other}} main source of law but are {{referred}} to as regulations rather than laws to indicate that they are subordinate to the <b>Sharia.</b> Royal decrees supplement <b>Sharia</b> in areas such as labor, commercial and corporate law. Additionally, other forms of regulations (lai'hah) include Royal Orders, Council of Ministers Resolutions, Ministerial Resolutions and, Ministerial Circulars, and are similarly subordinate to <b>Sharia.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>Sharia</b> {{court system}} {{constitutes}} the basic judiciary of Saudi Arabia and its judges and lawyers {{form part of}} the ulema, the country's religious leadership. There are also extra-Sharia government tribunals which handle disputes relating to specific royal decrees and since 2008, specialist courts, including the Board of Grievances and the Specialized Criminal Court. Final appeal from both <b>Sharia</b> courts and government tribunals is to the King and , all courts and tribunals followed <b>Sharia</b> rules of evidence and procedure.|$|E
5|$|The {{legal system}} of Saudi Arabia {{is based on}} <b>Sharia,</b> Islamic law derived from the Qur'an and the Sunnah (the traditions) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The sources of <b>Sharia</b> also include Islamic {{scholarly}} consensus developed after Muhammad's death. Its interpretation by judges in Saudi Arabia {{is influenced by the}} medieval (Islamic Golden Age) texts of the literalist Hanbali school of Islamic jurisprudence. Uniquely in the Muslim world, <b>Sharia</b> has been adopted by Saudi Arabia in an uncodified form. This, and the lack of judicial precedent, has resulted in considerable uncertainty in the scope and content of the country's laws. The government therefore announced its intention to codify <b>Sharia</b> in 2010, but this is yet to be implemented. <b>Sharia</b> has also been supplemented by regulations issued by royal decree covering modern issues such as intellectual property and corporate law. Nevertheless, <b>Sharia</b> remains the primary source of law, especially in areas such as criminal, family, commercial and contract law, and the Qur'an and the Sunnah are declared to be the country's constitution. In the areas of land and energy law the extensive proprietorial rights of the Saudi state (in effect, the Saudi royal family) constitute a significant feature.|$|E
5|$|Laws {{relating}} to marriage, divorce, children and inheritance are not codified and {{fall within the}} general jurisdiction of the <b>Sharia</b> courts.|$|E
5|$|In 2014 {{numerous}} celebrities started boycotting {{the hotel}} {{due to its}} links {{to the introduction of}} <b>Sharia</b> Law in Brunei, which most famously includes the death penalty for various forms of immorality.|$|E
5|$|In April 2009, President Asif Ali Zardari {{signed the}} Nizam-e-Adl Regulation into law. The {{regulation}} formally established <b>Sharia</b> {{law in the}} Malakand division.|$|E
5|$|In May 1970, the Revolutionary Intellectuals Seminar {{was held}} to bring intellectuals {{in line with the}} revolution, while that year's Legislative Review and Amendment united secular and {{religious}} law codes, introducing <b>sharia</b> into the legal system.|$|E
5|$|In addition, a Colonel Sanders statue {{was taken}} from the {{storefront}} of a KFC in nearby Kōbe, and its hands were cut off supposedly in imitation of <b>Sharia</b> law.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{because the}} judge is {{empowered}} to disregard previous judgments (either his own or of other judges) and can apply his personal interpretation of <b>Sharia</b> to any particular case through ijtihad, divergent judgements arise even in apparently identical cases. There is a presumption against overturning a decision when {{it is based on}} ijtihad. This principle is crucial in two respects. Firstly, it concentrates the substance of the law in the hands of judges as, in consequence, there is a presumption that only a judge exercising ijtihad, rather than a king or a parliament, can determine God's law. Secondly, it renders a judge's decision practically immune to reversal on appeal. The role of ijtihad has led to calls for the <b>Sharia</b> to be codified to give clarity and remove uncertainty. As a result, in 2010, the Minister of Justice announced plans to implement a codification of <b>Sharia</b> law, although resistance from the religious establishment is reportedly delaying its implementation.|$|E
5|$|Qadis {{generally}} have degrees in <b>Sharia</b> law from an Islamic university {{recognized by the}} Saudi government with, in many cases, a post-graduate qualification from the Institute of Higher Judiciary in Riyadh. The training received from such <b>Sharia</b> law degrees is entirely religious in character {{and is based on}} the Qur'an and centuries old religious treatises with no reference to, for example, modern commercial issues. Although most judges have been educated and appointed under the current system, some of the older judges received the traditional qadi's training of years of instruction by a religious mentor in a mosque.|$|E
5|$|Saudi law recognizes only {{corporate}} or partnership entities established under <b>Sharia</b> or the Saudi Company Law of 1982. A {{contract with}} {{any other type of}} company will be void and the persons who made the contract in the company's name will be personally liable for it. Under <b>Sharia,</b> corporations can take a number of forms, but the most common in Saudi Arabia is Sharikat Modarabah where some partners contribute assets and others contribute expertise. In addition, the Company Law (which is based on Egyptian company law) identifies eight permissible forms of corporate entity including joint ventures, and limited liability partnerships.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sharia</b> (or Islamic law), {{the primary}} source of law in modern Saudi Arabia, was {{developed}} gradually by Muslim judges and scholars between the seventh and tenth centuries. From the time of the Abbasid caliphate in the 8th century, the developing <b>Sharia</b> was accepted as the basis of law in the towns of the Muslim world, including the Arabian peninsula, and upheld by local rulers, eclipsing urf (or pre-Islamic local customary law). In the rural areas, urf continued to be predominant for some time, and, for instance, was the main source of law among the bedouin of Nejd in central Arabia until the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Sharia</b> {{courts have}} general {{jurisdiction}} over most {{civil and criminal}} cases. At present, {{there are two types}} of courts of first instance: general courts and summary courts dealing with lesser cases. Cases are adjudicated by single judges, except criminal cases if the potential sentence is death, amputation or stoning when there is a panel of three judges. There are also two courts for the Shia minority in the Eastern Province dealing with family and religious matters. Appellate courts sit in Mecca and Riyadh and review decisions for compliance with <b>Sharia.</b>|$|E
5|$|The current court {{complex is}} located along Lebuh Empat. It {{contains}} the High Court, Sessions Court, and the Magistrate Court. Another {{court for the}} <b>Sharia</b> law was also located in the town.|$|E
5|$|The current court {{complex is}} located along Tugu Road. It {{contains}} the High Court, Sessions Court, and the Magistrate Court. Another {{court for the}} <b>Sharia</b> law were also located {{in the area of}} Sembulan.|$|E
5|$|The lack of {{codification}} of <b>Sharia</b> {{leads to}} considerable variation in its interpretation and application. Furthermore, {{there is no}} system of judicial precedent, as Wahhabism rejects the imitation of past scholarship (taqlid) in favor of independent reasoning (ijtihad).|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of Muslims in Nigeria are Sunni belonging to Maliki school of jurisprudence; however, a sizeable minority also belongs to Shafi madhhab. A large number of Sunni Muslims are members of Sufi brotherhoods. Most Sufis follow the Qadiriyya, Tijaniyyah and/or the Mouride movements. A significant Shia minority exists (see Shia in Nigeria). Some northern states have incorporated <b>Sharia</b> law into their previously secular legal systems, which has brought about some controversy. Kano State has sought to incorporate <b>Sharia</b> law into its constitution. The majority of Quranists follow the Kalo Kato or Quraniyyun movement. There are also Ahmadiyya and Mahdiyya minorities.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sharia</b> law, {{used only}} in the {{predominantly}} Muslim northern states of the country. It is an Islamic legal system {{that had been used}} long before the colonial administration. In late 1999, Zamfara emphasised its use, with eleven other northern states following suit. These states are Kano, Katsina, Niger, Bauchi, Borno, Kaduna, Gombe, Sokoto, Jigawa, Yobe, and Kebbi.|$|E
5|$|Since 2002, {{the country}} has seen sectarian {{violence}} by Boko Haram, an Islamist movement that seeks to abolish the secular system of government and establish <b>Sharia</b> law in the country. In the 2010 Jos riots, more than 500 people were killed by religious violence.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{theology}} of Twelvers, the Twelve Imams are exemplary human individuals who not only rule over the community with justice, but also are able to keep and interpret <b>sharia</b> and the esoteric meaning of the Quran. Muhammad and Imams' words and deeds are a guide and model for the community to follow; as a result, they must be free from error and sin (known as ismah, or infallibility) and must be chosen by divine decree, or nass, through the Prophet.|$|E
5|$|Al-Qassam {{was born}} in Jableh, northwestern Syria, to father Abd al-Qadar, a <b>Sharia</b> court {{official}} during Ottoman rule and a local leader of the Qadariyya Sufi order. His grandfather had been a leading sheikh of the Qadariyya order and moved to Jableh from Iraq. Al-Qassam also followed the Hanafi fiqh (school of jurisprudence) of Sunni Islam and studied at the local Istambuli Mosque under the teaching of well-known ′alim (scholar) Sheikh Salim Tayarah.|$|E
5|$|In 1951 he was {{elevated}} to archimandrite while serving in Alexandria. While {{there he was}} threatened with arrest for preventing the {{execution of a sentence}} passed by a <b>Sharia</b> tribunal. On August 27, 1954, he was named auxiliary bishop of Antioch; then, on September 2, 1954, he was appointed Titular Archbishop of Nubia. Zoghby was formally consecrated bishop on November 21, 1954, when he was {{elevated to}} Patriarchal Vicar for the See of Alexandria, Cairo and the Sudan.|$|E
5|$|In Arabic, {{the word}} for street (الشارع, ash-shāriʿ) is derived from a root whose other forms denote a place of entry or beginning, {{the point of a}} weapon, and law or {{lawfulness}} and legitimacy in both the secular and religious sense. Among those words are <b>sharia,</b> the term for Islamic religious and moral law. Shāriʿ itself {{can also be used to}} refer to a legislator or lawgiver, and when used with the definite article al- in a religious context is a reference to God as the source of all religious law.|$|E
5|$|Islamic feminists {{advocate}} women's rights, gender equality, {{and social}} justice grounded within an Islamic framework. Advocates seek to highlight the deeply rooted teachings of equality in the Quran and encourage a questioning of the patriarchal interpretation of Islamic teaching through the Quran, hadith (sayings of Muhammad), and <b>sharia</b> (law) towards {{the creation of a}} more equal and just society. Although rooted in Islam, the movement's pioneers have also utilized secular and Western feminist discourses and recognize the role of Islamic feminism as part of an integrated global feminist movement.|$|E
5|$|On July 14, 2016, Gingrich {{stated that}} he {{believes}} that Americans of Muslim backgrounds who believe in <b>Sharia</b> law should be deported, and that visiting websites that promote the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant or Al-Qaeda should be a felony. Some observers have questioned whether these views violate the free speech and {{free exercise of religion}} clauses of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the major}} issues are aspects of <b>sharia</b> (Islamic law) known as Muslim {{personal}} law (MPL) or Muslim family law. Some of the thorny issues regarding {{the way in which}} MPL has thus far been formulated include polygyny, divorce, custody of children, maintenance and marital property. In addition, there are also more macro issues regarding the underlying assumptions of such legislation, for example, the assumption of the man as head of the household.|$|E
5|$|The Saudi {{system of}} justice {{has been criticized for}} being slow, arcane, lacking in some of the {{safeguards}} of justice and unable to deal with the modern world. In 2007, King Abdullah issued royal decrees with the aim of reforming the judiciary and creating a new court system. The reforms have yet to be implemented in full but, once they are, will include the creation of a Supreme Court and the transfer of the Board of Grievances' commercial and criminal jurisdictions to a restructured general court system. New specialist first instance courts will be established comprising general, criminal, personal status, commercial and labor courts. The <b>Sharia</b> courts will therefore lose their general jurisdiction to hear all cases and the work load of the government's administrative tribunals will be transferred to the new courts. Another important change is the establishment of appeal courts for each province. It has been claimed that the reforms will establish a system for codifying <b>Sharia</b> and incorporating the principle of judicial precedent into court practice.|$|E
5|$|Various {{sources of}} <b>sharia</b> {{are used by}} Islamic {{jurisprudence}} to elucidate the body of Islamic law. The primary source accepted universally by all Muslims is the Qur'an, the majority adhering also to the traditionally reported Sunnah, but rejected by others; Quranism. The Qur'an is the holy scripture of Islam, believed by Muslims to be the direct and unaltered word of God. The Sunnah consists of the alleged religious actions and quotations of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, narrated through his Companions and the Imams (per the beliefs of the Sunni and Shi'ite schools respectively).|$|E
5|$|Weh Island {{is a part}} of Aceh province. A 1993 census {{reported}} 24,700 inhabitants. The {{large majority}} of the population are Acehnese and the remaining are Minangkabau, Javanese, Batak and Chinese. It is unknown when the island was first inhabited. Islam is the main religion, as Aceh is a special province where <b>Sharia</b> law has been applied exclusively for the province. However, there are some Christians and Buddhists on the island. They are mostly Javanese, Batak and Chinese.|$|E
5|$|After its {{dedication}} in 972, {{and with}} the hiring by mosque authorities of 35 scholars in 989, the mosque slowly developed into what is today the second oldest continuously run university in the world after Al Karaouine in Umayyad Fes. Al-Azhar University has long been regarded as the foremost institution in the Islamic world {{for the study of}} Sunni theology and <b>sharia,</b> or Islamic law. The university, integrated within the mosque as part of a mosque school since its inception, was nationalized and officially designated an independent university in 1961, following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952.|$|E
5|$|Courts {{are divided}} into three categories: civil, religious, and special. The civil courts deal with civil and {{criminal}} matters, including cases brought against the government. The civil courts include Magistrate Courts, Courts of First Instance, Courts of Appeal, High Administrative Courts which hear cases relating to administrative matters, and the Constitutional Court which {{was set up in}} 2012 in order to hear cases regarding the constitutionality of laws. Although Islam is the state religion, the constitution preserves a degree of religious and personal freedom. Religious law only extends to matters of personal status such as divorce and inheritance in religious courts, and is partially based on Islamic <b>Sharia</b> law. The special court deals with cases forwarded by the civil one.|$|E
5|$|In 1929 he was {{appointed}} the marriage registrar at the <b>sharia</b> court in Haifa by the Waqf authorities in Jerusalem, a role {{that allowed him to}} tour the northern villages, whose inhabitants he encouraged to set up agricultural cooperatives. According to the American historian Edmund Burke, al-Qassam was:An individual deeply imbued with the Islamic social gospel and who was struck by the plight of Palestinian peasants and migrants. Al-Qassam's pastoral concern was linked to his moral outrage as a Muslim at {{the ways in which the}} old implicit social compact was being violated in the circumstances of British mandatory Palestine. This anger fueled a political radicalism that drove him eventually to take up arms and marks him off from the Palestinian notable politicians.|$|E
5|$|Monarchy is {{the system}} of rule in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Rulers of the country shall be from amongst {{the sons of the}} founder King Abdulaziz bin Abdulrahman Al-Faisal Al-Saud, and their descendants. The most upright among them shall receive {{allegiance}} according to Almighty God's Book and His Messenger's Sunna (Traditions)...Government in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia derives its authority from the Book of God and the Sunna of the Prophet (PBUH), which are the ultimate sources of reference for this Law and the other laws of the State...Governance in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is based on justice, shura (consultation) and equality according to Islamic <b>Sharia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Musa Qala was {{the only}} {{significant}} town held by the Taliban {{at the time of}} the assault, and they had imposed a strict rule on its inhabitants. Special tribunals were set up, pronouncing sentences of stoning, amputation, or death by hanging against those who were considered enemies, or who contravened a strict interpretation of the <b>Sharia.</b> Four men are known to have been hanged as spies during this period. The Taliban also levied heavy taxes, closed down schools, and drafted local men into their ranks by force. Other deprivations were reminiscent of previous Taliban rule: men attacked for not wearing beards; music banned and recordings smashed; women punished for not wearing the burqa. The town is situated in a major opium poppy growing area and a BBC correspondent has reported it to be the centre of the heroin trade in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Peace {{negotiations}} with the Taliban were announced by Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif after his election, although previous attempts to engage TTP in dialogue had failed. The first session of talks, between committees appointed by the Pakistani Government and the Taliban, was held on 26 March 2014 at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House in Islamabad. The Taliban did not name representatives from their ranks, instead nominating pro-Taliban religious figures to present their views. The terrorists called {{for the implementation of}} <b>Sharia</b> in Pakistan; the Government of Pakistan demanded the cessation of hostilities, insisting that talks be held {{within the framework of the}} Pakistani constitution. A month-long ceasefire was reached on 1 March 2014.|$|E
