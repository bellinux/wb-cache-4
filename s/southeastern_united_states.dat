5|$|On {{the east}} coast of Florida, Klaus {{produced}} 15foot (4.5m) waves and tides of 3feet (1m) above normal.

In South Carolina, the rainfall caused a dam to burst, killing four people. About two days after the remnants of Klaus entered the <b>southeastern</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> Tropical Storm Marco made landfall on northwestern Florida, dropping more heavy rainfall and causing heavy damage across the region.|$|E
