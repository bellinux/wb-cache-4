5|$|The Georgia Tech administration's {{position}} on stealing the 'T' from Tech Tower has varied over the years. When the 'T' was first stolen in 1969, interim Institute President Vernon Crawford was <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> he considered canceling classes {{until it was}} returned. Afterwards, subsequent presidents opted to {{turn a blind eye}} to the practice, with one president, John Patrick Crecine, going so far as to endorse it.|$|E
5|$|Harlan argued to Goebbels that Söderbaum, {{having just}} given birth, {{was too weak}} to take on the role. Goebbels countered that a special room could be set up as a nursery and that a wet-nurse could be hired to care for the infant. He further offered to halt {{shooting}} if Söderbaum became ill. Harlan later reported that Söderbaum was <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> by the entire affair that she considered fleeing back to her native Sweden to avoid having to play the part of Dorothea. In the end, however, she decided to stay and performed the role.|$|E

5|$|After {{being thrown}} out of the theater by the manager, the gang shoplift from the Kwik-E-Mart, throw rocks at the Jebediah Springfield statue, and watch clouds. Bart remarks that one cloud resembles Jebediah Springfield, but without a head. His new friends remark that they wish someone would decapitate the statue, saying it would be funny to see the town <b>so</b> <b>upset.</b> When Bart disagrees, the bullies make fun of him. Bart is {{conflicted}} and asks Homer whether it is okay to compromise one's beliefs to be popular. Homer tells Bart that popularity {{is the most important thing}} in the world, as long as Bart is not talking about killing someone. That night, Bart sneaks out of the house and decapitates the statue.|$|E
25|$|Later, Sarah {{gave birth}} to Isaac, and {{the tension between the}} women returned. At a celebration after Isaac was weaned, Sarah found the teenage Ishmael mocking her son. She was <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> by it that she demanded that Abraham send Hagar and her son away. She {{declared}} that Ishmael would not share in Isaac's inheritance. Abraham was greatly distressed but God told Abraham to do as his wife commanded because God's promise would be carried out through both Isaac and Ishmael.|$|E
25|$|The {{new king}} of Sweden, Athislus (Eadgils), {{thought that the}} tribute to the Daner might be smaller if he married the Danish king's mother and so took Urse for a queen. However, after some time, Urse was <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> with the Swedish king's greed that she thought out a ruse {{to run away from}} the king {{and at the same time}} {{liberate}} him of his wealth. She incited Athislus to rebel against Roluo, and arranged so that Roluo would be invited and promised a wealth in gifts.|$|E
5000|$|... "To {{speak the}} truth, I {{think that people}} ought to be upset, and if I had a paper I would upset them all the time; I think that life is so {{important}} and, in its workings, <b>so</b> <b>upsetting</b> that nobody should be spared."

5000|$|When Druse {{was sentenced}} to death in Herkimer County, New York, {{suspension}} hanging was the method of execution. The process jerked the prisoner upwards by a weighted rope instead of the body dropping downwards through a trap door. But as Druse was a small woman, the force failed to break her neck leaving her to die agonizingly by strangulation. The scene was <b>so</b> <b>upsetting,</b> officials decided to switch the primary method of execution in the state to the electric chair.|$|R
25|$|The {{decision}} {{to support the}} invasion was not unanimous. It was opposed by Karl Radek and was held secret from Trotsky {{who was in the}} Ural area at that time. The latter was <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> by the news of the Central Committee decision and Ordzhonikidze’s role in engineering it that on his return to Moscow he demanded, though fruitlessly, that a special party commission be set up to investigate the affair. Later Trotsky would reconcile himself to the accomplished fact and even defend the invasion in a special pamphlet.|$|E
25|$|The episode {{scheduled}} for February 10, 2001, hosted by Jennifer Lopez, aired 45 minutes late {{due to an}} XFL game. Lopez and the cast were not told they were airing on a delay. Michaels was <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> by the delay that the episode was rerun a mere three weeks later, and the fledgling league actually changed the rules in order to speed up play, and a deal was reached where the feed to future games would be cut off (whether the game had been decided or not) when SNL started so that no such incident would happen again.|$|E
25|$|The Bolsheviks {{started a}} new workers-oriented {{newspaper}} in Saint Petersburg on 22 April 1912, and also called it Pravda. Trotsky was <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> {{by what he saw}} as a usurpation of his newspaper's name that in April 1913 he wrote a letter to Nikolay Chkheidze, a Menshevik leader, bitterly denouncing Lenin and the Bolsheviks. Though he quickly got over the disagreement, the letter was intercepted by the Russian police, and a copy was put into their archives. Shortly after Lenin's death in 1924, the letter was found and publicized by Trotsky's opponents within the Communist Party to portray him as Lenin's enemy.|$|E

25|$|Chavous was vocal on {{a number}} of issues in his third council term. He opposed repeal of council members' term limits (approved by voters in 1994), and {{supported}} a redistricting plan which expanded Ward 7 west of the Anacostia River (angering residents of Kingman Park, who wished to remain part of Ward 6). But Peggy Cooper Cafritz, the highly influential president of the new school board, strongly criticized Chavous for failing to secure more funding for public schools, and residents of Ward 7 were <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> with his failure to push for cleanup of abandoned lots that 20 of them dumped trash on Chavous' front lawn in January 2003.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} that Alexander was preparing to crown his second wife as tsarina-consort, much as Peter the Great had done with his wife Marta Helena Skowrońska, who became Catherine I. Indeed, the tsar ordered research {{be done on the}} subject in order to evaluate how Catherine's coronation might be achieved. The tsarevich was <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> by these plans that he threatened to leave for Denmark with his family, but he chose to stay after the tsar threatened to replace him as heir by his half-brother. Another rumour suggested the tsar might abdicate, at the urging of his wife, and go to live with her and their children in France.|$|E
25|$|Perry {{used his}} {{reputation}} to psyche out the hitters as well. As {{he looked in}} to his catcher for the pitch selection, Perry would touch various parts of his head, such as his eyebrows and his cap. In this manner, he {{may or may not}} have been applying a foreign substance to the ball on any particular pitch. Reggie Jackson was <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> after striking out against Perry one time that Jackson was ejected from the game. Jackson returned from the dugout with a container of Gatorade, splashing Gatorade onto the field while yelling at the umpire that Perry should be allowed to use the Gatorade on the baseball.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, now," [...] said Reuben, with decisive earnestness, [...] "that sort o' coarse touch that's <b>so</b> <b>upsetting</b> to Ann's {{feelings}} is {{to my mind}} a recommendation; for it do always prove a {{story to}} be true. And for the same reason, I like a story with a bad moral. My sonnies, all true stories have a coarse touch or a bad moral, depend upon't. If the story- tellers could ha' got decency and good morals from true stories, who'd ha' troubled to invent parables?" [...] Saying this the tranter arose to fetch a new stock of cider, ale, mead, and home-made wines.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Indeed! She {{made sure}} {{that he would be}} there!' exclaimed Mrs. Morton, much dismayed. 'Let me go and see. She is <b>so</b> much <b>upset</b> {{altogether}} that she declares that she cannot see you this evening.' ...|$|R

25|$|After Sun Yi's death, Sun He, a {{relative}} of Sun Quan's family, came to Wanling County (宛陵縣; present-day Xuancheng, Anhui), the capital of Danyang Commandery, to restore order. He blamed Gai Lan and Dai Yuan for Sun Yi's murder {{but was unable to}} exert control over the military forces in the commandery. Gai Lan and Dai Yuan became worried because Sun He, who had no blood relations with Sun Yi, was already <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> over Sun Yi's death. They believed that they would be in deeper trouble if Sun Quan (Sun Yi's brother) personally came to Danyang to pursue the matter, so they murdered Sun He as well. They then sent a messenger to Liu Fu, the Inspector (刺史) of Yang Province, and expressed their willingness to defect to Liu's side.|$|E
25|$|He {{then joined}} Rangers for £65,000, then a record fee for a {{transfer}} between two Scottish clubs. He was blamed for {{a goal that}} they conceded in the 1969 Scottish Cup Final, in a match {{in which he was}} designated to mark Celtic captain, Billy McNeill, and was subsequently forced to play for the club's junior side instead of for the first team. According to his brother, Ferguson was <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> by the experience that he threw his losers' medal away. There have been claims that he suffered discrimination at Rangers after his marriage to a Catholic, Cathy Holding, but Ferguson himself makes it clear in his autobiography that Rangers knew of his wife's religion when he joined the club and that he left the club very reluctantly, due to the fall-out from his alleged cup final mistake.|$|E
25|$|Egil (Egill)'s boyhood foreshadowed {{his future}} rebelliousness and poetic prowess. His {{unbridled}} behavior and strength beyond his age {{earned him a}} stay at home when a feast was held by Yngvar (Egil's maternal grandfather). Egil defiantly rode a horse to attend, and composed his first skaldic verse at age three. At {{the age of seven}} while playing in the ball games, he committed his first murder (axe-killing an older boy who outclassed him in the sport). By the time Egil was twelve very few grown men could compete with him in games, but when he and his friend challenged his father one day, Skallagrim manifested such strength at nightfall that he slammed the friend dead against the ground. Egil was <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> he killed one of his father's favorite workers, and the two were not on speaking terms.|$|E
50|$|In 1977, his 4 {{years old}} {{daughter}} {{died in an}} accident in Lahore, Pakistan. He was <b>so</b> emotionally <b>upset</b> after that accident {{that he decided to}} quit the Pakistani film industry. In 1979, Ratan Kumar left Pakistan never to return again.|$|R
2500|$|In 1734, Johnson {{feared that}} he was {{suffering}} from a disease that would lead to him being deemed mad. He wrote, in Latin, a letter asking Samuel Swynfen, his godfather, about his health. Swynfen wrote back [...] "from the symptoms therein described, he could think nothing better of his disorder, than it had a tendency to insanity; and without great care might possibly terminate in the deprivation of his rational faculties." [...] This Swynfen's response only caused Johnson to fear becoming insane even more. However, Swynfen soon after showed Johnson's letter to others because of its [...] "extraordinary acuteness, research, and eloquence", and this act was <b>so</b> <b>upsetting</b> to Johnson that he could never forgive Swynfen.|$|R
5000|$|Mania.coms Jarred Pine criticises the manga for its art, {{which is}} [...] "a horrible mess". Animefringes authors agreed {{and noted that}} [...] "the cover art looks great and you get two pages in the manga that look {{excellent}} <b>so</b> it’s <b>upsetting</b> to see this".|$|R
25|$|One of Clay's clients was his father-in-law, Colonel Thomas Hart, {{an early}} settler of Kentucky and a {{prominent}} businessman. Hart {{proved to be}} an important business connection for Clay, as he helped Clay gain new clients and grow in professional stature. Clay's most notable client was Aaron Burr in 1806, after the US District Attorney Joseph Hamilton Daveiss indicted him for allegedly planning an expedition into Spanish Territory west of the Mississippi River. Clay and his law partner John Allen successfully defended Burr. Some years later Thomas Jefferson convinced Clay that Daveiss had been right in his charges. Clay was <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> that many years later, when he met Burr again, Clay refused to shake his hand. Clay's legal career would continue long after his election to Congress, and in the 1823 Supreme Court case, Green v. Biddle, Clay submitted the Supreme Court's first amicus curiae.|$|E
25|$|Reportedly, the Packers were {{in talks}} with Oakland Raiders wide {{receiver}} Randy Moss {{at the behest of}} Brett Favre. If the Packers had made the move to acquire the 30-year-old wide receiver, the trade would no doubt have been a controversial one, as Moss has a long and storied history with the Green Bay franchise. While Moss's salary was high, Green Bay, at the time, reportedly had $24 million of cap space, and could have absorbed his contract easily. These rumors were put to an end on April 29, 2007, when Oakland dealt Moss to New England for a 4th round draft pick. In the days following the NFL draft, Favre was upset concerning Green Bay's inability to acquire Moss. Favre was reportedly <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> that his agent requested that the Packers trade him. Coach Mike McCarthy was able to calm Favre down over the phone, and Favre eventually admitted that while he wanted to win, {{he did not want to}} be traded in order to do so.|$|E
25|$|In summertime village cricket is {{the delight}} of everyone. Nearly every village has its own cricket field where the young men play and the old men watch. In the village of Lintz in County Durham {{they have their own}} ground, where they have played these last 70 years. They tend it well. The wicket area is well rolled and mown. The outfield is kept short. It has a good club house for the players and seats for the onlookers. The village team play there on Saturdays and Sundays. They belong to a league, {{competing}} with the neighbouring villages. On other evenings after work they practise while the light lasts. Yet now after these 70 years a judge of the High Court has ordered that they must not play there any more. He has issued an injunction to stop them. He has done it at the instance of a newcomer who is no lover of cricket. This newcomer has built, or has had built for him, a house {{on the edge of the}} cricket ground which four years ago was a field where cattle grazed. The animals did not mind the cricket. But now this adjoining field has been turned into a housing estate. The newcomer bought one of the houses on the edge of the cricket ground. No doubt the open space was a selling point. Now he complains that when a batsman hits a six the ball has been known to land in his garden or on or near his house. His wife has got <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> about it that they always go out at week-ends. They do not go into the garden when cricket is being played. They say that this is intolerable. So they asked the judge to stop the cricket being played. And the judge, much against his will, has felt that he must order the cricket to be stopped: with the consequence, I suppose, that the Lintz Cricket Club will disappear. The cricket ground will be turned to some other use. I expect for more houses or a factory. The young men will turn to other things instead of cricket. The whole village will be much the poorer. And all this because of a newcomer who has just bought a house there next to the cricket ground.|$|E
60|$|Ursula {{stood and}} listened, her heart hard and cold. She was <b>so</b> much <b>upset,</b> {{that she felt}} almost mad. Something in her tempted her {{to turn on the}} {{headmaster}} and tell him to stop, about the miserable pens. But she did not. She could not.|$|R

2500|$|On January 31, 1977, Knievel was {{scheduled}} for a major jump in Chicago, Illinois. The jump {{was inspired by the}} film Jaws. Knievel {{was scheduled}} to jump a tank full of live sharks and would be televised live nationally. However, during his rehearsal, Knievel lost control of the motorcycle and crashed into a cameraman. Although Knievel broke his arms, he was more distraught over what he claimed was a permanent eye injury to cameraman Thomas Geren. The cameraman was admitted to the hospital and received treatment for an injury near his eye, but received no permanent injury. [...] The footage of this crash was <b>so</b> <b>upsetting</b> to Knievel that he did not show the clip for 19 years until the documentary Absolute Evel: The Evel Knievel Story.|$|R
