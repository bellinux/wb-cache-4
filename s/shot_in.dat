5|$|Most of India's early talkies were <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> Bombay, {{which remains}} the leading {{production}} center, but sound filmmaking soon {{spread across the}} multilingual nation. Within {{just a few weeks}} of Alam Aras March 1931 premiere, the Calcutta-based Madan Pictures had released both the Hindi Shirin Farhad and the Bengali Jamai Sasthi. The Hindustani Heer Ranjha was produced in Lahore, Punjab, the following year. In 1934, Sati Sulochana, the first Kannada talking picture to be released, was <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> Kolhapur, Maharashtra; Srinivasa Kalyanam became the first Tamil talkie actually <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> Tamil Nadu. Once the first talkie features appeared, the conversion to full sound production happened as rapidly in India {{as it did in the}} United States. Already by 1932, the majority of feature productions were in sound; two years later, 164 of the 172 Indian feature films were talking pictures.

In the film, the train journey was set in Eastern Europe. The journey and the truck ride were <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> Argyll, Scotland and Switzerland. The end scenes for the film were <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> Venice. However, to qualify for the British film funding of the time, at least 70 percent {{of the film}} had to have been filmed in Great Britain or the Commonwealth. The Gypsy camp was also to be filmed in an actual camp in Topkapi, but was actually <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> a replica of it in Pinewood. The scene with rats (after the theft of the Lektor) was <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> Spain, as Britain did not allow filming with wild rats, and an attempt filming white rats painted in cocoa in Turkey did not work. Principal photography began on 1 April 1963, and wrapped on 23 August. Ian Fleming spent a week in the Istanbul shoot, supervising production and touring the city with the producers.|$|E
