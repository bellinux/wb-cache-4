500|$|Robinson {{was born}} on November 30, 1964 in Des Moines, Iowa. She is the {{youngest}} of five children of former race car driver Richard [...] "Lefty" [...] Robinson, an amateur diesel truck racer who worked on cars in his home garage and promoted races in the Midwestern United States, and his wife Lois who competed in auto racing before <b>she</b> <b>flipped</b> a car, and was asked by Lefty to stop racing. She {{grew up in a}} poor family. Lefty and Lois were also known for innovative ways of entertaining crowds at stock car races which garnered national recognition. Robinson was inspired by race car drivers A. J. Foyt, Sammy Swindell, and Steve Kinser in her teenage years, and found inspiration in woman driver Janet Guthrie by her early twenties, as she had more interest in NASCAR than open-wheel racing. She and her siblings were taught that they were allowed to do anything they wished and drove minibikes, motorcycles, and snowmobiles.|$|E
6000|$|The flat was hot, dead. The {{summer heat}} was unrelenting as bedclothes drawn {{over the head}} and lashed down. Flies in sneering circles mocked the {{listless}} hand <b>she</b> <b>flipped</b> at them. Too hot to wear many clothes, yet hating the disorder of a flimsy negligée, she panted by a window, while the venomous sun glared on tin roofs, and {{a few feet away}} snarled the ceaseless trrrrrr of a steam-riveter that was erecting new flats to shut off their view of the Hudson. In the lava-paved back yard was the insistent filelike voice of the janitor's son, who kept piping: [...] "Haaay, Bil-lay, hey; Billy's got a girl! Hey, Billy's got a girl! Haaay, Bil-lay!" [...] She imagined herself going down and slaughtering him; vividly saw herself waiting for the elevator, venturing into the hot sepulcher of the back areaway, and there becoming too languid to complete the task of ridding the world of the dear child. She was horrified to discover what she had been imagining, and presently imagined it all over again.|$|E

She controlled the five-minute showdown, maintaining her position with strong defense, refusing to budge or give her experienced foe a chance to mount a strong attack.

5000|$|Back then, abortions were illegal.

5000|$|Little {{documentation}} {{has been}} found about Calyork Records, a record label that Hecht, Lancaster and Buzzell operated together. The only known release by this record label is from 1958 (the two songs featured were published on April 15th of 1958).

50|$|The {{beginning}} of courtship is signaled by nest-building, and the eagle remaining near its nest. Aerial displays {{also play a}} major role in the courtship. These displays include paired soaring over a nesting territory, the male chasing the female in a diagonal dive, and mutual talon presentation, where the male presents his talons to the female's back and <b>she</b> <b>flips</b> over in midair to present her own talons. Advertisement displays coupled with loud calling have also been reported. The willingness of an eagle to breed is displayed by the eagle bringing nesting materials to the bird's nest. Copulation follows and occurs repeatedly both on the nest and on nearby perches. The earliest courtship has been reported in July.|$|R

She was extracted from the truck to a local hospital, but she survived with minor injuries. Fellow NASCAR driver Jeff Fuller would have an accident almost similar to this {{later in the year}} in a Busch series race at Kentucky when he spun to avoid a spinning Jason Leffler and slammed into an opening on the inside wall, only it was the passenger side door that was flattened, and he survived with minor injuries. Brad Keselowski was hired to drive in two races that her team was entered in, but that she could not race in due to her injury. Her best finish was a nineteenth at Gateway International Raceway.|$|E
5000|$|As Egypt {{struggled}} {{to build its}} own identity, people {{did not know whether}} to hold on to their old traditions or the new. Movements like Feminism appeared in Egypt but in its own variant. Egyptians chose to concentrate on women's power and status within the home and on breeding nationalist potency largely within the domestic sphere. In appealing to the more family-centered traditions of Arab kinship structures, Egyptian feminism marked itself out as separate and not imported from other foreign women’s liberation movements. Amir's identity that was strikingly outside the classic feminine image nationalists were attempting to build is however was underplayed by her rhetoric that focused on maternity and the idea of looking at [...] "Egypt as a family." [...] On the other hand, Amir's smart and well spoken dialogue about her position as a woman and filmmaker by smartly using the previously stated rhetoric to empower her own independence by stating [...] "I have one daughter and that is Egyptian Cinema". <b>She</b> <b>flipped</b> the national dialogue and themes of maternity upside down, strengthening her position as a working woman in the film industry.|$|E
5000|$|After June Byers {{retired in}} 1964, Moolah was {{subsequently}} recognized as official NWA Champion, thus making her the undisputed Women's World Champion. Nevertheless, Moolah dropped the belt on September 17, 1967 to Bette Boucher, although she regained the title just weeks later. She also traded the belt with Yukiko Tomoe during {{a tour of}} Japan in 1968. On July 1, 1972, Moolah {{became the first woman}} allowed to wrestle at Madison Square Garden, which had previously banned women's wrestling. In fact, Moolah helped overturn the ban on women's wrestling in the entire state of New York, which the New York State Athletic Commission lifted in June 1972. During her quest to overturn the ban, <b>she</b> <b>flipped</b> football player Roosevelt [...] "Rosey" [...] Grier onto his back on The Mike Douglas Show. Moolah continued an uninterrupted eight-year reign before losing to Sue Green at Madison Square Garden in 1976. Moolah regained her title a short time later. She also bought the legal rights to the championship in the late 1970s, and after losing the championship for two days to Evelyn Stevens in 1978, began another long reign, defending her title for another six years. Also in the 1970s, Moolah held the NWA Women's World Tag Team Championship twice with Toni Rose.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} three competing {{explanations of the}} empirical finding that people’s causal attributions are responsive to normative details, such as whether an agent’s action violated an injunctive norm—the intervention view, the bias view, and the responsibility view. We then present new experimental evidence concerning a type of case not previously investigated in the literature. In the switch version of the trolley problem, people judge that the bystander ought to flip the switch, but they also judge that she is more responsible for the resulting outcome when she does so than when she refrains. And, as predicted by the responsibility view, but not the intervention or bias views, {{people are more likely}} to say that the bystander caused the outcome when <b>she</b> <b>flips</b> the switch...|$|R

5000|$|The {{song was}} {{inspired}} by an actual incident, according to Wright. She told Billboard magazine that in mid-2003, she was driving in Nashville when a motorist in a minivan behind her noticed the Marine Corps sticker on the artist's bumper. Wright's brother is a Marine who sent her the sticker before he shipped off to Iraq. Wright said that the woman began honking, swerving and flicking her lights. [...] "I look in the rear view, and <b>she's</b> <b>flipping</b> me the bird, hard, I thought I cut her off, because I'm a really bad driver."

5000|$|There {{were two}} (completely different) professionally filmed music videos for the single. One is almost {{exclusively}} performance footage of Beck and her band, {{shot in a}} style used by many hair metal acts of the late 1980s. The other version is a [...] "concept" [...] video: At the beginning, Beck is seen in her bathroom, applying mascara and checking her hair, then makes a quick phone call. She goes through her apartment with scenes of her with her boyfriend. She looks out of a window before watching television (more scenes of her with her boyfriend). <b>She</b> <b>flips</b> through a magazine on the mantelpiece (more scenes), then makes another phone call. At {{the end of the}} video, the doorbell rings. Beck turns the television off and answers the door, but the person behind the door cannot be seen.|$|R
