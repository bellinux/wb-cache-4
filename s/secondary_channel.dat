40|$|International audienceTwo {{numerical}} models (1 D and 3 D) {{have been}} used to reproduce significant deposits that have been observed in two <b>secondary</b> <b>channels</b> located next to the Beurre island on the Rhône River, France.

Several issues also arose thanks to this modelling. Computation of discharge repartition in the two <b>secondary</b> <b>channels</b> appeared to have a strong impact on long-term estimation of fine sediment deposits, and is an interesting challenge for 1 D modelling. Discharges in the Rhône River above the one year return period flood yield approximately 50 % of the fine sediment mass transiting in the <b>secondary</b> <b>channels,</b> which represents approximately 1 % of the total SSM fluxes.

30|$|Several {{theoretical}} approaches rely on {{the existence}} of <b>secondary</b> <b>channels,</b> which can be opportunistically accessed. However, in practical cases and without assuming external knowledge, spectrum holes are dynamically formatted (both in size and spectrum location), rendering difficult the definition of convenient <b>secondary</b> <b>channels.</b> Such an obstacle can be overcome by obtaining knowledge on the initially unknown PU spectrum allocation and consequently, our methodology can efficiently contribute to this direction. This knowledge also enables SUs to estimate the expected length of white spaces that could potentially be detected at each band of interest and hence, determine transmission policies based on their communication needs. For instance, inferring technology channels of length equal to 200 kHz (e.g., GSM case) allows SUs to expect larger white spaces only at the cost of significantly higher reconfiguration overhead due to reasons explained in Section 5.2.|$|R

40|$|Recent multibeam {{bathymetry}} and {{acoustic imagery}} data provide {{a new understanding}} of the sedimentary system located in the Gulf of Cadiz which is under the influence of a strong current, the Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW). When it comes out from the Strait of Gibraltar, the MOW is either channelled along major or <b>secondary</b> <b>channels,</b> or spills over a sedimentary levee. Frequent earthquakes and the constant current shearing generate widespread sediment deformation and instability of contourite deposits. <b>Secondary</b> <b>channels</b> can form by retrogression following an initial failure. At their mouth, sediment accumulates in the form of small sandy contourite lobes. These observations suggest that the Gulf of Cadiz system shares many similarities with channel-levee complexes formed by turbidity current activity.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the generalized cognitive radio <b>channel</b> where the <b>secondary</b> user {{is allowed to}} reuse the frequency during both the idle and active periods of the primary user, {{as long as the}} primary rate remains the same. In this setting, the optimal power allocation policy with single-input single-output (SISO) primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>channels</b> is explored. Interestingly, the offered gain resulting from the frequency reuse during the active periods of the spectrum is shown to disappear in both the low and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. We then argue that this drawback in the high SNR region can be avoided by equipping both the primary and secondary transmitters with multiple antennas. Finally, the scenario consisting of SISO primary and multi-input multi-output (MIMO) <b>secondary</b> <b>channels</b> is investigated. Here, a simple Zero-Forcing approach is shown to significantly outperform the celebrated Decode-Forward-Dirty-Paper Coding strategy (especially in the high SNR regime) ...|$|R

40|$|We {{calculate}} secondary pairing in a {{model of}} a color superconductor with a quadratic gapless dispersion relation for the quasiquarks of the primary pairing. Our model mimics the physics of the sector of blue up and red strange quarks in gapless color-flavorlocked quark matter. The secondary pairing opens up a gap ∆s in the quark spectrum, and we confirm Hong’s prediction that in typical <b>secondary</b> <b>channels</b> ∆s ∝ G 2 s for coupling strength Gs. This shows that the large density of states of the quadratically gapless mode greatly enhances the secondary pairing over the standard BCS result ∆ ∝ exp(−const/G). In all of the <b>secondary</b> <b>channels</b> that we analyzed we find that the secondary gap, even with this enhancement, is from ten to hundreds of times smaller than the primary gap at reasonable values of the secondary coupling, indicating that secondary pairing does not generically resolve the magnetic instability of the gapless phase. ...|$|R
40|$|While {{there are}} {{continuous}} efforts to introduce new communication systems and standards, it is legitimate {{to ask the}} question: how can one send additional bits by minimally changing the systems that are already operating? This is of a significant practical interest, since it has a potential to generate additional value of the systems through, for example, introduction of new devices and only a software update of the access points or base stations, without incurring additional cost for infrastructure hardware installation. The {{place to look for}} such an opportunity is the communication protocol and we use the term *protocol coding* to refer to strategies for sending information by using the degrees of freedom available when one needs to decide the actions taken by a particular communication protocol. In this paper we consider protocol coding that gives a rise to *secondary communication channels*, defined by combinatorial ordering of the user resources (packets, channels) in a primary (legacy) communication system. We introduce communication models that enable us to compute the capacity of such <b>secondary</b> <b>channels</b> under suitable restrictions imposed by the primary systems. We first show the relation to the capacity of channels with causal channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), originally considered by Shannon. By using the specific communication setup, we develop an alternative framework for achieving the capacity and we discuss coding strategies that need to be used over the <b>secondary</b> <b>channels.</b> We also discuss some practical features of the <b>secondary</b> <b>channels</b> and their applications that add value to the existing wireless systems.
