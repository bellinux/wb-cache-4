In the preceding seven years, 466,962 horse-drawn vehicles had been sold, as against 277,035 automobiles, but the trend was all too clear. The regular manufacture of horse-drawn vehicles ended when Erskine ordered removal of the last wagon gear in 1919. To its range of cars, Studebaker would now add a truck line to replace the horse-drawn wagons. Buses, fire engines, and even small rail locomotive-kits were produced using the same powerful six-cylinder engines.|$|E

The survey was conducted on 300 <b>small</b> <b>farmers</b> of which 136 are microcredit users and the rest 164 are microcredit non-users.

500|$|Despite {{the falling}} demand and price for sheep {{products}} in many markets, sheep have distinct economic advantages {{when compared with}} other livestock. They do not require expensive housing, such as that used in the intensive farming of chickens or pigs. They are an efficient use of land; roughly six sheep can be kept on the amount that would suffice for a single cow or horse. Sheep can also consume plants, such as noxious weeds, that most other animals will not touch, and produce more young at a faster rate. Also, in contrast to most livestock species, the cost of raising sheep is not necessarily tied {{to the price of}} feed crops such as grain, soybeans and corn. Combined with the [...] lower cost of quality sheep, all these factors combine to equal a lower overhead for sheep producers, thus entailing a higher profitability potential for the <b>small</b> <b>farmer.</b> Sheep are especially beneficial for independent producers, including family farms with limited resources, as the sheep industry {{is one of the few}} types of animal agriculture that has not been vertically integrated by agribusiness.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Deforestation is {{a widely}} {{recognized}} problem in the Brazilian Amazon. <b>Small</b> <b>farmers</b> {{play a key role}} in this process in that they earn their livelihood by ranching and farming. Many studies have addressed the link between deforestation and livelihood strategies adopted by <b>small</b> <b>farmers.</b> Most have focused on advanced monitoring systems, simulation models, and GIS approaches to analyze the interaction of both dimensions, i. e., livelihoods and forest cover change. Although the current toolbox of methods has proved successful in increasing our understanding of these interactions, the models and approaches employed do not consider small farmers’ perspectives. On the assumption that local <b>small</b> <b>farmers</b> are agents of land-cover change, understanding how they perceive their own situation is essential to elucidate their actions. Our objective is to explore future changes in livelihood security and environmental sustainability as envisaged by local <b>small</b> <b>farmers</b> in the Brazilian Amazon. Previous livelihood cluster analysis of <b>small</b> <b>farmers</b> located in southeast Pará was integrated with fuzzy cognitive mapping to determine present perceptions and to explore future changes, using global scenarios downscaled to the local situation. Overall, system description differs only on details; all results indicate a strong trade-off between livelihood security and environmental sustainability in all livelihood systems, as identified by the <b>small</b> <b>farmers.</b> However, fundamentally different outcomes are obtained from the future analysis, depending on the livelihood strategy cluster. Achieving win-win outcomes does not necessarily imply a positive scenario, especially if <b>small</b> <b>farmers</b> are dependent on income transfers from the government to provide their livelihood...|$|R
