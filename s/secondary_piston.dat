5000|$|A {{reservoir}} above each {{master cylinder}} supplies the master cylinder with enough brake fluid to avoid air {{from entering the}} master cylinder (even the typical clutch uses brake fluid, {{but it may also}} be referred to as [...] "clutch fluid" [...] in a clutch applr). Each piston in a master cylinder operates a brake circuit, and for modern light trucks and passenger cars, usually a brake circuit leads to a brake caliper or shoe on only two of the vehicle's wheels, and the other brake circuit provides brake-pressure to slow down and stop the other two wheels. This is done in a diagonally split hydraulic system. If there is a hydraulic failure in the brake lines served by the master cylinder's <b>secondary</b> <b>piston</b> both pistons will move forward when the brakes are applied, but there is nothing to resist piston travel except the <b>secondary</b> <b>piston</b> spring. This lets the primary piston build up only a small amount of pressure until the <b>secondary</b> <b>piston</b> bottoms in the cylinder bore. Then the primary piston will build enough hydraulic pressure to operate the brakes served by this half of the system. In case of a hydraulic failure in the brake system served by the primary piston, the primary piston will move forward when the brakes are applied but will not build up hydraulic pressure. In this case very little force is transferred to the <b>secondary</b> <b>piston</b> through the primary piston spring until the piston extension screw comes in contact with the <b>secondary</b> <b>piston.</b> Then, pushrod force is transmitted directly to the <b>secondary</b> <b>piston</b> and enough pressure is built up to operate its brakes. Usually the 2 systems are split into left front and right rear comprising one system and right front and left rear comprising the other system. For safety, this is done so that usually only two wheels lose their braking ability {{at the same time and}} that both sides of the car have at least one braking system working and both ends of the car have at least one system working. With only 1 system working there is longer stopping distances and repairs should be done before driving again.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{secondary}} {{motion of}} a piston {{has a significant}} impact on the performance and reliability of an internal combustion engine. However, the variation in the system inertia, namely the variable inertia of the piston–connecting-rod–crankshaft mechanism due to the change in their positions relative to the crankshaft axis, has been neglected in most studies on <b>piston</b> <b>secondary</b> motion. A novel mathematical model is developed for piston–connecting-rod–crankshaft dynamics by taking the variation in the system inertia into consideration. Then a coupling model of the <b>piston</b> <b>secondary</b> dynamics and the fluid dynamic lubrication is built. The simulations show that the variation in the system inertia influences the <b>piston</b> <b>secondary</b> motion and <b>piston</b> side force, and that the piston side force plays an important role in determining the piston lateral motion. Results also show that the engine speed and the centre-of-mass (COM) positions of the connecting rod have considerable effect on the <b>piston</b> <b>secondary</b> motion. The analysis of the COM positions can be employed to optimize the design of the connecting rod...|$|R

40|$|Although rotary {{steerable}} {{systems have been}} evolving rapidly and delivering unprecedented rates of drilling penetration, drillers nevertheless seek technologies that further accelerate the drilling process. Currently, most down-hole motors with rotating drill bits are driven by positive displacement motors and down-hole turbine motors. These motors are classified {{depending on the type}} of power sections that are used to convert the hydraulic energy of high pressure fluids to mechanical energy in the form of torque output. In these designs, the power is transmitted from the power section to the drill bit through different mechanical arrangements, such as drive shafts, coupling assemblies, bearings, etc. During the transmission process, part of the developed torque is wasted, which reduces the efficiency. In addition, bearing stresses limit the transfer of possible forces to the drill bit. We proposed a novel concept to overcome these difficulties. The proposed concept is unique because of the combination of a linear electrical machine and gas springs. These gas springs allow the piston of the linear electrical machine to oscillate at different frequencies depending on the required load conditions. The characteristics of the high energy gas springs provide the opportunity to oscillate heavier piston with longer stroke lengths. A large electromagnetic force from permanent magnets and coils, in combination with gas springs, creates a high power linear electric actuator. The oscillating heavy piston causes a considerable vibration in the housing, which is utilized in the drilling application. The load can then be attached directly to the housing and the machine can be made hermitically sealed, which eliminates leakage problems. These features make the actuator suitable as a hammer in oil drilling applications. A linear permanent magnet actuator (oscillomotor) is an energy conversion device that integrates a linear permanent magnet (PM) machine and gas springs into a single unit. My research work mainly addresses the design criteria, analytical and finite element method (FEM) design calculations and dynamic analysis of the linear permanent magnet actuator with gas springs. The selection of a suitable linear PM machine configuration is very important to achieve the required demands, such as a compact diameter size, easy integration of gas springs, reduced losses to reduce heat generation, robustness, less maintenance and higher force from the starting position. Different linear PM machine configurations, such as flat, double flat, tubular longitudinal and transverse flux, are discussed for drilling applications. The tubular longitudinal flux configuration is selected as the most promising for drilling applications. This study analyses the selection of different mover configurations and different magnet patterns. Design parameters such as pole pitch, magnet width, stator inner diameter and air gap size are optimized based on the analytical analysis of force characteristics. The complete design process of the linear machine is discussed. Dynamic models of the linear actuator are developed. Three prototypes of the linear actuator are built to verify the novel concept and validate the force characteristics and dynamic modelling. The Force characteristics of the prototype I is verified with the FEM simulated results. Impact tests are carried out using prototype III. The test results shows the power input required at resonance is very low compared to the other frequencies. The impact force per amp at resonance is 9. 26 kN. The possibility of producing these higher power impacts at resonance, suitable for hard rock drilling. Drill test is carried out using prototype II. The Effect of feed force on the dynamic behaviour is discussed. The rate of penetration with different resonant frequencies and different weight on bits are discussed. This study also focuses on the suitability of this novel concept in other offshore applications, such as wireline jar applications and ocean wave power generation. Henceforth, this thesis describes the concept of the conversion of the movement of a float in a wave power plant, which is characterized by high force and low speed energy, to a high speed and low force energy in a linear generator by using gas springs. The simulation model shows that an oscillating piston that is supported by gas springs and is compressed and decompressed by a wave can convert more kinetic energy per volume from the float to a <b>secondary</b> <b>piston</b> compared to a <b>secondary</b> <b>piston</b> that is simply attached to the float. This model has not yet been validated with experimental work. According to the simulation results, the size of the generator can be reduced by a factor of 12 for the same power output compared to a buoy-connected piston...|$|E

50|$|The de Rivaz engine had no timing {{mechanism}} {{and the introduction}} of the fuel mixture and ignition were all under manual control. The compressed hydrogen gas fuel was stored in a balloon connected by a pipe to the cylinder. Oxygen was supplied from the air by a separate air inlet. Manually operated valves allowed introduction of the gas and air at the correct point in the cycle. A lever worked by hand moved a <b>secondary,</b> opposed, <b>piston.</b> This evacuated the exhaust gases, sucked in a fresh mixture and closed the inlet and exhaust valves. A Volta cell was used to ignite the gas within the cylinder by pressing an external button that created an electric spark inside the cylinder. The explosion drove the piston freely up the vertically mounted cylinder, storing the energy by lifting the heavy piston to an elevated position. The piston returned under its own weight and engaged a ratchet that connected the piston rod to a pulley. This pulley was in turn attached to a drum around which a rope was wound. The rope's other end was attached to a second drum on the charette's front wheels. The weight of the piston during its return down the cylinder was enough to turn the drums and move the charette. When the return stroke was over, the ratchet allowed the top drum to disconnect from the piston rod ready for the next powered lift of the piston.|$|R

40|$|Ever-increasing {{demand for}} {{reduction}} of the undesirable emissions from the internal combustion engines propels broader effort in auto industry to design more fuel efficient engines. One of the major focuses is the reduction of engine mechanical losses, to which the friction of the piston skirt is one important contributor. Yet there lacks a sufficient understanding of the skirt lubrication behavior to effectively optimize the piston skirt system in practice. The ultimate goal of this work {{is to develop a}} comprehensive model to advance the predictability of the skirt friction while integrating all the dynamic behavior of the <b>piston</b> <b>secondary</b> motion and the structural deformation of the piston skirt and cylinder liner. Major contributions of this work are analysis of and development of a model for the oil transport and exchange of the piston skirt region and its surroundings. The new oil transport model is composed with two elements. First, the oil scraped into the chamfer region by the oil control ring during a down-stroke is tracked and its accumulation and release to the skirt region are modeled. Second, oil separation and re-attachment are allowed in the skirt region, breaking conventional full-attachment assumption in lubrication studies. The new oil transport model together with hydrodynamic and boundary lubrication model were coupled with <b>piston</b> <b>secondary</b> motion and structural deformation of the piston skirt and cylinder liner. For numerical efficiency and physics clarity, we used different discretization for the lubrication from the structural deformation. The final model is robust and efficient. The discussion of the model results is focused mainly on the oil transport. There exist a general pattern in available oil for skirt lubrication, namely, skirt tends to be starved when it travels at the upper portion of a stroke. Comparison with visualization experiment for oil accumulation patterns show consistency between model prediction and observation. This work represents a major step forward to realistically predicting skirt friction and the influence of all the relevant design and operational parameters. However, oil supply to the region below the piston skirt can largely influence the outcome of the friction prediction and its mechanism is system dependent. Additionally, simple treatment of the oil transport in the current model is merely a first step to modeling the complex fluid problems involved. Improvements of this model based on application and further analysis will make it a more powerful engineering tool to optimize the skirt system to minimize its undesirable outputs. by Dongfang Bai.

A major concern {{at the time of}} the initial start up at the low loads and speed conditions is the wear of an engine. A significant proportion of the engine life gets compromised due to the adhesive engine start up wear. The start up wear does not exist during the normal engine operation due to the fully established elastohydrodynamic lubricating (EHL) film between the interacting surfaces of the piston assembly and the cylinder liner at the high loads, speeds and the optimum piston-to-bore radial clearances. Such arrangements do not exist in a few initial engine start up cycles. Resultantly, the piston skirts and the 1 st compression ring establish a physical contact with the liner and adhesive wear occurs. This PhD research work numerically models the lubrication of the piston skirts and the 1 st compression ring in the initial engine start up. The 2 -D hydrodynamic and EHL models of the piston skirts are developed in the initial engine start up conditions.

40|$|The {{contact between}} the piston ring and {{cylinder}} liner {{is the most important}} sealing interface in an automotive engine. Understanding the contact interactions and lubricant film formation at this interface is crucial for the development of fuel-efficient and low emission engines. This article outlines the development of an ultrasonic approach to enable non-invasive measurement of the lubricant film thickness formed between piston and cylinder wall of a fired engine. The sensor system consisted of a series of small, low cost piezoelectric elements which were bonded to the external surface of a four-stroke, single-cylinder engine. Each element could be individually energised with a short duration voltage pulse and reflections from the cylinder inner bore recorded. By using high frequency pulsing and data capture it proved possible to image individual ring and skirt contacts at full engine speeds. These captured reflections were processed to give lubricant film thickness directly and without the need for independent calibration. The results show good repeatability between cycle sets at specific running conditions. The lubricant films at each of the ring contacts can be measured at sufficient resolution such that individual rails of the oil control ring can be monitored.

40|$|Improving {{fuel economy}} of {{internal}} combustion engines {{is one of}} the major focuses in automotive industry. The piston ring friction contributes as much as 25 % of total mechanical loss in internal combustion engines [1] and is an area of great interests to the automotive industry in their overall effort to improve engine efficiency. However, typical methods to reduce friction loss from piston ring pack, such as ring tension reduction, may cause additional oil consumption. A compromise between reduction of friction loss and control of gas leakage and oil consumption needs to be made, which requires a deep understanding of oil transport mechanism. This compromise gives rise to the interest in modeling work. Both experimental results and previous experience showed that oil film distribution on the piston varies significantly along the circumference and the oil leakage occurs locally. Therefore to predict oil transfer across different ring pack regions, one needs to integrate both global and local processes. This work is aimed at establishing an enduring framework for all the cycle-based processes at different length scales. As a first step, a multi-scale multi-physics piston ring pack model was developed by coupling the structural dynamics of the piston rings with gas flows and local interactions at ring-groove and ring-liner interfaces. A curved beam finite element method was adopted to calculate the ring structural response to interaction between the ring and the liner as well as the ring and the groove. Compared to a traditional straight beam finite element method, the curved beam separates the structural mesh and contact grid by utilizing the shape functions. In this work, a multi-length-scale ring pack model was, for the first time, successfully assembled. This model bears its fundamental values to truly reflect the integral results of all the relevant mechanisms. The significance of the current work is that it demonstrated such an integration of all the length scales is possible for a cycle model with a reasonable computation cost. With the current model, one can realistically investigate the effects of all kinds of piston and liner distortion, <b>piston</b> <b>secondary</b> motion, bridging, and lube-oil dilution on gas sealing, oil transport and lubrication. As a result, optimization of the ring designs and the part of block design contributing to bore distortion can be coordinated to reduce development costs. by Yang Liu. Thesis: Ph.

This behavior varies along the ring's circumference and determining these variations is of utmost importance for developing ring-packs achieving desired performances in terms of sealing and conformability. This study based on straight beam model was already developed but does not consider the lubrication sub-models, the tip gap effects and the characterization of the ring free shape based on any final closed shape. In this work, three numerical curved beam based models were developed to study {{the performance of the}} piston ring-pack. The conformability model was developed to characterize the behavior of the ring within the engine. In this model, the curved beam model is adopted with considering ring-bore and ring-groove interactions. This interactions include asperity and lubrication forces. Besides, gas forces are included to the model along with the inertia and initial ring tangential load. In this model we also allow for bore, groove upper and lower flanks thermal distortion. We also take into account the thermal expansion effect of the ring and the temperature gradient from inner diameter (ID) to outer diameter (OD) effects. The <b>piston</b> <b>secondary</b> motion and the variation of oil viscosity on the liner with its temperature in addition to the existence of fuel and the different hydrodynamic cases (Partially and fully flooded cases) are considered as well. This model revealed the ring position relative to the groove depending on the friction, inertia and gas pressures. It also characterizes the effect of non-uniform oil distribution on the liner and groove flanks. Finally, the ring gap position within a distorted bore also reveals the sealing performance of the ring. Using the curved beam model we also developed a module determining the twist calculation under fix ID or OD constraint. The static twist is an experimental characterization of the ring during which the user taps on the ring till there is a minimum clearance between the ring lowest point and the lower plate all over the ring's circumference but without any force contact. Our last model includes four sub-models that relate the ring free shape, its final shape when subjected to a constant radial pressure (this final shape is called ovality) and the force distribution in circular bore. Knowing one of these distribution, this model determines the other two. This tool is useful {{in the sense that the}} characterization of the ring is carried out by measuring its ovality which is more accurate than measuring its free shape or force distribution in circular bore. Thus, having a model that takes the ovality as an input is more convenient and useful based on the experiments carried out to characterize the ring. by Mohamed Aziz Bhouri. Thesis: S.

40|$|Pour étudier la désinfection d'une eau usée épurée au stade secondaire, traitée à l'hypochlorite de sodium, des essais en réacteur fermé ont été effectués en utilisant des doses variant entre 1 et 10 mg de chlore par litre. Les résultats obtenus montrent que la cinétique de désinfection est loin d'être uniforme. L'utilisation du modèle de Chick et Watson n'est en effet {{possible}} que si on l'adapte pour tenir compte de la modification de la vitesse de désinfection au cours du processus. Le modèle de Collins et Selleck {{permet de}} rendre compte de façon satisfaisante de l'évolution de la vitesse d'élimination des germes au cours du temps. La faible valeur du paramètre t trouvée (0. 26 min. mg/l pour les coliformes totaux et 0. 58 min. mg/l pour les coliformes fécaux) semble cependant démontrer que la période de latence est relativement peut importante surtout lorsqu'on utilise des dose de chlore élevées. Il s'avère d'autre part que la demande en chlore de ce type d'eau est très importante. La concentration en chlore résiduel dans le réacteur décroît très rapidement pour atteindre environs 10 % de la dose de chlore injectée et cela quelle que soit la dose utilisée (de 1 à 10 mg/l). Le dimensionnement des réacteurs de désinfection fonctionnant en continu nécessite de prendre en compte le comportement hydrodynamique de l'eau dans le réacteur. Sachant qu'un abattement de 3 U-Log est nécessaire, dans le cas de la réutilisation de l'eau pour l'irrigation, un modèle intégrant l'expression de la cinétique de désinfection et l'hydrodynamique du contacteur a été proposé. Les résultats mettent en évidence l'intérêt de concevoir des réacteurs se rapprochant le plus possible de l'écoulement <b>piston.</b> <b>Secondary</b> wastewater is considered {{as an important}} additional resource of water in a country, which has a semiarid climate as Tunisia. On quality basis, the use of water for irrigation is governed by chemical parameters of the water that affect plant, soils conditions and the underlying groundwater. Treated urban wastewater is susceptible {{to be used in}} irrigation without major risks (see table 1). However, the use of such a water can represent a risk of contamination of edible crops, pasture lands, and feed crops by direct contact with disease agent carried in reclaimed water or aerosols from spray irrigation. These sanitary risks can be considerably reduced with the practice of an efficient disinfection. Chlorinating is one of the simplest and less expensive disinfection processes. The objectives of this work are the study of the disinfection kinetics and the rate of exertion of chlorine demand of water, when the sodium hypochlorite is used for treating a secondary wastewater. for this, a batch reactor tests have been done. After applying a dose of chlorine (between 1 and 10 mg/l), we have determined the evolution with time of chlorine residual concentration and rate of inactivation of the total and fecal coliform. Chlorine demandTo describe chlorine decay in the complex milieu of water, like wastewater, Haas and Karra (1984) have developed followed equation:C=C 0 [XE-k 1 t+(1 -X) e]-k 2 twhere:C : concentration of residual chlorine, mg/lC 0  : dose of chlorine, mg/lX : empirical constantt : contact time, mink 1 and k 2  : rate constants, min- 1 In the case of wastewater chlorinating, we can ascertain that the chlorine concentration in the batch reactor decrease rapidly, {{in the beginning of the}} reaction, and very moderately after satisfaction of the initial chlorine demand. This initial chlorine demand is very important. It represents near 90 % of the dose injected in the reactor. The chlorine concentration decay can be described by Haas and Karra equation with X= 0. 9, k 1 = 3 min- 1 and k 2 = 0. 001 min- 1. After some minutes of contact time, we can notes, see figure 2, that the chlorine concentration decay is susceptible to be approximate by a first order equation:t ≥ 2 min ⇒ C ≅ 0. 1 e- 0. 001 tThe concentration of residual chlorine becomes practically constant in the reactor, once initial chlorine demand has been satisfied, with C ≅ 0. 1 C 0. Disinfection kineticsUsing a pseudo first order Chick and Watson model reveals that the rate of inactivation of coliform bacteria is not uniform. We can employ this model to fit experimental data only when we subdivide the process in two stages characterised by different kinetics. for example, the logarithm of fecal coliform survival rate can be expressed by the relationships:for C ∙ t ≤ 2. 85 min ∙ mg/L Ln(N/N 0) = - 1. 65 C ∙ tfor C ∙ t ≥ 2. 85 min ∙ mg/L Ln(N/N 0) = - 3. 89 - 0. 29 C⋄tCollins and Selleck (1972) developed a general kinetic expression for the effect of combined chlorine residual on both total and fecal coliform. Combining the work of chick and Gard (Gard, 1957) they developed the following formula describing the survival of these bacteria:for C∙t τ (N/N 0) =(τ/C∙t) nwhere C : the combined chlorine residual, mg/lt : contact time, minutet : an environmental coefficient or induction timen : Constant In this formula, we have assumed that the concentration of chlorine remains constant. We can apply this model when we consider that C is the chlorine concentration after the immediate wastewater demand had been satisfied. Using Collins and Selleck disinfection model to plot the survival rate of total and fecal coliform in chlorinated secondary effluent, we have obtained the coefficients below: for total coliform : n= 1. 94 t= 0. 26 min∙mg/lfor fecal coliform : n= 3. 1 t= 0. 58 min∙mg/lThe constant τ represents the time required for the disinfectant to diffuse through the cell wall and begin its disinfectant activity. we can see that this initial lag time is very short. The disinfectant becomes rapidly efficacious to inactivate coliform bacteria. Design of disinfectant contact facilitiesSo as to estimate the influence of the hydraulic efficiency of chlorine contact chambers on disinfection process performance, we have compared efficiency of two ideals reactors: the completely stirred tank reactor and plug flow reactor. The kinetic equations presented above had been established in a batch reactor. To obtain the mean conversion in the entire contactor, one has to apply the segregated flow model. Using the concept of segregated flow system, the survival ratio will be the sum of the batch reactions of all small aggregates, or:           ∞(N/N 0) =∫(N/N 0) batchE(Ɵ) dƟ            0 Ɵ : normalized contact time (contact time/hydraulic residence time) E(Ɵ)  : normalized frequency distribution of agesIn completely mixed regime, fluid particles are exponentially distributed throughout a tank until the fluid properties exhibited by the effluent leaving the unit are identical to those within the unit. Using Collins and Selleck model, the survival ratio corresponding to hydraulic residence time Ts and to the residual chlorine concentration C is expressed by equation:           ∞                      (τ/C∙Ts)            ∞(N/N 0) =∫(N/N 0) batche-ƟdƟ = ∫ e-ƟdƟ + ∫ (τ/C∙t) me-ƟdƟ            0                              0          (τ/C∙Ts) The survival ratio for a hydraulic residence times between 5 min and 60 min and a residual chlorine concentration between 0. 2 mg/l and 1 mg/l are reported in table 3 and table 4. In a plug flow regime all particles entering in a basin have equal velocity values, travel on parallel flow paths, and remain in the unit for an identical period known as the hydraulic residence time. the performance of such a reactor is identical at the batch reactor performance. In table 5 and table 6 we have reported the survival ratio given by plug flow reactor with residence time until 60 min and residual chlorine concentration between 0. 2 mg/l and 1 mg/l. Knowing that the secondary wastewater reuse necessitates a 3 U-Log fecal coliform inactivation, we can see clearly the importance of reactor design on his performance. Indeed, to reach a 3 U-log inactivation, it is sufficient (see table 6) to use a dose of 2 mg/l of chlorine and a hydraulic residence time of 30 minutes, in plug flow reactor. Such dose and the same residence time given only a 1 U -Log inactivation (see table 4) when the reactor is completely mixed...|$|R
