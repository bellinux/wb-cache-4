5000|$|The {{beta decay}} from 137Cs to 137mBa {{is a strong}} {{emission}} of gamma radiation. [...] 137Cs and 90Sr are the principal medium-lived products of nuclear fission, and the prime <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>radioactivity</b> from spent nuclear fuel {{after several years of}} cooling, lasting several hundred years. Those two isotopes are the largest <b>source</b> <b>of</b> residual <b>radioactivity</b> {{in the area of the}} Chernobyl disaster. Because of the low capture rate, disposing of 137Cs through neutron capture is not feasible and the only current solution is allowed to decay over time.|$|R
50|$|The <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>radioactivity</b> are not {{exclusive}} of human activity. The natural radioactivity {{does not come}} from human sources: it covers up to ¾ <b>of</b> the total <b>radioactivity</b> in the world and has its origins in the interaction of terrestrial elements with high energy cosmic rays (cosmogenic radionuclides) or in the existing materials on Earth since its formation (primordial radionuclides). In this regard, there are differences in the levels <b>of</b> <b>radioactivity</b> throughout the Earth's crust. India and mountains like the Alps are among the areas with the highest level <b>of</b> natural <b>radioactivity</b> due to their composition of rocks and sand.|$|R
50|$|In {{a nuclear}} power reactor, the main sources of {{radioactivity}} are fission products, actinides and activation products. Fission products are the largest <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>radioactivity</b> for the first several hundred years, while actinides are dominant roughly 103 to 105 years after fuel use.|$|E
50|$|C-14 {{has been}} {{chosen as the}} <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>radioactivity</b> mainly because its beta {{particle}} radiation is easily absorbed by any solid. The use of diamond, {{one of the hardest}} solids on earth, will not only increase the quantity of current generated but will also prevent dangerous radiation from leaking out of the battery.|$|E
5000|$|... 40K {{occurs in}} natural {{potassium}} (and thus in some commercial salt substitutes) {{in sufficient quantity}} that large bags of those substitutes {{can be used as}} a radioactive source for classroom demonstrations. In healthy animals and people, 40K represents the largest <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>radioactivity,</b> greater even than 14C. In a human body of 70 kg mass, about 4,400 nuclei of 40K decay per second.|$|E
50|$|In neutron, X-ray, and {{gamma ray}} optics, a {{collimator}} is {{a device that}} filters a stream of rays so that only those traveling parallel to a specified direction are allowed through. Collimators are used in neutron, X-ray, and gamma-ray optics {{because it is not}} yet possible to focus radiation with such short wavelengths into an image through the use of lenses as is routine with electromagnetic radiation at optical or near-optical wavelengths. Collimators are also used with radiation detectors in nuclear power stations for monitoring <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>radioactivity.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 40K is {{the largest}} <b>source</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>radioactivity</b> in animals {{including}} humans. A 70 kg human body contains about 140 grams of potassium, hence about 0.000117 × 140 = 0.0164 grams of 40K; whose decay produces about 4,300 disintegrations per second (becquerels) continuously throughout {{the life of the}} body.|$|R

50|$|In addition, {{the waste}} from a breeder reactor has a {{different}} decay behavior, because it {{is made up of}} different materials. Breeder reactor waste is mostly fission products, while light water reactor waste has a large quantity of transuranics. After spent nuclear fuel has been removed from a light water reactor for longer than 100,000 years, these transuranics would be the main <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>radioactivity.</b> Eliminating them would eliminate much of the long-term radioactivity from the spent fuel.|$|E
50|$|Disintegrations {{per minute}} (dpm) and disintegrations per second (dps) are {{measures}} of {{the activity of the}} <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>radioactivity.</b> The SI unit of radioactivity, the becquerel (Bq), is equivalent to one disintegration per second. This unit {{should not be confused with}} cps, which is the number of counts received by an instrument from the source. One dps (one dpm) is the number of atoms that have decayed in one second (one minute), not the number of atoms that have been measured as decayed.|$|E

40|$|On {{account of}} the low grain size three {{commercial}} emulsions GEVAERT NUC 307, ILFORD L 4 and KODAK NTE have been investigated to assess their qualities for electron microscope microautoradiography. Grain size distribution curves were determined and a developer suitable for microautoradiography was selected after having tested different types of developers. In order to investigate the sensitivities of the three emulsions monolayer preparations were irradiated in the electron microscope using an energy of 5. 7 keV, corresponding to the mean &# 946;-energy of Tritium. After exposure the specimens were developed but left unfixed. The sensitivity may then be determined, using the ratio of developed to {{the total number of}} grains. For the formation of one latent image the ILFORD L 4 emulsion must be hit on the average by 1 - 1. 4 electrons per AgBr-grain; the corresponding figures for GEVAERT NUC 307 and KODAK NTE are 2 - 3 and 4 - 5, respectively.

40|$|The {{explosion}} at Unit 4 of the Chernobyl {{nuclear power station}} was the worstnuclear accident in history. Radioactive fallout from the accident (directly or indir-ectly) a�ected the lives {{of hundreds of thousands}} of people in the former SovietUnion and contamination spread throughout Europe. In the 19 years since theaccident, thousands of scienti®c papers have been published on Chernobyl and itsconsequences. In this book we have tried to summarise this vast literature, focusingparticularly on the long-term consequences of the accident to people and theenvironment. There are many historical accounts of the Chernobyl accident (e. g., Shcherbak, 1989; IAEA, 1991; UNSCEAR, 2000; Mould, 2000; Kryshev and Ryazantsev, 2000;OECD/NEA, 2002). Whilst this book focuses primarily on the longer term impactsof the accident, here we brie¯y summarise the history of the accident and itsimmediate consequences. In particular, we aim to put Chernobyl within thecontext of other (natural and man-made) <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>radioactivity</b> in the environ-ment. This chapter also introduces some key concepts and units of radiation meas-urement and risk assessment. Many of these will be familiar to some readers, and aretherefore where possible included in boxes separate from the main text...|$|R

50|$|It was Sweden's {{search for}} the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>radioactivity</b> (after they had {{determined}} there was no leak at the Swedish plant) {{that led to the}} first hint of a serious nuclear problem in the Western Soviet Union. In France, the government then claimed that the radioactive cloud had stopped at the Italian border.

Hence the evacuation of Pripyat on 27 April, 36 hours after the initial explosions, was silently completed before the disaster became known outside the Soviet Union. The rise in radiation levels had at that time already been measured in Finland, but a civil service strike delayed the response and publication.|$|E

40|$|Experiments {{designed}} to study rare processes, such as neutrinoless double beta decay (0 νββ), are crucial tests for physics beyond the standard model. These experiments rely on reducing the intrinsic radioactive background to unprecedented levels, while adequately shielding the detectors from external <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>radioactivity.</b> An understanding <b>of</b> {{the potential for}} neutron excitation of the shielding and detector materials is important for obtaining this level of sensitivity. Using the broad-spectrum neutron beam at LANSCE, we have measured inelastic neutron scattering on ^natCu. The goal of this work is focused on understanding the background rates from neutrons interacting in these materials in regions around the Q-values of many candidate 0 νββ decay isotopes, {{as well as providing}} data for benchmarking Monte Carlo simulations of background events. Results: We extracted the level cross sections from the γ production cross section for 46 energy levels in ^natCu. These level cross sections were compared with the available experimental data, as well as the ENDF/B-VII evaluation for discrete levels. We also examined the potential implications of our measurements on 0 νββ measurements and found that many of the commonly studied 0 νββ isotopes had Q-values below the cutoff for ENDF/B-VII evaluated discrete levels in either Cu nucleus.

40|$|The {{safety of}} food and {{protection}} of the environment continue to be important issues. Radioactivity in the environment and its entry into the foodchain is potentially a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> harm to the public and therefore, regular surveys <b>of</b> <b>radioactivity</b> in food and environmental materials are conducted to assess the exposure of the public to <b>radioactivity.</b> Results <b>of</b> these surveys are made available through publications, such as this report and regular updates on the Food Standards Agency Web site. This report presents the scope and results of the Food Standards Agency and Scottish Environment Protection Agency’s radiological surveillance programmes conducted in 2000. In England and Wales the Environment Agency survey non-food pathways, and their publication is complementary to this report. The Food Standards Agency and Scottish Environment Protection Agency undertake measurements in samples from around nuclear sites and other potential <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> elevated <b>radioactivity</b> throughout the United Kingdom.

50|$|The major natural <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>radioactivity</b> {{in plant}} tissue is potassium: 0.0117% of the {{naturally}} occurring potassium is the unstable isotope potassium-40 (40K).

Plants naturally contain radioactive carbon-14 (14C), but in a banana containing 15 grams of carbon this would give off only about 3 to 5 beta rays per second. Since a typical banana contains about half a gram of potassium, it will have an activity of roughly 15 Bq. Although the amount in a single banana is small in environmental and medical terms, the radioactivity from a truckload of bananas is capable of causing a false alarm when passed through a Radiation Portal Monitor used to detect possible smuggling of nuclear material at U.S. ports.|$|E

30|$|In addition, <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>radioactivity</b> {{completely}} independent <b>of</b> {{the patient}} can generate a background radiation: for example, in LSO- or LYSO-based PET scanners, a small background of 176 Lu radiation {{can be seen}} when the PET signal in the patient is extremely low, as in 90 Y imaging. LSO contains 2.6  % of 176 Lu, a radioactive isotope that decays β− into 176 Hf with a cascade of γ photons in coincidence, with 307 -, 202 -, and 88 -keV energies. A coincidence of a β− in a detector and two photons (307  keV[*]+[*] 202  keV) in another is unlikely but possible (Fig.  4 b). The 176 Lu β− in a detector generates about 5000 single counts per second per block or a total random counts of about 1100  s− 1 in a four-ring Biograph mCT [49, 50]. This is a small but not negligible background for some applications at a very low count rate, such as with 90 Y imaging. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that randoms can be properly measured and corrected using standard random correction, even for 90 Y imaging [50]. From {{the point of view}} of net true coincidence rate, after random subtraction, about 1 to 5 total count/s have been measured in the same four-ring LSO-based mCT when no source was present [49, 50].|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{methods to}} {{determine}} the proportion of cells in S-phase use radiolabeled precursors of DNA, such as 3 H-thymidine, which become incorporated into DNA during its synthesis and are visualized either in tissue sections or in cell preparations by autoradiography. At the Harwell Laboratory the effects of inhaled a-emitting actinides on the pulmonary alveolar macrophage population ofthe rodent lung are being studied. For this research {{the use of an}} autoradiographic technique {{to determine the}} proportion of cells in S-phase is inappropriate, because ofthe possible presence <b>of</b> competing <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>radioactivity</b> in the cells under investigation.

Fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibodies, highly specific for BrdU substituted DNA, are available commercially and may be used as a probe for BrdU-labeled cells. This technique for identifying cells in S-phase has been described previously for the flow cytometric analysis of cell suspensions and for cells in tissue sections. An adaptation of this technique for use on cytocentrifuge preparations of cells recovered from mouse lung by bronchoalveolar lavage has been developed and its use is described.
