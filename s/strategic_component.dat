5|$|The Pye strip {{was such}} an advance on the EMI unit that the EF50 became a key <b>strategic</b> <b>component.</b> As a German {{invasion}} of the west loomed in 1940, the British contacted Philips and arranged a plan to remove the company's board of directors to the UK, along with 25,000 more EF50s and another 250,000 bases, onto which Mullard, Philip's UK subsidiary, could build complete tubes. A destroyer, , was dispatched {{to pick them up}} in May, and left the Netherlands only days before the German invasion on 15 May 1940. The Pye strip, and its 45MHz intermediate frequency, would be re-used in many other wartime radar systems.|$|E

40|$|Electronic {{customer}} relationship management (eCRM) is becoming increasingly important as organizations seek to deliver their services and information {{as well as to}} provide transactional facilities via online and wireless platforms, in additional to the more traditional means of communication channels. However, relatively little research has examined how organizations evaluate their eCRM systems. We take a multi-case study approach to: (1) develop an integrated framework to assist organizations in evaluating their eCRM; and (2) present factors and guidelines that can assist senior managers in implementing their eCRM so organizations can better manage their investment and improve their long term profitability. One important outcome of this research is the development of an integrated eCRM critical success factors (CSFs), benefits, costs, and risks framework which enables organizations to examine their relationships in the context of eCRM implementation. The framework provides some general guidelines for implementing eCRM which enables organizations {{to pay attention to the}} strategic alignment relationships between the four <b>strategic</b> <b>components</b> as well as to consider the possible benefits, costs, and risks which will arise from the CSFs of these <b>strategic</b> <b>components...</b>|$|R

The scoring system attempted to make up for this, awarding higher points for faster victories. In pursuit of a higher score the player is forced to seek out and attack the barbarian units on terms that might not be as favorable, and without quick retreats after combat, might result in encirclement or exhaustion.|$|E

50|$|In the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War Salazar’s dislike of the Nazi regime in Germany and its imperial ambitions was tempered only by his view of the German Reich as a bastion against the spread of communism. He had favoured the Spanish nationalist cause, fearing a communist invasion of Portugal, yet he was uneasy at the prospect of a Spanish government bolstered by strong ties with the Axis. Salazar's policy of neutrality for Portugal in World War II thus included a <b>strategic</b> <b>component.</b> The country still held overseas territories that, because of their poor economic development, could not adequately defend themselves from military attack. Upon the start of World War II in 1939, the Portuguese Government announced, on 1 September, that the 600-year-old Anglo-Portuguese Alliance remained intact, but that since the British did not seek Portuguese assistance, Portugal was free to remain neutral in the war and would do so. In an aide-mémoire of 5 September 1939, the British Government confirmed the understanding.|$|E
