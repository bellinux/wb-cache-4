50|$|Another {{important}} {{advantage of}} biocatalysts {{are that they}} are environmentally acceptable, being completely degraded in the environment.

40|$|Development of {{photochemistry}} in macroscopic {{batch reaction}} vessels is hampered due to inherent limitations: light penetration remains superficial, resulting in inhomogeneous irradiation and hence to <b>side-reactions</b> or product degradation due to overexposure. The recent implementation of photochemical processes in microreactors under continuous-flow conditions {{appeared to be}} much more powerful than its batch analogue in terms of irradiation efficiency and light penetration. Furthermore, the fine control of residence time ensures an accurate control of the irradiation time, avoiding <b>side-reactions</b> and degradation. The photooxidation of (L) -methionine with singlet oxygen using Rose Bengal as a sensitizer was successfully implemented in a microreactor setup and led to total and selective conversion into methionine sulfoxide, an important building block for the organic synthesis of peptides or functionalized amino acid. The reaction was performed in 1 min while the same reaction in batch took 2 h. Peer reviewe...|$|R
50|$|Conversely, a Kumada {{coupling}} using vinylic Grignard reagents proceeds without stereospecificity to form {{a mixture}} of cis- and trans-alkenes. The degree of isomerization is dependent {{on a variety of}} factors including reagent ratios and the identity of the halide group. According to Kumada, this loss of stereochemistry is attributable to <b>side-reactions</b> between two equivalents of the allylic Grignard reagent.|$|R

50|$|The {{reaction}} {{offers a}} wide scope for both diazonium component and arene component but yields are generally low following the original procedure (less than 40%), given the many <b>side-reactions</b> of diazonium salts. Several improvements have been suggested. One possibility is to employ diazonium tetrafluoroborates in arene solvent {{together with a}} phase-transfer catalyst, another is to use 1-aryl-3,3-dialkyltriazenes.|$|R
5000|$|Chemoselectivity: Since {{the purpose}} of an enzyme is to act on a single type of {{functional}} group, other sensitive functionalities, which would normally react {{to a certain extent}} under chemical catalysis, survive.

5000|$|In {{terms of}} the {{reaction}} mechanism, hydroacylation begins with oxidative addition of the aldehydic carbon-hydrogen bond. The resulting acyl hydride complex next binds the alkene. The sequence of oxidative addition and alkene coordination is often unclear. Via migratory insertion, the alkene inserts into either the metal-acyl or the metal-hydride bonds. In the final step, the resulting alkyl-acyl or beta-ketoalkyl-hydride complex undergoes reductive elimination. A competing <b>side-reaction</b> is decarbonylation of the aldehyde.

30|$|The reverse and <b>side-reactions</b> {{involving}} {{the reduction of}} 2 -octanone to (S)- 2 -octanol catalyzed by the whole cell S. cerevisiae, led to low yield and product e.e. value.

5000|$|A {{commonly}} encountered <b>side-reaction</b> in Wolff-Kishner reductions involves azine formation by {{reaction of}} hydrazone with the carbonyl compound. Formation of the ketone can be suppressed by vigorous exclusion of water during the reaction. Several of the presented procedures require {{isolation of the}} hydrazone compound prior to reduction. This can be complicated by further transformation of the product hydrazone to the corresponding hydrazine during product purification. Cram found that azine formation is favored by rapid addition of preformed hydrazones to potassium tert-butoxide in anhydrous dimethylsulfoxide.|$|E
50|$|Carbene dimerization {{is a type}} {{of organic}} {{reaction}} in which two carbene or carbenoid precursors react in a formal dimerization to an alkene. This reaction is often considered an unwanted <b>side-reaction</b> but it is also investigated as a synthetic tool. In this reaction type either the two carbenic intermediates react or a carbenic intermediate reacts with a carbene precursor. An early pioneer was Christoph Grundmann reporting on a carbene dimerisation in 1938. In the domain of persistent carbenes the Wanzlick equilibrium describes an equilibrium between a carbene and its alkene.|$|E
5000|$|The Dowd-Beckwith ring-expansion {{reaction}} is an organic reaction {{in which a}} cyclic β-keto ester is expanded by up to 4 carbons in a free radical ring expansion reaction through an α-alkylhalo substituent [...] The radical initiator system is based on AIBN and tributyltin hydride. The cyclic β-keto ester can be obtained through a Dieckmann condensation. The original reaction consisted of a nucleophilic aliphatic substitution of the enolate of ethyl cyclohexanone-2-carboxylate with 1,4-diiodobutane and sodium hydride followed by ring expansion to ethyl cyclodecanone-6-carboxylate. A <b>side-reaction</b> is organic reduction of the iodoalkane.|$|E
