[...] After discussing the crash with Dylan, biographer Robert Shelton concluded that he [...] "was saying there must be another way of life for the pop star, in which he is in control, not they.

He did just enough work to pass his final examinations {{in the summer of}} 1924 with a third-class. However, as he had begun at Hertford in the second term of the 1921–22 academic year, Waugh had completed only eight terms' residence when he sat his finals, rather than the nine required under the university's statutes. His poor results led to the loss of his scholarship, which made it impossible for him to return to Oxford for that final term, so he left without his degree.|$|E

In the same way, it's a totally different world. In , it's more sci-fi oriented and crazy colors. More of a comedy kind of take on things as well. This one is a little bit more serious. It's also a little bit more trippy. We use very different techniques, actually. Guardians was also for us a huge animation film. This one was less of it. This one was more about the environments and effects".|$|E

[...] He read the script and found it to be [...] "very well written, comprehensive but you really had to have Chris in person, to try to articulate <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> have been swirling around his head for the last eight years."
