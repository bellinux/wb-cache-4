40|$|Marine {{propulsion}} {{plants can}} experience large power fluctuations during tight maneuvers, with increases of shaft torque {{up to and}} over 100 % of the steady values in straight course and considerable asymmetry between internal and external shafts during turning circle. This phenomenon (studied in Viviani et al 2007 a and 2007 b), can be of particular interest for twin screw ships propulsion systems with coupled <b>shaftlines,</b> in which asymmetrical loads can represent a challenge for the whole propulsion system (e. g. unique reduction gear, <b>shaftlines,</b> automation). A joint research {{has been set up}} in order to deeply investigate the phenomenon, by means of large scale model testing and related numerical simulations. In the present work, preliminary simulation results with different simplified automation systems and with an automation system more similar to the real one are reported, allowing to get a better insight into this complex problem...|$|R

Unlike Aiviq, the new vessels would have been fitted with Rolls-Royce azimuth thrusters instead of conventional <b>shaftlines</b> and rudders. However, in November 2015 it {{was reported}} that Edison Chouest might have canceled the vessels following Shell's decision to halt Arctic oil exploration.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the simulation approach developed {{to evaluate the}} interaction between sailing and motor propulsion of a tall ship. In particular, the study {{is focused on the}} computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of the wind thrust action on the sails. CFD modelling has been used because of the lack on scientific literature of the performance assessment of a square soft sail, especially if the interference among the several sails has to be considered. CFD results are discussed and then properly arranged to develop a propulsion simulator, able to provide interesting information on the whole ship performance. In sailing propulsion mode, it is worth paying attention also to the effect of the trailing propeller on the <b>shaftline</b> dynamics, mainly for reasons due to the efficiency reduction of the oil lubrication system at low revolutions. The final goal of the present work is to propose material and methods to find out and set up innovative control logics, in order to optimise the particular motor-sailing propulsion of the tall ship...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{comprehensive}} approach to simulate the propulsion system behaviour of a ship during transients and off design conditions {{is presented in the}} paper. The system behaviour is described by a numerical model, developed in MATLABSIMULINK ® environment, already tested and validated with reference to different ship types and operating situations. The model may be simply adapted to different applications because of its modular architecture, allowing an extremely easy and gradual growth in complexity, for instance including accurate (thermodynamic) engine modules and ship manoeuvrability modules. A library of ‘blocks’ already available is used to represent the propulsion plant elements (engine, governor, gear, <b>shaftline,</b> propeller, hull, etc.) with a different degree of accuracy in relation to the concerned application. The system of algebraic and differential equations linking together the selected modules and representing the propulsion system mathematical model, is solved in the time domain by means of different available MATLAB® solvers. The application presented in this paper concerns a small naval vessel, a corvette of 1500 tons displacement, whose propulsion plant consists of a twin shaft arrangement with controllable pitch propellers. Each shaft is driven, through reduction gears, by a sequentially-turbocharged medium speed diesel engine. The presented model has been validated by comparing the simulation results with steady state manufacturer experimental data, for the diesel engine, and with ‘ad-hoc’ full scale measurements of propulsion plant and ship parameters, relative to off-design and transient operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{analysis of}} displacement of a crankshaft axis caused by temperature of marine, slow-speed main engine. Information of thermal displacement {{of a power}} transmission system axis is significant during a shaft line alignment and a crankshaft springing analysis. Warmed-up main engine {{is a source of}} deformations of an engine body as well as a ship hull in the area of an engine room and hence axis of a crankshaft and a <b>shaftline.</b> Engines 2 ̆ 7 producers recommend the model of parallel displacement of the crankshaft axis under the influence of an engine heat. The model gives us the value (one number!) of the crankshaft axis displacement in the hot propulsion system 2 ̆ 7 s condition. This model may be too simple in some cases. Presented numerical analyses are based on temperature measurements of the main engine body and the ship hull during a sea voyage. The paper presents computations of MAN B&W K 98 MC type engine (power: 40000 kW, revolutions: 94 rpm) mounted on 4500 TEU container ship (length: 290 m). Propulsion system is working in nominal, steady-state conditions; it is the basic assumption during the analyses. Numerical analyses were preformed with usage of Nastran software based on Finite Element Method. The FEM model of the engine body comprised over 800 thousand degree of freedom. Stiffness of the ship hull (mainly double bottom) with the foundation was modelled by a simple cuboid. Material properties of that cuboid were determined on the base of separately performed calculations...|$|E
2500|$|Robert LeMeur had a diesel-mechanical {{propulsion}} system with two diesel engines driving [...] controllable pitch propellers in nozzles. The main engines were supercharged 12-cylinder MaK 12M453 medium-speed diesel engines rated at [...] each. The engines were fitted with oversized flywheels {{to increase the}} inertia of the {{propulsion system}} against ice impact. The <b>shaftlines</b> were placed so {{close to each other}} that the nozzles in the stern were actually joined together. Onboard electricity was generated by four Caterpillar D399 auxiliary generating sets. For maneuvering, Robert Lemeur had twin rudders with a maximum turning angle of 45 degrees and two transverse bow thrusters.|$|R
2500|$|Nordica is {{propelled}} by two Aquamaster US ARC 1 Z-drive azimuth thrusters with [...] ducted fixed-pitch stainless steel propellers. The 177-ton thrusters, driven by ABB Strömberg AC/AC propulsion motors rated at 7,500kW, considerably improve the maneuverability of the icebreaker. This is especially useful during escort and assistance operations in difficult ice conditions when the icebreaker has {{to operate at}} close proximity to other vessels at low speeds. When delivered, {{she was the first}} large icebreaker to be equipped with such propulsion system and her maneuverability was often described to be superior to older icebreakers with traditional <b>shaftlines</b> and rudders. Together with three 1,150kW Brunvoll FU-80 LTC-2250 variable-pitch bow thrusters the azimuth thrusters also allow dynamic positioning during offshore operations.|$|R

The unique stands for testing the developed new technologies of the propeller-deidwood complexes have been created. The tests have been performed on all stages, i. e., from the stage of design to the five-year operating tests of the ships with the propeller-deidwood complexes (PDC), having no analogs in the world ships building. The new priority analytic dependences have been received {{in the fields of}} building mechanics, tribotechnique, the theories of the ship <b>shaftlines</b> centering and not-demountable evaluation of its technical condition. The rational field of the PDC work from the power engineering, tribotechnique, ecology, fliet fighting capacity improvement, has been established.

40|$|Fault {{identification}} {{in industrial}} machine {{is a topic}} of major importance under engineering point of view. In fact, the possibility to identify not only the type, but also the severity and {{the position of a}} fault occurred along a shaft-line allows quick maintenance and shorten the downtime. This is really important in the power generation industry where the units are often of several tenths of meters long and where the rotors are enclosed by heavy and pressure-sealed casings. In this paper, an industrial experimental case is presented related to the identification of the unbalance on a large size steam turbine of about 1. 3 GW, belonging to a nuclear power plant. The case history is analyzed by considering the vibrations measured by the condition monitoring system of the unit. A model-based method in the frequency domain, developed by the authors, is introduced in detail and it is then used to identify the position of the fault and its severity along the <b>shaftline.</b> The complete model of the unit (rotor – modeled by means of finite elements, bearings – modeled by linearized damping and stiffness coefficients and foundation – modeled by means of pedestals) is analyzed and discussed before being used for the fault identification. The assessment of the actual fault was done by inspection during a scheduled maintenance and excellent correspondence was found with the identified one by means of authors’ proposed method. Finally a complete discussion is presented about the effectiveness of the method, even in presence of a not fine tuned machine model and considering only few measuring planes for the machine vibration...|$|E
2500|$|Tempera and {{her sister}} ship are the first tankers {{propelled}} by ABB Azipod electric azimuth thrusters capable of rotating 360 degrees around the vertical axis. The pulling-type VI2500 pods in these two ships, with a nominal output of 16 MW and [...] fixed-pitch propellers turning at 86 rpm, are the most powerful ice-strengthened Azipod units ABB has ever produced. The forward-facing propeller increases the propulsion efficiency due to optimal water flow to the propeller and thus improves fuel efficiency. In addition an azimuthing thruster's ability to direct thrust to any direction also results in excellent manoeuvrability characteristics that exceeds those of ships utilizing traditional mechanical <b>shaftlines</b> and rudders. The turning circle of Mastera and Tempera is only half a kilometer at full speed, half of that of a traditional oil tanker of the same size. This is a significant safety factor as the stopping distance of a traditional tanker can be up to [...]|$|R
40|$|Twin screw ships may {{experience}} considerably asymmetric propeller functioning during manoeuvres. This phenomenon {{may result in}} large power fluctuations during tight manoeuvres, with increases of shaft torque up to and over 100 % of the steady values in straight course and considerable unbalances; this, in its turn, may be potentially dangerous, especially in case of particularly complex propulsion plant configurations, such as those with coupled <b>shaftlines.</b> A joint research project supported by the Italian Navy {{has been set up}} in order to deeply investigate the phenomenon, by means of large scale model testing and related numerical simulations. In the present work, the extensive experimental campaign results on a free running model of a twin-screw ship are presented, allowing to obtain a deeper insight of the problem. In particular, tests have been carried out simulating different simplified control schemes, starting from the most common constant rate of revolution tests and including different control strategies (constant torque and power). Usual standard manoeuvres (turning circle, zigzag and spiral) have been carried out, providing results for asymmetric shaft functioning and ship manoeuvrability behaviour. Results from the present analysis allow to obtain the complete model for the time domain simulation of asymmetric shaft functioning...|$|R
