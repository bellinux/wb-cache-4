50|$|The NEC is {{composed}} of an introduction, nine chapters, annexes A through I, and the index. The introduction sets forth the purpose, scope, enforcement and rules or information that are general in nature. The first four chapters cover definitions and rules for installations (voltages, connections, markings, etc.), circuits and circuit protection, methods and materials for wiring (wiring devices, conductors, cables, etc.), and general-purpose equipment (cords, receptacles, <b>switches,</b> <b>heaters,</b> etc.). The next three chapters deal with special occupancies (high risk to multiple persons), special equipment (signs, machinery, etc.) and special conditions (emergency systems, alarms, etc.). Chapter 8 is specific to additional requirements for communications systems (telephone, radio/TV, etc.) and chapter 9 {{is composed}} of tables regarding conductor, cable and conduit properties, among other things. Annexes A-I relate to referenced standards, calculations, examples, additional tables for proper implementation of various code articles (for example, how many wires fit in a conduit) and a model adoption ordinance.|$|R

40|$|A {{significant}} part of the overall energy consumption of office buildings and households in Europe is consumed for heating. Today's standard is that heaters are controlled by thermostats so that the desired temperatures are maintained for set periods. We now present ConAH (Context Aware Heating) that controls heaters so that heating periods are minimized while keeping the comfort of the occupants. ConAH utilizes information about future presences of occupants in the rooms, called location context of the occupants. To minimize the heating periods and save energy, <b>heaters</b> are <b>switched</b> on just sufficiently before and during usage times of the room and are switched off in all other cases. To calculate the moments to <b>switch</b> <b>heaters</b> on (heat up) or off (cool down), ConAH needs: 1. the future occupancies of the room. Future room occupancies are obtained via the prediction of the occupant's context, here in terms of location. 2. the time that the room needs to heat up or to cool down between two reference temperatures. This is called the room's heating and cooling profile and is determined by experiments in a real meeting room, as well as by simulations. We present the potential energy savings of ConAH compared to a standard controller with a thermostat and explain the effects that are responsible for these results...|$|R

50|$|Heating alone may not {{be enough}} to keep {{switches}} functioning in snowy conditions. If the snow is particularly sticky, as it may be in temperatures just below freezing, chunks of ice may accumulate on trains. When the train passes over some switches, the shocks, possibly in combination with slight heating caused by braking or a city microclimate, may cause the chunks of ice to fall off, jamming the <b>switches.</b> The <b>heaters</b> need time to melt the ice, so if service frequency is high, there {{may not be}} enough time to melt the ice before the next train arrives, disrupting services. Possible solutions are installing higher capacity heaters, reducing the frequency of the timetable or applying anti-icing chemicals like ethylene glycol to the trains.|$|R

5000|$|A home {{thermostat}} is {{an example}} of a closed control loop: It constantly assesses the current room temperature and controls a heater and/or air conditioner to increase or decrease the temperature according to user-defined setting(s). A simple (low-cost, cheap) thermostat merely <b>switches</b> the <b>heater</b> or air conditioner either on or off, and temporary overshoot and undershoot of the desired average temperature must be expected. A more expensive thermostat varies the amount of heat or cooling provided by the heater or cooler, depending on the difference between the required temperature (the [...] "setpoint") and the actual temperature. This minimizes over/undershoot. This method is called Proportional control. Further enhancements using the accumulated error signal (Integral) and the rate at which the error is changing (Derivative) are used to form more complex PID Controllers which is the form usually seen in industry.|$|R
40|$|High speed rail are {{operatives}} in {{many countries}} in the world. The technology has evolved for about 40 years now and is mastered by several worldwide companies. However, high speed rail are fairly new in Nordic countries suchas Sweden and Finland and few development has been done so far to deal with high speed rail in hard winter conditions. Japanese Shinkansen experiences snowfall and cold weather but {{nothing compared to the}} Norwegian long, cold and snowy winters over the whole country. With the possibility of building a high speed rail in Norway in the future, NSB and CargoNet realise that few technologies are published in regard of winter operations. However, after winter 2009 / 2010 overwhelming snowstorm throughout Europe, most countries started analysing the situation to avoid any major winter shortage in the future. Many problems occurred on the networks either on the rolling stock, infrastructure or operations. The goal of the thesis is to analyse the proposed winter technologies from an economical/beneficial point of view to propose the best one to the industry. Literature study provides information about the available technologies and interviews with railway industry actors confirms its efficiency in case of an existing technology and the potential success {{in the event of a}} new one. The analysis of data provided that propylene glycol de-icing was the most cost effective technology for the rolling stock and should be implemented throughout any winter railway network. It has been proven effective by the industry. Likewise, snow brushes and fences combined with improved <b>switch</b> <b>heaters</b> – with the use of cameras and sensors – will reduce manual cleaning and increase the efficiency of the entire infrastructure network. For the planning, many alternatives are available to improve the operations but two main recommendations are to be kept in mind; Communication between weather forecasting groups, infrastructure managers, trains operators, customers and authorities is primordial as well as being ready to react to any situation by having emergency plans before the undesired situation arise. </p...|$|R

50|$|The {{two primary}} health risks from heaters are {{the risk of}} fire {{and the risk of}} carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning. The latter risk applies to gas and kerosene heaters but not electric heaters. The risk of fire from heaters may be mitigated by low surface temperatures (as found on oil-filled convective <b>heaters),</b> or by <b>switches</b> that cut power in the event of the device inadvertently being tipped over (often found in the bases of halogen heaters), or by thermal cut-out <b>switches.</b> Natural Stone <b>Heaters</b> do not pose a fire or carbon monoxide poisoning risk, and can be a safer alternative. However, the surface temperatures of the stone heaters can be considerable, though they may not cause an instant burn as the heat transfer is slow. For that reason they are usually mounted high on walls or ceilings, away from the reach of infants.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIt is {{well known}} that the ionospheric plasma {{response}} to high-power HF radio waves changes drastically as the heater frequency approaches harmonics of the electron gyrofrequency. These include changes in the spectrum of the stimulated electromagnetic emission, reduction in the anomalous absorption of low-power diagnostic waves propagating through the heated volume, and reduction in the large scale F-region heating. Theoretical models as well as previous experimental evidence point towards the absence of small-scale field-aligned plasma density irregularities at pump frequencies close to electron gyroharmonics as the main cause of these changes. Results presented in this paper are the first direct observations of the reduced striations at the 3 rd gyroharmonic made by the CUTLASS radar. In addition, simultaneous EISCAT observations have revealed that the "enhanced ion-line" usually present in the EISCAT ion-line spectrum during the first few seconds after <b>heater</b> <b>switch</b> on, persisted at varying strengths while the heater was transmitting at frequencies close to the 3 rd electron gyroharmonics...|$|R
40|$|Plans for {{low-carbon}} {{transitions in}} cool climates typically include electrification of heating. This poses challenges for electrical network managers, who {{will need to}} cater for substantial new loads. Transition also implies at least two types of change in heating practices: (a) as people shift to electric heating and (b) as they adapt usage {{in response to the}} availability and price of power in a system that is supply-driven and increasingly reliant on renewable generation. From a systems point of view, electric storage heating has proved useful in the past and could offer a valuable source of flexibility in future, comparing favourably with the current generation of domestic batteries. In order to realise its potential, though, it has to be more readily controllable than traditional storage heaters, for two reasons. The people who use the heaters {{need to be able to}} heat their homes or offices adequately at times of their choosing, and system operators also need to be able to charge up or <b>switch</b> off <b>heaters</b> in response to conditions on local networks or on the transmission grid, to minimise curtailment of renewable generation when this is abundant or the use of back-up generation when demand exceeds supply. This paper explains why and how a new,’smart’ versión of an established technology – electric storage heating - is being tested to offer flexibility to networks that are supplied by an increasing proportion of renewable generation. Drawing on the demand response literature and on background research for a project in which smart thermal storage appliances are being tested in Ireland, Germany and Latvia, it sets out some theoretical and practical considerations about the role and of storage heating in energy transitions, the actors involved in demand response, and how value may be distributed between them. The paper concludes with some considerations for further research. </p...|$|R
