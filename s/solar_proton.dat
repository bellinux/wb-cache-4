25|$|During <b>solar</b> <b>proton</b> events, {{ionization}} {{can reach}} unusually high {{levels in the}} D-region over high and polar latitudes. Such very rare events are known as Polar Cap Absorption (or PCA) events, because the increased ionization significantly enhances the absorption of radio signals passing through the region. In fact, absorption levels can increase by many tens of dB during intense events, which is enough to absorb most (if not all) transpolar HF radio signal transmissions. Such events typically last less than 24 to 48 hours.|$|E
25|$|Possible {{acute and}} late {{risks to the}} CNS from galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) and <b>solar</b> <b>proton</b> events (SPEs) are a {{documented}} concern for human exploration of our solar system. In the past, the risks to the CNS of adults {{who were exposed to}} low to moderate doses of ionizing radiation (0 to 2 Gy (Gray) (Gy = 100 rad)) have not been a major consideration. However, the heavy ion component of space radiation presents distinct biophysical challenges to cells and tissues as compared to the physical challenges that are presented by terrestrial forms of radiation. Soon after the discovery of cosmic rays, the concern for CNS risks originated with the prediction of the light flash phenomenon from single HZE nuclei traversals of the retina; this phenomenon was confirmed by the Apollo astronauts in 1970 and 1973. HZE nuclei are capable of producing a column of heavily damaged cells, or a microlesion, along their path through tissues, thereby raising concern over serious impacts on the CNS. In recent years, other concerns have arisen with the discovery of neurogenesis and its impact by HZE nuclei, which have been observed in experimental models of the CNS.|$|E

[...] This was surprising, because the earth's magnetic field would normally have prevented these particles from reaching Minnesota. [...] Consequently, the team concluded that a geomagnetic storm, which was underway during the event, had distorted the field enough to admit protons. [...] Later, these influxes of solar energetic particles, whose discovery was an important achievement of IGY, became designated as <b>solar</b> <b>proton</b> events.

The <b>solar</b> <b>protons</b> had easy access to the IMF lines to earth; the time from the onset to maximum intensity and the shape of the IT profiles at earth as a function of energy could be explained by the diffusion of the flare protons near the acceleration region.
