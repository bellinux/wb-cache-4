5|$|Parliament {{was summoned}} in 1559 to {{consider}} the Reformation Bill {{and to create a}} new church. The Reformation Bill defined the Communion as a consubstantial celebration as opposed to a transubstantial celebration, included abuse of the pope in the litany, and ordered that ministers should not wear the <b>surplice</b> or other Roman Catholic vestments. It allowed ministers to marry, banned images from churches, and confirmed Elizabeth as Supreme Governor of the Church of England.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} decade of her reign, {{influenced}} by her Jewish courtier Abraham Mendel Theben, Maria Theresa issued edicts which offered some state protection to her Jewish subjects. Her actions {{during the late}} stages of her reign contrast her early opinions. She forbade the forcible conversion of Jewish children to Christianity in 1762, and in 1763 she forbade Catholic clergy from extracting <b>surplice</b> fees from her Jewish subjects. In 1764, she ordered the release of those Jews who had been jailed for a blood libel {{in the village of}} Orkuta. Notwithstanding her strong dislike of Jews, Maria Theresa supported Jewish commercial and industrial activity in Austria.|$|E
5|$|In 1789, the bailliage (bailiwick) of Metz elected Custine to the Estates-General; {{upon his}} election, he {{resigned}} his military commission, judging that his responsibilities {{in the national}} assembly required his full attention. In July 1789, as the French Revolution gained momentum, he remained in the National Constituent Assembly. There, he supported {{the creation of a}} constitution espousing the principles of representative government and often voted with such liberal (constitutional) nobility as the Marquis de Lafayette. Although he supported the abolition of some seigniorial rights, he strongly defended royal prerogative and the rights of the nobility who fled during the Great Fear, especially their rights of property. He offered limited support of the nineteen decrees that abolished game-laws, seigniorial courts, the purchase and sale of posts in the magistracy, pecuniary immunities, favoritism in taxation, <b>surplice</b> money, first-fruits, pluralities, and unmerited pensions.|$|E

5|$|The saints are {{identifiable}} from Latin inscriptions {{lining the}} borders of the imitation bronze frame, which is original. Van der Paele is identifiable from historical records. He is dressed in the finery of a medieval canon, including white <b>surplice,</b> as he piously reads from a book of hours. He is presented to Mary by Saint George, his name saint, who holds aloft his metal helmet in respect. Saint Donatian, dressed in brightly coloured vestments, stands to the left. The panel is noted for the finery of clothing, including exquisite representations of furs, silks and brocades, and the elaborate and detailed religious iconography. The Virgin's throne is decorated with carved representations of Adam and Eve, prefigurations of the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus, and scenes from the Old Testament. The painting is lined with a series of inscriptions which comment on the saints, and include van Eyck's signature.|$|E
5|$|Vermigli became deeply {{involved}} in English church politics. In 1550, he and Martin Bucer provided recommendations to Cranmer for additional changes to the Book of Common Prayer Eucharistic liturgy. Vermigli supported the church's position in the vestarian controversy, over whether bishop John Hooper {{should be forced to}} wear a <b>surplice.</b> Vermigli agreed with Hooper's desire to rid the church of elaborate garments, but he did not believe they were strictly prohibited. He advised Hooper to respect the authority of his superiors. Vermigli was probably instrumental in convincing Hooper to drop his opposition in February 1551. In October 1551 he participated in a commission to rewrite the canon law of England. In the Winter he assisted in the writing of a draft set of such laws, which was published by John Foxe as Reformatio legum ecclesiasticarum in 1552.|$|E
25|$|Historically, Anglican clergy have {{vested in}} cassock, <b>surplice</b> and tippet for Morning and Evening Prayer, while bishops wear the rochet and chimere. In some monastic {{communities}} and Anglo-Catholic parishes, the officiant wears <b>surplice</b> or alb, stole and cope when Evensong is celebrated solemnly.|$|E

25|$|Among the paleo-orthodox and {{emerging}} church movements in Protestant and evangelical churches, {{in which some}} Presbyterians are involved, clergy are {{moving away from the}} traditional black Geneva gown to such vestments as the alb and chasuble, but also cassock and <b>surplice</b> (typically a full length Old English style <b>surplice</b> which resembles the Celtic alb, an ungirdled liturgical tunic of the old Gallican Rite), which some, particularly those identifying with the Liturgical Renewal Movement, hold to be more ancient and representative of a more ecumenical past.|$|E
25|$|The cope, therefore, {{is often}} worn at Anglo-Catholic churches where the celebrant at the Eucharist would {{conventionally}} wear the chasuble. In general those clergy who robe wear a cassock, <b>surplice,</b> scarf and, occasionally, also an academic hood. Since about 1990 there {{has sometimes been}} a practice of wearing a long <b>surplice</b> without a cassock, particularly through the summer. Most clergy in the diocese, however, dispense even with these robes, conducting church services in street clothes ranging from {{a suit and tie}} or clerical collar, to smart casual attire.|$|E
25|$|The hood was {{originally}} a functional garment, worn {{to shield the}} head from the elements. In the English tradition, it has developed to an often bright and decorative garment worn only on special occasions. It is also worn by clergy and lay readers of the Anglican Communion in choir dress, over the <b>surplice,</b> and it is common in cathedrals, churches, and chapels for the choirmaster and/or members of the choir to wear an academic hood {{to which they are}} entitled during services, over their cassock and <b>surplice,</b> only for the choir offices (Morning and Evening Prayer) and not for the Eucharist.|$|E
5000|$|The church's early catholic liturgy {{was noted}} by Wylie in 1853, {{and it was}} the first church in Nottingham to {{introduce}} a surpliced choir - There is a male choir, the members of which are dressed in <b>surplices.</b> This is the only Protestant place of worship in the neighbourhood where this and other kindred practices, such as intoning the prayers, prevail.. Compare this with nearby St Mary's Church, Nottingham which did not introduce <b>surplices</b> for the choir until 1868 ...|$|R

5000|$|Since {{the early}} 1990s the choir cassocks {{are of a}} deep {{burgundy}} colour, matching the stencil design hue on the organ pipes. Originally the choir wore traditional black cassocks and white <b>surplices,</b> but {{with the introduction of}} An Australian Prayer Book in the late 1970s, new cassocks of a green colour approximating that of the new prayer book cover (and coincidentally, that of the visible organ pipework at the time) were introduced and <b>surplices</b> were discontinued. On a visit to the cathedral in 1985 by the then Archbishop of Canterbury, a somewhat astonished Robert Runcie exclaimed that he had [...] "never seen a cathedral choir wearing green robes before". With the restoration of the organ in the early 1990s, <b>surplices</b> were restored and cassocks of a deep burgundy were introduced matching the new stencil design hue on the organ pipes.|$|R
25|$|Anglican bishops usually wear {{a purple}} cassock. Over this, {{instead of the}} <b>surplice,</b> they wear the rochet with red or black chimere and {{matching}} cuffs, black tippet, and sometimes an academic hood.|$|E
25|$|Loose gowns, {{sometimes}} with a wrapped or <b>surplice</b> front closure, were worn over the shift (chemise), petticoat and stays (corset) for at-home wear, {{and it was}} fashionable to have one's portrait painted wearing these fashions.|$|E
25|$|While ordained and instituted ministers must wear an alb (with {{cincture}} and amice {{unless the}} form of the alb makes these unnecessary), albs or any other appropriate attire, such as a cassock and <b>surplice,</b> may be worn by servers.

25|$|The cope and/or stole may be worn over choir dress when a cleric {{presides over}} a sacrament (for instance, at matrimony, if not celebrated during Mass), {{or by the}} cleric {{presiding}} over prayers (for instance, the priest presiding at a solemn celebration of Vespers in the Liturgy of the Hours at a seminary might wear cope and stole over choir dress, while the priests of the faculty and seminarians would wear simple choir dress of cassock and <b>surplice).</b>|$|E
25|$|Those {{taking part}} in processions are to walk bare-headed (weather permitting), two and two, in decent costume, and with reverent mien; clergy and laity, men and women, are to walk separately. The cross is carried {{at the head of}} the procession, and banners {{embroidered}} with sacred pictures in places where this is customary; these banners must not be of military or triangular shape. Violet is the prescribed colour for processions, except on Corpus Christi, or on a day when some other colour is mandated. The officiating priest wears a cope, or at least a <b>surplice</b> with a violet stole, while other priests and clergy wear surplices.|$|E
25|$|Lord Clifden was a bay colt bred by J. A. Hind and foaled in 1860. He was sired by Newminster, {{who had won}} the St. Leger in 1851. Newminster {{later became}} a {{successful}} stallion and was twice champion sire of Great Britain and Ireland. Among his other progeny was Hermit, who won the Derby and was champion sire seven times. Newminster also sired the Derby winner Musjid, the 1000 Guineas winner Nemesis and Adventurer who also became a champion sire. Lord Clifden's dam was The Slave, a daughter of Melbourne. Hind had purchased The Slave as a yearling in 1853. She raced as a two-year-old, placing once, before being retired to stud. Two years before the birth of Lord Clifden, she foaled Lady Clifden, a filly by <b>Surplice.</b> Lady Clifden {{went on to win}} the Portland Handicap and Stewards' Cup.

25|$|This she did {{essentially}} {{by providing}} accommodation for persecuted ministers and {{a platform for}} their preaching, and by making her home available for religious exercises held by what {{appear to have been}} regional networks of Puritan ministers. Of those mentioned by Clark and Brook, Julines Herring seems to have been central: he was the public preacher appointed to St Alkmund's Church, Shrewsbury, by the town's corporation; John Ball was an old friend of Herring, ordained alongside him by an Irish bishop in 1610 to avoid subscription to the Thirty-Nine Articles; Robert Nicolls of Wrenbury was Herring's brother-in-law; Thomas Pierson of Brampton Bryan was one the ministers Herring invited, along with Nicolls, to preach in Shrewsbury. Another who took refuge at Sheriffhales was Thomas Langley of Middlewich. Nicolls had clashed with the ecclesiastical authorities over ceremonial practice since Thomas Morton's time as Bishop of Chester. He died while taking refuge at Sheriffhales in 1630, leaving polemical writings that would not be published until 1660, attacking in particular signing with the Cross in baptism, the <b>surplice</b> and kneeling to receive Communion.|$|E
25|$|On weekdays {{that are}} not major feasts Vespers {{features}} hardly any ceremonies and the celebrant wears the usual choir dress. However, on Sundays and greater feasts Vespers may be solemn. Solemn Vespers differ in that the celebrant wears the cope, he is assisted by assistants also in copes, incense is used, and two acolytes, a thurifer, {{and at least one}} master of ceremonies are needed. On ordinary Sundays only two assistants are needed while on greater feasts four or six assistants may be used. The celebrant and assistants vest in the <b>surplice</b> and the cope, which is of the color of the day. The celebrant sits at the sedile, in front of which is placed a lectern, covered with a cloth in the color of the day. The assistants sit on benches or stools facing the altar, or if there are two assistants, they may sit at the sedile next to the celebrant (the first assistant in the place of the deacon and the second assistant in place of the subdeacon).|$|E
500|$|Ill from {{drink and}} {{suffering}} from smoker's cough, in February 1888 Van Gogh sought refuge in Arles. He {{seems to have}} moved with thoughts of founding an art colony. The Danish artist Christian Mourier-Petersen became his companion for two months, and at first Arles appeared exotic. In a letter, he {{described it as a}} foreign country: [...] "The Zouaves, the brothels, the adorable little Arlésienne going to her First Communion, the priest in his <b>surplice,</b> who looks like a dangerous rhinoceros, the people drinking absinthe, all seem to me creatures from another world." ...|$|E
