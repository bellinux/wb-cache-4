500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Drowned World/Substitute for Love" [...] {{was directed by}} Walter Stern and filmed on June 26â€“27, 1998 at London's Claridge's Hotel and Piccadilly Circus. It includes cameo appearances by Anita Pallenberg and Steve Strange. It was released in September 1998, and features Madonna leaving her home and being chased by paparazzi. Dressed in black, she is constantly running, even from the other celebrities in a hotel bar. Except for Madonna's, everyone else's face is distorted. In another sequence of the clip, Madonna passes a hotel maid smiling at her. The singer returns the <b>smile</b> <b>when</b> the flash of a camera goes off; the maid has just taken a picture of her. Madonna flees again, running {{all the way home}} to her daughter's arms, singing that she has [...] "changed her mind" [...] about being a celebrity.|$|E
500|$|I {{was running}} back and forth, literally, from the editing room with [...] Jonas Akerlund to working with Stuart, who was also mixing the music in the film. We were together, non-stop, all of us. Cutting 350 hours of film down to two hours. There {{are a lot of}} serious aspects to the movie. I needed a release. When I would go to Stuart's, and we'd go up to his loft, it was like, 'Honey, I want to dance.' I wanted to be happy, silly and buoyant. I wanted to lift myself and others up with this record. So, yes, the new album was a {{reaction}} to all the other stuff I was doing, which was very serious in nature. I hope that doesn't imply that I wanted to make a superficial record, because it's not. I want people to <b>smile</b> <b>when</b> they hear this record. I wanted it to put a smile on my face, too.|$|E
2500|$|Author Ian Inglis {{describes}} the song's melody as [...] "romantic". Referring to {{its status as}} the last track on Living in the Material World, he also comments on the appropriateness of Harrison's opening words: [...] "That is all I want to say". Inglis writes that Harrison goes on to state both [...] " [...] {{he wants to do}} for his lover" [...] and [...] "what he hopes for in return", in the respective lines [...] "To try to love you more" [...] and [...] "A <b>smile</b> <b>when</b> I feel blue".|$|E

2500|$|The {{storming}} of Nam O Beach {{took place}} on 8 March 1965 on the coastline around the port of Da Nang in South Vietnam. In the few days preceding the landing, Karch commented that the weather was the worst that he had experienced. When inhabitants of the friendly beach greeted the arriving Marines and photographs were taken, Karch was never seen to <b>smile.</b> <b>When</b> this was queried, he replied [...] "...if I {{had to do it}} over, that picture would have been the same. When you have a son in Vietnam and he gets killed, you don't want a smiling general with flowers around his neck as leader at that point." ...|$|E
2500|$|Robinson {{walked a}} step ahead of us, but when he noticed me hurrying to catch up, he {{shortened}} his stride to accommodate mine. I kept reaching up for his hand, but he hadn't looked down and seemed unaware. Fannie called his attention to what I was doing, so he stopped short, bent low over me, his eyes wide and rows of brilliant teeth showing in a wide <b>smile.</b> <b>When</b> he took my hand in his, it felt large and cool. For a few moments, we continued walking in silence. [...] "Can I call you Uncle Billy?" [...] I asked. [...] "Why sure you can", he replied... "But then I get to call you darlin.'" [...] It was a deal. From then on, whenever we walked together it was hand in hand, and I was always his [...] "darlin.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Buse {{was one of}} the {{distinctive}} characters in a Somerset side full of characters. In appearance and manner, he was bustling and rather prim, with a clipped moustache and always-neat hair. As a bowler, he went through a variety of fussy mannerisms before delivering the ball, all of which served only to endear him to Somerset cricket crowds. [...] "There was his studious contemplation, his stuttering approach, the touch of acceleration and the undisguised <b>smile</b> <b>when</b> the batsman failed to counter the late swing," [...] is one description. John Arlott said Buse's run-up was like a butler bringing in the tea. He could bowl both outswingers and inswingers. As a batsman, Buse also had a distinctive style that involved a strange dabbing stroke that steered the ball through the slips or gully towards third man. [...] "There was rather too much posterior," [...] says one book.|$|E

2500|$|The {{sociologist}} Arlie Hochschild {{provides the}} first definition of emotional labor, {{which is a}} form of emotion regulation that creates a publicly visible facial and bodily display within the workplace. The related term emotion work (also called [...] "emotion management") refers to [...] "these same acts done in a private context", such as within the private sphere of one's home or interactions with family and friends. Hochschild identified three emotion regulation strategies: cognitive, bodily, and expressive. Within cognitive emotion work, one attempts to change images, ideas, or thoughts in hopes of changing the feelings associated with them. For example, one may associate a family picture with feeling happy and think about said picture whenever attempting to feel happy. Within bodily emotion work, one attempts to change physical symptoms {{in order to create a}} desired emotion. For example, one may attempt deep breathing in order to reduce anger. Within expressive emotion work, one attempts to change expressive gestures to change inner feelings. For example, one may attempt to <b>smile</b> <b>when</b> trying to feel happy. One becomes aware of emotion work most often when one's feelings do not fit the situation. For instance, when one does not feel sad at a funeral, one becomes acutely aware of the feelings appropriate for that situation.|$|E
