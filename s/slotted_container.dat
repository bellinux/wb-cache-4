50|$|Bulk {{boxes are}} often made of {{corrugated}} fiberboard, either doublewall or triplewall. Many corrugated bulk boxes have covers. The {{main body of}} some {{is similar to a}} half <b>slotted</b> <b>container</b> with flaps on the bottom; others have a separate base (similar to the cover) and a sleeve for side walls. Additional corrugated liners and box reinforcement are sometimes used to control bulging. Wooden boxes are also used for bulk packaging; boxes made of aluminum and steel are common in heavy industry. Reusable plastic totes (molded or corrugated plastic) are used for some products and logistics chains.|$|E
40|$|An {{interactive}} materials-based learning kit for K- 4 {{grade levels}} was refined to effectively {{be used in}} outreach and after-school programs. Different safari animals made of different materials are packaged in the kit, along with different activities to explore physical properties. An optimized number and variety of animals and materials were determined. The volume and weight of the Materials Safari learning kit was optimized to meet the user’s needs. One way the product was optimized was {{reducing the number of}} animal pieces in the product. Also, two of the testing stations were reduced in size by about fifty percent to fit in the new, sleek packaging design. The packaging of Materials Safari was designed in ArtiosCad and resembled a regular <b>slotted</b> <b>container</b> style with a tuck and tongue made of microflute, also known as E flute. The prototype package was constructed on a Kongsberg cutting table and assembled with hot glue. The volume and weight of the Materials Safari was reduced by fifty-three and thirty-seven percent, respectively. The graphic design, which embodied a safari adventure theme, was designed in Adobe Illustrator. Interactive and educational activities were created and tested to assist with children’s conceptualization of weight, magnetism, and density. A sorting chart, instructional children story book, and questionnaires were developed for the educational activities. The final packaged product will be tested with children who are in K- 4 grade levels to further research on child psychology of scientific concepts...|$|E
50|$|The edge {{crush test}} is a {{laboratory}} test method {{that is used}} to measure the cross-direction crushing of a sample of corrugated board.

40|$|Telescoping Half <b>Slotted</b> <b>Containers</b> (HSC) and Diagonal Corner Bliss style {{containers}} {{are popular}} choices for packaging agricultural {{products such as}} apples, pears, citrus, potatoes, garlic and most vegetables. This study evaluated two unique corrugated container designs, Kisch Full Circle Tray (FCT) and Single V Kisch Bliss, which are both viable designs available to replace the presently used styles of boxes for produce distribution. This paper presents the compression strength results of Telescoping HSC containers as compared to two possible replacements and the Diagonal Corner Bliss designs when stored under standard, refrigerated and tropical conditions. It also compares the material savings and the life-cycle environmental impacts for the three designs against the Telescoping HSC design. Comparing the average overall peak forces, across all three environmental conditions of the Telescoping HSC boxes {{to that of the}} three designs, it was concluded that the Kisch FCT boxes were approximately 17 % weaker, while providing material savings of over 14 %; the Diagonal Corner Bliss boxes were approximately 9 % weaker, while providing material savings of almost 22 % and the Single V Kisch Bliss boxes were approximately 14 % stronger, while providing material savings of over 19 %. Savings in material ranging from 14 to 22 % for the three designs tested, translates into significant energy savings, relative optimization of natural resources, reductions in green house gas emissions and relative minimization of waste water and solid waste generated during production in comparison to the Telescoping HSC style boxes...|$|R

40|$|Past {{disposal}} of industrial solvents into unregulated landfills {{is a significant}} source of groundwater contamination. In 2009, we began investigating a former unregulated landfill with known trichloroethene (TCE) contamination. Our objective was to pinpoint the location of the plume and treat the TCE using in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO). We accomplished this by using electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) to survey the landfill and map the subsurface lithology. We then used the ERI maps to guide direct push groundwater sampling. A TCE plume (100 - 600 µg L- 1) was identified in a low permeable silty-clay aquifer (Kh = 0. 5 m d- 1) that was within 6 m of ground surface and underlain by an even lower permeable zone (Kh = 0. 04 m d- 1). Because injecting a liquid oxidant into the low permeable aquifer would have been difficult, we manufactured slow-release potassium permanganate candles (SRPCs) to treat the TCE. SRPCs were prepared by heating and mixing KMnO 4 and paraffin wax at a 4. 6 to 1 ratio (w/w), and then pouring the heated mixture into circular cardboard molds (91. 4 cm long) that were either 5. 1 cm (2 in) or 7. 6 cm (3 in) in diameter. For comparison, we inserted equal masses of SRPCs (7. 6 -cm vs 5. 1 -cm diameter) into a low permeable aquifer (4. 6 m vertical thickness) in staggered rows that intersected the TCE plume. The 5. 1 -cm diam candles were inserted directly into the formation using direct push hollow rods at 21 locations. The 7. 6 -cm SRPCs were encased in <b>slotted</b> <b>containers</b> and placed in 10 permanent wells. Pneumatic recirculators that emitted small air bubbles were placed below the 7. 6 -cm SRPCs in the second year to facilitate permanganate distribution. Results obtained prior to inserting recirculators showed a 64 to 82 % reduction of TCE in the 7. 6 -cm candle treatment zone after 342 d and between 64 to 100 % decrease in associated ethene degradates. These results support using slow-release permanganate candles as a means of treating chlorinated solvents in low permeable aquifers. Advisor: Steve Comfor...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{for this}} research {{was to assess the}} efficacy of biodegradable containers compared to plastic containers for the production of long-term crops using a subirrigation system. Plastic and various biocontainers were used to grow `Rainier Purple 2 ̆ 7 cyclamen (Cyclamen persicum L.) in ebb-and-flood benches. After 15 weeks, the physical properties of the containers were tested. The used plastic containers had strengths of 23. 3, 23. 5 and 21. 9 g for the bottom, middle and top zones respectively. The peat, dairy manure and wood fiber containers had strengths of less than 2 kg for each zone. The peat, dairy manure, wood fiber and rice straw containers had used tensile strengths of 0, 0, 3. 61 and 5. 29 g respectively. Total water for wood fiber containers was significantly higher than plastic containers. Irrigation interval for plastic containers was significantly longer than for wood fiber containers. Plastic, bioplastic, solid ricehull and <b>slotted</b> ricehull <b>containers</b> had no algal or fungal growth. There {{were no significant differences between}} biocontainers and plastic containers for days to flower. All biocontainers except wood fiber had significantly higher shoot dry weights than plants grown in plastic containers. The plants grown in the plastic containers had root dry weights of 3. 0 g. Solid ricehull, paper, wood fiber and coconut fiber containers had higher plant root dry weights than plastic containers. The bioplastic, solid ricehull and <b>slotted</b> ricehull <b>containers</b> would all be appropriate substitutes for plastic containers. These containers retained high levels of punch and tensile strength, had no algal and fungal growth, required a similar amount of water as the plastic containers and did not negatively affect plant growth. The peat, dairy manure, wood fiber and rice straw containers would not be appropriate substitutes for plastic containers because of the low used strengths, high percentages of algae coverage and shorter irrigation intervals. Paper and coconut fiber containers could be used to substitute for plastic. These containers retained high used strengths, similar total water usage amounts, and did not negatively affect plant growth. These containers had algae but it was less than 9...|$|R
40|$|This article {{introduces}} an {{optimization model}} for container liner services that simultaneously optimizes the shipping route and the <b>container</b> <b>slot</b> allocation on vessels {{by considering the}} interactions between the container shipping scheme and the transport demand in the ports. The model consists of two input factors and two processes. The input factors include the shipping scheme and the transport demand in the ports. The processes relate to the optimization of the shipping scheme for a fixed transport demand and the adjustment of the transport demand for a given shipping schedule. We demonstrate the model in an empirical case study on liner service optimization on the trade route between East Asia and West Europe...|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{moisture}} on the mechanical properties of one commercial solid fiberboard grade {{and on the}} compression strength of mill-fabricated transport boxes made from this material were studied. The solid fiberboard (1220 g/m 2) has four middle layers made of old corrugated container (OCC). The middle layers are strongly internally sized with rosin sizing. The outer layers on both sides are made of bleached machine finished kraft paper. The kraft paper has extrusion coated low-density polyethylene (LDPE) doublelayer as moisture barrier. The six paper and paperboard layers are glued together in an industrial lamination process. The boxes have unusual design including double-panel walls and webbed corners, and they are used in wet and humid conditions for transporting fresh round fish. The transportation takes up to eight days at the ambient environment of 4 °C and 90 - 100 % RH. These conditions are taken as {{the framework of the}} study. Results show that the LDPE coating considerably slows down the transverse moisture penetration. The in-plane diffusivity (5. 9 · 10 - 10 m 2 /s, 27 °C, 50 / 90 % RH) was determined with an integrated unsteady state moisture transport model and was found to be nine times higher than the transverse diffusivity through the PE layer. Based on the diffusivity, water vapor can theoretically affect 80 mm from the open unsealed board edge during transport. Experiments show that liquid water penetrates 40 - 50 mm during eight days. In the middle of the sheet the moisture content increases moderately, approximately 0. 3 percentage points during transport. The packaging producer’s main concern is thus to ensure that the open material edges are at least 80 mm away from the load bearing sections of the box. Due to uneven moisture penetration into the boxes, the average moisture of a box is a questionable measure {{of moisture}} pick-up. Instead one should consider the moisture content of the load bearing parts. The role of the adhesion layers in bending stiffness of the solid paperboard was modeled with laminate models. Results show that the adhesion layers affect the mechanical properties of the combined board and need to be addressed in the models. Best agreement with the measured bending stiffness values was obtained by a 11 -layer model, where the properties of the adhesion layers are taken from the paper-glue-paper sandwich tests. The PE and kraft paper are regarded as one layer in the model. With this model, the calculated bending stiffnesses are close to the measured reference at 50 % RH in MD (difference 1 %). In 90 % RH and in MD the results are 14 % lower. Neglecting the adhesion layers gives 5 % lower values in 50 % RH and 18 % in 90 % RH compared to the reference measurement in MD. In each of the cases, the difference from reference is larger for the CD material direction. Three thickness measurement techniques (ISO, STFI, and SEM) were used to gather input data for the bending stiffness model. In this application, the ISO technique provided best results compared to the other techniques. It was found that the top-to bottom failure of a box can be expressed as a critical vertical displacement that is independent of moisture content. Similar results have been previously discovered when studying simpler structures like corrugated board panels and regular <b>slotted</b> <b>containers</b> (RSC). This research indicates that the strain dependent failure criterion also applies on more complex box structures.

40|$|Purpose: Empty {{container}} trucks {{may cause}} a deficit in transport capacity {{and contribute to}} congestion and emissions in the port territory. Reengineering of the container truck hauling process to introduce truck-sharing arrangements using the truck appointment system {{has the potential of}} reducing the number of empty-truck trips. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: This research evaluates the results from an investigation of the truck appointment system using a case study approach. The data collection phase involved primary and secondary sources along with using publicly available data on port operations. Findings: The study explores a dynamic truck-sharing facility for a computer-based matching system to assign probable export containers to available empty <b>slots</b> of a <b>container</b> truck. The proposed model reengineers the truck appointment system with a potential {{to reduce the number of}} empty-truck trips to increase container transport capacity around seaport gates. Research limitations/implications: Due to continuous increases in container-freight traffic, leading seaports of the world are experiencing a capacity shortage resulting in traffic congestion. The research findings are useful in practice as the proposed truck-sharing model can be introduced to enhance capacity in the container transport chain of the port territory. Originality/value: The empty-trucks problem has not been addressed much in studies from a decentralized perspective where all truck operators have an equal chance to contribute to optimize the supply chain in contrast with the typical one-company-based optimization. The solution addressed here uses the shared-transportation concept to cover the research gap...|$|R
