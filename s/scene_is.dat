5|$|The {{shock therapy}} <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> {{reminiscent}} of the 1971 film A Clockwork Orange, and {{is known for its}} appearance in the 1990 film Die Hard 2.|$|E
5|$|The sleepwalking <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> one of {{the more}} celebrated scenes from Macbeth, and, indeed, in all of Shakespeare. It has no {{counterpart}} in Holinshed's Chronicles, Shakespeare's source material for the play, but is solely the bard's invention.|$|E
5|$|The video's first <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> set in {{a desert}} at night. Rihanna, wearing a {{garrison}} cap, sunglasses, and a stylized white top, {{stands in front of}} an army. This <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> intercut with scenes of Rihanna in a bunker; she wears an army hard hat, pink lace up boots, and a skin-colored top with small black rectangles covering her breasts. Halfway through the first verse, the scene changes to a daytime desert scene in which Rihanna wears a low cut, short black dress with spiked shoulder pads, and walks through the location as small explosions occur around her.|$|E
50|$|Although set in Limerick, many street <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> {{filmed in}} Cork. For example, the 'fleas in the mattress' <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> filmed at Farren Street, Blackpool and other <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> shot at Roche's Buildings, Lower John Street and Barrack Street.|$|R

5|$|As {{with all}} but the first scene of the Matsudaira scroll, this <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> set {{on the evening of}} Kankō 5, 11th month, 1st day (December 1, 1008), the day of the Ika-no-iwai of the Imperial Prince Atsuhira-shinnō, the later Emperor Go-Ichijō. The {{painting}} shows a room inside a shinden partitioned off by kichō room dividers featuring the design of decaying trees. Empress Shōshi, with the baby in her arms, is partially visible at the top. Court ladies are serving various types of ritual food.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} first {{sequence}} of pictures, the three panels concerning Noah, taken from the sixth to ninth chapters of Genesis are thematic rather than chronological. In the first <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> shown the sacrifice of a sheep. Vasari, in writing about this scene mistakes it for the sacrifices by Cain and Abel, in which Abel's sacrifice was acceptable to God and Cain's was not. What this image almost certainly depicts is the sacrifice made by the family of Noah, after their safe deliverance from the Great Flood which destroyed the rest of Humankind.|$|E

5|$|George Harrison met his wife-to-be, Patricia Boyd, {{on the set}} {{when she}} made a brief (uncredited) {{appearance}} {{as one of the}} schoolgirls on the train. His initial overtures to her were spurned because she had a boyfriend at the time but he persisted and they were married within 18 months. The girl with Boyd in the dining car <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> Prudence Bury. Phil Collins, within a few years a band member of Genesis, was an uncredited schoolboy extra in the concert audience.|$|E
5|$|Having {{lost their}} {{hair from the}} lake's pollution, the Griffins are at home wearing {{powdered}} wigs, an effect that compels Stewie to play several classical compositions, including those by Joseph Haydn and Georg Friedrich Handel, with Peter appearing as Antonio Salieri. The <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> {{a reference to the}} 1984 film Amadeus.|$|E
5|$|I {{wanted it}} to be almost like a photo album, so every single <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> kind of like a picture that you're kind of looking into our relationship. So it is a 1920s vibe, it's black and white, very high fashion—you know, you'll see me very dapper in 1920s, Frank Sinatra-ish. So you'll see the cars from that era, you'll {{definitely}} feel the vibe of the house having that 1920s vibe as well. So it's very different and very intimate, and it's not a lot of dancing—it's more personal.|$|E

5|$|I {{was sitting}} there in the theater at the back, showing it to people for the first time. I mean, it was like a puddle of sweat around my feet. It was like, 'Oh my God, oh my God, I hope I did the right thing. Oh, that <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> too long. Oh, that's too short. Are they going to get this part? Are they going to like this? Oh, they're going to think it's boring!' Just {{worrying}} the whole way, biting my fingernails off.|$|E

5|$|Kong's New York stage {{appearance}} {{looks very}} much like a re-enactment of the 1933 film's sacrifice scene, including the posts the 'beauty' is tied to and the nearly identical performance and costumes of the dancers. In addition, the music played by the orchestra during that <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> Max Steiner's original score for the 1933 film.|$|E
50|$|The battle <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> shot in Yugoslavia. Many <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> reused in {{the same}} director's 1964 film The Lion of Thebes.|$|R
5|$|The {{idea behind}} the shock therapy <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> based on Laurel and Hardy {{throwing}} pies at each other. The <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> rearranged in the editing room; it played out differently when first produced. The edits to this <b>scene</b> <b>were</b> preliminary, but well-received, and remained unchanged in the finished product.|$|R
50|$|Most cabin <b>scenes</b> <b>are</b> filmed at TVB {{sets and}} most cockpit <b>scenes</b> <b>are</b> either {{on board the}} A330 or the A330 simulator.|$|R
5|$|Minneapolis's collegiate <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> {{dominated}} by the main campus of the University of Minnesota where more than 50,000 undergraduate, graduate, and professional students attend 20 colleges, schools, and institutes.

He reports this to Bhagavan {{to get rid of}} Jaidev.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> a pastiche of the frontispiece of Andreas Vesalius's De humani corporis fabrica, and it possibly also borrows from Quack Physicians' Hall (c. 1730) by the Dutch artist Egbert van Heemskerck, {{who had lived in}} England and whose work Hogarth admired. An earlier source of inspiration may have been a woodcut in the 1495 Fasciculo di medicina by Johannes de Ketham which, although simpler, has many of the same elements, including the seated president flanked by two windows.|$|E
50|$|Opening <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> shot in Toronto, Ontario. The camera booth <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> shot on {{the lower}} draw bridge (linking Hamilton and Burlington).
