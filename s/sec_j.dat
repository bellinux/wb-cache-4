40|$|The Evans Lemma {{is a basic}} {{tool for}} Evans GCUFT or ECE Theory [2]. Evans has given two proofs of his Lemma. The first proof in [1] is shown to be invalid due to dubious use of the {{covariant}} derivative D µ. A second proof in [2, <b>Sec.</b> <b>J.</b> 3] is wrong due to a logical error. 1 1 M. W. Evans ’ first proof of his Lemma The Evans Lemma is the assertion of proportionality of the matrices (✷qa µ) and (qa µ) with a proportionality factor R: (✷q a µ) = R(qa µ). Quotation from [1, p. 432 + 8] 1 The Evans lemma is {{a direct consequence of}} the tetrad postulate. The proof of the lemma starts from covariant differentiation of the postulate: [1, (36) ] 2 D µ (∂µq a λ + ωa µb qb λ − Γν µλ qa ν) = 0. Using the Leibnitz rule, we have [1, (37) ] (Dµ ∂µ) qa λ +∂µ(Dµ qa λ) +(Dµ ωa µb) qb λ +ωa µb(Dµ qb λ) −(Dµ Γν µλ) qa ν −Γν µλ(Dµ qa ν) = 0, and so [1, (38) ] (D µ ∂µ) q a λ + (Dµ ω a µb) qb λ − (Dµ Γ ν µλ) qa ν = 0, because [1, (39) ] D µ q a λ = Dµ q b λ = Dµ q a ν = 0. End of Quotation Eq. [1, (36) ] is formally correct, however, the decomposition in Eq. [1, (37) ] yields undefined expressions: What e. g. is the meaning of the terms D µ ωa µb and D µ Γν µλ? Note that both ωa µb and Γν µλ are no tensors and so the covariant derivative D µ is not applicable. Therefore we skip over the rest of [1]. 2 Evans ’ second proof of his Lemma M. W. Evans himself felt it necessary to give another proof in [2, p. 514], 1 The page numbers of the web copy mentioned in [1] start with 1 instead of 433 (= 432 + 1). 2 Quotations from M. W. Evans ’ contributions [1] and [2] appear with equation labels [p,(nn) ] in the left margin. 2 now avoiding the problem of undefined terms. Quotation from [2, p. 514] J. 3 The Evans Lemma The Evans Lemma is the direct result of the tetrad postulate of differential geometry: [2, (J. 27) ] Dµq a λ = ∂µq a λ + ωa µb qb λ − Γν µλ qa ν = 0. using the notation of the text. It follows from eqn. (J. 27) that: [2, (J. 28) ] D µ(Dµqa λ) = ∂µ (Dµqa λ) = 0, i. e. [2, (J. 29) ] ∂ µ(∂µqa λ + ωa µbqb λ − Γν µλqa ν) = 0, or [2, (J. 30) ] ✷qa λ = ∂µ (Γν µλqa ν) − ∂ µ(ωa µbqb λ) ...|$|E

50|$|Security {{analysis}} is {{the analysis of}} tradeable financial instruments called securities. These are usually classified into debt securities, equities, or some hybrid of the two. Tradeable credit derivatives are also securities. Commodities or futures contracts are not securities.

These variables are compared {{to the results of}} the same measurements obtained among 15 young adults aged 45. 1 years (30 limbs). We find that To and Vo are significantly lower in the oldest population (To j 35. 9 +/- 4. 8 sec, To aged 16. 1 +/- 5. 2 sec, p < 0. 001, Vo j 4. 98 +/- 1. 1 %, Vo ag 2. 97 +/- 1 %, p < 0. 001). In the second part of this work, a passive massage of the calf is substituted to the ankle flexions. This technique is applied to 19 elderly people aged 80. 4 years (37 limbs) compared to 6 young adults aged 24 years (12 limbs).

In the first experiment, {{with the aim of}} investigating the effect of the context of judgment, we asked psychology students to judge the variability of psychologists or of social workers (one-group conditions) or to judge both groups (two-group condition) on dimensions typical of psychologists and on dimensions typical of social workers. As predicted, whereas an ingroup homogeneity effect was found for the dimensions typical of the ingroup in the two-group condition, no asymmetry in perception of group variability emerged in the one-group conditions. In the second experiment, we examined the effect of ingroup identification in an explicit intergroup situation. In line with predictions, high identifiers perceived greater homogeneity in the ingroup than in the outgroup. In contrast, low identifiers displayed the opposite tendency. The impact of context and social identification on group entitativity is considered in its cognitive and motivational aspects. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R
40|$|Objective: {{the purpose}} of this study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on the repair of rat tibiae exposed to ionizing radiation (IR). Background data: IR causes structural changes that delay bone tissue repair. Properly dosed, LLLT improves the bone repair process. Methods: Seventy-two healthy Wistar rats were distributed into the following groups: Group I, sham control; Group II, LLLT; Group III, IR; and Group IV, IR and LLLT. Groups III and IV received a single dose (30 Gy) of gamma radiation and underwent surgery 28 days later. A noncritical sized bone defect (diameter 2. 5 mm) was surgically created in all groups. Groups II and IV received three applications of postsurgical LLLT (GaAlAs, 808 nm, 100 mW, 0. 028 cm(2), 3. 57 W/cm(2), 20 <b>sec,</b> 2 <b>J,</b> approximately equal to 71. 4 J/cm(2)) on alternate days. Histomorphometry was assessed following digital image analysis. Results: the samples were evaluated on days 7, 14, and 21 after surgery; the IR protocol resulted in a significant reduction (p< 0. 018) in bone formation in Group III compared with Group I. Significant increases (p< 0. 006) in newly formed bone were noted in Group IV compared with Group III. No significant differences were observed between Group I and Group IV. Conclusions: LLLT increased the newly formed bone area during the initial phase of the tibiae repair process in rats exposed to IR.

40|$|The {{measurements}} {{described in}} the preceding paper (I) are used to obtain the position, spin and isobaric spin of energy levels in 26 Al. All the observed intensive high-energy γ-rays can be explained as transitions from resonance levels to the levels found by Browne 7) from the 28 Si(d, a) 26 Al reaction and to one additional level at Ex = 2. 57 ± 0. 04 MeV. The low-energy γ-rays fit the same level scheme, plus one more additional level at Ex = 0. 235 ± 0. 009 MeV. The latter level is actually the first excited state in 26 Al, {{which turns out to}} be an isomeric state decaying by β+ emission with the long known half life of 6. 6 <b>sec.</b> Spins <b>J,</b> parities and isobaric spins T can be assigned as follows: Ex = 0 (J = 5 +, T = 0), Ex = 0. 235 MeV (J = 0 +, T = 1), Ex = 0. 419 MeV (J = 3 +, T = 0), Ex = 1. 055 MeV (J = 1 +, T = 0), Ex = 1. 750 MeV (J = 2 +, T = 0), Ex = 2. 064 MeV (J = 2 +, T = 0). The resonance level at Ex = 6. 73 MeV has J = 4 −, T = 0. Tentative assignments to the other resonance levels will be discussed. The 6. 6 sec β+ decay is remarkable by being one of the few known 0 + → 0 + transitions. The β+ endpoint can best be arrived at by using a cycle involving the 0. 820 MeV γ-ray from 25 Mg(p, γ) 26 Al, the Q-value of the 28 Si(d, a) 26 Al transition to the 1. 055 MeV level in 26 Al, and a reevaluation of the 28 Si- 26 Mg mass difference. This yields Eβ+ = 3. 225 ± 0. 015 MeV, and ft = 3200 ± 80 sec. The ft value of this β+ transition can now be used for direct evaluation of the Fermi coupling constant gF. The result is: gF = (1. 391 ± 0. 017) × 10 − 49 erg cm 3...|$|R
5000|$|While {{the board}} of {{directors}} is generally conferred the power to manage the day-to-day affairs of a corporation, either by the statute, or by the articles of incorporation, this is always subject to limits, including the rights that shareholders have. For example, the Delaware General Corporation Law §141(a) says the [...] "business and affairs of every corporation... shall be managed by or under the direction of a board of directors, except as may be otherwise provided in this chapter or in its certificate of incorporation." [...] However, directors themselves are ultimately accountable to the general meeting through the vote. Invariably, shareholders hold the voting rights, though {{the extent to which these}} are useful can be conditioned by the constitution. The DGCL §141(k) gives an option to corporations to have a unitary board that can be removed by a majority of members [...] "without cause" [...] (i.e. a reason determined by the general meeting and not by a court), which reflects the old default common law position. However, Delaware corporations may also opt for a classified board of directors (e.g. where only a third of directors come up for election each year) where directors can only be removed [...] "with cause" [...] scrutinized by the courts. More corporations have classified boards after initial public offerings than a few years after going public, because institutional investors typically seek to change the corporation's rules to make directors more accountable. In principle, shareholders in Delaware corporations can make appointments to the board through a majority vote, and can also act to expand the size of the board and elect new directors with a majority. However, directors themselves will often control which candidates can be nominated to be appointed to the board. Under the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, §971 empowered the Securities and Exchange Commission to write a new SEC Rule 14a-11 that would allow shareholders to propose nominations for board candidates. The Act required the SEC to evaluate the economic effects of any rules it wrote, however when it did, the Business Roundtable challenged this in court. In Business Roundtable v <b>SEC,</b> Ginsburg <b>J</b> in the DC Circuit Court of Appeals went as far to say that the SEC had “acted arbitrarily and capriciously” in its rule making. After this, the Securities and Exchange Commission failed to challenge the decision, and abandoned drafting new rules. This means that in many corporations, directors continue to have a monopoly on nominating future directors.|$|R
40|$|Up to now, the {{rotational}} velocities {{of galaxies}} are not clearly understood and the experimental Tully Fisher rule, linking the total galactic mass {{to the fourth}} power of the velocity, through an acceleration coefficient of about 10 - 10 m/s 2 has not found a deep theoretical explanation. Tentative proposals (MOND theory of a modified Newton s law and extraneous dark matter) do not bring a definite clarification. We propose here {{a new approach to}} this problem, without exotic matter and using the classical Newton force. But we introduce a new additional universal acceleration, which could represent a universal expansion law valid at the scale level of a galaxy. We show that this hypothesis leads to a good description of the observed variations of the galactic transverse velocity. It can be considered {{as a consequence of the}} Scale Expansion Cosmos theory (<b>SEC)</b> introduced by <b>J.</b> Masreliez, but we postulate that the space expansion acceleration universally applies at any scale. We obtain a formal derivation of the Tully Fisher law, linking the constant galactic transverse velocity to its total mass, via the universal minimum acceleration. We derive a good estimate of the TF acceleration coefficient and show that expansion should be proportional to the square root of the local volumic mass density. Our conjecture is in fact a new dynamics principle which could be applied to many other physical problems at different scales. Applying it to the range of the solar planet system confirms the well known Kepler laws, at least as a valid approximation for the order of magnitude of the solar system...|$|R
