25|$|Based on {{something}} a (now ex) girlfriend <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I {{thought it was}} a negative picture, but then I realised it was positive because it’s a reconciliation after self-knowledge. It’s also ambiguous as to who’s speaking. Most of my paintings are based on experiences with people I know, usually on a drawing from life, but in this case from a photo I took of her.|$|E
25|$|A {{locomotive}} cut {{the car in}} half, killing {{my father}} instantly. When two brakemen jumped from the halted train, they saw a woman standing – dazed but erect – beside a mangled machine; with blood spouting (as the older <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me)</b> out of her head. One of her hands (the younger added) kept feeling her dress, {{as if trying to}} discover why it was wet. These men took my sixty-six year old mother by the arms and tried to lead her toward a nearby farmhouse; but she threw them off, strode straight to my father's body, and directed a group of scared spectators to cover him. When this had been done (and only then) she let them lead her away.|$|E

25|$|So I {{wrote this}} song that I loved and I {{sent it to}} them and he and Joel, I remember, left me a great message saying, I hate you, you bastard, I love this song. We're gonna have to do it. We're gonna have to re-build the Wiltern Theater, which they had taken down, it was {{a million dollars to}} re-do the ending... and I felt all his hostility for Universal. A guy named Sean Daniels, who was head of production, one day <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> well there is hostility because we {{understand}} you waited about eight months to come up with that final song and you never did it. I said, where'd you hear that? I did it in two days. He said, Jimmy Iovine. So I went to Jimmy Iovine and I said all that to his, yeah it's true, I know. I blamed you but you can't be upset with me. I'm not like a writer. I've gotta make my way with these people. I had to have a scapegoat.|$|E
25|$|When General Bell first {{sent me to}} Victor I {{offered him}} certain {{evidence}} {{in regard to the}} perpetrators of the Vindicator explosion, which he has failed to follow up, but which would have led to the arrest and conviction of the men who are responsible for the placing of that infernal machine. At about the 20th of January, 1904, by order of the adjutant of Teller County military district, and under special direction of Major T. E. McClelland and General F. M. Reardon, who was the Governor's confidential adviser regarding the conditions in that district, a series of street fights were commenced between men of Victor and soldiers of the National Guard on duty there. Each fight was planned by General Reardon or Major McClelland and carried out under their actual direction. Major McClelland's instructions were literally to knock them down, knock their teeth down their throats, bend in their faces, kick in their ribs and do everything except kill them. These fights continued more or less frequently up to the 22d of March. About the middle of February General Reardon called me into Major McClelland's office and asked me if I had a man in whom I could place absolute confidence. I called in Sergeant J. A. Chase, Troop C, First Cavalry, N. G. C., and, in the presence of Sergeant Chase, he stated to me that, owing to the refusal of the Mine Owners' Association to furnish the necessary money to meet the payroll of the troops, it had become necessary to take some steps to force them to put up the cash, and he desired me to take Sergeant Chase and hold up or shoot the men coming off shift at the Vindicator mine at 2 o'clock in the morning. I told General Reardon that I {{was under the impression that}} most of these men caught the electric car that stopped at the shaft house so that such a plan would be impracticable. He then <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that the same end could be reached if I would take the sergeant and fire fifty or sixty shots into the Vindicator shaft house at some time during the night. Owing to circumstances making it impossible for Sergeant Chase to accompany me, I took Sergeant Gordon Walter of the same troop and organization, and that same night did at about 12:30 o'clock fire repeatedly into the Vindicator and Lillie shaft house. Something like sixty shots were fired from our revolvers at this time. Afterwards we mounted our horses and rode into Victor and into the Military Club, reporting in person to General Reardon and Major McClelland. The next day General Reardon directed me to take Sergeant Walter and look over the ground in the rear of the Findlay mine with a view of repeating the performance there, but before the plan could be carried out General Reardon countermanded the order, stating his reason to be that the mine owners had promised to put up the necessary money the next day, which, as a matter of fact, they did. General Reardon, in giving me directions regarding the shooting up of the Vindicator shaft house, stated that Governor Peabody, General Bell, he himself, and I were the only ones who knew anything about the plan.|$|E

500|$|International Master Anthony Saidy {{recalled}} his last round {{encounter with the}} undefeated Fischer:Going into the final game I certainly {{did not expect to}} upset Fischer. I hardly knew the opening but played simply, and he went along with the scenario, opting for a N-v-B [...] endgame with a minimal edge. In the corridor, Evans <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> 'Good.

500|$|Morrison did not {{excel at}} academics, and focused instead on music. He practised his music in solitude, {{and was not}} skilled at socialising. [...] "One time he <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> it wasn't that he didn't want to talk, but tunes were running through his head all the time. He said he didn't know whether he'd been blessed or cursed because the words and music wouldn't go out of his head," [...] said his mother Violet.|$|E
500|$|Northern Ireland Secretary of State Paul Murphy congratulated Tyrone {{on their}} victory. The Ulster Council of the GAA congratulated {{both sets of}} fans, in {{particular}} the Tyrone fans who formed a guard of honour for the Armagh players as they returned to their team bus. Joe Kernan, manager of Armagh, also praised the opposition fans: [...] "...when the final whistle went and all the Tyrone supporters came running past me there wasn't one bad word <b>said.</b> <b>To</b> <b>me</b> that was great." ...|$|E

500|$|September 5, 1942: In {{the morning}} {{attended}} a special {{action from the}} women's concentration camp (Muslims); the most dreadful of horrors.

500|$|Becky {{is not an}} {{aspirational}} character, she {{strives to}} be normal, satisfied with a [...] "hard up lifestyle". She has changed since her early days, having calmed down a little {{in terms of her}} often out of control behaviour. Of this Kelly comments: [...] "If someone had <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that in three years' time she'd be Becky McDonald and would be behind the bar in the Rovers, I wouldn't have believed it [...] When Becky first came in she was a totally different character, but she's calmed down a lot and her softer side has come out." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1991, Dylan {{received}} a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award from American actor Jack Nicholson. The event {{coincided with the}} start of the Gulf War against Saddam Hussein, and Dylan performed [...] "Masters of War". Dylan then made a short speech, saying [...] "My daddy once <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> he said, 'Son, it is possible for you to become so defiled in this world that your own mother and father will abandon you. If that happens, God will believe in your ability to mend your own ways.'" [...] This sentiment was subsequently revealed to be a quote from 19th-century German Jewish intellectual, Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch.|$|E

500|$|Harper {{described}} {{the extent to}} which Duvall inhabited his character: [...] "Someone once <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> 'Well, how's Robert Duvall?' and I said, 'I don't know Robert Duvall. I know Mac Sledge very well. Beresford, too, said the transformation was so believable that he could feel his skin crawling up {{the back of his neck}} the first day of filming. Duvall made an effort to help Harper, who was making her film debut. While preparing to shoot a scene in which Mac and Rosa Lee fight, he yelled at a make-up artist in front of Harper to make her angry and fuel her performance; he apologized to the make-up artist after the scene was shot.|$|E
500|$|Island Records was keen on Drake {{promoting}} Bryter Layter through press interviews, radio {{sessions and}} live appearances. Drake, who {{by this time}} was smoking what Kirby has described as [...] "unbelievable amounts" [...] of cannabis and exhibiting [...] "the first signs of psychosis", refused. Disappointed by the reaction to Bryter Layter, he turned his thoughts inwards, and withdrew from family and friends. He rarely left his flat, and then only to play an occasional concert or to buy drugs. His sister recalled: [...] "This was a very bad time. He once <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that everything started to go wrong from [...] time on, and I think that was when things started to go wrong." ...|$|E
500|$|Streep's mother, {{whom she}} has {{compared}} in both appearance and manner to Dame Judi Dench, strongly encouraged her daughter and instilled confidence in her from a very young age. Streep has said: [...] "She was a mentor because she <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> 'Meryl, you're capable. You're so great.' She was saying, 'You {{can do whatever you}} put your mind to. If you're lazy, you're not going to get it done. But if you put your mind to it, you can do anything.' And I believed her." [...] Although Streep was naturally more introverted than her mother, at times when she later needed an injection of confidence in adulthood, she would consult her mother, asking her for advice.|$|E

500|$|... 'Judas' is {{a metaphor}} and an analogy about {{forgiveness}} and betrayal and things that haunt you {{in your life and}} how I believe that it's the darkness in your life that ultimately shines and illuminates the greater light that you have upon you. Someone once <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> 'If you have no shadows then you're not standing in the light.' So the song is about washing the feet of both good and evil and understanding and forgiving the demons from your past in order to move into the greatness of your future. I just like really aggressive metaphors—harder, thicker, darker—and my fans do as well. So it is a very challenging and aggressive metaphor, but it {{is a metaphor}}.|$|E
500|$|Morrissey had {{specific}} {{instructions on how}} he wanted the [...] "Hand in Glove" [...] single to be packaged. He told Rough Trade's art department that the single should have a paper label centre with four vents encircling the middle, in homage to singles from the 1960s. The cover to the single features a photograph of George O'Mara by Jim French, taken from Margaret Walters' history The Nude Male. The sleeve's homoerotic undertones elicited the reaction Morrissey was hoping for of unease and outrage. Rourke said when he showed the recording to his parents his father was [...] "mortified. He <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> 'that's a bloke's bum' and I said, 'yeah' but when he asked me why I just didn't {{have an answer for}} him".|$|E
500|$|While Oasis' {{first two}} singles, [...] "Supersonic" [...] and [...] "Shakermaker", were {{modestly}} received, it was [...] "Live Forever" [...] that [...] "got the world's attention". [...] "Live Forever" [...] became Oasis' first top ten hit, reaching number ten on the British singles charts in 1994. In 1995, the song became the band's first chart {{success in the}} United States, reaching number two and ten on Billboards Modern Rock Tracks and Mainstream Rock Tracks charts, respectively. Noel Gallagher commented on the praise given to the song: [...] "People <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> after 'Live Forever', 'Where are you gonna go after that?' And I was like, I don't think it's that good. I think it's a fucking good song, but I think I can do better." ...|$|E
