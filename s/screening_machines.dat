2500|$|The Food and Health Bureau of Hong Kong issued travel {{advice for}} Mexico on 26 April 2009, which advised Hong Kong {{residents}} not {{to travel to}} Mexico unless absolutely necessary. The first case reported was a Mexican who flew in from Shanghai. The most recent case (the tenth) {{was found in a}} 56-year-old American who had flown in from San Francisco. The Bureau also escalated the alert level from [...] "alert" [...] to [...] "serious" [...] on the same day, which activated health protection measures in all ports of entry of Hong Kong. As such, temperature <b>screening</b> <b>machines</b> are used at all checkpoints to identify passengers with fever and respiratory symptoms. Any passenger who fails the temperature test and confirmed having a fever will be quarantined and sent to public hospital for further investigation. Hong Kong also {{became one of the first}} jurisdictions to declare swine flu as a notifiable disease, and much of the procedures against the spread of the swine flu were learned from the 2003 SARS outbreak, of which Hong Kong was the epicenter of the outbreak.|$|E

Much of the procedures against the contagion were learned from the 2003 SARS outbreak, of which Hong Kong was the epicenter of the outbreak. On 1 May, the first case in Hong Kong and also the first in Asia was confirmed. The Mexican patient arrived in Hong Kong on 30 April. Metropark Hotel Wanchai, where the patient stayed, was quarantined. After the first case was confirmed, Hong Kong's response level was raised from [...] "serious" [...] to [...] "emergency".|$|E
50|$|Tumbler <b>{{screening}}</b> <b>machines</b> {{have higher}} output per meter square of screening {{than the other}} vibratory <b>screening</b> <b>machines.</b> It requires lower power, consumption at different speeds at different levels and sorting at each level. It has a lower maintenance and is compact. It has a disadvantage of blocking of the mesh in case of batch sieving if the particles are fed immediately inside the machine barrel. Hence, the feeding rate shouldn't be very high. Another disadvantage of tumbler screening technique {{is that it would}} not be effective for higher particle sizes, which range from six inches to +20 mesh.If a number of tumbler <b>screening</b> <b>machines</b> are operated in parallel in a building without building statics configured accordingly, dynamic residual forces can generate resonance in vibration which in worst case can eventually lead to connection elements to the screening machine shearing off.Particle - particle and machine boundary collisions in the tumbling motion of the rotating structure will dissipate kinetic energy due to normal and frictional contact losses.|$|E

50|$|The tumbler {{screening}} {{technique has}} many applications. It is utilized in {{the chemical and}} food industry {{in order to produce}} high quality powder with sensitive property; this technique can also provide a moderate treatment for the powder. This technique can also be used as a high efficiency method of recycling high quality raw materials. In food processing, simpler tumbler <b>screening</b> <b>machines</b> with 1 deck and screen sizes from 1 to 4 mm are used to removed foreign bodies and ensure the safety of the products. Furthermore, this technique is also applied in the metallurgy and ceramic industry. Finally, this technique is popular in mining industry because of the long operating life of the tumbler <b>screening</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|E

50|$|The fine {{balancing}} procedure called multi-balance aids in almost eliminating the residual imbalances in tumbler <b>screening</b> <b>machines,</b> thus leading to less risk of {{vibration and resonance}} effects in steel fabrications or concrete buildings.The highly flexible docking system uses pneumatically operated lifting system with lifting rods and puts no additional weight on machine.

50|$|Most {{modern day}} gyratory <b>screening</b> <b>machines</b> employ {{the use of}} screen cleaners, which act to prevent any {{clogging}} of the gyratory sifters. The motion and mechanism of a gyratory screener enables more energy to be imparted onto the cleaners, thus actively preventing the occurrence of build-up on the gyratory sifters. In the long run, the prevention of build-up in the sifters would enable the gyratory screener to have a longer lifespan.|$|E

50|$|This is the {{separation}} of material which the fine particles fall through the screen and the oversize particles contain on the above screen, unfortunately {{a certain percentage of}} fine particles usually remain on the above screen after the oscillation. Moreover, without good maintenance, long-term using may cause wearing of screen surface which lead to oversize particles fall through screen.The efficiency of tumbler <b>screening</b> <b>machine</b> η can be express as: η = Mp÷MF, where Mp is the mass of fine particles which pass through the screen surface during the operation of tumbler <b>screening</b> <b>machine,</b> and MF is the mass of fine particles which in the initial feed of material to the tumbler <b>screening</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|R

50|$|High {{frequency}} {{vibrating screens}} {{are the most}} important <b>screening</b> <b>machines</b> primarily utilised in the mineral processing industry. They are used to separate feeds containing solid and crushed ores down to approximately 200μm in size, and are applicable to both perfectly wetted and dried feed. The frequency of the screen is mainly controlled by an electromagnetic vibrator which is mounted above and directly connected to the screening surface. Its high frequency characteristics differentiates it from a normal vibrating screen. The high frequency vibrating screens usually operates at an inclined angle, traditionally varying between 0 and 25 degrees and can go up to a maximum of 45 degrees. Besides, it should operate at a low stroke and has a frequency ranging from 1500 - 7200 RPM.|$|E
