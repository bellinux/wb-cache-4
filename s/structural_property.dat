25|$|Chemical {{substitution}} {{and coordination}} polyhedra explain this common feature of minerals. In nature, minerals are not pure substances, and are contaminated by whatever other elements {{are present in}} the given chemical system. As a result, it is possible for one element to be substituted for another. Chemical substitution will occur between ions of a similar size and charge; for example, K+ will not substitute for Si4+ because of chemical and structural incompatibilities caused by a big difference in size and charge. A common example of chemical substitution is that of Si4+ by Al3+, which are close in charge, size, and abundance in the crust. In the example of plagioclase, there are three cases of substitution. Feldspars are all framework silicates, which have a silicon-oxygen ratio of 2:1, and the space for other elements is given by the substitution of Si4+ by Al3+ to give a base unit of −; without the substitution, the formula would be charge-balanced as SiO2, giving quartz. The significance of this <b>structural</b> <b>property</b> will be explained further by coordination polyhedra. The second substitution occurs between Na+ and Ca2+; however, the difference in charge has to accounted for by making a second substitution of Si4+ by Al3+.|$|E

The {{purpose of}} this study is to relate the {{dielectric}} constant data of thin film samples of superconducting niobium nitride to the <b>structural</b> <b>properties</b> of the films. A rotating analyzer ellipsometer was used to measure the complex dielectric constant of four thin film samples of superconducting niobium Nitride over the 1. 9 to 3. 5 eV energy range. Each sample was produced by using a different growth rate, thereby also yielding different dielectric constant spectra. The corresponding <b>structural</b> <b>properties</b> of each sample were approximated by using an effective medium theory to relate the dielectric constant data to the <b>structural</b> <b>properties.</b> The superconducting transition temperature of each of the samples was measured by other researchers, thus presenting an independent measure of <b>structural</b> <b>properties.</b> It was found that the <b>structural</b> <b>properties</b> as determined optically correlated with the <b>structural</b> <b>properties</b> as determined by superconductivity measurements.

40|$|Abstract—The {{eigenvalues}} of matrices {{representing the}} struc-ture of large-scale complex networks present {{a wide range}} of applications, from the analysis of dynamical processes taking place in the network to spectral techniques aiming to rank the importance of nodes in the network. A common approach to study the relationship between the structure of a network and its eigenvalues is to use synthetic random networks in which <b>structural</b> <b>properties</b> of interest, such as degree distributions, are prescribed. Although very common, synthetic models present two major flaws: (i) These models are only suitable to study a very limited range of <b>structural</b> <b>properties,</b> and (ii) they implicitly induce <b>structural</b> <b>properties</b> that are not directly controlled and can deceivingly influence the network eigenvalue spectrum. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to overcome these limitations. Our approach is not based on synthetic models, instead, we use algebraic graph theory and convex optimization to study how <b>structural</b> <b>properties</b> influence the spectrum of eigenvalues of the network. Using our approach, we can compute with low computational overhead global spectral properties of a network from its local <b>structural</b> <b>properties.</b> We illustrate our approach by studying how <b>structural</b> <b>properties</b> of online social networks influence their eigenvalue spectra.

50|$|Much {{research}} has been done on glycogen degradation through studying the structure and function of glycogen phosphorylase, the key regulatory enzyme of glycogen degradation. On the other hand, much less is known about the structure of glycogen synthase, the key regulatory enzyme of glycogen synthesis. The crystal structure of glycogen synthase from Agrobacterium tumefaciens, however, has been determined at 2.3 A resolution. In its asymmetric form, glycogen synthase is found as a dimer, whose monomers are composed of two Rossmann-fold domains. This <b>structural</b> <b>property,</b> among others, is shared with related enzymes, such as glycogen phosphorylase and other glycosyltransferases of the GT-B superfamily. Nonetheless, a more recent characterization of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) glycogen synthase crystal structure reveals that the dimers may actually interact to form a tetramer. Specifically, The inter-subunit interactions are mediated by the α15/16 helix pairs, forming allosteric sites between subunits in one combination of dimers and active sites between subunits in the other combination of dimers. Since the structure of eukaryotic glycogen synthase is highly conserved among species, glycogen synthase likely forms a tetramer in humans as well.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the first}} points of {{regulation}} for proteostasis is during translation. This is accomplished via {{the structure of the}} ribosome, a complex central to translation. These two characteristics shape the way the protein folds and influences the proteins future interactions. The synthesis of a new peptide chain using the ribosome is very slow and the ribosome can even be stalled when it encounters a rare codon, a codon found at low concentrations in the cell. These pauses provide an opportunity for an individual protein domain to have the necessary time to become folded before the production of following domains. This facilitates the correct folding of multi-domain proteins.The newly synthesized peptide chain exits the ribosome into the cellular environment through the narrow ribosome exit channel (width: 10Å to 20Å, length 80Å). Due to space restriction in the exit channel the nascent chain already forms secondary and limited tertiary structures. For example, an alpha helix is one such <b>structural</b> <b>property</b> that is commonly induced in this exit channel. At the same time the exit channel also prevents premature folding by impeding large scale interactions within the peptide chain which would require more space.|$|E
