5|$|Whilst {{working on}} the Midland Railway's main line, Barlow {{established}} that the replacement of <b>sleepers</b> was a larger {{part of the cost}} of track maintenance than the replacement of rails because the <b>sleepers</b> decayed more quickly than the rails wore-out and needed renewal more often. To remove the cost of providing and replacing <b>sleepers,</b> he developed and patented his own rail design in 1849. It had a wide flanged profile which could be laid directly on to track ballast without the need for <b>sleepers,</b> with just periodic tie-bars to maintain the correct gauge. Known as the Barlow rail, it was widely used, especially by the Great Western Railway.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak ordered 235 Superliner I {{cars from}} Pullman-Standard on April 2, 1975, with {{deliveries}} scheduled for between January 1977 and June 1978. The order then consisted of 120 coaches, 55 <b>sleepers,</b> 34 diners, and 26 lounges. Amtrak soon increased {{the order to}} 284 cars: it added 30 coaches, 15 <b>sleepers,</b> 5 diners, and deleted 1 lounge. The initial order cost $143.6 million; with the additional cars and other payments the cost rose to $250 million.|$|E

40|$|Structural {{optimisation}} of composite railway <b>sleeper</b> {{is becoming}} an important area of research to effectively use composite materials and minimising their manufacturing costs. This study used the finite element approach to structurally optimise a composite <b>sleeper</b> for a mainline railway track and evaluate their performance. Strand 7 finite element simulation is executed to achieve this goal. This study presents the optimised shape of a <b>sleeper</b> which requires only one-third volume {{to that of a}} standard rectangular <b>sleeper.</b> The performance of the optimised <b>sleeper</b> is determined in a high and low stiffness support foundation and the results obtained from this analysis are compared with the behaviour of traditional timber <b>sleeper.</b> The new composite <b>sleeper</b> showed comparable behaviour with that of timber <b>sleeper</b> and performed within their allowable limit. ...|$|R

5|$|Construction from Brill to Oxford {{had not yet}} begun. Further Acts of Parliament {{were granted}} in 1892 and 1894 varying the {{proposed}} route slightly and allowing for its electrification, but no work was carried out other than some preliminary surveying. On 1 April 1894, with the proposed extension to Oxford still intended, the O exercised a clause of the 1888 Act and took over the Tramway. Work began on upgrading the line {{in preparation for the}} extension. The line from Quainton Road to Brill was relaid with improved rails on transverse <b>sleepers,</b> replacing the original flimsy rails and longitudinal <b>sleepers.</b> At around this time two Manning Wardle locomotives were brought into use.|$|E

5|$|The {{poor quality}} gravel soil, {{which had been}} the initial reason for the site's cheapness and its {{selection}} as {{the site for the}} cemetery, was poorly suited as a railway trackbed.

5|$|A survey {{conducted}} by the LNWR found that the bridges and culverts were in a fair condition, but the stations were dirty. Fences were decayed, rails needed replacing, some <b>sleepers</b> were rotten, and the ballast was soft and shaley. The LNWR addressed these problems over the coming years.|$|E

5|$|Between December, 1941 and June, 1945 U.S. railroads carried almost 44 million armed {{services}} personnel. As {{there were not}} enough cars and coaches available to meet the massive need for troop transit created by World War II, in late 1943 the U.S. Office of Defense Transportation contracted with the Pullman Company to build 2,400 troop <b>sleepers,</b> and with American Car and Foundry (ACF) to build 440 troop kitchen cars.|$|E

5|$|After closure {{the tunnel}} was sealed, {{although}} it remains structurally intact inside. The {{site of the}} lower terminus was cleared and is now an empty site surrounded with construction hoarding. There is a small roundabout directly outside the south tunnel portal. Hereson Road station is now a used car dealership. Four of the cars were sold to the Hollycombe Steam Collection and remain in use, while the remaining three {{were given to the}} Hampshire Narrow Gauge Railway Society. Most of the rails and <b>sleepers</b> were sold to the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway.|$|E
5|$|Although the LNC {{proposed}} {{to convert the}} cemetery branch line into a grand avenue running from Brookwood station through the cemetery, this never took place. The rails and <b>sleepers</b> of the branch were removed in around 1947, and the trackbed became a dirt road and footpath. The run-around loop and stub of the branch line west of Brookwood station remained operational as sidings, before being dismantled on 30 November 1964. After {{the closure of the}} branch line the buildings of the two cemetery stations remained open as refreshment kiosks, and were renamed North Bar and South Bar.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Sleeper</b> {{appears in}} the Captain America: Super Soldier video game. The <b>Sleeper</b> was {{discovered}} during the Middle Ages by Baron Zemo's ancestor, Heller Zemo. Though they couldn't understand what the <b>Sleeper</b> is, Heller Zemo and his men realized it is something important. Castle Zemo was soon built around the <b>Sleeper's</b> resting place. Hundreds of years later, during World War II, the Castle was owned by Baron Heinrich Zemo, who {{thought that he was}} destined to awake the <b>Sleeper</b> and use it to help him in his world conquest. However, he unwisely made an alliance with Johann Schmidt, commander of the Nazi research division HYDRA. On Schmidt's orders, the soldiers of HYDRA occupied Castle Zemo, where Schmidt's top scientist Arnim Zola studied the <b>Sleeper.</b> In 1944, the castle was infiltrated by the American Super Soldier named Captain America. After he defeated the guards, he confronted Zola's robot while the <b>Sleeper</b> awoke and destroyed one Allied plane. However, the <b>Sleeper</b> was finally destroyed by Captain America.|$|R

5|$|Due to {{the time}} {{required}} to electrify the network the MTT continued to run horse trams until 1914. The cost of purchasing the tramways was funded by treasury bills and the act capped total construction costs at £12,000 per mile of track. £457,000 was let in contracts to March 1908 for construction of the tramways, trams, strengthening the Adelaide bridge over the River Torrens and associated works. The official ceremony starting track construction was in May 1908, with tracks originally laid on Jarrah <b>sleepers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Equipped {{with special}} Allied Full Cushion {{high-speed}} swing-motion trucks, Pullman troop <b>sleepers</b> {{were designed to}} be fully interchangeable with all other passenger equipment. The units came equipped with end doors {{similar to those found}} on standard railway cars, but had no vestibules. Loading and unloading of passengers was accomplished via wide doors positioned on each side {{at the center of the}} cars with built-in trap doors and steps. Light and ventilation was provided by ten window units mounted on each side, each equipped with rolling black out shades and wire mesh screens.|$|E
