40|$|A {{variety of}} primary hematologic {{disorders}} were described, all characterised by ineffective hematopoiesis, peripheral blood cytopenias, and hypercellular bone marrow (Bjorkman, 1956, Rheingold et aJ., 1963, Linman et aJ., 1978). Lack of uniform definitions for these disorders, {{often referred to}} as <b>smoldering</b> <b>leukemia,</b> preleukemia or refractory anemia, resulted in both difficulties in classification and problems in predicting disease outcome. In an effort to resolve these problems, in 1982 the French-AmericanBritish (F AB) Cooperative Study group proposed a new classification system for these bone marrow disorders and termed them myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (Bennett et aJ., 1982). Based on cellular morphology and on the number of blast cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow, five subtypes of MDS were defined: Refractory anemia (RA), refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS), refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-t), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Cytopenia were {{recognized}} in three cats infected with feline leukemia virus. In one cat, marrow blast cells were increased in number, and {{a diagnosis of}} aleukemic leukemia was made. The disease progressed slowly for 3 ? 4 months before terminating in acute myelo-monocytic leukemia, recognized as a blast crisis in blood. In the other two cats, neutropenia and altered granulopoiesis in bone marrow preceded development of myeloid leukemia. Preleukemia and <b>smoldering</b> <b>leukemia</b> are terms used to describe a group of hematologic abnormalities that precede acute myeloid leukemia in man. The term preleukemia refers to patients with acquired chronic cytopenias who develop mye-loproliferative disorders (acute myeloid leukemia or myelomonocytic leukemia) months or years later [5]. These syndromes also are called hemopoietic dysplasias [27]. Laboratory abnormalities have dominated the clinical picture of preleukemia; anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurring singly or in various combi-nations {{have been the most}} common findings [29]. In none of these disorders is there an excess of leukemic blast cells in either the bone marrow or blood at the onset, and the conclusion that the condition was preleukemic can be made only in retrospec...|$|E
40|$|Hypoplastic leukemia {{has been}} found {{frequently}} in the aged, but its clinical characteristics in relation to age are still obscure. In the present study, clinical and hematological findings from 17 elderly hypoplastic acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) patients were compared with those from 25 elderly typical AML patients. In hypoplastic AML in the old, fever, bleeding tendency, splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy tended to be less frequent. Leukocytopenia, a low percentage of leukemic cells, and lymphocytosis and monocytosis in the peripheral blood seemed to be characteristic of hypoplastic AML. Erythroid hyperplasia with maturation arrest and an increase of type III sideroblasts in the bone marrow were also recognized in hypoplastic cases. In cases without systemic chemotherapy, the median survival from the presumptive onset of leukemia were 12. 0 months in hypoplastic patients and 2. 5 months in typical patients. In cases with systemic chemotherapy, the median survival of hypoplastic patients was 8. 0 months and that of typical patients, 6. 5 months. These findings {{suggest that there is}} a close relationship between hypoplastic AML in the old and <b>smoldering</b> acute <b>leukemia.</b> On the basis of the present results, hypoplastic AML in the old is thought to be different from typical AML in the old not only clinically and hematologically but also in the response to chemotherapy. The stratification of the hypoplasia in the bone marrow should be examined in order to establish the optimal chemotherapeutic regimen for acute leukemia in the old...|$|R
40|$|SummaryInterleukin- 2 (IL- 2) regulates {{lymphocyte}} function by signaling through heterodimerization of the IL- 2 Rβ and γc receptor subunits. IL- 2 is {{of considerable}} therapeutic interest, but harnessing its actions in a controllable manner remains a challenge. Previously, we have engineered an IL- 2 “superkine” with enhanced affinity for IL- 2 Rβ. Here, we describe next-generation IL- 2 variants that function as “receptor signaling clamps. ” They retained high affinity for IL- 2 Rβ, inhibiting binding of endogenous IL- 2, but their interaction with γc was weakened, attenuating IL- 2 Rβ-γc heterodimerization. These IL- 2 analogs acted as partial agonists and differentially affected lymphocytes poised at distinct activation thresholds. Moreover, one variant, H 9 -RETR, antagonized IL- 2 and IL- 15 better than blocking antibodies against IL- 2 Rα or IL- 2 Rβ. Furthermore, this mutein prolonged survival {{in a model}} of graft-versus-host disease and blocked spontaneous proliferation of <b>smoldering</b> adult T cell <b>leukemia</b> (ATL) T cells. This receptor-clamping approach might be a general mechanism-based strategy for engineering cytokine partial agonists for therapeutic immunomodulation...|$|R
40|$|Pathogenesis of {{atypical}} leukemia (hypoplastic <b>leukemia</b> and <b>smoldering</b> acute <b>leukemia)</b> {{is still}} unknown. The author intended {{to find the}} factors inducing its unique clinical course by comparing 5 cases of atypical leukemia with the same numder of typical acute leukemia {{with respect to their}} blasts cell size, laveling index with (3) H-thymidine and pattern of tissue growth by the bone marrow culture method devised by us. And obtained the following results. 1) The size of 100 blasts chosen randomely out of the bone marrow smear prepared from 5 cases of atypical leukemia was compared with those of typical acute leukemia. The mean val-ue of the former group was 41. 9 ± 12. 3, while that of the latter was 61. 4 ± 16. 7. There fore, the size of blasts in the atypical leukemia proved to be somewhat smaller than those of the typical acute leukemia. 2) The mean value of laveling index with (3) H-thymidine of the blasts in the bone marrow of the former group was 6. 4 %, while that of the latter was 12. 9 %. 3) The growth pattern of the bone marrow tissue from the 5 patients with atypical leukemia was as follows: The bone marrow explants from these patients were generally hypoplastic, consisting of an increase of fat cells intermingled with several foci scattered made of leukemic blasts. The growth zone revealed much lower cell density than that of the typical acute leukemia. The margin of the growth zone, however, sharply bordered and similar to the pattern of typical acute leukemia. Cells observed predominantly in the growth zone composed of immature leukemic cells and mature lymphocytes throughout the culture period of 24 - 48 hours. From these results, it is assumed that most of leukemic blasts in the bone marrow of the patients with atpical leukemia are "dormant cells", i. e. belong to a nondividing compartment, and reduced multiplication rate is closely related to their mild clinical courses...|$|R
40|$|According to a {{tendency}} of {{an increase of}} acute leukemia in the aged people, we have recently seen not a few patients with acute leukemia of an atypical variety. These cases "smolder along" with mild clinical features {{for a period of}} months to years. They were designated as "smoldering acute leukemia" by Rheingold in 1963. The author summarised the clinical and hematological features of one's own experienced cases of acute leukemia belonging to this category. The author intended further to find the possible causes inducing these atypical clinical courses through cytogenetic analysis of leukemic cells in the bone marrow, and obtained the following results. 1. Clinical Studies 1) Six of 7 cases were males and 5 cases were the aged patients over 50 years. Five of 7 cases did not reveal any typical signs and symptoms indicating acute leukemia, such as high grade fever, severe bleeding tendency, hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy. 2) In the peripheral blood, all of them were aleukemic, i. e., none did show leukocytosis, 0 to 10 % at most of leukemic blasts were found. 3) In the bone marrow, 5 of them showed hypoplastic marrow and the other 2 cases normoplastic and hyperplastic. High percentage of leukemic myeloblasts or promyelocytes were observed in all cases. 4) No antileukemic agents except the minimum dose of steroid hormon and repeated intermittent blood transfusion were given to the patients. The patients survived over one year except one case that died of pneumonia at 8. 5 months after treatment was started. Ⅱ. Cytogenetic Studies Cytogenetic studies were done on bone marrow samples using a modification of the direct method of Tjio and Whang. 1) Four of 7 cases revealed a normal diploid mode with 46 chromosomes. Aneuploidy was however, found in the remaining three cases, one case of hypodiploidy with 45 chromosomes and 2 cases of hyperdiploidy with 47 chromosomes. 2) Four of 7 cases revealed a normal karyotype, wheras the other three cases revealed a remarkable changes of karyotype. 3) The chromosome anomaly common to all cases were not found. 4) No significant relationship was observed between the clinical features of these cases and their chromosome anomalies of the leukemic cells in the bone marrow. From these results it is concluded that the atypical clinical course of the <b>smoldering</b> acute <b>leukemia</b> is not controled solely by the cytogenetic factors of the leukemic cells...|$|R
40|$|Recently {{some cases}} of {{atypical}} leukemia have been reported. The term of atypical leukemia is usually applied to cases with aleukemic findings, hypoplastic or hypocellular marrow {{and a low}} percentage of leukemic cells. On the other hand, some cases with a benign course were reported as smoldering acute lenkemia, It has been already ascertained that hypoplastic preleukemic stage is different from so-called hypoplastic anemia and the leukemic process is progressing latently at that time. However, whether this stage {{can be seen in}} all leukemic cases or in only some limitted types is still unknown. In this paper, this problem was studied through clical and hematological examinations of 7 cases with hypoplastic preleukemic stage, 22 cases of atypical leukemia and 80 cases of typical acute myelocytic leukemia. 1. Hypoplastic preleukemic stage and atypical leukemia tended to be more frequently seen in elderly males. In these 2 groups the absence of splenomegaly was thought to be a characteristic finding compared with typical leukemia. 2. Ten of 22 cases of atypical leukemia were treated under the clinical diagnosis of hypoplastic anemia untill the diagnosis of leukemia was made in our clinic. Retrospective examinations of bone marrow smear were done in 5 of these 10 cases. One of these cases was diagnosed to be leukemia at that time. Four cases denied to be leukemia, however, they were thought to have hypoplastic preleukemic stage at that time {{because of the presence of}} a slight increase of myeloblasts or a left shift of granulocyte series and a relative erythroid hyperplasia. On the other hand, these preleukemic changes were not observed in cases of typical leukemia. 4. Most of hypoplastic preleukemic cases and atypical leukemia showed atypical hematological findings during all their clinical courses. 5. Median survival times from the presumptive onset of leukemia and from the diagnosis of leukemia were 13. 5 months and 3. 3 months in 7 cases with hypoplastic preleukemic stage (excluding one unknown case). In 22 cases of atypical leukemia (excluding 3 unknown cases) they were 10. 0 months and 4. 5 months, respectively. On the other hand, most patients with typical leukemia treated with the same agents as those used for the above 2 groups died within 3 months. These results suggest that not all leukemia is not preceded by hypoplastic preleukemic stage and also suggest that there may be a close relationship between this stage and atypical leukemia described as "hypoplastic leukemia" and "low percentage leukemia". Furtheremore, these cases included hypoplastic preleukemia and atypical leukemia may correspond clinically to the so- "called <b>smoldering</b> acute <b>leukemia.</b> ...|$|R
