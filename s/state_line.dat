5|$|SR167 was {{designated}} in 1923 as a short connector from SR 7 to the Pennsylvania <b>state</b> <b>line</b> east of Richmond Center, an unincorporated village. In 1928, the route was rerouted from Jefferson to the Pennsylvania <b>state</b> <b>line</b> east of Pierpoint. The new western terminus was in SR 46/84 (now SR 307) in Jefferson, {{and the eastern}} terminus was the <b>state</b> <b>line,</b> north of Richmond Center. The route became concurrent with US6 beginning in 1932, between SR7 and the Pennsylvania <b>state</b> <b>line.</b> In 1939, the highway was rerouted north of its concurrency with US 6, replacing SR 538. In about 1969, SR 11 opened at SR 167 as an at-grade intersection, and seven years later, an interchange replaced the intersection.

US8's eastern end was rerouted along a separate bridge over the Menominee River to a new terminus at an intersection with US2 in Norway in 1929. US141 was fully paved in Wisconsin in the early 1930s; the last segment to be completed was between Pound and Abrams.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature {{created a}} system of {{unsigned}} legislative routes across the state of New York.

The highway also continued from Grayling northward through Gaylord to Cheboygan. Seven years later, the United States Numbered Highway System was created on November 11, 1926, and in Michigan's initial assignments, US27 replaced M-14 between Lansing and Cheboygan, while US127 ran from Lansing southward through Jackson to the Somerset area where it turned southeasterly, replacing the former M-80 and M-34 through Adrian to Toledo, Ohio. The remainder of M-14 south to the <b>state</b> <b>line</b> remained a shortened M-14.|$|E

5|$|In May 1911, the Pennsylvania General Assembly {{passed the}} Sproul Roads Act, which created the Pennsylvania state road system {{and allowed the}} state to take over turnpikes. Baltimore Pike was {{designated}} Legislative Route 42 from the Maryland <b>state</b> <b>line</b> northwest to the borough of Gettysburg. The Sproul Roads Act was challenged as being unconstitutional, but the Pennsylvania Supreme Court upheld the legislation on June 27, 1913. The state took over the Gettysburg and Petersburg Turnpike and abolished tolls the next day, {{just in time for}} the March to Gettysburg ahead of the 1913 Gettysburg reunion. Baltimore Pike was improved as a macadam road from the <b>state</b> <b>line</b> to Gettysburg by 1916. The highway from the <b>state</b> <b>line</b> to US 15 at the intersection of Baltimore Street and Steinwehr Avenue (then Emmitsburg Road) was designated the northernmost part of US 140 in 1927. US 140 was widened and resurfaced with concrete from Gettysburg to Littlestown between 1941 and 1943. The remainder of the highway through Littlestown to the Maryland <b>state</b> <b>line</b> was widened and resurfaced with asphalt between 1943 and 1953. US 140's interchange with modern US 15 was completed when the thentwo-lane US 15 bypass opened in June 1963, immediately before the centennial of the Battle of Gettysburg.|$|E

From here north to the terminus in Mottville, M-103 parallels the St. Joseph River running through farmlands. South of town, it runs past the Mottville Township Cemetery.

5|$|M-125 {{starts at}} the <b>state</b> <b>line</b> as the {{continuation}} of Detroit Avenue running northward from Toledo. Once across the <b>state</b> <b>line,</b> the roadway takes on the Dixie Highway name and passes a residential subdivision. The highway runs north-northeasterly roughly parallel with, and between, both US24 and I-75 through farm land in rural Monroe County. The trunkline passes through the community of Erie before intersecting with Conn. M-125 (Summit Street) north of town. That unsigned connector is a state highway that links M-125 with I-75 to the south. Continuing north, M-125 intersects Luna Pier Road, which to the west is the unsigned Conn. US24 that offers a path to US24 (Telegraph Road).|$|E

The highway crosses farmland between the two termini. In 2008, 4,239vehicles used the highway {{on a daily basis}} in MDOT's average annual daily traffic (AADT) survey. The survey calculated how many vehicles used the roadway on average each day. The 2008 counts also showed that 75trucks were included in the total. For 2009, the figured dropped to 3,738vehicles and 67trucks. M-217 is not listed on the National Highway System, a system of highways important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E

5|$|M-62 {{was formed}} before 1924 along {{a portion of}} its current routing. The {{trunkline}} started at the Indiana <b>state</b> <b>line</b> and ran north through Edwardsburg and Cassopolis.

The southern section was moved {{by the end of}} 1925 to follow a more direct routing between Edwardsburg and the <b>state</b> <b>line.</b> An extension in 1930 moved the northern terminus west into Berrien County, ending in Eau Claire. The final few miles of highway were transferred back in local control around 1957. Before the transfer, M-62 ran concurrently with M-140 west and continued into Eau Claire. After the transfer, M-62 ended at the eastern M-140 junction and the concurrency was removed.|$|E
