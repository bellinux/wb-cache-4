40|$|NOVELTY - The {{mechanism}} has two interconnected gripper arms (1, 2), {{which are}} always in lateral contact with a wafer disc (3) edge at one end. These ends can move radially outwards by pressure, or tension, of the holder. The other ends of the gripper arms are secured in a holder (7). DETAILED DESCRIPTION - There are elastic elements, which can return {{the ends of the}} gripper arms into the initial position after release of the holder. The gripper arms are preferably made of titanium. The disc engaging ends of the gripper arms are fitted with <b>slide</b> <b>shoes</b> (5) with recesses for the disc retention. USE - For handling semiconductor wafers, etc. ADVANTAGE - No need for vacuum for reliable, contamination-free gripping of wafer, even of large size...|$|E

50|$|In 1896, {{the former}} Rock Creek line experimented {{with a new}} power system on U Street NW between 9th Street NW and 18th Street NW.

40|$|International audienceThe {{return of}} slurry {{is the most}} {{important}} means of fertilization in grassland dairy farming. Broadcast application of slurry induces air pollution by ammonia. Alternatives to broadcast application like <b>sliding</b> <b>shoe</b> or injection have therefore been introduced. These alternatives might, however, cause higher N losses by nitrate leaching because N prevented from volatilization may not completely be utilized for dry matter production. Information on the interactive effects of amount of N input and slurry application technique on nitrate leaching from productive organic–sandy soils are still scarce. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that slurry application by <b>sliding</b> <b>shoe</b> or injection leads to larger NO 3 -N losses via leaching than broadcast application. In a 4 -year experiment on cut grassland, we applied N at 0, 160, 240, and 320  kg ha− 1  year− 1 using four application techniques: {{in the form of a}} chemical-synthetic N fertilizer or as cattle slurry applied broadcast, by <b>sliding</b> <b>shoe</b> or shallow injection. We assessed nitrate leaching during winter using suction cups. Additionally, we determined herbage dry matter yields, N offtake, and soil mineral N content to compile N balances for the individual treatments based on these data. Our results show that nitrate leaching during winter did not differ significantly among treatments of N application technique. Nitrate leaching increased significantly with increasing amount of N input, but was on average lower than 16. 5  kg N ha− 1 for application rates of up to 320  kg N ha− 1. Soil mineral N content in autumn was a reasonably good predictor for nitrate leaching, with R 2 of 0. 65. The proportion of nitrate leaching of positive N surpluses increased in the order broadcast, <b>sliding</b> <b>shoe,</b> injection, and chemical-synthetic N application. Our findings demonstrate that the amount of N input but not the technique of application results in a significant effect on nitrate leaching...|$|R

5000|$|The {{third rail}} is usually located outside the two running rails, but on some systems it is mounted between them. The {{electricity}} is {{transmitted to the}} train {{by means of a}} <b>sliding</b> <b>shoe,</b> which is held in contact with the rail. On many systems, an insulating cover is provided above the third rail to protect employees working near the track; sometimes the shoe is designed to contact the side (called [...] "side running") or bottom (called [...] "bottom running" [...] or [...] "under-running") of the third rail, allowing the protective cover to be mounted directly to its top surface. When the <b>shoe</b> <b>slides</b> along the top surface, it is referred to as [...] "top running". When the <b>shoe</b> <b>slides</b> along the bottom surface, it is less affected by the build-up of snow, ice, or leaves, and reduces the chances of a person being electrocuted by coming in contact with the rail. Examples of systems using under-running third rail include Metro-North in the southern Hudson Valley and the New York metropolitan area; the SEPTA Market-Frankford Line in Philadelphia; and London's Docklands Light Railway.|$|R

2500|$|The grooved {{trolley wheel}} was used on many large city systems through the 1940s and 1950s; it was {{generally}} used on systems with [...] "old" [...] style round cross sectional overhead wire. The trolley wheel was problematic at best; the circumferential contact of the grooved wheel bearing {{on the underside of}} the overhead wire provided minimal electrical contact and tended to arc excessively, increasing overhead wire wear [...] The newer <b>sliding</b> carbon trolley <b>shoe</b> was generally used with a newer grooved overhead trolley wire of a roughly [...] "figure 8" [...] cross section. The <b>sliding</b> trolley <b>shoe</b> provided better electrical contact (with a reduction in arcing), and it dramatically reduced overhead wire wear.

40|$|The {{wealth of}} intormation already {{available}} {{on the subject of}} brakes is indicated by a prolific bibliography. There is little scope for new subject matter, the only novelty being in the approach to the problems. Emphasis is laid on the importance of discriminating between the characteristics of the linkage and of the brake units themselves, and the paper concentrates on the latter. Shoe characteristics are considered separately from those of the complete brake assembly, and a standard “three-to-one ” shoe is evolved as a common basis on which to compare the different types of brake. Formulae are given for both shoe and brake factors and it is shown that, by using their reciprocals, the form of the equations becomes remarkably simple, and that, when thus plotted, the significant values are more easily read. The features considered most desirable in a brake are listed and a preference is shown for the two-leading-shoe brake using <b>sliding</b> <b>shoes</b> and hydraulic or pneumatic operation. Some outstanding problems, such as improved cooling of the brake path, are raised. Wear, squeal, and fade are discussed, further developments in automatic adjustment are indicated, and a plea is made for improved oil and grease retention for hubs and axles to prevent contamination of brake linings. Brake testing is considered from first principles, and a routine for road testing is suggested. It is recommended that the investigation of temperature effects be confined to the laboratory...|$|R
