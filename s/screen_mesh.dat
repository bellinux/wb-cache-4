40|$|Cryogenic liquid {{acquisition}} devices (LADs) for space-based propulsion interface {{directly with}} the feed system, {{which can be a}} significant heat leak source. Further, the accumulation of thermal energy within LAD channels can lead to the loss of sub-cooled propellant conditions and result in feed system cavitation during propellant outflow. Therefore, the fundamental question addressed by this program was: "To what degree is natural convection in a cryogenic liquid constrained by the capillary <b>screen</b> <b>meshes</b> envisioned for LADs. ?"Testing was first conducted with water as the test fluid, followed by LN 2 tests. In either case, the basic experimental approach was to heat the bottom of a cylindrical column of test fluid to establish stratification patterns measured by temperature sensors located above and below a horizontal screen barrier position. Experimentation was performed without barriers, with screens, and with a solid barrier. The two <b>screen</b> <b>meshes</b> tested were those typically used by LAD designers, " 200 x 1400 " and " 325 x 2300 ", both with Twill Dutch Weave. Upon consideration of both the water and LN 2 data it was concluded that heat transfer across the <b>screen</b> <b>meshes</b> was dependent upon barrier thermal conductivity and that the capillary <b>screen</b> <b>meshes</b> were impervious to natural convection currents...|$|R

40|$|As in {{the first}} report, {{the effect of a}} <b>mesh</b> <b>screen</b> on {{impinging}} heat transfer has been experimentally studied in relation to the flow characteristics of an axisymmetric jet. The <b>mesh</b> <b>screen</b> was installed in the nozzle, 10 mm upstream from its exit. Five types of <b>mesh</b> <b>screen</b> with relatively large mesh size were used. The jet Reynolds number based on the nozzle diameter and the nozzle exit velocity was kept constant at Re= 17800. It is shown that the effects of the <b>mesh</b> <b>screen</b> on the flow characteristics of a free jet, and the heat transfer characteristics of an impinging jet, are appreciable. When the diameter of mesh wire is large, the velocity potential core of the jet is shorter than that without the <b>mesh</b> <b>screen,</b> and the local heat transfer coefficients augment {{in the case of the}} short nozzle-to-plate distance. This technique of heat transfer augmentation using a <b>mesh</b> <b>screen</b> with large <b>mesh</b> size is a very attractive method for industrial applications because the heat transfer coefficients over extensive impinging regions are increased and made uniform by the installation of the 4 <b>mesh</b> <b>screen...</b>|$|R

The initial study has been limited to 2 -D analysis of flow over wires in one wire, four wires and nine wires in an inline arrangement. The angle of minimum Nusselt number has been plotted against Reynolds number for same geometry to find a correlation for low Re (0. 015 - 15) and to better understand the flow over wires, Nusselt number has also been plotted w. r. t. circumferential angle.

Often window fly <b>screen</b> <b>mesh</b> is used, or horticultural shade cloth. The mesh itself can hold very little heat and warms up rapidly in light. The heat is absorbed by air passing around and through the mesh, and so the mesh is suspended with an air gap on both the front and back sides.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Numerical {{analysis}} and experimental study are performed {{to investigate the}} effect of heat load and operating temperature on the thermal performance of several variable conductance heat pipe heat pipe (VCHP) with <b>screen</b> <b>meshed</b> wick. The heat pipe is designed in 200 <b>screen</b> <b>meshes,</b> 500 ㎜ length and 12. 7 ㎜ outer diameter tube of copper, water (4. 8 g) is used as working fluid and nitrogen as non-condensable gas. Heat pipe {{used in this study}} has evaporator, condenser and adiabatic section, respectively. Analysis values and experimental data of wall temperature distribution along axial length are presented for heat transport capacity, condenser cooling water temperature change, degrees of an inclination angle and operating temperature. These {{analysis and}} experiment give the follow findings: For the same charging mass of working fluid, the operating temperature of heat pipe becomes to be high with the increasing of charging mass of NCG. When the heat flux at the evaporator section increases, the vapor pressure in the pipe rises and consequently compresses the NCG to the condenser end part and increases the active length of the condenser. It is found out that the operating temperature can be effectively controlled and the analytical results are in good agreement with those of experiment.

40|$|WSU Vancouver Honors Thesis. Types and {{quantities}} of material evidence collected from archaeological sites are primary {{sources of information}} for archaeologists to base interpretations and provide evidence to answer posed research questions. Artifact collection rates depend on the collection and screening methods used. Screening methods that use smaller <b>mesh</b> <b>screens</b> tend to result in greater {{quantities of}} artifacts collected and greater quantities create increased opportunities for rare or underrepresented artifacts to be collected. This study used domestic materials, beads, ceramics and glass, collected during excavations in the Village area of the Fort Vancouver National Historic Site during the 2013 Public Archaeology Field School. The benefits of wet screening using 1 mm <b>mesh</b> <b>screens</b> were examined in comparison with dry screening assemblages collected using a nested ¼ in. <b>mesh</b> <b>screen</b> inside of a 1 / 8 in. <b>mesh</b> <b>screen.</b> Measures for artifact density supported the hypothesis that wet screening did produce greater densities of the domestic materials examined. However, multiple diversity indices {{did not support the}} hypothesis that wet screening samples would be more diverse than samples collected using dry screening. Overall, the evidence supports the use of small <b>mesh</b> <b>screening</b> methods when applicable to the proposed research question...|$|R

50|$|Screen Mesh- Just like thread is woven {{together}} to create cloth, metal wire can be woven to create a metal cloth. <b>Screen</b> <b>Mesh</b> has evolved over many years of competitive screen manufacturing resulting in very thin yet strong cloth designed to maximize screen life and conductance {{as well as to}} provide a consistent cut point. To increase the conductance of a mesh screen you have to minimize the amount of material in the way, this is done by either reducing the wire diameter or weaving the cloth to produce rectangular openings. Rectangular openings increase the screens conductance while minimizing the effect on its cut point where as square openings provide a more consistent cut point but offer a lower conductance.|$|E
50|$|Trommel screens {{are used}} by the {{municipal}} waste industry in the screening process to classify sizes of solid waste. Besides that, {{it can also be}} used to improve the recovery of fuel-derived solid waste. This is done by removing inorganic materials such as moisture and ash from the air-classified light fraction segregated from shredded solid waste, thereby increasing the quality of the product fuel. In addition, trommel screens are used for the treatment of wastewater. For this particular application, solids from the entering flow will settle onto the <b>screen</b> <b>mesh</b> and the drum will rotate once the liquid reaches a certain level. The clean area of the screen is submerged into the liquid while the trapped solids fall onto a conveyor which will be further processed before removal.|$|E

The site was excavated with a Total Mapping Station (TMS). The weather of the Gunnison basin restricted the fieldwork to June, July, and August. Standard excavation methods were employed using archeological tools on 1x1 meter squares. The soil was then carried to a 1/8-inch <b>screen</b> <b>mesh</b> and sifted. The seven-year excavation was conducted in a 428 square meter block that contains ninety features and yielded 24,621 artifacts. The first surface collection yielded 24,149 flake stone artifacts, the second surface collection yielded 4,420 flaked-stone artifacts, and the third collection yielded 5,215 artifacts.

50|$|Finds and {{artifacts}} that {{survive in the}} archaeological record are retrieved in the main by hand and observation as the context they survive in is excavated. Several other techniques are available depending on suitability and time constraints. Sieving and flotation is used to maximize the recovery of small items such as small shards of pottery or flint flakes. The use of sieving is more common on research based excavations where more time is available. Some success has been achieved {{with the use of}} cement mixers and bulk sieving. This method allows the quick removal of context by shovel and mattock yet allows for a high retrieval rate. Spoil is shovelled into cement mixers and water added to form a slurry which is then poured through a large <b>screen</b> <b>mesh.</b> Flotation is a process of retrieval that works by passing spoil onto the surface of water and separating finds that float from the spoil which sinks, this is especially suited to the recovery of environmental data such as seeds and small bones. Not all finds retrieval is done during excavation and some especially flotation may take place post-excavation from samples taken during excavation.|$|E

40|$|The PhD thesis {{with the}} title “Investigation of several {{critical}} issues in <b>screen</b> <b>mesh</b> heat pipe manufacturing and operation” presented hereafter describes work carried out in four main areas. Initially the relevant literature is reviewed and presented, followed by the presentation of theoretical work regarding <b>screen</b> <b>mesh</b> heat pipe fill calculations, heat pipe processing and {{an investigation into the}} capillary or lifting height for <b>screen</b> <b>mesh</b> heat pipes. Further, the possibility of tailoring <b>screen</b> <b>mesh</b> heat pipes towards certain applications was investigated and it was found that further work is required in this area to allow a conclusive judgement whether a coarser or finer wick at the wall provides a distinguish advantage over two wraps of a medium coarse type. Within this approach a calculation method for the determination of the optimum working fluid fill of a <b>screen</b> <b>mesh</b> heat pipe based on geometrical parameters of the wick was developed and successfully implemented for the production of the later tested samples. The investigation into the effects of bending on the heat pipe performance, both using single phase flow CFD as well as experimentation, was performed using five different geometrical cases, each with five samples. These were tested in order to minimise the effects of sample variation. The test cases investigated contained the deformation angles of 0 ° (straight), 45 °, 90 °, 135 ° and 180 °. During all test cases the orientation of the samples was kept constant at 0 ° to minimise additional influences like the effects of gravity on the reduction of available power handling capability. The test results show in deviation from CFD results that <b>screen</b> <b>mesh</b> heat pipe performance is significantly affected when bends are introduced and the reduction in power handling capability can be up to nearly 50 % of a straight heat pipe value. Finally this thesis advances into the field of water heat pipe freeze thaw and the possibility of <b>screen</b> <b>mesh</b> heat pipes with changed shapes to withstand multiple freeze thaw cycles. It was found that correctly engineered <b>screen</b> <b>mesh</b> copper water heat pipes can be used in applications where they are subjected to multiple freeze thaw cycles. The fluid charge for water heat pipes subjected to these conditions needs to be adjusted in such a way, that accumulation of working fluid in certain areas, regardless of orientation or process variation during filling, is avoided.
