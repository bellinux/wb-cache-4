5|$|The {{reactive}} {{oxygen species}} produced in cells include hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hypochlorous acid (HClO), and free radicals such as the hydroxyl radical (·OH) and the <b>superoxide</b> <b>anion</b> (O2−). The hydroxyl radical is particularly unstable and will react rapidly and non-specifically with most biological molecules. This species is produced from hydrogen peroxide in metal-catalyzed redox reactions such as the Fenton reaction. These oxidants can damage cells by starting chemical chain reactions such as lipid peroxidation, or by oxidizing DNA or proteins. Damage to DNA can cause mutations and possibly cancer, if not reversed by DNA repair mechanisms, while damage to proteins causes enzyme inhibition, denaturation and protein degradation.|$|E
5|$|The {{biochemical}} {{basis for}} the toxicity of oxygen is the partial reduction of oxygen by one or two electrons to form reactive oxygen species, which are natural by-products of the normal metabolism of oxygen and have important roles in cell signalling. One species produced by the body, the <b>superoxide</b> <b>anion</b> (−), is possibly involved in iron acquisition. Higher than normal concentrations of oxygen lead to increased levels of reactive oxygen species. Oxygen is necessary for cell metabolism, and the blood supplies it to {{all parts of the}} body. When oxygen is breathed at high partial pressures, a hyperoxic condition will rapidly spread, with the most vascularised tissues being most vulnerable. During times of environmental stress, levels of reactive oxygen species can increase dramatically, which can damage cell structures and produce oxidative stress.|$|E
5|$|Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are a {{class of}} closely related enzymes that {{catalyze}} {{the breakdown of the}} <b>superoxide</b> <b>anion</b> into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. SOD enzymes are present in almost all aerobic cells and in extracellular fluids. Superoxide dismutase enzymes contain metal ion cofactors that, depending on the isozyme, can be copper, zinc, manganese or iron. In humans, the copper/zinc SOD is present in the cytosol, while manganese SOD is present in the mitochondrion. There also exists a third form of SOD in extracellular fluids, which contains copper and zinc in its active sites. The mitochondrial isozyme seems to be the most biologically important of these three, since mice lacking this enzyme die soon after birth. In contrast, the mice lacking copper/zinc SOD (Sod1) are viable but have numerous pathologies and a reduced lifespan (see article on superoxide), while mice without the extracellular SOD have minimal defects (sensitive to hyperoxia). In plants, SOD isozymes are present in the cytosol and mitochondria, with an iron SOD found in chloroplasts that is absent from vertebrates and yeast.|$|E

Furthermore, part of antioxidants properties of NO is attributable to up-regulation of heme-oxygenase-I and ferritin expression, which reduce <b>superoxide</b> <b>anion</b> concentrations in blood vessels.|$|E
25|$|The {{reaction}} of superoxide with non-radicals is spin-forbidden. In biological systems, {{this means that}} its main reactions are with itself (dismutation) or with another biological radical such as nitric oxide (NO) or with a transition-series metal. The <b>superoxide</b> <b>anion</b> radical (O2−) spontaneously dismutes to O2 and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) quite rapidly (~105 M−1s−1 at pH 7). SOD is necessary because superoxide reacts with sensitive and critical cellular targets. For example, it reacts with the NO radical, and makes toxic peroxynitrite.|$|E
25|$|In the {{vascular}} endothelium, NO is synthesized by eNOS from L-arginine {{and molecular}} oxygen, which binds to the heme group of eNOS, is reduced and finally incorporated into L- arginine to form NO and L-citrulline. The binding of the cofactor BH4 {{is essential for}} eNOS to efficiently generate NO. In the absence of this cofactor, eNOS shifts from a dimeric to a monomeric form, thus becoming uncoupled. In this conformation, instead of synthesizing NO, eNOS produces <b>superoxide</b> <b>anion,</b> a highly reactive free radical with deleterious consequences to the cardiovascular system.|$|E

The hydroxyl-radical formation enhanced by SOD was inhibited by catalase and desferrioxamine, and stimulated by EDTA and diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid, suggesting that both hydrogen peroxide and iron ions participate in the reaction. The hydroxyl-radical formation enhanced by SOD may be considered to proceed via the following steps. First, 3 -hydroxyanthranilic acid is spontaneously auto-oxidized {{in a process that}} requires molecular oxygen and yields <b>superoxide</b> <b>anions</b> and anthranilyl radicals. This reaction seems to be reversible. Secondly, the <b>superoxide</b> <b>anions</b> formed in the first step are dismuted by SOD to generate hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen, and hence the equilibrium in the first step is displaced in favour of the formation of <b>superoxide</b> <b>anions.</b> Thirdly, hydroxyl radicals are generated from hydrogen peroxide through the Fenton reaction. In this Fenton reaction Fe 2 + ions are available since Fe 3 + ions are readily reduced by 3 -hydroxyanthranilic acid.

In this process, the <b>superoxide</b> <b>anion</b> is produced as a by-product of several steps in the electron transport chain.

In plants, algae, [...] and cyanobacteria, reactive oxygen species are also produced during photosynthesis, particularly under conditions of high light intensity. This effect is partly offset by the involvement of carotenoids in photoinhibition, and in algae and cyanobacteria, by large amount of iodide and selenium, which involves these antioxidants reacting with over-reduced forms of the photosynthetic reaction centres to prevent the production of reactive oxygen species.|$|E

As the production of reactive oxygen species by these proton-pumping complexes is greatest at high membrane potentials, it has been proposed that mitochondria regulate their activity to maintain the membrane potential within a narrow range that balances ATP production against oxidant generation. For instance, oxidants can activate uncoupling proteins that reduce membrane potential.|$|E
2500|$|In sea water, ROS can be {{generated}} through abiotic as well as biotic processes, among which are the radiolysis and photolysis of water molecules and cellular respiration. [...] According to a model proposed by Fan for the prediction of ROS in surface waters, the biochemistry mediated by phytoplankton {{may be just as}} important for the production of ROS as photochemistry. Biological ROS is often synthesized in mitochondrial membranes, as well as the endoplasmic reticulum of animals, plants, and some bacteria. In addition, chloroplasts and the organelles peroxisomes and glyoxysomes are also sites for the generation of ROS. [...] The ROS most likely released to the environment are those produced at the cell surface as electrons get [...] "leaked" [...] from the respiratory chain and react with molecular oxygen, O2. [...] The products of this subsequent reduction of molecular oxygen are what are referred to as reactive oxygen species. [...] Thus, the production of ROS is in direct proportion to the concentration of O2 in the system, with increases of O2 leading to higher production of ROS. There are three main reactive oxygen species: the <b>superoxide</b> <b>anion</b> (O2−), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the hydroxyl radical (OH•). [...] The <b>superoxide</b> <b>anion</b> is formed directly from the one-electron reduction of molecular oxygen.

[...] Next, the reduction of hydrogen peroxide yields the hydroxyl radical, H2O2↔2OH•, which can then get reduced to the hydroxyl ion and water. [...] However, the presence of reactive oxygen species in marine systems is hard to detect and measure accurately, for a number of reasons. [...] First, ROS concentrations are generally low (nanomoles) in seawater. [...] Second, they may react with other hard to identify molecules that occur in low quantities, resulting in unknown products. [...] Finally, they are (for the most part) transient intermediates, having lifetimes as little as microseconds.|$|E

The relationships between growth signaling, oxidative stress and aging remain unclear. Here we report that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, alterations in growth signaling pathways impact levels of <b>superoxide</b> <b>anions</b> that promote chronological aging and inhibit growth arrest of stationary phase cells in G 0 /G 1. Factors that decrease intracellular <b>superoxide</b> <b>anions</b> in parallel with enhanced longevity and more efficient G 0 /G 1 arrest include genetic inactivation of growth signaling pathways that inhibit Rim 15 p, which activates oxidative stress responses, and downregulation of these pathways by caloric restriction. Caloric restriction also reduces <b>superoxide</b> <b>anions</b> independently of Rim 15 p by elevating levels of H 2 O 2, which activates superoxide dismutases. In contrast, high glucose or mutations that activate growth signaling accelerate chronological aging in parallel with increased <b>superoxide</b> <b>anions</b> and reduced efficiency of stationary phase G 0 /G 1 arrest. High glucose also activates DNA damage responses and preferentially kills stationary phase cells that fail to arrest growth in G 0 /G 1. These findings suggest that growth signaling promotes chronological aging in budding yeast by elevating <b>superoxide</b> <b>anions</b> that inhibit quiescence and induce DNA replication stress.

Mitochondria convert energy for the cell into a usable form, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The process in which ATP is produced, called oxidative phosphorylation, involves the transport of protons (hydrogen ions) across the inner mitochondrial membrane {{by means of the}} electron transport chain. In the electron transport chain, electrons are passed through a series of proteins via oxidation-reduction reactions, with each acceptor protein along the chain having a greater reduction potential than the previous. The last destination for an electron along this chain is an oxygen molecule. In normal conditions, the oxygen is reduced to produce water; however, in about 0.1–2% of electrons passing through the chain (this number derives from studies in isolated mitochondria, though the exact rate in live organisms is yet to be fully agreed upon), oxygen is instead prematurely and incompletely reduced to give the superoxide radical (•), most well documented for Complex I and Complex III. Superoxide is not particularly reactive by itself, but can inactivate specific enzymes or initiate lipid peroxidation in its protonated form, hydroperoxyl HO. The pKa of hydroperoxyl is 4.8.

The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the effect of IMD in the PVN on CSAR and its related mechanisms in CHF rats. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Rats were subjected to left descending coronary artery ligation to induce CHF or sham-operation (Sham). Renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded. CSAR was evaluated by the RSNA and MAP responses to epicardial application of capsaicin. Acute experiments were carried out 8 weeks after coronary ligation or sham surgery under anesthesia. IMD and angiotensin II (Ang II) levels in the PVN were up-regulated in CHF rats. Bilateral PVN microinjection of IMD caused greater decreases in CSAR and the baseline RSNA and MAP in CHF rats than those in Sham rats. The decrease of CSAR caused by IMD was prevented by pretreatment with AM receptor antagonist AM 22 - 52, but not CGRP receptor antagonist CGRP 8 - 37.
