Kimber shortly began producing a limited number of what would be later termed the Interim Close Quarters Battle pistol (ICQB). Maintaining the simple recoil assembly, 5-inch barrel (though using a stainless steel match grade barrel), and internal extractor, the ICQB is not much different from Browning's original design.|$|E

40|$|We are {{developing}} a new national time and frequency standard dissemination system by using information and communications technology (ICT). This is called TFDN (Time and Frequency Dissemination system via Network). The TFDN is a compact and all-in-one system which automatically compares time, calibrates a local oscillator, and <b>supplies</b> <b>time</b> and frequency. A local clock in the TFDN is calibrated by using GPS common-view / all-in-view to the national time and frequency standard. The TFDN also <b>supplies</b> <b>time</b> information into IP networks as a hardware time server. Slaves can be synchronized within tens of nano-second accuracy in the same network (LAN). The all functions, include a rubidium oscillator, are packed into a 1 U size case.

The last operating saw mill (Slater's Lumber Mill) continued to produce lumber well into the 1970s.

Today, only remote foundation ruins of the mills remain, although a lookout over the falls and a signboard detailing the history of the area is in place.|$|E

5000|$|By 1859, the Panic {{began to}} level off and the economy had begun to stabilize. President James Buchanan, after announcing that the paper-money system {{seemed to be the}} root cause of the Panic, decided to {{withdraw}} the usage of all bank notes under twenty dollars. He also [...] "advised the State banks to break away from the banks urged them to follow the example of the Federal Government." [...] He felt this would decrease the paper money supply, in order to allow the specie <b>supply</b> <b>time</b> to increase and reduce inflation rates. President Buchanan wanted the state banks to follow the federal government, specifically, the Independent Treasury system. This system allowed the federal government to keep up with specie payments, which helped alleviate some of the financial stress that the bank suspensions had brought on.|$|E
5000|$|One key {{indicator}} {{of the success of}} production scheduling based on demand, pushing, is the ability of the demand-forecast to create such a push. Kanban, by contrast, is part of an approach where the [...] "pull" [...] comes from demand. Re-supply or production is determined according to the actual demand of the customer. In contexts where <b>supply</b> <b>time</b> is lengthy and demand is difficult to forecast, often, the best one can do is to respond quickly to observed demand. This situation is exactly what a kanban system accomplishes, in that it is used as a demand signal that immediately travels through the supply chain. This ensures that intermediate stock held in the supply chain are better managed, and are usually smaller. Where the supply response is not quick enough to meet actual demand fluctuations, thereby causing potential lost sales, stock building may be deemed more appropriate, and is achieved by placing more kanban in the system.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{appearance}} of big international Production Companies and the expected {{changes in the}} legislation have already troubled the “key players ” of the Greek (para) pharmaceutical supply chain. The Greek Production Companies, mainly SMEs, should develop defensive strategies {{in order to avoid}} great losses. The paper proposes a model for the development of an electronic alliance network among the companies threatened by the advent of international big firms. This will happen through the improvement of key supply chain indicators such as the reduction of <b>supply</b> <b>time</b> and the increase of the potential market, as well as the establishment of collaborative strategies. The para-pharmaceutical supply chain is described and the risks – both negative and positive- that may affect the proposed e-alliance model are identified. Main expected benefits include: reduction of <b>supply</b> <b>time,</b> increase of the potential market and possibility of collaborative strategies. The Greek para-pharmaceutical industry was selected as, despite potential opportunities, no major penetration of e-business has been noticed in that sector...|$|E

These responses are higher for single people than for married people, perhaps reflecting a lack of market substitutes for the time of married people.

40|$|AbstractTemporal {{heterogeneities}} in tumor {{blood supply}} were studied {{by using a}} recently developed first-pass imaging technique. First-pass imaging movies of A- 07 -GFP human tumor xenografts growing in window chambers were recorded at a frame rate of ∼ 9 fps and a spatial resolution of 10. 8 x 10. 8 µm 2 after a bolus of 155 -kDa tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-labeled dextran had been administered intravenously. Each tumor was subjected to imaging thrice, with 20 minutes between each repetition. Highly specific maps of the vascular network and blood <b>supply</b> <b>time</b> (BST) images (i. e., images of the time from when arterial blood enters a tumor through the main supplying artery until it reaches a vessel segment within the tumor) were produced from the movies. The tumors had one to three supplying arterioles and showed substantial temporal heterogeneity in BST. Homogeneous changes in BST in the entire vascular network were seen in tumors supplied by one arteriole. Blood <b>supply</b> <b>time</b> fluctuations in tumor subregions were observed in tumors having two or three supplying arterioles. In addition, individual vessel segments frequently showed significant changes in BST with time. High-magnification transmission microscopy imaging substantiated that BST changes could be a consequence of arterial/arteriolar vasomotor activity, vessel wall compression, varying flow rate, and vascular stasis...|$|E

40|$|Distributed {{generation}} (DG), battery storage (BS) {{and electric}} vehicles (EVs) in a microgrid constitute the combined {{power generation system}} (CPGS). A CPGS {{can be applied to}} achieve a reliable evaluation of a distribution network with microgrids. To model charging load and discharging capacity, respectively, the EVs in a CPGS can be divided into regular EVs and ruleless EVs, according to their driving behavior. Based on statistical data of gasoline-fueled vehicles and the probability distribution of charging start instant and charging time, a statistical model can be built to describe the charging load and discharging capacity of ruleless EVs. The charge and discharge curves of regular EVs can also be drawn {{on the basis of a}} daily dispatch table. The CPGS takes the charge and discharge curves of EVs, daily load and DG power generation into consideration to calculate its power <b>supply</b> <b>time</b> during islanding. Combined with fault duration, the power <b>supply</b> <b>time</b> during islanding will be used to analyze and determine the interruption times and interruption duration of loads in islands.
