5|$|The pope is also Sovereign of Vatican City, a small {{city-state}} entirely enclaved {{within the}} city of Rome, which is an entity distinct from the Holy See. It is {{as head of the}} Holy <b>See,</b> <b>not</b> as head of Vatican City State, that the pope receives ambassadors of states and sends them his own diplomatic representatives. The Holy See also confers orders, decorations and medals, such as the orders of chivalry in the Middle Ages.|$|E

In fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal standard? I must therefore, if I reason consequentially, as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction, as that there is a God.|$|E

25|$|The case Ashcroft v. ACLU {{started on}} January 11, 1999. COPA opponents argued that self {{installed}} filters {{were much more}} effective at blocking obscene/indecent content, and would allow individuals to choose what content they wanted to <b>see,</b> <b>not</b> the government. Opponents also held that legal speech would be made criminal by COPA, and that adults would be prevented from seeing legal content {{if they did not}} have a credit card to get past security screens. It was also argued that in some cases fully complying with COPA would not have guaranteed freedom from prosecution (Stevens) and that the plan was flawed because some minors do have their own credit cards, and could thus go around the screens with ease.|$|E
500|$|The {{marriage}} of her favourite hurt the Queen deeply. She never accepted it, humiliating Leicester in public: [...] "my open and great disgraces delivered from her Majesty's mouth". Then again, {{she would be}} as fond of him as ever. In 1583 she informed ambassadors that Lettice Dudley was [...] "a she-wolf" [...] and her husband a [...] "traitor" [...] and [...] "a cuckold". Lady Leicester's social life was much curtailed. Even her movements could pose a political problem, as Francis Walsingham explained: [...] "I <b>see</b> <b>not</b> her Majesty disposed to use the services of my Lord of Leicester. There is great offence taken at the conveying down of his lady." [...] The Earl stood by his wife, asking his colleagues to intercede for her; there was no hope: [...] "She [...] doth take every occasion by my marriage to withdraw any good from me", Leicester wrote even {{after seven years of}} marriage.|$|E
500|$|Makriyannis {{concluded}} {{work on his}} Memoirs in {{the years}} before his imprisonment; the last entries seem to be from September or October 1850, as evinced by his references to the events of that period. In the text of the Memoirs, one can <b>see</b> <b>not</b> only the personal adventures and disappointments of his long public career, but, more significantly, his views on people, situations and events, phrased clearly and quite often passionately. They were first published in 1907 by Yannis Vlahogiannis, while some fragments of them had earlier been published in the newspaper Acropolis in 1904. Spyridon Lambros, in 1908, noted his straightforwardness and slight egotism, along with his holding firm to his own opinion (as quoted by Sphyroeras). Kostis Palamas, in 1911, called his work [...] "incomparable in its kind, a masterpiece of his illiterate, but strong and autonomous mind" [...] (ibid). It should be noted that Makriyannis had received only the most basic and fragmentary education, and, according to his own testimony, mastered writing shortly before he started writing his Memoirs, while he was stationed in Argos.|$|E

500|$|Originally, the Getty Museum {{started in}} J. Paul Getty's house located in Pacific Palisades in 1954. He {{expanded}} {{the house with}} a museum wing. In the 1970s, Getty built a replica of an Italian villa on his home's land to better house his collection, which opened in 1974. After Getty's death in 1976, the entire property was turned over to the Getty Trust for museum purposes. However, the collection outgrew the site, which has since been renamed the Getty Villa, and management sought a location more accessible to Los Angeles. The purchase of the land upon which the center is located, a campus of [...] on a [...] site in the Santa Monica Mountains above Interstate 405, surrounded by [...] kept in a natural state, was announced in 1983. [...] The top of the hill is [...] above sea level, high enough that on a clear day it is possible to <b>see</b> <b>not</b> only the Los Angeles skyline but also the San Bernardino Mountains, and San Gabriel Mountains to the east as well as the Pacific Ocean to the west.|$|E
500|$|While Wollstonecraft does {{call for}} {{equality}} {{between the sexes}} in particular areas of life, such as morality, she does not explicitly state {{that men and women}} are equal. What she does claim is that men and women are equal in the eyes of God. However, such claims of equality stand in contrast to her statements respecting the superiority of masculine strength and valour. Wollstonecraft famously and ambiguously writes: [...] "Let it not be concluded that I wish to invert the order of things; I have already granted, that, from the constitution of their bodies, men seem to be designed by Providence to attain a greater degree of virtue. I speak collectively of the whole sex; but I <b>see</b> <b>not</b> the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature. In fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal standard? I must therefore, if I reason consequently, as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction, as that there is a God." [...] Her ambiguous statements regarding the equality of the sexes have since made it difficult to classify Wollstonecraft as a modern feminist, particularly since the word and the concept were unavailable to her.|$|E
500|$|Stowe recounts several sailing trips {{she takes}} on the St. Johns and Julington Creek and the animals she sees during her excursion, appreciating the alligators, [...] "water-turkeys" [...] (Anhinga anhinga), and [...] "fish-hawks", or ospreys (Pandion haliaetus). Long an animal lover, she took her dogs, cats, and birds with her {{as part of the}} [...] "earthquake" [...] of the annual {{relocation}} from Hartford to Mandarin. She extended this care to other animals as well. In Naples, Italy, she once got out of a carriage to walk as it was being pulled up a steep hill by two beleaguered horses that were being whipped by the driver, and asked her companions and guide to do the same. Not only did she write the first travel guide to Florida, but Stowe also became the first defender of wild animals. She pays particular attention in Palmetto Leaves to hunters who shoot at anything they <b>see.</b> <b>Not</b> taking offense at hunting for the sake of eating, Stowe laments killing for its own sake: [...] "it must be something that enjoys and can suffer; something that loves life, and must lose it". In 1877 she followed her book with a pamphlet that urged the cessation of the slaughter of Florida's wading birds, whose feathers were selling at the price of gold and used in women's hats.|$|E

500|$|To reinvigorate the European Champion Clubs' Cup, the {{competition}} was expanded and rebranded as the UEFA Champions League in 1992. From the 1997–98 season, it was further expanded to include eight domestic league runners-up selected by a UEFA coefficient and preliminary spots the following season were awarded to the third placed team; in some leagues fourth from 2002–03. The expansion and constant growth of {{the competition}} led to {{the decline of the}} Cup Winners' Cup, abolished in 1999 and by which point instigated proposals for a European Super League. Arsène Wenger has, on numerous occasions predicted the latter, arguing the pressure of television companies will force it to happen: [...] "It's all about money. More games equal more money through TV revenue and I think the next few years will <b>see</b> <b>not</b> just two, but three or four teams from the top countries competing against each other. It's what television wants – big teams in big matches. That is why the Champions' League was introduced." [...] Although Arsenal qualified for a fifteenth successive season of Champions League football in May 2012, this coincided with the club not winning a domestic honour since 2005, which led to open criticism over the competition's present format. Wenger however has gone on to defend the club policy, stating a trophy for Arsenal is winning the Premier League or the Champions League; [...] "Would you like to finish tenth in the league but win the League Cup and say you have won a trophy? Certainly not." ...|$|E
500|$|Barrymore and {{his wife}} both {{appeared}} in supporting roles in the 1939 screwball comedy Midnight, her only film role. The New York Times thought the film was [...] "one of the liveliest, gayest, wittiest and naughtiest comedies of a long hard season" [...] and that Barrymore, [...] "the [...] Gehrig of eye-brow batting, rolls his phrases with his usual richly humorous effect". The film {{was inducted into the}} National Film Registry in 2013. Barrymore {{and his wife}} appeared together in the stage farce My Dear Children, which opened in March 1939 at Princeton University's McCarter Theatre. He played the lead role, Allan Manville, an ageing hammy Shakespearean has-been. Because of his failing memory, Barrymore ad-libbed constantly throughout the show. In some points the new additions were an improvement, but he also greeted friends in the audience, and used profanities freely. Nevertheless, the show was a success. Life magazine wrote that [...] "People flock to <b>see</b> , <b>not</b> for polished performance, but because he converts the theater into a rowdy histrionic madhouse. Sometimes he arrives late. Sometimes he is tight. Usually he forgets his lines. But he always puts on a great show." [...] When the show reached Broadway, Life wrote that [...] "Barrymore's return to Times Square was a huge professional triumph". Brooks Atkinson, writing for The New York Times thought that Barrymore was [...] "still the most gifted actor in this country.... Although he has recklessly played the fool for a number of years, he is nobody's fool in My Dear Children but a superbly gifted actor on a tired holiday." [...] Barrymore and his wife continued to argue during the play's run, and she left the play part way through the tour. They attempted a reconciliation when the production reached New York, but the couple divorced in late 1940.|$|E

2500|$|Despite this, {{the details}} of our values and ethics are not inherited: they are partly {{determined}} by our culture, and partly chosen by ourselves.
