5000|$|Folding stands {{range from}} inexpensive, {{lightweight}} models made of metal, which {{are designed to}} hold a few pages of sheet music or a thin songbook, to stronger, more expensive heavy-duty models. Metal folding stands often have solid wire extensions or metal [...] "arms" [...] which can be folded out to support more than two pages of music or over-size sheets or pages. This is the kind most often used by music students in youth orchestras. Lightweight folding stands are designed to collapsible; if folding stands did not collapse, they would be awkward and unwieldy to carry. The collapsible nature of folding stands makes them small enough to slip into many instrument cases or backpacks. This feature makes folding stands more portable. As such, they are a popular <b>stand</b> <b>type</b> for rehearsals, auditions and even some types of performances. Amateur orchestras and some youth orchestras may ask members to bring folding stands to rehearsals, and sometimes also to performances, as this saves the ensemble the cost of buying or renting, and transporting one or more racks of non-folding stands.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTWe {{investigated}} the richness, density, {{and composition of}} woody-tree species, and which traits of colonizing species are selected in commercial stands of Pinus elliottii and Araucaria angustifolia in southern Brazil. Analyses of variance with permutation tests were performed to assess differences among <b>stand</b> <b>types</b> in relation to density and rarefied richness. Multivariate analyses of variance with permutation tests were performed to compare <b>stand</b> <b>types</b> in relation to species composition and reproductive traits. Native forests presented higher stem density {{when compared to the}} plantations, while species richness did not vary among <b>stand</b> <b>types.</b> Species composition differed between the native forest and the plantations. Species' reproductive traits differed between the two types of plantations. The higher frequency of zoochorous diaspores in P. elliottii plantations when compared to the other <b>stand</b> <b>types</b> suggests the importance of the fauna in creating and sustaining the understory structure in this type of plantation. Plantations show a high potential as colonization sites by native woody species, despite their structural differences in relation to native forests. If properly managed, plantations might be catalysts for the recovery of degraded areas. © 2014 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação. Published by Elsevier Editora Ltda...|$|R

In time, this trend {{could lead to}} a homogenisation of the forest mosaic with consequences on structural indices recognised as beneficial to forest biodiversity. & Aims This study was conducted to investigate the potential effects of a generalisation of the selection silvicultural system on structural diversity in the forest landscape with conse-quences for forest biodiversity conservation. & Methods We compared four structural indices (tree species richness, diameter heterogeneity, deadwood volume and basal area of mature trees) in five different <b>stand</b> <b>types</b> typical of the northern French Alps, using forest plot data in the Vercors mountain range. Through virtual landscape simulations, we then calculated predicted mean proportions of <b>stand</b> <b>types</b> under two different conservation strategies: (i) maximising mean index values at the landscape level and (ii) maximising the number of plots in the landscape with index values above given thresholds. & Results Multi-staged forests did not maximise all indices, the best solution being to combine the five <b>stand</b> <b>types</b> in uneven proportions to improve biodiversity conservation. & Conclusion The expansion of selection silviculture in Euro-pean heterogeneous forest landscapes could enhance biodi-versity conservation if other <b>stand</b> <b>types</b> with complementary structural characteristics are maintained...|$|R

In territory Habrůvka, forest district Borky, were created gaps in following forest stand types: beech (BK), mixed (MIX) and spruce (SM). Measurement {{took place on}} area of size 0, 04 ha called small (S) and large (B) with size 0, 1 ha. With concentration on locations: centre (C), mature stand (P), border east (T/E) and border west (T/W). It was measured moisture in all big gap locations (B). Continuous measurement was under way during all the year. From the obtained data was evaluated soil moisture and then compared with soil hydrolimits: wilting point (BV), point of decreased availability (BSD), point of decreased availability of water (LB) and capillary maximum capacity (MKK). Altogether, {{it was found that}} location centre (C) contains the highest soil moisture value. This thesis is focused on evaluation of NO 3 -, NH 4 +, C/N, Cox and mineral nitrogen. It was found out that spruce forest <b>stand</b> <b>type</b> (SM) has the highest concentration of NO 3 -, NH 4 +, C/N, Cox and mineral nitrogen. On the contrast, it has the lowest C/N ratio. Forest <b>stand</b> <b>type</b> beech (BK) had the lowest NO 3 - value, C/N ratio and Cox. When evaluating of location, it was found that mixed forest type (MIX) and beech forest type (BK) are observed values higher on location centre (C). Spruce forest <b>stand</b> <b>type</b> (SM) had no as accurate values as those previous ones. In comparison between the big gap (B) and the small gap (S), there was found lower C/N ratio in the small gaps (S). Cox values were balanced. Mineral nitrogen showed higher values in beech big forest <b>stand</b> <b>type</b> (BK/B) and mixed big forest <b>stand</b> <b>type</b> (MIX/B). On the contrary, spruce forest <b>stand</b> <b>type</b> (SM) had higher values in the small gaps.

40|$|A simple {{classification}} of the stand characteristics from where open-pollinated seed of Eucalyptus globulus Labill. ssp. globulus has been collected was incorporated in a genetic evaluation model {{in an attempt}} to account for the different levels of inbreeding in native stands. Parent trees were grouped into four classes of local <b>stand</b> <b>type,</b> ranging from isolated trees to dense stands. The inclusion of <b>stand</b> <b>type</b> in the model improved significantly the fit and caused a reduction of 4 to 13 % in the heritability. Growth was clearly depressed in progeny from isolated trees or remnant stands. Levels of abnormalities in the seedlings varied slightly amongst stand types (p= 0. 11) but the trend was less obvious. Results suggest that <b>stand</b> <b>type</b> classification accounted for some of the selfing and neighbourhood inbreeding in open-pollinated families. Correlations between breeding values estimated with and without <b>stand</b> <b>type</b> in the model were usually above 0. 95 so selection efficiency is likely to be little affected.

30|$|Even {{though the}} JPW {{was capable of}} burning three years {{following}} the initial fire, the mitigating effect of the first fire was evident in burn severity patterns of the subsequent 2009 fire. Burn severity direction changes were found to differ by <b>stand</b> <b>type.</b> In the longleaf and slash pine stand types, the low and moderate severity results may reflect the rapidly growing fine fuel loads typical of these forests (Myers and Ewel 1990). In the sweet bay <b>stand</b> <b>type,</b> the low burn severity values and relatively low percent burned {{may be attributed to}} the hydric and mesic characteristics of the <b>stand</b> <b>type,</b> inhibiting ignition under all but the driest of conditions (Myers and Ewel 1990). In the sapling sand pine <b>stand</b> <b>type,</b> it was surprising that sufficient fuels existed following the 2006 fire to reburn over half of the sapling sand pine area in 2009, because the fuel loads were likely significantly reduced following extensive moderate and high severity fire in 2006. It is likely that the high proportion of high severity fire in 2006 led to the much lower severity values observed in 2009. In the mature sand pine <b>stand</b> <b>type,</b> the results followed a similar trend with fewer hectares burned in 2009, likely due to reduced fuels after greater than 80 % of the <b>stand</b> <b>type</b> burned in 2006. Because the severity of the 2006 burn was mostly moderate, sufficient fuels may have remained {{for the majority of the}} <b>stand</b> <b>type</b> to burn again in 2009 at low to moderate severity. The high and moderate severity fire effects observed in the damaged sand pine stands in 2006 are likely due to their high fuel loading following the 2004 hurricane season. Only a fraction of the damaged sand pine type burned again in 2009, with over half of the burned area classified as low severity. This suggests that high severity fire in 2006 reduced the likelihood of high severity fire again in 2009. Across all stand types, burn severity decreased in 2009, suggesting that the 2006 fire mitigated fire severity in 2009. These results may support efforts to introduce prescribed fire into unburned sand pine scrub by documenting that high severity fires under prescribed conditions may reduce the likelihood of subsequent high severity fires under future wildfire scenarios. However, the longevity of the effect of one fire on the next is closely tied to the time between fires. There likely exists a threshold beyond which the initial fire has little effect on subsequent fires, and this can be determined for future overlapping fires using the methods developed here across a range of times between fires.|$|E

40|$|Since the 1980 s, hemlock-dominated forests (Tsuga canadensis) {{of central}} New England have been {{increasingly}} infested by the invasive pest hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA, Adelges tsugae), predominantly resulting in its replacement by black birch-dominated forests (Betula lenta). To date {{there has been}} no long-term empirical analysis of HWA effects on forest carbon (C) cycling due to forest transition from hemlock to black birch. To address this question, I measured the C pools in five <b>stand</b> <b>types</b> at varying ages and stages of HWA infestation in Massachusetts and Connecticut. I also measured C fluxes in aboveground net primary production (ANPP) and soil respiration, and studied the drivers of these fluxes viz. litter production, rates of foliar decomposition, soil exoenzyme activity, temperature sensitivity of soil respiration and nitrogen (N) cycling. The mass of C stored in recovering forests was resilient to HWA infestation but the location of these stocks varied among <b>stand</b> <b>types.</b> There was a transition of C from live biomass in healthy, unaffected secondary hemlock forests to coarse woody debris (CWD) in recently girdled forests intended to simulate the effect of HWA on hemlock loss. Twenty years post-HWA infestation, however, ANPP was very high and there was a large increase in biomass-C pools in aggrading black <b>stand</b> <b>types.</b> C pools in mature, secondary black birch <b>stand</b> <b>types</b> ~ 135 years since pastureland abandonment were as large as those in primary hemlock <b>stand</b> <b>types</b> ~ 235 years of age, suggesting recovery of C storage within one century of HWA infestation. Soil respiration rates were positively correlated with inputs of hardwood leaf litter, fine root biomass and exoenzyme activity. Stand-type variations in ANPP were positively correlated with annual N requirements and N uptake from the soil. Nitrogen-use efficiency was highest in the girdled and post-HWA infestation <b>stand</b> <b>types</b> where ANPP was dominated by wood production which has a wide C:N ratio. Similar trends were found in soil respiration, but not to the same degree as that of ANPP. Collectively, my results indicate that southern New England forests C storage is highly resilient to the HWA-induced losses of hemlock, suggesting that these ecosystems will continue to be sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide...|$|R

The combination of environmental variables defined at broad and local scales is necessary to provide regeneration distribution models with a small resolution (tree scale) that are valid on a large spatial scale (regional scale). Our aim was to quantify how gap partitioning among tree species at the seedling stage varies across large soil and <b>stand</b> <b>type</b> gradients. Regeneration inventories performed 5 years after gap creation were used to analyse the combined effects of soil type, <b>stand</b> <b>type,</b> and position within canopy gaps on the regeneration development of eight western European broadleaved species: Acer campestre, Acer pseudoplatanus, Betulapendula, Carpinusbetulus, Fagussylvatica, Fraxinusexcelsior, Quercus sp., and Salixcaprea. A clear pattern of gap partitioning among the eight species was observed. All species had higher density at the gap edge except birch and willow showing the highest presence in gap centres. For all species, the probability of presence of tall seedlings (height > 0. 5 m) increased from gap edge to gap centre. Small seedlings presented the opposite trend except birch and willow. Soil pH influenced probability of presence for each species, but {{did not affect the}} pattern of gap partitioning among species. Both local (location within the gap) and regional (soil pH and <b>stand</b> <b>type)</b> scale factors affect recruitment distribution and are thus necessary to predict seedling distribution.

How does the relationship between seed bank and vegetation change? What are the implications for seed bank dynamics? Location: An ancient Quercus petraea - Carpinus betulus forest in conversion from coppice-with-standards to regular Quercus high forest near Montargis, France. Methods: Seed bank and vegetation were sampled in six replicated <b>stand</b> <b>types,</b> forming a chronosequence along the conversion pathway. The <b>stand</b> <b>types</b> represented mid-successional stages of stands in transition from coppice-with-standards (to high forest (16 plots) and early- and mid-successional high forest stands (32 plots). Results: Seed bank density and species richness decreased with time since last disturbance. Adjusting for seed density effects obscured species richness differences between <b>stand</b> <b>types,</b> but species of later seres were nested subsets of earlier seres, implying concomitant shifts in species richness and composition with time since disturbance. Later seres were characterized by species with low seed weight and high seed longevity. Seed banks of early seres were more similar to vegetation than to later seres. Conclusions: Abandonment of the coppice-with-standards regime altered the seed bank characteristics, {{as well as its}} relationship with vegetation. Longer management cycles under high forest yield impoverished seed banks.

It can be found at: [URL] stand structure to reduce fuel density is a high priority for forest managers; however, affects to Pacific marten (Martes caurina) movement and connectivity are unknown. We evaluated whether thinning forests to reduce fuels influenced movements of Pacific marten. We collected movement paths from 22 martens using global positioning system telemetry to evaluate habitat selection and describe movement patterns. We quantified motion variance, speed, and path sinuosity in 3 <b>stand</b> <b>types</b> that differed in structural complexity (i. e., complex [dense], simple [thinned], and open). We hypothesized marten movement would differ between <b>stand</b> <b>types</b> and predicted that 1) martens would select <b>stand</b> <b>types</b> with increased structural complexity (complex[*]>[*]simple[*]>[*]open); 2) movements would increase in complexity (sinuosity, motion variance) and decrease in speed when martens traveled through stands with increased structural complexity; 3) speeds would increase during summer, indicating increased movement during the breeding season; and 4) males would move more rapidly because of their larger home ranges. Martens traveled 0. 5 – 27. 2 [*]km/day and an average (SD) of 1. 4 (0. 4) km/hour. Martens selected home ranges with fewer openings compared to the study area overall. Within home ranges, martens strongly selected complex stands over simple stands and openings. Speed and movement complexity were most consistent over time and movements were more sinuous and slower in complex <b>stand</b> <b>types</b> compared with openings and simple stands. Movement was erratic and more linear in openings than in both complex and simple stands. In simple stands, movement patterns were intermediate between complex stands and openings. Females generally moved more slowly, sinuously, and less variably compared to males. Martens moved more quickly, less sinuously, and more variably during winter compared to summer. However, martens avoided stands with simplified structure, and the altered patterns of movement we observed in those stands suggested that such treatments may negatively affect the ability of martens to forage without increased risk of predation. Fuel treatments that simplify stand structure negatively affected marten movements and habitat connectivity. Given these risks, and because treating fuels is less justified in high elevation forests, the risks can be minimized by applying treatments below the elevations where martens typically occur...|$|R

In the study, stand parameters determined by forest cover type map and remote sensing methods were compared and contrasted to evaluate the potential use of the remote sensing methods. The result showed that development stage were estimated with Landsat 7 ETM image using supervised classification with a 0. 89 kappa statistic value and 92 % overall accuracy assessments. Among the features, development stages were the most successfully classified stand parameters in classification process. According to the spatial accuracy assessment results, development stages also had the highest accuracy of 72. 2 %. As can be seen in the results, spatial accuracy is lower than classification accuracy. <b>Stand</b> <b>type</b> had the lowest accuracy of 32. 8. In conclusion, it could be stated that development stages, crown closure and land cover could be determined at an acceptable level using Landsat 7 ETM image. However, Landsat 7 ETM image do not provide means to map and monitor minor vegetation communities and stand types at stand level due to low spatial resolution. High resolution satellite images could be used either alone or with field survey data...|$|E
30|$|For model {{performance}} comparisons, each stand ideotype combination (<b>stand</b> <b>type</b> × Dq × density) {{was grown}} in the I/C model for 25  years with 25 replicates. These tree lists were also projected using the Acadian variant of FVS (Weiskittel et al. 2013). Comparisons of model performances were based on visual assessments of stand-level trajectories. Bandwidths of 25 and 40 (the estimated optimal bandwidths) were used for selection of nearest neighbors in the imputation step.|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{diversity}} and species composition of fish assemblages associated with different stands of aquatic macrophytes. The samplings were made during two seasons of the hydrological cycle, the dry and flooding seasons, in two <b>types</b> of macrophyte <b>stands.</b> The first <b>type</b> was monospecific and was composed by floating grass Paspalum repens. The second type was composed by several free-floating species, and was classified as mixed stand. We collected 1, 340 fish belonging to 50 species. Characiformes was the dominant group in the two <b>stand</b> <b>types</b> and hydrological seasons. In the stands of P. repens, the species richness and diversity were {{higher than in the}} mixed stands, probably due to the greater structural complexity of P. repens...|$|R
40|$|A Delphi survey {{involving}} {{experts in}} forest preference research {{was carried out}} to derive scores for the recreational value of 240 forest <b>stand</b> <b>types</b> across Europe. The survey was organized around four regional panels: Great Britain, Nordic Region, Central Europe, and Iberia. In each region, 60 forest <b>stand</b> <b>types</b> were defined according to five forest management alternatives (FMAs) on a continuum of management intensity, four phases of development (establishment, young, medium, and adult), and three tree species types (conifer, broadleaved, and mixed stands of conifer and broadleaved). The resulting scores were examined using conjoint analysis to determine {{the relative importance of}} the three structural attributes (FMA, phase of development, and tree species type), and each level or component of the attributes. The findings quantify the extent to which forest visitors prefer a degree of management to unmanaged forest nature reserves across the four regions. Phase of development was shown to make the highest contribution to the recreational value of forests while the contribution of tree species type was shown to be relatively unimportant. While the results are indicative, they provide evidence to support long-term retention and low-impact silviculture in forests where recreation is a primary objective of management...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1997 Ten {{species of}} bats {{occur in the}} Oregon Coast Range and are {{hypothesized}} {{to be associated with}} late-successional forests. The development of characteristics of late-successional forests in young forest stands can be accelerated through silvicultural practices such as thinning I examined the effects of thinning on the use of forests by bats in the Oregon Coast Range. I used automated ultrasonic detectors to record bat calls in 50 - to 100 -year-old thinned and =thinned stands as well as in old-growth (2200 -year-old) stands in 11 sites in the Oregon Coast Range during the summers of 1994 and 1995. I compared bat activity levels among the 3 <b>stand</b> <b>types.</b> In addition, I classified bat calls into 1 of 5 species groups: Eptes/Las, Myev/vo, Myyu/ca, MythCory, and Mysp. I measured selected vegetation and environmental variables in conjunction with bat activity. I also compared bat activity on roads with activity in the stand interior at 1 site. Bat activity was higher in old growth than in young stands, and higher in thinned than in =thinned stands in 1995 and over both seasons combined. I did not detect a difference in bat activity among <b>stand</b> <b>types</b> in 1994, until I removed 1 site from the analysis. The Mysp and MythCory species groups exhibited differences among <b>stand</b> <b>types.</b> Bat activity along roads was higher than activity within stands. Tree density, tree diameter, tree height, shrub cover, and shrub height varied significantly between old-growth and young stands. Tree density, tree diameter, shrub cover, canopy cover, and crown height varied significantly between thinned and unthinned stands. Bat activity, overall or by species group, was significantly related to structural variables, including mean snag diameter, mean distance from the detector to snags, and percent shrub cover. My results suggest that bats are sensitive to stand structure and that silvicultural practices, such as thinning, which promote development of structural characteristics found in old-growth stands, would benefit bat populations. Further study is needed to clarify the habitat preferences of separate bat species and to specify habitat elements required by bat species...|$|R
