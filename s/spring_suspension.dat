5|$|It was {{originally}} {{developed from the}} prototype T2 tank built by Rock Island Arsenal, which had a Vickers-type leaf <b>spring</b> <b>suspension.</b> The suspension {{was replaced by the}} superior vertical volute system in the T2E1 series of 1935. This was put into production with minor modifications as the M2A1 in 1936, with ten produced. The main pre-war version was the M2A2, with 239 produced, becoming the main tank in the US Army infantry units in the pre-world-war-II period. The Spanish Civil War showed that tanks armed only with machine guns were ineffective. This led to the M2A4 with a 37mm gun as the main armament. A total of 375 were delivered, the last ten as late as April 1942.|$|E
25|$|The T20 used {{an early}} version of the {{horizontal}} volute <b>spring</b> <b>suspension</b> (HVSS), another improvement compared to the less robust vertical volute <b>spring</b> <b>suspension</b> (VVSS) of the early versions of the M4. Later prototypes of the M26 tested a torsion bar suspension, which would become the standard for future U.S. tank suspension systems.|$|E
25|$|The Model S has {{independent}} coil <b>spring</b> <b>suspension</b> on {{all four}} wheels front double wishbone, virtual steer axis control arm and rear independent multilink. As an extra-cost option, the car is available with self-leveling, height-adjustable air suspension. This is accomplished via adjustable Bilstein shock absorbers controlled by the driver. The car is meant to lower itself at highway speed and raise itself to traverse steep driveways and rough terrain, despite the low 6-inch ground clearance and rather long 116-inch wheelbase.|$|E

25|$|In late 1962 Alan Turner, AC's chief {{engineer}} completed a major design {{change of the}} car's front end to accommodate {{rack and pinion steering}} while still using transverse leaf <b>spring</b> <b>suspension.</b> The new car entered production in early 1963 and was designated Mark II. The steering rack was borrowed from the MGB while the new steering column came from the VW Beetle. About 528 Mark II Cobras were produced in the summer of 1965 (the last US-bound Mark II was produced in November 1964).|$|E
25|$|Not much {{information}} has been released {{as far as the}} chassis and body structure changes go, and Toyota hasn't announced what they plan on doing with the FJ-S Cruiser Concept in the future. So whether or not it goes into production in a later year or if it remains a concept car is uncertain. However, new releases from Toyota show that the TRD Bilstein shocks with remote reservoirs and TRD-tuned front <b>spring</b> <b>suspension</b> combination debuted on the FJ-S Cruiser Concept is the same one they used on the Trail Teams Ultimate Edition FJ Cruiser for 2014. Toyota also put the same newly designed TRD Midnight Black alloy wheels used on the FJ-S on the new TRD Pro Series 4Runner.|$|E
25|$|Sheffield 513 {{was built}} by Charles Roberts & Co. of Wakefield to a design by Sheffield Transport, {{as one of a}} batch of 35 double deck trams {{constructed}} between 1950-1952. Fitted with comfortable upholstered seating for 62 passengers, it ran on a 4-wheel Maley and Taunton hornless type 588 truck with rubber and leaf <b>spring</b> <b>suspension,</b> powered by two Metrovick 101 DR3 65hp motors with a pair of Crompton-West CT/TJ controllers (fitted in restoration). Braking systems feature air brakes acting on all wheels, with electric braking for emergency use. It only operated in Sheffield for eight years, as they abandoned their trams in 1960. It ran in the closing procession held on 8 October.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the end of}} World War I, Germany was {{restricted}} in military development by the Treaty of Versailles, however a secret program under the name cover [...] "Traktor" [...] was developing armoured military vehicles and artillery. Its engine was mounted inside the front portion of the hull and the turret was mounted above the fighting compartment {{in the rear of}} the tank. Both Rheinmetall and Krupp produced prototypes, and in 1928, Rheinmetall was awarded the order of 289 tanks. However, some time later, the order was cancelled. [...] Krupp models had coil <b>spring</b> <b>suspensions,</b> while Rheinmetall had leaf <b>spring</b> <b>suspensions.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{tanks of}} World War I had fixed suspension with no designed movement whatsoever. This unsatisfactory situation was improved with leaf spring or coil <b>spring</b> <b>suspensions</b> adopted from agricultural, automotive or railway machinery, but even these had very limited travel.|$|R
5000|$|The T-18 light tank (also called MS-1, малый сопровождения, первый, [...] "First Small for Support") was {{the first}} Soviet-designed tank. Produced from 1928 to 1931, {{it was based on}} the Renault FT, with the {{addition}} of a vertically <b>sprung</b> <b>suspension.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{prototype}} for this series, number 501, was built at Queens Road works in August 1946. With comfortable upholstered seating for 62 passengers, {{it was the}} last car to be built at the works. From 1950 to 1952 35 more, numbered 502536, were constructed by Charles Roberts & Co. of Horbury near Wakefield. They were carried on a four-wheel Maley and Taunton hornless type 588 truck with rubber and leaf <b>spring</b> <b>suspension,</b> powered by two Metrovick 101 DR3 65hp motors. Air brakes were fitted, acting on all wheels, and electric braking was available for emergency use. Car 536, which entered service on 11 April 1952, was the last tram to be constructed for Sheffield. Representing the ultimate development of the traditional British four-wheel tram, the class worked for only 10years, as Sheffield tramway closed in 1960. On 8 October of that year, car 513, ran specially decorated in the final procession; so too did sister tram 510, now preserved by the National Tramway Museum at Crich.|$|E
25|$|This period saw Land Rover {{market the}} utility Land Rover {{as a private}} {{recreational}} vehicle. While the basic pick-up, 4x4 and van versions were still working vehicles, the County 4x4s were sold as multi-purpose family vehicles, featuring improved interior trim and more comfortable seats. This change was reflected in Land Rover starting what had long been common practice in the car industry— detail changes and improvements to the County model {{from year to year}} in order to attract new buyers and to encourage existing owners to trade in for a new vehicle. These changes included different exterior styling graphics and colour options, and the introduction of new options, such as radio-cassette players, Rostyle wheels, headlamp wash and wipe systems, as well as accessories such as surfboard carriers and bike racks. The switch from leaf spring to coil <b>spring</b> <b>suspension</b> was {{a key part of the}} new model's success. It offered improved off-road ability, load capacity, handling, and ride comfort.|$|E
500|$|The {{specifications}} of the M16 {{were similar}} to those of the M3 Half-track. It was 21ft 4in (6.5m) long (with a wheelbase of [...] ), 7ft 1in (2.16m) wide, and 7ft 8in (2.34m) high and weighed 9.9short tons (9t). It had suspension consisting of vertical volute <b>spring</b> <b>suspension</b> for the tracks and leaf springs for the wheels.|$|E
50|$|All models had leaf <b>sprung</b> <b>suspension.</b> The SD33 {{vehicles}} feature 24-volt electronics. Different trim {{options and}} colors were available, with options including vinyl or carpet floors and blue or brown interior trim. Air conditioning and power steering were available on deluxe models.|$|R

500|$|Other {{improvements}} {{include the}} change to a manual [...] transmission with six forward speeds (instead of the previous four), and increased stability resulting from wider track axles than its predecessor. Leaf springs were replaced with modern coil <b>spring</b> <b>suspension</b> front and rear, and the Storm II features rear Dana 44 axles and front TJ Dana 30s, factory designed slip yoke eliminators, and the added safety of standard airbags.

500|$|The M32 Armored Recovery Vehicle was {{an armored}} {{recovery}} vehicle (ARV) used during World War II and the Korean War [...] by the United States, and {{was based on}} the chassis of the M4 Sherman. During World War II, the British also used several hundred M32s, which were obtained through Lend-Lease in 1944. The first four prototypes were produced in January 1943, labeled T5, T5E1, T5E2, T5E3, and T5E4. After a series of tests at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds, the prototypes were approved as M32, M32E1, M32E2, M32E3, and M32E4. However, the M32E4 never entered production. There were also variants that had Horizontal Volute <b>Spring</b> <b>Suspension</b> (HVSS), which were demarcated by an A1 after the model.|$|E

5000|$|The Soviet Red Army {{captured}} 14 burnt-out Renaults from White Russian {{forces and}} rebuilt {{them at the}} Krasnoye Sormovo Factory in 1920. Nearly 15 exact copies, called [...] "Russki Renoe", were produced in 1920-1922, but they never used in battle because of many technical problems. In 1928-1931, the first completely Soviet-designed tank was the T-18, a derivative of the Renault with <b>sprung</b> <b>suspension.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In later Sport and GSi models (from 1995 onwards) Lotus <b>Sprung</b> <b>Suspension</b> {{was used}} to give better ride.

500|$|The Defense Act of 1920 had defined {{tanks to}} be used in support of the infantry. Through the 1920s a number of theorists {{outlined}} an independent role for the tank that required it to move at high speed into the rear areas, a modern version of the cavalry. The British referred to these designs as cruiser tanks, but similar high-speed designs were developed under a variety of names. As the Defense Act limited tank development to the infantry, the United States Cavalry began tank development under the name [...] "combat car". In keeping with the high-speed role, the new T5 Combat Car introduced the new vertical volute <b>spring</b> <b>suspension</b> (VVSS) system, which proved clearly superior to the Vickers leaf spring system.|$|E

50|$|Many {{trucks are}} {{supported}} by leaf <b>spring</b> <b>suspensions.</b> Leaf <b>springs</b> offer exceptional articulation, a large payload and can take {{a substantial amount of}} abuse. With the correct methods they can be modified to help a vehicle carry more weight, have better articulation or to fit large oversized tires. Some vehicles may be equipped with front and rear leaf springs or just rear leaf springs with independent front suspension.|$|R
2500|$|Working {{to modify}} {{and improve the}} novice team's March 731 chassis, Postlethwaite {{elevated}} the team into serious contention and the following year designed the team's car from scratch. 'Doc' Postlethwaite's [...] Hesketh 308 secured a number of podium positions. The following year he further developed the car's unusual rubber <b>spring</b> <b>suspension</b> and saw his creation take victory at the Dutch Grand Prix {{in the hands of}} James Hunt.|$|E
2500|$|Station wagon models {{received}} a new three-way tailgate for 1977; the clamshell tailgate was gone. The three-seat models featured a rear-facing third seat for two occupants making these cars eight-passenger models. The cargo capacity {{was reduced to}} , and although the station wagon could still carry a [...] sheet of plywood, this could now only {{be done with the}} tailgate down.

2500|$|European {{locomotives}} usually use [...] "plate frames", {{where two}} vertical flat plates form the main chassis, {{with a variety}} of spacers and a buffer beam at each end to keep them apart. When inside cylinders are mounted between the frames, the plate frames are a single large casting that forms a major support. The axleboxes slide up and down to give some <b>sprung</b> <b>suspension,</b> against thickened webs attached to the frame, called [...] "hornblocks".|$|R
30|$|The chassis is a force-path subsystem. By {{comparing}} different classic automotive {{structures for}} technical feasibility and cost, a chassis frame is designed using swing arm and leaf <b>spring</b> <b>suspensions</b> {{as shown in}} Figure  6 (c). The combination of the steering subsystem with the chassis is shown as Figure  6 (d) and 6 (e). The chassis links the steering system using interface E. The rotation is performed by the steering shaft and bearings.|$|R
