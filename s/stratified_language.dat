30|$|Ideational metaphors are theorized as {{consisting}} of two kinds, experiential and logical (Martin 1992 a). This separation {{is based on the}} <b>stratified</b> <b>language</b> model suggested by Halliday & Hasan (1976) and Halliday (1985 a). Experiential metaphor is considered the metaphorical ways of meaning making where process (with a small p) is realized by a noun, and quality is realized by an adjective in lexicogrammar. Logical metaphor is the metaphorical ways of realizing the consequential and temporal relations inside clauses (Martin 1992 a). According to Martin (1992 a), logical and experiential metaphors cooperate when external conjunctive relations are realized metaphorically and “this interaction produces a high level of abstraction in text, making it inaccessible to large sections of the community” (Martin 1992 a, p. 407). The following example by Halliday (1985 a), p. 329 shows how the meanings are packed into nominal groups, forming GM instances; and how the causal relation between clauses realized within the clause.|$|E
30|$|Chapter 8, by David Caldwell, {{presents}} an interesting interdisciplinary study that compares the paralinguistic features of two distinct vocal performances: rapping and singing. It integrates work within systemic phonology, social semiotics and music studies, and locates paralanguage within the theoretical framework of SFL {{as a distinct}} modality that interacts with the <b>stratified</b> <b>language</b> system. Drawing on van Leeuwen’s (1999) paradigmatic approach to sound semiotics, Caldwell presents the paralinguistic features of the rap and the sung voice using a system network, capturing the systemic, meaningful choices that distinguish one voice from the other. Not only does the study describe the distinct meaning potentials of these two performance voices, but it also represents a successful attempt to integrate paralanguage within the theory of SFL. The chapter ends with some directions for future research, encouraging scholars to incorporate insights from systemic phonology and sound semiotics {{in the study of}} a wider variety of vocal sounds. The use of such vastly different musical texts for analysis in Chapter 7 and 8 is one of the gems of this volume, and pushes the boundaries of phonological analysis into new and interesting arenas.|$|E

40|$|Numerous palynological and {{geological}} studies {{testify to}} serious climatic disturbance {{leading to a}} catastrophic destruction of the Central-African forests in the regions of south Cameroon, south Central African Republic, Gabon and the Congo that started about 2500 years ago and lasted for 500 years or a bit longer depending on the region. This climatic disturbance was characterized by a more accentuated seasonality {{and led to the}} emergence of the so-called ‘savannah corridor’ in between forest refuge zones (Maley 2004, Maley & Brenac 1998, Ngomanda et al. 2009, Reynaud-Farrera et al. 1996, Vincens et al. 1994, Vincens et al. 1998). Several scholars have suggested that this corridor may have facilitated the migration of people from the northern savannas, in casu Bantu speech communities (Maley 2001, Schwartz 1992). This savannah corridor may thus have {{played an important role in}} the Bantu expansion and could in one way or the other be reflected in the internal Bantu classification. If this ‘savannah corridor’ did indeed shape historical relationships between Bantu languages, remaining traces are likely to be found in current-day Bantu languages. This is certainly so if one considers Bantu vocabulary for the so-called ‘pioneer species’ and their geographical distribution patterns among present-day Bantu languages. Plant names may serve as indicators of the complex <b>stratified</b> <b>language</b> history underlying the current Bantu language landscape (cf. Bostoen 2007). Pioneer species are trees that colonize natural forest gaps as well as deforested areas and dominate the early and middle stages of secondary succession. The botanical genera Cecropia and Musanga include very important pioneer species that colonize cleared and open areas with high light levels, respectively in tropical America and Africa. In this paper, we focus on one specific species, i. e. Musanga cecropioides, Two distinct sets of cognate Bantu terms occur among several present-day Bantu languages of West Central Africa (cf. Koni Muluwa 2010), one of which is reconstructible to Proto-Bantu, while the other is a later lexical innovation. This suggests that Bantu speakers were familiar with this species before they started to migrate from their homeland in the Cameroonian-Nigerian borderland, but that it disappeared from the habitat of a subset of them to be re-introduced only later. This is of high relevance for the ‘savannah corridor’ hypothesis. References: Bostoen, K. 2007. Bantu Plant Names as Indicators of Linguistic Stratigraphy in the Western Province of Zambia. In D.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{demonstrate}} how the mediatization of cases of woman shearing builds, in language and through language, an aesthetics of strangeness which reassures discourses that point out social, historical and cultural borders. In order to achieve this goal, two thoughts are articulated theoretically: the Bakhtinian thought, especially his insistence on the semiotic-ideological dimension of language, and Barthesian postulates, especially his understanding of the semiological construction of trauma. From the methodological point of view, two registers and the propagation of the shearing of women in two historical events are contrasted: in France, during the period called Liberation, in the 1940 s, and in present Brazil, in Rio de Janeiros’s slums which live side by side with the culture of drug traffic. In this study, we try to answer the following question: after so many decades, how does this French post-war voice emerge in the Brazilian context, (re-) signifying the same practices?

40|$|AbstractWe study a {{semantics}} for untyped, vanilla metaprograms, {{using the}} nonground representation for object level variables. We introduce {{the notion of}} language independence, which generalizes range restriction. We show that the vanilla metaprogram associated with a stratified normal object program is weakly <b>stratified.</b> For <b>language</b> independent, <b>stratified</b> normal object programs, we prove {{that there is a}} natural one-to-one correspondence between atoms p(t 1,…,tr) in the perfect Herbrand model of the object program and solve(p(t 1,…,tr)) atoms in the weakly perfect Herb and model of the associated vanilla metaprogram. Thus, for this class of programs, the weakly perfect Herbrand model provides a sensible semantics for the metaprogram. We show that this result generalizes to nonlanguage independent programs {{in the context of an}} extended Herbrand semantics, designed to closely mirror the operational behavior of logic programs. Moreover, we also consider a number of interesting extensions and/or variants of the basic vanilla metainterpreter.

40|$|AbstractMulti-axiom grammars (MAG) are {{alternatives}} to single-axiom context free grammars (CFG) and all-axiom algebraic grammars (AG) for programming language specification. Neither phrase recognition nor algebraic mechanisms for language processing {{are supported by}} CFGs. AGs support algebraic mechanisms for language processing but specify a smaller class of languages. MAGs avoid these limitations. This paper describes a new parsing algorithm developed on this basis which recognizes any phrase in the language. Moreover, it does so by distributing the parsing task among a collection of smaller parsers which handle well-defined layers of the language in a piping manner. These language-layers {{are determined by the}} algebraic properties of the MAGs and are described in the paper. Basic definitions are given for multi-axiom grammar and language as well as for algebraic notions of subgrammar, primitive subgrammar, quotient grammar, and grammar/language layer. Algorithms are described to <b>stratify</b> a programming <b>language</b> into a hierarchy of layers, to construct parsers for each layer analogous to LR construction, and to accomplish the overall task of multi-layered parsing in pipeline fashion based on a tokenization which occurs between the language layers.

Each of these distinctions is explored in turn, and in this exploration it becomes clear how Hjelmslev defines his most important distinctions, namely, content-expression and form-substance-purport, which form the corner-stones of his <b>stratified</b> model of <b>language,</b> on different levels of abstraction.

The specific nature of Hjelmslev's theory is further fleshed out by relating his distinctions to Saussure's theory of language; and by further contextualizing his model, historiographically, in the framework of (1) the earlier study of the phonic side of language in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and (2) Barthes's later reinterpretation of one of Hjelmslev's most innovative concepts, namely, the connotative semiotic...|$|R

Following the ESP tradition, the paper takes the communicative purpose as the defining feature of a genre and follow Martin’s <b>stratified</b> model of <b>language</b> and context in for the analysis. Based on a preliminary study conducted among three geologists, this paper proposes a model revealing the cognitive process (es) in recognition of instances of genre. According to the model, the cognitive recognition of a genre basically goes from the bottom up, and the effects that the generic features have on recognition of instances of genres decrease from the top down. However, as the cognitive processes are very complicated, the top-down and bottom-up processes may sometimes interweave.

This study therefore aimed to evaluate the interrelationship between structural factors of supply and the volume of services that are provided by primary care physicians in Switzerland. Methods The study was designed as a cross-sectional investigation, based on the complete claims data from all Swiss health care insurers for the year 2004, which covered information from 6087 primary care physicians and 4. 7 million patients. Utilization-based health service areas were constructed and used as spatial units to analyze effects of density of supply. Hierarchical linear models were applied to analyze the data. Results The data showed that, within a service area, a higher density of primary care physicians was associated with higher mortality rates and specialist density but not with treatment intensity in primary care. Higher specialist density was weakly associated with higher mortality rates and with higher treatment intensity density of primary care physicians. Annual physician-level data indicate a disproportionate increase of supplied services irrespective {{of the size of the}} number of patients treated during the same year and, even in high volume practices, no rationing but a paradoxical inducement of consultations occurred. The results provide empirical evidence that higher densities of primary care physicians, specialists and the availability of out-patient hospital clinics in a given area are associated with higher volume of supplied services per patient in primary care practices.

Design: Culture and Health Advisory Groups were used in Stage 1 to develop culturally fair cognitive items. In Stage 2, clinical testing of 42 items was conducted in a multicultural sample of consecutive new referrals to the geriatric medicine outpatient clinic at Liverpool Hospital, Sydney, Australia (n= 166). In Stage 3, the predictive accuracy of items was assessed in a random sampleof community-dwelling elderly persons <b>stratified</b> by <b>language</b> background and cognitive diagnosis and matched for sex and age (n= 90). Measurements: A research psychologist administered all cognitive items, using interpreters when needed. Each patient was comprehensively assessed by one of three geriatricians, who ordered relevant investigations, and implemented a standardized assessment of cognitive domains. The geriatricians also collected demographic information, and administered other functional and cognitivemeasures. DSM-IV criteria were used to assign cognitive diagnoses. Item validity and weights were assessed using frequency and logistic regression analyses. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve {{analysis was used to}} determine overall predictive accuracy of the RUDAS and the best cut-point for detecting cognitive impairment. Results: The 6 -item RUDAS assesses multiple cognitive domains including memory, praxis, language, judgement, drawing and body orientation. It appears not to be affected by gender, years of education, differential performance factors and preferred language. The area under the ROCcurve for the RUDAS was 0. 94. (95 % CI 0. 87 – 0. 98). At a cut-point of 23 (maximum score of 30), sensitivityand specificity were 89 % and 98 %, respectively. Inter-rater (0. 99) and test-retest (0. 98) reliabilities were very high.

Results: Participants (N = 348) had a median age of 24; 188 spoke Portuguese, and 160 spoke Echuabo. Mean HK- 27 scores were higher for Portuguese-speaking participants than Echuabo-speaking participants (68 % correct vs. 42 %, p, 0. 001). Internal reliability was strong (KR- 20. 0. 8) for scales in both languages.

For the total sample, no significant difference between males and females on Verbal, Performance and Full Scale IQ were found. On the factor indices, females scored marginally higher than males on Processing Speed at a level which was approaching significance (p = 0. 105), but no significant differences were found. On subtest performance, females significantly outperformed males on Digit Symbol (p = 0. 020). Differences which were approaching significance were found on Information (p = 0. 133) in favour of males, and on Matrix Reasoning (p = 0. 092) in favour of females. For subgroups of the total sample, the most significant differences in test performance were found for the African First Language private/"Model C" school cohort in favour of females. Thus the overriding implication that emerged from this research was that on this relatively highly educated sample, no significant gender differences in cognitive ability were apparent. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between HIV knowledge and HIV-related behaviors in settings like Mozambique {{has been limited}} {{by a lack of}} rigorously validated measures. A convenience sample of women seeking prenatal care at two clinics were administered an adapted, orally-administered, 27 item HIV-knowledge scale, the HK- 27. Validation analyses were <b>stratified</b> by survey <b>language</b> (Portuguese and Echuabo). Kuder-Richardson (KR- 20) coefficients estimated internal reliability. Construct validity was assessed with bivariate associations between HK- 27 scores (% correct) and selected participant characteristics. The association between knowledge, self-reported HIV testing, and HIV infection were evaluated with multivariable logistic regression. Participants (N =  348) had a median age of 24; 188 spoke Portuguese, and 160 spoke Echuabo. Mean HK- 27 scores were higher for Portuguese-speaking participants than Echuabo-speaking participants (68 % correct vs. 42 %, p 0. 8) for scales in both languages. Higher HK- 27 scores were significantly (p≤ 0. 05) correlated with more education, more media items in the home, a history of HIV testing, and participant work outside of the home for women of both languages. HK- 27 scores were independently associated with completion of HIV testing in multivariable analysis (per 1 % correct: aOR: 1. 02, 95 %CI: 0. 01 - 0. 03, p =  0. 01), but not with HIV infection. HK- 27 is a reliable and valid measure of HIV knowledge among Portuguese and Echuabo-speaking Mozambican women. The HK- 27 demonstrated significant knowledge deficits among women in the study, and higher scores were associated with higher HIV testing probability. Future studies should evaluate the role of the HK- 27 in longitudinal studies and in other populations...|$|R
40|$|To {{describe}} care worker-reported {{quality of}} care and to examine its relationship with staffing variables, work environment, work stressors, and implicit rationing of nursing care.; Cross-sectional study.; National, randomly selected sample of Swiss nursing homes, <b>stratified</b> according to <b>language</b> region and size.; A total of 4311 care workers of all educational backgrounds (registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, nurse aides) from 402 units in 155 nursing homes completed a survey between May 2012 and April 2013.; Care worker-reported {{quality of care}} was measured with a single item; predictors were assessed with established instruments (eg, Practice Environment Scale-Nurse Working Index) adapted for nursing home use. A multilevel logistic regression model was applied to assess predictors for quality of care.; Overall, 7 % of care workers rated {{the quality of care}} provided as rather low or very low. Important factors related to better quality of care were higher teamwork and safety climate (odds ratio [OR] 6. 19, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 4. 36 - 8. 79); better staffing and resources adequacy (OR 2. 94, 95 % CI 2. 08 - 4. 15); less stress due to workload (OR 0. 71, 95 % CI 0. 55 - 0. 93); less implicit rationing of caring, rehabilitation, and monitoring (OR 0. 34, 95 % CI 0. 24 - 0. 49); and less rationing of social care (OR 0. 80, 95 % CI 0. 69 - 0. 92). Neither leadership nor staffing levels, staff mix, or turnover was significantly related to quality of care.; Work environment factors and organizational processes are vital to provide high quality of care. The improvement of work environment, support in handling work stressors, and reduction of rationing of nursing care might be intervention points to promote high quality of care in nursing homes...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyThis {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the realm of the interpersonal: broadly, those linguistic phenomena involved in the negotiation of social relations and the expression of personal attitudes and feelings. The initial contention is that this realm has been consistently marginalised not only within linguistic theory, but more broadly within western culture, for cultural and ideological reasons whose implications extend into the bases of classical linguistic theory. Chapter 1 spells out the grounds for this contention and is followed by two further chapters, constituting Part I: Language and Social Relations. Chapter 2 identifies and critiques the range of ways in which the interpersonal has been conventionally interpreted: as style, as formality, as politeness, as power and solidarity, as the expressive, etc. This chapter concludes with an argument for the need for a <b>stratified</b> model of <b>language</b> in order to deal adequately with these phenomena. Chapter 3 proposes such a model, based on the systemic-functional approach to language as social semiotic. The register category tenor within this model is extended to provide a model of social relations as a semiotic system. The basis for the identification of the three tenor dimensions, power, distance and affect, is the identification of three modes of deployment or realisation of the interpersonal resources of English in everyday discourse: reciprocity, proliferation and amplification. Parts II and III turn their attention to one significant issue in the negotiation of social relations: address. The focus is explicitly on Australian English, but there is considerable evidence that most if not all of the forms discussed in Part II occur in other varieties of English, especially British and American, and that some at least of the practices discussed in Part III involve the same patterns of social relations with respect to the tenor dimensions of power, distance and affect. Because most varieties of contemporary English do not have a set of options for second-person pronominal address, {{as is the case in}} many of the world's languages, English speakers use names and other nominal forms which need to be described. Part II is descriptive in orientation, providing an account of the grammar of VOCATION in English, including a detailed description of the nominal forms used. Chapter 4 investigates the identification and functions of vocatives, and includes empirical investigations of vocative position in clauses and vocative incidence in relation to speech function or speech act choices. Chapter 5 presents an account of the grammar of English name forms, organised as a paradigmatic system. This chapter incorporates an account of the processes used to produce the various name-forms used in address, including truncation, reduplication and suffixation. Chapter 6 consists of an account of non-name forms of address, organised in terms of the systemic-functional account of nominal group structure. This chapter deals with single-word non-name forms of address and the range of nominal group structures used particularly to communicate attitude, both positive and negative. Part III is ethnographic in orientation. It describes some aspects of the use of the forms described in Part II in contemporary address practice in Australia and interprets such practice using the model of social relations as semiotic system presented in Part I. The major focuses of attention is on address practice in relation to the negotiation of gender relations, with some comment on generational relations of adults with children, on class relations and on ethnic relations in nation with a diverse population officially committed to a policy of a multiculturalism. Part III functions simultaneously as a coda for this thesis, and a prologue for the kind of ethnographic study that the project was originally intended to be, but which could not be conducted in the absence of an adequate linguistically-based model of social relations and an adequate description of the resources available for address in English...|$|R
