5000|$|There are {{two types}} of salvage: {{contract}} <b>salvage</b> and pure <b>salvage,</b> which is sometimes referred to as [...] "merit salvage". In contract <b>salvage</b> the owner of the property and salvor enter into a <b>salvage</b> contract prior to the commencement of <b>salvage</b> operations and the amount that the salvor is paid is determined by the contract. The most common <b>salvage</b> contract is called a [...] "Lloyd's Open Form <b>Salvage</b> Contract".|$|R
40|$|Many {{scholars}} {{argue that}} international maritime <b>salvage</b> law, and particularly American <b>salvage</b> law, not only does little to encourage 2 ̆ 2 pure 2 ̆ 2 life <b>salvage</b> on the high seas, but outright discourages the rescue of human life. Conversely, this author takes a novel stance - not only does current international <b>salvage</b> law promote pure life <b>salvage</b> through its tenets and compensation scheme, but American <b>salvage</b> law, on its face and as applied, violates international law binding upon America. Part I of this comment discusses current international <b>salvage</b> law - its inception, its purposes and its results. Part II places American life <b>salvage</b> law into a global setting, correlating American <b>salvage</b> law with the international <b>salvage</b> law that binds the United States. Part Ill analyzes the topic of compensation for life <b>salvage</b> - the mechanisms in place both domestically and internationally, {{as well as the}} principles discouraging life <b>salvage.</b> Part IV takes a look at current issues presented by international life <b>salvage.</b> Finally, this comment ends with the conclusion that international law is already in place to promote and adequately provide compensation for life <b>salvage.</b> Further, this comment will offer numerous solutions providing for the enforcement of such international law, both domestically and within the global community...|$|R

2500|$|Pure <b>salvage</b> {{claims are}} divided into [...] "{{high-order}}" [...] and [...] "low-order" [...] <b>salvage.</b> In high-order <b>salvage,</b> the salvor exposes himself and his crew {{to the risk of}} injury and loss or damage to his equipment in order to <b>salvage</b> the property that is in peril. Examples of high-order <b>salvage</b> are boarding a sinking ship in heavy weather, boarding a ship which is on fire, raising a ship, plane, or other sunken property, or towing a ship which is in the surf away from the shore. Low-order <b>salvage</b> occurs where the salvor is exposed to little or no personal risk. Examples of low-order <b>salvage</b> include towing another vessel in calm seas, supplying a vessel with fuel, or pulling a vessel off a sand bar. Salvors performing high order <b>salvage</b> receive substantially greater <b>salvage</b> award than those performing low order <b>salvage.</b>|$|R

5|$|Most of {{the guns}} that sank with Kronan were <b>salvaged</b> in the 1680s, but {{eventually}} the wreck fell into obscurity. Its exact position was rediscovered in 1980 by the amateur researcher Anders Franzén, who had also located the 17th-century warship Vasa in the 1950s. Yearly diving operations have since surveyed and excavated the wreck site and <b>salvaged</b> artifacts, and Kronan {{has become the most}} widely publicized shipwreck in the Baltic after Vasa. More than 30,000 artifacts have been recovered, and many have been conserved and put on permanent public display at the Kalmar County Museum in Kalmar.

5|$|On October 16, {{with the}} ship's coal stores running low, Captain Budington {{decided to run}} the Polaris aground near Etah. Having lost much of their bedding, clothing, and food when it was haphazardly jettisoned from the ship on October 12, the {{remaining}} 14 men were in poor condition to face another winter. They built a hut from lumber <b>salvaged</b> from the ship, and on October 24, extinguished the ship's boilers to conserve coal. The bilge pumps stopped for good, and the ship heeled over on her side, half out of water. Fortunately, the Etah Inuit helped the men survive the winter. After wintering ashore, the crew built two boats from <b>salvaged</b> wood from the ship, and on June 3 the crew sailed south. They were spotted and rescued in July by the whaler Ravenscraig, and returned home via Scotland.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundAlthough primary {{treatment}} of localized prostate cancer provides excellent oncologic control, some men who chose radiotherapy experience {{a recurrence of}} disease. There is no consensus on the most appropriate management of these patients after radiotherapy failure. In this single-institution review, we compare our oncologic outcome and toxicity between <b>salvage</b> prostatectomy and cryotherapy treatments. MethodsFrom January 2004 to June 2013, a total of 23 <b>salvage</b> procedures were performed. Six of those patients underwent <b>salvage</b> prostatectomy while 17 underwent <b>salvage</b> cryotherapy by two high-volume fellowship-trained urologists. Patients being considered for <b>salvage</b> therapy had localized disease at presentation, a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 10  years at recurrence, and a negative metastatic workup. Patients were followed to observe cancer progression and toxicity of treatment. ResultsPatients who underwent <b>salvage</b> cryotherapy were statistically older with {{a higher incidence of}} hypertension than our <b>salvage</b> prostatectomy cohort. With a mean follow up of 14. 1  months and 7. 2  months, the incidence of disease progression was 23. 5 % and 16. 7 % after <b>salvage</b> cryotherapy and prostatectomy, respectively. The overall complication rate was also 23. 5 % versus 16. 7 %, with the most frequent complication after <b>salvage</b> cryotherapy being urethral stricture and after <b>salvage</b> prostatectomy being severe urinary incontinence. There were no rectal injuries with <b>salvage</b> prostatectomy and one rectourethral fistula in the cohort after <b>salvage</b> cryotherapy. ConclusionWhile recurrences from primary radiotherapy for prostate cancer do occur, there is no consensus on its management. In our experience, <b>salvage</b> procedures were generally safe and effective. Both <b>salvage</b> cryotherapy and <b>salvage</b> prostatectomy allow for adequate cancer control with minimal toxicity...|$|R

5|$|The Tudor mansion was {{dismantled}} but, {{concerned that}} the stone would swiftly disintegrate during the demolition phase, Weddell's advisers ordered that a small explosive device be triggered in {{the centre of the}} house and the undamaged stones <b>salvaged.</b> However, the explosion had the effect of splitting the walls intact meaning that much of the building could be <b>salvaged</b> and shipped to the United States. The first shipments arrived in Richmond, Virginia in early 1926, but they were soaked in seawater and had to be dried in a barn for up to six months. From the very beginning, the Weddells planned on deeding the house to the Virginia Historical Society and allocating the west wing of the structure as a museum once it was rebuilt in Virginia. The Weddells also intended the structure to become the society's new headquarters.|$|E
