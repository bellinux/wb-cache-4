40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to repair and fix performance Mk 3 Volkswagen-Audi 1. 8 -liter engine for proper operation and reduce environmental pollution. Initial tests compression, oil pressure and leak in the cooling system of the engine was made, the removal and disassembly of the engine was proceeded, the wear in the internal elements (crankshaft, pistons, cylinder block, valves, headstock) was measured. Additionally the process of grinding cylinders and crank was made, items that showed wear (pistons, wheels, valve guides, rod bearings and bench, packaging, retainers, <b>oil</b> <b>seals,</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pump)</b> were changed. The engine assembly and installation in the vehicle was proceeded; the final tests (compression, oil pressure and leak in engine cooling systems) operation and proper performance of the engine were verified. The vehicle engine Volkswagen Golf Manhattan where this project was implemented {{is owned by the}} Engineer Sonia Maria Roman and the vehicle was used for the thesis project and to lead the graduation process of the undersigned...|$|R
2500|$|An {{auxiliary}} <b>oil</b> system <b>pump</b> is used {{to supply}} oil at the start-up of the steam turbine generator. It supplies the hydraulic oil system required for steam turbine's main inlet steam stop valve, [...] the governing control valves, the bearing and <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> systems, the relevant hydraulic relays and other mechanisms.|$|R
50|$|Coolant {{passages}} {{were located}} between the cylinders. The gerotor-type <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> was {{located at the}} bottom rear of the engine, and provided oil to both the crankshaft main bearings and the cylinder heads (via the lifters and pushrods, {{as opposed to a}} drilled passage on LA engines). Chrysler's engineers also redesigned the <b>oil</b> <b>seals</b> on the crankshaft to improve anti-leak <b>seal</b> performance. The <b>oil</b> pan was also made from thicker steel, and was installed with a more leak-resistant silicone-rubber gasket.|$|R
25|$|<b>Seal</b> <b>oil</b> (uquq) {{was used}} by most households. <b>Seal</b> <b>oil</b> {{is a source of}} eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Dried fish is usually eaten with <b>seal</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|R
50|$|Electric <b>oil</b> <b>pumps</b> are not used, {{again for}} reliability. Some 'turbo timer' {{electric}} auxiliary <b>oil</b> <b>pumps</b> are sometimes fitted to turbocharged engines. These are a second <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> {{that continues to}} run after the engine has stopped, providing cooling oil to the hot bearings of a turbocharger for some minutes, whilst it cools down. These are supplementary pumps and do not replace the main, mechanical, <b>oil</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|R
50|$|There is {{a common}} oiling problem with the pre-1992 R32 RB26 motors, as the surface where the {{crankshaft}} meets the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> was machined too small, eventually leading to <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> failure at high rpm. This issue was resolved in later versions of the RB26 with a wider <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> drive. Aftermarket performance parts makers also make <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> extension drive collars to rectify this problem. More recently a spline drive solution has been developed by an aftermarket tuner Supertec Racing who {{moves away from the}} OEM flat drive system and uses splines to drive the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> gears {{in the same way as}} Toyota's 1JZ GTE engine as found in the Supra MKIII. This kit is available for most uprated RB26 <b>oil</b> <b>pumps</b> including Nissans own OEM, N1 and Nismo.|$|R
40|$|Studies {{suggest that}} ω- 3 {{polyunsaturated}} fatty acids (PUPAs) are beneficial in inhibiting {{the growth of}} cancer cells and may enhance the cytotoxicity induced by certain chemotherapeutic agents. It is known that <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> is rich in ω- 3 PUPAs. The effect of <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> and its role on the cytotoxicity and apoptosis induced by paclitaxel was, therefore, investigated in breast cancer cell lines, MCF- 7 and MDA-MB- 231. [...] MCF- 7 and MDA-MB- 231 cells were respectively treated with <b>seal</b> <b>oil,</b> paclitaxel, and paclitaxel in combination with <b>seal</b> <b>oil.</b> Cytotoxicity was evaluated by MTT assay. Apoptosis was investigated by morphological changes and DNA strand break assay. Western blot assay {{was used to assess}} the expression of p 53 and Bcl- 2 proteins. The lipid peroxide products were measured by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TEARS) assay and the intracellular lipid composition was determined by gas chromatography (GC). [...] MTT assay showed that <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> induced cell death and enhanced paclitaxel cytotoxicity in both cell lines. The IC₅₀ values of paclitaxel in MCF- 7 and MDA-MB- 231 cells were reduced 3. 3 - and 2. 4 -fold, respectively, by the inclusion of 0. 016 % <b>seal</b> <b>oil.</b> Morphological assessment and DNA strand break assay indicated that more cells treated with paclitaxel in combination with <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> underwent apoptosis than that with paclitaxel alone treatment. <b>Seal</b> <b>oil</b> alone was also found to induce apoptosis in both cell lines. Western blot showed that the expression of apoptosis inhibitor Bcl- 2 protein in both cell lines was down-regulated by <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> and was inhibited further when cells were treated with paclitaxel in combination with <b>seal</b> <b>oil.</b> GC assay determined that the total PUFAs increased significantly in the intracellular lipid composition following incubation with <b>seal</b> <b>oil,</b> which may be responsible for the increased lipid peroxides found in cells incubated under the same conditions. [...] In addition to <b>seal</b> <b>oil,</b> Intralipid®, which is a soybean oil emulsion mainly containing ω- 6 PUFAs, was also studied for its cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction. It was found that soybean oil induced cell death in the MCF- 7 cell line but promoted cell growth in the MDA-MB- 231 cell line. Soybean oil did not induce apoptosis as characterized by morphological assessment. [...] In conclusion, <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> was found to induce apoptosis, and to enhance the cytotoxicity and apoptosis induced by paclitaxel in both breast cancer cell lines, which may be due to its ability to down-regulate the expression of Bcl- 2 protein and to produce lipid peroxides. The beneficial effect exerted by <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> suggests that <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> may have a great potential in the management of cancer...|$|R

Fish oil, rich in ω- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), {{has been reported to}} be beneficial in alleviating the toxicities induced by CsA. <b>Seal</b> <b>oil</b> is another source of ω- 3 PUFAs. This project was designed to investigate the potential of using <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> to reduce the nephrotoxicity of CsA. [...] The cytotoxicity of CsA alone and in combination with <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> emulsion, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), main PUF As in <b>seal</b> <b>oil,</b> was determined using the MTT assay and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage in LLC-PK 1 cell line.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{hydraulic}} efficiency, modern automatic transmissions tend to apply electric <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> in their hydraulic system. The electric <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> can support the mechanical <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> for cooling, lubrication, and maintaining the line pressure at low engine speeds. In addition, the start–stop function can be realized {{by means of the}} electric oil pump; thus, the fuel consumption can be further reduced. This article proposes a method of applying two-pump system (one electric <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> and one mechanical <b>oil</b> <b>pump)</b> in automatic transmissions based on the forward driving simulation. A mathematical model for calculating the transmission power loss is developed. The power loss transfers to heat which requires oil flow for cooling and lubrication. A leakage model is developed to calculate the leakage of the hydraulic system. In order to satisfy the flow requirement, a flow-based control strategy for the electric <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> is developed. Simulation results of different driving cycles show that there is a best combination of the size of electric <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> and the size of mechanical <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> with respect to the optimal energy conservation. Besides, the two-pump system can also satisfy the requirement of the start–stop function. This research is extremely valuable for the forward design of a two-pump system in automatic transmissions with respect to energy conservation and start–stop function...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to the adequate lubrication of the moving parts, the oil flow in a hermetic reciprocating compressor has a significant influence on the thermal characteristics of a compressor. The present work {{is concerned with the}} investigation of the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> system of a reciprocating hermetic compressor used in household refrigeration appliances. The considered <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> system consists of a centrifugal pump immersed in the oil sump of the hermetic compressor and a helical groove machined on the crankshaft. The focus of this work lies on the immersed part of the centrifugal <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> and its interaction with the oil in the oil sump. To analyse the flow in the immersed area of the <b>oil</b> <b>pump,</b> the commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software ANSYS Fluent is used. The free surface of the oil flow is modelled with the volume of fluid (VOF) method. A numerical investigation is used to study the influence of the immersion depth and the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> design on <b>oil</b> mass flow rate and flow field at the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> intake. To evaluate the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> regarding the applicability in variable speed compressors, the influence of the rotational speed on the oil mass flow is also explored...|$|R
50|$|The motors are {{designed}} with a <b>sealed</b> <b>oil</b> sump from which <b>oil</b> is <b>pumped</b> continuously to lubricate the bearings. A fan draws air from the engine room through the motor to cool it and returns the exhaust air to the engine room through a water-cooled heat exchanger. This arrangement reduces the possibility of water being drawn into the motor {{should there be a}} leak in the cooler. The engine is also fitted with a heater to keep it warm when not running so as to prevent condensation internally. Temperature and revolution speed are monitored and displayed on the control panel.|$|R

40|$|Fish are a {{rich source}} of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), two {{long-chain}} polyunsaturated n- 3 fatty acids (LC n- 3 PUFA) with cardiovascular benefits. A related but less-investigated LC n- 3 PUFA, docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), is more common in <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> and pasture-fed red meats. This study compared indicators of platelet function and plasma lipids in healthy volunteers given supplements containing these different fatty acids (FA) for 14 days. Subjects, randomised into three groups of ten, consumed capsules of tuna oil (210 mg EPA, 30 mg DPA, 810 mg DHA), <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> (340 mg EPA, 230 mg DPA, 450 mg DHA) or placebo (sunola) oil. Supplementary LC n- 3 PUFA levels were approximately 1 g/day in both fish and <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> groups. Baseline dietary FA and other nutrient intakes were similar in all groups. Both fish and <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> elevated platelet DHA levels (P < 0. 01). <b>Seal</b> <b>oil</b> also raised platelet DPA and EPA levels (P < 0. 01), and decreased p-selectin (P = 0. 01), a platelet activation marker negatively associated with DPA (P = 0. 03) and EPA (P < 0. 01) but not DHA. Plasma triacylglycerol decreased (P = 0. 03) and HDL-cholesterol levels increased (P = 0. 01) with <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> only. Hence, <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> may be more efficient than fish oil at promoting healthy plasma lipid profiles and lowering thrombotic risk, possibly due to its high DPA as well as EPA content.

40|$|In the oil {{production}} process, some <b>oil</b> <b>pumps</b> {{exist in the}} light load running and empty pumping problems, which result in the waste of electric energy. In order to realize the <b>oil</b> <b>pumping</b> energy saving optimal control by adopting <b>oil</b> <b>pumping</b> start-stop intermittent control scheme, an intelligent energy saving optimal control system based on genetic algorithm and wavelet neural network is proposed in this paper. The Morlet wavelet is adopted as the activation function of neural network and builds the wavelet neural networkandthe structure and parameters of the wavelet neural network which are chromosome encoded, and the genetic algorithm is used to optimize the connection weights and the scale parameters {{in order to improve}} the generalization ability and the approximation ability of neural networks.

40|$|Background: Food {{hypersensitivity}} is a prevalent {{condition with}} poorly characterized underlying mechanisms. In the present pilot study we investigated effects of <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> and soy oil on meal-induced symptoms and gastric accommodation {{in patients with}} subjective food hypersensitivity (FH). Single dose experiment: On three consecutive days, 10 mL of <b>seal</b> <b>oil,</b> soy oil, or saline were randomly administered into the duodenum of 10 patients with subjective FH and 10 healthy volunteers through a nasoduodenal feeding tube 10 – 20 minutes before the ingestion of a test meal. Short-term treatment study: 24 patients with subjective FH were randomly allocated to 10 days’ treatment with either 10 mL of <b>seal</b> or soy <b>oil,</b> self-administrated through an indwelling nasoduodenal feeding tube, 3 times daily. In both experiments meal-induced abdominal symptoms and gastric accommodation were measured by visual analogue scales and external ultrasound respectively. Results: Symptoms and gastric accommodation were not significantly influenced by single doses of <b>seal</b> or soy <b>oil.</b> When given daily for 10 days, <b>seal</b> <b>oil,</b> but not soy oil, reduced total symptom scores significantly (P = 0. 03). The symptomatic improvement {{was not associated with}} improvements in gastric accommodation. Conclusion: Daily administration of <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> may benefit patients with subjective FH. The beneficial effect of <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> in patients with subjective FH can not be ascribed to improved gastric accommodation. </p...|$|R
