50|$|Knighton {{retained}} its agricultural character into the 19th century, whilst Leicester {{to the north}} and Wigston to the south were becoming centres of the framework knitting cottage industry. The first effects of the expansion of Leicester were felt, not in the village itself, but {{in the area of the}} parish that became known as Stoneygate. Suburban development had its beginnings in the 1770s and 80s with a substantial private dwelling called Stoneygate House, on what later became Toller Road, followed by the conversion of a farmhouse on the Harborough Turnpike, (now London Road) into a 'gentleman's residence' called The <b>Stoney</b> <b>Gate.</b> By the 1840s there were 10 houses strung along the London Road, occupied by some of Leicester's most prosperous tradesmen and industrialists. The trend of wealthy clients getting a house built for their own use continued up to 1863, by which time there were 32 such spacious mansions. From 1865 the side roads began to be opened up, developed by speculative builders, and a more rapid expansion and infilling got underway.|$|E
