This results in each batch of cakes varying in texture, moisture, volume, and height. Surfactants {{that have been used}} to improve the whipping properties of dehydrated eggs are sodium desoxycholate, triethyl citrate, triacetin, <b>sodium</b> <b>oleate</b> and oleic acid. Frozen egg whites do not form as firm or stable foams as fresh egg whites. It may be necessary to adjust the pH if the eggs have been refrigerated for a long time because they become more alkaline than fresh eggs.

These improve the color and cake structure by lowering the pH, however they do not work as well as cream of tartar.|$|E
50|$|Total {{fatty matter}} (TFM) {{is one of}} the most {{important}} characteristics describing the quality of soap and it is always specified in commercial transactions. It is defined as the total amount of fatty matter, mostly fatty acids, that can be separated from a sample after splitting with mineral acid, usually hydrochloric acid. The fatty acids most commonly present in soap are oleic, stearic and palmitic acids and pure, dry, <b>sodium</b> <b>oleate</b> has TFM 92.8%, while top quality soap noodles now increasingly used for making soap tablets in small and medium size factories, are typically traded with a specification TFM 78% min., moisture 14% max. But besides moisture, finished commercial soap, especially laundry soap, also contains fillers used to lower its cost or confer special properties, plus emollients, preservatives, etc. and then the TFM can be as low as 50%. Fillers, which are usually dry powders, also make the soap harder, harsher on the skin and with greater tendency to become 'mushy' in water and so low TFM is usually associated with hardness and lower quality. In older days in Europe and in some countries now, soap with TFM 75% minimum was referred to as Grade 1 and 65% minimum as Grade 2 and less 60% as Grade 3.|$|E

The mechanisms regulating fat-stimulated GLP- 1 release have, however, not been clarified in detail. Aim: We aimed to investigate the effect of intraduodenal (ID) fat hydrolysis on GLP- 1 release and test whether the signal is mediated through cholecystokinin (CCK) - 1 receptors. Design and Setting: Thirty-four healthy, male ambulatory volunteers were studied in three consecutive, randomized, double blind, crossover studies. Intervention: There were three interventions: 1) 12 subjects received an ID fat infusion with or without orlistat, an irreversible inhibitor of gastrointestinal lipases, in comparison with vehicle; 2) 12 subjects received ID <b>sodium</b> <b>oleate</b> (C 18 : 1), ID sodium caprylate (C 8 : 0), or ID vehicle; and 3) 10 subjects received ID <b>sodium</b> <b>oleate</b> with and without the CCK- 1 receptor antagonist dexloxiglumide or ID vehicle plus iv saline (placebo). The effect of these treatments on GLP- 1 concentrations and CCK release was quantified. Results: The following results were reached: 1) ID fat induced significant increase in GLP- 1 concentrations (P > 0. 004), and inhibition of fat hydrolysis by orlistat abolished this effect; 2) <b>sodium</b> <b>oleate</b> significantly stimulated GLP- 1 release (P > 0. 008), whereas sodium caprylate was ineffective compared with controls; and 3) dexloxiglumide administration abolished the effect of <b>sodium</b> <b>oleate</b> on GLP- 1.

The biodegradation has been assessed under different conditions, namely during growth, {{in the presence}} of the cells, metabolite or an active culture. Xanthate biodegradation was found to be better {{in the presence of}} an active culture or metabolite, while the biodegradation of dodecylammonium acetate was more efficient during bacterial growth. The efficacy of biodegradation of <b>sodium</b> <b>oleate</b> was the highest using an active culture. The growth of the organism could be successfully achieved {{in the presence of the}} organic collectors. The surface chemical changes brought about by the interaction between the minerals, namely galena, quartz or calcite and collector, metabolite or cells served as indicators of the biodegradation process. The biological stripping of the adsorbed collector reagents from mineral surfaces was also confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy...|$|E
40|$|Anaerobic {{treatment}} {{systems are}} becoming increasingly popular to treat complex organic wastes that contain carbohydrates, proteins and lipids. Lipids are widely found in sewage and industrial wastewaters. Dairy, edible oil, fat refining, slaughterhouse, wool scouring, meat processing plants and grease-trap wastes from restaurants generate wastewater high in lipids. Although {{it is well known}} that lipids can be degraded by biological process, they have been reported to inhibit anaerobic processes by causing sludge flotation and wash-out. The inhibitory effect of lipids in anaerobic process has also been attributed to the long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) which are the hydrolysed products of lipids. It has been shown that LCFA and lipids inhibit the formation of granular sludge in Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactors and that the adsorption of LCFAs on to the granules can result in its flotation and washout. It was also found that the degradation of LCFA was very poor. Various techniques have been employed to enhance degradation of lipids and these include physico-chemical pre-treatment, application of two stage treatment employing new reactor designs like Expanded Granular Sludge Bed (EGSB). This thesis investigated the influence of co-substrates, both in the form of hydrolysed products and polymeric form, on reducing the toxicity and enhancing the degradation of LCFA and lipids in a single stage and two stage upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors. The investigations were carried out on both microbiological and physico-chemical aspects. A combination of techniques including the use of light microscopy (LM), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), transmission electron microscopy (SEM) and Fluorescent In Situ Hybridisation (FISH) was used to study the characteristics of microbial aggregates and to locate microbial populations within these aggregates. The microbial populations visualised using FISH techniques were Bacteria, Archaea, Methanobacteriaceae, Methanomicrobiales and Methanosarcinaceae. The performance of digesters was also monitored by measuring bulk parameters such as concentration of residual substrates, intermediate products (LCFAs, volatile fatty acids), methane (or gas) production rate and chemical oxygen demand of treated effluent. Initially batch assays were carried out to determine the effects of glucose (hydrolysis product of carbohydrate) and cysteine (hydrolysis product of protein) on the toxicity of <b>sodium</b> <b>oleate</b> (hydrolysis product of lipid) to methanogenesis. The results showed that glucose and cysteine addition could reduce the toxicity of <b>sodium</b> <b>oleate</b> on the methanogenesis and enhance the degradation of <b>sodium</b> <b>oleate.</b> While the addition of glucose had a better effect than cysteine on decreasing the toxicity of <b>sodium</b> <b>oleate,</b> the combination of glucose and cysteine had the optimal result to stimulate the degradation of <b>sodium</b> <b>oleate.</b> Secondly the effect of addition of glucose, cysteine and <b>sodium</b> <b>oleate</b> as co-substrates on the characteristics of granules in an LCFA fed single stage UASB were investigated. It was shown that the addition of glucose produced the best results on the formation of granules while both cysteine and <b>sodium</b> <b>oleate</b> adversely affected the granule formation. In a LCFA inhibited digester glucose and cysteine addition enhanced the recoveries of different anaerobic microbial communities. Although the effects of glucose and cysteine on the various microbial groups were different, the combination of glucose and cysteine had the optimal results on recoveries of all bacterial groups. The next half of the thesis investigated the influence of starch and yeast extract on the hydrolysis and degradation of canola oil by application of one and two stage UASB reactors. The results showed that the combined addition of protein and carbohydrate had an optimal effect on enhancing the hydrolysis of lipid compared to the addition of only protein or carbohydrate by promoting a balanced growth of the microbial groups. It was also demonstrated that a two- stage UASB reactor performed better in terms of extent of lipid hydrolysis and methanogenesis than a one-stage UASB reactor...|$|E
