2500|$|Various {{scholars}} {{have used a}} synthesis of evidence to present models to suggest {{an answer to the}} questions that surround the Anglo-Saxon settlement. These questions include: How many migrants were there? When did the [...] "Saxons" [...] gain political ascendency? What happened to the 'Romano-Brittonic' peoples in the south-east of Britain? The Anglo-Saxons were a mix of invaders, migrants and acculturated indigenous people. The ratios and relationships between these formative elements {{at the time of the}} Anglo-Saxon settlement are the subject of enquiry. The traditional interpretation of the settlement of Britain has been subject to profound reappraisal, with scholars embracing the evidence for both migration and acculturation. [...] Heinrich Härke explains the nature of this agreement: [...] "It is now widely accepted that the Anglo-Saxons were not just transplanted Germanic invaders and settlers from the Continent, but the outcome of insular interactions and changes. But we are still lacking explicit models that <b>suggest</b> <b>how</b> this ethnogenetic process might have worked in concrete terms".|$|E

While Ash Brown of Experiments in Manga concluded [...] "Esuno does some interesting things with it", Shaenon Garrity wrote for About.com that [...] "The concept of urban legends coming to life is intriguing, but it's been done better—with creepier creatures, more atmospheric artwork, and cleverer twists on the basic premise—in manga like Eiji Otsuka's and Housui Yamazaki's Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service and CLAMP's xxxHolic." [...] Thomas Zoth of Mania considered the first volume [...] "fails {{to take full advantage of}} its potential" [...] because of its episodic nature and lack of characters development. In a review of the whole series, Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku dubbed it [...] "great fun" [...] and said it [...] "gets a lot of mileage out of its premise", praising how it interchanges between horror, action, comedy and romance and how in [...] "each case you learn about a different Japanese urban legend and get hints about the deeper motivations and personal histories of each of the three main characters." [...] Both Carlo Santos of Anime News Network and Chris Zimmerman of Comic Book Bin also praised its mix of action and horror, and Santos called it [...] "the perfect horror-suspense blend". Lori Henderson of Manga Xanadu said [...] "it's the human elements of the stories, and their resolutions that [...] found to be the most interesting". Oliver Ho of PopMatters considered it is full of aspects that were worth [...] "a ponderous and academic exercise", saying that the series [...] "seems to be a meditation ... on the relationship between storytelling and psychology." [...] He compared the fact that in the manga [...] "characters must confront personal demons and fears in order to overcome evil spirits" [...] to an affirmation by Bruno Bettelheim's on The Uses of Enchantment, where he writes that [...] "a myth, like a fairy tale, may express an inner conflict in symbolic form and <b>suggest</b> <b>how</b> it may be solved." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1943, while {{pursuing}} his shock research, Blalock {{was approached}} by pediatric cardiologist Helen Taussig, who was seeking a surgical solution to a complex and fatal four-part heart anomaly called tetralogy of Fallot (also known as blue baby syndrome, although other cardiac anomalies produce blueness, or cyanosis). In infants born with this defect, blood is shunted past the lungs, thus creating oxygen deprivation and a blue pallor. Having treated many such patients in her work in Hopkins's Harriet Lane Home, Taussig was desperate to find a surgical cure. According to the accounts in Thomas's 1985 autobiography and in a 1967 interview with medical historian Peter Olch, Taussig suggested only {{that it might be}} possible to [...] "reconnect the pipes" [...] in some way to increase the level of blood flow to the lungs but did not <b>suggest</b> <b>how</b> this could be accomplished. Blalock and Thomas realized immediately that the answer lay in a procedure they had perfected for a different purpose in their Vanderbilt work, involving the anastomosis (joining) of the subclavian artery to the pulmonary artery, which had the effect of increasing blood flow to the lungs. Thomas was charged with the task of first creating a blue baby-like condition in a dog, and then correcting the condition by means of the pulmonary-to-subclavian anastomosis. Among the dogs on whom Thomas operated was one named Anna, who became the first long-term survivor of the operation and the only animal to have her portrait hung on the walls of Johns Hopkins. In nearly two years of laboratory work involving 200 dogs, Thomas was able to replicate two of the four cardiac anomalies involved in tetralogy of Fallot. He did demonstrate that the corrective procedure was not lethal, thus persuading Blalock that the operation could be safely attempted on a human patient. [...] Blalock was impressed with Thomas's work; when he inspected the procedure performed on Anna, he reportedly said, [...] "This looks like something the Lord made." [...] Even though Thomas knew he was not allowed to operate on patients at that time, he still followed Blalock's rules and assisted him during surgery.|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, Bennett {{wrote the}} first of four books with 'In Search of' in their title, In Search of the Sacred: Anthropology and the Study of Religion, in [...] which he called for a {{combination}} of historical, textual and participant observation research to shed light on how religion is lived as well as on its history and official dogmas. [...] He argued that no researcher is neutral and that we all need to engage in reflexivity to guard against bias and the imposition of a priori presuppositions, so that, as a reviewer commented, [...] "suddenly the act of observation becomes the subject of observation" [...] and [...] "for a teacher like Bennett, his own experience as an ordained minister and missionary, his own experience with the give and take of ecumenical teaching becomes the data of religious thought". [...] "Bennett", Dening continued, [...] "is not independent of all the observations made through centuries of thought", so [...] "there is convergence: library and field, intellect and emotion, thought and experience in the end come together". [...] The book, said this reviewer, helped [...] "to make the exposition of {{more than a hundred years}} of thought on the study of religions lucid and memorable". [...] Alan Race, in another review, described the book as cutting [...] "through a dense thicket, yielding a clear, highly readable survey of how" [...] anthropology and Religious Studies [...] "have interacted and failed to interact", although remarking that it mainly discussed European history. Bennett followed this in 1998 with In Search of Muhammad and in 2001 with In Search of Jesus: Insider and Outsider Images. [...] A. G Noorani describes In Search of Muhammad as [...] "an earnest effort by a devout Christian to understand Muhammad, and places" [...] Bennett [...] "in the ranks of others whose services Minou Reeves [...] acknowledges in her survey of Western writing on Muhammad." [...] Commenting on Bennett's discussion of the sources available for the life of Muhammad, Hugh Goddard says that while he is [...] "not as negative" [...] as [...] "some modern Western scholars", neither [...] "is he uncritical of them", suggesting that [...] "some traditions, particularly concerning Muhammad’s miracles and the role of women, should be judged as unreliable." [...] Referring to Bennett's attempt to <b>suggest</b> <b>how</b> [...] "Christ and Muhammad might be viewed as somehow complementary, rather than as rivals" [...] he called this a [...] "brave attempt" [...] even though [...] "there are no easy answers to such a significant question." [...] Citations include Gerard Rixhon, who says that he makes [...] "words of Bennett's" [...] his [...] "own [...] "when he wrote his searching book on Muhammad" [...] and aimed [...] "to hear Muslim voices." ...|$|E

60|$|Standing amid so much ancient dust, it is {{difficult}} to spare the reader the commonplaces of enthusiasm, on which hundreds of tourists have already insisted. Over this half-worn pavement, and beneath this Arch of Titus, the Roman armies had trodden in their outward march, to fight battles a world's width away. Returning victorious, with royal captives and inestimable spoil, a Roman triumph, that most gorgeous pageant of earthly pride, had streamed and flaunted in hundred-fold succession over these same flagstones, and through this yet stalwart archway. It is politic, however, to make few allusions to such a past; nor, if we would create an interest in the characters of our story, is it wise to <b>suggest</b> <b>how</b> Cicero's foot may have stepped on yonder stone, or how Horace was wont to stroll near by, making his footsteps chime with the measure of the ode that was ringing in his mind.
