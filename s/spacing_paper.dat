40|$|This thesis treats {{different}} aspects of time-frequency analysis and pseudodifferential operators, with particular emphasis on techniques involving vector-valued functions and operator-valued symbols. The vector (Banach) space is either motivated by an application as in Paper I, where it is a space of stochastic variables, or {{is part of a}} general problem as in Paper II, or arises naturally from problems for scalar-valued operators and function <b>spaces,</b> as in <b>Paper</b> V. Paper III and IV fall outside this framework and treats algebraic aspects of time-frequency analysis and pseudodifferential operators for scalar-valued symbols and functions that are members of modulation <b>spaces.</b> <b>Paper</b> IV builds upon Paper III and applies the results to a filtering problem for second-order stochastic processes. Paper I treats the Wigner distribution of a Gaussian weakly harmonizable stochastic process defned on Rd. Paper II extends recent continuity results for pseudodifferential and localization operators, with symbols in modulation spaces, to the vector/operator-framework, where the vector space is a Hilbert or a Banach <b>space.</b> In <b>Paper</b> III we give algebraic results for the Weyl product acting on modulation spaces. We give suffcient conditions for a weighted modulation space to be an algebra under theWeyl product, and we also give necessary conditions for unweighted modulation <b>spaces.</b> In <b>Paper</b> IV we discretize the results of Paper III by means of a Gabor frame delined by a Gaussian function. Finally, Paper V deals with pseudodifferential operators with symbols that are almost periodic in the first variable. We show that such operators may be transformed to Fourier multiplier operators with operator- valued symbols such that the transformation preserves positivity and operator composition...|$|R

A short review of the basic ideas of q-deformed analysis is given. These considerations are continued by introducing q-deformed analogs of Fourier transformations and delta functions. Their properties are discussed in detail. Furthermore, q-deformed versions of sesquilinear forms are defined, their basic properties are derived, and q-analogs of the Fourier-Plancherel identity are proved. In paper II these reasonings are applied to wave functions on position and momentum space...|$|R
