40|$|Mytilopsis leucophaeata, an {{invasive}} bivalve species, causes fouling {{problems by}} settling on submerged constructions and in cooling water circuits in brackish water. To predict <b>spat</b> <b>fall</b> we studied the larval occurrence and settlement {{of this species}} in the brackish Noordzeekanaal canal in the Netherlands for several years (1989 - 1992), while measuring water temperature, salinity and chlorophyll a levels. Larvae were collected monthly {{by means of a}} plankton net drawn across the whole width of the canal. Settled spat were collected from PVC panels exposed for one month. Larvae first appeared in May or June, and reached maximum numbers in June or July, before disappearing in October, November or even December. The larval period started at a water temperature of 14 degrees C, reached maximum numbers at 19 - 23 degrees C and ended when it fell below 9 degrees C. No larvae were observed any-more until the temperature rose to 14 degrees C in the spring of the next year. <b>Spat</b> <b>fall</b> (June-November) was related to the water temperature in April. If the water temperature in April was lower than 12. 5 degrees C, <b>spat</b> <b>fall</b> started in July, while if temperature was already higher in April, it started a month earlier. The <b>spat</b> <b>fall</b> period started at 15 degrees C, with maximum numbers at 20 - 24 degrees C, and ended when the water temperature dropped below 5 degrees C.

40|$|A cockle {{fishery in}} Dundalk Bay has been {{infrequently}} documented since 1970. Cockle bearing sands and muds are 44. 5 km 2 in extent. The bay, {{which is in}} an SPA and a cSAC also supports large numbers of overwintering birds, of particular relevance is the oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus). In 2003 and 2004 when {{an assessment of the}} fishery was undertaken, cockles ranged from 0 to 8 + years of age, but the vast majority were 0 and 1 + animals. Growth was rapid and 53 % of asymptotic length (49. 1 mm) was achieved at the first winter. In agreement with observations elsewhere, the density of the rapidly growing animals was very low. The estimated cockle biomass in spring 2004 was 1, 654 tonnes comprising 143 million animals. A survey undertaken in spring 2004, suggested that <b>spat</b> <b>falls</b> contributing to the population may not have been evenly distributed throughout the Bay. Condition factor in 2003 and 2004 did not conform to an expected seasonal pattern, suggesting that some parts of the area supported better growth rates than others. Cockle landings from this fishery are of good quality. Cockle size is at {{the upper end of the}} range in Britain and Ireland and the majority of individuals landed by suction dredging were 1 + years old. Raked landings contained more 2 + cockles than suction-dredged ones. Damage to cockles discarded by suction dredging followed the pattern reported elsewhere and damage rates increased with the size of the animals. Some cockle landings have probably always been made in Dundalk Bay by picking and raking, but 2001 marked the beginning of an expansion of the dredge fishery, whose landings exceeded 200 tonnes in 2004. The necessity for controls and management of this fishery in the context of EU legislation and particularly within the constraints of the Habitats Directive is briefly examined.

5000|$|Anadara subcrenata is {{a fast-growing}} species, {{attaining}} {{a length of}} about 32 mm in one year and 47 mm in two. It is cultured in shallow areas of water in South Korea [...] and in Japan. The main spat collection centre in Japan is a very shallow lagoon with a muddy bottom, Nakanoume, in Shimane Prefecture. Specially designed, long collecting devices are made of wire and palm fibre and the spat settles on these over an attachment period of 3 to 4 days. The collectors, each of which may have nearly 100,000 spats settled on it, are transported to nursery beds where they are laid on bamboo poles. Here the spats continue to grow, relatively free from seabed predators. The large number of <b>spats</b> that <b>fall</b> off during transport are seeded on the substrate {{at the rate of}} 15,000 to 30,000 per square metre. Predation and other causes of mortality reduce these to 5,500 to 6,000 per square metre in 6 months. When the juveniles have grown to about 10 mm long they are moved to beds reserved for adults, from whence they are harvested a year later.|$|R
40|$|Early stage {{development}} of pearl oyster spat was very critical, hence spat required suitable substrates for their settlement {{to complete their}} metamorphosis. In this stage, byssus for the attachment is vulnerable and easy to break if there are some disturbance e. g. water movement, hence <b>spat</b> easily <b>falling</b> onto the bottom layer which may have various dirt materials leading to the dead of the spat. In the pearl oyster culture spat collector is important. The {{aim of this study}} is to study the effect of different collector materials to the number of spat settled, to reveal the best collector materials and the endurance of spat at the collector. This study was conducted in PT Autore Pearl Culture, at Sumbawa island, Nusa Tenggara Province. Materials used in this research were collectors of different substance i. e. asbestos (A), bamboo (B), polyethylene and roof ceramic (D) substance. The method used was laboratories experiment with Completely Random Design by 4 treatments and 3 replications. Data taken were the number of spat settlement, endurance test, and water quality. Data tested with Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and further tested with Duncan Duplicate Regional test. Water quality was analyzed descriptively. The results showed that different collector materials performed a high significantly difference (p< 0. 01) to the number of spat settled. The best settlement reached by polyethylene [106 ± 3. 61 ind.

40|$|Off bottom {{oyster culture}} is clearly {{superior}} to any bottom oed techniques, however it sufferes from {{the lack of}} a satisfactory cultch material. The recent practice by a large scale commercial Dyster aquafarm of using hand punched scallop shells strung on a 1 / 8 " nylon cord has resulted in estimated losses of 25 - 30 % due to 3 hell fracture and cord breakage. Drilling was investigated as a possible means of increasing useful shell processing and decreasing post-stringing losses. Based on laboratory experiments, a 1 / 8 " steel drill bit operated at 1328 rpm was found to be more efficient than either 1 / 4 " or 7 / 8 " drill bits operated at any speed. A net processing time of 20 shells per ninute with a processing loss of 6. 3 % was possible using the 1 / 8 " bit and drilling the shells one at a time. Group processing was considered, increasing successful output to 25. 7 shells per minute with a processing loss of 18. 9 %. A polypropylene-crushed scallop shell composite was also con-sidered as a possible cultch and tests were made for abrasion and <b>spat</b> <b>fall</b> attraction. Abrasion was found to be of little importance, <b>Spat</b> <b>fall</b> was concluded to be a function of time after molding and surface texture.

40|$|Este artículo contiene 11 páginas, 3 tablas, 3 figuras. Ascidians are {{important}} both as invasive species {{and as a}} fouling group in artificial marine habitats, causing negative impacts in aquaculture settings and the surrounding environment. The Ebro Delta {{is one of the}} major centres of bivalve production in the Mediterranean and is affected by proliferation of ascidian species (mostly introduced forms). Knowledge of the patterns of settlement and growth of the fouling species is mandatory to attempt mitigation measures. Settlement PVC plates were deployed from May to September 2015 at different depths (0. 2, 1 and 2 m) in the Ebro Delta oyster aquaculture facilities. The occurrences of all species and the area cover of a selected subset of 6 species were monitored on a monthly basis from June 2015 to December 2016. Fifteen species were found, of which 10 are introduced. There were some differences between the deployed plates and the oyster ropes in species abundance and composition, likely due to differences in substrate complexity. For instance, Didemnum vexillum and Clavelina oblonga occurred in few plates in contrast to their abundance on oysters. The most abundant species were Styela plicata and Clavelina lepadiformis, which together with Ecteinascidia turbinata showed a preference to grow on plates deployed in May and June. Most of the species grew more at 0. 2 mdepth than at deeper plates. Thus, to minimise fouling on bivalves, <b>spat</b> immersion during <b>fall</b> and below 1 mdepth is recommended. The number of occurrences and cover of the species was found to be similarly informative; suggesting that a periodic monitoring of species occurrence on replicate plates is sufficient for detecting new introduced species as soon as possible and will provide information useful for management.

40|$|Determining age is an {{important}} step when assessing growth, mortality, and yield of cultivated and wild populations, but studies linking shell growth marks in the pearl oyster Pteria sterna with the age of individuals are lacking. Thirty juveniles (20. 0 ± 1. 2 mm shell height), collected from a winter <b>spat</b> <b>fall,</b> were marked with the fluorochrome calcein and kept in the field in culture containers. After day 16, the juveniles were cleaned and their shells cut along the sagittal axis to determine periodicity of micro growth bands formed in the inner shell layers and to estimate age. During this trial, fluorescent calcein marking succeeded in individuals larger than 20 mm shell height; these formed an average of 15 micro growth bands over the 16 days, representing 1 band per day. The marker created a wide fluorescent band containing three micro growth marks, suggesting that calcein was incorporated into the shell over the first three days.

There is great prospects for brown mussel (Perna indica) mariculture and therefore the natural spat collection {{as a source of}} seed for culture gains importance.

40|$|Production of mussel seed {{requires}} priority {{attention for}} the expansion of mussel culture as an industry in India. Procurement 	 of adequate seed from the wild beds even for the current experimental programmes is faced with problems. Two lines of approach 	 have been suggested for enhancing seed production.

40|$|Problems in the Belgian {{fisheries}} sector due to low fish prices, {{limitations in}} landings and high fuel costs, are {{putting pressure on}} the fishermen to look for other and more sustainable production methods, {{with the emphasis on}} diversification. Aquaculture might be a solution for at least a part of the problems. However, the short Belgian coastline is already used intensively for recreation, nature conservation and harbour activities, making coastal aquaculture almost impossible. Recent developments in offshore or open-ocean shellfish culture were a challenge to start aquaculture in the rough North Sea. Culture experiments with blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) started in 1998 at the ropes and grown over a period of 14 months to marketable size mussels. Preliminary experiments show that mussels metal, and parasite (Buck et al., 2005) loads than their inshore relatives, which leads to a fast growth and a healthy product. The different shellfish production areas show differences in <b>spat</b> <b>fall</b> and growth, which indicates that a feasibility study is needed to determine the productivity and specific use of the different areas. The rough North Sea with its erratic waves and strong winds makes it hard to harvest these off-shore mussel cultures.

40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} shows that spatial interactions between sedentary organisms can structure communities and promote landscape complexity in many ecosystems. Here we tested the hypothesis that reef-forming mussels (Mytilus edulis L.), a dominant intertidal ecosystem engineer in the Wadden Sea, promote abundances of the burrowing bivalve Cerastoderma edule L. (cockle) in neighboring habitats at relatively long distances coastward from mussel beds. Field surveys within and around three mussel beds showed a peak in cockle densities at 50 - 100 m toward the coast from the mussel bed, while cockle abundances elsewhere {{in the study area}} were very low. Field transplantation of cockles showed higher survival of young cockles (2 - 3 years old) and increased <b>spat</b> <b>fall</b> coastward of the mussel bed compared to within the bed and to areas without mussels, whereas growth decreased within and coastward of the mussel bed. Our measurements suggest that the observed spatial patterns in cockle numbers resulted from (1) inhibition effects by the mussels close to the beds due to preemptive algal depletion and deteriorated sediment conditions and (2) facilitation effects by the mussels farther away from the beds due to reduction of wave energy. Our results imply that these spatial, scale-dependent interactions between reef-forming ecosystem engineers and surrounding communities of sedentary benthic organisms can be an important determinant of the large-scale community structure in intertidal ecosystems. Understanding this interplay between neighboring communities of sedentary species is therefore essential for effective conservation and restoration of soft-bottom intertidal communities. ...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{interest}} in periculture in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, encouraged {{an assessment of}} the changes in the reproductive condition of pearl oyster, Pinctada albina sugillata. Over a 2 -year period, macroscopic and histological observations were made of oysters collected monthly from Port Stephens. In contrast to more northerly populations, P. albina sugillata in NSW were found to have a truncated breeding season. Reproductive activity was greatest from late spring to early autumn with oysters in poor reproductive condition during winter. Peaks in reproductive indices occurred in October 1998, March 1999, January 2000 and April 2000. Spat collectors deployed at two sites in Port Stephens found <b>spat</b> <b>fall</b> to be restricted to the months of November-January, indicating that the autumnal peaks (March and April) in the reproductive activity did not result in subsequent recruitment. These results supported previous observations of latitudinal change in the reproductive behavior of pearl oysters in which populations at higher latitudes have truncated breeding seasons that tend to occur during the warmer months. Recruitment to spat collectors was low and variable, discouraging the collection of wild spat for culture, yet the spring increase in reproductive activity was coincident with the likely time for hatchery propagation. Infestations of shell-boring organisms were found among wild oysters although the degree of shell damage was almost invariably low. Most common were infestations of spionid polychaetes, present in 30 % of the shells collected, with several larger oysters showing shell damage typical of boring sponges. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) {{were first}} {{observed}} in the Dutch Wadden Sea near Texel in 1983. The population increased slowly in the beginning but grew exponentially from the mid- 1990 s onwards, although now some stabilisation seems to be occurring. They occur {{on a variety of}} substrates such as mussel beds (Mytilus edulis), shell banks, dikes and poles. After initial settlement spat may fall on older individuals and congregate to dense clumps and subsequently form reefs. Individual Pacific oysters grow 3 – 4 cm long in their first year and 2 – 3 cm in their second year. Many mussel beds (Mytilus edulis) are slowly taken over by Pacific oysters, but there are also several reports of mussel spat settling on Pacific oyster reefs. This might in the end result in combined reefs. Successful Pacific oyster <b>spat</b> <b>fall</b> seems to be related to high summer temperatures, but also after mild summers much spat can be found on old (Pacific oyster) shells. Predation is of limited importance. Mortality factors are unknown, but every now and then unexplained mass mortality occurs. The gradual spread of the Pacific oyster in the Dutch Wadden Sea is documented in the first instance based on historical and anecdotal information. At the start of the more in-depth investigation in 2002, Pacific oysters of all size classes were already present near Texel.

The fishery {{is controlled by}} Devon Sea Fisheries Byelaw 23 (1998) stating scallop fishers may only dredge in an 'enabled' box within the harbour. Recently fishers have requested they be allowed to dredge 'The Bag' area as well. This report investigates the possible impacts to 'The Bag' if proposed dredging occurred. Spat collecting bags deployed into 'The Bag' during May 2006 didn't accumulate any Pecten maximus spat, this {{could be attributed to}} poor <b>spat</b> <b>fall</b> or incorrect settlement surfaces. As no spat were found it seems imperative to establish population dynamics in the estuary prior to any dredging action occurring. The majority of benthic habitats surveyed in the area were 3 D in nature supporting epifaunal species and seaweed communities. Communities of this nature provide good settlement substratum for scallop spat which prefer silt free surfaces above the sea bed. Habitats would be damaged by the effects of dredging e. g. substratum loss, smothering, increase in turbidity, abrasion and physical disturbance taking 5 - 10 years to recover fully. Diving surveys in August 2006 suggest the southern end of 'The Bag' which is closed to dredging, {{supports a}}n aggregated viable breeding population of adult Pecten maximus, which may be responsible for the sustainability of the scallop population present in the estuary. Crepidula fomicata populations surveyed were highest in shallower waters at the top of 'The Bag' area, and less were found where Pecten maximus was abundant. Previous literature indicates that removal of Crepidula fomicata by dredging does little to stop spread or decrease populations in the long term. Further temporal research needs to establish where Pecten maximus juveniles and spat are and whether the closely aggregated population in the southern 'Bag' area does sustain the estuaries Pecten maximus population.

40|$|Impact of hydrodynamics and {{seagrass}} habitat {{structure on}} the suspension feeder Cerastoderma eduleThe edible cockle Cerastoderma edule, {{one of the}} most common suspension feeder on the tidal flats along the European Atlantic Coast, shows large annual as well as site specific fluctuations in the survival and growth of juvenile and adult cockles. Amongst the main factors that may induce these variations are abnormal climatic conditions, predation by crustaceans and fish, intraspecific competition, and <b>spat</b> <b>fall</b> transport by near bottom flow. However, little attention has been paid to the effect of hydrodynamic exposure and habitat structures, as well as the interaction of these factors which may influencing the cockle population structure. The effect of different hydrodynamic exposure and seagrass habitat structure on the abundance, biomass and growth of C. edule was investigated in intertidal Zostera noltii beds and adjacent sand flats in the Wadden Sea, near the island of Sylt. Regardless of the seagrass density and hydrodynamic exposure, the abundance and biomass of cockles were generally higher inside the seagrass beds in comparison to the adjacent sand flats. However, transplantation of cockles of equal size into sheltered and exposed seagrass beds and sand flats resulted in lower growth rates of individuals in the seagrass beds. Furthermore, shell lengths and body weights of C. edule were distinctly higher in exposed than in sheltered seagrass beds, where individuals seemed to have starved. Highest growth rates were measured in areas with highest current velocities. Experiments carried out with an in situ three-currents-flume, which modifies tidal current velocities within the same seagrass site, showed an increase in cockle shell length and body weight at mean current velocities between 4 and 8 cm s- 1. Corresponding measurements of seston content and the percentage of POC and PON within the water column of the different flume lanes revealed highest seston values in lanes with the lowest current velocities. In contrast, values of the percentage of POC and PON increased with increasing current speeds. Thus it is concluded that seagrass vegetation positively effects the abundance of cockles, whereas the growth and condition of C. edule is controlled by current velocities, promoting the quality of food for C. edule at higher current velocities...|$|E
40|$|Metawad is {{a five-year}} {{research}} project funded by Waddenfonds {{that started in}} 2011. One of its aims is to investigate how population changes of migrating shorebirds are driven by changes in the conditions in their main feeding habitat, intertidal mudflats. We investigate how differences in survival may be preceded by differences in behavioural indicators related to foraging, which in turn may be driven by factors like food, forager density and distribution, and predation danger. Metawad focuses on five long-distance migrant species differing in feeding habits and migration routines: Brent Goose Branta bernida, Eurasian Spoonbill Platalea leucorodia, Bar-tailed Godwit Limosa lapponica, Red Knot Calidris canutus and Sander-ling Calidris alba. To put the data on these target species in a wider context, we started off by mapping the low tide distribution of a wider array of shorebird species in the Dutch Wadden Sea, with the aim to link this (at a later stage) to available food stocks, which are monitored throughout the Dutch Wadden Sea (Fig. 1). Here {{we focus on the}} eight most numerous species: Curlew Numenius arquata, Oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus, Bar-tailed Godwit, Grey Plover Pluvialis squatarola, Red Knot, Redshank Tringa totanus, Sanderling and Dunlin Calidris alpina. The eastern parts of the Wad-den Sea supported the lowest densities of all species except Grey Plover and Dunlin (Fig. 2). Overall, Dunlin was most abundant, followed by Red Knot and Oystercatcher (Fig. 3). Packing densities, however, were highest in Red Knot, followed closely by Dunlin, and then by Sanderling, Oystercatcher and Bar-tailed Godwit (Fig. 3). It is discussed why in Red Knots and Dunlin packing densities were much higher than in a similar study on low tide distribution mapping (but from another year), and than densities estimated from high tide counts (also from another year). For instance, the high packing densities in our study may be related to a substantial <b>spat</b> <b>fall</b> of Cockle Cerastoderma edule in 2011. In further steps we will examine the relationships between the distributions of birds and their food stocks. Assuming that birds optimize their behaviour, for the best studied bird species, individual characteristics like body weight, gizzard size, and activity pattern, can serve as predictors of their distribution. We aim to link these features to survival of marked birds in order to better understand the complex relationship between population dynamics of shorebirds and the state of the habitats they live in...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} this work are a {{contribution}} {{to the understanding of the}} influence of dramatic natural variations of the physico-chemical environment in coral reef areas caused by Large Amplitude Internal Waves (LAIW). LAIW are a worldwide oceanographic phenomenon generated in areas with a rich underwater topography, strong density stratification and tidal currents. They deliver sub-thermocline water upslope into shallow shelf regions but their possible biological impact especially on benthic communities and ecosystems such as coral reefs is so far largely unknown. In this work the impact of LAIW on coral reefs was investigated at the Similan Island chain in the Andaman Sea. The unusual coral reef distribution with reefs flourishing only on the sheltered eastern island sides and no true reef framework in the west was shown to be consistent among the islands and related to LAIW. Temperature records revealed that LAIW have their strongest impact on deeper west slopes where they cause frequent and abrupt drops in temperature with peak activity during the north-east monsoon (January through April). LAIW advect deep cold, nutrient rich, suboxic and low-pH waters coming with strong currents into shallow near shore areas. In contrast to low numbers of frame-building species in east, the west slopes harbour loose yet more divers communities of scattered corals. This might be due to the alternating impact of south-west monsoon (May to October) and LAIW from above and below maintaining the coral community in a non-equilibrium state of intermediate disturbances which enhances species diversity. Coral growth of and bioerosion on Porites lutea revealed both, lowest rates at the site of highest LAIW-impact in west deep areas and highest rates within the dense coral reef of the sheltered east shallow. A calculated carbonate budget confirmed that carbonate accretion by reduced coral growth and carbonate erosion by alike reduced grazing and boring organisms are balanced but only barely positive under highly variable LAIW conditions in west deep. Coral recruitment on natural reef substrate revealed significantly higher abundances in shallow west than in east. However with increasing exposure period of experimental settlement tiles, the proportion of juvenile corals increased in east but decreased in west, indicating a failure of recruits to establish permanently on the LAIW-exposed sides in spite of the higher initial <b>spat</b> <b>fall.</b> Early stages of settlement and growth seemed to occur independently of LAIW exposure while the subsequent establishment of juvenile corals appeared to be related to LAIW intensity, reflecting the lack of true reefs on the LAIW-exposed west sides of the islands...|$|E
40|$|The Dutch {{mussel farming}} {{industry}} {{is based on}} the use of young mussels fished from naturally occurring mussel beds as raw material. The Wadden Sea is a designated protected area, and therefore the uptake of this mussel spat needs a permit under the Nature Conservation Act. In order to assess whether the natural values of the area will be affected by the fishery, insight is needed into the effects of mussel fishery on the nature in the Wadden Sea, and more particularly for the conservation objectives set out in the framework of Natura 2000 for the Wadden Sea. Therefore the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Producer Organisation of Dutch mussel survey initiated the research project ‘PRODUS’ in 2006. Part of PRODUS is a comparative study at 40 sites with paired, adjacent research plots of 4 ha each, one of which was open to fishing the other completely closed to fishing. The sites were positioned in newly developed mussel spat beds. These study sites could not all be established at the same time because there needed to be enough new spat in each area, which depends on natural <b>spat</b> <b>fall,</b> and this varies significantly from year to year. In 2006 the sampling started in 10 sites, then the number of sites increased each year from 2010 to eventually include 40 sites. Mussels are generally fished twice a year; in the autumn on the newly formed spat beds, particularly in beds that are relatively unstable and therefore have a greater chance of disappearing in winter; and a second time following the spring, in the remaining beds in the more stable areas. In the study, the effects of the autumn and the spring fishery were analyzed separately. Parallel to the research in open and closed plots was a Wadden Sea wide survey conducted in 2008 in which the benthic composition in the sublittoral areas of Wadden Sea was determined. In the period 2008 - 2010 a comparison was also made of the benthic composition and environmental characteristics of wild mussel beds and cultured mussel plots. Furthermore, in 2009 and 2010 some of the larger mussel beds were permanently closed to fishing, and a study was conducted to investigate what the consequences for these mussel beds were. The present report deals with the development of the mussel stock in each of the sites, in the mussel beds that were closed in 2009 and 2010 and their backgrounds in relation to fishing...|$|E
40|$|The horse-mussel, Modiola {{modiolus}} (L.) is a bivalved mollusk dosely {{related to}} the sea mussel, Mytilus edulis L. and common in northern waters. In Norway there are considerable beds of this mussel along the western and northern coasts, from just below the littoral region to about 80 meters of depth. The horse-mussel plays an important part as bait in the set-line fisheries, especially in the Lofoten "skrei"- fisheries. As some of the mussel beds have been exhausted, and others {{are in danger of}} being depleted, investigations have been initiated by the Fisheries Directorate of Norway in order to study the biology of the horse-mussel, especially the growth and propagation of the mussel and the renewal of the beds. In some places the horse-mussel together with other organisms form a special community, the Modiola modiolus community, which is described more closely. The food of the horse-mussel consists of plankton, mainly small phytoplankton forms and protozoa, and detritus, the latter playing an important part. The chief enemies of the horse-mussel are the starfishes Asterias rubens and A. glacialis. Other enemies are some sea-urchins, the whelk, dog whelk, the crab Cancer pagurus, the cat fish and the eider duck. Seaweed (Laminaria digitata) sometimes smother the mussels and heavy sea may sweep them up on the shore. In individuals from shallow water the siphones and mantle edges are sometimes coloured green by a small, globular flagellate of a species not yet determined. The sexes are separate, hermaphrodites occurring in 2 - 8 ‰ of the individuals. The proportion of males to females is usually 1 : 1, but on some occasions more males than females are found among the smaller individuals and more females among the larger ones. The horse-mussel reaches maturity from the 3. to the 8. year of life, the majority at an age of 5 to 6 years. The genital tissue has the same arrangement as in the sea mussel except the mantle lobes, which are thin and membranlike, similar to those of young sea mussels. The genital tissue of male and female is described. A female mussel of 110 mm length will yield about 20 millions of eggs. Spawning usually takes place in March-April and may be accomplished within one day. All mussels in a bed will usually spawn at the same time. Most often there will be an interval of two or more years between each spawning. Larval development is supposed to be accomplished within a month. The <b>spat</b> <b>fall</b> is small compared with that of the sea mussel. The growth has been investigated both experimentally and on the base of the growth rings. These have proved to be annual rings except in a few cases, when secondary rings are formed. These are, however, easily distinguished from the annual rings. Growth is comparatively rapid from July to October-November, when it slows down, and almost entirely ceases between December and April, in which period the winter rings are formed. In May-June the growth is resumed. The most rapid growth is usually shown by the smaller individuals up to 55 millimeters of length (about 8 years of age) Which have an average annual growth of 6 - 10 mm. The maximum growth found experimentally was 15 mm. After the 10. year growth slackens, and in individuals 14 years old or more the growth scarcely exceeds 2 - 4 mm a year. In the localities examined individuals 10 years old on an average measured 65 - 79 mm, 18 years old 98 - 118 mm. The best growth was recorded from mussels living at a depth of 6 - 15 meters in fjords and sounds with strong water movement and frequent renewal of the water layers. The horse-mussels commonly used as bait measure from 80 to 140 mm of length and are from 10 to 20 years old. The normal length of life is estimated to be about 23 years, but individuals have been found up to an age of 36 years. The age composition of the stocks of mussels is very varying in different localities, the percentage of younger specimens sometimes being very small. The proportions of the horse-mussel are discussed. Between length and height there is the following relation: H = L/(a+bL) where a and b are constants. Between breadth and length the relation is B = cL, c being a constant. The outer volume can be calculated from the formula V = L. B. H. d or V = L³cd/(a+bL) or approximately V = L³k. For values of the constants a, b, c, d, and k see page 43 and 48. Mussels of good quality yield 1 / 6 - 1 / 10 of the total volume as salted meat. Analysis of weight and chemical composition have been undertaken. Different tools for collecting horse-mussels are described. In preparation for bait the meat is removed from the shells and salted in casks of 30 liters. Commonly 600 - 800 nmssels will yield one cask. The horse-mussels are used as bait in the set-line fisheries mainly in the Lofoten area ("skrei"-fisheries) but also in other coastal set-line fisheries. The method of preserving the meat with salt was first employed commercially in 1883. Commercial fishing on a bigger scale for horse-mussels at first took place in the fjords and streams near Bergen on the west coast of Norway (1883) but soon spread to other localities. The counties which yield most part of the horse-mussels are Hordaland on the west coast and Trøndelag and Nordland {{in the northern part of}} Norway. The total catch in the years 1914 - 1943 varied from 678 to 5 876 hundreds of liters (salted mussels), the economic value of the catches from 73 000 to 440 000 kroner. The protection and possible cultivation of the horse-mussel beds are discussed. No laws of protection have as yet been enacted. Cultivation of the horse-mussel will probably be difficult on account of the tardy growth and small power of regeneration...|$|E
