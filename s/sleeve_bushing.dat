5000|$|A bushing, {{also known}} as a bush, is an {{independent}} plain bearing that is inserted into a housing to provide a bearing surface for rotary applications; this is {{the most common form of}} a plain bearing. Common designs include solid (sleeve and flanged), split, and clenched bushings. A sleeve, split, or clenched bushing is only a [...] "sleeve" [...] of material with an inner diameter (ID), outer diameter (OD), and length. The difference between the three types is that a solid sleeved bushing is solid all the way around, a split bushing has a cut along its length, and a clenched bearing is similar to a split bushing but with a [...] (or [...] ) across the cut. A flanged bushing is a <b>sleeve</b> <b>bushing</b> with a flange at one end extending radially outward from the OD. The flange is used to positively locate the bushing when it is installed or to provide a thrust bearing surface.|$|E
40|$|Rounded {{shoulder}} on bushing ensures repeatable stop position. Improved {{stop mechanism}} allows airflow slot on circulation-control airfoil {{to be limited}} to precise width. Shoulder bushing installed in duct so shoulder rests on inside surface of duct. Bolt slides in bushing in duct wall between more open and less open positions. No relative motion or wear between bolt and slot panel. Prevents bushing from being dislodged by stop forces and provides stiffer stopping surface than <b>sleeve</b> <b>bushing</b> bonded in duct wall...|$|E
50|$|In plain bearings, {{the shaft}} is usually {{in contact with}} a <b>bushing</b> (<b>sleeve</b> or flanged) to reduce friction. When the {{rotation}} is slow and the load is radial, the model of uniform pressure can be used (small deformations and clearance).|$|R
5000|$|The songwriter/guitarist Shark from Wild Colonials and Dead Rock West singer Cindy Wasserman {{released}} {{the song in}} 2008. The proceeds of the record going to the charities Farm Aid and the Red Cross, to help the farmers affected by the floods of 2008. The sleeve design is an homage to the original Peter Gabriel / Kate <b>Bush</b> <b>sleeve</b> with similar typography.|$|R
50|$|The {{principle}} {{parts of}} a MORGOIL Bearing are relatively uncomplicated. The Sleeve is an alloy steel forging, heat-treated and ground to a fine finish. The Sleeve has a precision non-locking tapered bore, which fits on, and is keyed to, the tapered Roll Neck, thus becoming the bearing journal. Surrounding the <b>Sleeve</b> is the <b>Bushing,</b> fixed in the Chock, which carries the radial load. The precision Sleeve rotating in the bushing on an unbroken film of oil provides a Bearing with a low coefficient of friction, low power consumption, high load capacity, high stiffness, and freedom from wear and fatigue. Adjacent to the outbound end of the sleeve is the Thrust Bearing, which is typically a double acting roller (or ball bearing in some applications {{depending on the size}} of the radial bearing). The Thrust Bearing is mounted in such a manner that it only carries the thrust load and is not subject to any radial loading.|$|R
50|$|The {{roller chain}} design reduces {{friction}} compared to simpler designs, resulting in higher efficiency and less wear. The original power transmission chain varieties lacked rollers and bushings, {{with both the}} inner and outer plates held by pins which directly contacted the sprocket teeth; however this configuration exhibited extremely rapid wear of both the sprocket teeth, and the plates where they pivoted on the pins. This problem was partially solved by the development of bushed chains, with the pins holding the outer plates passing through bushings or sleeves connecting the inner plates. This distributed the wear over a greater area; however the teeth of the sprockets still wore more rapidly than is desirable, from the sliding friction against the bushings. The addition of rollers surrounding the <b>bushing</b> <b>sleeves</b> of the chain and provided rolling contact with the teeth of the sprockets resulting in excellent resistance to wear of both sprockets and chain as well. There is even very low friction, as long as the chain is sufficiently lubricated. Continuous, clean, lubrication of roller chains is of primary importance for efficient operation as well as correct tensioning.|$|R
5000|$|Wheels {{sometimes}} need replacing. The grinder is unplugged, {{and then}} the outer guard is removed. Typically a large nut holds the wheel on the arbor. The handedness (sense) of each nut is assigned to avoid any loosening tendency during grinder use. Thus on a typical grinder the nut is left-handed {{on the left side}} of the grinder from the operator's viewpoint, with wheel rotation [...] "toward" [...] the operator (if the wheel could travel), whereas on the other side the nut is right-handed. [...] "In other words, to remove the nut, it must be turned in the direction that the spindle revolves when the wheel is in operation." [...] Holding the wheel against the wrench's turning action is difficult, but usually the wrench is gently tapped with a hammer instead, which neatly taps the nut loose. A large steel flange is on either side of the wheel, then a paper washer (blotter), then the wheel. The paper is conventionally held to be absolutely necessary to prevent the steel flange from bearing directly against the wheel and tending to crack it; trained workers are expected to know and obey this rule. Thus the entire contact area between flange and wheel is covered, either with paper or with compressible coating (rubber or gasket) on the flange. The wheel's inner diameter may meet the arbor precisely or may be larger with a <b>bushing</b> (<b>sleeve)</b> to reduce it. Before the new wheel is mounted it is ring tested, which involves gently tapping it with a fingernail or tool handle (wood or plastic) to hear its high-pitched ring (comparable to a bell's ring, although not loud), indicating that it is not cracked. It is rung in various spots to be sure. A [...] "flat" [...] or [...] "hoarse" [...] sound (failing to [...] "sing") indicates a crack. With the wheel having passed the ring test, the bushing (if any), wheel, paper blotters, steel flanges, and nut are assembled, and the nut is tightened, not as hard as possible, but enough to be firmly fastened in place. The guard is reinstalled, {{and then the}} grinder can be plugged in again. Dressing may be needed afterward. When the wheel is first started, the operator stands a bit off center, so that if it were to explode, less pathway for injury exists.|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} {{continuous}} galvanizing of rolled sheet steel includes immersion into a bath of molten zinc/aluminum alloy. The steel strip is dipped in the molten bath {{through a series}} of driving motors and rollers which control the speed and tension of the strip, with the ability to modify both the amount of coating applied to the steel as well as the thickness and width of the sheet being galvanized. There are three rolls used to guide the steel strip through the molten metal bath. The rolls that operate in the molten Zn/Al are subject to a severely corrosive environment and require frequent changing. The performance of this equipment, the metallic hardware submerged in the molten Zn/Al bath, is the focus of this research. The primary objective of this research is to extend the performance life of the metallic hardware components of molten Zn/Al pot hardware by an order of magnitude. Typical galvanizing operations experience downtimes on the order of every two weeks to change the metallic hardware submerged in the molten metal bath. This is an expensive process for industry which takes upwards of 3 days for a complete turn around to resume normal operation. Each roll bridle consists of a sink, stabilizer, and corrector roll with accompanying bearing components. The cost of the bridle rig with all components is as much as $ 25, 000 dollars just for materials. These inefficiencies are of concern to the steel coating companies and serve as a potential market for many materials suppliers. This research effort served as a bridge between the market potential and industry need to provide an objective analytical and mechanistic approach to the problem of wear and corrosion of molten metal bath hardware in a continuous sheet galvanizing line. The approach of the investigators was to provide a means of testing and analysis that was both expeditious and cost effective. The consortium of researchers from West Virginia University and Oak Ridge National Laboratory developed several test apparatuses that were designed to work in concert so that the process of developing and evaluating new materials and material combinations could be carried out in the most effective manner. ORNL focused on the long-term effects of static and dynamic corrosion on the hardware. Their efforts have yielded corrosion data in terms of mass loss for a large database of materials for immersion times in excess of 6000 hours. In addition, they have developed a new series of alloy, designated ORNL Alloy 4 -x. Several variants of Alloy 4 were tested for corrosion and wear performance. Another effective method for protecting bearing components is through the use of weld overlays or laser cladding. ORNL worked with several project partners to develop a weld overlay process for cladding of 316 L stainless steel with metallic materials that are much more corrosion and wear resistant. This method provides super-alloy performance that is more affordable. WVU was tasked to study wear of the bearing materials along with mechanisms of dross buildup on the roll surface. A small scale screening test apparatus was developed for the purpose quickly evaluating wear performance of candidate superalloys, ceramics, and coatings {{through the use of a}} ball-and-seat testing combination. This combination uses a fraction of the material used in full-scale bearing applications. With this system, WVU has been able to conduct hundreds of tests on various combinations of materials that mimic a wide variety of operating conditions for the galvanizing lines. The small scale wear tester was used to perform both direct correlation to galvanizing line conditions and to act as a screening mechanism for prototype-scale testing at WVU?s airport bearing materials testing facility. In addition, the studies on the effect of contact pressure and velocity on the bearing wear rate lead to the design and subsequent patent application for a fixed-shaft roll design that has the potential for increasing the bearing life by a factor of 2. The prototype-scale bearing test apparatus was donated by one of our project partners and was relocated to the WVU airport hanger at Morgantown Municipal Airport. This test apparatus uses full-scale <b>sleeve</b> and <b>bushing</b> dimensions and is designed to more accurately mimic the galvanizing line conditions. Through the combination of corrosion, wear, and dross buildup testing, as well as material modeling and thermodynamic analysis, the research team has been able to show that an order of magnitude improvement in material performance is a realistic goal...|$|R
