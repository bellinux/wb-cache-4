5|$|The {{cattle egret}} was first {{described}} in 1758 by Linnaeus in his Systema naturae as Ardea ibis, but {{was moved to}} its current genus by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1855. Its genus name Bubulcus is Latin for herdsman, referring, like the English name, to this species' association with cattle. Ibis is a Latin and Greek word which originally referred to another white wading bird, the <b>sacred</b> <b>ibis,</b> but was applied to this species in error.|$|E

In India, the peacock is perceived as Mother Earth among Dravidian peoples, while the Mughal and Persian emperors displayed their godlike authority by sitting in a Peacock Throne. In the Yazidi religion, Melek Taus the [...] "Peacock Angel" [...] is the central figure of their faith. In the cult of Makemake, the Tangata manu birds of Easter Island served as chiefs.|$|E

There was {{likewise}} the <b>sacred</b> <b>ibis</b> of Egypt, {{and one of}} the Stymphalides which Hercules shot in his sixth labor. Shelley's skylark, Bryant's water-fowl, and a pigeon from the belfry of the Old South Church, preserved by N. P. Willis, were placed on the same perch. I could not but shudder on beholding Coleridge's albatross, transfixed with the Ancient Mariner's crossbow shaft. Beside this bird of awful poesy stood a gray goose of very ordinary aspect.|$|E
6000|$|Then arose a {{voice like}} a wind on the desert,--but really from the {{direction}} of the Nile, where a hired dahabiyeh lay moored to the bank,--"'Arry Axes! 'Arry Axes!" [...] With it came also a flapping, trailing vision from the water--the <b>sacred</b> <b>Ibis</b> itself--and with wings aslant drifted mournfully away to its own creaking echo: [...] "K'raksis! K'raksis!" [...] Again arose the weird voice: [...] "'Arry Axes! Wotcher doin' of?" [...] And again the Ibis croaked its wild refrain: [...] "K'raksis! K'raksis!" [...] Moonlight and the hour wove their own mystery (for which the author is not responsible), and the voice was heard no more. But when the full day sprang in glory over the desert, it illuminated the few remaining but sufficiently large features of the Sphinx with a burning saffron radiance! The Sphinx had indeed blushed! ...|$|E
5000|$|The Malagasy <b>sacred</b> <b>ibis</b> was {{formerly}} considered a subspecies of the African <b>sacred</b> <b>ibis.</b> It is now however {{classified as a}} separate species from the African <b>sacred</b> <b>ibis</b> due to considerable differences observed in the former’s ecology and morphology. [...] It is hypothesized that the Malagasy <b>sacred</b> <b>ibis</b> evolved from the African <b>sacred</b> <b>ibis</b> when the latter supposedly spread to and colonized Madagascar from mainland Africa.|$|E
50|$|The Réunion ibis or Réunion <b>sacred</b> <b>ibis</b> (Threskiornis solitarius) is an {{extinct species}} of ibis that was endemic to the {{volcanic}} island of Réunion in the Indian Ocean. The first subfossil remains {{were found in}} 1974, and the ibis was first scientifically described in 1987. Its closest relatives are the Malagasy <b>sacred</b> <b>ibis,</b> the African <b>sacred</b> <b>ibis,</b> and the straw-necked ibis.|$|E
50|$|This ibis is morphologically {{similar to}} the African <b>sacred</b> <b>ibis,</b> but is {{slightly}} smaller, more slender-billed, lacks the black trailing edge to the wings, has bluish-slate tertials (purplish-slate in the African <b>sacred</b> <b>ibis),</b> differently structured ornamental neck sacs, less developed ornamental plumes and a different display. Unlike the African <b>sacred</b> <b>ibis,</b> there is also little or no black on the wing tips and duller display plumes from the innermost secondaries.|$|E

50|$|In 1995, {{morphological}} study {{suggested the}} closest extant {{relatives of the}} Réunion ibis are the African <b>sacred</b> <b>ibis</b> (T. aethiopicus) of Africa and the straw-necked ibis (T. spinicollis) of Australia. It has also been suggested that it was closest to the Malagasy <b>sacred</b> <b>ibis</b> (T. bernieri), and therefore of ultimately African origin.|$|E

50|$|A {{wading bird}} of the ibis family, Threskiornithidae, the <b>sacred</b> <b>ibis</b> breeds in Sub-Saharan Africa, southeastern Iraq, and {{formerly}} in Egypt, {{where it was}} venerated and often mummified {{as a symbol of}} the god Thoth. The African <b>sacred</b> <b>ibis</b> occurs in marshy wetlands and mud flats, both inland and on the coast. It will also visit cultivation and rubbish dumps.|$|E
50|$|It is {{generally}} non-vocal, {{but the voice}} is probably {{similar to that of}} the African <b>Sacred</b> <b>Ibis.</b>|$|E

50|$|Both the bernieri and abbotti race have a {{light blue}} or white iris, {{both of which}} differ {{markedly}} from the brown iris of the African <b>sacred</b> <b>ibis.</b> The abbotti race also has a black wing stripe. Although this ibis {{is unlikely to be}} confused with other species in the field, it may sometimes be mistaken for the African <b>sacred</b> <b>ibis</b> which may occasionally visit Madagascar as a vagrant.|$|E

50|$|The Australian white ibis (Threskiornis molucca) is a {{wading bird}} of the ibis family, Threskiornithidae. It is {{widespread}} {{across much of}} Australia. It has a predominantly white plumage with a bare, black head, long downcurved bill and black legs. Its sister species is the <b>sacred</b> <b>ibis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Herodotus {{wrote of}} the man-eating Stymphalian birds, which had wings of brass and sharp {{metallic}} feathers they could fire at their victims. Ridding Lake Stymphalia in Arcadia of these creatures {{was one of the}} twelve labours of Heracles. These mythical birds are sometimes considered {{to be based on the}} northern bald ibis, but since they were described as marsh birds, and usually depicted without crests, the legendary species is more likely to be derived from the <b>sacred</b> <b>ibis.</b> Some depictions, such as the 6th-century BC Athenian black-figure amphora in the British Museum, clearly show the black head and white body of the <b>sacred</b> <b>ibis.</b> After the bald ibis became extinct in Central Europe, some later writers thought that Gesner's description was one of several in his book depicting mythical creatures.|$|E

50|$|The Snowdon Aviary was {{designed}} by Cedric Price, Frank Newby and Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon, and was built in 1964. A variety of birds have been kept in the aviary since it was opened, and it currently houses green peafowl, <b>sacred</b> <b>ibis,</b> little egrets, cattle egrets, northern bald ibis and grey-headed gulls.|$|E
50|$|Because this ibis has {{historically}} been widely considered conspecific with the African <b>sacred</b> <b>ibis,</b> no early separate conservation measures have been proposed for the former. Coastal sites are generally poorly protected in western Madagascar, although new wetland conservation initiatives now include the species as a conservation target. On the Seychelles, the Aldabra atoll has been designated a Special Reserve.|$|E
50|$|The SAS pattern {{parachute}} wings {{were designed}} by Lieutenant Jock Lewes {{and based on the}} basic British Army design approved in 1940 but modified to reflect the Middle East origins of the new unit by the substitution of the stylised <b>sacred</b> <b>Ibis</b> wings of Isis of Egyptian iconography depicted in the décor of Shepheard's Hotel in Cairo.|$|E

50|$|Mangrove swamps are {{important}} feeding grounds for fish, birds and animals. Marine wildlife includes oysters and shrimps. Mammals found here include the African manatee. Birds in these wet habitats include Goliath heron, purple heron, cattle egret, striated heron, western reef heron, greater flamingo, lesser flamingo, African spoonbill, and African <b>sacred</b> <b>ibis.</b> The forests also provide important habitat for migratory birds.|$|E
5000|$|The Village Hotel {{includes}} a small pond filled with {{several types of}} turtles (box and soft-shelled).

50|$|Apart {{from its}} {{occurrence}} on Aldabra, the Malagasy <b>sacred</b> <b>ibis</b> is sparsely distributed along and {{restricted to the}} west coast of Madagascar, especially between Port-Berge and Moromoe. Although uncommon, some high densities of resident breeding populations have been observed in mangroves and estuaries near Soalala and Sahamalaza Bay and Baie de Baly; the region encompassed between these locations appears to be a species’ stronghold.|$|E
