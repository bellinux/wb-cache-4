5|$|Sutherst {{said the}} <b>scratch</b> <b>marks</b> {{appeared}} in photographs taken on 10 September 1985, 34 {{days after the}} murders, but were not visible in the original crime-scene photographs. He also said {{he had failed to}} find in the photographs any chipped paint on the carpet below the mantelpiece, where it might have been expected to fall had the mantelpiece been scratched during a struggle. He was asked by the CCRC to examine a red spot on the carpet visible in photographs underneath the scratches on the mantelpiece. He said the red spot matched a piece of nail varnish missing from one of Sheila's toes. He concluded that the <b>scratch</b> <b>marks</b> on the mantel had been created after the day of the murders.|$|E
5|$|Church members {{reported}} that Father Feit's confession line moved slowly {{that night and}} that he was away from the sanctuary several times. When the canal at the crime scene was drained several days after the discovery of Garza's body, Feit's photo slide viewer was found in the canal. Fellow priests noticed <b>scratch</b> <b>marks</b> on Feit's hands after midnight mass, and they said it was irregular for Feit to have taken Garza to the church rectory to hear her confession. The McAllen Police Department initially said that Feit passed polygraph tests, but the tests were later said to be inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|Discs : Circular fossils, such as Ediacaria, Cyclomedusa and Rugoconites led to {{the initial}} {{identification}} of Ediacaran fossils as cnidaria, which include jellyfish and corals. Further examination has provided alternative interpretations of all disc-shaped fossils: not one is now confidently recognised as a jellyfish. Alternate explanations include holdfasts and protists; the patterns displayed where two meet have led to many 'individuals' being identified as microbial colonies, and yet others may represent <b>scratch</b> <b>marks</b> formed as stalked organisms spun around their holdfasts. Useful diagnostic characters are often lacking because only {{the underside of the}} organism is preserved by fossilisation.|$|E

50|$|Exosomatic {{memory is}} the {{recording}} of memories outside the brain. The earliest forms of symbolic behavior - <b>scratching</b> <b>marks</b> on bones - seem to be intended as exosomatic memory. However it was the invention of writing that allowed complex memories to be recorded.|$|R
5|$|That the gun had a {{silencer}} on {{it during}} the murders was central to the prosecution's case. With the silencer, the gun was too long for Sheila to have turned the gun on herself. According to the prosecution, paint on the silencer could be matched to fresh <b>scratch</b> <b>marks</b> on the kitchen mantelpiece, assumed {{to have been made}} during a fight for the gun. That the silencer was found in the gun cupboard was important to the prosecution, because Sheila had no reason to return it to the cupboard before killing herself. But that it was found by one of the cousins who inherited part of the estate—days after the police had searched the house—has blighted the prosecution's case, even though it was accepted by a majority of the jury.|$|E
5|$|The burrows {{observed}} imply simple behaviour, and {{the complex}} efficient feeding traces common {{from the start}} of the Cambrian are absent. Some Ediacaran fossils, especially discs, have been interpreted tentatively as trace fossils but this hypothesis has not gained widespread acceptance. As well as burrows, some trace fossils have been found directly associated with an Ediacaran fossil. Yorgia and Dickinsonia are often found at the end of long pathways of trace fossils matching their shape; these fossils are thought to be associated with ciliary feeding but the precise method of formation of these disconnected and overlapping fossils largely remains a mystery. The potential mollusc Kimberella is associated with <b>scratch</b> <b>marks,</b> perhaps formed by a radula.|$|E
5|$|The defence {{commissioned}} {{a report from}} Peter Sutherst, a British forensic photographic expert, who was asked in 2008 to examine negatives of the kitchen taken {{on the day of}} the murders and later. In his report, dated 17 January 2010, Sutherst argued that the <b>scratch</b> <b>marks</b> in the red paintwork on the kitchen mantelpiece had been created after the crime-scene photographs had been taken. The prosecution alleged that the marks had been made during the struggle in the kitchen between Bamber and his father, as the silencer, attached to the rifle, had scratched against the mantelpiece. The prosecution said that paint chips identical to the paint on the mantelpiece were found on or inside the silencer.|$|E

25|$|That {{the weapon}} {{experienced}} jamming of the extractor is not contested, but {{its contribution to}} Custer's defeat is considered negligible. This conclusion is supported by evidence from archaeological studies performed at the battlefield, where the recovery of Springfield cartridge casing, bearing tell-tale <b>scratch</b> <b>marks</b> indicating manual extraction, were rare.|$|E
25|$|During the encounters, the Fords fired several {{shots at}} the {{creature}} and believed that they had hit it, though no traces of blood were found. An extensive search of the area failed to locate the creature, but three-toed footprints were found close to the house, <b>scratch</b> <b>marks</b> on the porch, and some damage to a window and the house's siding.|$|E
25|$|Cruziana are {{excavation}} trace marks {{made on the}} {{sea floor}} which have a two-lobed structure with a central groove. The lobes are covered with <b>scratch</b> <b>marks</b> made by {{the legs of the}} excavating organism, usually a trilobite or allied arthropod. Cruziana are most common in marine sediments formed during the Paleozoic era, particularly in rocks from the Cambrian and Ordovician periods. Over 30 ichnospecies of Cruziana have been identified. See also Isopodichnus.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the years}} the term has been {{attributed}} to sports, including toeing the starting line in track events and toeing a center line in boxing, where boxers were instructed to line up on either side of to start a match. However, the earlier boxing term was toeing the scratch, referring to a <b>scratch</b> <b>mark</b> on the floor. One of the earliest references related to an English prize fight in 1840.|$|R
50|$|Ross {{attracted}} {{immediate attention}} as a sprinter in 2003 when he comfortably won the Stawell Gift off {{a mark of}} seven metres. In 2005, he again won the Stawell Gift - this time from the honoured <b>scratch</b> <b>mark</b> time, becoming only the second athlete to achieve this feat (behind Madagascar's Jean-Louis Ravelomanantsoa in 1975) and the first Australian. He also became the third person ever to win the event twice.|$|R
5000|$|Treatment of abfraction lesions can be {{difficult}} due to the many possible causes. To provide the best treatment option the dental clinician must determine the level of activity and predict possible progression of the lesion. [...] A No.12 scalpel is carefully used by the dental clinician {{to make a small}} indentation on the lesion, this is then closely monitored for changes. Loss of a <b>scratch</b> <b>mark</b> signifies that the lesion is active and progressing.|$|R
25|$|The {{origin of}} creases is {{uncertain}} {{but they were}} certainly in use {{by the beginning of}} the 18th century when they were created by <b>scratch</b> <b>marks,</b> the popping crease being 46 inches in front of the wicket at each end of the pitch. In the course of time, the scratches became cuts which were an inch deep and an inch wide. The cut was in use until the second half of the 19th century. Sometime during the early career of Alfred Shaw, he suggested that the creases should be made by lines of whitewash and this was gradually adopted through the 1870s.|$|E
25|$|Another version tells {{that two}} Sioux boys wandered {{far from their}} village when Mato the bear, a huge {{creature}} that had claws the size of tipi poles, spotted them, and wanted to eat them for breakfast. He was almost upon them when the boys prayed to Wakan Tanka the Creator to help them. They rose up on a huge rock, while Mato {{tried to get up}} from every side, leaving huge <b>scratch</b> <b>marks</b> as he did. Finally, he sauntered off, disappointed and discouraged. The bear came to rest east of the Black Hills at what is now Bear Butte. Wanblee, the eagle, helped the boys off the rock and back to their village. A painting depicting this legend by artist Herbert A. Collins hangs over the fireplace in the visitor's center at Devils Tower.|$|E
25|$|Scabies may be {{diagnosed}} clinically in geographical areas {{where it is}} common when diffuse itching presents along with either lesions in two typical spots or itchiness is present in another household member. The classical sign of scabies is the burrow made by a mite within the skin. To detect the burrow, the suspected area is rubbed with ink from a fountain pen or a topical tetracycline solution, which glows under a special light. The skin is then wiped with an alcohol pad. If the person is infected with scabies, the characteristic zigzag or S pattern of the burrow will appear across the skin; however, interpreting this test may be difficult, as the burrows are scarce and may be obscured by <b>scratch</b> <b>marks.</b> A definitive diagnosis is made by finding either the scabies mites or their eggs and fecal pellets. Searches for these signs involve either scraping a suspected area, mounting the sample in potassium hydroxide and examining it under a microscope, or using dermoscopy to examine the skin directly.|$|E

500|$|Specimens {{were first}} found in Australia's Ediacara Hills, but recent {{research}} has concentrated on the numerous finds near the White Sea in Russia, which cover an interval of time from [...] As with many fossils from this time, its evolutionary relationships to other organisms are hotly debated. Paleontologists initially classified Kimberella {{as a type of}} jellyfish, but since 1997 features of its anatomy and its association with <b>scratch</b> <b>marks</b> resembling those made by a radula have been interpreted as signs that {{it may have been a}} mollusc. Although some paleontologists dispute its classification as a mollusc, it is generally accepted as being at least a bilaterian.|$|E
500|$|So far Kimberella fossils show {{no sign of}} a radula, the toothed chitinous [...] "tongue" [...] that is the {{diagnostic}} feature of modern molluscs, excluding bivalves. Since radulae are very rarely preserved in fossil molluscs, its absence {{does not necessarily mean that}} K. quadrata did not have one. The rocks in the immediate vicinity of Kimberella fossils bear <b>scratch</b> <b>marks</b> that have been compared to those made by the radulae of molluscs as they graze on microbial mats. These traces, named Radulichnus and Kimberichnus, have been interpreted as circumstantial evidence for the presence of a radula. In conjunction with the univalve shell, this has been taken to indicate Kimberella was a mollusc or very closely related to molluscs. In 2001 and 2007 Fedonkin suggested that the feeding mechanism might be a retractable proboscis with hook-like organs at its end. Kimberella′s feeding apparatus appears to differ significantly from the typical mollusc radula, and this demonstrates that Kimberella is at best a stem-group mollusc. [...] Notably, the <b>scratch</b> <b>marks</b> indicate that the 'teeth' were dragged towards the organism, not pushed away as in molluscs, and that the maximum impact on the sediment was when the mouthpart was furthest from the organism. [...] The direction of grazing is also backwards, as opposed to forwards as in molluscs. [...] Furthermore, the constant width of grooves implies stereoglossy – a trait that is very derived in molluscs. It has been argued that the shape of the feeding traces is incompatible with a radula, and that despite the molluscan body form, the lack of a radula places Kimberella well outside the molluscan crown group. [...] Butterfield points out that plenty of other groups of organisms bear structures capable of making similar marks.|$|E
