5|$|Chrysippus is {{the first}} Stoic for whom the third of the four Stoic categories, i.e. the {{category}} somehow disposed is attested. In the surviving evidence, Chrysippus frequently makes use of the categories of substance and quality, but makes little use {{of the other two}} Stoic categories (somehow disposed and somehow disposed in relation to something). It is not clear whether the categories had any special <b>significance</b> <b>for</b> Chrysippus, and a clear doctrine of categories may be the work of later Stoics.|$|E

The British followed roughly the same alignment as the old routes, and at some places the newer routes ran parallel to the older routes.|$|E
5|$|The Central Lowlands is a {{rift valley}} mainly {{comprising}} Paleozoic formations. Many of these sediments have economic <b>significance</b> <b>for</b> {{it is here}} that the coal and iron bearing rocks that fuelled Scotland's industrial revolution are found. This area has also experienced intense volcanism, Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh being the remnant of a once much larger volcano. This area is relatively low-lying, although even here hills such as the Ochils and Campsie Fells are rarely far from view.|$|E

The document had major <b>significance</b> <b>for</b> overall U.S. policy toward Europe {{in the critical}} year of 1940. While the U.S. did not engage the Soviet Union militarily in the region, the Declaration enabled the Baltic states to maintain independent diplomatic missions, and Executive Order 8484 protected Baltic financial assets. Its essence was supported by all subsequent U.S. presidents and Congressional resolutions. The Baltic states re-established their independence in 1990–91.|$|E

5|$|The {{proteasome}} and its subunits are {{of clinical}} <b>significance</b> <b>for</b> {{at least two}} reasons: (1) a compromised complex assembly or a dysfunctional proteasome {{can be associated with}} the underlying pathophysiology of specific diseases, and (2) they can be exploited as drug targets for therapeutic interventions. More recently, more effort has been made to consider the proteasome for the development of novel diagnostic markers and strategies. An improved and comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology of the proteasome should lead to clinical applications in the future.|$|E
5|$|Ambrose and Robert Dudley {{were very}} close, {{in matters of}} {{business}} and personally. Through their paternal grandmother they descended from the Hundred Years War heroes, John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, and Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick. Robert Dudley was especially fascinated by the Beauchamp descent and, with his brother, adopted the ancient heraldic device of the earls of Warwick, the bear and ragged staff. Due to such genealogical aspects the West Midlands held a special <b>significance</b> <b>for</b> him. The town of Warwick felt this during a magnificent visit by the Earl in 1571 to celebrate {{the feast of the}} Order of Saint Michael, with which Leicester had been invested by the French king in 1566. He shortly afterwards founded Lord Leycester's Hospital, a charity for aged and injured soldiers still functioning today.|$|E
5|$|At {{this time}} Semaphore, with its jetty built in 1860, was the state's main entry point for {{passengers}} and mail. It had a signal station (built 1872) {{and a time}} ball tower (built 1875). Semaphore remained of great maritime <b>significance</b> <b>for</b> the state until the 1880s. When {{the decision was made}} to build the fort, in 1878, the state's population had reached approximately 250,000. Settlement extended beyond Port Augusta, though Adelaide remained the dominant feature in the economy partly due to the layout of the rail network. At this point Adelaide had a population of over 30,000. Port Adelaide was the main port for South Australia, with over 1000 ships visiting each year, and a local population of over 2,500.|$|E

5|$|Native Americans {{valued the}} great auk {{as a food}} source during the winter and as an {{important}} cultural symbol. Images of the great auk {{have been found in}} bone necklaces. A person buried at the Maritime Archaic site at Port au Choix, Newfoundland, dating to about 2000 BC, was found surrounded by more than 200 great auk beaks, which are believed to have been part of a suit made from their skins, with the heads left attached as decoration. Nearly half of the bird bones found in graves at this site were of the great auk, suggesting that it had great cultural <b>significance</b> <b>for</b> the Maritime Archaic people. The extinct Beothuks of Newfoundland made pudding out of the eggs of the great auk. The Dorset Eskimos also hunted it. The Saqqaq in Greenland overhunted the species, causing a local reduction in range.|$|E
5|$|Some species live separately, in {{vertical}} tubes {{embedded in}} soft sediment, while others form tangled masses buried in or encrusting rocks and shells. In some habitats populations of phoronids reach tens of thousand of individuals per square meter. The actinotroch larvae are familiar among plankton, and sometimes {{account for a}} significant proportion of the zooplankton biomass. Predators include fish, gastropods (snails), and nematodes (tiny roundworms). One phoronid species is unpalatable to many epibenthic predators. Various parasites infest phoronids' body cavities, digestive tract and tentacles. It is unknown whether phoronids have any <b>significance</b> <b>for</b> humans. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has not listed any phoronid species as endangered.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian National Vimy Memorial {{site has}} {{considerable}} sociocultural <b>significance</b> <b>for</b> Canada. The idea that Canada's {{national identity and}} nationhood were born out of the Battle of Vimy Ridge is an opinion that is widely repeated in military and general histories of Canada. Historian Denise Thomson suggests that {{the construction of the}} Vimy memorial represents the culmination of an increasingly assertive nationalism that developed in Canada during the interwar period. Hucker suggests that the memorial transcends the Battle of Vimy Ridge and now serves as an enduring image of the whole First World War, while expressing the enormous impact of war in general, and also considers that the 2005 restoration project serves as evidence of a new generation's determination to remember Canada's contribution and sacrifice during the First World War.|$|E

5|$|The waters around Svalbard are of {{strategic}} <b>significance</b> <b>for</b> Russia as the Northern Fleet must {{pass through the}} area to reach the Atlantic Ocean. The concern of the Soviet Union and Russia was therefore to ensure that listening stations and anti-submarine warfare installations were not placed on the archipelago. Except during the Second World War, Norway has never stationed any military troops on Svalbard. However, the Norwegian Coast Guard carries out surveillance. There were many protests during the Cold War from the Soviet Union against Norwegian activity on the island, including purely civil arrangements. The Soviet Union issued many memorandums protesting such installations as satellite ground stations and airports, and even the filming of Orion's Belt, {{on the grounds that}} it could be a cover for or had the potential for being used for military activities.|$|E

The conquest held great <b>significance</b> <b>for</b> Yemen because the Ayyubids managed to unite the previous three independent states (Zabid, Aden, and Sana'a) under a single power. However, when Turan-Shah was transferred from his governorship in Yemen in 1176, uprisings {{broke out in the}} territory and were not quelled until 1182 when Saladin assigned his other brother Tughtekin Sayf al-Islam as governor of Yemen.|$|E
