5|$|A {{worldwide}} backlash {{over the}} resulting destruction, and the fears Wanda's hallucinations incited, send the team into hiding {{at a safe}} house. Thor departs to consult with Dr. Erik Selvig {{on the meaning of}} the apocalyptic future he <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hallucination, while Romanoff and Banner plan to flee together after realizing a mutual attraction. However, Nick Fury arrives and encourages the team to form a plan to stop Ultron. In Seoul, Ultron forces the team's friend Dr. Helen Cho to use her synthetic-tissue technology, together with vibranium and the scepter's gem, to perfect a new body for him. As Ultron uploads himself into the body, Wanda is able to read his mind; discovering his plan for human extinction, the Maximoffs turn against Ultron. Rogers, Romanoff, and Barton find Ultron and retrieve the synthetic body, but Ultron captures Romanoff.|$|E
5|$|Graham visits Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) and {{describes}} his visions, to which Henry replies {{that he must}} be the queen's Huntsman. The Huntsman was hired by the Evil Queen to remove Snow White's heart and bring it back to her, but when he does not do so, she removes his heart. Graham later attempts to explain to Emma that he could not feel anything with Regina because he does not have a heart. Graham and Emma then encounter the wolf from Graham's visions, and follow it to a graveyard and vault marked with a symbol Graham <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> visions and in Henry's book. Looking for his heart, Graham fervently searches the vault, which {{turns out to be the}} tomb of Henry Mills. Regina arrives to place flowers on her father's grave and is furious to find them there.|$|E
5|$|In the Enchanted Forest, the Evil Queen mourns {{the death}} of her husband, Snow White's father, {{although}} she herself is responsible for his death. Snow (Goodwin) and the Queen seemingly comfort each other over the loss. The Queen consults her magic mirror (Esposito) to ask how she can kill Snow, who is beloved by the people but a threat to her bid for the throne. She says that the king's knights will not kill his daughter, and the mirror tells her that she needs a huntsman. As Graham <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> flashbacks, the Huntsman (Dornan) and his brother wolf seem to enjoy living a peaceful life in the woods. The Huntsman kills only for himself to live, and has no compassion for humans, who do not understand the wild. As the Huntsman and his wolf enter a tavern, the other patrons begin harassing him, prompting him to successfully defend himself. His performance is viewed in the magic mirror by the Queen, who is greatly impressed. She summons the Huntsman to offer him anything he wants on the condition that he brings her Snow's heart. He agrees to this deal, in return asking for the protection of all the wolves in the Enchanted Forest.|$|E

5|$|Once, Khandoba and Mhalsa {{play a game}} of saripat (translated as game of dice or chess). Khandoba loses {{everything}} to Mhalsa in the wager, except his dhoti, his flag, his staff (wand) and his bhandari, the bag of magical bhandara (turmeric powder). In a dream, he sees Banai and falls in love with her. He goes on a hunt in the forest, gets away from the army and stays with Banai for twelve years. He marries her in non-ritualistic marriage and brings her back to Jejuri. A variant describes how Khandoba arrives in Chandanpur on a hunting expedition and becomes thirsty. A Dhangar directs him to Banai's vada. Banai offers him water or sends a pot of water, in which Khandoba reads Banai's name. In another version, the pot with nine jewels is a sign for Khandoba to recognise Banai, the girl he <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> dream. He falls for her and loses purposefully in saripat with Mhalsa and accepts a twelve-year exile. In this period, he disguises himself as an impoverished, old leper and becomes a man-servant of Banai's father. Some folk songs have erotic overtones, for example, some songs give erotic descriptions of Banai's beauty which maddens Khandoba.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} year of his reign Nebuchadnezzar has a dream. When he wakes up, he realizes that the dream has some {{important}} message, so he consults his wise men. Wary of their potential to fabricate an explanation the king refuses to tell the wise men what he <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> dream. Rather, he demands that his wise men tell him what the content of the dream was, and then interpret it. When the wise men protest that this is beyond the power of any man, he sentences all, including Daniel and his friends, to death. Daniel receives an explanatory vision from God: Nebuchadnezzar had seen an enormous statue with a head of gold, breast and arms of silver, belly and thighs of bronze, legs of iron, and feet of mixed iron and clay, then saw the statue destroyed by a rock that turned into a mountain filling the whole earth. Daniel explains the dream to the king: the statue symbolized four successive kingdoms, starting with Nebuchadnezzar, all of which would be crushed by God's kingdom, which would endure forever. Nebuchadnezzar acknowledges the supremacy of Daniel's god, raises Daniel over all his wise men, and places Daniel and his companions over the province of Babylon.|$|E
25|$|The {{two most}} common {{themes in the}} Linares' work are the {{animated}} skeleton and the alebrije. Both {{are based on the}} forms and techniques used to make Judas figures and there are early works by the families of human Judas figures with animal heads and wings. According to the family, Pedro Linares came up with the concept of alebrijes as a young man sick in bed with a high fever, dreaming of them and the name. After he became well again, he began to create the monsters he <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> dreams. Despite the story, Pedro Linares himself admitted that the creatures evolved over his lifetime. These creatures are often a composite of various real and imaginary animals painted in bright colors and wild designs. The creating of these creatures soon spread to Celaya and then into the state of Oaxaca, where there are carved from wood rather than shaped from paper products. Examples of these creatures can be found in various museums in Mexico including the Museo Casa Estudio Diego Rivera y Frida Kahlo as well as the Museo de Arte Popular in Mexico City. The grand scale of imitation has had its benefits and drawbacks. Since their invention, alebrijes have morphed into more contemporary forms with images from rock stars, superheroes and more. Daniel Barrera is a known cartonería artist from Ciudad Nezahualcoyotl. His alebrije works tend to be based on popular culture, especially rock bands such as Judas Priest as well as the alebrije tradition. However, the family notes that there is a serious problem with other artists passing off their wares as from the Linares family.|$|E

500|$|Adolf Hitler was {{an admirer}} of Wagner's music and <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> operas an {{embodiment}} of his own vision of the German nation; in a 1922 speech he claimed that Wagner's works glorified [...] "the heroic Teutonic nature...

There continues to be debate {{about the extent to}} which Wagner's views might have influenced Nazi thinking. Houston Stewart Chamberlain (1855–1927), who married Wagner's daughter Eva in 1908 but never met Wagner, was the author of the racist book The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century, approved by the Nazi movement. Chamberlain met Hitler on a number of occasions between 1923 and 1927 in Bayreuth, but cannot credibly be regarded as a conduit of Wagner's own views. The Nazis used those parts of Wagner's thought that were useful for propaganda and ignored or suppressed the rest.|$|E

500|$|Although monastic chroniclers {{after the}} Norman Conquest {{accused him of}} crimes such as perjury and homicide, they do not provide any {{evidence}} of those crimes. Almost 100 years after his death, another Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, was taunted in 1164 by King Henry II's barons with Stigand's fate for daring to oppose his king. Modern historians views tend {{to see him as}} either a wily politician and indifferent bishop, or to see him purely in terms of his ecclesiastical failings. The historian Frank Stenton felt that his [...] "whole career shows that he was essentially a politician". Concurring with this, the historian Nick Higham said that [...] "Stigand was a seasoned politician whose career had been built on an accurate reading of the balance of power." [...] Another historian, Eric John, said that [...] "Stigand had a fair claim to be the worst bishop of Christendom". However, the historian Frank Barlow felt that [...] "he was a man of cultured tastes, a patron of the arts who was generous to the monasteries which he held". Alexander Rumble argued that Stigand was unlucky in living past the Conquest, stating that it could be said that Stigand was [...] "unlucky to live so long that he <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> lifetime not only the end of the Anglo-Saxon state but also the challenging of uncanonical, but hitherto tolerated, practices by a wave of papal reforms".|$|E
500|$|Since my {{work was}} announced, several Lives and Memoirs of Dr. Johnson have been published, the most voluminous {{of which is}} one {{compiled}} for the booksellers of London, by Sir John Hawkins, Knight, a man, whom, during my long intimacy with Dr. Johnson, I never <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> company, I think but once, and I am sure not above twice. Johnson might have esteemed him for his decent, religious demeanour, and his knowledge of books and literary history; but from the rigid formalities of his manners, {{it is evident that}} they never could have lived together with companionable ease and familiarity; nor had Sir John Hawkins that nice perception which was necessary to mark the finer and less obvious parts of Johnson's character. His being appointed one of his executors, gave him an opportunity of taking possession of such fragments of a diary and other papers as were left; of which, before delivering them up to the residuary legatee, whose property they were, he endeavoured to extract the substance. In this he has not been very successful, as I have found upon a perusal of those papers, which have been since transferred to me. Sir John Hawkins's ponderous labours, I must acknowledge, exhibit a farrago, of which a considerable portion is not devoid of entertainment to the lovers of literary gossipping; but besides its being swelled out with long unnecessary extracts from various works, (even one of several leaves from Osborne's Harleian Catalogue, and those not compiled by Johnson, but by Oldys,) a very small part of it relates to the person who is the subject of the book; and, in that, there is such an inaccuracy in the statement of facts, as in so solemn an authour is hardly excusable, and certainly makes his narrative very unsatisfactory. But what is still worse, there is throughout the whole of it a dark uncharitable cast, by which the most unfavourable construction is put upon almost every circumstance in the character and conduct of my illustrious friend; who, I trust, will, be a true and fair delineation, be vindicated both from the injurious misrepresentation of this authour, and from the slighter aspersions of a lady who once lived in great intimacy with him." ...|$|E
