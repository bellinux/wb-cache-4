5|$|Ayutthaya sat on {{an island}} {{surrounded}} by three rivers—the Lopburi River to the north, the Chao Phraya River {{to the west and}} south, and the Pa Sak River to the east, forming a formidable natural moat. The Chao Phraya basin where Ayutthaya is situated was low and prone to flooding—especially intense during the rainy season when torrential waters flowed in great quantity from the north along the Lopburi River. This flood would begin approximately in July and end somewhere between October and November, giving Tabinshwehti only five months to capture Ayutthaya—otherwise his camp grounds and supply routes would be flooded. There was also the possibility that the flood could trap his forces. The low, swampy area around the city was laced with numerous canals thronging with gun boats armed with cannon to repulse any attempt at an attack on the city. Also, the Burmese had only small cannon that they had brought with them, while the Siamese had large cannon mounted along the city walls. The Burmese had the city surrounded, but without the ability to cross the rivers or breach the city walls with cannon fire, were left to camp around it instead, while the interconnected waterways to the north and south made it fairly easy to resupply the defenders in the city. Fifty Portuguese mercenaries, who had elected Galeote Pereira as their captain, defended the weakest part of the city wall for Maha Chakkraphat. Unable to take the city conventionally, Tabinshwehti offered bribes to these defenders. The Portuguese reacted with derision, and refused. When a Siamese commander heard of this, he <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> the gates of the city and dared the Burmese King to bring the money—a dare that was ignored.|$|E
25|$|One {{night while}} staying {{with a family}} in Jerusalem, he wanted to pray at the only church {{remaining}} in Jerusalem at that time. It was the Church of the Room of the Last Supper on Mount Zion. As he approached the heavy, locked doors, they <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> of their own accord, allowing him to enter the church. Nicholas {{fell to the ground}} in thanksgiving.|$|E
25|$|In the winter, {{the screen}} was removed and {{replaced}} with a storm window, which created a two-layer separation between the interior and exterior spaces, increasing window insulation in cold winter months. To permit ventilation the storm window may be hung from removable hinge loops and <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> using folding metal arms. No screening was usually possible with open storm windows, though in the winter, insects typically are not active.|$|E

60|$|While he was {{wondering}} what it meant, the door <b>swung</b> suddenly <b>open.</b> A man filled up the entrance, a big man in a tan uniform, blocking the way ominously.|$|R
60|$|The door <b>swung</b> quickly <b>open</b> and {{he stood}} there in the {{streaming}} sunlight of the morning--so tall he was he seemed to fill the doorway--and he smiled and extended his hands.|$|R
25|$|At {{the lower}} {{position}} {{the process was}} reversed. Here the water pressure {{was strong enough to}} press the box tightly into position against the exit opening. Another rack and pinion (again operated from above) lifted the outer gate, the levels were equalised again, the inner door on the box was <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> and the boat floated out. Apart from the inevitable small leakages, no significant amount of water had been used in the process.|$|E
500|$|The trains left Liverpool on {{time and}} without any {{technical}} problems. The Duke of Wellington's special train ran on one track, and the other seven trains ran on an adjacent and parallel track, sometimes ahead and sometimes behind the Duke's train. Around [...] out of Liverpool {{the first of many}} problems occurred, when one of the trains derailed and the following train collided with it. With no reported injuries or damage, the derailed locomotive was lifted back onto the track and the journey continued. At Parkside railway station, near the midpoint of the line, the locomotives made a scheduled stop to take on water. Although the railway staff advised passengers to remain on the trains while this took place, around 50 of the dignitaries on board alighted when the Duke of Wellington's special train stopped. One of those who got off was William Huskisson, former cabinet minister and Member of Parliament for Liverpool. Huskisson had been a highly influential figure {{in the creation of the}} British Empire and an architect of the doctrine of free trade, but had fallen out with Wellington in 1828 over the issue of parliamentary reform and had resigned from the cabinet. Hoping to be reconciled with Wellington, he approached the Duke's railway carriage and shook his hand. Distracted by the Duke, he did not notice an approaching locomotive on the adjacent track, Rocket. On realising it was approaching he panicked and tried to clamber into the Duke's carriage, but the door of the carriage <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> leaving him hanging directly in the path of the oncoming Rocket. He fell onto the tracks in front of the train, suffering serious leg injuries and dying later that night.|$|E
2500|$|On November 1, 1893, in {{foggy weather}} after dawn, the sternwheeler Elwood {{approached}} the bridge, {{and gave the}} signal to open the draw, one long and three short blasts on the steam whistle. [...] To allow the steamer to pass, the bridge operator <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> the swinging draw section of the bridge. [...] The bridge tender closed the wooden gates {{on each side of}} the draw and hung a red signal light as a warning.|$|E

60|$|Saxon {{started to}} take off her hat, but {{suddenly}} {{sat down on the}} bed. She sobbed softly, with considered repression, but the weak-latched door <b>swung</b> noiselessly <b>open,</b> and she was startled by her sister-in-law's voice.|$|R
60|$|Two {{horses were}} led forward, and the {{released}} men swung {{themselves into the}} saddle. There was a hasty mounting, and when the men <b>swung</b> into <b>open</b> fours a shout went up from the surging crowd.|$|R
2500|$|The Model 1861 used metal rimfire cartridges, {{and had a}} {{laterally}} hinged block {{called the}} [...] "cap" [...] which enveloped the standing breech and could be <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> to the left when the locking catch was released. This design was refined in 1862 {{with the addition of}} cam surfaces which improved the cartridge seating and extraction. The Model 1861 was chambered for the Spencer [...]56-56 rimfire cartridge, and the improved Model 1862 used the Spencer [...]56-52 rimfire cartridge. The barrels were not designed to accept a bayonet.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{bridge over}} the Murrumbidgee River at Hay was built in 1872 {{at a cost of}} £20,000. The {{structure}} included a turntable which enabled the middle-section to be <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> to allow the passage of steamers. [...] The opening of the Hay Bridge was delayed while the approaches were formed. It was finally opened on 31 August 1874 by the Colonial Secretary of New South Wales, Henry Parkes. [...] The old bridge was eventually replaced by a new one, opened in June 1973. The old Hay Bridge was subsequently demolished. The turntable, last used in 1946, was placed in the river-bend just north of where the bridge had been.|$|E
2500|$|Elwood was a sternwheel {{steamboat}} {{which was}} built to operate on the Willamette River, in Oregon, but which later operated on the Lewis River in Washington, the Stikine River in Canada, and on Puget Sound. The name of this vessel is sometimes seen spelled [...] "Ellwood". [...] Elwood is probably best known for an incident in 1893, when it was approaching the Madison Street Bridge over the Willamette River in Portland, Oregon. [...] The bridge <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> to allow the steamer to pass. [...] However, a streetcar {{coming in from the}} east end of the bridge failed to notice the bridge was open, and ran off into the river in the Madison Street Bridge disaster.|$|E
60|$|On this day, then, he went {{directly}} to the door and spent hours examining it and fussing with the hinges, the knob and the latch. Finally he stumbled upon the right combination, and the door <b>swung</b> creakingly <b>open</b> before his astonished eyes.|$|R
60|$|Flambeau was plainly {{in a mood}} {{to break}} down the door with his big shoulders; but the Scotchman, with more reason, if less intuition, fumbled about on the frame of the door till he found the {{invisible}} button; and the door <b>swung</b> slowly <b>open.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Outside {{the cathedral}} {{there was the}} sudden blare of trumpets. The great doors <b>swung</b> violently <b>open,</b> and the entire throng were upon their feet in an instant as a trooper of the Royal Horse shouted: [...] "The king! The king! Make way for Leopold of Lutha!" ...|$|R
2500|$|On 21 August 1835, Zebra {{was on her}} {{way from}} the Cocos (Keeling) Islands to the Swan River and [...] west-south-west of Naturalite Bay when a strong squall threw the brig on its beam ends. Fortunately a port <b>swung</b> <b>open,</b> {{allowing}} the immense amount of water covering the weather coamings to escape, enabling her to right herself. The waves also threw two guns overboard; later M'Crae threw another two overboard as well to lighten Zebra. The bad weather continued, and on 27 August M'Crae threw the remaining eight cannon overboard. Two days later she reached Rottenest Island and eventually Fremantle. On 18 September 1834 he sailed for the Cape of Good Hope.|$|E
2500|$|On {{realising}} his danger he {{panicked and}} made two attempts {{to cross the}} other line, but {{changed his mind and}} returned to the Duke's carriage. At this point Joseph Locke became aware and threw Rocket into reverse, but it would have taken 10 seconds to have any effect. Huskisson then panicked that the gap between the two trains was not big enough and so tried to clamber into the Duke's carriage, but the door of the carriage <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> leaving him hanging directly {{in the path of the}} oncoming Rocket, which hit the door, throwing Huskisson onto the tracks in front of the train. [...] His leg was horrifically mangled by the locomotive.|$|E
2500|$|The second aircraft, the Bristol Type 75 was {{powered by}} the {{preferred}} Jupiter engine, which was mounted behind a fireproof bulkhead, with the entire engine installation (or [...] "power-egg") capable of being <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> like a gate to allow {{easy access to the}} rear of the engine. The Type 75 was designed to accommodate eight passengers and two crew. This aircraft, registered G-EBEV, first flew in July 1922. A third aircraft, the Bristol Type 79 was ordered by the Air Council to meet a requirement (Specification 32/22) for a single-engined ambulance landplane for the Royal Air Force. It was fitted with wings of greater chord, and had accommodation for three stretchers and an attendant or two stretchers and four sitting patients.|$|E
60|$|With fresh courage {{he moved}} to the safe, which stood {{in the corner of the}} room. It must be there, if anywhere, that this {{precious}} document lay. He tried his keys one by one. At last he found the right one. The great door <b>swung</b> slowly <b>open.</b>|$|R
60|$|There was a bell {{beside the}} gate, and Dorothy {{pushed the button}} and heard a silvery tinkle sound within. Then the big gate <b>swung</b> slowly <b>open,</b> and they all passed through and found {{themselves}} in a high arched room, the walls of which glistened with countless emeralds.|$|R
60|$|As the {{secretary}} spoke, a double {{door at the}} end of the hall <b>swung</b> noisily <b>open,</b> at the blow of an imperious fist, and with a rattle of arms and accoutrements a man of gigantic stature, wearing full military uniform and a spiked helmet, strode into the room.|$|R
2500|$|The M-30 had {{a modern}} split trail {{carriage}} with {{leaf spring suspension}} and steel wheels with rubber tires. It was usually towed by vehicle without a limber. The carriage allowed for a towing speed of up to 50km/h on paved road and up to 35km/h on gravel or dirt roads, although the gun could also be moved {{by a team of}} six horses, in which case a limber was used. When the trails were <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> the suspension locked automatically [...] In an emergency it was possible to shoot in a [...] "single trail" [...] mode, at the price of a drastically reduced traverse (1°30'). The time required to set the gun up for combat was about 1 [...] 1.5 minutes.|$|E
2500|$|On December 29, 1897, Bailey Gatzert was {{approaching}} Portland from Astoria and {{passing through the}} draw of the swinging railroad bridge. [...] With 60 passengers on board, the steamer blew the whistle signal to open the bridge, and when the draw <b>swung</b> <b>open,</b> the vessel proceeded through {{on the east side}} of the bridge pier. [...] Before the steamer was halfway through, the drawbridge swung back, smashing into the vessel’s superstructure and jamming the steamer up against the bridge. [...] It was late in the evening, and except for the crew, everyone on board was asleep. [...] The bridge was opened again, and the steamer was able to proceed. [...] Although some cabins were crushed, there were no fatalities and only two people were hurt, neither of them seriously. [...] At the time, Bailey Gatzert was valued at $110,000.|$|E
2500|$|Pirs ( [...] , meaning [...] "pier"), (...) , [...] "docking module", SO-1 or DC-1 (docking compartment), and Poisk ( [...] ; lit. Search), {{also known}} as the Mini-Research Module 2 (MRM 2), , or МИМ 2. Pirs and Poisk are Russian airlock modules, each having 2 {{identical}} hatches. An outward-opening hatch on the Mir space station failed after it <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> too fast after unlatching, because of a small amount of air pressure remaining in the airlock. A different entry was used, and the hatch was repaired. All EVA hatches on the ISS open inwards and are pressure-sealing. Pirs was used to store, service, and refurbish Russian Orlan suits and provided contingency entry for crew using the slightly bulkier American suits. The outermost docking ports on both airlocks allow docking of Soyuz and Progress spacecraft, and the automatic transfer of propellants to and from storage on the ROS.|$|E
60|$|The {{room door}} slipped off its hook and <b>swung</b> wide <b>open</b> as the vessel rolled, and Dick, {{who could not}} {{withdraw}} unnoticed, decided to light his cigarette in order that the others might {{see that they were}} not alone. As he struck the match the captain got up.|$|R
60|$|The {{game was}} brought to a sudden interruption, for the cabin door was <b>swung</b> rudely <b>open,</b> and two rough fellows--Israel Martin, the boatswain, and Red Foley, the gunner--rushed into the cabin.

60|$|The caravan of Trubiggs's cattlemen {{who left}} for Portland by night steamer, Friday, was {{headed by a}} bulky-shouldered boss, who wore no coat and whose {{corduroy}} vest <b>swung</b> cheerfully <b>open.</b> A motley troupe were the cattlemen--Jews with small trunks, large imitation-leather valises and assorted bundles, a stolid prophet-bearded procession of weary men in tattered derbies and sweat-shop clothes.|$|R
2500|$|Once Typhoons started {{operating}} from forward landing grounds in Normandy, {{it was found}} that the dust clouds stirred up by propeller wash consisted of over 80 percent of hard, abrasive material which was damaging the Sabre engines. The sleeve valves in particular were subject to excessive wear and it was calculated that engines would last for three take-offs. As a result, a [...] "dome deflector" [...] was designed and manufactured at great speed by Napier, and within a week most Typhoons had been fitted with it. In operational service these mushroom-shaped air filters, which became red hot, had a propensity for being blown off the air intake at high speed whenever a Sabre engine backfired. They were soon replaced by drum-shaped filters designed by the RAE and Vokes. These had [...] "cuckoo clock" [...] doors in front, which <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> with the pressure changes caused by engine backfires. This standardised filter became Typhoon Mod.420.|$|E

2500|$|Buffalo Bill and his Wild West {{was back}} in Du Bois in September 1901. At this time McCreight lived in his townhouse, and had not yet moved to The Wigwam. [...] “At {{the opening of the}} 20th Century a crowd of twelve Oglala Lakota came to spend the evening with the writer. [...] Besides Chief Lone Bear, Chief Flying Hawk was in the party. [...] The yard outside was covered with neighbors, big and little, who had seen them come, arrayed in their war bonnets, beaded regalia and gay plumes of eagle quills, as they climbed to and spread over the wide veranda and <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> their richly covered blankets. [...] It was a {{surprise}} visit from old-time western friends. [...] Don [...] was quickly dispatched for cigars, fruit and candy, with a large market basket and instructions to deliver same to the back door,to apportion the supplies, and pass them around when the Indians got seated inside. [...] Don was thirteen, and full of business. [...] At the proper time, he appeared from the kitchen with both arms full, a cigar for each man on the platter, and another with candy, bananas, oranges and grapes. [...] Don set the fruit basket on a table in the outer room, and proceeded to pass the cigars, beginning with the big chief. [...] As he modestly handed the platter to the chief to take one cigar, the whole dozen or more were scooped from the plate and quickly stored within his blanket. [...] The boy was “game,” and went back his kitchen stores and brought another supply, and went on passing them to the others-one at a time.” “Chief Lone Bear noticed a pair of boxing gloves on the floor and signed to the writer to explain. They belonged to the [...] twins, aged five. More signals indicated he wanted to see them box. The two boys stood with open eyes gazing at the strange people, and it took a little coaxing to get the boys to put on the gloves. [...] But they, too, were game, and came to dad to have them tied on. All smiles, the visitors spread their chairs, through the arch into the big parlor, so as to form a large area, for the bout. [...] Dad called “time” and the boys went to it rough and tumble. They immediately forgot their modesty and the audience. [...] No fight in the prize rings of New York or Boston ever witnessed better sparring. It was a battle to the finish; bloody noses and howls of laughter from the Indians all the while it lasted. [...] When they were exhausted and their dad stopped the fight, the old chief ordered that they both be adopted into the tribe as worthy of membership in [...] "The Nation of the Fighting Sioux." ...|$|E
