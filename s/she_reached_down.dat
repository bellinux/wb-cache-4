5000|$|Francine was {{featured}} in two episodes of Batman: The Animated Series voiced by Meredith MacRae. She {{was featured}} in the first episode [...] "On Leather Wings" [...] where she met Bruce Wayne with her father and Kirk. She later witnesses a fight break out between her transformed husband and Batman. Afterwards Batman is able to create an antidote to turn Kirk back to normal and returns him to her. The episode [...] "Terror in the Sky" [...] is loosely based on the comic book [...] "Man-Bat Over Vegas", although the setting has been changed to Gotham Harbor and Francine is not portrayed as a Vampire Bat. In keeping with the family-friendly nature of the show, Francine is instead made into a monstrous fruit-bat, but otherwise {{much of the rest}} of the story remains the same. Batman suspects Man-Bat has returned to Gotham, when he begins to receive reports of a giant man-sized bat terrorizing the Gotham docking area. Langstrom's wife, Francine, expresses concern over her own safety, and informs Kirk that she will not put up with his experiments anymore. After she leaves, Batman arrives and informs Kirk that he is a suspect. Langstrom questions whether or not the antidote has actually made his transformations unstable, believing that he might be transforming into Man-Bat against his will. Batman demands to take a sample of his blood to test it. As Batman is leaving, he encounters the terrifying giant bat, and after the ensuring fight, Batman is lucky to find a lock of the Bat's hair has been caught in his suit. After comparing the DNA, Batman discovers Langstrom is innocent, and informs him that another unknown person is using his Man-bat formula. Langstrom informs Batman that his wife, Francine, has left him, worried for her safety, and is about to board a plane leaving Gotham. Searching though the files, Batman then discovers, to his horror, that Francine's father, Dr. March, has recreated the Man-Bat mutagen, working at night on his own. He tells Batman that he has refined it, and made it more powerful. When Batman asks where the new batch is, Dr March reveals it was accidentally destroyed but that he will use the improved formula to recreate it. He explains that in the middle of his work, he was startled by Francine, and dropped the beaker of the substance on the floor. Before March could react, <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> to clean up the substance, and pricked her finger on the broken glass. But Dr March now realizes she was infected and that he has turned Francine into a monstrous She-Bat. Repentant, he finally sets fire to his Man-Bat research. Realizing the danger that Kirk is in, Batman rushes to the Batwing. On board the plane, Kirk makes up with Francine, revealing to her that he isn't the creature. Francine begins getting a headache, and makes her way to the bathroom, where she transforms into She-Bat. She rips apart the airplane, kicking out the cabin door, and grabs Kirk. As Batman arrives in the Batwing, he sees She-Bat take off for the top of the Gotham Bridge. She drops an unconscious Kirk on the top of the tower, and fights Batman. He manages to inject her with the antidote, and after sending Batman to the floor, she painfully transforms back into Francine. Unaware of where she is or what is happening, she sees Kirk unconscious and walks towards him, but looks down and suffers from vertigo. Batman is helplessly too far away. But Kirk begins to revive, and wakes just in time to save Francine from falling off the tower. As Batman departs, Kirk reassures Francine that [...] "the Nightmare's finally over".|$|E
