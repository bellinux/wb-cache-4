25|$|Solar {{cells can}} be {{classified}} into first, second and third generation cells. The first generation cells—also called conventional, traditional or wafer-based cells—are made of crystalline silicon, the commercially predominant PV technology, that includes materials such as polysilicon and monocrystalline silicon. Second generation cells are thin film solar cells, that include amorphous silicon, CdTe and CIGS cells and are commercially significant in utility-scale photovoltaic power stations, building integrated photovoltaics or in <b>small</b> <b>stand-alone</b> power system. The third generation of solar cells includes a number of thin-film technologies often described as emerging photovoltaics—most of them {{have not yet been}} commercially applied and are still in the research or development phase. Many use organic materials, often organometallic compounds as well as inorganic substances. Despite the fact that their efficiencies had been low and the stability of the absorber material was often too short for commercial applications, {{there is a lot of}} research invested into these technologies as they promise to achieve the goal of producing low-cost, high-efficiency solar cells.|$|E

40|$|When two sellers {{negotiate}} {{terms of}} trade with a common buyer, {{the order in which}} the negotiations occur can affect the buyer's payoff. This suggests that the buyer may have preferences over which seller to negotiate with first. We find that when the efficient outcome calls for the buyer to purchase from only one seller, the buyer weakly prefers to negotiate first with the inefficient seller, and when the efficient outcome calls for the buyer to purchase from both sellers, the buyer prefers to negotiate first with the seller that has less bargaining power, or offers a <b>smaller</b> <b>stand-alone</b> surplus, all else being equal. These conclusions hold whether or not penalty clauses are feasible. Â© 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Forecasting {{models of}} the solar wind often rely on simple parameterizations of the {{magnetic}} field that ignore {{the effects of the}} full magnetic field geometry. In this paper, we present the results of two solar wind prediction models that consider the full magnetic field profile and include the effects of Alfvén waves on coronal heating and wind acceleration. The one-dimensional MHD code ZEPHYR self-consistently finds solar wind solutions without the need for empirical heating functions. Another 1 D code, introduced in this paper (The Efficient Modified-Parker-Equation-Solving Tool, TEMPEST), can act as a <b>smaller,</b> <b>stand-alone</b> code for use in forecasting pipelines. TEMPEST is written in Python and will become a publicly available library of functions that is easy to adapt and expand. We discuss important relations between the magnetic field profile and properties of the solar wind {{that can be used to}} independently validate prediction models. ZEPHYR provides the foundation and calibration for TEMPEST, and ultimately we will use these models to predict observations and explain space weather created by the bulk solar wind. We are able to reproduce with both models the general anticorrelation seen in comparisons of observed wind speed at 1 AU and the flux tube expansion factor. There is significantly less spread than comparing the results of the two models than between ZEPHYR and a traditional flux tube expansion relation. We suggest that the new code, TEMPEST, will become a valuable tool in the forecasting of space weather. 1...|$|R

40|$|We assess {{size and}} scope-related {{economies in the}} global {{advertising}} and marketing services business. A translog cost function is employed wherein a firmâ€™s costs vary according to its scale and two dimensions {{of the scope of}} its operations. One dimension of firm scope relates to how its output is distributed across the global markets it serves (domestic vs. overseas) and the other to how its output is distributed across the line of services it offers (advertising-related vs. other marketing services). Parameters of the model are estimated via three stage least squares using annual data (1989 - 2001) for an unbalanced panel consisting of the eight largest holding companies in this industry. A firmâ€™s total variable costs are affected by its scale, scope (mix of services and markets served), and by the interaction of the two dimensions of scope. The latter effect suggests that cost economies may accompany the dual diversification strategy of jointly offering advertising and marketing services globally. Estimates indicate that the industryâ€™s long-run cost function is subject to very slight economies of scale, i. e., total variable costs increase less than proportionally as outputs increase. Consistent with the presence of modest global scale economies, product-specific diseconomies of scale accompany growth in volume obtained by extending either breadth of service offerings or market coverage. Scope economies arise when cost savings can be realized by a single firm jointly producing several services or jointly serving multiple markets as compared to splitting up the firm into <b>smaller,</b> <b>stand-alone</b> entities, each one producing just one service or serving a single market. A small cost advantage, typically of approximately two percent, is uniformly associated with joint production of services for both the domestic and overseas markets. Cost savings of a similar magnitude arise consistently from the joint production of advertising as well as other marketing services.

40|$|The Multimodal Transportation Educational Virtual Appliance (MTEVA) is an {{application}} developed {{within the framework}} of the broader Coastal Science Educational Virtual Appliance (CSEVA) to enhance coastal resiliency through the integration of coastal science and transportation congestion models for emergency situations. The first generation MTEVA enabled users to perform and visualize simulations using an integrated storm surge and inundation model (CH 3 D-SSMS) and transportation evacuation/return modeling system that supports contraflow in a simple synthetic domain (order of tens of intersections/roads) under tropical storm conditions. In this study, the second generation MTEVA has been advanced to apply storm surge and evacuation models to the greater Jacksonville area of Northeast Florida (order tens of thousands of transportation intersections/roads). To support solving the evacuation problem with a significantly larger transportation network, new models have been developed, including a heuristic capable of efficiently solving large-scale problems. After initial testing on several <b>smaller</b> <b>stand-alone</b> transportation networks (e. g., Anaheim, Winnipeg), the heuristic is applied to the Jacksonville area transportation network. Results presented show the heuristic produces a nearly optimal (average optimality gap < 0. 5 %) solution in 90 % less wall clock time than needed by the exact solver. The MTEVA’s new capabilities are then demonstrated through the simulation of a Hurricane Katrina-sized storm impacting the region and studying how the evacuation patterns are affected by the closing of roads due to flooding and bridges due to high winds. To ensure residents are able to leave the area, evacuations are shown to need to have begun at least 36 h prior to landfall. Additionally it was shown that large numbers of residents would be left behind if evacuation does not begin within 18 h of landfall and ~ 97 % would not escape if evacuation did not begin until landfall, when areas of the coast that are the most prone to flooding are already cut off from the “safe” nodes of the transportation network...|$|R

40|$|Hybrid rockets motors provide {{distinct}} safety advantages {{when compared}} to traditional liquid or solid propellant systems, due to the inherent stability and relative inertness of the propellants prior to established combustion. As {{a result of this}} inherent propellant stability, hybrid motors have historically proven dicult to ignite. State of the art hybrid igniter designs continue to require solid or liquid reactants distinct from the main propellants. These ignition methods however, reintroduce to the hybrid propulsion system the safety and complexity disadvantages associated with traditional liquid or solid propellants. The results of this study demonstrate the feasibility of a novel direct electrostatic arc ignition method for hybrid motors. A series of <b>small</b> prototype <b>stand-alone</b> thrusters demonstrating this technology were successfully designed and tested using Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) plastic and Gaseous Oxygen (GOX) as propellants. Measurements of input voltage and current demonstrated that arc-ignition will occur using as little as 10 watts peak power and less than 5 joules total energy. The motor developed for the <b>stand-alone</b> <b>small</b> thruster was adapted as a gas generator to ignite a medium-scale hybrid rocket motor using nitrous oxide /and HTPB as propellants.

40|$|Although {{diffusion}} theory predicts that IMS resolving power increases with the square {{root of the}} voltage applied across the drift tube, in practice, there exists an optimum voltage above which resolving power decreases. This optimum voltage {{was determined to be}} both compound and initial ion pulse width dependent.

Using four common environmental contaminants (trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, methyl tert-butyl ether, methyl isobutyl ketone), diffusion-limited (theoretical), Rd, conditional, Rc, and actual (or measured), Rm, IMS resolving powers were determined and compared for a small IMS instrument designed for subsurface measurements. Detection limits determined at the optimal resolving power for the environmental contaminants ranged from 18 parts per trillion volume-to-volume (pptv) to 80 parts per billion volume-to-volume (ppbv). The maximal measured resolving power for our <b>small,</b> ambient-pressure <b>stand-alone</b> IMS ranged from 42 to 54, yielding an IMS resolving power efficiency, defined as Rm/Rc × 100 %, of 56 − 74 % of the maximal conditional resolving power possible...|$|R
