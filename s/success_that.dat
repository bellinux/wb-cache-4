5|$|Seattle {{achieved}} sufficient economic <b>success</b> <b>that</b> {{when the}} Great Seattle Fire of 1889 destroyed the central business district, a far grander city-center rapidly emerged in its place.

5|$|The {{war was a}} {{transformative}} {{experience for}} Truman that brought out his leadership qualities. He had entered the service in 1917 as a family farmer who had worked in clerical jobs that did not require the ability to motivate and direct others, but during the war he gained leadership experience and a record of <b>success</b> <b>that</b> greatly enhanced and supported his post-war political career in Missouri.|$|E

5|$|Two {{years passed}} {{before the next}} attempt on the Ostend locks. The First Ostend Raid was {{conducted}} {{in tandem with the}} similar Zeebrugge Raid led by Acting Vice-Admiral Roger Keyes on 23 April 1918; a large scale operation to block the wider canal at Zeebrugge. Both attacks largely failed, but while at Zeebrugge the operation came so close to <b>success</b> <b>that</b> it took several months for the British authorities to realise that it had been unsuccessful, at Ostend the attack had ended catastrophically. Both blockships intended to close off the canal had grounded over half a mile from their intended location and been scuttled by their crews under heavy artillery and long-range small arms fire, which caused severe casualties. Thus while Zeebrugge seemed to be blocked entirely, Ostend was open wide, nullifying any <b>success</b> <b>that</b> might have been achieved at the other port.|$|E
5|$|When {{vineyards}} in the south-west Cape started letting weeds grow between vines {{to conserve}} moisture, around 1956, the Cape sparrow moved in. Cape sparrows quickly exhausted {{the seeds and}} started eating the grapes. The Cape sparrow is now a serious pest in vineyards. However, vineyards are not optimal habitat: some populations have had such a low reproductive <b>success</b> <b>that</b> {{they could not be}} maintained without immigration.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possible}} {{indicator of}} Chnodomar's numbers is size of forces considered necessary by the Roman government {{to deal with}} the Alamanni threat in Gaul: 40,000 (Julian's 15,000 plus Barbatio's 25,000). Assuming that the Roman military planners would have sought a 2 to 1 superiority to guarantee <b>success,</b> <b>that</b> would imply an Alamannic strength in Alsace of about 20,000. On the basis of these indicators, the midpoint between the recent estimate and Ammianus' figure, 25,000, would seem plausible.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{formation}} of the Third Coalition, Napoleon had assembled an invasion force, called the Armée d'Angleterre (Army of England) around six camps at Boulogne in Northern France. He intended to use this invasion force to strike at England, and was so confident of <b>success</b> <b>that</b> he had commemorative medals struck to celebrate the conquest of the English. Although they never invaded, Napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for any possible military operation. Boredom among the troops occasionally set in, but Napoleon paid many visits and conducted lavish parades in order to boost morale.|$|E

The three then moved to Los Angeles in pursuit of new opportunities, but did not find the amount of <b>success</b> <b>that</b> they had expected.|$|E
5|$|Clarke {{began writing}} Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell in 1992; {{ten years later}} she {{submitted}} the manuscript for publication. It was accepted by Bloomsbury and published in September 2004, with illustrations by Portia Rosenberg. Bloomsbury were so sure of its <b>success</b> <b>that</b> they printed 250,000 hardcover copies. The novel was well received by critics and reached number three on the New York Times best-seller list. It was longlisted for the 2004 Man Booker Prize and won the 2005 Hugo Award for Best Novel.|$|E

5|$|Despite the UERL's {{success in}} {{financing}} and constructing the Hampstead Railway in only seven years, its opening {{was not the}} financial <b>success</b> <b>that</b> had been expected. In the Hampstead Tube's first twelve months of operation it carried 25million passengers, just half of the 50million that had been predicted during the planning of the line. The UERL's pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers for its other new lines proved to be greatly over-optimistic, as did the improvement in passenger numbers expected on the newly electrified MDR – in each case achieving only around fifty per cent of their targets.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the slow}} start, Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light proved {{enough of a}} <b>success</b> <b>that</b> a new game was commissioned. This would become Fire Emblem Gaiden, which {{released}} in 1992. Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light was partially remade {{as part of the}} 1994 release , which also continued the story of Marth. A full remake for the Nintendo DS was later developed. It would release internationally under the title , marking the first time the content of the first Fire Emblem was made available outside Japan. The setting of Archanea would later be used again in the 2012/3 entry Fire Emblem Awakening.|$|E
5|$|Donkey Kong is a {{video game}} series created by game {{designer}} Shigeru Miyamoto. It is published by Nintendo, with entries in the series developed by Nintendo, Rare, Namco, Retro Studios, and Paon. The series debuted in 1981 with the arcade game Donkey Kong, which was a sales <b>success</b> <b>that</b> brought Nintendo into the North American market. Most Donkey Kong games have either been arcade games or released for Nintendo consoles and handhelds dating from the Nintendo Entertainment System to {{the current generation of}} video game consoles. However, some of the original arcade games were ported into versions on third-party home consoles and developed by several companies. Donkey Kong is among the best-selling video game franchises, with more than 48 million games sold worldwide.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to normal flight controls, the Harrier has a lever for controlling {{the direction of}} the four vectoring nozzles. It is viewed by senior RAF officers as a significant design <b>success,</b> <b>that</b> to enable and control the aircraft's vertical flight required only a single lever added in the cockpit. For horizontal flight, the nozzles are directed rearwards by shifting the lever to the forward position; for short or vertical takeoffs and landings, the lever is pulled back to point the nozzles downwards.|$|E
