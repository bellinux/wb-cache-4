'I hope {{he will have}} {{disposed}} of it by the morning; I start next Tuesday week; I would not go later for the universe; we shall be {{just in time for}} the summer in its beauty, and to have a peep at <b>Switzerland.</b> We <b>shall</b> not have time for Mont Blanc, without rattling faster than any man in his senses would do. I do not mean to leave any place till I have thoroughly seen twice over everything worth seeing that it contains.' ...|$|R
6000|$|One morning, while Rollo and Jennie were {{at breakfast}} {{with their father}} and mother, Rollo's uncle George {{came in and said}} that he had {{concluded}} to go and make a little tour in <b>Switzerland.</b> [...] "I <b>shall</b> have three weeks," [...] said he, [...] "if I can get away to-morrow; and that will give me time to take quite a little run among the mountains. I have come now to see if you will let Rollo go with me." ...|$|R
5000|$|Then, if the {{beneficial}} owner {{would like to}} use the reduced rate under GR-CH double tax treaty (10%), he would have to file a refund claim to the Swiss tax authorities. That claim would have to be accompanied by a certificate of tax residence issued by the Greek tax authorities. When requesting this certificate, {{the beneficial}} owner is effectively signalling to the Greek tax authorities {{the fact that he has}} earned or will earn income from a foreign source. Once he has filed the refund claim to the Swiss authorities, the Greek beneficial owner will be entitled to a refund for the difference between the anticipatory tax (500*0.35=175) and the maximum tax under the double tax treaty (500*0.10=50), which is 175-50=125. So, the actual tax burden in Switzerland after the application of the refund procedure is EUR 50. Now if the Greek domestic tax on the inbound interest income is 10%, it would in principle be levied on a gross basis, i.e. the tax base would be the full amount of interest income received (EUR 500). The Greek tax liability would be 500*0.10=50. However, under Art. 22 of the GR-CH Double tax treaty [...] "Where a resident of Greece derives income which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention may be taxed in <b>Switzerland,</b> Greece <b>shall</b> allow as a deduction from the tax on the income of that resident an amount equal to the income tax paid in <b>Switzerland.</b> Such deduction <b>shall</b> not, however, exceed that part of the Greek tax, as computed before the deduction is given, which is attributable to the income which may be taxed in Switzerland." [...] The Greek beneficial owner would therefore be entitled to credit the EUR 50 levied in Switzerland against his tax liability in Greece, which is also EUR 50. Therefore, after the application of the credit, the Greek beneficial owner would not owe any Greek tax on that interest income.|$|R

'Oh, my dear, don't ask: I haven't known a happy hour since you left me in <b>Switzerland.</b> Lois, I <b>shall</b> never be happy again without you! It would pay me {{to give you a}} retaining fee of a thousand a year--honour bright, it would, I assure you. What I've suffered from the Gretchens since you've been in the East has only been equalled by what I've suffered from the Mary Annes and the CÃ©lestines. Not a hair left on my scalp; not one hair, I declare to you. They've made my head into a tabula rasa for the various restorers. George R. Sims and Mrs. S. A. Allen are going to fight it out between them. My dear, I wish you could take my maid's place; I've always said----' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am very glad," [...] said Mr. George. [...] "I {{wished to}} see one very much. We will go and see it {{immediately}} after breakfast. But now {{let me tell you}} a little more about the country. You must not imagine that the northern slope, as I called it, is one smooth and uniform surface of descending land. There are mountains, and valleys, and lakes, and precipices, and waterfalls, and every other variety of mountain scenery scattered all over it, making it a most picturesque and romantic region. It is, however, on the whole, a slope. It begins with comparatively smooth and level land on the north and it terminates in a range of lofty mountain crests on the south; and you have to go over this crest somewhere, by some of the steep and difficult passes that cross it, to get into the central valley. We are on the margin of this slope now. When we leave here and strike into the heart of <b>Switzerland</b> we <b>shall</b> be gradually ascending it. I am going first to a place called Interlachen, which is in a deep valley far up this slope, just under the ridge of mountains. Interlachen is surrounded, in fact, by mountains, and a great many pleasant excursions can be made from it. We shall stop there a few days and make excursions, and then cross over by some of the mountain passes into the valley." ...|$|R
