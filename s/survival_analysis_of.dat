40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{recently}} published PROGgene, {{a tool that}} can be used to study prognostic implications of genes in various cancers. The first version of the tool had several areas for improvement. In this paper we present some major enhancements we have made on the existing tool in the new version, PROGgeneV 2. RESULTS: In PROGgeneV 2, we have made several modifications to enhance <b>survival</b> <b>analysis</b> capability <b>of</b> the tool. First, we have increased the repository of public studies catalogued in our tool by almost two folds. We have also added additional functionalities to perform <b>survival</b> <b>analysis</b> in a variety <b>of</b> new ways. <b>Survival</b> <b>analysis</b> can now be performed on a) single genes b) multiple genes as a signature, c) ratio of expression of two genes, and d) curated/published gene signatures in new version. Users can now also adjust the <b>survival</b> <b>analysis</b> models for available covariates. Users can study prognostic implications of entire gene signatures in different cancer types, which are searchable by keywords. Also, unique to our tool, in the new version, users will be able to upload and use their own datasets to perform <b>survival</b> <b>analysis</b> on genes <b>of</b> interest. CONCLUSIONS: We believe, like its predecessor, PROGGeneV 2 will continue to be useful for the scientific community for formulating research hypotheses and designing mechanistic studies. With added datasets PROGgeneV 2 is the most comprehensive <b>survival</b> <b>analysis</b> tool available. PROGgeneV 2 is available at [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Fatigue and rutting are {{two primary}} failure {{mechanisms}} in asphalt pavements. The evaluations of fatigue and rutting performances are significantly uncertain due to large uncertainties {{involved with the}} traffic and pavement life parameters. Therefore, deterministically it is inadequate to predict when an in-service pavement would fail. Thus, the deterministic failure time which is known as design life (yr) of pavement becomes random in nature. Reliability analysis of such time (t) dependent random variable is the <b>survival</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> the structure. This paper presents the <b>survival</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> fatigue and rutting failures in asphalt pavement structures. It is observed that the survival of pavements with time can be obtained using the bathtub concept that contains a constant failure rate period and an increasing failure rate period. The survival function (S(t)), probability density function (pdf), and probability distribution function (PDF) of failure time parameter are derived using bathtub analysis. It is seen that the distribution of failure time follows three parametric Weibull distributions.
