5|$|When Me and Juliet began tryout {{performances}} in Cleveland, the duo {{realized that the}} show had problems with the plot and staging. Extensive revisions during the remaining Cleveland and Boston tryouts failed to cure the difficulties with the plot, which the critics considered weak and uninteresting. The show was met with less than favorable reviews, though Mielziner's staging won praise from audience and critics. The show closed once it had exhausted its advance sales. According to Bill Hayes the show's star in his autobiography Like Sands Through the Hourglass published in 2005 he says' We played nearly five hundred performances, all to full houses. Production costs were paid off and substantial profits went into the R till. So, though {{not in the same}} category as the storied five that were made into films - Oklahoma!, Carousel, South Pacific, The King and I and The Sound of Music - our show must be considered a success. With the exception of a short run in Chicago, there was no national tour, and the show has seldom been seen.

25|$|Tube {{drawing is}} a process to size a tube by {{shrinking}} a large diameter tube into a smaller one, by drawing the tube through a die. This process produces high-quality tubing with precise dimensions, good surface finish, and the added strength of cold working. For this reason this process is established for many materials, namely metalworking but also glass. Because it is so versatile, tube drawing is suitable for both large- and <b>small-scale</b> <b>production.</b> The large-scale production of glass typically uses a one step process where glass is directly drawn into a tube from a melting tank.|$|E

25|$|By {{the start}} of the 19th century, the aim of Hungary's {{agricultural}} producers had shifted from subsistence farming and <b>small-scale</b> <b>production</b> for local trade to cash-generating, large-scale production for a wider market. Road and waterway improvements cut transportation costs, while urbanization in Austria, Bohemia, and Moravia and the need for supplies for the Napoleonic wars boosted demand for foodstuffs and clothing. Hungary became a major grain and wool exporter. New lands were cleared, and yields rose as farming methods improved. Hungary did not reap the full benefit of the boom, however, because most of the profits went to the magnates, who considered them not as capital for investment but as a means of adding luxury to their lives. As expectations rose, goods such as linen and silverware, once considered luxuries, became necessities. The wealthy magnates had little trouble balancing their earnings and expenditures, but many lesser nobles, fearful of losing their social standing, went into debt to finance their spending.|$|E
25|$|In the {{traditional}} Bordeaux blend, Merlot's {{role is to}} add body and softness. Despite accounting for 50-60% of overall plantings in Bordeaux, the grape tends to account {{for an average of}} 25% of the blends — especially in the Bordeaux wine regions of Graves and Médoc. Of these Left Bank regions, the commune of St-Estephe uses the highest percentage of Merlot in the blends. However, Merlot is much more prominent on the Right Bank of the Gironde in the regions of Pomerol and Saint-Émilion, where it will commonly comprise the majority of the blend. One of the most famous and rare wines in the world, Château Pétrus, is almost all Merlot. In Pomerol, where Merlot usually accounts for around 80% of the blend, the iron-clay soils of the region give Merlot more of a tannic backbone than what is found in other Bordeaux regions. It was in Pomerol that the garagistes movement began with <b>small-scale</b> <b>production</b> of highly sought after Merlot-based wines. In the sandy, clay-limestone-based soils of Saint-Émilion, Merlot accounts for around 60% of the blend and is usually blended with Cabernet Franc. In limestone, Merlot tends to develop more perfume notes while in sandy soils the wines are generally softer than Merlot grown in clay dominant soils.|$|E

500|$|Lê Duẩn {{departed}} from Marxist/Leninist orthodoxy {{when it came}} to practical policy and stated that the country had to [...] "carry out agricultural cooperation immediately, even before having built large industry." [...] While he acknowledged that his view was heresy, Lê Duẩn insisted that Vietnam was in a unique situation; [...] "It seems that no country so far in history has been in a situation such as ours. We must lead the peasantry and agriculture immediately to socialism, without waiting for a developed industry, though we know very well that without the strong impact of industry, agriculture cannot achieve large-scale production and new relations of agriculture cannot be consolidated... To proceed from <b>small-scale</b> <b>production</b> to large-scale production is a new one." [...] According to Lê Duẩn the key to socialism was not mechanisation and industrialisation, but a new division of labour. He also believed that cooperatives {{did not need to be}} autarkic, but rather [...] "organically connected, through the process of production itself, with other cooperatives and with the state economic sector." [...] Vietnam could achieve this through state intervention and control. He saw the economy as one whole directed by the state and not many parts intertwined.|$|E

500|$|Despite the scholar-officials' {{suspicion}} and disdain for powerful merchants, the latter often colluded with the scholarly elite. The scholar-officials themselves often {{became involved in}} mercantile affairs, blurring the lines of who did and {{did not belong to}} the merchant class. Even rural farmers engaged in the <b>small-scale</b> <b>production</b> of wine, charcoal, paper, textiles, and other goods. Theoretically it was forbidden for an official to partake in private affairs of gaining capital while serving and receiving a salary from the state. In order to avoid ruining one's reputation as a moral Confucian, scholar-officials had to work through business intermediaries; as early as 955 a written decree revealed the use of intermediary agents for private business transactions with foreign countries. Since the Song government took over several key industries and imposed strict state monopolies, the government itself acted as a large commercial enterprise run by scholar-officials. The state also had to contend with the merchant and artisan guilds; whenever the state requisitioned goods and assessed taxes it dealt with guild heads, who ensured fair prices and fair wages via official intermediaries. Yet joining a guild was an immediate means to neither empowerment nor independence; historian Jacques Gernet states: [...] " [...] were too numerous and too varied to allow their influence to be felt." ...|$|E
500|$|The Devil You Know, a <b>small-scale</b> <b>production</b> that Lawrence had filmed for in 2005, was {{her first}} release of 2013.

While performing the film's underwater stunts, she suffered from an ear infection {{that resulted in a}} brief loss of hearing. With box office earnings of $864.9 million, the film remains her highest-grossing release. Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice believed that Lawrence's portrayal of Everdeen made her an ideal role model, and wrote that [...] "there's no sanctimony or pretense of false modesty in the way Lawrence plays her". She took on a supporting role in Russell's ensemble crime drama American Hustle (2013) as Rosalyn Rosenfeld, the neurotic wife of con man Irving Rosenfeld (portrayed by Christian Bale). Inspired by the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Abscam sting operation, the film is set against the backdrop of political corruption in 1970s New Jersey. Lawrence did little research for the part, and based her performance on knowledge of the era from the films and television shows she had seen. Geoffrey Macnab of The Independent praised her as [...] "funny and acerbic", especially for an improvised scene in which she aggressively kisses her husband's mistress (played by Amy Adams) on the lips. Lawrence's performance won her the Golden Globe and BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actress, in addition to a third Academy Award nomination, her first in the supporting category.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Dev. Studies) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2004. This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate viability and sustainability of commercial <b>small-scale</b> timber <b>production.</b> Random mushrooming and proliferation of <b>small-scale</b> timber <b>production</b> in KwaZulu-Natal and the lack of available literature on how small-growers perceive sustainability of their own practice prompted the study. Entembeni, a rural community located in northern KwaZulu-Natal, was selected for the study. High levels of illiteracy and increasing unemployment levels characterize the area. Based on a qualitative research design a stratified, random sampling was used to select a representative sample. While an understanding of <b>small-scale</b> timber <b>production</b> tends to focus on smallscale growers as the main role-players, government structures, commercial timber farmers, and contractors {{play a significant role in}} regulating and transforming timber production respectively. The study found that <b>small-scale</b> timber <b>production</b> is either hindered or enhanced by the nature and effectiveness of existing institutional arrangements. Distribution of assets is characterized by social inequality based on gender and social status. It was also found that small-growers lack the necessary skills, expertise, land and infrastructure to effectively participate in commercial timber production. Partnerships with the private sector (in the form of contract farming) ensure that small-growers have access to loans, expertise and the markets. Small-growers who are motivated by the prospects of increased income and entrepreneurial development, fail to reach anticipated targets. Reasons for this are numerous. Some small-growers operate in areas of land too small to yield the desired outcomes. Inability for value adding and reliance on large-scale growers and contractors for loans and harvesting and transportation services contributes to small-growers inability to maximize benefits. The study concluded that <b>small-scale</b> timber <b>production</b> in its current state at Entembeni is not viable or sustainable. Viability and sustainability of <b>small-scale</b> timber <b>production</b> can be enhanced through a holistic land use plan and management that provides alternative land use options, not just timber production...|$|R
