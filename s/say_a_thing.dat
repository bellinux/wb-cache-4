2500|$|Four {{days before}} polling {{day of the}} 1991 general election, Jufrie Mahmood, a {{candidate}} for the Workers' Party of Singapore, mentioned at a rally on 27 August 1991 that he opposed the MRHA which aimed to separate religion and politics. He said: [...] "Now, the imams of mosques who deliver sermons must feel disturbed but they can't <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> against Government policy for under the Maintenance of Religious Harmony law, if they touch on the issue of lewd movies, they can be in for trouble. That's the reason why I oppose." [...] In response, the Minister for Community Development Wong Kan Seng said that there was nothing preventing religious leaders from advising their congregations not to watch R-rated films, and, in their individual capacity, it was open to them to write to the Ministry of Information and the Arts to express their disapproval of such films. However, the Act prevented them from inciting their congregants to oppose the Government on the issue. Wong also said that Jufrie had mentioned imams to talk about a secular issue and incite Malay feelings against the Government.|$|E

6000|$|... "A sort of {{entertainment}} where everybody eats {{too much and}} talks all the time without ever <b>saying</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> that's worth hearing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There!" [...] said Mr. Bennett. [...] "You hear? And when Henry Mortimer <b>says</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing,</b> it's so. There's nobody's word I'd take before Henry Mortimer's." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who {{said there}} WAS? What {{do you talk}} to me like that for, Huck Finn? You wait till I <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing's</b> got sense in it before you go to accusing me of saying it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must go to}} my tent," [...] she gasped. [...] "I am all wet. Now {{promise me}} {{that you will not}} <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> or do a thing until I see you again. Promise!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not me," [...] {{said the}} seaman bluntly. [...] "When I <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> I stick to it. I don’t haggle, and haggle, and—" [...] he {{paused a moment}} for a word, [...] "and haggle," [...] he concluded.|$|E
6000|$|... "That won't be comfortable. See {{and come}} with me if you can. Now, good-night, my dear fellow, and {{remember}} this,--when I <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> I mean it. I think I may boast that I never yet went back from my word." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, and he flatly {{refused to}} sell it. I'm really sorry, Ian, {{but you know}} how {{determined}} my father is. Once he <b>says</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> he sticks to it, even though it should be to his own disadvantage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O Mr. Stacey, I do {{hope you}} can patch things up here. If you could only touch his heart! He don't mean to do wrong, but he's so set in his ways--if he <b>says</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> he sticks to it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Bolton!" [...] shouted Annie, in a {{voice so}} deep and hoarse that it shook {{the heart of a}} woman who had never known fear of man. [...] "If you <b>say</b> such <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> to me--if you ever <b>say</b> such <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> again--I--I--I will hit you! Send Mr. Bolton for Idella's things--right away!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That," [...] said Coulthurst, [...] "gives you {{a little}} to go upon. We can admit that Tomlinson fancied he had a {{grievance}} against the trooper. He is not the man to <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> of that kind without sufficient reason." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Colonel, I've {{never seen}} a man that I've had such {{unbounded}} confidence in as you. When you <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> right out, I always feel as if that ends it; as if that is evidence, and proof, and everything else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> {{about it}} until some time when Granny scolds me for being careless," [...] muttered Reddy, with a sly grin. [...] "Then I'll see {{what she has to}} say. I guess she won't scold me so much after this." ...|$|E
6000|$|Coomb-Firtrees {{say that}} Life is a moan, [...] And Clyffe-hill Clump says [...] "Yea!" [...] But Yell'ham <b>says</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> of its own: [...] It's not [...] "Gray, gray [...] Is Life alway!" [...] That Yell'ham says, [...] Nor that Life is for ends unknown.|$|R
60|$|But {{if he is}} able {{to answer}} them satisfactorily to his own conscience, by all means let him begin. He may at once put aside all anxiety about style; that is <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> that will take care of itself; it will be added unto him if he really has {{something}} to say; for style is only a man's way of <b>saying</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|R
60|$|TENCH. Excuse me for <b>saying</b> such <b>a</b> <b>thing.</b> I {{was only}} {{thinking}} of you, sir.|$|R
6000|$|... "I’m {{not going}} to," [...] {{said the other}} shortly. [...] "I’m a {{determined}} man, and when I <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> I mean it. It’s going to be broken to her gradual, as I said; I don’t {{want her to be}} scared, poor thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|Peter put {{his foot}} down. [...] "When I <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing,</b> I mean a thing. The sooner you {{understand}} that, the better. How dare you argue with me! Fiddle-de-dee!" [...] For two pins Peter would have employed an expletive even stronger, so determined was he feeling.|$|E
6000|$|She laughed, in glad {{defiance}} {{of her own}} consciousness. [...] "Well, I {{was trying to make}} you compliment me; I'm not going to deny it. But I must say I got my come-uppance: you didn't <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> I cared for. But you did afterward. Don't you remember?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Such {{a thrill}} as {{went up and}} down my back, Marilla! I don't think I'd ever really {{believed}} until then that there was honestly going to be a picnic. I couldn't help fearing I'd only imagined it. But when <b>a</b> minister <b>says</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> in the pulpit you just have to believe it." ...|$|R
60|$|When {{they were}} quite done, Dick {{took it upon himself}} to <b>say</b> <b>a</b> few <b>things.</b>|$|R
60|$|MY mother {{immediately}} began to cry, and wondered how Peggotty dared to <b>say</b> such <b>a</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{this time}} it's in our relations, yours and mine," [...] Verena replied, {{in a tone}} in which only Verena could <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> like that. [...] "You ought {{to see how she}} throws herself into them. She is sure it will all work round for your good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, write it, then," [...] she said, {{throwing}} {{down the}} pen. [...] "I don't {{ask you to}} dictate it. Write it,--write anything,--just in pencil, you know; that won't commit you to anything; they <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> in pencil isn't legal,--and I'll copy {{it out in the}} first person." ...|$|E
60|$|CROFTS. No; and to {{tell you}} the honest truth I don't want to be either. But when I <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> I mean it; and when I feel a {{sentiment}} I feel it in earnest; and what I value I pay hard money for. Thats the sort of man I am.|$|E
50|$|According to Maimonides, {{this is only}} a {{mark the}} sages gave for memory. Kuzari <b>says</b> <b>a</b> similar <b>thing.</b>|$|R
60|$|Was {{not this}} a graceful little ovation? Where this people finds {{the secret of}} its pretty speeches, I cannot imagine; unless the secret should be no other than a sincere desire to please! But then no disgrace is {{attached}} in France to <b>saying</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> neatly; whereas in England to talk like a book is to give in one's resignation to society.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a splendid}} morning; and Dan turned up, to my surprise--though I {{might have known}} that when he <b>says</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing,</b> he does it. John Ford came out {{to shake hands with}} him, then, remembering why he had come, breathed loudly, said nothing, and went in again. Nothing was to be seen of Pasiance, and we went down to the beach together.|$|R
60|$|I {{suppose you}} do not require to be told the reason of the {{determination}} I have come to. You cannot have forgotten the fair warning I gave you when we parted, and you must know, Fan, if you know me at all, that when I <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> I distinctly mean it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, you'll {{have to find}} out, my pretty one," [...] he said decisively, [...] "for it {{has got to be}} done somehow, or {{that gold}} watch we spoke of the other day will have to go to {{somebody}} else. And you know when I <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> I mean it. Eh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{care whether}} 'twas little or whether 'twas big; he's {{here in our}} house and a stranger, and it wasn't {{good of you to}} say it. If you was in his place it would make you feel ashamed; and so you oughtn't to <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> to another person that will make THEM feel ashamed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, but there's such <b>a</b> {{difference}} between <b>saying</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> yourself and hearing {{other people say}} it," [...] wailed Anne. [...] "You may know <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> is so, but you can't help hoping other people don't quite think it is. I suppose you think I have an awful temper, but I couldn't help it. When she said those things something just rose right up in me and choked me. I HAD to fly out at her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then it was {{not telling}} a lie, Dwight. A lie is told with an {{intention}} to deceive. To make it a lie {{it is necessary that}} the person who <b>says</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing,</b> must know distinctly {{at the time that he}} says it, that it is not true; and he must say it with the particular intention to deceive. Now, Caleb did not do this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{were against}} our being married, {{and so they}} {{squeezed}} you out as it were. That is why you {{have been sent to}} this place. But they understand me now, and know what I am about. They have all given their consent, and the governor has promised to be liberal. When he <b>says</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> he'll do it. There will be lots of money." ...|$|R
