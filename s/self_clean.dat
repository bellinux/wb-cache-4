50|$|Yucca jaliscensis {{is a tall}} tree-like species. Although at old age it {{can grow}} up to 10 m in height, with a spread to 6 m, it is usually found at less than 7.5 m in height. It may have a {{somewhat}} thickened trunk base and it maybe single trunked {{or it can be}} mildly multitrunked. The usually short trunk base is often found at 0.5 to 2 feet wide, but can grow to over 4 or 5 feet in diameter on old specimens. There is usually around 5 to 8 branches growing upright off the short trunk with the leaves {{at the top of the}} trunks. The leaves are stiff to flexible, variably blue to green colored, strap-like, spineless, up to 1 m in length, and up to 8 cm in width. The old leaves usually <b>self</b> <b>clean</b> from the trunk over time. The branched, upright or sideways inclined inflorescence is 0.4 m to 1 m long, erect or with drooping fruit, canescent with blunt thick hairs to densely pubescent, filaments have blunt hairs and are pilose. The fruits are 4-5 cm in diameter. The ball-shaped white flowers bloom September to May or sometimes almost any time of the year. Flowers are 2-3.5 cm long and 1-1.5 cm wide.|$|E
30|$|The third {{possibility}} consists not in preventing, but {{in removing}} all unwanted fouling {{by creating a}} “self-cleaning” surface. The removal of foulers from so-called fouling-release coatings is achieved by the hydrodynamic drag caused by {{the movement of the}} vessel (Fig.  1 c). Such coatings are usually based on silicone elastomers or fluoropolymers which do not inhibit settlement of biofouling organisms and thus biomass accumulates. However, the weak attachment strength to these polymeric materials allows fast-moving ships to <b>self</b> <b>clean</b> simply by the shear force present during their movement through the ocean [13, 41 – 44]. Modern fouling-release coatings have self-cleaning ability even below 15 knots (e.g. Intersleek 900 requires > 10 knots, Hempasil X 3 87500 > 8 knots) [45]. Especially the combination of fouling-release with mechanical cleaning techniques such as hull grooming seem to be promising hybrid approaches for the future [46, 47].|$|E
40|$|Geckos, and {{specifically}} their feet, have attracted significant attention {{in recent times}} with the focus centred around their remarkable adhesional properties. Little attention however has been dedicated to the other remaining regions of the lizard body. In this paper we present preliminary investigations {{into a number of}} notable interfacial properties of the gecko skin focusing on solid and aqueous interactions. We show that the skin of the box-patterned gecko (Lucasium sp.) consists of dome shaped scales arranged in a hexagonal patterning. The scales comprise of spinules (hairs), from several hundred nanometres to several microns in length, with a sub-micron spacing and a small radius of curvature typically from 10 to 20 nm. This micro and nano structure of the skin exhibited ultralow adhesion with contaminating particles. The topography also provides a superhydrophobic, anti-wetting barrier which can <b>self</b> <b>clean</b> by the action of low velocity rolling or impacting droplets of various size ranges from microns to several millimetres. Water droplets which are sufficiently small (10 - 100 mu m) can easily access valleys between the scales for efficient self-cleaning and due to their dimensions can self-propel off the surface enhancing their mobility and cleaning effect. In addition, we demonstrate that the gecko skin has an antibacterial action where Gram-negative bacteria (Porphyromonas gingivalis) are killed when exposed to the surface however eukaryotic cell compatibility (with human stem cells) is demonstrated. The multifunctional features of the gecko skin provide a potential natural template for man-made applications where specific control of liquid, solid and biological contacts is required...|$|E
5000|$|Märklin three-rail trains use a short spike of DC voltage {{to reverse}} a relay within the {{locomotive}} {{while it is}} stopped. Märklin's track {{does not have an}} actual third rail; instead, a series of short pins provide the current, taken up by a long [...] "shoe" [...] under the engine. This shoe is long enough to always be in contact with several pins. This is known as the stud contact system and has certain advantages when used on outdoor model railway systems. The ski collector rubs over the studs and thus inherently <b>self</b> <b>cleans.</b> When both track rails are used for the return in parallel there is much less chance of current interruption due to dirt on the line.|$|R

40|$|Substance {{abuse is}} a global issue and {{treatment}} program retention rates are generally poor. The main goal {{of the current study}} was to assess whether implicit associations between <b>self</b> and being <b>clean</b> predict retention in drug treatment. In service of this goal we designed and employed an Implicit Association Test (IAT) {{to examine the relationship between}} implicit associations and drug treatment progression. Participants were also administered a series of explicit measures assessing their confidence to stay clean, the difficulty they were experiencing maintaining abstinence and their explicit identification with being clean. Participants were 135 clients residing in drug and alcohol treatment programs at Salvation Army centres in Queensland, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. Testing was conducted in two phases; during the first week of admission and then again 4 weeks later when participants progressed into the treatment phase of their rehabilitation. While scores on explicit measures changed across time as a result of treatment exposure none of these measures predicted treatment retention. Consistent with predictions, implicit associations between the <b>self</b> and being <b>clean</b> predicted treatment retention. More specifically, participants who implicitly associated the self more strongly with being clean at the 4 -week point of the study were less likely to drop out of treatment prematurely. A secondary investigation sought to assess the relationship between legal coercion and drug treatment retention. We found no difference in retention rates for voluntary and legally coerced participants. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings will be discussed...|$|R
30|$|In the beginning, air-jet {{textured}} yarns were produced by blowing {{a stream of}} air into twisted continuous filament yarns, while they were being overfed to the take-up bobbin (Wray & Entwistle 1968). Studies in the 1960 s by Wray and Entwistle (1969) were followed those by Sivakumar (1975) in the early 1970 s. Since 1980 s, researchers have mainly focused on investigating the effect of process parameters, nozzle geometry, and the air-flow behaviour on yarn texturing. Researchers (Acar 1988; Acar et al. 1986 b; Rangasamy et al. 1990) have studied the effect of filament fineness {{and concluded that the}} filaments with finer linear densities are more suitable for air-jet texturing due to their less bending and torsional stiffness that blow the filaments more easily that enhance the entanglement effectiveness. Supply yarn properties are important for texturing since resultant forces acting on filaments are determined by the fluid forces acting on the filaments (Acar 1991; Acar et al. 1986 b). Further Acar et al. (1986 c) found that the filament cross section also has direct influence on texturing and concluded that the non-circular filament cross sections have better filament texturing due to larger surface areas than the circular filament of equal linear density. Spin finish on filaments has a negative effect on the texturing process due to contamination of the texturing nozzle (Simmen 1987). However, researchers (Acar 1988; Acar & Demir 1987) dispute the above explanation and argued that most of the spin finish blow off from the filament due to the secondary air-low and the new jets are <b>self</b> <b>cleaned.</b> They suggest using a suitable spin-finish for air-jet texturing which removes them in filament wetting that improves the filament flexibility. Feeder yarn wetting was studied by many researchers (Acar & Demir 1987; Acar et al. 1986 d; Acar et al. 1986 a; Demir et al. 1988; Fisher & Wilson 1982; Kothari & Timble 1991) and reported that the feeder yarn wetting before the air-jet nozzle influence the stability of the texturing process as well as the textured yarn properties. Recent studies by Acar et al. (2006) reported that water acted as lubricant to reduce friction between the filaments in the air-jet texturing process. Study by Kothari et al. (1996) attempted to characterise the structure of air-jet {{textured yarns}} in terms of migration parameters. Since air-jet texturing process was developed to feed POY yarns, research were carried out by Sengupta et al. (1989) to understand the influence of drawing variables on the properties of air-jet textured yarns made from POY feeder yarns.|$|R
50|$|Many {{cultural}} differences exist on perceived color personality, meaning, and preference. When deciding on brand and product logos, companies should {{take into account}} their target consumer, since {{cultural differences}} exist. A study looked at color preference in British and Chinese participants. Each participant was presented {{with a total of}} 20 color swatches one at a time and had to rate the color on 10 different emotions. Results showed that British participants and Chinese participants differed on the like-dislike scale the most. Chinese participants tended to like colors that they <b>self</b> rated as <b>clean,</b> fresh, and modern, whereas British participants showed no such pattern. When evaluating purchasing intent, color preference affects buying behavior, where liked colors {{are more likely to be}} bought than disliked colors. This implies that companies should consider choosing their target consumer first and then make product colors based on the target's color preferences.|$|R
40|$|In {{our current}} focus,we {{researched}} into the applications of Cotton Fibers as probes and tags,we designed a simple experiment to tag DNA-Streptavidin Complex {{onto the surface}} of the bio-polished Purified Cotton Fiber(PCF) to develop a bio-polished PCF as a tag to detect or diagnose some target element. Also this kind of immobilization process helps us to design and develop future bio-medical textiles to help us in advancing medicine,using nano-bio materials. It is highly challenging to bind a heavy molecule,like DNA to Purified Cotton Fiber,without damaging its structure,we accomplished this task by using CBD. Hence we believe that our current novel research on bio-polished Purified Cotton Fibers,to turn them into probes and tags is one of the pioneering efforts in this promising domain of bio-medical textiles,for applications in Medicine and Space. To mention further,we adopted self assembly technique, of covalent bonding of materials,to accomplish our task. <b>Self</b> assembly techniques,are <b>clean</b> and environmentally friendly.

40|$|Intravesical {{botulinum toxin}} A (BoNTA) {{injection}} {{has been widely}} used {{for the treatment of}} detrusor overactivity in patients with neurogenic bladder due to spinal cord injury who do not respond to conventional treatment. There is no consensus about antibiotic prophylaxis for this procedure. We conducted a retrospective analysis of medical records of adult patients with spinal cord injury who underwent detrusor BoNTA injection between January of 2007 and December of 2013 in a rehabilitation hospital. Occurrence of symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) was assessed in 3 groups in accordance with their use of antibiotics (prophylactic dosage, 3 days, more than 3 days) for the treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria. All patients were performing <b>self</b> or assisted <b>clean</b> intermittent bladder catheterization and underwent a rigid cystoscopy, under general or regional anesthesia with sedation, and the drug used was Botox®. A total of 616 procedures were performed during the study period. There were 11 identified cases of UTI (1. 8 %) with a trend to a higher rate in the group that used antibiotics for longer time. This report shows that a single dose of antibiotics before the detrusor BoNTA injection is enough to prevent UTI. Randomized clinical trial should be conducted for definitive conclusions...|$|R

40|$|PurposeBladder neck {{contracture}} (BNC) is a well-recognized complication following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) {{for treatment}} of localized prostate cancer with a reported incidence of up to 1. 4 %. In this series, we report our institutional experience and management results. MethodsA prospectively collected database of patients who underwent RARP by a single surgeon from 2006 to 2012 was reviewed. Watertight bladder neck to urethral anastomosis was performed over 18 -French foley catheter. BNC was diagnosed by flexible cystoscopy in patients who developed symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction. Subsequently, these patients underwent cold knife bladder neck incisions. Patients then followed a strict <b>self</b> regimen of <b>clean</b> intermittent catheterization (CIC). We identify the patient demographics, incidence of BNC, associated risk factors and success of subsequent management. ResultsTotal of 930 patients who underwent RARP for localized prostate cancer was identified. BNC was identified in 15 patients, 1. 6 % incidence. Mean patient age and preoperative prostate-specific antigen was 58. 8 years old and 7. 83 ng/mL (range, 2. 5 - 14. 55 ng/mL) respectively. Mean estimated blood loss was 361 ± 193 mL (range, 50 - 650 mL). Follow-up was mean of 23. 4 months. Average time to BNC diagnosis was 5. 5 months.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the role of transurethralresection of prostate (TURP) in normalising renal function in men presenting with obstructive renal failure secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia. We reviewed the cases of 14 men who presented in the last 5 years with renal impairment associated with symptoms of bladder outflow obstruction and radiological evidence of obstructive uropathy. The mean serum creatinine at presentation was 632 ng/mL (range 1299 - 225). The mean age at presentation was 68. 2 years (range 50 - 83 years). Duration of symptoms prior to presentation ranged between 1 - 118 months (mean 21. 5 months). Following catheter insertion, all patients underwent TURP. Six of the 14 patients required dialysis prior to surgery. Histology of the resected prostate confirmed benign prostatic hypertrophy and/or hyperplasia in all cases. Patients with carcinoma of the prostate were excluded from the study. Following TURP, 2 of the 14 men (14 %) failed to void spontaneously following removal of catheter - one patient performs <b>clean</b> <b>self</b> intermittent catheterization (CSIC), the other man has an in-dwelling catheter in situ. One patient died 7 months following TURP due to a myocardial infarction. However, 8 patients, (57 %) remained dialysis dependent following TURP. Two of these patients have since undergone successful renal transplantation. Of the remaining 6 patients, only 3 have normal renal function with the other 3 experiencing moderately elevated serum creatinine (range 236 - 344 ng/mL). In patients presenting with renal failure due to bladder outflow obstruction, TURP restores normal voiding pattern in many cases. However renal failure due to bladder outflow obstruction tends to be more refractory and only 3 of 14 patients experienced return to normal renal function post treatment...|$|R

Comparisons were made by job status (part-time/full-time), teaching assignment, sex, number of years teaching, age, degree held, other employment of instructor, geographic location of college, and vocational certificate held. A multivariate ANOVA (followed by univariate ANOVAs and Modified LSDs as needed) was performed separately on the OWVI scales, the RVS Terminal Values, and the RVS Instrumental Values. The initial sample included 984 Oregon community college instructors, partitioned by teaching status, teaching assignment, and geographic location. The responding sample included 212 full-time and 288 part-time faculty. The rank order of the OWVI means for instructors was: Task Satisfaction; Self Realization; Ideas/Data; Altruism; Independence; Security; Money; Control; Object Orientation; Prestige and Solitude. The rank order for RVS Terminal Values for instructors was: Health, Self Respect, Family Security; Freedom; Inner Harmony; A Sense of Accomplishment; Wisdom, Mature Love; True Friendship; A World at Peace, An Exciting Life; Equality; A World of Beauty; A Comfortable Life; Salvation; Pleasure; National Security and Social Recognition.
