30|$|In this paper, ToU {{is adopted}} {{and a whole}} day is divided into H = 24 hours which are {{classified}} into different segments with different pricing parameters. According to energy consumption behavior of residential users, a whole day {{can be divided into}} three segments: off-peak hours, mid-peak hours and on-peak hours. The interval from 0 : 00 to 7 : 00 belongs to off-peak hours due to having the least energy consumption of loads. The intervals from 7 : 00 to 17 : 00 and from 22 : 00 to 24 : 00 belong to mid-peak hours. Residential users begin to use household loads intensively during the interval from 17 : 00 to 22 : 00 and this period belongs to on-peak hours. Each <b>segment</b> has a <b>specific</b> <b>value</b> of ah and bh with maximal value in peak demand hours and minimal value in off-peak demand hours.|$|R
40|$|Using multi-fractal detrended {{fluctuation}} analysis (MF-DFA), the scaling {{features of}} wind speed time series (WSTS) could be explored. In this paper, we discuss the influence of sub-daily variation, which is a natural feature of wind, in MF-DFA of WSTS. First, {{the choice of the}} lower bound of the segment length, a significant parameter of MF-DFA, was studied. The results of expanding the lower bound into sub-daily scope shows that an abrupt declination and discrepancy of scaling exponents is caused by the inability to keep the whole diel process of wind in one single <b>segment.</b> Additionally, the <b>specific</b> <b>value,</b> which is effected by the sub-daily feature of local meteo-climatic, might be different. Second, the intra-day temporal order of wind was shuffled to determine the impact of diel variation on scaling exponents of MF-DFA. The results illustrate that disregarding diel variation leads to errors in scaling. We propose that during the MF-DFA of WSTS, the segment length should be longer than 1 day and the diel variation of wind should be maintained to avoid abnormal phenomena and discrepancy in scaling exponents...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} consumers' decision-making process, attitudes and values towards organic food throughout the employment of the Theory of Planned Behaviour, adapting the methodology from a European project. 450 consumers were interviewed at supermarkets and farmers' markets in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Results indicate a high penetration level and very positive attitude towards organic products. Organics are believed to be healthier, tastier, more natural and environmental friendly, although being less attractive and more expensive than conventional food. Respondents from the farmers' market represent a <b>specific</b> <b>segment</b> whose <b>values</b> are more oriented toward society. The findings showed an alignment between positive attitude and consumption behaviour among the surveyed consumers. The study finally contributes to the stakeholders in general, since the knowledge of the attributes more valued by consumers can help retailers to play the role of coordinators of this supply chain, stimulating producers to adhere to organic certification, helping them to upgrade their production practices and improve their income. Consumers are also benefiting from this offer in the market...|$|R

40|$|Diets fed to {{ruminants}} {{should contain}} nitrogen (N) {{as low as}} possible to reduce feed costs and environmental pollution. Though possessing effective N-recycling mechanisms to maintain the N supply for rumen microbial protein synthesis and hence protein supply for the host, an N reduction caused substantial changes in calcium (Ca) and phosphate homeostasis in young goats including decreased intestinal transepithelial Ca absorption as reported for monogastric species. In contrast to the transcellular component of transepithelial Ca transport, the paracellular route has not been investigated in young goats. Therefore, the aim {{of the present study was}} to characterise the effects of dietary N and/or Ca reduction on paracellular transport mechanisms in young goats. Electrophysiological properties of intestinal epithelia were investigated by Ussing chamber experiments. The expression of tight junction (TJ) and adherens junction (AJ) proteins in intestinal epithelia were examined on mRNA level by qPCR and on protein level by western blot analysis. Dietary N reduction led to a <b>segment</b> <b>specific</b> increase in tissue conductances in the proximal jejunum which might be linked to concomitantly decreased expression of cadherin 17 mRNA. Expression of occludin (OCLN) and zonula occludens protein 1 was increased in mid jejunal epithelia of N reduced fed goats on mRNA and partly on protein level. Reduced dietary Ca supply resulted in a <b>segment</b> <b>specific</b> increase in claudin 2 and claudin 12 expression and decreased the expression of OCLN which might have been mediated at least in part by calcitriol. These data show that dietary N as well as Ca reduction affected expression of TJ and AJ proteins in a <b>segment</b> <b>specific</b> manner in young goats and may thus be involved in modulation of paracellular Ca permeability...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the potential of}} segmental bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) for estimating whole-body composition in children. Design: Strengths of relationships were determined between indices of impedance or specific resistivities of body segments and reference four-component model (4 -CM) assessments of body composition. Subjects: Eighteen boys and 19 girls aged 8 - 12 y. Measurements: Whole-body and segment BIA and anthropometry were used to calculate impedance indices of the whole body and <b>segments</b> and <b>specific</b> resistivities of segments; total body water (TBW), fat-free mass (FFM) and body fat were assessed using the 4 -CM. Results: Segmental BIA indices {{were significantly related to}} body composition, provided that appropriate comparisons were undertaken for each index: impedance adjusted for unit segment length was better related to TBW and FFM, whereas <b>segment</b> <b>specific</b> resistivity was better related to body fat. Differences between body composition estimates obtained with the 4 -CM and predicted using BIA were partly dependent on limb-to-trunk ratios of BIA indices. Conclusion: Segmental BIA has potential for providing additional alternative approaches to the assessment of whole-body composition in children: (a) FFM and TBW were best related to impedance adjusted for segment length; (b) body fat was best related to <b>segment</b> <b>specific</b> resistivity; and (c) the relative influences of different segment BIA indices may be utilisable for generating more valid whole-body composition estimates...|$|R
