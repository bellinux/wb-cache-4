5|$|They {{were married}} on 26 April 1923 in Westminster Abbey. Albert's {{marriage}} to <b>someone</b> <b>not</b> of royal birth {{was considered a}} modernising gesture. The newly formed British Broadcasting Company wished to record and broadcast the event on radio, but the Abbey Chapter vetoed the idea (although the Dean, Herbert Edward Ryle, was in favour).|$|E
5|$|British {{archaeologist}} and anthropologist Katherine Routledge {{undertook a}} 1914–1915 scientific expedition to Rapa Nui {{with her husband}} to catalog the art, customs, and writing of the island. She was able to interview two elderly informants, Kapiera and a leper named Tomenika, who allegedly had some knowledge of rongorongo. The sessions were not very fruitful, as the two often contradicted each other. From them Routledge concluded that rongorongo was an idiosyncratic mnemonic device that did not directly represent language, in other words, proto-writing, and that the meanings of the glyphs were reformulated by each scribe, so that the kohau rongorongo could not be read by <b>someone</b> <b>not</b> trained in that specific text. The texts themselves she believed to be litanies for priest-scribes, kept apart in special houses and strictly tapu, that recorded the island's history and mythology. By the time of later ethnographic accounts, such as Métraux (1940), much of what Routledge recorded in her notes had been forgotten, and the oral history showed a strong external influence from popular published accounts.|$|E
5|$|In late 908 Eustathios Argyros was {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} magistros—the highest court dignity open to <b>someone</b> <b>not</b> a member of the imperial family—and the post of Drungary of the Watch, i.e. commander of the imperial bodyguard, and replaced as strategos of Charsianon by Constantine Doukas. About a year later, he fell again under Leo's suspicion, and was ordered to return to his family's estates at Charsianon. Again the reason is unknown; perhaps, according to Cheynet and Vannier, it was a result of the unreliability of the Armenian lords he had welcomed into the Empire, who frequently went over to the Arabs. On the way, he died after taking poison by one of his servants, and was buried on Spynin, the summit of Mount Aran. While historian Romilly James Heald Jenkins has suggested that Argyros' poisoning was done through an agent of the powerful and scheming court eunuch Samonas, it more likely was suicide. His two sons, Pothos and Leo, who served in the palace as manglabites (personal bodyguards of the emperor), arranged to have their father's body transferred for burial to the monastery of Saint Elizabeth in the Charsianon district, founded by Eustathios' father.|$|E

25|$|Southwest Airlines Flight 1248 (WN1248, SWA1248) was a {{scheduled}} passenger flight from Baltimore-Washington International Airport, in Baltimore, Maryland, to Chicago Midway International Airport, in Chicago, Illinois, to Salt Lake City International Airport in Salt Lake City, Utah, {{and then to}} McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, Nevada. On December 8, 2005, the airplane slid off a runway at Chicago-Midway while landing in a snowstorm and crashed into automobile traffic, killing six-year-old Joshua Woods.

Television personality David Koch was named chairman of the club and numerous board members were replaced. The 2013 preseason also saw Travis Boak succeed Domenic Cassisi as captain of the club. The club finished the home and away season 7th on the ladder, making it {{the first time that the}}y had qualified for the finals since 2007. Port travelled to Melbourne to play Collingwood at the MCG in an Elimination Final where they won by 24 points; they then lost to Geelong by 16 points the following week in a Semi Final.|$|E
25|$|Relief (keurmede): Usually {{the lord}} was {{entitled}} to levy a relief duty or heriot which was sometimes referred to in Dutch as the recht van de dode hand, or ‘dead hand right’. This was an inheritance tax on a deceased tenant’s estate that granted the privilege to an heir to succeed to the deceased’s estate. The amount was usually {{in the order of}} 5% {{of the value of the}} real property. Sometimes the lord also had the right to take the deceased’s best chattel (beste kateil/katell). Depending on the region, this was also referred to as the ‘best beast’ (beste hoofd), referring to the best animal in the herd, or the ‘high chair’ (hoogstoel), meaning the nicest piece of household furniture. Often there was also a special relief for the estate of a ‘foreigner’ (inwijkeling), that is, <b>someone</b> <b>not</b> born in the heerlijkheid, and illegitimate children.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, news analysts, lawyers, {{current and}} former {{government}} officials of the Thai justice system, such as Seripisut Temiyavet, came out to state that the DSI was not handling {{the investigation of the}} temple with proper legal procedure. It was questioned why the DSI would not let the abbot acknowledge the charges at the temple, which many considered legitimate under criminal law. The DSI replied that {{they did not want to}} visit the abbot at the temple at this stage, because the temple was crowded with people, who could force the DSI to commit itself to additional conditions. A spokesperson of the temple also questioned why the DSI did not pursue lawsuits that were still running against Paiboon and Phra Suwit. Was the DSI biased because they received orders from <b>someone</b> <b>not</b> disclosed? The DSI had seen its independence questioned before, even by leading people within the department itself. In short, the temple's practitioners and spokespeople felt the charges were politically motivated, and had no confidence in the justice system under the junta. Moreover, they felt that if the former abbot would turn himself in, this would set a precedent for more baseless persecutions of other monks.|$|E

500|$|The Royal Society {{suggested}} command {{be given}} to Scottish geographer Alexander Dalrymple, whose acceptance was conditional on a brevet commission as a captain in the Royal Navy. However, First Lord of the Admiralty Edward Hawke refused, {{going so far as}} to say he would rather cut off his right hand than give command of a navy vessel to <b>someone</b> <b>not</b> educated as a seaman. In refusing Dalrymple's command, Hawke was influenced by previous insubordination aboard the sloop [...] in 1698, when naval officers had refused to take orders from civilian commander Dr. Edmond Halley. The impasse was broken when the Admiralty proposed James Cook, a naval officer with a background in mathematics and cartography. Acceptable to both parties, Cook was promoted to Lieutenant and named as commander of the expedition.|$|E

500|$|As editing progressed, budget {{shortfalls}} prevented BSÉ from finalizing contracts. The organization also restricted post-production {{funds to}} [...] "limit [...] exposure" [...] {{in the event}} the project was not completed. Stoneman contacted a former colleague at the BBC, Nick Fraser, who had declined to help finance the film in 2001. Fraser was commissioning editor for the BBC's Storyville documentaries series. According to Stoneman, Fraser was [...] "still undecided", having been told {{by the head of}} BBC Two that [...] "we've done Chávez". Nevertheless, the BBC pre-purchased the film and in December 2002 received a rough cut. At the BBC's behest, the opening of the television version was made more dramatic. Fraser was unsure about the voice-over; he asked for a more [...] "opinionated" [...] narration that, according to Bartley, would [...] "get the boot in". Although the BBC did not ask outright, Bartley's impression was that the organization wanted the film to be [...] "against Chávez". Fraser later said he had asked for the filmmakers to [...] "include [...] with <b>someone</b> <b>not</b> a Chávez supporter". He also suggested that a more experienced director be employed to help edit the film. The filmmakers [...] "made a few minor concessions", but resisted major edits. ÓBriain's voice-over in the final cut was [...] "polished up but not significantly changed".|$|E
500|$|In early 2013 {{the long-running}} feud between Atlantis and Último Guerrero {{came to the}} {{forefront}} of CMLL booking once more. The two were booked for the 2013 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles tournament, forcing the two rivals to team up. Before their qualifying round both Atlantis and Gurrero stated that they would put their differences aside {{for the sake of the}} tournament. Atlantis and Guerrero displayed the teamwork they had developed by being partners in Los Guerreros de la Atlantida for several years as they defeated the teams of Valiente and Pólvora, Diamante Azul and Euforia and finally Dragón Rojo, Jr. and Niebla Roja to qualify for the finals of the tournament. The finals took place as part of the 2013 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show and saw La Sombra and Volador, Jr. win the match and the tournament. Following the loss a frustrated Atlantis attacked Último Guerrero and tore his mask apart. Atlantis subsequently made a Luchas de Apuestas challenge to Último Guerrero that was not immediately accepted. [...] The two rivals officially signed the contract for the mask vs. mask match on March 21, but did not announce an actual date for the match. The act of signing a Luchas de Apuestas match between two of the top-ranked CMLL workers without announcing a specific date has let people to speculate that it would take place at the CMLL 80th Anniversary Show in September, 2013. [...] During the celebration of Atlantis' 30th anniversary as a wrestler Guerrero appeared after a match to berate Atlantis, which turned out to only be a distraction for the real Último Guerrero to attack Atlantis from behind. The two identically dressed Guerreros proceeded to beat up Atlantis and tear his mask apart. Following the match Último Guerrero introduced his brother [...] "Gran Guerrero". It was not verified if Gran Guerrrero actually is the brother of Último Guerrero, <b>someone</b> <b>not</b> related to Guerrero, or as speculated by many his son who wrestled for CMLL as Taurus. The much anticipated and hyped Mask vs. Mask match between Guerrero and Atlantis at the 80th Anniversary Show on September 13 never came to fruition as the two were defeated in a Relevos Suicidas match by La Sombra and Volador Jr., who instead advanced to the Lucha de Apuestas against each other.|$|E
