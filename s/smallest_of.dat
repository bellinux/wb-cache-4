5|$|After Miranda, Ariel is the second-smallest of Uranus' {{five major}} rounded {{satellites}} and the second-closest to its planet. Among the <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> the Solar System's 19 known spherical moons (it ranks 14th among them in diameter), {{it is believed}} to be composed of roughly equal parts ice and rocky material. Its mass is approximately equal in magnitude to Earth's hydrosphere.|$|E
5|$|Akodon caenosus is the <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> the Argentine {{members of}} the A.boliviensis group–indeed, among the <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> all species of Akodon. The upperparts are uniformly colored, but their tone is variable: {{generally}} ochraceous brown, but approaching yellow, red, or olivaceous in some individuals. Reddish tones occur mostly in lactating females. High-altitude animals are generally lighter, {{but there is also}} conspicuous variation within populations. The ears are similar to the upperparts, but some individuals have the sides more rich and clear in color. The underparts are clearly different in color, varying from light gray to yellowish or reddish. There are yellowish rings around the eyes, which are more highly developed in high-altitude populations. There are white to yellowish hairs on the fore- and hindfeet. The tail is variably covered with hair and is dark brown above and white to buffy below.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{distance}} of Neptune from Earth, its angular diameter only ranges from 2.2 to 2.4arcseconds, the <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> the Solar System planets. Its small apparent size makes it challenging to study it visually. Most telescopic data was fairly limited until {{the advent of the}} Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics (AO).|$|E
5|$|M. l. leucopterus is {{restricted}} to Dirk Hartog Island, off the western coast of Australia, and nuptial males display black-and-white plumage. This subspecies is the <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> the three and bears a proportionally longer tail. It was collected again in 1916 by Tom Carter, 98years after de Freycinet's expedition collected the type specimen.|$|E
5|$|Puck is {{the largest}} small inner moon of Uranus, which orbits inside the orbit of Miranda. It is {{intermediate}} in size between Portia (the second-largest inner moon) and Miranda (the <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> the five large classical moons). Puck's orbit is located between the rings of Uranus and Miranda. Little is known about Puck aside from its orbit, radius of about 81km, and geometric albedo in visible light of approximately 0.11.|$|E

5|$|Several {{versions}} of the stage were used during the tour. The first two legs of 1992 were indoors and used the <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> the sets, which included fourVidiwalls (Philips-branded giant television screens); sixpainted Trabants suspended above the stage; 36television monitors; and a B-stage, a small remote platform connected to the main stage by a ramp. A seventh Trabant by the B-stage doubled as a DJ booth and a mirror ball.|$|E
5|$|The Indian subcontinent is {{the range}} of {{subspecies}} N. p. ginginianus, the <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> the three subspecies, which is identifiable by a pale yellow bill. The subspecies name is derived from Gingee in southern India where the French explorer Pierre Sonnerat described it as Le Vautour de Gingi and it was given a Latin name by John Latham in his Index Ornithologicus (1790).|$|E
5|$|The basic {{engineering}} {{for all the}} German half-tracks was developed during the Weimar-era by the Reichswehr's Military Automotive Department, but final design and testing was farmed out to commercial firms {{with the understanding that}} production would be shared with multiple companies. Demag was chosen to develop the <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> the German half-tracks and spent the years between 1934 and 1938 perfecting the design through a series of prototypes.|$|E

5|$|The {{south-eastern}} red-tailed black cockatoo subspecies C. b. graptogyne {{is listed}} as endangered on Schedule 7 of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 of South Australia. and is the <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> the species.

5|$|The {{upper and}} lower parts of the thorax (terga and sterna respectively) are {{composed}} of segmental and intrasegmental sclerites which display secondary sclerotisation and considerable modification in the Lepidoptera.

5|$|About {{the size}} of a rabbit, the tammar is among the <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> the {{wallabies}} in the genus Macropus. Its coat colour is largely grey. The tammar has several notable adaptations, including the ability to retain energy while hopping, colour vision and the ability to drink seawater. A nocturnal species, it spends nighttime in grassland habitat and daytime in shrubland. It is also very gregarious and has a seasonal, promiscuous mating pattern. A female tammar can nurse a joey in her pouch while keeping an embryo in her uterus. The tammar is a model species for research on marsupials, and on mammals in general. It is one of many organisms to have had its genome sequenced.|$|E
5|$|Adrastea has an {{irregular}} shape and measures 20×16×14km across. A surface area estimate would be between 840 and 1,600 (~1,200) km2. This {{makes it the}} <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> the four inner moons. The bulk, composition and mass of Adrastea are not known, but assuming that its mean density is like that of Amalthea, around 0.86g/cm3, its mass can be estimated at about 2kg. Amalthea's density implies that the moon is composed of water ice with a porosity of 10–15%, and Adrastea may be similar.|$|E
