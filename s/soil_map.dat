However, communications of the digital <b>soil</b> <b>mapping</b> information between diverse audiences become problematic due to the inconsistent scale of DSM information. Spatial downscaling can make use of accessible soil information at relatively coarse spatial resolution to provide valuable soil information at relatively fine spatial resolution. The objective {{of this research was}} to disaggregate the coarse spatial resolution soil exchangeable potassium (Kex) and soil total nitrogen (TN) base map into fine spatial resolution <b>soil</b> downscaled <b>map</b> using weighted generalized additive models (GAMs) in two smallholder villages in South India. By incorporating fine spatial resolution spectral indices in the downscaling process, the <b>soil</b> downscaled <b>maps</b> not only conserve the spatial information of coarse spatial resolution <b>soil</b> <b>maps</b> but also depict the spatial details of soil properties at fine spatial resolution. The results of this study demonstrated difference between the fine spatial resolution downscaled maps and fine spatial resolution base maps is smaller than the difference between coarse spatial resolution base maps and fine spatial resolution base maps. The appropriate and economical strategy to promote the DSM technique in smallholder farms is to develop the relatively coarse spatial resolution <b>soil</b> prediction <b>maps</b> or utilize available coarse spatial resolution <b>soil</b> <b>maps</b> at the regional scale and to disaggregate these maps to the fine spatial resolution downscaled <b>soil</b> <b>maps</b> at farm scale...|$|R
