5|$|There is no {{evidence}} of Foliot's education, but he likely received an education to fit him for his career in the church. Bibliographers have frequently confused him with his predecessor as bishop, Robert of Melun, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> mistakenly been given as the author of a number of documents.|$|E
5|$|During the {{daylight}} hours, Jericho's powers are gone, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> to fight {{as a normal}} human, using {{a wide variety of}} weaponry, from a Darkwatch's standard-issue 24-shot Redeemer handgun to a crossbow firing explosive arrows and a rocket launcher, as well as melee combat. In some missions, Jericho can drive a Gatling gun-equipped Coyote Steamwagon vehicle; using it or a horse changes perspective to the third-person view. During horse-riding rail shooter sequences, Jericho is granted unlimited ammunition and high attack speed, at the cost of only being able to use the Redeemer.|$|E

5|$|Stacy Warner is {{a fictional}} {{recurring}} character portrayed by Sela Ward on the Fox Broadcasting Company's medical drama House. She {{was in a}} relationship with Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), when a clotted aneurysm in his right thigh led to an infarction during a game of golf, causing his quadriceps muscle to become necrotic. Regarding House's treatment, Stacy acted against House's wishes when he was put into a chemically induced coma. She authorized a safer surgical middle-ground procedure by removing just the dead muscle, leaving House with a lesser, but serious, level of pain {{for the rest of his}} life. House could not forgive her and they broke up. The two meet again, five years later, at the end of season one; Stacy wants House to treat her husband, Mark. House correctly diagnoses Mark with acute intermittent porphyria, and <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> to remain at the hospital for close monitoring. Stacy becomes the hospital's lawyer, and she and House grow closer together. When she is ultimately willing to leave Mark for him, House tells her to go back to Mark, which devastates her and causes her and Mark to leave the city.|$|E
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) is {{tasked with}} winning the Scranton White Pages account. However, the CEO is a woman, and Dwight has trouble selling to women. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{and the women}} of the office teach him how to {{interact}} with women. The lesson, which is taught by Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate), Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), and Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith), goes nowhere, and they give up. Pam goes with Dwight to the White Pages, only to find out that the buyer is Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin). Jan was expecting to meet with CEO David Wallace, and reprimands her assistant for the confusion. Pam quickly realizes that the meeting was just a ruse to take revenge on David for firing her five years prior. However, Dwight remains determined to make the sale, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> Pam stall while he gets Clark (Clark Duke), intuiting that Jan has an attraction to underage men due to her rumored affair with her 17-year-old former assistant Hunter. After he introduces Clark to her, Jan says she will think about it, and tells everyone to leave her office except Clark. As Pam and Dwight leave, Dwight offers a sympathetic comment to Jan's assistant (a woman). Pam is pleased, seeing that some of the lessons they gave Dwight on women sunk in after all.|$|E

Outlaws in Tunstall Forest {{organised}} by Ellis Duckworth, whose weapon and calling card is a black arrow, cause Dick to suspect that his guardian Sir Daniel Brackley and his retainers are responsible for his father's murder. Dick's suspicions are enough to turn Sir Daniel against him, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> no recourse but to escape from Sir Daniel and join the outlaws of the Black Arrow against him.

25|$|Melton's major {{emphasis}} {{has been}} on collating primary source data on religious groups and movements. His approach to research is shaped by his training both in church and religious history and in the phenomenology of religion. His methodology has followed that of a historian seeking primary source literature, and <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> generally made direct, personal contact with the leaders or official representatives of a church or religious group. The purpose of such contact has been to obtain the group's main religious literature to ascertain their principal teachings and practices. His inquiries also comprise, gathering membership statistics, details of the group's history and so forth. He then incorporates these details profiles that {{form the basis for}} reference texts like the Encyclopedia of American Religions.|$|E

Florent is knighted and the listener is treated to another comic scene as Clement worries that he might {{have to pay for the}} feast that the King of France and the Emperor of Rome have put on in Florent's honour.

25|$|In the Australian Open Nadal {{began the}} tournament by {{breezing}} past qualifier Alex Kuznetsov of United States. The second round against Tommy Haas, {{who has never}} won a set against Rafael, was tighter, but Nadal again advanced in three straight sets.

By doing <b>so,</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> reached the finals of all four majors consecutively. In the final, on 29 January, he was beaten by Novak Djokovic in a five-set match that lasted 5 hours and 53 minutes, the longest ever match for a Grand Slam title.

When it was revealed that Adidas planned to end its contract for the manufacture of NBA jerseys with American Classic Outfitters, an upstate New York apparel company, and outsource production overseas, Schumer blasted the company, citing the risk to 100 workers at the plant. When it was revealed that Canon Inc. was considering relocating from its corporate headquarters in Long Island because of a dispute over road infrastructure funding, Schumer stepped in to advocate New York state redirect federal stimulus dollars to make the road improvements and keep the company and its jobs on Long Island.|$|E

500|$|Shilts' {{book has}} been used as a {{standard}} by the lay press when reviewing books chronicling subsequent medical crises including breast cancer, chronic fatigue syndrome, Agent Orange, and continued response to AIDS. However, the academic and scientific communities have been somewhat more critical. Howard Merkel, in the American Journal of Public Health, notes Shilts' tendency to assign blame, writing [...] "A requirement of the journalist, and certainly the historian, however, is to explain human society rather than to point fingers". Jon Katz in Rolling Stone refutes this by stating [...] " [...] fused strong belief with the gathering of factual information and the marshaling of arguments, the way the founders of the modern press did. In doing <b>so,</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> exposed the notion of objectivity as bankrupt, ineffective, even lethal".|$|E

500|$|Irving {{was dismayed}} by the storyline which saw Meyer shot in a road rage incident, {{describing}} filming the scenes as an [...] "unpleasant experiences", the worst aspect being that Meyer loses his spleen {{as a result of}} his injuries. Of the later storyline which sees Meyer investigated by Tom Campbell-Gore on behalf of the hospital Board, Denis Lawson explained: [...] " [...] actually rather fancies Meyer's job but if he finds against him in the investigation he cannot get the job because it's a conflict of interest. <b>So</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> to play a rather clever game, which he does." [...] On taking over as head of the cardiothoracic surgery department, he commented: [...] "George is fantastic in the show, but obviously I'm going to do something very, very different, so I don't feel that I'm stepping into his shoes." ...|$|E

[...] Butters stated that [...] "The problem with Thompson is, he’s such an opportunist, and he so wants to succeed above all other things, that he sometimes makes bad choices. I think he’s not a bad guy, he just gets blinded by ambition." [...] On the character's second season arc, Fazekas reiterated that he [...] "puts his ambition and his ego over other things, over sometimes doing the right thing, and he often doesn't care who gets hurt or who is upset about it ... he actually decides {{to do the right thing}} in the end at great cost to himself." ...|$|E
