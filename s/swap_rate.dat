2500|$|The example {{given in}} {{the table at the}} right is known as a LIBOR curve because it is {{constructed}} using either LIBOR rates or swap rates. [...] A LIBOR curve is the most widely used interest rate curve as it represents the credit worth of private entities at about A+ rating, roughly the equivalent of commercial banks. [...] If one substitutes the LIBOR and swap rates with government bond yields, one arrives at what is known as a government curve, usually considered the risk free interest rate curve for the underlying currency. [...] The spread between the LIBOR or <b>swap</b> <b>rate</b> and the government bond yield, usually positive, meaning private borrowing is at a premium above government borrowing, of similar maturity is a measure of risk tolerance of the lenders.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the convexity bias introduced by pricing interest <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> off the Eurocurrency futures curve and {{the incorporation of}} this bias in prices over time. The convexity bias arises because {{of the difference between}} a futures versus a forward contract on interest rates, since the payoff to the latter is non-linear in interest rates. Using daily data from 1987 - 1996, the differences between market <b>swap</b> <b>rates</b> and the <b>swap</b> <b>rates</b> implied from Eurocurrency futures prices are studied for the four major interest <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> markets - $, ',', and DM - and implied rates cannot be explained by default risk differences, term structure effects, liquidity differences or information asymmetries between the swaps and the futures markets. Using a calibrated term structure model, the theoretical value of the convexity bias is found to be comparable to the empirically observed spread. This is evidence of mispricing of <b>swap</b> <b>rates</b> during the earlier years of the study, with a gradual elimination of that mispricing by incorporation of a convexity adjustment in swap pricing over time. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{recent development}} in the pricing of interest rate derivatives {{is the emergence of}} models that incorporate lognormal volatilities for forward Libor or forward <b>swap</b> <b>rates</b> while keeping interest rates stable. These market models have three attractive features: they preclude arbitrage among bonds, they keep rates positive, and, most distinctively, they price caps or swaptions according to Black's formula, thus allowing automatic calibration to market data. But these features of continuous-time formulations are easily lost when the models are discretized for simulation. We introduce methods for discretizing these models giving particular attention to precluding arbitrage among bonds and to keeping interest rates positive even after discretization. These methods transform the Libor or <b>swap</b> <b>rates</b> to positive martingales, discretize the martingales, and then recover the Libor and <b>swap</b> <b>rates</b> from these discretized variables, rather than discretizing the rates themselves.

Marking-to-market also results in intermediate cash-flows and it is costly to post collatera.

At the time of the swap agreement, the total value of the swap’s fixed rate flows will be equal to the value of expected floating rate payments implied by the forward LIBOR curve. As forward expectations for LIBOR change, so will the fixed rate that investors demand to enter into new swaps.
