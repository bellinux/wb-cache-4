5|$|A diver {{missing a}} {{required}} decompression stop {{increases the risk}} of developing decompression sickness. The risk is related to the depth and duration of the missed <b>stops.</b> <b>The</b> usual causes for missing stops are: not having enough breathing gas to complete the stops, or accidentally losing control of buoyancy. An aim of most basic diver training is to prevent these two faults. There are also less predictable causes of missing decompression stops. Diving suit failure in cold water may force the diver to choose between hypothermia and decompression sickness. Diver injury or marine animal attack may also limit the duration of <b>stops</b> <b>the</b> diver is willing to carry out.|$|E

5|$|A third safety car {{period was}} caused by the Creation Autosportif entry, which ran into the tire {{barriers}} at the Porsche Curves and needed to be extracted. The Creation returned to the pits but eventually retired. The Kruse Motorsport entry also suffered problems when it briefly stopped at the pit entrance during the caution period, blocking other cars attempting to make their own pit <b>stops.</b> <b>The</b> Kruse entry eventually succeeded in getting to its garage.|$|E

5|$|At sunset, {{the group}} {{discusses}} Randall's fate, and Dale's arguments {{have failed to}} sway the group, and he storms out. Rick, Shane, and Daryl return to the barn and Rick prepares to shoot Randall when Carl runs in and urges his father to do it. Rick is horrified and <b>stops</b> <b>the</b> execution, much to Shane's annoyance.|$|E
5|$|Observations {{have failed}} to note signs of {{accretion}} leading up to Type Ia supernovae, and this is now thought to be because the star is first loaded up to above the Chandrasekhar limit while also being spun up to a very high rate by the same process. Once the accretion <b>stops</b> <b>the</b> star gradually slows until the spin is no longer enough to prevent the explosion.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{remainders}} decrease {{with every}} step but can never be negative, a remainder r'N must eventually equal zero, {{at which point the}} algorithm <b>stops.</b> <b>The</b> final nonzero remainder r'N−1 is the greatest common divisor of a and b. The number N cannot be infinite because there are only a finite number of nonnegative integers between the initial remainder r0 and zero.|$|E

5|$|The metal {{is readily}} {{attacked}} by most acids. Sulfuric acid is a notable exception because passivation <b>stops</b> <b>the</b> reaction by forming the insoluble barium sulfate on the surface. Barium combines with several metals, including aluminium, zinc, lead, and tin, forming intermetallic phases and alloys.|$|E
5|$|The no {{decompression}} limit (NDL) or no stop time, is {{the interval}} that a diver may theoretically spend {{at a given}} depth without having to perform decompression <b>stops.</b> <b>The</b> NDL helps divers plan dives {{so that they can}} stay at a given depth and ascend without stopping while avoiding unacceptable risk of decompression sickness.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} prevent rainscald, it is {{important}} to <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> spread of the bacteria. Tick and insect control is an effective way to <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> spread of the bacteria from one animal to another. As well, separating infected animals will help to <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> spread of the bacteria. Keeping the animal in a dry, well-ventilated area out of the rain and wet conditions will <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> bacteria from growing. This dry environment includes dry ground as well as dry air.|$|R
5|$|A second defence of {{vertebrates}} against viruses {{is called}} cell-mediated immunity and involves immune cells known as T cells. The body's cells constantly display short fragments of their proteins on the cell's surface, and, if a T cell recognises a suspicious viral fragment there, the host cell is destroyed by killer T cells and the virus-specific T-cells proliferate. Cells {{such as the}} macrophage are specialists at this antigen presentation. The production of interferon is an important host defence mechanism. This is a hormone produced by the body when viruses are present. Its role in immunity is complex; it eventually <b>stops</b> <b>the</b> viruses from reproducing by killing the infected cell and its close neighbours.|$|E

The final map released for the Silver Line's Phase I opening features the stations shared by the three lines as normal stations, with the dots signifying stations located on the colored line {{in the center and}} small white stubs extending from the center dots into the adjoining colored lines.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} pit <b>stops,</b> <b>the</b> Mercedes drivers had {{to manage their}} tyres in order to cover from a {{possible}} attack by Ferrari, who had an extra set of fresh tyres saved from qualifying. Rosberg however complained over the radio about Hamilton {{in front of him}} driving too slow, which caused him to back into the charging Ferraris. He was unable to risk driving too close behind Hamilton, because dispersed air {{from the back of the}} car was accelerating tyre degradation. Hamilton was therefore asked by the team to pick up the pace.|$|E

5|$|As {{punishment}} for his escape, he {{is forced to}} repeatedly dig a grave-sized hole in the prison camp yard, fill it back in, and then be beaten. The prisoners observe his persecution, singing spirituals. Finally, as the other prisoners watch from {{the windows of the}} bunkhouse, an exhausted Luke collapses in the hole, begging God for mercy and pleads with the bosses not to hit him again. Believing Luke is finally broken, the Captain <b>stops</b> <b>the</b> punishment. Boss Paul warns Luke that he will be killed if ever he runs away again, which Luke promises in tears not to do. The prisoners begin to lose their idealized image of Luke, and one tears up the photograph of Luke with the women.|$|E
5|$|At Mars Investigations, Duncan and Lilly's mother, Celeste Kane (Lisa Thornhill) hires Keith to {{ascertain}} if her husband Jake {{is having an}} affair, despite her open contempt for both Keith and Veronica. Keith is busy with other projects, and Veronica takes it upon herself to follow Jake. Veronica takes photos of him at the Camelot hotel as he meets with an unseen woman after midnight. Once Keith sees the license plate number of the woman's car, he <b>stops</b> <b>the</b> investigation and files the photograph. Puzzled by his actions, Veronica finds the file and learns that Keith has continued his own personal investigation of Lilly's murder. Veronica discovers that the car belongs to her missing mother, Lianne, and begins to investigate the murder herself.|$|E

5|$|By lap10, Massa {{had opened}} his lead over Räikkönen to 4.4seconds, ahead of Kubica, Heidfeld, Kovalainen and Trulli. Kubica {{was the first}} of the frontrunners to pit, on lap17.

Following the first round of pit <b>stops,</b> <b>the</b> gap between the Ferraris was 5.4seconds, however by lap31 Räikkönen had closed to within four seconds of his teammate. Massa held a 3.6second lead over Räikkönen when the two Ferraris pitted for the final time on laps 39and 38, respectively, and Massa retained his lead into the final stint. Kubica pitted on lap41, Heidfeld on lap45, and Kovalainen on lap47.|$|E
5|$|During combat, {{the player}} can circle the enemy to expose weak points and escape {{dangerous}} positions. Changing position temporarily <b>stops</b> <b>the</b> gauges charging. Likewise, enemies may change position {{to force the}} dragon into vulnerable areas; a radar {{at the bottom of}} the screen indicates safe, neutral and dangerous areas, with the front and rear areas typically posing the most danger. Weak points can sometimes only be attacked from dangerous areas, and enemies' attack patterns often change mid-battle, forcing the player to adapt.|$|E
5|$|Examples of post-translational {{modification}} include phosphorylation, myristoylation and glycosylation. For example, in {{the response to}} insulin, the phosphorylation of multiple enzymes, including glycogen synthase, helps control the synthesis or degradation of glycogen and allows the cell to respond to changes in blood sugar. Another example of {{post-translational modification}} is the cleavage of the polypeptide chain. Chymotrypsin, a digestive protease, is produced in inactive form as chymotrypsinogen in the pancreas and transported in this form to the stomach where it is activated. This <b>stops</b> <b>the</b> enzyme from digesting the pancreas or other tissues before it enters the gut. This type of inactive precursor to an enzyme {{is known as a}} zymogen or proenzyme.|$|E
