In the two-transistor APS architecture on the right, TAMP is used as a switched-amplifier integrating functions of both Msf and Msel in the three-transistor APS.

The polymers of definite arrangement and well-conductive path for ion and electron transport are crucial to develop PANI with superior electrochemical performances.

The reduced KOH-treated graphene oxide was analyzed with thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), Raman, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and electrochemical charge/discharge cycles to elucidate the physical and electrochemical performances. KOH-treated reduced graphene oxide exhibits adequate dispersibility in an aqueous medium; consequently, it induces good wettability in an aqueous electrolyte solution.

Besides, the synthetic nanomaterials enhanced the output of electrode by creating a higher surface area and decreasing the current flow resistance.

40|$|Abstract: A {{framework}} for modeling and control is introduced for robotic manipulators {{with a number}} of energetically self-contained semiactive joints. The control approach consists of three steps. First, a virtual control design is conducted by any suitable means, assuming a fully-actuated system. Then, virtual control inputs are matched by a parameter modulation law. Finally, the storage dynamics are shaped using design parameters. Storage dynamics coincide with the system’s internal dynamics under exact virtual control matching. An internal energy balance equation and associated self-powered operation condition are given for the semiactive joints. This condition is a structural characteristic of the system and independent of the control law. Moreover, the internal energy balance equation is independent of the energy <b>storage</b> parameter (<b>capacitance),</b> which adds flexibility to the approach. An external energy balance equation is also given {{that can be used to}} calculate the work required from the active joints.

30|$|Doping {{effect is}} {{referred}} to as the introduction of heteroatoms or functional groups to the structure of a carbon monolayer. Doping heteroatoms, typically nitrogen atoms, could change the structure of a hexagonal ring where carbon atoms are replaced by heteroatoms. However, doped functional groups, typically oxygen-containing groups, only substitute hydrogen atoms on the surface. Due to this significant difference, the former case requires a combination of density functional theory (DFT) and MD, while the latter case could be simulated by a single MD technique. DFT calculation represents a successful approach to simplify complex electron–electron interactions into an effective one-electron potential [87]. This method is used to calculate the atomic and electronic structures of diverse materials. By analyzing their atomic and electronic structures, some critical parameters could be obtained in the process of energy <b>storage,</b> e.g., <b>capacitance</b> in electrode (i.e., quantum capacitance) and the accurate partial charge distribution on the doped electrode.

We discuss charge <b>storage</b> and <b>capacitance</b> of the EDL and the impact of screening due to dielectric solvents. We further calculate, for the first time, the in-plane structure of the EDL within the framework of DFT. While our out-of-plane results already hint at structural in-plane transitions inside the EDL, which have been observed recently in simulations and experiments, our DFT approach performs poorly in predicting in-plane structure in comparison to simulations.

30|$|Graphene can be {{prepared}} by the chemical reduction of graphene oxide (GO) [16 – 18], epitaxial growth on metal surfaces [19], or mechanical exfoliation [20]. The chemical reduction of GO has been frequently applied for large-scale production of graphene sheets. The electrical conductivity and dispersibility of graphene is probably due to chemical reduction [16, 17, 21]. The electrochemical performance of an electrode material deeply depends on the electrical conductivity, surface area, wetting of the electrode, and permeability of the electrolyte solution [5, 11, 22]. The permeability of an electrolyte solution can be increased considerably due to its porous nature or faster wetting induced by the residual functional groups of the graphene sheets [5]. Active spaces and pores present in the graphene sheets transport the electrolyte ions efficiently between the interfaces and improve the specific capacitance [22]. The aggregated graphene sheets of thermally annealed graphene perform like graphite and decrease the effective electrolyte diffusion. However, the presence of hydrophilic functional groups on the graphene sheets efficiently improves the wetting between graphene and polar electrolytes, and also inhibits the aggregation of graphene sheets. Additionally, this oxygen functional group has a pseudocapacitance effect with the double-layer capacitor [23]. A few solution-based approaches have been reported for applying graphene in supercapacitors such as reduction of surfactant-stabilized GO [5], solvothermally reduced graphene [23], poly(ionic liquid)-modified graphene [24], and partially reduced GO [11]. To enhance the energy <b>storage</b> <b>capacitance</b> of graphene, {{the introduction of the}} pseudocapacitance property is essential. The pseudocapacitance property supports a synergistic effect on both double-layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance [24, 25]. In fact, the presence of the residual oxygen groups on the graphene sheets induces the pseudocapacitive effects (electrochemical reduction and oxidation) and promotes good wettability of the electrodes [5, 11, 26]. To increase the energy <b>storage</b> <b>capacitance</b> of the reduced graphene oxide (RGO), they must have some residual oxygen functional groups for pseudocapacitance and faster electrolyte permeability.|$|E
