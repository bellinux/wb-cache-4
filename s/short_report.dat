25|$|In 1988, {{the same}} year as the United Nations {{established}} the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand started developing policy for climate change. This was coordinated between agencies by the Ministry for the Environment. The Government asked the Royal Society of New Zealand to report on the scientific basis of climate change. A <b>short</b> <b>report,</b> 'Climate Change in New Zealand', was published in 1988 and the full report 'New Zealand Climate Report 1990' was published in 1989.|$|E
25|$|When the Avignon {{bridge was}} finally {{abandoned}} in 1669, the fortress no longer served any useful function. It was nevertheless still maintained but in 1777 a government engineer wrote a <b>short</b> <b>report</b> proposing that the fortress be abandoned. Probably, as a result, in 1787, Quintin de Beuverd, {{captain of the}} Corps Royal du Génie, produced a detailed report {{on the state of}} the buildings. It included a plan and concluded that the buildings were not required by the king. These events were overtaken by the French Revolution in 1789 but the surviving documents allow historians to study the layout of the fortress.|$|E
25|$|Herodotus {{wrote an}} account about 430 BC of Carthaginian {{trade on the}} Atlantic coast of Morocco. The Punic {{explorer}} and suffete of Carthage called Hanno the Navigator led an expedition to recolonise the Atlantic coast of Morocco that may have ventured as far down the coast of Africa as Senegal and perhaps even beyond. The Greek version of the Periplus of Hanno describes his voyage. Although {{it is not known}} just how far his fleet sailed on the African coastline, this <b>short</b> <b>report,</b> dating probably from the 5th or 6th century BC, identifies distinguishing geographic features such as a coastal volcano and an encounter with hairy hominids.|$|E

25|$|The news of {{the unrest}} in Barrackpore, {{especially}} concerning {{the use of violence}} to subdue a peaceful protest, was suppressed in public media in Calcutta, London and elsewhere. The colonial government maintained its silence except for a short official paragraph published in the Calcutta Gazette on 4 November, where the incident was largely trivialised, with no mention of casualties. Bengal Hurkaru, a local semi-official newspaper under the editorship of a British Deputy Judge-Advocate, also published a <b>short</b> <b>report</b> in November 1824. The report played down the incident and lacked basic details including the cause of the mutiny, stating that they were not allowed to publish such details. Apart from these two reports, common Indians and Britons were largely kept uninformed about the incident, although rumours circulated.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "spatula test" [...] is a {{clinical}} test for tetanus that involves touching the posterior pharyngeal {{wall with a}} soft-tipped instrument and observing the effect. A positive test result is the involuntary contraction of the jaw (biting down on the [...] "spatula") and a negative test result would normally be a gag reflex attempting to expel the foreign object. A <b>short</b> <b>report</b> in The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene states that, in a patient research study, the spatula test had a high specificity (zero false-positive test results) and a high sensitivity (94% of infected patients produced a positive test).|$|E
2500|$|Harber {{expected}} that the journalist who employed him would publish a full account of their visit to Russia and felt because he went as her employee {{it would not be}} right for him to publish his own, but in fact the journalist never did.

2500|$|A <b>short</b> <b>report</b> {{indicated}} the Spitfire was 20mph (32km/h) faster from 0 to 5,000ft (0 to 1,525 m) and 15,000ft to 20,000ft (4,573 to 6,100 m). At all other heights, the Spitfire had a 60mph (97km/h) speed {{advantage over the}} Fw 190A. The Spitfire had a considerably faster rate of climb at all altitudes. In the dive the Fw 190A gained slightly in the initial stages. The Spitfire could outturn the Fw 190, though in a right-hand turn this was less pronounced. The Fw 190 was far faster in the roll. It was suggested that if a Spitfire XIV was in the defensive, it should use its fast maximum climb and turning circle to escape. In the offensive the Spitfire could [...] "mix it", but {{should be aware of}} the Fw 190As fast roll rate and dive. If the Fw 190 was allowed to do this, the Spitfire probably would not close the range until the Fw 190 pilot had to pull out of the dive.|$|E

2500|$|The undefinability theorem is {{conventionally}} {{attributed to}} Alfred Tarski. Gödel also discovered the undefinability theorem in 1930, while proving his incompleteness theorems published in 1931, and {{well before the}} 1936 publication of Tarski's work (Murawski 1998). While Gödel never published anything bearing on his independent discovery of undefinability, he did describe it in a 1931 letter to John von Neumann. Tarski had obtained almost all results of his 1936 paper Der Wahrheitsbegriff in den formalisierten Sprachen between 1929 and 1931, and spoke about them to Polish audiences. [...] However, as he emphasized in the paper, the undefinability theorem was the only result he did not obtain earlier. According to the footnote of the undefinability theorem (Satz I) of the 1936 paper, the theorem and the sketch of the proof {{were added to the}} paper only after the paper was sent to print. When he presented the paper to the Warsaw Academy of Science on March 21, 1931, he wrote only some conjectures instead of the results after his own investigations and partly after Gödel's <b>short</b> <b>report</b> on the incompleteness theorems [...] "Einige metamathematische Resultate über Entscheidungsdefinitheit und Widerspruchsfreiheit", Akd. der Wiss. in Wien, 1930.|$|E
2500|$|It was Riggs' field {{assistant}} H. W. Menke {{who found}} FMNHP25107, on July 4, 1900. The locality, Riggs Quarry 13, {{was found on}} a small hill later known as Riggs Hill; it {{is marked by a}} plaque. Additional Brachiosaurus fossils are reported on Riggs Hill, but other fossil finds on the hill have been vandalized. Riggs published a <b>short</b> <b>report</b> in 1901, noting the unusual length of the humerus compared to the femur and the extreme overall size and the resulting giraffe-like proportions, as well as the lesser development of the tail, but did not publish a name for the new dinosaur. The titles of Riggs (1901) and (1903) suggested that the specimen was the largest known dinosaur. Riggs followed his 1903 publication that named Brachiosaurus altithorax with a more detailed description in a monograph in 1904. Riggs derived the genus name from the Greek brachion/βραχιων meaning [...] "arm" [...] and sauros/σαυρος meaning [...] "lizard", because he realized that the length of the arms was unusual for a sauropod. The species epithet [...] "altithorax" [...] was chosen because of the unusually deep and wide chest cavity, from Latin altus meaning [...] "deep" [...] and Greek thorax/θώραξ (Latin thorax), meaning [...] "breastplate, cuirass, corslet".|$|E

60|$|My <b>short</b> <b>report</b> {{of myself}} {{is that we}} had an {{enormous}} turn-away last night, and do not doubt about having a cram to-night. The day has been very fine, and I have turned it to the wholesomest account by walking on the sands at New Brighton all the morning.

60|$|There was {{a general}} {{expression}} of assent, for all felt that in an equal fight the Boers, being twice their own numbers, {{would have been more}} than a match for them. It was evening when they returned to Dundee, having come across no more Boers during the day's work. Directly they arrived at the little camp where they had left the tents standing in charge of their two Kaffirs, Chris wrote a <b>short</b> <b>report</b> of their doings, stating briefly that they had come upon a party of forty-five Boers in the act of driving off the cattle and sacking the house of Mr. Fraser, a loyal settler. Having dismounted and divided into two parties, they had attacked the Boers and driven them off, with the loss of ten killed and eight seriously wounded left on the field. Many of their horses had been killed. The wounded Boers had been sent in a cart to Vant's Drift, and the farmer and his herds had been escorted as far as the line of railway, which they had crossed and were making for Ladysmith. There had been no casualties among his party.|$|E
60|$|The {{captain was}} about to turn away to examine the {{position}} of the cutter, when Mr. Dodge asked permission to make a <b>short</b> <b>report</b> in behalf of the minority of the comity (committee), the amount of which was, that they agreed in all things with the majority, except on the point that, as it might become expedient for the ship to anchor again in some of the ports lower down the Channel, {{it would be wise to}} keep that material circumstance in view, in making up a final decision in the affair. This report, on the part of the minority, which, Mr. Dodge explained to the baronet, partook rather of the character of a caution than of a protest, had quite as little influence on Captain Truck as the opinion of the majority, for he was just one of those persons who seldom took advice that did not conform with his own previous decision; but he coolly continued to examine the cutter, which by this time was standing on the same course as the ship, a short distance to windward of her, and edging a little off the wind, so as to bring the two nearer to each other, every yard they advanced.|$|E
