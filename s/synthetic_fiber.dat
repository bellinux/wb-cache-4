5|$|Gliders {{are often}} {{launched}} using a stationary ground-based winch {{mounted on a}} heavy vehicle. This method is widely used at many European clubs, often {{in addition to an}} aerotow service. The engine is usually powered by LPG, petrol or diesel, though hydraulic fluid engines and electrical motors are also used. The winch pulls in a 1,000 to 2,500-metre (3,000 to 7,500ft) cable, made of high-tensile steel wire or a <b>synthetic</b> <b>fiber,</b> attached to the glider. The cable is released at a height of about 35% of the cable length after a short, steep ride. A strong headwind will result in higher launches.|$|E
25|$|The {{plastics}} {{industry was}} revolutionized in the 1930s with {{the announcement of}} polyamide (PA), far better known by its trade name nylon. Nylon was the first purely <b>synthetic</b> <b>fiber,</b> introduced by DuPont Corporation at the 1939 World's Fair in New York City.|$|E
25|$|Spandex is a <b>synthetic</b> <b>fiber</b> {{known for}} its {{exceptional}} elasticity that is typically worn as apparel for exercising and in gymnastics. Spandex is stronger and more durable than rubber, its major non-synthetic competitor. Spandex was invented in 1959 by DuPont chemist Joseph Shivers.|$|E

25|$|<b>Synthetic</b> <b>fibers</b> are {{the result}} of {{extensive}} development by scientists to improve upon the naturally occurring animal and plant <b>fibers.</b> In general, <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibers</b> are created by forcing, or extruding, fiber forming materials through holes (called spinnerets) into the air, thus forming a thread. Before <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibers</b> were developed, cellulose fibers were made from natural cellulose, which comes from plants.|$|R
50|$|<b>Synthetic</b> <b>fibers</b> {{are made}} of various {{different}} <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibers,</b> but contain no human hair. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>fibers,</b> just like human hair, come in weave (weft) and single strands (bulk) for braids. They do not {{last as long as}} human hair because they can be easily damaged by friction and heat. The quality of fibers varies greatly. Depending on quality, they may never look like human hair, as they can be stiff and move differently from human hair. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>fibers</b> are much less expensive than human hair. Heating appliances such as curling irons, flat irons, and straightening combs generally should never be used on most types of synthetic hair. There are some newer versions of <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibers</b> that are more resistant, human-like fibers that can be heat processed allowing for heat styling.|$|R
25|$|To {{stay warm}} in a {{membrane}} suit, the wearer must wear an insulating undersuit, today typically made with polyester or other <b>synthetic</b> <b>fiber</b> batting. Polyester and other synthetics are preferred over natural materials, since synthetic materials have better insulating properties when damp or wet from sweat, seepage, or a leak.|$|E
25|$|Hill also {{produced}} a <b>synthetic</b> <b>fiber</b> that was elastic and strong by combining glycols and diacids and heating under reduced pressure, using a molecular still {{to remove the}} last traces of water produced in the condensation reaction. Unfortunately, the fiber produced could not be commercialized because it reverted to a sticky mass when placed in hot water. Carothers dropped his research on polymers for several years.|$|E
25|$|Kevlar is the {{registered}} trademark for a para-aramid <b>synthetic</b> <b>fiber,</b> related to other aramids such as Nomex and Technora. Developed by Stephanie Kwolek at DuPont in 1965, this high-strength material was first commercially {{used in the}} early 1970s {{as a replacement for}} steel in racing tires. Typically it is spun into ropes or fabric sheets that can be used as such or as an ingredient in composite material components.|$|E

50|$|<b>Synthetic</b> <b>fibers</b> (British English: <b>synthetic</b> fibres) are {{the result}} of {{extensive}} research by scientists to improve on naturally occurring animal and plant <b>fibers.</b> In general, <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibers</b> are created by extruding fiber forming materials through spinnerets into air and water, forming a thread. Before <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibers</b> were developed, artificially manufactured fibers were made from polymers obtained from petrochemicals. These <b>fibers</b> are called <b>synthetic</b> or artificial fibres. Some fibers are manufactured from plant-derived cellulose.|$|R
50|$|This {{is also an}} {{explanation}} for the fact that wool mixed with <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibers</b> is more difficult to set than pure wool. Setting <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibers</b> is only possible beyond a temperature range of 85 to 95 °C. In contrast, pure wool can set very well at these temperatures.|$|R
25|$|Kevlar is the {{registered}} trademark for a light, strong para-aramid <b>synthetic</b> <b>fiber.</b> Typically it is spun into ropes or fabric sheets {{that can be}} used as such or as an ingredient in composite material components. Currently, Kevlar has many applications, ranging from bicycle tires and racing sails to body armor because of its high strength-to-weight ratio. Invented at DuPont in 1965 by Stephanie Kwolek, Kevlar was first commercially used in the early 1970s as a replacement for steel in racing tires.|$|E
25|$|Another {{claim is}} that Mellon, Secretary of the Treasury and the wealthiest man in America at that time, had {{invested}} heavily in DuPont's new <b>synthetic</b> <b>fiber,</b> nylon, and believed that {{the replacement of the}} traditional resource, hemp, was integral to the new product's success. The company DuPont and many industrial historians dispute a link between nylon and hemp, nylon became immediately a scarce commodity. Nylon had characteristics {{that could be used for}} toothbrushes (sold from 1938) and very thin nylon fiber could compete with silk and rayon in various textiles normally not produced from hemp fiber, such as very thin stockings for women.|$|E
25|$|On modern yachts, {{standing}} rigging is often {{stainless steel wire}}, stainless steel rod or <b>synthetic</b> <b>fiber.</b> Semi-rigid stainless steel wire {{is by far the}} most common as it combines extreme strength, relative ease of assembling and rigging with reliability. Unlike rigid stainless steel rod, it is comparatively easy to recognize wear and stress as individual strains (normally 19) break often near a swage fitting, and can be inspected while standing. Solid rod stainless steel is more aerodynamic so is often used in extreme racing yachts but it is difficult to see stress as this requires x-raying. Great care must be used when swaging fittings onto stainless steel rod as this can start minute cracking. Rod-type stays fail suddenly, often where the rod bends around a spreader. Bending can induce unseen stress fractures.|$|E
30|$|The {{addition}} {{rate and}} time of addition of the <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibers</b> were not considered significant (W. R. Grace Co., Grace Concrete Products 2011). The drum has to be rotated rapidly, 12 – 18 revolutions per minute, for a minimum duration of 5  min following the addition of <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibers.</b> The amounts of fibers added are normally not weighed, neither the steel nor the <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibers,</b> but the sacks are counted, and rounded off to the nearest half sack (Nikolaisen 2010). Refer to the Appendix regarding truck delivery-slip information on batches.|$|R

40|$|Exposure to <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibers</b> with {{employment}} in textile mills can {{be associated with}} an elevated risk of interstitial lung disease (ILD). A mechanism of injury has not been determined. ILD can follow exposures to inorganic fibers (e. g., asbestos) which are associated with a mobilization of iron and catalysis of an oxidative stress. We describe 2 patients with ILD associated with exposure to <b>synthetic</b> textile <b>fibers</b> who demonstrated carbon-based ferruginous bodies suggesting an in vivo accumulation of iron by <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibers</b> after deposition in the lung. These iron-laden bodies varied from perfectly linear fibers to almost particulate matter. Linear structures were irregularly interrupted by deposition of iron-abundant material. The capacity of these <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibers</b> to complex iron and generate an oxidative stress is confirmed in vitro...|$|R
25|$|To avoid anistropic {{shrinkage}} {{and cell}} collapse during the drying of the waterlogged wood recovered, the architectural members {{were treated with}} polyethylene glycol (PEG), a <b>Synthetic</b> <b>fiber</b> polymer used gradually to replace the water content before permanent hardening. This treatment methodology {{was introduced in the}} late 60s and early 70s in Denmark to conserve the Skuldelev ships and in Sweden for the Vasa. In Japan it was used first on wooden tablets from Gangō-ji and then in 1972 on parts from the Kodera dam site in Matsuyama. Although this treatment is irreversible and leads to visual darkening, consolidation with PEG also makes the wood inedible thus helping prevent biodeterioration; since Japanese Buddhist architecture makes use of joinery rather than metal pins, the incompatibility of PEG with associated metal components was not a concern; PEG is the most common choice of consolidant for such applications, and has since been used on the Bremen cog and Mary Rose. Since PEG has an affinity with water, it is necessary to maintain artefacts treated in this way in a stable low-humidity environment. Designated an Important Cultural Property, the excavated artefacts are now stored and displayed at the Asuka Historical Museum.|$|E

2500|$|Hanil <b>Synthetic</b> <b>Fiber</b> (...) , a {{textiles}} company, {{was founded}} in 1964, but went into court receivership after the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Tong Yang Major acquired Hanil <b>Synthetic</b> <b>Fiber</b> in 2007. The acquisition resulted in an investigation {{to determine whether the}} ₩374.5 billion acquisition had violated laws against leveraged buyouts. Tong Yang Major had created a special purpose vehicle which issued debt to finance the acquisition of Hanil, and then used Hanil's cash reserves to repay much of the debt. However, the trial court disagreed with prosecutors that this was a breach of fiduciary duty by Tong Yang Major directors or that this had resulted in economic harm to Hanil. Both an appellate court and the Supreme Court of South Korea upheld the trial court's ruling.|$|E

2500|$|However, a rigid {{enclosure}} reflects sound internally, {{which can}} then be transmitted back through the loudspeaker diaphragm—again resulting in degradation of sound quality. This can be reduced by internal absorption using absorptive materials (often called [...] "damping"), such as glass wool, wool, or <b>synthetic</b> <b>fiber</b> batting, within the enclosure. The internal shape of the enclosure can also be designed to reduce this by reflecting sounds away from the loudspeaker diaphragm, where they may then be absorbed.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{artificial}} fiber, {{known as}} art silk from 1799 onwards, {{became known as}} viscose around 1894, and finally rayon in 1924. A similar product known as cellulose acetate was discovered in 1865. Rayon and acetate are both artificial fibers, but not truly synthetic, being made from wood. Although these artificial fibers were discovered in the mid-nineteenth century, successful modern manufacture began much later in the 1930s. Nylon, the first <b>synthetic</b> <b>fiber,</b> made its debut in the United States {{as a replacement for}} silk, and was used for parachutes and other military uses.|$|E
2500|$|The hair {{of the bow}} {{traditionally}} {{comes from}} {{the tail of a}} grey male horse (which has predominantly white hair), though some cheaper bows use <b>synthetic</b> <b>fiber.</b> Occasional rubbing with rosin makes the hair grip the strings intermittently, causing them to vibrate. Originally the stick was made out of snakewood, but modern day bows are now traditionally made of brazilwood, although a stick made from a more select quality (and more expensive) brazilwood is called pernambuco. Both types come from the same tree species. Some student bows are made of fiberglass or various inexpensive woods. [...] Some recent bow design innovations use carbon fiber for the stick, at all levels of craftsmanship. Inexpensive bows for students are made of fiberglass.|$|E

While the consumption of all fibers rose, the share of natural fibers declined dramatically, making <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibers</b> ubiquitous. In 1940, the first full year of nylon production, the United States consumed a total of five billion pounds of fibers, of which 10 % were cellulosic, rayon and acetate, and less than. 1 % were nylon.
