5|$|Péron did {{not report}} seeing any emus on the island himself, which might explain why he {{described}} them as being the size of mainland birds. Instead, most {{of what is known}} about the King Island emu today stems from a 33-point questionnaire that he used to interview a local English <b>sealer,</b> Daniel Cooper, about the bird. In accordance with a request by the authorities for the expedition to bring back useful plants and animals, Péron asked if the emus could be bred and fattened in captivity, and received a variety of cooking recipes. Péron's questionnaire remained unpublished until 1899, and very little was therefore known about the bird in life until then.|$|E

Quest, smaller than any recent Antarctic exploration vessel, soon proved inadequate for its task, and progress south was delayed by its poor sailing performance and by frequent engine problems. Before the expedition's work could properly begin, Shackleton died on board the ship, just after its arrival at the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia.|$|E

The aim of this review was to consider laboratory experiments and clinical studies of these <b>sealers.</b> An extensive search of the endodontic literature was made to identify publications related to bioceramic-based root canal <b>sealers.</b> The outcome of laboratory and clinical studies on the biological and physical properties of bioceramic-based <b>sealers</b> along with comparative studies with other <b>sealers</b> was assessed. Several studies were evaluated covering different properties of bioceramic-based <b>sealers</b> including physical properties, biocompatibility, sealing ability, adhesion, solubility, and antibacterial efficacy.

30|$|<b>Sealers</b> are {{solvent-based}} liquids {{that are}} applied to a prepared concrete surface to prevent the entry of liquid water and harmful ions (Holland 1992; Paul 1998), in order to mitigate corrosion, alkali-aggregate reaction, {{and other forms of}} deterioration. <b>Sealers</b> can be classified into penetrating <b>sealers</b> and surface <b>sealers.</b> Penetrating <b>sealers</b> react with the pore structure within hardened concrete to create a nonwettable surface, in order to prevent liquid water from entering the concrete. However, they are very permeable to water vapor (Cady 1994; Henry 2004; ACI 345.1 R- 06 Guide for Maintenance of Concrete Bridge Members 2006; Al-Gahtani et al. 1999; Silano 1993).|$|R
50|$|The most {{penetrating}} <b>sealers</b> use siliconates, fluoro-polymers and siloxanes, which repel liquids. These <b>sealers</b> {{penetrate the}} surface of the stone enough to anchor the material to the surface. They are generally longer lasting than topical <b>sealers</b> and often do not substantially alter the look of the stone, but still can change the slip characteristics of the surface and do wear relatively quickly. Penetrating <b>sealers</b> often require the use of special cleaners which both clean and top up the repellent ingredient left on the stone surface. These <b>sealers</b> are often breathable to a certain degree, but do not penetrate deeply enough (generally less than 1mm) to be effective against salt attack, such as efflorescence and spalling.|$|R
5|$|Amundsen {{was born}} in Fredrikstad (around 80km from Christiania (now Oslo)), Norway, in 1872, {{the son of a}} ship-owner. In 1893, he {{abandoned}} his medical studies at Christiania University and signed up as a seaman aboard the <b>sealer</b> Magdalena for a voyage to the Arctic. After several further voyages he qualified as a second mate; when not at sea, he developed his skills as a cross-country skier in the harsh environment of Norway's Hardangervidda plateau. In 1896, inspired by the polar exploits of his countryman Fridtjof Nansen, Amundsen joined the Belgian Antarctic Expedition as mate, aboard Belgica under Adrien de Gerlache. Early in 1898 the ship became trapped by pack ice in the Bellinghausen Sea, and was held fast for almost a year. The expedition thus became, involuntarily, the first to spend a complete winter in Antarctic waters, a period marked by depression, near-starvation, insanity, and scurvy among the crew. Amundsen remained dispassionate, recording everything and using the experience as an education in all aspects of polar exploration techniques, particularly aids, clothing and diet.|$|E
5|$|Born in Oslo in 1864 to a Norwegian {{father and}} an English mother, Carsten Borchgrevink emigrated to Australia in 1888, {{where he worked}} on survey teams in the {{interior}} before accepting a provincial schoolteaching appointment in New South Wales. In 1894 he joined a commercial expedition, led by Henryk Bull in the whaler Antarctic, which penetrated Antarctic waters and reached Cape Adare, the western portal to the Ross Sea. A party including Bull and Borchgrevink briefly landed there and {{claimed to be the}} first men to set foot on the Antarctic continent—although the American <b>sealer</b> John Davis believed he had landed on the Antarctic Peninsula in 1821. They also visited Possession Island in the Ross Sea, leaving a message in a tin box as proof of their journey. Borchgrevink was convinced that the Cape Adare location, with its huge penguin rookery providing a ready supply of fresh food and blubber, could serve as a base at which a future expedition could overwinter and subsequently explore the Antarctic interior.|$|E
5|$|Europeans {{discovered}} the King Island emu in 1802 during early expeditions to the island, {{and most of}} what is known about the bird in life comes from an interview French naturalist François Péron conducted with a <b>sealer</b> there, as well as depictions by artist Charles Alexandre Lesueur. They had arrived on King Island in 1802 with Nicolas Baudin's expedition, and in 1804 several live and stuffed King and Kangaroo Island emus were sent to France. The two live King Island specimens were kept in the Jardin des Plantes, and the remains of these and the other birds are scattered throughout various museums in Europe today. The logbooks of the expedition did not specify from which island each captured bird originated, or even that they were taxonomically distinct, so their status remained unclear until more than a century later. Hunting pressure and fires started by early settlers on King Island likely drove the wild population to extinction by 1805. The two captive specimens in Paris both died in 1822 and are believed to have been the last of their kind.|$|E

50|$|Kokkas et al. (2004) {{examined}} {{the effect of}} the smear layer on the penetration depth of three different <b>sealers</b> (AH Plus, Apexit, and a Grossman type-Roth 811) into the dentinal tubules. Sixty four extracted human single-rooted teeth were used and divided into two groups. The smear layer remained intact in all the roots of group A. Complete removal of the smear layer in group B was achieved after irrigation with 3 ml of 17% EDTA for 3 min, followed by 3 ml of 1% NaOCl solution. Ten roots from each group were obturated with AH Plus and laterally condensed gutta-percha points. The same process was repeated for the remaining roots by using <b>sealers</b> Apexit and Roth 811 correspondingly. After complete setting, the maximum penetration depth of the <b>sealers</b> into the dentinal tubules was examined in upper, middle, and lower levels. The smear layer prevented all the <b>sealers</b> from penetrating dentinal tubules. In contrast, in smear layer-free root canals, all the <b>sealers</b> penetrated dentinal tubules, although the depth of penetration varied between the <b>sealers.</b> Furthermore smear layer adversely affected the coronal and apical sealing ability of <b>sealers.</b>|$|R
5|$|Shackleton {{intended}} {{to arrive in}} Antarctica in January 1908, which meant leaving England during the 1907 summer. He therefore had six months to secure the financing, acquire and fit out a ship, buy all the equipment and supplies, and recruit the personnel. In April, believing that he had got the backing of Scottish businessman Donald Steuart, Shackleton travelled to Norway intending to buy a 700-ton polar vessel, Bjorn, that would have served ideally as an expedition ship. When Steuart withdrew his support, however, Bjorn was beyond Shackleton's means. Bjorn was eventually acquired by German explorer Wilhelm Filchner and, renamed Deutschland, was used in his 1911–13 voyage to the Weddell Sea. Shackleton {{had to settle for}} the elderly, much smaller Nimrod, a 40-year-old wooden <b>sealer</b> of 334 gross register tons, which he was able to acquire for £5,000 (updated value £).|$|E
5|$|In {{a lecture}} given in 1884 to the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters Dr. Henrik Mohn, {{one of the}} founders of modern meteorology, argued that the finding of the Jeannette relics {{indicated}} the existence of an ocean current flowing from east to west across the entire Arctic Ocean. The Danish governor of Julianehaab, writing of the find, surmised that an expedition frozen into the Siberian sea might, if its ship were to prove strong enough, cross the polar ocean and land in South Greenland. These theories were read with interest by the 23-year-old Fridtjof Nansen, then working as a curator at the Bergen Museum while completing his doctoral studies. Nansen was already captivated by the frozen north; two years earlier he had experienced a four-month voyage on the <b>sealer</b> Viking, which had included three weeks trapped in drifting ice. An expert skier, Nansen was making plans to lead the first crossing of the Greenland icecap, an objective delayed by the demands of his academic studies, but triumphantly achieved in 1888–89. Through these years Nansen remembered the east–west Arctic drift theory and its inherent possibilities for further polar exploration, and shortly after his return from Greenland he was ready to announce his plans.|$|E

5000|$|Some of {{the women}} were taken back to the islands by the <b>sealers</b> involuntarily and some went willingly, {{as in the case of}} a woman called Tarerenorerer (Eng:Walyer). Differing {{opinions}} have been given on Walyer's involvement with the <b>sealers.</b> McFarlane writes that she voluntarily joined the <b>sealers</b> with members of her family, and was responsible for attacking Aboriginal people and white settlers alike.However, Ryan comes to a different conclusion, that Walyer had been abducted at Port Sorell by Aboriginal people and traded to the <b>sealers</b> for dogs and flour. Walyer was later to gain some notoriety for her attempts to kill the <b>sealers</b> to escape their brutality. Walyer, a Punnilerpanner, joined the Plairhekehillerplue band after eventually escaping and went on to lead attacks on employees of the Van Diemen's Land Company. Walyer's attacks are the first recorded use of muskets by Aboriginal people. Captured, she refused to work and was banished to Penguin Island. Later imprisoned on Swan Island she attempted to organise a rebellion. Although Aboriginal women were by custom forbidden to take part in war, several Aboriginal women who escaped from <b>sealers</b> became leaders or took part in attacks. According to Lyndall Ryan, the women traded to, or kidnapped by <b>sealers</b> became [...] "a significant dissident group" [...] against white authority.|$|R
