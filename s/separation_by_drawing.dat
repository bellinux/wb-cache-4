40|$|This paper 1 {{addresses}} performance {{issues in}} the source <b>separation</b> problem. <b>By</b> <b>drawing</b> on the theory of optimal statistic matching, we derive new contrast functions which are optimal among those involving a given set of cumulants. In low noise, the optimal combination of {{a particular set of}} cumulants are shown to be parameter independent and can be pre-computed. We give specific exemples in close form for several choices of 2 nd and 4 th order cumulants. The resulting performance is investigated {{as a function of the}} SNR and of the non gaussianity of the source signals and further compared to suboptimal approaches. 1. INTRODUCTION Source separation algorithms assume a linear model for a vector x(t) of observations: x(t) = As(t) + n(t) (1) where matrix A is m Θ n with full column rank, n(t) is additive noise and s(t) is a vector of n Θ 1 independent components, s 1 (t); : : :; sn(t) : the so-called `source signals'. Source separation consists of recovering the source signals an [...] ...|$|R

50|$|A {{hydrocyclone}} (often {{referred to}} by the shortened form cyclone) is a device to classify, separate or sort particles in a liquid suspension based on the ratio of their centripetal force to fluid resistance.

Hydrocyclones also find application in the separation of liquids of different densities.|$|R
