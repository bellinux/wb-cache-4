25|$|In {{consequence}} of this the senate decreed that, whenever any public show was given anywhere, the first row of seats should be reserved for senators; and at Rome he would not allow the envoys of the free and allied nations {{to sit in the}} orchestra, since he was informed that even freedmen were sometimes appointed. He separated the soldiery from the people. He assigned special seats to the married men of the commons, to boys under age their own section and the adjoining one to their preceptors; and he decreed that no one wearing a dark cloak <b>should</b> <b>sit</b> {{in the middle of the}} house. He would not allow women to view even the gladiators except from the upper seats, though it had been the custom for men and women to sit together at such shows. Only the Vestal virgins were assigned a place to themselves, opposite the praetor's tribunal.|$|E
25|$|Two {{opposing}} {{views of}} Saul {{are found in}} classical rabbinical literature. One {{is based on the}} reverse logic that punishment is a proof of guilt, and therefore seeks to rob Saul of any halo which might surround him; typically this view is similar to the republican source. The passage referring to Saul as a choice young man, and goodly (1 Samuel 9:2) is in this view interpreted as meaning that Saul was not good in every respect, but goodly only with respect to his personal appearance (Num. Rashi 9:28). According to this view, Saul is only a weak branch (Gen. Rashi 25:3), owing his kingship not to his own merits, but rather to his grandfather, who had been accustomed to light the streets for those who went to the bet ha-midrash, and had received as his reward the promise that one of his grandsons <b>should</b> <b>sit</b> upon the throne (Lev. Rashi 9:2).|$|E
25|$|The media {{looked to}} the two {{previous}} occasions when the reserve powers of the governor general were used in respect to declining {{the advice of the}} prime minister: The first was in 1896, when Charles Tupper refused to resign as prime minister following his party's loss in the election and Governor General the Earl of Aberdeen refused his advice to make several appointments, forcing Tupper to relinquish office. The second was in 1926, during the King-Byng Affair, when Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, already in minority government and having lost two votes that suggested he was likely to lose a third vote—one on a confidence question—asked Governor General the Viscount Byng of Vimy to dissolve parliament. Byng refused on the grounds that parliament was still viable and <b>should</b> <b>sit</b> for a reasonable period before a new election could be called, and then only if members of parliament were demonstrably unable to work together to form an alternate government.|$|E

[...] "The Deal" [...] is the first episode in which Elaine's apartment is shown. During rehearsals controversy arose over how Jerry and Elaine would sit during their [...] "this and that" [...] conversation. Several producers believed that, as the scene was intimate, the two <b>should</b> <b>sit</b> close together. David, however, believed the discussion {{was more of a}} transaction than an intimate scene and felt that Jerry and Elaine <b>should</b> <b>sit</b> further apart.

In 2013 he said on Polish {{television}} that homosexual people have no right to a prominent role in politics, [...] "They have to know that they are a minority and must adjust to smaller things". He also said homosexual MPs <b>should</b> <b>sit</b> [...] "behind a wall" [...] in a parliament. Despite sharp international criticism and a legal complaint of [...] "propaganda of hate against a sexual minority", Wałęsa refused to apologize for his comments. At a political rally in 2000, he described gay people as [...] "sick" [...] and said, [...] "I believe those people need medical treatment". During the drawing up of a new Polish Constitution in 1995, President Wałęsa argued against the inclusion of gay rights provisions. In 2014 City authorities of San Francisco renamed Walesa Street because of his [...] "anti-gay remarks". A deputy speaker of the Polish Parliament said Wałęsa's anti-gay position could jeopardize his international career as a human rights speaker.|$|E
500|$|Æthelbald's {{rebellion}} {{was supported}} by Ealhstan, Bishop of Sherborne, and Eanwulf, ealdorman of Somerset, even though {{they appear to have}} been two of the king's most trusted advisers. According to Asser, the plot was concerted [...] "in the western part of Selwood", and western nobles may have backed Æthelbald because they resented the patronage Æthelwulf gave to eastern Wessex. Asser also stated that Æthelwulf agreed to give up the western part of his kingdom in order to avoid a civil war. Some historians such as Keynes and Abels think that his rule was then confined to the south-east, while others such as Kirby think {{it is more likely that}} it was Wessex itself which was divided, with Æthelbald keeping Wessex west of Selwood, Æthelwulf holding the centre and east, and Æthelberht keeping the south-east. Æthelwulf insisted that Judith <b>should</b> <b>sit</b> beside him on the throne until the end of his life, and according to Asser this was [...] "without any disagreement or dissatisfaction on the part of his nobles".|$|E

500|$|The Norwegian Airline Pilots Association {{recommended}} that its members not {{cooperate with the}} police in any way, stating that [...] "the police <b>should</b> <b>sit</b> passively {{and wait for the}} report from the commission". On 17 November the issue was brought to Parliament by the Liberal Party's Lars Sponheim, but Minister of Transport and Communications Kjell Opseth stated {{that he did not want}} to interfere. In January 1994, the police announced that they would bring six Widerøe pilots to court to force them to undergo police questioning. The six pilots were the two that piloted the previous shift on the aircraft, two that landed at Namsos Airport half an hour before the accident, and the two that had test-flown after the previous maintenance spell some days before the accident. In February, HSL started extensive investigations of the culture among pilots in Widerøe, and initiated interviews with dozens of pilots and managers in the company to investigate systematic failures in the company. Salten District Court ruled in April in favor of court questioning of the pilots. In May, the police brought the demands to receive the CVR in to Namdal District Court. A ruling was not made until December, which supported the police's demands. However, the issue was appealed by the accident board and the ministry. The issue was not resolved until August 1995, when Frostating Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and required the tape to be handed over to the police. After the tape was handed over, both the pilots in Widerøe and the accident board would not cooperate deciphering the contents, nor would they hand over transcripts or notes, and asked the police take the matter to the courts if they needed any further assistance.|$|E
