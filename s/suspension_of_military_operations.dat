40|$|AbstractFrom time immemorial, vector-borne {{diseases}} have severely reduced the fighting capacity of armies and caused <b>suspension</b> or cancellation <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>operations.</b> Since World War I, infectious diseases have no longer {{been the main}} causes {{of morbidity and mortality}} among soldiers. However, most recent conflicts involving Western armies have occurred overseas, increasing the risk of vector-borne disease for the soldiers and for the displaced populations. The threat of vector-borne disease has changed with the progress in hygiene and disease control within the military: some diseases have lost their military significance (e. g. plague, yellow fever, and epidemic typhus); others remain of concern (e. g. malaria and dengue fever); and new potential threats have appeared (e. g. West Nile encephalitis and chikungunya fever). For this reason, vector control and personal protection strategies are always major requirements in ensuring the operational readiness of armed forces. Scientific progress has allowed a reduction in the impact of arthropod-borne diseases on military forces, but the threat is always present, and a failure in the context of vector control or in the application of personal protection measures could allow these diseases to have the same devastating impact on human health and military readiness {{as they did in the}} past...|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the role and}} function of the rules on the use <b>of</b> force for <b>military</b> <b>operations</b> in terms <b>of</b> the interaction between international and national law applicable to such operations and the actual conduct of the operations in question. In doing so, this study focused on examining whether the rules {{on the use of}} force could be considered a linchpin between the law, including the academic study of the law, and the actual conduct <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>operations</b> in practice. Following an introduction to general concepts related to the rules on the use of force and the planning <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>operations,</b> the study {{analyzes the}} role of the rules on the use of force (ROE) in regards to the application of (the law of) self-defense, international humanitarian law, international human rights law and international and national criminal law in the context <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>operations.</b> Based on the constituent chapters, the conclusion of this study re-examines the classical conceptual model of ROE and establishes that the actual interaction between the constituent elements and the conduct of operations requires a refinement of that model. In the new conceptual model presented in this study, the influences of the operational, political and legal element on ROE and the conduct of operations are shown in their proper perspective. The study shows that while the law affects the conduct <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>operations</b> directly, the ROE serve as a linchpin between the international law <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>operations,</b> including academic developments, and the conduct <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>operations...</b>|$|R
