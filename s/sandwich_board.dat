He cycled there from Northolt with a <b>sandwich</b> <b>board</b> attached to the bicycle, a journey of 12 miles (19 km) that could take up to two hours, until he was given a bus pass when he turned 65.|$|E
25|$|Minifigures {{have also}} {{featured}} unique head sculpts {{that differ from}} the traditional cylindrical shape; the first was Jar Jar Binks, included in a Star Wars set in 1999, followed by Yoda, C-3PO, Harry Potter goblin figures, Kit Fisto, and Plo Koon. Kit Fisto was the first minifigure to not use an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene head. The minifigure used rubber instead. Traditional accessories, such as hats and helmets, cannot be placed on these non-standard heads. Some minifigures, such as Wookiees, Gamorrean Guards and Ewoks use a <b>sandwich</b> <b>board</b> piece which fits over the body. SpongeBob has a sculpted Lego brick head that fits like a standard head, similar to the ghost figures, except that these figures use short or standard legs instead of a brick.|$|E
500|$|Grant {{became a}} part of the {{vaudeville}} circuit and began touring. After performing in places such as St. Louis, Missouri, Cleveland and Milwaukee, he made the decision to stay in the US with several of the other members, {{while the rest of the}} troupe returned to Britain. He remembered becoming fond of the performances of the Marx Brothers during this period and Zeppo Marx was an early role model for him. In July 1922, Grant performed in a group with seven others, the [...] "Knockabout Comedians", at the Palace Theatre on Broadway. He formed a group that summer, [...] "The Walking Stanleys", with several of the former members of the Pender Troupe, and starred in a variety show named [...] "Better Times" [...] at the Hippodrome towards the end of the year. After meeting George C. Tilyou, the owner of the Steeplechase Park racecourse on Coney Island at a party, Grant was hired to appear there on stilts and attracted large crowds, wearing a bright-great coat and a <b>sandwich</b> <b>board</b> which advertised the race-track.|$|E
50|$|WPC boards show good set of {{performance}} but monolithic composite sheets are relatively heavy (most often heavier than pure plastics) which limits their use to applications where low weight is not essential. WPC in a sandwich-structured composite form allow for {{combination of the}} benefits of traditional wood polymer composites with the lightness of a sandwich panel technology. WPC <b>sandwich</b> <b>boards</b> consist of wood polymer composite skins and usually low density polymer core which leads to a very effective increase of panel's rigidity. WPC <b>sandwich</b> <b>boards</b> are used mainly in automotive, transportation and building applications, but furniture applications are also being developed. New efficient and often in-line integrated production processes allow to produce stronger and stiffer WPC <b>sandwich</b> <b>boards</b> at lower costs compared to traditional plastic sheets or monolithic WPC panels.|$|R

50|$|The carried {{version is}} usually {{attached}} to straps acting as suspenders, allowing the person wearing the boards {{to carry the}} weight {{on his or her}} shoulders and keeping the boards balanced on the wearer. <b>Sandwich</b> <b>boards</b> are most typically deployed in busy pedestrian areas and advertise businesses within easy walking distance. The wearer might also pass out flyers or shout advertising slogans. <b>Sandwich</b> <b>boards</b> were most popular in the 19th century, and have largely been supplanted by billboards, which are more effective in advertising to passers-by who are now likely to be in automobiles, rather than traveling by foot.|$|R
500|$|Lonsdale, never a Scientologist himself, became {{critical}} of the Church of Scientology in mid-2006, and often stood outside in downtown Clearwater near Scientology's spiritual headquarters wearing a <b>sandwich</b> <b>board</b> sign that read [...] "Cult Watch". Lonsdale became interested in Scientology after getting into a fight with a Scientologist over redevelopment issues while at a City Council meeting. After the Scientologist followed Lonsdale's car home and Lonsdale noticed a van {{parked in front of}} his home for two hours the following day, he began to research the background of Scientology on anti-Scientology sites on the Internet and in the library. He taped hours of footage of Scientology staffers, security guards, and verbal confrontations with Scientologists, and edited clips into a pseudo-documentary which aired on local public-access television. Lonsdale dropped fliers outside downtown businesses and picked through trash from a Scientology-owned business and posted documents online. He parked outside a Scientology cafeteria with posters in his car window which stated that key Scientology texts were available for free on the Internet: [...] "OT I-VIII for free at xenu.net." ...|$|E

On {{the last day of}} the convention, she spotted Matuschka wearing the Vote for Yourself on her body much like a <b>sandwich</b> <b>board</b> at a strike. Ms. Ferrara interviewed the artist for the article she would title: [...] "The Politics of Breast Cancer".|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{his career}} Campese {{was known for}} his forthright views. The England rugby union team have often been criticised by Campese for what he has {{considered}} their boring and unadventurous play. Campese maintained his criticism of England after they were crowned world champions in 2003. However, following England's 2003 Rugby World Cup victory, Campese kept a promise to walk the length of Oxford Street wearing a <b>sandwich</b> <b>board</b> on which was the English flag overlaid with the words [...] "I admit, the best team won!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Rolo {{was arrested}} during the 1981 Australia Day parade {{and charged with}} [...] "behaviour likely to cause serious alarm and affront". He was wearing a <b>sandwich</b> <b>board</b> bearing anti-monarchist slogans such as [...] "Abolish the Monarchy" [...] and [...] "Royalists are kow-towing colonialists {{suffering}} from an inferiority complex" [...] and an offer to argue the topic with anyone who cared to pay 20 cents for the privilege. The magistrate dismissed the charge against him {{at the request of}} Rolo's barrister Wayne Flynn who had been hired by the NSW Council for Civil Liberties.|$|E
2500|$|In a March 2009 blog entry, Hertzfeldt {{compared}} filmmaking to {{his love}} of hiking and exploring new places: something he does just because he [...] "enjoys doing it and will probably always enjoy doing it." [...] He compared doing advertising to being paid to not go explore the woods, but to walk around someone's house {{eight hours a day}} wearing a <b>sandwich</b> <b>board</b> with a picture of a product on it. [...] "Money's not the reason I take walks. It doesn't really factor into it. I take walks because I enjoy doing it. It's something I'd do if I was rich, and it's something I'd do if I were poor." ...|$|E

Already his robust form, with an Embassy’s secret-service money (inherited from Mr Verloc) in his pockets, was marching {{in the gutter}} as if in training for the task of an inevitable future. Already he bowed his broad shoulders, his head of ambrosial locks, as if ready to receive the leather yoke of the <b>sandwich</b> <b>board.</b> As on that night, {{more than a week}} ago, Comrade Ossipon walked without looking where he put his feet, feeling no fatigue, feeling nothing, seeing nothing, hearing not a sound. “An impenetrable mystery.

2500|$|Actors {{were not}} {{listed in the}} credits in Griffith's company. Audiences noticed and {{identified}} Pickford within weeks of her first film appearance.

5000|$|Furthermore, besides holding signs, {{some human}} billboards would wear <b>sandwich</b> <b>boards.</b> Charles Dickens {{described}} these advertisers as [...] "a piece of human flesh between {{two slices of}} paste board".

50|$|Signs are {{any kind}} of visual {{graphics}} created to display information to a particular audience. This is typically manifested {{in the form of}} wayfinding information in places such as streets or on the inside and outside of buildings. Signs vary in form and size based on location and intent, from more expansive banners, billboards, and murals, to smaller street signs, street name signs, <b>sandwich</b> <b>boards</b> and lawn signs. Newer signs may also use digital or electronic displays.|$|R
