40|$|Original title: De school bestuurd. Until now, {{little was}} known about <b>school</b> <b>boards</b> in primary and {{secondary}} schools. This study presents a national overview {{of the way in}} which these <b>school</b> <b>boards</b> interpret and fulfil their role. More and different demands have been placed on <b>school</b> <b>boards</b> in recent years, for example with regard to transparency of governance and public accountability. In a national survey of <b>school</b> <b>boards,</b> the Netherlands Institute for Social Research/SCP explored what they think about their own role and about a number of current themes. A total of 500 <b>school</b> <b>boards</b> responded. This report shows how <b>school</b> <b>boards</b> are using or plan to use their increasing autonomy and what they themselves see as the criteria of good governance. Are all <b>school</b> <b>boards</b> prepared for this change? The report also looks at how far <b>school</b> <b>boards</b> believe their social responsibility extends and how important they consider socially desirable objectives (their 'social task'). The reducing ability of the government to guarantee attention for such social objectives via education makes this question all the more important. Naturally, many decisions are taken by school heads and management teams, but ultimate responsibility still rests with the <b>school</b> <b>boards,</b> even though they often govern on the main themes rather than the detail or play a more supervisory role...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project is to investigate if characteristics of <b>school</b> <b>boards</b> and their administrative control do explain variance among schools in pupil achievement in the cognitive domain.

A random sample of 133 <b>school</b> <b>boards</b> and one specific primary school, selected out {{of the total number}} of schools they oversee, was drawn. The findings show that characteristics of <b>school</b> <b>boards</b> do explain variance in cognitive achievement. Even after controlling for student background and <b>school</b> characteristics, <b>school</b> <b>boards</b> do make a difference. <b>School</b> <b>boards</b> that involve <b>school</b> team and parents (committee) in their decision-making process manage schools with relatively better results in the cognitive domain...|$|R
