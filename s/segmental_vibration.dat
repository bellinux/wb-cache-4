40|$|The {{acute and}} chronic effects of <b>segmental</b> <b>vibration</b> {{exposure}} to the hands are well documented (Noel, 2000). Chronic exposure to hand-transmitted vibration results in hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS), a disorder consisting of vascular, neurological and musculoskeletal pathology in the upper extremities. That a condition analogous to HAVS might occur in the feet after segmental lower-extremity vibration exposure is biologically plausible though not well studied; the presented case (Thompson et al., 2010) represents the first published report on this topic in the English language literature, with only one other case report in a non English journal (Tingsgard et al., 1994). 2. c a s e r e p o r t A 54 -year-old retired miner presented with a 2 - 3 yea...|$|E

Design: Single-blind, randomized controlled trial. Setting: Physical medicine and rehabilitation outpatients service. Subjects: Forty-two patients affected by the secondary progressive form of multiple sclerosis randomized to group A (30 minutes of 120 Hz <b>segmental</b> muscle <b>vibration</b> over the rectus femoris and gastrocnemius medial and lateral, three per week, over a period of four weeks), group B (botulinum toxin in the rectus femoris, gastrocnemius medial and lateral and soleus, and <b>segmental</b> muscle <b>vibration)</b> and group C (botulinum toxin). Main measures: Modified Ashworth Scale at knee and ankle, and Fatigue Severity Scale. All the measurements were performed at baseline (T 0), 10 weeks (T 1) and 22 weeks (T 2) postallocation. Results: Modified Ashworth Scale at knee and ankle significantly decreased over time (p < 0. 001) in all groups. Patients in group C displayed a significant increase of knee and ankle spasticity at T 2 when compared with T 1 (p < 0. 05). Fatigue Severity Scale values in groups A and C were significantly higher at T 0 [A: 53. 6 (2. 31); C: 48. 5 (2. 77) ] than at either T 1 [A: 48. 6 (2. 21); p = 0. 03; C: 43. 5 (3. 22); p = 0. 03] or T 2 [A: 46. 7 (2. 75); p = 0. 02; 42. 5 (2. 17); p = 0. 02], while no differences were detected in group B [T 0 : 43. 4 (3. 10); T 1 : 37. 3 (3. 15); T 2 : 39. 7 (2. 97) ].

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Segmental</b> muscle <b>vibration</b> (SMV) {{has been}} used to improve gait and to reduce {{spasticity}} in stroke patients. No data exist about the possibility to improve upper limb motor function by using SMV. METHODS: Forty-four patients with hemiparesis following chronic stroke were randomized to an experimental (n = 24) and a control group (n = 20). Patients in the experimental group received two weeks of general physical therapy and SMV over the biceps brachii and flexor carpi ulnaris muscles of the paretic side, while those in the control group received two weeks of general physical therapy. Kinematic analysis of reaching movement was performed at baseline and two weeks after treatment ended. RESULTS: Normalized jerk, indicating the smoothness of movement, significantly improved in the experimental group, with significant difference emerging between groups at the post-treatment evaluation. Patients in the experimental group also displayed a significant improvement for mean linear velocity, mean angular velocity at shoulder, distance to target at the end of movement and movement duration. No differences emerged between baseline and post-treatment evaluations in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: when added to general physical therapy, SMV is effective in improving, in a short-term period, upper limb motor performances of reaching movement in chronic stroke patients...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Segmental</b> muscle <b>vibration</b> (SMV) {{improves}} motor {{performances in}} neurological conditions, including stroke. OBJECTIVE: To determine if SMV modifies upper limb muscular activity in chronic stroke patients performing a reaching movement. METHODS: We randomized 22 chronic stroke patients to an experimental group (EG; n = 12), receiving 10 sessions of exercise + 120 Hz SMV over the biceps brachii (BB) and the flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) muscles, or to {{a control group}} (CG; n = 10) receiving exercise only. All subjects performed a reaching movement with the affected side before and 4 weeks after therapy ended. We recorded surface EMG activity of the anterior deltoid (AD), posterior deltoid (PD), BB, triceps brachii (TB), FCU and extensor carpi radialis (ECR) muscles. We calculated muscular onset times, modulation ratio, co-contractions and degree of contraction. RESULTS: After SMV, onset times of the PD (p = 0. 03), BB (p = 0. 02) and ECR (p = 0. 04) in the EG were less anticipated than at baseline; the modulation ratio increased in AD (p = 0. 003) and BB (p = 0. 01); co-contractions decreased in the pairs BB/TB (p = 0. 007), PD/BB (p = 0. 004) and AD/BB (p = 0. 01); {{and the degree of}} contraction decreased in BB (p = 0. 01).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the influence of four different segmental vibratory stimulation (VS) loads on dynamic range of motion (ROM) of the hamstrings. This study used a randomised cross-over design. Ten male club level athletes (age 22. 7 ± 3. 6 yr, height 181. 2 ± 6. 51 cm, mass 84. 9 ± 12. 3 kg) volunteered to participate. A two factor repeated measures ANOVA (intervention × time) with post hoc comparisons was used to determine whether any vibration setting produced a significantly greater ROM change (p⩽ 0. 05). A significant increase in dynamic ROM was found for three out of the four vibration loads (1. 6 – 2. 1 %). VS using load parameters of 5 mm amplitude, 44 Hz, 49. 4 ms − 2 resulted in the greatest mean ROM improvement, however, this was not significantly different to the increases observed for the other loading parameters. The VS treatment effects (effect sizes ∼ 1. 2 and greater) in these studies were for the most part larger than the treatment effects found in research using more traditional stretching methods. <b>Segmental</b> <b>vibration</b> in combination with various stretching techniques may offer interesting options in terms of improving ROM in the short and long term...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. There {{has been}} a growing focus within {{literature}} on the neuromuscular effects of whole-body and local vibration. The body of knowledge suggests that such effects may include improvement of muscular flexibility, as well as enhancement of stretching methods. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of <b>segmental</b> <b>vibration</b> on the flexibility of the hamstring muscles when applied to the muscles at their resting length. Methods. Thirty-one recreationally-active male participants (aged 25. 5 ± 4. 9 yrs, weight 80. 5 ± 10. 7 kg, height 180. 5 cm ± 6. 5 cm) gave consent to participate in the study. Prior to initial baseline measurements, participants undertook a five-minute warm-up on a bicycle ergometer at a self-selected yet challenging speed, followed by two familiarisation trials of the active knee extension test (AKE) and passive straight leg raise test (PSLR) on both legs. During a single experimental session each participant underwent flexibility testing at three time points (baseline, Post 1, Post 2) measured with electrogoniometry. The AKE and PSLR tests were performed three times on each leg, at each time-point. The mean baseline AKE measurements were used to determine which leg was least flexible and would receive the vibration intervention (experimental), while the other leg acted as the control. The vibration device consisted of an oscillatory platform powered by a motor that generated a random waveform. Vibration (34 Hz, amplitude 3 mm, acceleration 42. 2 m. s- 2) was applied to the posterior thigh of the experimental leg for five one-minute periods alternating with one-minute rest intervals. Immediately after vibration Post 1 range of motion was recorded for both the AKE and PSLR on both legs. The Post 2 measurements were recorded ten minutes following the cessation of vibration. Results. The smallest detectable difference (SDD) calculated from a pilot reliability study was 3. 7 º and 4. 6 º for the AKE and PSLR tests respectively. Taking into consideration the SDD, the likelihood that the true difference between the experimental and control group for the AKE was less than/equivalent/greater than the measured difference between the groups was 0 / 85 / 15 % for baseline v Post 1 respectively, and 0 / 53 / 47 % for Post 1 v Post 2 respectively. Corresponding data for the PSLR were 0 / 98 / 2 % and 0 / 100 / 0 % respectively. Conclusion. <b>Segmental</b> <b>vibration</b> applied at the specified parameters had no clinically significant effect on hamstrings flexibility measured by the PSLR. There was some indication of a potential clinically negative effect on the control leg measured by AKE, that may have been due to diminishing effects of warm-up or neurologically mediated crossed effects. Further investigation is required to examine whether effects persist beyond the Post 2 time-point...|$|E
40|$|The {{nociceptive}} {{component of}} the flexion reflex (FR) has been observed by several investigators to be a reliable physiological manifestation of pain perception in man. It has thus been used as an index of spinal nociceptive activity to study analgesic mechanisms. Vibration is one analgesic procedure which {{has been reported to}} decrease subjective pain report in certain pain conditions. The objective of this study was thus to quantitatively investigate the behavior of the human FR during segmental peripheral conditioning with high-frequency vibration. A first study was undertaken to determine the relationship between pain sensation and the FR under the paradigm developed in this laboratory. Visual analogue scale (VAS) ratings of subjective sensation were found to bear a high, linear correlation with stimulus intensity (r = 0. 95) and with FR area (r = 0. 91). In the main study, we found <b>segmental</b> <b>vibration</b> to inhibit the FR in 5 of 9 subjects. The modulatory effects displayed a slow onset and decay, lasting beyond the 30 min vibration period. Maximum modulation occurred late into vibration, and in some cases after vibration. The direction and magnitude of modulatory effects were basically the same in both biceps femoris (BF) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles. Our results raised the possibility that prolonged vibration could influence spinal nociceptive reflexes in ways similar to the vibration-induced pain relief described in the clinical literature...|$|E
40|$|Background. Studies have {{described}} the effects of <b>segmental</b> muscle <b>vibration</b> (SMV) on brain plasticity and corticomotor excitability. Information on the treatment-induced effects of SMV in stroke patients is, however, still limited. Objectives. To assess whether the application of SMV to ankle dorsiflexor muscles of chronic stroke patients can improve walking. Methods. Forty-four patients {{were randomly assigned to}} either an experimental group (EG) or a control group (CG) and underwent 12 sessions over 4 weeks of general physical therapy. Patients in the EG also received SMV at 120 Hz over the peroneus longus and tibialis anterior for 30 minutes {{at the end of each}} session. All the participants underwent pretreatment and posttreatment gait analysis assessments. Time-distance, kinematic, and surface electromyography (EMG) data were used as outcome measures. Results. A moderate improvement in mean gait speed, normal-side swing velocity, bilateral stride length, and normal-side toe-off percentage was observed only in the EG. A significant increase in bilateral ankle dorsiflexion angle at heel contact was associated with increased maximum ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion degrees during the swing phase on the paretic side after treatment in EG. Surface EMG during the swing phase revealed a significant increase in the activation of the tibialis anterior muscle on the paretic side in the posttreatment assessment in the EG. Conclusions. SMV added to general physical therapy may improve gait performance in patients with foot drop secondary to chronic stroke. The authors hypothesize that this may be due to the mechanical vibration stimulation, probably as a consequence of effective brain reorganizatio...|$|R
40|$|Vibrations {{caused by}} power tools, machinery, vehicles, and heavy {{equipment}} are a ubiquitous feature of modern work environments. In the U. S., an estimated six million workers are in occupations exposed to whole-body vibration {{and more than}} one million workers are in occupations exposed to hand-transmitted vibration (U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2004). Since Alice Hamilton's seminal report in 1918 on vibration-induced hand disorders in quarry stonecutters, the potential health risks associated with prolonged and repeated vibration exposure have been well recognized and documented. Efforts to understand the exposure risk factors and adverse health effects of occupational vibration exposure have waxed and waned over the years. Despite numerous studies and technological advances in vibration measurement and control, the exposure risks and etiology of the adverse health effects are not well understood. Human exposure to vibration remains a major risk factor associated with vascular, neural, and musculoskeletal disorders. The First American Conference on Human Vibration (ACHV) was held in Morgantown, West Virginia, June 5 - 7, 2006. It was organized by the Health Effects Laboratory Division of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and West Virginia University Department of Continuing Education. This conference provided a unique opportunity for a multidisciplinary group of national and international experts to exchange current information on all aspects of <b>segmental</b> and whole-body <b>vibration</b> exposures. The attendees included industrial hygienists, engineers, physicians, epidemiologists, scientists, psychologists, physiologists, health and safety specialists, consultants, students, and other individuals from Government, industry, and academic institutions from the U. S., Canada, and more than seven other countries. Four keynote lectures and more than 60 papers were presented at this conference. Topics included vibration exposure measurement and quantification, biodynamic responses of wholebody and hand-arm system, subjective perceptions of vibration, physiological and pathological mechanisms, health effects, clinical diagnoses, epidemiological studies, prevention effectiveness, standard development and implementation. Presentations also described recent technological advances that may improve vibration measurement, tool and vehicle seat designs and tests, personal protection devices, and clinical diagnosis and assessment methods. The ACHV was intended to prompt the convening of future, biennial conferences on human vibration in North America. We hope that the publication of these conference proceedings will help encourage new research and technological advances so that the health hazards associated with occupation vibration exposures will be significantly reduced.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the applicability and effects of mechanical vibration on body composition and mechanical properties of the arm in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). For this purpose, ten volunteers with thoracic SCI were recruited. Measurements were performed before and after a period of treatment with mechanical vibration applied during forearm flexion in isometric condition. The subjects were tested performing forearm flexion (both right and left side) with increasing loads, corresponding to 5, 8, 10 and 15 % of their own body weight. Average velocity (AV), average force (AF) and average power (AP) were calculated. The Functional Independence Measure was used to evaluate daily autonomy at baseline. Total body and segmental (arms) body composition, fat mass, fat-free mass, and bone mineral density, were studied by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Functional measurements (AV, AF, AP) and body composition were measured at three time points: after a medical examination and interview (T 0); after an interval of 12 weeks without physical therapy or training (T 1); and finally after a further 12 -week period during which the patients performed <b>segmental</b> <b>vibration</b> exercise (T 2).

40|$|The hand-arm {{vibration}} syndrome, widely known as vibration white finger, is a disorder of nerves and blood vessels {{that occurs in}} workers exposed to <b>segmental</b> <b>vibration.</b> A cross sectional symptom survey was performed on a sample of workers employed by a large shipyard in the north eastern United States. Random samples were drawn from departments composed of full time dedicated pneumatic grinders, workers with part time exposure to vibration, and other workers not exposed to vibratory tools. Of the 375 workers sampled, 79 % responded. The prevalence of white finger symptoms was 71 %, 33 %, and 6 % among the three exposure groups respectively. Similarly, the prevalence of numbness and tingling in the hands and fingers in the three exposure groups was 84 %, 50 %, and 17 %. Workers were classified according to the Stockholm Workshop staging systems for vascular and sensorineural symptom severity. Exposure-response analyses of both vascular and sensorineural stage showed monotonically increasing prevalence of higher disease stages with increasing duration of exposure. Logistic regression analysis, performed to control for potential confounding factors including age and current smoking state, produced highly significant (p less than 0. 001) associations between cumulative duration of exposure and prevalence of symptoms. In these analyses smoking state {{was significantly related to}} vascular and sensorineural symptoms and age was not. Average latency to onset of symptoms was less than five years of full time equivalent work with vibratory tools. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the effect of use of particular work practices on reported symptoms.

40|$|Workers {{exposed to}} {{vibrating}} hand tools {{are at risk}} of developing symptoms such as cold-induced vasospasms, loss of tactile sensitivity, and loss of grip strength in the fingers and hands. These symptoms are known collectively as vibration white finger (VWF) or hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS). Symptoms of VWF or HAVS are in part due to repeated and prolonged peripheral vasoconstriction[1, 2]. The reduction in blood flow that occurs with vasoconstriction can result in oxygen deprivation (hypoxia) in soft tissues, such as nerves and muscle, and lead to functional and structural changes in these tissues. The present study examined muscle tissue to determine if vibration-induced changes in transcript levels and protein concentrations result in enhanced vasoconstriction and hypoxia. Manual dexterity was also assessed intermittently to determine if vibration-induced changes in cellular factors are accompanied by performance deficits. Methods An animal model was developed to study the biological and functional changes that occur in response to repeated <b>segmental</b> <b>vibration</b> exposures. In this model, the right paw of intact rats was exposed to a platform vibrated at a frequency 250 Hz and amplitude of 49 m/s 2 to simulate the vibration characteristics of hand-held grinders. Three groups of 8 rats each were studied: a vibration-exposed group, an exposure-control group, and a cage-control group. Exposure sessions, with or without vibration, were conducted 4 hr/day, 5 days/week for 5 weeks. Manual dexterity was assessed intermittently during the 5 -week exposure period with the Montoya stair-case test[3], which quantifies the rat 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s ability to reach for, grasp, and retrieve small food pellets placed below the rat on different levels or steps. Following the 5 -week exposure period, the flexor muscles of the right forelimb were collected for analysis of gene expression, protein concentrations, and immunohistochemistry. Results Vibration-exposure resulted in an approximate 2 -fold increase in the expression of ? 2 C and ? 1 D receptor transcripts in flexor muscles (Figure 1). These receptors mediate norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction in smaller arteries. Vibration-exposure also resulted in an approximate 2 -fold increase in hypoxia-induced factor- 1 ? (HIF- 1 ?), a transcription factor that is expressed in response to tissue hypoxia. Western analyses demonstrated that restraint caused a decrease in ? 1 -receptor protein concentrations in the flexor, but vibration-exposure prevented the restraint-induced reduction (Figure 2). Immunohistochemistry performed on flexor muscles (not shown) demonstrated that ? 1 receptors are primarily located in arteries; maintained levels of these receptors could contribute to prolonged vasoconstriction following repeated vibration exposure. The staircase test showed some performance improvement, or a training effect, in manual dexterity for the control groups but not the vibration-exposed group (Figure 3) ...|$|E
40|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} to whole body vibration (WBV) {{has been associated}} with prevalence of spinal disorders among operators of vibrating mobile machinery. The study of biodynamic responses of body segments is thus pertinent for our understanding of potential injury mechanisms and designs of interventions. This study concerns seated body biodynamic responses to vertical vibration through measurements at the driving-point and at body segments, and development of an analytical model for prediction of global and localised responses. Experiments were undertaken to simultaneously measure driving-point apparent mass (APMS) and body segment acceleration transmissibility of 12 adult subjects under random vertical vibration in the 0. 5 - 20 Hz frequency range. Measurements were taken at the C 7, T 5, T 12, L 3 and L 5 vertebral locations along the fore-aft and vertical axes using skin-mounted micro-accelerometers, and at the scalp using a light-weight head strap with a micro-accelerometer. The study involved four sitting postures realised with different combinations of hands position (on the lap or on the steering wheel) and back support (none or a vertical support), and three excitation magnitudes (0. 25, 0. 5 and 1 m/s 2 RMS). Mathematical correction methods were employed to account for skin effects, sensor misalignments, and seat inertia effects. The corrected body-segment responses of the twelve subjects depicted a clear dependence on the back support condition (p< 0. 01), while the influences of hand position and vibration magnitude were also significant but relatively weaker. Owing to the significant influences of the postural parameters, it was concluded that different support-specific datasets would be necessary to describe the WBV responses and identification of biodynamic models. A 19 degrees-of-freedom anthropometric multi-body biodynamic (MBD) model of the 50 th percentile male subjects was formulated {{on the basis of the}} known anthropometric inertial and joint properties to simulate sagittal plane motions of the body under vertical WBV. The visco-elastic parameters of various joints were identified through minimisation of a set of error functions derived from different combinations of target responses using the Genetic Algorithm. The minimisation of an error function based on measured vertical head, and fore-aft head and C 7 vibration provided an acceptable convergence in primary resonance peaks in both the APMS and the <b>segmental</b> <b>vibration</b> responses. Eigen analysis of the resulting model revealed the presence of 4 significant modes at frequencies below 15 Hz, including two modes near the primary resonant frequency of 5 Hz (4. 76 Hz and 5. 71 Hz), corresponding to vertical movement of the whole body and pelvic rotation. The model was subsequently applied to estimate vibratory power absorbed within different joints and the total body. The total absorbed power of the model agreed reasonably well with the measured total power. The study revealed that a large portion of the power was absorbed at the body-seat interface, primarily by the buttock tissue. However, significant energy dissipation also occurred at the abdominal viscera and the lower lumbar joint (L 5). The L 5 was the only joint that showed relatively higher energy dissipation in translation as well as pitch rotation, which may be associated with the most widely reported location of pain and spinal injury...|$|E
