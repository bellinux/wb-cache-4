5|$|Non-Americans {{collected}} 11 {{victories in}} 20 {{years in the}} 1980s and 1990s, by far the strongest run they have had {{in any of the}} three majors played in the United States <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the U.S. Open. The first European to win the Masters was Seve Ballesteros in 1980. Nicklaus became the oldest player to win the Masters in 1986 when he won for the sixth time at age 46.|$|E
5|$|Though {{electric}} guitars {{had been}} used by industrial artists <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the genre, archetypal industrial groups such as Throbbing Gristle displayed a strong anti-rock stance. British post-punk band Killing Joke pioneered the crossing over between styles, and was an influence on major industrial metal bands such as Ministry, Godflesh, and Nine Inch Nails. Another pioneer industrial rock group, Big Black, also impacted some later groups.|$|E
5|$|By the 1880s, punishments also {{included}} a restricted diet of bread and water (for a short time span), time in irons, and a lengthening of a prisoner's sentence by a visiting magistrate. The cat o' nine tails, which had been used <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the prison, was abolished during the post-1911 Royal Commission reforms. Other reforms in this period saw the number of punishments inflicted decrease from 184 in 1913 to 57 in 1914, and 35 in 1915.|$|E

5|$|Football kit {{has evolved}} {{significantly}} <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the sport when players typically wore thick cotton shirts, knickerbockers and heavy rigid leather boots. In the twentieth century, boots became lighter and softer, shorts were worn at a shorter length, and advances in clothing manufacture and printing allowed shirts {{to be made}} in lighter synthetic fibres with increasingly colourful and complex designs. With the rise of advertising in the 20th century, sponsors' logos began to appear on shirts, and replica strips were made available for fans to purchase, generating significant amounts of revenue for clubs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the British {{colony in}} Australia placing 'at risk' {{children}} into orphanages and children's homes was normal policy.

25|$|The American {{corporate}} media lobby {{has been}} involved in the shaping of media ownership regulations <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the industry.

25|$|The {{rules for}} modern mixed martial arts {{competitions}} have changed significantly <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> vale tudo, Japanese shoot wrestling, and UFC 1, {{and even more}} from the historic style of pankration. As the knowledge of fighting techniques spread among fighters and spectators, {{it became clear that}} the original minimalist rule systems needed to be amended.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between Johnston and Davis, difficult <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the war, became bitter as recriminations were traded publicly {{about who was}} to blame for Vicksburg. Davis considered firing Johnston, but he remained a popular officer and had many political allies in Richmond, most notably Sen. Louis Wigfall. Instead, Bragg's army was removed from Johnston's command, leaving him in control of only Alabama and Mississippi.|$|E
25|$|Magistrates {{have been}} a part of the New South Wales {{industrial}} system <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the British colony established in 1788. The first officially appointed Chief Industrial Magistrate was appointed in 1912. Chief Industrial Magistrates have continued to be appointed since that year, and currently, the industrial work of the court is carried out principally by that magistrate, although other magistrates are appointed as Industrial Magistrates on a needs basis.|$|E

25|$|<b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the church, talks {{given by}} leaders (especially those {{given in the}} church's {{biannual}} general conference meetings) have been recorded and widely distributed in written format. A digitized collection of these talks dating back to 1971 {{is available on the}} lds.org website, and talks dating back to the 1800s are available in printed format through various university and community libraries. In recent years, the LDS Church and BYU have also made audio and video versions of selected talks freely available on their websites.|$|E
25|$|One {{example of}} this {{practice}} is Microsoft, whose product developers publish their personal blogs {{in order to pique}} the public's interest in their work. Collections of personal web pages published by large service providers remain popular and have become increasingly sophisticated. Whereas operations such as Angelfire and GeoCities have existed <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the Web, newer offerings from, for example, Facebook and Twitter currently have large followings. These operations often brand themselves as social network services rather than simply as web page hosts.|$|E
25|$|One of Polk's last acts as President was to {{sign the}} bill {{creating}} the Department of the Interior (March 3, 1849). This was the first new cabinet position created <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the Republic. Polk had misgivings about the federal government usurping power over public lands from the states; however, the delivery of the legislation on his last full day in office gave him no time to find constitutional grounds for a veto, or to draft a sufficient veto message, so Polk signed the bill.|$|E

25|$|Volapuk and Translit {{have been}} in use <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the Internet to write e-mail {{messages}} and other texts in Russian where the support of Cyrillic fonts was limited: either the sender {{did not have a}} keyboard with Cyrillic letters or the receiver did not necessarily have Cyrillic screen fonts. In the early days, the situation was aggravated by a number of mutually incompatible computer encodings for the Cyrillic script, so that the sender and receiver were not guaranteed to have the same one. Also, the 7-bit character encoding of the early days was an additional hindrance.|$|E
25|$|Although its {{botanical name}} Prunus persica refers to Persia (present Iran) {{from where it}} came to Europe, genetic studies suggest peaches {{originated}} in China, {{where they have been}} cultivated <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> Chinese culture. Until recently, it was believed that the cultivation started circa 2000 BC. Nevertheless, the recent evidence indicates that domestication occurred as early as 6000 BC in Zhejiang Province of China. The oldest archaeological peach stones are from the Kuahuqiao site. Archaeologists point at the Yangzi River valley as the place where the early selection for favorable peach varieties likely took place.|$|E
25|$|Since his {{childhood}} Haridas Baba had accepted disciplined life as essential in spiritual progress. He became a monk and adopted silence {{as a way}} of seeking inner peace. For health reasons, and to eliminate digestive problems he had with his liver, he chose to drink a glass of milk once or twice a day instead of taking solid food. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> his association with Neem Karoli he encountered several obstacles in his observance of silence, or eating habits. During one Kumbha Mela, he was obligated by Neem Karoli to break those monastic rules for the reason of following the house rules as having higher but whimsical priority ("What is this rule? For what purpose is it made?").|$|E

25|$|<b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> rail {{transport}} in the United States, Philadelphia {{has served as}} hub for several major rail companies, particularly the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Reading Railroad. The Pennsylvania Railroad first operated Broad Street Station, then 30th Street Station and Suburban Station, and the Reading Railroad operated out of Reading Terminal, {{now part of the}} Pennsylvania Convention Center. The two companies also operated competing commuter rail systems in the area, known collectively as the Regional Rail system. The two systems today, for the most part still intact but now connected, operate as a single system {{under the control of the}} SEPTA, the regional transit authority. Additionally, the PATCO Speedline subway system and NJ Transit's Atlantic City Line operate successor services to southern New Jersey.|$|E
25|$|<b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> communication, {{diplomats and}} {{military}} commanders {{understood that it}} was necessary to provide some mechanism to protect the confidentiality of correspondence and to have some means of detecting tampering. Julius Caesar is credited with the invention of the Caesar cipher c. 50 B.C., which was created in order to prevent his secret messages from being read should a message fall into the wrong hands, {{but for the most part}} protection was achieved through the application of procedural handling controls. Sensitive information was marked up to indicate that it should be protected and transported by trusted persons, guarded and stored in a secure environment or strong box. As postal services expanded, governments created official organizations to intercept, decipher, read and reseal letters (e.g. the UK Secret Office and Deciphering Branch in 1653).|$|E
25|$|The Bishop of Rome, {{called the}} Pope, was {{important}} <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> Christianity {{because of the}} martyrdom of both the apostles Peter and Paul there. The Bishops of Rome were also seen (and still are seen by Catholics) as the successors of Peter; he being the first Bishop of Rome. The city thus became of increasing importance as {{the centre of the}} Catholic Church. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD, Rome was first under the control of Odoacer and then became part of the Ostrogothic Kingdom before returning to East Roman control after the Gothic War, which devastated the city. Its population declined from more than a million in 210 AD to 500,000 in 273 to 35,000 after the Gothic War, reducing the sprawling city to groups of inhabited buildings interspersed among large areas of ruins, vegetation, vineyards and market gardens.|$|E
