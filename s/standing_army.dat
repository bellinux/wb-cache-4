5|$|Desha {{gradually}} became more conservative {{after his return}} to the House, consistently resisting expansion of the U.S. Navy. He also opposed Secretary of War James Monroe's request to maintain a standing peacetime army of 20,000 men. Desha argued that a large <b>standing</b> <b>army</b> provided the advocates of a larger federal government with an excuse to increase taxes, and proposed that the <b>standing</b> <b>army</b> should consist of only 6,000 men. A coalition of Federalists and conservative Democratic-Republicans in the House united to adopt Desha's suggestion by a vote of 7565. The version of the bill passed by the Senate, however, required a <b>standing</b> <b>army</b> of 15,000 men. The legislation was referred to a conference committee, which ultimately adopted a compromise of 10,000 men.|$|E
5|$|Due to his wartime experiences, Frederick William was {{convinced}} that Brandenburg-Prussia would only prevail with a <b>standing</b> <b>army.</b> Traditionally, raising and financing army reserves was a privilege of the estates, yet Frederick William envisioned a <b>standing</b> <b>army</b> financed independently of the estates. He succeeded in getting the consent and necessary financial contributions of the estates in a landtag decree of 26 July 1653. In turn, he confirmed several privileges of the knights, including tax exemption, assertion of jurisdiction and police powers on their estates (Patrimonialgerichtsbarkeit) and the upholding of serfdom (Leibeigenschaft, Bauernlegen).|$|E

50|$|Publius {{outlines}} {{the fallacy of}} restricting the government's power to control the military. He reasons that restricting the size of <b>standing</b> <b>armies</b> is necessary for a people's government to function, but preventing <b>standing</b> <b>armies</b> altogether is outright foolish. He argues that the new system would require the Congress to consider the necessity of <b>standing</b> <b>armies</b> every two years. He states {{that the majority of}} laws meant to prevent <b>standing</b> <b>armies</b> are vague and ineffective.|$|R
5000|$|In his {{influential}} work The Wealth of Nations (1776), economist Adam Smith {{comments that}} <b>standing</b> <b>armies</b> {{are a sign}} of modernizing society as modern warfare requires the increased skill and discipline of regularly trained <b>standing</b> <b>armies.</b>|$|R
50|$|During the Late Middle Ages, plate armour was {{expensive}} and tailor-made for the wearer, and consequently mostly reserved for nobility. Early Modern warfare {{was characterized by}} the establishment of <b>standing</b> <b>armies</b> equipped with mass-produced ordnance weapons.Munitions-grade armour was produced in both Europe and Japan beginning in the 15th century to equip the <b>standing</b> <b>armies</b> developed from this period.|$|R
5|$|He {{argued against}} funding to build Washington, D.C.'s infrastructure, stating {{that it was}} unfair to expect state {{citizens}} {{to pay for the}} city's streets, even if it was the seat of government. He opposed spending money for troops to put down the revolt by the Mormons in Utah Territory, arguing for temporary volunteers as the United States should not have a <b>standing</b> <b>army.</b>|$|E
5|$|At the Restoration, {{infantry}} regiments {{and a few}} {{troops of}} horse were established and there were attempts to found a national militia on the English model. The <b>standing</b> <b>army</b> was mainly employed in the suppression of Covenanter rebellions and the guerrilla war undertaken by the Cameronians in the East. Pikemen became less important and after {{the introduction of the}} socket bayonet disappeared altogether, while matchlock muskets were replaced by the more reliable flintlock. On the eve of the Glorious Revolution the <b>standing</b> <b>army</b> in Scotland was about 3,250 men. The Scots were drawn into King William II's continental wars. Scottish seamen received protection against arbitrary impressment, but a fixed quota of conscripts for the Royal Navy was levied from the sea-coast burghs. There were now Royal Navy patrols in Scottish waters even in peacetime. Scottish privateers played a major part in the Second Anglo-Dutch War. In the 1690s a fleet of five ships was established for the Darien Scheme, and a professional navy of three warships to protect local shipping. After the Act of Union in 1707, these vessels were transferred to the Royal Navy. At the Union, the <b>standing</b> <b>army</b> was seven units of infantry, two of horse and one troop of Horse Guards, besides varying levels of fortress artillery. As part of the British Army, Scottish regiments took part in a series of wars on the European continent. The first official Highland regiment to be raised for the British army was the Black Watch in 1740, but the growth of Highland regiments was delayed by the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion. The bulk of Jacobite armies were made up of Highlanders, serving in clan regiments. The Jacobites often started campaigns poorly armed, but arms became more conventional as the rebellions progressed.|$|E
5|$|The Rashtrakuta army {{consisted}} of large contingents of infantry, horsemen, and elephants. A <b>standing</b> <b>army</b> was always ready for {{war in a}} cantonment (Sthirabhuta Kataka) in the regal capital of Manyakheta. Large armies were also maintained by the feudatory kings who were expected {{to contribute to the}} defense of the empire in case of war. Chieftains and all the officials also served as commanders whose postings were transferable if the need arose.|$|E

5|$|The {{military}} was organized along similar {{lines to the}} British and American {{armed forces of the}} time, in which a small <b>standing</b> <b>army</b> could quickly augment its strength during emergencies from a reserve militia force (in Brazil, the National Guard). Brazil's first line of defense relied upon a large and powerful navy to protect against foreign attack. As a matter of policy, the {{military was}} to be completely obedient to civilian governmental control and to remain at arm's length from involvement in political decisions.|$|E
5|$|Achaemenid ruler Cyrus the Great conquered Sogdiana while {{campaigning in}} Central Asia in 546–539 BC, a fact {{mentioned}} {{by the ancient}} Greek historian Herodotus in his Histories. Darius I introduced the Aramaic writing system and coin currency to Central Asia, in addition to incorporating Sogdians into his <b>standing</b> <b>army</b> as regular soldiers and cavalrymen. A contingent of Sogdian soldiers fought in the main army of Xerxes I during his ultimately failed invasion of Greece in 480 BC. A Persian inscription from Susa claims that the palace there was adorned with lapis lazuli and carnelian originating from Sogdiana.|$|E
5|$|At the Restoration the Privy Council {{established}} {{a force of}} {{an unknown number of}} infantry regiments and a few troops of horse. The Commonwealth fortresses were abandoned, but garrisons were placed in Edinburgh, Stirling, Dumbarton and Blackness castles. There were attempts to found a national militia on the English model. The <b>standing</b> <b>army</b> was mainly employed in the suppression of Covenanter rebellions and the guerilla war undertaken by the Cameronians in the East. Units included a regiment of foot guards, later known as the Scots Guards and Le Regiment of Douglas, formed and serving in France since 1633, it returned, eventually became the Royal Regiment of Foot. Pikemen became less important in the late seventeenth century and after the introduction of the socket bayonet, a process complete by 1702, disappeared altogether, while matchlock muskets were replaced by the more reliable flintlock. Three troops of Scots Dragoons were raised in 1678 and another three were added to make The Royal Regiment of Scots Dragoons in 1681. On the eve of the Glorious Revolution the <b>standing</b> <b>army</b> in Scotland was about 3,000 men in various regiments and another 268 veterans in the major garrison towns, at an annual cost of about £80,000. After the Glorious Revolution the Scots were drawn into King William II's continental wars, beginning with the Nine Years' War in Flanders (1689–97).|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} {{twenty-three years}} male peasants were drafted {{to serve in the}} military, where they were {{assigned}} to infantry, cavalry, or navy service. After one year of training, they went on to perform a year of actual military service in frontier garrisons or as guards in the capital city. They remained liable to perform this year of service until the age of fifty-six. This was also the age when they were dismissed from their local militias, which they could join once they had finished their year of conscripted service. These non-professional conscripted soldiers comprised the Southern Army (Nanjun 南軍), while the Northern Army (Beijun 北軍) was a <b>standing</b> <b>army</b> composed of paid career soldiers.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Han dynasty, every male commoner aged twenty-three was liable for conscription into the military. The minimum age for the military draft was reduced to twenty after Emperor Zhao's (r.87–74 BC) reign. Conscripted soldiers underwent one year of training and one year of service as non-professional soldiers. The year of training was served in one of three branches of the armed forces: infantry, cavalry or navy. The year of active service was served either on the frontier, in a king's court or under the Minister of the Guards in the capital. A small professional (paid) <b>standing</b> <b>army</b> was stationed near the capital.|$|E
5|$|During the Eastern Han, {{conscription}} {{could be}} avoided if one paid a commutable tax. The Eastern Han court favored the recruitment of a volunteer army. The volunteer army comprised the Southern Army (Nanjun 南軍), while the <b>standing</b> <b>army</b> stationed in and near the capital was the Northern Army (Beijun 北軍). Led by Colonels (Xiaowei 校尉), the Northern Army consisted of five regiments, each composed of several thousand soldiers. When central authority collapsed after 189 AD, wealthy landowners, members of the aristocracy/nobility, and regional military-governors relied upon their retainers to act as their own personal troops (buqu 部曲).|$|E

5|$|For his lighter missile troops, Philip II {{employed}} mercenary Cretan archers {{as well as}} Thracian, Paeonian, and Illyrian javelin throwers, slingers, and archers. He hired engineers such as Polyidus of Thessaly and Diades of Pella, {{who were}} capable of building {{state of the art}} siege engines and artillery that fired large bolts. Following the acquisition of the lucrative mines at Krinides (renamed Philippi), the royal treasury could afford to field a permanent, professional <b>standing</b> <b>army.</b> The increase in state revenues under PhilipII allowed the Macedonians to build a small navy for the first time, which included triremes.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton assumed {{control in}} the War department, and the rift between Adams' and Hamilton's {{supporters}} widened. Many sought to vest Hamilton with command authority over the army, and they also resisted giving prominent Democratic-Republicans positions in the army, which Adams wanted {{to do in order}} to gain bipartisan support. By building a large <b>standing</b> <b>army,</b> Hamilton's supporters raised popular alarms and played into the hands of the Democratic-Republicans. They also alienated Adams and his large personal following. They shortsightedly viewed the Federalist party as their own tool and ignored the need to pull together the entire nation in the face of war with France. Overall, however, patriotic sentiments and a series of naval victories, popularized the war as well as the president.|$|E
5|$|Historian R. E. Smith {{notes that}} there was a need to raise {{additional}} legions in an emergency to repel specific strategic threats. He argues that this may have resulted in two types of legion. Long-standing legions deployed overseas were probably professional troops forming a <b>standing</b> <b>army.</b> Quickly-formed new legions, in contrast, consisted of younger men, perhaps with little or no military experience, who hoped for adventure and plunder. However, no distinction in basic pay, discipline or armour is known of between the two types of legion. The practice of veteran troops signing up again voluntarily into newly raised legions must have meant that no one army conformed exactly to one or other of these theoretical archetypes.|$|E

5|$|In June 1627, George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham led an {{expedition}} to the island of Île de Ré to support the Huguenots besieged in La Rochelle by King Louis XIII of France. With no <b>standing</b> <b>army,</b> Buckingham's forces were largely volunteers and mercenaries. Since public opinion in England (particularly among extreme Protestants) supported the Huguenots, a number of well connected gentry came forward. The volunteers to join Buckingham included Temple, his elder brother John {{and other members of}} his family. The expedition to the Isle of Ré, was a disaster and altogether, Buckingham lost more than 5,000 men in the campaign out of a force of 7,000. Among those who died was Temple's brother.|$|E
5|$|James II took {{advantage}} of the suppression of the rebellion to consolidate his power. He asked Parliament to repeal the Test Act and the Habeas Corpus Act, used his dispensing power to appoint Roman Catholics to senior posts, and raised the strength of the <b>standing</b> <b>army.</b> Parliament opposed many of these moves, and on 20 November 1685 James dismissed it. In 1688, when the birth of James Francis Edward Stuart heralded a Catholic succession, James II was overthrown in a coup d'état by William of Orange in the Glorious Revolution at the invitation of the disaffected Protestant Establishment.|$|E
