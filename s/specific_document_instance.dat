30|$|A {{great deal}} {{has been written}} about how {{communication}} technologies were used in the global 2014 response to West African Ebola, including academic articles (Odugleh-Kolev 2014; Tulenko 2014; Sacks et al. 2015; Sandvik et al. 2017; Harman and Wenham 2018), assessments of multinational and non-governmental response (ACAPS 2015; Adams et al. 2015; DuBois et al. 2015; Smith 2015), and case studies <b>documenting</b> <b>specific</b> <b>instances</b> of technology use or country communication processes (NetHope Global Broadband and Innovations Alliance 2014; ACAPS 2015; Levine et al. 2015). The most comprehensive overview is provided by Fast and Waugaman’s (2016) 140 -page report for USAID, “Fighting Ebola with Information,” which provides a starting point for this article’s conceptual framework. After briefly describing the types of activities covered in Fast and Waugaman’s report, an argument is made for re-categorizing and assessing those activities according to the objectives they pursue, which provides an initial basis for the framework developed in this article.|$|R

40|$|Document {{classification}} {{has proven}} to be useful for problems where the target function range is defined for a fixed set of classes, but many problems require organization of documents where possible classes are not previously established. This paper describes an unsupervised text classification system that uses a variant of the k Nearest Neighbor (kNN) method for classification of <b>document</b> <b>instances</b> and a Zipf filter to limit the feature space dimension. The classifier is iterative, relying on training data only for feature selection and delaying class assignment until the query phase. <b>Document</b> <b>instances</b> presented during the query phase are either added to an existing, derived class or assigned to a newly created class. Using a conditional entropy measure to evaluate how well the method partitions <b>document</b> <b>instances,</b> it is shown that the performance of such a classifier can be improved by reducing the dimensionality of the feature space using Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI). 1...|$|R

40|$|Secondary Information Structuring is the {{key part}} of an architecture, which {{is used for the}} knowledge-based, {{vertical}} interrelation of information resources: Primary Information Structuring (<b>document</b> grammars, marked-up <b>instance</b> <b>documents)</b> and abstract, conceptual resources (conceptual models, ontologies). Secondary Information Structuring encompasses a small set of predicates to select and interrelate declarations in document grammars and information items in- possibly multiple- <b>instance</b> <b>documents.</b> The selections are integrated in a conceptual hierarchy, which then can be used to conceptually validate and query <b>document</b> grammars and <b>instance</b> <b>documents,</b> to transform <b>instance</b> <b>documents,</b> and to relate the selected information from Primary Information Structuring to other conceptual resources. An integrated implementation of the approach, using information from document grammars and multiple <b>instance</b> <b>documents,</b> is currently under development. Two applications from the field of linguistics and multilingual documentation of document grammars have been developed so far...|$|R
