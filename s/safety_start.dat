40|$|These {{considerations}} of civilizational and ethical aspects of environmental <b>safety</b> <b>start</b> by {{a reference to}} the conceptual determination of this safety, and its foundation on a conception of the Planet Earth as a political and geological space, originating in the development of life forms. In this sense, the author understands the structures of the Earth's ecosystem, its unity, and the disruption of this unity with consequences for its survival and the survival of the human civilization itself. In the context of this approach, the author points to the need to preserve the environmental safety from the standpoint of equality and justice, stressing that justice is a legal category, especially when it is associated with the laws of nature, laws which are also associated with man as a natural being...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{twenty of}} the {{countries}} composing the European Union (EU 20), there are approximately 800, 000 buses, equivalent to 0. 35 % of the total road vehicle fleet (230 million vehicles), while 10 % of road trips are made by bus. Given these rates, bus crashes account for very few events, involving less than 1 % of total road fatalities (ERF, 2010). It is evident that despite the significance of crashes involving buses and the assumption that public transport improves road safety by reducing vehicular traffic, few studies {{are available in the}} literature on crash data involving buses. The paper presents an overall analysis and comparison of crash data related to bus at European level. A more in depth study carried out at Italian National level provides a useful summary of practice in the area of bus safety management. The work focuses on the expertise of fleet managers {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} different approaches and systems to reach higher safety standards. A survey form was defined referring to relevant factors affecting safety related to the driver (training, skills, performance evaluation and behavior), the vehicle (maintenance and advanced devices) and the road (traffic conflicts and urban road environment). Results provide useful information on the state of the art and current practices of urban public road transport in the area of road <b>safety.</b> <b>Start</b> inhibition, automatic door opening, and bus materials and internal architecture were unanimously considered the top safety items for bus passenger safety. Brake assistance and vehicle monitoring systems were also generally considered very effective...|$|E
