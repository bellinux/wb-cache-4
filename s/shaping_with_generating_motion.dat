40|$|This Thesis {{addresses}} appearance-based {{techniques for}} modelling complex deformable objects {{in order to}} support a detection and tracking process. As example application it considers pedestrian tracking from a moving vehicle. The a-priory knowledge about the object class is captured by a novel probabilistic spatio-temporal shape representation, which consists of a set of distinct linear subspace models and handles continuous as well as discontinuous shape changes. An un-supervised learning algorithm is presented, which fully automatically derives the proposed representation from training sequences of closed contours. In contrast to previous work, no prior feature correspondences are required. The 2 D representation is applied to improve the performance of matching systems that correlate using shape templates. The basic idea involves extending an existing set of training <b>shapes</b> <b>with</b> <b>generated</b> “virtual ” <b>shapes,</b> in order to improve the representational capability. In the experiments ROC curves demonstrate that generating “virtual ” shapes by sampling the linear subspace models of the proposed representation increases th...|$|R

40|$|Character {{animations}} <b>generated</b> <b>with</b> <b>motion</b> capture data contain many of {{the stylistic}} details seen in human <b>motion</b> while those <b>generated</b> <b>with</b> simulation are physically realistic for the dynamic parameters of the character. We combine these two approaches by tracking and modifying human motion capture data using dynamic simulation and constraints. The tracking system <b>generates</b> <b>motion</b> that is appropriate for the graphical character while maintaining characteristics of the original human motion. The system imposes contact and task constraints to add dynamic impacts for interactions with the environment and to modify motions at the behavior level. The system is able to edit motion data to account for changes in characters and the environment as well as create smooth transitions between motion capture sequences. We demonstrate the power of combining these two approaches by tracking data {{for a variety of}} upper-body motions and by animating models with differing kinematic and dynamic parameters...|$|R

The depth of the earthquake was between 4 and 4. 6 km. The resulting signal at the distance considered was almost entirely body-wave components and had little or no contribution from the surface wave. The motion from the relatively shallower weapons tests had a signal with a pronounced surface-wave component. Comparison of the Pseudo Relative Response Velocity (PSRV) plots shows the earthquake signal richer in high frequencies and the weapons-test signals richer in low frequencies. If relationship between ground motion from the two sources can be confirmed for other earthquakes, weapons test ground motion could be used to estimate earthquake ground motion for magnitudes for which probability of occurrence in a given montoring period would be very small...|$|R

40|$|The task {{of setting}} up correspondences between 3 D shapes is a {{prerequisite}} for numerous computer graphics applications, which has been performed manually up to now. We present an automatic method for characterizing 3 D shape subparts and establishing correspondences between them. The corner stones of our algorithm are: (i) finding stable salient points that are representative for certain parts of <b>shapes</b> along <b>with</b> <b>generating</b> the associated local shape descriptors; and (ii) finding matching subsets of salient points so that the local shape dissimilarity and the deformation magnitude due to the resulting mapping is minimal. The salient points are found as minima of the scale space Laplacian-of-Gaussian applied to the characteristic object function, the rotation invariant local shape descriptors are a variant of Spherical Harmonic Descriptors. The matching is performed by finding sets of corresponding salient point pairs minimizing the 3 D bending energy computed from the thin-plate spline interpolation of these discrete point mappings. Unlike the graph based methods, the resulting correspondences are completely independent of object topology but nevertheless stable. Possible applications include (sub-) shape similarity estimation, finding object subparts in a larger scene, generation of dense matching e. g. for morphing or statistical shape analysis. 1...|$|R

40|$|Controlled rocking {{of steel}} braced frames has been {{proposed}} for the seismic retrofit of structures. The controlled rocking approach allows a frame to uplift from its support at the base-of-column to foundation interface while displacement-based steel yielding devices are implemented at the base location to control the response. Past {{studies have focused on}} analytical investigations of the response of such a system along with design applications for controlled rocking bridge piers. This paper discusses shake table testing of a 4 -legged, steel braced pier representative of a 1 / 5 length scale highway bridge pier. The model is subjected to a series of seismic excitations about one of its primary orthogonal axes, using horizontal and vertical base motions, and rotated 45 deg. to investigate pier behavior that would be expected from bi-directional horizontal base inputs.

For example, many methods to <b>generate</b> new <b>motion</b> by synthesizing plural {{existing}} motions has been suggested.

The effectivenessof a video communication system was demonstrated in an experiment of comparisonwith the scene in which a reduced own video image is superimposed on the other talker’svideo image using the picture-in-picture method. However, this system had some problems,such as the detailed adjustment of video images {{and the lack of}} portability of sensors.

40|$|Abstract — Predictability is an {{important}} factor for determining robot motions. This paper presents a model to <b>generate</b> robot <b>motions</b> based on reliable predictability evaluated through a dynamics learning model which self-organizes object features. The model is composed of a dynamics learning module, namely Recurrent Neural Network with Parametric Bias (RNNPB), and a hierarchical neural network as a feature extraction module. The model inputs raw object images and robot motions. Through bi-directional training of the two models, object features which describe the object motion are self-organized in the output of the hierarchical neural network, which is linked to the input of RNNPB. After training, the model searches for the robot motion with high reliable predictability of object motion. Experiments were performed with the robot’s pushing motion with a variety of objects to generate sliding, falling over, bouncing, and rolling motions.

To verify the hypothesis, we introduce a compact representation for an articulated character with deformable soft tissue and develop a practical system to simulate two-way coupling between rigid and deformable bodies in a robust and efficient manner. We then apply a few simple and widely used control algorithms, such as pose-space tracking control, Cartesianspace tracking control, and a biped controller (SIMBICON), to simulate a variety of behaviors for both full-body locomotion and hand manipulation.
