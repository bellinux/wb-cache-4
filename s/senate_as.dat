5|$|After the {{purchase}} was approved, Jefferson drafted {{a system of}} governing the newly acquired territory. Fearing that the Federalists would oppose any system he had devised, he delivered his draft to Breckinridge {{and asked him to}} introduce it in the <b>Senate</b> <b>as</b> his own. To maintain the ruse, Breckinridge moved that a committee be formed to recommend a plan for governing Louisiana Territory. Working through the committee, he brought Jefferson's plan to the Senate floor with its essentials intact. Because the plan provided for the taxation of Louisiana residents without giving them representation in Congress, Federalists and some Democratic-Republicans opposed it. Nevertheless, it passed by a vote of 26–6.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{around the}} year 350 BC, the {{senators}} and the plebeian tribunes began to grow closer. The Senate began giving tribunes more power, and the tribunes began to feel indebted to the <b>Senate.</b> <b>As</b> the tribunes and the senators grew closer, plebeian senators began to routinely secure the office of tribune for {{members of their own}} families. Also, this period saw the enacting of the plebiscitum Ovinium, which transferred the power to appoint new senators from the consuls to the censors. This law also required the censors to appoint any newly elected magistrate to the Senate, which probably resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} number of plebeian senators.|$|E

He ultimately {{dropped out of the}} race on January 3, 2008, after capturing less than 1% of the vote in the Iowa caucus.|$|E

5|$|Established by Standing Order 18 of the Senate, the {{privileges}} committee {{is responsible for}} reporting on matters of parliamentary privilege referred to it by the Senate. The protections afforded by parliamentary privilege are essential to parliament and its committees {{to be able to}} operate effectively. The bulk of the work of {{the privileges}} committee's work is associated with facilitating a 'right of reply' for people adversely named in the <b>Senate,</b> <b>as</b> well as involving investigations of unauthorised disclosures of Senate committee proceedings, complaints from witnesses in connection with evidence given to committees, and allegedly misleading evidence given to committees.|$|E

Louis had two stepsisters, Maria and Cora, from his mother's previous marriage. Howe was sickly and fragile as a child, suffered from asthma, and was generally kept home by his parents; he would never grow to more than five feet tall. Fearing to expose Howe to public school, his parents instead enrolled him in an all-girls seminary.|$|E
5|$|In Massachusetts, the {{lieutenant}} governor does not preside over the state <b>Senate,</b> <b>as</b> {{is the case in}} many other states; nevertheless, as lieutenant governor, Coolidge was a deputy governor functioning as administrative inspector and {{was a member of the}} governor's council. He was also chairman of the finance committee and the pardons committee. As a full-time elected official, Coolidge discontinued his law practice in 1916, though his family continued to live in Northampton. McCall and Coolidge were both reelected in 1916 and again in 1917.
