In the triple-layer <b>strip</b> <b>arrays</b> with large overlaps between the strips, we observed flux avalanches and one-dimensional penetrations perpendicular to the strip similar {{to the case of}} double-layer <b>strip</b> <b>arrays.</b> In thicker triple-layer samples, we also observed flux avalanches parallel to the strip. Enhanced demagnetization effect, thermal conductivity between the neighboring layers, and the driving force parallel to the strip are believed to cause these avalanches...|$|R
40|$|Parallel imaging {{performance}} of overlapped, nonoverlapped loop <b>arrays,</b> and planar <b>strip</b> <b>arrays</b> are investigated at 220 MHz quantitatively based on simulations with finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. Their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and geometry factors (g-factors) in different axial and coronal slices are compared. The average SNR of planar <b>strip</b> <b>arrays</b> {{is up to}} 6 % better than loop coil arrays {{in the vicinity of}} coil array plane. The g-factors of planar <b>strip</b> <b>arrays</b> are significantly better when the acceleration factor approaches the number of array elements. Specifically, the four-channel planar <b>strip</b> <b>array</b> modeled in this work gains 46 % improvement at acceleration factor four compared with its loop array counterpart. Based on the simulation at 220 MHz, it is demonstrated that planar <b>strip</b> <b>arrays</b> have better parallel imaging performance than loop arrays {{in the vicinity of the}} coil array and for high acceleration factors. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|Flux {{penetrations}} into three-dimensional Nb superconducting <b>strip</b> <b>arrays,</b> {{where two}} layers of <b>strip</b> <b>arrays</b> are stacked by shifting a half period, are studied using a magneto-optical imaging method. Flux avalanches are observed when the overlap between {{the top and bottom}} layers is large even if the width of each strip is well below the threshold value. In addition, anomalous linear avalanches perpendicular to the strip are observed in the shifted <b>strip</b> <b>array</b> when the overlap is very large and the thickness of the superconductor is greater than the penetration depth.

40|$|The energy {{efficiency}} of ultrasound transducers for sonochemistry applications was studied {{from the point}} of view of vibration deflection effects of different transducer structures, including the configurations of rectangular plate, cylindrical shell, triangular <b>strip</b> <b>array,</b> rectangular <b>strip</b> <b>array,</b> and pentagonal <b>strip</b> <b>array.</b> It was found that the deflections are not uniform over the transducer surface with the maximum deflection locating at the geometry center of transducers. The simulated maximum deflection of rectangular plate results in the value of 2. 5 × 10 - 16, which is larger than the maximum deflection of cylindrical shell with the value of 2 × 10 - 16. This finding suggests that the envelope deflection volume of two transducers has significant difference, which has been neglected in the design and selection of ultrasound transducer. For this reason, a quantitative index involving the envelope deflection volume was proposed to compare the efficiency of ultrasound transducers. Based on the simulation results, the triangular <b>strip</b> <b>array</b> transducer structure with higher ultrasound generation efficiency was proposed, which was also theoretically validated by the MATLAB simulation...|$|R

30|$|CMOS-based digital photon {{counting}} <b>cameras</b> with SPAD <b>arrays</b> offers single-photon sensitivity {{with zero}} read-out noise. This {{paves the way}} for increasing speed in combination with detection of weak signals at short exposure times. Nowadays, SPAD <b>array</b> <b>cameras</b> have a limited PDE due to a low FF and avalanche probabilities. Optimization of technology to reduce read-out noise in case of sCMOS cameras requires a complex design of analog chains of read-out electronics, but SPAD arrays with their digital approach are less complex and readily offer zero read-out noise. The absence of Gaussian read-out noise, in a SPAD <b>array</b> <b>camera</b> enables localization algorithms to achieve higher localization precisions which are purely limited by the poissonian noise components. However, SPAD <b>array</b> <b>cameras</b> have a limited PDE owing to low FF and avalanche probabilities. Improvement of the PDE of SPADs largely depends on improved manufacturing technology. Efforts towards technology scaling, 3 D heterogeneous integration of electronic devices holds great promise for FF improvement, resulting in higher PDEs for SPAD <b>array</b> <b>cameras.</b> With single-photon sensitivity, zero read-out noise, digital embedded processing capabilities and improved PDEs, SPAD <b>arrays</b> are the <b>cameras</b> of choice for live-cell nanoscopic imaging.|$|R

Despite having similar PDEs of 70 %, a clear distinction was observed between the performances of SPAD array, sCMOS and CCD cameras.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new type of {{graphene}} based tunable radar absorbing screen. The absorbing screen consists of Hilbert curve metal <b>strip</b> <b>array</b> and chemical vapour deposition (CVD) graphene sheet. The graphene based screen is not only tunable when the chemical potential of the graphene changes, but also has broadband effective absorption. The absorption bandwidth is from 8. 9 GHz to 18. 1 GHz, ie., relative bandwidth of more than 68 %, at chemical potential of 0 eV, which is significantly wider than that if the graphene sheet had not been employed. As the chemical potential varies from 0 to 0. 4 eV, the central frequency of the screen can be tuned from 13. 5 GHz to 19. 0 GHz. In the proposed structure, Hilbert curve metal <b>strip</b> <b>array</b> was designed to provide multiple narrow band resonances, whereas the graphene sheet directly underneath the metal <b>strip</b> <b>array</b> provides tunability and averagely required surface resistance so to significantly extend the screen operation bandwidth by providing broadband impedance matching and absorption. In addition, the thickness of the screen has been optimized to achieve nearly the minimum thickness limitation for a nonmagnetic absorber. The working principle of this absorbing screen is studied in details, and performance under various incident angles is presented.

40|$|At present, the on-orbit {{calibration}} of {{the geometric}} parameters {{of a space}} surveying camera is usually processed by data from a ground calibration field after capturing the images. The entire process is very complicated and lengthy and cannot monitor and calibrate the geometric parameters in real time. On {{the basis of a}} large number of on-orbit calibrations, we found that owing to the influence of many factors, e. g., weather, it is often difficult to capture images of the ground calibration field. Thus, regular calibration using field data cannot be ensured. This article proposes a real time self-calibration method for a space linear <b>array</b> <b>camera</b> on a satellite using the optical auto collimation principle. A collimating light source and small matrix array CCD devices are installed inside the load system of the satellite; these use the same light path as the linear <b>array</b> <b>camera.</b> We can extract the location changes of the cross marks in the matrix array CCD to determine the real-time variations in the focal length and angle parameters of the linear <b>array</b> <b>camera.</b> The on-orbit status of the camera is rapidly obtained using this method.
