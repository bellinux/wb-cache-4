In {{the first}} experiment, the platina pole was three inches {{and a half}} long, and seven eighths of an inch wide; it was wholly {{immersed}} in the water or ice, and as the vessel was four eighths of an inch in width, the average thickness of the intervening ice was {{only a quarter of}} an inch, whilst the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> with it at both poles was nearly fourteen square inches. After the water was frozen, the vessel was still retained in the frigorific mixture, whilst contact between the tin and platina respectively was made with the extremities of a well-charged voltaic battery, consisting of twenty pairs of four-inch plates, each with double coppers. Not the slightest deflection of the galvanometer needle occurred.|$|E

This peace is a farce, reconstruction an exploded phrase. The slide goes on,--it goes, if anything, faster, without a sign of stopping. And all our poor little adaptations!

I was anxious, in {{the first}} place, to obtain {{some idea of the}} {{conducting}} power of ice and solid salts for electricity of high tension (392.), that a comparison might be made between it and the large accession of the same power gained upon liquefaction. For this purpose the large electrical machine (290.) was brought into excellent action, its conductor connected with a delicate gold-leaf electrometer, and also with the platina inclosed in the ice (383.), whilst the tin case was connected with the discharging train (292.). On working the machine moderately, the gold leaves barely separated; on working it rapidly, they could be opened nearly two inches. In this instance the tin case was five-eighths of an inch in width; and as, after the experiment, the platina plate was found very nearly {{in the middle of the}} ice, the average thickness of the latter had been five-sixteenths of an inch, and the extent of <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> with tin and platina fourteen square inches (384.). Yet, under these circumstances, it was but just able to conduct the small quantity of electricity which this machine could evolve (371.), even when of a tension competent to open the leaves two inches; no wonder, therefore, that it could not conduct any sensible portion of the electricity of the troughs (384.), which, though almost infinitely surpassing that of the machine in quantity, had a tension so low as not to be sensible to an electrometer.|$|E

Plates of platina, copper, zinc, and other metals, about three quarters of an inch wide and three inches long, were associated together in pairs by means of platina wires to which they were soldered, fig. 88, the plates of one pair being either alike or different, as might be required. These were arranged in glasses, fig. 89, so as to form Volta's crown of cups. The acid or fluid in the cups never covered the whole of any plate; and occasionally small glass rods were put into the cups, between the plates, to prevent their contact. Single plates were used to terminate the series and complete the connexion with a galvanometer, or with a decomposing apparatus (899. 968. &c.), or both. Now if fig. 90 be examined and compared with fig. 91, the latter may be admitted as representing the former in its simplest condition; for the cups i, ii, and iii of the former, with their contents, are represented by the cells i, ii, and iii of the latter, and the metal plates Z and P of the former by the similar plates represented Z and P in the latter. The only difference, in fact, between the apparatus, fig. 90, and the trough represented fig. 91, is that twice the quantity of <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> between the metal and acid is allowed in the first to what would occur in the second.|$|E
6000|$|... 717. When the {{positive}} and negative electrodes are equal in surface, the bubbles which rise from them in dilute sulphuric acid are always different in character. Those from {{the positive}} plate are exceedingly small, and separate instantly from every part of the surface of the metal, in consequence of its perfect cleanliness (633.); whilst in the liquid they give it a hazy appearance, from their number and minuteness; are easily carried down by currents, and therefore not only present far greater <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> with the liquid than larger bubbles would do, but are retained a much longer time in mixture with it. But the bubbles at the negative surface, though they constitute twice the volume of the gas at the positive electrode, are nevertheless very inferior in number. They do not rise so universally from every part of the surface, but seem to be evolved at different parts; and though so much larger, they appear to cling to the metal, separating with difficulty from it, and when separated, instantly rising {{to the top of the}} liquid. If, therefore, oxygen and hydrogen had equal solubility in, or powers of combining with, water under similar circumstances, still under the present conditions the oxygen would be far the most liable to solution; but when to these is added its well-known power of forming a compound with water, it is no longer surprising that such a compound should be produced in small quantities at the positive electrode; and indeed the blenching power which some philosophers have observed in a solution at this electrode, when chlorine and similar bodies have been carefully excluded, is probably due to the formation there, in this manner, of oxywater.|$|E
6000|$|Assume a {{spheroid}} of such size as {{will form}} {{one of the}} inferior planets, and consisting externally of a voluminous, cloudy atmosphere composed of the less condensible elements, and internally of metallic gases: such internal gases being kept by convection-currents at temperatures not very widely differing. And assume that continuous radiation has brought the internal mass of metallic gases down to the critical point of the most condensible. May we not {{say that there is}} a size of the spheroid such that the pressure will not be great enough to produce liquefaction at any other place than the centre? or, in other words, that in the process of decreasing temperature and increasing pressure, the centre will be the place at which the combined conditions of pressure and temperature will be first reached? If so, liquefaction, commencing at the centre, will spread thence to the periphery; and, in virtue of the law that solids have higher melting points under pressure than when free, it may be that solidification will similarly, at a later stage, begin at the centre and progress outwards: eventually producing, in that case, a state such as Sir William Thomson alleges exists in the Earth. But now suppose that instead of such a spheroid, we assume one of, say, twenty or thirty times the mass; what will then happen? Notwithstanding convection-currents, the temperature at the centre must always be higher than elsewhere; and in the process of cooling the [...] "critical point" [...] of temperature will sooner be reached in the outer parts. Though the requisite pressure will not exist near the surface, there is evidently, in a large spheroid, a depth below the surface at which the pressure will be great enough, if the temperature is sufficiently low. Hence it is inferable that somewhere between centre and surface in the supposed larger spheroid, there will arise that state described by Prof. Andrews, in which [...] "flickering striæ" [...] of liquid float in gaseous matter of equal density. And it may be inferred that gradually, as the process goes on, these striæ will become more abundant while the gaseous interspaces diminish; until, eventually, the liquid becomes continuous. Thus there will result a molten shell containing a gaseous nucleus equally dense with itself at their <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> and more dense at the centre--a molten shell which will slowly thicken by additions to both exterior and interior.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Contact problem, which exists {{widely in}} {{mechanical}} engineering, civil engineering, manufacturing engineering, etc., {{is an extremely}} complicated nonlinear problem. It is usually solved by the finite element method. Unlike with the traditional finite element method, {{it is necessary to}} set up contact elements for the contact analysis. In the different types <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> elements, the Goodman joint elements, which cover the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacted</b> bodies with zero thickness, are widely used. However, there are some debates on the characteristics of the attached elements of the Goodman joint elements. For that this paper studies the type, matching, and meshing of the attached elements.

6000|$|The first {{cardinal}} fact is {{that all}} protophytes are cellular--all show us this contrast between outside and inside. Supposing the multitudinous specialities of the envelope in different orders and genera of protophytes to be set against one another, and mutually cancelled, there remains as a trait common to them--an envelope unlike that which it envelopes. The second cardinal {{fact is that}} this simple trait is the earliest trait displayed in germs, or spores, or other parts from which new individuals are to arise; and that, consequently, this trait must be regarded as having been primordial. For it is an established truth of organic evolution that embryos show us, in general ways, the forms of remote ancestors; and that the first changes undergone, indicate, more or less clearly, the first changes {{which took place in}} the series of forms through which the existing form has been reached. Describing, in successive groups of plants, the early transformations of these primitive units, Sachs[44] says of the lowest Algæ that [...] "the conjugated protoplasmic body clothes itself with a cell-wall" [...] (p. 10); that in [...] "the spores of Mosses and Vascular Cryptogams" [...] and in [...] "the pollen of Phanerogams" ... "the protoplasmic body of the mother-cell breaks up into four lumps, which quickly round themselves off and contract, and become enveloped by a cell-membrane only after complete separation" [...] (p. 13); that in the Equisetaceæ [...] "the young spores, when first separated, are still naked, but they soon become surrounded by a cell-membrane" [...] (p. 14); and that in higher plants, as in the pollen of many Dicotyledons, [...] "the contracting daughter-cells secrete cellulose even during their separation" [...] (p. 14). Here, then, in whatever way we interpret it, the fact is that there quickly arises an outer layer different from the contained matter. But the most significant evidence is furnished by [...] "the masses of protoplasm that escape into water from the injured sacs of Vaucheria, which often instantly become rounded into globular bodies," [...] and of which the [...] "hyaline protoplasm envelopes the whole as a skin" [...] (p. 41) which [...] "is denser than the inner and more watery substance" [...] (p. 42). As in this case the protoplasm is but a fragment, and as it is removed from the influence of the parent-cell, this differentiating process can scarcely be regarded as anything more than the effect of physico-chemical actions: a conclusion which is supported by the statement of Sachs that [...] "not only every vacuole in a solid protoplasmic body, but also every thread of protoplasm which penetrates the sap-cavity, and finally the inner side of the protoplasm-sac which encloses the sap-cavity, is also bounded by a skin" [...] (p. 42). If then [...] "every portion of a protoplasmic body immediately surrounds itself, when it becomes isolated, with such a skin," [...] which is shown in all cases to arise at the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> with sap or water, this primary differentiation of outer from inner must be ascribed to the direct action of the medium. Whether the coating thus initiated is secreted by the protoplasm, or whether, as seems more likely, it results from transformation of it, matters not to the argument. Either way the action of the medium causes its formation; and either way the many varied and complex differentiations which developed cell-walls display, must be considered as originating from those variations of this physically-generated covering which natural selection has taken advantage of.|$|E
