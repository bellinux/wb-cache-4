5|$|The Pine Bush is {{also home}} to 30 of the 44 species of {{amphibians}} and reptiles that are indigenous to Albany County. Seven of these species are generally not <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> far north in the state of New York. Three species of salamander, the Jefferson salamander (Ambystoma jeffersonium), blue-spotted salamander (Ambystoma laterale), and spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum), are state-listed special concern animals. Two species of turtle, the spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata) and wood turtle (Clemmys insculpta), are also special concern animals. About 45 species of birds breed in the Albany Pine Bush (according to the 1985 New York State Breeding Bird Atlas) and are fairly common species for the area. About 32 species of common small mammals have been found in and adjacent to the Pine Bush.|$|E

25|$|The Boolean algebras we have <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> {{far have}} all been concrete, {{consisting}} of bit vectors or equivalently of subsets of some set. Such a Boolean algebra consists of a set and operations on that set which can be shown to satisfy the laws of Boolean algebra.|$|E
25|$|During {{the night}} after the Battle of Fredericksburg, an aurora was seen from the battlefield. The Confederate Army took this {{as a sign that}} God was on their side, as the lights were rarely <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> far south. The {{painting}} Aurora Borealis by Frederic Edwin Church is widely interpreted to represent the conflict of the American Civil War.|$|E

25|$|We {{should all}} {{be aware of the}} fact that when r{{evolutionary}} — not evolutionary — changes come, things can get even worse. The intelligentsia should be aware of this. And it is the intelligentsia specifically that should keep this in mind and prevent society from radical steps and revolutions of all kinds. We’ve had enough of it. We’ve <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> many revolutions and wars. We need decades of calm and harmonious development.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, the {{assumption}} that the aether is not carried in the vicinity, but only within matter, was very problematic as shown by the Hammar experiment (1935). Hammar directed one leg of his interferometer through a heavy metal pipe plugged with lead. If aether were dragged by mass, it was theorized that the mass of the sealed metal pipe would have been enough to cause a visible effect. Once again, no effect was <b>seen,</b> <b>so</b> aether-drag theories are considered to be disproven.|$|E

While Lucinda was not shown to be fired with regret, it was shown on Why I Fired Them that she was.|$|E
25|$|In McOndo narratives, {{cities and}} city life are realistically portrayed as places and {{circumstances}} rendered virtual ("non-places") by the technologies of the Internet, cellular telephones, and cable television; virtual space has supplanted physical {{space in the}} city. To wit, the writer Ana María Amar Sánchez said that cities have become interchangeable, homogeneously indistinguishable from each other, especially when seen from a distance, whilst riding in a speeding automobile travelling a highway {{en route to a}} shopping center; <b>seen</b> <b>so,</b> the city appears virtual, an image in the screen of a computer or a television set.|$|E
25|$|In the {{examples}} <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> far the same metre {{is used for}} several lines at a time; but a glance at Moore’s database shows that iambic and trochaic lines are often mixed together, as in the passage below from Terence’s Phormio (485-492), which Moore discusses in an article. In these lines the young man Phaedria pleads with the slave-owner Dorio for more time {{to raise the money}} to buy his girlfriend; Phaedria’s cousin Antipho and the slave Geta secretly listen in on the conversation.|$|E

25|$|As {{they ate}} and ate, their {{luminous}} body {{began to be}} coated by the mud substance, formed a coarser body, then suddenly, the sun and moon were <b>seen,</b> <b>so</b> were the stars, and also Night and Day began on Earth. The logical explanation of this was that the creatures were the self-illuminating, so blinding and luminous that they didn't notice the Sun. The Earth was covered in their light. So, when the materialization took place, the light faded inside their newly conceived 'body' of mud and thus the night and day became apparent to them. Then, as the night and day became apparent, seasons and years also appeared.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} physical features in Clinton Township is Penny Hill. This hill which is in the eastern portion of the township was named for a dog named Penny. Penny was apparently fond of wandering up and down the hill during the late 1780s and early 1790s. She was owned by a man named David Tolbert. Tolbert's dog was <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> often on the hill that the residents of the area began to call it Penny Hill. Today Penny Hill is bisected by U.S. Route 15. It overlooks West Branch Susquehanna River and is covered by a number of family residences and several small farms.|$|E
25|$|In {{the latter}} half of the 19th century, San Francisco saw {{administrative}} graft, boss politics, and a persistent lawlessness. For a while after the hangings of Whittaker and McKenzie, San Francisco functioned as a law-abiding city. The hangings frightened corrupt judges and government officials, who then began to do their duties with a rare diligence, not <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> far in San Francisco. This new competency in government would not last long, and by 1852 corrupt government officials developed a system of high salaries and expensive projects with political kickbacks that would drain the city's treasury to near bankruptcy. This financial crisis at city hall would create a great strain on commerce and also affect individual businesses.|$|E

25|$|Information on Kliper's beyond LEO mission {{capabilities}} were expanded {{further by}} RSC Energia, {{with a picture}} released in December 2005 of what a possible Kliper interplanetary configuration might have looked like. The design was entirely theoretical but made for a view of where RSC Energia saw the Kliper operating, and how it might have done so. This configuration was unlike anything <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> far for a manned space vehicle, with the solar arrays needed for electrical power vastly bigger than the habitable volume at the centre. It was also unclear what the mode of propulsion was. The very large solar array suggested an ion propulsion system might have been contemplated for such a mission, though it might also simply be {{that there was another}} reason for such a large array, such as increased power for better telemetry transmission rates over large distances.|$|E
25|$|Fanta's older {{homosexual}} brother, {{and is a}} half-faerie like her. He shows extremely discriminative {{attitude towards}} all females except his sister, presumably because he had traumatic childhood relationship with his cold and distant mother. This also is implied to be the reason his romantic interests lie within males. He and his sister are close, {{even if they do}} argue sometimes like most siblings. Pain is the one who enchanted Ryang's skateboard (after hitting on him) so he could fight the evil affinities along with Fanta. Pain's best friend is Charon, the Prime Minister of Avalon and Medea's brother. Although the full extent of Pain's power is unknown, {{the fact that he has}} attained the position of Royal Inspector, a job which requires both power and precision, as well as being the only character <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> far that is able to hold off evil affinities. Like Fanta, he is much more powerful than the other inhabitants realize; as a child, he was able to detect Seraphina's spells when Charon and others could not. Pain also possesses powers to trace magical energy back to the original performer of magic.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 22 September, Jones in Bonhomme Richard (an armed East India trading vessel he had reluctantly adapted for {{military}} use), accompanied by the little brigantine Vengeance, had been off Spurn Head, hoping to catch a few prizes emerging from the Humber estuary, but he decided to head northward during the hours of darkness, and rendezvous with his frigates Alliance and Pallas, which had parted company from him further up the coast. Shortly after midnight, two vessels were <b>seen,</b> <b>so</b> signal lanterns were set. The strangers did not give the response that would identify them as members of his squadron. Jones’s crew was called to quarters, but when daylight approached, about 5:30am, and a chequered flag was hoisted on the mizzen mast, the mystery vessels finally identified themselves as the Alliance and Pallas. Captain Cottineau of the Pallas (in full, Denis Nicolas Cottineau de Kerloguen) later reported that Captain Pierre Landais of the Alliance had advised a rapid retreat if the approaching warship proved to be British—not a reassuring suggestion, given that his frigate, which had been acclaimed as the best warship yet made in America, was by a fair margin the faster and more manoeuvrable of the two.|$|E
