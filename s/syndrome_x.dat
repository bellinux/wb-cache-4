25|$|Atherosclerosis is {{the most}} common cause of {{stenosis}} (narrowing of the blood vessels) of the heart's arteries and, hence, angina pectoris. Some people with chest pain have normal or minimal narrowing of heart arteries; in these patients, vasospasm is a more likely cause for the pain, sometimes in the context of Prinzmetal's angina and <b>syndrome</b> <b>X.</b>|$|E

25|$|Metabolic {{syndrome}} – {{a poorly}} understood condition first called <b>Syndrome</b> <b>X</b> by Gerald Reaven. It is currently {{not clear whether}} the syndrome has a single, treatable cause, or is the result of body changes leading to type 2 diabetes. It is characterized by elevated blood pressure, dyslipidemia (disturbances in blood cholesterol forms and other blood lipids), and increased waist circumference (at least in populations in much of the developed world). The basic underlying cause may be the insulin resistance that precedes type 2 diabetes, which is a diminished capacity for insulin response in some tissues (e.g., muscle, fat). It is common for morbidities such as essential hypertension, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) to develop.|$|E
2500|$|Cardiac <b>syndrome</b> <b>X,</b> {{sometimes}} {{known as}} microvascular angina {{is characterized by}} angina-like chest pain, {{in the context of}} normal epicardial coronary arteries (the largest vessels {{on the surface of the}} heart, prior to significant branching) on angiography. The original definition of cardiac <b>syndrome</b> <b>X</b> also mandated that ischemic changes on exercise (despite normal coronary arteries) were displayed, as shown on cardiac stress tests. The primary cause of cardiac <b>syndrome</b> <b>X</b> is unknown, but factors apparently involved are endothelial dysfunction and reduced flow (perhaps due to spasm) in the tiny [...] "resistance" [...] blood vessels of the heart. Since microvascular angina is not characterized by major arterial blockages, it is harder to recognize and diagnose. Microvascular angina was previously considered a rather benign condition, but more recent data has changed this attitude. Studies, including the Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation (WISE), suggest that microvascular angina is part of the pathophysiology of ischemic heart disease, perhaps explaining the higher rates of angina in women than in men, as well as their predilection towards ischemia and acute coronary syndromes in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease.|$|E

50|$|Cardiac <b>syndrome</b> <b>X</b> is angina (chest pain) {{with signs}} {{associated}} with decreased {{blood flow to}} heart tissue but with normal coronary arteries. Cardiac <b>syndrome</b> <b>X</b> is {{sometimes referred to as}} 'microvascular angina' when there are findings of microvascular dysfunction.|$|E
50|$|Cardiac <b>syndrome</b> <b>X</b> is a {{diagnosis}} of exclusion. Typically this will necessitate both a clinical diagnosis, appropriate stress testing, and a coronary Angiogram that meet the above criteria. Cardiac MRI {{can be used to}} diagnose cardiac <b>syndrome</b> <b>X.</b> Studies are ongoing to validate this approach.|$|E
50|$|Chest pain {{caused by}} cardiac <b>syndrome</b> <b>X</b> {{is most of}} the time {{unpredictable}} and it can occur when at rest and/or during exercise. The pain associated with <b>syndrome</b> <b>X</b> is normally more intense and it lasts {{for longer periods of time}} compared to pain caused by other conditions. For example, a stable angina causes chest pain that goes away when at rest. Another difference is that while chest pain caused by any type of stable angina is relieved with nitroglycerin, this drug is not effective in most of patients with <b>Syndrome</b> <b>X.</b>|$|E

50|$|Blood {{tissue from}} five other female <b>Syndrome</b> <b>X</b> cases (whose average age was 6.3 years) {{turned out to}} be age {{appropriate}} according to a biomarker of aging known as epigenetic clock. The mean epigenetic age of the five pure <b>Syndrome</b> <b>X</b> subjects was 6.7 years (standard error=1.0) which is not significantly different from the mean chronological age of 6.3 years (standard error=1.8). Notably, the oldest pure <b>Syndrome</b> <b>X</b> case had an epigenetic age of 14.5 years which was 3.2 years older than her true chronological age. It is not yet known whether the epigenetic age of other tissues is also age appropriate in these cases.|$|E
50|$|The is no {{specific}} known cause for <b>syndrome</b> <b>X,</b> {{but rather a}} multitude of risk factors that act together. It is believed {{that the lack of}} blood flow caused by a microvascular disease and enhanced pain perception are two of the factors that may cause it. The microvascular dysfunctions refer to the abnormalities in the very small blood vessels of the heart. The narrowing of these vessels may lead to lack of oxygen in specific areas of the cardiac muscle causing chest pain. Several studies have shown that patients suffering from <b>syndrome</b> <b>X</b> have enhanced pain perception, and usually feel more intense chest pain than individuals without <b>syndrome</b> <b>X.</b>|$|E
50|$|Children with a {{very rare}} {{disorder}} known as <b>syndrome</b> <b>X</b> maintain the façade of persistent toddler-like features while aging from birth to adulthood.

40|$|Ph. D, North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2011 The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore what {{contributes}} to resilience in females diagnosed with Fragile <b>X</b> <b>Syndrome.</b> Fragile <b>X</b> <b>Syndrome</b> can be defined as an inherited (genetic) condition that causes mental impairment, attention deficit and hyperactivity, anxiety and unstable mood, autistic behaviours, hyper-extensible joints, and seizures. I became aware of Fragile <b>X</b> <b>Syndrome</b> during my time as a live-in caretaker to an adolescent female who was diagnosed with Fragile <b>X</b> <b>Syndrome.</b> Because she coped with her disability so resiliently, I was encouraged to explore what contributes to resilience in females diagnosed with Fragile <b>X</b> <b>Syndrome.</b> I followed a qualitative approach, anchored in the interpretivist paradigm. This means that I tried to understand the resilience of females diagnosed with Fragile <b>X</b> <b>Syndrome</b> through the meanings that the participants in my study assigned to them. Furthermore, I worked from a transformative paradigm, which meant that I was interested in changing the traditionally negative ways in which females diagnosed with Fragile <b>X</b> <b>Syndrome</b> are seen. I followed a multiple case study approach, which included four case studies. I conveniently selected the first participant, but realised that convenience sampling was not very credible for a qualitative case study. An Advisory Panel was then used to purposefully recruit three more participants. In order to explore what contributed to their resilience, I made use of interviews, observations, and visual data collection. I also interviewed adults (e. g. parents, teachers and consulting psychologists) who were significantly involved in the lives of my participants. My findings suggest that resilience in females with Fragile <b>X</b> <b>Syndrome</b> is rooted in protective processes within the individual as well as within her family and environment. Because my findings do not point to one specific resource, my study underscores newer understandings of resilience as an Eco systemic transaction. Most of the resilience-promoting resources noted by the participants in my study as contributing to their resilience have been identified as resilience-promoting in previous studies. Although the themes that emerged in my study have been reported in resilience previously, I make a contribution to theory because I link traditional resilience-promoting resources to resilience in females diagnosed with Fragile <b>X</b> <b>Syndrome.</b> Peer support was previously reported as a resilience-promoting resource, but in my study I noticed that the main source of peer support came from peers who were also disabled. Furthermore, my study transforms how we see females diagnosed with Fragile <b>X</b> <b>Syndrome.</b> This transformation encourages communities and families to work together towards resilience in females diagnosed with Fragile <b>X</b> <b>Syndrome.</b> Doctora...|$|R

50|$|Cardiac <b>syndrome</b> <b>X</b> can be {{diagnosed}} using different tests and exams, {{but it is}} mainly a diagnosis of exclusion. However, sedentary and overweight individuals with {{a family history of}} type 2 diabetes should be tested regularly to determine whether they have irregular levels of glucose or lipids, or blood pressure abnormalities, factors which are usually associated with cardiac <b>syndrome</b> <b>X.</b> A first test to be taken is an exercise stress test which shows if the heart is not getting blood during exertion. Angiograms may be useful and conclusive when diagnosing cardiac <b>syndrome</b> <b>X</b> because they offer a detailed image of the heart. However, they cannot detect potential abnormalities in the small arteries, and the doctor may ask for more tests in order to rule out other heart conditions, such as Prinzmetal's angina which has similar symptoms.|$|E
