Therefore, esqecially {{in the case of}} reinforced concrete, if concrete can not protect corrosion, which is a these surface, a serious problem occurs. On the other hand, the deterioration of surface will raise a problem on the design. Seeing these states, we can say that both <b>surface</b> and <b>surface</b> <b>layers</b> of concrete are very important parts concerning durability and design. In this report, taking notice of <b>surface</b> <b>layers</b> of Concrete, we investigate about the states of <b>surface</b> <b>layers.</b> The deterioration phenomenon of both <b>surface</b> and <b>surface</b> <b>layers</b> and repaired reproduction method of them, and describe the results of them. ...|$|R

This conclusion suggested that energy in a hurricane dissipating internally above the <b>surface</b> <b>layer</b> is two times higher than energy dissipating at the surface.|$|E
5|$|Chromium metal left {{standing}} in air is passivated by oxidation, forming a thin, protective, <b>surface</b> <b>layer.</b> This layer is a spinel structure {{only a few}} molecules thick. It is very dense, and prevents the diffusion of oxygen into the underlying metal. This {{is different from the}} oxide that forms on iron and carbon steel, through which elemental oxygen continues to migrate, reaching the underlying material to cause incessant rusting. Passivation can be enhanced by short contact with oxidizing acids like nitric acid. Passivated chromium is stable against acids. Passivation can be removed with a strong reducing agent that destroys the protective oxide layer on the metal. Chromium metal treated in this way readily dissolves in weak acids.|$|E

5|$|Radioactive {{substances}} can harm {{human health}} via (i) local skin contamination, (ii) internal exposure due to ingestion of radioactive isotopes, and (iii) external overexposure by β-activity and γ-radiation. Together with radium and transuranium elements, actinium {{is one of}} the most dangerous radioactive poisons with high specific α-activity. The most important feature of actinium is its ability to accumulate and remain in the <b>surface</b> <b>layer</b> of skeletons. At the initial stage of poisoning, actinium accumulates in the liver. Another danger of actinium is that it undergoes radioactive decay faster than being excreted. Adsorption from the digestive tract is much smaller (~0.05%) for actinium than radium.|$|E

5|$|This {{decompression}} {{model was}} developed by D.E. Yount {{and others at the}} University of Hawaii to model laboratory observations of bubble formation and growth in both inanimate and in vivo systems exposed to pressure variations. It presumes that microscopic bubble nuclei always exist in aqueous media, including living tissues. These bubble nuclei are spherical gas phases that are small enough to remain in suspension yet strong enough to resist collapse, their stability being provided by an elastic <b>surface</b> <b>layer</b> consisting of surface-active molecules with variable gas permeability. These skins resist the effect of surface tension, as surface tension tends to collapse a small bubble by raising internal pressure above ambient so that the partial pressure gradient favours diffusion out of the bubble in inverse proportion to the radius of the surface.|$|E

Two-dimensional streamlines based on wind speeds show areas of convergence and divergence in the wind field, which are helpful in determining the location of features within the wind pattern. A popular type of surface weather map is the surface weather analysis, which plots isobars to depict areas of high pressure and low pressure.|$|E

Ruts length in longitudinal gradient class 8 - 12 % was significantly more than other classes (p< 0. 05). The mean of rut length in this class was 8. 19 m.
