40|$|ABSTRACT. Given {{a mixing}} <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> finite type X, we {{consider}} which subshifts of finite type Y ⊂ X {{can be realized}} as the fixed point <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> an inert involution of X. We establish a condition on the periodic points of X and Y that is necessary for Y to be the fixed point <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> an inert involution of X. We show that this condition is sufficient to realize Y as the fixed point <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> an involution, up to shift equivalence on X, if X is a <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> finite type with Artin-Mazur zeta function equivalent to 1 mod 2. Given an inert involution f <b>of</b> a mixing <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> finite type X, we characterize what f-invariant subshifts can be realized as the fixed point <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> an inert involution. 1. Introduction and Statement of Results. We refer the reader to Section 2 for precise definitions. The group <b>of</b> <b>shift</b> commuting homeomorphisms <b>of</b> a <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> finite type X is called the automorphism group (of X) and is denoted as Aut(σX). The group Aut(σX) has been a vital tool in attempts to classify <b>shifts</b> <b>of</b> finite type, but in general, Aut(σX) is large and mysterious. For example, the automorphism group of the 2 -shift is countably infinite...|$|R
5|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, Charles H. Zimmerman of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) {{developed}} {{a system for}} control of a rotorcraft in which, with the rotors mounted {{on the underside of}} the aircraft, the machine could be steered by the pilot through the simple <b>shifting</b> <b>of</b> his weight, and kept stable through the actions of his natural reflexes. Known as kinesthetic control, and similar in principle to the mechanics of riding a bicycle or a surfboard, it was hoped that the concept would allow for pilots to operate an aircraft with little to no training time. NACA testing proved that the idea had merit, and several companies, including Bensen Aircraft, Hiller Aircraft, and de Lackner Helicopters, began development of rotorcraft using the concept.|$|E
5|$|However, not {{everything}} was always harmonious between {{the king and}} the archbishop. In 1156, Theobald supported the efforts of Osbert de Bayeux, {{who was accused of}} poisoning William the Archbishop of York, to secure a trial for his alleged crimes in an ecclesiastical court rather than in the royal court. The crime had taken place during Stephen's reign, but Stephen's death had prevented Osbert from being tried in 1154. The delay allowed the <b>shifting</b> <b>of</b> the trial to the church courts, which Henry opposed. Although Theobald's position displeased the king no open rupture ensued. Theobald himself admitted to the papacy in 1154 that English custom was to try clergy for crimes in the secular courts.|$|E
5|$|Close {{examination}} of the spectral lines reveals that some display a fine structure splitting. This occurs because of spin–orbit coupling, which is an interaction between the spin and motion of the outermost electron. When an atom is in an external magnetic field, spectral lines become split into three or more components; a phenomenon called the Zeeman effect. This {{is caused by the}} interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of the atom and its electrons. Some atoms can have multiple electron configurations with the same energy level, which thus appear as a single spectral line. The interaction of the magnetic field with the atom shifts these electron configurations to slightly different energy levels, resulting in multiple spectral lines. The presence of an external electric field can cause a comparable splitting and <b>shifting</b> <b>of</b> spectral lines by modifying the electron energy levels, a phenomenon called the Stark effect.|$|E
40|$|The {{definition}} <b>of</b> a phase <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> triplet periodicity (TP) is introduced. The mathematical algorithm for detection <b>of</b> a phase <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> TP in nucleotide se-quences {{has been}} developed. The gene sequences from the Kegg- 46 data bank were have been analyzed {{to search for}} genes with TP phase <b>shifts.</b> The presence <b>of</b> a phase <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> TP for 318329 genes (~ 10 % from {{the total number of}} genes in the Kegg- 46 data bank) has been demonstrated. We show that TP phase shifts are determined by the <b>shifts</b> <b>of</b> a reading frame (RF) in genes.

40|$|The 13 C and 15 N {{chemical}} <b>shifts</b> <b>of</b> five N-arylguanidinium chlorides carrying polar substituents, {{ranging in}} character from 4 -methoxy to 4 -nitro groups, have been determined by NMR spectroscopy at the natural-abundance level of 13 C and 15 N in dimethyl sulfoxide solution. Comparison of the 13 C <b>shifts</b> <b>of</b> these salts {{with those of}} monosubstituted benzenes shows that the guanidinium group induces an average downfield <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> - 5. 8 ppm of the resonance of the aryl carbon {{to which it is}} attached (C 1), an average upfield <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> + 4. 2 ppm for C 2 and C 6, and a small upfield <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> + 1. 9 ppm for C 4. The <b>shifts</b> <b>of</b> C 3 and C 5 are small and erratic relative to the corresponding carbons in monosubstituted benzenes. The 15 N resonances of the guanidinium nitrogens are quite sensitive to electric effects resulting from substitution of polar groups at C 4. The 15 N <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> the [unk]NAr nitrogen relative to that of the salts suggests that the predominant tautomer for N-arylguanidines is (H 2 N) 2 C[unk]NAr. The 15 N <b>shifts</b> <b>of</b> the (NH 2) 2 nitrogens correlate rather well with σp- parameters, whereas the <b>shifts</b> <b>of</b> the -NHAr nitrogens seem to correlate only with R values derived from the σp- substituent constants...|$|R
5|$|From the 17th century onward, the Enlightenment {{questioned}} {{the power and}} influence of the Catholic Church over Western society. In the 18th century, writers such as Voltaire and the Encyclopédistes wrote biting critiques of both religion and the Catholic Church. One target of their criticism was the 1685 revocation of the Edict of Nantes by King Louis XIV of France, which ended a century-long policy of religious toleration of Protestant Huguenots. The French Revolution of 1789 brought about a <b>shifting</b> <b>of</b> powers from the Church to the State, destruction of churches {{and the establishment of}} a Cult of Reason. In 1798, Napoleon Bonaparte's General Louis Alexandre Berthier invaded Italy, imprisoning Pope Pius VI, who died in captivity. Napoleon later re-established the Catholic Church in France through the Concordat of 1801. The end of the Napoleonic Wars brought Catholic revival and the return of the Papal States.|$|E
5|$|Over time, {{emphasis}} {{in studies of}} leisure has shifted from the work-leisure relation, particularly in well-researched majorities, to study of minorities and the relation between leisure and culture. Marshall Gordon noted {{that there are two}} approaches in the study of leisure: formal and historical-theoretical. The formal approach focuses on empirical questions, such as the <b>shifting</b> <b>of</b> leisure patterns over an individual's life cycle, the relation between leisure and work, and specific forms of leisure (such as the sociology of sport). The historical-theoretical approach studies the relation between leisure and social change, often from structural-functionalist and neo-Marxist perspectives. Sheila Scraton provided a different analysis, comparing North American and British studies. The British approaches focus on input from pluralism, critical Marxism, and feminism; the American approaches concentrate on the social-psychological tradition.|$|E
5|$|Production {{began in}} late 2003 at Barrandov Studios in Prague, Czech Republic, {{where most of}} the filming took place. Production {{designer}} Richard Bridgland was in charge of sets, props and vehicles, based on early concept art Anderson had created to give a broad direction of how things would look. 25 to 30 life-sized sets were constructed at Barrandov Studios, many of which were interiors of the pyramid. The pyramid's carvings, sculptures, and hieroglyphs were influenced by Egyptian, Cambodian, and Aztec civilisations, while the regular <b>shifting</b> <b>of</b> the pyramid's rooms was meant to evoke a sense of claustrophobia similar to the original Alien film. According to Anderson, if he was to build the sets in Los Angeles they would have cost $20 million. However, in Prague they cost $2 million, an important factor when the film's budget was less than $50 million.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{what happens}} when we try to work with continuing block codes (i. e. left or right continuing factor maps) between shift spaces that may not be <b>shifts</b> <b>of</b> finite type. For example, we demonstrate that continuing block codes on strictly sofic shifts do not behave as well as those on <b>shifts</b> <b>of</b> finite type; a continuing block code on a sofic shift need not have a uniformly bounded retract, unlike one on a <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> finite type. A right eresolving code on a sofic shift can display any behavior arbitrary block codes can have.

50|$|Another {{measurable}} quantity is the chemical <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> lithium ions Li+ in complexes of lithium with aromatic structures because lithium tends to bond as a π-coordinate complex {{to the face}} of the aromatic rings.

5|$|The Roosevelt dime {{was first}} struck on January 19, 1946, at the Philadelphia Mint. It was {{released}} into circulation on January 30, {{which would have}} been President Roosevelt's 64th birthday. The planned release date had been February 5; it was moved up to coincide with the anniversary. With its debut, Sinnock became the first chief engraver to be credited with the design of a new circulating U.S. coin since those designed by Charles E. Barber were first issued in 1892. The release of the coins was a newsworthy event, and demand for the new design remained strong, although many of Roosevelt's opponents, particularly Republicans, were outraged. There were reports of the new dime being rejected in vending machines, but no changes to the coin were made. The dime's design has not changed much in its over seventy years of production, the most significant alterations being minor changes to Roosevelt's hair and the <b>shifting</b> <b>of</b> the mint mark from reverse to obverse in the 1960s.|$|E

Following the Jingkang Incident, the remnants of the Song court were forced to flee south from Kaifeng and establish a new capital at Hangzhou. The loss of northern territory and <b>shifting</b> <b>of</b> the capital marks the division of the dynasty into two distinct periods: the Northern Song (960-1127) and the Southern Song (1127-1279). The Southern Song developed a new navy to combat the Jurchen's Jin dynasty formed in the north. The Song dynasty was able to defeat further Jurchen invasions and even fought the Jin dynasty in an erstwhile alliance with the Mongols. However, the Mongol rulers Genghis Khan, Ögedei Khan, Möngke Khan, and finally Kublai Khan gradually conquered China, until the fall of the final Song emperor at the Battle of Yamen in 1279.|$|E
5|$|The modern koala is {{the only}} extant member of Phascolarctidae, a family that once {{included}} several genera and species.

Like the modern species, prehistoric koalas had well developed ear structures which suggests that long-distance vocalising and sedentism developed early. During the Miocene, the Australian continent began drying out, leading to the decline of rainforests and the spread of open Eucalyptus woodlands. The genus Phascolarctos split from Litokoala in the late Miocene and had several adaptations that allowed it to live on a specialised eucalyptus diet: a <b>shifting</b> <b>of</b> the palate towards the front of the skull; larger molars and premolars; smaller pterygoid fossa; and a larger gap between the molar and the incisor teeth.|$|E

5|$|Thermal energy causes {{some of the}} {{molecules}} at {{the outer edge of}} the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth's gravity. This causes a slow but steady loss of the atmosphere into space. Because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass, it can achieve escape velocity more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases. The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the <b>shifting</b> <b>of</b> Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere. Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth. In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|From the {{earliest}} times, the Chinese {{were concerned with}} the destructive force of earthquakes. It was recorded in Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian of 91BC that in 780BC an earthquake had been powerful enough to divert the courses of three rivers. It was not known {{at the time that}} earthquakes were caused by the <b>shifting</b> <b>of</b> tectonic plates in the Earth's crust; instead, the people of the ancient Zhou Dynasty explained them as disturbances with cosmic yin and yang, along with the heavens' displeasure with acts committed (or the common peoples' grievances ignored) by the current ruling dynasty. These theories were ultimately derived from the ancient text of the Yijing (Book of Changes), in its fifty-first hexagram. There were other early theories about earthquakes, developed by those such as the ancient Greeks. Anaxagoras (c.500–428BC) believed that they were caused by excess water near the surface crust of the earth bursting into the Earth's hollows; Democritus (c. 460–370BC) believed that the saturation of the Earth with water caused them; Anaximenes (c.585–c.525BC) believed they were the result of massive pieces of the Earth falling into the cavernous hollows due to drying; and Aristotle (384–322BC) believed they were caused by instability of vapor (pneuma) caused by the drying of the moist Earth by the Sun's rays.|$|E

5|$|The next {{species of}} Stegosaurus {{to be named}} was S. marshi, by Frederick Lucas in 1901. Lucas {{reclassified}} this species in the new genus Hoplitosaurus later that year. Lucas also re-examined {{the issue of the}} life appearance of Stegosaurus, coming {{to the conclusion that the}} plates were arranged in pairs in two rows along the back, arranged above the bases of the ribs. Lucas commissioned Charles R. Knight to produce a life restoration of S. ungulatus based on his new interpretation. However, the following year, Lucas wrote that he now believed the plates were probably attached in staggered rows. In 1910, Richard Swann Lull wrote that the alternating pattern seen in S. stenops was probably due to <b>shifting</b> <b>of</b> the skeleton after death. He led the construction of the first ever Stegosaurus skeletal mount at the Peabody Museum of Natural History, which was depicted with paired plates. In 1914, Charles Gilmore argued against Lull's interpretation, noting that several specimens of S. stenops, including the now-completely prepared holotype, preserved the plates in alternating rows near the peak of the back, and that there was no evidence of the plates having shifted relative to the body during fossilization. Gilmore and Lucas' interpretation became the generally accepted standard, and Lull's mount at the Peabody Museum was changed to reflect this in 1924.|$|E
5|$|About a {{month before}} Minh's junta was overthrown, Khánh was {{approached}} {{by one of the}} principal tacticians in the removal of Diệm, General Đỗ Mậu. A colonel {{at the time of the}} previous coup, Mậu had been head of military security under Diệm. Although he did not explicitly command troops, Mậu had a thorough knowledge of the backgrounds of most of the senior ARVN officers and their strengths and weaknesses. This had allowed him to help engineer the previous coup. The MRC respected Mậu, but their fears about his shrewdness led them to place him in the relatively powerless post of Minister of Information. Mậu's closest aides were posted further away from any real power in an attempt to fragment his networks of influence. Mậu began to search for officers to replace the junta, searching for exiles in Cambodia and France as well as those who had returned to Vietnam after the overthrow of Diệm. The most important link in Mậu's plan was Colonel Nguyễn Chánh Thi, the former paratroop commander who had fled to Cambodia in the wake of the failed 1960 coup attempt against Diệm. Mậu persuaded the junta to install Thi as Khánh's deputy in I Corps. He tricked the junta into doing so by reasoning that as Khánh had largely been responsible for putting down the 1960 revolt, Thi would be an ideal mechanism for keeping Khánh in check, claiming that the two would be implacably opposed to one another. Privately, Mậu predicted that Thi would be a bridge between him in Saigon and Khánh in Huế. He was correct in thinking that the 1960 conflict would be irrelevant in the <b>shifting</b> <b>of</b> allegiances over time and that the pair would work together for their current aims of advancement. Mậu recruited a second figure in the form of General Trần Thiện Khiêm, who was one of Khánh's fellow cadets and had worked with Mậu during the November coup. Khiêm had assisted Diệm in putting down the 1960 plot and had since been demoted from being Chief of Staff of the ARVN to the commander of the III Corps that surrounded Saigon. Khiêm readily joined the plot and controlled the 5th and 7th Divisions of the ARVN, which were based in Biên Hòa and Mỹ Tho north and south of Saigon respectively. This brought the two division commanders subordinate to Khiêm into the plot, as long as they would obey his orders. Khiêm, Khánh and Mậu kept in touch surreptitiously on a regular basis, supplementing their forces with an assortment of Marine, Air Force and Special Forces officers. Another was General Dương Văn Đức, who had recently returned from exile in Paris and was an assistant to Kim, the chief of the junta's general staff. During this time, the plotters received encouragement from Harkins through their American advisers, something seen as crucial to the plot's increasing momentum.|$|E
