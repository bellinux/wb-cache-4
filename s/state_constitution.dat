5000|$|Property taxes, {{like all}} {{taxes in the}} United States, are subject to {{constraints}} under the United States and applicable <b>state</b> <b>constitutions.</b> The United <b>States</b> <b>Constitution</b> contains three relevant provisions: limits on federal direct taxation, an equal protection rule, and the privileges and immunities provisions. [...] Nearly all <b>state</b> <b>constitutions</b> impose uniformity and equality rules. Most <b>state</b> <b>constitutions</b> also impose other restrictions, which vary widely.|$|R
50|$|Amendments {{are often}} {{necessary}} {{because of the}} length of <b>state</b> <b>constitutions,</b> which are, on average, three times longer than the federal <b>constitution,</b> and because <b>state</b> <b>constitutions</b> typically contain extensive detail. In addition, <b>state</b> <b>constitutions</b> are often easier to amend than the federal constitution.|$|R

5|$|Baxter had {{now been}} {{governor}} {{for a year}} and was following an independent course. He began dismantling the systems put in place by the Minstrels.

5|$|Connecticut did {{not create}} a <b>state</b> <b>constitution</b> for itself until several decades after it became a state; until 1818, the state {{operated}} under the provisions of its colonial charter.

5000|$|Thorpe's {{scholarship}} on <b>state</b> <b>constitutions</b> remains {{some of the}} most influential and foundational work in the field of state constitutional development.

5|$|During the 1950s, {{agitation}} grew in Alaska for {{the territory}} {{to become a}} state. Alaskans could not vote in presidential elections and had a territorial legislature with limited powers. Efforts to lobby federal legislators for an Alaska statehood bill met with limited success, so prominent territorial officials decided to draft a <b>state</b> <b>constitution</b> to prove Alaska's readiness to become a state. On November 8, 1955, 55 elected delegates gathered at the University of Alaska to begin drafting a <b>state</b> <b>constitution.</b> The resulting debates lasted {{more than two months}} and caused a sensation in Fairbanks. Debates of the constitutional convention were broadcast on Fairbanks radio, and the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner dedicated daily reports to the progress of the convention. On February 5, 1956, the delegates signed the constitution in front of 1,000 people who crowded into the University of Alaska gymnasium. The building where deliberations took place was subsequently named Constitution Hall.|$|E
5|$|In 1776, {{soon after}} Delaware {{and the other}} Thirteen Colonies {{declared}} independence from Britain, the state adopted its first <b>state</b> <b>constitution.</b> It created the office of President of Delaware, a chief executive to be chosen by the legislature to serve a term of three years.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} of a vacancy in the governor's office, the <b>state</b> <b>constitution</b> {{specified}} that the President of the New Jersey State Senate, the upper chamber of the state legislature, would assume the role of acting governor without relinquishing his or her powerful role in the state senate. Further, if the acting governorship filled by the state senate president were vacated or that person could not assume the office, he or she would be succeeded by the Speaker of the New Jersey General Assembly, the state legislature's lower chamber. This order of succession was included in the first <b>state</b> <b>constitution</b> in 1776, reinstated in the subsequent 1844 constitution, and kept in the 1947 Constitution until the 2006 amendment.|$|E

40|$|Robert Williams 2 ̆ 7 s The Law of American <b>State</b> <b>Constitutions</b> is an {{impressive}} career accomplishment {{for one of the}} leading academic lawyers writing on <b>state</b> <b>constitutions.</b> Given the need for a comprehensive, treatise-like treatment of <b>state</b> <b>constitutions</b> that transcends individual jurisdictions, Williams 2 ̆ 7 s book will almost certainly become the go-to treatise {{for the next generation of}} state constitutional law practitioners and scholars. The U. S. Constitution has a grip on how the American legal mind approaches issues in American constitutionalism, but an important recurring theme in Williams 2 ̆ 7 s work (as well as that of others) is how <b>state</b> <b>constitutions</b> present unique interpretive challenges. More than any other legal academic, Williams has advanced the view-in this book and elsewhere-that the unique nature of <b>state</b> <b>constitutions</b> requires an appreciation of the text, legal community, and interpretive norms of the specific jurisdiction engaging in the interpretation. <b>State</b> <b>constitutions</b> are very important legal documents, but their interpretation is remarkably understudied (and, of course, highly undertheorized) in the academic literature. Williams 2 ̆ 7 s descriptive account of <b>state</b> <b>constitutions</b> is very informative and lawyerly; his book fills a notable void to the extent it synthesizes many important features and doctrines of state constitutional law, grounding them in historical context. It is the most significant account of modern <b>state</b> <b>constitutions</b> to date, and his book exhaustively surveys a wide range of the issues state courts have struggled with in interpreting their constitutions...|$|R
50|$|Under the Sixth Amendment to the United <b>States</b> <b>Constitution,</b> {{a person}} {{accused of a}} crime and facing a {{criminal}} prosecution, is guaranteed {{the right to a}} speedy trial. Various <b>state</b> <b>constitutions</b> also guarantee this right.|$|R
5|$|Many {{rules and}} {{procedures}} in the Maryland Senate are set by the <b>state</b> <b>constitution.</b> Beyond the constitutional mandates, rules in the Senate are developed by the Rules Committee. The Senate and House of Delegates both meet for ninety days following the second Wednesday in January, although these sessions may be extended for up to thirty days by majority votes in both houses, and special sessions may be called by the Governor. The Senate meets in the Senate Chamber of the Maryland State House, which has both gallery seating and a door open to the State House lobby, the latter being mandated by the <b>state</b> <b>constitution.</b> Seating in the Senate is by party, {{with the leaders of}} each party choosing the exact seating assignments. Each Senator has offices in Annapolis, in the Miller Senate Office Building.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey's first <b>state</b> <b>constitution</b> {{was adopted}} on July 2, 1776. The American Revolutionary War was {{underway}} and George Washington {{had recently been}} defeated in New York, putting New Jersey in imminent danger of invasion. With Patriot and Tory factions plotting and battling each other, New Jersey was a state at war and was nearly a state at civil war. Composed in a span of five days and ratified only two days later, during this state of emergency, on July 2, 1776, the New Jersey <b>State</b> <b>Constitution</b> reflects the turbulence and uncertainty of the moment. Its primary objective {{was to provide a}} basic governmental framework that would preempt New Jersey's fall into anarchy. And yet this Constitution served as the charter document for the State's government for the next 68 years.|$|E
5|$|Roberts {{was one of}} a few Republicans to back {{a measure}} to reform {{spending}} requirements in Colorado's <b>state</b> <b>constitution.</b> The proposal, which would have diverted excess revenues under TABOR to K-12 education, was regarded as a sweeping revision to competing constitutional mandates; it was not passed by the General Assembly, but was advanced as a citizens' initiative.|$|E
40|$|The US Constitution is {{a global}} outlier. Its {{omission}} of positive rights, its brevity, and its remarkable duration and stability make it exceptional by global standards. The uniqueness of this venerable document has spurred a passionate debate over America 2 ̆ 7 s constitutional exceptionalism. In this Article, we show {{that not all of}} American constitutionalism is nearly so distinctive. Over the past two centuries, Americans not only wrote the federal Constitution, but they have also written 149 <b>state</b> <b>constitutions</b> and approved thousands of amendments to those <b>constitutions.</b> Those <b>state</b> <b>constitutions</b> are also {{an essential part of the}} American constitutional tradition and yet are unexceptional by global standards. We draw on original data based on our own hand coding of all <b>state</b> <b>constitutions</b> ratified between 1776 and 2011 to provide the first systematic comparison of US <b>state</b> <b>constitutions</b> to the world 2 ̆ 7 s national constitutions. Using these data, we highlight three features of <b>state</b> <b>constitutions</b> that should prompt reconsideration of America 2 ̆ 7 s constitutional exceptionalism. First, like most of the world 2 ̆ 7 s <b>constitutions,</b> <b>state</b> <b>constitutions</b> are rather long and elaborate documents that set out government policies in painstaking detail. Second, like most of the world 2 ̆ 7 s <b>constitutions,</b> <b>state</b> <b>constitutions</b> are frequently amended or overhauled. Third, like most of the world 2 ̆ 7 s <b>constitutions,</b> <b>state</b> <b>constitutions</b> contain positive rights relating to, for example, education, labor, social welfare, and the environment. Thus, at the state level, Americans have written their constitutions much like everyone else. Our findings invite reconsideration not only of America 2 ̆ 7 s alleged constitutional exceptionalism but also of the nature of <b>state</b> <b>constitutions.</b> <b>State</b> <b>constitutions</b> are frequently derided for falling short of the example set by the federal Constitution and dismissed as statutory rather than constitutional in character. Our analysis suggests that the defining features of <b>state</b> <b>constitutions</b> do not merely represent a subnational mode of constitution making but characterize national and subnational constitutions alike. Moreover, these features represent an underappreciated mechanism of constitutional design that emphasizes flexibility and specificity over the entrenchment of broad statements of principles...|$|R
50|$|The act was {{numbered}} as Act No. 21 of 1971. It {{was renamed}} several times, becoming the Black <b>States</b> <b>Constitution</b> Act, 1971, then the National <b>States</b> <b>Constitution</b> Act, 1971, {{and finally the}} Self-governing Territories Constitution Act, 1971.|$|R
50|$|The {{reasoning}} {{behind this}} approach probably {{has as much}} to do with American laissez-faire economics as with different social perspectives. The First Amendment of the United <b>States</b> <b>Constitution</b> guarantees the right to free speech. While free speech is an explicit right guaranteed by the United <b>States</b> <b>Constitution,</b> privacy is an implicit right guaranteed by the Constitution as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court, although it is often an explicit right in many <b>state</b> <b>constitutions.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{office of}} {{governor}} {{was established by}} the first New York <b>State</b> <b>Constitution</b> in 1777. The governor was originally for a term of three years, though the constitution did not specify when the term began. A 1787 law set {{the start of the}} term at July 1. The New York State Constitutional Convention of 1821 amended the <b>state</b> <b>constitution,</b> reducing the term of office to two years, moving the election to November, and moving {{the beginning and the end}} of the term to coincide with the calendar year. An 1874 amendment extended the term of office back to three years, but the 1894 constitution again reduced it to two years. The most recent constitution of 1938 extended the term to the current four years. There is no limit to the number of consecutive terms a governor may serve.|$|E
5|$|When Congress {{created the}} Michigan Territory in 1805, it used the Northwest Ordinance's {{language}} {{to define the}} territory's southern boundary, which therefore differed from that in Ohio's <b>state</b> <b>constitution.</b> This difference, and its potential ramifications, apparently went unnoticed at the time, but it established the legal basis for the conflict that would erupt 30 years later.|$|E
5|$|Abu Bakar promuglated the Johor State Establishment Constitution (Malay: Undang-undang Tubuh Negeri Johor), {{drafted by}} Abdul Rahman Andak, on 14 April 1895. The state's {{constitution}} {{was seen as}} a turning point by many as a step in laying the groundwork for the administration of Johor. It was suggested that Abu Bakar, who was fearful of his possible imminet death in light of his failing health, promogulated the <b>state</b> <b>constitution</b> with the intent of preserving the state's independence in the light of growing British political influence in the Malay states.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} lists of {{fundamental}} {{rights in the}} majority of <b>state</b> <b>constitutions,</b> which vary slightly from one another but are never capable of ruling out a Grundrecht. Landesrechte (i.e. rights guaranteed by <b>state</b> <b>constitutions)</b> which mirror Bundesrechte (those guaranteed by the Federal Constitution) are therefore disregarded in favour of the Bundesrechte. Many <b>state</b> <b>constitutions</b> which were written after the Federal Constitution do not contain their own lists of fundamental rights at all.|$|R

5|$|After {{serving as}} {{president}} of the local league for four years, Dudley was elected to head the Tennessee Equal Suffrage Association in 1915.

5|$|After the war, {{he moved}} back to Abingdon. During Reconstruction, Robertson {{was a member of}} the Committee of Nine, led by Alexander H. H. Stuart, that sought Virginia's {{readmission}} to the Union. At issue was the new <b>state</b> <b>constitution,</b> which included disenfranchisement of many white males. The committee successfully negotiated with the Federal government to have that clause voted on separately, so that Virginians would accept and ratify the new constitution and so rejoin the Union. He died on February 11, 1888, and was buried at Cobbs, Chesterfield County.|$|E
50|$|Because {{states are}} free to provide more {{constitutional}} protections under <b>state</b> <b>constitutions</b> than the federal government provides under the United <b>States</b> <b>Constitution,</b> the ruling did not overturn the requirements of many states that counsel be appointed for indigent litigants facing incarceration at civil contempt hearings.|$|R
500|$|While many <b>state</b> <b>constitutions</b> are {{modeled after}} the United <b>States</b> <b>Constitution</b> and federal laws, those <b>state</b> <b>constitutions</b> did not {{necessarily}} include provisions comparable to the Bill of Rights.
