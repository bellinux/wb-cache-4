30|$|Seam bonding {{is used in}} {{automotive}} {{engineering in}} particular {{because of the high}} degree of automation and, {{in the case of the}} table-top seam bonding process, because of the very fast cycle times that are achieved. This hybrid joining process plastically bends the <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>edge</b> of the outer part around the inner part producing a form and force-locking joint [1, 2]. The gap between the two sheet metal parts is filled with adhesive. This bonding firstly prevents the ingress of moisture at the joint level, and secondly the adhesive provides the bond with greater bending and torsional rigidity [3]. The fact that this joining method, in contrast to welding, does not leave any visible evidence of the connection, allows it to be used in areas where the joint is visible. In the automotive industry, this benefit makes the process particularly suitable for use for the closures (e.g. doors, hood top, luggage compartment door) where seam bonding is used to combine the visible outer skin parts with the inner structure and crash resistant parts.|$|E

40|$|AbstractLaser cutting {{has started}} {{to be used as}} an {{effective}} method for cutting out blanks from rolled sheet metals because of its high flexibility for cutting line and high productivity. However, residual stresses, which are generated by laser cutting, have been the greatest obstacle for the popularization of laser cutting. One of the problems is the warp which appears in the sheet metal, after being subjected to bending processes after laser cutting. The authors present a light indentation method for reducing residual stress generated by laser cutting. The method is to give light indentation on the <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>edge</b> and to reduce tensile residual stress generated near the laser cutting surface. In particular, this present paper especially focuses upon optimization of working condition depending on mechanical properties of blank. Furthermore, the mechanism of transition of stress and effective strain in light indentation was examined. Experiments of U-bending after applying light indentation were conducted for usability of this method. The FEM analyses were carried out in order to investigate the effect of working condition in various mechanical properties. As a result, the optimum condition of light indentation method in various materials was found out, and the warp of bent sheet metals was drastically reduced...|$|E

Pushing snow horizontally off the track may create an unbalanced horizontal force where asymmetrical snow accumulation is encountered. (such as snow drifting into {{one side of a}} cut) This unbalanced force may derail the plow. The leading edge of the horizontal wedge is typically forward of the vertical wedge so stabilizing downward snow loading precedes horizontal loads.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} fulfill green {{requirement}} (reduction of CO 2 emissions given by French “Grenelle”), {{a great need}} appears concerning roll-on roll-off efficient technology. Heavy seam welded structures manufacturer has to present an optimized product to fulfill this requirement. In this purpose, the Modalohr system overcomes several challenges: transport 4 m height and 38 tons semi- trailer in UIC kinematic gauging with a low floor rail vehicle, use of conventional large wheel bogie with maximum axle load, 9 million kilometers running over 30 years service life. For cost effectiveness, the compact vehicle design uses welded assembly and avoids systematic full penetration welds which may require costly preparation machining. The idea {{is to develop a}} one shot FEA which provides both global structural bending and torsional vehicle behaviors and also the fatigue focus on each joint for both weld toe and weld root. The local stress analysis requires too much effort and the structural stress using appropriate inclined shell element in a global system model complies such requirement. A home made tool implements these techniques. LOHR “Seam Sim” development deals with the partial automation of the FEA model generation based on the following key points: solid weld feature are generated in CAD, FEA model automation idealization is achieved without additional manual operation. Postal 2 post processing tool has been developed to allows standard FEA code results processing for both static and fatigue assessment.

40|$|International audienceIn this contribution, the {{formability}} of <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> cut <b>edges</b> is investigated using a damage model. Classical forming limit diagrams {{are known}} not to apply properly to the cut edges. However, with mild steels the sheet edges usually behave {{better than the}} Forming Limit Diagram predictions, so this phenomenon has not been given sufficient attention. In contrast, for Advanced High Strength Steels the cut edges exhibit reduced formability {{as compared to the}} plain sheet; this effect is very sensitive {{to the quality of the}} cutting process. The current investigation is aimed to evaluate the ability of available damage models to predict this effect on sample applications. The Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman model is used and the material parameters for a Dual Phase steel are considered [1]. The effect of the cutting process is described by means of initial fields of equivalent plastic strain and porosity. The geometrical distribution and typical values for these two initial fields are devised based on literature. Numerical simulations of flat notched tensile tests are used within the FE code Abaqus/Explicit to illustrate the impact of the initial fields on the moment and the location of the failure initiation. The influence of the mesh size in the cutting-affected area is also investigated. The hole expansion test and a flat bending test are further simulated to investigate the influence of the cut edge...|$|R
5000|$|The final panel {{fabrication}} process, after {{achieving the}} correct surface contour, {{is some kind}} of edge treatment, such as flanging (<b>sheet</b> <b>metal)</b> or wire <b>edging.</b> This finishes and strengthens the edge. Typically, there is {{too much or too little}} metal in the flange, which pulls the panel out of shape after the flange is turned—so it must be stretched or shrunk to correct the surface shape. This is most easily done using Eckold shrinking and stretching, but can be done using heat shrinking or cold shrinking, by tucking and beating the tucked metal into itself, or by using a cold shrinking hammer and dolly. Stretching or shrinking the flange requires a correct profile hammer and dolly. The hammer and dolly must match the desired flange shape at the point of contact through the flange, (known as ringing the dolly) with the hammer. A lot of shrinking or stretching work hardens the flange and can cause cracks and tears. While these can be welded, it is much better to anneal the metal before this happens to restore its workability.|$|R
