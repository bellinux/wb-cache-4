5|$|Visiting in 1787, the {{geologist}} James Hutton {{found his}} first {{example of an}} unconformity {{to the north of}} Newton Point near Lochranza, which provided evidence for his Plutonist theories of uniformitarianism and about the age of the Earth. This <b>spot</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the most famous}} places in the study of geology.|$|E
5|$|A 1663 will by Richard Harvey of Exeter {{established}} Almshouses {{which became}} Harvey's Hospital. These were rebuilt in 1870 largely of stone from previous building. In 1685 Chard {{was one of}} the towns in which Judge Jeffreys held some of the Bloody Assizes after the failure of the Monmouth Rebellion in which 160 men from Chard joined the forces of the Duke of Monmouth. The subsequent hangings took place on Snowden Hill {{to the west of the}} town. As elsewhere in this area, the 'finger-post' road-sign at this <b>spot</b> <b>is</b> painted red and is known as 'Red Post' to commemorate the executions.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its high}} level of {{nutrient}} requirements, cabbage is prone to nutrient deficiencies, including boron, calcium, phosphorus and potassium. There are several physiological disorders that can affect the postharvest appearance of cabbage. Internal tip burn occurs when the margins of inside leaves turn brown, but the outer leaves look normal. Necrotic <b>spot</b> <b>is</b> where there are oval sunken spots a few millimeters across that are often grouped around the midrib. In pepper spot, tiny black spots occur on the areas between the veins, which can increase during storage.|$|E
5000|$|Only three {{individual}} <b>spots</b> <b>were</b> eligible at the South American games. The fourth <b>spot</b> <b>was</b> {{transferred to}} the world rankings.|$|R
50|$|Maximum {{length is}} 10.3 cm SL. Numerous pale <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> uniformly {{distributed}} over a dark background. The <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> orange in certain live specimens.|$|R

Common <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> colored black, orange <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> only present (or much stronger) {{on the first}} image, blue <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> only present (or much stronger) on the second image.|$|R
5|$|If a {{laser beam}} is swept quickly across a distant object, the spot of light can move faster thanc, {{although}} the initial movement of the <b>spot</b> <b>is</b> delayed {{because of the time}} it takes light to get to the distant object at the speedc. However, the only physical entities that are moving are the laser and its emitted light, which travels at the speedc from the laser to the various positions of the spot. Similarly, a shadow projected onto a distant object can be made to move faster thanc, after a delay in time. In neither case does any matter, energy, or information travel faster than light.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} step, the crystal {{is placed in}} an intense beam of X-rays, usually of a single {{wavelength}} (monochromatic X-rays), producing the regular pattern of reflections. As the crystal is gradually rotated, previous reflections disappear and new ones appear; the intensity of every <b>spot</b> <b>is</b> recorded at every orientation of the crystal. Multiple data sets {{may have to be}} collected, with each set covering slightly more than half a full rotation of the crystal and typically containing tens of thousands of reflections.|$|E
5|$|Spots {{were found}} to {{correspond}} to three Galilean moons: Io, Europa and Ganymede. They develop because the co-rotation of the plasma is slowed {{in the vicinity of}} moons. The brightest spot belongs to Io, which is the main source of the plasma in the magnetosphere (see above). The Ionian auroral <b>spot</b> <b>is</b> thought to be related to Alfvén currents flowing from the Jovian to Ionian ionosphere. Europa's and Ganymede's spots are much dimmer, because these moons are weak plasma sources, because of sublimation of the water ice from their surfaces.|$|E
5000|$|Though {{the quota}} law {{mandates}} {{a certain percentage}} of candidate <b>spots</b> <b>be</b> reserved for women, it is not compulsory that those <b>spots</b> <b>be</b> filled by women.|$|R
30|$|To {{confirm the}} {{successful}} enzymatic formation of sugar esters the extracts were analyzed via TLC. In negative controls without lipase or fatty acid two slightly <b>spots</b> <b>were</b> visible. These <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> identical {{with the standards}} of pure glucose (Rf 0.1) and xylose (Rf 0.16) which demonstrated that these <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> sugars of the sugar mix in the used DES.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The black <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> {{necrotic}} <b>spots</b> or dead tissue due to {{the disease}} Pseudomonas syringae. The yellow halos surrounding the <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> chlorotic or yellowing tissue.|$|R
5|$|The {{renewal of}} his license {{was due to}} the fact that while there is a central {{registry}} of crimes and of traffic misdemeanors, no such registry exists for other misdemeanors in the Czech Republic. In the case where a non-traffic misdemeanor is solved on the spot (e.g. fining by a policeman), no record of it is made. Only when the investigated person or the police refuse to deal with the misdemeanor on the <b>spot,</b> <b>is</b> an administrative proceeding before a municipal misdemeanor committee initiated and if convicted, then a record of it is made by the municipality.|$|E
5|$|The visible {{scars from}} the impacts {{could be seen}} on Jupiter for many months. They were {{extremely}} prominent, and observers described them as even more easily visible than the Great Red Spot. A search of historical observations revealed that the spots were probably the most prominent transient features ever seen on the planet, and that although the Great Red <b>Spot</b> <b>is</b> notable for its striking color, no spots of the size and darkness of those caused by the SL9 impacts have ever been recorded before.|$|E
5|$|Gallium is {{used for}} {{neutrino}} detection. Possibly the largest amount of pure gallium ever collected in a single <b>spot</b> <b>is</b> the Gallium-Germanium Neutrino Telescope used by the SAGE experiment at the Baksan Neutrino Observatory in Russia. This detector contains 55–57 tonnes of liquid gallium. Another experiment was the GALLEX neutrino detector operated in the early 1990s in an Italian mountain tunnel. The detector contained 12.2 tons of watered gallium-71. Solar neutrinos caused a few atoms of 71Ga to become radioactive 71Ge, which were detected. This experiment showed that the solar neutrino flux is 40% less than theory predicted. This deficit was not explained until better solar neutrino detectors and theories were constructed (see SNO).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Highly {{sensitive}} Coomassie {{brilliant blue}} SeePico ™ Stain {{was applied for}} proteomic analysis using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 -DE) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). After staining with Flamingo ™ Fluorescent Gel Stain, {{the images of the}} protein <b>spots</b> <b>were</b> analyzed, and 424 protein <b>spots</b> <b>were</b> detected. After washing with Milli-Q water three times, the gels were re-stained with SeePico ™ Stain and the images of the protein <b>spots</b> <b>were</b> analyzed; 272 <b>spots</b> <b>were</b> detected. To assess whether SeePico ™ Stain alters MS analysis, a <b>spot</b> <b>was</b> picked up and was analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The MS analysis showed good protein identification. These results show a possible role for SeePico ™ Stain in cancer proteomics using 2 -DE and MS. Proteomics is an established molecular profiling technolog...|$|R

5000|$|On September 2, 2015, Artstyle returned, {{but as a}} substitute. The main roster <b>spot</b> <b>was</b> {{filled by}} {{acquiring}} M.Batbileg [...] "Ra", and the second substitute <b>spot</b> <b>was</b> filled by Ilnur [...] "Kudes" [...] Khafizov.|$|R
5|$|Heydrich was interred in Berlin's Invalidenfriedhof, a {{military}} cemetery. The exact burial <b>spot</b> <b>is</b> not known—a temporary wooden marker that disappeared when the Red Army overran {{the city in}} 1945 was never replaced, so that Heydrich's grave could not become a rallying point for Neo-Nazis. A photograph of Heydrich's burial shows the wreaths and mourners to be in section A, which abuts the north wall of the Invalidenfriedhof and Scharnhorststraße, {{at the front of}} the cemetery. A recent biography of Heydrich also places the grave in Section A. Hitler planned for Heydrich to have a monumental tomb (designed by sculptor Arno Breker and architect Wilhelm Kreis) but, due to Germany's declining fortunes, it was never built.|$|E
5|$|The Scooter {{is another}} storm, a white cloud group farther south than the Great Dark Spot. This {{nickname}} first arose {{during the months}} leading up to the Voyager 2 encounter in 1989, when they were observed moving at speeds faster than the Great Dark Spot (and images acquired later would subsequently reveal the presence of clouds moving even faster than those that had initially been detected by Voyager 2). The Small Dark <b>Spot</b> <b>is</b> a southern cyclonic storm, the second-most-intense storm observed during the 1989 encounter. It was initially completely dark, but as Voyager 2 approached the planet, a bright core developed and can be seen in most of the highest-resolution images.|$|E
5|$|The {{coloration}} of the upperparts {{is generally}} uniform, with some scattered darker hairs. There is a yellow {{ring around the}} eyes, which is more prominent than in A.sylvanus. The underparts are not strongly demarcated from the upperparts in color and are yellow-brown to gray. There are some scattered white hairs on the chin. Although this white <b>spot</b> <b>is</b> better developed than in A.sylvanus, A.spegazzinii lacks the conspicuous white spot seen in A.simulator. The color of the feet ranges from white and yellow-brown to gray. Ungual tufts of hairs cover the claws; these hairs are grayish-brown at the bases and whitish at the tips. The amount of hair on the tail is variable, but it is dark brown above and white to yellow-brown below. High-altitude animals tend to have hairier ears and tails.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{specimens}} {{have on the}} upperside of the hindwings a small, ochraceous,submarginal spot {{between the}} lower median nervules below, the series of submarginal <b>spots</b> <b>is</b> always complete, but the <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> often very feebly marked.|$|R
50|$|Candy <b>Spots</b> <b>was</b> one of {{the best}} American juveniles of his generation, winning the Arlington-Washington Futurity Stakes among his 3 for 3 record at 2. Candy <b>Spots</b> <b>was</b> undefeated in starts going into the Kentucky Derby.|$|R
30|$|To measure DO at {{different}} depths in the PBR, oxygen sensor <b>spots</b> <b>were</b> {{placed on the}} side wall {{at different}} distances from PBR bottom. For the culture depth of 2.5  cm, one sensor <b>spot</b> <b>was</b> placed 1.25  cm above the bottom. For culture depth of 5.0, 7.5, and 10  cm, two sensor <b>spots</b> <b>were</b> placed: one was 1.0  cm below the medium surface, {{and the other was}} 1.0  cm above PBR bottom.|$|R
5|$|The {{field for}} the main event {{consisted}} only of 30 trucks {{instead of the usual}} 36, with the top 20 trucks in the owner's points standings guaranteed a spot. To determine the field, two-lap qualifying runs were held, which determined the starting grids for five heat races of eight laps each. The top five fastest qualifiers started on the pole for the heats, and the highest non-locked-in truck were transferred in to the main event until there were 25 trucks in the field. For drivers that did not qualify via the heats, the top four in a last-chance qualifier advance, with the final spot reserved for the most recent series champion, and if that <b>spot</b> <b>is</b> vacant, the fifth-place finisher in the LCQ would qualify for the main event.|$|E
5|$|The {{oldest and}} most precise method of X-ray {{crystallography}} is single-crystal X-ray diffraction, in which a beam of X-rays strikes a single crystal, producing scattered beams. When they land {{on a piece of}} film or other detector, these beams make a diffraction pattern of spots; the strengths and angles of these beams are recorded as the crystal is gradually rotated. Each <b>spot</b> <b>is</b> called a reflection, since it corresponds to the reflection of the X-rays from one set of evenly spaced planes within the crystal. For single crystals of sufficient purity and regularity, X-ray diffraction data can determine the mean chemical bond lengths and angles to within a few thousandths of an angstrom and to within a few tenths of a degree, respectively. The atoms in a crystal are not static, but oscillate about their mean positions, usually by less than a few tenths of an angstrom. X-ray crystallography allows measuring the size of these oscillations.|$|E
5|$|The three {{subspecies}} {{also differ}} in their colour. A. m. angolensis has a brown to tawny coat, with thick, dark brown stripes on the face extending two-thirds down to the snout. While the lateral stripe is nearly black, the stripe on the rump is dark brown. The medium brown forehead patch extends to eye level and is separated from the bright white face by a dark brown border. A brown <b>spot</b> <b>is</b> seen on the nose. A. m. hofmeyri is a light fawn, with thin, dark brown face stripes. The stripes on the flanks are dark brown to black, and the posterior stripes are moderately brown. The forehead patch, dark brown or fawn, extends beyond {{the level of the}} eyes and mixes with the white of the face without any clear barriers. The nose may have a pale smudge. A. m. marsupialis is a rich chestnut brown, with thin, light face stripes. The stripe near the rump is well-marked, and that on the flanks is deep brown. The forehead is brown, fawn, or white, the patch not extending beyond the eyes and having no sharp boundaries. The nose is white or marked with brown.|$|E
5000|$|A {{total of}} 176 {{international}} roster <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> divided among the 22 clubs. These <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> tradable, such that some clubs {{may have more}} than eight and some clubs may have fewer than eight. There is no limit {{on the number of}} international roster spots on each club's roster. The remaining roster <b>spots</b> must <b>be</b> filled by domestic players.|$|R
50|$|From 2014-15 season, new format was introduced. It {{was still}} 20 teams, but 16 <b>spots</b> <b>were</b> awarded to teams from First League of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina while {{remaining}} 4 <b>spots</b> <b>were</b> filled with teams from cantonal cups.|$|R
50|$|The {{relationship}} between hydrocarbons and direct hydrocarbon indicators, such as bright <b>spots,</b> <b>is</b> not straightforward {{and not all}} bright <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> caused {{by the presence of}} hydrocarbons and therefore they should not be treated as conclusive evidence of hydrocarbon accumulations.|$|R
