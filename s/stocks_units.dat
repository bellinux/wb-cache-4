40|$|This paper {{uses the}} Benninga-Helmantel-Sarig (2005) {{framework}} to value equity based compensation (employee stock options (ESOs) and restricted <b>stocks</b> <b>units</b> (RSU)) in a framework which takes explicit account of employee non-diversification {{in addition to}} the standard features of vesting and forfeit (or forced exercise) of the stock options. This framework provides an endogenous explanation of early exercise of employee stock options, has a computational advantage over existing utility maximizing models, and also allows us to quantify the non-diversification effects. Using a proprietary dataset which contain 33, 294 employee stock option exercise records at sixty five publically traded firms between 1993 - 2009 (both executive and non-executive employees), we measure the non-marketability associated with untradeable stock options, and use it to value ESOs. We find that the private pricing model value at the grant date is about 50 % less than the value of a plain vanilla Black-Scholes option value. We also find that the private pricing model is aligned with empirical findings of ESOs. This pricing has implication for the FAS 123 (R) for estimating the fair value of share based payment.

The major improvement was the use of motor alternators for the auxiliary supplies using static rectification, instead of the motor generator sets. The drivers brake valve used the more reliable poppet valve instead of rotary type face valves, and the electro-pneumatic valves used plug in connectors, speeding up replacement and reducing faults due to bad electrical connections.|$|R

The units replaced the even older and life-expired British Rail Classes 485 and 486 units, which were introduced in 1967, but were originally built as 'Standard' <b>stock</b> <b>units</b> for the London Electric Railway in 1923.

50|$|Before mass {{production}} of the 1959 tube stock, three 1956 Tube <b>Stock</b> <b>units</b> were built as prototypes. These units were tested on the Piccadilly line and remained in service after production trains were introduced. Later they were transferred to the Northern line, but in 1995 they were replaced as non-standard by 1962 Stock cascaded from the Central line.|$|R
50|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, the 1962 Stock was due for replacement.

50|$|The 1962 Stock {{was ordered}} {{as a matter}} of urgency to replace the Standard Stock {{previously}} used on the Central line. Two fires on Standard <b>Stock</b> <b>units</b> (in 1958 and 1960) resulted in the hospitalisation of dozens of passengers.

The assumption was made, that the reason of reliable correlation between recruitment dynamics of <b>stock</b> <b>units</b> under consideration was the identical (or opposite) reaction to interannual fluctuations of water temperature.
