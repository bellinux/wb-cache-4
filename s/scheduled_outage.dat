40|$|This paper {{discusses}} algorithms to {{find the}} optimal threshold and also investigates the impact of threshold quantization on the <b>scheduling</b> <b>outage</b> performance of the opportunistic splitting scheduling algorithm. Since this algorithm aims at finding the user with the highest channel quality within the minimal number of mini-slots by adjusting the threshold every mini-slot, optimizing the threshold is of paramount importance. Hence, {{in this paper we}} first discuss how to compute the optimal threshold along with two tight approximations for the optimal threshold. Closed-form expressions are provided for those approximations for simple calculations. Then, we consider linear quantization of the threshold to take the limited number of bits for signaling messages in practical systems into consideration. Due to the limited granularity for the quantized threshold value, an irreducible <b>scheduling</b> <b>outage</b> floor is observed. The numerical results show that the two approximations offer lower <b>scheduling</b> <b>outage</b> probability floors compared to the conventional algorithm when the threshold is quantized. © 2006 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY This letter {{proposes a}} {{multiuser}} switched scheduling scheme with per-user threshold and post user selection {{and provides a}} generic analytical framework for determining the optimal feedback thresholds. The proposed scheme applies an individual feedback threshold for each user rather than a single common threshold for all users to achieve some capacity gain due to the flexibility of threshold selection {{as well as a}} lower <b>scheduling</b> <b>outage</b> probability. In addition, since <b>scheduling</b> <b>outage</b> may occur with a non-negligible probability, the proposed scheme employs post user selection in order to further improve the ergodic capacity, where the user with the highest potential for a higher channel quality than other users is selected. Numerical and simulation results show that the capacity gain by post user selection is significant when random sequence is used.

40|$|Abstract- A partial {{discharge}} is the {{dissipation of energy}} caused by the build up of localized electric field intensity. In high voltage devices such as transformers, this build of charge and its release can be symptomatic of problems associated with aging, such as floating components and insulation breakdown. This is why PD detection is used in power systems to monitor the state of health of high voltage transformers. If such problems are not detected and repaired the strength and frequency of PDs increases and eventually leads to the catastrophic failure of the transformer, which can cause external equipment damage, fires and loss of revenue due to an <b>scheduled</b> <b>outage.</b> Reliable online PD detection is critical need for power companies to improve personnel safety and decrease the potential for loss of service. _______________________________________________________________________________________________________ I...|$|E

40|$|LecturePg. 137 - 144 A process recycle gas {{compressor}} was needed {{that would be}} highly reliable and tolerant of suction contaminants of sticky material that is abrasive and corrosive. Squeeze film dampers, pinched diffusers, and other technologies created a robust design that proved highly tolerant of extreme process upsets as well as normal demands. Impeller tip speed limits help control erosion and an open-faced, radial vane impeller minimizes fouling. Custom five-axis milled Inconel 625 impellers with splitter vanes and pinched diffusers allowed adaptation of a standard compressor frame to meet thermodynamic needs without excess flow. Squeeze film damper bearings with flexible pivots yielded a rotor bearing system highly tolerant of unbalance with excellent cross-couple stability. The compressor was test run four hours with a shaking force two and one half times rotor weight while running below vibration and bearing temperature interlocks. Other features were also provided to improve reliability. During two extreme process upsets, the impeller blade tips were almost completely eroded away in just 10 days, but operation was able to continue until a <b>scheduled</b> <b>outage...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a stochastic {{model for the}} op-timal risk-based generation maintenance <b>outage</b> <b>scheduling</b> based on hourly price-based unit commitment in a generation company (GENCO). Such maintenance <b>outage</b> <b>schedules</b> will be submitted by GENCOs to the ISO for approval before implementation. The objective of a GENCO is to consider financial risks when scheduling its midterm maintenance outages. The GENCO also coordinates its proposed <b>outage</b> <b>scheduling</b> with short-term unit commitment for maximizing payoffs. The proposed model is a stochastic mixed integer linear program in which random hourly prices of energy, ancillary services, and fuel are modeled as sce-narios in the Monte Carlo method. Financial risks associated with price uncertainty are considered by applying expected downside risks which are incorporated explicitly as constraints. This paper shows that GENCOs could decrease financial risks by adjusting expected payoffs. Illustrative examples show the calculation of GENCO’s midterm generation maintenance schedule, risk level, hourly unit commitment, and hourly dispatch for bidding into energy and ancillary services markets.

40|$|In {{underlay}} {{cognitive radio}} networks, secondary users can share the spectrum with primary users {{as long as}} the interference caused by the secondary users to primary users is below a certain predetermined threshold. It is reasonable to assume that there is always a large pool of secondary users trying to access the channel, which can be occupied by only one secondary user at a given time. As a result, a multi-user scheduling problem arises among the secondary users. In this thesis, by manipulating basic schemes based on selective multi-user diversity, normalized thresholding, transmission power control, and opportunistic round robin, we propose and analyze eight scheduling schemes of secondary users in an underlay cognitive radio set-up. The system performance of these schemes is quantified by using various performance metrics such as the average system capacity, normalized average feedback load, <b>scheduling</b> <b>outage</b> probability, and system fairness of access. In our proposed schemes, the best user out of all the secondary users in the system is picked to transmit at each given time slot in order to maximize the average system capacity. Two thresholds are used in the two rounds of the selection process to determine the best user. The first threshold is raised by the power constraint from the primary user. The second threshold, which can be adjusted by us, is introduced to reduce the feedback load. The overall system performance is therefore dependent on the choice of these two thresholds and the number of users in the system given the channel conditions for all the users. In this thesis, by deriving analytical formulas and presenting numerical examples, we try to provide insights {{of the relationship between the}} performance metrics and the involved parameters including two selection thresholds and the number of active users in the system, in an effort to maximize the average system capacity as well as satisfy the requirements of <b>scheduling</b> <b>outage</b> probability and feedback load...|$|R
40|$|Because of {{inherent}} stochasticity, cost {{implication of}} voltage sags compared to <b>scheduled</b> <b>outages</b> {{are very high}} typically for an industrial or commercial load. Since, different types of equipment behave differently during voltage sag events, and interconnection {{of these types of}} equipment to control a process or a load is very complex, exact cost calculation of voltage sag events is difficult.

Therefore, calculation of 2 ̆ 7 risk of process failure 2 ̆ 7 under voltage sag events assumes significance. This paper critically reviews the concept of 2 ̆ 7 risk of process failure 2 ̆ 7 as viewed by different researchers and highlights the necessity of further research in this area. The overall risk of process failure can be useful for cost-benefit analysis of mitigation methods to minimize the cost implication of voltage sags...|$|R
40|$|An {{efficient}} scheduling request algorithm for opportunistic wireless access based on user grouping is proposed in this paper. Similar to the well-known opportunistic splitting algorithm, the proposed algorithm initially adjusts (or lowers) the threshold during a guard period if no user sends a scheduling request. However, if multiple users make requests simultaneously {{and therefore a}} collision occurs, the proposed algorithm no longer updates the threshold but narrows down the user search space by splitting the users into multiple groups iteratively, whereas the opportunistic splitting algorithm keeps adjusting the threshold until a single user is found. Since the threshold is only updated when no user sends a request, it is shown that the proposed algorithm significantly alleviates {{the burden of the}} signaling for the threshold distribution to the users by the scheduler. More importantly, the proposed algorithm requires a less number of mini-slots to make a user selection given a certain <b>scheduling</b> <b>outage</b> probability. © 2011 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|Multiuser {{diversity}} {{is inherent in}} wireless networks due to independent channel variations of different users. It requires that the transmitter has {{the knowledge of the}} channel state information (CSI) of each user in the downlink. Too much feedback will bring a heavy load to the system in some cases. This paper investigates the problem of exploiting multiuser diversity in a one source multiple destinations wireless transmission system with limited feedback. A strategy for obtaining the optimal multiple rate level and the maximum achievable sum rate is proposed in this paper. Moreover, the <b>scheduling</b> <b>outage</b> probability, the probability that rates of all users are below a threshold, is also analyzed. For one-bit feedback, a tight bound of the achievable rate is obtained. It is shown that the achievable rate nearly capture the order of the double-logarithmical of the number of users in full CSI systems. Numerical results are also presented. The achievable sum rate is close to the full CSI capacity via limited feedback as the number of users is large enough. © 2009 IEEE...|$|R
