40|$|Burns of {{the front}} of the chest and abdomen and {{sometimes}} {{the front of the}} neck and axilla, mostly caused by flame in domestic accidents, are very common in Egypt. If deep, these burns can produce breast deformity in females either in childhood or in adolescence. This work considers 74 female breasts in 55 patients who had post-burn breast deformities due to accidents in childhood or early adulthood. The patients’ median age was 21 years (range, 13 to 42 years). The cause was scalding in 18 patients and flame in 37. The following conditions were found: upward contracture in 26 breasts (35 %), 21 patients; downward contracture in 32 breasts (43 %), 25 patients; and loss or distortion of the nipple/areola complex in 16 breasts (22 %), 9 patients. Surgical correction included: Z-plasty, scar revision, scar excision and reconstruction by local flap or skin graft, and use of tissue expanders. Adequate projection of the reconstructed breast with the creation of a normal-looking inframammary fold was obtained. There were no major complications. Two patients had partial skin loss of the <b>split-thickness</b> <b>graft,</b> and partial loss of edges of the areola occurred in three cases. The burns thus caused various degrees of breast deformity and the corrective surgery varied accordingly. It is concluded that in such cases the general rules of scar revision have to be applied, correcting the contracture by Z-plasty or else by a local flap, if available, or by a <b>split-thickness</b> <b>graft</b> if the surrounding area is affected by post-burn scarring or if a large defect appears after complete release.

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of composites and bonding in orthodontics, the possibilities of aligning impacted teeth into the dental arch after a surgical intervention, have remarkably increased. There are 4 important treatment techniques. The closed-eruption technique includes bracket-bonding to and ligating of the exposed tooth, followed by repositioning of the mucosal flap. The disadvantage of the method is the uncontrollable orthodontic force on the non-visible tooth during orthodontic extrusion. The open-eruption technique aims at keeping the exposed tooth visible, followed by spontaneous eruption. However, the exposure appears often as a radical exposure with unfavourable gingival consequences. The open-eruption technique with apical positioned mucosal flap is designed to expose teeth highly buccally impacted. The mucosal graft may cause a typical thick, stretched and not aesthetically acceptable gum after orthodontic treatment, even in case of using a <b>split-thickness</b> <b>graft.</b> The modified window technique is an open-eruption technique with minimal exposure, resulting in immediate eruption. If orthodontic treatment is required, the tooth is no longer impacted. The success rates of the 4 techniques vary from 75 until 99 %. Study of the literature reveals insufficient scientific evidence in favour of 1 treatment technique. However, independent of the surgical technique applied, general practitioners {{play a crucial role}} in diagnostics of eruption failures and timely referral to an orthodontist...|$|E
30|$|Skin {{grafting}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} convenient and useful treatment methods for skin defects caused by full-thickness burns, trauma, or tumor tissue excision. In skin grafting, graft fixation is important. Use of sutures or staples is a standard method for skin fixation (Zederfeldt 1994; Waiker and Shinalingappa 2015; Butts et al. 2015); however, the use of fibrin glue has also been suggested. Use of fibrin as an adhesive was introduced by Bergel in 1909, and Tidrick and Warner used fibrin for skin graft fixation for the first time in 1944 (Saltz et al. 1991). Since the 2000 s, many instances of graft fixation using fibrin have been reported, but the process of obtaining fibrin remains difficult. Fibrin sealants prepared using autologous blood and ready-made sealants contain a low thrombin concentration of 5  IU/mL, which are restrictedly obtainable in Europe and Canada. Fibrin sealant products available in South Korea and the United States are fast-clotting, with a high thrombin concentration of 400  IU/mL; thus, they must be diluted to a lower concentration, which requires significant time and effort (Gibran et al. 2007; Mittermayr et al. 2006; Buckley et al. 1999; Currie et al. 2001). Fibrin containing 400  IU/mL thrombin is typically used for hemostasis. When used to facilitate skin grafting, however, clotting occurs before the <b>split-thickness</b> <b>graft</b> can be manipulated due to its short coagulation time. Accordingly, it is difficult to insert the graft into the wound bed.|$|E
40|$|A new {{biodegradable}} copolymer {{based on}} poly(ethylene glycol terephthalate) /poly(butylene terephthalate) {{has been extensively}} tested as a potential implant in various fields of medicine. This material, tested in vitro, complied successfully with all requirements concerning cytotoxicity, mutagenicity and biocompatibility. When tested in experimental animals as a skin regeneration its clinical performance was very encouraging. In the experimental part of this thesis this copolymer was studied as a feasible implant, positively affecting the healing of full-thickness skiln defects. The pilot clinical trial was targeted to prove the safety and biocompatibility of a dermal substitute based on PEGT/PBT copolymer when applied into the skin wound. Another aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate its clinical effectiveness in two-step surgical procedure (1 st operation - the implantation of the dermal scaffold, 2 nd - grafting with <b>split-thickness</b> <b>graft</b> (STSG)). It concerned the influence on the rate of STSG contraction and final cosmetic view of the treated wound. The results proved that the material is safe and biodegradable. No adverse effects caused by the substitute were observed within 1 year course of the trial. On the other hand, the presence of the dermal matrix in the skin defects had no positive effect on the graft contraction and no histological differences were observed in the scar structure when compared to the scar formed after application of STSG alone. Electron microscopy revealed a slow intracellular biodegradation of the phagocytized scaffold particles. The long time gap between the scaffold implantation and its grafting seemed to be one of the causes of the poor clinical performance of this substitute.

However, the clinical outcomes of hair follicle <b>grafting</b> compared to <b>split-thickness</b> skin <b>grafting</b> have not been examined. This study sought to compare the clinical outcomes of patients with chronic wounds fol-lowing hair follicle therapy and <b>split-thickness</b> skin <b>graft</b> therapy in a relatively large cohort of patients. Forty patients were enrolled in the study, a retrospective analysis of all patients underwent therapy with hair follicles (cohort A) and <b>split-thickness</b> skin <b>grafts</b> (cohort B) was performed. Safety, healing duration, skin quality (recipient site), scar formation (donor site) and overall postoperative outcome were analyzed. The wound sites were examined using photography at weeks 2, 8, and 12 after surgery. Five non-biased reviewers estimated the above-mentioned clinical outcomes using a five-point Likert scale. The ages and wound areas were similar between cohorts A (n= 20) and B (n= 20). Total wound closure was observed and adverse events were rare and controllable in both cohorts. The skin and scar quality were rated significantly higher in the hair follicle cohort than the <b>split-thickness</b> skin <b>graft</b> cohort (4. 40 vs 3. 45, P< 0. 05 and 4. 65 vs 3. 20, P< 0. 05; respectively).

40|$|AbstractIntroductionMale genital {{degloving}} {{injuries are}} unusual and rarely caused by animal bite. Usually patients attend health care immediately if bitten in the genital area. Prophylactic antibiotics is routinely used (Gomes et al., 2000). A penile degloving usually begins just proximal of the coronal line and progress {{down to the}} base of the shaft. Deep erectile tissue and the spermatic cord are seldom damaged and the endogenous skin of glans usually survives (Brown and Fryer, 1957; Morey et al., 2004; Finical and Arnold, 1999). Presentation of caseA heavily smoking man with a previous history of bladder cancer presented himself to the emergency department 24 h after a dog bite degloved his penis. The avulsed skin was necrotic and subsequently excised. Antibiotic treatment was started. A bacterial swab was found positive for canine oral flora. The skin defect was closed using a 1 : 1 meshed split thickness skin graft from the inner thigh. Smoking cessation was encouraged. At the three month follow up the patient expressed satisfaction with both cosmetic and functional result and was now non-smoking. DiscussionSeveral approaches to reconstruct penile skin exist. Split thickness skin graft has been lifted as a preferable alternative (Brown and Fryer, 1957; Finical and Arnold, 1999; Paraskevas et al., 2003) [5]. In this case, the avulsed skin was necrotic and could not be used. A 1 : 1 meshed <b>split-thickness</b> <b>graft</b> was chosen with excellent results. Conclusion 1 : 1 mesh of the graft can be recommended for easy attachment with a good functional and esthetical result. The potential risk of losing intimacy appearance or having to go through repeated procedures in the genital area motivated smoking cessation for this patient...|$|E
40|$|Skin grafts are an {{invaluable}} tool for plastic sur-geons, {{but they are}} not without complications. The significant cosmetic disadvantage associ-ated with grafting is the obvious transition between normal skin and skin graft. We describe a novel use of pinking shears to create a serrated edge on both the skin graft and the recipient defect so as to somewhat blur the transition point between the two, thereby creating a more aesthetically pleasing wound. A 25 -year-old female was referred to our service with a view to scar revision on the volar aspect of her left forearm. She had a significant past medi-cal history of depression and had deliberately self-harmed multiple times in the past by lacerating her left arm volar surface with a razor blade. All of these horizontal lacerations had been superficial but had produced significant and unsightly scarring. The pa-tient’s depression had been well managed for several years and she had not deliberately self-harmed dur-ing this time frame. She was anxious for excision of the scarred area and reconstruction of the defect. A 10 × 15 cm area of scarred skin on the volar fore-arm was excised en bloc under tourniquet control. The edges of the defect were freshened using pink-ing shears to create a serrated effect. Pinking shears are dressmaking scissors, the blades of which are saw toothed instead of straight, which leave a chev-ron pattern instead of a straight edge. A 10 × 20 cm piece of Integra was cut to fit the defect, and the edges of the Integra were also freshened with the pinking shears. The Integra edge was carefully lined up with the defect edge and secured with a running 5 - 0 Vicryl Rapide suture (Ethicon, Somerville, N. J.). A negative pressure wound therapy device was ap-plied over this and suction was set at a continuous 75 mm Hg. The patient was discharged after 5 days, and the negative pressure wound therapy dressing was changed after 1 week. Twenty-one days after the original surgery, the patient was brought back to theater for the definitive skin graft. A <b>split-thickness</b> <b>graft</b> was harvested from the left thigh and fenes-trated with a scalpel before being laid onto the In-tegra surface. The graft was reviewed after 1 week, and there was 100 % take. The patient has been fol-lowed up as an outpatient, and 6 months postrecon-struction, she is extremely happy with the result...|$|E

MethodsThis prospective study included 20 patients with partial- or full-thickness skin defects; the patients were enrolled between January 2013 and March 2014. After skin defect debridement, the wound was divided into two parts by an imaginary line. <b>Split-thickness</b> skin <b>grafting</b> alone was performed on one side (group A), and RapiGraft and <b>split-thickness</b> skin <b>grafting</b> were used on the other side (group B). All patients were evaluated using photographs and self-questionnaires. The Manchester scar scale (MSS), a chromameter, and a durometer were used for the scar evaluation. The average follow-up period was 6 months. ResultsThe skin graft take rates were 93 % in group A and 89 % in group B, a non-significant difference (P= 0. 082). Statistically, group B had significantly lower MSS, vascularity, and pigmentation results than group A (P< 0. 05 for all). However, the groups did not differ significantly in pliability (P= 0. 155).

Thirty-seven transgender patients had a neophallus created from a radial forearm free flap, and all were operated on by the same senior surgeon. Eight patients had their donor site defect closed by total skin grafting and 29 patients, operated on after 2009, received a <b>split-thickness</b> skin <b>graft</b> with MatriDerm closure. All 37 patients were evaluated by questionnaire and by careful clinical examination. Pressure perception was assessed with the Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test.

Pressure perception values showed better sensory return in the MatriDerm group. <b>Split-thickness</b> skin <b>grafting</b> with MatriDerm achieved superior results in skin sensibility, superficial radial nerve recovery, and cosmetic aspect. Our findings support the hypothesis that MatriDerm can be used to preserve sensory function and decrease morbidity of the donor site. The use of a dermal substitute decreases the morbidity of the forearm free flap donor site. The strength of this study is its retrospective nature conducted of a prospectively maintained database of 37 consecutive radial forearm free flaps with superimposable dimensions and location performed by the same surgeon, thus limiting biases.

40|$|Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), an alkyl sulfate {{surfactant}} {{derived from}} an organic alcohol, possesses surfactant properties but also denatures and unfolds both monomeric and subunit proteins. In preliminary experiments, we demonstrated that SDS {{is a potent}} inactivator of herpes simplex virus type 2 and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 at concentrations comparable to those used for the surfactant nonoxynol- 9. We hypothesized that SDS might be capable of denaturing the capsid proteins of nonenveloped viruses. In this report, we demonstrate inactivation of rabbit, bovine, and human papillomaviruses after brief treatment with dilute solutions of SDS. Effective concentrations were nontoxic to rabbit skin and to <b>split-thickness</b> <b>grafts</b> of human foreskin epithelium. This is the first report of a microbicidal surfactant that will inactivate papillomaviruses. We propose that SDS is now a candidate microbicide for formulation and testing with humans...|$|R
40|$|Patients {{with severe}} HS or Necrotizing Fasciitis often require {{extensive}} surgical debridement. Traditionally, these wounds {{have been closed}} using <b>split-thickness</b> skin <b>grafts</b> {{with or without the}} use of the VAC device. Our case study demonstrates good outcomes using the VAC device alone to achieve complete closure when applied immediately following debridement with frequent VAC changes...|$|R
