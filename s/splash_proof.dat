2500|$|Chlorine is a {{relatively}} common gas in industry {{with a variety of}} uses. It is used to disinfect water as well as being a part of the sanitation process for sewage and industrial waste. Chlorine is also used as a bleaching agent during the production of paper and cloth. Many household cleaning products, including bleach, contain chlorine. Given the volume and ease of chlorine for industrial and commercial use, exposure could occur from an accidental spill or a deliberate attack. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends that a person wear <b>splash</b> <b>proof</b> goggles, a face shield and a respirator mask when working in the vicinity of chlorine gas. Because chlorine is a gas at room temperature, most exposure occurs via inhalation. Exposure may also occur through skin or eye contact or by ingesting chlorine-contaminated food or water. Chlorine is a strong oxidizing element causing the hydrogen to split from water in moist tissue, resulting in nascent oxygen and hydrogen chloride that cause corrosive tissue damage. Additionally oxidation of chlorine may form hypochlorous acid, which can penetrate cells and react with cytoplasmic proteins destroying cell structure. Chlorine’s odor provides early warning signs of exposure but causes olfactory fatigue or adaptations, reducing awareness of exposure at low concentrations. With increased exposure, symptoms may progress to labored respirations, severe coughing, chest tightness, wheezing, dyspnea, and broncospasm associated with a decrease in oxygen saturation level[...] Severe exposure may result in [...] changes in upper and lower airways resulting in an acute lung injury, which may not be present until several hours after exposure. A recent chlorine gas leak in Pune, India, landed 20 individuals in the hospital. Though that was an accidental exposure, chlorine gas {{has been used as a}} weapon of warfare since World War I, most recently in 2007 in Iraq.|$|E
5000|$|The {{development}} of the E-1 involved the revitalization of Olympus' old Zuiko lens brand, through a new range named [...] "Zuiko Digital" [...] with the Four Thirds system lens mount. The E-1 was usually sold bundled with a <b>splash</b> <b>proof</b> Zuiko Digital 14-54 mm 1:2.8-3.5 zoom lens.|$|E
50|$|The {{manufacturer}} {{has indicated}} {{the time to}} acquire auto focus as 0.07 seconds. The electronic OLED viewfinder has a resolution of 2.36 million dots and, as in the predecessor, is tiltable. The 3″ OLED touchscreen rear display is fully articulated and can display 1.04 million dots. The camera is <b>splash</b> <b>proof.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Epic has a fixed 35mm f/2.8 lens, and {{can focus}} down to 35 cm. It has a spot meter, and {{optional}} red eye reduction. The design is very tough {{and the camera}} can be carried in a pocket or handbag without fear of damage. The camera is also very lightweight 145 g and <b>splash</b> <b>proof.</b>|$|E
50|$|Club members race in a tri-colour kit. It is Royal Blue and Sky Blue and White side stripes. In {{addition}} to this, {{the vast majority}} of the club own numerous other items of kit including the ubiquitous splash jacket A rowing splash jacket is a wind and <b>splash</b> <b>proof,</b> ventilated, long-sleeved jacket that is designed for rowing and bankside activity. The Club crest is similar to the York St John University crest but includes two rowing blades with the blade colours.|$|E
5000|$|Bathroom {{lighting}} {{should be}} uniform, bright and must minimize glare. For all the activities like shaving, showering, grooming etc. one must ensure equitable lighting {{across the entire}} bathroom space. The mirror area should definitely {{have at least two}} sources of light at least 1 feet apart to eliminate any shadows on the face. Skin tones and hair color are highlighted with a tinge of yellow light. Ceiling and wall lights must be safe for use in a bathroom (electrical parts need to be <b>splash</b> <b>proof)</b> and therefore must carry appropriate certification such as IP44.|$|E
