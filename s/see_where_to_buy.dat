60|$|Dick consented. On the way {{to dinner}} the Admiral showed him <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> gloves, and made him <b>buy</b> them; <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> cigars, and made him buy a vast store, some of which he obligingly accepted.

And all the while Dick smilingly consented, understanding well that he was being done, but taking his losses in the pursuit of character as a hunter sacrifices his dogs. As for the Strange Things, the reader will be relieved to hear that they were no stranger than might have been expected, and he may find things quite as strange without the expense of a Van Tromp for guide. Yet he was a guide of no mean order, who made up for the poverty of what he had to show by a copious, imaginative commentary.|$|R
40|$|Consumers {{play a very}} {{important}} role in the economy. They are the largest economic group in any country. All our present day activities are carried on because of consumers only. They are the pillars of the economy. Consumers are the users of goods and services for the satisfaction of their wants. They want <b>to</b> know <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy,</b> when <b>to</b> <b>buy,</b> how much <b>to</b> <b>buy,</b> how <b>to</b> pay, how to recognize and they also compare qualities of products. They are the keystone and play an important part of our economic structure...|$|R

30|$|The Consumer Decision Process Model by Blackwell et al. (2005) {{describes}} consumers’ {{decision process}} behavior from need recognition to satisfaction after purchasing products. The model describes environmental influences and individual differences as factors affecting consumers in {{all stages of}} the decision making process. Environmental influences include culture, social class, personal influence, family, and situation. Individual differences are consumer resources, motivation and involvement, knowledge, attitudes, and personality, values, and lifestyles. These factors interact to determine pre-purchase evaluation of alternate products and services and, ultimately, influence consumers’ decisions about whether <b>to</b> <b>buy,</b> when <b>to</b> <b>buy,</b> what <b>to</b> <b>buy,</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy,</b> and how <b>to</b> pay.|$|R
40|$|First, we analyze how regular {{days off}} from {{competition}} and a time-dependent price pattern affect firm performance. Second, {{we examine the}} effects on firms' profitability from consumers’ changing search- and timing behavior. We use microdata from gasoline retailing in Norway. Since 2004, firms have practiced an industry-wide day off from competition, starting on Mondays at noon, by increasing prices to a common level given by the recommended prices (decided and published in advance). Hence, firms know when and to what level to raise their price. In areas without local competition, retail prices are always equal to the recommended prices. Hinged on this, we regard recommended prices as the monopoly price level. In turn, a foreseeable low-price window is open before every restoration. During the data period, we observe an additional weekly restoration on Thursdays at noon. We show that an additional day off from competition increases firm performance. As expected, a conventional price search of <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> reduces firms’ profitability. In contrast, consumers who {{are aware of the}} cycle and spend effort on when <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> {{have a positive impact on}} firms’ profitability. If consumers spend effort on when <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> rather than <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy,</b> price competition might be softened even in the low-price windows...|$|R

40|$|Most {{e-commerce}} sites to-date {{have focused}} on helping con-sumers decide what <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> and <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy.</b> We study the complementary question of helping consumers decide when <b>to</b> <b>buy,</b> focusing on consumer durables. We introduce a utility-based model for evaluating different approaches to this question. We focus {{on how best to}} make use of fore-casts in making recommendations, and propose three nat-ural strategies. We establish a relationship between these strategies, and show that one of them is optimal. We con-duct a large-scale experimental study to test the perfor-mance and robustness of these strategies.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{framework}} for the joint study of the consumer's decision of <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> and what <b>to</b> <b>buy.</b> The framework is rooted in utility theory where the utility is for a particular channel/brand combination. The framework contains firm actions, the consumer search process, the choice process, and consumer learning. We develop research questions within each of these areas. We then discuss methodological issues pertaining {{to the use of}} experimentation and econometrics. Our framework suggests that brand and channel choices are closely intertwined, and therefore studying them jointly will reveal a deeper understanding of consumer decision making in the modern marketing environment...|$|R

40|$|The authors study {{pricing and}} {{advertising}} strategies of retailers {{competing for the}} demand of an assortment of goods. In a model where uninformed rational consumers decide <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> each product, they find that firms advertise prices below marginal cost to attract consumers into the store and profit from other goods that consumers plan <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> at the store. Incorporating product-line decisions indicates that firms do not restrict their product assortment even when they make a loss {{on one of the}} goods. Finally, products with lower reservation prices are shown to be more natural candidates for loss-leader pricing. Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press. ...|$|R
