40|$|The {{presented}} article {{deals with}} the effects of equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) with a newly adjusted die geometry on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the Al–Si–Mn–Fe alloy. This alloy was subjected to two modes of heat treatment followed by the ECAP process, which led to partial back pressure (ECAP-PBP). Ultra-fine grained (UFG) structure formed through ECAP-PBP process has been studied by methods of optical as well as electron microscopy. The obtained results indicate that <b>quenched</b> <b>alloys,</b> in comparison to slowly cooled alloys, do not contain large brittle particles which subsequently initiate a premature creation of cracks. It was shown that the mechanical properties of these alloys after such processing depend first and foremost on the selected type of heat treatment and on the number of performed passes. The maximum of ultimate tensile strength (417 MPa) was obtained for <b>quenched</b> <b>alloy</b> after 3 passes. On the other hand, maximum ductility was found in slowly cooled alloy after second pass. Further passes reduced strength due to the brittle behavior of excluded particles. One of the partial findings is that there is only a small dependency of the resulting size of grains on previously applied thermal processing. The minimum grain sizes were obtained after 3 passages, where their size ranged between 0. 4 and 0. 8 μm. The application of quick cooling after heat processing due to the occurrence of finer precipitates in the matrix seems to produce better results. Web of Science 4421721...|$|R
