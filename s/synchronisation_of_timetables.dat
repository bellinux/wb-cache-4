40|$|We {{consider}} {{a network of}} periodically running railway lines. Investments are possible {{to increase the speed}} and to improve the <b>synchronisation</b> <b>of</b> trains. The model also includes random delays of trains and the propagation of delays across the network. We derive a cost-benefit analysis of investments, where the benefit is measured in reduced waiting time for passengers changing lines. We also estimate the actual mean waiting time simulating the train delays. This allows us to analyse the impact that an increasing <b>synchronisation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>timetable</b> has on its stability. Simulation is based on an analytical model obtained from queueing theory. We use sophisticated adaptive evolutionary algorithms, which send o# avant-garde solutions {{from time to time to}} speed up the optimisation process. As there is a high correlation between scheduled and estimated waiting times for badly synchronised timetables, we are even able to include the time consuming simulation into our optimisation runs...|$|R

The technique is feasible without communication between nodes and entirely relies on the receiver feedback. It is practical for an arbitrary number of received signals and transmitter nodes. The superimposed received signal has its maximum constructive interference focused on an arbitrary location of a remote receiver. In both, analytic considerations and in a simulation environment we demonstrate that <b>synchronisation</b> <b>of</b> several hundred received signals is possible within milliseconds...|$|R

The theoretical framework for our investigations is based on the study of reconfiguration graphs, which model the search space <b>of</b> <b>timetabling</b> problems. We contribute to this framework by including timeslot availability requirements in the analysis and we derive improved conditions for the connectedness <b>of</b> clash-free <b>timetables</b> in this setting.
