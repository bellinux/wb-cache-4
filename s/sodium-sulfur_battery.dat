5000|$|The <b>sodium-sulfur</b> <b>battery</b> (NaS battery), {{along with}} the related lithium-sulfur battery employs cheap and {{abundant}} electrode materials. It was the first alkali-metal commercial battery. It used liquid sulfur for the positive electrode and a ceramic tube of beta-alumina solid electrolyte (BASE) for the electrolyte.

50|$|Sumitomo {{developed}} a battery using a salt that is molten at 61 C, far lower than sodium based batteries, and operational at 90 C. It offers energy densities {{as high as}} 290 Wh/L and 224 Wh/kg and charge/discharge rates of 1C with a lifetime of 100 - 1000 charge cycles. The battery employs only nonflammable materials and neither ignites on contact with air nor risks thermal runaway. This eliminates waste-heat storage or fire- and explosion-proof equipment, and allows closer cell packing.

Compared with the Ni-H 2 or Ni-Co battery systems, Na-S batteries offer a mass reduction by a factor of 2 to 4, representing significant launch cost savings or increased payload mass capabilities. The Na-S battery operates at between 300 and 400 C, using liquid sodium and sulfur/polysulfide electrodes and solid ceramic electrolyte; the transport of the electrode materials to the surface of the electrolyte is through wicking/capillary forces.

5000|$|One {{drawback}} of the <b>sodium-sulfur</b> <b>battery</b> is {{its relatively}} slow discharge rates, which limited {{the amount of}} power that could {{be drawn from the}} battery during acceleration. Drivers described it as [...] "sedate", while Ford estimated its 0-60 mph (0-100 km/h) acceleration at about 16.5 seconds. While slow by car standards, this is similar to other small European delivery vans of the era, like the Volkswagen Eurovan.|$|E

For this, and several other reasons, Ford lost interest in the <b>sodium-sulfur</b> <b>battery</b> and turned to fuel cell concepts instead.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the transient stability enhancement {{of a power}} system containing large amounts of solar and wind generation in Japan. Following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster {{there has been an}} increasing awareness on the importance of a distributed architecture, based mainly on renewable generation, for the Japanese power system. Also, the targets of CO 2 emissions can now be approached without heavily depending on nuclear generation. Large amounts of renewable generation leads to a reduction in the total inertia of the system because renewable generators are connected to the grid by power converters, and transient stability becomes a significant issue. Simulation results show that <b>sodium-sulfur</b> <b>batteries</b> can keep the system in operation and stable after strong transient disturbances, especially for an isolated system. The results also show how the reduction of the inertia in the system can be mitigated by exploiting the kinetic energy of wind turbines...|$|R
