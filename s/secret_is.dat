5|$|Coon {{decides to}} rid the town of Mysterion, enlisting the help of Professor Chaos (Butters) and his sidekick General Disarray (Dougie). Unlike the Coon, Professor Chaos and General Disarray have become as {{familiar}} to the residents of South Park as Mysterion. Butters also wants to know the identity of Mysterion but can only narrow the list of suspects to the boys from Mr. Garrison's 4th grade class whose shapes do not differ greatly from that of others. In contrast, he has nearly pinned down Coon's identity to a few fat celebrities, and Cartman. In a scheme to uncover Mysterion's identity, the Coon convinces Professor Chaos to threaten {{the destruction of a}} hospital unless Mysterion reveals his identity. After the Coon plants the TNT and leaves to buy detonators, Mysterion unexpectedly arrives. He points out that this is not Professor Chaos' usual style, and fights Professor Chaos and General Disarray on top of the building. A crowd forms below and cheers on Mysterion as the police take no actions, believing that their bullets are no match for Professor Chaos' aluminum foil armor. Dramatically, the Coon appears to fight on the side of Mysterion, with the hopes that he too will be hailed as a hero. At that point, Professor Chaos and General Disarray run off in defeat. After their victory, the Coon convinces Mysterion to unmask himself by claiming such threats to public safety will continue until Mysterion's <b>secret</b> <b>is</b> revealed.|$|E

5|$|Using the riddles, Bruce and his butler, Alfred, deduce the Riddler's secret identity. Chase is {{imprisoned by}} The Riddler and Two-Face in their hideout. Dick returns and becomes Batman's sidekick, Robin, after {{realising}} that the Caped Crusader {{could use a}} hand. Batman and Robin head to Riddler and Two-Face's lair, Claw Island, where they are separated. Robin encounters Two-Face and nearly kills him, but realizing {{that he does not}} have it in him to murder, Robin spares him. Two-Face gets the upper hand and captures Robin. Batman arrives at the lair, where Robin and Chase are held as hostages. The Riddler gives Batman a chance to save only one hostage, but Batman destroys the Riddler's brainwave collecting device, causing the Riddler to suffer a mental breakdown. Batman then rescues both Robin and Chase. Two-Face corners the trio and determines their fate with the flip of a coin, but Batman throws a handful of identical coins in the air, causing Two-Face to stumble and fall to his death. The Riddler is taken to Arkham Asylum and imprisoned, but he claims he knows who Batman is. Chase is asked to consult on the case, but Nygma says that he himself is Batman, due to his damaged memories.

25|$|The {{connection}} is private (or secure) because symmetric cryptography {{is used to}} encrypt the data transmitted. The keys for this symmetric encryption are generated uniquely for each connection and {{are based on a}} shared secret negotiated {{at the start of the}} session (see TLS handshake protocol). The server and client negotiate the details of which encryption algorithm and cryptographic keys to use before the first byte of data is transmitted (see Algorithm below). The negotiation of a shared <b>secret</b> <b>is</b> both secure (the negotiated <b>secret</b> <b>is</b> unavailable to eavesdroppers and cannot be obtained, even by an attacker who places themselves in the middle of the connection) and reliable (no attacker can modify the communications during the negotiation without being detected).|$|E

25|$|A trade <b>secret</b> <b>is</b> {{information}} that is intentionally kept confidential and that provides a competitive advantage to its possessor. Trade secrets are protected by non-disclosure agreement and labour law, each of which prevents information leaks such as breaches of confidentiality and industrial espionage. Compared to patents, the advantages of trade secrets are {{that the value of}} a trade secret continues until it is made public, whereas a patent is only in force for a specified time, after which others may freely copy the invention; does not require payment of fees to governmental agencies or filing paperwork; has an immediate effect; and does not require any disclosure of information to the public. The key disadvantage of a trade <b>secret</b> <b>is</b> its vulnerability to reverse engineering.|$|E
5000|$|Just {{like in the}} {{approach}} chosen by the SNMPv3 USM authentication protocol, a challenge-response approach would require shared secrets. If those <b>secrets</b> <b>are</b> cryptographically strong - then both approaches are likely to withstand an attack. And if those <b>secrets</b> <b>are</b> derived from short, guessable, or brute-force-able strings (such as weak passwords), an adversary that monitors the exchange can mount an offline attack and break the security - determine the generating short <b>secret.</b> There <b>is</b> no difference in vulnerability between SNMPv3 USM authentication and a hypothetical challenge-response: when short <b>secrets</b> <b>are</b> used - both can be broken. There are some similarities between challenge-response approaches that use keyed cryptographic one-way functions, and USM authentication protocol.|$|R
