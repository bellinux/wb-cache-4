For testing the scheme, we apply it to the Lunar Prospector magnetometer data in the region centered at the Reiner Gamma magnetic anomaly. The magnetic field map at an altitude of 20 km is stably drawn from datasets for different altitudes (18 km and 34 km). The ABIC minimizing criterion successfully controls the smoothness due to the numerical damping and extracts as much information as possible from the given data. This scheme will help produce a coherent lunar magnetic anomaly map by integrating the observations from various altitudes of the SELENE and previous missions.|$|E
40|$|In the past, forward-adjoint {{coupling}} {{procedures in}} air-over-ground geometry have typically involved forward fluences arising {{from a point}} source a great distance from a target or vehicle system. Various processing codes were used to create localized forward fluence files {{that could be used}} to couple with the MASH-MORSE adjoint leakages. In recent years, radiation plumes that result from reactor accidents or similar incidents have been modeled by others, and the source space and energy distributions as a function of time have been calculated. Additionally, with the point kernel method, they were able to calculate in relatively quick fashion free-field radiation doses for targets moving within the fluence field or for stationary targets within the field, the time dependence for the latter case coming from the changes in position, shape, source strength, and spectra of the plume with time. The work described herein applies the plume source to the MASH-MORSE coupling procedure. The plume source replaces the point source for generating the forward fluences that are folded with MASH-MORSE adjoint leakages. Two types of source calculations are described. The first is a ''rigorous'' calculation using the TORT code and a spatially large air-over-ground geometry. For each time step desired, directional fluences are calculated and are saved over a predetermined region that encompasses a structure within which it is desired to calculate dose rates. Processing codes then create the surface fluences (which may include contributions from radiation sources that deposit on the roof or plateout) that will be coupled with the MASH-MORSE adjoint leakages. Unlike the point kernel calculations of the free-field dose rates, the TORT calculations in practice include the effects of ground scatter on dose rates and directional fluences, although the effects may be underestimated or overestimated because of the use of necessarily coarse mesh and quadrature in order to reduce computational times. The second <b>source</b> <b>calculation</b> uses a point kernel like method to calculate directional fluences at points surrounding user-specified detector and structure locations and folds those fluences with MASH-MORSE adjoint leakages to calculate free-field and shielded fluences and dose rates and the indicated protection factors. Both <b>source</b> <b>calculation</b> methods were tested for determining dose rates at specified locations within a two-story concrete building. For two early time steps, results from the second method are 50 to 60 % higher than those from the first method, but the protection factors differ by only a few percent. This indicates that the free-field and shielded fluence spectra are similar and differ mainly in magnitude. Other comparisons were made, and from the comparisons there was a perceived underprediction by TORT. That underprediction can be attributed to the coarse mesh and quadrature used in the calculations. The second method, while not rigorously correct, requires much less computer time for a reasonably good estimate of the shielded dose rates within a structure...|$|E

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of high-power lithium-ion cells, there are growing demands {{for the safety}} of lithium-ion batteries. Heat generation in the cells {{is one of the key}} aspects responsible for thermal risks. In this study, a one-dimensional, thermal model is developed to calculate heat generation and heat transport mechanisms in the radial coordinate of cylindrical lithium iron phosphate cell. This model is based on an electrochemical multi-scale approach and was implemented in the in-house simulation environment DENIS. The transient, thermal model couples macroscopic phenomena such as heat conduction with processes of microscopic nature, which are responsible for heat production in the cell. Furthermore, the multi-scale model includes charge, mass and energy conservation of the battery. The transport and reaction mechanisms are considered as temperature dependent. Model reduction is modeled with physically-based assumptions that allow to reduce a three-dimensional battery geometry into one-dimensional quasi-homogeneous solid with eective thermal parameters. The key idea of the thermal model is the separation of heat conduction and heat production into two separate scales which eectively couples electrochemistry and thermal management. This methodology allows dierent ne discretizations for thermal conductivity and heat source terms. Results show, that computation time is dramatically saved without signicantly reducing the solution accuracy. Therefore only 5 instead of 72 electrochemical repeat units are required for heat <b>source</b> <b>calculation</b> compared to the experimental cell. By means of the model, the electrochemical and thermal behavior of a lithium-iron-phosphate cell is studied for various C-rates and ambient temperatures. In addition, important information in reference to the time progress of the temperature and the discharge/charge curves are derived from the analysis of local temperature gradients. It was found that the local temperature rise and the irreversible heat production increases with increasing C-rates and decreasing temperature. Inverse behavior applies to low C-rates and high temperatures. In this case the electrochemical reactions and the species transport in the electrolyte are improved and therefore the irreversible and joule heat sources are distinctly lower compared to the reversible thermodynamic heat...|$|E
40|$|Iliamna is an andesitic {{stratovolcano}} of the Aleutian arc {{with regular}} gas and steam emissions and mantled by several large glaciers. Iliamna Volcano exhibits an unusual combination of frequent and large ice-rock avalanches {{in the order}} of 1 × 106 m 3 to 3 × 107 m 3 with recent return periods of 2 – 4 years. We have reconstructed an avalanche event record for the past 45 years that indicates Iliamna avalanches occur at higher frequency at a given magnitude than other mass failures in volcanic and alpine environments. Iliamna Volcano is thus an ideal site to study such mass failures and its relation to volcanic activity. In this study, we present different methods that fit into a concept of (1) long-term monitoring, (2) early warning, and (3) event documentation and analysis of ice-rock avalanches on ice-capped active volcanoes. Long-term monitoring methods include seismic signal analysis, and space-and airborne observations. Landsat and ASTER satellite data was used to study the extent of hydrothermally altered rocks and surface thermal anomalies at the summit region of Iliamna. Subpixel heat <b>source</b> <b>calculation</b> for the summit regions where avalanches initiate yielded temperatures of 307 to 613 K assuming heat source areas of 1000 to 25 m 2, respectively, indicating strong convective heat flux processes. Such heat flow causes ice melting conditions and is thus likely to reduce the strength {{at the base of the}} glacier. We furthermore demonstrate typical seismic records of Iliamna avalanches with rarely observed precursory signals up to two hours prior to failure, and show how such signals could be used for a multi-stage avalanche warning system in the future. For event analysis and documentation, space- and airborne observations and seismic records in combination with SRTM and ASTER derived terrain data allowed us to reconstruct avalanche dynamics and to identify remarkably similar failure and propagation mechanisms of Iliamna avalanches for the past 45 years. Simple avalanche flow modeling was able to reasonably replicate Iliamna avalanches and can thus be applied for hazard assessments. Hazards at Iliamna Volcano are low due to its remote location; however, we emphasize the transfer potential of the methods presented here to other ice-capped volcanoes with much higher hazards such as those in the Cascades or the Andes...|$|E
