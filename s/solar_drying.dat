2500|$|The {{production}} of copra – removing the shell, breaking it up, drying – is usually done where the coconut palms grow. Copra {{can be made}} by smoke drying, sun drying, or kiln drying. Hybrid <b>solar</b> <b>drying</b> system [...] is also used to make drying process runs continuously, therefore it will reduce drying time. In hybrid <b>solar</b> <b>drying</b> system, solar energy is utilized during daylight and energy from burning biomass is used when sunlight is not sufficient or during night. Sun drying requires little more than racks and sufficient sunlight. [...] Halved nuts are drained of water, and left with the meat facing the sky; they can be washed to remove mold-creating contaminants. [...] After two days the meat can be removed from the shell with ease, and the drying process is complete after three to five more days (up to seven in total). [...] Sun drying is often combined with kiln drying, eight hours of exposure to sunlight means the time spent in a kiln can be reduced by a day and the hot air the shells are exposed to in the kiln is more easily able to remove the remaining moisture. [...] This process can also be reversed, partially drying the copra in the kiln and finishing the process with sunlight. [...] There are advantages and disadvantages in both – starting with sun drying requires careful inspection to avoid contamination with mold while starting with kiln-drying can harden the meat and prevent it from drying out completely in the sun. [...] In India, small but whole coconuts can be dried over the course of eight months to a year, and the meat inside removed and sold as a whole ball. [...] Meat prepared in this fashion is sweet, soft, oily and is cream-coloured instead of being white. [...] Coconut meat can be dried using direct heat and smoke from a fire, using simple racks to suspend the coconut over the fire. [...] The smoke residue can help preserve the half-dried meat but the process overall suffers from unpredictable results and the risk of fires.|$|E
