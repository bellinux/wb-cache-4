40|$|This paper analyzes, defines, {{and sizes}} {{cryogenic}} storage thermal control systems {{that meet the}} requirements of future NASA Mars human exploration missions. The design issues of this system include the projection of the existing Multilayer Insulation data base for cryogenic storage to much thicker (10 cm or more) insulation systems, the unknown heat leak from mechanical interfaces, and the thermal and structural performance effects of the large tank sizes required for a Mars mission. Acknowledging these unknown effects, heat loss projections are made based on extrapolation of the existing data base. The results indicate that hydrogen, methane, and oxygen are feasible propellants, and that the best suited thermal control <b>sytems</b> are 'thick' MLI, thermodynamic vent <b>sytems,</b> cryocoolers, and vacuum jackets...|$|R
