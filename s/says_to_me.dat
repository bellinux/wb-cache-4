5|$|She has a {{very good}} voice. She's quite shy about it and won't admit it. Lots of people are {{knocking}} on my door to meet her about everything, movies, what-not. But she's not really interested in any of it. She just wants to go to school. She <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> 'Mum, I just want to be a normal kid. I'm not ready for any of that.' I respect that, and if she ever wants to work with me on any level, I welcome it. But otherwise, I leave her to homework and school.|$|E
500|$|Steiger was so {{devoted to}} his craft that during the 1970s he turned to many foreign productions, {{especially}} in Italy, to obtain the sort of roles he desired, but often clashed with directors over his method acting techniques. In {{one of his last}} interviews, Steiger said: [...] "What is the greatest thing an artist in any profession can give to a person?—that would be a constructive, warm memory. Because that gets into your brain and therefore into your life, so to speak. And that's it, when somebody <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> 'I'll never forget', that's worth more to me than five Academy Awards, I'm in that person's life".|$|E
2500|$|On November 20, 1955, African-American rock 'n' roll {{singer and}} guitarist Bo Diddley {{appeared}} on The Ed Sullivan Show, only to infuriate Sullivan ("I did two songs {{and he got}} mad"). Diddley {{had been asked to}} sing Tennessee Ernie Ford's hit [...] "Sixteen Tons", which he agreed. But when he appeared on stage, he forgot his cue and instead sang his #1 R hit song that bears his name. Diddley later recalls, [...] "Ed Sullivan <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in plain words: 'You are the first black boy—quote—that ever double crossed me!' I was ready to fight, because I was a little young dude off the streets of Chicago, an' him callin' me 'black' in them days was as bad as sayin' 'nigger'. My manager <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> 'That's Mr. Sullivan!' I said: 'I don’t give a shit about Mr. Sullivan, e don't talk to me like that!' An' so he told me, he says, 'I'll see that you never work no more in show business. You'll never get another TV show in your life!'" [...] Indeed, Diddley seems to have been banned from further appearances, as [...] "the guitarist never did appear on The Ed Sullivan Show again." ...|$|E

2500|$|In May 1947, Wittgenstein {{addressed}} {{a group of}} Oxford philosophers {{for the first time}} at the Jowett Society. The discussion was on the validity of Descartes' Cogito ergo sum where Wittgenstein ignored the question and applied his own philosophical method. Harold Arthur Prichard who attended the event was not pleased with Wittgenstein's methods;Wittgenstein: If a man <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> looking at the sky, ‘I think it will rain, therefore I exist,’ I do not understand him.Prichard: That’s all very fine; what we want to know is: is the cogito valid or not? ...|$|E
2500|$|Stewart aired archive {{footage of}} Cramer admitting to {{the ease of}} {{manipulating}} markets and commented that Cramer's on-air personality lacks honesty: [...] "I understand {{you want to make}} finance entertaining, but it's not a fucking game. And when I watch that, I get, I can't tell you how angry that makes me. Because what it <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> is: you all know. You all know what's going on. You know, you can draw a straight line from those shenanigans to the stuff that was being pulled at Bear, and AIG, and all this derivative market stuff that is this weird Wall Street side bet." [...] Stewart said of Cramer in particular, [...] "I can't reconcile the brilliance and knowledge that you have of the intricacies of the market with the crazy bullshit I see you do every night." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{got it from}} Sherman, who is {{a friend}} of mine down in Mississippi, who had bought it down at a Goodwill store. When we were down there last time he <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> 'I didn't tell you when you bought it off me, but that guitar used to be haunted'. I say, 'What are you talking about, Sherman?'. He says, 'There’s 50 solid {{citizens}} here in Como who'll tell you this guitar is haunted. It's the darnedest thing – we’d leave it over in the potato barn and we'd come back in and it would be moved. You'd put it down somewhere and the next morning you’d come back and it would have moved. When you took that guitar the ghost in the barn left'. He told me this not very long ago and I said to him, 'Sherman! Why didn't you tell me this before?' and he said, 'Well the ghost was gone – I didn't want it around here no more!'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Rick Moranis {{drove me}} out of my mind. There's this whole wave of insult comedy. In the real world, if someone insults you a couple of times, you can smack them. Or punch them. You can't do that on a movie set. And these comedians walk around, and they can say {{whatever}} they want. I'm just not that handy with that. Comedians are a special breed. They can antagonize you and say whatever they... want, and you can't do anything to stop them... He's this weird looking little guy who couldn't get laid in a whore house with a fistful of fifties. He would imitate me. The first thing he <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> is, [...] "Do you just act cool, or are you really cool?" [...] That was the first sentence out of his mouth to me in Joel Silver's office. And I was like, [...] "Oh... {{this is not going to}} go well." [...] But he was one of Joel's dear friends, and he ended up making a bunch of movies for Disney. I just wasn't that sharp. I wasn't ready for that kind of crap.|$|E
