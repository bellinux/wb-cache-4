5|$|As {{a result}} of her {{suffrage}} and publishing work, Gordon was well-known in California political circles, and even received 200 votes for State Senate in 1871. This positioned her, along with fellow suffragette Clara Shortridge Foltz, to manage the lobbying campaign for the Woman Lawyer's Bill, which granted women the right to practice law in California in January 1878. Gordon used her position as a journalist covering the debate to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> lawmakers and lobby the governor for the final signature.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility {{for running}} the {{university}} is held at an executive level by the vice-chancellor, but the council is the only body that can recommend changes to the university's statutes and charter, {{with the exception of}} academic ordinances. These can only be made with the consent of the senate, the chief academic body in the university which also holds responsibility for teaching and learning, examinations and research and enterprise. The chancellor and pro chancellors are nominated by council and appointed formally by court, whose additional powers are now limited to these appointments and a few others, including some lay members of council. Finally, Convocation, the body of all staff, ceremonial officers and graduates of the university, returns 100 members to court and one member to council, but is otherwise principally a forum for discussion and to ensure graduates <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> the university.|$|E
5|$|Shankly {{tried to}} keep busy in {{retirement}} and <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> football. He worked for Radio City 96.7, a Liverpool station on which he presented his own chat show, once interviewing prime minister Harold Wilson, and was a pundit on its football coverage. He briefly took up advisory roles at Wrexham and then at Tranmere Rovers, helping former Liverpool captain Ron Yeats at the latter. In November 1976, the press speculated that Shankly would make a return to management as the successor to Dave Mackay at Derby County, but the position went to Colin Murphy instead. John Toshack recalled that Shankly was a great help {{to him when he}} went into management with Swansea City in 1978. Despite being in his sixties, Shankly kept himself fit and often took part in five-a-side football. If nothing else was available he would join teams of youngsters in kickabouts.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool's first match {{after the}} final was against Arsenal, a match the club needed to win to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> the top four. Two goals from Robin van Persie, after Liverpool had scored {{in the first half}} meant that Liverpool lost 2–1 and were 10 points behind the team in 4th place, which would ensure {{qualification}} for the UEFA Champions League the following season. Liverpool's league form continued to falter {{after the final}}; they won four of their last thirteen matches and ended the season in eighth place. Despite their poor league form, Liverpool reached the final of the FA Cup against Chelsea. But they were unable to win a second trophy and lost 2–1. Cardiff played West Ham United in their first match after the final, which they lost 2–0. Despite the loss, they only needed to win one more in their remaining thirteen matches to finish in 6th place and qualify for the Championship playoffs. They faced third placed West Ham United, in the playoffs, which were contested over two-legs, with one at each team's home ground. Cardiff were unable to secure a second Wembley final, as West Ham United won 5–0 on aggregate.|$|E

25|$|UE’s {{policy on}} {{salaries}} is {{deeply rooted in}} UE’s philosophy of unionism. UE sees unionism as a movement and unions as independent organizations of workers. When union leaders {{live in the same}} income bracket as rank-and-file workers, it helps them to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> the outlook and needs of workers. In UE's view, salaries for union officers and staff that are comparable to those of corporate executives tend to undermine a union’s commitment to its fundamental purpose.|$|E

25|$|Wexford again {{reached the}} Leinster final in the 2011 Leinster Championship. Wexford had an easier {{run to the}} final than in 2008, facing Offaly, Westmeath and Carlow. In the final they faced Dublin again, but ran them much closer. A poor {{performance}} from Dublin's star player Bernard Brogan helped Wexford <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> Dublin throughout the match, but a bizarre own goal meant they ultimately lost by 2–12 to 1–12, to the team that {{went on to win}} the All-Ireland.

25|$|The {{attempt to}} prove that Hitler had a fully {{developed}} psychosis in a clinical sense has only occasionally been made. An example is the book Hitler, Steiner, Schreber (1966) by the Freiburg psychiatrist Wolfgang Treher. Treher explains that both Rudolf Steiner (whose anthroposophy he attributes to mental illness) and Hitler suffered from schizophrenia. He writes that both managed to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> reality because they {{had the opportunity to}} create their own organizations (Steiner: the Anthroposophical Society; Hitler: the NSDAP and its many subdivisions) that they could influence according to their delusions – and therefore avoid the, normally expected, “schizophrenic withdrawal”. Treher finds that Hitler’s megalomania and paranoia are quite striking.|$|E
25|$|A two-year Massey University {{survey of}} 30,000 people, {{published}} in 2003, indicated 50 percent of Māori in Iwi Radio Network broadcast areas listened to an iwi station. The results {{were consistent with}} those of similar surveys by individual stations, and countered the misconception that iwi stations reached small and specific audiences. According to the research, iwi stations were often associated with old music and interviews with elders, but many Māori listeners used it to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> their culture, family history, spirituality and community, and maintain their language skills. Further Auckland University of Technology research in 2009 suggested the potential audience of iwi radio stations would increase due to the growth of New Zealand's Māori and Pacific population.|$|E

He also raised {{a large amount of}} money and worked to avoid the mistakes of ousted Senators Bob Bennett and Richard Lugar by trying to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> his constituents, especially in East Tennessee.

25|$|Following this, No 487 was {{transferred}} to the 2nd TAF on 1 June 1943. It was slowly rebuilt and in August it began to receive Mosquito FB.Mk.VIs to replace its Venturas.

On 31 October 1944 the squadron destroyed the Gestapo headquarters at Aarhus, destroying German intelligence records about Resistance activities. In February 1945, in order to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> the advancing Allied armies, the squadron shifted its base to liberated Europe, moving to Rosières-en-Santerre in France.

He won the Klasika Primavera and the Volta a Catalunya to put those disappointments behind him.

He performed consistently throughout the two early time-trials to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> the leaders before finishing second on Mont Ventoux {{to take the lead in}} the overall classification. Though Cadel Evans repeatedly attacked him in the final days he stayed on his wheel, with the help of compatriot Alberto Contador, to take the yellow jersey. On the back of these successes he appealed his ban by the Italian authorities with the Court of Arbitration for Sport in the hope of racing the tour.|$|E
