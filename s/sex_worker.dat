5|$|There are {{references}} to bikinis in ancient literature as well. Ovid, the writer ranked alongside Virgil and Horace {{as one of}} the three canonical poets of Latin literature, suggests the breastband or long strip of cloth wrapped around the breasts and tucked in the ends, {{is a good place to}} hide love-letters. Martial, a Latin poet from Hispania who published between AD 86 and 103, satirized a female athlete he named Philaenis, who played ball in a bikini-like garb quite bluntly, making her drink, gorge and vomit in abundance and hinting at her lesbianism. In an epigram on Chione, Martial strangely mentions a <b>sex</b> <b>worker</b> who went to the bathhouse in a bikini, while it was more natural to go unclothed. Reportedly Theodora, the 6th century empress of the Byzantine Empire wore a bikini when she appeared as an actress before she captured the heart of emperor Justinian I.|$|E

5000|$|The {{potential}} risks sex work poses to the worker vary greatly {{depending on the}} specific job they occupy.

It was cross-sectional, conducted over a period of six months using fifteen (15) in-depth interviews and four (4) focus group discussions. The respondents were non-randomly recruited through the Embrace Dignity Project, whose activities involved <b>sex</b> <b>workers.</b> The study discovered that condom use was inconsistent as a result of financial incentives, condom breakage, violence, rape and non-payment from clients when insisting on condom use. But some respondents were not using condoms at all. The majority of respondents reported stigmatization and discrimination by community members and the police. Most of the respondents do not go for routine and other medical checks. Some respondents were not satisfied with health care provision due to discrimination by providers and long waiting times. Notwithstanding, respondents reported a long list of health problems including: flu, cough, HIV/AIDS, TB, headache, vaginal discharge, itchy vagina, sleeplessness, high blood pressure, fever, heart problems, diarrhoea, sweating at night, arthritis, diabetes, alcoholic problems, bad breath, sore throat, and mouth rash. Physical and psychological problems were also mentioned. Most respondents rated their health status as bad.
