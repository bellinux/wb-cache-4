40|$|Thin plate weirs {{have been}} widely used for {{measuring}} discharge rate in open channel flow accurately. The flow characteristic over a thin plate weir is completely different between a <b>single</b> <b>V</b> <b>notch</b> weir and double VV notch weir. The continuity of the flow and accuracy of this type of weirs is reported to be poor. As an improvement, a compound weir composed of two triangle parts with a different notch angle and height has been designed. Mathematical method also been proposed to measure the discharge flow rate over the double VV notch compound weir. Height and width of weir plate are the two parameters characterizing discharge rate over the notch weirs. Mathematical calculation and simulation are conducted by measuring the discharge and the height over the weir for variable weir height and width...|$|E
40|$|Laminates {{in which}} high {{strength}} external layers and flaw tolerant internal layers with similar compositions are combined, can provide improved mechanical behaviour {{in relation to}} monolithic materials with the same composition as the layers. The limitation of this design, in which no residual stresses are present, is the difficulty in co-sintering layers with large microstructural differences in the green state. Thiswork describes a newmethod to obtain laminates constituted by layers with large differences in terms of grain size starting from green bodies with similar microstructures. The approach {{is based on the}} effect of small amounts of titania as agents for alumina grain growth enhancement. Starting from fine grained green bodies that combined alumina layers with composite layers made of mixtures of alumina and titania, additional “in situ” formed layers constituted by large (∼= 20 – 30 m) alumina grains were found after sintering contiguous to the composite layers. The thickness of the “in situ” formed layers reached up to 200 m, depending on the thermal treatment (1450 – 1550 ◦C). The fracture behaviour of the laminates and the monoliths was studied, using stable <b>Single</b> Edge <b>V</b> <b>Notched</b> Beam (SEVNB) tests, in terms of work of fracture and the critical stress intensity factor in mode I, KIC. The large grain sized alumina layers reinforced the laminates by crack branching and bridging. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Phase formation, {{microstructural}} {{evolution and}} the mechanical properties of novel multi-component equiatomic AlCoCrFeNi high entropy alloy synthesized by high {{energy ball milling}} followed by spark plasma sintering have been reported here. The microstructure of the mechanically alloyed (MA) powder and sintered samples were studied using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy, whereas the detailed investigation of the mechanical properties of the sintered samples were measured using micro and nano hardness techniques. The fracture toughness measurements were performed by applying <b>single</b> edge <b>V</b> <b>notch</b> beam (SEVNB) technique. The MA powder shows the presence of FCC (tau) and BCC (kappa) solid solution phases. Extended ball milling (up to 60 h) does not change the phases present in MA powder. The sintered pellets show phase-separated microstructure consisting of Al-Ni rich L 1 (2) phase, alpha' and tetragonal Cr-Fe-Co based sigma phase along with Al-Ni-Co-Fe FCC solid solution phase (epsilon) for sample sintered from 973 to 1273 K. The experimental evidences indicate that BCC (kappa) solid solution undergoes eutectoid transformation during sintering leading to the formation of L 1 (2) ordered alpha' and sigma phases, whereas FCC (tau) phase remains unaltered with a slight change in the lattice parameter. The hardness of the sample increases with sintering temperature and a sudden rise in hardness is observed 1173 K. The sample sintered at 1273 K shows the highest hardness of similar to 8 GPa. The elastic modulus mapping clearly indicates the presence of three phases having elastic moduli of about 300, 220 and 160 GPa. The fracture toughness obtained using SEVNB test shows a maximum value of 3. 9 MPa m(1 / 2), which is attributed to the presence of brittle nanosized sigma phase precipitates. It is proposed that significant increase in the fraction of sigma phase precipitates and eutectoid transformation of the tau phase contribute to increase in hardness along with better densification at higher sintering temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: With the {{determination}} of load &mdash; time curve recorded by Amsler/Roell RKP 450 Instrumented Charpy Impact test {{and based on the}} Newton's Second Law, Impact character of a <b>single</b> standard <b>V</b> &mdash; <b>notch</b> specimen of X 70 pipeline steel under the low température- 70 " C was investigated by studying the impact energy distribution. It was revealed that maximum load point (Fm point) was not exact the dynamic crack initiation, which was detected somewhere prior and very close to Fm point by using Compliance Changing Rate method. This fact was also confirmed by Dynamic CTOD method. That is to say, Impact energy related to the Fm point (i. e. Em) consists not only the crack initiation energy Ei, but a small part of crack extension energy as well. Ratio of EJEm was found to be 0. 90 just applicable to the material used here. Dynamic fracture toughness J Jd was then estimated by modified Rice equation. Crack extension behavior and dynamic crack growth resistance curve (J &mdash; Aa) during stable crack propagation period was carefully analyzed by Key Curve method. Finally, method s for evaluating tearing module Toma, and CTOD curve under the impact test were also briefly introduced in the paper...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study, three-point bend impact {{experiments}} on AZ 61 magnesium alloy were conducted using an instrumented impact testing machine by Charpy <b>V</b> <b>notch</b> {{in accordance to}} ASTM E 24. 03. 03. This test method is to determine dynamic fracture toughness at sharp crack for five different thickness of 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 mm. A sharp fatigue pre-crack was initiated and propagated to half of specimen width at a constant crack propagation rate of about 1 x 10 - 8 m/cycle before the specimen was loaded by the impact force until the maximum force is reached and then rapid fracture occurred. The Charpy <b>V</b> <b>notch</b> test was conducted at an impact velocity of 3. 85 m/s. The dynamics fracture toughness at sharp crack was determined from the force-displacement history of the load point obtained from measurements of input and reflected strain profiles on the incident specimen. The dynamic fracture toughness Kd values obtained for different thicknesses showed that Kd value decreased with increasing specimen thickness. Scanning electron microscopy was used to elucidate the micro and macro failure mechanism operation during the dynamic fracture event. In particular two micro-mechanisms of failure were of primary interest: (a) fatigue and rapid fracture surface and (b) the development of shear lips at {{the surface of the}} specimen follow by fracture...|$|R
