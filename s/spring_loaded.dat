25|$|The Desert Eagle uses a gas-operated {{mechanism}} normally {{found in}} rifles, {{as opposed to}} the short recoil or blow-back designs most commonly seen in semi-automatic pistols. When a round is fired, gases are ported out through a small hole in the barrel near the breech. These travel forward through a small tube under the barrel, to a cylinder near the front of the barrel. The slide which acts as the bolt carrier has a small piston on the front that fits into this cylinder. When the gases reach the cylinder they push the piston rearward. The slide rides rearward on two rails {{on either side of the}} barrel, both with action springs around them, with a large pin inside the camming surface in the rear of the bolt that causes the bolt to rotate and unlock. A cylindrical mechanism on the left side of the bolt, called the bolt stabilizer assembly, prevents the bolt from rotating freely as the slide moves, enabling it to align correctly with the barrel again as the slide moves it forward. The <b>spring</b> <b>loaded</b> ejector pin is continually being depressed by the case, until the case is free of the chamber and releases tension from the ejector, causing the case to fly out, becoming released from the extractor claw in the process. The slide reaches its rear-most travel, then rides forward again under tension of the springs around the slide rails, the bottom lug of the bolt pushes a new round into the chamber, then the bolt locks up and the gun can be fired again once the trigger is released.|$|E
500|$|Until the 1970s, when {{submersible}} {{pressure gauges}} on regulators came into common use, diving cylinders often used a mechanical reserve mechanism to indicate to the diver that the cylinder was nearly empty. The gas supply was automatically cut-off by a <b>spring</b> <b>loaded</b> valve when the gas pressure reached the reserve pressure. To release the reserve, the diver pulled {{down on a}} rod that ran {{along the side of}} the cylinder and which activated a lever to open a bypass valve. The diver would then finish the dive before the reserve (typically [...] ) was consumed. On occasion, divers would inadvertently trigger the mechanism while donning gear or performing a movement underwater and, not realizing that the reserve had already been accessed, could find themselves out of air at depth with no warning whatsoever. These valves became known as [...] "J-valves" [...] from being item [...] "J" [...] in one of the first scuba equipment manufacturer catalogs. The standard non-reserve yoke valve at the time was item [...] "K", and is often still referred to as a [...] "K-valve". J-valves are still occasionally used by professional divers in zero visibility, where the submersible pressure gauge (SPG) can not be read. While the recreational diving industry has largely discontinued support and sales of the J-valve, the US Department of Defense, the US Navy, NOAA (the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration) and OSHA (the national Occupational Health and Safety Administration) all still allow or recommend the use of J-valves as an alternative to a bailout cylinder or as an alternative to a submersible pressure gauge. They are generally not available through recreational dive shops, but are still available from some manufacturers. They can be significantly more expensive than K-valves from the same manufacturer.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} method to statically balance a general treestructured,planar revolute-joint linkage <b>loaded</b> with linear <b>springs</b> or {{constant}} forces without using auxiliary links. The balancing methods currently documented in the literature use extra links; some do not apply when there are <b>spring</b> <b>loads</b> and some are restricted to only two-link serial chains. In our method, we suitably combine any non-zero-free-length <b>load</b> <b>spring</b> with another spring to result in an effective zero-free-length <b>spring</b> <b>load.</b> If a link has a single joint (with the parent link), we give a procedure to attach extra zero-free-length springs to it so that forces and moments are balanced for the link. Another consequence of this attachment is that the constraint force of the joint on the parent link becomes equivalent to a zero-free-length <b>spring</b> <b>load.</b> Hence, conceptually,for the parent link, the joint with its child is removed and replaced with the zero-free-length spring. This feature allows recursive application of this procedure from the end-branches of the tree down to the root, satisfying force and moment balance of all the links in the process. Furthermore, this method can easily be extended to the closed-loop revolute-joint linkages, which is also illustrated in the paper...|$|R

40|$|<b>Spring</b> <b>load</b> {{restrictions}} (SLR) impose {{restrictions on}} heavy trucks {{during the spring}} thaw period. Although the policies have been implemented for many years, their economic effects on truckers remain uncertain. This study {{provides an overview of}} practices around the world and sets up a framework to estimate the benefitâ€“cost of the SLR policy. A freight demand model in Minnesota was built to estimate the impacts of SLR on the freight transportation pattern. The model allows various policy scenarios to be tested before being put into practice. A preliminary result of the freight demand model indicates the SLR policy increased truck vehicle kilometers of travel in Lyon County, Minnesota, by about 13 %. <b>Spring</b> <b>load</b> restrictions (SLR) restrict the axle loading of heavy trucks during the spring thaw.

40|$|A linkage of rigid bodies under gravity loads can be statically counter-balanced by add-ing {{compensating}} gravity loads. Similarly, gravity <b>loads</b> or <b>spring</b> <b>loads</b> can be counter-balanced {{by adding}} springs. In the current literature, among the techniques that add springs, some achieve perfect static balance while others achieve only approximate bal-ance. Further, {{all of them}} add auxiliary bodies to the linkage in addition to springs. We present a perfect static balancing technique that adds only springs but not auxiliary bodies, {{in contrast to the}} existing techniques. This technique can counter-balance both gravity <b>loads</b> and <b>spring</b> <b>loads.</b> The technique requires that every joint that connects two bodies in the linkage be either a revolute joint or a spherical joint. Apart from this, the linkage can have any number of bodies connected in any manner. In order to achieve perfect balance, this technique requires that all the <b>spring</b> <b>loads</b> have the feature of zero-free-length, {{as is the case with}} the existing techniques. This requirement is neither impractical nor restrictive since the feature can be practically incorporated into any normal spring either by modifying the spring or by adding another spring in parallel.

Mass and <b>spring</b> <b>loads</b> were moved by hand over a fixed height difference. Kinematic and kinetic quantities were measured between the hand and the load using an instrumented handle. Force was measured using a force transducer module, movement was measured using an accelerometer and rate gyroscope. Under the condition that the human body was actively generating force at the load, while the load was passive, the dynamic characteristics of the load could be estimated. The estimated parameter values were compared to their specified values and appeared to be accurate within 4 % for both mass and <b>spring</b> <b>loads...</b>|$|R
