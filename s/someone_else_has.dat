5|$|Kasim {{enters the}} cave and greedily starts {{collecting}} many treasures. He soon forgets the code word, and is left trapped. The dacoits arrive and kill him for entering their secret cave. Alibaba later visits {{the cave and}} is shocked to see his brother dead; he takes away the corpse. After Kasim's death is announced publicly, Alibaba is declared the new king of Baghdad and everyone rejoices. Meanwhile, the dacoits return to their cave and find that Kasim's corpse is missing. Realising that <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> entered their cave, they start searching for the mystery person.|$|E
5|$|Jerry still {{worries about}} Elaine, but Harold and Manny inform him that <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> bid higher than Elaine {{and will get}} the {{apartment}} unless Elaine is able to pay $5,000. Elaine is very disappointed when she hears the news. However, Kramer convinces Jerry to lend Elaine the money. When Elaine, Jerry and George {{go to a party}} of a friend of Elaine, Elaine asks Jerry if it would be uncomfortable for them to live so close to each other, but Jerry says he does not worry. George's wedding ring plan backfires, as he discovers that wearing the ring is actually causing women who would otherwise date him to reject him. Jerry feels stupid for not telling Elaine the truth, but, the following day, Kramer informs him that he found somebody who is willing to pay $10,000 for the apartment. However, Kramer's friend, a musician, plays loud music all day long, and Jerry regrets not letting Elaine rent the apartment.|$|E
5|$|The current {{champion}} is Princesa Sugehit, who defeated Zeuxis on February 25, 2017 {{to win the}} championship. It is {{her first}} reign with the title, she is the 20th champion since the Mexico City Boxing and Wrestling Commission sanctioned the championship, and the 29th documented champion overall. Martha Villalobos holds {{the record for the}} longest verified individual reign with 1,399 days while Lady Apache's two reigns combine for 1,470 days the longest verified reign of any champion. Due to the undocumented periods prior to 1986 it is possible that <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> actually held the championship longer, but no verification of such a fact has been found. Isabel Romero has held the title three times, the most for any champion, while five women have held the championship twice since it was officially sanctioned in 1986; Lady Apache, La Sirenita, Tiffany, Martha Villalobos and Zuleyma. La Diabólica holds the record for the shortest documented title reign, with 50 days.|$|E
5000|$|He was {{nominated}} for an Ernie Award for saying [...] "I'm not happy about <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>having</b> my credit card details, it's bad enough that my wife has them.".|$|R
5000|$|In Turkey, {{when someone}} hears about a bad {{experience}} <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>had,</b> he/she may gently pull one earlobe, and knock on a wood twice, which means [...] "God save me from that thing." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the fall}} of 2014 Alexander told a public forum that <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> claimed a $9,000 IRS refund in his name, and that the thieves used his {{identity}} to apply for about 20 credit cards.|$|R
25|$|Insurance {{policies}} – Auctions {{are held}} for second-hand endowment policies. The attraction is that <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> already paid substantially {{to set up}} the policy in the first place, and one will be able (with the help of a financial calculator) to calculate its real worth and decide whether it is worth taking on.|$|E
500|$|Berger also {{commented on}} the situation, saying [...] "I no longer {{understand}} anything. Formula One has become a joke." [...] In the lead-up to the San Marino Grand Prix, Schumacher was quoted saying that Berger should [...] "concentrate on racing instead of thinking how he can criticise me. I have never understood how someone can celebrate a victory like that [...] one lap down and winning after <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> been disqualified." [...] Berger responded to Schumacher's comments by saying: ...|$|E
500|$|At one point, The Samuel Goldwyn Company {{was about}} to release A New Generation, but lost the {{distribution}} rights after turning down demands from the producers. Eventually, Nelvana went into negotiations with the Hollywood studio Columbia Pictures, which acquired worldwide theatrical rights in early 1986. [...] This led founder Samuel Goldwyn, Jr. to remark: [...] "The fact that Columbia is distributing the Care Bears sequel {{is typical of the}} greed of the big studios. <b>Someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> to go in and prove something works, then a studio will charge in." [...] By contrast, Goldwyn acquired the rights to the original film after major U.S. studios passed on it; they did not see the financial potential in a movie aimed strictly for children.|$|E

50|$|Mid term, Clark {{signed a}} {{painting}} for a charity-auction that <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> painted.

50|$|There {{were two}} cases of Personation. John Jones of Cazneau-street, who {{intended}} {{to vote for}} Mr. Bingham, discovered {{that he had been}} personated by someone who had voted for James Holme.David Starke of Waterloo-road discovered that <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> voted for Mr. Bingham in his name.|$|R
500|$|Like Ken Tucker, Hanson {{also loved}} how Olivia coped with someone posing as herself, {{saying that it}} made her seem like an [...] "honest, real woman". Despite not {{typically}} liking [...] "monster-of-the-week" [...] episodes, James Poniewozik of Time Magazine thought it [...] "did quite a good job using the case {{to tell the story}} of the tension between Peter and Olivia, and the emotional aftermath of returning to a life <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> borrowed". Rhea Dee of Pinkraygun.com almost entirely focused on Olivia's reactions to being back in the prime universe. Dee praised the realistic tone, writing that normally in other shows she was used to the female character being [...] "annoying" [...] after trauma, but [...] "not once in this episode did I feel like Olivia’s emotions were irrational".|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, they {{trace the}} {{substance}} to Massive Dynamic. Olivia interviews Massive Dynamic executive Nina Sharp (Blair Brown), who tells her the substance {{has been seen}} in an attack before. [...] Walter suspects Roy is psychic and runs tests on him before realizing Roy {{has some kind of}} magnetic compound in his blood. This leads Walter to recall he and his old lab partner William Bell had conducted research on creating a [...] "Ghost Network" [...] to secretly communicate messages from one person to another in an otherwise undetectable frequency range. During this research, Roy was one of his past test subjects. Walter further theorizes that <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> perfected his research, and that Roy is overhearing secret messages from some of the people behind the terrorist attacks. Olivia and Peter (Joshua Jackson) arrive at his old house to find equipment needed to tap into Roy's mind.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the tension}} between them, James leaves {{to go for a}} drive and {{purchase}} a pack of cigarettes for Kristen; before he departs, he starts a fire in the hearth. Shortly after he leaves, Kristen realizes the chimney flue is closed, and attempts to open it; while she does this, smoke emanating from the fire triggers a smoke alarm. Kristen attempts to disarm the smoke alarm when she is startled by another knock at the door; she drops the alarm on the floor and retreats to the bedroom, unnerved. She calls James' cellphone from the landline, but their call is cut short. When she returns to the living room, she sees the smoke alarm now sitting on a chair, and realizes <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> been in the house. When she hears a noise from the backyard, she arms herself with a knife, and opens the curtains to find a man wearing a sack mask, staring at her. Panicked, she stumbles into the hallway, and watches as the front door opens. When she goes to push [...] the door closed, she sees the blonde woman outside, now wearing a doll mask. After locking the door, Kristen hides in the bedroom and hears people outside banging violently against the walls of the house.|$|E
5000|$|Though {{his career}} rapidly expanded, Alcala never used assistants to {{complete}} his work. He said, [...] "I somehow felt that the minute you let <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>have</b> a hand in your work no matter what, it's not you anymore. Its like riding a bicycle built for two." ...|$|R

2500|$|Jealousy is {{different}} from envy and rivalry. [...] Envy occurs when people want something valuable that <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>has.</b> [...] Rivalry occurs when two people are competing for something that neither person has.|$|E
2500|$|Generally speaking, {{all parties}} to a {{contract}} must precisely perform their obligations or there is a breach of contract and, at the least, damages can be claimed. However, as a starting point, to claim that <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> breached their side of a bargain, one must have at least [...] "substantially performed" [...] their own obligations.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to criticism contending René shouldn't expose {{images of a}} vagina to children, he explains that in this context children wouldn't {{even know what it}} is, and, if they did know, it's because <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> already shown them what it is. [...] "If the kid recognizes it as something bad — obscene, disgusting — it's because somebody put this idea into his head already." ...|$|E
50|$|Sometimes {{married people}} don't {{get around to}} getting a divorce for many, many years. That's fine. The only thing a {{separated}} married person can't do that an unmarried person can do is marry again. Separated married people can date <b>someone</b> <b>else,</b> live with <b>someone</b> <b>else,</b> be in an unmarried relationship with <b>someone</b> <b>else,</b> <b>have</b> property in their own name, have bank accounts and credit cards in their own name, and so on.|$|R
50|$|Christine Warren {{was born}} and raised in coastal New England.

2500|$|Survival horror games, such as Five Nights at Freddy's and its sequels, which {{focus more}} on {{immersion}} than skill, are considered tailor-made {{to take advantage of}} Let's Play videos and other live-streaming play, as the games' design is aimed to shock the streaming users, providing humorous reactions such as jump scares that are a source of entertainment for viewers. This also provides a way for people who would not normally play such games for the discomfort of being scared by the game to find enjoyment in watching the reaction <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> while playing it. The developers of both [...] and Outlast stated that Let's Plays of their games helps to make them successful considering that in neither case they had a large promotional budget.|$|E
2500|$|I've {{given up}} {{speaking}} to them. I've said basically everything that possibly {{can be said}} to this bunch. I'm basically leaving it up to them now. They are going to show me if they really want to play for Australia and whether they really want to play under me. I'll find out over the next three games and my decision will be made as to my future as a captain and a player after that... I don't think it's my captaincy... but if we continue to lose, you've just got to start saying: [...] "Right, <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> to come in and see if they can do something different." [...] It just gets as simple as that. That's the way I see it. The fellows are not responding to me and that's that. I'll find out over the next three games if that's the case or not.|$|E
6000|$|Harris {{was silent}} for a while. At last he put his {{cigarette}} out and turned toward the youth. [...] "All right, let's say you give up your job and sit in the sun. Well, what happens, then? <b>Someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> to do the job instead of you. Isn't that true? The job has to be done, your job has to be done. And if you don't do it <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> to." ...|$|E
5000|$|Akpan {{was charged}} with {{misconduct}} by the Football Association in November 2011, after homophobic comments were posted on his Twitter account.

60|$|Now <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> {{heard of}} Mrs. Redwing's dear little {{nest in the}} bulrushes, and he had started out bright and early that morning {{to try and find}} it, for he wanted to steal the little {{speckled}} eggs just because they were pretty.

50|$|Melinia is a genus {{of plants}} in the family Apocynaceae, first {{described}} as a genus in 1835. It was initially given the name Brachylepis, but {{this turned out to}} be an illegitimate homonym, meaning that <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> already used the name for a different plant. Melinia is native to South America.|$|R
50|$|Michael's Words: In a {{confession}} aired {{during the final}} computer test, Michael described his disdain for eliminations {{not in terms of}} fear of being eliminated, but only in terms of dreading watching <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>have</b> to leave.
