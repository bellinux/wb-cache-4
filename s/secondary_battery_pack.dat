40|$|Abstract. Power <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> under high-rate {{discharge}} conditions produces thermal aggregation phenomena. Generated heat during charging and discharging that distributes in <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> affects performance of battery {{and so that}} shortens its life. So the <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> thermal management is necessary to electric vehicles. In this paper, an ideal thermal management solution is put forward with a <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> temperature equilibrium approach and a <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> overall thermal dissipation structure by finite element analysis. Theoretical analysis result shows that the thermal management solution can effectively cool the <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> to the ideal working temperature range 25 ~ 40 oC and improve the <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> temperature uniformity with the maximum temperature difference which is below 5 oC, which enhance the cycle life of power <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> for electric vehicle applications...|$|R

40|$|Power {{sources of}} {{electric}} vehicles (EVs) are integrated {{by hundreds of}} cells connected in series and parallel. Due to slight differences in the manufacturing process and various operating conditions of the individual cell in a <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> in EVs, {{the characteristics of the}} individual cell to cell can be non-uniform in the <b>battery</b> <b>pack,</b> which affects the available capacity and the life of the <b>battery</b> <b>pack.</b> This paper investigates the neural network (NN) based method to sort lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO 4) cells so that the cells can be as consistant as possible before these cells form a <b>battery</b> <b>pack.</b> All cells used in the sorting process are LiFePO 4 Cells.

30|$|The result {{experiments}} reported above {{demonstrate that}} the low-temperature charge-discharge performance of the <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> heated in low temperature is improved significantly, and can be draw by the above experiments on the low-temperature heating. The full energy storage capacity can be achieved. However, the maximum charge-discharge power of the heated <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> heated at − 40  °C cannot be achieved because the heated <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> is always charged or discharged at 1 C constant current. Poor voltage performance evident in Figs.  6 and 8 prevents the use higher constant currents. Therefore, some experiments were performed using pulse charge-discharge of the heated <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> at low temperature. Firstly, the <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> was charged at 1 C/ 3 at room temperature. Secondly, the <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> was placed at − 40  °C for eight hours to reach thermal equilibrium. Thirdly, the <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> was heated for 15 min with 90 W power, and finally the <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> was subjected to charge and discharge pulse currents. The pulses had the minimum discharge current of 17.5 A and maximum discharge current of 280 A and minimum charge current of 17.5 A and maximum charge current of 210 A.

30|$|The {{electric}} vehicles (EVs) are often powered by energy storage {{systems such as}} <b>battery</b> <b>packs,</b> fuel cells, capacitors, super capacitors, and combinations of the above. From the aforementioned energy storage systems, lithium-ion (Li-ion) <b>battery</b> <b>packs</b> are widely employed in EVs mainly because of their light weight, long life, and high energy density traits [2]. In this case, the <b>battery</b> <b>packs</b> are typically created from individual Li-ion cells arranged as series and/or parallel modules. The long-term performance (durability) of the Li-ion <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> is significantly affected by {{the choice of the}} charging strategy. For instance, exceeding the current and voltage constraints of the Li-ion battery cell can cause irreversible damage and capacity loss that would degrade the long-term performance and curtail the effective life of the <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> [3]. Conversely, operating within the current and voltage constraints would enhance the durability and prolong the useful life of the <b>battery</b> <b>pack.</b> This requires monitoring and controlling the <b>battery</b> <b>packs</b> at the cell level. However, most of the existing research on the battery management system (BMS) focuses on system-level or pack-level control and monitor, as in [2], instead of cell level. Thus, it is crucial to investigate and provide efficient techniques and design methodologies, to monitor and control the <b>battery</b> <b>packs</b> at cell levels and to optimize the parameters of the individual cells, in order to enhance the durability and useful life of the <b>battery</b> <b>packs.</b>|$|R

40|$|In this master thesis, a {{comparison}} between two types of <b>battery</b> <b>packs</b> for Electric Vehicles (EVs) is made. Pack 1 is a conventional cells <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> where all the cells are connected in series. Pack 2 is an autonomous cells <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> whose cells are equipped with individual micro DC-DC converters.

The DC-DC converter makes Pack 2 the autonomous cells <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> even though the cells are the same. The DC-DC converter ensures load management on individual cell level.
