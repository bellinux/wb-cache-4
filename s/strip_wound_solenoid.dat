40|$|SMART is a three-axis {{stabilized}} microsatellite aimed mainly at {{remote sensing}} applications in sun-synchronous orbits. This paper investigates {{the possibility of}} using only three magnetic actuators to operate the microsatellite attitude control within the requested accuracy (nadir pointing within 0. 1 °). Microsatellite volume constraints impose the use of magnetic actuators of small size. Considering also electric power constraints, this leads to the necessity of using magnetic-core <b>wound</b> <b>solenoids,</b> which do not guarantee the requested control accuracy due to magnetic moment uncertainty.

40|$|Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) {{systems have}} {{theoretically}} been considered for model applications in a potentially compact and practical form for domestic sustainable power. Using two different models, we have compared {{two different types}} of superconducting solenoids for this purpose. The optimal performance of helically <b>wound</b> <b>solenoids</b> of NbTi (or MgB 2) wires are compared with that of pancake solenoids of the YBCO tape. The maximum energy storage of the coils has been obtained for various parameters and dimensions by optimizing core radius, coil length, and magnetic field strength. Helical solenoids made from NbTi wires are shown to somewhat outperform pancake coils made of YBCO-coated conductors. However, this consideration is, respectively, made at operation temperatures of 4. 2 and 77 K.

50|$|From 1970 a {{group of}} {{students}} at the FVA designed and developed a outer atmosphere sounding rocket using a rocket motor built from paper <b>strips</b> <b>wound</b> on a mould. With assistance from TU München (Munich Technical University) and the Mobile Raketenbasis (MORABA) of the DFVLR, rockets were test fired but with poor results, exploding on the test stand or in mid -air during launch. Tracing the problem to leakage between the paper plies, allowing uneven burning and thus over-pressurisation and explosion, changes were made and the project progressed. To take advantage of the rotation of the earth and increase attainable altitude, it was proposed to fire production rockets from a launch base in Zäire, negotiations were almost complete when the political situation in Zäire forced the abandonment of the project.|$|R
50|$|In the 16th century, the {{evolution}} of the cake family proceeded in three branches. The first branch contains pastries that preserved the image of cake similar to the one mentioned above, with a <b>strip</b> <b>wound</b> on spit in a helical shape. The Szekler-Hungarian kürtőskalács, Skalicky trdelnik (trdelník from Skalica), and the Czech-Moravian trdlo/trdelnice/trdelnik, which is virtually the same as the latter, as well as the kürtősfánk (kürtősh donut) belong to this branch. The second branch has pastries made from batter, namely the Lithuanian raguolis and šakotis, Polish sękacz, the French gateau a la broche, the German Baumkuchen, the Austrian Prügertorte and Prügelkrapfen as well as the Swedish Spettekaka. The third branch is represented by one cake, the Transylvanian-Saxon Baumstriezel, where a continuous dough strip is placed on a spit.|$|R

5000|$|Resistive electromagnet: A <b>solenoid</b> <b>wound</b> from {{copper wire}} is an {{alternative}} to a permanent magnet.

5000|$|The first {{magnetic}} tapes were manufactured by BASF in Germany in 1932. They were designed with iron carbonyl as the magnetic pigment mixed into the cellulose acetate carrier. Production soon moved to iron oxide coated onto cellulose acetate rolls cut into uniform <b>strips</b> <b>wound</b> onto plastic or metal hubs. Recordists began recording sound on magnetic {{media in the}} twenties {{in the form of}} magnetic wire. After World War II, the advantages of tape in terms of sturdiness and the ability to edit by cutting and splicing made tape preferable to wire as the magnetic medium of choice. Tape consists of a coating of a magnetic pigment, typically iron oxide (Fe2O3), on a long strip of polyester (polyethelyne terephthalate) base film. This base film has been used since the mid-sixties as a replacement for acetate bases film that was prone to chemical instability.|$|R

40|$|The axial {{forming process}} is a method of cold metal forming, which {{is used for the}} {{production}} of axially symmetric profiles and retractions at full and hollow components. Furthermore, the method-sided retractions, material accumulations together with external and internal profiles are produced by incremental forming technology. As an example for external teeth, a <b>strip</b> <b>wounded</b> forming cavity (die) with an alternating kinematic is driven through the work piece and thereby generating the teeth. This specific feature of axial forming is realized by an oscillating tool feed movement. There is no material loss, e. g. gearings can be generated in net-shape-quality by forming operations. In consequence of parallel force reduction, it is also possible to handle thin or slim structures and for instance to equip with an internal or external teeth without causing bending or buckling. A special challenge of the simulative illustration of the process is the connection of the recursive tool kinematic with the friction model. Hereby the essential base has been set for the interpretation of the work piece or tool geometry...|$|R
