500|$|Actor Stephen Lang portrayed Pickett in the 1993 film Gettysburg. Billy Campbell portrayed {{him in the}} 2003 prequel Gods and Generals. In a 2003 interview, Lang {{commented that}} [...] "for all of Pickett's flamboyance, there's {{something}} organically sad about him. Have you ever looked {{at any of the}} portraits of him? You can <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes-the sadness. He could be charming, but it was tinged with sadness." ...|$|E
60|$|ROUGH VOICE. [At {{the back}} of the crowd] Look at his white liver. You can <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> face.|$|E
6000|$|... "Miserable ass!" [...] thought Tom, [...] "if he don't see innocence in that man's countenance, he wouldn't <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> own child's." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{might well}} {{say he had}} first <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> sister's face. She had brought him the paper, and was looking for {{something}} he wanted her to read to him, when 'Redclyffe Bay' met her eye, and then came the whole at one delightful glance. He saw the heightened colour, the exquisite smile, the tear-drop on the eyelash.|$|R
6000|$|... "I want to {{know where}} my brother's money is," [...] Barnes declared, {{stepping}} a little forward. [...] "Two thousand a year he had. We've <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> bank-book. Five hundred pounds every quarter day! And we can't find a copper! You were his lawyer, or were going to be. You must have known something about his position." ...|$|R
5|$|The pose of Musidora {{is based}} on that of the Aphrodite of Cnidus and the Venus de' Medici. It is {{possible}} that Etty was also familiar with Thomas Gainsborough's Musidora, which shares similar elements. Gainsborough's Musidora, his only large nude, was never exhibited <b>in</b> <b>his</b> lifetime and remained in private hands until 1847, but Etty was familiar with its then-owner Robert Vernon and may have <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> collection.|$|R
6000|$|There was {{a murmur}} of applause at the conductor's compact reasoning, {{and it gave}} him pleasure--you could <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> face. But the Major was not disturbed. He said: ...|$|E
60|$|Isa. The tempest is risen; I <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> face; he puffs {{and blows}} yonder, as if {{two of the}} winds were {{fighting}} upwards and downwards in his belly.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{mother was}} alarmed {{when she saw}} the dog. 'Surely you're not going to let that brute loose about the house!' she exclaimed. 'He'll kill somebody. I can <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> face.' ...|$|E
6000|$|He dresses {{for going}} out, {{and is in}} the act of going—indeed has left his room, and has met the Minor Canon on the staircase, coming out of his bedroom upon the same story—when he turns back again for his walking-stick, {{thinking}} he will carry it now. Mr. Crisparkle, who has paused on the staircase, <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hand on his immediately reappearing, takes it from him, and asks him with a smile how he chooses a stick? ...|$|R
60|$|Not {{the shadow}} of a doubt crossed my mind of the purpose for which the Count had left the theatre. His escape from us, that evening, was beyond all {{question}} the preliminary only to his escape from London. The mark of the Brotherhood was on his arm--I felt as certain of it as if he had shown me the brand; and the betrayal of the Brotherhood was on <b>his</b> conscience--I had <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> recognition of Pesca.|$|R
6000|$|... "Heaven {{lies about}} {{us in our}} infancy! [...] Shades of the prison-house begin to close [...] Upon the growing Boy, [...] But he beholds the light, and whence it flows, [...] He <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> joy; [...] The Youth, who daily farther from the east [...] Must travel, still is Nature's Priest, [...] And by the vision splendid [...] Is on his way attended; [...] At length the Man {{perceives}} it die away, [...] And fade {{into the light of}} common day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “His {{time has}} come, lad; <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes—when an Indian fixes his eye, {{he means to}} go but to one place; and what the wilful creatures put their minds on, they’re sure to do.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she agreed, [...] "the doctor knows--he must know. I <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> manner {{every time}} he comes to visit me. In his heart," [...] she added, {{dropping}} her voice, [...] "he must know that I am going to die." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mad as a hatter!" [...] shrieked old Mr. McIntyre. [...] "I could <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eye. He spent {{enough on}} this beast to start me in business. Whoever {{heard of such}} a thing? Tell the driver {{to take it to the}} police-station." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} hear this without being sensibly touched with it. I was ashamed that he should show that he had more real affection for the child, though he had never <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life, than I that bore it, for indeed I did not love the child, nor love to see it; and though I had {{provided}} for it, yet I did it by Amy's hand, and had not <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> above twice <b>in</b> four years, being privately resolved that when it grew up {{it should not be}} able to call me mother.|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>see,</b> <b>it's</b> rather <b>in</b> <b>his</b> line," [...] Pamela {{reminded}} him. [...] "He is {{over here}} to superintend the production of munitions from the factories which are working for the British Government." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Aboard o' {{that there}} unfort'nate wessel,' said the Captain, rising from his chair, and {{clenching}} {{his hand with}} prodigious energy and exultation, 'was a lad, a gallant lad--as I've heerd tell--that had loved, {{when he was a}} boy, to read and talk about brave actions in shipwrecks--I've heerd him! I've heerd him!--and he remembered of 'em <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hour of need; for when the stoutest and oldest hands was hove down, he was firm and cheery. It warn't the want of objects to like and love ashore that gave him courage, it was his nat'ral mind. I've <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> face, when he {{was no more than a}} child--ay, many a time!--and when I thought it nothing but his good looks, bless him!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing," [...] said Leland tersely. [...] "Nothing at all, {{except that}} he carries it about with him. You can <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> face. If I had a sister, I should feel tempted to kick a man of that kind for looking at her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, faith, of {{love for}} her. I can <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes, and hear it in his voice; but I am of tougher hide and stiffer clay, and so you see I can't die even if I tried. But I'll obey my betters, and wait." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bah! That {{was just}} {{to show that he}} didn't care what we thought of him, he's that conceited! And it wasn't respectful, {{considering}} one of the directors was there, all dressed up. Don't tell me! You can <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eye, looking you over without blinking and then turning away as if he'd got enough of you. He makes me tired." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, please ma'am, we {{know how}} the bird-cage came there. That farmer's man who called {{on the evening of}} the wedding--he was <b>seen</b> wi' <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hand as he came up the street; and 'tis thoughted that he put it down while he came <b>in</b> with <b>his</b> message, and then went away forgetting where he had left it." ...|$|R
60|$|Divers {{articles}} were traced indubitably to the house-boys, {{each of whom}} steadfastly proclaimed his own innocence and cast doubts on his fellows. The boy with the billiard ball {{said that he had}} never <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life before, and hazarded the suggestion that it had got into his box through some mysterious and occultly evil agency. So {{far as he was concerned}} it might have dropped down from heaven for all he knew how it got there. To the cooks and boats'-crews of every vessel that had dropped anchor off Berande in the past several years were ascribed the arrival of scores of the stolen articles and of the major portion of the ammunition. There was no tracing the truth <b>in</b> any of <b>it,</b> though it was without doubt that the unidentified weapons and unfamiliar cartridges had come ashore off visiting craft.|$|R
6000|$|... "Our {{birth is}} but a sleep and a forgetting: [...] The Soul that rises with us, our life's Star, [...] Hath had {{elsewhere}} its setting, [...] And cometh from afar. [...] Not in entire forgetfulness, [...] And not in utter nakedness, [...] But trailing clouds of glory do we come [...] From God, who is our home: [...] Heaven lies about us in our infancy! [...] Shades of the prison-house begin to close [...] Upon the growing Boy; [...] But He beholds the light, and whence it flows, [...] He <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> joy! [...] The Youth who daily further from the East [...] Must travel, still is Nature's Priest, [...] And by the vision splendid [...] Is on his way attended; [...] At length the Man perceives it die away, [...] And fade {{into the light of}} common day." ...|$|R
60|$|Tarzan smiled. Even {{here was}} the racial {{distinction}} between white man and black man--Ho-don and Waz-don. Not even {{the fact that they}} appeared to be equals in the matter of intelligence made any difference--one was white and one was black, and {{it was easy to see}} that the white considered himself superior to the other--one could <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> quiet smile.|$|E
6000|$|The thrush was brought, and the {{two birds}} poured out their marvels of song together. The king wavered, then his {{inclination}} began to settle and strengthen--one could <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> countenance. Hope budded {{in the hearts of}} the old ministers, their pulses began to beat quicker, the scepter began to rise slowly, when: There was a hideous interruption! It was a sound like this--just at the door: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How dost thou {{know that}} I {{am not the}} equal of the Inkosi whom I serve?" [...] he said. [...] "He is of a royal house, no doubt; one can <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> size and by his mien; so, mayhap, am I. At least, I am as great a man. Be my mouth, O Macumazahn, and say my words to the Inkoos Incubu, my master, for I would speak to him and to thee." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He didn't. I got {{him out of}} {{his office}} late at night and crept <b>in</b> for <b>it.</b> I knew where he kept the thing because I'd <b>seen</b> him put <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> safe." ...|$|R
50|$|Many ahadith {{have been}} related {{concerning}} the spiritual {{benefits associated with}} Surat Al-Lail. Muhammad {{is reported to have}} said that the reward of reciting this surah is so much that the one who recites it will be pleased when he <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> Book of Deeds. His inspiration of good deeds (tawfiq) will also increase. If recited 15 times before sleeping, one will dream about what pleases him most. Reciting <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the I’sha salāt, carries the reward of completing a quarter of the Qur'an and is guaranteed that the prayers are accepted. The sixth Shia Imām, Ja’far as-Sādiq (d. 748) has said that the person who recites Sūrah Ash-Shams, Al-Lail, Ad-Dhuha and Al-Inshirah will, on the Day of Judgement, find all creatures of the earth testifying on his behalf and Allah will accept their testimony and give him a place in Jannah (Paradise). Recitation of this sūrah also leads to an increase in sustenance, courage and popularity amongst the people.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Lorry had {{not thought}} of that, and he looked quickly at Carton to <b>see</b> if <b>it</b> were <b>in</b> <b>his</b> mind. <b>It</b> seemed to be; he {{returned}} the look, and evidently understood it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{refuse to}} act as your second if you do," [...] {{answered}} the French gentleman who was assisting us. [...] "The General's son is famous for his skill with the pistol. If you didn't <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> face just now, I did--he means to kill you. Defend your life, sir!" [...] I spoke quite as strongly, to the same purpose, when my turn came. Romayne yielded--he placed himself unreservedly in our hands.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite {{out of the}} question. I'm sure {{he likes}} me. I can <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> face, and hear it in his voice, and am so happy that it is so. But it isn't {{in the way that}} you mean. Heaven knows that I may want a friend some of these days, and I feel that I may trust to him. His {{feelings}} to me will be always those of a brother." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{looked at}} the man clad in mean {{garments}} and foul from his labour in the brickfield, marvelling at his insolence. There was no doubt but that he believed what he said; I could <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> proud eye and bearing. He thought that his tribe was of more import {{in the world than}} our great and ancient nation, and that he, an unknown youth, equalled or surpassed Pharaoh himself. Then, being enraged by these insults, I answered: ...|$|E
60|$|He {{realized}} that Courthorne {{had taken the}} papers, and his face grew anxious as well as grim. The harvest was almost ready now, and a little while would <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in.</b> Then <b>his</b> work would be over, but he had of late felt a growing fear lest something, that would prevent its accomplishment, might happen in the meanwhile. Then almost fiercely he resumed the stripping of the machine.|$|R
60|$|I see myself, very distinctly, lashing {{the tiller}} to iron rings that were screwed in the deck beams, {{and know that}} I did this because I {{was too weak to}} hold it any longer and desired to set it so that the Blanche should {{continue}} to drive straight before the gale. I see myself lying in the deck-house of which I have spoken, while Kari fed me with food and water and sometimes thrust into my mouth little pellets of I knew not what, which he took from the leathern bag he wore about him. I remembered that bag. It had been on his person when I rescued him at the quay, for I had <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> first as he washed himself afterwards, half full of something, and wondered what it contained. Later, I had <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hand again when we left my house after the death of Blanche. I noted that whenever he gave me one of these pellets I seemed to grow strong for a while, and then to fall into sleep, deep and prolonged.|$|R
60|$|However, I {{told him}} the child was taken care of, and that he need not be anxious about it, unless he {{suspected}} that I had less affection for it than he that had never <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life; that he knew what I had promised him to do for it, namely, {{to give it the}} thousand pistoles which I had offered him, and which he had declined; that I assured him I had made my will, and that I had left it £5000, and the interest of it till he should come of age, if I died before that time; that I would still be as good as that to it; but if he had a mind to take it from me into his government, I would not be against it; and to satisfy him that I would perform what I said, I would cause the child to be delivered to him, and the £5000 also for its support, depending upon it that he would show himself a father to it by what I saw of his affection to it now.|$|R
