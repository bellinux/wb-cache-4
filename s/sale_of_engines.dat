50|$|In June 1917, the Provisional Government sent Lomonosov to the U.S. {{diplomatic}} mission, as {{a representative}} of the Ministry of Railways. There he learned about the October Revolution in Russia. In Autumn 1919, he returned to Russia because the Americans decided to suspend their <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> <b>engines</b> to the Soviet Russia. In November 1920, Lomonosov was appointed to the Council of People's Commissars as responsible for rail orders abroad.

2500|$|Following this debacle, disclaimers {{stating that}} [...] "Oldsmobiles are {{equipped}} with engines produced by various GM divisions" [...] were tacked onto advertisements and sales literature; all other GM divisions followed suit.

50|$|Initial {{discussions were}} held with double World Champion Niki Lauda and McLaren {{on the subject}} of a 1980 campaign, but the BMW board denied Neerpasch's request for the programme.

Neerpasch had arranged the <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> Rosche's M12/13 <b>engine</b> to Talbot, but Rosche and Neerpasch's successor, Dieter Stappert, successfully protested to their board that such an undertaking deserved full works commitment, particularly as the fact that M12/13 was derived from a production road car engine meant that potential success could be extremely valuable to BMW from a marketing and <b>sales</b> point <b>of</b> view. BMW thus negotiated an exclusive supply <b>of</b> M12/13 <b>engines</b> to the Brabham team.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{our work}} on a new automatic indexing technique for large one-dimensional (1 D) or time-series data. The principal idea of the proposed time-series data indexing method is to encode the shape of time-series into an alphabet of characters and then to treat them as text. As {{far as we know}} this is a novel approach to 1 D data indexing. In this paper we report our results in using the proposed indexing method for retrieval of real-life time-series data by its content. 1 Introduction Digitized 1 D data, commonly referred to in the literature as time-series data is a sequence of real values and it can represent voice, sensor reading, history of stock prices, etc. Although we propose to investigate indexing of any sequence of real numbers we use time-series to be consistent with the literature. Timeseries data are generated and stored in many applications. Examples include voice, histories of stock prices, histories <b>of</b> product <b>sales,</b> histories <b>of</b> <b>engine</b> testing, sei [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|Corliss kept a {{detailed}} {{record of the}} production, collective horsepower, and <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> his <b>engines</b> up until the patent expired. [...] He did this {{for a number of}} reasons, including tracking those who infringed on the patent rights, maintenance and upgrade details, and especially as data used to extend the patent. With this data, a more clear understanding <b>of</b> the <b>engine’s</b> influence is provided. By 1869, nearly 1200 engines had been sold, totaling 118,500 horsepower. Another estimated 60,000 horsepower was being utilized by engines that were created by manufacturers infringing on Corliss’s patent, bringing the total horsepower to roughly 180,000. This relatively small number <b>of</b> <b>engines</b> produced 15% <b>of</b> the United States’ total 1.2 million horsepower. The mean horsepower for all Corliss engines in 1870 was 100, while the mean for all steam engines (including Corliss engines) was 30. Some very large engines even allowed for applications as large as 1,400 horsepower. Many were convinced <b>of</b> the Corliss <b>engine’s</b> benefits, but adoption was slow due to patent protection. When Corliss was denied a patent extension in 1870, it became a prevalent model for stationary engines in the industrial sector. By the end of the 19th century, the engine was already having a major influence on the manufacturing sector, where it made up only 10% <b>of</b> the sector’s <b>engines,</b> but produced 46% of the horsepower. [...] The engine also became a model of efficiency outside of the textile industry as it was used for pumping the waterways of Pawtucket, Rhode Island in 1878 and by playing an essential role in the expansion of the railroad by allowing for very large-scale operations in rolling mills.Many steam <b>engines</b> <b>of</b> the 19th century have been replaced, destroyed, or repurposed, but the longevity <b>of</b> the Corliss <b>engine</b> is apparent today in select distilleries where they are still used as a power source.|$|R
25|$|In the 1930s Scott {{manufactured}} {{a number}} <b>of</b> stationary <b>engines</b> {{with the aim}} of raising funds following the decline in motorcycle <b>sales.</b> Some <b>of</b> these <b>engines</b> were derived from motorcycle units, for instance the DSE was a watercooled version of the Lightweight Squirrel engine and the SE had the same bore and stroke dimensions as the long stroke Flyers. It has come to light that the SE does not have the same bore size as the Long Stroke Flyer (73mm) but has a bore size of 78mm, this has been confirmed on two Scott SE engines. The PA stationary engine however was different. Designed to meet a Ministry requirement for a portable electrical generator for the Bofors anti-aircraft gun and its Kerrison Predictor, it was produced during the Second World War by both Scott and its former partners Jowett.|$|R
50|$|Buckboard type {{cars were}} also built {{during the same}} period by Buckeye in Cleveland, Ohio (only made in 1901), and by Waltham as the Orient Flyer from about 1903. The Orient Flyer was rear engined with {{friction}} drive. A similar buckboard design was also used by the A.O. Smith Company starting in 1915. Similarly to Shaw, A.O. Smith also motorized bicycles with a device call the Smith Motor Wheel. To increase <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> its bicycle <b>engine</b> the Smith company developed and sold a small buckboard car call the Smith Flyer which was propelled by the motor wheel. Later still, in May 1919, A.O. Smith sold the Motor Wheel rights to the Briggs & Stratton Corporation of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Briggs & Stratton sold the buckboard car as the Briggs & Stratton Flyer.|$|R

25|$|At {{the launch}} of the Ninety Land Rover had insisted that there would not be a 2.5-litre {{development}} <b>of</b> the petrol <b>engine.</b> However, buyer demand and economics made the change inevitable. The larger petrol engine was launched in 1985 (having been developed under the codename 'Project Harrier') and, like its 2.25-litre predecessor it had much in common with the diesel engine. The block was identical, as were most ancillary parts. The key difference was that the petrol engine retained its timing chain, since it lacked the need to drive an injector pump. The cylinder head was adapted to use unleaded fuel. As before, the engine was smooth and refined, and provided the Land Rover with adequate road performance. However, as fuel prices rose and diesel <b>engines</b> improved <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> the petrol <b>engines</b> fell, especially in Europe. It remained a popular option in Africa and other areas where fuel prices or the simplicity <b>of</b> the <b>engine</b> made it an attractive option. It remained available until 1994; although by this time sales had dwindled to almost nothing {{in the face of a}} new generation <b>of</b> refined diesel <b>engines.</b> By this time buyers were limited to those with specific reasons to buy petrol-engined vehicles- for example several police forces in the UK bought fleets of 2.5 petrol Defenders in the mid-1990s because a diesel-engined vehicles would have caused maintenance and logistical problems when operated alongside the fleet of standard patrol cars, all of which were petrol fuelled.|$|R
