We find that with normally distributed sensor noise the non-linear properties of stereo triangulation, either from a motion baseline or from a stereo rig, can lead to statistically biased range estimates. In the static camera case we develop two novel filters to overcome this: a second order Gauss-Newton filter, and an Iterated Sigma Point Kalman filter.

40|$|Abstract — A <b>sliding</b> <b>window</b> <b>filter</b> (SWF) is an {{appealing}} smoothing algorithm for nonlinear estimation {{problems such as}} simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), since it is resource-adaptive by controlling {{the size of the}} sliding window, and can better address the nonlinearity of the problem by relinearizing available measurements. However, due to the marginalization employed to discard old states from the sliding window, the standard SWF has different parameter observability properties from the optimal batch maximum-aposterior (MAP) estimator. Specifically, the nullspace of the Fisher information matrix (or Hessian) has lower dimension than that of the batch MAP estimator. This implies that the standard SWF acquires spurious information, which can lead to inconsistency. To address this problem, we propose an observability-constrained (OC) -SWF where the linearizatio...|$|E

40|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is a prevalent, interferometric, high-resolution {{imaging method}} with broad biomedical applications. Nonetheless, OCT images suffer from an artifact, called speckle which degrades the image quality. Digital filters offer {{an opportunity for}} image improvement in clinical OCT devices where hardware modification to enhance images is expensive. To reduce speckle, {{a wide variety of}} digital filters have been proposed, selecting the most appropriate filter for each OCT image/image set is a challenging decision. To tackle this challenge, we propose an expandable learnable despeckling framework, we called LDF. LDF decides which speckle reduction algorithm is most effective on a given image by learning a figure of merit (FOM) as a single quantitative image assessment measure. The architecture of LDF includes two main parts: (i) an autoencoder neural network, (ii) filter classifier. The autoencoder learns the figure of merit based on the quality assessment measures obtained from the OCT image including. Subsequently, the filter classifier identifies the most efficient filter from the following categories: (a) <b>sliding</b> <b>window</b> <b>filters</b> including median, mean, and symmetric nearest neighborhood, (b) adaptive statistical based filters including Wiener, homomorphic Lee, and Kuwahara, and, (c) edge preserved patch or pixel correlation based filters including non-local mean, total variation, and block matching 3 D filtering.

40|$|This note {{describes}} a <b>Sliding</b> <b>Window</b> <b>Filter</b> {{that is an}} on-line constanttime approximation to the feature-based 6 -degree-of-freedom full Batch Least Squares Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem. We contend that for SLAM to be useful in large environments and over extensive run-times, its computational time complexity must be constant, and its memory requirements should be at most linear. Under this constraint, the “best ” algorithm {{will be the one}} that comes closest to matching the all-time maximum-likelihood estimate of the full SLAM problem, while also maintaining consistency. We start by formulating SLAM as a Batch Least Squares state estimation problem, and then show how to modify the Batch estimator into an approximate Sliding Window Batch/Recursive framework that achieves constant time complexity and linear space complexity. We argue that viewing SLAM from the Sliding Window Least Squares perspective is very useful for understanding the structure of the problem. This perspective is general, capable of subsuming a number of common estimation techniques such as Bundle Adjustment and Extended Kalman Filter SLAM. By tuning the sliding window, the algorithm can scale from exhaustive Batch solutions to fast incremental solutions; if the window encompasses all time, the solution is algebraically equivalent to full SLAM; if only one time step is maintained, the solution is algebraically equivalent to the Extended Kalman Filter SLAM solution. The <b>Sliding</b> <b>Window</b> <b>Filter</b> enables other interesting properties, like continuous sub-mapping, lazy data association, undelayed or delayed landmark initialization, and incremental robust estimation. We test the algorithm in simulations using stereo vision exterioceptive sensors and inertial measurement proprioceptive sensors.

30|$|Filter-based {{approach}} The filter-based approach uses EKF {{to propagate}} and update motion states of visual-inertial sensors. MSCKF in [111] uses an IMU to propagate the motion estimation {{of a vehicle}} and update this motion estimation by observing salient features from a monocular camera. Li and Mourikis [112] improved MSCKF, by proposing a real-time EKF-based VIO algorithm, MSCKF 2.0. This algorithm can achieve consistent estimation by ensuring correct observability properties of its linearized system model and performing online estimation of the camera-to-inertial measurement unit calibration parameters. Li et al. [113], Li and Mourikis [114] implemented real-time motion tracking on a cellphone using inertial sensing and a rolling-shutter camera. MSCKF algorithm is the core algorithm of Google’s Project Tango [URL] Clement et al. [115] compared two modern approaches: MSCKF and <b>sliding</b> <b>window</b> <b>filter</b> (SWF). SWF is more accurate and less sensitive to tuning parameters than MSCKF. However, MSCKF is computationally cheaper, has good consistency, and improves accuracies because more features are tracked. Bloesch et al. [116] presented a monocular visual inertial odometry algorithm by directly using pixel intensity errors of image patches. In this algorithm, by directly using the intensity errors as an innovation term, the tracking of multilevel patch features is closely coupled to the underlying EKF during the update step.|$|E

Also, the results {{presented in this paper}} constitute an improvement over the Gevorkian et al. [9] (GAA) variant of the HGW algorithm. The improvement over the GAA variant is also in the computation model. The GAA algorithm makes the assumption that the input is independently and identically distributed (the i. i. d. assumption), whereas our main result is deterministic. We also deal with the problem of computing the dilation and erosion filters simultaneously, as required, e. g., for computing the unbiased morphological edge. In the case of i. i. d. inputs, we show that this simultaneous computation can be done more efficiently then separately computing each. We then turn to the opening filter, defined as the application of the min filter to the max filter and give {{an efficient}} algorithm for its computation. Specifically, this algorithm is only slightly slower than the computation of just the max filter. The improved algorithms are readily generalized to two dimensions (for a rectangular window), as well as to any higher finite dimension (for a hyperbox window), with the number of comparisons per window remaining constant. For the sake of concreteness, we also make a few comments on implementation considerations in a contemporary programming language.

In particular, {{we are interested in}} improving the range resolution of stereo vision for Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL) missions to Mars and other planetary bodies. The goal is to create accurate and precise 3 D planetary surface structure estimates by filtering sequences of stereo images taken from an autonomous landing vehicle. More generally we are interested in fast, optimal, relative spatial estimation for mobile robots. The SWF is useful in this context because it can scale from the offline, optimal batch least squares solution to fast online incremental solutions. For instance, if the window encompasses all time, the solution is algebraically equivalent to full SLAM; if only one time step is maintained, the solution is algebraically equivalent to the Extended Kalman Filter SLAM solution; if robot poses and environment landmarks are slowly marginalized out over time such that the state vector ceases to grow, then the filter becomes constant time, like Visual Odometry. Further, the sliding window method exhibits other interesting properties, like reversible data association, out-of sequence measurement updates, and robust estimation across multiple timesteps.
