In September the <b>state</b> <b>authorities</b> intervened and some of the landowners were persuaded to capitulate. Elsewhere the strike continued until November 1893.

In Malaysia, the land {{which is to}} be developed into a housing development project may be originally owned by the housing developer; the developer may obtain it through purchase from an interested seller, through a joint venture agreement with the land proprietor, or through alienation of land granted by the <b>state</b> <b>authority.</b> The alienation of land is made based on the approval of the <b>state</b> <b>authority</b> during the application to alienate the land to the applicant housing developers. There have been cases whereby the <b>state</b> <b>authority</b> ha approved the aplications to alienate the land to the applicant housing developers (see my reason above) without duly taking into consideration the capability and suitability of the applicant housing developers. concerned in carrying out the intended housing development project. The incapability includes lack of experience of the applicant housing developers (in housing development projects or lack of funds to run housing development projects. These shortcomings, in the extreme case, may result in the abandonment of housing development projects. The questions that arise include: why had the <b>state</b> <b>authority</b> approved the applications to alienate land to incapable housing developers? What are the power, responsibility and liability of the <b>state</b> <b>authority</b> in alienating land to applicant housing developers for housing development projects?

Their attempts to escape were often triggered by specific events such as a wish to avoid conscription, repression by the authorities or the refusal of a request to emigrate. Many escapees had previously clashed with the <b>state</b> <b>authorities</b> and had been imprisoned for political offenses, often related to earlier unsuccessful escape attempts.|$|E

Once this process was completed the rubber tax was abolished. The Abir company merged with the Société Anversoise in May 1911 to form the Compagnie du Congo Belge and now focussed on the management of rubber plantations and the gathering of rubber from them. However, later that year it agreed with the Belgian government {{to reduce the size}} of its operations and its monopoly status. In July 1911 it was banned from collecting rubber within the confines of its old concession for 18 months and was subject to new laws introduced by the Free State. The later history of the company is unknown but it continued to operate until at least 1926 when it split off its oil palm concessions into the Maringa company.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Giri was {{classified}} a very severe cyclonic storm, warnings were issued for the coastline of Myanmar. Relative to the storm's intensity, preparations were minimal; however, {{this was because}} forecasters did not anticipate Giri to strengthen {{as quickly as it}} did. The greatest fear of the residents was the aftermath of the storm. There were concerns that the cyclone could cause devastation similar to that of Cyclone Nargis in May 2008 which killed an estimated 140,000 people in the Irrawaddy Delta. The chief of the Myanmar Climate Change Watch, a branch within the Myanmar Meteorology and Hydrology Department, urged people to move to higher grounds and into sturdy buildings as a storm surge up to 3.6m (12ft) was anticipated. Warnings of the storm were constantly broadcast through television, radio and newspapers. In Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine <b>State,</b> <b>authorities</b> used loudspeakers to warn residents about Cyclone Giri. According to the military junta, an estimated 53,000 are believed to have evacuated Kyaukphyu before the arrival of the storm.|$|E
5|$|The Age of Discovery {{beginning}} in the 15th century saw the expansion of Western Europe's political and cultural influence worldwide. Because of the prominent role the strongly Catholic nations of Spain and Portugal played in Western Colonialism, Catholicism was spread to the Americas, Asia and Oceania by explorers, conquistadors, and missionaries, {{as well as by}} the transformation of societies through the socio-political mechanisms of colonial rule. Pope Alexander VI had awarded colonial rights over most of the newly discovered lands to Spain and Portugal and the ensuing patronato system allowed <b>state</b> <b>authorities,</b> not the Vatican, to control all clerical appointments in the new colonies. In 1521 the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan made the first Catholic converts in the Philippines. Elsewhere, Portuguese missionaries under the Spanish Jesuit Francis Xavier evangelised in India, China, and Japan.|$|E
