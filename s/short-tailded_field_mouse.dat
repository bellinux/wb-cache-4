50|$|The steppe <b>field</b> <b>mouse</b> (Apodemus witherbyi) is {{a species}} of rodent in the family Muridae found in Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Israel, Turkey, Jordan, Iran, Turkmenistan, Pakistan, and {{probably}} Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria. The Mount Hermon <b>field</b> <b>mouse</b> (sometimes recognized as a distinct species: A. hermonensis) and the yellow-breasted <b>field</b> <b>mouse</b> (sometimes recognized as a distinct species: A. fulvipectus) were considered conspecific with the steppe <b>field</b> <b>mouse</b> by Musser and Carleton (2005).|$|R

50|$|Fossils {{of another}} species, {{originally}} identified as Rhagamys minor, and {{dating back to}} the early and middle Pleistocene, are also found on Corsica and Sardinia, but this species has been reallocated to Rhagapodemus. Rhagamys orthodon seems to be most closely related to Rhagapodemus and to the <b>field</b> <b>mice</b> (Apodemus). Its molars {{are similar to those of}} the wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) and the striped <b>field</b> <b>mouse</b> (Apodemus agrarius) but are larger and more derived, being hypsodont teeth suitable for feeding on a coarse, abrasive diet. Over time, Rhagamys orthodon increased in size and became larger than the broad-toothed <b>field</b> <b>mouse</b> (Apodemus mystacinus).|$|R
50|$|The {{wood mouse}} (Apodemus sylvaticus) {{is a common}} murid rodent from Europe and northwestern Africa. It {{is closely related to}} the yellow-necked mouse (Apodemus flavicollis) but differs in that it has no band of yellow fur around the neck, has {{slightly}} smaller ears, and is usually slightly smaller overall: around 90 mm (3.54 in) in length. It is found across most of Europe and is a very common and widespread species, is commensal with people and is sometimes considered a pest. Other common names are long-tailed <b>field</b> <b>mouse,</b> <b>field</b> <b>mouse,</b> common <b>field</b> <b>mouse,</b> and European wood mouse.|$|R

50|$|Large Japanese <b>field</b> <b>mice</b> forage {{primarily}} at night, likely to avoid predation. They {{are known to}} be seed-eating mice, particularly around autumn and winter, as the mice hoard acorns and walnuts, which comprise 13-100% of their food. This makes them effective seed dispersers. Mast seeding can have serious effects on <b>field</b> <b>mouse</b> populations, including increases in overwinter survival, winter reproduction, and population density.|$|R
40|$|Detection of {{non-target species}} during {{distribution}} surveys {{may influence the}} detection of the focal species, due to bait being consumed, or trapping devices inactivated. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of non-target species (<b>field</b> <b>mice,</b> Apodemus sp.) on the detection and occupancy estimates of a target species (the red squirrel, Sciurus vulgaris) during hair-tubes surveys. Following a modelling approach that accounted for imperfect detection of both target and non-target species, we tested the hypothesis that detection probability of the red squirrel is affected by detection of <b>field</b> <b>mice.</b> We also investigated the level of bias that occurred in estimation of key-parameters such as probability of presence and detection probability. Our results show that detection of red squirrels and <b>field</b> <b>mice</b> using hair-tubes surveys is not independent. Detection probability of the red squirrel was higher when <b>field</b> <b>mice</b> did not visit the hair-tubes. Nevertheless, there was no bias in parameter estimates, therefore relatively accurate estimates would have been obtained despite this interference...|$|R
