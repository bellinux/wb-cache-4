25|$|In 2007, several {{automobile}} manufacturers announced that future vehicles will use aspects of hybrid electric technology {{to reduce fuel consumption}} {{without the use}} of the hybrid drivetrain. Regenerative braking can be used to recapture energy and stored to power electrical accessories, such as air conditioning. Shutting down the engine at idle {{can also be used to}} reduce fuel consumption and reduce emissions without the addition of a hybrid drivetrain. In both cases, some of the advantages of hybrid electric technology are gained while additional cost and weight may be limited to the addition of larger batteries and <b>starter</b> <b>motors.</b> There is no standard terminology for such vehicles, although they may be termed mild hybrids.|$|E

50|$|The <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> is a series, compound, or {{permanent}} magnet type electric motor with a solenoid and solenoid operated switch mounted on it. When low-current {{power from the}} starting battery {{is applied to the}} starter solenoid, usually through a key-operated switch, the solenoid closes high-current contacts for the <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> and it starts to run. Once the engine starts, the key-operated switch is opened and the solenoid opens the contacts to the <b>starter</b> <b>motor.</b>|$|R
50|$|Start - The {{pinion gear}} on the <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> is engaged with the {{flywheel}} and the <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> runs {{to turn the}} engine over. In most cases, only the left magneto is active (the right p-lead is grounded) due to timing differences between the magnetos at low RPMs.|$|R

50|$|Early KB Centuras also {{experienced}} quality issues with interior fixtures, with door trims cracking, and torn vinyl trim near stitching lines not uncommon. A story going around {{is that no}} Centura models were fitted with <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> relays, which simply put the load onto the ignition switch when cranking instead, which reduced the ignition switch life in some cars.The <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> relay {{is attached to the}} firewall above the <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> in all models. Traction in wet weather proved to be poor, with an open differential, relatively large six-cylinder Hemi engine and very light weight over the rear wheels.|$|R

5000|$|In 1974, Cleveland-based VLN Corporation was {{merged into}} Sheller-Globe Corporation. VLN's Leece-Neville {{divisions}} supplied heavy-duty alternators, <b>starter</b> <b>motors,</b> and fractional horse power motors for automotive and industrial customers.|$|E
50|$|Each main {{generator}} powered two traction motors. Unlike No. 18000, {{there was no}} auxiliary diesel engine and the turbine was started by battery power, using the {{main generator}}s as <b>starter</b> <b>motors.</b>|$|E
50|$|Aircraft {{began to}} be {{equipped}} with electrical systems around 1930, powered by a battery and small wind-driven generator. The systems were initially not powerful enough to drive <b>starter</b> <b>motors.</b> Introduction of engine-driven generators solved the problem.|$|E

50|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines produce {{a lot of}} heat during their combustion cycle. This can have a negative effect when it reaches various heat-sensitive components such as sensors, batteries and <b>starter</b> <b>motors.</b> As a result, thermal insulation is necessary to prevent the heat from the exhaust reaching these components.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{rotating}} {{machines with}} commutators almost exclusively use carbon brushes, {{which may have}} copper powder mixed in to improve conductivity. Metallic copper brushes {{can be found in}} toy or very small motors, such as the one illustrated above, and some motors which only operate very intermittently, such as automotive <b>starter</b> <b>motors.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Early {{internal}} combustion engines were started by hand cranking. Various types of <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> were later developed. These included: ...|$|R
50|$|Two {{types of}} {{electrical}} <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> can be used, direct-cranking (to disengage as internal combustion engines) and starter-generator system (permanently engaged).|$|R
50|$|The huffer {{works by}} blowing {{compressed}} air via flexible hose to the aircraft's bleed air system. From there, the air flows via a pilot controlled valve to the engine's <b>starter</b> <b>motor.</b> The <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> converts {{the energy of the}} moving air to rotational torque. The <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> is linked via shaft to the N2 or core of the engine and spins the compressor and first stage turbine. Once there is enough air flowing through the compressor and the combustion chamber to light the engine, fuel in the form of vaporized kerosene starts flowing and an igniter similar to a spark plug ignites the fuel. Then fuel flow is increased to spin the engine up to its normal idle speed, at which point the engine is self-sustaining and no longer needs the support of the starter.|$|R
50|$|The CX {{eventually}} {{acquired a}} reputation for high running costs, which over time cut sales. Ironically, it was the components standard to any automobile (steel, door hinges, <b>starter</b> <b>motors,</b> electrical connections, etc.) that proved troublesome in service, not the advanced components. The quality of construction improved too slowly to eliminate this perception.|$|E
50|$|The 348 {{was fitted}} with dual-computer engine {{management}} using twin Bosch Motronic ECUs, double-redundant anti-lock brakes, and self-diagnosing {{air conditioning and}} heating systems. Late versions (1993 and beyond) have Japanese-made <b>starter</b> <b>motors</b> and Nippondenso power generators to improve reliability, {{as well as the}} battery located within the front left fender for better weight distribution.|$|E
50|$|A Bendix {{drive is}} a type of {{engagement}} mechanism used in <b>starter</b> <b>motors</b> of internal combustion engines. The device allows the pinion gear of the starter motor to engage or disengage the flywheel of the engine automatically when the starter is powered or when the engine fires, respectively. It is named after its inventor, Vincent Hugo Bendix.|$|E
50|$|Mechanical changes {{included}} {{relocation of}} the {{manual transmission shifter}} to the steering column, new ball joints, and a new gear-reduction <b>starter</b> <b>motor.</b>|$|R
50|$|Vehicles with {{a manual}} {{transmission}} {{can often be}} push started when the <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> is not operational, usually due to a low battery.|$|R
50|$|Experimental engines {{have been}} made and tested that have no camshaft, but have full {{electronic}} control of the intake and exhaust valve opening, valve closing and area of the valve opening. Such engines can be started and run without a <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> for certain multi-cylinder engines equipped with precision timed electronic ignition and fuel injection. Such a static-start engine would provide the efficiency and pollution-reduction improvements of a mild hybrid-electric drive, but without the expense and complexity of an oversized <b>starter</b> <b>motor.</b>|$|R
