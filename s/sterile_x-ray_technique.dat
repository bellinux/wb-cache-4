The techniques are capable of in situ investigating chemical speciation, microstructure and mapping of elements in question at the molecular or nanometer scale, and thus provide direct evidence for reaction mechanisms for various environmental processes. In this contribution, the applications of three types of the techniques commonly used {{in the fields of}} environmental research are reviewed, namely X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy and scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM). In particular, the recent advances of the techniques in China are elaborated, and a selection of the applied examples are provided in the field of environmental science. Finally, the perspectives of synchrotron-based <b>X-ray</b> <b>techniques</b> are discussed.

It is a method of choice to characterize the flexible, partially folded and unfolded protein systems. X-ray scattering is the last resort for proteins that cannot be investigated by crystallography or NMR and acts as a complementary technique with different biophysical techniques to answer challenging scientific questions. The marriage of the <b>X-ray</b> scattering <b>technique</b> with the fourth dimension "time" yields structural dynamics and kinetics information for protein motions in hierarchical timescales from picoseconds to days. The arrival of the high-flux X-ray beam at third generation synchrotron sources, exceptional X-ray optics, state-of-the-art detectors, upgradation of X-ray scattering beamlines with microfluidics devices and advanced X-ray scattering data analysis procedures are the important reasons behind the shining years of <b>X-ray</b> scattering <b>technique.</b> The best days of the <b>X-ray</b> scattering <b>technique</b> are on the horizon {{with the advent of}} the nanofocus X-ray scattering beamlines and fourth generation X-ray lightsources, i. e., free electron lasers (XFELs).

Density values and their variation were correlated to the pellets' mechanical properties (mechanical durability and compression resistance).
