The absence of a sewage treatment plant in the city has generated complaints from the population, questioning the responsibility of Sabesp in this problem. Other problematic cases such as water catchment, siltation, and environmental degradation have caused the mayor to consider not renewing the city's contract with the company.

40|$|Land use {{patterns}} {{affect the}} costs of providing public infrastructure and services such as roads, water, <b>sewage,</b> garbage <b>collection,</b> school transport and mail delivery. Various studies show that these costs tend to increase with sprawl (dispersed development outside existing urban boundaries), and can be reduced with Smart Growth (compact, planned development within existing urban boundaries). Smart Growth can save hundreds of dollars annually per capita compared with providing comparable public services to sprawled destinations. Most current development charges, utility fees and taxes fail to accurately reflect these location-related cost differences, representing a subsidy of sprawl. More accurate pricing can result in significantly more efficient land use development patterns, providing overall benefits to consumers. This paper summarizes estimates of Smart Growth savings, and critiques a study by Cox and Utt which claims that such savings are insignificant. That study misrepresents Smart Growth and contains several critical errors. Copyright 200...|$|R

Heavy metal concentrations had an overall tendency to increase downstream. Values within the small reservoir were 50 - 100 % higher than in the feeder stream. Highest values of Pb were observed below the reservoir. SO 4,Cl, Mg, Ca, Na and K had high values during low flow in August-ctober. The low values were independent of high flow. Pb followed an independent pattern. Storm event results showed that the Ca maximum was before the hydrographic peak while Fe, Mn, Pb, In, Co, Ni, Cu and Cd attained their maximum just after the peak. Maximum values were 4 - 10 times background values. Mn, Pb and Fe exceeded EPA recommended standards for drinking water...|$|R
