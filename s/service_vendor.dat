A legal {{dispute between the}} two companies began in 2001 in arbitration court. Before the dispute was resolved, AT Broadband was acquired by Comcast, who wanted to use its own billing and customer <b>service</b> <b>vendor.</b> In October 2002, a judge ruled that CSG owed Comcast a $120 million refund {{and that it had}} to reduce its prices. The two companies disagreed over whether the ruling would allow Comcast to halt their agreement before the end of its term. CSG and Comcast reached new agreements or extensions in March 2004 and in 2008.

5000|$|The {{migration}} of traditional IT, in which IT directly controls IT purchasing, deployment, management, and use, to a cloud computing model holds {{a number of}} challenges. A paper titled [...] "Cloud Migration: A Case Study of Migrating an Enterprise IT System to IaaS," [...] {{by researchers at the}} Cloud Computing Co-laboratory, School of Computer Science, University of St Andrews, raises several socio-technical issues related to the {{migration of}} IT services to the cloud. The researchers state that in-house IT personnel are at risk of becoming dependent upon the cloud <b>service</b> <b>vendor,</b> of which the user organization has no control over. The researchers also note that the user organization could also require more resources to carry out migration to the cloud and overcome the issues that could crop up after migration, such as a lack of in-house knowledge of cloud operations.|$|E
40|$|Quality of Service (QoS) {{management}} {{provides a}} solid ground for integrating services in business processes. For example, reliability, fault tolerance and security are important factors {{to achieve a}} secure and fail safe execution of services. Therefore, quality of service is an essential factor for service discovery. Existing matching algorithms provide the ser-vice consumer a choice of services with the requested QoS followed by negotiation with the <b>service</b> <b>vendor</b> about a service level contract. We introduce a semantic model and framework for service level brokering where service vendors and consumers can spec-ify their interests in service levels. Service level requests are matched against offers to discover the appropriate service. Service integration is done automatically by notifying <b>service</b> <b>vendor</b> and consumer about the integration. A semantic approach supports the system with matchmaking to improve the success of service discovery...|$|E
40|$|In {{the paper}} at hand we analyze the {{capacity}} planning {{problem of a}} <b>service</b> <b>vendor</b> providing a business process characterized by volatile demand to his customers. Thereby, we consider the situation that the <b>service</b> <b>vendor</b> executes certain activities by himself whereas specific parts of the business process are outsourced to external providers. For the outsourced parts, the vendor can choose between different models of capacity supply (MCS) that are offered by external providers differentiating with respect to elasticity of provided capacity and the underlying pricing model. Thereby, {{in addition to the}} two “traditional” MCS dedicated capacity and elastic capacity, recent developments in information technology enable the on-demand use of surplus capacity from an external providers' market. Since an integrated analysis of these three MCS is still missing in common literature, we develop an optimization model allowing for the simultaneous consideration of the three different MCS within an integrated queuing system. By analyzing the optimization model with help of a discrete event simulation, we study the question of how these different MCS may be combined to minimize the total operating costs of the <b>service</b> <b>vendor</b> considering volatile demand. The simulation results show that combining different MCS tends to be favorable in contrast to the stand-alone usage of a certain MCS. In particular, combining the additional option of using surplus capacity with “traditional” MCS promises cost advantages. Our optimization model therewith provides first insights in the potential economic benefits of IT-enabled MCS...|$|E
40|$|Project {{sponsorship}} {{is assumed}} to be {{critical to the success of}} information systems development and implementation. However, there is limited research on the effect of vendor-based sponsorship on the management of information technology (IT) projects. This paper contributes to that emerging body of evidence. Drawing on literature on psychological contract, management control and project sponsorship, the authors propose that vendor-based sponsors influence project performance in two main ways. One is to protect project quality by renegotiating contract with the client; and the other is to resource the project. Based on a survey of senior managers in IT <b>services</b> <b>vendor</b> organisations, it reports that project sponsorship improves the quality, but not the cost or timeliness, of vendor delivery of IT projects. The findings suggest that IT <b>services</b> <b>vendors</b> can improve their project delivery capability by appointing project sponsors...|$|R
