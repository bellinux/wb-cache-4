40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new full-scale (FS) testing apparatus for conducting performance evaluations of FS building envelope systems. The simulator can generate spatially uniform, time-varying pressure conditions associated with Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale Category 5 winds while compensating for large air leakage through the specimen and also operate a high-speed wind tunnel, both with dynamic control. This paper presents system details, operating characteristics, {{and an early}} case study {{on the performance of}} large <b>sectional</b> <b>door</b> systems under wind pressure loading. Failure mechanisms are discussed, and finite element modeling is validated for two specimens. It demonstrates successful dynamic load control for large component and cladding systems, as well as simulation of flows near the building surface. These capabilities serve to complement other FS wind tunnel facilities by offering tools to generate ultimate load conditions on portions of the building. Further, the paper successfully demonstrates the utility of combining physical testing and computational analysis as a matter of routine, which underscores the potential of evolving FS testing to encompass cyber–physical approaches...|$|E

DESIGN [...] Single centre population based cross <b>sectional</b> <b>door</b> to door study. SETTING [...] Ommoord, a suburb of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. SUBJECTS [...] 4971 subjects aged 55 to 94 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Cognitive function as measured by the mini mental state examination. RESULTS [...] The overall participation rate in the study was 80 %. Cognitive test data were available for 90 % of the participants. Increasing age and lower educational level were associated with poorer cognitive function. Previous vascular events, presence of plaques in the carotid arteries, and presence of peripheral arterial atherosclerotic disease were associated with worse cognitive performance independent of the effects of age and education. On average the differences were moderate; however, they reflected the net result of a shift of the total population distribution of cognitive function towards lower values. Thereby, they resulted in a considerable increase in the proportion of subjects with scores indicative of dementia. CONCLUSIONS [...] These findings are compatible with the view that atherosclerotic disease accounts for considerable cognitive impairment in the general population...|$|E

40|$|The present {{research}} {{work has been}} carried out to develop a unified knowledge-based hybrid methodology combining regression-based, lumped parameter and finite element analyses that can be implemented in the initial phase of vehicle design resulting in a superior side crash performance. As a first step, a regression-based model (RBM) is developed between the injury parameter Thoracic Trauma Index (TTI) of the rear SID and characteristic side impact dynamic response variables such as rear door velocity (final) and intrusion supplementing an existing RBM for front TTI prediction. In order to derive the rear TTI RBM, existing public domain vehicle crash test data provided by NHTSA has been used. A computer-based tool with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been developed for obtaining possible solution sets of response variables satisfying the regression relations for both front and rear TTI. As a next step in the formulation of the present hybrid methodology for vehicle side impact safety design, a new Lumped Parameter Model (LPM) representing NHTSA side impact is developed. The LPM developed consists of body sub-systems like B-pillar, front door, rear door and rocker (i. e. sill) on the struck side of the vehicle, MDB, and “rest of the vehicle” as lumped masses along with representative nonlinear springs between them. It has been envisaged that for the initial conceptual design to progress, the targets of dynamic response variables obtained from RBM should yield a set of spring characteristics broadly defining the required vehicle side structure. However, this is an inverse problem of dynamics which would require an inordinate amount of time to be solved iteratively. Hence a knowledge-based approach is adopted here to link the two sets of variables i. e., the dynamic response parameters (such as average door and B-pillar velocities, door intrusion, etc.) and the stiffness and strength characteristics of the springs present in LPM. In effect, this mapping is accomplished {{with the help of an}} artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm (referred to as ANN_RBM_LPM in the current work). To generate the required knowledge database for ANN_RBM_LPM, one thousand cases of LPM chosen with the help of the Latin Hypercube technique are run with varying spring characteristics. The goal of finding the desired design solutions describing vehicle geometry in an efficient manner is accomplished with the help of a second ANN algorithm which links sets of dynamic spring characteristics with sets of <b>sectional</b> properties of <b>doors,</b> B-pillar and rocker (referred as ANN_LPM_FEM in the current work). The implementation of this approach requires creation of a knowledge database containing paired sets of spring characteristics and sectional details just mentioned. The effectiveness of the hybrid methodology comprising both ANN_RBM_LPM and ANN_LPM_FEM is finally illustrated by improving the side impact performance of a Honda Accord finite element model. Thus, the unique knowledge-based hybrid approach developed here can be deployed in real world vehicle safety design for both new and existing vehicles leading to enormous saving of time and costly design iterations...|$|R
40|$| locations. Cottages, farmhouses, {{contemporary}} minimal houses, castles, building lots. It {{was very}} difficult for them, not only to find a fitting building or site, but also to find the style or feel they wanted. Do they want a contemporary house, or an over the top cottage, and where? In the city? In the countryside? Everything was on the table. Eventually an old cottage villa at the coast was found, without delivering lot of architectural input, we felt that the location and feel of this house seemed fitting for them. A long road of pro-bono searching ended. Meanwhile the clients got doubts about working with us, instigated by some acquaintances and family, saying we are to ‘visionary’. So we didn’t hear from them anymore. For six months. Apparently, in those months, they contacted 11 architects for the project. Visited al lot of their projects, made appointments. Oh dear. In the end, after half a year in silence, they called us anyway, saying they want us to do their project. We found the whole process, while somewhat comical, inspiring. House or farm, city or countryside, renovation or newly built, cottage or contemporary, this architect or that architect? This opposition became the core of the design process for us. A printout of the duality and doubts of the clients. The human context. It becomes a fascinating rag doll. The project involves the renovation and restoration of the protected villa, with a focus on strengthening the existing character. The project is actually quite rational. The client absolutely wanted a large basement underneath the house. The house is registered and protected by the city hall, so demolishing it is impossible. A challenge. Building the basement, means that we have to hold up the entire house above the ground floor. So we decided this is a perfect basis for the design. We just cut the entire house under the roof, so the whole ground floor can be glazed. The transparent ground floor sets itself inferior to the villa above, of which the roof sits firmly above the whole. There is an interaction between new and old. A transparent contemporary atmosphere in contrast with the atmosphere of the early 20 th century. All facades remain untouched in its totality and current form. We consider it actually as a useful relic, nestled in a new structure and infrastructure. The house doesn’t really change from the surroundings. It’s only from the inside that the drastic change becomes visible. It is actually a beautiful contrast. The glazed ground floor and the protected cottage above. A good expression of duality we found in the clients. And they will have it all: city and countryside, renovation and newly built, cottage and contemporary, this architect and that architect. 5. 	 Zoning is really important for the typical urban planner in Belgium. We are, on the other hand, in total disagreement with walling off different uses in zones. With this project, called FACTORY ROOF HOUSES, we are hinting towards combining these things. Treating a factory roof, which is otherwise unused (water impermeable) surface, as a building lot for housing can provide a small answer to the ever increasing population pressure. The industrial building itself is a simple rectangular stirdy volume. The roof houses on top are built in a simple way. Basic and affordable timber framed buildings with a spacious outside area. This outdoor space, which is actually an extension of the interior space, offers a very spatial and unique character. Researching and developing genuine possibilities and creating new perspectives in day to day (built) projects is how we like to see sustainability. Perhaps it is not a utopia: Recuperating the gigantic amount of factory roofs as a second level for housing, farming or trading could maybe offer a fresh perspective on how to use our already crammed up landscape. 6. 	 The next project is called AVALON. Avalon is an in the mists hidden island. It houses 40 apartments. The presence of private and public areas was very important and the guiding principle. In terms of sustainability, the lifecycle and the lifespan of the building needs to be optimal. The master plan provides a long-range vision: adaptation, extension and conversion in view of the changing needs or desires (lifestyles) of the users is perfectly possible. This housing block had a very wide footprint, which means that there are always (less valued) north faced apartments and (more valued) south faced ones. We asked ourselves how to resolve this issue, and get direct sunlight in the north faced apartments. Thanks to recesses and cut-outs defined by the azimuth of the sun, natural light enters {{into the heart of the}} building. This ensures thermal gains while the openings and the generous terraces also allow light and sun in the flats. Moreover, they soften the monolithic and massive character of the building and provide a better connection with the smaller scale of the surroundings. Avalon is an ideal holistic community. On the level of urban development and architecture, it is a sustainable building with complete coherence in the social, cultural, agricultural, architectural and urban field. It is a composition of light and darkness, of watching and being watched, of sound and silence, a psychic metabolism. The matrix is based on a necessity that characterizes the naturalness of both the use and the perception of space. Avalon is a sustainable building in a social, ecological, economical and ethical context. 7. 	 The last project I want to show, RAVELIJN, is a competition we won for a city ​​densification in Zoutleeuw, Vlaams Brabant. The assignment is a large park containing a large residential care center, 45 houses, renovation of the old town hall and a youth center, mainly for scouts. The building permit for this project just approved this week actually. It is actually a PPS, public private collaboration. Our clients are thus both the city of Zoutleeuw and partners of Ackermans & Van Haaren. We are somewhat in the middle. Anyway, this was the plan attached to the competition, the RUP zoning. Analysing the site, we really felt that the zone for residential care center was badly located. In the shadows of a large water extraction plant. A permanent twilight zone without any place with direct sunlight. Also, the zone has an important buffer function, it shields the massive water factory. The planned location of the nursing home in this area seems therefore inappropriate. On the other hand the building for the youth center seemed to fit perfectly in this forest area. It is a lot smaller, so the tree area can remain entirely intact, a play forest which is also a green buffer. The original location for the Youth building on the other hand, has a sublime relationship of with the beautiful surroundings with light, visibility, silence and air quality. The nursibg home can have a strong relationship with the housing project there. Think of shared utilities. So we decided to switch these two zones in our proposal. Which is quite risky. But we believe so strongly in this human context, we convinced our partners there was no other way. This is the only good solution. This drastic point of view won us the competition. It opened the eyes of the city department, and actually shut it for the other projects in the competition. The architectural form became unimportant. It shows the importance of human context. The physical context then shaped the architecture into these environments. The youth center becomes a concrete bunker in the middle of the forest. A bunker that is turned towards the inside patio but can be opened or closed entirely to the forest with large <b>sectional</b> garage <b>doors.</b> The houses form a compact group with play streets and south oriented gardens, based on the Vauban shape of the former strongholds. The nursing home is a building under an intensive green roof that forms a raised surface. The building is solid and low. It embraces and protects it’s residents. In the top of the plinth, on the terraces, there is a space for plants or vegetables. This way, the facade is a true interactive green facade, at the same time activating the lives of seniors by letting them take care of the plants. Take care and be cared for. Again it shows that every project we do begins and ends with the human context. Outroductionstatus: publishe...|$|R
