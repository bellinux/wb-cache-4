40|$|Demographic ageing and {{its social}} and {{economic}} implications have increasingly become a key policy issue at both national and international level over the past 20 years. Despite an early emphasis on mature workers employability, {{there is a growing}} awareness about the multidimensional nature of the active ageing issue. In order to thoroughly examine the effectiveness of active ageing policies in Italy, we have identified five different dimensions corresponding to the main policy <b>sphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> (employability, lifelong learning, active citizenship, health and quality of life, and transportation/mobility) and designed an ad hoc integrated evaluation methodology. In the framework of a research project carried out by Fondazione G. Brodolini, the identified integrated methodological approach has been applied to three regional cases: Campania, Liguria and Marche. Main results point to the absence of a comprehensive strategy for ageing people and a fragmentation of policy interventions, a lack of an explicit targeting to over 45 workers and a prevailing focus on non self-sufficient elderly people. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on the {{development}} of visual qualities of children in the early and preschool age. The aim is to analyze current trends and research in the sphere of the early intervention for children with severe visual impairments with a focus on developing their visual qualities. The first three chapters deal with the theoretical knowledge about the development of children at the early and preschool age and the development of children with visual impairments, about the diagnosis of visual impairments at the early age and about the methods of visual training and visual stimulation. The fourth chapter consists of the analysis of current trends and research in the <b>sphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> for visually impaired children at the early and preschool age in selected countries. The analysis is realized by analyzing foreign professional publications, articles and research in journals or websites of the organizations that deal with support and assistance to people, or to children with visual impairments. The analysis shows that the system of the initiation of the early intervention for children with severe visual impairments in those countries is not the same. They differ in the level of provided services. In some states the early intervention is still badly available or expensive. They also differ in [...] ...|$|E

The challenge the high court will the n face will be in establishing limits to the reach of such a power. After underlining the fragile empirical basis of many arguments in favour of a unified federal securities regime, this article describes how the Canadian division of powers has been judicially apprehended in recent years, particularly in commercial and economic matters. It the n discusses how the current understanding of such division of powers constitutes a next to insurmountable obstacle to the preservation of an unassailable provincial <b>sphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> over securities if, indeed, the Supreme Court invokes the federal power over “general regulation of trade” as the basis of a valid federal intervention in that field. Finally, this article examines how a true federal spirit might inspire a less Manichean approach to the regulation of securities. Indeed, if the federal structure of the Canadian state and, paradoxically, the divided nature of our common market, are to be taken seriously into account, the challenge lies in allowing both the central government and the provinces a legitimate and guaranteed space in the regulation of securities...|$|E

40|$|In a {{discussion}} of the landmark study by Joel Feinberg on the harm principle, the essay proposes an overall framework for late-modern criminal punishment, with particular reference to the development of its "personalist" feature (in the light of the Constitution). In this context, it develops a critical analysis of some political philosophy theories, as consequentialism and utilitarianism, in which, like the liberal principle of self-protection, it identifies a fundamental “information constraint”, namely the definition by the same regulatory system of the point from which people might consider themselves arbiters to decide what is good and right for them, and, from then on, the criminal law should be confined to protecting the basic "security" of citizens against possible damage, being debarred from any form of paternalism. Contrary to these views the essay will support a definition of the <b>sphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> of criminal law based on an extended notion of harm, such as also encompassing the impediment to informed choice, that is an adequately informed and "capable" one. Furthermore, it proposes a configuration of the ultima ratio principle (a basic regulatory principle for criminal law) that postulates a giving up of the criminal punishment not only when the personal “rebuke” that it expresses is not strictly necessary for the protection of legal assets, but even when the social disapproval inherent in criminal liability and sanction does not show any reasonable ability to foster, in perspective, informed choices, "capable" and therefor...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} and why food consumption and nutrition became legitimate public policy issues in Mexico between the 1930 s to the 1980 s. In the post-revolutionary era, Mexican public officials began to systematically consider diet a social problem that affected not only individual well-being but could influence the economic development of the nation. This belief resulted {{in the implementation of}} policies with the goal of improving the quality of the Mexican diet. Several government actors participated in formulating and executing food and nutrition policies. Economic authorities, doctors and nutritional experts became convinced that food consumption could be managed, rationalized and perfected to obtain optimal results both in terms of expenses and health benefits. For economic officials, the primary goal of food policies was to maintain the stability of the factors of production, primarily labor costs, to encourage industrialization. Thus, from the early 1930 s, the Mexican government regulated prices and intervened in food markets to control the supply side. Since the 1970 s, government officials also sought to influence the demand side through the behavior of consumers. Diet came to be regarded not only as an object of health intervention and macroeconomic policy, but also as a crucial component of the new consumer culture. The Mexican government also promoted the study of food consumption scientifically, looking for ways to optimize food consumption with low wages. This scientific research done at public hospitals helped solidify diets as a legitimate <b>sphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention.</b> Most doctors and nutritional experts agreed that Mexicans in general were malnourished due to the quality of their diets, which lacked animal proteins. Based on the findings of their studies, which indicated that diets had effects on mental development, these experts insisted that malnourishment was the explanation for the poverty and backwardness of Mexican society. Milk production and distribution is presented as a case study of the multiplicity of processes and actors involved in food consumption and nutrition policies in Mexico. For both doctors and economic planners, it was not enough to recommend increased consumption of animal proteins if these products were not available in the market or were not affordable enough for low income consumers to buy them. Government officials implemented policies to increase the production and consumption of the product. This dissertation traces how the milk sector was transformed and how the interactions between local producers, government agencies and transnational companies shaped an incipient industry {{in the early twentieth century}} into an important economic sector in several regions of Mexico...|$|E

40|$|How can {{environmental}} philosophy {{benefit from}} Friedrich Nietzsche's radical critique of morality? In this paper, {{it is argued}} that Nietzsche's account of nature provides us with a challenging diagnosis of the modern crisis in our relationship with nature. Moreover, his interpretation of wildness can elucidate our concern with the value of wilderness as a place of value beyond the <b>sphere</b> <b>of</b> human <b>intervention.</b> For Nietzsche, wild nature is a realm where moral valuations are out of order. In his work, however, we can discern a paradoxical moral concern with this wildness. Wildness is a critical moral concept that reminds us of the fact that our moral world of human meanings and goals ultimately rests on a much grander, all-encompassing natural world. Nietzsche's concept of wildness acknowledges the value of that which cannot be morally appropriated. Wild nature confronts us with the limits of human valuing. Wildness as a concept thus introduces the 'beyond' of culture into the cultural arena of values...|$|R
40|$|Twenty years post-apartheid South Africa {{continues}} to face unrelentingly {{high levels of}} violence throughout the country. Despite progressive policies influenced by international best practice and the recognition of violence as a complex social problem requiring holistic solutions, the implementation of integrated prevention policy remains weak. Through the employment of a qualitative research approach, this thesis explores the dynamic and complex interrelations between policies and practice that impact on the realisation of broad-based integrated violence prevention in South Africa. In-depth case study research into the institutional structure and implementation methodologies of an internationally supported integrated prevention initiative, the Violence Prevention through Urban Upgrading (VPUU) Programme, provides the basis on which this thesis discusses the contention that institutional misalignment in South Africa hinders the realisation of broad-based implementation of integrated violence and crime prevention. Extending from a research rationale, which suggests that the true value of this kind of internationally supported pilot programme lies in its ability to be transferred and implemented at scale, this thesis draws on the case study experience in order to conceptualise how broadbased programme transfer may be realised. In answering the primary research question what are the main challenges facing the implementation and transferability of the VPUU programme?, this thesis draws together the difficulties being experienced at national policy and local implementation level in order to provide new insights into what programme transfer constitutes in this context. The application of the theoretical framework that seeks to understand the epistemological complexity of the VPUU programme and the delivery <b>of</b> <b>interventions</b> results in an understanding of how the knowledge derived from the case study may contribute to the realisation of mainstreamed programme transfer in the future. Based on the results of the case study, this thesis shows that dealing with complex problems requires the development of institutions and professionals capable of coping with complexity. Furthermore, the research outcomes highlight the prerequisite for institutional alignment towards a common understanding of urban safety and suggest that a shift in mind-set is required {{in the way in which}} urban safety and crime prevention are conceived. It is argued that in order to realise the implementation of integrated prevention, urban safety needs to be seen not as a stand-alone, complementary development issue but rather as a systemic guide with which all sectors and institutions should proactively concern themselves. This kind of systemic integration is likewise argued to be reliant on the establishment of a common vision of what urban safety and prevention constitute. The core contribution of this research lies in the application of a new means of thinking about the complex interrelations associated with integrated prevention, providing in-depth understanding of the dynamics of delivery across the multiple <b>spheres</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention.</b> The identification <b>of</b> robust <b>intervention</b> elements within more manageable problem spaces may aid in enabling various government departments to realise improved efficiency in the allocation of finite resources and capacities so as to contribute more effectively to the realisation of urban safety...|$|R
40|$|Models and {{simulators}} {{have been}} widely used in urban contexts for many decades. The drawback of most current models is that they are normally designed for specific objectives, so the elements considered are limited and they do {{not take into account the}} potential synergies between related systems. The necessity of a framework to model complex smart city systems with a comprehensive smart city model has been remarked by many authors. Therefore, this PhD thesis presents: i) a general conceptual framework for the modelling of energy related activities in smart cities, based on determining the <b>spheres</b> <b>of</b> influence and <b>intervention</b> areas within the city, and on identifying agents and potential synergies among systems, and ii) the development of a holistic energy model of a smart city for the assessment of different courses of action, given its geo-location, regulatory and technical constraints, and current energy markets. This involves the creation of an optimization model that permits the optimal planning and operation of energy resources within the city.

40|$|O trabalho procura {{investigar}} os limites da autonomia privada na estrutura de um direito subjetivo ao próprio corpo e a possibilidade de submeterse a pessoa a um processo de auto-aperfeiçoamento biônico. Parte-se da identificação de uma base teórica adequada à integração do elemento corporal a um conceito normativo de pessoa. A partir daí, identifica-se a proteção à personalidade com a proteção da identidade pessoal, propondo-se um modelo de direito subjetivo ao corpo em analogia com o conceito de soberania. Definida a autonomia em uma perspectiva de cooriginariedade entre autonomia pública e privada, os critérios utilizados para justificar intervenções em seu exercício baseiam-se em duas premissas: i) o ato interventivo restringe-se a situações na quais existem efeitos colaterais do exercício do agir autônomo em outras esferas de soberania ou no espaço relacional e ii) somente se pode intervir através de normas às quais todos poderiam consentir como participantes de um discurso racional. Concluindo-se que não há identidade entre pessoa e a base biológica humana, mesmo que se modifique radicalmente o sujeito, continuará a ser pessoa. Encontrando-se a fusão homem-máquina inserida em sua esfera de soberania, se admite intervenções quando se invade a esfera de soberania de outro agente. Quanto a intervenções fundadas em reflexos sobre o espaço relacional, estas devem se limitar à regulamentação da utilização dos upgrades, buscando-se preservar a autonomia pessoal do agente, bem como a autonomia e outros interesses daqueles não modificados. The aim of {{this study}} is to propose an investigation related to the limits of private autonomy, taking into account the structure of the right to someone’s free use of his(her) own body as well as the possibility of the usage of bionics selfdevelopment of human body. Once a theoretical reference is identified in order to relate the corporal element to a normative concept of person, the protection of one’s personality may be directly referred to the protection of a personal identity. In this vein, a subjective right to one’s own body is proposed in analogy to the concept of sovereignty. Defining the autonomy in accordance with the dialectical relation between private and public autonomy, the criteria used to justify the intervention in the exercise of autonomy are based on two premises: i) the act <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> is restricted to situations in which there are collateral effects of the specific autonomous act in other <b>spheres</b> <b>of</b> sovereignty and in the relational space and ii) it is possible to intervene in any <b>sphere</b> <b>of</b> free will if and only if the norms proposing the intervention can be the product of consensus of all participants in a rational discourse. Asserting that there is no identity at all between a person and the biological status of being human, it is logical to conclude that, even if the self is completely change by any kind of bionics technology, he or she will still remain a person. Even though the fusion of man and machine is within his (her) <b>sphere</b> <b>of</b> sovereignty, normative <b>intervention</b> is permitted in case <b>of</b> invading the <b>sphere</b> <b>of</b> sovereignty of another agent.
