5|$|A <b>stationary</b> {{front is}} a {{non-moving}} boundary between two different air masses, {{neither of which}} {{is strong enough to}} replace the other. They tend to remain in the same area for long periods of time, usually moving in waves. There is normally a broad temperature gradient behind the boundary with more widely spaced isotherms. A wide variety of weather can be found along a <b>stationary</b> front, but usually clouds and prolonged precipitation are found there. <b>Stationary</b> fronts will either dissipate after several days or devolve into shear lines, but can change into a cold or warm front if conditions aloft change causing a driving of one air mass or the other. <b>Stationary</b> fronts are marked on weather maps with alternating red half-circles and blue spikes pointing in opposite directions, indicating no significant movement.|$|E

5|$|Damage {{may occur}} {{directly}} under the site of impact, or it may occur on the side opposite the impact (coup and contrecoup injury, respectively). When a moving object impacts the <b>stationary</b> head, coup injuries are typical, while contrecoup injuries are usually produced when the moving head strikes a <b>stationary</b> object.|$|E
5|$|In 1823 Stephenson and Pease opened Robert Stephenson and Company, a {{locomotive}} works at Forth Street, Newcastle, {{from which the}} following year the S ordered two steam locomotives and two <b>stationary</b> engines. On 16 September 1825, with the <b>stationary</b> engines in place, the first locomotive, Locomotion No. 1, left the works, and the following day it was advertised that the railway would open on 27 September 1825.|$|E
5|$|Many players {{prefer to}} play the Hammond through a {{rotating}} speaker cabinet known, after several name changes, as a Leslie speaker, after its inventor Donald J. Leslie. The Leslie system is an integrated speaker/amplifier combination in which sound is emitted by a rotating horn over a <b>stationary</b> treble compression driver, and a rotating baffle beneath a <b>stationary</b> bass woofer. This creates a characteristic sound because of the constantly changing pitch shifts that result from the Doppler effect created by the moving sound sources.|$|E

5|$|The cyclone {{weakened}} {{while remaining}} nearly <b>stationary,</b> losing {{most of its}} deep convection due to upwelling; this is the process in which a <b>stationary</b> storm causes the water temperatures to decrease by bringing the cooler, deeper waters to the surface. It remained nearly <b>stationary</b> until beginning a steady south-southwestward motion late on February 26, a change due to an approaching mid-level trough to its south. On February 28, convection increased around a rebuilding eyewall as it accelerated southward, though on March 1 the cyclone again weakened as wind shear increased and as water temperatures gradually decreased. Gamede weakened to tropical storm status as its center became exposed from the deep convection, and late on March 1 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. After completing the transition, the storm became nearly <b>stationary</b> for about two days, during which its winds decreased to below gale force. The remnants of Gamede turned westward and persisted until dissipating on March 6.|$|E
5|$|The process {{depends on}} the type of {{broaching}} being performed. Surface broaching is very simple as either the workpiece is moved against a <b>stationary</b> surface broach, or the workpiece is held <b>stationary</b> while the broach is moved against it.|$|E
5|$|When <b>stationary</b> fronts become {{smaller in}} scale, degenerating {{to a narrow}} zone where wind {{direction}} changes over a short distance, they become known as shear lines. If the shear line becomes active with thunderstorms, it may support formation of a tropical storm or a regeneration of the feature back into a <b>stationary</b> front. A shear line is depicted as a line of red dots and dashes.|$|E
5|$|When <b>stationary</b> fronts become {{smaller in}} scale, degenerating {{to a narrow}} zone where wind {{direction}} changes significantly over a relatively short distance, they become known as shearlines. A shearline is depicted as a line of red dots and dashes. <b>Stationary</b> fronts may bring snow or rain {{for a long period}} of time.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 54,800 beds were {{available}} in Palestine and Egypt, including convalescence and clearing hospitals; 22,524 beds were made available in Egypt, and a hospital centre in the Deir el Belah and Gaza region, along with <b>stationary</b> hospitals between Kantara and Ludd, could accommodate another 15,000 casualties. No. 14 Australian General Hospital on the Suez Canal was full of malaria cases from the Jordan Valley with the overflow in the No. 31 British General Hospital at Abbassia, Cairo. The Australian <b>Stationary</b> Hospital at Mosacar only had a few beds available.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 54,800 beds were {{set aside in}} Palestine and Egypt, {{including}} convalescence and clearing hospitals. There were 22,524 hospital beds available in Egypt. A hospital centre in the Deir el Belah and Gaza area along with <b>stationary</b> hospitals between Kantara and Ludd, could accommodate another 15,000 casualties. By August, casualty clearing stations or clearing hospitals were located at Ludd, Jaffa and Jerusalem, supported by medical stores depots at Ludd and Jerusalem. However, the Australian <b>Stationary</b> Hospital at Moascar only had a few beds available.

5|$|An {{electric}} field generally varies in space, and its strength {{at any one}} point {{is defined as the}} force (per unit charge) that would be felt by a <b>stationary,</b> negligible charge if placed at that point. The conceptual charge, termed a 'test charge', must be vanishingly small to prevent its own {{electric field}} disturbing the main field and must also be <b>stationary</b> to prevent the effect of magnetic fields. As the electric field is defined in terms of force, and force is a vector, so it follows that an electric field is also a vector, having both magnitude and direction. Specifically, it is a vector field.|$|E
5|$|By November 30, {{the last}} day of the Atlantic {{hurricane}} season, a <b>stationary</b> front extended across eastern Cuba into the southwestern Caribbean Sea. On December 1, a low pressure area developed within the frontal zone just north of Panama, and an anticyclone aloft produced good outflow over the low-level center. The low remained nearly <b>stationary</b> for the next several days, and it gradually became separated from the <b>stationary</b> front. Convection increased across the area due to moisture from the eastern Pacific Ocean and moderate divergence. Increased wind shear deteriorated the system on December 2, though convection redeveloped as the system started a northeast drift. On December 3 a mid-level circulation developed about 140miles (225km) north of the surface center. Convection increased and became better organized as a weak tropical wave reached the area, and it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Twenty at around 1200UTC on December 4 while located about 345miles (560km) south of Kingston, Jamaica; initially, the depression was forecast to track north-northeastward and pass over western Haiti.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{similarity}} between silica (SiO2) and germanium dioxide (GeO2), the silica <b>stationary</b> phase in some gas chromatography columns can be replaced by GeO2.|$|E

5|$|In 1850 and in 1862, Léon Foucault made {{improved}} determinations of {{the speed}} of light substituting a rotating mirror for Fizeau's toothed wheel. (Figure2) The apparatus involves light from slit S reflecting off a rotating mirror R, forming an image of the slit on the distant <b>stationary</b> mirror M, which is then reflected back to reform an image of the original slit. If mirror R is <b>stationary,</b> then the slit image will reform at S regardless of the mirror's tilt. The situation is different, however, if R is in rapid rotation.|$|E
5|$|London smog {{is caused}} by {{emissions}} (such as sulfur dioxide, smoke, and soot) from <b>stationary</b> industrial sources (typically coal combustion from industrial chimneys) mixing with naturally occurring fog.|$|E
5|$|More complex {{parts are}} formed using more complex moulds. These may have {{sections}} called slides, that {{move into a}} cavity perpendicular to the draw direction, to form overhanging part features. When the mould is opened, the slides are {{pulled away from the}} plastic part by using <b>stationary</b> “angle pins” on the <b>stationary</b> mould half. These pins enter a slot in the slides and cause the slides to move backward when the moving half of the mould opens. The part is then ejected and the mould closes. The closing action of the mould causes the slides to move forward along the angle pins.|$|E

5|$|On 1 October 1831, some wagons {{ran away}} on an {{inclined}} plane, worked by a <b>stationary</b> steam engine, at Avenhambrow. The brakesman jumped off but was run over {{and killed by}} wagons being drawn up the incline on an adjacent line.|$|E
5|$|Providing balance, {{when moving}} or <b>stationary,</b> {{is also a}} central {{function}} of the ear. The ear facilitates two types of balance: static balance, which allows a person to feel the effects of gravity, and dynamic balance, which allows a person to sense acceleration.|$|E
5|$|Riding on a {{treadmill}} is theoretically identical to riding on <b>stationary</b> pavement, and physical testing has confirmed this. Treadmills have been developed specifically for indoor bicycle training. Riding on rollers is still under investigation.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, Denis Sargan and Alok Bhargava {{extended}} {{the results for}} testing if the errors on a regression model follow a Gaussian random walk (i.e., possess a unit root) against the alternative {{that they are a}} <b>stationary</b> first order autoregression.|$|E
5|$|The system {{originated}} {{out of a}} non-tropical cold-core {{upper level}} low that drifted southward into the subtropics. The low interacted with a cold front, {{which resulted in the}} development of a <b>stationary</b> front over the Bahamas on October10. As the cold low drifted southward, a surface low developed on October12. The surface low remained mostly <b>stationary</b> until early on October15 as it merged with the upper-level low and deepened while north of the Bahamas and east of the coast of Florida. Later that day, the system gained enough tropical characteristics and became organized enough to be classified as a subtropical depression. The storm remained <b>stationary</b> over warm water, with sea surface temperatures around , while it continued to gain additional tropical characteristics. Around 0000 UTC on October16, it strengthened into a subtropical storm after satellite classifications showed a stronger storm. Later that day, the cyclone continued to develop as more thunderstorms formed and persisted near the low-level circulation.|$|E
5|$|This angular scaling {{can be seen}} in the apsidal precession, i.e., in {{the gradual}} {{rotation}} of the long axis of the ellipse (Figure3). As noted above, the orbit as a whole rotates with a mean angular speed Ω=(k−1)ω, where ω equals the mean angular speed of the particle about the <b>stationary</b> ellipse. If the particle requires a time T to move from one apse to the other, this implies that, in the same time, the long axis will rotate by an angle β=ΩT=(k−1)ωT=(k−1)×180°. For an inverse-square law such as Newton's law of universal gravitation, where n equals 1, there is no angular scaling (k=1), the apsidal angle α is 180°, and the elliptical orbit is <b>stationary</b> (Ω=β=0).|$|E
25|$|In HPLC {{the sample}} is forced by a liquid at high {{pressure}} (the mobile phase) through a column that is packed with a <b>stationary</b> phase composed of irregularly or spherically shaped particles, a porous monolithic layer, or a porous membrane. HPLC is historically divided into two different sub-classes based on the polarity of the mobile and <b>stationary</b> phases. Methods in which the <b>stationary</b> phase is more polar than the mobile phase (e.g., toluene as the mobile phase, silica as the <b>stationary</b> phase) are termed normal phase liquid chromatography (NPLC) and the opposite (e.g., water-methanol mixture as the mobile phase and C18 (octadecylsilyl) as the <b>stationary</b> phase) is termed reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC).|$|E

25|$|Chromatography is a {{physical}} method of separation that distributes components to separate between two phases, one <b>stationary</b> (<b>stationary</b> phase), the other (the mobile phase) moving in a definite direction.|$|E
25|$|A more {{straightforward}} way {{of determining}} {{the nature of a}} <b>stationary</b> point is by examining the function values between the <b>stationary</b> points (if the function is defined and continuous between them).|$|E
25|$|A {{standing}} handspring is {{one that}} begins from a <b>stationary</b> standing position. For example, a back handspring that begins with the performer in a <b>stationary</b> standing position is a standing back handspring.|$|E
25|$|The {{mixture is}} {{dissolved}} in a fluid called the mobile phase, which carries {{it through a}} structure holding another material called the <b>stationary</b> phase. The various constituents of the mixture travel at different speeds, causing them to separate. The separation is based on differential partitioning between the mobile and <b>stationary</b> phases. Subtle differences in a compound's partition coefficient result in differential retention on the <b>stationary</b> phase and thus affect the separation.|$|E
25|$|The <b>stationary</b> equation, {{which can}} be {{obtained}} in the usual manner via a separation of variables, possesses an infinite family of normalisable solutions of which only the <b>stationary</b> ground state is stable.|$|E
25|$|S.F.3 Firms {{are highly}} {{heterogeneous}} {{in terms of}} sizes, productivities, and profitabilities.
