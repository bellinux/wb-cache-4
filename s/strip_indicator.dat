One of qualititative method that is easy, efficient and simple testing is an indicator <b>strip.</b> <b>Indicator</b> strip based Polystyrene (PS) and Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) was made for the examination of diclofenac sodium that were misused as a drug chemical compound in traditional pain relief herbal medicine. Strip indikator was made by reagent blending method with specific reagents used, namely, copper sulphate (CuSO 4), ferric chloride (FeCl 3) and vanillin sulphate. The working principle of the indicator strip in detecting the presence of diclofenac sodium in herbal medicine is with the occurrence of a color reaction. The concentration of PS and PMMA was made in a variation of 5 %, 7. 5 % and 10 %, and the mixture of PS: PMMA 1 : 5 and 1 : 6 concecutively with a ratio of solvent: reactant 6 : 4; 7 : 3 and 8 : 2. The test {{results showed that the}} best indicator strip is PMMA-CuSO 4 5 % (7 : 3), PMMA-FeCl 3 5 % (7 : 3) and PMMA-Vanillin sulphate 7. 5 % (7 : 3). The detection limit and stability of the strip indicators PMMA-CuSO 4 5 % (7 : 3) are at 50 ppm and is stable up to 29 weeks, PMMA-FeCl 3 5 % (7 : 3) has a detection limit 12, 500 ppm and is stable up to 29 weeks, and PMMA-vanillin sulphate 7, 5 % (7 : 3) has a detection limit 500 ppm and is stable up to 29 weeks. The results showed that the indicator strip can be used as an alternative method to detect diclofenac sodium in herbal medicine and finally controlling addition of chemicals in to herbal medicine...|$|E
40|$|Competitive and {{recreational}} runners struggle {{to maintain a}} target pace during workouts and currently have no easy-to-see visual feedback on their pace. Lack of real-time, easy-to-see pace feedback {{makes it difficult for}} athletes to maintain a target pace and thereby makes their workouts less effective. Some GPS watches provide pacing feedback, but they are impossible to read while running hard. Pacing is a basic yet essential component of track and field, no matter what type of running event is taking place. During practice, certain paces are prescribed to evoke certain physiological responses from athletes. For example, a coach might ask an athlete to run a pace in practice in order to increase their lactic threshold or their VO 2 Max, both very important factors of performance. Despite technology being a large part of our culture and sport, track and field is lacking in technological advancements to improve performance and marketability of the sport. Currently, an athlete can only check if they are on pace once a lap, using splits, but these handheld devices cannot show if an athlete is falling behind or getting ahead during the lap. The TrackPacer provides a continuous indicator of pace during the entirety of the lap. Essentially, it lets the runner know where to be every second, on every point of the track rather than once or twice a lap. The TrackPacer LED light rope provides a visual indicator of the desired pace for athletes to maintain. There are no other visual non-worn pace indicators. Presently, athletes rely on watches or other worn devices to monitor their pace. The LED light <b>strip</b> <b>indicator</b> is better than existing methods because it eliminates monitoring a watch or worn device and permits even a sprinter to determine whether he is maintaining target pace. The TrackPacer is superior to sports watches due to its convenient, easily viewed placement on the inner perimeter of a track...|$|E

The work. reported here includes a controlled study to examine the survival and potential re-growth of specific microorganisms over a 6 -month period of storage after heating and compaction. Before heating and compaction, ersatz solid wastes were inoculated with Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, previously isolated from recovered space shuttle mission food and packaging waste. Compacted HMC tiles were sampled for microbiological analysis at time points between 0 and 180 days of storage in a controlled environment chamber. In addition, biological <b>indicator</b> <b>strips</b> containing spores of Bacillus atrophaeus and Geobacillus stearothermophilus were imbedded in trash to assess the efficacy of the HMC process to achieve sterilization.

The aims of this paper are: (1) to investigate the effects of floodplain Roughened Strips for reducing and delaying flood peaks, (2) to compare the results of models (one- and two-dimensional hydraulic models) to find the limitations of application of the 1 D model. First, we assessed the effect of roughened strips on the propagation of flood hydrographs without/with roughened strips installed in four configurations of compound channels differing by width and slope. The regime always stayed subcritical. To quantify the effects of the roughened <b>strips,</b> proper <b>indicators,</b> such as relative attenuation and relative delay of peak, are proposed. For simple symmetrical arrangement of roughened strips, results of 1 -D and 2 -D models are quite similar: the effects are proportional to the roughened surface and the relative indicator values are almost constant with the flood return period. But in the case of more complex arrangements, it appeared that a 2 D model should be used to obtain accurate results. Finally, a test on river Hogneau was carried out. A simple interpolation method was devised to estimate a priori effects on flood mitigation of Roughened Strips implementation, using the results of simulation on the compound channels.

The indicator consists of normalised pesticide loads to streams computed through a simplified steady-state fate model that distinguishes various chemical groups according to physico-chemical behaviour (solubility and persistence). The retention of pollutants in the buffer zone is modelled according to buffer width and sorption properties.

Due to missing geo-spatial data of pesticide emissions, a total pesticide emission scenario is assumed. The QuBES indicator is easy to calculate and requires far less input data and parameterisation than typical chemical-specific models. At the same time, it allows mapping of (i) riparian buffer permeability, (ii) chemical runoff from soils, and (iii) the buffered load of chemicals to the stream network.

Four kinetic models were then evaluated for their prediction of bacterial spore behavior under irradiation. This included: (i) first-order kinetics model; (ii) Shull model; (iii) Sapru model; and (iv) probabilistic model. From R 2 and AIC analyses, we noted that the probabilistic model performed the best, followed by the Sapru model.

40|$|Introduction: Casein is a {{milk protein}} {{that has the}} same number of {{positive}} and negative charges in a pH around 4. 7. This characteristic is called the isoelectric point (pI). The pI varies from protein to protein and it depends on the charges of the lateral chain of the constituent aminoacids. At this pH value the protein has its minimum solubility since the net charge is zero and the repulsion between molecules is decreased. Furthermore, the electrostatic interaction occurs between the protein molecules. Thus, they form clumps which tend to precipitate. On the other hand, when they are placed in a solution whose pH is above or below of its pI, the protein molecules have respectively a negative or positive net charge, with strong repulsion between themselves and great interaction with the solvent (water). Objective: This learning object presents a simulation of a laboratory practice for the determination of casein isoelectric point. Materials and Methods: Cartoons were planned in order to show the methodology procedures and biochemical fundamentals. Animations were developed with the aid of the Adobe ® Flash 8 software associated with logic programming. Results: The simulation consists of six steps that reproduce the activities performed in the laboratory. Among them, the user can observe different degrees of turbidity and / or precipitation of casein in solutions with different pH values, he can measure these values with paper <b>indicator</b> <b>strips</b> and then determine the pI of this protein. Conclusions: This learning object was tested by students of Biochemistry I, Pharmacy course since 2012 / 2.

The diabetic children were then divided into two subgroups: a) 20 children with adequate metabolic control (Hb 1 ac≤ 7. 5) and b) 48 children with poor metabolic control (Hb 1 ac> 7. 5). Data on dietary and oral hygienic habits was obtained on all the subjects participating in the study. Collection of saliva was carried out after stimulating salivation by chewing on a piece of paraffin for 5 minutes. Microbial flora was analyzed using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridisation method. Plaque acidogenity was recorded using pH <b>indicator</b> <b>strips</b> up to 30 min after a sucrose rinse. Caries registration was performed using the ICDAS index. Results : No statically significant difference in clinical data was found in the two study groups with similar caries status. No statistically significant difference was found for tooth brushing frequency, use of fluoridated toothpaste, mouthwash and other fluoride supplements and the pattern of dental check-ups between the groups examined. Statistically significant differences for plaque-pH when analyzed as minimum pH, AUC 6. 2 and AUC 5. 7 between all diabetic and the non-diabetic children (p< 0. 01 or p< 0. 05) were found. The bacterial counts differed significantly between diabetic and non-diabetic subjects regarding S. Mutans, S. Sobrinus, L. Salivarius and L. Fermentum (p< 0. 05). Conclusions : Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus patients showed a more cariogenic bacterial environment and a direct effect on plaque pH reducing it from normal levels was detected...|$|R
