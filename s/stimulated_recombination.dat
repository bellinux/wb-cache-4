However, by several other criteria, such as proficiency in recombination, relative resistance to UV radiation, and viability of the cells in the culture, these mutants are almost identical to their recBC+ parent. The properties of these mutants indicate that the ATP-dependent double-stranded DNA exonuclease activity of RecBC enzyme is not required for recombination. Chi recombinational hotspots, which <b>stimulate</b> <b>recombination</b> by the RecBC pathway, have no detectable activity in the mutants.

40|$|We {{have used}} {{extrachromosomal}} substrates carrying immunoglobulin heavy-chain S mu and S gamma 3 switch region sequences to study activation and targeting of recombination by a transcriptional enhancer element. Substrates are transiently introduced into activated primary murine B cells, in which recombination involving S-region sequences deletes a conditionally lethal marker, and recombination {{is measured by}} transformation of Escherichia coli in the second step of the assay. Previously we found {{that as many as}} 25 % of replicated substrates recombined during 40 -h transfection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -stimulated primary cells and that efficient recombination was dependent on the presence of S-region sequences as well as a transcriptional activator region in the constructs (H. Leung and N. Maizels, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 : 4154 - 4158, 1992). Here we show that recombination of the switch substrates is threefold more efficient in LPS-cultured primary B cells than in the T-cell line EL 4; the activities responsible for switch substrate recombination thus appear to be more abundant or more active in cells which can carry out chromosomal switch recombination. We test the role of the transcriptional activator region and show that the immunoglobulin heavy-chain intron enhancer (E mu) alone <b>stimulates</b> <b>recombination</b> as well as E mu combined with a heavy-chain promoter and that mutations that diminish enhancer-dependent transcription 500 -fold diminish recombinational activation less than 2 -fold. These observations suggest that the enhancer <b>stimulates</b> <b>recombination</b> by a mechanism that does not depend on transcript production or that is insensitive to the level of transcript production over a very broad range. Furthermore, we find that E mu <b>stimulates</b> <b>recombination</b> when located either upstream or downstream of S mu but that the position of the recombinational activator does affect the targeting of recombination junctions, suggesting that the relatively imprecise targeting of switch junctions in vivo may reflect the availability of many potential activator sites within each switch region...|$|R

The effects of simian virus 40 T-antigen-dependent substrate replication upon the stimulation of recombination conferred by the Z-DNA motif d(TG) 30 were analyzed.

For elimination of DNA damage, a set of repair mechanisms, mainly photoreactivation, excision, and recombination repair, has evolved. Whereas photoreactivation and excision repair have been intensely studied during the last few years, recombination repair, its regulation, and its interrelationship with photoreactivation in response to UV-B-induced DNA damage is still poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed somatic homologous recombination in a transgenic Arabidopsis line carrying a β-glucuronidase gene as a recombination marker and in offsprings of crosses of this line with a photolyase deficient uvr 2 – 1 mutant. UV-B radiation <b>stimulated</b> <b>recombination</b> frequencies in a dose-dependent manner correlating linearly with cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) levels.

40|$|AbstractV(D) J {{recombination}} assembles functional immunoglobulin and T {{cell receptor}} genes from individual gene segments [1]. A common recombination mechanism, {{initiated by the}} proteins RAG 1 and RAG 2 at conserved recombination signal sequences (RSSs), operates at all rearranging loci [2, 3]. It has been proposed that the key regulator of the reaction is ‘accessibility’ of the RSS within chromatin [4]. Recently, the packaging of RSSs into nucleosomes was shown to inhibit initiation of V(D) J recombination [5, 6]. Nevertheless, the tight tissue specificity of regulation cannot be explained by nucleosome-mediated repression alone because a significant fraction of RSSs would be predicted to lie in linker regions between nucleosomes. Therefore, {{some aspect of the}} regulation of the recombination reaction must rely on the disruption of higher-order chromatin structure. Here, we report that histone acetylation directly <b>stimulates</b> the <b>recombination</b> reaction in vivo in the correct cell- and stage-specific manner.

By genetic engineering procedures, we generated constructs in human cells for testing the recombination activity of the same I-SceI variants. Both in yeast and human cells we performed gene correction experiments using oligonucleotides (oligos) following modification and/or optimization of existing gene targeting protocols and development of new ones. We demonstrated that an I-SceI nicking enzyme can <b>stimulate</b> <b>recombination</b> on the chromosome in S. cerevisiae at multiple genomic loci.

We showed that an I-SceI double-strand break (DSB) could trigger recombination up to 2 kb distant from the break at an episomal target locus in human cells, though the same was not observed for the nick. Overall, we demonstrated the capacity for I-SceI nick-induced recombination in yeast and human cells. Importantly, our findings reveal that the nick stimulates gene correction by oligos differently from a DSB lesion, as determined by genetic and molecular analyses in yeast and human cells.

We previously demonstrated that psoralen adducts targeted by triple-helix-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) could induce recombination between tandem repeats of a supF reporter gene in a simian virus 40 vector in monkey COS cells. Based on work showing that triple helices, {{even in the absence of}} associated psoralen adducts, are able to provoke DNA repair and cause mutations, we asked whether intermolecular triplexes could <b>stimulate</b> <b>recombination.</b> Here, we report that triple-helix formation itself is capable of promoting recombination and that this effect is dependent on a functional nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. Transfection of COS cells carrying the dual supF vector with a purine-rich TFO, AG 30, designed to bind as a third strand to a region between the two mutant supF genes yielded recombinants at a frequency of 0. 37 %, fivefold above background, whereas a scrambled sequence control oligomer was ineffective. In human cells deficient in the NER factor XPA, the ability of AG 30 to induce recombination was eliminated, but it was restored in a corrected subline expressing the XPA cDNA. In comparison, the ability of triplex-directed psoralen cross-links to induce recombination was only partially reduced in XPA-deficient cells, suggesting that NER is not the only pathway that can metabolize targeted psoralen photoadducts into recombinagenic intermediates. Interestingly, the triplex-induced recombination was unaffected in cells deficient in DNA mismatch repair, challenging our previous model of a heteroduplex intermediate and supporting a model based on end joining.

One neo allele was controlled by the dexamethasone-inducible mouse mam-mary tumor virus promoter and inactivated by an insertion containing an I-SceI site at which DSBs were introduced in vivo. The other neo allele lacked a promoter but carried 12 phenotypically silent single-base mutations that create restriction sites (restriction fragment length polymorphisms). This system allowed us to generate detailed conversion tract spectra for recipient alleles transcribed at high or low levels.

Strikingly, 97 % of these products arose by gene conversion. Most products had short, bidirectional conversion tracts, and in all cases, donor neo alleles (i. e., those not suffering a DSB) remained unchanged, indicating that conversion was fully nonreciprocal.
