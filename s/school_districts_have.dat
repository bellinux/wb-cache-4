The Encinitas, California school district gained a San Diego Superior Court Judge's approval to use yoga in P.E., holding against the parents who claimed the practice was intrinsically religious and hence should not be part of a state funded program.|$|E

Texas paid instructors $41,744, {{below the national average}} of $46,593. The Texas Education Agency (TEA) administers the state's public school systems. Texas has over 1,000 school districts- all districts except the Stafford Municipal School District are independent from municipal government and many cross city boundaries. <b>School</b> <b>districts</b> <b>have</b> the power to tax their residents and to assert eminent domain over privately owned property. Due to court-mandated equitable school financing for school districts, the state has a controversial tax redistribution system called the"Robin Hood plan".

25|$|Texas {{has over}} 1,000 public school districtsall {{but one of}} the school districts in Texas are independent, {{separate}} from any form of municipal government.

The Wilmer-Hutchins Independent School District once served portions of southern Dallas, but it was shut down for the 2005–2006 year.

25|$|At {{the same}} time, {{members of the}} Missouri General Assembly and Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon again began attacking the {{desegregation}} plan {{on the grounds of}} its costs. Nixon proposed that instead of spending money to transfer students, funds would be better spent improving derelict conditions in city schools, a view supported by St. Louis's first black mayor, Freeman Bosley, Jr.. After another legal challenge to the plan in early 1996 (based on recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings), the court ordered a review of the plan and a second settlement agreement. A settlement plan developed in the Missouri legislature called for reduced state money for the program and a focus only on funding magnet schools in the city and the voluntary transfer program. All but one of the suburban districts agreed to renew the agreement on these terms (Ladue School District was the exception), and in 1999, the renewed settlement was established. However, under the 1999 agreement, <b>school</b> <b>districts</b> <b>have</b> been permitted to withdraw from the voluntary transfer program starting in 2002, and two districts have done so (Lindbergh School District and Pattonville School District). A five-year extension of the voluntary transfer program was approved in 2007, allowing new enrollments to take place through the 2013–2014 school year in participating districts.|$|E

USDA spokesman Mike Jarvis stated that of the 117 million pounds of beef ordered nationally for the school lunch program in the past year, 6% was LFTB. An analysis of California Department of Education data indicated that [...] "anywhere from none to nearly 3 million pounds of beef from the USDA that was served in California schools last year could have contained lean finely textured beef".

2500|$|Recent {{research}} suggests {{that there has been}} a shift in blocking the use of social networking services. In many cases, the opposite is occurring as the potential of online networking services is being realized.

Banning social networking [...] is not only inappropriate but also borderline irresponsible when it comes to providing the best educational experiences for students.

2500|$|Section 2 of Article XIII C {{contains}} the voter approval requirements for local government taxes. [...] Under Proposition 218, every local government tax {{is either a}} general tax or a special tax. [...] Proposition 218 does not allow a local tax to be a hybrid tax. [...] The type of tax a local government imposes (general or special) is legally significant because it determines the applicable voter approval requirement. [...] Special purpose districts or agencies, including <b>school</b> <b>districts,</b> <b>have</b> no power to levy general taxes and can only impose special taxes. [...] This restriction is based on prior judicial interpretations of Proposition 13. [...] As a practical matter, only a city or a county {{has the power to}} levy a general tax under Proposition 218. [...] The voter approval requirement under Proposition 218 was upheld by a California appellate court.|$|E
2500|$|The National School Boards Association {{reports that}} almost 60% of {{students}} who use social networking talk about education topics online, and more than 50% talk specifically about schoolwork. Yet {{the vast majority of}} <b>school</b> <b>districts</b> <b>have</b> stringent rules against nearly all forms of social networking during the school day—even though students and parents report few problem behaviors online. Social networks focused on supporting relationships between teachers and their students are now used for learning, educator professional development, and content sharing. HASTAC is a collaborative social network space for new modes of learning and research in higher education, K-12, and lifelong learning; Ning supports teachers; TermWiki, Learn Central, TeachStreet and other sites are being built to foster relationships that include educational blogs, eportfolios, formal and ad hoc communities, as well as communication such as chats, discussion threads, and synchronous forums. These sites also have content sharing and rating features. Social networks are also emerging as online yearbooks, both public and private. One such service is MyYearbook, which allows anyone from the general public to register and connect. A new trend emerging is [...] private label yearbooks accessible only by students, parents, and teachers of a particular school, similar to Facebook's beginning within Harvard.|$|E
