40|$|People often {{speak about}} {{visually}} perceived events that unfold in real time. In doing so speakers regularly translate {{the details of}} the visual world they describe onto the grammatical properties of the sentences about it. For example, the speaker needs to map her constantly changing attentional state onto the syntactic plan of the produced sentences. The present paper briefly discusses what attention is, explores methods for the co-activation of attentional and syntactic operations during the production of visually-mediated sentences in languages with different syntactic properties, and reviews the evidence for a regular link between the <b>speaker</b> <b>s</b> choice of sentential structure and the distribution of the <b>speaker</b> <b>s</b> attention to the event s referents. Also, it discusses evidence for interactive properties of attentional and other types of priming on the <b>speaker</b> <b>s</b> syntactic choice. Based on reviewed literature, we conclude that attention plays a crucial role in directing lexical and grammatical choices in human discourse. At the same time, the organization of the language s grammar reciprocates this influence by constraining {{the extent to which the}} distribution of attention can affect the real-time syntactic choices. Finally, we discuss how attentional priming engages in complex interactions with other priming effects: it interacts with lexical priming but not with syntactic priming, supporting an encapsulated view of sentence formulation...|$|R

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this {{investigation}} was to perform a VOT analysis of correct and incorrect productions elicited from an apraxic/aphasic <b>speaker</b> (<b>S</b> 1), who consistently devoiced stop and affricate targets. A secondary objective was to analyse the VOTs of an apraxic/aphasic <b>speaker</b> (<b>S</b> 2) who produced stop and affricate voicing distinctions correctly, as determined by broad phonetic transcription. Seven hundred and ninety monosyllabic words, representing four voiced-voiceless cognate pairs, were analysed for each subject. VOT results indicated that S 1 's error productions (i. e. [t] for /d/; [p] for /b/; [k] for /g/; and [t integral] for /d(3) /) differed significantly from his correct, voiceless, homonymous productions (i. e. [t] for /t/; [p] for /p/; [k] for /k/; and [t integral] for /tf/). Therefore, Si's sound errors were not considered to be sound substitutions, as had been indicated perceptually. Overlapping VOT values were found for all of S 2 's voiced-voiceless cognate pairs, despite perceptually accurate productions, indicating possible speech motor control problems...|$|R
