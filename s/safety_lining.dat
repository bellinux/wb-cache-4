40|$|Baoshan Iron & Steel {{operates}} {{a fleet of}} seventy (70) 320 tonne torpedo cars. During liquid iron transportation, they experience significant heat loss through their refractory linings. Therefore, a layer of high strength insulating material behind a <b>safety</b> <b>lining</b> was considered. This paper summarizes a study evaluating the thermal behavior of the refractory lining with and without this insulating layer. A finite-element thermal analysis was conducted, with representative modeling of material properties and processing conditions. It covered the main process steps, including the charging at the blast furnace, the residence time, the different treatments, emptying at the BOF shop, and idling time. The benefits of using the insulation layer, in terms of heat conservation, lower shell temperatures, the improvement of liquid iron temperatures, and better heat-flow regulation, are quantified...|$|E
40|$|In this study, it {{was shown}} that {{improvements}} {{in the quality of}} continuously cast steel billets, similar to those which can be achieved by electromagnetic stirring (EMS) of the liquid pool during solidification, can be obtained if casting superheats can be consistently controlled at low levels. A lack of casting temperature control is not only detrimental {{to the quality of the}} cast product, but also to a shop's overall productivity. The important variables for temperature control in the ladle, tundish and mould were quantified and possible methods of controlling these variables were proposed. The thermal state of the ladle lining is one of the major contributors to the variability in casting temperature. It was shown that by reducing energy losses from the refractory ladle lining, by way of incorporating an insulating refractory tile between the ladle shell and the <b>safety</b> <b>lining</b> and by using a ladle lid throughout the cycle of the ladle, temperature losses from the liquid steel can be substantially decreased.

40|$|This paper reports an {{investigation}} {{carried out on}} the deskulling problem of tundishes at the Mobarakeh Steel Plant in Iran. Bad deskulling of tundishes {{is a major problem}} in continuous casting of steel, and can occur due to the chemical reactions between the refractory lining and the slag carry over from ladle to tundish. Post-mortem analysis of the slag/commercial magnesia-olivine mix refractory interface by XRF, XRD, OM, TEM, SEM and EDS techniques showed that the volume of slag carry over from ladle to tundish has a direct effect on refractory wear in the tundish. The percentage of tundishes where the skull was locked into the <b>safety</b> <b>lining</b> was dependent on the slag basicity and amount of Al 2 O 3 in the slag inside the tundish. It has been shown that a direct corrosion mechanism occurs in basic slag and also in acidic slag containing low alumina, but an indirect corrosion mechanism occurs in acidic slag containing high alumina...|$|E
40|$|The thesis <b>Safety</b> <b>line</b> workers {{mental hygiene}} deals about psychohygiene of consultants, who provide crisis {{intervention}} {{to children and}} adolescents over the phone. Topics such as mental hygiene and phone crisis intervention are elaborated {{in the first part}} of the thesis and the <b>Safety</b> <b>line</b> organization is discussed in detail as well. An empirical part of the thesis deals about types of psychohygiene which are used by the <b>Safety</b> <b>line</b> consultants. It has been discovered, that the <b>Safety</b> <b>line</b> workers use forms of psychohygiene, which the organization has to offer. A chance to discuss specific problems with shift team lead is mostly appreciated by them as well as the fact, that there are teams at the <b>Safety</b> <b>line</b> therefore consultants are not alone for solving issues. Hypotheses used for discovering the connection between socio-demografic entries and psychohygiene haven't been rejected except one. The only hypothesis, which could be rejected, was related to the lengths of practice at the <b>Safety</b> <b>line</b> and level of mental balance. The goal of this thesis was to chart methods of mental hygiene of the <b>Safety</b> <b>line</b> workers and thus to show them ways, how to nurture themselves and how to reach mental equilibrium while working for the <b>Safety</b> <b>line...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the {{possibility}} of using Business Intelligence tools in a non-profit organization. These tools should be used to create regular and special data analyses and to replace current, no longer satisfactory method of data processing. The main objective was to create a proposal of implementation of Business Intelligence solution for the Children's <b>Safety</b> <b>Line</b> (Sdružení Linka bezpečí). In order to fulfil the main objective, secondary objectives were identified, specifically the discovery of a suitable adjustment of the Balanced Scorecard methodology for non-profit organizations and its application on the Children's <b>Safety</b> <b>Line.</b> The main objective of this thesis was achieved by creating a proposal; the proposed solution was implemented in the <b>Safety</b> <b>Line</b> environment. The thesis is devided into a theoretical and practical part. The theoretical part uses Business Intelligence tools, Balanced Scorecard methodology (adjusted for non-profit sector) and contains the Commentated research.
