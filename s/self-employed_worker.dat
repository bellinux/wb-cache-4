30|$|Despite the {{political}} debate on dependent self-employment, we know little about dependent <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> due to a lack of corresponding data. The British Labour Force Survey {{was the first to}} include variables that aid in identifying dependent <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers.</b> It is the only dataset that facilitates analysis over a longer period of time. The UK is also an interesting case because of its low level of labour market regulation and supposedly few incentives to circumvent regulations (Nickell and Quintini, 2002). Our first aim is to illustrate the prevalence and characteristics of dependent <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers.</b> Second, we analyse the characteristics of dependent <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> with data from the British Labour Force Survey, investigating whether and how dependent <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> differ from employees and (independent) <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers.</b> Third, we examine whether dependent <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> are rather pushed than pulled into this labour market state by analysing the associations of “good” and “bad” characteristics. Fourth, we consider whether dependent self-employment provides the chance to exploit business opportunities (“opportunity entrepreneurship”) or if such workers lack alternatives (“necessity entrepreneurship”). Finally, although data limitations prevent us from testing the stepping-stone hypothesis, we analyse the short-term labour market behaviour of dependent <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers.</b> Prior to these analyses, we briefly discuss the legal context of dependent self-employment in the UK.|$|R

Many intellectuals have described proletarianization in advanced capitalism as [...] "the extension of the logic of factory labor to a large sector of services and intellectual professions." [...] In most countries, entitlement to unemployment benefits is conditional on actively looking for work, and that means people, assuming they are not sick, are compelled to seek employment either as a salaried worker or as a <b>self-employed</b> <b>worker.</b> Geographically and historically, the process of proletarianization is closely associated with urbanization because it has often involved the migration of people from rural areas where they engaged in subsistence farming, family farming and sharecropping to the cities and towns, in search of waged work and income in an office or factory (see rural flight).|$|E

30|$|These workers, who {{are between}} {{independent}} self-employment and dependent employment, may face {{two forms of}} dependence. The first dependence is economic in nature, implying that workers carry {{some or all of}} the entrepreneurial risk. Because such workers have only one contractor, they generate their whole income from this business relationship. If the two parties do not usually agree on a constant quantity of orders, instead – and quite contrarily – basing the amount of business the dependent <b>self-employed</b> <b>worker</b> receives on the economic situation of the firm the worker contracts with, the dependent <b>self-employed</b> <b>worker</b> obviously takes on the short-term risk of demand fluctuations. The second form of dependence relates to time, place, and content of work. Whether a dependent <b>self-employed</b> <b>worker</b> is more similar to employees or to independent self-employed persons is determined by the degree of these two forms of dependency.|$|E

40|$|The Palestinian {{context is}} missing in the tax morale literature.

By using a bivariate probit model, we find that tax morale increases with public spirit but it is lower among Palestinians involved in associational activities. Predicted conditional probabilities indicate that public spirit has more impact when the respondent has low confidence in the institutions and in the rule of law. Finally, more public spirit is required for a <b>self-employed</b> <b>worker</b> {{in order to deal with}} tax compliance than for a worker in the public sector, unless the worker in the public sector has lower confidence in the institutions and in the rule of law than the <b>self-employed</b> <b>worker...</b>|$|E

30|$|The {{working time}} of <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> and family workers exceeds the annual hours worked of {{employees}} to a great extent. In 2014, <b>self-employed</b> and family <b>workers</b> performed on average 1973 h. In the 1990 s their annual working time was on average 320  h higher, but since 2001 it declines. This decline {{is due to}} the increasing share of <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> without employees, with one third of them working part-time. As a result the part-time rate among <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> strongly increased. One reason for this increase is the larger use of subsidized founding until 2011. Recent studies show that the working time in those newly founded establishments is lower than among traditional <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers,</b> and that self-employment in part-time seemed to be realised with this instrument (cf. Caliendo et al. 2009). Other studies also show that the foundation process in Germany seems to change from self-employment in full-time to part-time self-employment (cf. Brenke 2013).|$|R
30|$|This section aims {{to build}} an {{analytical}} framework to estimate the degree of underreporting of income by households with <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> as household heads.

Previous studies have qualified this second assumption setting that salary workers are completely honest by reporting their income while <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> hide part of their earnings. However, we really think that a most adjusted picture to the real world involves salary workers (at least some of them) that also conceal partially their income, although in a lower degree than <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers.</b> Consequently, a natural test for measuring the relative extent of such a underreporting by <b>self-employed</b> <b>workers</b> consists of comparing food demand functions—which depend on income—of both groups.|$|R
