Happily for the feelings of her father, the fact was made known, soon after the house had been pulled down, by the arrival of a small party of native settlers bearing one of the child's shoes. They had found it, they said, <b>sticking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud,</b> about a mile off, and had tracked the little footsteps a long way into the mountains by the side of the prints made by the naked feet of a savage.

'"This {{is where}} I was {{prisoner}} for three days," [...] he murmured to me (it {{was on the}} occasion of our visit to the Rajah), while we were making our way slowly through a kind of awestruck riot of dependants across Tunku Allang's courtyard. [...] "Filthy place, isn't it? And I couldn't get anything to eat either, unless I made a row about it, and then it was only a small plate of rice and a fried fish not much bigger than a stickleback--confound them! Jove! I've been hungry prowling inside this stinking enclosure with some of these vagabonds shoving their mugs right under my nose. I had given up that famous revolver of yours at the first demand. Glad {{to get rid of the}} bally thing. Look like a fool walking about with an empty shooting-iron in my hand." [...] At that moment we came into the presence, and he became unflinchingly grave and complimentary with his late captor. Oh! magnificent! I want to laugh when I think of it. But I was impressed, too. The old disreputable Tunku Allang could not help showing his fear (he was no hero, for all the tales of his hot youth he was fond of telling); and at the same time there was a wistful confidence in his manner towards his late prisoner. Note! Even where he would be most hated he was still trusted. Jim--as far as I could follow the conversation--was improving the occasion by the delivery of a lecture. Some poor villagers had been waylaid and robbed while on their way to Doramin's house with a few pieces of gum or beeswax which they wished to exchange for rice. [...] "It was Doramin who was a thief," [...] burst out the Rajah. A shaking fury seemed to enter that old frail body. He writhed weirdly on his mat, gesticulating with his hands and feet, tossing the tangled strings of his mop--an impotent incarnation of rage. There were staring eyes and dropping jaws all around us. Jim began to speak. Resolutely, coolly, and for some time he enlarged upon the text that no man should be prevented from getting his food and his children's food honestly. The other sat like a tailor at his board, one palm on each knee, his head low, and fixing Jim through the grey hair that fell over his very eyes. When Jim had done there was a great stillness. Nobody seemed to breathe even; no one made a sound till the old Rajah sighed faintly, and looking up, with a toss of his head, said quickly, [...] "You hear, my people! No more of these little games." [...] This decree was received in profound silence. A rather heavy man, evidently in a position of confidence, with intelligent eyes, a bony, broad, very dark face, and a cheerily of officious manner (I learned later on he was the executioner), presented to us two cups of coffee on a brass tray, which he took from the hands of an inferior attendant. [...] "You needn't drink," [...] muttered Jim very rapidly. I didn't perceive the meaning at first, and only looked at him. He took a good sip and sat composedly, holding the saucer in his left hand. In a moment I felt excessively annoyed. [...] "Why the devil," [...] I whispered, smiling at him amiably, [...] "do you expose me to such a stupid risk?" [...] I drank, of course, there was nothing for it, while he gave no sign, and almost immediately afterwards we took our leave. While we were going down the courtyard to our boat, escorted by the intelligent and cheery executioner, Jim said he was very sorry. It was the barest chance, of course. Personally he thought nothing of poison. The remotest chance. He was--he assured me--considered to be infinitely more useful than dangerous, and so [...] "But the Rajah is afraid of you abominably. Anybody can see that," [...] I argued with, I own, a certain peevishness, and all the time watching anxiously for the first twist of some sort of ghastly colic. I was awfully disgusted. [...] "If I am to do any good here and preserve my position," [...] he said, taking his seat by my side in the boat, [...] "I must stand the risk: I take it once every month, at least. Many people trust me to do that--for them. Afraid of me! That's just it. Most likely he is afraid of me because I am not afraid of his coffee." [...] Then showing me a place on the north front of the stockade where the pointed tops of several stakes were broken, [...] "This is where I leaped over on my third day in Patusan. They haven't put new stakes there yet. Good leap, eh?" [...] A moment later we passed the mouth of a muddy creek. [...] "This is my second leap. I had a bit of a run and took this one flying, but fell short. Thought I would leave my skin there. Lost my shoes struggling. And all the time I was thinking to myself how beastly it would be to get a jab with a bally long spear while <b>sticking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> like this. I remember how sick I felt wriggling in that slime. I mean really sick--as if I had bitten something rotten." ...|$|E
50|$|Both sides dug {{in for a}} slogging {{defensive}} {{contest and}} not surprisingly, when Gomersall called a halt for half-time, neither side had scored. So bad were conditions, Blues second-rower Noel Cleal attempted a line drop out only for <b>the</b> ball to <b>stick</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gluey <b>mud</b> and trickle a metre forward. In contrast, Wally Lewis had earlier kicked a drop out some 40 metres downfield which drew a glare from Gomersall, especially as a quarter line drop out from Lewis just 10 minutes into the game had barely travelled 10 metres. Lewis later {{admitted that he had}} distracted Gomersall by calling for his team to stay onside. When Gomersall looked away to check, Lewis kicked the ball but caught it before it hit the ground. The deadlock was only broken when Mal Meninga landed a penalty goal. shortly afterwards Queensland prop Greg Dowling scored a memorable Origin try. Lewis had been peppering the New South wales line with his searching kicks and chipped ahead, aiming for <b>the</b> in-goal area. <b>In</b> a moment of good fortune for the Maroons the ball struck the cross-bar and Dowling who had been following through, took an extraordinary catch on his finger tips centimetres from the rain soaked ground and plunged across <b>the</b> line <b>in</b> a splash of mud to score and give Queensland an 8-0 lead.|$|R

40|$|The fate of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis in {{a natural}} aquatic habitat was studied in a model system by using laboratory-simulated field waters and a mutant of the {{bacterium}} resistant to three antibiotics. Contact with mud of a sporal culture of <b>the</b> mutant resulted <b>in</b> an immediate disappearance of the larvicidal activity but had no influence on viability. The cessation of toxicity was caused by bacterial adsorption on soil particles, since 99. 8 % of the bacteria was found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> fraction within 45 min, with concurrent disappearance from the supernatant. When <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> was stirred, <b>the</b> bacteria could be redetected. The viability count of <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> suspension remained practically constant for at least 22 days, indicating that the spores were still fully viable but were incapable of germinating and multiplying <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> under our experimental conditions. Approximately 8 % of the colony forming ability of the bacteria could be separated from <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> by vigorous mixing followed by immediate filtration. The filtrated spores retained their toxicity, killing 90 % of the larval populations even after 22 days incubation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> soil. The inactivation of the toxic activity of B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> was therefore a reversible process and was probably due to masking of the bacteria, thus making the bacteria and their toxin inaccessible to <b>the</b> larvae. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> simulated field waters without mud, we observed only a very slow inhibition of <b>the</b> larvicidal activity. <b>In</b> contrast to <b>the</b> activity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> suspension, this activity could not be restored...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Coastal {{reclamation}} {{has been}} carried out along the coastal areas near Shenzhen, China in a large scale since 1980 s by dumping fill materials over <b>the</b> marine <b>mud</b> at <b>the</b> sea bottom. Usually the area to be reclaimed is drained first and some of <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> is airdried for a few weeks before it is buried by fill. After reclamation, the terrestrial groundwater, which is relatively acidic and with high dissolved oxygen, gradually displaces the seawater, which is alkaline with high salinity. <b>The</b> changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> burial conditions of <b>mud</b> and <b>the</b> properties of <b>the</b> pore water <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> may induce <b>the</b> release of some heavy metals into <b>the</b> <b>mud.</b> Field survey confirms that the pH and salinity of <b>the</b> groundwater <b>in</b> <b>the</b> reclamation site are much lower than the seawater. Chemical analyses of mud and groundwater samples collected from the reclamation sites reclaimed in different years indicate that most of <b>the</b> heavy metals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> decrease gradually with time, but <b>the</b> heavy metals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> groundwater are increased.

40|$|Several seismic {{properties}} of Lake Maracaibo are unique {{and difficult to}} understand. However, {{studies show that the}} two principal factors that affect the seismic data are likely to be the low compressional and shear wave velocities generated by <b>the</b> gassy sediment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> layer, and <b>the</b> high attenuation of the compressional and shear waves. This mud layer sediment is heavy and is not suspended <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water. Furthermore, it is compacted enough to support shear stresses and, therefore, has a finite shear wave velocity. <b>In</b> theory, <b>the</b> gas content of the sediment reduces the compressional wave velocity by an order of magnitude below the values for water saturated sediments, but in Lake Maracaibo several studies show that gassy sediment reduces the compressional wave velocity from 1500 m/s to between 300 m/s and 700 m/s. This situation produces high attenuation of the compressional waves that are traveling through <b>the</b> sediment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first 100 m. However, the results of seismic modeling show that this velocity has to be between 700 m/s and 900 m/s in order to get reasonable results, at least <b>in</b> <b>the</b> study area. The results show that there are very important lithological differences between the zones with and without gassy sediments <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> layer. <b>The</b> best match between the raw data and the synthetic seismogram was found when an embedded rigid shale layer was located within <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> layer, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first 100 m. Unrealistic results were produced when the rigid shale layer was removed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> modeling. This rigid layer produces a destructive interference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Stoneley wave that could be observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> seismic data and <b>the</b> synthetic seismogram. <b>In</b> this research, <b>the</b> attenuation quality factor Q, an intrinsic property of rock, will be studied. Common attenuation mechanisms include grain sliding, viscous flow of pore fluid or gas, viscous relaxation and other features. Additionally, it will be shown that other factors can be proposed to account for the attenuation of compressional and shear waves in Lake Maracaibo sediments. They include: the viscous losses between the particles and the fluid immediately above <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> layer; and <b>the</b> solid friction losses between <b>the</b> particles, <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> layer and <b>the</b> gassy sediment. This research shows That <b>the</b> attenuation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> layer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> zone with gassy sediment is very different from <b>the</b> attenuation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> zone without gassy sediment, and that the compressional wave attenuation is larger <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> layer zone with gassy sediment than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> layer zone without gassy sediment. Finally, the research shows that the ringing is an important phenomenon associated with <b>the</b> low velocity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> layer and that this ringing has more frequency content <b>in</b> <b>the</b> zone without gassy sediment than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> zone with gassy sediment...|$|R
