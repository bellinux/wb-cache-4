25|$|Alexander Graham Bell died in 1922, {{and until}} {{recently}} no recordings of his voice were known to survive. On April 23, 2013, the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History, which houses a collection of Volta Laboratory materials, announced {{that one of its}} fragile Volta experimental sound recordings, a deteriorated wax-on-cardboard disc that can now be played safely by an optical <b>scanning</b> <b>technology,</b> had preserved the inventor's Scottish-tinged voice. Museum staff working with scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory had also revived the voice of his father, Alexander Melville Bell, from an 1881 recording in the wax-filled groove of a modified Edison tinfoil cylinder phonograph.|$|E
25|$|The fMRI concept {{builds on}} the earlier MRI <b>scanning</b> <b>technology</b> and the {{discovery}} of properties of oxygen-rich blood. MRI brain scans use a strong, permanent, static magnetic field to align nuclei in the brain region being studied. Another magnetic field, the gradient field, is then applied to spatially locate different nuclei. Finally, a radiofrequency (RF) pulse is played to kick the nuclei to higher magnetization levels, with the effect now depending on where they are located. When the RF field is removed, the nuclei {{go back to their}} original states, and the energy they emit is measured with a coil to recreate the positions of the nuclei. MRI thus provides a static structural view of brain matter. The central thrust behind fMRI was to extend MRI to capture functional changes in the brain caused by neuronal activity. Differences in magnetic properties between arterial (oxygen-rich) and venous (oxygen-poor) blood provided this link.|$|E
25|$|Due {{uncertainty}} over what services are available under the National Health Service, how to access that care, {{and what to}} expect it from it, Somalis in the Manchester area reportedly often seek medical treatment in Germany. The German healthcare system was perceived by them as being very professional and responsive, with rapid access to specialist care and modern <b>scanning</b> <b>technology.</b> German doctors have also advertised on Somali television for many years, and this has developed as the main medical tourism route for the Somali communities. Research conducted with Somali health workers in London has also shown that many Somali women have bad experiences of giving birth in the UK. This can {{be the result of}} the mismanagement of care relating to female circumcision during both pregnancy and labour. The respondents also reported that, in addressing communication barriers, the importance of oral culture amongst Somalis is not sufficiently recognised. Furthermore, Somali women felt that the attitudes of midwives towards them were stereotyped and negative. Other research has shown that there is a perceived failure of social services to work with the Somali community in London, and that there is growing mistrust of the motives of social services.|$|E

500|$|Traveling through time, Kirk {{and crew}} {{experience}} what author Jody Duncan Shay termed a [...] "dreamlike state". The script's only {{direction for the}} effect was [...] "now [...] go through time"; Nimoy and McQuarrie envisioned Kirk's dream as a montage of bizarre images. The filmmakers decided early on {{that part of the}} dream sequence would use computer-generated animation to give it an unreal quality divorced {{from the rest of the}} film. ILM worked from McQuarrie's storyboards and created a rough mock-up or animatic to show Nimoy and hone the direction of the sequence. For the very beginning of the dream, the inside of the Bird-of-Prey bridge was painted stark white. Part of the final sequence involved morphing the heads of the Enterprise crew into one another; ILM digitized the cast members' heads using a 3-D <b>scanning</b> <b>technology</b> developed by Cyberware and used the resulting data for the computer models. Because each head model had the same number of key points of reference, transforming one character into another was simple; more difficult, the animators recalled, was ensuring that the transformation looked [...] "pleasing" [...] and not [...] "grotesque". The resulting thirty seconds of footage took weeks to render; the department used every spare computer they could find to help in the processing chores. ILM's stage, optical, and matte departments collaborated to complete other shots for the dream sequence. The shot of a man's fall to Earth was created by filming a small puppet on bluescreen. Shots of liquid nitrogen composited behind the puppet gave the impression of smoke. The background plate of the planet was a large matte that allowed the camera to zoom in very close. The final shot of marshy terrain was practical and required no effects.|$|E
2500|$|Adolescents who {{regularly}} participated in binge drinking {{for several years}} show a smaller hippocampus brain region, in particular those who began drinking in early adolescence. Heavy binge drinking is associated with neurocognitive deficits of frontal lobe processing and impaired working memory as well as delayed auditory and verbal memory deficits. Animal {{studies suggest that the}} neurodegenerative effects of alcohol abuse during adolescence can be permanent. Research in humans, which utilised sophisticated brain <b>scanning</b> <b>technology</b> suggests that in adolescent teenagers, drinking more than 4 or 5 drinks {{once or twice a month}} results in subtle damage to the teenagers developing brain tissue, in particular the white matter. [...] However, this research is primarily cross-sectional and done with fairly small sample sizes, making causality less certain.|$|E

2500|$|One {{significant}} {{finding of}} modern studies {{is that a}} person's brain seems to commit to certain decisions before the person becomes aware of having made them. Researchers have found delays of about half a second (discussed in sections below). With contemporary brain <b>scanning</b> <b>technology,</b> other scientists in 2008 were able to predict with 60% accuracy whether subjects would press a button with their left or right hand up to 10 seconds before the subject became aware of having made that choice. These and other findings have led some scientists, like Patrick Haggard, to reject some forms of [...] "free will". To be clear, no single study would disprove all forms of free will. This is because the term [...] "free will" [...] can encapsulate different hypotheses, each of which {{must be considered in}} light of existing empirical evidence.|$|E
2500|$|Ray Kurzweil is an {{inventor}} and serial entrepreneur. When The Age of Spiritual Machines was published {{he had already}} started four companies: Kurzweil Computer Products, Inc. which created optical character recognition and image <b>scanning</b> <b>technology</b> to assist the blind, Kurzweil Music Systems, which developed music synthesizers with high quality emulation of real instruments, Kurzweil Applied Intelligence, which created speech recognition technology, and Kurzweil Educational Systems, which made print-to-speech reading technology. Critics say predictions from his previous book The Age of Intelligent Machines [...] "have largely come true" [...] and [...] "anticipated with uncanny accuracy most of the key computer developments" [...] of the 1990s. After this book was published {{he went on to}} expand upon its ideas in a follow-on book The Singularity is Near. Today Ray Kurzweil works at Google where he is attempting to [...] "create a truly useful AI [...] that will make all of us smarter".|$|E
