6000|$|... "Well, Mary, {{you have}} done wonders," [...] <b>said</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> as she took her place; [...] "your {{arrangements}} restore appetite to all of us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Child, {{thou art}} foolish!' <b>said</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> with dignity. 'Why should the {{resistance}} of canaille like that be observed at all, save to make sport?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't try illustration, Jeff," [...] <b>said</b> <b>my</b> plain-spoken <b>mother,</b> gently patting <b>my</b> arm; [...] "it {{is not one}} of your strong points." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then it was lucky, your having me?" [...] I <b>said.</b> Again <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> laughed, {{and again}} there {{followed}} that graver look upon her childish face.|$|R
6000|$|... "Daddy," [...] {{said the}} child, [...] "I haven't <b>said</b> <b>my</b> prayers. <b>Mother</b> did not come, and Anne {{said it was}} all {{nonsense}} about prayers. Auntie did always hear me my prayers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{he looks}} so awful," [...] <b>said</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> [...] "In this world," [...] said my father, [...] "one must {{occasionally}} be aggressive--if necessary, brutal." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Now, show {{yourself}} a man," [...] <b>said</b> <b>my</b> dear <b>mother,</b> [...] "remember {{you are in}} your teens. Take them out for a walk and amuse them; and mind nothing happens to them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Jeff, this is dreadful!" [...] <b>said</b> <b>my</b> poor <b>mother,</b> as she untied her bonnet-strings, and {{sat down}} on the sofa beside Bella, who could not for some time utter a word.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dispute them! Do {{you think}} that I will allow such a thing to be <b>said</b> of <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> without disputing it? Do you suppose that I will give up my claim {{to one of the}} finest {{properties}} in England without disputing it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{beg your}} pardon, my dear Jane,' <b>said</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> 'but are you quite sure--I am certain you'll excuse me, my dear Jane--that you {{understand}} Davy?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mr. Copperfield,' <b>said</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> {{answering}} {{with some}} difficulty, 'was so considerate and good as {{to secure the}} reversion of {{a part of it}} to me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was very}} kind of you," [...] <b>said</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> [...] "I would do {{anything}} to give him pleasure, anything-I could. He knows that. He understands." ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{the moment}} that he rung the doorbell, our Mary, who had seen him from the chamber window, {{suddenly}} grew pale, and <b>said</b> to <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> [...] "Please, ma'am, will you be so good as to excuse my going to the door? I feel faint." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lois," [...] he <b>said,</b> [...] "what <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> {{has advised}} {{would make me}} very happy. Will you {{remember}} that I wish it? Will you remember that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>said</b> to <b>my</b> <b>Mother</b> in the morning, [...] "I go away {{to find a}} {{thing for}} the people, but I {{do not know whether}} I shall return in my own shape." [...] She answered, [...] "Whether you live or die, or are made different, I am your Mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I declare,' <b>said</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> gently, 'they {{are exactly}} alike. I suppose they are mine. I {{think they are}} the colour of mine. But they are wonderfully alike.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Pooh!’ <b>said</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> ‘a man’s roar {{is neither}} here nor there.’ But her verdict {{as a whole}} was, ‘I would rather have been his mother than his wife.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's nothing missing," [...] <b>said</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> [...] "so far as I {{can find}} out. Depend upon it, that's the explanation: she has got frightened and has run away.|$|E
6000|$|... "There, sir," [...] I <b>said,</b> significantly--"There, <b>my</b> dear <b>mother,</b> is {{the proof}} that Miss Priscilla Bayard will not break her heart on my account." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{father was}} a Portuguese," [...] she <b>said,</b> [...] "and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> French. I was born in England, though. You, I suppose, have lived here all your life?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Take your {{version of}} it,' {{returned}} Arthur, finding it left {{to him to}} speak, 'from <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> Let it rest there. What I have said, was <b>said</b> to <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> only.' 'Oh!' returned the old man. 'From your mother? Take it from your mother? Well! But your mother mentioned that you had been suspecting your father. That's not dutiful, Mr Arthur. Who will you be suspecting next?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{you will}} thank {{me one of}} these days for your secure home,' <b>said</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> 'If these rogues {{continue}} disaffected, who knows what they may leave us in England!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will meet}} other boys there, good and bad," [...] <b>said</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> who sat {{clasping}} and unclasping her hands. [...] "Be very careful, dear, how you choose your companions." ...|$|E

60|$|HITHERTO I have <b>said</b> {{little about}} <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> and I may {{even seem to}} have {{regarded}} that lady {{in the light of}} a temporary convenience. My readers will, however, already have guessed that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> was no common character.|$|R
5000|$|Goldstein Love's {{first novel}} was The Passion of Tasha Darsky, {{originally}} titled Overture (Doubleday, 2007), about the contentious relationship {{between mother and}} daughter musicians. Her mother is the novelist and philosopher Rebecca Goldstein, which caused speculation about whether the novel was autobiographical.In response, Goldstein Love <b>said,</b> “Interestingly, <b>my</b> <b>mother’s</b> relationship with me is nothing like this. First of all, Tasha is nothing like <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> She’s this incredibly ambitious, incredibly driven woman. <b>My</b> <b>mother’s</b> ambitious, but not like that." ...|$|R
6000|$|They {{went into}} the parlour <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> had come from, {{the fire in the}} best room {{on the other side of}} the passage not being lighted--not having been lighted, indeed, since my father's funeral; and when they were both seated, and Miss Betsey <b>said</b> nothing, <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> after vainly trying to {{restrain}} herself, began to cry. 'Oh tut, tut, tut!' said Miss Betsey, in a hurry. 'Don't do that! Come, come!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Isn't he," [...] <b>said</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> [...] "the Earl of Slumgold's cousin?" [...] She knew he was; it was {{an entirely}} {{irrelevant}} and unnecessary remark, but still, something to say.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Walter, {{your father}} never {{had such a}} chance as this!" [...] <b>said</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> when she had read the note of terms and had handed it back to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush! Do not tremble and cry so {{much for}} me. I am not worthy of these tears," [...] <b>said</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> kissing my hands. [...] "I dread one person very much." ...|$|E
6000|$|Fred's spirit {{could not}} bear this: rising and looking at Mr. Featherstone, he <b>said,</b> [...] "Shall <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and I leave the room, sir, {{that you may be}} alone with your friends?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How can he go skittering {{about all}} over the world in this way?" [...] asked William McEldowney, and Sam McKinley <b>said</b> to <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> [...] "I swear, I don't see how you and Dick ever raised such a boy. He's a 'sport,'--that's what he is, a freak." [...] To all of which mother {{answered}} only with a silent laugh.|$|R
