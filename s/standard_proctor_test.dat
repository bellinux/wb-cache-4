There were larger and heavier compaction equipment, like large vibratory compactors and heavier steel-face rollers. This equipment could produce higher dry densities in soils along with greater stability. These improved properties {{allowed for the}} transport of far heavier truck loads over roads and highways.

40|$|This {{laboratory}} test is performed {{to determine the}} relationship between the moisture content and the dry density of a soil for a specified compactive effort. The compactive effort is the amount of mechanical energy that is applied to the soil mass. Several different methods are used to compact soil in the field, and some examples include tamping, kneading, vibration, and static load compaction. This laboratory will employ the tamping or impact compaction method using the type of equipment and methodology developed by R. R. Proctor in 1933, therefore, the test is also known as the Proctor test. Two types of compaction tests are routinely performed: (1) The <b>Standard</b> <b>Proctor</b> <b>Test,</b> and (2) The Modified Proctor Test. Each of these tests can be performed in three different methods as outlined in the attached Table 1. In the <b>Standard</b> <b>Proctor</b> <b>Test,</b> the soil is compacted by a 5. 5 lb hammer falling a distance of one foot into a soil filled mold. The mold is filled with three equal layers of soil, and each layer is subjected to 25 drops of the hammer. The Modified Proctor Test is identical to the <b>Standard</b> <b>Proctor</b> <b>Test</b> except it employs, a 10 lb hammer falling a distance of 18 inches, and uses five equal layers of soil instead of three. There are two types of compaction molds used for testing. The smaller type is 4 inches in diameter and has a volume of about 1 / 30 ft 3 (944 cm 3), and the larger type is 6 inches in diameter and has a volume of about 1 / 13. 333 ft 3 (2123 cm 3). If the larger mold is used each soil layer must receive 56 blows instead of 25 (See Table 1) ...|$|E
30|$|Both the FLL {{standards}} and industry practice in Germany {{are designed to}} rule out compaction from point of installation.

Further, {{in the case of}} EGR substrates delivered by silo trucks (which compromise particle size distribution due to shattering) (Roth-Kleyer, 2006), the FLL (2008) recommends maintaining the prescribed granulometric distributions by including greater proportions of large particles into those blends. In addition to the FLL, EGR system and/or substrate providers will often calculate substrate volume for installation using ‘settlement factors’ of between 1.1 and 1.25, depending on the substrate (e.g., ZinCo GmbH, 2013, p. 15).|$|E

40|$|The {{physical}} {{performance of}} the mineral components in seals of landfill sites was investigated with special reverence to clayey substrates. As a main feature of these sealing substrates the interfering aspect {{of the formation of}} pore structures, which are caused by mechanical processes as well as by hydraulic processes, is the limiting factor using these seals in practice. During the seal installation primary interaggregate pores are closed by mechanical consolidation while the subsequent hydraulic consolidation causes a new formation of secondary interaggregate pores or shrinkage cracks, respectively. Both, primary and secondary interaggregate pores are macropores and decrease the efficiency of seals. With a new developed Proctor Test mineral substrates with varying consistency were stressed by mechanical forces as well as by hydraulic forces, which leads to the states of equal mechanical (Ea) and hydraulic (h) consolidation energies, expressed in Ea- and Ea-h-isoenergetics. The volume of primary and secondary interaggregate pores, important for the sealing quality of the clayey substrates, can be concluded from these isoenergetics for different water contents. The water content of German seal compounds has to meet the <b>standard</b> <b>Proctor</b> <b>Test</b> (DIN 18127) at application time. In contrast to the newly introduced Proctor Test the <b>standard</b> <b>Proctor</b> <b>Test</b> simulate only mechanical consolidation processes. Considering the hydraulic consolidation processes as well, the appropriate water content of mineral substrates with plastic properties is reduced. For the examined clays with medium and strong consistency this amounts in about 7 weight-% below the plastic limit of Atterberg.

The laser scanning provides highly consistent results when compared with those obtained from Standard Proctor compaction tests.

Likely, this limit varies from soil to soil and therefore the technique must be calibrated before being used to determine bulk densities and derived volumetric properties (i. e., porosity or void ratio).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the effects of drying on the strength gain of masonry sand stabilized with a co-product from wood pulping called calcium lignosulfonate. Lignin is an amorphous polymer found in plant cell walls. It provides protection against disease and allows the transport of water and nutrients. Adhesive properties of lignin generated interest in adding its modifications to soils as means to prevent erosion from wind and vehicle traffic on unpaved roads. Lignin has the potential to become a more sustainable alternative to traditional stabilizers because its source is renewable and abundant, and its toxicity is negligible.

The experimental program consisted of performing <b>Standard</b> <b>Proctor</b> <b>Tests</b> to determine maximum densities and optimum moisture contents for mixes having different gravimetric lignin contents and direct shear tests on selected sample configurations.

The compaction technique applied on the subgrade road layer for cohesive soil is by using roller compactor machine (static technique) while the technique that is applied in the laboratory is by dynamic compaction method. Thus, a new laboratory compaction method has been developed to determine the density, shear strength, and CBR values by using Standard Static Packing Pressure (SSPP) efforts in order to close the gap between laboratory and field data. In this study seven (7) types of soil based on plasticity chart were tested in several tests to obtain the important engineering parameter such as density (pd), water content (wc), shear strength (Cu), compaction energy (E) and CBR value of soils.

Rice husk is a major agricultural waste in Malaysia and the common disposal method of open burning has notoriously contributed to environmental pollution.

Comparison of the results shows that the proposed models are highly accurate and robust in predicting permeability and compaction characteristics of soils. Results from sensitivity analysis indicate that the models trained from experimental data have been able to capture many physical relationships between soil arameters. The proposed models are also able to represent the degree to which individual contributing parameters affect the maximum dry density, optimum moisture content, and permeability...|$|R
40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{investigation was}} carried out to primarily study the unsaturated shear behaviour of loosely compacted fills. The soil used was a colluvial fill of volcanic nature and the soil samples were initially compacted to a dry density of 70 % of the maximum dry density obtained from the <b>standard</b> <b>Proctor</b> compaction <b>test.</b> Two series of triaxial tests were conducted. The first series were consolidated undrained shear tests on saturated samples and the second series were constant water content tests on unsaturated samples. From the test results, a nonlinear shear strength-matric suction relationship is observed for the loosely compacted unsaturated volcanic fill. The frictional characteristic of the fill is independent of matric suction while {{the extent of the}} increase in the shear strength with matric suction is influenced by the degree of saturation...|$|R
