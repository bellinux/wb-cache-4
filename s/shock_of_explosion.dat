60|$|Dave {{ran to the}} end of the office, where a {{telephone}} rested on a stand. The <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> the <b>explosion</b> had severed the wires.|$|R
60|$|In {{the first}} place, it is a fact, testified to {{by some of}} the best-known men of science, that the <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> the <b>explosion</b> {{extended}} appreciably right round the world, and seventeen miles, (some say even higher!) up into the heavens.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} his {{monoplane}} fell nearly edgewise with her nose down, {{and seemed to}} hesitate whether to overset altogether. He stood on his wind-shield, wrenching the wheel that swayed up over his head. And then the <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> the second <b>explosion</b> took his machine sideways.|$|R
60|$|It was {{not without}} a feeling of awe that Nat and the four sailors stepped on to {{the deck of the}} brigantine, for {{although}} he was convinced that had a match been lighted the explosion would have taken place long before, as it was now five-and-twenty minutes since the crew had deserted her, neither he nor the men had entirely recovered from the severe <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> the <b>explosion.</b> He led the way below; all was quiet; the door of the magazine was open, but there was no smell of burning powder, and they entered fearlessly.|$|R

50|$|The Osprey {{class are}} {{a series of}} coastal minehunters {{designed}} to find, classify, and destroy moored and bottom naval mines from vital waterways. They use sonar and video systems, cable cutters and a mine detonating device that can be released and detonated by remote control. The Osprey class are the worlds second largest minehunters (surpassed by the Royal Navys 60 m s) to be constructed entirely of fiberglass and designed to survive the <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> underwater <b>explosions.</b> Their primary mission is reconnaissance, classification, and neutralization of all types of moored and bottom mines in littoral areas, harbors and coastal waterways.|$|R
50|$|Of the {{men that}} went down into the mine and survived the explosion, a few stepped forward to share their {{experience}} during the explosion. Jacob Milz was a track layer who was positioned in the first car behind the cart motor. After feeling the <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> the <b>explosion,</b> Milz left the cart and crawled through the thickening smoke to the “G vein” where there was good circulation of air. Once {{he arrived at the}} G vein, he led the survivors with him on the rescue attempt. The majority of those injured, but not killed, were evacuated in an hour.|$|R
60|$|By {{a miracle}} he had escaped {{being struck by}} the flying {{splinters}} of iron, and, thanks to his strong heart, had escaped being killed by the <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> the <b>explosion.</b> Not {{until the end of}} five minutes of mad struggling, in which he behaved {{for all the world like}} a beheaded chicken, did he find life tolerable again. The maximum of stifling and of agony passed, and, although he was still weak and giddy, he tottered in the direction of the house and of Nalasu. And there was no house and no Nalasu--only a debris intermingled of both.|$|R
5|$|Initial {{assessments}} of Belfasts damage showed that, while the mine had done little direct {{damage to the}} outer hull, causing only a small hole directly below one of the boiler rooms, the <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> the <b>explosion</b> had caused severe warping, breaking machinery, deforming the decks and causing the keel to hog (bend upwards) by three inches. On 4 January 1940 Belfast was decommissioned to Care and Maintenance status, becoming the responsibility of Rosyth Dockyard, and her crew dispersed to other vessels. By 28 June she had been repaired sufficiently to sail to Devonport, arriving on 30 June {{under the command of}} Lt Cdr H W Parkinson.|$|R
50|$|She was the 11th ship of the 12 Osprey-class coastal mine hunters, {{which are}} named for birds of prey. Osprey class are the worlds largest mine hunters to be {{constructed}} entirely of fiberglass {{and designed to}} survive the <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> underwater <b>explosions.</b> Ravens primary mission was reconnaissance, classification, and neutralization {{of all types of}} moored and bottom mines in littoral areas, harbors and coastal waterways. She is equipped with a high definition, variable-depth sonar, and a remotely operated, robotic submarine (referred to as a Mine Neutralization Vehicle) used to neutralize mines. As of September 2000, Raven had been forward deployed to Manama, Bahrain. The ship was previously homeported in Ingleside, TX.|$|R
6000|$|It {{cannot be}} said that we who {{occupied}} {{the centre of the}} advance were a cheerful band. Orme, although so far he had borne up, was evidently very ill from the <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> the <b>explosion,</b> so much so that men had to be set on each side of him to see that he did not fall from the saddle. Also he was deeply depressed by the fact that honour had forced us to abandon Higgs to what seemed a certain and probably a cruel death; and if he felt thus, what was my own case, who left not only my friend, but also my son, in the hands of savage heathens? ...|$|R
60|$|The figure vanished. There was a flash {{behind the}} broken {{window and the}} <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> an <b>explosion.</b> For a moment the hovel was filled with light; then it tottered and {{a cloud of smoke}} rolled about the falling walls. Blocks of hard clay splashed in the creek and fell about the marsh. The smoke cleared and Carrie saw the dabbin had gone. A pile of rubbish, round which thin vapor drifted, marked the spot it had occupied. A man stood {{on the end of the}} ridge of high ground, his bent figure {{outlined}} against the sky, holding up his arms as if in protest. Then he vanished, and Jim and the others started silently for Langrigg.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir, we {{have been}} pretty busy, you see. We cut down all the cactus hedges round the huts {{high up on the}} hill, so as to keep the pirates from working down and making a fresh attack upon us. As to the other houses, I have given strict orders that no one is to enter them. The men have piled arms and are lying down by them; many of them have not {{completely}} recovered from the <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> the <b>explosion,</b> and all are bruised more or less by being hurled on to the rocks or against the guns. I fancy the doctor will have his hands full for many a day." ...|$|R
25|$|Contrary to Japanese Shinyo motorboats, MT boats, though very {{dangerous}} {{to use in}} combat, were not designed as suicide weapons: The pilot, installed over the transom had a crude ejector seat and after bailing out, the seat acted as a miniature raft to keep the pilot {{out of the water}} and immune from the lethal <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> the underwater <b>explosion.</b> Another very innovative design was the Isotta-Fraschini Z-drive transmission system, featuring an inboard engine and twin outboard contra-rotating propellers.|$|R
50|$|Evacuation plans cited {{numbers of}} at least 25,000 evacuees. Further {{problems}} arose with the tectonically unstable Red Sea Rift located just 450 km away from the blast site on which the <b>shock</b> waves <b>of</b> the <b>explosions</b> would not have remained without result. Also salinization or outright contamination of groundwater had to be counted among the problems created by the saltwater Qattara sea. This groundwater {{is vital to the}} oases of Bahariya and Siwa.|$|R
25|$|Alerted by {{the convoy}} flagship, whose radio {{operator}} reported having felt the <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> an underwater <b>explosion</b> at about 2045, {{search and rescue}} efforts over the succeeding three days turned up only some wreckage, clearly identified as coming from Tampa, and a single unidentified body. Three bodies were later recovered, two from a beach near Lamphey, Wales, and the other at sea by a British patrol boat. Tampa was struck from the Navy list as of the date of her sinking.|$|R
5000|$|Late in 1852 {{or early}} in 1853 he {{suggested}} a hollow-based bullet for the Enfield rifle, expanding without a plug. It was brought {{out with the}} assistance of Robert Taylor Pritchett, who was awarded £1,000, by government for the invention on its adoption by the small-arms committee. In 1854, Metford investigated the disturbance of the barrel by the <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> the <b>explosion,</b> which affects the line of flight of the bullet, a difficulty which had led to much misunderstanding. In 1857, the select committee found his form of explosive rifle bullet the best of those submitted to them, and in 1863 it was adopted by government. In March 1869, however, it was declared obsolete in accordance with the resolution of the St. Petersburg convention against the employment of such missiles in warfare.|$|R

25|$|In March 1843 Clarke told Wakefield {{the company}} would need to pay £1500 to the Port Nicholson Maori to {{adequately}} compensate them for land {{that had not been}} properly alienated. As Wakefield continued to stall the process, Maori frustration grew and in August they sent a deputation to Spain—who had by then opted to suspend hearings and move on to investigate the Taranaki claims—accusing him of colluding with the company to delay payments. Acting governor Shortland demanded that Wakefield state definitively if {{the company would}} pay or not, and Wakefield—possibly spurred into action by the <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> the <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> violence in the Wairau Affray in June, sparked by a land claim there—relented and agreed to continue negotiations. The company, however, continued to state that all pā, cultivations and burial grounds should be included in any settlements. Knowing a proper resolution was impossible, Spain closed correspondence and in late August returned to Auckland, where he prepared a report for new Governor Robert FitzRoy on his work to date.|$|R
50|$|Later, some ships survived mine blasts, limping into port with buckled {{plates and}} broken backs. This {{appeared}} {{to be due to}} a new type of mine, detecting ships by their proximity to the mine (an influence mine) and detonating at a distance, causing damage with the <b>shock</b> wave <b>of</b> the <b>explosion.</b> Ships that had successfully run the gauntlet of the Atlantic crossing were sometimes destroyed entering freshly cleared British harbours. More shipping was being lost than could be replaced, and Churchill ordered the intact recovery of one of these new mines to be of the highest priority.|$|R
6000|$|The {{first person}} to recover inside the stockade was Belarab himself. Mechanically he murmured the exclamation of wonder, [...] "God is great," [...] and looked at Lingard. But Lingard was not looking at him. The <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> the <b>explosion</b> had robbed him of speech and movement. He stared at the Emma blazing in a distant and {{insignificant}} flame under the sinister shadow of the cloud created by Jorgenson's mistrust and contempt {{for the life of}} men. Belarab turned away. His opinion had changed. He regarded Lingard no longer as a betrayed man but the effect was the same. He was no longer a man of any importance. What Belarab really wanted now was to see all the white people clear out of the lagoon as soon as possible. Presently he ordered the gate to be thrown open and his armed men poured out to take possession of the Settlement. Later Tengga's houses were set on fire and Belarab, mounting a fiery pony, issued forth to make a triumphal progress surrounded by a great crowd of headmen and guards.|$|R
500|$|On 6April, four Beaufort torpedo-bombers {{attacked}} Gneisenau in port. Only one of {{the aircraft}} attacked successfully; the hit did significant damage to the ship. Gneisenau shipped some [...] of water, which caused her to list 2° and settle lower in the water. The <b>shock</b> force <b>of</b> the <b>explosion</b> also did {{a great deal of}} internal damage; fuel tanks were ruptured and electrical systems were damaged. A salvage tugboat was brought alongside to assist in flood control. Gneisenau was put into dry dock for repairs, which were prolonged by further British air raids. On the night of 9–10 April, British high-level bombers attacked both Gneisenau and Scharnhorst. The latter escaped unscathed, but the former was struck four times; 72men were killed and another 90were wounded.|$|R
40|$|The {{composition}} of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) presents strong similarities {{to the standard}} (cosmic) composition, but also noticeable differences, the most important being the high isotopic ratio of Ne 22 /Ne 20 which is about 5 times higher in GCR than in the Sun. This ratio provides key information on the GCR origin. We investigate the idea that GCR are accelerated by the forward <b>shocks</b> <b>of</b> supernova <b>explosions,</b> as they run through the presupernova winds of the massive stars and through the interstellar medium. We use detailed wind and core yields of rotating and non-rotating models of massive stars with mass loss, as well as simple models for the properties <b>of</b> the forward <b>shock</b> and <b>of</b> the circumstellar medium. We find that the observed GCR Ne 22 /Ne 20 ratio can be explained if GCR are accelerated only during the early Sedov phase, for shock velocities > 1500 - 1900 km/s. The acceleration efficiency {{is found to be}} of the order of 1. e- 6 - 1. e- 5, i. e. a few particles out of a million encountered by the shock escape the SN at GCR energies. We also show quantitatively that the widely publicized idea that GCR are accelerated in superbubbles fails to account for the high Ne 22 /Ne 20 ratio in GCRComment: 13 pages, 9 figures, accepted in Astronomy and Astrophysic...|$|R
5000|$|I have closely {{examined}} the original discs and photographed the grooves {{at the point}} <b>of</b> the <b>explosion.</b> You can see several deep digs in the lacquer before the groove disappears. Then almost immediately there is a faint groove for about two revolutions while Charlie Nehlsen gently lowered the cutting {{head back to the}} disc. Fortunately the cutting stylus never cut through the lacquer to the aluminum base. If that had happened the most dramatic part of the recording would not have been made because the stylus would have been ruined. The digs and the bouncing off of the cutting head were caused by the <b>shock</b> wave <b>of</b> the <b>explosion</b> which reached the machine just after Morrison said [...] "It burst into flames&hellip;"I and several others believe that the originals were recorded slightly slow, and that all replays have been at too fast a speed. Comparison with the now two other known contemporary recordings of Morrison demonstrate this conclusion.|$|R
5|$|Early in the Savage's career, squadrons would {{typically}} deploy a detachment to Naval Air Station Port Lyautey, Morocco, {{for service}} with the Sixth Fleet and fly the bombers aboard aircraft carriers {{that were already}} deployed to the Mediterranean as needed. The plan was that the Savages would then be loaded with atomic bombs already aboard the carriers and launched once the carriers were in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. The tactic to deliver the bombs was to fly at low level through Bulgaria and Romania before climbing at maximum power to the proper altitude to release the bomb. The aircraft would then perform a wingover maneuver and dive to low altitude, keeping {{the tail of the}} aircraft aimed at the target to avoid serious damage from the <b>shock</b> wave <b>of</b> the <b>explosion.</b>|$|R
40|$|Mild {{traumatic}} brain injury (mTBI) caused by blast shock waves (BSWs) {{is one of the}} most common injuries among soldiers in the war. Such mTBI can also happen in civilians if exposed to <b>shock</b> waves <b>of</b> accidental <b>explosion</b> disasters, bomb attacks by terrorists and so on. This injury often results in cognitive problems, memory dysfunction and emotional disorder, and these neurological deficits are closely related to the dysfunction or disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The present paper discusses mainly the relationship between dysfunction or disruption of BBB and inflammatory reaction in mild brain injury associated with explosive shock wave and effects of early intervention of oxidative stress injury, repairing the BBB and blocking inflammation on relieving delayed neurological deficits.

50|$|On 6 April, four Beaufort torpedo-bombers {{attacked}} Gneisenau in port. Only one of {{the aircraft}} attacked successfully; the hit did significant damage to the ship.

2500|$|At 19:20 that night, a major {{air attack}} began while {{the task force}} was under way off Kwajalein. At 23:22, {{parachute}} flares from Japanese planes silhouetted the carrier, and 10 minutes later, she {{was hit by a}} torpedo on the starboard side, knocking out her steering gear. Nine people were killed, two on the fantail and seven in the chief petty officers' mess room, which was a repair party station during general quarters. Four members of the affected repair party survived because they were sitting on a couch that apparently absorbed the <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> the <b>explosion.</b> Settling [...] by the stern, the carrier began circling to port amidst dense clouds of smoke pouring from ruptured tanks aft. To maintain water-tight integrity, damage control crews were ordered to seal the damaged compartments and welded them shut, applying heavy steel plates where needed. An emergency hand-operated steering unit was quickly devised, and Lexington made Pearl Harbor for emergency repairs, arriving on 9 December. She reached Bremerton, Washington, on December 22 for full repairs, completed on February 20, 1944. The error in judgment concerning opening fire at night was never repeated, as thereafter gun crews were ordered to open fire anytime the ship came under attack. Following this attack, the ship was reported as sunk by Japan's Tokyo Rose, the first of several such assertions.|$|R
40|$|Most {{cosmic rays}} {{are thought to}} be {{accelerated}} by the <b>shocks</b> <b>of</b> supernova <b>explosions</b> <b>of</b> very massive stars. Here we review one quantitative proposal, which predicted the spectral slopes, bend and cutoff about the cosmic ray spectrum across the spectral bend or "knee" near 3 x 10 ^ 15 eV in 1993. Many of the specific predictions have now been verified, and so it may be appropiate to investigate the consequences of that proposal. The successful fit to the cosmic ray data across the knee suggests: 1) very massive stars, above about 20 to 25 solar masses all converge to a common final state; 2) the supernova <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> these very massive stars is caused by a combination of rotation, magnetic fields and the gravitational potential, just as proposed by G. Bisnovatyi-Kogan in 1970, based on an earlier suggestion by N. S. Kardashev in 1964; 3) their stellar winds as well as the explosion provide the main injection of magnetic fields into the interstellar medium; 4) the explosive energy of these supernovae is about 10 ^ 52 erg; 5) the explosion is extremely anisotropic, which may unify several classes of observed supernova types; 6) gamma ray bursts may be the ultimate version <b>of</b> such an <b>explosion</b> in the case the collapse leads to a black hole; 7) it is plausible that the luminosity of the supernova integrated over all aspect angles is also the same for all these massive star explosions, leading to 8) a possibly very bright standard candle, if we could just find a correction for the extreme asphericity. This may solve the problem of what the mechanism <b>of</b> supernova <b>explosions</b> is for very massive stars, where most cosmic rays and magnetic fields come from, and may also point the way to a unifying scheme for supernova explosions and gamma ray bursts.

500|$|In January 1951, Ulam {{had another}} idea: to channel the {{mechanical}} <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> a nuclear <b>explosion</b> {{so as to}} compress the fusion fuel. [...] On the recommendation of his wife, Ulam discussed this idea with Bradbury and Mark before he told Teller about it. Almost immediately, Teller saw its merit, but noted that soft X-rays from the fission bomb would compress the thermonuclear fuel more strongly than mechanical shock and suggested ways to enhance this effect. [...] On 9 March 1951, Teller and Ulam submitted a joint report describing these innovations. [...] A few weeks later, Teller suggested placing a fissile rod or cylinder {{at the center of}} the fusion fuel. [...] The detonation of this [...] "spark plug" [...] would help to initiate and enhance the fusion reaction. [...] The design based on these ideas, called staged radiation implosion, has become the standard way to build thermonuclear weapons. It is often described as the [...] "Teller–Ulam design".|$|R
60|$|I {{had put up}} the {{wireless}} mast above the conning-tower, and had no difficulty in calling up Captain Stephan. He was lying, he said, off Ventnor and {{had been unable to}} reach his station, on account of engine trouble, which he had now set right. Next morning he proposed to block the Southampton approach. He had destroyed one large Indian boat on his way down Channel. We exchanged good wishes. Like myself, he needed rest. I was up at four in the morning, however, and called all hands to overhaul the boat. She was somewhat up by the head, owing to the forward torpedoes having been used, so we trimmed her by opening the forward compensating tank, admitting as much water as the torpedoes had weighed. We also overhauled the starboard air-compressor and one of the periscope motors which had been jarred by the <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> the first <b>explosion.</b> We had hardly got ourselves shipshape when the morning dawned.|$|R
50|$|For {{extraordinary}} heroism in {{the line}} of his profession above and {{beyond the call of duty}} at the risk of his life, as second in command of a Guardia Nacional Patrol on 24 April 1932, engaged, at the time, in active operations in the field against armed bandit forces in the vicinity of Constancia, near Coco River, Department of Jinotega, Northern Nicaragua,. While the patrol was in formation on the trail searching for a bandit group, with which contact had just previously been had, a rifle grenade fell from its carrier, carried by a member of the patrol, and struck a rock, igniting the detonator. Several men of the patrol were in close proximity of the grenade at the time. Corporal Truesdale, who was several yards away at the time, could easily have sought cover and safety for himself but instead, knowing full well the grenade would explode within two or three seconds, and with utter disregard for his own personal safety, and at the risk of his own life, rushed for the grenade, grasped it in his right hand and attempted to throw it away from the patrol before it exploded. The grenade exploded in his hand, blowing it off and inflicting serious multiple wounds about his body. Corporal Truesdale, by his actions, took the full <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> the <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> the grenade upon himself, thereby saving the lives of, or serious injury to, his comrades in arms.
