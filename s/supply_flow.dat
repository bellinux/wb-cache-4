25|$|Diving helmet squeeze: Helmet squeeze {{will occur}} if the gas supply hose is severed above the diver and the {{non-return}} valve at the helmet gas inlet fails {{or is not}} fitted. Severity {{will depend on the}} hydrostatic pressure difference. A very rapid descent, usually by accident, may exceed {{the rate at which the}} breathing gas supply can equalise the pressure causing a temporary squeeze. The introduction of the non-return valve and high maximum gas <b>supply</b> <b>flow</b> rates have all but eliminated both these risks. In helmets fitted with a neck dam, the dam will admit water into the helmet if the internal pressure gets too low; this is less of a problem than helmet squeeze but the diver may drown if the gas supply is not reinstated quickly. This form of barotrauma is avoidable by controlled descent rate, which is standard practice for commercial divers, who will use shotlines, diving stages and wet bells to control descent and ascent rates.|$|E

40|$|Fluidics {{flow control}} of a {{multiphase}} supply using a cylindrical chamber is achieved by introducing the <b>supply</b> <b>flow</b> radially into the chamber. The <b>supply</b> <b>flow</b> exits through a port in the center at the chamber. A control fluid is then introduced tangentially about 90. degree. upstream from the supply port. A second control fluid port may be added about 90. degree. upstream from the first control fluid port, but preferably two sets of supply and control ports are added with like ports diametrically opposite each other. The control fluid flows against the circular wall of the control chamber, which introduces a vortex {{in the flow of}} the <b>supply</b> <b>flow</b> that decays into a spiral path to the exit port {{in the center of the}} chamber.

40|$|Since fluidic {{devices have}} not {{mechanical}} movable parts, {{it is well}} known that one of the most distinguishing characters of these devices is that they are not influenced by mechanical vibration, but it can be thought that some effects are created by mechanical vibration so long as the behaviours of these devices depend on a dynamical motion. Then, in this paper, an experimental research is performed by vibrating some wall attachment amplifiers with pentagonal splitter to three directions, parallel to the main jet flow (Y-direction), parallel to the vented flow (X-direction), perpendicular to both the main jet and the vented flow (Z-direction). Air is used as working fluid and the frequency is varied from 0 to 50 Hz. From the results of this experiment, it becomes clear as follows;　 1) The recovery pressure is not affected by mechanical vibration. 　 2) Switching time is affected by the direction of vibration. The effect of vibration to X- and Z- direct 1 on is comparatively remarkable in the case of a small quantity of both a <b>supply</b> <b>flow</b> and a control pressure, but it almost vanishes as the <b>supply</b> <b>flow</b> and / or the control pressure increases. 　Further experimental research is performed by changing the size of devices.
