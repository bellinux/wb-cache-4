500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Suga Mama" [...] was released to British music channels in April 2007. It {{was shot in}} black-and-white and was co-directed by Melina Matsoukas alongside Knowles for the B'Day Anthology Video Album, which was released the same month; [...] "Suga Mama" [...] was one of eight videos shot in two weeks for the video album. It begins with Knowles sitting in a chair, wearing men's clothing and smoking a cigar. <b>She</b> <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> and begins to pole dance. The remainder of the video presents Knowles dancing {{on top of a}} sugar cube, dancing with backing dancers whose faces are partially concealed, lying in a circle of light, and riding a mechanical bull. Knowles said she is meant to [...] "slowly become a woman" [...] during the video, adding [...] "Well, a sexier woman – I'm always a woman." ...|$|E

500|$|The video commences with Lee {{lying on}} a black {{background}} while lip-syncing the lyrics of the song, with shots of fellow members and the singer drawing lines with a light in her hand being seen. Following this, <b>she</b> <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> {{off the ground and}} starts creating grass around her with the light previously shown. Subsequently, she is portrayed drawing stars and walking through the world she has created. The next scene sees the singer playing the piano in a room with a small window, which Lee then touches to break and to illuminate the screen with white light. According to James Montgomery of MTV News, at the end, [...] "she eventually realizes that, in spite of her attempts, she is just as trapped as she was before [...] At [...] clip's end, the viewer is left to wonder whether she has the power to escape [...] which, in a way, only further connects the video to the song itself." ...|$|E

500|$|Angelou {{describes}} her writing process as regimented. [...] Beginning with Caged Bird, she {{has used the}} same [...] "writing ritual" [...] for many years. <b>She</b> <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> at {{five in the morning}} and checks into a hotel room, where the staff has been instructed to remove any pictures from the walls. [...] She writes on legal pads while lying on the bed, with a bottle of sherry, a deck of cards to play solitaire, Roget's Thesaurus, and the Bible, and leaves by the early afternoon. [...] She averages 10–12 pages of material a day, which she edits down to three or four pages in the evening. [...] Angelou goes through this process to [...] "enchant" [...] herself, and as she said in a 1989 interview with the BBC, to [...] "relive the agony, the anguish, the Sturm und Drang". She places herself back in the time she is writing about, even during traumatic experiences like her rape in Caged Bird, to [...] "tell the human truth" [...] about her life. [...] Angelou has stated that she plays cards to reach that place of enchantment, to access her memories more effectively. She has stated, [...] "It may take an hour to get into it, but once I'm in it—ha! It's so delicious!" [...] She does not find the process cathartic; rather, she has found relief in [...] "telling the truth".|$|E

500|$|The video {{starts with}} a news anchor (played by Kristina Mitchell) saying {{the title of the}} song above a news banner that reads [...] "Britney Spears song lyrics spell out {{obscenity}} in disguise". This is a parody of an America's Newsroom report by Megyn Kelly. It then skips to a house, in which a sex party is coming to an end. Spears starts singing while {{sitting on the edge of}} a bed while the people that surround her are getting dressed. <b>She</b> <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> and looks out the window. As the first verse ends, she picks up a pair of panties from the floor, recalling her personal struggles and the [...] "Piece of Me" [...] video. She dances with four male dancers in the first chorus. During the second chorus, she dances with four other female dancers dressed in cheerleading outfits, while many men are watching them dance. The screen fades to white and Spears begins to change into a conservative '50s-inspired housewife outfit. As the chorus begins again, she comes out of her bedroom. She walks down the stairs, with dancers surrounding her and a woman gives her a potholder, which she uses to pick up a pie. After this, she walks out the front door of the house and is joined by her seemingly conservative-looking husband and children, one of them dressed with the schoolgirl outfit Spears wore in the [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] video. As they go down the walkway, they are surrounded by paparazzi, who have no idea what goes on behind closed doors. While the kids and husband wave, Spears smiles for the camera and blows a kiss. The video then ends with the news anchor saying, [...] "Doesn't make any sense, does it?".|$|E
