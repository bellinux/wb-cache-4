40|$|Abstract — Stand-alone Solar Photovoltaic {{system is}} very popular in {{off-grid}} areas of Bangladesh. But recently the government is encouraging the use of solar electricity in urban areas too. Now-a-days people have to use solar systems to get electricity connection in newly completed buildings to meet certain percentage of their electricity demand. The solar electricity is stored in battery and then inverted to alternating current for use. These batteries can also be charged from the power line electricity. In this paper a light dependent switch is designed for the efficient use of solar systems. The light <b>sensitive</b> <b>switch</b> automatically charges the battery from power line after sunset, if the battery is not fully charged.

DNA looping, which is a common means of regulating transcription, {{is very much a}} stochastic process; the loops arise from the thermal motion of the DNA and other fluctuations of the cellular environment. We present single-molecule measurements of DNA loop formation and breakdown when an artificial fluctuating force, applied to mimic a fluctuating cellular environment, is imposed on the DNA. We show that loop formation is greatly enhanced in the presence of noise of only a fraction of $k_B T$, yet find that hypothetical regulatory schemes that employ mechanical tension in the DNA [...] as a <b>sensitive</b> <b>switch</b> to control transcription [...] can be surprisingly robust due to a fortuitous cancellation of noise effects...|$|E

Both p and n-layers are Bragg-reflectors. The front mirror of the AFPR is made slightly polarisation dependent using a subwavelength grating etched in the top layer of the p-type reflector stack. We calculate the polarisation dependent overall absorption (photocurrent) and reflection of the device and model the steady state behaviour and polarisation induced switching properties, for an electroabsorption coefficient that increases linearly with applied voltage. Using a standard load-line analysis we show that changing the input polarisation (at constant intensity) from TE to TM can lead to a dramatic decrease or increase in overall reflectivity...|$|E

Recent studies disclosed a protein network {{that controls the}} level of one lipid – cholesterol. This network resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

The ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) regulates feeding and anxiety, but how these are controlled in a concerted manner remains unclear.

Acute alteration of SF 1 neuronal activity alters food intake via changes in appetite and feeding-related behaviors, including locomotion, exploration, anxiety, and valence. In turn, intrinsic SF 1 neuron activity is low during feeding and increases with both feeding termination and stress.

By generating Ras nanoclusters {{in direct proportion to}} ligand input, cells build an analogue-digital analogue circuit relay that transmits a signal across the plasma membrane with high fidelity. Signal transmission is completely dependent on Ras spatial organization and fails if nanoclustering is abrogated. A requirement for high-fidelity signalling may explain the non-random distribution of other plasma membrane signalling complexes...|$|R
40|$|Spumaviruses, {{commonly}} called foamy viruses (FV), are complex retroviruses that establish lifelong persistent infections without any accompanying pathologies. In tissue culture, cells {{can be either}} lytically or latently infected, depending on cell type. Regulation of FV replication is controlled by two promoters: the LTR and a second promoter within the env gene termed the internal promoter (IP). The IP directs expression of the transcriptional activator, Tas, and a second accessory protein, Bet, whose function has been elusive. In this study, we report that expression of exogenous Tas is sufficient to initiate a switch from latent to lytic replication. We also show that treatment with the phorbol ester phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA) can {{lead to an increase}} in transcription from the IP, and that Bet protein expression abrogates this effect. Finally, we demonstrate that Bet expression severely limits the ability of PMA to activate transcription of latent FV genomes, and that replication of a Bet(-) virus is more easily activated than wild-type FV. Taken together, these data suggest that viral transcription is regulated by a <b>sensitive</b> <b>switch,</b> and that Bet functions as a negative regulator of basal IP activity...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{cooperative}} interactions in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes between Scap, cholesterol, and Insig result in switch-like control over activation of SREBP- 2 transcription factors. This allows cells to rapidly adjust rates of cholesterol synthesis and uptake in response to even slight deviations from physiological set-point levels, thereby ensuring cholesterol homeostasis. In the present study we directly probe for the accessibility of cholesterol in purified ER membranes. Using a soluble cholesterol-binding bacterial toxin, perfringolysin O, we show that cholesterol accessibility increases abruptly at ∼ 5 mol % ER cholesterol, the same concentration at which SREBP- 2 activation is halted. This switch-like change in cholesterol accessibility is observed not only in purified ER membranes but also in liposomes made from ER lipid extracts. The accessibility of cholesterol in membranes is related to its chemical activity. Complex formation between cholesterol and some ER phospholipids can result in sharp changes in cholesterol chemical activity and its accessibility to perfringolysin O or membrane sensors like Scap. The control of the availability of the cholesterol ligand to participate in cooperative Scap/cholesterol/Insig interactions further sharpens the <b>sensitive</b> <b>switch</b> that exerts precise control over cholesterol levels in cell membranes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Calcium {{oscillations}} suppress mitochondrial movements {{along the}} microtubules to support on-demand distribution of mitochondria. To activate this mechanism, Ca(2 +) targets a yet unidentified cytoplasmic factor {{that does not}} seem to be a microtubular motor or a kinase/phosphatase. Here, we have studied the dependence of mitochondrial dynamics on the Miro GTPases that reside in the mitochondria and contain two EF-hand Ca(2 +) -binding domains, in H 9 c 2 cells and primary neurons. At resting cytoplasmic [Ca(2 +) ]([Ca(2 +) ](c)), movements of the mitochondria were enhanced by Miro overexpression irrespective of the presence of the EF-hands. The Ca(2 +) -induced arrest of mitochondrial motility was also promoted by Miro overexpression and was suppressed when either the Miro were depleted or their EF-hand was mutated. Miro also enhanced the fusion state of the mitochondria at resting [Ca(2 +) ] c but promoted mitochondrial fragmentation at high [Ca(2 +) ] c. These effects of Miro on mitochondrial morphology seem to involve Drp 1 suppression and activation, respectively. In primary neurons, Miro also caused an increase in dendritic mitochondrial mass and enhanced mitochondrial calcium signaling. Thus, Miro proteins serve as a [Ca(2 +) ](c) - <b>sensitive</b> <b>switch</b> and bifunctional regulator for both the motility and fusion-fission dynamics of the mitochondria...|$|E

The published article can be found at: [URL] surface adhesion of cells {{is one of the}} early pivotal steps in bacterial biofilm formation, a prevalent adaptation strategy in response to changing environments. In Pseudomonas fluorescens, this process is regulated by the Lap system and the second messenger cyclic-di-GMP. High cytoplasmic levels of cyclic-di-GMP activate the transmembrane receptor LapD that in turn recruits the periplasmic protease LapG, preventing it from cleaving a cell surface-bound adhesin, thereby promoting cell adhesion. In this study, we elucidate the molecular basis of LapG regulation by LapD and reveal a remarkably <b>sensitive</b> <b>switching</b> mechanism that is controlled by LapD's HAMP domain. LapD appears to act as a coincidence detector, whereby a weak interaction of LapG with LapD transmits a transient outside-in signal that is reinforced only when cyclic-di-GMP levels increase.

40|$|ABSTRACT ParB {{proteins}} bind centromere-like DNA sequences called parS {{sites and}} {{are involved in}} plasmid and chromosome segregation in bacteria. We previously showed that the opportunistic human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae contains four parS sequences located close to the origin of replication which are bound by ParB. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we found here that ParB spreads out from one of these parS sites, parS(1. 6 °), for more than 5 kb and occupies the nearby comCDE operon, which drives competence development. Competence allows S. pneumoniae to take up DNA from its environment, thereby mediating horizontal gene transfer, and is also employed as a general stress response. Mutating parS(1. 6 °) or deleting parB resulted in transcriptional up-regulation of comCDE and ssbB (a gene belonging to the competence regulon), demonstrating that ParB acts as a repressor of competence. However, genome-wide transcription analysis showed that ParB is not a global transcriptional regulator.

40|$|Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) {{have emerged}} as {{critical}} factors in many biological processes, but {{little is known about}} how their regulatory functions evolved. One of the best-studied lncRNAs is TER, the essential RNA template for telomerase reverse transcriptase. We previously showed that Arabidopsis thaliana harbors three TER isoforms: TER 1, TER 2 and TER 2 S. TER 1 serves as a canonical telomere template, while TER 2 is a novel negative regulator of telomerase activity, induced in response to double-strand breaks (DSBs). TER 2 contains a 529 nt intervening sequence that is removed along with 36 nt at the RNA 3 ' terminus to generate TER 2 S, an RNA of unknown function. Here we investigate how A. thaliana TER 2 acquired its regulatory function. Using data from the 1, 001 Arabidopsis genomes project, we report that the intervening sequence within TER 2 is derived from a transposable element termed DSB responsive element (DRE). DRE is found in the TER 2 loci of most but not all A. thaliana accessions. By analyzing accessions with (TER 2) and without DRE (TER 2 Δ) we demonstrate that this element is responsible for many of the unique properties of TER 2, including its enhanced binding to TERT and telomerase inhibitory function. We show that DRE destabilizes TER 2, and further that TER 2 induction by DNA damage reflects increased RNA stability and not increased transcription. DRE-mediated changes in TER 2 stability thus provide a rapid and <b>sensitive</b> <b>switch</b> to fine-tune telomerase enzyme activity. Altogether, our data shows that invasion of the TER 2 locus by a small transposon converted this lncRNA into a DNA damage sensor that modulates telomerase enzyme activity in response to genome assault...|$|E

40|$|The {{secretion}} of vesicles for intracellular transport often {{relies on}} the aggregation of specialized membrane-bound proteins into a coat able to curve cell membranes. The nucleation and growth of a protein coat is a kinetic process that competes with the energy-consuming turnover of coat components between the membrane and the cytosol. We propose a generic kinetic description of coat assembly {{and the formation of}} coated vesicles and discuss its implication to the dynamics of COP vesicles that traffic within the Golgi and with the endoplasmic reticulum. We show that stationary coats of fixed area emerge from the competition between coat growth and the recycling of coat components, in a fashion resembling the treadmilling of cytoskeletal filaments. We further show that the turnover of coat components allows for a highly <b>sensitive</b> <b>switching</b> mechanism between a quiescent and a vesicle producing membrane, upon a slowing down of the exchange kinetics. We claim that the existence of this switching behavior, also triggered by factors, such as the presence of cargo and variation of the membrane mechanical tension, allows for efficient regulation of vesicle secretion. We propose a model, supported by different experimental observations, in which vesiculation of secretory membranes is impaired by the energy-consuming desorption of coat proteins, until the presence of cargo or other factors triggers a dynamical switch into a vesicle producing state...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of Ca 2 +-dependent protein-protein interaction and enzyme activation by calmodulin was investigated with the phosphoprotein phosphatase, calcineurin. Dimethylaminonaphthalene (dansyl) -calmodulin, a fluorescent derivative {{used to monitor}} complex formation, produced similar maximal activation (10 - to 12 -fold) with a Ca 2 + dependence (Ka = 17 microM) identical to that of native calmodulin. The Ca 2 +-dependent increase in fluorescence intensity of dansyl-calmodulin was enhanced 100 - 150 % by calcineurin, indicating complex formation; the concentration of Ca 2 + required for a half-maximal increase in fluorescence was the same (K 1 / 2 approximately equal to 7 microM) with and without calcineurin. Since the Ca 2 + concentration required for activation appeared to differ from that necessary for protein-protein interaction, a method was devised to measure both the formation of complexes between dansyl-calmodulin and calcineurin and enzyme activity in the same samples. Direct comparison of interaction (measured by polarization of fluorescence) and enzyme activity demonstrated different Ca 2 + requirements for the two events. Whereas dansyl-calmodulin-calcineurin interaction, measured {{in the presence of}} phosphoprotein substrate, exhibited very little cooperativity (Hill coefficient = 1. 2, Ca 2 + concentration required for the half-maximal increase in fluorescence, K 1 / 2, approximately equal to 6 microM), phosphatase activation was highly cooperative (Hill coefficient = 3. 5) and required 3 times higher Ca 2 + concentration for half-maximal stimulation. Equivalent results were obtained with p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate. These data are consistent with a sequential mechanism for interaction and activation wherein filling of perhaps two Ca 2 + sites permits calmodulin interaction with the phosphatase; this complex is inactive, requiring further binding of Ca 2 + for activation. Such a scheme would provide a <b>sensitive</b> <b>switch</b> for control of enzyme activity within a narrow range of free Ca 2 + concentration...|$|E

40|$|Glioblastoma multiforme is {{the most}} {{aggressive}} form of primary brain tumour occurring in adults. Despite aggressive multimodal therapy which includes surgery, radiation and chemotherapy it remains largely incurable and patients have a mean survival time of 12 [...] 14 months. Therefore the need for improved therapeutic strategies is imperative. Identifying molecular mechanisms involved {{in the development and}} progression of glioblastoma will not only improve our overall understanding of the disease but also identify potential targets that may be exploited therapeutically. The phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) pathway is often constitutively active in glioblastoma tumours due to overexpression and mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor, and deletion/loss of function of the tumour suppressor PTEN. The atypical protein kinase Cs (PKCiota (iota) and PKCzeta (zeta)) {{have been shown to be}} activated downstream of PI 3 K and contribute to the malignant phenotype of several types of human cancers, including lung and colon cancer. However they have not been studied in glioblastoma. Our analysis identified that glioblastoma cell lines express PKCiota and have no detectable PKCzeta. PKCiota is activated in glioblastoma cells and its protein expression is increased compared to normal human astrocytes. To study the role of PKCiota in glioblastoma cells RNA interference was used to specifically reduce its expression. Depletion of PKCiota in glioblastoma cells decreased their proliferation, motility and invasiveness and partially enhanced their sensitivity to cisplatin-induced cell death. To identify potential mechanisms through which PKCiota promotes these malignant characteristics gene expression microarray analysis was performed on U 87 MG glioblastoma cells depleted of PKCiota. This analysis identified that PKCiota affects many classes of genes involved in a variety of cellular processes. Within the set of genes that were negatively regulated by PKCiota, glia maturation factor beta (GMFbeta) and ras homology family member B (RhoB) were investigated further. GMFbeta has been shown to enhance p 38 MAPK activation and signaling. The p 38 MAPK pathway has been previously identified as a key mediator of cisplatin cytotoxicity. Our results demonstrate that PKCiota suppresses cisplatin-induced p 38 MAPK activation causing an enhancement in resistance through the repression of GMFbeta. Overexpression of GMFbeta in glioblastoma cells causes an enhancement of p 38 MAPK activation and cell death in response to cisplatin treatment. PKCiota was also found to repress the expression of RhoB, which unlike its other Rho family members functions in the repression of tumourgenicity. Examination of RhoB repression by PKCiota showed that this significantly increases the motility and invasiveness of glioblastoma cells as overexpression of RhoB decreased these properties. Additionally, our results have identified a mutually antagonistic relationship between PKCiota activity and RhoB expression that may be a <b>sensitive</b> <b>switch</b> between a motile and non-motile phenotype. Lastly, live cell imaging of glioblastoma cells stably depleted of PKCiota revealed that it is involved in the dynamics of leading edge formation and plays a role in mitosis. This work has demonstrated that inhibiting PKCiota may be a useful therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma, either alone or in combination with other treatment modalities, such as chemotherapy or radiation, to improve the poor patient outcomes associated with this disease...|$|E

The expected primary amine products, N-desmethyldesipramine, (S) -norfluoxetine, and N,N-didesmethyldiltiazem, are also observed. The formation of metabolic-intermediate (MI) complexes from these substrates and metabolites was examined. In each example, the initial rates of MI complex accumulation followed the order secondary hydroxylamine > secondary amine ≫ primary amine, {{suggesting that the}} primary amine metabolites do not contribute to formation of MI complexes from these secondary amines. Furthermore, the primary amine metabolites, which accumulate in incubations of the secondary amines, inhibit MI complex formation. Mass balance studies provided estimates of the product ratios of N-dealkylation to N-hydroxylation. The ratios were 2. 9 (DES-CYP 2 C 11), 3. 6 [(S) -FLX-CYP 2 C 19], and 0. 8 (MA-CYP 3 A 4), indicating that secondary hydroxylamines are significant metabolites of the P 450 -mediated metabolism of secondary alkyl amines.

We have explored the design compromises for developing high-Q cavities and developed new geometries for <b>sensitive</b> low-threshold optical <b>switches</b> and spectroscopy sources. In this talk, we {{will review the}} design, fabrication and characterization of optical cavities defined within photonic crystals...|$|R
