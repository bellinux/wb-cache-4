25|$|On June 2, 1952, the Supreme Court {{handed down}} its decision. In Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952)—a {{landmark}} {{case on the}} scope of presidential powers—the Court ruled that the president lacked the authority to seize the steel mills. The Court <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> had no authority under the Constitution to seize private property during national emergency. Absent a declaration of war, the President required Congressional authorization to seize the steel mills, and this the chief executive lacked.|$|E
25|$|A {{military}} official {{loyal to the}} President <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> was in good health, and that the Interior and the Defense Ministers were also safe – contrary to earlier reports that the defense minister had been arrested. Foreign Minister Soumeylou Boubeye Maiga was among several ministers arrested after rebels seized the Presidential palace {{and other parts of}} the capital. Amnesty International reported that Prime Minister Cissé Mariam Kaïdama Sidibé had been arrested, and that the detained ministers were being held at the military camp in Kati.|$|E
25|$|In April 2009, President Ma {{became the}} first ROC {{president}} to pay homage in person to the Yellow Emperor who {{is believed to have}} founded China as a nation more than 5,000 years ago. Accompanied by all his government leaders, the president sang the ROC's national anthem as the starter. Ma's spokesman <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> wanted to pay his respects to the Yellow Emperor on National Tomb-Sweeping Day in person to stress the importance of the Chinese ancestor-worshipping tradition. However, others saw the precedent-making ceremonies at the Martyrs' Shrine as meant to be a show by President Ma of his unprofessed commitment to maintain a close relationship between Taiwan and mainland China.|$|E
50|$|The {{court martial}} was {{supposed}} to get underway on 12 October but the proceedings had to be cancelled after prison officials failed to deliver the soldiers facing trial. On 19 October, when the court martial was scheduled to convene, Leung was abruptly dismissed without by President Ratu Josefa Iloilo. The military's Legal Services Director, Major Kitione Tuinaosara, <b>said</b> that <b>the</b> <b>President</b> wanted to appoint his own Judge Advocate. The military had done their part by appointing the Court Martial panel, Tuinaosara <b>said,</b> and <b>the</b> onus was on <b>the</b> <b>President</b> to check <b>the</b> panel before approving it. He had not done so, Tuinaosara <b>said.</b> <b>The</b> <b>President's</b> actions effectively adjourned the trial indefinitely.|$|R

25|$|On December 12, 2016, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was {{critical}} of Trump's rejection {{of the idea that}} Russia used cyberattacks to influence the election. Earnest contrasted Trump's comments on Twitter with the October 2016 conclusions of the U.S. Intelligence Community. At a subsequent White House press conference on December 15, Earnest said Trump and the public were aware prior to the 2016 election of Russian interference efforts, calling these undisputed facts. United States Secretary of State John Kerry spoke on December 15, 2016, about President Obama's decision to approve the October 2016 joint statement by the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Kerry stated the president's decision was deliberative and relied upon information cautiously weighed by the intelligence agencies. He <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> felt a need to warn the U.S. public and did.|$|E
500|$|But {{there was}} also {{speculation}} over how long Reagan had demonstrated symptoms of mental degeneration. Not long after the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan, at a reception for mayors, Reagan greeted his Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Samuel Pierce in 1981 by saying [...] "How are you, Mr Mayor? How are things in your city?" [...] Former CBS White House correspondent Lesley Stahl recounted that, in her final {{meeting with the president}} in 1986, Reagan did not seem to know who Stahl was, and that she came close to reporting that Reagan was senile, {{but at the end of}} the meeting, Reagan had regained his alertness. However, Dr. Lawrence K. Altman, a physician employed as a reporter for The New York Times, noted that [...] "the line between mere forgetfulness and the beginning of Alzheimer's can be fuzzy," [...] and all four of Reagan's White House doctors said that they saw no evidence of Alzheimer's while he was president. Dr. John E. Hutton, Reagan's primary physician from 1984 to 1989, <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> [...] "absolutely" [...] did not [...] "show any signs of dementia or Alzheimer's." [...] His former Chief of Staff James Baker considered [...] "ludicrous" [...] the idea that Reagan slept during cabinet meetings. Other staff members, former aides, and friends said they saw no indication of Alzheimer's while he was president. Reagan did experience occasional memory lapses, though, especially with names. Reagan's doctors say that he only began exhibiting overt symptoms of the illness in late 1992 or 1993, several years after he had left office. For example, Reagan repeated a toast to Margaret Thatcher, with identical words and gestures, at his 82nd-birthday party on February 6, 1993.|$|E
2500|$|The Reagan Administration {{actively}} {{sought to}} diminish Israel's voice and {{influence over the}} deal. In public speeches, Administration officials admonished Israel for getting involved in a U.S. foreign policy matter. Secretary of State Alexander Haig <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> must be [...] "free of the restraints of overriding external vetoes," [...] {{and went on to}} say that were the AWACS deal blocked by Israeli influence, there would be [...] "serious implications on all American policies in the Middle East. ... I'll just leave it there." [...] Reagan himself declared, [...] "It is not the business of other nations to make American foreign policy." ...|$|E

He noted that he {{supported}} Obama in 2008, but <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>president's</b> tenure in <b>the</b> Oval Office thus far had been a disappointment. Wilder did not endorse Mitt Romney, the Republican challenger, and later said that he hoped for an Obama victory despite having gone to a Romney fundraiser.|$|R
2500|$|As {{chief of}} the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) mission Luc Van den Brande {{said at a news}} conference in Moscow the {{elections}} were not fair, including the [...] "unprecedented" [...] example of a president still in office running in parliamentary elections. Van den Brande <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> and his office had exerted an [...] "overwhelming" [...] influence on the campaign, and also criticized flaws in the secrecy of the vote. [...] "If Russia has managed democracy, then these were managed elections," [...] he said, and warned: [...] "While we are happy that there was the fall of the (Berlin) Wall, we don't want to have a new dividing line in Europe in terms of democracy." ...|$|E
2500|$|President Nixon and his administration's public {{reaction}} to the shootings was perceived {{by many in the}} anti-war movement as callous. Then National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> was [...] "pretending indifference". Stanley Karnow noted in his Vietnam: A History that [...] "The [...] administration initially reacted to this event with wanton insensitivity. Nixon's press secretary, Ron Ziegler, whose statements were carefully programmed, referred to the deaths as a reminder that 'when dissent turns to violence, it invites tragedy.'" [...] Three days before the shootings, Nixon had talked of [...] "bums" [...] who were antiwar protestors on United States campuses, to which the father of Allison Krause stated on national TV [...] "My child was not a bum." ...|$|E
2500|$|The coup was co-ordinated by General Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, {{former chief}} of staff of the Mauritanian Army and head of the presidential guard, who had {{recently}} been fired. Mauritania's presidential spokesman, Abdoulaye Mamadouba, <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>President,</b> Prime Minister, and Interior Minister had been arrested by renegade Senior Mauritanian army officers and were being held under house arrest at the presidential palace in the capital. In the apparently successful and bloodless coup, Abdallahi's daughter, Amal Mint Cheikh Abdallahi, said: [...] "The security agents of the BASEP (Presidential Security Battalion) came to our home and took away my father." [...] The coup plotters, all dismissed in a presidential decree shortly beforehand, included Abdel Aziz, General Muhammad Ould Al-Ghazwani, General Philippe Swikri, and Brigadier General (Aqid) Ahmad Ould Bakri.|$|E

The Hong Kong Cavaliers also appeared in these early drafts, but, according to Richter, [...] "it never really went to a completed script. Mac wrote and wrote but never wrote the end". Another early draft was entitled The Strange Case of Mr. Cigars, about a huge robot {{and a box of}} Hitler's cigars. Mac Rauch shelved his work for a few years while he wrote New York, New York for Martin Scorsese and other un-produced screenplays.|$|E

European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy sent a joint message to Erdoğan on his landslide election victory in Sunday's polls.

[...] Shortly after, the White House <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> regretted use of the term crusade, as it might have been misunderstood as reference to the historical Crusades; the word crusade was not used again. On 20 September 2001, during a televised address to a joint session of Congress, George Bush said, [...] "Our war on terror begins with al Qaeda, but it does not end there.
