500|$|Neil Gaiman {{had written}} an episode, {{but it was}} pushed to the next series due to budget {{constraints}} and was replaced with [...] "The Lodger" [...] instead. [...] "The Lodger" [...] was adapted from a comic strip {{of the same name}} writer Gareth Roberts had done for Doctor Who Magazine, although he said most of it started [...] "from scratch" [...] The story was inspired by wishing to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> in normal, every-day human circumstances, as well as Roberts' enjoyment of stories set on Earth rather than in space. Roberts was interested in doing a television version of the story, but he never mentioned it. However, Moffat was a fan of the comic story and immediately asked to adapt it into an episode when he became showrunner.|$|E

He reveals that he too was given an envelope, but does not know who sent it to him. Reluctantly his companions decide not to tell the Doctor either about his death or that the sender was his future self. The four do a search on Delaware and [...] "Space 1969." [...] The TARDIS travels back to 8 April 1969, and ends up cloaked in the Oval Office.

The Doctor quickly gains Delaware's trust, convincing Nixon {{to give him a}} few minutes to locate the girl.|$|E

At the same time, Tony Prolo has gone to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> and stops by the florist to get a white rose for his flower-loving son. After he purchases the rose, his path crosses with Mr. Sears and the detective at the street corner, and he is arrested because he is carrying a white rose.

500|$|Zap2it's Sam McPherson {{gave the}} series an A {{and thought it}} was the show's strongest series since its revival in 2005. He praised Smith and Gillan, though he noted that Amy did not have much {{character}} development, and considered Darvill [...] "might just {{be one of the best}} actors on television currently". However, he noted that most of the episodes took place on Earth or spaceships, and wished to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor,</b> Amy and Rory [...] "branch out more in the future". Dave Golder of SFX gave the series four out of five stars, noting that it looked [...] "very promising" [...] though [...] "there was a tentative, slightly awkward feel to the series", similar to the first series. He also labelled Smith as [...] "magnificent" [...] and Gillan as [...] "lovely, although so far Amy's character has been so dictated by the requirements of the arc plot that it's difficult to feel that we've really got to know her yet".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{marked the}} debut of Christopher Eccleston, the ninth actor to play the Doctor since the {{programme}} started in 1963, and Billie Piper as Rose Tyler, the Doctor's companion. Being the first episode of the revived series, several lead characters were introduced; Camille Coduri as Jackie Tyler, and Noel Clarke as Mickey Smith. Viewers did not <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> character regenerate from a previous incarnation; regeneration being a plot device in which {{the character of the}} Doctor changes body and identity. Russell T Davies felt it would be clearer for the viewer to begin the series with the new actor in place rather than show the previous actor regenerating. [...] "Rose" [...] began filming in Cardiff, the headquarters of BBC Wales, in July 2004, with some location scenes shot in London. [...] "Rose" [...] was viewed by 10.81 million viewers in the UK, the most viewed Doctor Who episode since The Creature from the Pit in 1979 (making it the first episode in over 25 years); and received positive reviews from critics, though there were some criticisms of its use of humour.|$|E

The angry mob goes to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor,</b> who claims the bag was sold. The bones end up belonging to [...] "Mr. Tippy", a dog that belonged to Terri. Scully gets upset over a joke Mulder makes and tells him she's returning to Washington. Margi and Terri celebrate their birthday and Brenda uses a Ouija board to know who she will marry; everyone thinks it's Scott before the planchette veers away from the C and spells out Satan. Upset, Brenda rushes to the bathroom where Margi and Terri are chanting [...] "Bloody Mary" [...] and is locked in, killed by glass from a shattered mirror. Detective White heads to Mulder's hotel room because she found a box which inside had her cat's collar, and then she attempts to seduce Mulder but they are interrupted by Scully who informs them about Brenda's death. Terri and Margi try to console Scott, who tells them off. Turned down, Terri is mad at him but Margi still likes him and leaves.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Bioscope from December 22, 1910. It states: [...] "Max, an old musician, {{finds it hard to}} support his two motherless daughters, one of whom is blind, and the professor takes great pride in his daughter's musical education. The little one sings and the blind girl plays upon the violin. But sickness and death overtake the professor, and the orphans find themselves penniless and homeless. They are compelled to sing in the streets, and thus eke out a precarious livelihood. While walking through a fashionable street one day Marie sees the sign of the famous doctor. She calls her blind sister's attention to it, but the girl has no hope that the doctor will see penniless patients. Marie returns in time to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> alight from his carriage, but the servant refuses to allow the ragged little girl to follow him. Marie conceives the idea of hiding in the doctor's carriage, and when he sets out on his rounds he discovers the terrified little girl. She pleads with him not to be angry, and tells of her sister's affliction. The doctor goes with her to see Violet, and has the stricken girl taken to a hospital, where he operates successfully upon her eyes. Mr. Grey brings Violet to the attention of some charitable women, who see that she does not lack professional engagements. While returning from one of her recitals, Dr. Grey offers to drive her home, and proposes to Violet, and is accepted. Marie is awakened by the sound of a kiss, and is told that she is to have a big brother." ...|$|E

2500|$|Malcolm Hulke {{said of the}} character, and his {{relationship}} with the Doctor: [...] "There was a peculiar relationship between the Master and the Doctor: one felt that the Master wouldn't really have liked to eliminate the Doctor...you <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> was the only person like him at the time in the whole universe, a renegade Time Lord and in a funny sort of way they were partners in crime." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the chapel, Cecilia {{tells him}} that she was one of Massigny's many women and still loves him. She {{requests}} that Massigny be represented by one of the candles on the altar. After being rebuffed by Davenne, Cecilia breaks off the relationship and he breaks down. He locks himself away at home, refusing to eat, to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor,</b> or talk. The managing editor of [...] "The Globe", recommends that Cécilia write him a letter. She finally declares her love, knowing he would never reciprocate, [...] "because to be loved by you, I should be dead". Having forgiven Massigny, Davenne joins her in the chapel, but he is weakened, falls to the ground and dies. Cécilia completes the work, as she had asked the first time, dedicating one last candle to Julien Davenne.|$|E
2500|$|The Independent Police Conduct Authority {{launched}} a wider {{investigation into the}} treatment {{of young people in}} police cells and in October 2012 issued a report which found that the number of young people being held has more than doubled since 2009. It said that [...] "youths in crisis are being locked up in police cells and denied their human rights." [...] Practices that [...] "are, or risk being, inconsistent with accepted human rights" [...] include: being held in solitary confinement; having cell lights on 24 hours a day; family members being prevented access; and not being allowed to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> when they have medical or mental health problems.

2500|$|Burgess was invalided home in 1959 and {{relieved}} {{of his position}} in Brunei. He {{spent some time in}} the neurological ward of a London hospital (<b>see</b> <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> is Sick) where he underwent cerebral tests that found no illness. On discharge, benefiting from a sum of money which Lynne Burgess had inherited from her father, together with their savings built up over six years in the East, he decided to become a full-time writer. The couple lived first in an apartment in Hove, near Brighton. They later moved to a semi-detached house called [...] "Applegarth" [...] in Etchingham, approximately a mile from the Jacobean house where Rudyard Kipling had lived in Burwash, and one mile from the Robertsbridge home of Malcolm Muggeridge. Upon the death of Burgess's father-in-law, the couple used their inheritance to decamp to a terraced town house in Chiswick. This provided convenient access to the White City BBC television studios where he later became a frequent guest. During these years Burgess became a regular drinking partner of the novelist William S. Burroughs. Their meetings took place in London and Tangiers.|$|E
