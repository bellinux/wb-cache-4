5|$|The {{mechanism}} of the Saegusa–Ito oxidation involves coordination of palladium to the enol olefin followed by loss of the <b>silyl</b> <b>group</b> and formation of an oxoallyl-palladium complex. β-hydride elimination yields the palladium hydride enone complex which upon reductive elimination yields the product along with acetic acid and Pd0. The reversibility of the elimination step allows equilibration, leading to the thermodynamic E-selectivity in acyclic substrates. It {{has been shown that}} the product can form a stable Pd0-olefin complex, which may be responsible for the difficulty with re-oxidation seen in catalytic variants of the reaction.|$|E

40|$|The {{formation}} and the thermal stability of <b>silyl</b> (SiH 3) <b>groups</b> on Si(1 0 0) surfaces was investigated by mass spectrometry. <b>Silyl</b> <b>groups</b> were prepared either by adsorption and decomposition of disilane (Si 2 H 6) on clean Si(1 0 0), or by using thermal hydrogen atoms to generate silicon hydride <b>groups.</b> The <b>silyl</b> coverage decreases with increasing temperature during disilane or H atom exposure. Maximum silyl coverages of 0. 15 and 0. 12 ML, respectively, were obtained after disilane or H atom saturation exposures at 110 K. On saturated Si(1 0 0) surfaces, i. e., in absence of dangling bonds, <b>silyl</b> <b>groups</b> are stable up to 500 K; above 500 K {{the formation of}} silane (SiH 4) via disproportionation, -SiH 3 (a) + SiH 2 (a) [...] > SiH 4 (g) + SiH(a), was observed. In the presence of dangling bonds, <b>silyl</b> <b>groups</b> decompose toward SiH, and SiH groups, even at 110 K. The abstraction of adsorbed silyl by impinging hydrogen atoms, -SiH 3 (a) + H(g) [...] > SiH 4 (g), was investigated in the temperature range from 110 to 800 K by in situ mass spectrometry. Silane was the sole product observed. The silyl abstraction probability increases {{by a factor of}} 6 with increasing substrate temperature between 110 and 500 K, indicating an apparent activation energy of 12. 5 kJ mol(- 1), which can be discussed in terms of an increased reaction probability of vibrationally excited <b>silyl</b> <b>groups.</b> The regeneration of <b>silyl</b> <b>groups</b> by impinging hydrogen atoms was identified as the rate limiting step of the hydrogen induced etching of silicon under steady-state conditions.

50|$|Unlike the Tamao {{oxidation}} whose {{starting material}} is an activated heteroatom-substituted <b>silyl</b> <b>group,</b> the Fleming oxidation utilizes a more robust <b>silyl</b> <b>group</b> which has only carbon atoms {{attached to the}} silicon atom. The prototype silyl structure that Fleming used was dimethylphenylsilyl. This aryl silane is then converted to the more reactive halo- or heterosilane to initiate the oxidation. The mechanism of the two-pot sequence differs from the Tamao oxidation since the reagents are different. First, an electrophile attacks the phenyl ring in the ipso position to give a beta-carbocation that is stabilized by the silicon group. A heteroatom then attacks the silicon group, which allows the phenyl ring to leave, in a key step referred to as protodesilylation of the arylsilane. The alkyl group undergoes 1,2 migration from the silicon to the oxygen atom. Aqueous acid mediated Hydrolysis and subsequent workup yield the desired alcohol. It is difficult to prevent small resulting silyl-alcohols from dehydrating to form siloxanes.|$|E
5000|$|Electrophilic {{additions}} of allylsilanes generally occur via an anti SE2' process. Allylsilanes react {{through a}} conformation {{in which the}} smallest substituent on the carbon attached to silicon is essentially eclipsing the double bond. The silyl moiety forces electrophilic attack on the face opposite the <b>silyl</b> <b>group</b> for steric and electronic reasons, although the effects are not large. This model predicts that when the double bond is 1,2-disubstituted, the Z isomer should exhibit greater selectivity than the E isomer, {{and this has been}} observed(5)Vinylsilane additions proceed with retention of double bond configuration, and follow a similar principle. After addition of the electrophile to the top or bottom face of the double bond, the silyl moiety rotates to become parallel to the adjacent empty 2p orbital. The principle of least motion provides that the electrophile moves into a position close to that formerly occupied by the <b>silyl</b> <b>group.</b> Thus, the configuration of the double bond is retained after loss of the silyl group.(6) ...|$|E
