40|$|Background and aims: Smartphones allow {{users to}} access social {{networking}} sites (SNSs) whenever and wherever they want. Such easy availability and accessibility may increase their vulnerability to addiction. Based on the social cognitive theory (SCT), we examined the impacts of outcome expectancies, self-efficacy, and impulsivity on young Chinese smartphone users’ addictive tendencies toward SNSs. Methods: Two hundred seventy-seven Macau young smartphone users (116 males and 161 females; mean age = 26. 62) filled out an online Chinese questionnaire concerning their usage of {{social networking sites}} via <b>smartphones,</b> <b>addiction</b> tendencies toward SNSs, impulsivity trait, outcome expectancies toward the use, and Internet self-efficacy.

This study investigated indicators of <b>smartphone</b> use, <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction,</b> and their associations with demographic and health behaviour-related variables in young people. Methods A convenience sample of 1, 519 students from 127 Swiss vocational school classes participated in a survey assessing demographic and health-related characteristics as well as indicators of <b>smartphone</b> use and <b>addiction.</b> <b>Smartphone</b> <b>addiction</b> was assessed using a short version of the <b>Smartphone</b> <b>Addiction</b> Scale for Adolescents (SAS-SV). Logistic regression analyses were conducted to investigate demographic and health-related predictors of <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction.</b> Results <b>Smartphone</b> <b>addiction</b> occurred in 256 (16. 9 %) of the 1, 519 students. Longer duration of smartphone use on a typical day, a shorter time period until first smartphone use in the morning, and reporting that social networking was the most personally relevant smartphone function were associated with <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction.</b> <b>Smartphone</b> <b>addiction</b> was more prevalent in younger adolescents (15 - 16 years) compared with young adults (19 years and older), students with both parents born outside Switzerland, persons reporting lower physical activity, and those reporting higher stress.

In this study, the relationships among <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction,</b> age, gender, and chronotype of German adolescents were examined. Materials and methods Two studies focused on two different measures of <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction.</b> The <b>Smartphone</b> <b>Addiction</b> Proneness Scale (SAPS) was applied to 342 younger adolescents (13. 39 [*]±[*] 1. 77; 176 boys, 165 girls, and 1 not indicated) in Study 1 and the <b>Smartphone</b> <b>Addiction</b> Scale was applied to 208 older adolescents (17. 07 [*]±[*] 4. 28; 146 girls and 62 boys) in Study 2, both samples in southwest Germany. In addition, a demographic questionnaire and the Composite Scale of Morningness (CSM) and sleep measures were implemented. Results The most remarkable result of this study was that morningness–eveningness (as measured by CSM scores) is an important predictor for smartphone addiction; even stronger than sleep duration. Evening oriented adolescents scored higher on both <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction</b> scales. In addition, gender is an important predictor for <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction</b> and girls are more prone to become addicted. In addition, while sleep duration on weekdays negatively predicted SAPS, age, sleep duration on weekends, and midpoint of sleep on weekdays and weekends did not predicted <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction</b> in both scales. The analysis of covariance revealed statistically significant effects of the covariates gender and age in both studies, as well as the main effect of chronotype. According to the t-test results, girls had higher scores than boys in <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction.</b> Conclusion Evening types and girls are more prone to become smartphone addicted...|$|R

A random sample of 688 undergraduate university students (mean age = 20. 64 ± 1. 88 years; 53 % men) completed a survey composed of a) questions about socio-demographics, academics, lifestyle behaviors, personality type, and smartphone use-related variables; b) 26 -item <b>Smartphone</b> <b>Addiction</b> Inventory (SPAI) Scale; and c) brief screeners of depression and anxiety (PHQ- 2 and GAD- 2), which constitute the two core DSM-IV items for major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, respectively. Prevalence rates of smartphone-related compulsive behavior, functional impairment, tolerance and withdrawal symptoms were substantial. 35. 9 % felt tired during daytime due to late-night smartphone use, 38. 1 % acknowledged decreased sleep quality, and 35. 8 % slept less than four hours due to smartphone use more than once. Whereas gender, residence, work hours per week, faculty, academic performance (GPA), lifestyle habits (smoking and alcohol drinking), and religious practice did not associate with <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction</b> score; personality type A, class (year 2 vs. year 3), younger age at first smartphone use, excessive use during a weekday, using it for entertainment and not using it to call family members, and having depression or anxiety, showed statistically significant associations with <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction.</b> Depression and anxiety scores emerged as independent positive predictors of <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction,</b> after adjustment for confounders.

Recent observation has revealed that students now spend excessive time participating in Internet gambling with their smartphone during school period. This trend could have far-reaching consequences on their schoolwork engagement and by extension, academic performance. Drawing on the Dualistic Model of Passion, this study therefore, examined the mediatory role of <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction</b> in the gambling passion—schoolwork engagement relation. A cross-sectional design was adopted. Male undergraduates (N =  278) of a large public university in Nigeria who engage in Internet gambling participated in the study. They completed self-report measures of gambling passion, <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction,</b> and schoolwork engagement. Results showed that harmonious gambling passion was not related to <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction</b> whereas it was positively related to schoolwork engagement. Obsessive gambling passion had positive and negative relations with <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction</b> and schoolwork engagement, respectively. <b>Smartphone</b> <b>addiction</b> was negatively related to schoolwork engagement and mediated only the obsessive gambling passion—schoolwork engagement relation but not that between harmonious gambling passion and schoolwork engagement.

Moreover, its usage can impede physical activity, but the relationship between <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction</b> and physical activity is obscure. Therefore, we examined the relationship {{and the impact of}} excessive smartphone use on physical activity. Methods: This study collected data through the structured questionnaire consisting of general characteristics, the number and hours of smartphone usage, and the <b>Smartphone</b> <b>Addiction</b> Proneness Scale (SAPS) from 110 Chinese international students in Korea. The body composition and physical activity, such as the total daily number of steps and consumed calories, were measured. Results: In this study, high-risk smartphone users showed less physical activity, such as the total number of steps taken and the average consumed calories per day. Moreover, their body composition, such as muscle mass and fat mass, was significantly different. Among these factors, the hours of smartphone use revealed the proportional relationship with <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction</b> (β = 0. 209, p = 0. 026), while the average number of walking steps per day showed a signifi-cant reverse proportional tendency in participants with <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction</b> (β = – 0. 883, p < 0. 001).

40|$|The {{use of the}} {{smartphones}} can be rewarding {{when the}} information it communicates positively alters our expectations. Such rewards strengthen our brain’s impulsive system by reinforcing concomitant behaviors and can give rise to addiction. Such an addiction can lead to depression, work-family conflict, and poor performance. While these adverse effects have raised academic interest into the phenomenon of <b>Smartphone</b> <b>Addiction,</b> we still lack articulated theories that can help us conceptualize it and operationalize the construct. The objective of this dissertation is to elucidate what <b>Smartphone</b> <b>Addiction</b> is and how it affects performance. We start by synthesizing theories underlying addiction and self-control to define and embed the construct. We then use this conceptual foundation to develop a multi-method instrument to measure the construct and to examine its relationship with performance. We focus on a specific mechanism by which it can affect self-control performance. We hypothesize that <b>Smartphone</b> <b>Addiction</b> leads individuals to take more breaks from work, to use their smartphone during these breaks, and that such use negatively affects the replenishment of breaks, carrying adverse consequences for performance at self-control. We test our hypotheses using an experiment, a questionnaire survey, and the experience sampling method. The {{results of the study}} show that while individuals high in <b>Smartphone</b> <b>Addiction</b> are more inclined to take breaks from work, and to use smartphones during these breaks, the effect of these breaks on subsequent self-control performance is not necessarily negative. This dissertation contributes to the literature in various ways. It develops the construct of <b>Smartphone</b> <b>Addiction</b> and embeds it into theories of self-control and addiction. This fundament can be used for other IT-related addictions, given the strong parallels in the use of smartphones and the use of tablets, laptops, and desktop computers. The dissertation also provides a method of measurement to study <b>Smartphone</b> <b>Addiction</b> {{in a way that is}} less prone to the sources of measurement error that are common in the field. In this dissertation, we have used it to take a step to elucidate the adverse consequences of <b>Smartphone</b> <b>Addiction</b> on work habit and self-control performance. These substantive and methodical contributions should pave the way for further inquiry into the phenomenon of IT-related addiction to help individuals and organizations prevent its deleterious effects. published_or_final_versionBusinessDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

In the right end of the distribution of smartphone usage, concepts such as <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction</b> seem warranted. An area that so far lacks research concerns the effect of smartphone restriction generally and specifically on subjective withdrawal related scores across different degrees of smartphone usage. The present study examined withdrawal related scores on the Smartphone Withdrawal Scale (SWS), the Fear of Mission Out Scale (FoMOs) and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) scale during a smartphone restriction period, lasting 72 hours. In all, 127 participants were randomly assigned into one of two conditions; a restricted condition (n= 67) or a control condition (n= 60). During the restriction period, the aforementioned scales were completed three times a day by the participants. The results revealed a significant difference in scores between the restricted condition and the control condition on the SWS. Further, the participants with higher scores on <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction</b> in the restricted condition were, compared to those with lower scores on <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction,</b> significantly more negatively affected by the smartphone restriction condition, according to the SWS and the PANAS (Negative Affect) than those with higher and lower addiction scores in the control condition.

The aims of {{this study}} are to develop diagnostic criteria of <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction</b> and to examine the discriminative ability and the validity of the diagnostic criteria. We developed twelve candidate criteria for characteristic symptoms of <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction</b> and four criteria for functional impairment caused by excessive smartphone use. The participants consisted of 281 college students. Each participant was systematically assessed for smartphone-using behaviors by psychiatrist's structured diagnostic interview. The sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of the candidate symptom criteria were analyzed with reference to the psychiatrists' clinical global impression. The optimal model selection with its cutoff point of the diagnostic criteria differentiating the smartphone addicted subjects from non-addicted subjects was then determined by the best diagnostic accuracy. Six symptom criteria model with optimal cutoff point were determined based on the maximal diagnostic accuracy. The proposed <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction</b> diagnostic criteria consisted of (1) six symptom criteria, (2) four functional impairment criteria and (3) exclusion criteria.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a self-administered scale based on the special {{features}} of smartphone. The reliability and validity of the <b>Smartphone</b> <b>Addiction</b> Inventory (SPAI) was demonstrated. METHODS: A total of 283 participants were recruited from Dec. 2012 to Jul. 2013 to complete a set of questionnaires, including a 26 -item SPAI modified from the Chinese Internet Addiction Scale and phantom vibration and ringing syndrome questionnaire. There were 260 males and 23 females, with ages 22. 9 ± 2. 0 years. Exploratory factor analysis, internal-consistency test, test-retest, and correlation analysis were conducted to verify the reliability and validity of the SPAI. Correlations between each subscale and phantom vibration and ringing were also explored. RESULTS: Exploratory factor analysis yielded four factors: compulsive behavior, functional impairment, withdrawal and tolerance. Test-retest reliabilities (intraclass correlations  = 0. 74 - 0. 91) and internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0. 94) were all satisfactory. The four subscales had moderate to high correlations (0. 56 - 0. 78), but had no or very low correlation to phantom vibration/ringing syndrome.

The concurrent validity was confirmed using SAS, SAPS and KS-scale. Receiver operating characteristics analysis was conducted to suggest cut-off. Results: The 10 final questions were selected using content validity. The internal consistency and concurrent validity of SAS were verified with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0. 911. The SAS-SV was significantly correlated with the SAS, SAPS and KS-scale. The SAS-SV scores of gender (p,. 001) and self-evaluation of <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction</b> (p,. 001) showed significant difference. The ROC analysis results showed an area under a curve (AUC) value of 0. 963 (0. 888 – 1. 000), a cut-off value of 31, sensitivity value of 0. 867 and specificity value of 0. 893 in boys while an AUC value of 0. 947 (0. 887 – 1. 000), a cut-off value of 33, sensitivity value of 0. 875, and a specificity value of 0. 886 in girls...|$|R
40|$|Background and aims: The {{usage of}} {{smartphones}} has increased rapidly in recent years, {{and this has}} brought about addiction. The aim {{of the current study}} was to investigate the relationship between smartphone use severity and sleep quality, depression, and anxiety in university students. Methods: In total, 319 university students (203 females and 116 males; mean age = 20. 5 ± 2. 45) were included in the study. Participants were divided into the following three groups: a smartphone non-user group (n = 71, 22. 3 %), a low smartphone use group (n = 121, 37. 9 %), and a high smartphone use group (n = 127, 39. 8 %). All participants were evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Beck Depres-sion Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory; moreover, participants other than those in the smartphone non-user group were also assessed with the <b>Smartphone</b> <b>Addiction</b> Scale. Results: The findings revealed that the Smartphone Addic-tion Scale scores of females were significantly higher than those of males. Depression, anxiety, and daytime dysfunc-tion scores were higher in the high smartphone use group than in the low smartphone use group. Positive correlations were found between the <b>Smartphone</b> <b>Addiction</b> Scale scores and depression levels, anxiety levels, and some sleep quality scores. Conclusion: The results indicate that depression, anxiety, and sleep quality may be associated with smartphone overuse. Such overuse may lead to depression and/or anxiety, which can in turn result in sleep problems. University students with high depression and anxiety scores should be carefully monitored for <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction...</b>|$|R
40|$|The use of {{smartphone}} {{technology has}} increased drastically {{resulting in a}} risk of addiction to certain web applications, such as social networking sites (SNS) that are easily accessible via smartphones. A major concern regarding {{the increased use of}} SNS sites is the risk of an increase in narcissism amongst users of SNS. The present study examined the relationship between smartphone use, narcissistic tendencies, and personality as predictors of <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction.</b> A self-selected sample of 256 smartphone users (M = 29. 2; SD = 9. 49) completed an online survey. The results revealed that 13. 3 % of the sample was classified as addicted to smartphones. Regression analysis revealed that narcissism, openness, neuroticism, and age were linked to <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction.</b> Therefore, it is suggested that smartphones encourage narcissism, even in non-narcissistic users. Future research requires more in-depth qualitative data, addiction scale comparisons, and comparison of use with, and without, SNS access. Further, it is advised that prospective buyers of smartphones be pre-warned of the potential addictive properties of new technology...|$|R

Additionally, how the classified groups differed in terms of sex and psychosocial traits was examined. Methods: A total of 448 university students (178 males and 270 females) in Korea participated. The participants were given a set of questionnaires examining the severity of their internet and <b>smartphone</b> <b>addictions,</b> their mood, their anxiety, and their personality. Latent class analysis and ANOVA (analysis of variance) were the statistical methods used. Results: Significant differences {{between males and females}} were found for most of the variables (all P< 0. 05). Specifically, in terms of internet usage, males were more addicted than females (P< 0. 05); however, regarding smartphone, this pattern was reversed (P< 0. 001). Due to these observed differences, classifications of the subjects into subgroups based on internet and <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction</b> were performed separately for each sex. Each sex showed clear patterns with the three-class model based on likelihood level of internet and <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction</b> (P< 0. 001). A common trend for psychosocial trait factors was found for both sexes: anxiety levels and neurotic personality traits increased with addiction severity levels (all P< 0. 001). However, Lie dimension was inversely related to the addiction severity levels (all P< 0. 01). Conclusion: Through the latent classification process, this study identified three distinct internet and smartphone user groups in each sex. Moreover, psychosocial traits that differed in terms of addiction severity levels were also examined. It is expected that these results should aid the understanding of traits of internet and <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction</b> and facilitate further study in this field.

40|$|Smartphones {{allow people}} to connect with others from almost {{anywhere}} at any time. However, there is growing concern that smartphones may actually sometimes detract, rather than complement, social interactions. The term “phubbing” represents the act of snubbing someone in a social setting by concentrating on one’s phone instead of talking to the person directly. The current {{study was designed to}} examine some of the psychological antecedents and consequences of phubbing behavior. We examined the contributing roles of Internet addiction, fear of missing out, self-control, and <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction,</b> and how the frequency of phubbing behavior and of being phubbed may both lead to the perception that phubbing is normative. The results revealed that Internet addiction, fear of missing out, and self-control predicted <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction,</b> which in turn predicted the extent to which people phub. This path also predicted the extent to which people feel that phubbing is normative, both via (a) the extent to which people are phubbed themselves, and (b) independently. Further, gender moderated the relationship between the extent to which people are phubbed and their perception that phubbing is normative. The present findings suggest that phubbing {{is an important factor in}} modern communication that warrants further investigation...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{will begin}} by outlining the key {{research that has}} been conducted {{in the area of}} email and <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction</b> in the workplace. Following this, Emma will present results from some of her research (funded by the ESRC and RBT) into strategies for dealing with email at work, and how strategies appear to move from being purposeful – satisfying specified goals – to habitual (automatic) and eventually pathological (or addictive). Delegates will be asked to consider their own use of email – especially within the smartphone era. The session will close with Alison and Emma outlining some of the key strategies that can be adopted by organisations and individuals to improve the management of email at work. Learning Outcomes: 1. 	To become familiar with key research in the areas of email and <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction</b> 2. 	To learn about applied research in the area – conducted at UK organisations, and what this means for our understanding of strategic behaviour 3.

40|$|To translate, {{adapt and}} {{validate}} the <b>Smartphone</b> <b>Addiction</b> Inventory (SPAI) in a Brazilian population of young adults. We employed the translation and back-translation method for {{the adaptation of}} the Brazilian version SPAI (SPAI-BR). The sample consisted of 415 university students. Data was collected through an electronic questionnaire, which consisted of the SPAI-BR and the Goodman Criteria (gold standard). The retests were carried out 10 - 15 days after the initial tests with 130 individuals. The SPAI-BR maintained semantic, idiomatic and conceptual equivalences from the original scale. The Confirmatory Factor Analysis confirmed the One-factor model of the SPAI with good fit indexes (x 2 = 767. 861, CFI = 0. 913, TLI = 0. 905, RMSE = 0. 061, WRMR = 1. 465). The Kuder-Richardson Coefficient showed good internal consistency. The analysis of the ROC curve established an area under the curve of 86. 38 %. The Intraclass-Correlation Coefficient of 0. 926 between the test and the retest demonstrated an excellent temporal stability. The high correlation between SPAI-BR and the Goodman Criteria (rs = 0. 750) established the convergent validity. The SPAI-BR is a valid and reliable tool {{for the detection of}} <b>Smartphone</b> <b>Addiction</b> in Brazilian university students...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of telecom technology has {{a profound impact}} on the lives and activities {{of the people of the}} world. Smartphone usage became popular to young generation because of its educational and entertaining options by using the numerous apps. Among the young people, students are increasingly using Smartphone. But excessive Smartphone usage usually makes the students addicted to that subconsciously impacts on user’s academic performance, daily activities, physical and mental health and withdrawal tendency, and social relationships. This study aims at identifying the factors that affect the level of <b>Smartphone</b> <b>addiction</b> of the students and its impact on their academic performance. A structured questionnaire has been developed to gather data from the students. A total of 247 questionnaires were collected from the business students of a university of Bangladesh. Using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) the data were analyzed. Results revealed five <b>Smartphone</b> <b>addiction</b> factors such as, positive anticipation, impatience and tolerance, withdrawal, daily-life disturbance, and cyber friendship. Tolerance and daily-life disturbance have significant impact on students’ academic performance. This study suggests that the students should minimize the usage of Smartphone for achieving good academic performance...|$|R
40|$|Gaming {{behaviors}} {{have been}} significantly influenced by smartphones. This {{study was designed}} to explore gaming behaviors and clinical characteristics across different gaming device usage patterns {{and the role of the}} patterns on Internet gaming disorder (IGD). Responders of an online survey regarding smartphone and online game usage were classified by different gaming device usage patterns: (1) individuals who played only computer games; (2) individuals who played computer games more than smartphone games; (3) individuals who played computer and smartphone games evenly; (4) individuals who played smartphone games more than computer games; (5) individuals who played only smartphone games. Data on demographics, gaming-related behaviors, and scales for Internet and <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction,</b> depression, anxiety disorder, and substance use were collected. Combined users, especially those who played computer and smartphone games evenly, had higher prevalence of IGD, depression, anxiety disorder, and substance use disorder. These subjects were more prone to develop IGD than reference group (computer only gamers) (B = 0. 457, odds ratio = 1. 579). Smartphone only gamers had the lowest prevalence of IGD, spent the least time and money on gaming, and showed lowest scores of Internet and <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction.</b> Our findings suggest that gaming device usage patterns may be associated with the occurrence, course, and prognosis of IGD...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Smartphone</b> <b>Addiction</b> Inventory (SPAI) was {{developed}} to assess <b>smartphone</b> <b>addiction</b> in Taiwanese university students. The {{purpose of the current}} research is to evaluate the factor structure and psychometric properties of the SPAI in Italian university students. A total of 485 university students (29. 3 % boys) completed the SPAI and the Young's Internet Addiction Test (IAT). The proposed four-factor model of the SPAI-I was tested by computing CFA, and the results of the goodness of fit indices indicated an ambiguous solution. An exploratory-confirmatory cross validation strategy was applied for a better trimming of SPAI-I factorial structure. Results suggested a five-factor solution that explained 53 % of the total variance (Time Spent, Compulsivity, Daily Life Interference, Craving, and Sleep Interference). Excellent internal consistency and five factor correlations were reported for the SPAI-I. This five-factor model showed good convergent validity with the Internet Addiction Disorder Test. Considering that evidence shows that overuse of a smartphone can be associated with adverse and problematic effects, the SPAI-I should be useful for determining its potential for the use in future research in Europe and for comparing the evaluation of smartphone overuse of young European people with other international Asiatic studies that have incorporated the SPAI...|$|R
