5|$|The arrow-head {{design of}} the castle's bastion {{reflected}} new ideas about defensive fortifications spreading out from Italy in the 16th century. Earlier Henrician castles had used the older European style of semi-circular bastions to avoid presenting any weak <b>spots</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stonework, but an arrow-headed design enabled defenders to provide much more effective supporting fire against an attacking force. Yarmouth {{was among the first}} fortifications in Europe, and the first in England, to adopt this design.|$|E

Halos produced by cirrus clouds tend to be more pronounced and colorful than those caused by cirrostratus.|$|E
