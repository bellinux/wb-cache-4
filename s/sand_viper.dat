50|$|Mass {{scenes were}} filmed mainly in Uzbekistan's {{part of the}} Kyzyl Kum Desert. The crew spent nearly five months there, working in very {{difficult}} conditions—at the height of summer, the noon temperature exceeded 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit); {{the temperature of the}} sand, 80 degrees Celsius (176 Fahrenheit). Film stock had to be kept in cold storage. A very vexatious thing was the ubiquitous dust. Every day, 10,000 bottles of mineral water were delivered to the shooting location.

40|$|A {{protein that}} {{inhibits}} the re-uptake of 5 -hydroxytryptamine into rat brain synaptosomes was {{isolated from the}} venom of the Sahara <b>sand</b> <b>viper</b> (Cerastes vipera) by gel filtration and reverse phase chromatography.

It has phospholipase A 2 activity, but it has no lytic activity as measured by its inability to release lactate dehydrogenase from rat brain synaptosomes.

50|$|Vegetation such as Marram Grass is {{essential}} for dunes to work, dominating the stabilised parts of the dunes. Other grasses that grow there include Dune Fescue and Red Fescue. Dogs off leads can easily run around the dunes, and destroy the vegetation. Horses being ridden over the dunes will have a similar effect. The Climping dunes are an SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest). In 2006 {{the total number of}} full species at Climping Gap stood at 256. It supports important populations of wintering birds and the numbers of wintering Sanderling, in particular, are of European significance. Vegetated shingle beaches are a nationally uncommon habitat.

40|$|A kininogenin (EC 3. 4. 21. 8) was {{purified}} {{from the}} venom of Vipera ammodytes ammodytes (European <b>sand</b> <b>viper)</b> {{by a combination}} of gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography. The enzyme is approximately six times more active than bovine trypsin in its ability to release vasoactive peptides from a plasma precursor. The kininogenin is a glycoprotein containing 18 - 20 % by weight of carbohydrate. It showed a mol. wt. of 40500 on gel filtration. Gel electrophoresis of the reduced sample in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate and 2 -mercaptoethanol revealed the presence of two major components of mol. wt. 34300 and 31300. The heterogeneity, which was also observed on disc electrophoresis, was removed by incubation with neuraminidase. After incubation with neuraminidase the kininogenin retained full enzymic activity and possessed an isoelectric point of pH 7. 2. The carbohydrate content has been decreased to 10 % by weight, and the single component seen on electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate and 2 -mercaptoethanol corresponded to a mol. wt. of 29500...|$|E
40|$|Inflammatory {{response}} {{induced by}} the venom of the Arabian <b>sand</b> <b>viper</b> Cerastes gasperettii was studied by measuring rat hind-paw edema. Cerastes gasperettii venom (CgV, 3. 75 - 240 µg/paw), heated for 30 s at 97 °C, caused a marked dose and time-dependent edema in rat paw. Response was maximal 2 h after venom administration and ceased within 24 h. Heated CgV was routinely used in our experiments at the dose of 120 µg/paw. Among all the drugs and antivenoms tested, cyproheptadine and 5 -nitroindazole were the most effective in inhibiting edema formation. Aprotinin, mepyramine, dexamethasone, diclofenac, dipyridamole, Nomega-nitro-L-arginine, quinacrine, and nordihydroguaiaretic acid showed statistically (p< 0. 001) significant inhibitory effect, but with variations in their inhibition degree. Equine polyspecific and rabbit monospecific antivenoms significantly (p< 0. 001) reduced edema when locally administered (subplantar) but were ineffective when intravenously injected. We can conclude that the principal inflammatory mediators were serotonin, histamine, adenosine transport factors, phosphodiesterase (PDE), cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase and phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2), {{in addition to other}} prostaglandins and cytokines...|$|E
40|$|The venom of Echis multisquamatus (Central Asian <b>sand</b> <b>viper)</b> {{contains}} a single prothrombin activator, designated multisquamase, which is structurally and functionally different from ecarin, the prothrombin activator from the venom of Echis carinatus (saw-scaled viper). Multisquamase {{is comprised of}} a 58000 Mr and a 23000 Mr subunit that consists of two disulfide-linked chains of 12000 Mr and 10000 Mr, respectively. In contrast to ecarin, which acti-vates prothrombin and prethrombin 1 at compara-ble rates, and whose activity is hardly affected by Ca*+ or by changes in ionic strength, multisqua-mase hardly activates prethrombin 1; prothrombin activation requires Ca*+ and is strongly inhibited at high ionic strength. The most favourable kinetic parameters are observed at 1 mM Ca 2 + and at low ionic strength (Kc,= 0. 0 S 5 FM and k,,,= 0. 68 s- ’ at 1 ~ 0. 04). An increase in ionic strength consider-ably reduces the rate of prothrombin activation, due to an increase of the K, (K,= 0. 8 FM and kcat= 1. 03 s-l at 1 ~ 0. 2).

40|$|The {{effects of}} the venom of the Sahara <b>sand</b> <b>viper</b> (Cerastes vipera) were studied on {{isolated}} chick biventer cervicis, isolated rat atria and vas deferens preparations, and on the electrocardiogram of anaesthetized rats. Effects on 3 H-noradrenaline uptake were studied using rat brain synaptosomes. At 50 μg/ml and 100 μg/ml, the venom caused a transient increase in rate and force of contractions of the rat atria followed by an irreversible depression. These effects were not prevented by atenolol, atropine {{or a combination of}} the two. In the presence of 25 μM lignocaine, the effects of venom on rat atria were reversible by washing. At 100 μg/ml, the venom transiently increased responses of vas deferens preparations to indirect stimulation, but had little effect on responses to noradrenaline, KCl, and ATP. In the presence of an α 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist (prazosin) or a P 2 -purinergic receptor antagonist (suramin), the venom still significantly increased twitch height and responses to noradrenaline but not to KCl or ATP. The effect of the venom did not change after exposure to a combination of prazosin, suramin and tetrodotoxin. The venom (100 μg/ml) significantly decreased twitches to indirect and direct stimulation in chick biventer cervicis preparations. Responses to exogenously applied acetylcholine, carbachol and KCl were also decreased. Venom blocked the synaptosomal uptake of 3 H-noradrenaline (IC 50 = 5 μg/ml), and caused severe bradycardia in vivo. Some of the direct effects on muscle preparations are possibly due to the venom's phospholipase A 2 activity...|$|E
