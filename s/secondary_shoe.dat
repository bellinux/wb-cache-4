50|$|One wheel {{cylinder}} operates the brake on each wheel. Two pistons operate the shoes, one {{at each end}} of the {{wheel cylinder}}. The leading shoe (closest to the front of the vehicle) is known as the primary shoe. The trailing shoe is known as the <b>secondary</b> <b>shoe.</b> Hydraulic pressure from the master cylinder acts on the piston cup, pushing the pistons toward the shoes, forcing them against the drum. When the driver releases the brakes, the brake shoe springs restore the shoes to their original (disengaged) position. The parts of the wheel cylinder are shown to the right.|$|E
50|$|Brake {{shoes are}} {{typically}} made of {{two pieces of}} steel welded together. The friction material is either riveted to the lining table or attached with adhesive. The crescent-shaped piece is called the Web and contains holes and slots in different shapes for return springs, hold-down hardware, parking brake linkage and self-adjusting components. All the application force of the wheel cylinder is applied through the web to the lining table and brake lining. The edge of the lining table generally has three â€œV"-shaped notches or tabs on each side called nibs. The nibs rest against the support pads of the backing plate to which the shoes are installed.Each brake assembly has two shoes, a primary and secondary. The primary shoe is located {{toward the front of}} the vehicle and has the lining positioned differently from the <b>secondary</b> <b>shoe.</b> Quite often, the two shoes are interchangeable, so close inspection for any variation is important. Linings must be resistant to heat and wear and have a high friction coefficient unaffected by fluctuations in temperature and humidity.Materials that make up the brake shoe include, friction modifiers (which can include graphite and cashew nut shells), powdered metal such as lead, zinc, brass, aluminium and other metals that resist heat fade, binders, curing agents and fillers such as rubber chips to reduce brake noise.|$|E
40|$|Aim of the study: The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the role of the DWI in {{assessment}} of peri-anal fistula and whether it can replace post contrast study. Patients and methods: MRI examinations was done for 35 patients. Images were reviewed for the presence and number of visible fistulas, internal openings, <b>secondary</b> extension, horse <b>shoe</b> and abscess. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurement of suspected fistula tracks and abscess cavities was done to assess activity. Comparison between TIRM, DWI and post-contrast T 1 -weighted fat saturated sequences was done. Surgical findings were the reference standard. Results: Contrast enhanced images were superior to DWI in detection of primary fistula and internal opening while they were equivalent in detection of secondary extensions and abscess. There was no significant difference in overall accuracy of detection of perianal fistula and its complications between combined (DWI and TIRM images) and post contrast images. There was significant difference between ADC values of active and inactive fistulae and between abscess and inflammatory reaction. Conclusion: Combined DWI and TIRM is equivalent to post contrast images in detection of primary and complicated fistula. DWI is useful in differentiation between abscess and inflammatory reaction, and assessment of disease activity.
