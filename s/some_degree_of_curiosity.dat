He sought no society, but rather avoided that which the apparent gentleness of his manners, and <b>some</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>curiosity,</b> induced many to offer him. Nothing could be more regular, or less resembling an adventurer, than his mode of living, which was simple, but so completely well arranged, that all who had any transactions with him were loud in their approbation.|$|E
5000|$|In around 1676 Williamson {{was said}} to have been staying at the house of a {{sympathetic}} family of landowners, the Kerrs (or in some accounts, the Murrays) of the estate of Cherrytrees near Yetholm in the Scottish Borders, when a party of dragoons led by Lieutenant Creighton (the Captain John Creighton or Creichton whose memoirs were written up by Jonathan Swift in 1731) arrived late at night. Mrs Kerr hurriedly concealed Williamson in bed alongside her eighteen-year-old daughter, disguising him with her own nightcap, and went downstairs to [...] "soften the hearts of the soldiery with liquor". While Creighton's men were searching the house, the story ran, Williamson and Miss Kerr became more intimately acquainted, with the result that he was later compelled to marry her. She was in fact his third wife to that point, and he went on to be married three more times, making him the object of <b>some</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>curiosity</b> and ridicule. Creighton, in his ghost-written memoir, added: ...|$|E
40|$|Tony Blair’s {{political}} instinct typically is {{to associate}} himself {{only with the}} future. As such, his explicit appeal to ‘the past’ in his references to New Labour’s desire to establish a “new Bretton Woods” is sufficient in itself to arouse <b>some</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> analytical <b>curiosity</b> (see Blair 1998 a). The fact that this appeal was made specifically in relation to Bretton Woods is even more interesting. The resonant image of the international economic context established by the original Bretton Woods agreements invokes a style and content of policy-making which Tony Blair typically dismisses as neither economically nor politically consistent with his preferred {{vision of the future}} (see Blair 2000 c, 2001 b) ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether in a modular technology education (MTE) classroom, gender groupings and learning styles predicted <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>curiosity.</b> Based {{on the assumption}} that gender grouping and learning style are factors that influence the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>curiosity</b> <b>of</b> both individuals and teams, it was hypothesized that a student’s learning style (i. e., Accommodating, Converging, Diverging, and Assimilating) and gender grouping (girl/girl, boy/boy, and girl/boy) at the module would be essential elements to consider when measuring the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>curiosity</b> <b>of</b> learners in MTE classrooms. During a meeting with the deputy superintendent and the technology education supervisor in a mid-sized, suburban public school district in Virginia, three MTE teachers from different schools were identified to participate in this study in the spring of 2004. The sample for this study consisted of middle school students (n = 116; 22 girls and 94 boys, grades 6 – 8) enrolled in technology education classes using Synergistic SystemsTM modules. Students completed thre...|$|R
