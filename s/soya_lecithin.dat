However, due to its low absorption, the poor bioavailability of curcumin limits its clinical use. In this study, we reported an approach of encapsulation a curcumin by nanoliposome to achieve an improved bioavailability of a poorly absorbed hydrophobic compound.

However, they are not available in sufficient amounts in live preys as Artemia, making necessary a supplementation of these nutrients previous use. A commercial emulsion, soya liposomes, and marine and <b>soya</b> <b>lecithins</b> were used to supply HUFA and PL to Artemia metanauplii, those being regarded as suitable size preys for octopus paralarvae. Our results prove that a simultaneous enrichment in HUFA and PL is possible using enrichment diets combining HUFA- and PL-rich products in short-term (4 h) incubations. Particularly interesting was the enrichment efficiency shown by the marine lecithin, which enabled the enhancement of the PL fraction of Artemia metanauplii and, importantly, also their HUFA with a remarkable 13 % DHA of total fatty acids. Marine lecithin arises as a novel enrichment diet for Artemia and more effective than some commercial products currently used in hatcheries worldwide. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research work was to design and characterize Nanostructured Lipid Carriers (NLC) incorporated with anticancer agent docetaxel. NLC were prepared by hot homogenization followed by ultrasonication method using stearic acid as the solid lipid and oleic acid as the liquid lipid. <b>Soya</b> bean <b>lecithin</b> was used as surfactant and poloxamer 188 as the cosurfactant. Optimization of the formulations was done based on sedimentation volume, particle size, polydispersity, % entrapment efficiency and zeta potential. The optimized batch of NG 9 exhibited a particle size of 180 µm, polydispersity of 0. 25, %EE of 78 % and zeta potential of 41 mV. Based on this {{it was decided that}} concentration of lipid at 20 %, solid lipid: liquid lipid ratio of 80 : 20, surfactant and cosurfactant at 4 %, mannitol at 3 % was the optimal proportion. The process parameters was further optimized and the results revealed that at homogenization RPM of 6000, homogenization time of 20 min and sonication time of 10 min resulted in NLC with ideal characteristics. The in vitro release of Docetaxel from the optimized batch, NG 9 was found to be almost complete with a release of 98. 80 ± 0. 08 at 4 hours. The drug release of this batch when subjected to pharmacokinetics studies using various models showed that the data best into zero order and Higuchi release kinetic model with a coefficient of determination (R 2) value of 0. 9972 and 0. 9347. Linearity to Higuchi kinetic model indicated a diffusion controlled drug release.

40|$|Background: Egg yolk is {{the main}} {{cryoprotectant}} agent in semen freezing extenders which is used {{in order to protect}} spermatozoa against cold shock. However, elimination of animal bioproducts from the cryopreservation protocol is becoming mandatory. Therefore, the aim {{of this study is to}} compare a previously studied, homemade <b>soya</b> bean <b>lecithin</b> based extender with a commercially available extender for ram sperm cryopreservation. Materials and Methods: Samples from three rams were pooled and split into two equal aliquots and diluted (1 : 20) with i%lecithin- 7 %glycerol (L 1 G 7) and Bioxcell®. The effects of L 1 G 7 and Bioxcell ® on sperm parameters and the in vitro fertilization ability of frozen-thawed ram spermatozoa were assessed. Results: The results of this study revealed no difference between the two extenders in terms of motility, viability, and capacitation status. The results of in vitro fertilization in terms of rate of blastocyst formation were similar for both extenders, but significantly lower than that of freshly processed ram sperm. Conclusion: We conclude that both extenders are suitable for ram sperm cryopreservation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRilpivirine (RPV) is a {{pharmaceutical}} drug {{used for the}} treatment of HIV infection. The drug is characterized with poor aqueous solubility and dissolution rate leading to low bioavailability of the drug. Hence, {{there is a need for}} the improvement of the solubility and dissolution of such drugs. In this exertion, enhancement of the solubility and dissolution of the practically water insoluble drug rilpivirine was achieved by solid dispersion (SD) preparation using solvent evaporation method which eventually leads to bioavailability enhancement. SD's were formed using Kollidon VA 64 which is a water-soluble copolymer and varying copolymer ratio to Avicel PH- 101, Gelucire 50 / 13 and <b>lecithin</b> <b>soya.</b> Solubility studies were carried out to establish the solubility-enhancing property of the SD's. To support solubility analysis results, powder dissolution studies were carried out. The SD's were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray powder diffraction studies, scanning electron microscopy. It was found that the SD's formed showed the absence of crystalline nature of the drug and its conversion to amorphous state. The solubility and dissolution of the rilpivirine SD's were enhanced. There is a 14. 9 fold increase in solubility for Drug: Kollidan VA 64 : Gelucire 50 / 13 (1 : 4 : 1).

50|$|The {{phosphatidylserine}} decarboxylation pathway and the cytidine diphosphate-ethanolamine pathways {{are used}} to synthesize phosphatidylethanolamine. Phosphatidylserine decarboxylase is the enzyme {{that is used to}} decarboxylate phosphatidylserine in the first pathway. The phosphatidylserine decarboxylation pathway is the main source of synthesis for phosphatidylethanolamine in the membranes of the mitochondria. Phosphatidylethanolamine produced in the mitochondrial membrane is also transported throughout the cell to other membranes for use. In a process that mirrors phosphatidylcholine synthesis, phosphatidylethanolamine is also made via the cytidine diphosphate-ethanolamine pathway, using ethanolamine as the substrate. Through several steps taking place is both the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum, the synthesis pathway yields the end product of phosphatidylethanolamine.

We finally demonstrated that the best protocol to store LNCs dispersion for a 6 -month period is by freezing in liquid nitrogen. This protocol minimized the characteristics modifications and interrupted the drug-release phenomenon.

40|$|Carob flour enriched {{functional}} spread {{was developed}} and textural, sensory, colour, and some nutritional properties of the product were investigated. Spread samples were prepared with major ingredients for optimisation and minor ingredients for improving texture and aroma. Major ingredients were carob flour and hydrogenated palm oil (HPO) and minor ingredients were commercial skim milk powder, <b>soya</b> flour, <b>lecithin,</b> and hazelnut puree. The ratio of major ingredients was optimised using sensory scores and instrumental texture values to produce a carob spread that most closely resembles commercial chocolate spread (control), in both spreadability and overall acceptability. The amounts of minor ingredients (milk powder, 10 %; soybean flour, 5 %; lecithin, 1 %; hazelnut puree, 4 %) were kept in constant ratio (20 %). Addition of hydrogenated palm oil (HPO) decreased the hardness and hardness work done (HWD) values in contrast to carob flour. Higher rates of carob flour were linked to lower lightness, greenness, and yellowness values. Spread was optimised at 38 [*]g carob flour/ 100 [*]g spread and 42 [*]g hydrogenated palm oil/ 100 [*]g spread level and the formulation tended to receive the highest sensory scores compared to other spreads and presented closer instrumental spreadability values to control samples.

40|$|The current {{investigation}} evaluated {{the potential of}} proniosome as a carrier to enhance skin permeation and skin retention of a highly lipophilic compound, α-mangostin. α-Mangostin proniosomes were prepared using the coacervation phase seperation method. Upon hydration, α-mangostin loaded niosomes were characterized for size, polydispersity index (PDI), entrapment efficiency (EE) and ζ-potential. The in vitro permeation experiments with dermis-split Yucatan Micropig (YMP) skin revealed that proniosomes composed of Spans, <b>soya</b> <b>lecithin</b> and cholesterol were able to enhance the skin permeation of α-mangostin with a factor range from 1. 8 - to 8. 0 -fold {{as compared to the}} control suspension. Furthermore, incorporation of <b>soya</b> <b>lecithin</b> in the proniosomal formulation significantly enhanced the viable epidermis/dermis (VED) concentration of α-mangostin. All the proniosomal formulations (except for S 20 L) had significantly (p< 0. 05) enhanced deposition of α-mangostin in the VED layer with a factor range from 2. 5 - to 2. 9 -fold as compared to the control suspension. Since addition of Spans and <b>soya</b> <b>lecithin</b> in water improved the solubility of α-mangostin, this would be related to the enhancement of skin permeation and skin concentration of α-mangostin. The choice of non-ionic surfactant in proniosomes is an important factor governing the skin permeation and skin retention of α-mangostin. These results suggested that proniosomes can be utilized as a carrier for highly lipophilic compound like α-mangostin for topical application. Regular Articl...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to develop {{nonionic}} surfactant based vesicles (niosomes) to improve poor and variable oral bioavailability of cefdinir. Materials and Methods: Cefdinir niosomes were formulated by sonication method using varying concentration of surfactant (span 60), with and without <b>soya</b> <b>lecithin,</b> but the cholesterol ratio was kept constant in all the formulations. The influence of formulation variables such as surfactant concentration, <b>soya</b> <b>lecithin</b> presence or absence were optimized for size and entrapment efficiency.

Results: The highest entrapment efficiency (74. 56 %) was observed when span 60, cefdinir, cholesterol and <b>soya</b> <b>lecithin</b> were used in the ratio of 5 : 1 : 1 : 1. The zeta sizer of the niosomal formulations showed the size range between 190 nm- 1140 nm. The photomicrography showed round shape of vesicles and further nano size of niosomes was confirmed by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The optimized niosomal formulations (F 11 and F 6) exhibited sustained in-vitro release of 94. 91 % and 94. 07 % respectively upto 12 h. The ex-vivo permeation studies of optimized formulation revealed that the niosomal dispersion improved cefdinir permeability across goat intestinal membrane as compared to plain drug solution and marketed suspension (Adcef®). Antimicrobial activity studies revealed that the niosomes potentiated bacteriostatic activity of cefdinir as compared to Adcef®.
