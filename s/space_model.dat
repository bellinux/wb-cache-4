40|$|Abstract. Word <b>space</b> <b>models,</b> in {{the sense}} of vector <b>space</b> <b>models</b> built on {{distributional}} data taken from texts, are used to model semantic relations between words. We argue that the high dimensionality of typical vector <b>space</b> <b>models</b> lead to unintuitive effects on modeling likeness of meaning and that the local structure of word spaces is where interesting semantic relations reside. We show that the local structure of word spaces has substantially different dimensionality and character than the global space and that this structure shows potential to be exploited for further semantic analysis using methods for local analysis of vector space structure rather than globally scoped methods typically in use today such as singular value decomposition or principal component analysis. Vector <b>space</b> <b>models</b> Vector <b>space</b> <b>models</b> are frequently used in information access, both for research experiments and as a building block for systems in practical use.

In addition to providing a theoretical framework for current models, we consider the implications of statistical aspects of language data that have not been addressed in the psychological modeling literature. Statistical approaches to language must deal principally with count data, and this data will typically have a highly skewed frequency distribution due to Zipf’s law.

40|$|Clustering is {{the process}} of {{grouping}} a set of objects into clusters so that objects within a cluster have high similarity with each other, but are as dissimilar as possible to objects in other clusters. Dissimilarities are measured based on the attribute values describing the objects (Han & Kamber, 2001). Clustering, as a data mining technique (Cios, Pedrycz, & Swiniarski, 1998; Groth, 2000), has been widely used to find groups of customers with similar behavior or groups of items that are bought together, allowing the identification of the clients’ profile (Berry & Linoff, 2000). This chapter presents another use of clustering, namely in the creation of <b>Space</b> <b>Models.</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Models</b> represent divisions of the geographic space in which the several geographic regions are grouped accordingly to their similarities with respect to a specific indicator (values of an attribute). <b>Space</b> <b>Models</b> represent natural divisions of the geographic space based on some geo-referenced data.
