40|$|This {{repository}} item {{contains a}} single issue of Sustainable Development Insights, {{a series of}} short policy essays that began publishing in 2008 by the Boston University Frederick S. Pardee Center for the Study of the Longer-Range Future. The series seeks to promote a broad interdisciplinary dialogue on how to accelerate sustainable development at all levels. The Green Revolution in agriculture greatly increased crop yields and averted mass starvation, but it also turned small farms into factory farms that concentrated production in a few locations and reduced the diversity of crops. In this paper, Professor Nalin Kulatilaka, Co-Director of BU’s Clean Energy & Environmental Sustainability Initiative, calls for a Green Energy Revolution that decentralizes energy supplies through a <b>smart</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>network.</b> He argues that such a revolution could provide for a diversity of energy sources located closer to users, which in turn could shift consumption patterns, reduce losses and decrease overall energy demand. He concludes that shifting to such a system “will adopt clean energy technologies while fostering new businesses, creating new jobs and ultimately empowering society to reach new heights in energy conservation and sustainability“...|$|E
40|$|The {{integration}} {{of renewable energy}} sources {{and the development of}} a <b>smart</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>network</b> can be considered as the key elements in the transition that the electric power sector currently faces. This thesis contributes to modeling electricity generation, by simultaneously considering both developments in long-term investment planning and short-term generation scheduling. Different methodologies are suggested, allowing the {{integration of}} short-term demand response programs in existing electricity generation models, as well as dynamic pricing incentivizing consumers to adjust their electricity consumption levels in response to electricity prices. Model results suggest that in long-term generation planning as well as in short-term scheduling, demand-side participation can increase net market surplus by reducing load when marginal benefits of consumption are less than marginal costs, and by increasing consumption when the reverse is the case. The integration of short-term demand response decreases peaks in electricity demand. Demand response also creates valley filling effects, lessening over-generation problems during night or high wind generation periods. Consequently, demand response facilitates the integration of variable wind power generation. Long-term investment planning model results suggest that an efficient generation technology mix can be composed of a larger share of base load generation and lower investments are required in peaking generation capacity. Peak reduction and valley filling effects also impact short-term generation scheduling. More expensive peak power generation output is reduced in favor of power generation using less expensive coal-fired or nuclear power plants. Increasing flexibility at the demand-side reduces not only variable generation costs, but also start-up costs. Additionally price variation is reduced and the integration of wind power generation can be improved resulting in reduced levels of wind power curtailment. Price-responsive consumers result in a more efficient use of available transmission capacity. As long as the interconnection capacity between different regions is not fully used, consumers have the incentive to adjust consumption levels and import electricity from a low price region. Consequently, real-time price signals in a system with limited interconnection capacity increase welfare by a higher use of the available capacity. Finally, a responsive demand-side proves to be efficient in dealing with the uncertainty of real-time wind power injections. Even large wind power forecast errors can be dealt with by using demand-side flexibility. Consequently, the operational cost increase caused by wind power uncertainty can be lowered through price-responsive consumers adjusting their electricity demand levels. status: publishe...|$|E

The main goal is to analyze the routing requirements that will facilitate the future formal specification of a QoS-aware multipath routing algorithm for the coming SEN’s data networks in the high voltage segment where long-distance mesh data networks will be a future challenge for engineering and research. In this paper, the study is focused on requirement specification regarding distance-vector routing algorithms that reduce the overall overhead of routing information needed in the network, thus preserving the scalability feature.

The overall systemʼs efficiency can be optimized by taking advantage of available sources of energy such as regenerative braking of trains or local renewable energy resources. This can be achieved by handling the intermittent nature of the various sources and consumption points and by redesigning the station energy grid in a global approach. Microgrids have been an actively researched subject since a few years with the growing interests in <b>smart</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>networks</b> as a mean to decentralize the global power supply facilities. We present hereby a methodology for the optimal management of a microgrid connecting regenerative braking energy sources, eventual distributed energy resources, heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC) systems, specific electricity consumptions and electricity storage systems (ESS) for energy management in subway stations.

40|$|<b>Smart</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>networks</b> {{that address}} energy demand, {{efficiency}} and sustainability concerns are {{predicated on the}} ability to capture renewable energy in a controllable manner. Such networks will have a particular role in cities, where increasing demand is inevitable but this requires that primary (renewable) energy resources, including that of wind, is better understood. In this paper, the role of wind energy systems, as integral components of a <b>smarter</b> urban <b>electricity</b> <b>network,</b> is considered using a model of the urban wind resourcein Dublin, Ireland that is based on boundary layer theory and meteorological observations. This model is used in conjunction with an <b>electricity</b> <b>network</b> model to investigate the implications of wind energy contributions for the delivery of electricity. The available wind resource in a city is estimated from wind observations at a conventional meteorological station located at Dublin Airport, outside the city. These observations are used to estimate the parameters of the logarithmic wind profile and establish a wind value at a height well above the roughness effects of the urban surface. This value is then employed to estimate wind speed within the inertial sub-layer of the urban boundary layer (UBL). The model is tested at two sites in Dublin: a suburban site with relatively low buildings and mature vegetation and a city centre site with taller buildings and little vegetation. At each site wind-speed and direction is recorded at a level that is approximately 1. 5 times the average height of surrounding buildings using a three-dimensional sonic anemometer. The results indicate that in urban environments, there is a viable wind resource at heights 1. 5 - 2 times the average building height and that estimates based on an understanding of the urban surface roughness can produce good estimates. This suggests that mapping the aerodynamic roughness of the city can provide insight into the potential wind resource across the urban area and the positioning of wind turbines to create a distributed generation (DG) system. Integrating a DG system into an <b>electricity</b> distribution <b>network</b> is not straightforward as it must account for bidirection power flow and variability in voltage. Bidirectional power flow and in particular reverse power flow from the DG has the effect of causing the network voltage to rise. To investigate the implications of such a system for consumers connected to a DG system, a typical mean year of the urban wind resource is used to model power flow for a section Dublin suburban <b>electricity</b> <b>network.</b> The results suggest significant amounts of electricity derived from wind energy can be accommodated. From a smart network perspective, this type of holistic analysis is required if wind energy is to contribute significantly to meeting energy demand...|$|R

New services, such as consumption feedback and the possibility to choose dynamic electricity pricing contracts, have been available from the adoption of this infrastructure. A web-based survey evaluating customers’ perception of these new services was carried out. The survey included consumers’ personal information, preferences about the type of information and the frequency of delivery and the preference for electricity pricing contracts. The results showed that the electricity consumption information offered by distribution system operators (DSOs) today is not detailed enough for customers to react accordingly. Additionally, while variable pricing contracts are becoming more popular, the available pricing schemes do not encourage customers to increase their consumption flexibility. Therefore, more detailed information from the smart meters should be made available, including disaggregated electricity consumption per appliance that would allow consumers to have more control over their energy consumption activities...|$|R

In the United States, development of 2 ̆ 2 smart grids 2 ̆ 2 is being pursued as a national policy mandate and goal, promising that the deployment of smart grid technologies [...] referring in general to digital {{information and communication technologies}} that sense, monitor, control and manage the electric grid [...] will make electricity systems more environmentally sustainable and reliable, and at the same time, provide opportunities for growth and innovation. This dissertation examines and analyzes three interconnected issues relating to these sociotechnical changes in electricity infrastructure: the material and discursive construction of the smart grid, urban smart grid experimentation, and the mobility of smart grid models and knowledge. A conceptual framework is proposed for investigating sociotechnical transitions that accounts for dimensions of power and politics that are commonly overlooked in conventional analysis, and highlights how governance regimes shape and are shaped by sociotechnical change. Utilizing Foucauldian discourse analysis and relational comparative case study methodology, this dissertation analyzes the development of the smart grid as a governmental program highlighting its rationalities, techniques, and imagined subjects. The findings of these analyses suggest that the transition to a smarter grid involves much more than top-down policy mandates; significant urban experimentation is involved, as well as inter-city learning that is shaped by local political economy and broader political rationalities. This dissertation also argues for a synthesis between policy mobilities and sociotechnical transitions theory, highlighting through case studies how urban smart grid experiments are influenced by experiences and knowledge generated from 2 ̆ 2 vanguard 2 ̆ 2 cities. The conclusion of this dissertation is that the creation of the smart grid is far from a purely technical infrastructural intervention, and instead, requires significant changes in the everyday social practices and conduct of energy consumers, while also reconfiguring the city, engaging in a material politics in order to govern energy transitions...|$|R
