This device {{was much more}} sensitive than both the capillary electrometer Waller used and the <b>string</b> <b>galvanometer</b> that had been invented separately in 1897 by the French engineer Clément Ader. Einthoven had previously, in 1895, assigned the letters P, Q, R, S, and T to the deflections in the theoretical waveform he created using equations which corrected the actual waveform obtained by the capillary electrometer {{to compensate for the}} imprecision of that instrument. Using letters different from A, B, C, and D (the letters used for the capillary electrometer's waveform) facilitated comparison when the uncorrected and corrected lines were drawn on the same graph. Einthoven probably chose the initial letter P to follow the example set by Descartes in geometry. When a more [...] precise waveform was obtained using the <b>string</b> <b>galvanometer,</b> which matched the corrected capillary electrometer waveform, he continued to use the letters P, Q, R, S, and T, and these letters are still in use today. Einthoven also described the electrocardiographic features of a number of cardiovascular disorders. In 1924, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for his discovery.|$|E
50|$|Previous to the <b>string</b> <b>galvanometer,</b> {{scientists}} were using a machine called the capillary electrometer {{to measure the}} heart’s electrical activity, but this device was unable to produce results of a diagnostic level. Willem Einthoven invented the <b>string</b> <b>galvanometer</b> at Leiden University in the early 20th century, publishing the first registration of its use to record an electrocardiogram in a Festschrift book in 1902. The first human electrocardiogram was recorded in 1887, however {{it was not until}} 1901 that a quantifiable result was obtained from the <b>string</b> <b>galvanometer.</b> In 1908, the physicians Arthur MacNalty, M.D. Oxon, and Thomas Lewis teamed to become the first of their profession to apply electrocardiography in medical diagnosis. Einthoven was awarded the Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1924 for his work.|$|E
40|$|The year 1902 saw {{the birth}} of {{clinical}} electrocardiography when Willem Einthoven published the first electrocardiogram (ECG) of unprecedented quality recorded with his newly invented string- galvanometer [1]. The foundations of electrocardiographic diagnosis were laid in the half century that followed. After {{the second world war}} electronic pen-writing recorders made their appearance and quickly pushed the bulky <b>string</b> <b>galvanometers</b> from the scene, notwithstanding a far inferior frequency response. Standards for performancewere then issued thatwere unfortunately based on the frequency characteristics of this type of equipment.

50|$|NRL {{developed}} a telemetry system using a 23-channel pulse-time modulation. Voltage {{presented to the}} input terminals of a given channel determined spacing between two adjacent pulses, not entirely unlike the technique of pulse-position modulation. Space between first and second pulses was determined by channel 1, between second and third pulses by channel 2, and so forth. The system made 200 samplings per second of 24 pulses. Information was transmitted via high-power frequency modulation. Ground receiving stations translated pulse spacings back into voltages which were applied to a bank of <b>string</b> <b>galvanometers</b> to make an approximately continuous record of each channel on a moving roll of film. Accuracy was within approximately 5 percent.|$|R
40|$|Electrical {{records were}} made from the {{interior}} of the right heart and attached vessels in 14 normal subjects. Technics differed somewhat from those previously reported in that simultaneously record-ing <b>string</b> <b>galvanometers</b> were used exclusively, and tracings were made whenever the catheter-electrode was moved within the heart. Previously unreported large positive QRS deflections were found in records from {{the lower part of the}} right atrium, from the pulmonary artery, and in two instances from within the right ventricle itself close to the base. The possible anatomical origin of these is discussed. SEVERAL papers 1 - 10 are available on the nature of the electrical records obtained from {{the interior of the}} human heart. The additional verbal reports being made with increasing frequency attest to the interest in the possible answers these records may supply to many questions in fundamental electro-cardiographic theory. Intracardiac leads in man were begun in this laboratory in 1946. This report is con-cerned with the findings in 14 subjects with normal hearts as determined clinically. Em-phasis will be placed on those aspects of our studies which differ from or supplement those previously reported. METHODS The catheters * used were 100 em. long and ranged in caliber from 6 F to 9 F. They consisted of a core of fine copper wire connected at the distal end to a silver electrode and at the proximal end to an ordinary electrical plug.

This current could be stopped at any moment, by removing the discharging rod, and either stopping the machine or connecting the prime conductor by another rod with the discharging train; and could be as instantly renewed. The needle was so adjusted, that whilst vibrating in moderate and small arcs, it required time equal to twenty-five beats of a watch to pass in one direction through the arc, and of course an equal time to pass in the other direction.|$|R

50|$|The {{attempts}} to amplify biosignal {{started with the}} development of electrocardiography. In 1887, Augustus Waller, a British physiologist, successfully measured the electrocardigraphy of his dog using two buckets of saline, in which each of the front paws and the hind paws was submerged. After a few months, Waller successfully recorded the first human electrocardiography using the capillary electrometer. Although, Waller did not envision that the electrocardiography would be used in healthcare extensibly, {{at the time of his}} invention. The electrocardiography did not have a practical usability until Willem Einthoven, a Dutch physiologist, coined the way to use the <b>string</b> <b>galvanometer</b> in cardiac signal amplification. Significant improvements in amplifier led to the usage of smaller electrodes that would be more easily attached to body parts. In the 1920s, the way to electrically amplify the cardiac signals was introduced, using vacuum tubes, which quickly replaced the <b>string</b> <b>galvanometer</b> that amplified the signal mechanically. The Vacuum tubes had larger impedance, so the amplification was more robust. Also, its relatively small size compared to the <b>string</b> <b>galvanometer</b> also contributed the widespread of the vacuum tube. Also, the large metal buckets were no longer needed, as much smaller metal-plate electrodes were introduced. By the 1930s, the electrocardiogram devices could be carried to the patient's home for the purpose of bedside monitoring. With the emergence of electronic amplification, it was quickly discovered that many features of the electrocardiography were revealed with various electrode placement.|$|E
50|$|Bremer {{started his}} brain transection {{experiments}} at an opportune time. Neurophysiological techniques had greatly improved {{during the early}} 1930s {{with the introduction of}} Alex Forbes' electronic amplification. Electromagnetic oscillographs hadreplaced the Lippman electrometer and the <b>string</b> <b>galvanometer</b> in electrophysiological experiments. These newly introduced techniques allowed Lord Adrian and Matthews to confirm Hans Bergers revolutionary discovery of alpha electroencephalographicactivity in humans.|$|E
50|$|In Wedensky’s laboratory, and at {{the same}} time as Charles S. Sherrington (1857-1952), Beritashvili used the <b>string</b> <b>galvanometer</b> to study the central {{coordination}} of spinal reflexes in the registration of action currents of antagonist muscles. In 1913-1914 he discovered the rhythmic nature of reciprocal inhibition. Ten years later, in 1924, E. D. Adrian, J. F. Fulton, and E. T. Liddell (1924) confirmed these findings.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>string</b> <b>galvanometer,</b> {{also known}} as the Einthoven galvanometer, invented around 1901 by Dutch {{physician}} Willem Einthoven was the first practical electrocardiograph (ECG); {{it was one of the}} earliest instruments capable of detecting and recording the very small electric currents produced by the human heart and produced the first reliable electrocardiograms. The original machines achieved [...] "such amazing technical perfection that many modern day electrocardiographs do not attain equally reliable and undistorted recordings". [...] Einthoven was awarded the 1924 Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work.|$|E
50|$|His method {{involved}} inserting silver wires {{under the}} patients scalp, {{one at the}} front of the head and one at the back. Later he used silver foil electrodes attached to the head by a rubber bandage. As a recording device he first used the Lippmann's capillary electrometer, but results were disappointing. He then switched to the <b>string</b> <b>galvanometer</b> and later to a double-coil Siemens recording galvanometer, which allowed him to record electrical voltages as small as one ten thousandth of a volt. The resulting output, up to three seconds in duration, was then photographed by an assistant.|$|E
50|$|At the {{recommendation}} of Wedensky, Beritashvili left for Kazan in autumn 1911 to work with Prof. A. P. Samoilov (1867-1930) to master the method of registering electric currents in nerves and muscles by the <b>string</b> <b>galvanometer</b> that, in turn, Samoilov had learned from Willem Einthoven (1860-1927) in Leiden in 1904. Later, {{in the spring of}} 1914, again with Wedensky’s support, Beritashvili joined Rudolf Magnus (1873-1927) in Utrecht to study the techniques of mammalian neurosurgery (decebreration, sectioning the dorsal roots, etc.), the principles of body posture and tonic neck and labyrinthine reflexes in mammals (later the Magnus-de Kleijn reflexes). At the start of the World War I Beritashvili had to cease his research and return to St. Petersburg.|$|E
50|$|Before Einthoven's time, it {{was known}} that the beating of the heart {{produced}} electrical currents, but the instruments of the time could not accurately measure this phenomenon without placing electrodes directly on the heart. Beginning in 1901, Einthoven completed a series of prototypes of a <b>string</b> <b>galvanometer.</b> This device used a very thin filament of conductive wire passing between very strong magnets. When a current passed through the filament, the magnetic field created by the current would cause the string to move. A light shining on the string would cast a shadow on a moving roll of photographic paper, thus forming a continuous curve showing {{the movement of the}} string. The original machine required water cooling for the powerful electromagnets, required 5 people to operate it and weighed some 270 kilograms. This device increased the sensitivity of the standard galvanometer so that the electrical activity of the heart could be measured despite the insulation of flesh and bones.|$|E
50|$|The French {{had made}} an {{important}} development. They had taken the <b>string</b> <b>galvanometer</b> and adapted it to record signals from microphones onto photographic film. This work had been done by Lucien Bull and Charles Nordmann (an astronomer at the Paris observatory). Processing the film took some minutes {{but this was not}} a significant drawback because artillery batteries did not move very frequently. However, the apparatus could not run continuously because of the expenditure of film. This meant {{that it had to be}} switched on when enemy guns fired, which necessitated the deployment of Advanced Posts (AP) in front of the microphones which could switch on the recording apparatus remotely via field cable. These Advanced Posts were connected back to a centrally located Flash Board, and this device enabled the observers to sure they were all observing the same muzzle flash. When this had been established they could switch on the recording apparatus.|$|E
50|$|To achieve higher {{sensitivity}} to detect extremely small currents, the mirror galvanometer substituted a lightweight mirror for the pointer. It consisted of horizontal magnets suspended from a fine fiber, inside a vertical coil of wire, with a mirror {{attached to the}} magnets. A beam of light reflected from the mirror fell on a graduated scale across the room, acting as a long mass-less pointer. The mirror galvanometer {{was used as the}} receiver in the first trans-Atlantic submarine telegraph cables in the 1850s, to detect the extremely faint pulses of current after their thousand mile journey under the Atlantic. In a device called an oscillograph, the moving beam of light was used, to produce graphs of current versus time, by recording measurements on photographic film. The <b>string</b> <b>galvanometer</b> was a type of mirror galvanometer so sensitive that it was used to make the first electrocardiogram of the electrical activity of the human heart.|$|E
5000|$|While still a house physician, Lewis began {{physiological}} research, {{carrying out}} fundamental {{research on the}} heart, the pulse and blood pressure. From 1906, he corresponded with the Dutch physiologist Willem Einthoven concerning the latter's invention of the <b>string</b> <b>galvanometer</b> and electrocardiography, and Lewis pioneered its use in clinical settings. Accordingly, Lewis is considered the [...] "father of clinical cardiac electrophysiology". The first use of electrocardiography in clinical medicine was in 1908. In that year, Thomas Lewis and Arthur MacNalty (later the Chief Medical Officer of the United Kingdom) employed electrocardiography to diagnose heart block. In 1909, with James MacKenzie, Lewis founded the journal Heart: A Journal for the Study of the Circulation, which he renamed Clinical Science in 1933. In 1913, he published the book Clinical Electrocardiography, the first treaty on electrocardiography. Lewis was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1918. He was promoted to full physician at UCH in 1919.|$|E
50|$|Berger took a {{cue from}} Ukrainian {{physiologist}} Pravdich-Neminski, who used a <b>string</b> <b>galvanometer</b> to create {{a photograph of the}} electrical activity of a dog's brain. Using similar techniques, Berger confirmed the existence of electrical activity in the human brain. He first did this by presenting a stimulus to hospital patients with skull damage and measuring the electrical activity in their brains. Later he ceased the stimulus method and began measuring the natural rhythmic electrical cycles in the brain. The first natural rhythm he documented was what would become known as the alpha wave. Berger was very thorough and meticulous in his data-gathering, but despite his brilliance, he did not feel confident enough to publish his discoveries until at least five years after he had made them. In 1929, he published his first findings on alpha waves in the journal Archiv für Psychiatrie. He was originally met with derision for his EEG technique and his subsequent alpha and brain wave discoveries. His technique and findings did not gain widespread acceptance in the psychological community until 1937, when he gained the approval of the famous physiologist Lord Adrian, who took a particular interest in alpha waves.|$|E

40|$|The {{string of}} Einthoven's <b>string</b> <b>galvanometer</b> The Dutch {{physiologist}} Willem Einthoven (1860 - 1927) published in 1901 his {{construction of a}} <b>string</b> <b>galvanometer.</b> With this apparatus he opened the era for electrocardiography. As {{the quality of his}} instrument largely depended on the string of the <b>string</b> <b>galvanometer</b> it is surprising to note that in his publications Einthoven never mentioned the exact way of producing the string. However, Einthoven's hand written laboratory notes are preserved at the Museum Boerhaave in Leiden. From these notes it comes clear what problems Einthoven had with the string. To get a very thin thread of quarts he first used the method of shooting the thread as was described by Boys (1887), later the blowing method of Nichols (1894). The silvering of the thread was done first chemically, later by cathode spray. In all cases premature breaking of the thread was a nuisance. Because of these failures Einthoven might have decided not to publish any details...|$|E

40|$|THOMAS Lewis in the {{introduction}} to his "Mechanism and Graphic Registration of the Heart Beat " emphasized that scientific advancement depends upon the development of suitable instrumentation. 1 In the pioneer days of Einthoven and Lewis the problem was to design and construct an instrument which would permit a study of what has become electrocardio-graphy. Einthoven's contribution was to adapt the tight string instrument originated by Ader for submarine telegraphic purposes to the requirements of cardiac electrophysiology. 2 Einthoven pointed out the marked superior-ity of the new <b>string</b> <b>galvanometer</b> to the older capillary electrometer—the time saved in making records and the avoidance of the complicated cor-rections necessary because of the poor frequency response of the electro-meter. 3 ' 4 ' 5 Following Einthoven many modifications of the string gal-vanometer have been made.

40|$|AbstractThis {{article is}} {{a review of the}} history of the <b>string</b> <b>galvanometer</b> and of the {{electrocardiogram}} (ECG) on the occasion of the centennial of the instrument. Einthoven most likely developed the <b>string</b> <b>galvanometer</b> prior to 1901, the date of the first publication. The galvanometer made electrocardiography practical creating a new branch of medicine and even a new industry. In 1791 Galvani, in 1842 Mateucci and in 1855 Kolliker and Muller recorded, using the nerve muscle preparation, contraction of injured muscle, contraction of muscle when laid across a beating heart, and occasionally two contractions. In 1872 Lippmann introduced the capillary manometer. Using the capillary manometer Waller recorded for the first time from body surface voltage changes generated by the heart. Einthoven and Lewis dominated the early years of electrocardiography. The former made his contributions by 1913 while Lewis continued the studies of arrhythmias until 1920. The period following 1920 was influenced largely by Wilson. None did as much to advance ECG knowledge as did Wilson. The interest shifted to the theory of the ECG, abnormalities of wave form and of ECG leads. A major contribution of the ECG is in evaluation of ischemic heart disease and cardiac arrhythmias. Issues facing electrocardiography in the year 2000 include a shortage of experienced electrocardiographers, the advent of new noninvasive procedures and, paradoxically, wide acceptance of the ECG by the medical profession. The role of the computer in analysis of the clinical ECG is limited. The technique, while reasonably reliable for analysis of the normal tracing and some ECG waveforms, has serious limitations when applied to arrhythmias. The early hopes for “stand-alone” programs are yet to be realized...|$|E
40|$|Interest in {{clinical}} fetal electrocardiography {{dates back to}} 1906 when Cremer 4 published two tracings apparently showing fetal deflections of about 0. 5 mm. amplitude superimposed on the maternal electrocardiogram of a nine-months gravid woman. The records were obtained with a <b>string</b> <b>galvanometer</b> electrocardiograph with one lead on the abdomen {{and one in the}} vagina. During the next 25 years Foa 7 and Krumbhaar" 4 each reported a similar result in a single case, while Sachs 20 and Haynal and Kellner" 0 admitted failure in their fairly extensive experiments. No further progress occurred until 1930 when Maekawa and Toyoshima" 5 designed a valve amplifier which, when used with a <b>string</b> <b>galvanometer,</b> yielded an instrument with sufficient sensitivity to record the action current in excited nerve, and with this apparatus they obtained a fetal electrocardiogram by leading from the abdomen of a woman in labor. Their illustration is deficient in clarity, but it appears to reveal fetal waves of about 3 mm. amplitude. In 1938 Bell, 2 working with an amplified thermionic valve electrocardiograph, obtained definite fetal deflections of several millimeters amplitude with abdominal leads in 10 of 35 women {{in the last two months}} of pregnancy. In the same year Johnson 12 accidentally recorded tiny deflections, apparently of fetal origin, in the standard electrocardiogram of a woman at term. The amplification technics employed by Maekawa and Toyoshima and by Bell marked a distinct advance, but the character of the apparatus required was disadvantageous for the general application of the procedure. These widely scattered observations served at least to demonstrate that prenatal electrocardiography offered opportunity for further practical development. Until very recently, the chief work of clinical importance, as judged by the incidence of positive results, was that of Strassmann and his associates. 24 25 26 27 They used an ordinary string galvan...|$|E

By assuming that the electrical field generated in the trunk was equivalent {{to that of a}} centric doublet in a homogeneous spherical conductor and that the four electrodes were at the apices of a tetrahedron inscribed in this sphere, the experimental and the theoretical amplitudes of the deflections in the four leads could be compared. In general, it may be said that, with one exception, the deflections in the limb leads had the relative magnitudes expected. The deflections in the lead from the back were much smaller than anticipated. The last result is attributed to circumstances peculiar to the single experiment performed...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: During {{the past}} century the {{electrocardiogram}} (ECG) has established itself {{as an integral part}} of the cardiovascular examination. Since the first direct recordings of cardiac potentials by Waller in 1887, to the invention of the <b>string</b> <b>galvanometer</b> by Willem Einthoven in 1901, to use in the clinic by 1910, the electrocardiogram has become the most widely used clinical tool in the diagnosis of virtually every type of heart disease. Currently up to 20 million ECGs are performed annually in the United States alone. HYPOTHESIS: However, in this era of readily available echocardiography, an important caveat in the interpretation of the electrocardiogram has emerged: variants of intracardiac structures which might mimic disease on the ECG. METHODS: In this perspective various structural variants of intracardiac structures, specifically variants of papillary muscles and subaortic muscular bands, will be shown, together with their associated electrocardiographic changes, mimicking disease. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that in this era of readily available echocardiography, the electrocardiogram should be interpreted echocardiographically in instances where intricate variations are seen on the surface electrocardiogram...|$|E
40|$|In {{the early}} days of {{electrocardiography}} it was the recognized practice to place a patient's hands and left foot in three large saline pots. With the introduction of contact electrodes more than fifty years ago (James and Williams, 1910) and their later improvement by Cohn (1920), this ritual of partial immersion slowly gave way to swathing the limbs in bandages incorporating saline pads and malleable metal electrodes. Saline pads, however, brought new difficulties: bedclothes were liable to become moistened with saline in bedridden patients resulting in short-circuiting, and drying of the pads caused increasing skin resistance particularly during prolonged experimental observation. These disadvantages were overcome by Boas (1928) who dispensed with saline pads for the purpose of cardiotachometry. He found that two concave metal chest electrodes of one inch diameter filled with soft green soap as a contact material and tied to the chest by tapes gave consistently satisfactory tracings during three hours of continuous recording. Following this early demonstration that a simple contact medium, consisting of an almost neutral mixture of potassium oleate and glycerine, could give acceptable electrical recordings of the heart beat, it later became fashionable in electrocardiography to use an abrasive electrode jelly or paste rich in sodium chloride.

40|$|When {{standard}} leads or ordinary prncordial leads {{are taken}} with a <b>string</b> <b>galvanometer</b> electro-cardiograph, {{the resistance of the}} patient can be measured for each lead. However, no method has been described previously by which the resistance at any of the extremities or at any point on the body can be measured. A method for doing this is described below. Principle. When the standard leads are taken, the resistance of the patient as measured consists of the resistance of the skin at the points of electrode contact and the resistance of the body tissues and fluids. Thus, the resistance of the patient measured from lead I includes the resis-tance of the point of right-arm electrode contact, the resistance of the point of left-arm electrode contact, and the resistance of the body tissues and fluids. Similar situations hold for the resis-tances of the patient when lead II, III, or any bipolar lead is taken. However, {{for the purposes of this}} paper, we shall assume that practically all the resistance of the patient is centred at the two points of extremity-electrode contact for each lead. Studies have been made which indicate that the resistance of the body tissues and fluids is at most only a few hundred ohms (Richter and Woodruff, 1941). Even if the resistance of the body fluids and tissues were of magnitude, this would only change the ' results quantitatively but not qualitatively because the resistances of th...|$|E
40|$|Background: The first electrocardiograms (ECGs) {{have been}} {{recorded}} with a capillary electrometer in the late 19 th century by John Burdon Sanderson and Augustus Waller. In 1903 Willem Einthoven used the much more sensitive <b>string</b> <b>galvanometer</b> and was awarded Nobel Price in Medicine for this discovery. Though the physical principles of that era are still in use, {{there have been many}} advances but also challenges in cardiac electrophysiology over the last decades. One challenge is to record electrocardiograms of rather small animals such as mice and even smaller organisms such as their embryos. As mice belong to the most routinely used laboratory animals it is important to better understand their physiology and specific diseases. We therefore aimed to study whether it is feasible to measure electrical activities of embryonic mouse hearts. Methods and Results: For our studies we used substrate-integrated Microelectrode Arrays combined with newly developed stimulation electrodes to perform electrophysiological studies in these hearts. The system enabled us to perform ECG-like recordings with atrio-ventricular (anterograde) and ventriculo-atrial (retrograde) stimulation. The functional separation of atria and ventricles, indicated by a stable atrio-ventricular conduction time, occurred clearly earlier than the morphological separation. Electrical stimulation induced a reversible prolongation of the anterograde and retrograde conduction up to atrio-ventricular conduction blocks at higher frequencies. Conclusion: These results yield new insight into functional aspects of murine cardiac development, and may help as a new diagnostic tool to uncover the functional and electrophysiological background of embryonic cardiac phenotypes of genetically altered mice...|$|E
