25|$|Asian seiners â€“ In Asia, the <b>seine</b> <b>netter</b> {{usually has}} the {{wheelhouse}} forward {{and the working}} deck aft, {{in the manner of}} a stern trawler. However, in regions where the fishing effort is a labour-intensive, low-technology approach, they are often undecked and may be powered by outboards motors, or even by sail.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, {{officials}} arrested {{one of the}} two seine netters {{that operate}} at Muizenberg Beach for having a freezer full (over 1500 juvenile) of undersized Argyrosomus japonicus. The case was dropped until there was a public outcry and the department of public prosecution in Cape Town had decided to reopen the case. A decision should be made before the end of 2013 as to whether to charge the Muizenburg Beach <b>Seine</b> <b>Netter</b> or take no action and set a precedent for other operators to keep undersized fish.|$|E
25|$|<b>Seine</b> <b>netters</b> - {{the basic}} types of <b>seine</b> <b>netters</b> are the anchor seiners and Scottish seiner in {{northern}} Europe and the Asian seiners in Asia.|$|R
50|$|In South Africa, {{the fish}} is sought after by both {{commercial}} and recreational fishermen alike. Over the past 5 years, the fish stock has been declining rapidly. In a recent study, local beach seine operations were cited as being responsible for decimating the fish stocks. Little regard is taken by these <b>Seine</b> <b>Netters</b> to conserve these fish. There have been continual reports that these <b>Seine</b> <b>netters</b> at Muizenberg Beach in False Bay have kept every fish caught on occasions when no fisheries' official is on site. There has been photographic proof posted on the web showing pickups full of undersized fish leaving the beach. These fish {{are supposed to be}} released, but the <b>Seine</b> <b>netters</b> seek opportunity to keep every fish possible when no law official is present. The authorities have been slow to act on this matter.|$|R
50|$|Fishing boatsThe boats used at Stotfield, Seatown {{and finally}} Branderburgh {{were the same}} as those found across the entire Scottish east coast fishery. Chronologically, these were the two masted luggers, the Skaffies, Fifies and Zulus; then the powered Steam Drifters and <b>Seine</b> <b>Netters.</b>|$|R
25|$|Trumpeter whiting are {{considered}} to be good quality fish for consumption, having softer flesh than most other Australian species of sillaginid. The species is commonly targeted by both commercial and recreational fishermen. Large amounts of the species are taken by prawn trawlers and <b>seine</b> <b>netters</b> in bays, with catches in Moreton Bay alone exceeding 200 tonnes per year, and the catch much higher for the entire fishery. The fish are marketed fresh, with trawled fish being bruised and don't fetch as high a price as netted fish.|$|R
5000|$|The {{white steenbras}} (Lithognathus lithognathus) is {{a species of}} fish in the Sparidae family endemic to South Africa. [...] Due to overfishing, {{primarily}} by seine netting operations in False Bay, the white steenbras is now critically endangered {{and is about to}} become a 'no keep' species in South Africa. Massive breeding shoals are illegally wiped out by beach <b>seine</b> <b>netters</b> each year, with the authorities doing little to prevent this. The species was identified as a priority for research, management and conservation in a National Linefish Status Report ...|$|R
5000|$|The lesser {{electric}} ray (Narcine bancroftii), {{also known as}} the Brazilian {{electric ray}}, small electric ray, spotted torpedo ray, torpedofish or trembler, is a species of numbfish in the family Narcinidae found on the western coastal fringes of the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. It is a small slow-moving fish, living in the surf zone of sandy or muddy beaches. Here it is easily caught as bycatch by shrimp fisheries and <b>seine</b> <b>netters.</b> As a result, its numbers have declined rapidly and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated it as being [...] "critically endangered".|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Seine</b> <b>Netters</b> {{initially}} {{were converted}} Fifies and Zulus. From 1906, petrol and paraffin engines {{began to be}} installed, initially for auxiliary power. However, as more powerful engines became available, sails (apart from the mizzen sail) were dispensed with. Danish seine net boats were landing huge quantities of plaice and other white fish at English east coast ports. Lossiemouth fishermen noted this and a few {{decided to use the}} seine net. It was obvious that this would be successful, but they were still hampered by the design and cost of the majority steam boats. John Campbell, nephew of William Campbell who designed the first Zulu boat, saw that a new design was needed to accommodate the large amounts of white fish that could be caught. His boat, the Marigold, did very well and over a short period the entire fleet (the first in Scotland) converted to the seine net.|$|R
