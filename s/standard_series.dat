25|$|On the {{decision}} to build the BR <b>standard</b> <b>series</b> of locomotives, a series of class four tank engines was ordered, based on the ex-LMS Fairburn 2-6-4T with some modifications. The lineage of the class could therefore be tracked through the LMS/BR Class 4 2-6-4T locomotives back to the Fowler design of 1927.|$|E
25|$|The second {{prototype}} introduced {{upper wing}} radiators {{in lieu of}} the frontal radiator and large cut-outs in the lower wing roots, to improve the pilot's downward vision. These features proved unsuccessful and were omitted from subsequent aircraft. The third and fourth prototypes incorporated numerous modifications to the radiator, upper fuselage decking, fin and rudder. The fourth prototype was selected as the production <b>standard.</b> <b>Series</b> production commenced in October 1917, with 121 Dolphins delivered {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E
2500|$|Most modern {{keyboards}} basically {{conform to}} the layout specifications contained in parts 1, 2, and 5 of the international <b>standard</b> <b>series</b> ISO/IEC 9995.

[...] Based on this work, a well known ergonomic expert wrote a report which was adopted at the ISO Berlin meeting in 1985 and became the reference for keyboard layouts.|$|E

2500|$|Changes to the <b>standard</b> (<b>Series</b> 30) Eagle lineup for 1981 were notable. The GM [...] "Iron Duke" [...] {{inline-four}} engine became standard equipment, as AMC's [...] I6 became optional. The four {{was only}} available with the manual transmission in the Eagle sedans and wagons. The AMC inline-six was redesigned {{to produce more}} low-end torque, as well as made smoother running, more economical, and required less maintenance. The engineering improvements to the venerable AMC engine also reduced its weight by [...] to , thus making it [...] "the lightest in-line Six in the domestic industry".|$|E
2500|$|A major styling {{change was}} seen in 1958. The 98 series again had its own {{exclusive}} wheelbase of 126.5inches while sharing the more powerful Rocket V8 with the Super 88. Four body styles were available. <b>Standard</b> <b>series</b> equipment included four headlights, oil filter, turn signals, printed circuit instrument cluster, aluminum anodized grille, padded dash, foam rubber padded seat cushions, courtesy lights, parking brake light, special side moldings, chrome rocker panel moldings, Jetaway Hydramatic transmission, power steering and brakes, dual exhaust, electric clock, color accented wheel discs, and chrome wheel frames.

2500|$|Steelcase's most {{noteworthy}} products include [...] "The Victor" [...] wastebasket, a patented steel fireproof container {{released in}} 1914. The Victor became a top seller for the recently founded company and was eventually expanded into {{a line of}} products. The company released Multiple 15 desks in 1946, which introduced standardized desk sizing and became a universal industry <b>standard.</b> <b>Series</b> 9000 was released in 1973 and became Steelcase's most popular line of office systems. The Leap chair, introduced in 1999, sold 5,000 units a week during its first year and became the company's most popular release. The ergonomic office chair was designed with eight adjustable areas for users to control, including chair height, armrest positioning, lumbar support, seat depth, and back positioning. The chair was developed over four years, cost $35 million to design, and resulted in 11 academic studies and 23 patents. The company released the Gesture chair in 2013, {{which is designed to}} support the way workers naturally sit.|$|E

60|$|In your <b>Standard</b> <b>Series</b> I {{have placed}} a {{photograph}} of the south transept of Rouen Cathedral. Strictly speaking, all standards of Gothic are of the thirteenth century; but, in the fourteenth, certain qualities of richness are obtained by the diminution of restraint; out of which we must choose what is best in their kinds. The pedestals of the statues which once occupied the lateral recesses are, as you see, covered with groups of figures, enclosed each in a quatrefoil panel; the spaces between this panel and the enclosing square being filled with sculptures of animals.|$|E
60|$|Yes; and if {{they had}} had real ground to trot on, the Florentine would have shown you he knew how they should trot. But these have to make their way up the hill-side of other lands. Look to the example in your <b>standard</b> <b>series,</b> Hermes Eriophoros. You will find his motion among clouds {{represented}} precisely in this laboring, failing, half-kneeling attitude of limb. These forms, toiling up through the rippled sands of heaven, are--not horses;--they are clouds themselves, like horses, but only a little like. Look how their hoofs lose themselves, buried in the ripples of cloud; it makes one think of the quicksands of Morecambe Bay.|$|E
60|$|Considered, however, as a {{means of}} {{relieving}} more delicate textures, they are in some degree legitimate, being, in fact, a kind of chasing or jagging one part of the plate surface in order to throw out the delicate tints from the rough field. But the same effect was produced with less pains, and far more entertainment to the eye, by the older engravers, who employed purely ornamental variations of line; thus in Plate IV., opposite § 137, the drapery is sufficiently distinguished from the grass by the treatment of the latter as an ornamental arabesque. The grain of wood is elaborately engraved by Marc Antonio, with the same purpose, in the plate given in your <b>Standard</b> <b>Series.</b>|$|E

60|$|Now, once {{having the}} clue, {{you can work}} out the sequels for yourselves better than I can for you; and you will soon find even the {{earliest}} or slightest grotesques of Greek art become full of interest. For nothing is more wonderful than the depth of meaning which nations in their first days of thought, like children, can attach to the rudest symbols; and what to us is grotesque or ugly, like a little child's doll, can speak to them the loveliest things. I have brought you to-day a few more examples of early Greek vase painting, respecting which remember generally that its finest development is {{for the most part}} sepulchral. You have, in the first period, always energy in the figures, light in the sky or upon the figures;[13] in the second period, while the conception of the divine power remains the same, it is thought of as in repose, and the light is in the god, not in the sky; in the time of decline, the divine power is gradually disbelieved, and all form and light are lost together. With that period I wish you to have nothing to do. You shall not have a single example of it set before you, but shall rather learn to recognise afterwards what is base by its strangeness. These, which are to come early in the third group of your <b>Standard</b> <b>series,</b> will enough represent to you the elements of early and late conception in the Greek mind of the deities of light.|$|E
6000|$|But farther, you {{remember}}, I hope--for I {{said it in}} a {{way that}} I thought would shock you a little, that you might remember it--my statement, that art had never done more than this, never more than given the likeness of a noble human being. Not only so, but it very seldom does so much as this, and the best pictures that exist of the great schools are all portraits, or groups of portraits, often of very simple and nowise noble persons. You may have much more brilliant and impressive qualities in imaginative pictures; you may have figures scattered like clouds, or garlanded like flowers; you may have light and shade as of a tempest, and colour, as of the rainbow; but all that is child's play to the great men, though it is astonishment to us. Their real strength is tried to the utmost, and as far as I know, it is never elsewhere brought out so thoroughly, as in painting one man or woman, and the soul that was in them; nor that always the highest soul, but often only a thwarted one that was capable of height; or perhaps not even that, but faultful and poor, yet seen through, to the poor best of it, by the masterful sight. So that in order to put before you in your <b>Standard</b> <b>series</b> the best art possible, I am obliged, even from the very strongest men, to take the portraits, before I take the idealism. Nay, whatever is best in the great compositions themselves has depended on portraiture; and the study necessary to enable you to understand invention will also convince you that the mind of man never invented a greater thing than the form of man, animated by faithful life. Every attempt to refine or exalt such healthy humanity has weakened or caricatured it; or else consists only in giving it, to please our fancy, the wings of birds, or the eyes of antelopes. Whatever is truly great in either Greek or Christian art, is also restrictedly human; and even the raptures of the redeemed souls who enter [...] "celestemente ballando,"[188] the gate of Angelico's Paradise, were seen first in the terrestrial, yet most pure, mirth of Florentine maidens.|$|E
