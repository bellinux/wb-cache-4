5|$|On {{the east}} coast of Florida, Klaus {{produced}} 15foot (4.5m) waves and tides of 3feet (1m) above normal. Beach erosion was reported along {{the east coast}}, due to persistent easterly winds. As the remnant moisture of Klaus entered the <b>southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States, it produced heavy rainfall between 10–15inches (250–380mm) of rainfall in South Carolina, with slightly lower totals in North Carolina. In South Carolina, the rainfall caused a dam to burst, killing four people. About two days after the remnants of Klaus entered the <b>southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States, Tropical Storm Marco made landfall on northwestern Florida, dropping more heavy rainfall and causing heavy damage across the region.|$|E

5|$|Between {{at least}} 1981 and 1988, Grapico was {{distributed}} in only three states: Alabama, Florida and Georgia. In August 1988, Buffalo Rock {{announced that they}} would expand distribution of Grapico {{the rest of the}} <b>Southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States. The announcement coincided with the new, more contemporary Grapico packaging. By June 1990, Grapico was being sold in South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Many Phellodon {{species are}} {{known from the}} <b>southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States, {{where they have been}} {{extensively}} researched. According to Baird and colleagues, there are nine distinct Phellodon species from Great Smoky Mountains and the surrounding southern Appalachian Mountains. Three additional species from this area, P.mississippiensis, P.brunneo-olivaceus, and P.fuligineoalbus were added to the genus in 2013–14.|$|E
5|$|Pentastomida is {{an enigmatic}} group of parasites {{that may be}} related to maxillopod crustaceans. One species, Porocephalus crotali, is known from the marsh rice rat. It infects various mammals in the <b>southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States, which serve as {{intermediate}} hosts; snakes which eat those mammals are the definitive hosts.|$|E

5|$|The 1804 Antigua–Charleston {{hurricane}} was {{the most}} severe hurricane in Georgia since 1752, causing over 500deaths and at least $1.6million (1804USD) in damage throughout the <b>Southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States. Originating near Antigua on 3September, it initially drifted west-northwestward, soon nearing Puerto Rico. Throughout its existence in the Caribbean Sea, the hurricane damaged, destroyed, and capsized numerous ships, and at Saint Kitts, it {{was considered to be}} the worst since 1772. By 4September, the storm arrived at the Bahamas and turned northward before approaching the coast of northern Florida on 6September. The hurricane eventually came ashore along the coastline of Georgia and South Carolina while producing mostly southeasterly winds. A severe gale was noted in New England later that month, on 11and 12September, although it was likely not the same system as that which had passed through the Caribbean and <b>southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States earlier that month.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Tammy {{was a short}} lived {{tropical}} storm during October in the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season which caused minor damage to the <b>southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States. More significant, however, were its remnants, which contributed to the Northeast U.S. flooding of October 2005.|$|E
5|$|As the {{hurricane}} approached the <b>southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States, the U.S. Weather Bureau issued storm warnings from Vero Beach, Florida to Wilmington, North Carolina. Later, the agency issued a hurricane warning from Fernandina, Florida to Georgetown, South Carolina, prompting the threatened areas to enact storm preparations and for ships {{to return to}} harbor. Near Jacksonville, Florida, the United States Navy sent 17planes to the Naval Air Station Olathe in Olathe, Kansas.|$|E

5|$|As the {{previous}} storm was moving along the coastline of the <b>southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States, a new hurricane {{was observed in}} the western Caribbean Sea, about halfway between Honduras and Jamaica. Its intensity, based on a ship report, was estimated at 105mph (165km/h). The hurricane moved slowly west-northwestward, and another ship experienced its strong winds on October7. There were no further observations, so its complete track is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Bonnie's {{impact was}} minimal. Throughout the Caribbean Sea, the storm's effects {{consisted}} primarily of light rainfall, and in Florida, the precipitation caused flooding and minor damage. The tropical storm caused a tornado outbreak across the <b>Southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States which killed three people and inflicted over $1million (2004USD) in damage. Bonnie made landfall in Florida {{the day before}} Hurricane Charley struck.|$|E

5|$|Eastern and red wolves {{are also}} {{products}} of {{varying degrees of}} wolf-coyote hybridization. The eastern wolf probably {{was a result of}} a wolf-coyote admixture, combined with extensive backcrossing with parent gray wolf populations. The red wolf may have originated during a time of declining wolf populations in the <b>southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States, forcing a wolf-coyote hybridization as well as backcrossing with local parent coyote populations to the extent that about 75–80% of the modern red wolf's genome is of coyote derivation.|$|E

5|$|Gyromitra caroliniana, known {{commonly}} as the Carolina {{false morel}} or big red, is an ascomycete fungus {{of the genus}} Gyromitra, within the Pezizales group of fungi. It is found in hardwood forests of the <b>southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States, where it fruits in early spring soon after snowmelt. Although it is collected and eaten by some, there is some suggestion it may contain the toxic compound gyromitrin like its poisonous relative, the false morel G.esculenta, {{and for this reason}} it is usually not recommended for consumption.|$|E
