5|$|The ENA {{operates}} {{an instance}} of the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), an archival repository of <b>sequence</b> <b>reads</b> and analyses which are intended for public release. Originally called the Short Read Archive, the name was changed in anticipation of future sequencing technologies being able to produce longer <b>sequence</b> <b>reads.</b> Currently, the archive accepts <b>sequence</b> <b>reads</b> generated by next-generation sequencing platforms such as the Illumina Genome Analyzer and ABI SOLiD {{as well as some}} corresponding analyses and alignments. The SRA operates under the guidance of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) and is the fastest-growing repository in the ENA.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 the Sequence Read Archive made up {{approximately}} 95% of {{the base}} pair data available through the ENA, encompassing over 500,000,000,000 <b>sequence</b> <b>reads</b> made up of over 60 trillion (6×1013) base pairs. Almost half of this data was deposited {{in relation to the}} 1000 Genomes Project wherein the researchers published their sequence data to the SRA in real-time. In total, as of September 2010, 65% of the Sequence Read Archive was human genomic sequence, with another 16% relating to human metagenome <b>sequence</b> <b>reads.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following the uptake of Sanger sequencing, the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (then {{known as}} The Sanger Centre) had begun {{cataloguing}} <b>sequence</b> <b>reads</b> along with quality {{information in a}} database called The Trace Archive. The Trace Archive grew substantially with the commercialisation of high-throughput parallel sequencing technologies by companies such as Roche and Illumina.|$|E
50|$|The idea {{of using}} {{multiple}} sequencing technologies to facilitate genome assembly may become {{an idea of the}} past as the quality of long <b>sequencing</b> <b>reads</b> (hundreds or thousands of base pairs) approaches and exceeds the quality of current second generation <b>sequencing</b> <b>reads.</b> The computational difficulties that are encountered during genome assembly will also become a concept of the past as computation efficiency and performance increases. The development of more efficient sequencing algorithms and assembly programs is needed to develop more effective assembly approaches that can tandemly incorporate <b>sequencing</b> <b>reads</b> from multiple technologies.|$|R

5|$|DNA {{sequence}} {{data from}} genomic and metagenomic projects are essentially the same, but genomic sequence data offers higher coverage while metagenomic data is usually highly non-redundant. Furthermore, {{the increased use}} of second-generation sequencing technologies with short read lengths means that much of future metagenomic data will be error-prone. Taken in combination, these factors make the assembly of metagenomic <b>sequence</b> <b>reads</b> into genomes difficult and unreliable. Misassemblies are caused by the presence of repetitive DNA sequences that make assembly especially difficult because of the difference in the relative abundance of species present in the sample. Misassemblies can also involve the combination of sequences from more than one species into chimeric contigs.|$|E
5|$|The first metagenomic studies {{conducted}} using high-throughput sequencing used massively parallel 454 pyrosequencing. Three other technologies commonly applied to environmental sampling are the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine, the Illumina MiSeq or HiSeq and the Applied Biosystems SOLiD system. These techniques for sequencing DNA generate shorter fragments than Sanger sequencing; Ion Torrent PGM System and 454 pyrosequencing typically produces ~400bp reads, Illumina MiSeq produces 400-700bp reads (depending on whether paired end options are used), and SOLiD produce 25-75bp reads. Historically, these read lengths were significantly {{shorter than the}} typical Sanger sequencing read length of ~750bp, however the Illumina technology is quickly coming close to this benchmark. However, this limitation is compensated for by the much larger number of <b>sequence</b> <b>reads.</b> In 2009, pyrosequenced metagenomes generate 200–500megabases, and Illumina platforms generate around 20–50gigabases, but these outputs have increased by orders of magnitude in recent years. An additional advantage to high throughput sequencing is that this technique does not require cloning the DNA before sequencing, removing {{one of the main}} biases and bottlenecks in environmental sampling.|$|E
25|$|De novo {{assembly}} is {{the alternative}} genome assembly approach to reference alignment. It {{refers to the}} reconstruction of whole genome sequences entirely from raw <b>sequence</b> <b>reads.</b> This method would be chosen {{when there is no}} reference genome, when the species of the given organism is unknown as in metagenomics, or when there exist genetic variants of interest that may not be detected by reference genome alignment.|$|E

The DDBJ collected and released 3 [*] 637 [*] 446 entries/ 2 [*] 272 [*] 231 [*] 889 bases between July 2009 and June 2010.

50|$|Gene duplications {{can also}} be {{identified}} {{through the use of}} next-generation sequencing platforms. The simplest means to identify duplications in genomic resequencing data is through the use of paired-end <b>sequencing</b> <b>reads.</b> Tandem duplications are indicated by <b>sequencing</b> <b>read</b> pairs which map in abnormal orientations. Through a combination of increased sequence coverage and abnormal mapping orientation, it is possible to identify duplications in genomic sequencing data.|$|R
25|$|RNA-Seq {{experiments}} {{generate a}} {{large volume of}} raw <b>sequence</b> <b>reads,</b> which have to be processed to yield useful information. Data analysis usually requires a combination of bioinformatics software tools (see also List of RNA-Seq bioinformatics tools) that {{vary according to the}} experimental design and goals. The process can be broken down into four stages: quality control, alignment, quantification, and differential expression. Most popular RNA-Seq programs are run from a command-line interface, either in a Unix environment or within the R/Bioconductor statistical environment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sequence</b> <b>reads</b> are not perfect, so the {{accuracy}} of each base in the sequence needs to be estimated for downstream analyses. Raw data is examined for: high quality scores for base calls, GC content matches the expected distribution, the over representation of particular short sequence motifs (k-mers), and an unexpectedly high read duplication rate. Several software options exist for sequence quality analysis, including FastQC and FaQCs. Abnormalities identified may be removed by trimming, or tagged for special treatment during later processes.|$|E
25|$|Given {{the short}} reads {{produced}} by {{the current generation of}} sequencing technologies, de novo assembly is a major computational problem. It is normally approached by an iterative process of finding and connecting <b>sequence</b> <b>reads</b> with sensible overlaps. Various computational and statistical techniques, such as de bruijn graphs and overlap layout consensus graphs, have been leveraged to solve this problem. Nonetheless, due to the highly repetitive nature of eukaryotic genomes, accurate and complete reconstruction of genome sequences in de novo assembly remains challenging. Pair end reads have been posed as a possible solution, though exact fragment lengths are often unknown and must be approximated.|$|E
40|$|Metagenomic {{sequencing}} projects yield numerous <b>sequencing</b> <b>reads</b> of {{a diverse}} range of uncultivated and mostly yet unknown microorganisms. In many cases, these <b>sequencing</b> <b>reads</b> cannot be assembled into longer contigs.

After elimination of duplicates, each <b>sequencing</b> <b>read</b> points to {{a position on the}} genome where one transposition (or cutting) event took place during the experiment. One can then assign a cut count for each genomic position and create a signal with base-pair resolution.|$|R

25|$|Sequencing is {{emerging}} as an important tool in medicine, for example in cancer research. Here, the ability to detect heterozygous mutations is important and this can only be done if the sequence of the diploid genome is obtained. In the pioneering efforts to sequence individuals, Levy et al. and Wheeler et al., who sequenced Craig Venter and Jim Watson, respectively, outlined models for covering both alleles in a genome. Wendl and Wilson followed with a more general theory that allowed for an arbitrary number of coverings of each allele and arbitrary ploidy. These results point to the general conclusion {{that the amount of}} data needed for such projects is significantly higher than for traditional haploid projects. Generally, at least 30-fold redundancy, i.e. each nucleotide spanned by an average of 30 <b>sequence</b> <b>reads,</b> is now standard.|$|E
25|$|For {{much of its}} history, the {{technology}} underlying shotgun sequencing was the classical chain-termination method or 'Sanger method', {{which is based on}} the selective incorporation of chain-terminating dideoxynucleotides by DNA polymerase during in vitro DNA replication. Recently, shotgun sequencing has been supplanted by high-throughput sequencing methods, especially for large-scale, automated genome analyses. However, the Sanger method remains in wide use, primarily for smaller-scale projects and for obtaining especially long contiguous DNA <b>sequence</b> <b>reads</b> (>500 nucleotides). Chain-termination methods require a single-stranded DNA template, a DNA primer, a DNA polymerase, normal deoxynucleosidetriphosphates (dNTPs), and modified nucleotides (dideoxyNTPs) that terminate DNA strand elongation. These chain-terminating nucleotides lack a 3'-OH group required for the formation of a phosphodiester bond between two nucleotides, causing DNA polymerase to cease extension of DNA when a ddNTP is incorporated. The ddNTPs may be radioactively or fluorescently labelled for detection in DNA sequencers. Typically, these machines can sequence up to 96 DNA samples in a single batch (run) in up to 48 runs a day.|$|E
