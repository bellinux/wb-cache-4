5|$|The season did {{not start}} well when Hill <b>spun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> second place shortly {{after the start of}} the South African Grand Prix and failed to finish the race after colliding with Alex Zanardi on lap 16. At the Brazilian Grand Prix, Hill {{qualified}} and spent {{the early stages of the}} race running second behind Prost, and then took the lead when Prost crashed out, but was relegated back to second by another triple world champion, Ayrton Senna. Nevertheless, the race still gave Hill his first podium finish.|$|E
5|$|On lap 43 of the race, Bianchi {{lost control}} {{of his car and}} veered right towards the run-off area {{on the outside of the}} Dunlop Curve (turn seven) of the Suzuka Circuit. He {{collided}} with the rear of a tractor crane tending to the removal of Adrian Sutil's Sauber after Sutil had <b>spun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> control and crashed in the same area a lap before. Spectators' video footage and photographs of the accident revealed that the left side of Bianchi's Marussia car was extensively damaged and the roll bar destroyed as it slid under the tractor crane. The impact was such that the tractor crane was partially jolted off the ground causing Sutil's Sauber, which was suspended in the air by the crane, to fall back to the ground. The race was stopped and Lewis Hamilton was declared the winner.|$|E
5|$|The school began {{replacing}} its Tiger Moths with CAC Wackett Trainers in January 1942. No.11 EFTS absorbed No.3 EFTS's instructors, {{students and}} Wackett Trainers in April, {{shortly before the}} latter unit disbanded. The same month at Benalla, thirty-two United States Army Air Corps pilots undertook four weeks of flying in the Wacketts. On 5September 1942, one of the Wacketts crashed after apparently stalling on takeoff, killing the trainee and seriously injuring the pilot. The Wackett Trainers were taken out of service for upgrades in February 1943, and the school again began operating Tiger Moths. One pilot was killed and another seriously injured when their Tiger Moths collided shortly after takeoff on 15June. On 7July, one of the Tiger Moths crashed during a night-flying exercise just east of Benalla, killing both pilots. Another Tiger Moth and its pilot were lost in a crash west of Benalla on 20October 1943. On 14May 1944, a pilot was killed and a trainee seriously injured when their Tiger Moth <b>spun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> control during an instrument test north of Benalla.|$|E

About 3,000 men from the Elena and Victoria mines went on strike, going together to the Carolina and Ștefan mines.

25|$|Cheating {{allegations}} {{were made at}} {{the first round of}} the 1994 season, the Brazilian Grand Prix. On lap21 of the race, Senna in the Williams who was leading the race, made a pit stop, with Michael Schumacher in the Benetton close behind. The Benetton pitcrew made a very quick stop for Schumacher, getting him out in front of Senna to lead the race. Schumacher went on to win the Grand Prix after Senna <b>spun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the race. This sparked speculation that Benetton were using a system to make quicker pit stops than their rivals.|$|E

Huff and Menu passed on the penultimate lap, while Muller passed Bennani on the final lap. Independent trophy contender Michelisz <b>spun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the race on the first lap, allowing trophy rival Oriola to close the points gap to 12. The overall championship was once again a tie between Huff and Muller.|$|E
25|$|Cambridge and its {{surrounds}} {{are sometimes}} referred to as Silicon Fen, an allusion to Silicon Valley, because of the density of high-tech businesses and technology incubators that have developed on science parks around the city. Many of these parks and buildings are owned or leased by university colleges, and the companies often have been <b>spun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the university. Cambridge Science Park, which is the largest commercial R centre in Europe, is owned by Trinity College; St John's is the landlord of St John's Innovation Centre. Technology companies include Abcam, CSR, ARM Limited, CamSemi, Jagex and Sinclair. Microsoft has located its Microsoft Research UK offices in West Cambridge, separate from the main Microsoft UK campus in Reading, and also has an office on Station Road.|$|E
25|$|In the Food City 500 at Bristol, Johnson {{finished}} 23rd {{after making}} an unscheduled pit stop {{due to a}} loose lug nut on lap 300. At Richmond, he led 44 laps early in the race and finished 3rd. At Talladega, Johnson was spun by Paul Menard and got involved in a multi-car accident with 28 laps to go, finishing 22nd. Johnson's streak of misfortune continued through the next several months, crashing out at Dover, Pocono, Daytona, Kentucky and at Watkins Glen, where he finished last {{for the first time}} in his career. His top-10 finishes during the period came only in the Coca-Cola 600 and Brickyard 400, where he finished 3rd in both races. Johnson finished 7th and 6th at Bristol and Michigan the following two weeks, but finished 33rd at Darlington after he <b>spun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> turn 4. Johnson then finished 11th at Richmond. He qualified 8th for the Chase.|$|E

25|$|At the {{penultimate}} {{round of}} the championship in Japan at Suzuka, where Senna and Prost collided the previous year, Senna took pole ahead of Prost. Before qualifying, Senna had sought assurances from the organisers to move pole position left onto the clean side of the racetrack. After qualifying, FIA president Balestre denied Senna's request, leaving Senna to start on the dirty right side, thus favouring Prost on the left. In addition, as revealed by F1 journalist Maurice Hamilton, the FIA had warned that crossing the yellow line of the pit exit {{on the right to}} better position oneself at the first corner would have not been appropriate, further infuriating Senna. At the beginning of the race, Prost pulled ahead of Senna, who immediately tried to repass Prost at the first corner. While Prost turned in, Senna kept his foot on the accelerator and the cars collided at 270km/h (170mph) and <b>spun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the race, making Senna world champion.|$|E
25|$|Even {{with the}} {{conditions}} treacherous, 200,000 spectators turned {{up for the}} race on Sunday afternoon. The race {{turned out to be}} a one-man show by Scotsman Jackie Stewart. While Graham Hill took the lead at the start, by the end of the first lap Stewart had moved into first place and built a nine-second lead. He put his superior Dunlop wet tires to great effect and by the end of lap 2, had extended his lead to 34 seconds. When the race ended after 14 laps, Stewart crossed the line more than 4 minutes in front of second placed Hill. The eventual World Champion had spun on lap 11, but was able to get out of the car, push it into the right direction and keep going before third-placed Jochen Rindt could catch up. Chris Amon had battled with Hill for 11 laps over second place, rarely having more than a second between the two, until Amon <b>spun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the race on the same lap as Hill did.|$|E
25|$|In 1989 he {{had five}} wins and {{finished}} in the top five in every race he completed, giving him a CART championship. Among his wins was a dominant performance in the 1989 Indianapolis 500 where he led 158 of 200 laps and won by 2 laps, but only after a dramatic duel with Al Unser, Jr. in the closing laps of the race. With both drivers a commanding six laps ahead of third place Raul Boesel, Unser ran down Fittipaldi after a late-race restart and passed him for the lead on lap 196. Three laps later, Fittipaldi used lapped traffic to his advantage to pull alongside Unser on the backstretch. Neither driver would give way, and the two cars touched wheels as they went through turn three side by side. Unser's car <b>spun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> control to hit the outside wall, while Fittipaldi was able to maintain sufficient control to keep his car moving straight. In spite of the altercation, Unser saluted Fittipaldi from the infield with a double thumbs-up sign as he brought his car through turns three and four on the subsequent caution-slowed final lap.|$|E
