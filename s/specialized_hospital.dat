25|$|Major {{developments}} {{in the field of}} psychiatry, which occurred due to the rapid development of psycho-pharmacological-therapy, opened the possibility of a <b>specialized</b> <b>hospital.</b> The Institute of Mental Health in Belgrade was founded by Sc.D. Slavka Morić-Petrović in cooperation with Sc.D. Dušan Petrović, Sc.D. Milan Popović, Sc.D. Miroslav Antonijević, Sc.D. Predrag Kaličanin and several other psychiatrists. Architectural design was done by Vladeta Stojaković. Following building approval, the Institute's cornerstone was placed on June 5, 1960. The Institute of Mental Health was officially opened on April 14, 1963, in the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.|$|E

25|$|In {{some parts}} of the world, the {{emergency}} medical service also encompasses the role of moving patients from one medical facility to an alternative one; usually to facilitate the provision of a higher level or more specialized field of care but also to transfer patients from a specialized facility to a local hospital or nursing home when they no longer require the services of that <b>specialized</b> <b>hospital,</b> such as following successful cardiac catheterization due to a heart attack. In such services, the EMS is not summoned by members of the public but by clinical professionals (e.g. physicians or nurses) in the referring facility. Specialized hospitals that provide higher levels of care may include services such as neonatal intensive care (NICU), pediatric intensive care (PICU), state regional burn centres, specialized care for spinal injury and/or neurosurgery, regional stroke centers, specialized cardiac care (Cardiac catheterization), and specialized/regional trauma care.|$|E
40|$|The {{quest to}} reduce health care cost {{has led many}} industrialized nations to reduce {{hospital}} length of stay. This paper uses instrumental variable estimation to estimate the effect of early discharge on readmission rates of maternity patients in British Columbia, Canada and investigates how the impact varied according to hospitals' degree of specialization. Principal component {{analysis was used to}} classify the hospitals according to their degree of specialization. The results show that the early discharge policy increased readmission rates, and this increase, varied according to the degree of specialization of the hospital. The increase in readmission rate is observed to be lowest in the very highly <b>specialized</b> <b>hospitals</b> and highest in the moderately <b>specialized</b> <b>hospitals.</b> The highly <b>specialized</b> <b>hospitals</b> are, however, capable of using resources most efficiently at least partly due to a reduction in the use of invasive procedures. ...|$|R

40|$|Iran {{developed}} a national hospital performance measurement program (HPMP) {{which has been}} implemented annually throughout its hospitals since 1997. However, little is known yet about its development {{and the impact of}} the program on hospital performance. This study aims to describe the development and process of implementation of the HPMP, and to explore the impact on hospital performance by looking at the trends of performance scores of all different types of Iranian hospitals. This was a mixed method study consisting of longitudinal data and qualitative document analysis. Hospital performance data over the period of 2002 to 2008 was analysed. Iran instituted a comprehensive HPMP and implemented it in all hospitals since 1997. The program followed a phased development to stimulate performance and quality improvement in hospitals. Overall, the program has had a positive impact on the performance of general and <b>specialized</b> <b>hospitals.</b> The performance of general hospitals {{did not appear to be}} associated with their size or affiliated university ranking. However, the rate of performance improvement of general teaching and private hospitals was significantly lower than the average improvement rate of all general hospitals. There was no relationship between teaching status of the <b>specialized</b> <b>hospitals</b> and their level of performance. However, the performance of the governmental <b>specialized</b> <b>hospitals</b> showed a substantial decline over time. Moreover, among <b>specialized</b> <b>hospitals,</b> the bigger sized and those affiliated with higher ranked universities, reported better performance. Overall, the development and implementation of an obligatory HPMP in Iran has improved the level of performance in general and <b>specialized</b> <b>hospitals.</b> However, there is room for further performance improvement especially in the general teaching, private, and governmental <b>specialized</b> <b>hospitals.</b> Reconsidering the ownership type, funding mechanisms and responsibility for the HPMP may have an impact on the absolute level of performance and improvement capacity of hospitals. In addition, the role and composition of survey teams, mechanism of implementation according to the characteristics of hospitals, and updating standards are important factors to promote performance improvement and hospital accreditation requirement...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} hospital and gynecologist level of specialization and volume on surgical results and on survival of ovarian cancer patients. METHODS: Data were collected from 1077 ovarian cancer patients treated from 1996 to 2003 in {{a random sample of}} 18 Dutch hospitals. Hospitals and gynecologists were classified according to specialization (general, semi-specialized or specialized) and by volume ( 12 cases/year). Outcomes were percentage of adequately staged and optimally debulked patients and length of overall survival. Data were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression (surgical results) and Cox regression (survival). RESULTS: The level of specialization and the volume of hospitals and of gynecologists were strongly related to the proportion of adequately staged patients (adjusted odds ratio (OR) <b>specialized</b> <b>hospitals</b> 3. 9 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 2. 0 - 7. 6); specialized gynecologists 9. 5 (95 % CI 4. 7 - 19)). Patients with stage III disease had a higher chance of optimal debulking when treated in <b>specialized</b> <b>hospitals</b> (adjusted OR 1. 7 (95 % CI 1. 1 - 2. 7)) or by high volume gynecologists (adjusted OR 2. 8 (95 % CI 1. 4 - 5. 7)). Overall survival was best in patients treated in <b>specialized</b> <b>hospitals</b> and by high-volume gynecologists. CONCLUSION: The specialization level of hospitals and the surgical volume of gynecologists positively influence outcomes of surgery and survival. Concentration of ovarian cancer care thus seems warranted...|$|R
40|$|We analyze {{mortality}} and follow-up costs {{of heart attack}} patients using administrative data from Austria from 2002 - 2011. As treatment intensity in a hospital largely depends on whether it has a catheterization laboratory, {{we focus on the}} effects of patients' initial admission to these <b>specialized</b> <b>hospitals.</b> To account for the nonrandom selection of patients into hospitals, we exploit individuals' place of residence as a source of exogenous variation in an instrumental variable framework. We find that the initial admission to <b>specialized</b> <b>hospitals</b> increases patients' survival chances substantially. The effect on 3 -year mortality is - 9. 5 percentage points. A separation of the sample into subgroups shows the strongest effects in relative terms for patients below the age of 65.
