25|$|Vaccination {{has been}} opposed on {{religious}} grounds ever {{since it was}} introduced. Some Christian opponents argued, when vaccination was first becoming widespread, that if God had decreed that <b>someone</b> <b>should</b> die of smallpox, {{it would be a}} sin to thwart God's will via vaccination. Religious opposition continues to the present day, on various grounds, raising ethical difficulties when the number of unvaccinated children threatens harm to the entire population. Many governments allow parents to opt out of their children's otherwise mandatory vaccinations for religious reasons; some parents falsely claim religious beliefs to get vaccination exemptions.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{opinions}} about the halakhic date line are structured {{as a response to}} the question of what days <b>someone</b> <b>should</b> observe as Shabbat and Jewish holidays. Shabbat occurs every seven days at any location on earth. It is normally thought to occur on Saturday—or more precisely, from Friday at sundown to Saturday at nightfall. But if the halakhic date line is not identical to the conventional Date Line, it is possible that what is Saturday with respect to the conventional Date Line is not Saturday with respect to the halakhic date line, at least in some places.|$|E

25|$|The {{story is}} told by two {{alternating}} first person narrators. One of them is Roy Hubert Straitley, a 65-year-old Classics master who has devoted all his life to St Oswald's and who now, {{nearing the end of}} his professional career, finds himself the last surviving member of the dying breed of classics teachers. The other narrator is the perpetrator, whose identity is only revealed in the final part of the book, and whose plotting the reader is able to follow first hand. Time and again, flashbacks detail the second narrator's childhood, adolescence and young adulthood, thus giving a fully rounded picture of a deranged mind and explaining why <b>someone</b> <b>should</b> want to demolish a school's reputation and do harm to members of the staff.|$|E
500|$|The terms [...] "benign" [...] and [...] "pseudotumor" [...] {{derive from}} the fact that {{increased}} intracranial pressure may be associated with brain tumors. Those patients in whom no tumour was found were therefore diagnosed with [...] "pseudotumor cerebri" [...] (a disease mimicking a brain tumor). The disease was renamed benign intracranial hypertension in 1955 to distinguish it from intracranial hypertension due to life-threatening diseases (such as cancer); however, this was also felt to be misleading because any disease that can blind <b>someone</b> <b>should</b> not be thought of as benign, and the name was therefore revised in 1989 to [...] "idiopathic (of no identifiable cause) intracranial hypertension".|$|E

In the tape, Beyoncé sang drastically off-key. A corresponding video was leaked onto the internet, and it went viral. It was even played on American radio stations on April 21, 2009; Howard Stern played the recording, describing it as [...] "the unedited board mix" [...] of Beyoncé's live performance. According to Us Weekly, Mathew Knowles {{was the first to}} cast doubt on the recording's authenticity, saying that the tape seemed to have been altered. He added that [...] "at 12 years into Beyoncé's career, the last thing <b>someone</b> <b>should</b> be questioning is her vocal ability.

Chef Fergus Henderson explained this meat attitude as [...] "People often don't want meat to look like meat. They want it to be neatly wrapped in plastic from a supermarket." [...] People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) condemned the dress, releasing a statement that said [...] "wearing a dress made from cuts of dead cows is offensive enough to bring comment, but <b>someone</b> <b>should</b> whisper in her ear that more people are upset by butchery than are impressed by it." [...] The Vegetarian Society also condemned the dress, releasing a statement that said [...] "No matter how beautifully it is presented, flesh from a tortured animal is flesh from a tortured animal.

[...] René Jalbert, the sergeant-at-arms who persuaded Denis Lortie to surrender during his 1984 attack, said that <b>someone</b> <b>should</b> have intervened at least to distract Lépine, but acknowledged that [...] "ordinary citizens cannot be expected to react heroically in the midst of terror." [...] Newspaper columnist Mark Steyn suggested that male inaction during the massacre illustrated a [...] "culture of passivity" [...] prevalent among men in Canada, which enabled Lépine's shooting spree: [...] "Yet the defining image of contemporary Canadian maleness is not M Lepine/Gharbi but the professors and the men in that classroom, who, ordered to leave by the lone gunman, meekly did so, and abandoned their female classmates to their fate—an act of abdication that would have been unthinkable in almost any other culture throughout human history." ...|$|E

500|$|Media {{reviews of}} Lions were mixed. Numerous writers {{detected}} a Led Zeppelin influence (which was praised by some, but panned by others) and attributed it to The Black Crowes' recent tour with Jimmy Page. [...] Dave McKenna, writing for The Washington Post, compared Steve Gorman's drumming {{to that of}} John Bonham and found analogs to specific guitar and keyboard tones in Led Zeppelin albums. [...] Nigel Williamson of The Times found similarities in Chris Robinson's voice on [...] "Come On" [...] to that of Robert Plant, and wrote that the song [...] "could almost be a Led ZeppelinII cast off." [...] Other reviewers noted similarities to Aerosmith; Howard Cohen of The Miami Herald called [...] "Lickin'" [...] "the best Aerosmith single that band hasn't recorded in years." [...] The perceived lack of originality, though, turned off some critics. The Herald Suns Andrew McUtchen inferred [...] "The Black Crowes are unaware it's no longer the '70s and after one listen to Lions ... it's clear <b>someone</b> <b>should</b> tell them." [...] Everett True of Playlouder concurred, writing [...] "It's blindingly obvious the Crowes are imitators, and always will be", though Elysa Gardner, writing for USA Today, recognized the band [...] "exhibit an energy and dexterity that compensate—at least somewhat—for their lack of invention." ...|$|E
2500|$|His film Strangers on a Train (1951) {{was based}} on the novel by Patricia Highsmith. In it, Hitchcock {{combined}} many elements from his preceding films. He approached Dashiell Hammett to write the dialogue, but Raymond Chandler took over, then left over disagreements with the director. In the film, two men casually meet, one of whom speculates on a foolproof method to murder; he suggests that two people, each wishing to do away with <b>someone,</b> <b>should</b> each perform the other's murder. Farley Granger's role was as the innocent victim of the scheme, while Robert Walker, previously known for [...] "boy-next-door" [...] roles, played the villain.

[...] In his new term in the Assembly after the 1928 election, he took a position against Bessarabian autonomism, describing it as a [...] "Russian formula" [...] and a [...] "worrisome" [...] threat.

They don't allow me to defend myself in an open court {{to the public and}} convince a jury that what I did was to their benefit. ...

2500|$|The {{traditional}} Finnish rakovalkea (literally [...] "slit bonfire") {{is constructed}} by placing one long piece of fuel wood atop another, parallel, and bolstering {{them in place}} with four sturdy posts driven into the ground. (Traditionally, whole un-split tree trunks provide the fuel wood.) Kindling and tinder are placed between the logs in sufficient quantity (while avoiding the very ends) to raise the upper log and allow ventilation. The tinder is always lit at the center so the bolstering posts do not burn prematurely. The rakovalkea has two excellent features. First, it burns slowly but steadily when lit; {{it does not require}} arduous maintenance, but burns for a very long time. A well constructed rakovalkea of two thick logs of two meters in length can warm two lean-to shelters for a whole sleeping shift. The construction causes the logs themselves to protect the fire from the wind. Thus, exposure to smoke is unlikely for the sleepers; nevertheless <b>someone</b> <b>should</b> always watch in case of an emergency. Second, it can be easily scaled to larger sizes (for a feast) limited only by the length of available tree trunks.|$|E
