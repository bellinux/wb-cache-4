This property predisposes the <b>shales</b> of the Nsukka Formation to deform in a ductile manner, which is a key attribute of good seal rocks (Downey 1994). <b>Shales</b> of the Mamu and Enugu Formations may deform in a brittle manner with associated joints and faults, when subjected to shear stress (Okogbue and Ugwoke 2012).|$|R

40|$|The Ordos basin, {{situated}} in northwestern China, {{is the biggest}} Mesozoic terrigenous sedimentary basin developed on the North China Platform. The geochemical data imply that <b>shales</b> from the Ordos basin were mainly derived from a source area with an average Archaean granite composition. High Na 2 O contents, very limited variation of Ti/Zr, and ratios of (Gd/Yb) N higher than 2. 0 indicate that Ordos <b>shales</b> are less mature than typical post-Archaean <b>shales</b> such as NASC and PAAS. Highly variable CIA values (chemical index of weathering) indicate that most Ordos <b>shales</b> are less weathered than NASC and PAAS. Ratios of (La/Sm) N and total REE contents for the Ordos <b>shales</b> are positively correlated with CIA, whereas those of (Gd/Yb) N inversely vary with CIA. These suggest that the weathering of source rocks {{is responsible for the}} REE fractionation in the <b>shales</b> of the Ordos basin. Depletion of Eu in clay-sized fractions of the Ordos <b>shales</b> decreases with enhanced crystallinity of illite. Considering that ratios of Fe 3 +/Fe 2 + in the <b>shales</b> decrease with the increase of crystallinity of chlorites, we propose that Eu anomalies in <b>shales</b> are directly related to the reduction of iron during burial diagenesis. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.

5|$|In June 1916, the Russian {{geologist}} Nikolay Pogrebov oversaw mining of {{the first}} tonnes of oil <b>shale</b> at Pavandu and delivered it to Saint Petersburg (then Petrograd) Polytechnic Institute for large-scale experiments. These events marking {{the beginning of the}} Estonian oil <b>shale</b> industry took place {{more than half a century}} after an oil <b>shale</b> industry had emerged in Scotland, the leading oil <b>shale</b> industry in 1916, and a decade before the industry emerged in China, which, besides Estonia, is today the other leading oil shale-exploiting country. In 1916 a total of 640–690tonnes of oil <b>shale</b> were sent to Saint Petersburg for testing. The tests proved that the oil <b>shale</b> was suitable for combustion as a solid fuel and for extraction of oil <b>shale</b> gas and <b>shale</b> oil. Based on these promising results, a plan for oil <b>shale</b> mining in Estonia was presented to the Emperor Nicholas II on 3 January 1917. On 13 February 1917, the Council of Ministers of Russia allocated 1.2million rubles to purchase land and start mining activities. After the February Revolution, the Russian Provisional Government appointed a special commissioner for oil <b>shale</b> purchasing and stockpiling who began preliminary work for the digging of an oil <b>shale</b> mine at Pavandu, with full-scale construction carried out by about 500workers, including war prisoners, in the summer of 1917. After the October Revolution, financing ceased and construction stopped. Two private Saint Petersburg firms, established specially for oil <b>shale</b> mining, Böckel& Co. and Mutschnik& Co., which in the fall of 1916 had begun surface mining at Kukruse and Järve, respectively, also terminated their mining activities in 1917.|$|E

5|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, Estonian oil <b>shale</b> was {{described}} by several scientists and used as a low-grade fuel. Its use in industry commenced in 1916. Production of <b>shale</b> oil began in 1921 and oil <b>shale</b> was first used to generate electrical power in 1924. Shortly thereafter, systematic research into oil <b>shale</b> and its products began, and in 1938 a department of mining was established at Tallinn Technical University. After World War II, Estonian oil <b>shale</b> gas was used in Saint Petersburg (then called Leningrad) and in northern cities in Estonia {{as a substitute for}} natural gas. Increased need for electricity in the north-west of the Soviet Union led to the construction of large oil shale-fired power stations. Oil <b>shale</b> extraction peaked in 1980. Subsequently, the launch of nuclear reactors in Russia, particularly the Leningrad Nuclear Power Station, reduced demand for electricity produced from oil <b>shale,</b> and, along with a post-Soviet restructuring of the industry in the 1990s, led to a decrease in oil <b>shale</b> mining.
