40|$|About {{crowding}} – How the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> our <b>dwellings</b> {{became a}} welfare problem Housing policy documents {{have traditionally been}} studied by political scientists, resulting in {{a lack of interest}} in the private aspects of housing policy. Hence, this paper uses the example of crowding standards to examine how a previously private matter, the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> our <b>dwelling,</b> became a concern of the state. Official governmental documents are analyzed with the help of discourse theory, working on the supposition that the need of the population and the framing of a problem changes over time. The first official standard of crowding, formulated in 1946 argue for larger dwelling size in order to increase the <b>size</b> and quality <b>of</b> the Swedish population. The second standard, formulated in 1965, {{is based on the assumption}} that the population, defined as consumers, demands larger sized homes. The final standard, formulated in 1975, claims that larger sized homes is a social right. Sociologisk Forsknings digitala arkiv</p...|$|R

This study {{examines}} {{the management of}} household water demand through a pricing policy for achieving the objectives of cost recovery, efficient water use, and equitable allocation of water resources. To this end, a demand function is estimated using household level data about water consumption and socio-economic characteristics of 156 households supplied by WASA, Lahore, in the period 2004 - 2006. The results show that domestic water demand is highly elastic to price at the existing tariff rates.

Parameters τ and h are the time scale and the space scale for describing the predator–prey dynamics, respectively. Since the growth, death, feeding, and migration of predator and prey individuals always occur periodically, the dynamics of a predator–prey system can be observed by a particular time scale, which can be defined by the generation span of the predator and prey populations and measures the regeneration time of both populations. On the other hand, the space scale on which spatial movements of predator and prey take place can be defined by maximum <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>dwelling</b> sites of predator and prey individuals.|$|E

40|$|International audienceUrban density {{measures}} are broadly used in urban planning as tools for calculating development yields, defining indicative targets, or development controls. A century ago Raymond Unwin argued in the influential pamphlet "Nothing Gained by Overcrowding" that {{limiting the number}} <b>of</b> <b>dwellings</b> per land area would be the simplest and {{best way to avoid}} overcrowding of both buildings and people, a measure which became widespread. The same measure was used by Jane Jacobs when describing the minimum density required for a vital neighbourhood. This density measure is however highly problematic as it does not account for the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>dwellings,</b> mix <b>of</b> uses or <b>size</b> <b>of</b> households, factors that vary significantly in time and space. This implies that the number <b>of</b> <b>dwellings</b> per hectare alone is not useful for historic comparisons, urban versus suburban comparisons, or comparisons between different social contexts. Likewise, pedestrian flow surveys conducted in three urban areas from Melbourne show that dwelling density is not a reliable indicator of streetlife intensity. Furthermore, it is shown that its vagueness makes it particularly vulnerable to be linked to any type of qualitative conception of density, thus contributing to the ongoing confusion and misuse in the density debate. It is concluded that dwelling density on its own is not an adequate measure to describe urban environments, and instead multi-variable density models need to be used in both research and urban planning. Such a model is illustrated for a range of urban morphologies...|$|R

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of psychiatric and psychosomatic disorders in a 1 year birth cohort from northern Finland followed up until 19 years was examined {{on the basis}} of hospital records and national registers for subsidies for chronically sick children. Psychiatric disorders were found to occur with higher frequency in children of single parent families, especially those lacking a father during the child's whole life. Childhood enuresis was most frequent in the children who had experienced the divorce of their parents. Discriminant function analysis was used to establish the explanatory value of the family constellation for both psychiatric disorders and enuresis. The other significant explanatory variables for psychiatric disorders were school performance, place of residence and the child's height at 1 year of age, with poor school performance, high population density and short stature increasing the risk. The other significant variables increasing the risk of enuresis were psychiatric disorders, poor school performance, juvenile smoking and small <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>dwelling.</b> Disabled children had psychiatric disorders 9 times as frequently as non-disabled ones. single parent child psychiatric disorders enuresis disability school performance...|$|E

40|$|In Norway, {{the average}} house size has {{increased}} with 8. 4 m 2 between 2001 and 2013. During the same time, households {{have experienced a}} huge increase in disposable income, house prices have reach unprecedentedly high levels and the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> households have been reduced. This paper examines which forces determine the owner-occupiers’ demand for house size in Norway and why the average house size has increased between 2001 and 2013. Using household level data from Statistics Norway’s Survey of Living Conditions, I estimate an identical cross-sectional regression {{for each of the}} five survey years, regressing the number of square meter house size on income, price, household characteristics, geographical and structure related variables. Inserting average values for all explanatory variables, I find given the explanatory variables, higher predicted house size each survey year.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} space {{standards}} for social housing in Portugal and in São Paulo, and seeks explanations {{for differences in}} the socio-economic context of both territories. The Controlled Cost Housing (CCH) in Portugal and the housing built within the program My Home My Life (MHML) in São Paulo Municipality are studied. The number and type of rooms, the internal floor area <b>of</b> <b>dwellings,</b> the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> rooms, and the list and <b>size</b> <b>of</b> furniture and equipment are compared. Three research questions are addressed: Which program has more demanding space standards? Which social-economic conditions explain the differences in space standards? How different space standards influence the users' satisfaction? To answer these questions, the study compares socio-economic indicators, space standards and users' satisfaction of both territories. The study has shown that space standards set {{for the construction of}} social housing in CCH are more demanding than in MHML program. For instance, a CCH dwelling has almost two times the gross area <b>of</b> a MHML <b>dwelling</b> with the same number of rooms. The differences in space standards contribute to make the price of housing affordable to low income households in São Paulo Municipality. Although social houses are substantially smaller in São Paulo Municipality than in Portugal, the satisfaction level of dwellers with the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>dwellings</b> is higher in São Paulo. We conclude that different political options regarding how to provide housing to low income households directly influence the space standards set for dwellings and therefore their quality.

40|$|The global urban {{transition}} increasingly positions {{cities as}} important influencers in determining sustainability outcomes. Urban sustainability literature tends {{to focus on}} the built environment as a solution space for reducing energy and materials demand; however, equally important is the consumption characteristics of the people who occupy the city. While <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>dwelling</b> and motor vehicle ownership are partially influenced by urban form, they are also influenced by cultural and socio-economic characteristics. Dietary choices and purchases of consumable goods are almost entirely driven by the latter. Using international field data that document urban ways of living, I develop lifestyle archetypes coupled with ecological footprint analysis to develop consumption benchmarks in the domains of: food, buildings, consumables, transportation, and water that correspond to various levels of demand on nature’s services. I also explore the dimensions of transformation that would be needed in each of these domains for the per capita consumption patterns of urban dwellers to achieve ecological sustainability. The dimensions of transformation needed commensurate with ecological carrying capacity include: a 73 % reduction in household energy use, a 96 % reduction in motor vehicle ownership, a 78 % reduction in per capita vehicle kilometres travelled, and a 79 % reduction in air kilometres travelled...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to explore to what extent housing is a {{constraint}} for first births in Sweden 1972 - 2005. Three characteristics of housing are studied: housing type, tenure, and <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>dwelling.</b> The occurrence of childbearing is measured as the event of the birth itself and the time 16 months prior to the birth, i. e. initiation of conception. The main finding is that the size of the dwelling seems to be the housing factor with the strongest association with first-birth intensities. The effect of housing on childbearing seems to be stronger if measured to capture time of any first birth than if measured so as to coincide with the situation 16 months prior to the birth. The more strong effects on first-birth risks than on initiation of conceptions suggest that there is also an effect of childbearing plans on housing and residential moves. A stronger association between being established on the housing market and the propensity to have a first child is found for the 1974 cohort compared with the older cohorts. One can naturally speculate about the degree to which young adults opportunities to establish themselves on the housing market were influenced by the rapid and significant policy changes during the early 1990 s.

A research was performed with the aim to test the influ-ence of number of children in the family on marital partners ' life satisfaction. Five hundred and five marriage couples, i. e. 1010 participants were included in the study. The couples were a repre-sentative sample for the City of Zagreb and Zagreb metropolitan area on the variable husbands ' education. Two main effects (number of children and gender of the partner) and five cova-riates (marital partners ' age and salary, <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>dwelling</b> unit, eco-nomic stress/need for economizing) were defined.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the {{relative}} contribu-tion of factors that may influence residential energy conservation behavior. The theoretical framework for this study was Niemeyer's (1982) model of energy adjustment. Niemeyer's model was expanded to include actual energy conservation alteration actions performed. Energy conservation alteration actions were divided into two concep-tually different types of conservation alterations: energy curtail-ment and energy efficiency improvement. Lastly, physical <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dwelling</b> was added as an exogenous variable. A longitudinal survey conducted by the Western Regional Agricul-tural Experiment Station Committee (W- 159) in 1981 and 1983 provided the data for this analysis. The longitudinal Oregon data were analyzed for this study. Path analysis provided a method for con-necting quantitative estimates to causal effects within the model. To obtain the quantitative estimates, or path coefficients, multiple regressions were performed on weighted data, yielding the standar-dized regression coefficients, or beta weights. Frequency distributions were run on unweighted data in order to describe the respondents by sociodemographic and housing-related characteristics. The respondents most often lived in households of two persons which earned an income of $ 20, 000 through $ 24, 999. Respondents were characterized by a mean age of 47. 9 years and some college.
