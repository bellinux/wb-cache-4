5|$|Just {{under five}} {{seconds after the}} {{undercarriage}} left the ground, the plane's left wing scraped against the asphalt for 110 feet and the <b>stick</b> <b>shaker</b> activated. The crew received six stall warnings, before the jet began banking to the left, then to the right, {{and then to the}} left again, still only several meters above the ground. The aircraft struck two visual approach slope indicator posts, touched down again for approximately 100 feet, before lifting off again and striking an ILS beacon and a water pump house.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{tunnel and}} flight {{simulator}} {{tests were conducted}} to help to understand the trajectory of the aircraft after the engine detached and the left wing slats retracted. Those tests established that {{the damage to the}} wing's leading edge and retraction of the slats increased the stall speed of the left wing from 124 knots (143mph) to 159 knots (183mph). The DC-10 incorporates two warning devices that might have alerted the pilots to the impending stall: the slat disagreement warning light, which should have illuminated after the uncommanded retraction of the slats, and the <b>stick</b> <b>shaker</b> on the captain's control column, which activates close to the stall speed. Both of these warning devices were powered by an electric generator driven by the number one engine. Both systems became inoperative after the loss of that engine. The first officer's control column was not equipped with a stick shaker; the device was offered by McDonnell Douglas as an option for the first officer, but American Airlines chose not to have it installed on its DC-10 fleet. Stick shakers for both pilots became mandatory in response to this accident.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the engine's failure, several related systems failed. The number one hydraulic system, powered by the number one engine, failed but continued to operate via motor pumps that mechanically connected it to hydraulic system three. Hydraulic system three was also damaged and began leaking fluid but maintained pressure and operation up until impact. Hydraulic system two was undamaged. The number one electrical bus, whose generator {{was attached to the}} number one engine, failed, causing several electrical systems to go offline, most notably the captain's instruments, his <b>stick</b> <b>shaker,</b> and the slat disagreement sensors. While a switch in the overhead panel would have allowed the captain to restore power to his instruments, it was not used. It might have been possible for the flight engineer to reach the backup power switch (as part of an abnormal situation checklist – not as part of their take-off emergency procedure) in an effort to restore electrical power to the number one electrical bus. That would have worked only if electrical faults were no longer present in the number one electrical system. Furthermore, to reach the switch the flight engineer would have had to rotate his seat, release his safety belt, and stand up. Since the aircraft never got higher than 350 feet (110 m) above ground and was in the air for only 50 seconds between when the engine separated and when it crashed, there was not sufficient time to take such an action. In any event, the first officer was flying the airplane and his instruments continued to function normally. As the wings and engines were not visible from the cockpit, the crew likely had no idea that an engine had fallen off, only that one had failed.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the crash}} of American Airlines Flight 191 on May 25, 1979, the FAA issued an {{airworthiness}} directive making <b>stick</b> <b>shakers</b> mandatory for both sets of flight controls on DC-10, -10F, -30, -30F and -40 series aircraft.|$|R

25|$|A <b>stick</b> <b>shaker</b> is {{a device}} (available in some {{hydraulic}} aircraft) that {{is attached to}} the control column, which shakes the control column when the aircraft is about to stall. Also in some aircraft like the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 there is/was a back-up electrical power supply that the pilot can turn on to re-activate the <b>stick</b> <b>shaker</b> in case the hydraulic connection to the <b>stick</b> <b>shaker</b> is lost.|$|E
25|$|Suddenly the {{downdraft}} dissipated rapidly from 50 fps to 0 fps in four seconds, {{this cause}} a {{rapid increase in}} the angle of attack and, as the result, the <b>stick</b> <b>shaker</b> was activated for approximately two seconds. It appeared that the Captain desperately {{tried to get out}} from the TAWS pull up warning, as he maintained a nose up input. Thus, the plane stalled. He heard the <b>stick</b> <b>shaker</b> warning and, to get out of it, he later maintained a nose down input. This input continued for the next few seconds. However, proper and complete Boeing stall recovery action remained not carried out.|$|E
25|$|When {{investigators}} analysed the 727's voice recorder, {{the recording}} {{revealed that the}} pilots believed that the shaking of the <b>stick</b> <b>shaker</b> mechanism {{was caused by the}} airliner reaching the speed of sound, and not a warning that it was going into a stall.|$|E

5000|$|Another key Il-62 {{trademark}} is the [...] "saw tooth" [...] ("dog-tooth") on {{the wing}} leading edge. This prominent feature acts as an aerodynamic fence vortex generator (without which the wings would be almost vortex-free), and fixed leading edge droop/slat/flap. It ensures vice-free behaviour at high angles of attack and assists efficient long-range cruise. The saw tooth removes the need for hydraulic controls, <b>stick</b> <b>shakers,</b> and <b>stick</b> pushers. Interestingly, later models of the VC10 (for British United Airways and Ghana Airways) also adopted this feature, in their case closer to the wing tips.|$|R
50|$|Devices to {{warn the}} pilot when the aircraft's speed is {{decreasing}} close to the stall speed include stall warning horns (now standard on virtually all powered aircraft), <b>stick</b> <b>shakers,</b> and voice warnings. Most stalls {{are a result of}} the pilot allowing the airspeed to be too slow for the particular weight and configuration at the time. Stall speed is higher when ice or frost has attached to the wings and/or tail stabilizer. The more severe the icing, the higher the stall speed, not only because smooth airflow over the wings becomes increasingly more difficult, but also because of the added weight of the accumulated ice.|$|R
25|$|The Dutch Safety Board {{stated that}} the {{approach}} was not stabilized so the crew should have initiated a go around. The autopilot followed the glide slope while the autothrottle reduced thrust to idle due to a faulty radio altimeter showing an incorrect height. This caused the airspeed to drop and the pitch attitude to increase all unnoticed by the crew until the <b>stick</b> <b>shaker</b> activated. Prior to this, air traffic control caused the crew to intercept the glide slope from above and this obscured the erroneous autothrottle mode and increased the crew’s workload. The subsequent approach to stall recovery procedure was not executed properly, causing the aircraft to stall and crash.|$|E
500|$|The Learjet's cockpit voice {{recorder}} (CVR), which was recovered from the wreckage, contained an audio recording of the last 30 minutes of the flight (it was an older model which only recorded 30 minutes of data; the aircraft was not equipped with a flight data recorder). At 1710:41Z, the Learjet's engines can be heard winding down, indicating that the plane's fuel had been exhausted. In addition, sounds of the <b>stick</b> <b>shaker</b> and autopilot disconnect can be heard. [...] With the engines powered down, the autopilot would have attempted to maintain altitude, causing the plane's airspeed to drop until it approached stall speed, {{at which point the}} <b>stick</b> <b>shaker</b> would have automatically engaged to warn the pilot and the autopilot would have switched itself off.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} was descending through {{an altitude of}} [...] when the <b>stick</b> <b>shaker</b> activated and sounded for 3 seconds. After 1.5 seconds, the <b>stick</b> <b>shaker</b> sounded again. The aircraft continued to descend below the glide slope until it collided with a stand of trees in a high nose-up attitude. It came to rest upright in a commercial building, [...] short of the runway. After the impact, a fire started {{in or near the}} left engine, which spread {{to the rest of the}} aircraft. At least four of the passengers survived the crash, however, only three escaped before the {{aircraft was}} fully engulfed in flames.|$|E
50|$|The One-Eleven prototype, {{flown by}} test pilot Mike Lithgow, crashed on 22 October during stall testing, {{with the loss}} of all on board. The {{investigation}} led to the discovery of what became known as deep stall or superstall, a phenomenon caused by reduced airflow to the tailplane caused by the combined blanking effects of the wing and the aft-mounted engine nacelles at high angles of attack, which prevents recovery of normal (nose-down) flight. To prevent such stalls, BAC designed and added devices known as <b>stick</b> <b>shakers</b> and <b>stick</b> pushers to the One-Eleven's control system. It also redesigned the wing's leading edge to smooth airflow into the engines and over the tailplane. The specially modified aircraft used for testing this problem is now preserved at Brooklands Museum.|$|R

2500|$|It {{was found}} in flight testing that the stall {{characteristics}} were satisfactory but did not preclude stall penetrations {{to the point of}} secondary stall pitchup. [...] Rather than pursue a lengthy flight test research effort, and in view of the excellent primary stall behavior, it was decided to mechanically limit the extent of stall penetration with a <b>stick</b> <b>shaker</b> and stick pusher.|$|E
2500|$|The Boeing 727-251, {{registration}} N274US, departed New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport at 19:14 for a {{ferry flight}} to Buffalo. As the craft climbed past , the overspeed warning horn sounded, followed 10 seconds later by a <b>stick</b> <b>shaker</b> stall warning. The aircraft leveled at [...] until {{it started to}} descend {{out of control in}} a spin, reaching a vertical acceleration of +5g until it struck the ground in a slightly nose down and right wing-down attitude twelve minutes after take-off, at 19:26.|$|E

2500|$|The pitch rapidly {{changed from}} 2° nose up {{to a maximum}} 12° nose down for over 8 seconds. The plane {{remained}} in maximum nose down even when the plane was at close proximity with the ground. The [...] "Pull up" [...] ceased momentarily until it was activated again {{until the end of}} the recording. Islamabad Tower later cleared Flight 213 for landing. Flight 213 never acknowledged the call as the cockpit was in total chaos. Wind shear alarm later activated again once more. Captain Noor wants to get out from the [...] "Pull up" [...] warning, but exceeding the critical angle of attack. This caused both <b>stick</b> <b>shakers</b> to activate again. First Officer Javid shouted in extreme anxiety [...] "Stall warning let's get out!".

5000|$|The Il-62 and the British Vickers VC10 are {{the only}} {{commercial}} airliners with four engines fitted in twinned/paired nacelles by the sides of, and beneath, a [...] "T" [...] shaped empennage (T-tail), although the Lockheed JetStar business jet shares this configuration. In the case of Ilyushin, the configuration was dictated by TsAGI, the Soviet Union's aerospace agency, since Ilyushin's design bureau lacked the resources to engage in configuration studies. This layout allowed the wing design to be optimised for aerodynamic efficiency, without being cluttered by having to carry engines. In addition, the rear-mounted engines reduced engine noise in the cabin and allowed smaller vertical tail surfaces (as the yawing moment {{in the event of}} an engine failure was reduced compared to wing mounted engines). These advantages are balanced by a number of drawbacks. The wing structure, without wing mounted engines to relieve the wing bending moment, needed to be heavier, as did the rear fuselage structure, which had to carry the engines. In addition, aerodynamic wash (shadow) from the wing blankets the tail when the nose is pitched up (high angle of attack) leading the aircraft into a condition known as deep stall. This called for complex and (in the 1960s) unreliable automatic stall warning systems such as <b>stick</b> <b>shakers</b> and <b>stick</b> pushers to prevent the aircraft getting locked into the deep stall condition, although the Il-62's wing was designed to prevent deep stall.|$|R
2500|$|Seven {{seconds before}} impact, one pilot {{called for an}} {{increase}} in speed. The FDR showed the throttles were advanced from idle at that time.

2500|$|The {{aircraft}} model's {{potential to}} enter a deep stall was highlighted in the crash of Trident 1C G-ARPY on 3 June 1966 near Felthorpe in Norfolk during a test flight, {{with the loss of}} all four pilots on board. In this accident, the crew had deliberately switched off the <b>stick</b> <b>shaker</b> and stick pusher as required by the stall test schedule, and the probable cause was determined to be the crew's failure to take timely positive recovery action to counter an impending stall. The Confidential Human Factors Incident Reporting Programme (CHIRP), an experimental, voluntary, anonymous and informal system of reporting hazardous air events introduced within BEA in the late 1960s (and later adopted by the Civil Aviation Authority and NASA), brought to light two near-accidents, the [...] "Orly" [...] and [...] "Naples" [...] incidents: these involved flight crew error in the first case and suspicion of the Trident's control layout in the second.|$|E

25|$|Short pasta pieces {{fall on the}} shaker {{conveyor}} and powerful hot air is blown to them immediately after the extrusion. This reduces the moisture content by 5% and prevents the pieces from <b>sticking</b> and flattening. <b>Shaker</b> then carries the product through tiers with dry hot air and buckets collect the pasta and spread them on the upper tier of the multi-tier drying unit. This unit has four areas which periods of intense moisture extraction alternately followed by periods of rest occur at eight drying/stabilizing cycle in total.
