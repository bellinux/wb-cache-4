40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, {{we report}} a {{multimodal}} {{energy harvesting device}} that combines electromagnetic and piezoelectric energy harvesting mechanism. The device consists of piezoelectric crystals bonded to a cantilever beam. The tip of the cantilever beam has an attached permanent magnet which, oscillates within a <b>stationary</b> <b>coil</b> fixed {{to the top of}} the package. The permanent magnet serves two purpose (i) acts as a tip mass for the cantilever beam and lowers the resonance frequency, and (ii) acts as a core which oscillates between the inductive coils resulting in electric current generation through Faraday’s effect. Thus, this design combi-nes the energy harvesting from two different mechanisms, piezoelectric and electromagnetic, on the same platform. The prototype system was optimized using the finite element software, ANSYS, to find the resonance frequency and stress distribution. The power generated from the fabricated prototype was found to be 0. 25 W using the electromagnetic mechanism and 0. 25 mW using the piezoelectric mechanism at 35 g acceleration and 20 Hz frequency...|$|E

40|$|A {{method to}} {{characterize}} permanent and fast-pulsed iron-dominated magnets with small apertures is presented. The harmonic coil measurement technique is enhanced specifically for small-aperture magnets by (1) in situ calibration, for facing search-coil production inaccuracy, (2) rotating the magnet around its axis, for correcting systematic effects, and (3) measuring magnetic fluxes by <b>stationary</b> <b>coils</b> at different angular positions for measuring fast pulsed magnets. This method allows a quadrupole magnet for particle accelerators to be characterized completely, by assessing multipole field components, magnetic axis position, and field direction. In this paper, initially the metrological problems arising from testing small-aperture magnets are highlighted. Then, the basic {{ideas of the}} proposed method and {{the architecture of the}} corresponding measurement system are illustrated.

40|$|Knowledge of AC {{loss and}} dynamic {{magnetic}} field distortion {{in the main}} LHC dipoles is both important {{for the assessment of}} the accelerator performance and providing insight into the properties of assembled magnets. We measured the loss due to the current cycling in a few 1 -meter long model dipoles, 15 -meter long dipole prototypes and pre-series magnets. As expected the loss depends linearly on the rate of the current change. From the slope of this dependence, the contact resistance between the strands of the opposite layers of the cable, Rc, was evaluated for the inner winding of the dipole. We discuss the method to estimate the Rc value in the outer winding. The Rc value has been also derived independently from measurements of the magnetic field. For this, the ramp rate dependent component of the main field {{as well as of the}} harmonics has been measured. The main magnetic field measurements were performed using both <b>stationary</b> <b>coils</b> and Hall probes. Rotating coils were used to perform the harmonic measurements...|$|R
50|$|An {{automatic}} {{voltage control}} device controls the field current to keep output voltage constant. If the output voltage from the <b>stationary</b> armature <b>coils</b> drops {{due to an}} increase in demand, more current is fed into the rotating field coils through the voltage regulator (VR). This increases the magnetic field around the field coils which induces a greater voltage in the armature coils. Thus, the output voltage is brought back up to its original value.|$|R
40|$|Human {{footfall}} is {{an attractive}} source of energy for harvesting for low-power applications. However, the nature of footfall is poorly matched to electromagnetic generators. Footfall motion is characterised by high forces and low speeds, while electromagnetic generators are normally most efficient at relatively high speed. This article proposes a novel mechanism for converting the low-speed motion of footfall to a higher speed oscillating motion suitable for electromagnetic power generation. The conversion is achieved using a cantilever beam which is deflected by the footfall motion using a special ‘striker’ mechanism which then allows the cantilever to oscillate freely at a relatively high speed. An arrangement of permanent magnets attached to the cantilever causes an alternating magnetic field, and a <b>stationary</b> <b>coil</b> converts this to a usable voltage. This article describes the mechanism and provides a mathematical model of its behaviour which allows the system parameters to be optimised and its performance predicted. The performance of a prototype device is presented, and it is shown that this is capable of generating up to 60 mJ/step and that the conversion efficiency is up to 55 %...|$|E
40|$|Normally, low-frequency sound {{reproduction}} with small transducers is quite inefficient. This {{is shown by}} calculating the efficiency and voltage sensitivity for loudspeakers with high, medium, and, in particular, low force factors. For these low-force-factor loudspeakers a practically relevant and analytically tractable optimality criterion, involving the loudspeaker parameters, will be defined. Actual prototype bass drivers are assessed according to this criterion. Because the magnet can be considerably smaller than usual, the loudspeaker can be of the moving-magnet type with a <b>stationary</b> <b>coil.</b> These so-called low-Bl drivers have a high efficiency, however, only in a limited frequency region. To deal with that, nonlinear pro-cessing essentially compresses the bandwidth of a 20 – 120 -Hz bass signal down to a much more narrow span. This span is centered at the resonance of the low-Bl driver, where its efficiency is maximum. The signal processing preserves the temporal envelope modulations of the original bass signal. The compression is {{at the expense of}} a decreased sound quality and requires some additional electronics. This new, optimal design has a much higher power efficiency as well as a higher voltage sensitivity than current bass drivers, while the cabinet may be much smaller. ...|$|E
40|$|Using a new {{rotating}} SENSitivity Encoding (rotating-SENSE) algorithm, we {{have successfully}} {{demonstrated that the}} rotating radiofrequency coil array (RRFCA) was capable of achieving {{a significant reduction in}} scan time and a uniform image reconstruction for a homogeneous phantom at 7 Tesla. However, at 7 Tesla the in vivo sensitivity profiles (B) become distinct at various angular positions. Therefore, sensitivity maps at other angular positions cannot be obtained by numerically rotating the acquired ones. In this work, a novel sensitivity estimation method for the RRFCA was developed and validated with human brain imaging. This method employed a library database and registration techniques to estimate coil sensitivity at an arbitrary angular position. The estimated sensitivity maps were then compared to the acquired sensitivity maps. The results indicate that the proposed method is capable of accurately estimating both magnitude and phase of sensitivity at an arbitrary angular position, which enables us to employ the rotating-SENSE algorithm to accelerate acquisition and reconstruct image. Compared to a <b>stationary</b> <b>coil</b> array with the same number of coil elements, the RRFCA was able to reconstruct images with better quality at a high reduction factor. It is hoped that the proposed rotation-dependent sensitivity estimation algorithm and the acceleration ability of the RRFCA will be particularly useful for ultra high field MRI...|$|E

40|$|Many {{industrial}} applications require sheet to sheet or sheet to tube joints. The electromagnetic pulse technology is capable to produce {{these kinds of}} joints. In literature many examples of sheet to sheet solid state welding between similar and dissimilar metals are presented and analyzed in detail. However, {{the most of the}} presented welding applications, which are very focussed on the academic level, are simple specimens for example for tensile test. These specimens are usually very small in their dimensions and therewith capable to be welded with the help of stationary EMPT coils.
