40|$|This article uses a 2 ̆ 2 process {{characteristics}} and values 2 ̆ 2 approach {{to make the}} case against displacing arbitration finality with <b>substantive</b> judicial <b>review.</b> It responds to a trio of articles in a forthcoming Nevada Law Review symposium on whether and how the Federal Arbitration Act should be amended. In one article, Nevada Law Professor Jeffrey Stempel contends all arbitration awards should be subject to <b>substantive</b> judicial <b>review</b> similar to that of public trial courts. In a second article, Ohio State Professor Sarah Cole argues that <b>substantive</b> <b>review</b> should generally be permitted when the parties agree to it by contract, an issue now pending before the U. S. Supreme Court. In the third article, Kansas Professor Chris Drahozal contends <b>substantive</b> <b>review</b> of arbitration awards should be available for arbitral awards that are in manifest disregard of the law, thus generally codifying a widely held common law view. While all of the arguments they present are plausible and have their compelling points, they nonetheless miss the mark, and rather widely. In my view the displacement of finality with <b>substantive</b> judicial <b>review,</b> if codified, will greatly undermine virtually all of the central {{process characteristics}} and values of arbitration, its attractiveness as an alternative to public adjudication or negotiated settlement, and its utility as an aid to the judiciary as a forum for the expeditious resolution of disputes. Rather than requiring or permitting <b>substantive</b> judicial <b>review,</b> in my view the FAA should continue to hold the line with its limited grounds for judicial review, and make clear that parties cannot contract for <b>substantive</b> judicial <b>review</b> and that courts cannot engage in <b>substantive</b> <b>review</b> for awards that are in manifest disregard of the law. Further, Congress should reclaim its legacy and amend the FAA to make clear that arbitration under the Act must be based on an actual agreement to arbitrate in order to ameliorate some of the underlying concerns that may in part be animating the Stempel, Cole, and Drahozal proposals...|$|R

40|$|This article {{undertakes}} the heretofore untried task of documenting {{and explaining}} the antithetical case {{law of the}} American and UK Supreme Courts as to <b>substantive</b> <b>review</b> of administrative discretion {{over the past three}} decades. Despite sharing common legal origins and experiencing comparable aggrandisements of administrative power {{in the latter half of}} the 20 th century, the two courts are now sharply divided by the standard levels of intensity and modi operandi they adopt in exercising arbitrariness and irrationality review, respectively, for instance, the UK Supreme Court has affirmed many more administrative acts than its US counterpart under both Wednesbury and anxious scrutiny review. In determining the standard intensity of <b>substantive</b> <b>review</b> with little or no guidance from statutory or human rights norms, America's and Britain's apex courts have taken their cues from the framework principles of their respective polities, as well as from the relative adequacy and efficiency of other oversight mechanisms. © The Author 2014.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} Delaware 2 ̆ 7 s judicial {{treatment of}} deal protection measures, particularly termination fee provisions. The paper explores {{the tension between}} the economic function of these provisions in inducing bidders and potentially compensating them for opportunity and transaction costs in the event of deal termination vs. the ability of large termination fees to constrain and coerce shareholder choice by obligating the target to pay out the fee {{in the event of a}} shareholder no vote. In light of these issues, the paper explores the different standards of review that Delaware courts have and could potentially apply in ex post review of agreements containing termination fees. Ultimately, the paper argues that there are sufficient policy justifications to adopt more <b>substantive</b> <b>review</b> of these provisions. In light of several identifiable policy justifications, the paper suggests that a best interest standard that is used by bankruptcy courts in their more <b>substantive</b> <b>review</b> of termination fees in asset purchase agreements be adopted by the Delaware Courts analogously in the mergers and acquisitions context...|$|R

40|$|Should {{courts have}} the power to examine the legislature’s {{enactment}} process and strike down statutes enacted contrary to procedural lawmaking requirements? This idea remains highly controversial. While <b>substantive</b> judicial <b>review</b> is well-established and often taken for granted, many judges and scholars see judicial review of the legislative process as utterly objectionable. This Article challenges that prevalent position and establishes the case for judicial review of the legislative process. The Article contends that, ironically, some of the major arguments for <b>substantive</b> judicial <b>review</b> in constitutional theory, and even the arguments in Marbury v. Madison itself, are actually more persuasive when applied to judicial review of the legislative process. Furthermore, the Article claims that some of the arguments raised by leading critics of judicial review may actually be employed as arguments justifying judicial review of the lawmaking process. Therefore, countering the orthodoxy in American constitutional law and theory, the Article argues that judicial review of the enactment process is no less important and is, in fact, more justifiable than <b>substantive</b> judicial <b>review...</b>|$|R

40|$|Canadian {{jurisprudence}} {{recognizes that}} the right to liberty enshrined in section 7 of the Charter includes the right to make fundamental personal decisions free from state interference. In a similar vein, American jurisprudence recognizes that substantive due process under the Fifth Amendment includes certain unenumerated fundamental freedoms which can be exercised free from state interference. Both jurisdictions apply a form of strict scrutiny when fundamental freedoms are at stake, and this scrutiny requires the state to advance a narrowly tailored and compelling interest to override the exercise of a fundamental personal decision. This paper explores whether the development of <b>substantive</b> <b>review</b> under section 7 of the Charter, and the American Fifth Amendment, has led to a definable zone of self-sovereignty that {{is beyond the scope of}} the state’s criminal law power. It is argued that this zone of self-sovereignty has not clearly emerged in Canada with the exception of strong Charter protection for medical choices. The courts have not consistently and clearly defined the types of choices that can be characterized as a fundamental personal decision, and in cases in which the impugned conduct has been characterized as fundamental, the courts have often applied a highly deferential standard of review to the state’s justificatory claims in support of the need to criminalize the conduct in question. <b>Substantive</b> <b>review</b> under section 7 of the Charter can be a powerful tool for the review of public policy decisions to criminalize conduct, but the power is sparingly used and its potential remains underdeveloped and uncertain...|$|R
