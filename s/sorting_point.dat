5000|$|The Union Bay Post Office in the {{community}} of Union Bay, Comox Valley Regional District, British Columbia, Canada, was built in 1913 and is one of only two old wooden post offices left in Canada. The main floor of the building is still used by Canada Post to serve the Union Bay area. The post office also serves as a <b>sorting</b> <b>point</b> for the communities of Denman Island, Hornby Island, and Fanny Bay. The building was rescued by the local historical society in the 1990s when it was put up for sale. The society restored the building's interior to include original fittings and brass wicket. The post office is the jewel of what is called [...] "Heritage Row" [...] in Union Bay and was given heritage building status after the restoration.|$|E
40|$|Background: The BAG 6 complex {{resides in}} the cytosol and acts as a <b>sorting</b> <b>point</b> to target diverse {{hydrophobic}} protein substrates along their appropriate paths, including proteasomal degradation and ER membrane insertion. Composed of a trimeric complex of BAG 6, TRC 35 and UBL 4 A, the BAG 6 complex is closely associated with SGTA, a co-chaperone from which it can obtain hydrophobic substrates. Methodology and Principal Findings: SGTA consists of an N-terminal dimerisation domain (SGTA_NT), a central tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, and a glutamine rich region towards the C-terminus. Here we solve a solution structure of the SGTA dimerisation domain and use biophysical techniques to investigate its interaction with two different UBL domains from the BAG 6 complex. The SGTA_NTstructure is a dimer with a tight hydrophobic interface connecting two sets of four alpha helices. Using a combination of NMR chemical shift perturbation...|$|E
40|$|Point pattern sets {{arise in}} many {{different}} areas of physical, biological, and applied research, representing many random realizations of underlying pattern formation mechanisms. These pattern sets can be heterogeneous with respect to underlying spatial processes, {{which may not be}} visually distiguishable. This heterogeneity can be elucidated by looking at statistical measures of the patterns sets and using these measures to divide the pattern sets into distinct groups representing like spatial processes. We introduce here a numerical procedure for <b>sorting</b> <b>point</b> pattern sets into spatially homogenous groups using functional principal component analysis (FPCA) applied to the approximated Minkowski functionals of each pattern. We demonstrate that this procedure correctly sorts pattern sets into similar groups both when the patterns are drawn from similar processes and when the second-order characteristics of the pattern are identical. We highlight this routine for distinguishing the molecular patterning of fluorescently labeled cell membrane proteins, a subject of much interest in studies investigating complex spatial signaling patterns involved in the human immune response...|$|E

The SGTA_NT structure is a dimer with a tight hydrophobic interface connecting two sets of four alpha helices. Using a combination of NMR chemical shift perturbation, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and microscale thermophoresis (MST) experiments we have biochemically characterised the interactions of SGTA with components of the BAG 6 complex, the ubiquitin-like domain (UBL) containing proteins UBL 4 A and BAG 6. We demonstrate that the UBL domains from UBL 4 A and BAG 6 directly compete for binding to SGTA at the same site. Using a combination of structural and interaction data we have implemented the HADDOCK protein-protein interaction docking tool to generate models of the SGTA-UBL complexes. Significance: This atomic level information contributes {{to our understanding of}} the way in which hydrophobic proteins have their fate decided by the collaboration between SGTA and the BAG 6 complex...|$|E
30|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} ideas behind our algorithm CudaChain is first to <b>sort</b> all <b>points</b> according to their x coordinates and then compute the convex hull of the <b>sorted</b> <b>points</b> in the Divide-and-Conquer fashion.|$|R
30|$|Recently, Nakagawa et al. (2009) also {{developed}} a simple parallel algorithm for computing the upper hull of n <b>sorted</b> <b>points.</b> They first split the input <b>sorted</b> <b>points</b> into several subsets, then found the upper chain of each subset in parallel, and finally merged those upper chains using tangent edges to obtain the desired upper hull. They also employed a parallel algorithm to sort the planar input points before calculating the convex hulls.|$|R

40|$|Nondominated sorting is a {{combinatorial}} algorithm that <b>sorts</b> <b>points</b> in Euclidean space into layers {{according to}} a partial order. It was recently shown that nondominated <b>sorting</b> of random <b>points</b> has a Hamilton-Jacobi equation continuum limit. The original proof relies on a continuum variational problem. In this paper, we give a new proof using a direct verification argument that completely avoids the variational interpretation. We believe this proof is new in the homogenization literature, and may be generalized to apply to other stochastic homogenization problems {{for which there is}} no obvious underlying variational principle...|$|R
40|$|It {{was open}} {{for more than}} eight years to obtain an {{algorithm}} for computing the convex hull {{of a set of}} n <b>sorted</b> <b>points</b> in sub-logarithmic time on a reconfigurable mesh of size p n # p n. Our main contribution is to provide the first breakthrough: we propose an almost optimal algorithm running in O##log log n# 2 # time on a reconfigurable mesh of size p n # p n. With slight modifications this algorithm can be implemented to run in O##log log n# 2 # time on a reconfigurable mesh of size p n log log n # p n log log n. Clearly, the latter algorithm is work-optimal. We also show that any algorithm that computes the convex hull of a set of n <b>sorted</b> <b>points</b> on an n-processor reconfigurable mesh must take # log log n# time. Our result opens the door to efficient convex-hull-based algorithms on reconfigurable meshes...|$|R
