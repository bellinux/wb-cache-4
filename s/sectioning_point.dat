40|$|Identification {{of human}} {{skeletal}} remains {{is the most}} important task for a forensic anthropologist during forensic examinations. The need for methods to estimate sex from cranial fragments becomes apparent when only a part of skull is brought for identification. In the present study, the morphometric measurements taken on foramen magnum in a documented Indian collection were analyzed for sex differences using standard osteometric techniques. Fifty adult skulls of known sex were included in the study. Morphometric analysis of foramen magnum was conducted using digital vernier calipers. Six standard parameters were measured and analyzed by discriminant function analysis using SPSS 16. Males displayed larger mean values than females for all measured variables but only one of the variables (maximum bicondylar breadth) exhibited statistically significant differences between the sexes. The results demonstrated a low level of sexual dimorphism in the cranial base of this sample. Based on <b>sectioning</b> <b>point</b> derived by the discriminant function, a value higher than the <b>sectioning</b> <b>point</b> was deemed to be male and value below it deemed to be female. The accuracy of sex prediction based on discriminant function analysis ranged from 66 % to 70 %. In stepwise analysis, maximum bicondylar breadth was found to be more discriminating variable providing an accuracy of 66 %...|$|E
40|$|Optical {{microscopy}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used tools in biomedical researches. However, in the observation of thick biological samples, conventional optical microscopes suffer from background from out-of-focus structures. In this dissertation, excitation patterns are designed to improve optical sectioning capacity for imaging systems. First we improved the point scanning microscopy with excitation laser modulations. We used a mirror to reflect the incident laser to produce the interference in the focal region. It is found both the sectioning capacity and peak intensity of excitation and depletion beam in STED are improved and the signal to noise ratio is enhanced. We also developed a <b>sectioning</b> <b>point</b> scanning based phase contrast microscopy: Schlieren confocal microscopy. We found this method could obtain similar effect as the Differential interference microscopy, keeps the optical sectioning capacity of confocal, and is fully compatible with confocal. Furthermore, we applied excitation modulation to inhibit the background in light field microscopy. We combined light sheet illumination with microlens array coupled detection. It is demonstrated this method could significantly reduce the background in conventional light field microscopy and faster speed compared to light sheet. In conclusion, we succeed to apply spatial modulated excitation to point scanning and volume imaging systems, and improved their sectioning capacity. Our research could provide promising tools for in-vivo observations in large specimens. Ph. D...|$|E

40|$|The power {{distribution}} system is the final link to transfer the electrical energy to the individual customers. It is distributed in a complex technical grid but {{is associated with the}} majority of all outages occurring. Improving its reliability is an efficient way to reduce the effects of outages. A common way of improving the reliability is by designing loop structures containing two connected feeders separated by a <b>section</b> <b>point.</b> The location of the <b>section</b> <b>point</b> will decide how the system structure is connected and its level of reliability. By finding the optimal location, an improved reliability may be accomplished. This Master’s thesis has developed a method of finding optimized <b>section</b> <b>points</b> locations in a primary distribution system in order to improve its reliability. A case study has been conducted in a part of Mälarenergi Elnät’s distribution system with the objective of developing an algorithm in MATLAB able to generate the optimal <b>section</b> <b>points</b> in the area. An analytical technique together with a method called Failure Modes and Effect Analysis (FMEA) as preparatory step, was used to simulate the impact of outages in various components based on historical data and literature reviews. Quantifying the impact was made by calculating the System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) and the Expected Cost (ECOST) which represented the reliability from a customer- and a socio-economic perspective. Using an optimization routine based on a Greedy algorithm an improvement of the reliability was made possible. The result of the case study showed a possible improvement of 28 % on SAIDI and 41 % on ECOST if optimizing the location of <b>section</b> <b>points.</b> It also indicated that loop structures containing mostly industry-, trade- and service-sectors may improve ECOST considerably by having a relocated <b>section</b> <b>point.</b> The analysis concluded that based on the considerable improvement the case study showed, a distribution system could be highly benefitted by optimizing the location of <b>section</b> <b>points.</b> The created algorithm may provide a helpful tool well representative for such a process in a cost-effective way. Applying it into a full size system was considered being possible but it would first require some additional improvements of reliability inputs and to resolve some fundamental issues like rated current in lines and geographical distances to substations. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the lateral angle (LA) method—based on the measurement of the angle at which the internal acoustic canal opens up to the surface of the petrous bone—for sex determination in cremated skeletal remains of Italians. The sample consisted of 160 adult individuals of known age and sex who had recently died and were cremated in the crematorium of Ferrara (northern Italy). Several studies have demonstrated that the petrous portion of the temporal bone may be a valuable tool for sex diagnosis in unburned skeletal remains. Since petrous bones are usually preserved after cremation, this method could be of particular interest in the case of burned skeletal remains. The repeatability of intra- and inter-observer measurements was good. The results indicated that male and female lateral angles were significantly different but that the values did not differ among age-groups. There was no bilateral difference in LA. However, neither the 45 ° angle, proposed in earlier studies as the <b>sectioning</b> <b>point</b> for this variable from male and female data distributions, nor another angular value allowed satisfactory discrimination between the sexes in our sample. The influence of the “age” factor (about 82 % of females were of ≥ 75 years of age) on the results is critically discussed. The results of this study suggest that the LA method is not sufficiently reliable to assess the sex of elderly Italian individuals from their burned remains and thus should only be used in conjunction with other sexing techniques...|$|E
40|$|Background: In the {{analysis}} of mutilated remains encountered in case of war or in case of natural or unnatural calamities, the assessment of sex is foremost vital element when rendering identity profile of an individual. 2 D: 4 D digit ratio (2 D = index finger, 4 D = the ring finger) has been proposed as sexually dimorphic phenotypic trait. The paucity of literature {{on the issue of}} sexual dimorphism from digit ratio (2 D: 4 D) has prompted the author to conduct the research work. Aim: The purpose of the study is to determine sexual dimorphism from digit ratio (2 D: 4 D) in North Indian population. Materials and methods: 300 participants (141 males & 159 females) of North Indian population specifically from Kumaon region of Uttarakhand were recruited for the research study. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 60  years. Index finger length (2 D), ring finger length (4 D), 2 D: 4 D digit ratio (2 D/ 4 D) and <b>sectioning</b> <b>point</b> were estimated for both the right and left hands. SPSS statistical software was used for data interpretation. Results: Males have significantly longer index and ring finger length than females. Sex differences in the length of ring finger are larger than index finger. Again Males show significantly lower mean 2 D: 4 D digit ratio (0. 968) as compared to females (1. 014). With respect to handedness sex differences were found slightly higher for right hand than left hand. The study suggests that ratio below and equal to 0. 99 is suggestive of male sex for both hands, while a ratio of more than 0. 99 is suggestive female sex for both the hands. This cut-off accurately determines 93 % males and 90 % females for right hand and 87 % males and 84 % females for left hand. The study shows precisely very large sex effect with d values = − 1. 81 (right hand), thus 2 D: 4 D proves to be appropriate for sex determination in medicolegal investigations. Conclusion: This research study proves beneficial for identity authentication, for criminal investigation and a powerful forensic tool for medico – legal cases. This will help in the advancement of technology which will prove beneficial for the welfare of indigenous population of India. Also the data so collected can be useful as forensic anthropology population data...|$|E
