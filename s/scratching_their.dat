25|$|In November 1971 the Astros and Cincinnati Reds {{made one}} of the biggest {{blockbuster}} trades {{in the history of the}} sport, and helped create The Big Red Machine of the 1970s, with the Reds getting the better end of the deal. Houston sent second baseman Joe Morgan, infielder Denis Menke, pitcher Jack Billingham, outfielder César Gerónimo and prospect Ed Armbrister to Cincinnati for first baseman Lee May, second baseman Tommy Helms and infielder Jimmy Stewart. The trade left Astros fans and the baseball world <b>scratching</b> <b>their</b> heads as to why General Manager Spec Richardson would give up so much for so little. The Reds, on the other hand, would shore up many problems. They had an off year in 1971, but were the National League Pennant winner in 1972.|$|E
25|$|The {{trade deficit}} induced Buffett {{to enter the}} foreign {{currency}} market {{for the first time}} in 2002. He substantially reduced his stake in 2005 as changing interest rates increased the costs of holding currency contracts. Buffett remained bearish on the dollar, stating that he was looking to acquire companies with substantial foreign revenues. Buffett emphasized the non-productive aspect of a gold standard for the United States dollar in 1998 at Harvard: It gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or someplace. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. It has no utility. Anyone watching from Mars would be <b>scratching</b> <b>their</b> head. In 1977, about stocks, gold, farmland and inflation, he stated:Stocks are probably still the best of all the poor alternatives in an era of inflation – at least they are if you buy in at appropriate prices.|$|E

500|$|In 1998, {{the project}} {{was taken over by}} Franchise Pictures, a {{recently}} established company whose head, Elie Samaha, a former dry cleaning mogul turned nightclub owner, specialized in rescuing stars' pet projects. Franchise sought out stars whose projects were stalled at the major studios, bringing them aboard at reduced salaries. Samaha's approach made waves in Hollywood, earning him a reputation of being able to produce star vehicles more cheaply than the larger studios. His unorthodox deals raised eyebrows and the entertainment industry magazine Variety commented that they were [...] "often so complex and variable as to leave outsiders <b>scratching</b> <b>their</b> heads". As Samaha put it, [...] "I said, 'If John wants to make this movie, what does he want to get paid?' … Because I do not pay anybody what they make. That is not my business plan.'" [...] He learned of Battlefield Earth from Cassian Elwes, an agent at the theatrical agency William Morris, and approached Travolta. A deal was soon struck and financing was arranged; Travolta significantly reduced his normal fee of $20million, lowering the film's cost from the $100million that had previously been forecast, and costs were reduced further by using Canadian locations and facilities.|$|E

[...] Camille Mann of CBS News described the video as a [...] "avant-garde short film" [...] and noted that Gaga was [...] "pushing [...] boundaries." [...] Leah Collins of Dose compared Gaga's outfits with Christian Louboutin's designs. She further compared the set in the video to the cover artwork of Born This Way and called it a [...] "very fashionable recreation of Girl, Interrupted." [...] A writer of CNN commented, [...] "Lady Gaga is known for creating evocative mini-movies to provide the visuals for her singles, and 'Marry the Night' is no different." [...] Describing the video as [...] "rough" [...] and [...] "enigmatic", Liz Raftery of People further commened that it [...] "will certainly leave fans talking, if not <b>scratching</b> <b>their</b> heads."

[...] The trade left Astros fans and the baseball world <b>scratching</b> <b>their</b> heads as to why Astros General Manager Spec Richardson would give up so much for so little. [...] May and Helms were good talents but both had obvious weaknesses. [...] The Reds on the other hand would shore up many problems. They had an off-year in 1971, but were the National League Pennant winner in 1970. [...] They had plenty of power at the plate in Johnny Bench, Tony Pérez, and Lee May. The problem was, they were all right-handed batters and two of the three were first basemen. [...] Three sluggers batting in a row in the middle of the Reds lineup caused issues: First, it left them vulnerable to right-handed pitching; next, there was the problem of double play balls killing a rally; finally, Perez, a first baseman, was placed at third in order to have both May and Perez in the line-up. [...] Perez at third base caused a fielding weakness. [...] Now with Menke, a proven veteran that could play third, Perez could move to first, thus strengthening the left side of the field. [...] They also got the 6ft 4in Billigham, who was just entering his prime as a pitcher and would go on to help lead the Big Red Machine to back-to-back World Series in 1975 and 1976. [...] The deal turned out to be more than just Morgan for May, but Morgan turning out to be a great second baseman for the Astros, to a second baseman that would turn out to be an all-time great, just made the deal that much better for the Reds.|$|E
