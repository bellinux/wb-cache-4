40|$|This paper {{traces the}} <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> {{change in a}} Victorian {{cemetery}} in Christchurch, New Zealand. Its pattern of physical and attitudinal change over time is at once specifi c to this particular landscape and also echoed in many such burial landscapes across recently colonised settlements. The establishment of the cemetery fi rst required {{the removal of the}} indigenous vegetation—the taming of the wilderness. Once the cemetery had been closed for burial this ‘new ’ vegetation was left untended to fend for itself, and much of it grew out of control. The cemetery itself became a wilderness again, in European eyes. Eventually human control was again reasserted in the cemetery and the destructive potential of this imported nature was countered with its co-option in the evocation of different strands of idealised memory. Different aspects of Time itself are constantly referenced through this particular kind of landscape, from the geological, such as the deep time of Gondwana vegetation, to the mythical, such as the unreachable Edenic past, and the time beyond time when all will meet again in Paradise. Given the complex layers of historical and cultural meaning given to vegetation in the cemetery setting, this narrative explores some of the many infl uences and readings of Time within landscape change. referee...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY. Method {{of volume}} {{calculation}} fur stands within experimentalplots of sylvicultureStudies about forest production and more particularly the onesabout treatment methods {{should be based}} on the most accurate data. They should he qualitative and quantitative. Therefore, in orderto build the tariff tables necessary to volume estimation of stands,P. _AyRAL, Leader of the first Section of the Research Station,worked on a method of « stratified sample » whose applicationhas already given excellent results. The most important charactersare 1) Place of the trees in <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> (t, 2, 3); 2) Crown dev elopinent (: B, C); 3) Quality of the stem (D, T, r, etc [...] .). The stratified sample should include sample tree of each class ofsuch characters in every girth class, proportionally with the correspondingnumber of steins in the stand in order to avoid a systematicdistortion. Volume measurements of standing trees. necessaryto that system, are realized with the « Fcole Forestière » entrainminladder. One must then prepare, with this representative sample, a tarifftable, suitable to the stand after its thinning. The practical basis ofstudies was constitued of seven clear felled stands, most accuratelymeasured, tree by tree, after numeration. Instead of the graphical method, improper by many ways,A 1;Ani E has worked on a mathematical method, less subjective andallovfing calculation of the standard-error of volume estimation. Several mathematical laws (as V = f (c)) have ben tested(V = volume; c girth at b. h.).

A positive highly significant relationship was found between education and value <b>of</b> <b>vegetation.</b> It means that as education increases, the value <b>of</b> <b>vegetation,</b> such as trees decrease noise, provide shade, and protect from adverse environmental effects, increases.

(What units should be used in the analysis <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> was a widely disputed issue in early twentieth-century ecology.)

Second, he argued that Clements's associating particular vegetation types with particular areas underestimated the real diversity <b>of</b> <b>vegetation.</b> These objections together cast doubt, for Gleason, on the [...] "integrity of the association concept" [...] itself—on identifying any grouping of species as amounting to a nameable association, like [...] "oak-maple association," [...] as botanists and ecologists (including Gleason himself) normally had.|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} <b>of</b> aquatic <b>vegetation</b> on riverbed and embankments influences {{flow structure}} and consequently flow resistance, sediment transport, morphology, and ecology. These influences {{would lead to}} a hydraulic diversity, which is a key ingredient of physical habitat in streams. According to this fact, vegetation is commonly incorporated within stream restoration. Although significance <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> as an inseparable part of riverine systems is recognized, but yet it is still difficult to predict how the associated influences will respond to the introduction <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> and how advantages <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> can be optimized to a multitude of different processes. The primary impact <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> is slower flow velocity and thus, reduction in conveyance capacity. In addition to affecting the velocity profile over the full depth, vegetation affects turbulence intensity and diffusion. When mean kinetic energy converts to turbulent kinetic energy within the area planted with stems, turbulence intensity will begin to intensify. As a result of velocity and turbulence changes, aquatic vegetation can affect sediment movement and consequently bed form shapes could be stabilized with new patterns. Bed form characteristics (length, shape, structure, dimensions, stability, etc.) also depend on flow structure and can be divided into different categories according to the bed load materials. Locations and extension <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> in river channels is a fundamental factor should be considered besides the general impacts <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> in rivers. Isolated patches <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> are more common in practical applications rather than uniform vegetated channels in which the mean properties <b>of</b> the <b>vegetation</b> canopy are independent of the location. The present study considered the changes in bed forms through semi-circular patches <b>of</b> emergent <b>vegetation,</b> which are located at the banks of the channel. One of the goals is to find out how an island <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> modifies the morphology of rivers and mass transport. In particular, this research focuses on the physics of sediment transport and its effect on bed forms, and flow resistance {{in the presence of a}} patch <b>of</b> <b>vegetation,</b> by using experimental data and numerical modeling. Providing a physically based model for estimating the effects <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> on flow parameters, turbulence dispersion, and sediment transportation, the results of the present study contribute to extending the knowledge of morphology and mass transport in vegetated streams. ...|$|R
40|$|Grazing {{can alter}} the spatial {{heterogeneity}} <b>of</b> <b>vegetation,</b> influencing ecosystem processes and biodiversity. Our objective was to identify why grazing causes increases in the spatial heterogeneity <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> in some cases, but decreases in others. The immediate effect of grazing on heterogeneity depends on {{the interaction between the}} spatial pattern of grazing and the pre-existing spatial pattern <b>of</b> <b>vegetation.</b> Depending on the scale of observation and on the factors that determine animal distribution, grazing patterns may be stronger or weaker than vegetation patterns, or may mirror the spatial structure <b>of</b> <b>vegetation.</b> For each possible interaction between these patterns, we make a prediction about resulting changes in the spatial heterogeneity <b>of</b> <b>vegetation.</b> Case studies from the literature support our predictions, although ecosystems characterized by strong plant-soil interactions present important exceptions. While the processes by which grazing causes increases in heterogeneity are clear, how grazing leads to decreases in heterogeneity is less so. To explore how grazing can consistently dampen the fine-scale spatial patterns of competing plant species, we built a cell-based simulation model that features two competing plant species, different grazing patterns, and different sources <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> pattern. Only the simulations that included neighborhood interactions as a source <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> pattern produced results consistent with the predictions we derived from the literature review...|$|R

The analysis of some important characteristics of forest and open woodland vegetation is executed. It is shown that the peculiarities <b>of</b> woodland <b>vegetation</b> are not always reflected in the classification schemes. Contrasting approaches to the classification <b>of</b> woodland <b>vegetation</b> are considered. The main diversity of forest and woodland communities, micro-, meso - and macrocomplexes of alpine-taiga landscapes of the Bureya Mountains is revealed.

The ecological-phytocoenological classification of forest and woodland vegetation is developed. A concept of the life form <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> is used as a common basis for the classification <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> <b>of</b> different structural types.
