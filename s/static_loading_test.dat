40|$|Abstract. During <b>static</b> <b>load</b> <b>test,</b> {{the pile}} body {{is likely to}} have the problem of {{eccentric}} compression. Engineering practice suggests that the key of <b>static</b> <b>load</b> <b>test</b> lies in the avoidance of pile eccentric compression, the precise control of pile driving pressure, and accurate measurement of vertical deformation of the pile by dial indicator, especially for minor diameter plain concrete piles. Therefore, this paper made an improvement in the traditional <b>static</b> <b>load</b> <b>test</b> device, developed an installation technology of the pile head treatment device for vertical <b>static</b> <b>load</b> <b>test</b> of minor diameter rigid embankment pile regarding the special-shaped pile, and introduced the technology in terms of technical principles, scope of application, technical features, construction technique and operating points...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT It {{has been}} {{believed}} that the <b>static</b> <b>load</b> <b>test</b> is the most reliable method to obtain the load-settlement relation of a pile. Most <b>static</b> <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> are conducted using reaction piles as the reaction system. However, some researches {{point out that the}} influence of the reaction piles on the measured load-settlement relation may not be neglected, and that an analysis of the measured data is required to obtain a true load-settlement of the. From this point of view, the dynamic <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> or the rapid <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> may not be necessarily inferior to the <b>static</b> <b>load</b> <b>test,</b> considering cost and time performance of the dynamic <b>load</b> <b>test</b> as well. In this study, a new computer program for analysing the stress-wave propagation phenomena in pile driving was developed using a finite difference scheme and rational soil resistance models. Verification analyses of the proposed method are conducted first, and then the developed method is applied to the dynamic and <b>static</b> <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> on an end-bearing concrete pile...|$|R

The bored piles were penetrated into mostly old alluvial deposits and dilluvial deposits of very stiff marine clay with traces of shell debris. A bored pile was tested as part of this research program to verify the accuracy of the predicted pile capacities. The proposed static prediction capacity methods include Meyerhof, a, b and l methods.

40|$|Design of piled {{foundations}} for bridge structures for the realignment of US 95 in Sandpoint, Idaho, required a pre-design <b>static</b> <b>loading</b> <b>test</b> on an instrumented, 406 mm diameter closed-toe pipe pile driven to 45 m depth in soft, compressible soil. The soil {{conditions at the}} site consist of a 9 m thick sand layer on normally consolidated, compressible post-glacial alluvial deposits to depths estimated to exceed 200 m. Field explorations included soil borings and CPTU soundings advanced {{to a depth of}} 80 m. The clay at the site is brittle and strain-softening, requiring special attention and consideration in geotechnical design of structures in the area. Effective stress parameters back-calculated from the <b>static</b> <b>loading</b> <b>test</b> performed 48 days after driving correspond to beta-coefficients of about 0. 8 in the surficial 9 m thick sand layer and 0. 15 at the upper boundary of the clay layer below, reducing to 0. 07 in the clay layer at the pile toe, and a pile toe-bearing coefficient of 6. The beta-coefficients are low, which is probably due to pore pressures developing during the small shear movements during the test before the ultimate resistance of the clay was reached. The analyses {{of the results of the}} <b>static</b> <b>loading</b> <b>test</b> have included correction for residual load caused by fully mobilized negative skin friction down to 10 m depth and fully mobilized positive shaft resistance below 30 m depth with approximately no transfer of load between the pile and the clay from 10 m depth through 30 m depth...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{experimental}} study of cyclic load resistance of reinforced concrete (RC) beams retrofitted with composite laminates. Using a fracture mechanics approach, the fatigue resistance of the concrete-laminate bond is examined. Three-foot long retrofitted RC beams, scaled down versions of specimens used in antecedent research, were tested. Variables of the experimental program were surface preparation techniques and laminate types. Initial delaminations (in the concrete layer directly above the laminate) were artificially manufactured.
