50|$|In telecommunications, <b>subnetwork</b> <b>connection</b> {{protection}} (SNCP), {{is a type}} {{of protection}} mechanism associated with synchronous optical networks such as synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH).|$|E
50|$|<b>SubNetwork</b> <b>Connection</b> Protection is a per path protection. It {{follows the}} {{principle}} of Congruent Sending Selective Receive, i.e., Signal is sent on both paths but received only where the Signal Strength is best. When the working path for Signal receiving is cut, the receiver detects SD (Signal Degradation) and the receiver of the other path becomes active.|$|E
50|$|In {{unidirectional}} path-switched rings (UPSRs), two redundant (path-level) {{copies of}} protected traffic are sent {{in either direction}} around a ring. A selector at the egress node determines which copy has the highest quality, and uses that copy, thus coping if one copy deteriorates due to a broken fiber or other failure. UPSRs tend to sit nearer {{to the edge of}} a network, and as such are sometimes called collector rings. Because the same data is sent around the ring in both directions, the total capacity of a UPSR is equal to the line rate N of the OC-N ring. For example, in an OC-3 ring with 3 STS-1s used to transport 3 DS-3s from ingress node A to the egress node D, 100 percent of the ring bandwidth (N=3) would be consumed by nodes A and D. Any other nodes on the ring could only act as pass-through nodes. The SDH equivalent of UPSR is <b>subnetwork</b> <b>connection</b> protection (SNCP); SNCP does not impose a ring topology, but may also be used in mesh topologies.|$|E

40|$|The paper investigates if {{and how the}} {{topology}} of {{the peer}} assessment network can affect {{the performance of the}} Bayesian model adopted in Ope nAnswer. Performance is evaluated in terms of the comparison of predicted grades with actual teacher’s grades. The global network is built by interconnecting smaller subnetworks, one for each student, where intra subnetwork nodes represent student's characteristics, and peer assessment assignments make up inter <b>subnetwork</b> <b>connections</b> and determine evidence propagation. A possible subset of teacher graded answers is dynamically determined by suitable selec tion and stop rules. The research questions addressed are: RQ 1) “does the topology (diameter) of the network negatively influence the precision of predicted grades?”̀ in the affirmative case, RQ 2) “are we able to reduce the negative effects of high diameter networks through an appropriate choice of the subset of students to be corrected by the teacher?” We show that RQ 1) OpenAnswer is less effective on higher diameter topologies, RQ 2) this can be avoided if the subset of corrected students is chosen considering the network topology...|$|R
50|$|In a PRIME {{subnetwork}} two {{device types}} exist: Base nodes and Service nodes. Base nodes manage <b>subnetwork</b> resources and <b>connections.</b> All devices, {{which are not}} Base nodes are Service nodes. Service nodes register with Base nodes {{to become part of}} a subnetwork.|$|R
5000|$|In path-protected mesh networks, some {{connections}} can be unprotected; {{others can}} be protected against single or multiple failures in various ways. A connection can be protected against a single failure by defining a backup path, diverse from the primary path taken by the connection over the mesh network. The backup path and associated resources can be dedicated to the connection (Dedicated Backup Path Protection, aka dedicated (1+1) path protection, <b>Subnetwork</b> <b>Connection</b> Protection (SNCP) in SDH networks, or UPSR in SONET ring networks), or shared among multiple connections (Shared Backup Path Protection), typically ones whose primary paths {{are not likely to}} fail at the same time, thereby avoiding contention for the shared resources in case of a single link or node failure. A number of other protection schemes {{such as the use of}} pre-emptible paths, or only partially diverse backup paths, can be implemented. Finally, multiple diverse routes can be designed so that a connection has multiple recovery routes and can recover even after multiple failures (examples of mesh networks across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans [...] ).|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, times series {{interferometric}} {{synthetic aperture}} radar (InSAR) technique has been widely used in ground deformation monitoring, especially in urban areas where lots of stable point targets can be detected. However, in standard time series InSAR technique, affected by atmospheric correlation distance and the threshold of linear model coherence, the Delaunay triangulation for connecting point targets can be easily separated into many discontinuous subnetworks. Thus {{it is difficult to}} retrieve ground deformation in non-urban areas. In order to monitor ground deformation in large areas efficiently, a novel multi-layer <b>subnetwork</b> <b>connection</b> (MLSC) method is proposed for connecting all subnetworks. The advantage of the method is that it can quickly reduce the number of subnetworks with valid edges layer-by-layer. This method is compared with the existing complex network connecting mehod. The experimental results demonstrate that the data processing time of the proposed method is only 32. 56 % of the latter one...|$|E
40|$|Path {{computation}} algorithms {{are necessary}} for providing optimal utilization of available resources. Static path assignment does not satisfy the real-time data traffic requirement, thus leading to inefficient network resource utilization and compromised services for customers. Dynamic assignment of bandwidth {{requires the use of}} online algorithms which automatically compute the path to be taken to satisfy the given service request. Many researchers have addressed online path computation algorithms, but they consider each link having a number of slots of bandwidth. They do {{not take into account the}} multiplexing mechanism which causes restrictions on the allocation of bandwidth and the fact that higher order trails have to be established to support any bandwidth requirement. The novel feature of this work is the development of new path computation algorithm for service provisioning in SDH/SONET. The feature of this algorithm is that it takes into account the multiplexing structure, which imposes restrictions on the allocation of bandwidth and support the <b>Subnetwork</b> <b>Connection</b> Protection (SNCP) as defined in SDH/SONET...|$|E

These relations are standard results of probability theory, but seem to be rarely used in neuroscience. Some of their consequences for inferences between network and <b>subnetwork,</b> especially in <b>connection</b> with the maximum-entropy principle, are briefly discussed.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{neural computing}} models for information processing {{in terms of}} collections of subnetwork modules. Two approaches to generating such networks are studied. The first approach includes networks with functionally independent subnetworks, where each subnetwork is designed to have specific functions, communication, and adaptation characteristics. The second approach is based on algorithms that can actually generate network and <b>subnetwork</b> topologies, <b>connections,</b> and weights to satisfy specific constraints. Associated algorithms to attain these goals include evolutionary computation and selforganizing maps. We argue that this modular approach to neural computing is {{more in line with}} the neurophysiology of the vertebrate cerebral cortex, particularly with respect to sensation and perception. We also argue that this approach has the potential to aid in solutions to large-scale network computational problems—an identified weakness of simply defined artificial neural networks.

40|$|International {{audience}} Marketing campaigns need {{to spread}} their {{message to the}} largest target audience. Therefore, it's important to identify and recruit influential individuals: people capable of spreading the message through their social connections.  One of the main difficulties is that we usually don't have information about the network, except the one provided by the previously recruited individuals. The problem is modelled as follows: We want to determine a group of n individuals to be recruited {{in order to maximize}} the size of the covered set of nodes. The covered set consists on the recruited nodes and their neighbors. The topology of the whole network is unknown. The only information available is the covered <b>subnetwork</b> (the <b>connections</b> between covered nodes). Using this information, we need to recruit a new member at each step from the neighbors of the covered nodes. Under these assumptions, we analyse the performance of different myopic, greedy network covering algorithms and we compare their performances over a variety of social network models. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{human brain}} {{can be divided}} into {{multiple}} areas, each responsible for different aspects of behaviour. For a century we have been developing techniques to non-invasively map these areas and their associated functions, a discipline now known as neuroimaging. In recent years the field has undergone a paradigm shift to investigate how the brain communicates with itself; it is widely regarded that healthy brain function relies upon efficient connectivity between different functional areas, and the neuroimaging field has been revolutionised by our ability to estimate this connectivity. Studies into communication between spatially separate locations in the brain have revealed a series of robust functional networks which govern mental processes. However these studies have been based on the temporal averaging of minutes or even hours of data to give us a generalised ’snapshot’ of connectivity. Increasing evidence shows us that these connections are dynamic in space, time and frequency and so the next generation of of neuroimaging methods, which capture this 5 -dimensional connectivity will prove to be key tools in the investigation of brain networks and ultimately their breakdown in disease. In this thesis we introduce novel methods to capture non-stationarity using magnetoencephalography (MEG), an imaging modality which measures the changes in extracranial magnetic fields associated with neuronal current flow. MEG is a direct measurement of neural activity and has an excellent temporal resolution, which makes it attractive for non-invasively tracking dynamic functional connections. However there are many technical limitations which can confound assessment of functional connectivity which have to be addressed. In Chapters 2 and 3 we introduce the theory behind MEG; specifically how it is possible to measure the femtoTelsa changes in magnetic field generated by the brain and how to project these data to generate a 3 -dimensional picture of current in the brain. Chapter 4 reviews some of popular methods of assessing functional connectivity and how to control for the influence of artefactual functional connections erroneously produced during source projection. Chapter 5 introduces a pipeline to assess functional connections across time, space and frequency and in Chapter 6 we apply this pipeline to show that resting state networks, measured using ’static’ metrics are in fact comprised of a series of rapidly forming and dissolving <b>subnetwork</b> <b>connections.</b> Finally, Chapter 7 introduces a pipeline to track dynamic network behaviour simultaneously across the entire brain volume and shows that networks can be characterised by their temporal signatures of connectivity...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, pinning {{synchronization}} on complex {{networks of}} networks is investigated, {{where there are}} many subnetworks with the interactions among them. The <b>subnetworks</b> and their <b>connections</b> {{can be regarded as}} the nodes and interactions of the networks, respectively, which form the networks of networks. In this new setting, the aim is to design pinning controllers on the chosen nodes of each subnetwork so as to reach synchronization behavior. Some synchronization criteria are established for reaching pinning control on networks of networks. Furthermore, the pinning scheme is designed, which shows that the nodes with very low degrees and large degrees are good candidates for applying pinning controllers. Then, the attack and robustness of the pinning scheme are discussed. Finally, a simulation example is presented to verify the theoretical analysis in this paper...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{study the}} time {{evolution}} of a neural network model as it learns the three stages of a visual delayed-matching-to-sample (DMS) task: identification of the sample, retention during delay, and matching of sample and target, ignoring distractors. We introduce a neurobiologically plausible, uncommitted architecture, comprising an "executive" <b>subnetwork</b> gating <b>connections</b> to and from a "working" layer. The network learns DMS by reinforcement: reward-dependent synaptic plasticity generates task-dependent behaviour. During learning, working layer cells exhibit stimulus specialization and increased tuning of their firing. The emergence of top-down activity is observed, reproducing aspects of prefrontal cortex control on activity in the visual areas of inferior temporal cortex. We observe a lability of neural systems during learning, with a tendency to encode spurious associations. Executive areas are instrumental during learning to prevent such associations; they are also fundamental for the "mature" network to keep passing DMS. In the mature model, the working layer functions as a short-term memory. The mature system is remarkably robust against cell damage and its performance degrades gracefully as damage increases. The model underlines that executive systems, which regulate {{the flow of information}} between working memory and sensory areas, are required for passing tests such as DMS. At the behavioural level, the model makes testable predictions about the errors expected from subjects learning the DMS...|$|R

40|$|Users need {{to connect}} {{a pair of}} target nodes in the network. They share the fixed {{connection}} costs of the edge.

40|$|The brain’s {{remarkable}} {{capacity for}} language requires bidirectional interactions between functionally specialized brain regions. We used magnetoencephalography to investigate interregional interactions {{in the brain}} network for language while 102 participants were reading sentences.

Characterization of the functional topology of this network, using data-driven matrix factorization, which allowed for partitioning into a set of <b>subnetworks,</b> revealed directed <b>connections</b> at distinct frequencies of interaction.
