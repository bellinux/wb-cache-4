The development of electrical interfaces at the OIF began with SPI-3 in 2000, and the first differential interface was published in 2003. The seventh generation electrical interface, CEI-56G, defines five reaches of 56 Gb/s interfaces. The OIF began work on its eighth generation with its CEI-112G project.

5000|$|A Serializer/Deserializer (<b>SerDes</b> {{pronounced}} sir-deez) {{is a pair}} {{of functional}} blocks commonly used in high speed communications to compensate for limited input/output. These blocks convert data between serial data and parallel interfaces in each direction. The term [...] "SerDes" [...] generically refers to interfaces used in various technologies and applications. The primary use of a <b>SerDes</b> is to provide data transmission over a single/differential line in order to minimize the number of I/O pins and interconnects.|$|E

50|$|Another common {{coding scheme}} used with <b>SerDes</b> is 64b/66b encoding. This scheme {{statistically}} delivers DC-balance and transitions {{through the use}} of a scrambler. Framing is delivered through the deterministic transitions of the added framing bits.|$|E

50|$|The PCIe Physical Layer (PHY, PCIEPHY, PCI Express PHY, or PCIe PHY) {{specification}} {{is divided}} into two sub-layers, corresponding to electrical and logical specifications. The logical sublayer is sometimes further divided into a MAC sublayer and a PCS, although this division is not formally part of the PCIe specification. A specification published by Intel, the PHY Interface for PCI Express (PIPE), defines the MAC/PCS functional partitioning and the interface between these two sub-layers. The PIPE specification also identifies the physical media attachment (PMA) layer, which includes the serializer/deserializer (<b>SerDes)</b> and other analog circuitry; however, since <b>SerDes</b> implementations vary greatly among ASIC vendors, PIPE does not specify an interface between the PCS and PMA.|$|E
50|$|The typical raw {{bandwidth}} of {{a single}} 16-lane link with 10 Gbit/s signalling implies a total bandwidth of all 16 lanes of 40 GB/s (20 GB/s transmit and 20 GB/s receive); cubes with 4 and 8 links are planned, though the HMC 1.0 spec limits link speed to 10 Gbit/s in the 8-link case. Therefore, a 4-link cube can reach 240 GB/s memory bandwidth (120 GB/s each direction using 15 Gbit/s <b>SerDes),</b> while an 8-link cube can reach 320 GB/s bandwidth (160 GB/s each direction using 10 Gbit/s <b>SerDes).</b> Effective memory bandwidth utilization varies from 33% to 50% for smallest packets of 32 bytes; and from 45% to 85% for 128 byte packets.|$|E

Digital IP cores are sometimes offered in layout format, as well.|$|E
50|$|Some {{types of}} <b>SerDes</b> include encoding/decoding blocks. The {{purpose of this}} encoding/decoding is {{typically}} to place at least statistical bounds on the rate of signal transitions to allow for easier clock recovery in the receiver, to provide framing, and to provide DC balance.|$|E
50|$|A Multi-Gigabit Transceiver (MGT) is a <b>SerDes</b> {{capable of}} {{operating}} at serial bit rates above 1 Gigabit/second. MGTs are used increasingly for data communications {{because they can}} run over longer distances, use fewer wires, and thus have lower costs than parallel interfaces with equivalent data throughput.|$|E
50|$|The OIF also {{defined the}} <b>SerDes</b> Framer Interface (SFI) family of {{specifications}} {{in parallel with}} SPI.
