40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study what happens when the discrete-time <b>loop</b> <b>transfer</b> {{recovery}} (LTR) procedure is applied to plants with nonminimum phase zeros and with uniform time delay in all channels.

40|$|This Part {{focuses on}} the design of full order {{observer}} based controllers for the recovery of target <b>loop</b> <b>transfer</b> function or sensitivity and complimentary sensitivity functions when the given system is not necessarily left invertible and not necessarily of minimum phase. Four design tasks are considered. The first task concerns with arbitrarily specified target <b>loop</b> <b>transfer</b> functions and develops an observer design which has the capability to shape the inevitable recovery error according to the designer's needs whenever they are feasible. The second task considers observer design for exactly recoverable target <b>loop</b> <b>transfer</b> functions. The third task is similar to the second one in that it makes use of the specific properties of the target <b>loop</b> <b>transfer</b> function, but it considers observer design for asymptotically recoverable target <b>loop</b> <b>transfer</b> functions. The fourth task {{can be thought of as}} a generalization of the second and third tasks, and it considers observer design so that the achieved and target sensitivity and complimentary sensitivity functions match each other either exactly or asymptotically over a given subspace of the control space whenever it is possible.

The traditional linear quadratic Gaussian and <b>loop</b> <b>transfer</b> recovery method {{has been quite}} popular for aircraft control system design. In the proposed method we derive an optimal control law to minimize a generalized linear quadratic performance index to achieve better recovery quality in the LTR process and better some performance in time-domain responses and frequency-domain responses as well. The resulting controller can achieve a prescribed degree of stability {{even in the face}} of a non-minimum phase problem. Finally, the numerical simulation of an optimal lateral control system for an F- 16 aircraft demonstrates the proposed method can provide good robustness and performance properties in both time- and frequency-domain responses.

Based on an extension of the LQG/LTR method of proportional (P) observers, a systematic LTR design method is derived for the PI observer. Our recovery design method allows time recovery and frequency (normal) recovery to be done independently.
