5|$|Despite its {{chemical}} similarity, lithium typically {{does not}} occur together with sodium or potassium due to its smaller size. Due to its relatively low reactivity, {{it can be found}} in seawater in large amounts; it is estimated that seawater is approximately 0.14 to 0.25 parts per million (ppm) or 25 micromolar. Its diagonal relationship with magnesium often allows it to replace magnesium in ferromagnesium minerals, where its crustal concentration is about 18ppm, comparable to that of gallium and niobium. Commercially, the most important lithium mineral is <b>spodumene,</b> which occurs in large deposits worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Estimates for the Earth's crustal content {{range from}} 20 to 70 ppm by weight. In keeping with its name, lithium forms a minor part of igneous rocks, {{with the largest}} {{concentrations}} in granites. Granitic pegmatites also provide the greatest abundance of lithium-containing minerals, with <b>spodumene</b> and petalite being the most commercially viable sources. Another significant mineral of lithium is lepidolite. A newer source for lithium is hectorite clay, the only active development of which is through the Western Lithium Corporation in the United States. At 20mg lithium per kg of Earth's crust, lithium is the 25th most abundant element.|$|E
5|$|Arfwedson later {{showed that}} this same element {{was present in}} the {{minerals}} <b>spodumene</b> and lepidolite. In 1818, Christian Gmelin {{was the first to}} observe that lithium salts give a bright red color to flame. However, both Arfwedson and Gmelin tried and failed to isolate the pure element from its salts. It was not isolated until 1821, when William Thomas Brande obtained it by electrolysis of lithium oxide, a process that had previously been employed by the chemist Sir Humphry Davy to isolate the alkali metals potassium and sodium. Brande also described some pure salts of lithium, such as the chloride, and, estimating that lithia (lithium oxide) contained about 55% metal, estimated the atomic weight of lithium to be around 9.8 g/mol (modern value ~6.94 g/mol). In 1855, larger quantities of lithium were produced through the electrolysis of lithium chloride by Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen. The discovery of this procedure led to commercial production of lithium in 1923 by the German company Metallgesellschaft AG, which performed an electrolysis of a liquid mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.|$|E
