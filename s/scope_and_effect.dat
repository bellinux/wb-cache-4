Arguing that royal absolutism never developed in Gowa and that labor for infrastructural projects were recruited by landed nobles rather than the rudimentary bureaucracy, historian William Cummings contends that Gowa was not a state according to Ian Caldwell's six criteria. Cummings concedes that there were moves towards bureaucratization and rationalization of government, but concludes that these were of limited <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>effect</b> – even Gowa's incipient bureaucracy was organized according to patron-client ties – and did not fundamentally change the workings of Makassar society.

Ultimately, Cummings suggests that as social complexity does not evolve in a linear manner, there is little point to debating whether Gowa was a state or a chiefdom.|$|E

Article 74(2) barred courts from inquiring into the advice given by Council of Ministers to President.

In this regard Supreme Court held that although Article 74(2) bars judicial review {{so far as the}} advice given by the Ministers is concerned, it does not bar scrutiny of the material on the basis of which the advice is given.

50|$|A {{variety of}} {{specific}} physiological functions {{have been attributed}} to the σ1 receptor. Chief among these are modulation of Ca2+ release, modulation of cardiac myocyte contractility, and inhibition of voltage gated K+ channels. The reasons for these effects are not well understood, even though σ1 receptors have been linked circumstantially {{to a wide variety of}} signal transduction pathways. Links between σ1 receptors and G-proteins have been suggested such as σ1 receptor antagonists showing GTP-sensitive high affinity binding, there is also, however, some evidence against a G-protein coupled hypothesis. The σ1 receptor has been shown to appear in a complex with voltage gated K+ channels (Kv1.4 and Kv1.5), leading to the idea that σ1 receptors are auxiliary subunits. σ1 receptors apparently co-localize with IP3 receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum. Also, σ1 receptors have been shown to appear in galactoceramide enriched domains at the endoplasmic reticulum of mature oligodendrocytes. The wide <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>effect</b> of ligand binding on σ1 receptors has led some to believe that σ1 receptors are intracellular signal transduction amplifiers.|$|E
40|$|Summary: Today, it {{is known}} that the {{association}} law between Turkey and the Community grants rights to Turkish citizens which are legally enforceable before the national authorities and courts of the Member States, thanks to the decisions of the Court of Justice. Recent years have witnessed a number of cases before the Court regarding the standstill provisions in association law relating to workers {{on the one hand and}} freedom of establishment and to provide services on the other. One striking example is the Soysal case, which paved the way for certain Turkish nationals to travel to Germany without a visa. Therefore, there is a strong need to explore the exact boundaries of the abovementioned standstill clauses.

For example, large housing companies reduce real energy requirements of a building by 39. 96 % in the case of full refurbishment.

50|$|High {{judicial}} authorities found {{interpretation of the}} article {{to be a difficult}} task and expressed divergent views as to the <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>effect,</b> in particular, of the explanation in clause (1) and of clause (2). The majority view of the Supreme Court in the State of Bombay v. United Motors (India) Ltd., was that sub-clause (a) and the explanation in clause (1) prohibited the taxation of a sale involving inter-State elements by all States except the State in which the goods were delivered for the purpose of consumption therein, and furthermore, that clause (2) did not affect the power of that State to tax the inter-State sale even though Parliament had not made a law removing the ban imposed by that clause. This resulted in dealers resident in one State being subjected to the sales tax jurisdiction and procedure of several other States with which they had dealings in the normal course of their business. Two-and-a-half years later, the second part of this decision was reversed by the Supreme Court in the Bengal Immunity Company Ltd. v. State of Bihar, but here too the Court was not unanimous. In pursuance of clause (3) of the article, Parliament passed an Act in 1952 declaring a number of goods like foodstuff of various kinds, cloth, raw cotton, cattle feeds, iron and steel, coal, etc. to be essential {{to the life of the}} community. Since this declaration could not affect pre-existing State laws imposing sales tax on these goods, the result was a wide disparity from State to State, not only in the range of exempted goods, but also in the rates applicable to them.|$|E
50|$|In {{regard to}} the contention, that Article 74(2) bars the inquiry into advice was {{tendered}} by Council of Ministers to the President, the Supreme Court at length considered the <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>effect</b> of Article 74(2). Here {{it would be appropriate}} to mention that article 74(2) of the constitution provides that the court cannot inquire as to any, and if so what, advice was tendered by Council of Ministers to the President. In this regard Supreme Court held that although Article 74(2) bars judicial review so far as the advice given by the Ministers is concerned, it does not bar scrutiny of the material on the basis of which the advice is given. The material on the basis of which advice was tendered does not become part of the advice. The Courts are justified in probing as to whether there was any material on the basis of which the advice was given, and whether it was relevant for such advice and the President could have acted on it. Hence when the Courts undertake an inquiry into the existence of such material, the prohibition contained in Article 74(2) does not negate their right to know about the factual existence of any such material. This {{is not to say that}} the Union Government cannot raise the plea of privilege under Section 123 of the Evidence Act. As and when such privilege against disclosure is claimed, the Courts will examine such claim within the parameters of the said section on its merits. But Article 74(2) as such is no bar to the power of judicial review regarding the material on the basis of which the proclamation is issued.|$|E

App. p. 147. It is urged, however, that the carrier, in making the misdelivery, converted the flour and thus abandoned the contract. But the parties could not waive the terms of the contract under which the shipment was made pursuant to the Federal act; nor could the carrier by its conduct give the shipper the right to ignore these terms which were applicable to that conduct, and hold the carrier to a different responsibility from that fixed by the agreement made under the published tariffs and regulations.

40|$|Problem {{statement}} and research questionsIn Napoleonic legal practice, the <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> the <b>effects</b> {{of the concepts}} solidarity, indivisible liabilty and in solidum liability cause {{a great deal of}} confusion. Fundamentally, these concepts are equally effective for they serve the same purpose to create a liability for the whole debt. The research analyses the <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>effects</b> of those legal concepts as they exist and examines whether their functional equality could result in an identical legal regulation. The second problem relates to the distinctive scope of the partial liability and the liability for the whole debt. Napoleonic law presumes partial liability (art. 1202 CC), however in legal practice the exceptions are frequent, particularly in commercial law, contractual liability and tort law. The research surveys the rationale of the presumption of divisibility as well as the rationale of the exceptions and examines their respective <b>scope</b> for effectivity <b>and</b> fairness in practice. A third problem concerns the demarcation of the concept 'plurality of debtors'. A plurality of debtors originates from different persons who are liable for the same (extra) contractual performance. The answer to the question in which circumstances the same (extra) contractual performance exists, is rather difficult. In tort law, the question is related to the doctrine of complex causality, which is thoroughly examined in the thesis. The research also focuses on the question whether a plurality of debtors necessarily implies a plurality of obligations, rather than it may result from one single obligation. In conclusion, the research answers the general research question as to how contemporary law regulates the liability in case of a plurality of debtors and how it should regulate this liability to contribute to an effective and fair legal system. status: publishe...|$|R
