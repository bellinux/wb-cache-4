The rebate would have the greatest effect at low spending levels, where they could lower a household's effective rate to zero or below. The lowest {{effective tax rate}} under the FairTax could be negative due to the rebate for households with annual spending amounts below poverty level spending for a specified household size. At higher spending levels, the rebate has less impact, and a household's effective tax rate would approach 23% of total spending. A person spending at the poverty level would have an effective tax rate of 0%, whereas someone spending at four times the poverty level would have an effective tax rate of 17.2%. Buying or otherwise receiving items and services not subject to federal taxation (such as a used home or car) can contribute towards a lower effective tax rate.

50|$|The Tax Attractiveness Index {{represents}} {{a new approach}} to measuring the attractiveness of a country’s tax environment. To construct the Tax Attractiveness Index, values are added for all 20 tax factors per country, which have been identified as determining a country’s tax environment, and divide the sum by 20. Hence, the index {{represents a}}n equally-weighted sum of 20 tax factors. The Index has the purpose to indicate the attractiveness of a country’s tax environment and the opportunities of tax planning. As the components of the T.A.X. are measured on an annual basis, so is the index. To calculate the index, the variables need to be constrained to values ranging between zero and one. In cases quantification schemes had to be developed, the measurement of the respective tax factors has already been adjusted to this scale. A country’s tax environment is considered as more attractive, the more the value of the index approaches one. The T.A.X. is an alternative measurement to the <b>statutory</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rate,</b> and can be considered to be a more accurate proxy for a country’s tax environment. Many high tax countries, especially in Europe, offer extremely favorable tax conditions. Thus the T.A.X. reflects the tax attractiveness of a country better as single determinants.|$|E
50|$|Tax {{harmonization}} {{is generally}} {{understood as a}} process of adjusting tax systems of different jurisdictions in the pursuit of a common policy objective. Tax harmonization involves the removal of tax distortions affecting commodity and factor movements in order to bring about a more efficient allocation of resources within an integrated market. Tax harmonization may serve alternative goals, such as equity or stabilization. It also can be subsumed, along with public expenditure harmonization, under the broader concept of fiscal harmonization. Narrowly defined, tax harmonization guided by this policy goal implies — under simplifying assumptions about other policy instruments and economic structure — convergence toward a more uniform effective tax burden on commodities or on factors of production. Convergence may be attained through the alignment of one or several elements that enter the determination of effective tax rates: the <b>statutory</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> and tax base, and enforcement practices. Perhaps the most widely accepted argument for harmonization involves convergence in the definition of product value or income for tax purposes. Such tax base harmonization would contribute to transparency for economic decision-making and, thus, to improved efficiency in resource allocation. In particular, a common income tax base for multinational companies operating in different jurisdictions would be instrumental not only in enhancing efficiency, but also in preventing overlaps or gaps in tax claims by different countries. Tax harmonization {{is an important part of}} the fiscal integration process. Fiscal integration is the process by which a group of countries agree on taking measures that lead to a higher level of fiscal convergence, the ultimate goal being the formation of a fiscal union. Tax harmonization doesn’t automatically lead to the formation of a fiscal union, the second part involving much larger scale project that includes fiscal transfers, a fully harmonized legislation and maybe some supervising institutions, beside a long-run agreement. Starting from the definition given to the fiscal integration process, we can easily say that tax harmonization is the process by which a heterogeneous group of countries, federal states or even local governments agree on setting a minimum and maximum level of their tax rates, including also a higher degree of harmonization of tax legislation, in order to attract foreign investors and to encourage local development and investments.|$|E
