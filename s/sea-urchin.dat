All rights reservedTo make a first {{approach}} {{in the assessment of}} the sea urchin predators in the Azores, the diet of white seabream (Diplodus sargus) and ballan wrasse (Labrus bergylta), were studied by the analyses of their stomach contents. The white seabream is a diurnal omnivore, feeding on algae, <b>sea-urchins,</b> worms, gastropods and amphipods, while ballan wrasse fed mainly on echinoderms (<b>sea-urchins),</b> gastropods and decapods. Both species tended to feed on harder prey, such as echinoderms and gastropods, as they grew. Although both species feed upon similar resources, the diet overlap was low. This study shows that the white seabream and the ballan wrasse are important predators of <b>sea-urchins</b> in Azorean coastal habitats. Furthermore, larger fish account for most of the predation on <b>sea-urchins.</b> Thus, a reduction in the abundance and mean size of fishes, which is a typical consequence of fishing, may significantly decrease predation on <b>sea-urchins</b> and could thus facilitate their proliferation...|$|R

60|$|The {{progress}} of knowledge may, one day, {{enable us to}} deduce from such facts as these the maximum {{rate at which the}} chalk can have accumulated, and thus to arrive at the minimum duration of the chalk period. Suppose that the valve of the Crania upon which a coralline has fixed itself in the way just described, is so attached to the <b>sea-urchin</b> that no part of it is more than an inch above the face upon which the <b>sea-urchin</b> rests. Then, as the coralline could not have fixed itself, if the Crania had been covered up with chalk mud, and could not have lived had itself been so covered it follows, that an inch of chalk mud could not have accumulated within the time between the death and decay of the soft parts of the <b>sea-urchin</b> and the growth of the coralline to the full size which it has attained. If the decay of the soft parts of the sea-urchin; the attachment, growth to maturity, and decay of the Crania; and the subsequent attachment and growth of the coralline, took a year (which is a low estimate enough), the accumulation of the inch of chalk must have taken more than a year: and the deposit of a thousand feet of chalk must, consequently, have taken more than twelve thousand years.|$|E

60|$|Cases of {{this kind}} are admirably {{described}} by Sir Charles Lyell. He speaks of {{the frequency with which}} geologists find in the chalk a fossilized <b>sea-urchin,</b> to which is attached the lower valve of a Crania.

60|$|In certain genera of star-fishes these organs, {{instead of}} being fixed or borne on an {{immovable}} support, are placed on the summit of a flexible and muscular, though short, stem; {{and in this case}} they probably subserve some additional function besides defence. In the <b>sea-urchins</b> the steps can be followed by which a fixed spine becomes articulated to the shell, and is thus rendered movable. I wish I had space here to give a fuller abstract of Mr. Agassiz's interesting observations {{on the development of the}} pedicellariae. All possible gradations, as he adds, may likewise be found between the pedicellariae of the star-fishes and the hooks of the Ophiurians, another group of the Echinodermata; and again between the pedicellariae of <b>sea-urchins</b> and the anchors of the Holothuriae, also belonging to the same great class.|$|R
60|$|Don Erminio and Kit were {{fishing in}} the bay behind the Isleta, the hill of {{volcanic}} cinders that shelters the Port of Light. Off-shore, the Trade-breeze was fresh, but in the bay the rocks broke the sea. The captain had moored his barquillo to a reef and stood in a pool, with the warm, green water washing about his knees. His legs and arms were bare, as were Kit's, but they wore rawhide sandals, because where the <b>sea-urchin</b> grows one protects one's feet. Don Erminio carried a dripping bag, in which something moved, and a pole with a sharp hook like a salmon gaff. Kit carried a short fishing rod and was rather wet. Stepping out on a dry ledge, he looked about.|$|E
60|$|We {{will now}} turn {{for a short}} space to the lower {{divisions}} of the animal kingdom. The Echinodermata (star-fishes, sea-urchins, etc.) are furnished with remarkable organs, called pedicellariae, which consist, when well developed, of a tridactyle forceps--that is, of one formed of three serrated arms, neatly fitting together and placed on the summit of a flexible stem, moved by muscles. These forceps can seize firmly hold of any object; and Alexander Agassiz has seen an Echinus or <b>sea-urchin</b> rapidly passing particles of excrement from forceps to forceps down certain lines of its body, in order that its shell should not be fouled. But {{there is no doubt}} that besides removing dirt of all kinds, they subserve other functions; and one of these apparently is defence.|$|E
6000|$|From the {{principles}} {{laid down in}} the last sentence it would follow that if man were constructed upon a plan as {{different from that of}} any other animal as that of a <b>sea-urchin</b> is from that of a whale, it would be [...] "equally probable" [...] that he had been developed from some other animal as it is now, when we know that for every bone, muscle, tooth, and even pattern of tooth, in man, there is a corresponding bone, muscle, tooth, and pattern of tooth, in an ape. And this shows one of two things--either that the Quarterly Reviewer's notions of probability are peculiar to himself, or that he has such an overpowering faith in the truth of evolution that no extent of structural break between one animal and another is sufficient to destroy his conviction that evolution has taken place.|$|E

60|$|When {{you have}} got the whole well into shape, proceed to lay on the stains and spots with great care, quite {{as much as you}} gave to the forms. Very often, spots or bars of local colour do more to express form than even the light and shade, and they are always {{interesting}} as the means by which Nature carries light into her shadows, and shade into her lights, an art of which we shall have more to say hereafter, in speaking of composition. Fig. 5. is a rough sketch of a fossil <b>sea-urchin,</b> in which the projections of the shell are of black flint, coming through a chalky surface. These projections form dark spots in the light; and their sides, rising out of the shadow, form smaller whitish spots in the dark. You may take such scattered lights as these out with the penknife, provided you are just as careful to place them rightly, as if you got them by a more laborious process.|$|E
60|$|And, after all, {{even now}} man {{is by no}} means such a master of the kingdoms of life as he is apt to imagine.

Beyond that he may do a little with seine and dredge, murder a few million herrings a year as they come in to spawn, butcher his fellow air-breather, the whale, or haul now and then an unlucky king-crab or strange <b>sea-urchin</b> out of the deep water, in the name of science; but the life of the sea as a whole knows him not, plays out its slow drama of change and development unheeding him, and may in the end, in mere idle sport, throw up some new terrestrial denizens, some new competitor for space to live in and food to live upon, that will sweep him and all his little contrivances out of existence, as certainly and inevitably as he has swept away auk, bison, and dodo during the last two hundred years.|$|E
60|$|He {{finished}} his tea, {{and went out}} into the town. His hotel was not far from the cathedral square. Passing through the arcade, he came in sight of the famous cathedral with its numerous spines pricking into the afternoon air. He was not as impressed as he should have been. And yet there was something in the northern city--this big square with all the trams threading through, the little yellow Continental trams: and the spiny bulk of the great cathedral, like a grey-purple <b>sea-urchin</b> with many spines, on the one side, the ornamental grass-plots and flower beds on the other: the big shops going all along the further strands, all round: and the endless restless nervous drift of a north Italian crowd, so nervous, so twitchy; nervous and twitchy as the slipping past of the little yellow tram-cars; it all affected him with a sense of strangeness, nervousness, and approaching winter. It struck him the people were afraid of themselves: afraid of their own souls, and that which was in their own souls.|$|E
50|$|Invertebrates are {{animals that}} neither possess nor develop a {{vertebral}} column (commonly {{known as a}} backbone or spine), derived from the notochord.

6000|$|In {{the process}} of time, he {{acquired}} something of the Dutch language, that is to say, he learnt all its vocabulary of oaths and maledictions, with just words sufficient to string them together. [...] "Donder en blicksen!" [...] (thunder and lightning,) was the gentlest of his ejaculations. For years he kept about the Wild Goose, more {{like one of those}} familiar spirits, or household goblins, that we read of, than like a human being. He acknowledged allegiance to no one, but performed various domestic offices, when it suited his humor; waiting occasionally on the guests; grooming the horses, cutting wood, drawing water; and all this without being ordered. Lay any command on him, and the stubborn <b>sea-urchin</b> was sure to rebel. He was never so much at home, however, as when on the water, plying about in skiff or canoe, entirely alone, fishing, crabbing, or grabbing for oysters, and would bring home quantities for the larder of the Wild Goose, which he would throw down at the kitchen door, with a growl. No wind nor weather deterred him from launching forth on his favorite element: indeed, the wilder the weather, the more he seemed to enjoy it. If a storm was brewing, he was sure to put off from shore; and would be seen far out in the bay, his light skiff dancing like a feather on the waves, when sea and sky were all in a turmoil, and the stoutest ships were fain to lower their sails. Sometimes, on such occasions, he would be absent for days together. How he weathered the tempest, and how and where he subsisted, no one could divine, nor did any one venture to ask, for all had an almost superstitious awe of him. Some of the Communipaw oystermen declared that they had more than once seen him suddenly disappear, canoe and all, as if they plunged beneath the waves, and after a while come up again, in quite {{a different part of the}} bay; whence they concluded that he could live under water like that notable species of wild duck, commonly called the Hell-diver. All began to consider him in the light of a foul-weather bird, like the Mother Carey's Chicken, or Stormy Petrel; and whenever they saw him putting far out in his skiff, in cloudy weather, made up their minds for a storm.|$|E
6000|$|... 47. Now I do {{not want}} you to copy my sketch in Fig. 5, but to copy the stone before you {{in the way that}} my sketch is done. To which end, first measure the extreme length of the stone with compasses, and mark that length on your paper; then, between the points marked, leave {{something}} like the form of the stone in light, scrawling the paper all over, round it; b, in Fig. 5, is a beginning of this kind. Rather leave too much room for the high light, than too little; and then more cautiously fill in the shade, shutting the light gradually up, and putting in the dark slowly on the dark side. You need not plague yourself about accuracy of shape, because, till you have practiced a great deal, it is impossible for you to draw the shape of the stone quite truly, and you must gradually gain correctness by means of these various exercises: what you have mainly to do at present is, to get the stone to look solid and round, not much minding what its exact contour is--only draw it as nearly right as you can without vexation; and you will get it more right by thus feeling your way to it in shade, than if you tried to draw the outline at first. For you can see no outline; what you see is only a certain space of gradated shade, with other such spaces about it; and those pieces of shade you are to imitate as nearly as you can, by scrawling the paper over till you get them to the right shape, with the same gradations which they have in Nature. And this is really more likely to be done well, if you have to fight your way through a little confusion in the sketch, than if you have an accurately traced outline. For instance, having sketched the fossil <b>sea-urchin</b> at a, in Fig. 5, whose form, though irregular, required more care in following than that of a common stone, I was going to draw it also under another effect; reflected light bringing its dark side out from the background: but when I had laid on the first few touches I thought {{it would be better to}} stop, and let you see how I had begun it, at b. In which beginning it will be observed that nothing is so determined but that I can more or less modify, and add to or diminish the contour as I work on, the lines which suggest the outline being blended with the others if I {{do not want}} them; and the having to fill up the vacancies and conquer the irregularities of such a sketch will probably secure a higher completion at last, than if half an hour had been spent in getting a true outline before beginning.|$|E
