5|$|Porter {{edited the}} Constellation, a {{newspaper}} in New York City that published humorous stories. Porter became interested in sports, and concentrated on the emerging sports journalism field. In December 1831, Porter published {{the first issue of}} a new newspaper devoted to covering sports and other recreational activities, which he called The <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Times. Porter imitated Bell's Life in London, a contemporary English publication covering the same subjects. The first attempt at <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Times failed quickly, and Porter sold the magazine to C. J. B. Fisher, who merged it into Fisher's publication of the Traveller, and the Spirit was combined with the Traveller as the Traveller and <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Times. During the brief period that Porter operated the Spirit, he employed Horace Greeley as a typesetter. When Porter sold the Spirit, he then went to work at the New-Yorker, which was edited at the time by Horace Greeley. In January 1835 Porter purchased the Traveller and <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Times and renamed the newspaper back to <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Times, returning to editing it. This version of the Spirit managed to survive, although with some initial financial difficulties. Porter focused on selling his paper in the south and west of the United States, and emphasized subjects of use to his readers, such as cattle breeding, farm methods, books of interest, as well as sports. The newspaper was published weekly.|$|E
5|$|When Wilkes {{returned}} from California to New York City, {{he began to}} work for William T. Porter at Porter's newspaper The <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Times. Porter sold the paper in 1856 to Wilkes, who retained Porter on the newspaper's staff until Porter's death in 1858. Wilkes, however, renamed the paper to Porter's <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Times, a title it retained until 1859. In September 1859, Abraham C. Dayton, who had previously worked for the Spirit, left the paper and because he had purchased {{a share of the}} paper at one point from Porter, began publishing a paper he called Porter's <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Times. Dayton got a court order preventing Wilkes from using Porter's name, so Wilkes changed the name of his paper to Wilkes' <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Times, while Dayton continued to publish Porter's <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Times. Dayton was only able to publish until August 1861, however, as Wilkes drove the other paper out of business. Wilkes owned the surviving paper until his death in 1885.|$|E

50|$|A major plot {{point in}} the trilogies (first {{described}} in Helliconia Spring, and explained in detail in Helliconia Winter) is <b>the</b> changing character <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pauk experience for the Helliconian humans. <b>The</b> <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead are extremely emotional, and are naturally bitter and angry towards <b>the</b> visiting <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> living. After the Helliconian civilisations become <b>of</b> interest to <b>the</b> Earth humans, a planet-wide effort on Earth is made to psychically transmit empathic energy from Gaia to the Original Beholder, {{in an effort to}} lend their support to the humans on Helliconia. This effort has a positive effect on <b>the</b> <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead Helliconian humans, making them uniformly happy and nurturing to <b>the</b> <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> living.|$|R

50|$|Many {{years before}} the events in Beyond Oasis, the warrior Ordan gives his young pupil Leon the Golden Armlet, {{so that he can}} become <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> King <b>of</b> Oasis. This can only be {{achieved}} by obtaining <b>the</b> loyalty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> six elemental <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land, which are called Dytto (<b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> water), Efreet (<b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> fire), Bawu (<b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> earth), Brass (<b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> sound), Shade (<b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> darkness), and Airl (<b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> air).

5|$|According to Sorkin, {{the episode}} benefited greatly from input by two former White House employees. The scene where Donna stays {{up all night}} sorting through {{documents}} in cartons {{was the idea of}} Eli Attie, Al Gore's chief speechwriter. Meanwhile Gene Sperling, Bill Clinton's chief economic adviser, came up with the sub-plot involving the estate tax. Sorkin, however, had certain misgivings about the estate tax story's appeal, considering the prevalent bipartisan <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time, {{in the aftermath of the}} 9/11 attacks.|$|E
5|$|After the Cuban Revolution of 1959, a {{representative}} of the Fidel Castro government asked Árbenz to come to Cuba, to which he readily agreed, sensing an opportunity to live with fewer restrictions on himself. He flew to Havana in July 1960, and, caught up in the <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recent revolution, began to participate in public events. His presence so close to Guatemala once again increased the negative coverage he received in the Guatemalan press. He was offered the leadership of some revolutionary movements in Guatemala but refused, as he was pessimistic about the outcome.|$|E

5|$|Doom {{was well}} {{received}} by critics and players. The single-player campaign, graphics, and gameplay received considerable acclaim and praise, with reviewers crediting {{the game for}} recapturing the <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> classic Doom games and first-person shooters of the 1990s, whereas the multiplayer mode drew the most significant criticism. It was the second best-selling video game in North America and the UK {{a few weeks after}} its release, and sold over 500,000 copies for PCs within the same period.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s, a {{combination}} of financial pressure and low enrollment forced the Danish-language based Danebod Folk School to close down. The building was re-opened in 1946 and has since 1947 offered annual summer family camps. Danebod Folk Camp offers Danish cuisine, Danish folk dance, Danish art, and other Danish cultural experiences. In the <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Danish Folk School system, camp attendees sing Danish songs, dance traditional Danish folk dance, work on crafts and have Danish-based lectures throughout the day.|$|E

5|$|During the Enlightenment, {{intellectual}} {{sympathy for}} astrology fell away, {{leaving only a}} popular following supported by cheap almanacs. One English almanac compiler, Richard Saunders, followed the <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> age by printing a derisive Discourse on the Invalidity of Astrology, while in France Pierre Bayle's Dictionnaire of 1697 stated that the subject was puerile. The Anglo-Irish satirist Jonathan Swift ridiculed the Whig political astrologer John Partridge.|$|E
5|$|Fewer {{children}} are now employed in hazardous environments, but their employment in non-hazardous jobs, prevalently as domestic help, violates the <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> constitution {{in the eyes}} of many critics and human rights advocates.

5|$|In 1495 the Italian Renaissance {{arrived in}} France, {{imported}} by King Charles VIII after his invasion of Italy. A factor that promoted {{the spread of}} secularism was {{the inability of the}} Church to offer assistance against the Black Death. Francis I imported Italian art and artists, including Leonardo da Vinci, and built ornate palaces at great expense. Writers such as François Rabelais, Pierre de Ronsard, Joachim du Bellay and Michel de Montaigne, painters such as Jean Clouet, and musicians such as Jean Mouton also borrowed from the <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|In 1850 {{he gave up}} {{his career}} in science and entered the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg. He studied in academy under the {{historical}} painter Pyotr Basin until 1857.

According to Ge himself, during that period he was strongly influenced by Karl Briullov.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, {{after two}} centuries, the Holy See re-assessed the issue.

The general principle of sometimes admitting native traditions even into the liturgy of the church, provided that such traditions harmonize with the true and authentic <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liturgy, was proclaimed by the Second Vatican Council (1962–65).|$|E

The name has been adopted by sports franchises, including the NFL's Jacksonville Jaguars and the Mexican soccer club Chiapas F.C. The crest of Argentina's national federation in rugby union features a jaguar; however, because of a journalist error, the country's national team is nicknamed Los Pumas. In the <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ancient Mayan culture, the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City adopted a red jaguar as the first official Olympic mascot.|$|E
