5|$|Cumulative U.S. {{military}} expenditures {{throughout the entire}} Cold War amounted to an estimated $8trillion. Further nearly 100,000 Americans {{lost their lives in}} the Korean and Vietnam Wars. Although Soviet casualties are difficult to estimate, as a share of their gross national product the financial cost for the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>was</b> much higher than that incurred by the United States.|$|E
5|$|However the {{competition}} was reopened in 1990 {{to allow for a}} reconsideration of a European fighter, the Mirage 2000-5. In June 1991 the choice of the Hornet was reconfirmed, and the political struggle to have its purchase approved by referendum began. In the meantime, the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>was</b> dissolved, and with its dissolution the Cold War ended.|$|E

5|$|After September 1939, desperate {{efforts were}} made to improve the situation, but with very little result. Germany, for obvious reasons, delayed its deliveries; France was {{hesitant}} to equip an army that would not unequivocally take its side. The one abundant source of readily available weaponry, the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union,</b> <b>was</b> inaccessible because the Dutch, contrary to most other nations, did not recognise the communist regime. An attempt in 1940 to procure Soviet armour captured by Finland failed.|$|E
5|$|After the {{communist}} revolution in Afghanistan in 1978, authoritarian actions forced upon the populace by the Communist regime {{led to the}} Afghan civil war, with the mujahideen leading the popular backlash against the regime. The <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>was</b> worried that they were losing their influence in Central Asia, so after a KGB report claimed that Afghanistan could be taken {{in a matter of}} weeks, Brezhnev and several top party officials agreed to a full intervention in Afghanistan.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} Lend Lease agreement, between October 1941 and March 1946 the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>was</b> {{supplied}} with 1,000 PIATs and 100,000 rounds of ammunition. The PIAT was also utilized by resistance groups in Occupied Europe. During the Warsaw Uprising, {{it was one of}} many weapons that Polish Underground resistance fighters used against German forces. And in occupied France, the French resistance used the PIAT in the absence of mortars or artillery.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, a {{vigorous}} movement grew up protesting against abuse of psychiatry in the USSR. Political abuse of psychiatry in the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>was</b> denounced {{in the course}} of the Congresses of the World Psychiatric Association in Mexico City (1971), Hawaii (1977), Vienna (1983) and Athens (1989). The campaign to terminate political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR was a key episode in the Cold War, inflicting irretrievable damage on the prestige of medicine in the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|On March 11, 1985, {{power in}} the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>was</b> assumed by Mikhail Gorbachev. The {{worsening}} economic situation in the entire Eastern Bloc, including the Soviet Union, together with other factors, forced Gorbachev {{to carry out a}} number of reforms, not only in the field of economics (uskoreniye) but in the political and social realms (glasnost and perestroika). Gorbachev's policies soon caused a corresponding shift in the policies of Soviet satellites, including the People's Republic of Poland.|$|E

5|$|Piłsudski's Promethean program, {{designed}} {{to weaken the}} Russian Empire and its successor state, the Soviet Union, by supporting nationalist independence movements of major non-Russian peoples dwelling in Russia and the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union,</b> <b>was</b> coordinated from 1927 to the 1939 outbreak of World War II in Europe by the military intelligence officer, Edmund Charaszkiewicz. In the Interbellum, the Prometheist movement yielded few tangible results.|$|E
5|$|The {{stabilization}} policy brought about after Khrushchev's removal established a ruling gerontocracy, and political corruption became a normal phenomenon. Brezhnev, however, never initiated any large-scale anti-corruption campaigns. Due {{to the large}} military buildup of the 1960s, the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>was</b> able to consolidate itself as a superpower during Brezhnev's rule. The era ended with Brezhnev's death on 10 November 1982.|$|E

A trade {{agreement}} between West Germany and the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>was</b> reached, and Hartmann was released along with 16,000 German military personnel {{as one of the}} last Heimkehrer. After spending 10 {{and a half years in}} Soviet POW camps, he was among the last batch of prisoners to be turned over. Returning to West Germany, he was reunited with his wife Ursula, to whom he had written every day of the war.|$|E
5|$|In April 1991 Vladimir Bukovsky visited Moscow for {{the first}} time since his {{deportation}} fifteen years before. In the run-up to the 1991 presidential election Boris Yeltsin's campaign team included Bukovsky on their list of potential vice-presidential running-mates. In the end, army officer Alexander Rutskoy, a veteran of the 1979–1989 war in Afghanistan and Hero of the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>was</b> selected. On 5 December 1991 both of Bukovsky's Soviet-era convictions were annulled by a decree of the RSFSR Supreme Court. The following year President Yeltsin formally restored Bukovsky's Russian citizenship: he had never been deprived of his Soviet citizenship, despite deportation from the country.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} groups that lacked {{representation in the}} Underground State included the communist (Polish Workers Party (PPR) and its military arm, the Gwardia Ludowa), and the far right (Group Szaniec and its military arm, the Military Organization Lizard Union). Both the extreme left (the communists) and the extreme right (the nationalists) saw themselves {{in opposition to the}} Underground State. Only the PPR, however, opposed to Polish independence and supporting full inclusion of Poland in the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union,</b> <b>was</b> seen as completely outside the framework of the State; the other groups were seen as a legitimate opposition. In 1944 PPR would become part of the PKWN Soviet puppet government.|$|E
