5|$|The Comet was {{powered by}} {{two pairs of}} {{turbojet}} engines buried in the wings close to the fuselage. Chief designer Bishop chose the Comet's embedded-engine configuration because it avoided the drag of podded engines and allowed for a smaller fin and rudder, since the hazards of asymmetric thrust were reduced. The engines were outfitted with baffles to reduce noise emissions, and extensive <b>soundproofing</b> was also implemented to improve passenger conditions.|$|E
5|$|While {{over the}} South China Sea on October12, a United States Air Force WC-130H Hercules {{reconnaissance}} aircraft (call sign Swan 38), {{with a crew}} of six, went missing while collecting data on the cyclone. The plane took off from Clark Air Base during the night on October12 and made its final contact six hours later roughly 95km (60mi) north of Manila. A rescue team of five Air Force aircraft and the USS White Plains was dispatched to look for survivors. Search and rescue missions for the crew only found pieces of debris, such as an aircraft survival radio, <b>soundproofing</b> material, and orange cushion-like material. All six crewmen were never found and are presumed dead. Following the incident, the 53d Weather Reconnaissance Squadron established the Swan 38 Memorial Scholarship for outstanding students in the 403d Wing.|$|E
5|$|Constructed to Cubitt's own designs, the new mansion had a {{very similar}} style to that of Osborne House. Cubitt's {{attention}} to detail was such that he even manufactured his own bricks at a brickworks he {{set up for the}} purpose, using lime extracted from the chalk quarries on {{the eastern edge of the}} estate. Almost one hundred rooms made up the Italianate structure's three storeys, stretching across nine bays in a square formation. Cubitt contrived his own form of <b>soundproofing</b> by concealing seashells between levels. The flat roof was edged with a parapet embellished with balustrades, and a matching decoration was incorporated round the first floor, both made from Portland stone. Gibbs surrounds were used on the windows on the ground floor whereas triangular pediments featured on the windows included on the three central canted bays of the first floor. Segmented pediments adorned all the remaining windows. The water supply was provided by the well installed by Tyers, which was close to the southeast corner of the new mansion, via a corridor that spanned the entire outside of the mansion. The entrance had an attached porte-cochère enabling visitors to gain undercover access to the outer hall directly from their transport.|$|E

40|$|The {{shooting}} noise {{caused by}} shooting training, which has strength and impacts, {{is becoming a}} seri-ous damage to the residents around the shooting range and, consequently, the number of civil appeals against the shooting noise is on the constant increase. For this reason, the military examines the ef-fects of the shooting noise at the stage of design in constructing a shooting range and tries to build a <b>soundproof</b> shooting range to minimize civil appeals. However, the lack of research and data concern-ing propagation and attenuation, both of which characterize the shooting noise from within a sound-proof shooting range, even makes it so difficult to design a <b>soundproof</b> shooting range in constructing it. So this study used an acoustic simulation in a <b>soundproof</b> shooting range to identify acoustic and propagation characteristics within the shooting range and, on this basis, predicted the noise level at an exit of the <b>soundproof</b> shooting range. As a result, if the form and specifications of a <b>soundproof</b> shooting range were decided on at the stage of design, {{it was possible to}} use a simulation to design a <b>soundproof</b> shooting range with optimized acoustic performance and, on this basis, to predict a sound pressure level at an exit of the <b>soundproof</b> shooting range. On the basis of these data, it is probably possible to determine the degree {{of the effects of the}} shooting noise on the villages around a shootin...|$|R

25|$|Acoustical {{engineering}} {{is one of}} many other sub-disciplines of mechanical engineering and is the application of acoustics. Acoustical {{engineering is}} the study of Sound and Vibration. These engineers work effectively to reduce noise pollution in mechanical devices and in buildings by <b>soundproofing</b> or removing sources of unwanted noise. The study of acoustics can range from designing a more efficient hearing aid, microphone, headphone, or recording studio to enhancing the sound quality of an orchestra hall. Acoustical engineering also deals with the vibration of different mechanical systems.|$|E
25|$|Each {{cabin on}} the ship was {{completely}} pre-fabricated, with complete furnishing and <b>soundproofing,</b> and individually installed on board the ship. The ship was originally built with spacious cabins, all of which include illuminated closets, colour television and a VCR, with many cabins equipped with a bathtub. The 1999 refit added six suites {{in the place of}} former officers' cabins, while six balconies were added to the existing suites under the bridge wings. During the 2011/2012 refit, a small number of balcony cabins were created aft, while a considerable number of existing midships cabins were fitted with small French balconies.|$|E

On June 25, 1994, the line was cut back to Orient Heights at all times to permit reconstruction of the outer stations. Beachmont and Wood Island were completely rebuilt, while Suffolk Downs, Revere Beach and Wonderland were renovated. A simultaneous $8 million noise reduction program added sound walls at Beachmont and Orient Heights, rubber mats under tracks, and <b>soundproofing</b> of nearby homes.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{and explore}} the potential use of uHear as a screening test for determining hearing disability by evaluating its accuracy in a clinical setting and a <b>soundproof</b> booth {{when compared to the}} gold standard conventional audiometry.   Methods: Seventy Sultan Qaboos University students above the age of 17 years who had normal hearing were recruited for the study. They underwent a hearing test using conventional audiometry in a <b>soundproof</b> room, a self-administered uHear evaluation in a side room resembling a clinic setting, and a self-administered uHear test in a <b>soundproof</b> booth. The mean pure tone average (PTA) of thresholds at 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz for all the three test modalities was calculated, compared, and analyzed statistically.   Results: There were 36 male and 34 female students in the study. The PTA with conventional audiometry ranged from 1 to 21 dB across left and right ears. The PTA using uHear in the side room for the same participants was 25 dB in the right ear and 28 dB in the left ear (3 – 54 dB across all ears). The PTA for uHear in the <b>soundproof</b> booth was 18 dB and 17 dB (1 – 43 dB) in the right and left ears, respectively.

25|$|While {{investigators}} {{focused on}} the foam material that had been installed behind the stage, claiming the foam was intended for use in packaging and product display, testimony {{available to the public}} contradicts this. Testimony by Barry Warner, the salesman from American Foam who sold the foam to the Derderians, confirmed that there was a sales order for high-density acoustic <b>soundproofing</b> foam. Chemical analysis of the actual foam that was in the nightclub on the evening of the fire was never released to the public. A roll of foam confiscated from the basement of the nightclub after the fire was removed by the ATF but the testing done on that specific foam was never released to the public. Witnesses to the fire reported that once ignited, flames spread across the foam at approximately one foot per second.|$|E
25|$|Due {{in part to}} {{the impact}} of {{aircraft}} noise on south Minneapolis and surrounding suburbs, Northwest Airlines and others had proposed moving out of MSP and building a new airport on the fringes of the Twin Cities metro area to handle more large jets and more international traffic. Minneapolis and other neighboring cities were concerned that such a move would have a negative economic impact, so an arrangement was made where the Metropolitan Airports Commission would outfit many homes {{in the vicinity of the}} airport with sound insulation and air conditioning so that indoor noise could be reduced. A citizen group named ROAR (Residents Opposed to Airport Racket) was created in 1998 and helped push the MAC to make these concessions. Later, in 2004, the MAC voted to reduce funding for the <b>soundproofing</b> projects, stating in part that the economic climate had turned in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks. Minneapolis Mayor R. T. Rybak, who had been a founding member of ROAR, promised that the city would challenge the funding changes.|$|E
25|$|About an {{hour before}} midnight, the club was engulfed in flames because of a spark set off by pyrotechnics. Some {{witnesses}} said there was an explosion, but this was disputed and later dismissed by other sources. The club's ceiling was supported by pillars, which were coated with a flammable <b>soundproofing</b> foam. Soon after the pyrotechnics began, the foam {{on one of the}} pillars was ignited. The fire spread rapidly to the ceiling, eventually causing it to collapse. Media reported that club-goers initially thought the flames were part of the show and did not immediately react. When the ceiling caught fire, the approximately 200 to 400 people in the club panicked and rushed to the only working exit door at the venue, creating a stampede. The two-part door was only half opened, thus too narrow, so people climbed {{on top of each other}} in order to get out. Many of the casualties suffered from leg injuries after being trampled. A witness said terrified concert-goers had to break down the other half of the door to escape, but many people had already suffered burns, or were in respiratory distress. People also smashed windows in order to escape.|$|E
