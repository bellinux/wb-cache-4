5|$|The {{character}} of <b>Squealer</b> in Animal Farm by George Orwell {{is based on}} Molotov.|$|E

25|$|A further radio production, again using Orwell's own dramatisation of the book, was {{broadcast}} in January 2013 on BBC Radio 4. Tamsin Greig narrated, and the cast included Nicky Henson as Napoleon, Toby Jones as the propagandist <b>Squealer,</b> and Ralph Ineson as Boxer.|$|E

5000|$|In the English {{language}} {{the word}} [...] "stool pigeon" [...] refers {{to people who}} are secret informers or <b>squealers.</b> The image derives from the cooing sounds pigeons make.|$|R
50|$|In the end, {{this works}} out to <b>Squealer's</b> advantage. Terror and silver-tongued oration fool nearly everyone, and the sole animal who sees through these fronts, Benjamin, is simply too cynical to do anything.|$|R
500|$|Lyrically, the {{recording}} denounces a suitor by comparing {{them to a}} pig. Gaga wanted to lessen the harshness of the lyrics developed for the track by making it sound more lighthearted. However, she ended up [...] "screaming and squealing throughout the track." [...] The dance nature of the song vanishes when the chorus is reached, with Gaga belting the lyrics backed by the [...] "chaotic" [...] synths shouting, [...] "You're just a pig inside a human body / <b>Squealer,</b> <b>squealer,</b> <b>squealer,</b> you're so disgusting / You're just a pig inside", finally uttering the word [...] "Swine" [...] continuously as the groove [...] "thrashed".|$|E
500|$|The duck {{was first}} {{described}} by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789 {{and given the}} name Anas fulva but the name was [...] "preoccupied," [...] or already used, by Friedrich Christian Meuschen in 1787 for another species. This led to the next available name proposed by French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1816 from a Paraguayan specimen as Anas bicolor The whistling ducks were moved to their current genus, Dendrocygna, by British ornithologist William John Swainson in recognition of their differences from other ducks. The genus name {{is derived from the}} Ancient Greek dendron, [...] "tree", and Latin cygnus, [...] "swan", and [...] bicolor is Latin for [...] "two-coloured". [...] "Fulvous" [...] means reddish-yellow, and is derived from the Latin equivalent fulvus. Old and regional names include large whistling teal, brown tree duck, Mexican duck, <b>squealer</b> and Spanish cavalier.|$|E
2500|$|The pigs Snowball, Napoleon, and <b>Squealer</b> adapt Old Major's {{ideas into}} [...] "a {{complete}} system of thought", which they formally name Animalism, an allegoric reference to Communism. Soon after, Napoleon and <b>Squealer</b> partake in activities {{associated with the}} humans (drinking alcohol, sleeping in beds, trading), which were explicitly prohibited by the Seven Commandments. <b>Squealer</b> is employed to alter the Seven Commandments to account for this humanisation, an allusion to the Soviet government's revising of history in order to exercise control of the people's beliefs about themselves and their society.|$|E
5000|$|According to {{testimony}} in 1963 by mafia turncoat Joseph Valachi, Gambino crime family boss Albert Anastasia allegedly ordered {{the murder of}} Schuster. When Anastasia saw Schuster being interviewed on television, he allegedly said: [...] "I can't stand <b>squealers!</b> Hit that guy!" [...] However, many people in law enforcement were skeptical of it.|$|R
5000|$|In March 1952, Anastasia {{allegedly}} {{ordered the}} murder of Arnold Schuster. Schuster was a young New York man who successfully identified fugitive bank robber Willie Sutton, resulting in Sutton's arrest. When Anastasia saw Schuster being interviewed on television, he allegedly said: [...] "I can't stand <b>squealers!</b> Hit that guy!" [...] On March 8, 1952, a gunman shot Schuster to death on a street in Borough Park, Brooklyn. This public accusation against Anastasia was made in 1963 by government witness Joseph Valachi, but many people in law enforcement were skeptical of it. No one was ever arrested in the Schuster murder.|$|R
5000|$|The supreme {{commander}} of the Giant Hornet colony, he risked his own life to let Saki and Satoru return to their friends instead of executing them. Much later on, Kiroumaru's colony was decimated by the Robber Fly colony {{with the aid of}} their [...] "Messiah" [...] and he ended up at the Temple of Purification. After being released by Saki, Kiroumaru leads her and her group to the ruins of Tokyo to obtain the Psycho Buster to thwart <b>Squealer's</b> plans. After the plan with the Psycho Buster fails, revealing his own disdain for humans, Kiroumaru asks Saki to spare his colony from the humans' retaliation as he sacrifices himself to defeat the [...] "Messiah".|$|R
2500|$|Clover – A gentle, caring female horse, {{who shows}} concern {{especially}} for Boxer, who often pushes himself too hard. Clover can {{read all the}} letters of the alphabet, but cannot [...] "put words together". She seems to catch on to the sly tricks and schemes set up by Napoleon and <b>Squealer.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Napoleon enacts {{changes to}} the {{governance}} structure of the farm, replacing meetings with a committee of pigs who will run the farm. Through a young pig named <b>Squealer,</b> Napoleon claims credit for the windmill idea. The animals work harder {{with the promise of}} easier lives with the windmill. When the animals find the windmill collapsed after a violent storm, Napoleon and <b>Squealer</b> convince the animals that Snowball is trying to sabotage their project. Once Snowball becomes a scapegoat, Napoleon begins to purge the farm with his dogs, killing animals he accuses of consorting with his old rival. When some animals recall the Battle of the Cowshed, Napoleon (who {{was nowhere to be found}} during the battle) frequently smears Snowball as a collaborator of Jones', while falsely representing himself as the hero of the battle. [...] "Beasts of England" [...] is replaced with an anthem glorifying Napoleon, who appears to be adopting the lifestyle of a man. The animals remain convinced that they are better off than they were under Mr. Jones.|$|E
2500|$|Mr Frederick, {{one of the}} {{neighbouring}} farmers, attacks the farm, using blasting powder {{to blow up the}} restored windmill. Though the animals win the battle, they do so at great cost, as many, including Boxer the workhorse, are wounded. Despite his injuries, Boxer continues working harder and harder, until he collapses while working on the windmill. Napoleon sends for a van to take Boxer to the veterinary surgeon, explaining that better care can be given there. Benjamin, the cynical donkey who [...] "could read as well as any pig", notices that the van belongs to a knacker and attempts a futile rescue. <b>Squealer</b> quickly assures the animals that the van had been purchased from the knacker by an animal hospital, and the previous owner's signboard had not been repainted. In a subsequent report, <b>Squealer</b> reports sadly to the animals that Boxer died peacefully at the animal hospital; the pigs hold a festival one day after Boxer's death to further praise the glories of Animal Farm and have the animals work harder by taking on Boxer's ways. However, the truth was that Napoleon had engineered the sale of Boxer to the knacker, allowing him and his inner circle to acquire money to buy whisky for themselves. (In 1940s England, one way for farms to make money was to sell large animals to a knacker, who would kill the animal and boil its remains into animal glue.) ...|$|E
50|$|Boxer {{fights in}} the Battle of the Cowshed and the Battle of the Windmill, but is upset {{when he thinks}} he has killed a stable boy when, in fact, he had only stunned him. this shows that he is gentle in nature, even when dealing with an enemy. When Boxer defends Snowball's {{reputation}} from <b>Squealer's</b> revisionism, the pigs designate him as a target for the Great Purge, but he easily out muscles the dog executioners, sparing them at Napoleon's request. His death shows how far the pigs are willing to go. When he collapses from overwork, the pigs say they have sent him to a veterinarian, when they actually have {{sent him to the}} knacker's yard to be slaughtered, in exchange for money to buy a case of whiskey for the pigs to enjoy.|$|R
6000|$|Of {{the larger}} {{cities of the}} land, only Zenith had hesitated to submit its vices to Mike Monday and his expert {{reclamation}} corps. The more enterprising organizations of the city had voted to invite him--Mr. George F. Babbitt had once praised him in {{a speech at the}} Boosters' Club. But there was opposition from certain Episcopalian and Congregationalist ministers, those renegades whom Mr. Monday so finely called [...] "a bunch of gospel-pushers with dish-water instead of blood, a gang of <b>squealers</b> that need more dust on the knees of their pants and more hair on their skinny old chests." [...] This opposition had been crushed when the secretary of the Chamber of Commerce had reported to a committee of manufacturers that in every city where he had appeared, Mr. Monday had turned the minds of workmen from wages and hours to higher things, and thus averted strikes. He was immediately invited.|$|R
40|$|The {{decrease}} {{in the performance of}} centrifugal compressors operating at low Reynolds numbers (e. g., unmanned aerial vehicles at high altitudes or small turbomachines) can reach 10 % due to increased friction. The purposes of this review are to represent the state-of-the-art of the active and passive flow control methods used to improve performance and/or widen the operating range in numerous engineering applications, and to investigate their applicability in low-Reynolds-number centrifugal compressors. The applicable method should increase performance by reducing drag, increasing blade loading, or reducing tip leakage. Based on the aerodynamic and structural demands, passive methods like riblets, <b>squealers,</b> winglets and grooves could be beneficial; however, the drawbacks of these approaches are that their performance depends on the operating conditions and the effect might be negative at higher Reynolds numbers. The flow control method, which would reduce the boundary layer thickness and reduce wake, could have a beneficial impact on the performance of a low-Reynolds-number compressor in the entire operating range, but none of the methods represented in this review fully fulfil this objective...|$|R
2500|$|The sheep – They show limited {{understanding}} of the Animalism and the political atmosphere of the farm; yet nonetheless they blindly support Napoleon's ideals with vocal jingles during his speeches and meetings with Snowball. Some commentators have compared the sheep to representations of state controlled press. Their constant bleating of [...] "four legs good, two legs bad" [...] {{was used as a}} device to drown out any opposition; analogous to simplistic headlines used in printed media of the age. Towards the latter section of the book, <b>Squealer</b> (the propagandist) trains the sheep to alter their slogan to [...] "four legs good, two legs better", which they dutifully do. Symbolizing the state manipulation of media.|$|E
2500|$|Boxer – A loyal, kind, dedicated, {{extremely}} strong, hard working, and respectable cart-horse, although quite {{naive and}} gullible. Boxer does {{a large share}} of the physical labour on the farm. He is shown to hold the belief that 'Napoleon is always right'. At one point, he had challenged Squealer's statement that Snowball was always against the welfare of the farm, earning him an attack from Napoleon's dogs. But Boxer's immense strength repels the attack, worrying the pigs that their authority can be challenged. Boxer has been compared to the Stakhanovite movement. He has been described as [...] "faithful and strong"; he believes any problem can be solved if he works harder. When Boxer is injured, Napoleon sells him to a local knacker to buy himself whisky, and <b>Squealer</b> gives a moving account falsifying Boxer's death.|$|E

40|$|The {{main focus}} {{of this paper is}} on speeches in {{literary}} discourse as the superb ideological displays of propaganda as well as their translations for having an enormous capacity for ideological manipulation. In this paper, the only present English-Azarbaijani Turkish translation of <b>Squealer’s</b> speech from Orwell’s Animal Farm was discoursally analyzed based on House’s revised translation quality assessment (TQA) model. According to this model, speeches as propaganda in literary texts must be translated overtly to meet the standards of an adequate translation. Of the main criteria of an overt translation are co-activating the original discourse world and being equivalent at the levels of text, register, and genre. With respect to covertly and overtly erroneous errors, the findings of the study demonstrated that enormous ideological distortions and manipulation were carried out in the Turkish translation. Therefore, the translation was a covert and inadequate one. Moreover, the social effect the source and target texts’ readerships receive would be radically different from each other. Finally, some implications and suggestions for further studies were proposed...|$|R
6000|$|Pigs also possessed attractions for me, {{never having}} had an {{opportunity}} of observing their graces of mind and manner, till I came to Washington, whose porcine citizens appeared to enjoy a larger liberty than many of its human ones. Stout, sedate looking pigs, hurried by each morning to their places of business, with a preoccupied air, and sonorous greeting to their friends. Genteel pigs, with an extra curl to their tails, promenaded in pairs, lunching here and there, like gentlemen of leisure. Rowdy pigs pushed the passers by off the side walk; tipsy pigs hiccoughed their version of [...] "We wont go home till morning," [...] from the gutter; and delicate young pigs tripped daintily through the mud, as if, like [...] "Mrs. Peerybingle," [...] they plumed themselves upon their ankles, and kept themselves particularly neat in point of stockings. Maternal pigs, with their interesting families, strolled by in the sun; and often the pink, baby-like <b>squealers</b> lay down for a nap, with a trust in Providence worthy of human imitation.|$|R
60|$|Cy was a comrade {{after my}} own heart, {{and for a}} summer or two we kept the {{neighbourhood}} in a ferment by our adventures and hair-breadth escapes. I think I never knew a boy so full of mischief, and my opportunities of judging have been manifold. He did not get into scrapes himself, but possessed a splendid talent for deluding others into them, and then morally remarking, 'There, I told you so!' His way of saying 'You dars'nt do this or that' was like fire to powder; and why I {{still live in the}} possession of all my limbs and senses is a miracle to those who know my youthful friendship with Cy. It was he who incited me to jump off of the highest beam in the barn, to be borne home on a board with a pair of sprained ankles. It was he who dared me to rub my eyes with red peppers, and then sympathisingly led me home blind and roaring with pain. It was he who solemnly assured me that all the little pigs would die in agony if their tails were not cut off, and won me to hold thirteen little <b>squealers</b> while the operation was performed. Those thirteen innocent pink tails haunt me yet, and the memory of that deed has given me a truly Jewish aversion to pork.|$|R

60|$|The {{first thing}} the little humbug did was to produce a tiny white piglet from {{underneath}} his hat and pretend to pull it apart, making two. This act he repeated until all of the nine tiny piglets were visible, {{and they were so}} glad to get out of his pocket that they ran around in a very lively manner. The pretty little creatures would have been a novelty anywhere, so the people were as amazed and delighted at their appearance as even the Wizard could have desired. When he had made them all disappear again Ozma declared she was sorry they were gone, for she wanted one of them to pet and play with. So the Wizard pretended to take one of the piglets out of the hair of the Princess (while really he slyly took it from his inside pocket) and Ozma smiled joyously as the creature nestled in her arms, and she promised to have an emerald collar made for its fat neck and to keep the little <b>squealer</b> always at hand to amuse her.|$|E
6000|$|At {{that moment}} in Zenith, Jake Offutt, the politician, and Henry T. Thompson were in conference. Offutt suggested, [...] "The {{thing to do is}} to get your fool son-in-law, Babbitt, to put it over. He's one of these {{patriotic}} guys. When he grabs a piece of property for the gang, he makes it look like we were dyin' of love for the dear peepul, and I do love to buy respectability--reasonable. Wonder how long we can keep it up, Hank? We're safe as long as the good little boys like George Babbitt and all the nice respectable labor-leaders think you and me are rugged patriots. There's swell pickings for an honest politician here, Hank: a whole city working to provide cigars and fried chicken and dry martinis for us, and rallying to our banner with indignation, oh, fierce indignation, whenever some <b>squealer</b> like this fellow Seneca Doane comes along! Honest, Hank, a smart codger like me ought to be ashamed of himself if he didn't milk cattle like them, when they come around mooing for it! But the Traction gang can't get away with grand larceny like it used to. I wonder when--Hank, I wish we could fix some way to run this fellow Seneca Doane out of town. It's him or us!" ...|$|E
50|$|Hiccup brings Camicazi and Toothless (Toothless was {{supposed}} to be hibernating like the other hunting dragons, but he did not dig his hibernating hole deep enough, which could cause him to sleep for a long time, so Hiccup dug him up) on the journey to Hysteria, with One-eye pulling them on a sleigh. The two children enter through the roof of the great hall where the Hysterics are celebrating Freya'sday Friday. They lower Camicazi through the chimney, but Hiccup accidentally falls into a giant pot of onion soup, and gets discovered by Norbert the Nutjob. Hiccup makes Norbert show him the potato by pretending not to believe in the potato. Norbert finally reveals his father's preserved body, and in Norbert's father's hand is a glass case with the frozen potato which has an arrow stuck in it. Hiccup tries to persuade Norbert to give him the potato, but Norbert refuses. Norbert soon gets annoyed with Hiccup, and decides whether Hiccup should or should not die by throwing his double-sided axe into the air. If it lands on the black side, Hiccup will die, if it lands on the golden side, he will live. Hiccup cheats by catching the axe just as it is about to land on the black. Norbert is annoyed that Hiccup cheated, and locks him in the cage. After the Hysterics fall asleep, Camicazi picks the lock of Hiccup's cage; freeing him (Toothless took the key to cage from Norbert's pocket, but swallows it, and accidentally sets fire to a carpet). Camicazi lowers herself down with a rope and grabs the potato, but sees Norbert's ticking-thing in the glass case and takes that too. Suddenly, the preserved body of Norbert's father falls on a row of <b>Squealers</b> (a type of dragon that Vikings use as an alarm), who give ear-piercing screams. All the Hysterics suddenly wake up.|$|R

I put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did I tell him I was engaged for for fun to the son of a Spanish nobleman named Don Miguel de la Flora and he believed me that I was to be married to him in 3 years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things I told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the Spanish girls he didnt like I suppose one of them wouldnt have him I got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and the perragordas till I taught him Cappoquin he came from he said on the black water but it was too short then the day before he left May yes it was May when the infant king of Spain was born Im always like that in the spring Id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the rockgun near OHaras tower I told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old Barbary apes they sent to Clapham without a tail careering all over the show on
