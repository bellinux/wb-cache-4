40|$|The {{character}} of Raman spectra in the O–H stretching region collected at low temperatures (~– 180 °C) from fine-grained aggregates {{of ice and}} salt hydrate (hydrohalite or antarcticite or both) in the system H 2 O–NaCl–CaCl 2 reflects {{the composition of the}} parent solution and can be used to estimate the ratio of NaCl to CaCl 2 in the system. Comparison of these spectra with spectra collected from moderate-salinity natural fluid inclusions from the Oregon 3 granitic pegmatite, Colorado, allows non-destructive testing, and confirmation that these inclusions contain CaCl 2, as inferred from microthermometry. In both synthetic solutions in the H 2 O–NaCl–CaCl 2 system and in natural fluid inclusions, Raman <b>spectra</b> <b>collected</b> <b>after</b> initial freezing indicate the presence of ice, but not salt hydrates. Upon warming, a phase change is observed at temperatures of between – 70 and – 50 °C that appears as a darkening of the inclusion and that, during routine microthermometry, could be interpreted as a eutectic melting event. Raman <b>spectra</b> <b>collected</b> <b>after</b> this event indicate that it represents the crystallization of salt hydrates (hydrohalite and antarcticite), which we suggest occurs from an interstitial, hypersaline liquid. Many of the low “eutectic ” temperatures reported in the literature may thus not represent first melting (stable or metastable), and inferences made about the composition of fluid inclusions from such measurements may be erroneous...|$|E

Crystal structure, chemical composition, {{optical properties}} {{and the influence}} of heat treatment in either reactive or inert atmospheres have been investigated.

The optimization of the signal was performed daily for all pinhole apertures through mirror alignment, following the manufacturer’s instructions, using a rhodamine standard (or other adequate reference). For the study of red dyes, two filter holders with two sets of dichroic filters are employed, 500 and 570  nm in one set and 525 and 600  nm in the other set. This enables both the emission and excitation <b>spectra</b> to be <b>collected</b> with the same filter holder.

40|$|Two {{different}} surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensors are described, {{tested and}} compared against {{the detection of}} 2 -naphthalenethiol (2 NPT, a volatile compound) in both solution state as well as vapor phase. The first sensor {{is based on an}} optical fiber properly modeled to induce the adhesion of colloidal Ag nanoparticles on its surface. Excitation and detection of the Raman signal is performed through the optical fiber that can be used as in situ probe for the detection of molecules adsorbed on the SERS sensitized surface. The second SERS sensor is based on nanostructured substrates consisting of Au nanoparticles produced by pulsed laser deposition in presence of a controlled Ar atmosphere. Details at the nanometer scale were observed by SEM and TEM imaging to understand the size and structure of the islands formed as a function of deposition parameters that were selected in order to maximize their SERS response. The sensitivity of the substrates to volatile species was tested by letting evaporate controlled drops of a methanol solution of 2 NPT in a chamber of known volume, where the substrate was placed. After complete evaporation of the drops, this provided an in-situ environment suitable for vapor phase measurements at known concentration. SERS <b>spectra</b> were <b>collected</b> <b>after</b> exposing the substrates to the environment within the chamber (vapor phase measurements) or dipping them in a solution for condensed state measurements. The complete absence of the SH stretching peak in the SERS spectra proves the covalent bonding of 2 NPT to the metal substrates via the sulfur atom. DFT calculations, including metal-sulfur interaction, provide a good description of the observed SERS spectra. The reported data allow concluding that our SERS substrates are suitable for detection of volatile compounds...|$|R

Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy with fiber-optic probe was used as an on-line technique for monitoring the homogeneity of pharmaceutical blend during the blending process instead of the traditional techniques, such as high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) method. In this paper NIRS with a SabIR diffuse reflectance fiber-optic probe was used to monitor the blending process of coptis powder and lactose (excipient) with different contents, and further qualitative methods, like similarity, moving block of standard deviation and mean square were used for calculation purposes with the <b>collected</b> <b>spectra</b> <b>after</b> the pretreatment of multiplicative signal correction (MSC) and second derivative. Correlation spectrum was used for the wavelength selection. Four different coptis were blended with lactose separately to validate the proposed method, and the blending process of "liu wei di huang" pill was also simulated in bottles to verify this method on multiple herbal blends.

Illuminated n-Si/F–Gr and np^+-Si/F–Gr electrodes in contact with an aqueous K_ 3 (Fe(CN) _ 6 /K 4 (Fe(CN) _ 6 solutions exhibited stable short-circuit photocurrent densities of ∼ 10 mA cm^(– 2) for 100, 000 s (> 24 h), in comparison to bare Si electrodes, which yielded nearly a complete photocurrent decay over ∼ 100 s.

The variation of the open-circuit potential for n-Si/F–Gr in contact with a series of nonaqueous electrolytes of varying reduction potential indicated that the n-Si/F–Gr did not form a buried junction with respect to the solution contact. Further, illuminated n-Si/F−Gr electrodes in contact with Br_ 2 /HBr(aq) were significantly more electrochemically stable than n-Si−H electrodes, and n-Si/F−Gr electrodes coupled to a Pt catalyst exhibited ideal regenerative cell efficiencies of up to 5 % for the oxidation of Br^– to Br_ 2...|$|R

40|$|Proximal soil sensing (PSS) using {{portable}} visible-near infrared (vis-NIR: 400 - 2500 nm) spectrophotometers {{can be used}} {{to measure}} soil properties in situ. The objectives of this research were: (i) to compare field <b>spectra</b> <b>collected</b> in situ to <b>spectra</b> <b>collected</b> in the laboratory, (ii) to estimate soil colour and mineral composition from the spectra, and (iii) to make predictions of clay content using a spectral library that contains mostly <b>spectra</b> <b>collected</b> in the laboratory but also a smaller number of field <b>spectra</b> that were <b>collected</b> in situ. The evaluation was conducted using 10 soil profiles derived from different parent materials. Spectroscopic measurements were collected both in the field and in the laboratory at different depths, in triplicate. These spectra were compared multivariately using principal component analysis and by using wavelength specific t-tests. Except in the water absorption regions around 1400 nm and 1900 nm and in regions that are not primarily used to characterise soil mineral composition, field-collected spectra were not significantly different to <b>spectra</b> <b>collected</b> in the laboratory. Estimates of soil colour and mineral composition were made from the spectra using a continuum-removal technique and by targeting characteristic absorption features. Estimates of soil colour were derived from the spectra of each profile using the Munsell HVC and CIELab colour models. These were compared to qualitative estimates of Munsell colour made in the field. Spectroscopic estimates of soil colour were in fair agreement with Munsell book estimates, although the vis-NIR estimates tended to be somewhat darker and more yellow. Quantitative estimates of mineral composition were derived by comparing soil spectra to the spectra of pure minerals. These estimates were assessed using qualitative X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The characterisation of soil mineral composition by vis-NIR was effective, with good agreement between the results of this method and XRD analysis. The vis-NIR technique was less laborious than conventional XRD, did not require sample preparation and was better at detecting iron oxides. A spectral library containing 1287 laboratory-collected spectra and 74 <b>spectra</b> <b>collected</b> in situ at field conditions was used to develop partial least squares regression (PLSR) models to predict the clay content of both the field- and laboratory-collected spectra from the 10 soil profiles. Predictions of clay content from the field-collected spectra (RMSE = 7. 9 %) were slightly more accurate than those from the laboratory-collected spectra (RMSE = 8. 3 %). Extending the range of the PLSR calibrations by 'spiking' them with 74 field spectra improved the generalisation capacity of the models. PLSR with bootstrap aggregation, or bagging-PLSR (bPLSR), produced predictions of clay content for each profile with a measure of their uncertainty...|$|R
