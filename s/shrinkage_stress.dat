5000|$|When an inlay is used, the tooth-to-restoration margin may be {{finished}} and polished {{to a very}} fine line of contact to minimize recurrent decay. Opposed to this, direct composite filling pastes shrink a few percent in volume during hardening. This can lead to <b>shrinkage</b> <b>stress</b> and rarely to marginal gaps and failure. Although improvements of the composite resins could be achieved in the last years, solid inlays do exclude this problem. Another advantage of inlays over direct fillings {{is that there is}} almost no limitations in the choice of material.While inlays might be ten times the price of direct restorations, it is often expected that inlays are superior in terms of resistance to occlusal forces, protection against recurrent decay, precision of fabrication, marginal integrity, proper contouring for gingival (tissue) health, and ease of cleansing offers. However, this might be only the case for gold. While short term studies come to inconsistent conclusions, a respectable number of long-term studies detect no significantly lower failure rates of ceramic or composite [...] inlays compared to composite direct fillings. Another study detected an increased survival time of composite resin inlays but it was rated to not necessarily justify their bigger effort and price.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{spectral}} method, previously generalized {{for aging}} linear sys-tems, is applied {{in conjunction with}} the finite element method to an~lyze <b>shrinkage</b> <b>stresses</b> in aging viscoelastic structures exposed to random enVIron-mental humidity. The age-dependence of both drying diffusivity and creep properties are taken into account. The solution of pore humidity is obtained from a matrix differential equation in time, with complex-valued matrices. Elas-tic <b>shrinkage</b> <b>stresses</b> are then obtained from the matrix equations of the finite element method, in which the matrices are also complex-valued. The stresses in presence of aging creep are detennined by a sllperposition integral in time based on the relaxation function. Numerical examples concerning a long cylin-drical vessel exposed at the outer surface are given. The standard deviations of pore humidity and of stresses significantly vary with time, and their stan-dard deviation exhibits fluctuations about a drifting mean. The solution is prac-tically meaningful only if concrete does not crack, e. g., when a prestress suf-ficient to prevent cracking is introduced. For environmental fluctuations of long periods, such as one year, the computation is quite efficient; however, if short-time fluctuations are considered, the computing time becomes very large...|$|R

Secondly, experiments were conducted on an experimental composite to express its micro hardness, Young's modulus and viscosity as functions of the volumetric shrinkage. Shrinkage was measured with the digital image correlation method. Thirdly, the effects of the volumetric filler fraction and filler morphology on the material properties of dental composites were considered using finite element micro-structural models. Fourthly, the <b>shrinkage</b> <b>stress</b> produced by the experimental composite in the Bioman shrinkage-stress instrument was simulated using the finite element method.
