50|$|A <b>single-blade</b> <b>propeller</b> {{may be used}} on {{aircraft}} to generate thrust. Normally propellers are multiblades but the simplicity of a <b>single-blade</b> <b>propeller</b> fits well on motorized gliders, because it permits {{the design of a}} smaller aperture of the glider fuselage for retraction of the powerplant. The counterbalanced teetering mono-blade propeller generates fewer vibrations than conventional multiblade configurations. Often, single blade propeller configurations are touted as having a much greater efficiency than multiblade propellers, but this is a falsehood outside of the inertial losses in spinning a heavier propeller, and the minimal additional drag from added blades. Single bladed propellers are principally used to fulfill engineering requirements that fall outside of the scope of efficiency.|$|E
50|$|The Silent Club is {{a single}} seater {{sailplane}} of Italian manufacture. It is of the FAI type DU Class glider. It is sold by Alisport ready-to-fly or kit-built as pure glider or self-launching glider. The self-launching version is fitted with a <b>single-blade</b> <b>propeller</b> belt-driven by a two-stroke engine or optionally by an electric motor.|$|E
