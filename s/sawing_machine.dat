Saw slots parallel {{to each other and to}} the centerline of the roadway with a maximum tolerance of 1⁄4-inch per 12 inches of dowel bar length. Employ saws equipped with gang mounted diamond blades capable of cutting a minimum of three or four slots simultaneously in each wheel path.

40|$|The thesis investigates optical {{measuring}} {{and statistical}} data processing, and presents {{a method to}} understand and reduce sawing variation by examination of sawn timber sizes. Continuous timber size control offers improved opportunities for analysing <b>saw</b> <b>machines</b> or even individual sawblades. The thesis is illustrated with seven <b>saw</b> <b>machine</b> case studies {{that relate to the}} development of the technique. Log and cant breakdown is examined in single- and double-arbor circular saws and bandsaws. The first analysis of each <b>saw</b> <b>machine</b> is made in normal production, and the second using a controlled benchmarking test. A total of 44350 logs were sawn in the study. The behaviour of a <b>saw</b> <b>machine</b> is described using such descriptors as total, within-board and between-board standard deviations, and sawblade bend. Based on observations in benchmarking, an equation y=αeβx±R, where α and β are constants, R the process reproducibility, and x a variable that expresses sawing time and saw load, can be established for each of the <b>saw</b> <b>machine</b> descriptors. An example is the total standard deviation descriptor function s= 0. 21 e 0. 58 x± 0. 11, established for a single-arbor circular saw in a 4 -piece saw set-up. The method will help a sawmill to establish descriptors and equations used to describe the behaviour of their <b>saw</b> <b>machines,</b> to baseline <b>saw</b> <b>machine</b> performance and to compare it to best practices in the industry. The descriptors may be used to establish current, short- or long-term capabilities and characteristics. The method can be used to examine various production conditions and tooling, such as effects of log size, feed speed, and sawing time. Other factors include saw speed, sawblade parameters, operation of setworks and feedworks, and effects of seasons. The results of the study show that sawblade behaviour, feedworks and work piece holding problems, and previous <b>saw</b> <b>machines</b> may be causes of large sawing variation. reviewe...|$|R

Positioning faults affects location, type and values of wood features and sawn timber qualities forcing thus sawmill-men in Lithuania pay more and more attention and investments.

The paper established the mathematical model for the two-cylinder electro-hydraulic servo synchronous drive system, and revealed that the two-cylinder horizontal electro-hydraulic synchronous drive system has the cascade form of the linear system with the nonlinear system. Taking the band <b>sawing</b> <b>machine</b> and the broaching machine as the application object, the paper analyzed their compositions and synchronization CNC systems. Aiming at the dual-cylinder drive form for the broaching machine, the IPSO-PID synchronous controller of the two-cylinder system was designed.

40|$|Nowadays chain sawing {{machines}} have been prevailed throughout {{of the world}} not only in forestry but also in lumbering, civil engineering and so on. Neverthless, as cutter of saw chain is of pecular shape and presents complicated cutting mechanism, investigation about saw chain has scarcely been developed. The purpose {{of this research was}} to measure the cutting force and investigate the cutting mechanism as the first step for the synthetic study about chain <b>sawing</b> <b>machine</b> and saw chain. The experiment consisted of three parts Experiment (1) was the measuring of cutting force while the chain <b>sawing</b> <b>machine</b> being drived and wood specimen being cut through. Experiment (2) was that in order to know the situation of cutting in single cutter, cutting force was measured using the cutter which was restricted from rotation itself being fixed to the rneasuring apparatus. Experiment (3) was that in order to observe the rotation of cutter, cutting force in single cutter of the actual saw chain was measured and scene of the cutter motion was taken in photogragh. This report gives us the summary of cutting characteristics of saw chain which was made clear though the experiments and we can recognize that many problems for further discussion exist in saw chain. They are summarized as follows : (a) As the relation between cutting and chip formation is special the problem of chip formation and number of cutter which will take part in actual cutting must be investigated. (b) The　research for the reason based on the suitable chain tension is expected by means of cutting force theory. (c) The problem about rotation of chain link which causes the vibration and changing of cutting force is very inportant, and the study of tooth shape also must be examined. Moreover, it is previous question that we grasp the relation between cutting force and the change of the rake angle caused by inclination of cutter. For this purpose, the experiment with isotropic substance must be considered...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of an industrial computed tomography scanner for the sawmilling industry {{raises the question of}} how to find a production strategy that uses a computed tomography scanner in the sawmill production line to its full potential. This study was focused on a Scandinavian sawmill processing Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce (Picea abies). The potential value increase when allowing an alternative log rotation other than the horns down position was investigated using a log breakdown simulation. The resulting data was analysed with respect to the size of the log rotational step, an introduced rotational error of the <b>sawing</b> <b>machine</b> and different price differences between the quality grades. It was also of interest to define the outer log properties that characterise the logs sawn for the greatest profit return close to the horns down position compared to logs sawn for a greater profit return in a different log rotation. Such characteristics can be used to reduce the number of degrees of freedom in an optimisation and consider instead other parameters, such as positioning and sawing pattern. Other defects such as pitch pockets, splits and rot are also of interest. The results shows that there is a potential value increase when applying the log rotation that maximises the value for each log instead of processing all logs in the horns down position. However, the potential value increase depends on the rotational error of the used <b>sawing</b> <b>machine</b> and the price differences between the quality grades. The log properties that differ between logs sawn for the greatest profit return close to the horns down position compared to a different log rotation are the bow height and the log taper. Unfortunately, predictability of log rotation for greatest profit return based on the outer properties of logs is poor. It is not possible to differentiate logs which would be sawn for the greatest profit return close to the horns down position from those where a different log rotation results in the greatest profit return, based only on their outer properties...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{technology}} of {{thin film transistor}} liquid crystal display (LCD) has become more popular due to great demand for worldwide consumer electronic products. Driver integrated circuit (IC) is a critical device that is embedded sophisticated circuits to drive panels. Since narrow border design on display products is current trend, dimensions of driver ICs are shrunken. In the high-density LCD driver ICs, the operation of wafer sawing is essential and needs accurate yield assessment. However, inevitable process variance changes could arise from <b>sawing</b> <b>machine,</b> material, operation, and workmanship, {{and may not be}} detected within short time. Conventionally, manufacturing yield is evaluated applying typical yield measure index method under the assumptions that the processes are stable and normal. To assess manufacturing yield for Gamma wafer sawing processes more accurately, we present a modified yield measure index method. Using the proposed method, the magnitudes of the undetected variance change, which are functions of the detection power of the S 2 chart, are incorporated into the evaluation of manufacturing yield. In addition, we demonstrate, mathemati-cally, that the accommodation would not be affected by the scale parameter of Gamma distribution. For illustration purpose, a real-world case in a wafer sawing factory which is located on th...|$|E
