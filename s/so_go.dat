After winning reelection in the election of 1864, Lincoln made {{the passage of the}} Thirteenth Amendment his top legislative priority, beginning with his efforts in Congress during its [...] "lame duck" [...] session.

The ballad opens with the line [...] "I fought for you the hardest, it made me the strongest, So tell me your secrets — I just can't stand to see you leaving" [...] sang with emotional and touching vocals by the singer. The hook [...] "Heaven couldn't wait for you / No heaven couldn't wait for you / <b>So</b> <b>go</b> on, go home" [...] is continuously repeated. BET'a Latifah Muhammad described Beyoncé's vocal rendition as [...] "heartbreaking yet optimistic". [...] "Heaven" [...] closes with a spoken 20-second snippet outro of the Lord's Prayer (...) recited in Spanish by Melissa Vargas, the singer's brand manager. Many critics noted how the song may {{have been inspired by}} the singer's miscarriage. Clare Lobenfeld from Complex magazine concluded that the song featured Beyoncé's coping mechanisms for the loss of her child, which included using humor to hide pain. According to Spin writer Anupa Mistry, it is in line with one of the themes touched on in the parent album, motherhood. On the album, [...] "Heaven" [...] is placed before [...] "Blue", as the penultimate track. It was noted by critics that both songs were antidotes to each other– while the former discusses notions of death, the latter celebrates birth. Joey Guerra from the Houston Chronicle found the inclusion of those songs as the last on Beyoncé {{as a metaphor for the}} entire album [...] "Darkness always gives way to light, and heartbreak, if you hold on, is always followed by hope".|$|E

Sam Wilbur of AOL Radio complimented the song for being [...] "a feel-good track with a nostalgic, classic country feel". Billy Dukes of Taste of Country gave the song four stars and a half, writing [...] "It’s difficult for a female vocalist to sound sexy without drawing criticism. Clarkson’s voice is a wine and roses romance, instead of the wanton yearn of a beauty in a too-short skirt. The original ‘American Idol’ may have found her niche." [...] Michaelangelo Matos of New York Post gave the song three stars out of five and praised Clarkson for [...] "getting completely into character" [...] and successfully delivering the emotion of the song. Mark Blankenship of Logo complimented Clarkson for embracing her country side. Calling the song as [...] "a good song", he concluded his review by writing [...] "Even better, it’s a flirty, seductive love song, not a furious break-up anthem, which is a nice change after ten years of Kelly’s heartbroken rage." [...] Chuck Dauphin of Billboard ranked [...] "Don't Rush" [...] at number eight in his list of Top 10 Country Songs of 2012, writing [...] "One of the most luscious sounding love songs I have heard in a while.
