40|$|In {{the last}} few years the number of <b>sewing</b> <b>companies</b> located in Latvia has {{decreased}} rapidly due to market change. It involves not only the growing competition but also the low salary which decreases the number of workers in the field. The companies are forced to work overtime to fulfill the orders. The lack of labor force is enormous and constitutes a menace to the vitality of the company. It is not possible to work in such conditions by using traditional forms of work management and the companies have to try to re-orient to more efficient work. One of the ways to try to solve the gathered overall production and labor force problems is to introduce lean manufacturing and cross over to team work management, i. e. merging together small numbers of workers for a single target. Latvian companies use traditional form of production management and team work is little common. In a certain way it is connected with lack of knowledge but there can be other problems too. The article reflects research results about the Latvian <b>sewing</b> <b>companies</b> done with the aim to determine the chances for Latvian <b>sewing</b> <b>companies</b> to change over to a new kind of work organization and to analyze what problems could appear in the process of transition considering the mentality of people in Latvia...|$|R

As {{a result of the}} analysis and systematization of the data necessary for the determination of working time expenditure, an outdoor clothing assortment group time norms setting three module system has been created to determine manual, machine-manual and machine work time expenditure, a hierarchical structure of the data to be processed/used, and appropriate classification levels have been created...|$|R
