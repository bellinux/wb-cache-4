5000|$|Side-scrolling was a {{well-known}} phenomenon in arcade, and various home computer and console {{games of the}} 1980s, as they often possessed hardware optimised for the task like the Atari 800 [...] and Commodore 64, but IBM compatible PCs did not. <b>Smooth</b> <b>scrolling</b> on IBM PCs in software was a challenge for developers. There were {{a small number of}} PC ports of <b>smooth</b> <b>scrolling</b> arcade games in the early 1980s, including Moon Patrol [...] and Defender. [...] The second version of Sopwith, released in 1986, also featured <b>smooth</b> <b>scrolling.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Scrolling {{may take}} place in {{discrete}} increments (perhaps {{one or a few}} lines of text at a time), or continuously (<b>smooth</b> <b>scrolling).</b> Frame rate is the speed at which an entire image is redisplayed. It is related to scrolling in that changes to text and image position can only happen as often as the image can be redisplayed. When frame rate is a limiting factor, one <b>smooth</b> <b>scrolling</b> technique is to blur images during movement that would otherwise appear to [...] "jump".|$|R
50|$|GNU nano {{implements}} some {{features that}} Pico lacks, including colored text, regular expression search and replace, <b>smooth</b> <b>scrolling,</b> multiple buffers, rebindable key support, and undoing and redoing of edit changes.|$|R
5000|$|On {{its initial}} release, Your Spectrum praised the driver's view graphics, with Popular Computing Weekly praising the <b>smooth</b> <b>scrolling,</b> with Your Spectrum agreeing. ZX Computing {{summarised}} {{the game as}} [...] "realistic,... exciting and highly enjoyable".|$|R
5000|$|Jonathan [...] "Joffa" [...] Smith wrote Cobra, Hysteria, Firefly and a {{conversion}} from the Green Beret arcade among other games which prove that <b>smooth</b> <b>scrolling</b> {{was never a}} problem on the ZX Spectrum, {{as long as the}} developer had the necessary technical knowledge.|$|R
50|$|Shadow World was {{the last}} {{in a series of}} games Potter wrote for Synapse in a one-year period between November 1981. All of these games made use of <b>smooth</b> <b>scrolling</b> and {{demonstrated}} an evolution in technique, growing more graphically complex over time, and becoming much faster paced.|$|R
50|$|The game map {{was created}} using a custom {{character}} set drawn in the Atari's five-color text mode. Each dungeon level is three screens wide and high. The Atari's special <b>smooth</b> <b>scrolling</b> hardware {{is used to}} pan around the level, while the player/missile graphics capabilities are not used.|$|R
5000|$|The {{technique}} used to store {{such a huge}} world involved creating small-sized maps out of small shape-sized blocks. Those small maps were reused and fit together seamlessly to form larger areas. Loading is asynchronous, and will happen when nearing the boundary of an area, without affecting the <b>smooth</b> <b>scrolling,</b> animation, and music.|$|R
50|$|A {{solution}} {{is found in}} the Amstrad CPC, which combines the row address and character address to provide linear scanlines within a non-linear buffer. It maps row address RA0-RA2 to memory address MA11-MA13 and character address CA0-CA10 to memory address MA0-MA10. This has the advantages of easier programming for non-character display and easy <b>smooth</b> horizontal <b>scrolling</b> but can impede <b>smooth</b> vertical <b>scrolling.</b>|$|R
50|$|Carmack {{used these}} {{capabilities}} {{to create a}} buffer that was 64 pixels wider and taller than the screen, leaving room for one extra row and column of tiles in the buffer {{off the edge of}} the screen. He used the offset capabilities of the card to let the screen slide through the buffer for <b>smooth</b> <b>scrolling,</b> which would partially reveal the extra tiles.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper we discuss {{coherent}} sheaves of rank > 1 whose projectivization gives rise to smooth varieties - varieties of this type are also called <b>smooth</b> <b>scrolls.</b> We prove some basic properties of these varieties and we give some pertinent examples. We classify Fano manifolds of large index which are of this type. Comment: 19 pages, plain Te...|$|R
50|$|Crawford, {{the lead}} {{author of the}} book, used many of these {{features}} in the seminal wargame Eastern Front (1941) released the previous year. Eastern Front made extensive use of <b>smooth</b> <b>scrolling,</b> custom character graphics, and some use of player-missile graphics and basic sound. Another of the book's authors, Jim Dunion, used custom display lists in the DDT tool (a 6502 debugger) to produce a partitioned, IDE-like display.|$|R
50|$|The mission {{takes place}} on a single large side-scrolling map, several times wider than the {{physical}} display. <b>Smooth</b> <b>scrolling</b> is used to keep the player roughly centred as they fly. If the player's ship hits the ground, buildings or the enemy spacecraft, it tumbles to the ground before being pulled away by an ambulance. There are several levels with increasingly difficult enemies and terrain.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{personal}} computer-based teleprompter, Compu=Prompt {{appeared in}} 1982. It was invented and marketed by Courtney M. Goodin and Laurence B. Abrams in Los Angeles, California. The custom software and specially-redesigned camera hardware {{ran on the}} Atari 800 Personal Computer, which featured <b>smooth</b> hardware-assisted <b>scrolling.</b> Their company later became ProPrompt, Inc., which is still providing teleprompting services over 32 years later. Other paper-based teleprompting companies Electronic Script Prompting, QTV and Telescript followed suit and developed their own software several years later, when computers with enough graphics power to provide the <b>smooth</b> <b>scrolling</b> text became available. In January 2010 Compu=Prompt received a Technology and Engineering Emmy Award for [...] "Pioneering Development in Electronic Prompting".|$|R
50|$|Team 17 Digital Limited (formerly 17-Bit Software {{and later}} Team 17 Software Limited), doing {{business}} as Team17, is a British video game developer {{best known for}} creating the Worms and Alien Breed video game series. Most of their early releases were on the Amiga home computer system and featured trademark <b>smooth</b> <b>scrolling,</b> and detailed cartoonish art. Team17 now develops for Microsoft Windows, Android, iOS, and video game consoles.|$|R
50|$|Team17's earlier games became {{relatively}} obscure {{after the}} release of the hugely popular Worms series, though many gamers remember Superfrog fondly for its solid gameplay, <b>smooth</b> <b>scrolling,</b> cartoon-quality graphics, and upbeat music by composer Allister Brimble. Although a relatively small release by the standards of blockbuster platformers like Sonic, it was very well received and has retained a fan base which considers it a technically perfect example of the genre.|$|R
5000|$|GamePros Grease Monkey {{said the}} game has fast, <b>smooth</b> <b>scrolling</b> but blocky visuals. He criticized the lack of realism, {{particularly}} {{that there are no}} falls or crashes, and felt the way the soundtrack changes according to what's going on in the race made the sound too chaotic. He concluded, [...] "Dirt Trax FX is a fun game, but serious gear heads will pass in favor of more lifelike motorcycle excitement." ...|$|R
5000|$|Unlike Pico, nano uses meta keys {{to toggle}} its behavior. For example, [...] toggles <b>smooth</b> <b>scrolling</b> mode on and off. Almost all {{features}} {{that can be}} selected from the command line can be dynamically toggled. On keyboards without the meta key it is often mapped to the escape key, , such {{that in order to}} simulate, say, [...] one has to press the [...] key, then release it, and then press the [...] key.|$|R
50|$|The game {{engine for}} Alien Breed II was largely rewritten to allow <b>smoother</b> <b>scrolling</b> between screens (the code for which was carried over to another Team17 project, Superfrog, a 2D {{platformer}} game). The graphics were also vastly improved, {{as were the}} size and number of levels (there are 17 in AB-II compared to 6 in Alien Breed and 12 in Alien Breed Special Edition 92). The difficulty curve for AB-II is also steeper than that of its predecessor.|$|R
50|$|Big Trouble in Little China {{received}} diverse critical reception. Your Sinclair awarded 8 out of 10, highlighting <b>smooth</b> <b>scrolling</b> {{and good}} sprite animation, only criticising the unbalanced difficulty with some enemies. In a later retrospective on tie-in licences, Your Sinclair found the animation to be poor, with little variety in enemy types, and amended their score to 52%. Conversely, Sinclair User gave only 1 star out of 5, describing the characters as poorly depicted, with no atmosphere or sound effects.|$|R
50|$|According to Dennis Muren, {{who worked}} on the six films, crawls on the {{original}} trilogy films were accomplished by filming physical models laid out on the floor. The models were approximately 60 cm (2') wide and 1.80 m (6') long. The crawl effect was accomplished by the camera moving longitudinally along the model. It was difficult and time-consuming to achieve a <b>smooth</b> <b>scrolling</b> effect. Furthermore, different versions in other languages (such as German, French and Spanish) were produced by Industrial Light & Magic.|$|R
50|$|Finding {{development}} on the systems difficult {{due to a lack}} of clear information, he started experimenting with the Atari 8-bit computer's hardware assisted <b>smooth</b> <b>scrolling</b> and used it to produce a scrolling map display. This work was used to create Eastern Front (1941), which is widely considered one of the first wargames on a microcomputer to compete with traditional paper-n-pencil games in terms of depth. He followed this with Legionnaire, based on the same display engine but adding real-time instead of turn-based game play.|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to find an optimal electronic text display method given limited display space. The display formats tested fell into two categories: Times Square, in which text is scrolled from right to left; and rapid, serial, visual presentation (RSVP), in which text is presented one or several words {{at a time to}} a fixed location in the display. Previous studies have indicated that Times Square format is not as efficient as page format display or, by extrapolation, as RSVP. These studies, unlike the present experiments, did not include a smooth-scrolling (pixel-by-pixel) condition. In Experiment 1, a comparison was made between multiple-word RSVP and three versions of Times Square format, differing only in the size of steps by which the display was scrolled. Except for the largest step-size, comprehension was as high in the Times Square conditions as in the RSVP condition. The subjects expressed a significant preference for <b>smooth</b> <b>scrolling</b> Times Square over any other condition. Experiment 2 showed that comprehension for <b>smooth</b> <b>scrolling</b> Times Square was at least as high as that for RSVP at presentation rates ranging from 100 to 300 words per minute. Times Square reading is discussed in terms of optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) ...|$|R

50|$|Using the {{knowledge}} gathered while writing these games, he helped produce technical documentation covering {{most of the}} advanced features of the Atari computer, from the hardware assisted <b>smooth</b> <b>scrolling</b> to digitized sounds, with the information presented in a friendly format for a wide audience. This included videos distributed by ACE (Atari Computer Enthusiast) Support to user groups, {{and a series of}} articles published in BYTE magazine containing most of the content of the book, De Re Atari that would be published later. Another book followed, The Art of Computer Game Design.|$|R
50|$|In 1990 John Carmack, {{then working}} for Softdisk, {{developed}} a <b>smooth</b> <b>scrolling</b> technique known as adaptive tile refresh. The technique was demonstrated {{in with the}} proof-of-concept game Dangerous Dave in Copyright Infringement, which was a clone of the first level of Super Mario Bros. 3, but with Mario replaced by the character Dangerous Dave of earlier Softdisk games. The success of the demonstration led Carmack and others at Softdisk to resign and form their own company, id Software. Id Software went on to develop Commander Keen that same year, {{which was the first}} publicly available PC platform game to feature smoothly-scrolling graphics.|$|R
50|$|Locomotive BASIC {{compared}} to the Commodore 64's BASIC (Commodore BASIC), which had no dedicated commands for graphics or sound, allowed doing pretty much anything that was within the standard capabilities of the machine. This was not unimportant, as some other machines of the era using full graphics or sound was limited to assembler programmers. MSX, Spectrum and some others offered a similar, more or less complete command set for their sound and graphics capabilities. The only things going clearly beyond BASIC capabilities were the overscan modes used in games and demos, weird 27-color graphics modes, digital sound playback, and <b>smooth</b> <b>scrolling.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Nautilus is an {{excellent}} example of the sorts of graphical [...] "tricks" [...] the Atari 8-bit series was capable of. Graphics were drawn by a pair of co-operating display chips, the ANTIC which {{was in charge of the}} background graphics and text, and the GTIA which handled player-missile graphics in the foreground and was in charge of adding color. The ANTIC was instructed how to set up the screen on a line-by-line basis by instructions encoded in the [...] "display list", which included flags for options like <b>smooth</b> <b>scrolling.</b> This allowed the display to support different options or modes vertically down the screen.|$|R
5000|$|Added command SET <b>SCROLL</b> for <b>smooth,</b> {{hardware}} based <b>scrolling</b> in BASIC ...|$|R
50|$|AGA is able {{to display}} {{graphics}} modes with a depth of up to 8 bits per pixel. This allows for 256 colors in indexed display modes and 262,144 colors (18-bit) in Hold-And-Modify (HAM-8) modes. The palette for the AGA chipset has 256 entries from 16,777,216 colors (24-bit), whereas previous chipsets, the Amiga Original Chip Set (OCS) and Amiga Enhanced Chip Set (ECS), only allowed 32 colors out of 4096 (64 colors in Amiga Extra Half-Brite (EHB mode)). Other features added to AGA over ECS were super-hi-res <b>smooth</b> <b>scrolling</b> and 32-bit fast page memory fetches to supply the graphics data bandwidth for 8 bitplane graphics modes and wider sprites.|$|R
50|$|The game {{vertically}} scrolls, {{with the}} player {{being able to}} change direction at any time, but not change speed. The landscape loops with the player being able to reach the bottom by travelling up far enough, and vice versa. The game is incredibly fast and <b>smooth</b> <b>scrolling</b> (particularly for the Acorn Electron which lacks hardware scrolling ability), and the author once stated that he designed Syncron as an exercise in pure speed rather than playability. The levels feature tall buildings {{that need to be}} avoided. As the scrolling is so fast, the player must learn the layout of the level to avoid these hazards.|$|R
2500|$|In 1990, DOS PC gaming made a {{breakthrough}} in the genre. Commander Keen, released by id Software, became the first IBM-compatible PC platformer to feature <b>smooth</b> <b>scrolling</b> graphics, thanks to a technique developed by programmer John Carmack called [...] "adaptive tile refresh". The success of this game via the shareware distribution model prompted many others to attempt more console-styled scrolling platformers on the PC, including Todd Replogle's Duke Nukem, Duke Nukem II, Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure and Dark Ages by Apogee Software, and Jill of the Jungle, Xargon and Jazz Jackrabbit by Epic MegaGames. [...] These games helped fuel the shareware model, which would drive PC gaming to greater relevance {{in the early to}} mid-1990s.|$|R
50|$|Pitfall II: Lost Caverns {{was one of}} {{the largest}} games ever created for the Atari 2600 and {{featured}} elements previously considered impossible on hardware that was already six years old at the time. <b>Smooth</b> <b>scrolling,</b> detailed animation, and a musical score that includes multiple channels were all made possible by custom hardware built inside the game cartridge. Crane designed and patented a component he called the Display Processor Chip (DPC), which could greatly enhance 2600's graphics capabilities and could process music in 3 channels plus drums. Crane hoped that the DPC would be used by other game designers to further extend the life of the aging console, but the video game crash of 1983 made this moot.|$|R
