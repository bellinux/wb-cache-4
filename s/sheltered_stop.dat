500|$|As in Libya, Mackay {{shared the}} hardships {{of living in the}} field with his men, and {{impressed}} them by his coolness during air raids. They watched him sit in the open during attacks; on one such occasion on 19 April 1941, Mackay waited out a two-and-a-half-hour raid when his car was hit and his driver wounded. One staff officer [...] "noticed Mackay moving in front of his tent quite unconcerned about the movement of enemy planes. He neither looked at the planes nor at the men dashing about, but they saw him, and those moving towards <b>shelter</b> <b>stopped,</b> and many of those who had gained shelter returned to their duties. Personal example is the only paying proposition in such circumstances". For his actions in Greece, he was mentioned in despatches a sixth time, and awarded the Greek War Cross (First Class).|$|R

DeBakey made wide use of animals in his research.

Responding to the need for animal research, DeBakey stated that [...] "These scientists, veterinarians, physicians, surgeons and others who do research in animal labs are as much concerned about the care of the animals as anyone can be. Their respect for the dignity of life and compassion for the sick and disabled, in fact, is what motivated them to search for ways of relieving the pain and suffering caused by diseases." ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the first stage}} of an applied research project that explores parametric design strategies in a context of rural bus <b>stop</b> <b>shelters.</b> The aim of the research is to propose a possible method for improving current state of public infrastructure in rural locations of the Czech Republic. The research project examines, in a practical way, how advanced design techniques and new technologies could help architects and designers participate in some areas of the building industry that have been out of reach of professional designers. Rural bus <b>stop</b> <b>shelters</b> in Czech Republic serve as an example of one particular “unreachable” area. During {{the first stage of}} the research (described in this paper), we developed a parametric system of design and production of a bus <b>stop</b> <b>shelter</b> and we commissioned a fully functional prototype to be built. In the outlook of the research, participation of users in the design process is outlined...|$|R

40|$|The {{functions}} of bus <b>stop</b> <b>shelters</b> and factors affecting their placement at stops in transit systems are analyzed. Drawing on {{information from a}} variety of sources, current shelter placement policy in Los Angeles was found to be guided principally by the revenue-generating potential of shelter advertisements, secondarily by political concerns over geographic equity, and only peripherally on the basis of bus stop use. Using data on <b>shelter</b> and <b>stop</b> locations, boardings, and headways, a methodology is developed for measuring the cumulative use of bus stops with regard to person-min of wait time. Then this measure is used to evaluate three scenarios of bus stop placement, each of which optimizes the goals of (a) private shelter providers, (b) locally elected officials, and (c) bus patrons, respectively. The conclusion is that their of the latter two scenarios would dramatically – by 2. 3 person-years each day – increase the time that bus patrons in Los Angeles spend under shelter while waiting for buses at stops. This analysis both demonstrates the utility of using stop-coded boarding data in combination with headway data in the planning of bus <b>stop</b> <b>shelters</b> and shows the ineffectiveness and inequities that can arise when the sheltering of waiting passengers is not explicitly incorporated into policies guiding the placement of transit shelters...|$|R
