5|$|The name Burnham {{is derived}} from Burnhamm, {{as it was called}} in the will of King Alfred, made up from the Old English words Burna meaning <b>stream</b> <b>and</b> Hamm for enclosure. On-Sea was added later as there are several other towns of the same name in England.|$|E
5|$|A map of Kintzheim in Alsace from 1348 {{contains}} the text zu dem Russelinge, {{but it is}} not certain that this reference is to the grape variety. However, in 1477, Riesling was documented in Alsace under the spelling Rissling. In Wachau in Austria, there is a small <b>stream</b> <b>and</b> a small vineyard both called Ritzling, which are claimed locally to have given Riesling its name. However, {{there seems to be no}} documentary evidence to back this up, so this claim is not widely believed to be correct.|$|E
40|$|Broadcasting {{of media}} events is a {{real-time}} action demanding reliable {{just in time}} decisions based on the current content of incoming video <b>streams</b> <b>and</b> the availability of background material. Multi-stream broadcasting {{of this type of}} event thus demand monitoring of multiple <b>streams</b> <b>and</b> background material. Due to the potentially large amount of <b>streams</b> <b>and</b> other available material, manual monitoring is likely to fail on the long term. We therefore developed an indexing pipeline based on semantic technologies that enables real-time analysis of broadcasted <b>streams</b> <b>and</b> reliable content recommendations of <b>streams</b> <b>and</b> background material based on formal machine understandable descriptions of content. Our approach enables real-time interpretation of broadcasted <b>streams</b> <b>and</b> thus establishes a bridge over the “Semantic Gap” in video analysis...|$|R

Any effect would vary by region.|$|E

5|$|The Rhondda Valley {{is located}} in the upland, or Blaenau, area of Glamorgan. The {{landscape}} of the Rhondda was formed by glacial action during the last ice age, as slow moving glaciers gouged out the deep valleys that exist today. With the retreat of the ice sheet, around 8000BC, the valleys were further modified by <b>stream</b> <b>and</b> river action. This left the two river valleys of the Rhondda with narrow, steep sided slopes which would dictate the layout of settlements from early to modern times.|$|E

5|$|A {{light ray}} {{emanating from the}} source S is {{reflected}} by a beam splitter G and is collimated into a parallel beam by lens L. After passing the slits O1 and O2, two rays of light travel through the tubes A1 and A2, through which water is streaming {{back and forth as}} shown by the arrows. The rays reflect off a mirror m at the focus of lens L, so that one ray always propagates {{in the same direction as}} the water <b>stream,</b> <b>and</b> the other ray opposite to the direction of the water stream. After passing back and forth through the tubes, both rays unite at S, where they produce interference fringes that can be visualized through the illustrated eyepiece. The interference pattern can be analyzed to determine the speed of light traveling along each leg of the tube.|$|E

Afterward, the British refused to believe that they had been beaten by militia. On 23 January two British regiments were waylaid by Brigadier General William Maxwell near Woodbridge. The 200 New Jersey Continentals inflicted losses of seven killed and 12 wounded while only suffering two men wounded.|$|E
5|$|Both HDMI and DVI use TMDS to send 10-bit {{characters}} that are encoded using 8b/10b encoding that {{differs from the}} original IBM form for the Video Data Period and 2b/10b encoding for the Control Period. HDMI adds the ability to send audio and auxiliary data using 4b/10b encoding for the Data Island Period. Each Data Island Period is 32 pixels in size and contains a 32-bit Packet Header, which includes 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data for error correction and describes {{the contents of the}} packet. Each packet contains four subpackets, and each subpacket is 64 bits in size, including 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data, allowing for each packet to carry up to 224 bits of audio data. Each Data Island Period can contain up to 18 packets. Seven of the 15 packet types described in the HDMI 1.3a specifications deal with audio data, while the other 8 types deal with auxiliary data. Among these are the General Control Packet and the Gamut Metadata Packet. The General Control Packet carries information on AVMUTE (which mutes the audio during changes that may cause audio noise) and Color Depth (which sends the bit depth of the current video <b>stream</b> <b>and</b> is required for deep color). The Gamut Metadata Packet carries information on the color space being used for the current video <b>stream</b> <b>and</b> is required for xvYCC.|$|E

The two baileys, {{stretching}} alongside from the motte along the north and east, were protected by deep ditches and steep palisades, with either a causeway or a drawbridge linking the inner to the outer bailey; the inner bailey was also sheltered by the curve of the Chilton.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before the}} Chicago Fire, the block {{was home to}} one of Chicago's largest theaters. During the late 19th century, tall office {{buildings}} proliferated on the block. By 1970, the block was densely developed with 11 buildings, housing theaters, offices, a YMCA, and retailers like Stop & Shop, a grocer. On June 14, 1973, Mayor Richard J. Daley announced a broad urban renewal initiative centered on the North Loop theater district. Over the ensuing 16 years, numerous private developers, notably the Rubloff Company and JMB Realty, planned large mixed-use developments on the site, with a mall along State Street and hotels and office towers above. Property assembly was facilitated by Mayor Harold Washington's creation of the North Loop tax increment financing district in 1983, which gave the urban renewal effort a steady revenue <b>stream</b> <b>and</b> eminent domain authority.|$|E
