The analysis is based on the catastrophe theory. We first construct a two-dimensional Markovian model, which is equivalent to the model devised for IEEE 802. 11 DCF by Bianchi. Then, the balance function of the system is formulated whose zeros provide equilibrium operating points. Finally, we prove that the system is mono-stable for any set of contention window sizes, if the number of allowable retransmissions is {{less than or equal to}} eight.
