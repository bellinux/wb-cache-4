40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new multi-channel MAC protocol for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks, namely, Asynchronous Multi-Channel MAC (AMCMAC). The AMCMAC supports simultaneous transmissions on different <b>service</b> <b>channels,</b> as well as, allowing other nodes to make rendezvous with their provider/receiver or broadcast emergency messages {{on the control}} channel. We compare {{the performance of the}} proposed protocol with that of IEEE 1609. 4 and Asynchronous Multichannel Coordination Protocol (AMCP), in terms of throughput on control and <b>service</b> <b>channels,</b> channel utilization, and the penetration rate of successfully broadcast emergency messages. We demonstrate that AMCMAC outperforms IEEE 1609. 4 and AMCP in terms of system throughput by increasing the utilization of control <b>channel</b> and <b>service</b> <b>channels.</b> In addition, AMCMAC mitigates both the multi-channel hidden terminal and missing receiver problems which occur in asynchronous multichannel MAC protocols. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this article}} is to {{delineate}} a number of different disintermediation mechanisms within the context of business-to-business (B 2 B) <b>service</b> <b>channels</b> and to identify the specific challenges associated with adopting these mechanisms. Methodology: The research was conducted in accordance with abductive reasoning, moving continuously between the empirical world of 4 industrial (B 2 B) firms and the model world. Findings: This article delineates a choice of 6 disintermediation mechanisms and their attendant challenges within the context of industrial <b>service</b> <b>channels.</b> Contribution: The article provides an original conceptualization of disintermediation, which is detached from the traditional understanding of the concept. As such, it constitutes a useful starting point for the development of a formal theory of disintermediation. Implications for Practice: This article should be useful for practitioners, because it presents various disintermediation options available to industrial firms faced by undesired intermediaries in their industrial <b>service</b> <b>channels.</b> faced by undesired intermediaries in their industrial <b>service</b> <b>channels...</b>|$|R

25|$|Abramoff was a {{lobbyist}} for the school TV news <b>service</b> <b>Channel</b> One News. From 1999 to 2003, Channel One retained him to ensure Congress did not block funds to their service.

Since Abramoff and Channel One parted ways, Channel One's advertising revenues have dropped substantially, but a cause-and-effect relationship {{would be difficult to}} establish.|$|E
