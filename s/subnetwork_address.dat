40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{architecture}} for the Connection-mode Network Service traffic routing. Basically, we extend {{the scope of}} the applicability of the <b>Subnetwork</b> <b>Address</b> Resolution Entity to the IS-IS Intra-domain case. The SNARE concept is flexible since it allows one to design routing as purely centralized or completely distributed. We note that it is possible either to use ISO 10589 or to adapt this protocol in order to ensure routing information distribution. For the inter-domain case, we propose to re-use as much as possible the existing IDRP. Some modifications are either required for a proper operation of the protocol for the CONS support or are desirable to benefit from the native CO capability. © 1992.

50|$|In Internet {{networking}} terminology, a supernet is a {{block of}} contiguous <b>subnetworks</b> <b>addressed</b> as a single subnet in the larger network. Supernets always have a subnet mask that is smaller than the masks of the component networks.|$|R
50|$|IGRP is {{considered}} a classful routing protocol. Because the protocol has no field for a subnet mask, the router assumes that all <b>subnetwork</b> <b>addresses</b> within the same Class A, Class B, or Class C network have the same subnet mask as the subnet mask configured for the interfaces in question. This contrasts with classless routing protocols that can use variable length subnet masks. Classful protocols have become less popular as they are wasteful of IP address space.|$|R

Routes are established during service node registration. PRIME makes use of address structure for packet routing, which reduces state information needed by service nodes. Base node and service nodes monitor network attachment based on periodic exchanged control messages, so called [...] "keep alive messages".|$|R

Copyright Notice Copyright (C) The Internet Society (1998). All Rights Reserved. This document describes the NBMA Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP). NHRP {{can be used by}} a source station (host or router) connected to a Non-Broadcast, Multi-Access (NBMA) subnetwork to determine the internetworking layer <b>address</b> and NBMA <b>subnetwork</b> <b>addresses</b> of the "NBMA next hop " towards a destination station. If the destination is connected to the NBMA subnetwork, then the NBMA next hop is the destination station itself. Otherwise, the NBMA next hop is the egress router from the NBMA subnetwork that is "nearest " to the destination station. NHRP is intended for use in a multiprotocol internetworking layer environment over NBMA subnetworks. Note that while this protocol was developed for use with NBMA subnetworks, it is possible, if not likely, that it will be applied to BMA subnetworks as well. However, this usage of NHRP is for further study. This document is intended to be a functional superset of the NBMA Address Resolution Protocol (NARP) documented in [1]. Luciani, et. al.

40|$|Data mining {{practitioners}} are facing challenges from data with network structure. In this paper, we address a specific class of global-state networks which comprises {{of a set}} of network instances sharing a similar structure yet having different values at local nodes. Each instance is associated with a global state which indicates the occurrence of an event. The objective is to uncover a small set of discriminative subnetworks that can optimally classify global network values. Unlike most existing studies which explore an exponential <b>subnetwork</b> space, we <b>address</b> this difficult problem by adopting a space transformation approach. Specifically, we present an algorithm that optimizes a constrained dual-objective function to learn a low-dimensional subspace that is capable of discriminating networks labelled by different global states, while reconciling with common network topology sharing across instances. Our algorithm takes an appealing approach from spectral graph learning and we show that the globally optimum solution can be achieved via matrix eigen-decomposition.

40|$|Abstract—In Symmetric Multiprocessors (SMPs), {{the cache}} {{coherence}} overhead {{and the speed}} of the shared buses limit the address/ snoop bandwidth needed to broadcast transactions to all processors. As a solution, a scalable <b>address</b> <b>subnetwork</b> called Symmetric Multiprocessor Network (SYMNET) is proposed in which address requests and snoop responses of SMPs are implemented optically. SYMNET not only uses passive optical interconnects that increases {{the speed of the}} proposed network, but also pipelines address requests at a much faster rate than electronics. This increases the address bandwidth for snooping, but the preservation of cache coherence can no longer be maintained with the usual snooping protocols. A modified coherence protocol, Coherence in SYMNET (COSYM), is introduced to solve the coherence problem. COSYM was evaluated with a subset of Splash- 2 benchmarks and compared with the electrical bus-based MOESI protocol. The simulation studies have shown a 5 - 66 percent improvement in execution time for COSYM as compared to MOESI for various applications. Simulations have also shown that the average latency for a transaction to complete using COSYM protocol was 5 - 78 percent better than the MOESI protocol. It is also seen that SYMNET can scale up to hundreds of processors while still using fast snooping-based cache coherence protocols, and additional performance gains may be attained with further improvement in optical device technology. Index Terms—SMPs, parallel optical interconnects, cache coherence, scalable optical networks. ...|$|R
