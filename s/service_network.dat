40|$|Abstract. Despite {{the rapid}} {{development}} in web services technologies, {{there has been}} little study on the public web <b>services</b> from <b>network</b> analysis perspective. To address this, in this paper, we have performed a topological study on various web <b>service</b> <b>networks</b> using real-world data sets. We first propose a flexible framework by which we can study semantic web <b>services</b> <b>network</b> “matchmaking ” in a unified manner. Under the matching framework, then, we have conducted extensive experiments to study the characteristics of various web <b>services</b> <b>networks.</b> By and large, publicly available web <b>services</b> <b>networks</b> exhibit the typical characteristics of small world networks well and power law like distributions to some extent. ...|$|R

The train leaves Paris from the Gare d'Austerlitz in mid evening and arrives in Nice about 8 in the morning, providing both first-class rooms and couchette accommodations. The train's principal popularity is with older travelers; it has not won {{the same degree of}} popularity with younger travelers. Recently, the upper class coaches (wagons lits) have been sold to foreign railroad companies, so that only couchette cars (1st and 2nd class) as well as seating coaches remain.

40|$|Abstract: Services are quintessential in {{the current}} {{economical}} landscape. Enterprises and businesses at large rely on the consumption and providing of services to ensure their operations and to realize their business offers. That is, nowadays businesses {{all over the world}} are interconnected with each other by complex service-centric webs called <b>service</b> <b>networks.</b> The ubiquity and pervasiveness of <b>service</b> <b>networks</b> call for models, methods, mechanisms and tools to understand them and harness their potential. This paper investigates the modelling of the <b>service</b> <b>networks</b> with a focus on business relationships and exchanges of software services among the involved parties. The contribution of this work is threefold. Firstly, we provide an overview of what <b>service</b> <b>networks</b> modelling can offer in combination with Business Process Management (BPM) and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) technologies. Secondly, we propose a formalism to model <b>service</b> <b>networks</b> that depicts them as aggregations of participants – e. g. enterprises or individuals – that offer, request, consume and provide services to each other. With the goal of providing a foundation for the alignment between service network- and business process models, we finally map the constructs of our <b>service</b> <b>networks</b> modelling formalism to the ones of the Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN) ...|$|R

25|$|By {{the time}} of its 20th anniversary on 14 April 1968, British Eagle ranked fourth among the five major {{contemporary}} UK airlines (behind BEA, BOAC and BUA, and ahead of Caledonian). The airline's 24 aircraft included eight jets, six of which had been acquired direct from their manufacturers. These included a Boeing 707-365C leased out to MEA and five BAC One-Eleven 300 series. Kleinwort Benson were the owners of the 707-365C and two second-hand -138Bs that had been acquired from Qantas, while Kuwait Finance Agency, the overseas investment arm of the Kuwait government, and British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) respectively owned three and two of the five One-Elevens. British Eagle operated all of these aircraft under lease purchase agreements with the owners. By that time, the company's scheduled <b>service</b> <b>network</b> included routes from London Heathrow to Liverpool, Glasgow, Newquay, Luxembourg, Dinard, La Baule, Lourdes, Perpignan, Gerona, Palma de Mallorca, Ibiza, Pisa, Rimini, Stuttgart, Innsbruck, Djerba and Tunis.

2500|$|On 19 November 2007, it was {{revealed}} that a localised Australian series of Top Gear would be produced by the Special Broadcasting <b>Service</b> <b>network</b> in conjunction with Freehand Productions, BBC Worldwide's Australasian partner. This announcement marks the first time a deal has been struck for a version of Top Gear to be produced exclusively for a foreign market. No indication was given as to the exact makeup of the series, other than that it would have a distinctly Australian style. SBS ran a competition to find hosts for the series, and in May 2008 confirmed that the presenters for the Australian programme were to be Charlie Cox, Warren Brown, Steve Pizzati and a local 'cousin' of The Stig. James Morrison replaced Charlie for the second series of Top Gear Australia. Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson added, [...] "I'm delighted that Top Gear is going to Australia." [...] It was announced that the Nine Network had secured the rights to the local and UK versions from 2010 on both its Nine and Go! (digital TV) stations. On 20 June 2010, it was announced that actor and comedian Shane Jacobson and Top Gear Australia magazine editor Ewen Page would join a returning Steve Pizzati to present the programme which premiered on 28 September 2010. The Australian version has received lacklustre reviews. Eventually, Top Gear UK and Top Gear Australia met up and challenged each other. Top Gear Australia was cancelled in September 2011.|$|E
