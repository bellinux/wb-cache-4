5000|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>manganate</b> is the {{inorganic}} compound with the formula Na2MnO4. This deep green solid is a rarely encountered analogue of the related salt K2MnO4. <b>Sodium</b> <b>manganate</b> is rarely encountered because it cannot be readily prepared from the oxidation of manganese dioxide and sodium hydroxide. Instead this oxidation {{stops at the}} level of Na3MnO4, and this Mn(V) salt is unstable in solution. [...] <b>Sodium</b> <b>manganate</b> can be produced by reduction of sodium permanganate under basic conditions: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{procedure}} {{is analogous to}} the preparation oxidation of manganese dioxide in alkali to give <b>sodium</b> <b>manganate.</b>|$|E

Novel Na 2 / 3 Mn 1 −yFeyO 2 (y = 0, 1 / 3 and 2 / 3) compounds with a P′ 3 -type structure are prepared from freeze-dried citrate precursors at 500 °C. A new structural element {{is the development of}} three-layer oxygen stacking contrary to the well-known P 2 -type Na 2 / 3 MnO 2 with a two-layer sequence. The effect of Fe additives on the structure of Na 2 / 3 MnO 2 was examined by XRD powder diffraction and TEM analysis. The oxidation state and the distribution of transition metal ions in Na 2 / 3 Mn 1 −yFeyO 2 were analysed using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The lithium intercalation in Na 2 / 3 Mn 1 −yFeyO 2 was investigated in two-electrode lithium cells of the type Li|LiPF 6 (EC:DMC) |Na 2 / 3 Mn 1 −yFeyO 2. The stability of the layered phases during lithium intercalation was studied by ex situ Raman spectroscopy. It was found that the intermediate Na 2 / 3 Mn 2 / 3 Fe 1 / 3 O 2 composition is able to intercalate Li+ reversibly in high amounts. Details of the structure and its stability during the Li+ intercalation are discussed...|$|R
5|$|The {{oxidation}} state +5 {{can be produced}} by dissolving manganese dioxide in molten <b>sodium</b> nitrite. <b>Manganate</b> (VI) salts can be produced by dissolving Mn compounds, such as manganese dioxide, in molten alkali while exposed to air. Permanganate (+7 {{oxidation state}}) compounds are purple, and can give glass a violet color. Potassium permanganate, sodium permanganate, and barium permanganate are all potent oxidizers. Potassium permanganate, also called Condy's crystals, is a commonly used laboratory reagent because of its oxidizing properties; it {{is used as a}} topical medicine (for example, in the treatment of fish diseases). Solutions of potassium permanganate were among the first stains and fixatives {{to be used in the}} preparation of biological cells and tissues for electron microscopy.|$|R
40|$|Extending the {{recently}} introduced concept of alkali-metal-mediated manganation to functionalised arenes, the heteroleptic <b>sodium</b> <b>manganate</b> reagent [(tmeda) Na(tmp) (R) Mn(tmp) ] (1; TMEDA=N,N,N,N-tetramethylethylenediamine, TMP= 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidide, R=CH 2 SiMe 3) {{has been treated}} with anisole or N,N-diisopropylbenzamide in a 1 : 1 stoichiometry in hexane. These reactions afforded the crystalline products [(tmeda) Na(tmp) (o-C 6 H 4 OMe) Mn(tmp) ] (2) and [(tmeda) Na(tmp) {o-{C(O) N(iPr) 2 C 6 H 4 }Mn(CH 2 SiMe 3) ] (3), respectively, as determined from X-ray crystallographic studies. On {{the basis of these}} products, it can be surmised that reagent 1 has acted, at least partially and ultimately, as an alkyl base in the first reaction liberating the silane Me 4 Si, but as an amido base in the second reaction liberating the amine TMPH. Both of these paramagnetic products 2 and 3 have contacted ion-pair structures, the key features of which are six-atom, five-element (NaNMnCCO) and seven-atom, five-element (NaNMnCCCO) rings, respectively. Manganates 2 and 3 were successfully cross-coupled with iodobenzene under [PdCl 2 (dppf) ] (dppf= 1, 1 -bis(diphenylphosphino) ferrocene) catalysis to generate unsymmetrical biaryl compounds in yields of 98. 0 and 66. 2 %, respectively. Emphasizing the importance of alkali-metal mediation in these manganation reactions, the bisalkyl Mn reagent on its own fails to metalate the said benzamide, but instead produces the monomeric, donor-acceptor complex [Mn(R) 2 {(iPr) 2 NC(Ph) (O) } 2] (5), which has also been crystallographically characterised. During one attempt to repeat the synthesis of 2, the butoxide-contaminated complex [{(tmeda) Na(R) (OBu) (o-C 6 H 4 OMe) Mn} 2] (6) was obtained. In contrast to 2 and 3, due to reduced steric constraints, this complex adopts a dimeric arrangement in the crystal, the centrepiece of which is a twelve atom (NaOCCMnC) 2 ring...|$|E
