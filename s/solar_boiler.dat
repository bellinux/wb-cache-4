40|$|In {{context of}} rising demand for energy amidst limited resources, energy {{efficiency}} {{is one of}} the major concerns of a modernized world. Gas consumption in the built environment constitutes for more than 30 % of the overall energy consumption in the world. Hence, energy transitions and their preferences in the built environment demand urgent attention by policy makers in order to implement cost-effective and long-term sustainable policies. However, the highly dynamic nature of decision making adopted by households involves complex interaction between various factors. Therefore, in this study, a modified Bass diffusion structure was used in a System Dynamics model to examine energy transitions and subsequent reductions in overall gas consumption in the built environment of Netherlands.

40|$|This {{document}} {{provides a}} case study of policies aiming to foster technological innovations for ‘green’ buildings in the Netherlands. The study aims to provide 1) a detailed overview of the policy framework over the last thirty years, and 2) a picture of the level of innovations related to energy efficiency in buildings in the Netherlands. �The analysis shows an intensification of environmental policy in the Dutch building sector in the mid- 1990 s, followed by a slight decline after 2001. A striking feature of environmental policy in this sector is the large number of policy programs implemented successively for short periods of time. This might affect the stability and continuity of the policy framework and be damaging for innovation. Faced with high levels of uncertainty about future policies, firms may prefer to postpone risky investments in innovative activities. Finally, governmental R&D support for green innovations in general remains very low in the Netherlands. Descriptive data on patenting activities show that Dutch firms file nowadays about 150 patents annually in the field of energy efficiency in buildings. The Netherlands have a clear comparative advantage in the field of energy-saving lighting technologies, mainly due to intensive patenting activities by Philips. High-efficiency boilers also represent a substantial share of Dutch innovation activities in this domain over the last decades. In many other fields (such as insulation, heat-pumps and co-generation, <b>solar</b> <b>boilers,</b> etc), however, Germany, Austria and Scandinavian countries rank much higher than the Netherlands. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} a novel type of high {{temperature}} solar collector is designed: the rotating <b>solar</b> <b>boiler.</b> This rotating <b>solar</b> <b>boiler</b> {{consists of two}} concentric tubes. The inner tube, called absorber, absorbs sunlight and boils water. The outer transparent tube, called cover, is filled with air. The boiler rotates to completely prevent convection in the insulating air layer in between the tubes. In this way, the heat loss is reduced considerably resulting in a solar collector that is more efficient than conventional flat plate solar collectors. The prototype built measured 1. 20 m length and 0. 50 m diameter (illuminated area is 0. 60 m 2) for the copper absorber with high performance sputtered coating. The cover with a diameter of 0. 90 m was made of transparent polyvinylchloride film. The rotation speed was 60 rpm. The efficiency was 61 % and the boiler delivered 0. 34 kW of 100 °C steam at an ambient temperature of 7 °C. A model was developed to predict {{the performance of the}} prototype.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{dynamics}} of sustainable construction development in the Netherlands {{and in particular the}} development of the <b>solar</b> <b>boiler</b> in the period 1990 to 2006. The sustainable construction sector has been developed in the past decades and the <b>solar</b> <b>boiler</b> can serve as an indicator for similar technologies to be applied in order to improve energy efficiency in the Dutch construction sector. The focus of this thesis narrows down to the case of <b>solar</b> <b>boiler</b> technology. In order to analyze the dynamics in the technology development, the functions of innovation systems approach is used, which offers a unique perspective on the dynamical component of Technological Innovation Systems (TIS) by focusing on the events that compose the system. The approach is applied in multiple sustainable technology research and resulted in a validated method. This study also serves to strengthen the application knowledge of this method. The main research question of this thesis is “What is the functional development of the technological innovation system of the <b>solar</b> <b>boiler</b> in the Dutch construction sector and how does this dynamic affect the performance of the system. ” In order to answer this research question, the TIS is mapped and the historical dynamics are constructed by means of collecting ‘events’, retrieved from news articles on the <b>solar</b> <b>boiler</b> in the Netherlands. This results in an historical narrative of the development of the <b>solar</b> <b>boiler</b> from 1990 to 2006. The functional dynamics are derived by matching these events to 7 predetermined functions by means of event typology. The resulting functional dynamics provide insight on the development of these seven functions, which are vital for a well functioning technological system. Finally, functional interrelations are examined by extracting the key events and analyze their causality. The analysis results in a determining of three periods of development of market growth from 1990 to 1999, where actors entered the market, financial incentives were present and agreements between actors provided a growth tendency {{in the development of the}} <b>solar</b> <b>boiler</b> system. This was followed by the period 2000 - 2001 of market stabilization due to lack of further unambiguous regulation. The period of 2002 - 2006 was characterized by declining market activities due to lack in financial incentives and market development stimulation. The analysis reveals that large scale projects are important to provide a stimulant to the application of the <b>solar</b> <b>boiler.</b> New construction projects like VINEX projects offer a good possibility to increase market volume, attract new actors and set institutional advantages to the new technology. Also subsidy programs in combination with strong advocacy coalitions can provide a good incentive for market organizations to generate, diffuse and apply the technology. Actors like SenterNovem, branch organizations like HollandSolar and (local governments) need to form strong intentions in order to start the new market. To be able to address the housing construction market effectively the government or intermediaries like SenterNovem need to incorporate large scale actors like housing corporations and project developers in order to generate enough volume for effective benefits. This needs to be supported with market development incentives like Green Mortgages, the VAMIL, clear standardization in for example the EPC in order to create a attractive market. In order to create a market driven technological innovation system, the market needs to contain enough stimulants in institutions like these and the initial development of the technology will develop into a self stimulating system that meets the policy targets of energy efficiency. The market will bring new technology solutions and application when these conditions are met. These conclusions can be drawn from an analysis with the Innovation Systems Functions Approach. These dynamical developments affect the performance of the system in such a way, that it has developed till now. The answer to the research question is that resource mobilization, advocacy coalitions and market development activities like regulations and standardization need to be stimulated for the system to successfully develop into a self sustaining mature system. The combination of these function developments can act as a stimulant when effectively pursued, but also as hampering when not. This provides us with information for further measures to stimulate the development of the <b>solar</b> <b>boiler,</b> such as addressing large actors like housing corporations and project developers with financial incentives and forming agreements. Also measures like stricter regulation and standardization to create market advantages for the <b>solar</b> <b>boiler</b> or mandatory EPA or energy labeling will be effective measures to stimulate <b>solar</b> <b>boiler</b> development. This can possibly also apply for similar technologies in the sustainable construction sector such as heat pumps, PV systems or combined heat and power systems, since the underlying dynamical effect is caused by a lot of similar processes as those of the <b>solar</b> <b>boiler...</b>|$|E

40|$|In the Netherlands {{where the}} {{building}} sector accounts for 33 % of carbon emissions, the government aims to halve the total energy use from buildings by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. To this end, the Dutch government has set specific goals {{in order to}} foster technological innovation related to energy efficiency in buildings. The objective {{of this paper is}} to explore the links between technological innovation and public policies in this sector over the last 30 years. The paper aims (1) to measure the evolution of innovations related to energy efficiency in buildings in the Netherlands using patent counts and (2) to provide a historical overview of the policy framework. Descriptive data on patenting activities show that the Netherlands have a clear comparative advantage in the field of energy-saving lighting technologies, mainly due to intensive patenting activities by Philips. High-efficiency boilers also represent a substantial share of Dutch innovation activities in this domain over the last decades. In many other fields (such as insulation, heat-pumps and cogeneration, <b>solar</b> <b>boilers,</b> etc.), however, Germany, Austria and Scandinavian countries rank much higher than the Netherlands. The descriptive analysis of Dutch energy policy shows an intensification of energy policy in the mid- 1990 s, followed by a slight decline after 2001. Overall, the simultaneous introduction of policy instruments makes it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of policies. Also, the policy framework is characterized by the introduction of a large number of short-lived policy instruments and frequent policy changes. The lack of stability and continuity of energy policy may be damaging for innovation. Innovations Buildings Energy policy...|$|R

Later on we will explain the main topics to discuss it and try to work with them. The first topic of the project consists of the study of the heat transfer between the house and the external environment and the heat transfer between the rooms of the house as well. The walls of the house will be studied. Every wall hasn’t the same seriousness inside the house, so, we will try to study and find the best options to improve the insulation system of the house in Kollum. The house in Kollum has a roof full of solar panels (photovoltaic panels). As it is said in the beginning, the house is supposed to produce the whole amount of energy consumed but, {{if you take a look}} into the energy produced by the solar panels, you can realize that it’s possible to take advantage of the solar panels to produce more energy or simply waste less money.
