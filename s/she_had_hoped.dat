5|$|A {{document}} from 25 March contains her {{note that}} joining the uprising was her sole idea, and that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> {{that such a}} moment would come her entire life. She cut her hair, prepared a uniform for herself and organized and equipped a group of volunteers, speaking passionately after a mass on 29 March. On 4 April she signed a declaratory document marking her access to the local uprising forces. Her unit was composed of roughly 280 infantry, 60 cavalry and several hundred peasants armed with war scythes.|$|E
5|$|Izzie {{was created}} by Grey's Anatomy {{producer}} Shonda Rhimes, with actress Katherine Heigl cast in the role. Heigl originally wanted to play Izzie as a brunette, but was requested to retain her natural blond for the part. Heigl's comprehension of medical procedures and terminology is slight; the actress explained that while she has an admiration for doctors, she is not as fascinated by medicine as other cast members. When Kate Walsh's character Addison Montgomery left Grey's Anatomy to launch the spin-off show Private Practice, Heigl disclosed that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> for a spin-off for Izzie.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} days of the campaign, Douglas finally began to receive some of the support <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> for. Boddy's paper {{endorsed}} her, while Truman praised her. Douglas's actor husband, Melvyn Douglas, on tour with the play Two Blind Mice throughout the campaign, spoke out on behalf of his wife, as did movie stars Myrna Loy and Eddie Cantor. Nixon had several Hollywood personalities supporting him, including Howard Hughes, Cecil B. DeMille and John Wayne. Another actor, Ronald Reagan, was among Douglas's supporters, but when his girlfriend and future wife Nancy Davis took him to a pro-Nixon rally led by actress ZaSu Pitts, he was converted to Nixon's cause and led quiet fundraising for him. Douglas was apparently unaware of this—30years later she mentioned Reagan in her memoirs as someone who worked hard for her.|$|E

25|$|In November 2008, Odetta's health {{began to}} decline and she began {{receiving}} treatment at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> to perform at Barack Obama's inauguration on January 20, 2009, but she died, of heart disease, on December 2, 2008, in New York City.|$|E
25|$|When Kim {{returned}} to Seoul, Queen Min took {{special interest in}} Huang's book and commissioned copies be sent out to all the ministers. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> to win yangban approval to invite Western nations into Korea, to open up trade with and keep Japan in check.

25|$|Arthur's {{corruption}} {{of their son}} — encouraging him to drink and swear at his tender age — is the last straw for Helen. She plans to flee to save her son, but her husband learns of her plans from her diary and burns the artist's tools with which <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> to support herself. Eventually, with help from her brother, Mr Lawrence, Helen finds a secret refuge at Wildfell Hall.|$|E
50|$|A {{hamstring}} injury prevented Worley {{from taking}} part in further competition in 2006.

25|$|As a {{nurse in}} a {{hospital}} ward, Lavinia speaks to wounded soldiers and prisoners of war in Washington, specifically asking about her brother, Isaac, who was imprisoned for assaulting a fellow government official. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> that they had seen or heard from him {{while they were in}} the prison camps. The Washington officials ignore her plea to free Isaac. Lavinia is only able to speak to the president on Isaac's behalf because of the intervention of a man, Dr. Norval's friend, Mr. Sinclair. Lavinia then realizes that her belief in being able to voice her opinions equally with men is unrealistic.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, Gandhi {{accepted}} {{the demands of}} the Akali's to reorganize Punjab on linguistic lines. The Hindi-speaking southern half of Punjab became a separate state, Haryana, while the Pahari speaking hilly areas in the north east were joined to Himachal Pradesh. In doing so, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> to ward off the growing political conflict between Hindu and Sikh groups in the region. However, a contentious issue that was considered unresolved by the Akali's was the status of Chandigarh, a prosperous city on the Punjab-Haryana border, which Gandhi declared a union territory to be shared as a capital by both the states.|$|E
25|$|In 1939, {{she and her}} son {{returned}} to Moscow, unaware of the reception she would receive. In Stalin's USSR, anyone who had lived abroad was suspect, as was anyone who had been among the intelligentsia before the Revolution. Tsvetaeva's sister had been arrested before Tsvetaeva's return; although Anastasia survived the Stalin years, the sisters never saw each other again. Tsvetaeva found that all doors had closed to her. She got bits of work translating poetry, but otherwise the established Soviet writers refused to help her, and chose to ignore her plight; Nikolai Aseev, who <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> would assist, shied away, fearful for his life and position.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} pursue more {{employment}} opportunities, Colbert and her family, including Marie and Emilie Loew, emigrated to Manhattan in 1906. They {{lived in a}} fifth-floor walk-up at 53rd Street. Colbert stated that climbing those stairs to the fifth floor every day until 1922 made her legs beautiful. Her parents formally changed her legal name to Lily Claudette Chauchoin. Georges Chauchoin worked as a minor official at First National City Bank. Before Colbert entered public school, she quickly learned English from her grandmother Marie Loew and remained fluent in French. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> to become a painter ever since she had grasped her first pencil. Her family was naturalized in the U.S. in 1912. Her mother wanted to become an opera singer. After all, Jeanne joined two silent films Journey's End (1918) and The Poison Pen (1919) in supporting roles as Jeanne Loew.|$|E
25|$|Corinna {{breaks down}} and {{admits that she}} is unable to cope with their rebellious {{daughter}} and agrees that Jerome can look after her – especially as Nan/Zoe has had such an immediate impact. Eventually she confesses that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> this meeting {{would lead to a}} reconciliation between her and Jerome. Jerome is delighted by this and tells Corinna that Nan/Zoe is only an actress. Corinna is hurt by the deception and calls Geain from the bedroom so that they can leave. Geain reveals that her discovery that Nan/Zoe is actually an android – but she likes her and wants to stay with her. Under Mervyn's questioning Jerome explains that Nan/Zoe is a NAN 300F. Mervyn explains that the company which made them went out of business following a tragic incident with a baby. Jerome argues in defence of Nan/Zoe but Mervyn and Corinna try to separate her from Geain. Geain doesn't want to be separated. Nan/Zoe mistakes Mervyn for a child molester and knocks him unconscious for a while.|$|E

Five years after Korby's disappearance, Chapel {{was assigned to the}} USS Enterprise, under the command of Captain James T. Kirk. She served as head nurse, working under Dr. McCoy (DeForest Kelley).|$|E

He would not think the worse of her for it. And <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>hope,</b> yes, Geoffrey <b>had</b> taught her to hope. If there was a Hell, why it was here.

500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s Brooks became {{increasingly}} reclusive and paranoid; she sank into a depression {{and refused to}} see the doctors Barney sent. [...] Bitter at Lahovary's presence during their last years, which <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> they would spend exclusively together, she finally broke off contact with Barney. [...] Barney continued to write to her, but received no replies. [...] Brooks died in December 1970, and Barney on February 2, 1972 of heart failure. They are both buried at Passy Cemetery, Paris, Île-de-France, France.|$|E
500|$|Within days of {{completing}} {{her work in}} Gone with the Wind in June 1939, deHavilland returned to Warner Bros. and began filming Michael Curtiz's historical drama The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex with Bette Davis and Errol Flynn. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> her work on Selznick's prestige picture would lead to first-rate roles at Warner Bros., but instead she received third billing below the title as the queen's lady-in-waiting. In early September, she was lent out to Samuel Goldwyn Productions for Sam Wood's romantic caper film Raffles with David Niven, about a high-society cricketer and jewel thief. She later complained, [...] "I {{had nothing to do}} with that style of film." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Gibbs and Vance order McGee to hack {{into the}} Mossad database, {{discovering}} that all five operatives Elbaz had claimed were rogue are still listed as active members and that Mantel {{was the only}} traitor. When confronted, Elbaz at first deflects, but when informed that [...] "Bodnar" [...] has been arrested in Berlin, admits that she had believed that he never left the United States. Realizing shortly {{after that it is}} Yaniv who is in custody, she explains that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> that the other agencies' search in Rome would cause Ilan to let his guard down. Vance and Homeland Senior Division Chief Tom Morrow (Alan Dale), while angry about her deception, decide to look the other way.|$|E

5000|$|Bennett's {{father was}} a lawyer, and {{at an early age}} <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>hopes</b> of {{following}} him into the legal profession. Her father, however, thought that law was a bad career choice for women, because [...] "you had to be better than the best to break even" [...] and discouraged his daughter from pursuing this ambition. Instead, Bennett studied science at the University of Sydney and completed a Ph.D. in Biochemistry at the same institution.|$|R
500|$|Another {{guest on}} the Marala was Cilla Black, singer {{and a friend}} to the Beatles since the 1960s, who recalls Starr and Harrison playing [...] "Photograph" [...] during an evening get-together, with [...] "everyone on board" [...] {{contributing}} ideas for the lyrics. As with Starr's two singles over 1971–72, [...] "It Don't Come Easy" [...] and [...] "Back Off Boogaloo", Harrison helped write the melody, although [...] "Photograph" [...] would mark {{the first time that}} he was credited as a co-writer with Starr. In her autobiography, Step Inside Love, Black says <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> to record the song for a single later in 1971, only to be told by Starr: [...] "No, it's too bloody good for you. I'm having it myself." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite this success, the Shaughnessy {{connection}} {{was not the}} breakthrough <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> for. Schuur failed to impress bandleader Doc Severinsen, who turned her down when she auditioned for a guest spot on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show. Some {{people in the industry}} dubbed her [...] "Lady Overkill" [...] because she had a tendency to oversing or tried to put everything she knew into a brief space. For the next three years, Shuur performed in clubs and sharpened her skills. Jazz saxophonist Stan Getz, who had been impressed when he heard her sing [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] at Monterey in 1979, did not give up on her. He became her advisor and coach. Discussing Getz in this role, Schuur stated, [...] "he really was a mentor of mine. He taught me that less is more." ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna's 1986 studio album True Blue was a {{critical}} and commercial success, spawning five top-five singles, and selling over eight million copies worldwide, by the year-end. However, her film career was not as successful as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> it would be. Following the commercially successful Desperately Seeking Susan, her 1986 film Shanghai Surprise—where she starred with her then husband Sean Penn—was {{a critical}} and box-office failure, prompting Madonna to comment that she [...] "struggled {{to come to terms}} with her character in Shanghai Surprise, because the innocence and repressed personality I was required to portray was so at variance with my own character." [...] Continuing to struggle with her film career, Madonna was unsure of her ability to choose a good script, and film producers were less sure about backing her up.|$|E
50|$|In 1942, Weil {{traveled}} to the United States of America with her family. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> been reluctant to leave France, but agreed to do so as {{she wanted to see}} her parents to safety and knew they would not leave without her.
