An excess of silyl chloride can be employed but is not necessary. If excess reagent is used, the product will require flash chromatography to remove excess <b>silanol</b> and siloxane. Silyl triflates are water sensitive and must be run under inert atmosphere conditions. Purification involves the addition of an aqueous acid such as saturated ammonium chloride solution. This quenches remaining silyl reagent and protonates amine bases, removing them from the reaction mixture. Following extraction, the product can be purified by flash chromatography.|$|E
25|$|On-Bead Ligand Binding assays are {{isolation}} {{methods for}} basic proteins, DNA/RNA or other biomolecules located in undefined suspensions {{and can be}} used in multiple biochromatographic applications. Bioaffine ligands are covalently bound to silica beads with terminal negatively charged <b>silanol</b> groups or polystyrene beads and are used for isolation and purification of basic proteins or adsorption of biomolecules. After binding the separation is performed by centrifugation (density separation) or by magnetic field attraction (for magnetic particles only). The beads can be washed to provide purity of the isolated molecule before dissolving it by ion exchange methods. Direct analyzation methods based on enzymatic/fluorescent detection (e.g. HRP, fluorescent dye) can be used for on-bead determination or quantification of bound biomolecules.|$|E
2500|$|Electroosmotic flow is {{observed}} when an electric field {{is applied to}} a solution in a capillary that has fixed charges on its interior wall. [...] Charge is accumulated on the inner surface of a capillary when a buffer solution is placed inside the capillary. [...] In a fused-silica capillary, <b>silanol</b> (Si-OH) groups attached to the interior wall of the capillary are ionized to negatively charged silanoate (Si-O−) groups at pH values greater than three. [...] The ionization of the capillary wall can be enhanced by first running a basic solution, such as NaOH or KOH through the capillary prior to introducing the buffer solution. Attracted to the negatively charged silanoate groups, the positively charged cations of the buffer solution will form two inner layers of cations (called the diffuse double layer or the electrical double layer) on the capillary wall {{as shown in figure}} 4. [...] The first layer {{is referred to as the}} fixed layer because it is held tightly to the silanoate groups. [...] The outer layer, called the mobile layer, is farther from the silanoate groups. [...] The mobile cation layer is pulled in the direction of the negatively charged cathode when an electric field is applied. [...] Since these cations are solvated, the bulk buffer solution migrates with the mobile layer, causing the electroosmotic flow of the buffer solution. Other capillaries including Teflon capillaries also exhibit electroosmotic flow. [...] The EOF of these capillaries is probably the result of adsorption of the electrically charged ions of the buffer onto the capillary walls. The rate of EOF is dependent on the field strength and the charge density of the capillary wall. [...] The wall's charge density is proportional to the pH of the buffer solution. [...] The electroosmotic flow will increase with pH until all of the available silanols lining the wall of the capillary are fully ionized.|$|E
40|$|The drug {{metoclopramide}} {{was found}} to adsorb to the unionized and ionized silica surface. The primary objective {{of this research was}} to use potentiometric titration in order to study the specificity of the interactions of benzamide analogs with the hydroxyl groups, <b>silanols,</b> on the Aeroperl® silica surface. Mass titration studies showed that the acidity of surface <b>silanols</b> increases with dissolved metoclopramide and similar compounds. The nature of the interaction was concluded to involve a physical adsorption process. A different potentiometric titration method was devised to determine the ionization of <b>silanols</b> {{in the presence of a}} dissolved compound with solubility limitations. This method {{was found to}} give similar results as that described in the literature. The presence of dissolved metoclopramide was found to cause a large increase in the density of the negatively charged <b>silanols</b> on the silica surface. The ionization of silica was dependent on the concentration of dissolved metoclopramide at low pH but was found to be constant over a wide concentration range at pH 7. 0 or higher. Adsorption studies with unionized silica indicated that specific interactions with the surface <b>silanols</b> occur as well as non-specific interactions driven by hydrophobic bonding with the surface siloxane groups. There was an increase in the adsorption of metoclopramide with increasing ionization of the silica surface which suggested that the negatively charged <b>silanols</b> constituted an additional adsorption site. The mechanism of the interaction was elucidated by potentiometric titration with various probe compounds. The titration data with lidocaine suggested that the ionization of the surface <b>silanols</b> is influenced by specific interactions with the adsorbed compound rather than concentration effects. The ionized site density of silica was found to be related to the relative magnitude of the aromatic π-electron density of the adsorbed benzamides. A comparison of these titration data with that of triethylamine indicated that ionic interactions between the positively charged amine groups and the negatively charged <b>silanols</b> are likely to be occurring. Based on the difference in chemical structure, the titration data with dissolved ephedrine indicated that the other site of interaction is likely to be between the carbonyl oxygen of the adsorbed benzamides and the unionized <b>silanols.</b> The pH dependence of the ionization of <b>silanols</b> for both adsorption sites suggested that <b>silanols</b> interact simultaneously with several functional groups on a single adsorbed molecule...|$|R

2500|$|One of {{the most}} useful silicon-containing groups is trimethylsilyl, Me3Si–. The Si–C bond {{connecting}} it {{to the rest of}} the molecule is reasonably strong, allowing it to remain while the rest of the molecule undergoes reactions, but is not so strong that it cannot be removed specifically when needed, for example by the fluoride ion, which is a very weak nucleophile for carbon compounds but a very strong one for organosilicon compounds. It may be compared to acidic protons; while trisilylmethyl is removed by hard nucleophiles instead of bases, both removals usually promote elimination. As a general rule, while saturated carbon is best attacked by nucleophiles that are neutral compounds, those based on nonmetals far down on the periodic table (e.g. sulfur, selenium, or iodine), or even both, silicon is best attacked by charged nucleophiles, particularly those involving such highly electronegative nonmetals as oxygen, fluorine, or chlorine. For example, enolates react at the carbon in haloalkanes, but at the oxygen in silyl chlorides; and when trimethylsilyl is removed from an organic molecule using hydroxide as a nucleophile, the product of the reaction is not the <b>silanol</b> as one would expect from using carbon chemistry as an analogy, because the siloxide is strongly nucleophilic and attacks the original molecule to yield the silyl ether hexamethyldisiloxane, (Me3Si)2O. Conversely, while the SN2 reaction is mostly unaffected by the presence of a partial positive charge (δ+) at the carbon, the analogous [...] "SN2" [...] reaction at silicon is so affected. Thus, for example, the silyl triflates are so electrophilic that they react 108 to 109 times faster than silyl chlorides with oxygen-containing nucleophiles. Trimethylsilyl triflate is in particular a very good Lewis acid and is used to convert carbonyl compounds to acetals and silyl enol ethers, reacting them together analogously to the aldol reaction.|$|E

The resultant materials {{were characterized by}} using thermogravimetry (TG), H- 1 magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (H- 1 MAS NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and chemical analysis. The degree of silylation was found to increase with the increasing temperature of thermal pretreatment on diatomaceous silica prior to silylation. Increment of the pretreated temperature leads to stepwise removal of physisorbed water followed by the dehydration of capping water that H-bonded with the surface <b>silanols,</b> resulting in exposure of more and more isolated and H-bonded <b>silanols</b> previously covered by water molecules. Among these exposed <b>silanols,</b> isolated <b>silanols</b> show high activity for silylation reaction but H-bonded ones show poor activity. The maximum degree of surface attachment of TMCS grafted onto the diatomaceous silica (about 1. 81 mmol TMCS groups per gram of silica) was shown in the sample pretreated at 1100 degrees C, in which the amount of exposed isolated <b>silanols</b> get the maximum. The fundamental information derived from this work is of significance in well understanding the surface silylation reaction of diatomaceous silica and providing useful information for related industrial production.

50|$|Mica {{is another}} {{silicate}} that {{is widely used}} as substrate for the deposition of biomolecules. Mica bears a noticeable advantage over silicon because it is molecularly smooth and hence better suited for studies of small, flat molecules. It has a crystalline structure with generic formula KSi3AlO10Al2(OH)2 and contains sheets of octahedral hydroxyl-aluminum sandwiched between two silicon tetrahedral layers. In the silicon layer, one in four silicon atoms is replaced by an aluminum atom, generating a difference in charge that is offset by unbound K+ present in the region between neighboring silicon layers. Muscovite mica is most susceptible to cleavage along the plane located in the potassium layer. When a freshly cleaved mica surface is placed in contact with water, hydrated potassium ions can desorb from the mica surface, leading to a negative charge at the surface. Similar to silicon, the surface of mica does not contain an appreciable density of <b>silanol</b> groups for covalent attachment by silanes. A recent study reported that freshly cleaved mica carries 11% <b>silanol</b> groups, i.e., approximately 1 in 10 silicon atoms bears a hydroxyl group). Although {{it is possible that}} silanization may be carried out using untreated mica, the increased density of surface <b>silanol</b> groups on activated mica can significantly improve covalent attachment of silane molecules to the surface. Mica can be activated by treatment with argon/water plasma, leading to a <b>silanol</b> surface density of 30%. Working with activated surfaces introduces another consideration about the stability of the <b>silanol</b> groups on the activated surfaces. Giasson et al. reported that the <b>silanol</b> groups on freshly cleaved mica that was not subjected to any treatment were found to be more stable under high vacuum compared to the plasma-activated mica: after 64 hrs, surface coverage of the <b>silanol</b> groups for freshly cleaved mica plasma was roughly the same, while surface coverage for activated mica decreased 3-fold to 10%.|$|E

In order to understand the basic mechanism involved, we study the adsorption of L-dopa molecule on hydrophilic geminal and terminal isolated <b>silanols</b> of silica (001) surface. High content of modified amino acid L-dopa is found in the glue-like material secreted by the mussels through which it sticks to various surfaces under water. To understand the adsorption behavior, we have made use of periodic Density Functional Theory (DFT) study. The L-dopa molecule adheres to silica surfaces terminated with geminal and terminal <b>silanols</b> via its catechol part. In both cases, the adhesion is achieved through the formation of 4 H-bonds.
