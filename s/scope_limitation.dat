50|$|In {{accordance}} with the US GAAP, auditors must release an opinion of the overall financial statements in the auditor's report. Auditors can release three types of statements other than an unqualified/unmodified opinion. The unqualified auditor's opinion is the opinion that the financial statements are presented fairly. A qualified opinion is that the financial statements are presented fairly in all material respects in {{accordance with}} US GAAP, except for a material misstatement that does not however pervasively affect the user's ability {{to rely on the}} financial statements. A qualified opinion can also be issued for a <b>scope</b> <b>limitation</b> that is of limited significance. Further the auditor can instead issue a disclaimer, because there is insufficient and appropriate evidence to form an opinion or because of lack of independence. In a disclaimer the auditor explains the reasons for withholding an opinion and explicitly indicates that no opinion is expressed. Finally, an adverse audit opinion is issued when the financial statements do not present fairly due to departure from US GAAP and the departure materially affects the financial statements overall. In an adverse auditor's report the auditor must explain the nature and size of the misstatement and must state the opinion that the financial statements do not present fairly in accordance with US GAAP.|$|E

30|$|SACK and FACK cannot {{recover the}} loss of retransmitted packets until timer-expiration. The {{proposed}} method can handle heavy losses including loss of retransmitted packets by keeping the transmission order information in WAITLIST, {{a natural extension of}} [19]. Existing loss recovery algorithms limit the scope of packets for recovery to those that have a sequence number between lastAcked and lastSent. After recovering the packets up to lastSent, SACK returns to normal phase. Therefore, when packets after lastSent are lost, SACK reenters the loss recovery phase. Considering the cost of each transition, freezing the transmission for the third duplicate ACKs, and re-initializing the scoreboard data structure, <b>scope</b> <b>limitation</b> can cause inefficiency. By not limiting the scope, our method can be considered as a constant loss recovery mechanism.|$|E

Balance sheet practice as to goodwill is highly inconsistent. Perhaps it should be—perhaps the auditor should allow corporations to write goodwill up or down as the fancy dictates or stock market considerations incline them. But in the absence of uniform practice, the auditor cannot afford to certify a balance sheet in which this item or any other is so stated that it can be misunderstood (Montgomery, 1934). 1...|$|E

The 3 D scene is so incrementally built and dynamically updated run-time, {{taking into account the}} movements of the camera and its field of view. To effectively and efficiently achieve this behavior, proper mechanisms of tiling and caching have been implemented. The framework implementation focuses on textured terrain streaming.

40|$|The purpose {{surrounding}} {{the basis of}} this research paper are to try and identify possible reasons for companies to adopt Financial Accounting Standard Board Statement prior to the requirement date. The <b>scope</b> <b>limitation</b> of the paper were the time and length allocated for the project. These factors determined that only one Statement would be explored, Statement 106, would be examined in depth, and that only one industry, the food industry, would be examined. Other limitations were the availability of documents, and capability of understanding information. Research methods used were examination of companies annual reports which comprised the part of the literature review, the data necessary for examining companies which adopted Statement 106. Many articles on the adoption of past FASB Statement were used in obtaining an understanding of how companies may have decided on early adoption of other Statements besides Statement 106. Major findings included such theories as the "big bath" theory and the smoothing technique. It was found that out of the 10 companies surveyed in the food industry, 7 companies have adopted Statement 106 early. For one company the adoption did not effect the financial position of the company, while for others the magnitude of the cumulative effect of accounting change was significant. B. S.

40|$|A {{library of}} iridium {{complexes}} featuring oxazoline and imidazol- 2 -ylidene ligands were synthesized by reaction of {{a library of}} imidazoles with a second library of oxazoline iodides. These complexes were active catalysts for hydrogenations of aryl substituted monoenes. Tri- and 1, 1 -disubstituted alkenes were hydrogenated quantitatively with ee??s up to 99 % at 1 atm hydrogen pressure. Catalyst, substrate, temperature and pressure effects were studied. The iridium complexes were also used for the kinetic study of hydrogenation of 2, 3 - diphenylbutadiene. This hydrogenation is a stepwise reaction: one double bond was hydrogenated first, then the second one. Both step hydrogenations were zero order in alkene. The consumption of 2, 3 -diphenylbutadiene was first order in catalyst, and probably first order in hydrogen pressure too. The enantioselectivity for the first step hydrogenation was low. There were match and mismatch catalyst-substrate relationships for the second step hydrogenation, and the enantioselectivities for this step were catalyst controlled. NMR studies indicated that the initiation of the reaction involved both hydrogen and alkene substrate. A competitive experiment was designed to explore the formation of meso-alkane at first step hydrogenation, and {{the results indicated that}} the alkane was formed predominantly via an associative mechanism. Four types of conjugate dienes were synthesized and hydrogenated. Different reactivities and selectivities were obtained for each type of dienes. In the best case, a diene was hydrogenated quantitatively with an excellent ent/meso ratio of 20 : 1. 0 and 99 % enantioselectivity. The <b>scope,</b> <b>limitation</b> and potential applications of the reactions were discussed. A selection of the dienes was hydrogenated with the Crabtree??s catalyst, for comparison, and the yields, conversions and diastereoselectivities were inferior to those from iridium-oxazoline-imidazol- 2 -ylidene catalysts...|$|E

Standard Bank Limited (SBL) is a private commercial bank in Bangladesh registered under the Companies Act, 1994. The Bank started its operation from 3 rd June 1999. Standard Bank has now in total of 79 branches as on April, 2013. Standard Bank offers all kinds of Commercial Corporate and Personal Banking services covering all segments of society. Standard Bank Ltd. has already achieved tremendous progress within only 14 years. At present the Bank has real-time centralized Online banking branches (Urban & Rural) throughout the Country having smart IT-Backbone. Besides this traditional delivery point, the bank has ATM of its own, sharing with other partner banks & Consortium throughout the country. As my major subject is Finance & Banking so I did my internship in a Bank {{which is one of}} the major sectors of today’s financial world. The study has been conducted for around 90 days. In the three month I prepared a report which consists of several Parts & Chapters. I discussed about the objective, <b>scope,</b> <b>limitation</b> of the study in the introduction part. I also discussed about the organization and overall history of Standard Bank Limited, their product information, organogram and their major competitors. In my three months of internship I was working in Customer Service Department which is under General Banking Department, where I saw which rules and regulations they followed for Deposit & its policy and procedures is also described. Different types of deposit schemes are used to deposit money on the basis of customer demand. But for this they need to know the deposit holders perception. That’s why I made a questionnaire and conducted a survey which is done by the deposit holders of SBL (Kamarpara Branch). SBL provide the efficient services to its customers. However sometimes customers are not satisfied in deposit section services which is provided by the bank, that’s why I wanted to find out in those services they are not satisfied and the reason and try to give some suggestions which is described in project part.
