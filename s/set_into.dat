5|$|The {{windows in}} the 19th-century part are topped with trefoils (a {{stonework}} pattern of three overlapping circles) and <b>set</b> <b>into</b> square frames. The north wall has three windows, one with a single light (or section) and two with pairs of lights; there are two windows on the south wall (one with three lights, another with two) {{as well as a}} blocked window at the east end of the wall. The church's east window is a pointed arch with a lower section of three trefoil-headed lights and two smaller lights on top. The {{windows in the}} extension are <b>set</b> <b>into</b> pointed arches.|$|E
5|$|A large alcove {{close by}} in the garden, entered through a portal of grey Sussex marble, formed an amphitheatre that {{contained}} an effigy representing Truth crushing a mask, again probably the work of Roubiliac. It drew the visitor's attention towards two life-sized pictures by Francis Hayman, depicting a Christian and an Unbeliever as they died, <b>set</b> <b>into</b> compartments in the wall.|$|E

5|$|An earth {{house may}} be <b>set</b> <b>into</b> a slope, with windows or door {{openings}} {{in one or}} more of its sides, or the building may be on ground level, but with earth mounded against the walls, and perhaps with an earth roof.|$|E
5|$|At the 1939 National Convention in Cincinnati, Ohio, {{plans were}} <b>set</b> <b>into</b> action to make Kappa Kappa Psi an {{international}} fraternity. Invitations {{were sent to}} {{colleges and universities in}} Canada and South America, but no chapters were ever installed at those institutions.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to legislative reform, the breaching of coastal flood defense systems during Vera prompted a redesign of such mechanisms. In Nagoya, regulation {{was created for}} coastal construction and their heights. Development of flood defenses in Ise, Osaka, and Tokyo bays was also <b>set</b> <b>into</b> motion. The heights of such defense systems were based on worst-case scenarios and maximum storm surge heights caused by the typhoon.|$|E

5|$|In {{the third}} series, Carlos put aside his roving ways {{and became the}} {{dominant}} male of the Starsky, with both Kinkajou and Mozart pregnant with his pups. Carlos was bitten in the face during a fight with Commandoes dominant male, Hannibal. An infection <b>set</b> <b>into</b> the wound, eventually killing Carlos (he really died of TB) and leaving the Starsky without a dominant male.|$|E
5|$|One major {{challenge}} was {{the approach to}} the museum. The Japanese team proposed a winding road up the mountain, not unlike the approach to the NCAR building in Colorado. Instead, Pei ordered a hole cut through a nearby mountain, connected to a major road via a bridge suspended from ninety-six steel cables and supported by a post <b>set</b> <b>into</b> the mountain. The museum itself was built into the mountain, with 80percent of the building underground.|$|E
5|$|Rommel's {{asparagus}} refers {{specifically to}} wooden poles used against aerial invasion. The term {{has also been}} used to describe wooden logs <b>set</b> <b>into</b> the beaches of the English Channel and the Atlantic Ocean to disrupt amphibious landings of troops. Testing found these wooden defenses too weak to stop boats, and they were largely abandoned in favor of Hemmbalken ("obstruction beams") and other beach defenses.|$|E

5|$|Stained {{glass windows}} {{telling the story}} of the Book of Job are <b>set</b> <b>into</b> the walls of the {{staircases}} between the narthex and the gallery. Friend was known for delivering popular lectures on Job, and Milliner speculates that Friend had these windows included {{to address the problem of}} evil. Connick designed the windows in consultation with Friend, but they were made by others after the former's death.|$|E
5|$|Structure 22 is a range {{structure}} {{on the north}} side of Plaza A. The bases of pillars survive that once separated five doorways. Structure 22 is one of the best preserved palace platforms at Iximche and had benches set against the inside of three of the walls and hearths <b>set</b> <b>into</b> the floor.|$|E
5|$|The cathedral has two {{unusual and}} often-reproduced monuments, the Berkeley memorials. These are <b>set</b> <b>into</b> niches in the wall, and each is {{surrounded}} by a canopy of inverted cusped arches. Pearson's screen, completed in 1905, echoes these memorials in its three wide arches with flamboyant cusps.|$|E

5|$|The {{composition}} of the Delos mosaics and pavements include simple pebble constructions, chip-pavement made of white marble, ceramic fragments, and pieces of tesserae. The latter falls into two categories: the simpler, tessellated opus tessellatum using large pieces of tesserae, on average eight millimeters square, and the finer opus vermiculatum using pieces of tesserae smaller than four millimeters square. Many Delian mosaics use a mixture of these materials, while chip pavement is the most common. The latter is found in fifty-five homes and usually reserved for the ground floor. The majority of Delian mosaics comprise broken pieces of marble <b>set</b> <b>into</b> cement floors; other flooring bases are composed of either rammed earth or gneiss flagstones. Pavements in kitchens and latrines were built with pottery, brick, and tile fragments {{for the purpose of}} waterproofing. Thin strips of lead <b>set</b> <b>into</b> the cement are often used to distinguish the contours of geometric-patterned mosaics, but are absent in the more complex tessellated, figured mosaics.|$|E
5|$|The {{mid-19th century}} burial ground at Ford Park Cemetery was reopened in 2007 by a {{successful}} trust and the City council operate two large early 20th century cemeteries at Weston Mill and Efford both with crematoria and chapels. There {{is also a}} privately owned cemetery {{on the outskirts of}} the city, Drake Memorial Park which does not allow headstones to mark graves, but a brass plaque <b>set</b> <b>into</b> the ground.|$|E
5|$|The smokehouse, {{measuring}} about , is {{adjacent to}} the kitchen addition. It is <b>set</b> <b>into</b> a hillside, allowing at-grade entry to its two levels. Built of square-cut logs with white chinking atop a rubble masonry foundation, the smokehouse is topped with a standing seam metal gabled roof.|$|E

5|$|Zellige are glazed {{terracotta}} tiles <b>set</b> <b>into</b> plaster, forming colourful mosaic patterns including {{regular and}} semiregular tessellations. The tradition {{is characteristic of}} Morocco, but {{is also found in}} Moorish Spain. Zellige is used to decorate mosques, public buildings and wealthy private houses.|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{is built}} into the rear wall, on the forts southern side. This room is <b>set</b> <b>into</b> the end of the rampart and was used to prepare gunpowder charges. A guardhouse was built at the manning parade's southern end in 1885. It is now used as a duty room for the drill squad during recreation demonstrations but originally was a guard's room and separate cells connected by telephone to Fort Largs. Up to three men appear to have been accommodated in the guard's room. When the fort was converted to use as a caravan park the guard house was converted to an ablution block. A store and ablution block were also built in 1885 between the stockade and rear defence wall.|$|E
5|$|As constructed, {{the main}} {{facade of the}} station faced Glenwood Avenue. The two-story {{entrance}} loggia consisted of seven arched bays, with a three-bay wing to the northeast and a two-bay wing to the southwest, and acted as a transition point between {{the street and the}} station interior. The first floor (at track level) featured a large waiting room occupying the entire center block, with vault lights providing natural illumination and a fountain <b>set</b> <b>into</b> the western wall. Restrooms, a kitchen, and a cafe occupied the wings.|$|E
