50|$|The park {{connects to}} the city {{with the help of}} bike trails at Exposition Avenue, Marion St. and Louisiana Avenue. The {{curvilinear}} paths in the park facilitate <b>smooth</b> <b>circulation</b> whereas the grove tree plantings planted at intervals allow spectacular views of mountains west of park. The park is also known for its largest flower garden in Denver, which was built in 1917. It was a Victorian-style Perennial Garden that included an elliptical lawn and symmetrical flowerbeds with 15,000 flower varieties. The flower garden also includes 54 flower beds in an informal arrangement. One garden is an exact replica of Martha Washington's garden at Mt. Vernon.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAiming at {{the battery}} thermal {{management}} system (BTMS), this paper introduced {{three kinds of}} Ultra-thin Loop Heat Pipe (ULHP) with 1. 5 mm thick wickless flat evaporator {{that can be applied}} for flake Li-ion power battery. We experimentally investigated the influences of the length of the entrance section, the shape of groove and the condenser position on the operation temperature, the thermal resistance, the start-up and heat leakage characters of ULHP, to further understand its operation principle. The results showed the ULHPs met the requirement of BTMS, the temperature with best structure was lower than 50 °C. The effective operation relied on the <b>smooth</b> <b>circulation.</b> Optimizing the structure would reduce the temperature and thermal resistance, relieve the heat leakage and accelerate the start-up...|$|E

The present second report treats bodies of infinite length with approximately <b>smooth</b> entrance. The <b>circulation</b> was caused by distributing vortex rings of constant density over a stream surface extending to infinity. Furthermore, {{the influence of a}} hub body on such cowlings was dealt with. The examples treated are meant to give the designer a basis for his design...|$|R
50|$|Most {{insects that}} are {{characterized}} {{as having a}} pain level of 3 are wasps, including the red paper wasp, the metricus paper wasp, and the velvet ant (which is actually a wasp, not an ant). The duration of the sting pain can range anywhere from one minute (such as the sting of the red paper wasp) to half an hour (such as the sting of the velvet ant). Wasp venom uniquely contains wasp kinin that exhibit kininlike activity. One of the kinins found in wasp kinin, polistes kinin 3, is found to lead to similar effects on <b>smooth</b> musculature and <b>circulation</b> as bradykinin.|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{payment system}} {{is no more}} than an {{organized}} arrangement for transferring value between its participants. So defined, it is clear that payment systems are fundamental to the functioning of all monetary economies, no matter they are developed economies, transitional economies, or developing economies. The aim of this work is to show how the architecture of payment systems (payment instruments, processing, participants and etc) influence to payment industry (microeconomic approach) and for the role of central bank in payment systems (macroeconomic - public approach). We use the method of qualitative analyse, not empirical measures. Central banks, as issuers of money, have always had a keen interest in the smooth functioning of the national payment system and the way it affects the economy. Their involvement has, however, evolved over time, as central banks have increasingly taken on a prominent role in the pursuit of the public good of maintaining trust in the currency and ensuring its <b>smooth</b> <b>circulation.</b> Consequently, their involvement in payment, clearing and settlement has changed. Also, the aim of this work is to paint a broad-brush picture of the economic links between central banks and payments in the present and the future. We research contemporary trends that affecting the role of the central bank, and trends in the future. In the work we offer some ideas about the future direction of payments and central bank involvement in payment systems. We also explore the implications for the ability of central banks to carry out their core monetary and financial stability functions in the future trough the payment systems...|$|E

30|$|The path {{is still}} problematic, facing several challenges. Perception of the {{environment}} remains the biggest challenge to reliable, smooth, and safe driving [7]. There is {{a long list of}} research questions covering a wide scope that will need to be addressed and answered, including but not limited to customer acceptance, societal impacts, communication technologies, ethical issues, planning, standards, and policy [7, 14]. Software challenges such as system security and integrity have also emerged as serious issues to be addressed. These in turn have a number of policy implications including the challenge for policymakers to streamline and regulate many diverse vehicles with different operating constraints. It is also of paramount importance for policymakers to ensure that drivers understand these vehicles’ capabilities and can operate them safely. One of the challenges ahead is to connect several intelligent vehicles {{to each other and to}} the infrastructure which gives rise to the application of Big Data, a topic concerned with the processing and analysis of large datasets [33]. In this paper, we shed light on transport related themes that are directly or indirectly and positively and negatively affected by emerging AV technology. Examples are land use, safety, vehicle-kilometer-traveled, parking, variation of demand, and fuel consumption. We have also highlighted the huge potential of incorporating connected vehicles into current traffic networks, resulting in more efficient and <b>smooth</b> traffic <b>circulation.</b> To this end, we put forward the concept of vehicle navigation to solve the routing problems faced by AVs when integrated with non-AVs. We then proceeded to formulate a traffic assignment model for the combination of AVs and non-AVs which is a synergy of system optimal and user equilibrium conditions.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT To {{investigate}} {{the action of}} calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) on human epicardi-al coronary arteries, six patients received intracoronary CGRP at doses of 50, 100, and 200 ng/min. The effect of CGRP was measured angiographically with a computerized analysis system. A dose-depen-dent increase in coronary arterial diameter was observed. At the highest dose there were 34 %, 7 %, 38 %, and 40 % mean increases in the diameters of the circumflex, proximal, mid, and distal left anterior descending arteries, respectively. No further increase in diameter was found after a subsequent dose of 1 mg intracoronary isosorbide dinitrate. Prior infusion ofCGRP did not prevent coronary arterial spasm induced by ergonovine in two patients with variant angina, but a subsequent bolus of CGRP partially relieved the spasm. We propose that CGRP has {{a role in the}} regulation of coronary vascular <b>smooth</b> muscle tone. <b>Circulation</b> 74, No. 6, 1243 - 1247, 1986 THE LOCALIZATION of neuropeptides in the car-diovascular system has suggested a physiologic role for peptidergic nerves in cardiovascular regulation.

6000|$|In a sea-going frigate {{that has}} all her {{armament}} and stores on board, {{the floor of the}} berth-deck is partly {{below the surface of the}} water. But in a <b>smooth</b> harbour, some <b>circulation</b> of air is maintained by opening large auger-holes in the upper portion of the sides, called [...] "air-ports," [...] not much above the water level. Before going to sea, however, these air-ports must be closed, caulked, and the seams hermetically sealed with pitch. These places for ventilation being shut, the sick-bay is entirely barred against the free, natural admission of fresh air. In the Neversink a few lungsful were forced down by artificial means. But as the ordinary wind-sail was the only method adopted, the quantity of fresh air sent down was regulated by the force of the wind. In a calm there was none to be had, while in a severe gale the wind-sail had to be hauled up, on account of the violent draught flowing full upon the cots of the sick. An open-work partition divided our sick-bay from the rest of the deck, where the hammocks of the watch were slung; it, therefore, was exposed to all the uproar that ensued upon the watches being relieved.|$|R
