50|$|Following Confederation, Canada {{recognized}} many of {{the foreign}} policy agreements Newfoundland had entered under this commission. During the 1950s to the 1970s, the domestic and foreign fishing fleets became increasingly industrialized, with massive factory <b>freezer</b> <b>trawlers</b> fishing out of Newfoundland ports - foreign fleets were based in Newfoundland and could fish 12 nautical miles offshore, while domestic fleets could fish in both the territorial sea and the offshore.|$|R
25|$|Outrigger {{trawlers}} – use outriggers to tow the trawl. These {{are commonly}} used to catch shrimp. One or two otter trawls can be towed from each <b>side.</b> Beam <b>trawlers,</b> employed in the North sea for catching flatfish, are another form of outrigger trawler. Medium-sized and high powered vessels, these tow a beam trawl on each side at speeds up to 8 knots.|$|R
50|$|The Mincarlo was {{the type}} of trawler known as a sidewinder or <b>side</b> <b>trawler.</b> On sidewinders, the trawl nets are {{deployed}} over the side with the trawl warps passed through blocks suspended from two gallows. These gallows were forward and aft, on the starboard side of the Mincarlo. The fishing gear consisted of two otter trawls each of which was fitted with otter boards. Otter boards keep the mouth of the trawl net open and are positioned {{in such a way that}} the hydrodynamic forces, acting on them when the net is towed along the seabed, pushes the boards outwards. This keeps the mouth of the net open. The nets were attached to heavy duty ground ropes, 40 ft long, which held the nets on the seabed and ticked up any fish lying on or below the sand. Until the late sixties, sidewinders were the most common deep sea boat used in North Atlantic fisheries. They were used for a longer period than other types of trawler.|$|R

25|$|Beam {{trawlers}} – use sturdy outrigger booms for towing a beam trawl, one warp on each <b>side.</b> Double-rig beam <b>trawlers</b> can tow {{a separate}} trawl on each <b>side</b> of the <b>trawler.</b> Beam trawling {{is used in}} the flatfish and shrimp fisheries in the North Sea. They are medium-sized and high powered vessels, towing gear at speeds up to 8 knots. To avoid the boat capsizing if the trawl snags on the sea floor, winch brakes can be installed, along with safety release systems in the boom stays. The engine power of bottom trawlers is also restricted to 2000 HP (1472 KW) for further safety.|$|R
40|$|This report {{contains}} {{the results of}} the discard sampling programme of the Dutch pelagic <b>freezer</b> <b>trawler</b> fleet in European waters in 2010. The pelagic <b>freezer</b> <b>trawler</b> fishery targets pelagic species, namely herring (Clupea harengus), blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou), horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus), mackerel (Scomber scombrus), greater argentine (Argentina silus), and pilchard (Sardina pilchardus). The annual landings of this fishery illustrates its seasonality; different species are targeted during different parts of the year. The total landings of the Dutch fleet were about 201, 000 tonnes in 2010. Horse mackerel and herring were the most abundant landed species. Overall, the discard percentage for the Dutch pelagic fleet in 2010, based on 8 sampled trips, is estimated at 6 % in weight. This is consistent with the discard percentages that have been found in previous years. However, in 2010 we did not succeed in sampling the fishery each quarter of the year; no trip was sampled in quarter 3. On board of the pelagic <b>freezer</b> <b>trawlers</b> two different discarding methods are observed, namely discarding after the catch is sorted and discarding prior to sorting. The latter includes catch that is discarded directly or via the conveyer belt from the cooling tanks, and catch that is slipped from the net. Due to practical limitations and safety issues {{it is not possible to}} sample these discards. The results show that the estimated amount of unsampled discards represent 30 % of the total estimated discards. Motivations for discarding unsampled catch can vary. Anecdotal information implies most incidents of discarding take place when more fish is caught than can be stored in the cooling tanks. In addition, fish-quality issues, unprofitable mixtures of species, or a lack in quota, could also be reasons for this discarding behaviour. The discard composition and length frequency data shown in this report are only based on routinely sorted discards. Discard percentages of target species herring, horse mackerel, and blue whiting are relatively low (1 %, 1 %, and 4 % respectively). For mackerel the discard percentage is significantly higher (18 %). The present study therefore suggests that, with the exception of mackerel, this fishery is efficient, when it comes to targeting (marketable) fish...|$|R

50|$|A fish factory, {{also called}} a fish plant, fish {{processing}} facility, is a facility where fish processing is performed. Fish factories {{range in the}} size and range of species of fish they process. Some species of fish, such as mackerel and herring, and can be caught at sea by large pelagic trawlers and offloaded to the factory {{within a few days}} of being caught. Or the fish can be caught by <b>freezer</b> <b>trawlers</b> that freeze the fish before providing it to factories, or by factory ships which can do the processing themselves on board. Some fish factories have fishing vessels catching fish for them at a given times of the year. This is to do with quotas and seasons conflicting how much and when the fish can be landed.|$|R

50|$|Although the {{fisheries}} remained {{vital to the}} economy of rural Newfoundland, they fell under federal jurisdiction. Ottawa determined fish quotas, distributed trawler licenses, and set all other aspects of fisheries policy. During the 1982 constitutional negotiations Peckford tried to acquire greater provincial control of {{the fisheries}}, {{but was unable to}} get enough support from other premiers. Peckford argued the province had a historic and moral right to the fisheries and the government did its best to influence federal fisheries policy. When the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans issued licenses to three factory <b>freezer</b> <b>trawlers</b> in 1985, Peckford declared it a “disaster of monumental proportions.” Overfishing continued to be an issue, and decisions made by Peckford's own administration did not help matters.

Although {{freshwater}} fishing was a major agricultural activity in Nigeria at the time, Ibru saw that this would change with economic development, opening a market for frozen fish.At first he ran into technical problems with supply and also met consumer resistance. Two joint ventures both failed. He then formed Ibru Sea Foods as the sole owner, importing the frozen fish and at first trading {{from the back of}} a truck. He expanded quickly, chartering his first fishing boat in 1963, and in 1965 founding a fishing company with three <b>freezer</b> <b>trawlers</b> as a joint venture with a Japanese firm. Despite setbacks, the fishing fleet had grown to as many as 25 trawlers in the 1970s, and Ibru had 200 transport vehicles. Ibru had also expanded into vehicle distribution and fruit growing.|$|R
5000|$|Dalniy Vostok, a 104 m, 5,700-ton trawler, {{was built}} in 1989 and had {{international}} number IMO 8730429.

40|$|For the {{commercial}} fishing industry, efficiency and sustainability are {{key aspects of}} business. Knowing when and where to harvest, along with the environmental traits associated with good fishing grounds, minimizes costly fuel and time spent searching for fish. Quantifying this knowledge not only creates a baseline of habitat information, but also preserves fishing patterns for use by future harvesters or in developing fisheries. This study investigates temporal and spatial patterns in the catch rates of yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea) recorded by factory <b>freezer</b> <b>trawlers</b> operating on the Grand Bank of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. The temporal analysis revealed that commercial catch rates are higher at night as well as during winter and summer. The findings suggest that ambient light levels and environmental factors are important for successful yellowtail flounder- trawl interactions. Spatial analysis is used to show the interactions between environmental variables and yellowtail flounder catch rates. It was found that wind speed, water depth, sediment type, and bottom water temperature all relate to catch rate, but in varying degrees. The results of this project provide evidential support for improved data collection, storage, and analysis by our industry partner...|$|R
