At {{the beginning of the}} 1980s Gerdes stood out in exhibitions and actions with his criticism of the link between modern art, the museum and the temporary exhibition. At this time he exhibited among others along with Thomas Schütte. He pleaded for works of art as a means for the organization of public space and as a medium of communication. The English landscape garden was a particularly important historical model of this to him. At this time he was regarded as the intellectual head of the artist-group of Duesseldorf pattern makers (Duesseldorfer Modellbauer). In 1982 he was included in the documenta 7 in Kassel. He became known to a larger public in 1987 with his land art project A Ship for Münster (Ein Schiff für Münster) for the show “Skulptur.Projekte” in Münster. From 1990 to 1992 he taught at the Städelschule, Frankfurt; from 1998 to 2004 he was professor for painting and multimedia at the art academy in Karlsruhe; since 2005 he was professor for painting at the Muthesius Art Academy in Kiel. Parallel to his professorship he lived and worked as an artist in Munich and Düsseldorf.|$|E

Ninety-four percent of its budget is provided by German North Rhine-Westphalia, even though the college is non-governmental, run by the Jesuits. The remaining 6% is covered by the Archdiocese of Cologne. The school is open to everyone. The State conducts the <b>school-leaving</b> <b>examination</b> (called the <b>Abitur,</b> the equivalent of A-levels in the UK) and proposes the subjects of instruction. In turn, the school is recognized by the State, and a successfully completed Abitur by any graduate allows admission to a German university. Lodging, food, and boarding run about €14,000 per year, while students from impoverished families are sponsored by the Jesuits or by the charge for other boarders.|$|R

Since {{we are talking about}} education, with no doubts affecting marginal public proportion, media devoted a lot of space to this issue as {{to one of the most}} discussed topics within the year 2010. The bachelor thesis endeavour is addressed to research whether in these concrete attitudes of the given periodicals might be observed bias marks in the way of information presenting. There will be two various methods applied - quantitative content analysis and discourse analysis. Background data for both these methods will constitute of articles issued in the above mentioned periodicals during October 2010 (thus at a time when test run for the state <b>school-leaving</b> <b>examinations</b> was held).

The aim of the thesis was to clarify the washback effect of the Estonian national <b>school-leaving</b> <b>examination</b> in English has had. Three hypotheses were tested: 1) The format and the content of the Estonian National <b>school-leaving</b> <b>Examination</b> in English affect teaching. 2) The Estonian National <b>school-leaving</b> <b>Examination</b> in English shapes what teachers teach. 3) There is more evidence on negative washback effect than the positive one. There are two chapters in a current master thesis. The first chapter presented a general overview of the theoretical framework for the thesis, introducing the exam’s washback effect and examination impact based on preliminary surveys. The second chapter concentrated on how the data was gathered, arranged and analyzed, and introduced the findings of the survey...|$|R

40|$|In Central Europe, {{education}} has undergone considerable upheaval since {{the change of}} political systems {{at the end of}} the 1980 s. One of the most radical is the revision and reform of <b>school-leaving</b> <b>examination</b> systems. From school- and teacher-based subjective assessments conducted in a largely ritualistic fashion, with no explicit criteria for evaluation, standards to refer to, or quality control procedures of any sort, systems are now being developed that introduce modern ideas of testing and quality assurance, external quality control procedures and alignment, in theory, to common European standards. In this context, it is well known that teachers' grades in final examinations vary enormously, from school to school, region to region and even within the same school. Indeed, a growing realisation that this variation is unacceptable in the New Europe is one of the driving forces for examination reform. Several governments have decreed that <b>school-leaving</b> <b>examinations</b> should be developed [...] ...|$|R
