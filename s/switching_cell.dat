If each <b>switch</b> <b>cell</b> is turned on at a different time, rush current can be reduced.

We define wakeup scheduling as to determine turn-on time and signal slew of each switch cell; {{the goal is to}} minimize wakeup delay while keeping rush current below the maximum value that is allowed. The determined turn-on time and signal slew are implemented using a buffered tree. The wakeup scheduling and buffered tree construction are integrated into a design flow. To adapt to process variation, we use adjustable delay buffers in the wakeup network. We also apply grid-based design flow and use Schmitt triggers to implement large designs.
