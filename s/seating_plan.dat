2500|$|The {{theater was}} {{built as a}} cinema by Lucas and Jenkins Theatres, a company which {{operated}} other Georgia theaters at the time including the Fox [...] in Atlanta. The Euclid was among three theaters built by L in Atlanta in 1940, another was the Gordon Theatre in the West End (now used as a church). [...] The Euclid boasted a [...] "staggered <b>seating</b> <b>plan</b> so no seat is directly behind another" [...] and a neon marquee with [...] "Euclid" [...] in block letters. [...] It opened at 2:15 P.M. Friday, October 4, 1940 and the first film exhibited was My Favorite Wife.|$|E
2500|$|The plans materialized in 2004 {{with the}} {{establishment}} of routes from Billund to Milan, Oslo and Kristiansand. The airline entered a codesharing agreement with Kenya Airways, allowing passengers to fly from Billund via Amsterdam to Nairobi and onwards to 26 African destinations. A new reservation system was introduced allowing passengers to pick their seat upon booking and opt for additional seat pitch. The aircraft received a new <b>seating</b> <b>plan,</b> whereby four different classes were introduced, named [...] "small", [...] "medium", [...] "large" [...] and [...] "x-large", with pitches ranging from [...] and from six to four abreast. Each aircraft would increase its annual flight time from 2,200 to 3,600 hours, allowing for more routes to be flown with the same fleet. Combined, this allowed for a significant drop in the airline's unit costs.|$|E

2500|$|During Madonna's {{performances}} on March 5 and 6 at New Zealand, {{many of the}} public were refused entry to the shows because their tickets were rendered invalid. Approximately 20 people, who purchased their tickets through the Queen of Tickets website, were turned away from entering the concert, while others were required to generate another printed ticket at customer service queues. According to Stuff.co.nz, head ticketing seller Ticketmaster had changed the <b>seating</b> <b>plan</b> of the venues without contacting Queen of Tickets website, as a result they had to refund {{the people who had}} brought a ticket from them. At the end of Madonna's second show in Brisbane, the singer exposed the breast of a 17-year-old woman, Josephine Georgiou, on stage by pulling down her top. The singer had jokingly responded [...] "Oh sorry, sexual harassment", however it caused controversy when the general public took to social media to label the incident as a sexual assault. Georgiou defended the singer by stating it was [...] "the best time of my life".|$|E
2500|$|The crisis {{committee}} appointed {{an interim}} government on 8 April; using {{the terms of the}} 1991 constitution instead of the Arusha Accords, the committee designated Theodore Sindikubwabo as interim president of Rwanda, while Jean Kambanda was the new prime minister. All political parties were represented in the government, but most members were from the [...] "Hutu Power" [...] wings of their respective parties. The interim government was sworn in on 9 April, but immediately relocated from Kigali to Gitarama to avoid fighting between the RPF and the Rwandan army in the capital. The crisis committee was officially dissolved, but Bagosora and the senior officers remained the de facto rulers of the country. The government played its part in mobilising the population, giving the regime an air of legitimacy, but was effectively a puppet regime with no ability to halt the army or the Interahamwe's activities. When Romeo Dallaire visited the government's headquarters a week after its formation, he found most officials at leisure, describing their activities as [...] "sorting out the <b>seating</b> <b>plan</b> for a meeting that was not about to convene any time soon." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stokowski rapidly {{gained a}} {{reputation}} as a musical showman. His flair for the theatrical included grand gestures such as throwing the sheet music on the floor to show he did not need to conduct from a score. He also experimented with new lighting arrangements in the concert hall, at one point conducting in a dark hall with only his head and hands lighted, at other times arranging the lights so they would cast theatrical shadows of his head and hands. Late in the 1929-30 symphony season, Stokowski started conducting without a baton. His free-hand manner of conducting soon became one of his trademarks. On the musical side, Stokowski nurtured the orchestra and shaped the [...] "Stokowski" [...] sound, or {{what became known as the}} [...] "Philadelphia Sound". He encouraged [...] "free bowing" [...] from the string section, [...] "free breathing" [...] from the brass section, and continually altered the seating arrangements of the orchestra's sections, as well as the acoustics of the hall, in response to his urge to [...] create a better sound. Stokowski is credited as the first conductor to adopt the <b>seating</b> <b>plan</b> that is used by most orchestras today, with first and second violins together on the conductor's left, and the violas and cellos to the right.|$|E

2500|$|After {{securing}} press credentials {{for herself}} and a photographer, and after visiting Peru's Congress to interview some of its members and attend sessions where she took notes and sketched a <b>seating</b> <b>plan,</b> Berenson was arrested on a public bus along with the photographer. Her photographer {{turned out to be}} the wife of a top MRTA leader, a fact which Berenson stated she was unaware of at that time. The MRTA is alleged to have intended to use the information to seize lawmakers and exchange the hostages for imprisoned MRTA members. The house she rented in Lima was found to contain an arsenal of weapons and ammunition, together with armed guerrillas who violently resisted capture. She denied knowing of the presence of either the weaponry or the guerillas, and she also denied knowing that the documents she prepared would be used for terrorism. In 2011 she admitted that she had known that her associates were MRTA members and she said: [...] "It might not have been intentional, but the bottom line is: I did collaborate with them." [...] In the same interview she maintained that she had not been aware that weapons were being amassed in the upper floors of her house which she had sublet to the MRTA members, and she also maintained that she was unaware that violent actions were being planned at the Congress, stating that [...] "at that time in Fujimori’s dictatorship, Congress was the only place that there was some sort of democratic process." ...|$|E
