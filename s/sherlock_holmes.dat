5|$|<b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> Baffled is a {{very short}} American silent film created in 1900 with {{cinematography}} by Arthur Marvin. It is the earliest known film to feature Arthur Conan Doyle's detective character <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes,</b> albeit in a form unlike that of later screen incarnations. The inclusion of the character also makes it the first recorded detective film. In the film, a thief who can appear and disappear at will steals a sack of items from <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes.</b> At each point, Holmes's attempts to thwart the intruder end in failure.|$|E
5|$|The 1908 American silent film <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> in the Great Murder Mystery was an {{adaptation}} of the story, with Dupin replaced by <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes.</b> The film is lost and the director and cast are unknown.|$|E
5|$|The plot of <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> Baffled is {{unrelated}} to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's canonical <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> stories; {{it is likely}} that the character's name was used purely for its familiarity with the public. Shot from a single point of view on a stage set, the intention of <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> Baffled was probably to act as a showcase for basic film trickery and film editing effects, particularly the stop trick first developed four years earlier in 1896 by French director Georges Méliès.|$|E
5|$|The Adventures of <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> {{were well}} {{received}} upon their serialisation in The Strand Magazine.|$|E
5|$|Anthony Horowitz's 2014 novel Moriarty, about Arthur Conan Doyle's {{character}} in his <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> stories, includes a scene set in Richmond Park.|$|E
5|$|BBC Books {{published}} some of Conan Doyle's original {{collections and}} novels as tie-in editions, with cover art featuring Cumberbatch and Freeman. A Study in Scarlet and The Adventures of <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> were released in Autumn 2011, with introductions by Moffat and Gatiss respectively. The Hound of the Baskervilles, The Sign of Four and The Memoirs of <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> were released in March 2012, with introductions by Cumberbatch, Freeman and Thompson respectively. Two more books, The Return of <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> and His Last Bow, were released in December 2013, {{ahead of the}} premiere of the third series. They featured introductions by Gatiss and Moffat respectively. According to Radio Times, the popularity of Sherlock {{has led to a}} resurgence in the sales of the original Conan Doyle stories.|$|E
5|$|Biograph films before 1903 {{were mostly}} actualities (documentary footage of actual persons, places and events), but <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> Baffled {{is an example}} of an early Biograph comedy {{narrative}} film, produced at the company's rooftop studio on Broadway in New York City. According to Christopher Redmond's <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> Handbook, the film was shot on April 26, 1900. Julie McKuras states that the film was released in May of the same year. Despite being in circulation, <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> Baffled was only registered on February 24, 1903, and this is the date seen on the film's copyright title card. The occasionally suggested date of 1905 is probably due to confusion with a Vitagraph film titled Adventures of Sherlock Holmes; or, Held for Ransom (1905).|$|E
5|$|Moffat: If <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> {{decided that}} {{somebody}} should die, {{he would kill}} them. I don't think he'd {{have any problem with}} that.|$|E
5|$|Northumberland Avenue is {{referenced}} {{several times}} in Arthur Conan Doyle's <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> novels, including The Greek Interpreter and The Hound of the Baskervilles. The stories refer to wealthy Oriental visitors staying in hotels along the avenue, including the Grand, the Metropole and the Victoria. The Northumberland Arms, at the junction of Northumberland Street and Northumberland Avenue, a public house, was renamed the <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> in 1957, and contains numerous Holmes-related exhibits from the 1951 Festival of London.|$|E
5|$|Publishers and {{retailers}} reported a 180% rise in sales of <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> books {{during the first}} series' broadcast.|$|E
5|$|The Adventures of <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> is a {{collection}} of twelve short stories by Arthur Conan Doyle, featuring his fictional detective <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes.</b> It was first published on 14 October 1892; the individual stories had been serialised in The Strand Magazine between July 1891 and June 1892. The stories are not in chronological order, and the only characters common to all twelve are Holmes and Dr. Watson. The stories are related in first-person narrative from Watson's point of view.|$|E
5|$|The two 20th Century Fox films—The Hound of the Baskervilles and The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes—had survived {{complete}} {{and in good}} condition, but those in the Universal series suffered badly over the years, as they passed through the hands of different copyright owners. In 1993 the UCLA Film and Television Archive started a restoration project on the series after the unstable cellulose nitrate film {{was found to be}} suffering from deterioration. Restoration on the first six films—The Woman in Green, The Pearl of Death, <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> and the Secret Weapon, The Scarlet Claw, Terror by Night and The Spider Woman—took four years from 1993; the costs for the restoration were met by UCLA and Hugh Hefner, who was a fan of the Rathbone-Holmes series. From 1998 Warner Bros. matched Hefner's funding and the remaining six films—Dressed to Kill, Pursuit to Algiers, <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> Faces Death, The House of Fear, <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> and the Voice of Terror and <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> in Washington—were then restored, a process that was completed in 2001.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} {{mentioned}} in the <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> short story The Final Problem, when Dr Watson catches a Continental Express train from Victoria to avoid Moriarty and his henchmen.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the scope}} of a popular {{comparison}} that draws parallels between House and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes,</b> Wilson is equivalent to Doctor Watson. In two-parts episodes such as Euphoria, Part 1 and Euphoria, Part 2, and House's Head and Wilson's Heart, Wilson's voice is heard narrating the story, while Dr. Watson is the character who narrates the stories in most of <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> novels. Leonard has said that his character and House were originally intended to play roles similar to Dr. Watson and <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes,</b> respectively, in the series although he believes that House's team has {{assumed the role of}} Watson since the show has begun. Producer Katie Jacobs believes that Wilson and House both hide from mature relationships, which brings the two closer together. She has said that {{the difference between the two}} characters is that Wilson finds it hard to say no because he wants to please the other person. The similarities between Dr. Wilson and Dr. Watson was also one of the reasons that made Leonard choose House over Numb3rs.|$|E
5|$|A {{police station}} in Bow Street is {{mentioned}} in the <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> story The Man with the Twisted Lip. At the station, Holmes reveals that the beggar Hugh Boone is the aristocrat Neville St. Clair in disguise.|$|E
5|$|The pilot Spectre, Roddenberry's 1977 {{attempt to}} create an occult detective duo similar to <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> and Dr. Watson, was {{released}} as a television movie within the United States and received a limited theatrical release in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{performing}} {{works from}} the classical repertoire, the RPO has recorded a number of film scores, including those for Powell and Pressburger's The Red Shoes and The Tales of Hoffmann. Other scores recorded by the RPO are Olivier's Richard III, The Bridge on the River Kwai, and The Private Life of <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Downey's other {{commercial}} film release of 2010 was the comedy road film Due Date. The movie, co-starring Zach Galifianakis, {{was released in}} November 2010 and grossed over $211M worldwide, making it the 36th highest-grossing movie of 2010. Downey's sole 2011 film credit was the sequel to the 2009 version of <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes,</b> , which opened worldwide on December 16, 2011.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> (Benedict Cumberbatch) and John Watson (Martin Freeman) {{take on a}} {{case about}} stolen letters. This leads the pair into {{conflict}} with Charles Augustus Magnussen (Lars Mikkelsen), a media mogul specialising in blackmail whom Sherlock despises. Holmes and Watson try to get Magnussen arrested, but their attempt fails when they confront him at Appledore, Magnussen's home.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Potter {{continued}} to distribute her privately printed edition {{to family and}} friends, with the celebrated creator of <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes,</b> Arthur Conan Doyle, acquiring a copy for his children. When the first private printing of 250 copies was sold out, another 200 were prepared. She noted in an inscription in one copy that her beloved pet rabbit Peter had died.|$|E
5|$|Other {{influences}} {{that have been}} established include H.G. Wells, L.Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz(1900), J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan(1904), Carlo Collodi's Pinocchio(1883), Arthur Conan Doyle's <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> and the Engineer's Thumb(1889), Henryk Sienkiewicz's Quo Vadis(1896), Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde(1886), and Mark Twain's The 1,000,000 Pound Bank-Note(1893).|$|E
5|$|Sherlock {{is a crime}} drama {{television}} series based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> detective stories. Created by Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss, it stars Benedict Cumberbatch as <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> and Martin Freeman as Doctor John Watson. Thirteen episodes have been produced, with three-part series airing from 2010 to 2017, and a special episode that aired on 1 January 2016. The series {{is set in the}} present day, while the one-off special features a Victorian period fantasy resembling the original Holmes stories. Sherlock is a co-production of the British network BBC and the American station WGBH Boston for its Masterpiece anthology series on PBS, along with Hartswood Films, with Moffat, Gatiss, Sue Vertue and Rebecca Eaton serving as executive producers. The series is primarily filmed in Cardiff, Wales, with North Gower Street in London used for exterior shots of Holmes and Watson's 221B Baker Street residence.|$|E
5|$|While {{initially}} hesitant about releasing annotated editions, Gaiman eventually {{changed his}} mind when he forgot a reference when asked about it by a reader. The task of annotating the series was undertaken by Gaiman's friend Leslie S. Klinger of The New Annotated <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> who worked from the original scripts {{given to him by}} Gaiman.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} {{fourteen}} films based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> stories were released between 1939 and 1946; the British actors Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce played Holmes and Dr. John Watson, respectively. The first two {{films in the}} series were produced by 20th Century Fox and released in 1939. The studio stopped making the films after these, but Universal Studios acquired the rights from the Doyle estate and produced a further twelve films.|$|E
5|$|Back in the West End, Richardson was {{in another}} Sherriff play, The White Carnation, in 1953, and in November {{of the same year}} he and Gielgud starred {{together}} in NCHunter's A Day by the Sea, which ran at the Haymarket for 386 performances. During this period, Richardson played Dr Watson in an American/BBC radio co-production of <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> stories, with Gielgud as Holmes and Orson Welles as the evil Professor Moriarty. These recordings were later released commercially on disc.|$|E
5|$|Gil Grissom has a {{more than}} passing {{similarity}} to <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes.</b> Like Holmes, Grissom is dispassionate with a fierce devotion to logic and little regard for societal norms of behavior; Grissom once smashed mustard jars {{in a grocery store}} to illustrate a theory ("I-15 Murders"), much as Holmes once practiced spearing a pig in a butchers to determine how strong a man would have to be to transfix a man with a harpoon.|$|E
5|$|Hemlock Hoax, the Detective is an American short comedy film {{produced}} and distributed in 1910 by the Lubin Manufacturing Company. The silent film features a detective named Hemlock Hoax {{who tries to}} solve a murder, which unbeknownst to him is a practical joke being played on him by two young boys. It {{was one of many}} shorts designed to derive its humor from a sleuth whose name was similar to <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Little further is {{recorded}} of Cartier's career {{until after the}} Second World War, when he began writing storylines for several minor British films. He also worked as a film producer, overseeing a 1951 short film adaptation of the <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> story The Man with the Twisted Lip. Cartier returned for a time to the United States, where he studied production methods in the new medium of television.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{shown in}} Mutoscope {{machines}} in arcades, <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> Baffled has a running time of 30 seconds. Although produced in 1900, {{it was only}} registered in 1903, and a copyright notice stating this is seen on some prints. The identities of the actors playing the first screen Holmes and his assailant are not recorded. Assumed to be lost for many years, the film was rediscovered in 1968 as a paper print in the Library of Congress.|$|E
5|$|Similarities between House and {{the famous}} fictional detective <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> appear in the pilot; Shore {{explained}} that he was always a fan of Holmes, and found the character's traits of indifference to his clients unique. House and Holmes have only one real friend (Wilson and Watson, respectively) who connects the cerebral hero to human concerns. This Holmes and Watson dynamic was something the producers were looking for in the characters of House and Wilson, especially in terms of chemistry.|$|E
5|$|After {{a success}} as Hamlet in London in 1925, Barrymore left {{the stage for}} 14 years and instead focused entirely on films. In the silent film era, he was well {{received}} in such pictures as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1920), <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> (1922) and The Sea Beast (1926). During this period, he gained his nickname, the Great Profile. His stage-trained voice proved an asset when sound films were introduced, and three of his works, Grand Hotel (1932), Twentieth Century (1934) and Midnight (1939) have been inducted into the National Film Registry.|$|E
5|$|After {{production}} of Fire and Ice wrapped, Bakshi attempted several projects that fell through, including adaptations of Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, William Kotzwinkle's The Fan Man, Eric Rücker Eddison's The Worm Ouroboros, Stephen Crane's , Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer novels and an anthropomorphic depiction of <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes.</b> He turned down offers to direct Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes and Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? He passed {{the latter to}} Ridley Scott, who adapted it into the 1982 film Blade Runner.|$|E
5|$|In {{recent years}} Davis has {{returned}} to directing for theatre and film. He wrote and directed three short films and co-wrote and directed several episodes of a television series for CBC Television, 49th & Main. In 2011 he directed two plays for The United Players of Vancouver, Waste by Harley Granville Barker and Hay Fever by Noël Coward. Most recently he directed The Habit of Art (2013) by Alan Bennett, <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> and the Case of the Jersey Lily (2015) by Katie Forgette and Robert Bolt’s A Man for All Seasons at the Jericho Arts Centre in Vancouver, British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|John Watson, {{whose wife}} Mary is now visibly pregnant, finds an unkempt <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> {{living in a}} crack house under the {{influence}} of drugs. John attempts to force him to rehabilitate, but Sherlock insists that he was undercover for a case. Mycroft confronts Sherlock about the drug use and realises that Sherlock is investigating Charles Augustus Magnussen, a newspaper owner who blackmails people. Sherlock has been enlisted by Lady Elizabeth Smallwood to negotiate the return of stolen letters written by Smallwood's husband. Mycroft warns Sherlock not to go after Magnussen, which Sherlock ignores.|$|E
5|$|Manga-News {{reviewed}} the story arc positively. They praised {{several aspects of}} the story arc: the plot and narration for being captivating and for including famous London settings, references to <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes,</b> and the Wimbledon competition; the characterization for the antagonist Sabara Hades; and the romance between Shinichi and Ran which was described as an event readers had been waiting for. Manga-News however criticized how Shinichi and Ran's interaction were covered by flashbacks instead of happening chronologically. AnimeLand reviewed volume 71 and called it the best since volume 59.|$|E
5|$|To avoid violating Edison's patents, Biograph cameras from 1895 to 1902 used a large-format film {{measuring}} 2-23/32 inches (68mm) wide, with {{an image}} area of 2 × 2½ inches, four times that of Edison's 35mm format. Biograph film was not ready-perforated; the camera itself punched a sprocket hole {{on each side of}} the frame as the film was exposed at 30 frames per second. <b>Sherlock</b> <b>Holmes</b> Baffled ran to 86.56 metres in length, giving the film a running time of 30 seconds (although in practice, due to the hand-cranked gearing of the Mutoscope this would have varied).|$|E
