25|$|In a {{microporous}} material where physisorption {{and weak}} van der Waals forces dominate adsorption, the <b>storage</b> <b>density</b> is greatly {{dependent on the}} size of the pores. Calculations of idealized homogeneous materials, such as graphitic carbons and carbon nanotubes, predict that a microporous material with 7Å-wide pores will exhibit maximum hydrogen uptake at room temperature.

25|$|The {{environmental}} effects of motorized bicycles varies according to the power source.

However, the {{environmental effects}} of electricity generation and power distribution from plants generating power from fossil fuels, as well as manufacturing and disposing of (limited life) high <b>storage</b> <b>density</b> batteries containing toxic materials must also be taken into account. Older two stroke engines, commonly use in motorized bicycles powered by internal combustion engines often emitted more pollution than automobiles due to partial combustion of oil included in the fuel, {{but this is not the}} case with four-stroke or newer 2 stroke motor designs.|$|E
25|$|The maximum areal <b>storage</b> <b>density</b> for {{flash memory}} used in solid state drives (SSDs) is 2.8Tbit/in2 in {{laboratory}} demonstrations as of 2016, and the maximum for HDDs is 1.5Tbit/in2. The areal density of flash memory is doubling every two years, similar to Moore's law (40% per year) {{and faster than}} the 10–20% per year for HDDs. As of 2016, maximum capacity was 10terabytes for an HDD, and 15terabytes for an SSD. HDDs were used in 70% of the desktop and notebook computers produced in 2016, and SSDs were used in 30%. The usage share of HDDs is declining and could drop below 50% in 2018–2019 according to one forecast, because SSDs are replacing smaller-capacity (less than one-terabyte) HDDs in desktop and notebook computers and MP3 players.|$|E

25|$|Introduced by IBM in 1956, HDDs {{became the}} {{dominant}} secondary storage device for general-purpose computers {{by the early}} 1960s. Continuously improved, HDDs have maintained this position into the modern era of servers and personal computers. More than 200 companies have produced HDDs historically, though after extensive industry consolidation most current units are manufactured by Seagate, Toshiba, and Western Digital. HDD unit shipments and sales revenues are declining, though production (exabytes per year) is growing. Flash memory has a growing {{share of the market}} for secondary storage, in the form of solid-state drives (SSDs). SSDs have higher data-transfer rates, higher areal <b>storage</b> <b>density,</b> better reliability, and much lower latency and access times.

This contrasts with conventional lithium-ion cells, where the lithium ions are intercalated in the anode and cathodes. Each sulfur atom can host two lithium ions. Typically, lithium-ion batteries accommodate only 0.5–0.7 lithium ions per host atom.

2500|$|NAND flash {{has reduced}} erase and write times, and {{requires}} less chip area per cell, thus allowing greater <b>storage</b> <b>density</b> and lower cost per bit than NORflash; {{it also has}} up to 10 times the endurance of NORflash. However, the I/O interface of NANDflash {{does not provide a}} random-access external address bus. Rather, data must be read on a block-wise basis, with typical block sizes of hundreds to thousands of bits. This makes NANDflash unsuitable as a drop-in replacement for program ROM, since most microprocessors and microcontrollers require byte-level random access. In this regard, NANDflash is similar to other secondary data storage devices, such as hard disks and optical media, and is thus highly suitable for use in mass-storage devices, such as memory cards. The first NAND-based removable media format was SmartMedia in 1995, and many others have followed, including: ...|$|E
2500|$|Unsaturated organic {{compounds}} can store {{huge amounts of}} hydrogen. These Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHC) are hydrogenated for storage and dehydrogenated again when the energy/hydrogen is needed. Research on LOHC was concentrated on cycloalkanes at an early stage, with its relatively high hydrogen capacity (6-8 wt %) and production of COx-free hydrogen. [...] Heterocyclic aromatic compounds (or N-Heterocycles) are also appropriate for this task. A compound that stands in {{the focus of the}} current LOHC research is N-ethylcarbazole (NEC) but many others do exist. More recently dibenzyltoluene, which is already industrially used as a heat transfer fluid in industry, was identified as potential LOHC.

40|$|Access latency to {{secondary}} storage devices is frequently a limiting factor in computer system performance. New storage technologies promise to provide greater <b>storage</b> <b>densities</b> at lower latencies than is currently obtainable with hard disk drives.

Previous research has examined data layout and request ordering algorithms that are analogs of those developed for hard drives.
