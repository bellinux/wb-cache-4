5000|$|In power engineering, {{winding factor}} is a {{technique}} that is employed to improve the rms generated voltage or emf in a three-phase AC electrical machine so that the output voltage and hence torque {{does not have any}} harmonics in it which may reduce efficiency. This is because the armature winding of each phase is distributed in a number of slots. Since the emf induced in different slots are not in phase, their phasor sum is less than their numerical sum. This reduction factor is called distribution factor Kd. Another factor that can reduce the winding factor is when the <b>slot</b> <b>pitch</b> is smaller than the pole pitch, called pitch factor Kp. The winding factor can be calculated as Kw = Kd * Kp To calculate the winding factor, Kw=Kd X Kp [...] ----(1) Where Kd=~1 (point here {{to keep in mind is}} that all(three phase) motors are balanced systems.

Internationally accepted standards limits the amount of harmonics allowedin the no-load voltage. These limits can be difficult to fulfill with integral slot winding,where the number of slots per pole and phase is an integer. The presence of thedamper winding often makes the problem with harmonics even worse and harmonicswith frequencies of order 6 q± 1 arise with significant amplitude. How the damperwinding is designed affect the content of harmonics in the no-load voltage and the aimwith these … has been to investigate in which extent design of the damper windingaffects the contents of harmonics.

30|$|To {{choose a}} {{reasonable}} mode of three-phase winding {{for the improvement}} of the operating efficiency of cascaded linear induction motor, the time and space characteristics of magnetomotive force were investigated. The ideal model of the cascaded linear induction motor was built, in which the B and C-phase windings are respectively separated from the A-phase winding by a distance of d and e <b>slots</b> <b>pitch</b> and not overlapped. By changing the values of d and e from 1 to 5, we can obtain 20 different modes of three-phase winding with the different combinations of d and e. Then, the air-gap magnetomotive forces of A-, B-, and C-phase windings were calculated by the magnetomotive force theory. According to the transient superposition of magnetomotive forces of A-, B-, and C-phase windings, the theoretical and simulated synthetic fundamental magnetomotive forces under 20 different arrangement modes were obtained. The results show that the synthetic magnetomotive force with d =  2 and e =  4 is close to forward sinusoidal traveling wave and the synthetic magnetomotive force with d =  4 and e =  2 is close to backward sinusoidal traveling wave, and their amplitudes and wave velocities are approximately constant and equal. In both cases, the motor could work normally with a high efficiency, but under other 18 arrangement modes (d =  1, e =  2; d =  1, e =  3; d =  1, e =  4;…), the synthetic magnetomotive force presents obvious pulse vibration and moves with variable velocity, which means that the motor did not work normally and had high energy loss.|$|R

It has aim to obtain the high-precision of DSLIM for the linear slow speed applications. One of limiting factor for precision linear movement is cogging force. The efforts in reducing the cogging action in rotary induction motor has been conducted very well. However, the cogging force reduction in the DSLIM with ladder secondary has not been done before. The DSLIM provide a great advantages for LIM-driven wheel vehicles for specific applications, for example vehicles that are used in over short distances, e. g. at planned stop, switches, or slopes or linear feed axes of machine tools.

The model has a dual purpose, serving first to investigate causes of this effect; secondly to provide predictions suitable for an on-line monitoring scheme. Electromagnetic forces at the stator bofe are represented as tooth-tip forces formed from the integral of Maxwell stress over a <b>slot</b> <b>pitch.</b> Conversion to core-back vibration is by means of transfer coefficients derived from structural finite-element analyses of isolated core models. A simple model, in which the rotor and stator are considered infinitely permeable with sinusoidally distributed sheets of surface current, is used to demonstrate the primary cause of the variation of core vibration: a load-dependent circumferential stress distribution combining with the radial distribution at phase displacements dependent on excitation. This model is insufficient for prediction purposes, hence a more powerful model is developed to take into account slotting and magnetic saturation by means of regions of finite permeability, anisotropic in the slotted zones. The windings are represented by Fourier series of current sheets. This model shows the importance of magnetic saturation; also that the variation of vibration with active load is dependent on rotor slotting. Comparison of predicted vibration levels with test measurements from three machines shows that the absolute level of core-back vibration is pricipally dependent on the support structure.

40|$|High-speed {{permanent}} magnet machines {{are currently being}} developed {{for a number of}} applications including gas-turbine generator sets and machine tools. Due to the high peripheral speed of the rotor and the relatively high conductivity of the magnets used, rotor eddy current loss can be substantial. Quite low levels of loss may present a serious problem if rotor cooling is poor. The accurate calculation of these losses, and appreciation of their dependence on machine parameters, are therefore of great importance for reasons of both efficiency and temperature rise. In this, thesis, a method has been developed to evaluate the asynchronously rotating harmonics with respect to the rotor and to calculate rotor power loss caused by these harmonics. The harmonics are determined by double Fourier analysis of the normal flux density data over the rotor surface. The data is obtained from finite element magnetostatic analysis of the machine at different rotor positions, with all possible harmonic sources present, except rotor induced eddy currents whose effect on harmonics was found to be negligible. Rotor power loss is calculated for each harmonic using a 2 D rectilinear current sheet model of the machine. The magnitude of the current sheet, which is placed on the inner surface of a toothless stator, is adjusted to produce the same magnetostatic normal flux density over the rotor surface as that of the corresponding harmonic. The 2 D current sheet model does not allow for 3 D end effects and magnet segmentation. The accuracy of the analytical rectilinear current sheet model was verified by comparison with a cylindrical FE current sheet model, and by solving a benchmark eddy current problem that can be also solved using FE steady-state AC analysis. The current sheet model was used to calculate rotor loss in a number of generic machines, with two basic types of rotor construction: 1) non-salient rotor with arc shaped surface magnets and 2) salient rotor with chord shaped surface magnets. The results show that rotor loss depends strongly on the ratio of slot opening to <b>slot</b> <b>pitch</b> (s/X.) and on the ratio of total airgap to <b>slot</b> <b>pitch</b> (g/X). For the same fundamental airgap flux density, rotor loss reduces dramatically by increasing airgap length and reducing slot opening. Increasing the number of slots also reduces the loss. The results also show that rotor loss in a generator increases as the power factor moves from lagging to leading due to the armature reaction effect. Using a conducting sleeve, instead of a non-conducting one, with conductivity in the range of practical values, increases rotor losses dramatically. Reducing magnet conductivity reduces rotor loss. Rotor power loss in machines with non-conducting sleeve is concentrated {{on the surface of the}} magnet and a small part on the surface of the hub. In machines with chord shaped magnets, the power loss density can be very high in the parts of the steel hub near the intersection of two poles where local total airgap is small. The harmonics caused by inverter switching in a motor or rectifier switching in an alternator can cause a very significant increase in rotor loss, compared to a machine with a sinusoidal mmf. The results also show that the loss depends strongly on the switching strategy, e. g., switching harmonics in 6 step mmf waveform produce 3 times more loss than a 12 step mmf waveform. Although the developed method for calculation of rotor power loss does not take the effect of magnet peripheral discontinuity or segmentation into account, it is clear that segmentation reduces power loss by interrupting the eddy current return path, specially for harmonics with long wavelengths. The effect of segmentation requires further study. <br/...|$|E

40|$|Fractional <b>pitch</b> <b>slot</b> / pole {{arrangements}} {{are commonly used}} in permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) to significantly reduce cogging torque, however, maximum benefit depends on accurate stator and rotor manufacturing and alignment. This thesis presents a method of identifying the sources of manufacturing induced cogging torque. Decoupling of cogging caused by stator and rotor manufacturing variation is possible due to stator and rotor affected harmonics being independent of one another. A hybrid FEA / analytical method was developed to simulate cogging torque with multiple manufacturing faults induced which proved to be 6 orders of magnitude faster than FEA alone. The new method utilises a library of FEA derived pole transition over single stator slot waveforms which are then assembled in the correct order and phased corresponding to the slot / pole interactions for a given PMSM. Angular and eccentric misalignment can be identified by investigating the presence of first and second order sidebands about the pole and slot harmonics. Static angular misalignment induces first order sidebands around the slot harmonics while dynamic angular misalignment induces sidebands about the pole harmonics. Static eccentricity induces both first and second order sidebands around the slot harmonics, while dynamic eccentricity has {{the same effect on}} the pole harmonics. A ‘Fault Diagnosis Flow Chart’ is presented to identify the manufacturing sources of additional harmonics. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, all combinations of 10 production stators and 10 rotors of 24 slots and 10 poles in an axial flux configuration were experimentally measured and analysed. The stator slot variation and pole misplacement were found to be the largest contributors to unexpected cogging torque. Pole strength variation and static angular misalignment had minor contributions while dynamic angular, static eccentricity and dynamic eccentricity were found to not {{have a significant impact on}} the motors tested...|$|R
40|$|The present {{thesis is}} an {{advanced}} {{contribution to the}} design process of large synchronous generators with high number of poles. It proposes two original contributions, the first one allowing a very precise prediction of the no-load voltage and of the no-load losses in the damper winding, the second one allowing a rigorous calculation of the unbalanced magnetic pulls and of the associated losses in the damper winding {{in the case of}} a machine in eccentricity conditions or with any kind of rotor and stator deformation. Both contributions are based on the same strategy, apart from the fact that it has to be taken into account that the geometry is not the same in both cases, it is supposed perfect in the first case and damaged in the second. The magnetostatic 2 D finite element method (FEM) is used to determine the magnetic coupling of the machine conductors as a function of the rotor position. These values of magnetic coupling are then used in the voltage equations of the machine which are solved using a numerical method. A particularity is the calculation of the magnetic flux coupled with a conductor in two situations, once with only the field winding currents, fixing the levels of saturation, and once with field winding currents and a current in one damper bar. This strategy leads to the concept of differential inductances. The two contributions are different because for the first one the geometric, cyclic periodicity of the machine is of one stator <b>slot</b> <b>pitch</b> and for the damaged machine no short cyclic periodicity can be found. In the first case the values of flux linkage and the inductances necessary for the voltage prediction are therefore calculated only for some rotor positions within one stator <b>slot</b> <b>pitch.</b> These values are then reused for all other rotor positions. This method allows to predict the currents and the losses in the damper winding, as well as the no-load voltage waveform with the same precision as a transient magnetic FEM simulation but reducing the simulation time by a factor of about 20. Comparisons with measurements and with transient magnetic FEM simulations on several operating units prove the precision of this approach. As in the case of the calculation of the unbalanced magnetic pulls and of the associated losses in the damper winding for a machine with damaged geometry one can not take advantage of a short geometric periodicity, the procedure has to be different. Again the magnetic coupling of the different circuits is calculated in advance using the magnetostatic FEM, but in this case without rotation of the rotor. The stator slotting can be neglected because it does not influence the aimed results. Any kind of geometric deformation is represented by contiguous segments, placed on the interior stator surface, which can be displaced radially in both directions. A correct adjustment in time of the air gap value of each segment allows to represent any combination of static and dynamic deformation of the air gap for any position of the rotor. The use of a linear superposition of the linearized influences of all segments on the values of magnetic coupling and on the inductances allows to reduce the number of preliminary magnetostatic FEM calculations to the minimum. It has to be specified that the preliminary magnetostatic 2 D FEM calculations are carried out only once for a given machine. They can then be used for different deformations of the geometry. If one wants to use the transient magnetic 2 D FEM the whole approach has to be repeated for every geometric deformation to be analyzed. The results obtained haven been systematically compared to results obtained through transient magnetic FEM calculations. The agreement is excellent and the reduction of calculation time is enormous. Both contributions were implemented in highly automatized tools; they are therefore well adapted to an industrial application...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the impact of the stator core design for a surface permanent magnet motor (SPMM) on the cogging torque profile. The objective is to show how the cogging torque of this type of motor can be significantly reduced by implementing an original compound technique by skewing stator slots and inserting wedges in the slot openings. Design/methodology/approach – At the beginning generic model of a SPMM is studied. By using FEA, for this idealised assembly, characteristics of cogging and electromagnetic torque are simulated and determined for one period of their change. Afterwards, actual stator design of the original SPMM is described. It is thoroughly investigated and the torque characteristics are compared with the generic ones. While the static torque is slightly decreased, the peak cogging torque is almost doubled and the curve exhibits an uneven profile. The first method for cogging torque reduction is skewing the stator stack. The second technique is to insert wedges of SMC in the slot openings. By using 2 D and 2 1 / 2 D numerical experiment cogging curves are calculated and compared. The best results are achieved by combining the two techniques. The comparative analyses of the motor models show the advantages of the proposed novel stator topology. Findings – It is presented how the peak cogging torque can be substantially decreased due to changes in the stator topology. The constraint is to keep the same stator lamination. By skewing stator stack for one <b>slot</b> <b>pitch</b> 10 ° the peak cogging torque is threefold reduced. The SMC wedges in slot opening decrease the peak cogging almost four times.

40|$|An {{increased}} {{awareness of the environment}} and the growing energy needs of countries like China and India have accelerated the search for sustainable alternatives to fossil fuel energy sources. Generating electricity from ocean waves is a viable alternative. This is because energy densities are sufficient to supplement the grid and thus make it economically viable. The seasonal supply profile also matches the demand profile. There are currently many different devices operating on different principles, the most promising of these is the oscillating body device using a linear generator. Linear generators are able to convert linear motion into electrical energy without the need for intermediate gears, screws or crank shafts. This increases the overall efficiency and makes the device more reliable. Static force simulations were done on a novel linear generator design. The generator combines the duel air-gap of a double sided topology with the encapsulation of the magnetic field in a tubular topology. This results in an increased force density, but also large cogging forces. The cogging forces consist of end-effects cogging forces that are caused by the interaction of the Permanent Magnets (PMs) with the stator ends, as well as cogging forces which are due to the interaction of the PMs and stator slots. The topic of this thesis is to find suitable methods of reducing the cogging forces. The end-effect forces were reduced by changing the stator length and altering the stator ends shape. Creating a quadratic b’ezier curve end shape and optimising the stator length reduced the end-effect cogging force from 630 N to 7 N. The slot cogging forces were reduced by dividing the PMs into two sections and to shift the outer PMs by one <b>slot</b> <b>pitch</b> relative to the inner PMs. This resulted in a decrease from 663 N to 25 N. However, a compromise needs to be made between reducing the cogging forces and not reducing the machine performance. Increasing the stator length increases the machine volume and dividing the magnets reduces the thrust force. This needs {{to be taken into account}} when designing a new machine...|$|E
40|$|A {{single-stage}} transonic {{axial compressor}} {{was equipped with}} a casing treatment (CT), consisting of 3. 5 axial <b>slots</b> per rotor <b>pitch</b> in order to investigate the predicted extension of the stall margin characteristics both numerically and experimentally. Contrary to most other studies the CT was designed especially accounting for an optimized optical access {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the CT, rather than giving maximum benefit in terms of stall margin extension. Part 1 of this two-part contribution describes the experimental investigation of the blade tip interaction with casing treatment using Particle image velocimetry (PIV). The nearly rectangular geometry of the CT cavities allowed a portion of it to be made of quartz glass with curvatures matching the casing. Thus the flow phenomena could be observed with essentially no disturbance caused by the optical access. Two periscope light sheet probes were specifically designed for this application to allow for precise alignment of the laser light sheet at three different radial positions in the rotor passage (87. 5 %, 95 % and 99 %). For the outermost radial position the light sheet probe was placed behind the rotor and aligned to pass the light sheet through the blade tip clearance. It was demonstrated that the PIV technique is capable of providing velocity information of high quality even in the tip clearance region of the rotor blades. The chosen type of smoke-based seeding with very small particles (about 0. 5 µm in diameter) supported data evaluation with high spatial resolution, resulting in a final grid size of 0. 5 x 0. 5 mm. The PIV data base established in this project forms the basis for further detailed evaluations of the flow phenomena present in the transonic compressor stage with CT and allows validation of accompanying CFD calculations using the TRACE code. Based on the combined results of PIV measurements and CFD calculations of the same compressor and CT geometry {{a better understanding of the}} complex flow characteristics can be achieved, as detailed in Part 2 of this paper...|$|R
40|$|This master thesis {{presents}} a comparative {{analysis of the}} starting performance and losses at rated operation for a 15 kW, 4 -pole industrial induction motor, mounted with standard skewed, unskewed and unskewed asymmetrical die-cast aluminium rotors through measurements and simulations. It is a well-known fact that rotor skewing suppresses the synchronous torques at low speeds and also reduces the audible noise of the machine. However, the casting process results in a low resistive path between the rotor bars and the iron laminations, for skewed rotors, this promotes the flow of inter-bar currents. These currents, flowing between the rotorbars, increase the harmonic torques during a start and create additional losses at rated operation. For standard unskewed rotors, these losses are ideally zero, but these rotors may produce high audible noise. Studies have shown that rotors with asymmetrical rotor <b>slot</b> <b>pitch</b> can reduce the audible noise level in unskewed machines. By removing the skew, the inter-bar current losses are suppressed to a negligible level; ultimately increased machine efficiency is obtained. In this work the electrical performance is verified through measurements on the built prototypes. Direct-on-line starts and rated performance for motors with different rotor slot arrangements is simulated using 2 D FEM tool FCSmek. The three prototypes are tested in the laboratory according to IEC 60034 - 2 - 1 standard and the simulation results are in good agreement with the measured results. An additional test for the measurement of high frequency delta connected stator winding currents for each prototype machine is also performed, in order to study the losses induced in the stator winding. Results have shown that by introducing the proposed asymmetry in the rotor slots, the synchronous torques at low speeds are suppressed effectively, thus, improving the starting performance of the asymmetrical rotor compared to the standard unskewed rotor. Additionally, a higher pull-out torque is obtained for the unskewed rotor motor compared to the standard skewed rotor motor. However, the losses {{were more or less}} re-distributed in the unskewed rotor motor, resulting in similar efficiency as the standard skewed rotor motor. One important observation is that; to capture the inter-bar current losses which are estimated to be 5. 5 % of the total losses, requires more accurate methods of measurements than the existing. And sufficient repeatability must be achieved; alternatively one should rely on statistical data obtained from measurements on several number of motors...|$|E
40|$|In {{order that}} the radius and thus ununiform {{structure}} of the teeth and otherelectrical and magnetic parts of the machine may {{be taken into consideration}} the calculation of an axial flux permanent magnet machine is, conventionally, doneby means of 3 D FEM-methods. This calculation procedure, however, requires a lotof time and computer recourses. This study proves that also analytical methods can be applied to perform the calculation successfully. The procedure of the analytical calculation can be summarized into following steps: first the magnet is divided into slices, which makes the calculation for each section individually, and then the parts are submitted to calculation of the final results. It is obvious that using this method can save a lot of designing and calculating time. Thecalculation program is designed to model the magnetic and electrical circuits of surface mounted axial flux permanent magnet synchronous machines in such a way, that it takes into account possible magnetic saturation of the iron parts. Theresult of the calculation is the torque of the motor including the vibrations. The motor geometry and the materials and either the torque or pole angle are defined and the motor can be fed with an arbitrary shape and amplitude of three-phase currents. There are no limits for the size and number of the pole pairs nor for many other factors. The calculation steps and the number of different sections of the magnet are selectable, but the calculation time is strongly depending on this. The results are compared to the measurements of real prototypes. The permanent magnet creates part of the flux in the magnetic circuit. The form and amplitude of the flux density in the air-gap depends on the geometry and material of the magnetic circuit, on the length of the air-gap and remanence flux density of the magnet. Slotting is taken into account by using the Carter factor in the slot opening area. The calculation is simple and fast if the shape of the magnetis a square and has no skew in relation to the stator slots. With a more complicated magnet shape the calculation has to be done in several sections. It is clear that according to the increasing number of sections also the result will become more accurate. In a radial flux motor all sections of the magnets create force with a same radius. In the case of an axial flux motor, each radial section creates force with a different radius and the torque is the sum of these. The magnetic circuit of the motor, consisting of the stator iron, rotor iron, air-gap, magnet and the slot, is modelled with a reluctance net, which considers the saturation of the iron. This means, that several iterations, in which the permeability is updated, has to be done in order to get final results. The motor torque is calculated using the instantaneous linkage flux and stator currents. Flux linkage is called the part of the flux that is created by the permanent magnets and the stator currents passing through the coils in stator teeth. The angle between this flux and the phase currents define the torque created by the magnetic circuit. Due to the winding structure of the stator and in order to limit the leakage flux the slot openings of the stator are normally not made of ferromagnetic material even though, in some cases, semimagnetic slot wedges are used. In the slot opening faces the flux enters the iron almost normally (tangentially with respect to the rotor flux) creating tangential forces in the rotor. This phenomenon iscalled cogging. The flux in the slot opening area on the different sides of theopening and in the different slot openings is not equal and so these forces do not compensate each other. In the calculation it is assumed that the flux entering {{the left side of the}} opening is the component left from the geometrical centre of the slot. This torque component together with the torque component calculated using the Lorenz force make the total torque of the motor. It is easy to assume that when all the magnet edges, where the derivative component of the magnet flux density is at its highest, enter the slot openings at the same time, this will have as a result a considerable cogging torque. To reduce the cogging torquethe magnet edges can be shaped so that they are not parallel to the stator slots, which is the common way to solve the problem. In doing so, the edge may be spread along the whole <b>slot</b> <b>pitch</b> and thus also the high derivative component willbe spread to occur equally along the rotation. Besides forming the magnets theymay also be placed somewhat asymmetric on the rotor surface. The asymmetric distribution can be made in many different ways. All the magnets may have a different deflection of the symmetrical centre point or they can be for example shiftedin pairs. There are some factors that limit the deflection. The first is that the magnets cannot overlap. The magnet shape and the relative width compared to the pole define the deflection in this case. The other factor is that a shifting of the poles limits the maximum torque of the motor. If the edges of adjacent magnets are very close to each other the leakage flux from one pole to the other increases reducing thus the air-gap magnetization. The asymmetric model needs some assumptions and simplifications in order to limit the size of the model and calculation time. The reluctance net is made for symmetric distribution. If the magnets are distributed asymmetrically the flux in the different pole pairs will not be exactly the same. Therefore, the assumption that the flux flows from the edges of the model to the next pole pairs, in the calculation model from one edgeto the other, is not correct. If it were wished for that this fact should be considered in multi-pole pair machines, this would mean that all the poles, in other words the whole machine, should be modelled in reluctance net. The error resulting from this wrong assumption is, nevertheless, irrelevant...|$|E
