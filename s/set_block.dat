50|$|In {{a finite}} {{projective}} plane π of order n, a <b>blocking</b> <b>set</b> {{is a set}} of points of π which every line intersects and which contains no line completely. Under this definition, if B is a <b>blocking</b> <b>set,</b> then complementary set of points, π\B is also a <b>blocking</b> <b>set.</b> A <b>blocking</b> <b>set</b> B is minimal if the removal of any point of B leaves a set which is not a <b>blocking</b> <b>set.</b> A <b>blocking</b> <b>set</b> of smallest size is called a committee.

The proposed method is performed in two phases; the feature extraction phase and classification phase. The K-NN and minimum distance classifiers are used to classify the different types of food grains using color, local and global features. The classification of food grains involves the computation of features locally and globally using the Haralick features and the cumulative histogram respectively. The non-uniformity of RGB color space is eliminated by HSV and YCbCr color space. The good classification accuracy is achieved using both the color models...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the sparse {{least squares problem}} with box {{constraints}} is considered. This problem has the form min lxu kAx Γ bk 2, where some lower/upper bounds may not be present. This type of problem arises from, for example, reconstruction problems in geodesy and tomography. Here methods based on direct factorization methods for sparse matrix computation are explored. Two completely different approaches for solving the problem are discussed and compared, i. e. active set methods and primal-dual interior-point methods. An active <b>set</b> <b>block</b> method suitable for sparse problems is developed and a convergence proof is presented. The interior-point methods compared are all based on Mehrotra's predictor-corrector path following method.

40|$|Abstract – In this paper, {{we propose}} a frame rate up-conversion (FRUC) method using the motion {{compensation}} (MC) based on block matching algorithm (BMA). The {{property of the}} BMA is changed {{by the size of}} block. It is desirable for small moving object to <b>set</b> <b>block</b> size small. On the other hand, we would like to set the block size large in the global motion region. Therefore, the block size is decided depend on the property of the local region of frame image. In this paper, we present a novel FRUC technique based on the motion compensated interpolation with multi-size blocks. At first, the frame image is divided into 8 x 8 blocks and motion vectors are estimated for each 8 x 8 block. Next, the similar motion blocks are merged into one block, up to 32 x 32 block. Thus the proposed method reduces block artifacts and realizes the clear interpolation of moving objects regardless of the size of those...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Multisensor {{recordings}} {{are becoming}} commonplace. When studying functional connectivity between different brain areas using such recordings, one defines regions of interest, and each {{region of interest}} is often characterized by a <b>set</b> (<b>block)</b> of time series. Presently, for two such regions, the interdependence is typically computed by estimating the ordinary coherence for each pair of individual time series and then summing or averaging the results over all such pairs of channels (one from block 1 and other from block 2). The aim {{of this paper is}} to generalize the concept of coherence so that it can be computed for two blocks of non-overlapping time series. This quantity, called block coherence, is first shown mathematically to have properties similar to that of ordinary coherence, and then applied to analyze local field potential recordings from a monkey performing a visuomotor task. It is found that an increase in block coherence between the channels from V 4 region and the channels from prefrontal region in beta band leads to a decrease in response time...|$|E
40|$|In {{public school}} choice, {{students}} with strict preferences {{are assigned to}} schools. Schools are endowed with priorities over students. Incorporating different constraints from applications, priorities are often modeled as choice functions over sets of students. It {{has been argued that}} the most desirable criterion for an assignment is fairness; there should not be a student having justified envy in the following way: he prefers some school to his assigned school and has higher priority than some student who got into that school. Justified envy could cause court cases. We propose the following fairness notion for a set of assignments: a set of assignments is legal if and only if any assignment outside the set has justified envy with some assignment in the set and no two assignments inside the <b>set</b> <b>block</b> each other via justified envy. We show that under very basic conditions on priorities, there always exists a unique legal set of assignments, and that this set has a structure common to the set of fair assignments: (i) it is a lattice and (ii) it satisfies the rural-hospitals theorem. This is the first contribution providing a -wise" solution for many-to-one matching problems where priorities are not necessarily responsive and schools are not active agents...|$|E
