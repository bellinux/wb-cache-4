25|$|In September 1927, King Oliver {{turned down}} a regular booking for his group as the house band at Harlem's Cotton Club; the offer passed to Ellington after Jimmy McHugh {{suggested}} him and Mills arranged an audition. Ellington had to increase from a six to eleven-piece group {{to meet the requirements}} of the Cotton Club's management for the audition, and the engagement finally began on December 4. With a weekly radio broadcast, the Cotton Club's exclusively white and wealthy clientele poured in nightly to <b>see</b> <b>them.</b> <b>At</b> the Cotton Club, Ellington's group performed all the music for the revues, which mixed comedy, dance numbers, vaudeville, burlesque, music, and illegal alcohol. The musical numbers were composed by Jimmy McHugh and the lyrics by Dorothy Fields (later Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler), with some Ellington originals mixed in. (Here he moved in with a dancer, his second wife Mildred Dixon). Weekly radio broadcasts from the club gave Ellington national exposure, while Ellington also recorded Fields-JMcHugh and Fats Waller–Andy Razaf songs.|$|E
25|$|Ronnie and Jack {{decide to}} move to Ongar, Essex, to Roxy's displeasure as Amy would be moving with them, though Ronnie then {{suggests}} that Roxy move to a nearby house in the same town. Roxy suspects that Jack and Honey are having an affair and tells Ronnie, who confronts Jack. He denies this and later, Roxy decides Amy should move without her and then asks Ronnie to adopt Amy. After an emotional discussion, Ronnie agrees but later the sisters secretly plan for Roxy to join the couple in Essex. However, on her wedding day, Roxy packs her things as she reveals she is moving away to live with Glenda and Danny, feeling as if she will ruin Ronnie's happiness. After an argument, Ronnie convinces Roxy to give her away, and she agrees. While {{on the way to}} the wedding, Ronnie and Roxy visit Phil for a final time and take a picture with him, unbeknownst to him that it'll be the last time he'll <b>see</b> <b>them.</b> <b>At</b> the wedding, Roxy begins to break down and says she cannot give Ronnie away and runs out. Ronnie is unable to face Jack and runs off in tears, later revealing she wishes Roxy to move with them and will not accept any other outcome. Jack eventually accepts and they marry after Roxy gives her away. Later, the two sisters get drunk after a happy day and wander outside the hotel; precariously perched on the hotel roof, still drinking champagne, they discuss their time in the square and the start of a new era. Ronnie and Roxy find the hotel swimming pool, and Roxy jumps in. Ronnie is unable to remove her wedding dress and sees Roxy motionless at the bottom of the pool. Ronnie jumps in to rescue her, but is weighed down by her wedding dress and drowns alongside her sister. The following morning, police find their bodies in the pool and inform Jack's brother Max Branning (Jake Wood), who then breaks the news to a devastated Jack. A few days later, Jack receives their wedding video and watches Ronnie saying how much she loves him, and is emotional watching it. Jack later visits her body in the chapel of rest a day before her and Roxy's funerals and says an emotional farewell to her. At the inquest into Ronnie and Roxy's deaths, their deaths are ruled as misadventure.|$|E

500|$|But FIG also {{received}} positive reactions from {{both men and}} women at concerts. Nicols recalled the [...] "dykes" [...] in the audience who had come to <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>at</b> FIG's first performance: they were into disco and soul and sat patiently through the other improvisers, but when FIG came on, [...] "They laughed their heads off." [...] A review in the improvised music magazine Musics said that FIG's set [...] "was a welcome contrast to the previous performances [...] which had been singularly humourless." [...] Lindsay Cooper recalled a comment made to her by a female artist working in film: [...] "I don't know what on earth you're doing but I like it." ...|$|E
500|$|In peacetime, {{the class}} was {{occasionally}} used on fast freights from Southampton Docks, although it was common to <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>at</b> the head of freight and troop trains during the Second World War. Ten [...] "Urie Arthurs" [...] were transferred to the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) in October 1942, and were based at Heaton shed for use on freight and occasional passenger trains in the north east and southern Scotland. They returned to the Southern Railway in July 1943 after the introduction of United States Army Transportation Corps S160 class 2-8-0s into service. From 1945 the King Arthur class regularly deputised for Bulleid’s new Pacifics, which were experiencing poor serviceability due to mechanical failures. The entire class came into British Railways ownership in 1948: they {{could be found in}} most areas of the Southern Region on medium-length expresses and stopping trains on the ex-LSWR mainline.|$|E
500|$|The {{moment that}} Cupid and Psyche are {{revealed}} {{is an example}} of [...] "Keatsian intensity" [...] as they are neither in a state of separation nor are they united; they exist in a state somewhere in between in a similar manner to the figures depicted in Keats's [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn". The narrator's ability to witness the union is unique to Keats's version of the Psyche myth because the lovers in the original story were covered in darkness. However, the narrator questions if he was able to <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>at</b> all or if he was dreaming. This inability of the narrator to know if he was awake is a theme that appears in many of Keats's odes that followed, including [...] "Ode on Indolence", [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn", and [...] "Ode to a Nightingale". Regardless of the narrator's state of consciousness, he is able to relate himself to Cupid as he believes himself to be in love with Psyche, representing the mind.|$|E

500|$|When {{designing}} Dragon Quest, Horii play-tests {{the games}} {{to make certain}} the controls feel right. This includes going into meticulous details such as how fast a page opens or the way a door opens. According to Horii, [...] "... little things like here and there the controls not feeling right and such can really grate the players' nerves if the tempo isn't right." [...] He believes players {{should be able to}} control the game unconsciously, which is not easy to accomplish. Horii tries to design the games {{in such a way that}} players never need to read a manual nor play through a tutorial in order to figure out how to play the game, and tries to create good storylines with short dialogues. Ryutaro Ichimura, who has worked on Dragon Quest titles with Horii since Dragon QuestVIII, has implemented Horii's suggestions even when it is not obvious why his ideas will work. [...] " [...] lot of the time when he [...] points these things out, we cannot <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>at</b> first, but eventually you get it." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{is concern}} in some {{quarters}} that the horses are a negative influence on their habitat, through overgrazing and competition with native species. While exotic species, such as the Namib Desert Horse, are generally unwanted in the Namib-Naukluft Park, the horses are a special case, given their close ties with Namibian history, their popularity with visitors, and their appeal as subjects for case studies of feral horse bands. Studies during 2003 and 2004, however, found that while an area of approximately [...] around the watering area at Garub has {{been affected by the}} horses, there was no significant disturbance of the area outside this radius. The amount and species of vegetation found outside the watering area appear more affected by rainfall then by the horses, probably due to the low population density and natural rotational grazing. Due to the lack of affect on vegetation by horses, it is unlikely that they significantly influence small mammal populations. The horses also appear to have no measurable affect on any vulnerable or endangered plant or animal species, which in several cases are more threatened by human influence. As the horses are restricted to a certain grazing area and native large herbivores are not, the horses do not pose a danger to the latter species. The horses in the Namib Desert were originally known by the local population as [...] "ghost horses", as they mostly stayed away from human habitations and were rarely seen. However, when their grazing grounds were made part of the game reserve, a policy of limited intervention was put in place that encouraged support to be given to the horses when necessary, bringing the horses into closer contact with humans. This also included closer contact with tourists to Namibia, who frequently <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>at</b> the watering area at Garub and near the main road that traverses their grazing grounds. While the horses are credited with bringing tourist dollars to Namibia, there are also concerns about negative horse-human interactions, including vehicle accidents, disruption to sensitive areas by people looking for the horses and disruption of herd dynamics due to becoming too used to or dependent upon humans.|$|E

2500|$|On September 29, Harper {{unveiled}} {{a new tax}} credit plan worth an estimated $150 {{million a year to}} encourage parents to enroll their kids in arts programs like music and drama. The credit will apply on up to $500 of eligible fees for children under 16 who participate in eligible arts activities. Harper said that [...] " [...] spend a lot more on culture and arts" [...] but [...] "in a way that we ensure is an effective use of taxpayers' money and ultimately, in this case, benefits families and all of society as well". Harper has come under criticism when the week before he expressed his opinion that [...] "ordinary working people were unable to relate to taxpayer-subsidized cultural elites when they <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>at</b> a rich gala on television".|$|E
2500|$|A scenic {{overlook}} {{is located}} {{at the north end of}} the bridge and was formerly located at South Thimble Island, near the south end. At South Thimble Island, passing ships may include U.S. Navy warships, nuclear submarines, and aircraft carriers, as well as large cargo vessels and sailing ships. A restaurant and gift shop on the island opened in 1964, along with the [...] Sea Gull Pier. Bluefish, trout, croaker, flounder, and other species have been caught from the pier. Since birds use the habitat created by the bridges and islands of the CBBT, birders have travelled to the bridge–tunnel to <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>at</b> South Thimble Island and the scenic overlook at the north end. As part of the Thimble Shoal Channel Tunnel twinning, the building housing the restaurant and gift shop closed and access to the pier was prohibited starting at the end of September 2017. The building will be demolished and not replaced, and the pier will reopen to the public at the end of the project in 2022.|$|E
