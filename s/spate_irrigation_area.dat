5000|$|Irrigation {{water can}} come from {{groundwater}} (extracted from springs or by using wells), from surface water (withdrawn from rivers, lakes or reservoirs) or from non-conventional sources like treated wastewater, desalinated water, drainage water, or fog collection. A special form of irrigation using surface water is <b>spate</b> <b>irrigation,</b> also called floodwater harvesting. In case of a flood (spate), water is diverted to normally dry river beds (wadis) using a network of dams, gates and channels and spread over large areas. The moisture stored in the soil will be used thereafter to grow crops. <b>Spate</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>areas</b> are in particular located in semi-arid or arid, mountainous regions.

Twenty-five users each, both from traditional and modern <b>spate</b> <b>irrigation</b> schemes, and an equal number of non-users responded to a structured questionnaire.

A field study on the effect of different pre-sowing water application depths on the yield of wheat was conducted during 2006 - 2007. The <b>spate</b> <b>irrigation</b> command <b>areas</b> normally receive the flood water as a result of rainfall on the mountains during the months of July to September, which also carries a significant amount of sediment load. The flood water flows in different torrents and is diverted through earthen bunds to the fields for irrigation with depth of water application ranging from 21 to 73 cm and resulted in sediment deposition of 1. 8 - 3. 6 cm per irrigation. In this study, the effect on wheat yield of three different pre-sowing water application depths (D 1 45 cm) were studied under field conditions. Fifteen fields with field sizes of about 2 - 3 ha were randomly selected, in each field five samples were collected for analysis of soil physical properties, yield and yield components. Five major soil texture classes (silty clay, clay loam, silty clay loam, silt loam and loam) were found in the area with water-holding capacity ranging from 23 % to 36. 3 % (on a volume basis) and bulk density varied from 1. 35 to 1. 42 gcm- 3. About 36 % more grain yield was obtained from loam soil fields, followed by silt loam (24 %) as compared to wheat grown on silty clay soil condition. The maximum wheat grain yield of 3448 kgha- 1 was obtained from fields with water application depths of 30 - 45 cm and the lowest wheat yield was recorded in fields with water application depths greater than 45 cm. On-farm application efficiencies ranged from 22 % to 93 % with an overall average of about 49 %. Due to large and uneven fields, a lot of water is lost. In general, the application efficiency decreased with increasing water application depth. Based on the results of this research, in arid to semi-arid environments, for optimum wheat yield under <b>spate</b> <b>irrigation,</b> the pre-sowing water application depth may be about 30 - 45 cm (September to July) and under or over irrigation should be avoided. <b>Spate</b> <b>irrigation</b> Application efficiency Bulk density Wheat yield Water right and distribution <b>Spate</b> <b>irrigation</b> system...|$|R

A land suitability system for <b>spate</b> <b>irrigation</b> schemes in Eritrea was studied in the Sheeb area of Eritrea with and without land improvements. The availability of floods and soil moisture were the major land use requirements for spate-irrigated sorghum and maize, while salinity hazard has only a minor effect in <b>spate</b> <b>irrigation</b> systems.

40|$|Although <b>spate</b> <b>irrigation</b> {{systems are}} risk-prone, {{they can be}} an {{important}} component for livelihood security in semi-arid areas. Spate uses water (flood water), which upstream users often do not require, as rainfall during these periods is more than sufficient. The use of this flood water for <b>spate</b> <b>irrigation</b> is therefore a good opportunity to convert water with a low opportunity cost to high value water. As more rivers are closing, due to socio-economic and climate changes, <b>spate</b> <b>irrigation</b> may become increasingly relevant in semi-arid <b>areas.</b> <b>Spate</b> <b>irrigation</b> systems pose institutional and technical challenges: collective action is challenged by complex upstream-downstream interactions between users within the system, and the high labour demands for regular reconstruction of temporary diversion weirs and intake structures. This paper describes a <b>spate</b> <b>irrigation</b> system in Makanya village, Tanzania that emerged in response to increased upstream water use. We use three of the four dimensions (hydrological, hydraulic and sociological) of <b>spate</b> <b>irrigation</b> proposed by Van Steenbergen (1997) to assess the Makanya <b>spate</b> <b>irrigation</b> system. The Makanya <b>spate</b> <b>irrigation</b> system has an organisational structure that is similar to the canal irrigation (furrow) committees located upstream, and effectively deals with the institutional demands of managing water in <b>spate</b> <b>irrigation</b> systems. Water allocation is reminiscent to the water sharing arrangements existing in the full irrigation system, which previously was in place at the site and in the high- and midlands of the Makanya catchment and therefore set this system apart from the traditional <b>spate</b> <b>irrigation</b> practice elsewhere. Technically, a major challenge is the reconstruction of the head works after each flood. Another aspect is the changes in the river bed. Flash floods carry sediments that deposit on the fields, raising the elevation of the irrigated land every year and making it increasingly difficult for the river water to enter the plots. Improving system efficiency through modernisation of the diversion and distribution structures in this case is not feasible due to the huge amounts of sediments delivered to the system each year. Instead investments in conjunctive use of groundwater could be the solution because it involves a relatively small intervention, minimises the physical disturbance of the system, and therefore is likely to respect the existing locally developed water management arrangements.

About 14, 000 ha of this 5 million ha area (i. e. < 0. 3 %) has already been developed under a form of <b>spate</b> <b>irrigation</b> known locally as jeriff. This is a water diversion and spreading technique in which wadis (ephemeral streams), springing from Eritrea’s Central Highlands are diverted to irrigate land in the coastal plains. The system as it is applied in Sheeb, an area north-east of Asmara, characterised by agro-pastoral <b>spate</b> <b>irrigation,</b> is described. Under <b>spate</b> <b>irrigation,</b> crop growth is entirely dependent on the residual soil moisture stored in the soil profile. If the basin fields are flooded adequately, the resulting residual soil moisture is sufficient for two or sometimes three crop harvests. The <b>spate</b> <b>irrigation</b> system builds up land by depositing rich sediment on the fields, but therefore, the elevation of the irrigated lands rises every year. Moreover, the system requires huge numbers of trees annually for constructing diversion structures which are subsequently often washed away by heavy floods. In general, the overall <b>irrigation</b> efficiencies of <b>spate</b> schemes are only about 20 % because of the difficulty of controlling floods and because water is lost by percolation, seepage and evaporation. Suggestions are made to improve the system and make it more sustainable: permanent flood diversion and distribution structures should be built to effectively divert the floods and to reduce water loss through percolation and seepage, and the basin fields should be properly levelled to distribute the floodwater uniformly over the entire field...|$|R
40|$|<b>Spate</b> <b>irrigation</b> is {{a complex}} and unique form of water management, which {{represent}} {{the main source of}} irrigation water in semi-arid river catchments. Water is diverted from seasonal rivers by using diversion structures made by stones, earth and brushwood, located within the river bed. The modernisation of <b>spate</b> <b>irrigation</b> realised in Raya Valley (northern Ethiopia) resulted in disappointing performances. One of the main reasons for this failure was the poor consideration of the characteristics of seasonal catchments and local communities’ needs and preferences. Local farmers, who showed a deep knowledge of the river system, were involved only at the level of consultation. The aim of this research was to develop a participatory Diagnostic Analysis (DA) for a traditional non-modernised <b>spate</b> <b>irrigation</b> system in Raya Valley, in order to involve local farmers within the development process, and to build a solid knowledge basis for effective improvements. A Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) of the Harosha <b>spate</b> <b>irrigation</b> system was undertaken.

The <b>spate</b> <b>irrigation</b> practices, among others, include techniques to harvest runoff water, sediments, and nutrients. A strong relationship exists between the SIS in the lowlands of Eritrea and their upper watersheds. For example, the <b>spate</b> <b>irrigation</b> system in the lowlands of Sheeb area entirely depends for water, soils and nutrients on the resources of its upper watershed. Interventions of soil and water conservation practices in the upper watershed could reduce soil loss and sedimentation rates, in the long term. And, this in turn, lowers the quantity of sediments and nutrients harvested in spate irrigated fields of Sheeb. However, the runoff volumes may not be affected much (by such conservation measures) mainly because of the steep topography of the upper watershed with shallow soils, which induces more runoff than infiltration into the soils.

From about 1900 to 2000, farmers harnessed floods with indigenous brushwood and earthen dams. Large floods (> 100 m 3 /s) frequently damaged the structures. In 2000, the Government of Eritrea installed a concrete headwork. The objective was to divert large floods of up to 265 m 3 /s and to irrigate annually all the Wadi Laba fields thereby doubling production. This was done without considering the potential salinity problems. In 2002 and 2003, we determined the salinity of the floodwaters and found that it increased with the flood discharges. For floods that exceed 100 m 3 /s, the average rootzone salinities, estimated for leaching fractions ranging from 0. 1 to 0. 3, could result in yield reductions; particularly for maize the yield reduction ranges from 30 to 100 %. The main conclusion to be drawn from the study is that the water management reforms cannot double crop production (especially of maize) unless the management and allocations of floodwaters takes into account the need to control soil salinity...|$|R
40|$|In the Sheeb area {{in eastern}} Eritrea a Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) {{was carried out}} in two villages, one {{upstream}} and one downstream of the ephemeral rivers Laba and Mai-ule. The objectives of the study were to obtain a better understanding of farmer-managed <b>spate</b> <b>irrigation</b> systems and to enable the local people to perform their own farming system analysis. This paper describes the various PRA activities, such as mapping, diagramming and ranking of problems, that were undertaken with the participation of local people. The resource mapping revealed that lack of water and not scarcity of land is the main constraint affecting the development of the <b>spate</b> <b>irrigation</b> system in the Sheeb area. When {{there is a lack of}} rainfall in the highlands of Eritrea, there are only few floods per year in the Sheeb area. The development trend diagrams showed that the number of floods, the food production and the prevalence of pests vary considerably over time. The livelihood diagrams indicated that food, fodder, and water were only available during part of the year. In search of these resources, the farmers have developed a livelihood strategy of seasonal migration to the highlands of Eritrea. The PRA data collected in the two villages appeared to be very useful for the preparation of community action plans in the entire Sheeb area...|$|R
50|$|<b>Spate</b> <b>Irrigation</b> is {{traditionally}} used system for diverting hill torrents into cultivable command areas for growing seasonal crops. The farming system {{is characterized by}} extreme events of floods and droughts. It usually entails {{the construction of an}} earthen diversion weir across the torrent with large channel on one or both sides of the river to convey flood water across large distances. These earthen diversion structures and water conveyance system has traditionally been constructed by the beneficiaries / communities themselves, making use of traditional technology. Farmers construct field by making embankments from 3 to 6 ft high to store the water depending upon the soil type, share in water and various other factors. Upon drying crops are sown which thrive on the moisture stored in the soil. There is no further irrigation except rains, if any occurs. The economic significance of Rod-Kohi Irrigation agriculture is centered on subsistence agriculture and live-stock raising which are the main sources of income.Another aspect of the <b>Spate</b> <b>Irrigation</b> System of Rod-Kohi areas is the occurrence of the perennial water (known as Kalapani), which is available throughout the year in the upper reaches. It contributes significantly to sustainable farming in the area and used for high value crops like fodder, fruits and vegetables. The development potential in Rod-Kohi Hill torrent areas is listed below.|$|R

Sekampung System has two (2) Feeder Canals, namely Feeder Canal I and II. Feeder Canal I serve four (4) <b>Irrigation</b> <b>areas</b> namely Sekampung Batanghari, Sekampung Bunut, Batanghari Utara, and Raman Utara while the Feeder Canal II serve three (3) <b>irrigation</b> <b>areas</b> namely Bekri, Punggur Utara, and Rumbia Barat.
