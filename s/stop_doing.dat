25|$|The Gender Identity Clinic (GIC) at the National University Hospital quietly {{closed in}} 2001.

25|$|A {{high level}} of {{hypocapnia}} is readily identifiable as it causes dizziness and tingling of the fingers. These extreme symptoms are caused by the increase of blood pH (alkalosis) following the reduction of carbon dioxide, which is required to maintain the acidity of the blood. The absence of any symptoms of hypocapnia is not {{an indication that the}} diver’s carbon dioxide is within safe limits and cannot be taken as an indication that it is therefore safe to dive. Conservative breath-hold divers who hyperventilate but <b>stop</b> <b>doing</b> so before the onset of these symptoms are likely to be already hypocapnic without knowing it.|$|E

500|$|For 1986, Hill {{planned to}} move up to the British Formula Three Championship with title-winning team West Surrey Racing. The loss of {{sponsorship}} from Ricoh, and then {{the death of his}} proposed team-mate Bertrand Fabi in a testing accident, ended Hill's proposed drive. Hill says [...] "When Bert was killed, I took the conscious decision that I wasn't going to <b>stop</b> <b>doing</b> that sort of thing. It's not just competing, it's doing something more exciting. I'm at my fullest skiing, racing or whatever. And I'm more frightened of letting it all slip and reaching 60 and finding I've done nothing." [...] Hill borrowed £100,000 to finance his racing and had a steady first season for Murray Taylor Racing in 1986 before taking a brace of wins in each of the following years for Intersport. He finished third in the 1988 championship.|$|E

500|$|Karen is {{voiced by}} American actress Jill Talley, {{who is also}} the wife of SpongeBob's voice actor, Tom Kenny. Talley uses a Midwestern accent for the character. Whenever Karen talks, her voice is mixed over {{electronic}} sound effects by the series' audio engineers to create a robotic sound. Her voice, which was more monotonous in earlier episodes, has been described as [...] "deadpan" [...] by the Associated Press. Some of Karen's conversations with Plankton are improvised between Talley and Lawrence. The latter described this improvisation as one of his [...] "favorite part of the voice over" [...] in 2009.

500|$|Mr. Lawrence had met Hillenburg {{previously}} on Rocko's Modern Life. When {{working on}} the pilot episode of SpongeBob, Hillenburg invited him to audition {{for all of the}} characters.

This included Plankton, who was initially only set to appear in one episode. Mr. Lawrence recalls that Nickelodeon executives told Hillenburg, [...] "'we could stunt-cast this. You know, we could have Bruce Willis do this voice.' And Steve was just like, 'it's Doug , don't you hear it? This is the character! This is the guy!'" [...] Jill Talley, Tom Kenny's wife, voices Karen Plankton. Being a Chicago native, she uses a Midwestern accent for the character. Electronic sound effects are underlaid by the series' audio engineers to create a robotic sound whenever she speaks. Talley and Mr. Lawrence often improvise Plankton and Karen's dialogue. Lawrence called improvisation his [...] "favorite part of the voice over" [...] in 2009. He elaborated in a 2012 interview, saying, [...] "I always enjoy the back-and-forth.

[...] The Vatican urged its people to boycott the release, saying that it was [...] "morally intolerable". Indian customs officials said that the book offended the country's public morality. The Press Trust of India (PTI), India's domestic news agency, quoted a top customs official as saying the book would be seized under a section of the Customs Act prohibiting entry of indecent literature.
