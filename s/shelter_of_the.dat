In the east at Fox Green and the adjacent stretch of Easy Red, scattered elements of three companies were reduced to half strength by the time they gained the relative safety of the shingle, many of them having crawled the 300 yards (270m) of beach just ahead of the incoming tide. Within 15 minutes of landing at Dog Green on the western end of the beach, A/116 had been cut to pieces, the leaders among the 120 or so casualties, the survivors reduced to seeking cover at the water's edge or behind obstacles.

The Greeks captured the Persian camp, taking many prisoners, and were able to destroy 200 beached Persian triremes. This stunning double victory seems to have greatly demoralised the Persians, and prevented any further Persian campaigning in the Aegean until at least 451 BC. However, the Delian League do not appear to have pressed home their advantage, probably because of other events in the Greek world that required their attention.|$|E

Resolu in particular was struggling to escape the advancing enemy, but Mitchell had realised the danger and was sailing to intercept the French. At 06:30 Houghton, Nonsuch and Vengeur joined with the remainder of Mitchell's force and two hours later Renaud's ships met the British line, Resolu just managing to reach safety in the <b>shelter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> large East Indiamen despite being hit repeatedly in the latter stages of the chase. For an hour the two squadrons continued a general exchange of fire at long-range, before Mitchell turned William Pitt, Houghton and Nonsuch towards the French at 09:30, the latter two both managing to hit Cybèle with destructive broadsides. Firing continued for another 18 minutes as Renaud withdrew, eventually anchoring off the island of Pulau Baby. Neither commander was keen to continue the action, Mitchell fearing that his undermanned ships {{would not be able}} to properly engage the better armed French vessels.

40|$|Dissertação de Mestrado Integrado em Medicina VeterináriaOs animais errantes resultam em problemas de saúde pública, segurança e bem-estar animal, com impactos socioeconómicos relevantes. A natureza e extensão deste problema são notoriamente difíceis de caracterizar. O presente estudo tem por objetivo caracterizar a população de animais errantes e as medidas preventivas e de controlo adotadas pelos Centros de Recolha Oficial na área da Grande Lisboa, em 2011. A fim de atingir o objetivo pretendido, fez-se uma análise comparativa entre a gestão de animais errantes no Centro Oficial de Recolha Animal do Concelho de Odivelas e nos outros Centros de Recolha Oficial da Grande Lisboa, que incluem os municípios da Amadora, Sintra, Oeiras, Cascais, Mafra, Loures, Lisboa e Vila Franca de Xira. A recolha dos dados foi, em Odivelas, realizada com o recurso à base de dados do centro de recolha, e com recurso a questionários aos Médicos Veterinários Municipais responsáveis pelos outros Centros de Recolha Oficial. Estes contemplaram questões relevantes no âmbito desta problemática. Foram recolhidos em 2011 pelos centros da Grande Lisboa um total de 7805 animais das espécies canina (60, 6 %; 4735) e felina (39, 4 %; 3080). Do total de canídeos recolhidos, foram entregues diretamente nas instituições, um total de 2145 animais, sendo a {{principal}} causa de entrega a situação socioeconómica dos seus detentores. A adoção foi o principal destino dos canídeos alojados, quer no centro do município de Odivelas (67, 2 %), quer nos outros municípios (49, 8 %). As diferenças observadas são estatisticamente significativas (p < 0, 05). O principal destino dos gatos recolhidos em 2011 foi a eutanásia (39, 2 %). Foram sujeitos ao Programa de Captura, Esterilização e Recolocação 33, 7 % dos gatos recolhidos nos centros onde esta medida se encontra implementada. Não existe uma solução única para a problemática dos cães e gatos errantes, mas os meios utilizados devem justificar o fim – a salvaguarda da saúde pública e do bem-estar animal. Considera-se que os esforços no âmbito do controlo de animais errantes devem recair, essencialmente, em iniciativas que visem a sua prevenção devendo ser focados dois pontos essenciais: a educação e o controlo reprodutivo. ABSTRACT - Stray Dogs and Cats Control in <b>the</b> Metropolitan area <b>of</b> Lisbon - Stray animals cause several {{problems related to}} public health, safety and animal welfare. <b>The</b> dimension <b>of</b> this problem {{is very hard to}} characterize. The present study aimed to analyze and characterize the stray animals population, as well as control and preventive measures used in official shelters in metropolitan area of Lisbon, in 2011. To achieve the main goal in this study a comparative analysis was made between the official shelter in Odivelas and <b>the</b> other official <b>shelters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metropolitan area <b>of</b> Lisbon towards <b>the</b> different stray animals measures which are used. <b>The</b> other official <b>shelters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metropolitan area <b>of</b> Lisbon include: Amadora, Sintra, Oeiras, Cascais, Mafra, Loures, Lisboa and Vila Franca de Xira. In Odivelas, the data was gathered using <b>the</b> database <b>of</b> <b>the</b> official <b>shelter</b> and in <b>the</b> other official <b>shelters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metropolitan area <b>of</b> Lisbon <b>the</b> data was obtained by doing questionnaires to Municipal Veterinarians. These questionnaires were composed with essential questions related to the stray animals problem. In 2011, in official <b>shelters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metropolitan area <b>of</b> Lisbon were collected a total of 7805 animals both dogs (60. 6 %; 4735) and cats (39. 4 %; 3080). From <b>the</b> total <b>of</b> dogs collected, 2145 animals were delivered in official shelters and the main cause referred were the social and economic situation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> owners. Adoption was <b>the</b> main destiny <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dogs both in official <b>shelter</b> <b>of</b> Odivelas (67. 2 %) and in <b>the</b> other official <b>shelters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metropolitan area <b>of</b> Lisbon (49. 8 %). The differences are statistically significant (p< 0. 05). Only 33. 7 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overall number <b>of</b> cats collected were included in Trap-Neuter-Reuter programs, in the official shelters where this measure is implemented. There is not just one solution to the stray animals problem, however all the measures should achieve the same goal – to guarantee good levels of Public Health and Animal Welfare. It is recommended that all the efforts to solve the stray animals problem must be tied up with activities about prevention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dogs and cats abandon. This prevention is based on two basic principles: education and reproductive control...|$|R

25|$|On 28 January 1915 USRC Unalga became USCGC Unalga {{by virtue}} of the {{establishment}} of the United States Coast Guard by merger of the United States Revenue Cutter Service with the United States Life-Saving Service. In February 1915 additional duties were assigned enforcing the North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911 which related to prohibited pelagic sealing in the Bering Sea. Patrol work during 1915 and 1916 consisted of summers in Alaskan waters with sealing treaty duties, law enforcement, search and rescue, medical assistance to fishermen and others, and the delivery of mail to remote camps. Winters were spent at various locations along the Pacific Northwest coast doing law enforcement patrol work. In January 1917, Unalga was assigned her first winter patrol in Alaskan waters at the urging of representatives of the fishing industry to provide medical services to crews of fishing vessels as well as search and rescue work in remote waters. She stopped in Sitka, Alaska to investigate reports of a measles epidemic and to take on more coal for her first winter mission into the Gulf of Alaska. Unalgas first winter patrol was begun 30 January during a squall with hurricane force winds that iced the cutter over and threaten to sink her with the additional weight. After the starboard whaleboat was smashed by heavy seas and the radio masts snapped from the weight of ice, Captain Frederick Dodge made for the shelter of Yakutat Bay. The cutter was listing starboard at twenty degrees and the crew had to clear ice from the decks and machinery with axes and steam hoses. The crew of Unalga spent the next week repairing damage to the cutter while the surgeon treated the ills of inhabitants of Yakutat and gave the resident missionary a short course in medicine. Each time the cutter would leave the <b>shelter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bay another gale would appear, but Dodge took care to seek shelter before the cutter was as severely iced as the first time. Unalga was recalled to Seattle on 6 March after steaming 3000 miles, boarding 342 vessels, having given medical aid to 19 individuals of whom three were fishermen.|$|E
