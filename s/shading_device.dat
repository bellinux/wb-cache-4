40|$|Rapid growing {{of energy}} use has raised {{critical}} concerns over energy supply difficulties and negative environmental impacts globally and among ASEAN countries. Malaysia {{is experiencing a}} high average annual energy demand growth rate of approximately 2. 3 % which large portion of that energy is used by office buildings. Under the hot-humid climatic conditions in Malaysia, high-rise office buildings with large or fully glazed façades are facing a major problem of overheating due to high solar radiation through the glazed façades. This has caused high cooling energy requirements. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the potential of three types of <b>shading</b> <b>devices</b> on cooling energy savings when applied at different façade orientations. The aim also extends to investigations on different cooling energy savings when <b>shading</b> <b>devices</b> are applied on façade glazing with different configurations and thermal performances. This was done through a case study of a high-rise office building in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia using IES (VE) building thermal simulation software. Twenty simulation building models were applied with different <b>shading</b> <b>devices</b> at different façade orientations and with high and low performance façade glazing. The simulation results indicate that high-rise office buildings in Malaysia use approximately 45. 9 % of total building energy for cooling purposes. The results also suggest that use of various <b>shading</b> <b>devices</b> on low-e double glazed façades will result between 1. 0 % and 3. 4 % annual cooling energy savings, depending on the types of <b>shading</b> <b>devices</b> and façade orientations. The estimated annual cooling energy savings increase to between 5. 0 % and 9. 9 % when the <b>shading</b> <b>devices</b> are applied to all orientations of low-e double glazed façades. The estimated annual cooling energy savings further increase to between 5. 6 % and 10. 4 % when the façade glazing is replaced by single clear glazing. This study recommends prioritizing <b>shading</b> <b>devices</b> on the East and West façades for optimized annual cooling energy savings. The simulation results show that egg-crate shadings are able to produce the highest annual cooling energy savings compared to vertical shadings and horizontal shadings. It is recommended to use <b>shading</b> <b>devices</b> on low performance glazing compared to high performance glazing since the energy savings are more significant when <b>shading</b> <b>devices</b> are used on low performance glazing. In conclusion, the use of <b>shading</b> <b>devices</b> is more effective in achieving cooling energy savings compared to the use of high performance glazing under the hot-humid climate of Malaysia...|$|R
50|$|Though Peters {{had his own}} style, he {{collaborated with}} Wright {{for more than twenty}} years. He based the design of the Louisville complex largely on three of Wright's projects, only one of which was {{actually}} built. Like the Kaden Tower, Wright's never-constructed 1946 sketches for the Sarabhai Calico Mills Store in Ahmedabad, India, had grillwork over the outside windows, a feature that evokes the jali of traditional Mughal architecture. This feature served the dual role of reducing interior solar heat gain while preserving views from interior to exterior (though traditionally jalis also permitted ventilation). Even though Louisville's humid sub-tropical climate has much lower temperatures throughout the year than Ahmedabad's hot semi-arid climate, the exterior cladding still functions as a solar <b>shading</b> <b>device.</b> Peters' design is also evocative of another unbuilt Wright plan, the 40-story Rogers Lacy Hotel. This striking, innovative skyscraper had been commissioned also in 1946 for downtown Dallas, Texas, by oil tycoon Rogers Lacy but was never built due to his untimely death.|$|E

The Solar Shading Project at Lund University was initiated in 1997 to increase the knowledge on <b>shading</b> <b>devices.</b> This paper describes results from an extensive measurement program and recent developments of the software tool ParaSol v 2. 0. The total solar energy transmittance (g-value) of various <b>shading</b> <b>devices</b> has been estimated by means of measurements in a real climate using a double hot-box arrangement.

40|$|Solar {{radiation}} {{passing through}} a window contributes significantly to cooling loads and energy consumption, especially in hot climates. Most CAAD tools handling energy efficient design help designers to define the optimal <b>shading</b> <b>device</b> to protect a window of a certain shape, usually a rectangle, but {{some parts of the}} rectangular window (such as lower corners) are typically difficult to protect. Usually the whole <b>shading</b> <b>device</b> becomes bigger to shade these corners, which over-shades the rest of the window, increasing artificial lighting and heating loads.   It also increases the complexity, visual impact and cost of the <b>shading</b> <b>device.</b>   Changing the shape of the window by cutting these corners may reduce the size of the <b>shading</b> <b>device</b> considerably, which opens way to a different or even a reversed- approach: “Designing the window to fit a <b>shading</b> <b>device</b> instead of designing the <b>shading</b> <b>device</b> to fit the window!” This approach has several potential applications. The building form itself sometimes works implicitly as a <b>shading</b> <b>device.</b> For example, if the building plan shape is a U or L shape, some parts of the walls become shaded, the windows can be placed in these shaded parts, and the window shape can be designed to fit the shadow pattern caused by the building form, changes in the building profile gives similar chances to design windows that fit the shadow pattern. Conceptually, this approach makes energy efficiency a form giving attribute, helping to create innovative facades, while giving an energy efficient configuration for both window and its <b>shading</b> <b>device.</b> CAAD tools can help the designer adopt such an innovative approach, by proposing the window shape that suits an arbitrary <b>shading</b> <b>device</b> created by the designer or a building mass. This paper examines the validity of the approach and introduces the approach required for developing a software module that can be integrated with other CAAD tools such as the Ecotect software.   This would enable the designers to use this approach.

Therefore, forecasting power produced by those kind of PV plants is fundamental for the reliability, safety and stability of the grid, and for the optimization of the design and of the control strategy of such systems. For these reasons, in this project it has been developed a model which represents the dynamic performance of an innovative external <b>shading</b> <b>device,</b> that allows PV integration. First, a suitable model to determinate the incident irradiance over a tilted surface for any day of the year was set, starting from the general solar radiation theory, considering the second order effects provoked by the angular losses and the spectral shift. Consequently, from such irradiance, it has been designed a suitable PV model characterized by a fiveparameter model, which is able to forecast the power generated with a good accuracy level. Such PV model was extended in order to consider shading effects, i. e. non-uniform irradiance over different cells, since the aim was to develop a model able to represent the behavior of a PV array integrated on an external <b>shading</b> <b>device.</b> Furthermore, a suitable optical model was developed to predict the performance of the <b>shading</b> <b>device,</b> with a curved geometry and the possibility to use any combination of surface material. Subsequently, as the idea of the project is to forecast output power for any geometry, it has been designed a case study following a special geometry, which is based on an innovative external <b>shading</b> <b>device</b> designed by the architect Pietro Franchi and the engineer Stefano Rui.

The use of multiple-slat, sufficiently spaced horizontal <b>shading</b> <b>device</b> on the exterior of a facade on appropriately sized window will allow sufficient view out through the window, enables application of daylighting and reduces cooling load. This paper presents results of {{a study on the}} use of such <b>shading</b> <b>device</b> on windows under different combinations of glazing types, ratios of window area to wall area, and with un-insulated and insulated wall. When diffuse daylight from sky is used for daylighting, glazing that allows more daylight penetration is shown to offer a monetary worth of savings on electric lighting over its cost, and the cost of air-conditioning energy when the value of the ratio of window to wall ratio falls within certain range. The net benefit can be optimized at an appropriate ratio of window to wall area. When wall insulation is applied, the benefit is even enhance...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{attempts}} {{to investigate the}} issues pertaining to design, fabrication and application of real-time adaptive systems for building envelopes, and to answer questions raised {{by the idea of}} motion in architecture. The thesis uses the Solar Decathlon Competition as a platform to base all the research and consequently to verify their applications. Photo-voltaic (PV) panels and <b>shading</b> <b>devices</b> are two different components of Georgia Institute of Technology s the Solar Decathlon House, located above the roof, that are based on the concept of Homeostasis or self-regulated optimization. For the PV panels, the objective is to optimize energy production, by controlling their movement to track the changing position of Sun, whereas, the objective for the <b>shading</b> <b>devices</b> is to reduce heating or cooling loads by controlling the position of <b>shading</b> <b>devices,</b> thus controlling direct and diffused heat gains through the roof. To achieve this adaptive feature, it required three layers of operations. First was the design of the mechanics of movement, which tried to achieve the required motion for the PV panels and <b>shading</b> <b>devices</b> by using minimum components and parameters. Second was the design of the individual parts that are consistent with the overall concept of the House. And finally, the third layer is the design of controls that automates the motion of the PV panels and <b>Shading</b> <b>Devices,</b> using a set of sensors that actuate the attached motors. As a final product, there is an attempt to integrate the precision and material efficiency of digital fabrication with the self-regulated optimization of the roof components. M. S.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{numerical}} software, that simulates the building thermal behaviour with complex topology in transient conditions, {{was developed and}} {{used in the study}} of kindergarten thermal response and the occupants' thermal comfort and air quality in Mediterranean conditions. In this numerical model a new building three-dimensional grid generation philosophy, closer to the reality, that considers the building and the surrounding buildings used in the long and short-wave calculus, the external and internal <b>shading</b> <b>devices,</b> the energy and mass balance integral equations philosophy generated by the building geometry, the equation system resolution done by the Runge-Kutta-Felberg with error control and the human thermal comfort level evaluated through human thermo-physiology, are developed. In the simulation, with a real occupation cycle, the compartments, the building opaque bodies, the building transparent bodies, and the external <b>shading</b> <b>devices</b> were considered. In passive strategies the kindergarten is equipped with multiple inclined aluminium <b>shading</b> <b>devices</b> placed above the transparent windows level and in front to the transparent door facing south, removable inclined tissue <b>shading</b> <b>devices</b> placed in front to the transparent windows facing east, and horizontal fabrics <b>shading</b> <b>devices</b> placed above the transparent panel levels facing south, south-west and west. In this study, made with natural and forced ventilation, the summer and winter conditions were used. In summer conditions, the forced ventilation active strategies in all spaces with cold air from the external environment during the night, and in occupied spaces with stored cold air from the underground space were used. In winter conditions forced ventilation from an internal greenhouse, to heat the internal occupied cold spaces, was used...|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of cooling needs and summer comfort in buildings requires an accurate quantification of solar gains through window systems (glazing and solar shading). However, in dynamic thermal simulation tools, the modelling of <b>shading</b> <b>devices</b> is usually simplified: angular dependency of properties is neglected; <b>shading</b> <b>devices</b> are considered as perfect diffuser; internal reflections between the slats of a venetian blind are neglected or considered only as diffuse. In some cases these simplifications bring significant inaccuracies on the {{evaluation of}} solar gains entering the building, and, consequently, on the building thermal behaviour. Bi-directional Scattering Distribution Functions (BSDF) allows a more detailed modelling of materials and systems which enhances the characterisation of the window behavior. The use of these functions {{appears to be an}} appropriate way to consider optical angular properties of <b>shading</b> <b>devices</b> in dynamic thermal simulations: it increases the accuracy of results without requiring excessive computation time. This paper shows and discusses the results obtained when using-directional Scattering Distribution Functions in dynamic thermal simulation, for six common configurations of solar <b>shading</b> <b>devices</b> (external screen and venetian blinds of different characteristics), in comparison with those obtained by simplified modelling methods. The Window 7 software was used to generate BSDF data that were then used as input in the EnergyPlus V 8 building energy simulation program. Results focus on transmitted solar energy through windows (double low E glazing) and cooling needs of a simple office room for the different solar <b>shading</b> <b>devices.</b> In conclusion, this study shows for several solar shading types (and their characteristics), the importance of considering optical angular properties in dynamic thermal simulation and the accuracy gained obtained by BSDF characterisation...|$|R
