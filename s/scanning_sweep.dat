40|$|Three-dimensional (3 -D) {{ultrasound}} imaging {{of the breast}} enables better assessment of diseases than conventional two-dimensional (2 -D) imaging. Free-hand techniques are often used for generating 3 -D data from a sequence of 2 -D slice images. However, the breast deforms substantially during scanning because it is composed primarily of soft tissue. This often causes tissue mis-registration in spatial compounding of multiple <b>scan</b> <b>sweeps.</b> To overcome this problem, in this paper, instead of introducing additional constraints on scanning conditions, we use image processing techniques. We present a fully automatic algorithm for 3 -D nonlinear registration of free-hand ultrasound data. It uses a block matching scheme and local statistics to estimate local tissue deformation. A Bayesian regularization method {{is applied to the}} sample displacement field. The final deformation field is obtained by fitting a B-spline approximating mesh to the sample displacement field. Registration accuracy is evaluated using phantom data and similar registration errors are achieved with (0. 19 mm) and without (0. 16 mm) gaps in the data. Experimental results show that registration is crucial in spatial compounding of different sweeps. The execution time of the method on moderate hardware is sufficiently fast for fairly large research studies...|$|R

Using electronic control of the beam, phased arrays can <b>scan,</b> <b>sweep,</b> steer and focus the ultrasound. Since welds typically produce defects of known character and orientation, phased arrays can be programmed to optimize weld inspections. These inspections include standard ASME-type pulse echo raster scans, zone discrimination, TOFD and “specials”, depending on the vessel, weld profile, geometry and specifications. One advantage of phased arrays is inspection speed: linear travel speeds of up to 100 mm/sec are possible. Sizing is typically performed using diffraction approaches (TOFD and back diffraction), both well suited to phased arrays, {{as well as by}} pulse echo. Results can be obtained shortly after welding. Since phased arrays use preprogrammed set-ups, they are inherently flexible for many different weld and vessel configurations. Lastly, ultrasonics generates no safety hazards, so moving personnel or vessels is unnecessary. This presentation will describe how ultrasonic phased arrays work, what can be done with them, and gives examples of phased array inspection systems for pressure vessels. Examples of inspections on various vessels will include thick-sectioned welds inspected using both electronic raster scans and zone discrimination. Phased arrays are well suited to premium vessel inspections, which require multiple NDE techniques for Fitness-For-Purpose (Engineering Critical Assessment) inspections. Examples will be given of smaller portable phased array weld inspections, with code-compliant procedures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{provide a}} sweep {{coverage}} algorithm for routing mobile sensors that communicate {{with a central}} data sink. This algorithm improves on its predecessors by {{reducing the number of}} unnecessary scans when different points of interest (POIs) have different requirements for the time interval within which they must be <b>scanned</b> (<b>sweep</b> period). Most sweep coverage algorithms seek to minimize the number of sensors required to cover a given collection of POIs. When POIs have different sweep period requirements, existing algorithms will produce solutions in which sensors visit some POIs much more frequently than is necessary. We define this as the POI Over-Coverage problem. In order to address this problem we develop a Periodic Sweep Coverage (PSC) scheme based on a well-known solution to the Periodic Vehicle Routing Problem (PVRP). Our algorithm seeks a route for the mobile sensors that minimizes the number of unnecessary visits to each POI. To verify and test the proposed scheme we implemented a C++ simulation and ran scenarios with a variety of POI topologies (number and distribution of the POIs) and the speed at which sensors could travel. The simulation results show that the PSC algorithm outperforms other sweep coverage algorithms such as CSweep and Vehicle Routing Problem Sweep Coverage (VRPSC) on both the average number of sensors in a solution and in the computational time required to find a solution. Our results also demonstrate that the PSC scheme is more suitable for the sweep coverage scenarios in which higher speed mobile sensors are used...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} iconoscope was noisy, {{had a high}} {{ratio of}} interference to signal, and ultimately gave disappointing results, especially {{when compared to the}} high definition mechanical scanning systems then becoming available. The EMI team under the supervision of Isaac Shoenberg analyzed how the Emitron (or iconoscope) produces an electronic signal and concluded that its real efficiency was only about 5% of the theoretical maximum. This is because secondary electrons released from the mosaic of the charge storage plate when the <b>scanning</b> beam <b>sweeps</b> across it may be attracted back to the positively charged mosaic, thus neutralizing many of the stored charges. Lubszynski, Rodda, and McGee realized that the best solution was to separate the photo-emission function from the charge storage one, and so communicated their results to Zworykin.|$|R

40|$|AbstractPopulation genomic approaches, {{which take}} {{advantages}} of high-throughput genotyping, are powerful yet costly methods to <b>scan</b> for selective <b>sweeps.</b> DNA-pooling strategies {{have been widely}} used for association studies because it is a cost-effective alternative to large-scale individual genotyping. Here, we performed an SNP-MaP (single nucleotide polymorphism microarrays and pooling) analysis using samples from Eurasia to evaluate the efficiency of pooling strategy in genome-wide scans for selection. By conducting simulations of allelotype data, we first demonstrated that the boxplot with average heterozygosity (HET) is a promising method to detect strong selective sweeps with a moderate level of pooling error. Based on this, we used a sliding window analysis of HET to detect the large contiguous regions (LCRs) putatively under selective sweeps from Eurasia datasets. This survey identified 63 LCRs in a European population. These signals were further supported by the integrated haplotype score (iHS) test using HapMap II data. We also confirmed the European-specific signatures of positive selection from several previously identified genes (KEL, TRPV 5, TRPV 6, EPHB 6). In summary, our results not only revealed the high credibility of SNP-MaP strategy in <b>scanning</b> for selective <b>sweeps,</b> but also provided an insight into the population differentiation...|$|R

40|$|In Electronic Support, it is {{well known}} that {{periodic}} search strategies for swept-frequency superheterodyne receivers (SHRs) can cause synchronisation with the radar it seeks to detect. Synchronisation occurs when the periods governing the search strategies of the SHR and radar are commensurate. The result may be that the radar is never detected. This paper considers the synchronisation problem in depth. We find that there are usually a finite number of synchronisation ratios between the radar’s scan period and the SHR’s sweep period. We develop three geometric constructions by which these ratios can be found and we relate them to the Farey series. The ratios may be used to determine the intercept time for any combination of <b>scan</b> and <b>sweep</b> period. This theory can assist the operator of an SHR in selecting a sweep period that minimises the intercept time against a number of radars in a threat emitter list...|$|R

Electrochemical studies were carried out by low <b>sweep</b> rate polarization <b>scans,</b> as well as cyclic voltammetry at different scan rates (1 – 40 mV/s). Polarization <b>scans</b> at <b>sweep</b> rate of 1 mV/s indicate that Bi deposits at about − 25 to − 45 mV while Sn deposits at about − 410 to − 420 mV in the plating bath without additives or with either one of the additives. The addition of HQ suppresses hydrogen evolution to more electronegative potentials, showing its adsorption capabilities. On the other hand, gelatin shifts the deposition potential of Bi and is suggested to have a mild complexing effect with Bi ions. The synergistic effect of both HQ and gelatin reduces the potential gap between Bi and Sn from 429 to 255 mV. Investigations on single metallic Sn and Bi plating baths at varying sweep rates reveal different behavior of Sn and Bi ions. The shifting and broadening of Bi cathodic peak potential upon HQ + gelatin addition suggest the formation of HQ–gelatin complex species.

This approach combines very fast analysis with relatively high sensitivity {{without the need for}} additional reagents or derivatization procedures. The purge-and-trap AVS methodology was used. The sulphide content in the trapping NaOH solution was directly measured by voltammetry with a high scan rate (1000 mV s− 1). The limit of detection (3 σ) was 0. 34 μmol L− 1 for a deposition time of 5 s. Vertical distribution of AVS in sediments was determined in salt marsh sediments of a Portuguese coastal lagoon vegetated with H. portulacoides and correlated to the total dissolved mercury content in pore waters. At the depth of higher root biomass (around 20 cm), AVS concentrations (range 0. 24 – 24. 8 μmol g− 1) were low in comparison to other depths, probably due to modifications in sediments that occur {{in the vicinity of the}} roots. The highest dissolved mercury concentrations (835 and 675 ng L− 1), were found at the surface layer and at 20 cm depth, with an opposite trend from that of AVS. A possible explanation is that root activity reduced AVS concentrations at the depth of higher root biomass and resulted in elevated pore water concentrations of mercury. Concentrations of mercury in pore water from layers above and below the high root biomass were consistently lower (less than 152 ng L− 1) ...|$|R

40|$|A space-filling {{curve is}} a way of mapping the {{discrete}} multi-dimensional space into the one-dimensional space. It acts like a thread that passes through every cell element (or pixel) in the discrete multi-dimensional space so that every cell is visited exactly once. Thus, a space-filling curve imposes a linear order of the cells in the multi-dimensional space. There are numerous kinds of space-filling curves. The difference between such curves is in their way of mapping to the one-dimensional space. Selecting the appropriate curve for any application requires knowledge of the mapping scheme provided by each space-filling curve. Irregularity is proposed as a quantitative measure for the ordering quality imposed by space-filling curve mapping. The lower the irregularity the better the space-filling curve in preserving the order of the discrete multi-dimensional space. Five space-filling curves (the <b>Sweep,</b> <b>Scan,</b> Peano, Gray, and Hilbert) are analyzed with respect to irregularity. Closed formulas are developed to compute the irregularity in any dimension k for a D-dimensional space-filling curve with grid size N.

We present here a population genomic study of a phy-logenetic species in the Neurospora discreta species complex, based on the resequencing of full genomes (~ 37 Mb) for 52 fungal isolates from nine sites in three continents. Population structure analyses revealed two distinct lineages in South–East Asia, and three lin-eages in North America/Europe with a broad longitudinal and latitudinal range and limited admixture between lineages. Genome <b>scans</b> for selective <b>sweeps</b> and comparisons of the genomic landscapes of diversity and recombination provided no support for a role of selection at linked sites on genomic heterogeneity in levels of divergence between lineages. However, demographic inference indicated that the observed genomic heterogeneity in divergence was generated by varying rates of gene flow between lin-eages following a period of isolation. Many putative cases of exchange of genetic material between phylogenetically divergent fungal lineages have been discovered, and our work highlights the quantitative importance of genetic exchanges between more closely related taxa to the evolution of fungal genomes. Our study also supports the role of allo-patric isolation as a driver of diversification in saprobic microbes...|$|R

The model plant Arabidopsis thaliana exemplifies this problem: In spite of the large amounts of data, little evidence for classic selective sweeps has been found. Moreover, {{many aspects of the}} demography are unclear, whichmakes it hard to judge whether the few signals are indeed signs of selection, or false positives caused by demographic events. Here, we focus on Swedish A. thaliana and we find that the demography can be approximated as a two-population model. Careful analysis of the data shows that such a two island model is characterized by a very old split time that significantly predates the last glacial maximum followed by secondary contact with strong migration. We evaluate selection based on this demography and find that this secondary contact model strongly affects the power to detect sweeps. Moreover, it affects the power differently for northern Sweden (more false positives) as compared with southern Sweden (more false negatives). However, even when the demographic history is accounted for, sweep signals in northern Sweden are stronger than in southern Sweden, with little or no positional overlap. Further simulations including the complex demography and selection confirm that this is not compatible with global selection acting on both pop-ulations, and thus can be taken as evidence for local selection within subpopulations of Swedish A. thaliana. This study demonstrates the necessity of combining demographic analyses and <b>sweep</b> <b>scans</b> for the detection of selection...|$|R
