25|$|In {{its final}} years, ASOPA {{introduced}} training for <b>secondary</b> <b>teachers</b> and more specialised administration courses. In 1970 {{there was a}} major change of focus as, with Papua New Guinea independence looming, the Australian Government turned to ASOPA to make good a serious shortage of trained indigenous administrators. The School enrolled up to 60 Papua New Guineans in ten-month management training courses. At the same time, the training of Australians was phased out. In these later years, ASOPA's work became more international. Although Papua New Guinea remained strongly represented, increasing numbers of students came from other developing countries in the Pacific and elsewhere.|$|E
60|$|From {{the mass}} who show a {{satisfactory}} result {{at the end}} of the Schooling process, the functional manhood and womanhood of our peoples have to be developed, and we have now to discuss the nature of the second phase of education, the phase that should be the mental parallel and accompaniment of physical adolescence in all the citizens who are to count for strength in the state. There is a break in the whole development of the human being at this age, and it may very well be paralleled by a break in methods and subjects of instruction. In Great Britain, in the case of the wealthier classes, schooling and puerile discipline is prolonged altogether too far, largely through the gross incapacity of our <b>secondary</b> <b>teachers.</b> These men are unable, boring away day after day, week after week, year after year, with vain repetitions, imbecile breaks and new beginnings, through all the vast period from eleven or twelve until twenty, to achieve that mastery of Latin and Greek which was once the necessary preliminary to education, and which has become at last, through the secular decline in scholastic energy and capacity due to the withdrawal of interest in these studies, the unattainable educational ideal. These classical pedagogues, however, carry the thing up to three or four and twenty in the Universities-- though it is inconceivable that any language spoken since the antediluvian age of leisure, can need more than ten years to learn--and if they could keep the men until forty or fifty they would still be fumbling away at the keys to the room that was ransacked long ago. But with educated men as teachers and practical handbooks to help, and practical examiners to guide them, there is no reason whatever why the great mass of the linguistic training of the citizen, in the use of his own and any other necessary language, should not be done for good and all by fourteen, why he should not have a fairly complete mastery of form and quantity through mathematical training and drawing, and why the way should not be clear and immediate for the development of that adult mental edifice of which this is the foundation.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} extent to which the Ethiopian government’s diversity-oriented policies have been effectively transferred and reflected in the country’s <b>secondary</b> <b>teacher</b> education policies, curricula, and institutional practices using multicultural education as a guiding concept and analytical tool. Teacher education is the focus of analysis based on the assumption that it can be used as a strategy to effectively implement the diversity-oriented policies as it may have a multiplier effect in terms of fostering a better understanding about issues of diversity. In Ethiopia, unlike pre-primary and primary teacher education institutions which accommodate prospective teachers within the respective regional states, <b>secondary</b> <b>teacher</b> education institutions host prospective teachers from all over the country. It is assumed in the study that <b>secondary</b> <b>teacher</b> education can instill knowledge, attitudes and skills necessary to effectively implement issues of diversity. A multilevel analysis research design was used to analyse issues of multicultural education at the <b>secondary</b> <b>teacher</b> education policies, curricula, and institutional levels. Banks’ (1995, 2006, 2010) five dimensions of multicultural education and Banks’ (1993, 2001, 2006) four approaches to the integration of ethnic and multicultural education contents into teacher education curricula were used as analytical frameworks. The sources of data included the Ethiopian constitution, the education and training policy and the cultural policy documents, in general, and the <b>secondary</b> <b>teacher</b> education policy documents and curricula, in particular. The experts who designed the teacher education policies, i. e. the Teacher Education System Overhaul (TESO) and the Postgraduate Diploma in Teaching (PGDT), were also used as sources of information together with <b>secondary</b> <b>teacher</b> education institution officials, teacher educators and prospective teachers. Document analyses, content analyses, questionnaires, and interviews were instruments of data collection. The data were analysed using mixed methods. The results of the study revealed a sporadic and fragmentary treatment of issues of diversity in the <b>secondary</b> <b>teacher</b> education policies, curricula and institutional practices. In other words, the expectation that the Ethiopian government’s diversity-oriented policies have been effectively transferred and reflected in the country’s <b>secondary</b> <b>teacher</b> education system is not realized. It can be concluded that the current Ethiopian <b>secondary</b> <b>teacher</b> education system is not designed in a way which acknowledges the country’s multicultural, multilingual and multiethnic characteristics and/or in line with the diversity-driven policies. Suggestions which are assumed to alleviate these problems are put forward in the study...|$|R
