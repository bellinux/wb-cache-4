40|$|<b>Silkworm</b> <b>silk</b> fibre is {{one kind}} of well {{recognized}} animal fibres for bio-medical engineering and surgical operation applications because of its mechanical, biocompatible and bio-resorbable properties. Recently, the use of natural fibre as reinforcement for bio-polymers to enhance the stiffnesses of scaffolds and bone fixators has been a hot research topic. However, their mechanical and biodegradable properties {{have not yet been}} fully understood by many researchers, scientists and bio-medical engineers although these properties would govern the usefulness of resultant products. Considering the increasing demand and potential use of biodegradable and bioresorbable polymers in coming centuries, elevated environmental awareness of the general public in reducing carbon footprints and non-naturally decomposed solid waste, as well as foreseeable drawbacks of using metallic materials for biomedical engineering, a comprehensive study on the mechanical and materials properties of a <b>silkworm</b> <b>silk</b> fibre reinforced Polylactic acid (PLA) composite is conducted through experimental and theoretical approaches in this project. Current study aims at investigating various properties of degummed and non- degummed <b>silkworm</b> <b>silk</b> fibres and, the effect on the mechanical and thermal properties and biodegradability of their reinforced PLA composites. An extensive review is provided to introduce the properties of the natural fibres and degradable polymers. Some critical issues including poor wettability, biodegradability and bonding properties at the fibre/matrix interface and, damage of the fibre during the manufacturing processes which are the main causes of the reduction of the composites‟ strength are addressed. Furthermore, different manufacturing processes and their suitability for natural fibre composites, based on the materials, mechanical and thermal properties of the fibres and matrics are discussed in detail. The potential applications on the degradable fibre reinforced polymer composites are also addressed. Following the comprehensive review, results obtained from preliminary experimental studies are given. The hybridization of a glass fibre reinforced composite is achieved by using short <b>silkworm</b> <b>silk</b> fibre as a medium to enhance its cross-ply strength. The comparison on the tensile and impact properties of the glass fibre composite reinforced by the short <b>silkworm</b> <b>silk</b> fibre with a neat glass fibre composite sample is conducted. Experimental results indicated that the higher Young's modulus and ductility index (DI) of a <b>silkworm</b> <b>silk</b> fibre reinforced glass fibre composite was obtained as compared with the neat sample. Moreover, the visual examination on drop-weight test samples proved that the impact resistance of the <b>silkworm</b> <b>silk</b> fibre reinforced glass fibre composite was better than that of the neat sample as well. Nevertheless, as the non-fully biodegradable issue rose from the ultilization of glass fabrics and resin, the combination of the <b>silkworm</b> <b>silk</b> fibre and a biodegradable polymer- PLA is chosen for the following study. Mechanical properties of different <b>silkworm</b> <b>silk</b> fibres including Bombyx mori, twisted Bombyx mori, and Tussah silk fibres were investigated. Their ultimate tensile strength, elongation at break, and Young's modulus were examined by performing a uniaxial tensile test on a single fibre. The apparent diameters of the <b>silkworm</b> <b>silk</b> fibres were measured for stress-strain analysis. Based on the experimental results, it was found that Tussah silk fibre has a relatively high extensibility as compared to Bombyx mori silk fibre. When producing a biodegradable <b>silkworm</b> <b>silk</b> fibre reinforced PLA composite, hydrophilic sericin has been found to cause poor interfacial bonding with most polymers and thus, it results in affecting the resultant properties of the composite. Besides, a sericin layer on fibrils surface may also cause an adverse effect toward biocompatibility and hypersensitivity to <b>silkworm</b> <b>silk</b> fibre for implant applications. Therefore, degumming should be done for sericin removal. Different degumming processes and their influences on <b>silkworm</b> <b>silk</b> fibre are discussed. The effectiveness of degumming parameters including degumming time and temperature on Tussah silk by using boiling water are discussed. Based on the results obtained, {{it was found that the}} mechanical properties of Tussah silk are affected by the degumming time due to the change of fibre structure and fibrils alignment. It was also found that the degumming time has a little effect on the thermal properties and the secondary structure of the fibre. Besides, <b>silkworm</b> <b>silk</b> fibre was degummed by different concentrations of NaHCO 3 (Sodium Bicarbonate) solution to study its tensile properties. Measurement of weight loss, tensile property test and differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) analysis were conducted to elucidate the effect of NaHCO 3 to the fibre. Experimental results revealed that the disruption of hydrogen bonds (water effect) dominated the effect of the fibre at low NaHCO 3 concentration. Increasing the concentration of NaHCO 3 resulted in increasing the pH level and thus, distorted the binding force between fibrils of the fibre. DSC analysis revealed that the fibre degummed in the solution over 5 wt% NaHCO 3 requires higher energy for melt and thermal decomposition from their crystalline states. However, using NaHCO 3 would minimize the risk of damage of <b>silkworm</b> <b>silk</b> fibrils as compared with commonly used strong alkali solutions for degumming. A microbond test of the composite was conducted to investigate the bonding effect of the <b>silkworm</b> <b>silk</b> fibre with/ without the sericin layer. The results showed that the fibres degummed by both processes increased the interfacial shear strength. A novel biodegradable composite for biomedical engineering applications was developed by mixing chopped <b>silkworm</b> <b>silk</b> fibre and PLA through the injection moulding process. A study on the mechanical properties and biodegradability of a <b>silkworm</b> <b>silk</b> fibre reinforced PLA composite was conducted. It was found that the Young's and flexural moduli of the composite increased with the use of <b>silkworm</b> <b>silk</b> fibre as reinforcement while their tensile and flexural strengths decreased. This phenomenon is attributed to the disruption of inter- and intra- molecular bonding on the <b>silkworm</b> <b>silk</b> fibre with PLA during the mixing process, and consequent reduction of the strength of the composite. Bio-degradability tests showed that the <b>silkworm</b> <b>silk</b> fibre altered the biodegradable properties of the composite as compared with a pristine PLA sample. The initial storage modulus of the composite increased while its glass transition temperature decreased as compared with the PLA sample. Besides, the coefficient of linear thermal expansions (CLTE) of the composite was reduced by 28 %. This phenomenon was attributed to the fibre-matrix interaction that restricted the mobility of polymer chains to adhere to the fibre surface, and consequently reduced the Tg and CLTE. As compared with the composite, it was found that the degraded composite exhibited lower initial storage modulus, loss modulus and tan delta (Tan(δ)) but the Tg had higher than that of a non-degraded sample. A linear, elastic and isotropic theoretical model to evaluate the differential stress between a core fibre and a sericin layer with different thicknesses of the layer is firstly introduced in this report. The influence of moisture absorption during the early degradation stage, on shear stress between the fibre and the sericin is also discussed. Finally, concluding remarks and the suggestions for the further study in the development of the <b>silkworm</b> <b>silk</b> fibre reinforced PLA composite for fracture bone fixator are addressed. ...|$|E

40|$|Natural silk {{spinning}} {{offers several}} advantages over the synthetic fiber spinning, although {{the underlying mechanisms}} of this process are yet to be fully elucidated. <b>Silkworm</b> <b>silks,</b> specifically B. mori, comprise two main proteins: fibroin, which forms the fiber, and sericin, a coextruded coating {{that acts as a}} matrix in the resulting nonwoven composite cocoon. To date, most studies have focused on fibroin's self-assembly and gelation, with the influence of sericin during spinning receiving little to no attention. This study investigates sericin's effects on the self-assembly of fibroin via their natural phase-separation. Through changes in sample opacity, FTIR, and XRD, we report that increasing sericin concentration retards the time to gelation and β-sheet formation of fibroin, causing it to adopt a Silk I conformation. Such findings have important implications for both the natural silk spinning process and any future industrial applications, suggesting that sericin may be able to induce long-range conformational and stability control in silk fibroin, while being in a separate phase, a factor that would facilitate long-term storage or silk feedstocks...|$|R

40|$|The Achilles tendon {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} damaged tendons in the human body (Hansen et al., 2012). Current surgical and therapeutic techniques require extended recovery time and the tendon is rarely returned to its original healthy state. For athletes in particular, strenuous rehabilitation is required to return from a serious injury like a ruptured Achilles tendon (Rosso et al., 2013). Despite the high amount of sources for grafts to aid in surgical repair, all of the options have drawbacks such as availability, immune response, and/or poor mechanical properties. Spider silk has the potential to enhance current Achilles tendon repair techniques resulting in shorter patient recovery times and improved tendon strength and mobility after repair by allowing for early movement of the damaged tendon, which prevents scar formation and promotes growth (James et al., 2008). For an artificial tendon to be successful, it must have a high enough tensile strength and a modulus that is equal to the native tendon.

40|$|<b>Silkworm</b> <b>silk</b> fibers {{have been}} in use for over 5000 years in {{clothing}} and textiles. These fibers are unwound from the cocoon that is spun by the worm to protect itself during metamorphosis. More recently, spider silk has received {{a significant amount of}} research attention due to its exceptional mechanical properties. Spider silk has a breaking strength comparable to steel (> 1 GPa), and an extensibility closer to nylon (> 30 %), giving it an extremely high toughness (energy to breakage). Unlike silkworms, however, spiders cannot be farmed for mass silk cultivation. Therefore, a tremendous amount of effort has been put forth toward understanding how silk fibers are spun, and how to reproduce them artificially. The problem is two-fold: silk protein must be obtained (generally through dissolution of cocoons) and that protein must be spun into a fiber. All spinning efforts to date have failed to produce native-quality fibers, and it has become apparent that the complexity of the silk gland is crucial to replicate during the spinning process. Furthermore, efforts to process silk proteins have led to the realization that silk protein provides a unique platform material {{for a wide variety of}} biotechnologies.
