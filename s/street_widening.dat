25|$|Increased {{access and}} the culverting of Hackney Brook in 1859–60, {{brought about the}} present road layout. Many older {{buildings}} were pulled down to intensify development and {{to make room for}} <b>street</b> <b>widening</b> and the railway. In 1802 the parish vestry hall on the Narrow Way was rebuilt. In 1900 it was re-faced in stone and given a pediment inscribed 'Hackney Old Town Hall'. A new town hall was built on a different site in 1866; it was in turn superseded by today's Town Hall, built in 1937. By the turn of the 20th century, only St Johns Gardens, and Clapton Square, the areas around the 1791 church, remained as public open space.|$|E
25|$|Years later, the prodigy {{was awarded}} the {{commission}} for a war memorial in Cape Town, to honour the fallen of World War I. The Cenotaph memorial has a sandstone base and columns, with bronze plaques and figures. It features winged Victory holding a laurel wreath, and standing {{on top of a}} globe, a serpent of evil under her feet. The winged figure on the tall central column is flanked by two South African soldiers on shorter columns. The Cenotaph is located on Heerengracht Street. It now commemorates not only the fallen soldiers of World War I, but also World War II and the Korean War. It is the site of the annual Armistice Day wreath-laying ceremony and procession. The Cenotaph was originally unveiled in Adderley Street on 3 August 1924. <b>Street</b> <b>widening</b> in 1959 required that the memorial be moved and reoriented. At that time, additional plaques commemorating the soldiers of World War II and the Korean War were added. The Cenotaph was then unveiled for the second time on 8 November 1959. The Cenotaph was relocated again in 2013, from Adderley Street to Heerengracht Street, {{to make way for a}} new MyCiTi bus station.|$|E
25|$|Plymouth Corporation's first {{venture into}} tramway {{operation}} {{was when it}} took over the failing Plymouth Tramways Company in 1892. Its new Tramway Department continued to operate the routes to Mutley and West Hoe with horse trams, new cars being delivered in 1894 and 1895. The West Hoe line was lengthened a short distance to Pier Street on 11 March 1893. From Mutley the line was extended north from Hyde Park Corner to Compton Lane on 3 April 1893. Next came a connection from Richmond Street along Old Town Street to Market Avenue to give the Mutley line a more convenient town centre terminus. In 1895 a new line was opened from Mutley Plain straight down North Hill, joining up with the flatter route via North Road at a place later known as Spear's Corner in Tavistock Road. The following year saw <b>street</b> <b>widening</b> that allowed {{the opening of the}} short section which the Board of Trade had previously refused to approve. 10 December 1896 a completely new line was opened eastwards from the junction at the bottom of Tavistock Road (now known as Drake's Circus) to Prince Rock.|$|E

25|$|Around 1988 METRO {{proposed}} having Beechnut <b>Street</b> <b>widened.</b> Residents of Meyerland, Maplewood, and Robindell {{appeared before}} the METRO board and protested the plans, stating that they would result in increased traffic. METRO dropped the plans.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, the {{cypresses}} along Cypress Ave. were removed, and the <b>street</b> <b>widened</b> and renamed San Carlos Ave. [...] In 1923 the growing municipality founded a fire station, and in 1925 the founders voted to incorporate.|$|R
25|$|Columbushaus was {{the result}} of a plan by the French retail company Les Galeries Lafayette, whose {{flagship}} store was the legendary Galeries Lafayette in Paris, to open a counterpart in Berlin, on the Grand Hotel Belle Vue's former site, but financial worries made them pull out. Undaunted, the architect, Erich Mendelsohn (1887–1953), erected vast advertising boards around the perimeter of the site, and the revenue generated by these enabled him to proceed with the development anyway. Columbushaus was a ten-storey ultra-modern office building, years ahead of its time, containing Germany's first artificial ventilation system, and whose elegance and clean lines won it much praise. However, despite a Woolworths store on its ground floor, a major travel company housed on the floor above, and a restaurant offering fine views over the city from the top floor, the economic situation of the time meant that it would not be followed by more buildings in that vein: no further redevelopment in the immediate vicinity of Potsdamer Platz occurred prior to World War II, and so Columbushaus would always seem out of place in that location. Nevertheless, its exact position showed that the platz was starting to be opened out: the former hotel had mostly stood on a large flagged area laid out in front of it, indicating that the new building curved away from the existing street line; this would have enabled future <b>street</b> <b>widening</b> to take place.|$|E
2500|$|The {{two types}} of fire barrier zones, [...] and [...] , were created from land vacated by relocation; the former were vacant plazas and the latter widened streets. Additionally, to {{accompany}} the <b>street</b> <b>widening</b> policy, houses were required to remove any eaves. The relocations resulted in an enlarged urban Edo. In 1662 (Kanbun 2), the areas of Ueno, Asakusa and Shiba outside the canals were brought under {{the administration of the}} machi-bugyō.|$|E
2500|$|In Chester, east-west {{streets are}} numbered, while north-south streets carry names. The main {{bisecting}} street, known as The Avenue of the States south of 9th Street and Edgmont Avenue north of it, is signed as both Pennsylvania Route 320 (southbound only; northbound PA Rt. 320 uses adjacent Madison Street to Interstate 95) and Pennsylvania Route 352. North of I-95, State Route 320 follows Providence Avenue. [...] Between 1993 and 2006, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) widened and realigned Pennsylvania Route 291 from Trainer to Eddystone from a two-lane roadway to a five-lane roadway. [...] This widening and realignment project, spearheaded {{by the late}} State Senator Clarence D. Bell of Upland, allows PA Route 291 to maintain at least two travel lanes in each direct between the refinery towns of Marcus Hook and Trainer and the Philadelphia International Airport, as well as promote the riverfront development in the city. [...] Prior to the realignment, which was done first, the roadway followed 2nd Street to Crosby Street, then bore right onto E. 4th <b>Street,</b> <b>widening</b> to four lanes and becoming the [...] "Industrial Highway" [...] in Eddystone. [...] Post-realignment, the road now follows W. 2nd Street to Concord Avenue, becoming the [...] "Industrial Highway" [...] past Concord Avenue and bypassing the Kimberly-Clark (formerly Scott Paper) processing facility.|$|E

50|$|At {{the centre}} of Carnwath is Carnwath Cross, the mercat cross, set back a little where the Main <b>Street</b> <b>widens</b> to form the Market Square. This was erected by the 5th Lord of Somerville in 1516 to {{celebrate}} the granting of burgh status to the village in 1514.|$|R
50|$|Edward I granted Litcham {{the right}} to hold a weekly market, {{but it did not}} thrive and had ceased by 1836. However it has left its mark on the layout of Litcham and is {{probably}} the reason why Church <b>Street</b> <b>widens</b> out so dramatically just below All Saints Church.|$|R
50|$|From Charles Circle, {{the street}} heads further south as a one-way {{southbound}} thoroughfare, and forms the primary commercial {{spine of the}} affluent neighborhood of Beacon Hill.

50|$|The {{two types}} of fire barrier zones, hiyokechi (火除地) and hirokōji (広小路) , were created from land vacated by relocation; the former were vacant plazas and the latter widened streets.

50|$|The street, {{originally}} narrow, was markedly widened from Sixth Avenue to Essex Street in {{the early}} 1930s during construction of the Independent Subway System's Sixth Avenue Line. The <b>street</b> <b>widening</b> involved demolition of buildings {{on both sides of}} the street, resulting in numerous small, empty lots. Although some of these lots have been redeveloped, many of them are now used by vendors, and some have been turned into playgrounds and, more recently, community gardens.|$|E

5000|$|As {{time went}} on, further land and {{property}} was purchased. In 1709 {{a new building}} was erected on Friar Lane. In 1831 the Almshouses on Carrington Street were largely rebuilt. Early in 1909 the 80 years leases of the Nottingham property fell in, the income from that source increasing sevenfold. £17,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] ), was also received from the Nottingham Corporation for land acquired for <b>street</b> <b>widening</b> and taken largely {{out of the ground}} of the almshouses.|$|E
