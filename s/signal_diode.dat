5000|$|Pro Electron {{took the}} popular European coding system in use from around 1934 for valves (tubes), i.e. the Mullard-Philips tube designation, and {{essentially}} re-allocated {{several of the}} rarely used heater designations (first letter of the part number) for semiconductors. The second letter was used {{in a similar way}} to the valves naming convention: [...] "A" [...] for <b>signal</b> <b>diode,</b> [...] "C" [...] for low-power bipolar transistor or triode, [...] "D" [...] for high-power transistor (or triode), and [...] "Y" [...] for rectifier, but other letter designations did not follow the vacuum tube mode so closely.|$|E

5000|$|Note {{that higher}} voltage is {{required}} if the LM386 {{is to be}} used. Therefore, small <b>signal</b> <b>diodes</b> (such as 1N4148) are recommended to create a voltage drop, or use a Zener DC-DC converter with a red LED (in forward, can double as a power indicator) and a resistor (several hundred ohms for 9V operation), as to avoid [...] overvolting the MK484.|$|R

5000|$|To have an output {{high time}} {{shorter than the}} low time (i.e., a duty cycle less than 50%) a fast diode (i.e. 1N4148 <b>signal</b> <b>diode)</b> can be placed in {{parallel}} with R2, with the cathode on the capacitor side. This bypasses R2 during the high part of the cycle so that the high interval depends only on R1 and C, with an adjustment based the voltage drop across the diode. The voltage drop across the diode slows charging on the capacitor so that the high time is a longer than the expected and often-cited ln(2)*R1C = 0.693 R1C.

5000|$|In European {{nomenclature}} a {{first letter}} [...] "E" [...] identifies tubes with heaters {{to be connected}} in parallel to a transformer winding of 6.3V; [...] "U" [...] identifies tubes with heaters to be connected in series across the mains supply, drawing 100 mA; and [...] "P" [...] identifies similar 300 mA series-connected tubes. Following the voltage letter, [...] "A" [...] stands for a low-current (<b>signal)</b> <b>diode</b> section, [...] "B" [...] for a double diode with common cathode section, [...] "C" [...] for a triode section, [...] "F" [...] for a pentode section, [...] "H" [...] for a hexode or heptode section, and [...] "L" [...] for a power tetrode or pentode section. The first number identified the base type, for example 3 for Octal base; 9 for B7G sub-miniature 7 pin. The remaining numbers identified a particular tube type; tubes with all characters except the first identical had identical electrodes but a different heater; e.g. the EBC81 and UBC81. Generally, odd numbers identified tubes / valves with variable mu characteristics and even numbers straight, or sharp cut-off types.|$|E

The usefulness of the arrangement as a phase modulator for microwave carriers is demonstrated.

The observations can be explained {{on the basis of the}} capacitance variation of the barrier layer with forward current in the diode. It is well known that point contact diodes can be used as waveguide switches '- 5. But the action of a point-contact diode in the forward-bias condition as a phase shifter of microwave signal is not mentioned in literature. In this communication, we report the properties of such a simple and effective electronic phase modulator at microwave frequencies.

25|$|The {{first use}} for the diode was the {{demodulation}} of amplitude modulated (AM) radio broadcasts. The history of this discovery is treated in depth in the radio article. In summary, an AM signal consists of alternating positive and negative peaks of a radio carrier wave, whose amplitude or envelope {{is proportional to the}} original audio <b>signal.</b> The <b>diode</b> (originally a crystal diode) rectifies the AM radio frequency signal, leaving only the positive peaks of the carrier wave.

40|$|Information {{processing}} with an excitable chemical medium, {{like the}} Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction, is typically {{based on information}} coding in {{the presence or absence}} of excitation pulses. Here we present a new concept of Boolean coding that can be applied to an oscillatory medium. A medium represents the logical TRUE state if a selected region oscillates with a high frequency. If the frequency fails below a specified value, it represents the logical FALSE state. We consider a medium composed of disks encapsulating an oscillatory mixture of reagents, as related to our recent experiments with lipid-coated BZ droplets. We demonstrate that by using specific geometrical arrangements of disks containing the oscillatory medium one can perform logical operations on variables coded in oscillation frequency. Realizations of a chemical <b>signal</b> <b>diode</b> and of a single-bit memory with oscillatory disks are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Nonlinear {{chemical}} medium {{can be used}} {{to perform}} information processing functions. In typical applications information is coded in excitation pulses and required operations are performed by interac- tion of pulses forced by intentionally introduced geometrical structure of the medium. Here we describe a structured system that seems promising for information processing. It is composed of droplets, cov- ered with a lipid layer, that contain reagents of Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction. The presence of lipids stabilizes the droplets so they do not merge in time scale much longer than that characteristic for chemical phenomena. On the basis of experimental results for period of os- cillations within droplets we fit parameters of Rovinsky-Zhabotinsky model that qualitatively describes system evolution. This model for oscillations is used to predict the experimental conditions at which the medium becomes excitable and estimate the size of droplets for which a chemical <b>signal</b> <b>diode</b> can be constructed...|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} a highly {{efficient}} spin diode effect in an exchange-biased spin-valve giant magnetoresistance (GMR) strips. In such multilayer structures, symmetry of the current distribution along the vertical direction is broken and, as a result, a non-compensated Oersted field acting on the magnetic free layer appears. This field, in turn, is a driving force of magnetization precessions. Due to the GMR effect, resistance of the strip oscillates following the magnetization dynamics. This leads to rectification of the applied radio frequency current and induces a direct current voltage $V_{DC}$. We present a theoretical description of this phenomenon and calculate the spin <b>diode</b> <b>signal,</b> $V_{DC}$, {{as a function of}} frequency, external magnetic field, and angle at which the external field is applied. A satisfactory quantitative agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental data has been achieved. Finally, we show that the spin <b>diode</b> <b>signal</b> in GMR devices is significantly stronger than in the anisotropic magnetoresistance permalloy-based devices.

40|$|Control {{techniques}} for {{high power factor}} rectifiers which do not need input voltage sensing are gaining considerable attention due to their simpler implementation and inherently superior stability, as compared to conventional average or peak current mode control. Among these, the solutions based on integration of a current <b>signal</b> (switch, <b>diode</b> or inductor current) provide an inherent noise immunity, which makes them further appealing. This paper proposes a simple implementation of one of such control {{techniques for}} high power factor flyback, Cuk or Sepic rectifiers, which, while still retaining a high power factor, further reduces the control complexity, thus making the solution very attractive for smart-power integration. A 200 W flyback rectifier with the proposed control technique was implemented and tested. The achieved results are in good agreement with the expected performance...|$|R
50|$|An {{envelope}} detector is an electronic circuit {{that takes a}} high-frequency signal as input and provides an output which is the envelope of the original signal. The capacitor in the circuit stores up charge on the rising edge, and releases it slowly through the resistor when the <b>signal</b> falls. The <b>diode</b> in series rectifies the incoming signal, allowing current flow only when the positive input terminal is at a higher potential than the negative input terminal.|$|R
50|$|This basic {{configuration}} {{has a problem}} {{so it is not}} commonly used. When the input becomes (even slightly) negative, the operational amplifier runs open loop, as there is no feedback <b>signal</b> through the <b>diode.</b> With a typical high open loop gain operational amplifier, the output saturates. If the input then becomes positive again, the op-amp has {{to get out of the}} saturated state before positive amplification can take place again. This change generates some ringing and takes some time, greatly reducing the frequency response of the circuit.|$|R

In this paper, the analog backscatter using multiple time-spaced spike signals, which carry information of its identification and the sensor in their time separations is presented. A solar-cell powered spike generation circuit is designed and delay elements are used with the spike generator to encode the information of the identification and sensor. An HSMS 2852 small <b>signal</b> Schottky <b>diode</b> is used for analog spike backscattering.
