It is assumed that the charge-voltage characteristics of the reactances are polynomials. In addition certain conditions for the frequency bands of the signals must be met. By contrast with the Manley-Rowe relations integrals with respect to frequency appear instead of the ratios power over frequency.

40|$|Magnetic {{turbulence}} in {{the solar}} wind is treated {{from the point of}} view of electrodynamics. This can be done based on the use of Poynting's theorem attributing all turbulent dynamics to the spectrum of turbulent conductivity. For two directions of propagation of the turbulent fluctuations of the electromagnetic field with respect to the mean plus external magnetic fields an expression is constructed for the spectrum of turbulent dissipation. Use of solar wind observations of electromagnetic power spectral densities in the inertial subrange then allows determination of the conductivity spectrum, the dissipative response function, in this range. It requires observations of the complete electromagnetic <b>spectral</b> <b>energy</b> <b>densities</b> including electric power spectral densities. The dissipative response function and dispersion relation of solar wind inertial range magnetic turbulence are obtained. The dispersion relation indicates the spatial scale decay with increasing frequency providing independent support for the use of Taylor's hypothesis. The dissipation function indicates an approximate shot-noise spectrum of turbulent resistivity in the inertial range suggesting progressive structure formation in the inertial range which hints on the presence of discrete mode turbulence and nonlinear resonances.

40|$|We treat {{transformation}} {{properties of}} external radiation {{fields in the}} proper frame of a plasma moving with constant speed. The specific <b>spectral</b> <b>energy</b> <b>densities</b> of external isotropic and accretion-disk radiation fields are derived in the comoving frame of relativistic outflows, such as those thought to be found near black-hole jet and gamma-ray burst sources. Nonthermal electrons and positrons Compton-scatter this radiation field, and high-energy protons and ions interact with this field through photomeson and photopair production. We revisit {{the problem of the}} Compton-scattered spectrum associated with an external accretion-disk radiation field, and clarify a past treatment by the authors. Simple expressions for energy-loss rates and Thomson-scattered spectra are given for ambient soft photon fields consisting either of a surrounding external isotropic monochromatic radiation field, or of an azimuthally symmetric, geometrically thin accretion-disk radiation field. A model for blazar emission is presented that displays a characteristic spectral and variability behavior due to the presence of a direct accretion-disk component. The disk component and distinct flaring behavior can be bright enough to be detected from flat spectrum radio quasars with GLAST. Spectral states of blazars are characterized by the relative importance of the accretion-disk and scattered radiation fields and, in the extended jet, by the accretion disk, inner jet, and cosmic microwave background radiation fields.

40|$|In {{hydrodynamic}} turbulence, it is {{well established}} that {{the length of the}} dissipation scale depends on the energy cascade rate, i. e., the larger the energy input rate per unit mass, the more the turbulent fluctuations need to be driven to increasingly smaller scales to dissipate the larger energy flux. Observations of magnetic <b>spectral</b> <b>energy</b> <b>densities</b> indicate that this intuitive picture is not valid in solar wind turbulence. Dissipation seems to set in at the same length scale for different solar wind conditions independently of the energy flux. To investigate this difference in more detail, we present an analytic dissipation model for solar wind turbulence at electron scales, which we compare with observed spectral densities. Our model combines the energy transport from large to small scales and collisionless damping, which removes energy from the magnetic fluctuations in the kinetic regime. We assume wave-particle interactions of kinetic Alfvén waves (KAW) to be the main damping process. Wave frequencies and damping rates of KAW are obtained from the hot plasma dispersion relation. Our model assumes a critically balanced turbulence, where larger energy cascade rates excite larger parallel wavenumbers for a certain perpendicular wavenumber. If the dissipation is additionally wave driven such that the dissipation rate is proportional to the parallel wavenumber - as with KAW - then an increase of the energy cascade rate is counter-balanced by an increased dissipation rate for the same perpendicular wavenumber leading to a dissipation length independent of the energy cascade rate...|$|R
40|$|Monitoring seismic {{activity}} in mines, produced by high stress faults {{in the vicinity}} of mining operations, is an important issue for mine planning. A seismic event produces a short–time duration acoustic pressure wave that travels through the rock. This low-energy {{seismic activity}} in mines is typically referred to as microseismic events. The location of a microseismic event is very important for mine planning since these events indicate unstable areas. Their location can be estimated using the pressure wave signals recorded at a set of sensors distributed throughout the mine. One method of localization searches over a grid of hypothesized source locations to find the one that best explains the observered measurements. The expression for the variance of error of this method depends upon the <b>energy</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>density</b> of the sensor signal.
