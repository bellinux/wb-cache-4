Essential oils were obtained from three sweet orange varieties, one bitter orange and one <b>lemon</b> <b>variety.</b> Yield, chemical composition and toxicity against neonates of the Mediterranean fruit fly were determined. Based on chemical analysis, the toxicity of commercially purchased major and minor components (monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes) of {{essential oils}} was determined. In addition, fractions were prepared to evaluate the role of minor components in the toxicity of crude essential oils. Limonene {{was by far the}} most abundant ingredient (96. 2 - 97. 4 %) in all sweet orange varieties and in bitter orange, while the concentration of limonene was much lower in lemon essential oils (74. 3 %). Orange and bitter orange essential oils were more toxic than lemon essential oils. The toxicity of orange and bitter orange essential oils was similar to that of their major component limonene. In tests of commercially purchased chemicals, the oxygenated components of essential oils were more toxic than hydrocarbons but their low concentration in citrus essential oils could not affect the toxic activity of essential oils. The presence of alpha-pinene and beta-pinene seems to account for the lower toxicity of lemon essential oils in relation to other citrus essential oils.

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 Lemon oil {{quality is}} {{affected}} by numerous factors including <b>lemon</b> <b>variety,</b> climate, soil type, extraction method, etc [...] Therefore, quality largely depends upon the lemons' origin, and aroma profiles of oils obtained throughout the world have potential to vary considerably. This research was conducted to identify differences in the aroma profiles of lemon oil samples {{from a variety of}} sources (Argentina, Brazil, California coast, California desert, Spain, South Africa). Two sensory methods commonly used to identify such differences are descriptive analysis and gas chromatography/olfactometry (GCO). A trained sensory panel identified significant differences (p< 0. 05) in the aroma profiles of the nine tested lemon oils in terms of overall intensity, peel, lime, orange, and sweet aromas. While descriptive analysis is useful in identifying perceived product differences, it does not provide information regarding the chemical components responsible for product differences. GCO is an effective method for identifying a flavor system's important odorants and their odor quality, but there are numerous methods by which it may be performed. Two different GCO methods, Osme and aroma extract dilution analysis with flavor dilution (FD) factors, were used to analyze cold-pressed lemon oil, and results obtained from each method were compared. Conclusions drawn from each method regarding the most critical odorants were slightly different, and better agreement among subjects was found to be present with Osme. Upon concluding that Osme provides a less variable method of identifying critical odorants, the relationship between Osme and descriptive analysis data was examined to determine if samples were characterized similarly by both sensory methods. Considerable agreement between methods was evident. In addition, neral, geranial, limonene, linalool, and gamma-terpinene were identified as important base contributors to lemon oil aroma...|$|R

30|$|Not {{only the}} organic red paints have been {{susceptible}} to light induced color change. Also chrome yellow {{is known to}} be prone to darkening or browning due to photochemical reduction of the pigment. This concerns especially the sulphate-rich, orthorhombic variety of the pigment; the monoclinic lead chromate variety appears to be much more lightfast [49 – 51]. However, in Field with Irises near Arles it is striking that especially the presumed pure lead chromate yellow buttercups in the foreground turned brown. Microscopic examination showed spotty remnants of material deposited on top of the bright yellow paint, concentrated in the hollows of impasto. This indicates that in this case the color change is not so much caused by light induced surface darkening of the pigment, but rather that external factors play a role, as brown remnants of restoration materials seem to have become embedded in the softened surface of the paint. 10 Van Gogh probably used at least two different types of chrome yellow in Field with Irises near Arles: almost pure lead chromate (PbCrO 4), which is medium yellow in color, and a more <b>lemon</b> yellow <b>variety</b> with approximately equal amounts of sulphate to chromate (PbCr 0.5 S 0.5 O 4). 11 For the paint reconstructions lead(II) chromate (PbCrO 4) was purchased from Aldrich (≥[*] 98 %).

40|$|We studied, under {{laboratory}} conditions, demographic {{parameters of}} adult Mediterranean fruit flies, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tephritidae) (medfly), obtained from three sweet orange <b>varieties,</b> <b>lemon,</b> and bitter oranges. These data were combined with immature developmental rates and survival {{on the same}} hosts to estimate host-specific population parameters. Pairs of newly emerged adults from each citrus variety were held individually in transparent plastic cages, and females were allowed to oviposit in either red domes (artificial, pre-punctured plastic oviposition devices), or intact, whole citrus fruits. We found strong effects of larval host (citrus fruits) on adult longevity and fecundity. In all five citrus varieties, females did not manage to deposit eggs into fruit pulp. The proportion of eggs laid in either the flavedo or albedo area of the fruit peel differed depending on the citrus variety. In all cases except bitter oranges, females oviposited fewer eggs in citrus fruits than in the artificial oviposition substrates, suggesting that most citrus fruits cause {{a significant reduction in}} the reproductive potential of medflies. Negative correlations were found between fecundity and (a) the density of oil glands, and (b) the amount of essential oils in the flavedo area of citrus fruits. There was no correlation between fecundity and other fruit physical characteristics, such as resistance of fruit peel to pressure and thickness of the flavedo. Apparently, resistance of citrus fruits to medfly infestation is directly related to citrus essential oils. The intrinsic rate of increase (r) was higher in bitter oranges than in the three sweet orange varieties tested. A negative r was estimated for flies that developed and oviposited in lemons, indicating a tendency for population decrease in this host. The suitability of citrus fruits for medfly development and the practical implications of our findings for management of medflies in citrus orchards are discussed...|$|R
500|$|The common {{starling}} is [...] long, with a wingspan of [...] and {{a weight}} of [...] Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the culmen is [...] and the tarsus is [...] The plumage is iridescent black, glossed purple or green, and spangled with white, especially in winter. The underparts of adult male common starlings are less spotted {{than those of}} adult females {{at a given time}} of year. The throat feathers of males are long and loose and are used in display while those of females are smaller and more pointed. The legs are stout and pinkish- or greyish-red. The bill is narrow and conical with a sharp tip; in the winter it is brownish-black but in <b>summer,</b> females have <b>lemon</b> yellow beaks while males have yellow bills with blue-grey bases. Moulting occurs once a year- in late summer after the breeding season has finished; the fresh feathers are prominently tipped white (breast feathers) or buff (wing and back feathers), which gives the bird a speckled appearance. The reduction in the spotting in the breeding season is achieved through the white feather tips largely wearing off. Juveniles are grey-brown and by their first winter resemble adults though often retaining some brown juvenile feathering, especially on the head. They can usually be sexed by the colour of the irises, rich brown in males, mouse-brown or grey in females. Estimating the contrast between an iris and the central always-dark pupil is 97% accurate in determining sex, rising to 98% if the length of the throat feathers is also considered. The common starling is mid-sized by both starling standards and passerine standards. It is readily distinguished from other mid-sized passerines, such as thrushes, icterids or small corvids, by its relatively short tail, sharp, blade-like bill, round-bellied shape and strong, sizeable (and rufous-coloured) legs. In flight, its strongly pointed wings and dark colouration are distinctive, while on the ground its strange, somewhat waddling gait is also characteristic.

Os tratamentos foram estabelecidos em função da Capacidade de Campo (CC) e da fração de esgotamento de água (p) do solo, como segue: T 1 = 25 %CC (p= 0, 25); T 2 = 40 %CC (p= 0, 40); T 3 = 55 %CC (p= 0, 55); T 4 = 70 %CC (p= 0, 70). Decorridos 60 dias da indução ao estresse, realizou-se a colonização das mudas com 25 ácaros infectados e não infectados com o vírus da leprose, procedentes de uma criação sobre frutos com e sem lesões da doença. Os ácaros permaneceram colonizando às plantas por 55 dias, findos os quais, avaliou-se, em laboratório, sua população, contando-se o número de ovos, larvas, ninfas e adultos. Durante a colonização do B. phoenicis, avaliaram-se os sintomas da leprose, iniciando-se 21 dias após a colonização das plantas, e a intervalos de 7 dias. Empregou-se uma escala de notas visual para avaliar a severidade da leprose com base no número de lesões de leprose nos ramos, folhas e desfolha. Conclui-se que a disponibilidade de água para a planta influencia no desenvolvimento de B. phoenicis, visto que, em plantas submetidas a 25 %CC, o número de ácaros foi maior que nos demais regimes hídricos, decrescendo à medida que a disponibilidade de água foi maior, atingindo seu menor índice populacional aos 70 %CC. Em relação à severidade da leprose, as plantas submetidas a 25 e 40 %CC obtiveram notas mais altas, evidenciando maior suscetibilidade [...] . It was assessed, in greenhouse, the {{interaction}} of the leprosis mite Brevipalpus phoenicis with orange plants Pêra grafted on <b>lemon</b> Cravo <b>variety</b> and on tangerines Cleopatra and Sunki, with about 9 months old, submitted on different condition of water deficits and mite infestation. The treatments were determinate in a function of both, Field Capacity (CC) and soil water drain fraction (p), as this: T 1 = 25 %CC (p= 0, 25); T 2 = 40 %CC (p= 0, 40); T 3 = 55 %CC (p= 0, 55); T 4 = 70 %CC (p= 0, 70). After 60 days of stress induction, was made the colonization of plants with 25 mites that were reared on oranges with and without leprosis symptoms. The mites stayed in the plants for 55 days, after what, its population, counting the number of eggs, grub, nymphs and adults were assessed, in laboratory. During the B. phoenicis colonization, were assessed the leprosis symptoms, starting 21 days after the plants colonization, at intervals of 7 days. To this was used a notes ranking basing in the number of leprosies symptoms in the branches, leaves and desfoliate. Was concluded that the water availability had influence in B. phoenicis development, foundation that the plants submitted on 25 %CC, had mite population higher than the others treatments, decreasing with the increase water availability, hitting the lowest population index on 70 %CC. In relation with leprosis symptoms, plants submitted on 25 and 40 %CC had the highest notes, evidencing more susceptibility of this plants to the disease and faster evolution of the symptoms. The rootstock Cravo and Cleopatra were more susceptible to the mite, showing the biggest population, 134, 8 and 125, 9 mites respectively, while Sunki showed the lowest population [...] .

50|$|The common {{starling}} is 19 - 23 cm long, with a wingspan of 31 - 44 cm and {{a weight}} of 58 - 101 g. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 11.8 to 13.8 cm, the tail is 5.8 to 6.8 cm, the culmen is 2.5 to 3.2 cm and the tarsus is 2.7 to 3.2 cm. The plumage is iridescent black, glossed purple or green, and spangled with white, especially in winter. The underparts of adult male common starlings are less spotted {{than those of}} adult females {{at a given time}} of year. The throat feathers of males are long and loose and are used in display while those of females are smaller and more pointed. The legs are stout and pinkish- or greyish-red. The bill is narrow and conical with a sharp tip; in the winter it is brownish-black but in <b>summer,</b> females have <b>lemon</b> yellow beaks while males have yellow bills with blue-grey bases. Moulting occurs once a year- in late summer after the breeding season has finished; the fresh feathers are prominently tipped white (breast feathers) or buff (wing and back feathers), which gives the bird a speckled appearance. The reduction in the spotting in the breeding season is achieved through the white feather tips largely wearing off. Juveniles are grey-brown and by their first winter resemble adults though often retaining some brown juvenile feathering, especially on the head. They can usually be sexed by the colour of the irises, rich brown in males, mouse-brown or grey in females. Estimating the contrast between an iris and the central always-dark pupil is 97% accurate in determining sex, rising to 98% if the length of the throat feathers is also considered. The common starling is mid-sized by both starling standards and passerine standards. It is readily distinguished from other mid-sized passerines, such as thrushes, icterids or small corvids, by its relatively short tail, sharp, blade-like bill, round-bellied shape and strong, sizeable (and rufous-coloured) legs. In flight, its strongly pointed wings and dark colouration are distinctive, while on the ground its strange, somewhat waddling gait is also characteristic. The colouring and build usually distinguish this bird from other starlings, although the closely related spotless starling may be physically distinguished by the lack of iridescent spots in adult breeding plumage.|$|R
