The show began with Gaga appearing behind a giant, green laser lit video screen featuring <b>scrim</b> lights, in a futuristic silver jewelled jumpsuit with bulbs on it. She had matching eye makeup {{and wore a}} mask, beginning to sing [...] "Dance in the Dark", [...] "while dancers dressed in white balaclavas and white jumpsuits moved around her." [...] The <b>scrim</b> resembled an electric math grid which was lifted during the performance. Jane Stevenson from Toronto Sun {{felt that it was}} not until Gaga had moved on to the next song after [...] "Dance in the Dark", that the Monster Ball [...] "was alive". In the revamped 2010-11 shows of The Monster Ball tour, the song was once again added as the opening song of the setlist, {{as a part of the}} segment titled [...] "City". Gaga performed it in a set, reminiscent of New York City night scene, with flickering neon signs displaying the words [...] "Ugly", [...] "Sexy" [...] and [...] "Liquor", fire escape stairwells and a broken yellow taxi.|$|E

500|$|Beginning {{behind a}} giant, green, laser lit video screen {{featuring}} <b>scrim</b> lights, Gaga {{appeared in a}} bulb-covered futuristic silver jeweled jumpsuit with matching eye makeup and mask and sang [...] "Dance in the Dark" [...] as dancers, dressed in white balaclavas and white jumpsuits, moved around her. The video screen, resembling an electric mathematical grid, was eventually lifted during the performance. After the song, Gaga strapped a portable silver jeweled keyboard to herself and began to perform [...] "Just Dance" [...] while emerging {{from the inside of}} a white cube on a platform. This was followed by a brief video intermission and Gaga returned onstage in an off-white costume, that resembled an alien ecto-skeleton, while the dancers wore skeletal headgear. She started performing [...] "LoveGame", which ended with Gaga pointing towards her groin. Flames appeared on the video screens, as she got out of her ecto-skeleton outfit. After stripping down to a silver bodysuit she performed [...] "Alejandro", and was carried by her [...] crotch by one of her male dancers, and later lowered onto another one of them.|$|E
500|$|Una Ellis-Fermor, who {{had been}} one of Rainbow's lecturers at Bedford, found her a {{position}} as a clerk at the Ministry of Pensions in Cambridge, where she also lectured part-time for adult education classes. At this point she received a telegram from the Ministry of Labour and National Service, who were tracking down graduates not working for the war effort, and was instructed to report for duty at the War Office. She served as part of Army Council secretariat, working for Lieutenant Colonel Alan Mocatta. There she took on increasing responsibilities, many related to supply and logistics for the war effort. As D-Day drew near, her workload became intense, and she took Benzedrine. During this time, she lived in London with her aunt Phyl on Kensington High Street. After her father joined the Army, her mother and siblings left the family farm and moved to the same street, about [...] away. Like many Londoners, they experienced the hazards of the German air raids on London. She served as a neighbourhood fire warden. The windows of her office at the War Office were blown in twice, and were then replaced with <b>scrim.</b>|$|E
500|$|Fleder {{also asked}} for stylistic {{touches on the}} episode which were {{inconsistent}} with the show's typical emphasis on documentary-style realism. For example, he arranged for red <b>scrim</b> lighting {{to reflect on the}} subway car to add an artistic visual touch, even though there was nothing in particular in the subway station that reflected such a light. Upon hearing of the technique, Yoshimura was initially concerned, saying [...] "Oh, he's getting artsy fartsy with me." [...] Just before Lange's death, Fleder included a close-up with Braugher looking directly into the camera, breaking the fourth wall in a way typically forbidden on the show. During an outdoor dialogue scene between Johnson and Seda while the characters were driving in a car, Fleder filmed it by placing the camera outside the car's front windshield and panning {{back and forth between the}} two actors. Unbeknownst to Fleder, all car shots on Homicide: Life on the Street are only allowed to be filmed from inside the car to keep the scene more realistic. As a result of Fleder's car scene, a memo was circulated to the cast and crew reminding them of this policy and threatening to fire anybody who allowed a scene to be shot through the windshield again.|$|E

500|$|... "Much {{has been}} written about that scene ... most of it silly," [...] wrote Gene Lees in High Fidelity. The scene was {{inspired}} by two men who took off their clothes to antagonize the police during an informal anti-war gathering. [...] During [...] "Where Do I Go?", the stage was covered in a giant <b>scrim,</b> beneath which those choosing to participate in the scene removed their clothes. [...] At the musical cue, [...] "they [...] naked and motionless, their bodies bathed in Fisher's light projection of floral patterns. [...] They chant of 'beads, flowers, freedom, and happiness.'" [...] It lasted only twenty seconds. Indeed, the scene happened so quickly and was so dimly lit that it prompted Jack Benny, during the interval at a London preview, to quip, [...] "Did you happen to notice if any of them were Jewish?" [...] Nevertheless, the scene prompted threats of censorship and even violent reactions in some places. It also became fodder for pop-cultural jokes. Groucho Marx quipped, [...] "I was gonna go see it, and then I called up the theater. ... They said the tickets were $11 apiece. I told them I'd call back, went into my bathroom, took off all my clothes, and looked at myself in the full-length mirror. Then I called the theater and said, 'Forget it.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Jim Abott of Orlando Sentinel {{classified}} [...] "the sweetly melodic old-school" [...] song among Jackson's [...] "occasional {{bursts of}} inspiration," [...] declaring it [...] "a beautifully big arrangement that's Motown-esque." [...] Additionally, its [...] "depth and sweetness" [...] was considered unexpected by Dan LeRoy from The Scene, commenting [...] "West's swaying '50s pastiche [...] "I Want You" [...] is delightful". Richard Cromelin of the Los Angeles Times exclaimed the track [...] "has a swooning charm, with a chimes-studded texture that suggests the sweeping light-points of a disco ball." [...] Mikael Wood of Baltimore City Paper gave a similar critique, saying the [...] "luscious slow jam" [...] ultimately [...] "shimmers with the sweet lovesickness Karen Carpenter {{had to fight}} through a <b>scrim</b> of suburban sang-froid to express." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic declared the song [...] "on the slower side", containing [...] "a verse that's memorable." [...] Plugged In observed subtle sexuality within its lyrics, commenting that Jackson is insatiable. The song's production from West also received acclaim. Music critic Kevin Nottingham ranked it as West's second best production, classifying it as a [...] "gorgeous piece of work." [...] He exclaimed. [...] "The drums hit {{at the beginning and}} the listener should already fall in love. Janet's voice should intrigue you, but frankly, those strings and those drums grab my attention all the time." [...] Nottingham added that West's beat takes the listener on a joyful ride, while the beat evokes happiness.|$|E
500|$|The show {{began with}} a gothic cathedral setting, which was {{developed}} by Tait Towers, a production management company. They used ScreenWorks 10mm video screens [...] with an integrated active cooling system designed to dissipate captured heat from LED tiles. The main screens could move up and down, thus creating a moving cathedral setting and steps. Onstage several dancers wearing buddhist and Christian monks' robes swung a giant thurible back and forth, as it burnt incense and appeared to cleanse the venue. The Kalakan Trio then appeared dressed in religious robes with huge head dresses, chanting excerpts from [...] "Lekhah Dodi", as the backdrop screens showed a huge cross with the letters MDNA. The religious chants eventually morph into chants of Madonna's name, as the two main backdrop screens split open to reveal a giant confessional, covered by a <b>scrim</b> at the front. Madonna was present inside kneeling down and praying, while the confessional was lowered to the stage with the song's opening monologue in the background. The singer was decked in a gold crown with a black veil, a tight black shirt with a leopard-printed bra peeking out from the top, leather arm bands and black skinny jeans and black high-heel boots. Madonna pretended to smash and break through the glass window of the confessional with a large rifle and proceeded to perform the song accompanied by a troupe of shirtless dancers wearing high heels, doing a choreography similar to the song's music video. The song was arranged to include musical elements of [...] "Material Girl" [...] (1985) and [...] "Give It 2 Me" [...] (2008). Moving blocks and contortionist dancers dressed up as gargoyles were also present in the performance. [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] ended with Madonna grabbing another rifle and pretending to shoot at the crowd, giving way to the second performance of the show, [...] "Revolver". The performance of the song at the November 19–20, 2012 shows in Miami, at the American Airlines Arena, were recorded and released in Madonna's fourth live album, MDNA World Tour.|$|E

2500|$|The {{design of}} the {{architectural}} <b>scrim</b> which surrounds the building was changed in September 2012. [...] The proposed building itself was a box-like structure. The three-part corona of the building's design was created by a structure only minimally attached to the building. The exterior of this structure, whose frames lean outward to create the corona, consisted of a thin screen or [...] "scrim" [...] perforated by geometrical patterns based on historic iron grilles found in African-American communities in Charleston, South Carolina, and New Orleans, Louisiana. The original design proposed that the <b>scrim</b> be made of bronze, which {{would have made the}} museum the only one on the National Mall whose exterior was not made of limestone or marble. Cost issues forced the architects to change this to bronze-painted aluminum in September 2012. The change was approved by the Commission of Fine Arts, but the commissioners criticized the change for lacking the warm, reflective qualities of bronze. Noted architect Witold Rybczynski also criticized the change: [...] "The appeal of bronze is its warm golden sheen and the rich patina that it acquires over time, but uniformly painted surfaces lack these attributes, and over time they don't age, they merely flake. ... At the time of this writing, the African American museum risks compromising its original intention. [...] In architecture, beauty sometimes really is only skin-deep." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{elaborate}} canopy {{over the}} cathedra was stripped and the cathedra {{placed on a}} simple wooden platform {{in front of a}} <b>scrim.</b> [...] It was a symbolic movement of the cathedra above and apart from the people and instead brought the Bishop out to sit among the congregants he served. [...] Seating was rearranged into an antiphonal design with a plain wooden altar {{in the center of the}} nave with pews facing inward as if seated around the altar from all four sides. [...] The change was expected to enhance the participation of congregants in the celebration of the Eucharist.|$|E

In 2010, the Indonesian choreographer Sardono W. Kusumo used a large-scale reproduction of the painting as a <b>scrim</b> for the stage opera Taking a Fresh Look at Diponegoro.

2500|$|Projecting images onto a shape was an {{idea that}} both {{directors}} decided on together in a meeting. Shiga had only four days to create the projections before the video shoot, so contracted the work to an artist he previous collaborated with called Masaya Yoshida, {{as well as an}} art creation company. The projections of the members' faces were taken from video chats with the band members before the video recording. The dodecahedron was an idea of Kitazawa's, as he considered {{it one of the most}} beautiful shapes, and felt that a beautiful shape would work well as a [...] metaphor for the human brain. The shape is made of <b>scrim</b> attached to a wire frame, in order for both the members and the projections to be seen. Two projectors were used to display the images onto the dodecahedron. No trial run was done before the video's shooting, and instead Shiga modelled the set-up as a computer-aided design until he was satisfied with the arrangement.|$|E

2500|$|Debate {{over the}} corona's finish {{continued}} into 2014 before being resolved. The Commission of Fine Arts repeatedly urged the architects to use bronze for the <b>scrim,</b> as {{it created a}} [...] "shimmering, lustrous effect under many lighting conditions" [...] and [...] "conveyed dignity, permanence and beauty". Duranar paint was the first substitute proposed by the architects, but the commission members rejected it, noting {{that it had a}} [...] "putty-like appearance under overcast conditions" [...] and visually fell [...] "far short of the beautiful poetic intention promised by the concept design". A second finish, the sprayable metal LuminOre, was rejected by the commission because it was difficult to produce in the high quality needed, and was prone to flaking and discoloration. Electroless plating and anodized aluminum were rejected because they lacked durability. A physical vapor deposition process involving a nickel-chrome plating was dismissed for not achieving the right color, luster, or warmth. In early 2014, tests were made with polyvinyl difluoride (PVDF). This coating was approved by the Commission of Fine Arts on February 20, 2014, and by the National Capital Planning Commission in April 2014.|$|E
2500|$|Different field angles {{are needed}} for {{different}} venues with different catwalk and electric systems (and, therefore, different throws). A lens tube with a smaller field angle will light an area from far away, whereas a large beam degree such as a 90 degree can be much closer in order to light the same area. A 90 degree Source Four {{might be used to}} project a gobo from the rear only 5 feet away on a <b>scrim</b> {{at the back of the}} stage, while a 10 degree could be used in the back of the house, for example, in the technical booth where a technician could access it to refocus or change gobos during a show. [...] A zoom gives the option of adjusting the field angle within a specified range without changing the lens tube. [...] This is needed in the case of lighting fixtures that need to be re-focused frequently to different areas of the performing area, without having to rehang them in a different position in the lighting rig. [...] There are two Source Four Zoom fixtures, the 15-30 degree and the 25-50 degree.|$|E
2500|$|A revised {{design was}} {{submitted}} to the CFA {{as well as to}} the NCPC in June 2005. In the revised design, the fountain was now a simple basin (without water jets) in the shape of a star, with the eternal flame at its center. A thin <b>scrim</b> of water surrounded the flame, making it appear as if the fire were emerging from the water itself. The northeastern sides and arms of the star spilled water over into a reflecting pool. Extending northwest and southeast from the star-shaped basin was a triangular reflecting pool whose long edge bordered Washington Avenue. Both the star-shaped basin and the reflecting pool were intended to be of black granite. Both the basin and the reflecting pool were designed to have as little rippling water as possible, so as best to reflect both the eternal flame and the Capitol building. Trees lined the edges of the reflecting pool, except for an opening on the northeast portion of the site (which permitted views of the U.S. Capitol). The length of the stone and glass walls was now much reduced, and they were set near the trees on the western and southern edges of the site. The memorial's primary entrance was still considered to be on the north end, but stone walls came close together in the southwest corner of the site to create a major secondary entrance. [...] The white marble-faced stone walls were called the [...] "Walls of Loss", and Vergason intended for them to be inscribed with stories from disabled veterans documenting how they were wounded, their reactions to their disabilities, and the way they felt society treated them. Circular openings in the stone walls helped maintain a sense of openness rather than being walled off. The glass walls were called the [...] "Walls of Light". Vergason intended for these walls to be more uplifting, and to be inscribed with quotes about democracy, honor, sacrifice service, duty, and patriotism. [...] Nearly the entire site would be paved with grey granite, and grey granite benches would be placed in strategic locations to force visitors to the Capitol and fountain from the best angles. Vergason also intended for [...] "works of art" [...] to be placed around the memorial site, although the nature of these artworks had yet to be determined. The revised design still returned C Street SW to its original configuration in the L'Enfant Plan. All steps and grade changes were eliminated and special-needs parking along C Street SW increased to make the memorial more handicapped-accessible.|$|E
