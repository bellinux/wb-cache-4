Because of the higher price and {{scarcity}} of groundnut meal {{from time to time}} this study has been carried out to find alternative protein resources for poultry diets. Also, to contribute to the feed supply and {{to solve the problem of}} the limited availability of poultry feedstuffs in Sudan; Crude Protein (CP), Crude Fibre (CF), fat, Nitrogen Free Extract (NFE), Metabolizable Energy (ME); mineral content and amino acids composition have been determined for some non-conventional and local feed resources. Groundnut cake, <b>sesame</b> <b>cake</b> and sunflower cake had high CP contents (53. 44, 44. 42 and 31. 57 %) respectively, whereas baobab seed cake (Adansonia digitata L) had the lowest value (15. 01 %) among all plant samples. The highest ash value was recorded with earthworm (Lumbricus terrestris) sample (43. 5 %) followed by Moleita Baladi (Sonchus oleraceus) (22. 53 %) and <b>sesame</b> <b>cake</b> (14. 15 %). Moringa oleifera seeds and leaves had the highest ME (12. 39 and 11. 88 MJ/kg), respectively. The greatest CF was observed with cotton seed cake (29. 6 %). The highest calcium percentage among all seeds cakes was recorded with sesame seed cake (1. 93 %). Moringa leaves had the greatest calcium value among the rest of the determined samples (2. 70 %). <b>Sesame</b> <b>cake</b> was the best sample for the phosphorus content (1. 17 %). The highest values of cooper, zinc and manganese were 109. 86, 151. 17 and 268. 73 mg/kg, respectively. Those values were observed with earthworm. <b>Sesame</b> <b>cake</b> had the greatest value of methionine among all samples (1. 29 %), while baobab seed cake had the lowest one (0. 19 %). Earthworm and groundnut cake had the greatest lysine content 2. 56 and 1. 82 %, respectively. Most of determined amino acids were above than 1 % in all tested oil seed cakes. Although the amino acids contents in all tested samples were proportionally high, some of the samples had deficiency in particular amino acids. These results encourage the inclusion of several protein resources to avoid the amino acids deficiency when poultry diets are formulated. This study indicated that these non-conventional and local feed resources can be used in poultry diets in Sudan, but because of the presence of secondary compounds, the amount of the feedstuffs used should be decided through further research...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn the {{production}} of oil from sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) seeds, a coproduct is obtained which is rich in protein and fiber contents. Mixtures of semi-defatted <b>sesame</b> <b>cake</b> (SDSC) (0 – 20 %) and corn grits were processed in a single screw extruder at screw speed ranging from 324 to 387 rpm to improve the nutritional value of corn expanded extrudates. Chemical composition of raw and extruded materials, sectional expansion index (SEI), texture properties, color, paste viscosity, microstructure and sensory analysis of the extrudates were performed. The addition of SDSC increased protein, fat and ash content of corn extrudates, whereas carbohydrate content was reduced. The addition of SDSC reduced the sectional expansion of the corn extrudates and increased puncture force. SDSC–corn extrudates were darker than non-SDSC–corn extrudates. Increasing SDSC {{increased the number of}} cells similar to those of commercial corn extrudates with small cells. Sensory analysis showed 20 % SDSC-corn extrudates to be acceptable and nutritional balanced.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{is an attempt to}} assess the {{situation}} of feed industries and the quality of feed in Nepal. Feed production is a major component of poultry industry, because near about 80 % of total cost require for production goes to feed. There are altogether 149 feed industries of different size in different location in operation. About 45 % of them are of small unit producing less than 5 tones/day. About 35 % are of medium size producing 6 - 10 tones/day, and rest 20 % is of large size producing more than 10 tones/day. The feed production cost was higher than its neighboring country China and India by about 33 % and 23 %, respectively. Likewise, the feed conversion ratio (FCR) was also high being 2. 3 for broiler compared to China and India being 1. 8 and 2. 0, respectively. The high production cost and poor performance was mainly due to low quality raw materials, unavailability of raw materials, unscientific formulation, and poor management in the poultry farm and smaller size of production unit.

40|$|Abstract: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to study the possibility for preservation of catfish fat by using <b>sesame</b> <b>cake</b> extracts (SCE) as a source of natural antioxidants. The SCEs were obtained by extraction of black and white sesame cakes with methanol. Catfish (Pangasius hypophthalmus) fat was mixed with the black and white SCE at different concentrations and stored at room temperature (RT) and 60 o C, in comparison with the synthetic antioxidant –BHT at concentration of 200 ppm. The results showed that the total phenolic content (TPC) in black SCE was 1386. 3 ± 89. 6 mgGAE/ 100 g dw (dry weight) and in white SCE 1318. 5 ± 68. 7 mgGAE/ 100 g dw. The free-radical scavenging capacity, determined by the 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free-radical scavenging assay, of the black and white SCE were significantly lower than that of BHT and ascorbic acid. The IC 50 values of the black, white SCE samples, BHT and ascorbic acid were 817, 833, 31 and 7 mg/L, respectively. However, both the white and black SCE showed a strong effect on retarding lipid oxidation in catfish fat, which was comparable to that of BHT at 200 ppm. The free fatty acid values (FFA) and peroxide values (PV) of the catfish fat samples treated with the black and white SCEs at a concentration of 400 ppm, were lower than 6. 0 mg KOH/g fat and 16 meq/kg fat, respectively, when stored at both room temperature and 60 o C up to 42 days...|$|E
