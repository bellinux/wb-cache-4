5|$|As {{each piece}} of {{wreckage}} was brought in, it was carefully cleaned with fresh water, sorted, and weighed. The item was then placed in a <b>specific</b> <b>area</b> of a hangar at CFB Shearwater, based on a grid system representing the various sections of the plane. All items not considered significant to the crash were stored with similar items in large boxes. When a box was full, it was weighed {{and moved to a}} custom-built temporary structure (J-Hangar) on a discontinued runway for long-term storage. If deemed significant to the investigation, the item was documented, photographed, and kept in the active examination hangar. Particular attention was paid to any item showing heat damage, burns, or other unusual marks.|$|E

5|$|A First Deputy Premier {{was usually}} given {{responsibility}} over one <b>specific</b> <b>area.</b> For example, Kirill Mazurov {{was responsible for}} industry, and Dmitry Polyansky was agriculture. However, after Polyansky's departure in 1973 Mazurov was left the sole First Deputy Premier until Tikhonov was appointed in 1976. An officeholder could also be responsible for coordinating the activities of ministries and state committees and other subordinate bodies of the Council of Ministers. To do this the First Deputy Premier had to give these bodies guidance in an expeditious manner to ensure the implementation of plans for {{economic and social development}} and to check if the orders and decisions of the Council of Ministers were being followed. If the Premier could not perform his duties one of the First Deputy Premiers would take on the role of acting Premier until the Premier's return. During the late 1970s, when the health of Premier Alexei Kosygin deteriorated, Nikolai Tikhonov, the First Deputy Premier, acted on his behalf during his absence. When Tikhonov took command of the Soviet economy, Kosygin served in a standby role. At a Central Committee plenum in June 1980, the Soviet economic development plan was outlined by Tikhonov, and not Kosygin.|$|E

5|$|Grey reef {{sharks are}} fast-swimming, agile predators that feed {{primarily}} on free-swimming bony fishes and cephalopods. Their aggressive demeanor {{enables them to}} dominate many other shark species on the reef, despite their moderate size. Many grey reef sharks have a home range on a <b>specific</b> <b>area</b> of the reef, to which they continually return. However, they are social rather than territorial. During the day, these sharks often form groups of five to 20 individuals near coral reef drop-offs, splitting up in the evening as the sharks begin to hunt. Adult females also form groups in very shallow water, where the higher water temperature may accelerate their growth or that of their unborn young. Like other members of its family, the grey reef shark is viviparous, meaning the mother nourishes her embryos through a placental connection. Litters of one to six pups are born every other year.|$|E
5|$|The {{peripheral}} nerves of the parasympathetic {{nervous system}} that carry messages to the brain (afferent nerve fibers) may explain why people with complete SCI feel sexual and climactic sensations. One proposed explanation for orgasm in women despite complete SCI is that the vagus nerve bypasses the spinal cord and carries sensory information from the genitals directly to the brain. Women with complete injuries can achieve sexual arousal and orgasm through stimulation of the clitoris, cervix, or vagina, which are each innervated by different nerve pathways, which suggests that even if SCI interferes with one area, function might be preserved in others. In both injured and uninjured people, the brain {{is responsible for the}} way sensations of climax are perceived: the qualitative experiences associated with climax are modulated by the brain, rather than a <b>specific</b> <b>area</b> of the body.|$|E
5|$|They are {{responsible}} for pollination of approximately {{one third of the}} United States' crop species, including such species as almonds, peaches, apples, pears, cherries, raspberries, blackberries, cranberries, watermelons, cantaloupes, cucumbers, and strawberries. Many, but not all, of these plants can be (and often are) pollinated by other insects in the U.S., including other kinds of bees (e.g., squash bees on cucurbits), but typically not on a commercial scale. While some farmers of a few kinds of native crops do bring in honey bees to help pollinate, none specifically need them, and when honey bees are absent from a region, there is a presumption that native pollinators may reclaim the niche, typically being better adapted to serve those plants (assuming that the plants normally occur in that <b>specific</b> <b>area).</b>|$|E

5|$|To {{overcome}} elevator issues, {{the tower}} will use its {{large number of}} efficient elevators {{as well as its}} three sky lobbies, which allows transfers to be made between elevators serving a <b>specific</b> <b>area</b> with no elevator being overburdened. Much was learned from Burj Khalifa that helped with the design of Jeddah Tower not only structurally, but in methods for designing practical mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) systems, as well as adhering to local regulations and international building codes. Despite all the physical challenges, Adrian Smith states that practicality is still the greater challenge over structural durability, even in such super-tall designs, and that as with all buildings, Jeddah Tower's form was primarily derived respective of what the building's uses would be, then in accordance with the structural factors {{that would have to be}} considered to deliver it.|$|E
5|$|Voice casting was {{managed by}} Kris Zimmerman, who chose voice actors {{that seemed to}} suit certain roles: the Matoran were voiced by young adults, while the Turaga were voiced by older actors. The voice actors and their {{performances}} were chosen so they would not sound like they came from a <b>specific</b> <b>area</b> of the world, instead sound like they came from and belonged in the Bionicle universe. A notable event during recording was a behind-the-scenes incident between Michas and Francis: originally cast in the respective roles of Jaller and Takua, Michas came into a recording session in a muddled state and began reading Takua's lines by mistake. When Francis came in, he read Jaller's lines: when the staff heard them and were favourably impressed, the actors permanently switched roles. Voice acting for the project was mostly done in 2002, but dialogue was re-recorded during Additional Dialogue Recording (ADR) into 2003: approximately 30% of the final film's dialogue was done during ADR. Audio and music post-production was handled by Hacienda Post. The company's president Tim Borquez served as sound supervisor. Mask of Light {{was the first time}} in any media that Bionicle characters spoke.|$|E
