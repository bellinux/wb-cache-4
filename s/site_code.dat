50|$|The Scottish Wildlife Trust (SWT) have {{surveyed}} the grounds and recorded 19 {{species of birds}} and 136 species of plants. The grounds have a rich fungal flora, {{partly due to the}} quantity of fallen timber. This is exemplified by the presence of parrot waxcap (Hygrocybe psittacina), an uncommon species. The biodiversity and other considerations have resulted in the grounds qualifying as an official SWT Wildlife <b>Site,</b> <b>code</b> NS353532. This ensures a greater degree of protection against any possibly insensitive developments that might be proposed at any future date. In 2010 a specimen of the Arran whitebeam (Sorbus pseudofennica) a rare species unique to Scotland, was found at Spier's. In 2011 the exceptionally rare common broomrape (Orobanche minor) was discovered growing at Spier's and {{has been the subject of}} a conservation project since that date.|$|E
50|$|A common {{proximity}} {{format is}} 26 bit Wiegand. This format uses a facility code also called a <b>site</b> <b>code.</b> The facility code is unique number {{common to all}} of the cards in a particular set. The idea is an organization has their own facility code and then numbered cards incrementing from 1. Another organization has a different facility code and their card set also increments from 1. Thus different organizations can have card sets with the same card numbers but since the facility codes differ, the cards only work at one organization. This idea worked fine for a while but there is no governing body controlling card numbers, different manufacturers can supply cards with identical facility codes and identical card numbers to different organizations. Thus there is a problem of duplicate cards. To counteract this problem some manufacturers have created formats beyond 26 bit Wiegand that they control and issue to an organization.|$|E
