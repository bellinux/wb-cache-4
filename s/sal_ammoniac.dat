25|$|Ammonia {{is found}} in trace {{quantities}} in nature, being produced from the nitrogenous animal and vegetable matter. Ammonia and ammonium salts are also found in small quantities in rainwater, whereas ammonium chloride (<b>sal</b> <b>ammoniac),</b> and ammonium sulfate are found in volcanic districts; crystals of ammonium bicarbonate {{have been found in}} Patagonian guano. The kidneys secrete ammonia to neutralize excess acid. Ammonium salts are found distributed through fertile soil and in seawater.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} the medieval period that {{distillation}} was discovered and the first description of nitric acid production was given by Pseudo-Geber in the Summa perfectionis, 1330. Nitric acid is able to dissolve silver. The addition of <b>sal</b> <b>ammoniac</b> to nitric acid creates Aqua regia and this acid is able to dissolve gold.

25|$|In {{addition}} to his mechanical work Murdoch also experimented {{in the field of}} chemistry and made a number of discoveries. One such was the discovery, first recorded in 1784, of iron cement made from <b>sal</b> <b>ammoniac,</b> or ammonium chloride and iron filings, apparently discovered when Murdoch observed that these two components had accidentally mixed in his tool bag and formed a solid mass. This iron cement was used to fix and harden the joints of steam engines, thus creating a hard durable seal.|$|E

25|$|Chemical {{coloring}} {{of metals}} {{is an art}} involving craftsmanship and experience. Coloring techniques depend upon time, temperature, surface preparation, humidity and other variables. Pre-patinated copper sheets are produced by fabricators under controlled environments using patented chemical processes. Green patina finishes are primarily developed using acid chloride or acid sulfate. Treatments with ammonium chloride (<b>sal</b> <b>ammoniac),</b> cuprous chloride/hydrochloric acid, and ammonium sulfate are somewhat successful. Statuary finishes can be produced in light, medium, and dark brown, depending on the concentration and number of coloring applications. One advantage is that the treatment disguises surface markings on bright mill finish copper and can advance the natural patination process.|$|E
25|$|Aqua regia {{was also}} used for parting. It was made by adding <b>sal</b> <b>ammoniac</b> to nitric acid which {{produced}} a mixture of hydrochloric acid and nitric acid. This acid dissolved the gold to a soluble chloride and the silver was attacked and precipitated as an insoluble chloride. Silver was removed by filtering and gold was then recovered by evaporating the liquid and heating the residue. Nitric acid was suitable for separating small quantities of gold from silver and Aqua regia used to separate small quantities of silver from gold. Aqua regia acid process is used by refiners of scrap gold used in jewelry manufacturing. This process is also well suited to recycling consumers' used or broken jewelry directly back onto the global market 24kt inventory.|$|E
500|$|The Huolongjings primary {{contribution}} to gunpowder was in expanding {{its role as}} a chemical weapon. Jiao Yu proposed several gunpowder compositions in addition to the standard potassium nitrate (saltpetre), sulphur, and charcoal. Described are the military applications of [...] "divine gunpowder", [...] "poison gunpowder", and [...] "blinding and burning gunpowder." [...] Poisonous gunpowder for hand-thrown or trebuchet launched bombs was created using a mixture of tung oil, urine, <b>sal</b> <b>ammoniac,</b> feces, and scallion juice heated and coated upon tiny iron pellets and broken porcelain. According to Jiao Yu, [...] "even birds flying in the air cannot escape the effects of the explosion".|$|E

It was also used by dyers in the Middle Ages in {{the form of}} fermented urine to alter the colour of vegetable dyes. In the 15th century, Basilius Valentinus showed that ammonia could be obtained by the action of alkalis on <b>sal</b> <b>ammoniac.</b> At a later period, when <b>sal</b> <b>ammoniac</b> was obtained by distilling the hooves and horns of oxen and neutralizing the resulting carbonate with hydrochloric acid, the name [...] "spirit of hartshorn" [...] was applied to ammonia.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{the start}} of World War I, most ammonia was {{obtained}} by the dry distillation of nitrogenous vegetable and animal waste products, including camel dung, where it was distilled by the reduction of nitrous acid and nitrites with hydrogen; in addition, it was produced by the distillation of coal, and also by the decomposition of ammonium salts by alkaline hydroxides such as quicklime, the salt most generally used being the chloride (<b>sal</b> <b>ammoniac)</b> thus: ...|$|E
2500|$|Hammers are essential. Planishing, chasing, {{creasing}} {{and setting}} down hammers {{are among the}} most common, as well as ball pein hammers. Horn or wooden mallets are also used. Before electric soldering irons became available, tinsmiths would use heated [...] "copper" [...] irons made of a wooden handle, iron shank and copper tips formed into different shapes. These items were heated in small furnaces, covered in <b>sal</b> <b>ammoniac,</b> and then used for soldering seams.|$|E
2500|$|The ancient Greek {{historian}} Herodotus {{mentioned that}} there were outcrops of salt {{in an area of}} Libya that was inhabited by a people called the [...] "Ammonians" [...] (now: [...] the Siwa oasis in northwestern Egypt, where salt lakes still exist). [...] The Greek geographer Strabo also mentioned the salt from this region. [...] However, the ancient authors Dioscorides, Apicius, Arrian, Synesius, and Aëtius of Amida described this salt as forming clear crystals {{that could be used for}} cooking and that were essentially rock salt. [...] Hammoniacus sal appears in the writings of Pliny, although it is not known whether the term is identical with the more modern <b>sal</b> <b>ammoniac</b> (ammonium chloride).|$|E
2500|$|The {{process of}} distilling crude oil/petroleum into kerosene, {{as well as}} other {{hydrocarbon}} compounds, was first written about in the 9th century by the Persian scholar Rāzi (or Rhazes). In his Kitab al-Asrar (Book of Secrets), the physician and chemist Razi described two methods for the production of kerosene, termed naft abyad ("white naphtha"), using an apparatus called an alembic. One method used clay as an absorbent, whereas the other method used ammonium chloride (<b>sal</b> <b>ammoniac).</b> The distillation process was repeated until most of the volatile hydrocarbon fractions had been removed and the final product was perfectly clear and safe to burn. Kerosene was also produced during the same period from oil shale and bitumen by heating the rock to extract the oil, which was then distilled. During the medieval Chinese Ming Dynasty, the Chinese made use of kerosene through extracting and purifying petroleum and then converted it into lamp fuel. The Chinese made use of petroleum and kerosene for lighting lamps and heating homes as early as 1500 BC.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} side of the debate, opponents of the theory criticize the vagueness of Chinese records on the {{specific}} usage of gunpowder in weaponry, the existence of gunpowder or possibly lack thereof in incendiary weapons as described by Chinese documents, the weakness of Chinese firearms, the non-existent route of diffusion or evidence of guns between Europe and China before 1326, and emphasize the independent evolution of superior guns in Europe. This too becomes problematic as already discussed above. Notably there is an acute dearth of any significant evidence of evolution or experimentation with gunpowder or gunpowder weapons leading up to the gun in 1326, which can be found in China. Gunpowder appeared in Europe primed for military usage as an explosive and propellant, bypassing a process which took centuries of Chinese experimentation with gunpowder weaponry to reach, making a nearly instantaneous and seamless transition into gun warfare, as its name suggests. Furthermore, early European gunpowder recipes shared identical defects with Chinese recipes such as the inclusion of the poisons <b>sal</b> <b>ammoniac</b> and arsenic, which provide no benefit to gunpowder. Bert S. Hall explains this phenomenon in his Weapons and Warfare in Renaissance Europe: Gunpowder, Technology, and Tactics by drawing upon the gunpowder transmission theory, explaining that [...] "gunpowder came , not as an ancient mystery, but as a well-developed modern technology, in a manner very much like twentieth-century 'technology-transfer' projects." [...] In a similar vein Peter Lorge supposes that the Europeans experienced gunpowder [...] "free from preconceived notions of what could be done," [...] in contrast to China, [...] "where a wide range of formulas and a broad variety of weapons demonstrated the full range of possibilities and limitations of the technologies involved." [...] There is also the vestige of Chinese influence, and not European, on Muslim terminology of some gunpowder related items such as saltpeter, which has been described as either Chinese snow or salt, fireworks which were called Chinese flowers, and rockets which were called Chinese arrows. Moreover, Europeans in particular experienced great difficulty in obtaining saltpeter, a primary ingredient of gunpowder which was relatively scarce in Europe compared to China, and had to be obtained from [...] "distant lands or extracted at high cost from soil rich in dung and urine." [...] Thomas Arnold believes that the similarities between early European cannons and contemporary Chinese models suggests a direct transmission of cannon making knowledge from China rather than a home grown development. Whatever the truth may be, the first unambiguous references to guns appeared in Europe in the 1320s.|$|E
