40|$|Highly loaded {{single stage}} gas {{turbines}} {{are being developed}} to minimize the turbine size and weight. Such highly loaded turbines often result in transonic flows, which imply {{a reduction in the}} efficiency due to the shock losses. The efficiency of a turbine is defined as the ratio between the real work extracted by the turbine rotor from the fluid and the maximum available enthalpy for a given pressure ratio. The relationship between turbine performance and design parameters is not yet fully comprehended due to the complexity of the flow field and unsteady flow field interactions. Hence, experimental and numerical studies remain necessary to understand the flow behavior at different conditions to advance {{the state of the art}} of the prediction tools. The purpose of the current research is to develop a methodology to determine the efficiency with an accuracy better than 1 % in a cooled and uncooled high pressure (HP) turbine tested in a short duration facility with a running time of about 0. 4 s. Such low level of uncertainty requires the accurate evaluation of a large number of quantities simultaneously, namely the mass flow of the mainstream, the coolant, and leakage flows properties, the inlet total pressure and total temperature, the stage exit total pressure, the shaft power, the mechanical losses and the heat transfer. The experimental work is carried out in a compression tube facility that allows testing the turbine at the temperature ratios, Re and Mach numbers encountered in real engines. The <b>stage</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> is controlled by a variable sonic throat located downstream of the stage exit. Due to the absence of any brake, the turbine power is converted into rotor acceleration. The accurate measurement of this acceleration as well as those of the inertia and the rotational speed provides the shaft power. The inertia of the whole rotating assembly was accurately determined by accelerating and decelerating the shaft with a known energy. The mass-flow is derived from the measured turbine inlet total pressure and the vane sonic throat. The turbine sonic throat was evaluated based on a zero-dimensional model of the turbine. The efficiencies of two transonic turbines are measured at design and off-design conditions. The turbine design efficiency is obtained as 91. 8 %. The repeatability of the measurements for 95 % confidence level varies between 0. 3 % and 1. 1 % of the efficiency depending on the test case. The theoretical uncertainty level of 1. 2 % is mainly affected by the uncertainty of exit total pressure measurements. Additionally, the effect of vane trailing edge shock formations and their interactions with the rotor blade are analyzed based on the experimental data, the numerical tools and the loss correlations. The changes of blade and vane performances are measured at mid-span for three different pressure ratios which influence the vane and rotor shock mechanisms. Moreover, the unsteady forces on the rotor blades and the rotor disk were calculated by integration of the unsteady static pressure field on the rotor surface. (FSA 3) [...] UCL, 200...|$|E

40|$|The {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} an aspirated fan stage designed {{to achieve a}} pressure ratio of 3. 4 : 1 at 1500 ft/sec is presented in this paper. The low-energy viscous flow is aspirated from diffusion-limiting locations on the blades and flowpath surfaces of the stage, enabling a very high pressure ratio to be achieved in a single stage. The fan stage performance was mapped at various operating speeds from choke to stall in a compressor facility at fully simulated engine conditions.

The experimental measurements were done on two horizontal scraped surface heat exchangers connected in series.

For numerical analyses the simplified model was used, with taking only the area between the heat transfer tube, and the shaft with an aim to compare the result to experimental measurements and validate the obtained overall heat exchange, as justify the simplification. As a results from experimental measurements were obtained the correlations for Nusselt number in a form of Nu=f(Re,Pr,η f /η w). Based on the confrontation of results, it can be stated that the level of simplification used at numerical solutions, gives still an acceptable accuracy of overall heat transfer values. From numerical simulations were obtained further results as the velocity, temperature fields, which were used to make certain adaptation on proposed construction and their examination by additional numerical simulations. All these acquired results lead to better understanding the overall process inside the horizontal scraped surface heat exchangers and the proposed construction of mutators can increase the efficiency of heat transfer process for many products in a real processing...|$|R

40|$|Development and {{implementation}} of automated monitoring, control and optimization systems for mineral processing applications require accurate online <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> measurements from the processes. The <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> sensors used in mineral processing plants are designed to monitor the production volumes of the end products. Belt scale {{is the most common}} online bulk material <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> sensor used in the mineral processing. The belt scale provides an accurate online <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> measurement from the process. However, the high unit price of the sensor prevents the installation of multiple belt scales in a single mineral processing plant. In addition to the online <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> measurements of the belt scales, offline <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> measurements might be also carried out at the plants. Offline <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> sensors include wheel loader scales and truck scales. The high unit price, low measurement frequency and variable measurement delays prevent the offline <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> sensors to be used in automated process control. The main goals of this work are determined by the three research questions formulated for this work. The first goal is to analyse the correlations of four measurement signals of the online <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> sensors against the reference <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> measurement of the belt scale. The fitting of the measurement signals is performed by linear regression method. The analysis of the signals is performed by measures of fit methods, the root mean square RMSE and correlation analysis method R-squared. The second goal is to analyse the accuracies of three <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> estimation models. The third goal is to perform comprehensive analysis of the features, benefits and restrictions of each online <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> sensor. This analysis can be utilized, if the presented online <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> sensors are implemented in a mineral processing plant. The online <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> sensors used in this work are a power transducer, laser profilometer, ultrasonic sensor and strain gauge. In order to answer the research questions, an experimental measurement setup was designed and installed at the test plant. An aggregate production plant is used as an example of mineral processing application in this work. The presented online <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> sensors can also be applied to other mineral processing applications handling solid materials on belt conveyors. The results of this work indicate that all of the measurement signals of the online <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> sensors correlate well with the reference <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> measurement of the belt scale.

One injection technology of current interest for variable thrust applications is an injector design with swirled fluids. Current swirl injector design methodologies do not take into account how swirl injector design parameters respond to elevated chamber backpressures at less than design <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rates. The current work was created to improve state-of-the-art swirl injector design methods in this area. The specific objective was to study the effects of elevated chamber backpressure and off-design <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rates on swirl injector fluid mechanics. Using a backpressure chamber with optical access, water was flowed through a swirl injector at various combinations of chamber backpressure and <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rates. The film thickness profile down the swirl injector nozzle section was measured through a transparent nozzle section of the injector. High speed video showed measurable increases in the film thickness profile with application of chamber backpressure and <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rates less than design.
