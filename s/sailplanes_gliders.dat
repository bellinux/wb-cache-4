50|$|For over 50 years (approximately 1959-2009), Hemet-Ryan was {{a popular}} site for {{operating}} <b>sailplanes</b> (<b>gliders).</b> Sailplane Enterprises operated there from 1972-2009. Orange County Soaring Association (OCSA) used Hemet-Ryan as its home base from 1991-2009. Cypress Soaring was also based there until 2009. On September 30, 2009, the Economic Development Agency closed Hemet-Ryan to glider operations by painting a large yellow “X” on runway 4-22. OCSA {{filed a complaint with}} the FAA pursuant to Title 14 CFR Part 16 against the County of Riverside. On February 11, 2011, the FAA ruled that the closure was in violation of Federal law and Federal grant obligations. The County declined to appeal the ruling.|$|E

50|$|Gliders were {{developed}} from the 1920s for recreational purposes. As pilots began {{to understand how to}} use rising air, <b>sailplane</b> <b>gliders</b> {{were developed}} with a high lift-to-drag ratio. These allowed longer glides to the next source of 'lift', and so increase their chances of flying long distances. This gave rise to the popular sport of gliding.|$|R
40|$|Imagine if {{you could}} feel the sensations a bird may feel while flying. That is what the Fly by Feel system offers. The Fly by Feel system is being {{designed}} to provide tactile feedback to a pilot by monitoring properties of air flow (e. g., air pressure) across the wings. This could not only allow for an improved experience while flying but it should also allow pilots to be safer. This system is primarily being designed for <b>sailplanes</b> (<b>gliders).</b> The Fly by Feel system is being designed to take readings from sensors on the wings and translate these readings into tactile feedback (touch). There are several parts to this system; however I will be focused on the tactile feedback method. This is an innovative project that may not only allow for an incredible new way to experience flight, but may also make flying safer as the pilot could “feel ” changes in wind speed and pressure. The goal of the Fly by Feel system is to equip the wing of a glider with an array of sensors measuring air flow properties on the wing, and feed that information back to the glider pilot via a tactile feedback system. The goal of my research is to design and test a new type of actuator that will provide air based variable tactile feedback. The system will vary the amount and pressure of the air flow sent to the pilots skin based on sensor data. This system should provide more control than past designs (see Parrott, 2008; Wronski, 2008). This greater control will be achieved through adjustments of individual actuator air flow, as well using smaller air to skin contacts...|$|E

50|$|Some {{things that}} fly don't {{generate}} propulsive thrust through the air, for example, the flying squirrel. This is termed gliding. Some other things can exploit rising air to climb such as raptors (when gliding) and man-made <b>sailplane</b> <b>gliders.</b> This is termed soaring. However most other birds and all powered aircraft need {{a source of}} propulsion to climb. This is termed powered flight.|$|R
50|$|The main human {{application}} is currently recreational, though during the Second World War military gliders {{were used for}} carrying troops and equipment into battle. The types of aircraft that are used for sport and recreation are classified as <b>gliders</b> (<b>sailplanes),</b> hang <b>gliders</b> and paragliders. These two latter types are often foot-launched. The design of all three types enables them to repeatedly climb using rising air and then to glide before finding the next source of lift. When done in <b>gliders</b> (<b>sailplanes),</b> the sport is known as gliding and sometimes as soaring. For foot-launched aircraft, it is known as hang gliding and paragliding. Radio-controlled gliders with fixed wings are also soared by enthusiasts.|$|R

50|$|Unpowered {{aircraft}} {{can remain}} airborne {{for a significant}} period of time without onboard propulsion. They can be classified as fixed-wing gliders, lighter-than-air balloons and tethered kites. This requires a trajectory that {{is not merely a}} vertical descent such as a parachute. In the case of kites, lift is obtained by tethering to a fixed or moving object, perhaps another kite, to obain a flow of wind over the lifting surfaces. In the case of balloons, lift is obtained through inherent buoyancy and the balloon {{may or may not be}} tethered. Free balloon flight has little directional control. Gliding aircraft include <b>sailplanes,</b> hang <b>gliders,</b> and paragliders that have full directional control in free flight.|$|R
