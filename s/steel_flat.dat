40|$|Surface {{topography}} of harder mating surface {{plays an important}} role in metal forming operations as it predominantly controls the frictional behavior at the interface. In the present investigation, an inclined scratch tester was used to understand the effect of direction of surface grinding marks on interface friction and transfer layer formation. EN 8 <b>steel</b> <b>flats</b> were ground to attain different surface roughnesses with unidirectional grinding marks. Al–Mg alloy pins were then scratched against the prepared EN 8 <b>steel</b> <b>flats.</b> The grinding angle (angle between direction of scratch and grinding marks) was varied between 0 deg and 90 deg during the scratch tests. Scanning electron micrography of the contact surfaces revealed the transfer layer morphology. The coefficient of friction and transfer layer formation were observed to depend primarily on the direction of grinding marks of the harder mating surface, and independent of the surface roughness of harder mating surface. The grinding angle effect was attributed to the variation of plowing component of friction with grinding angle...|$|R

In the present investigation, experiments were conducted using “Inclined Scratch Tester” to understand the effect of surface texture of hard surfaces on coefficient of friction and transfer layer formation. EN 8 <b>steel</b> <b>flats</b> were ground to attain surfaces of different textures with different roughness. Then super purity aluminium pins were scratched against the prepared <b>steel</b> <b>flats.</b> Scanning electron micrographs of the contact surfaces of pins and flats were used to reveal the morphology of transfer layer. It was observed that the coefficient of friction {{and the formation of}} transfer layer depend primarily on the texture of hard surfaces, but independent of surface roughness of hard surfaces. It was observed that on surfaces that promote plane strain conditions near the surface, the transfer of material takes place due to the plowing action of the asperities. But, on a surface that promotes plane stress conditions the transfer layer was more due to the adhesion component of friction. It was observed that the adhesion component increases for surfaces that have random texture but was constant for the other surface...|$|R

40|$|Friction {{influences}} {{the nature of}} transfer layer formed at the interface between die and sheet during forming. In the present investigation, basic studies were conducted using 'Inclined Scratch Test' to understand the mechanism of transfer layer formation during sliding of pins made of an Al-Mg alloy on EN 8 <b>steel</b> <b>flats</b> of different surface roughness under dry and lubricated conditions. The surfaces produced can be categorized into three different types: (a) uni-directional (b) 8 -ground and (c) random. Rubbing the EN 8 flat in a uni-directional manner and a criss-cross manner on emery sheets produced the uni-directional and 8 ground surfaces. The random surfaces were produced by polishing the EN 8 flats using various abrasive powders. The influence of the 'nature of surface roughness' on material transfer and coefficient of friction were investigated. Scanning Electron Microscopy studies were performed on the contact surfaces of the Al-Mg alloy pins and EN 8 <b>steel</b> <b>flats</b> to reveal the morphology of the transfer layer obtained. It was seen that the transfer layer is dependant on the coefficient of friction. The coefficient of friction, which has two components-the adhesion component and the plowing component, {{is controlled by the}} 'nature of surface'.

Following an accident investigation by HM Inspectorate of Mines, it was found that the rope had corroded, where it had been in contact with the Headframe sheave wheel. But as the rope was covered with a protective coating of tar, the corrosion had gone undetected. The sheave wheels on both the No.1 and No.2 shafts at Deep Navigation were unusual, in that they were constructed of different parts that had been riveted together, not a singular wheel that had been cast. The sheaves were not replaced at Deep Navigation until 1961 (No.2 South), and 1963 (No.1 North).|$|E

40|$|The present {{focuses on}} dynamic nature of various {{structures}} present {{in an environment}} where they are bound to undergo vibrations. In such vibrating conditions when they are subjected to a resonance they experience high amplitudes, leading to the failure of the structure. Hence, the study of operating frequencies of 1) Machine Foundations i) Los Angels Abrasion Machine ii) Jaw Crushing Machine 2) Fiber Reinforced Glass Composites – varying the number of layers i) 16 layers ii) 12 layers 3) Steel Flats In this study we have used a non computational technique for analysis of dynamic nature of structures. Brüel&Kjær PULSE™, Multi-analyzer System Type 3560 was used in the analysis. The operating frequency ranges in case of Los Angels Abrasion Machine is found to be 48 Hz – first frequency and 73 Hz – second frequency. In case of Jaw Crushing Machine is 42. 2 Hz – first frequency and 71. 8 Hz – second frequency. Where as, in case of <b>steel</b> <b>flat</b> the operating frequency is found to be 41. 50 Hz. The fiber reinforced glass composites were decreased in area in a regular pattern and the pattern of frequency variation was observed. In case of 16 layers the first frequency decreased from 284 Hz – 236 Hz and the second frequency also depicted similar pattern. In case of 12 layers the first frequency decreased from 190 Hz – 160 Hz and the second frequency varied from 588 Hz – 390 Hz. The observed trend is justified as the value of K decreases as we decrease the area of the sample. We have also studied the determination of Buckling load from frequency study incase of a <b>steel</b> <b>flat.</b> When <b>steel</b> <b>flat</b> is subjected to increasing axial load the operating frequency is observed to decrease. When this operating frequency tends to zero the axial load nears the buckling load of that structure. 30 cm <b>steel</b> <b>flat</b> is tested in a UTM under increasing axial load. The initial frequency under no load condition is 260 Hz. Under a load of 0. 4 ton the first frequency decreases to 168 Hz. Extrapolating the decreasing trend we get the buckling load as 1. 1739 ton. A similar trend was observed in case of second frequencies. The vibration analysis of the foundations of various machines will help us in designing them such that their serviceability is increased. Similarly, fiber reinforced composites are being used in various structural members. These demands require a deeper understanding of fiber composite behavior. Composites offer great promise as light weight and strong structural materials.
