500|$|Francescatti's lawyer {{claimed in}} December 2012 that Gaga used an {{additional}} unlicensed sample in [...] "Judas" [...] and then incorporated it into [...] "Invading My Mind". It was alleged that Gaga asked Lopez for a credit on [...] "Invading My Mind" [...] to [...] "cover her tracks", with Francescatti's lawyer claiming {{that she did}} not even contribute to the song. The lawsuit claimed to have uncovered text messages between Gaga and RedOne proving that she had stolen the <b>sample</b> <b>loop</b> used in both [...] "Judas" [...] and [...] "Invading My Mind".|$|E
500|$|... "That's The Way Love Goes" [...] {{contains}} a <b>sample</b> <b>loop</b> of [...] "Papa Don't Take No Mess" [...] written by James Brown, Fred Wesley, Charles Bobbit, and John Starks. The song [...] "Again", was originally just an experimental sound the production duo was considering. While Jackson found its melody compelling, the trio {{did not give}} the song serious contemplation until the film producers from Poetic Justice requested a ballad for the film's soundtrack. Jackson subsequently wrote the lyrics for [...] "Again" [...] and shaped them around Jam's melody. The song was arranged by Lee Blaskey and accompanied {{by members of the}} Minnesota Orchestra and the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra.|$|E

500|$|Jam noted it was commonplace for Jackson to sing her vocals {{with the}} base track {{first and then}} {{have the rest of}} the song built around it in order to make her voice the center of the piece. [...] "Janet did all of her {{background}} vocals and not just the lead vocals. The idea with her has always been that she does all of her own vocals, so that it's totally a Janet record." [...] On the title track [...] "Rhythm Nation", her vocals range from Bb3 to G5, climaxing within its middle eight. Musicologist Richard J. Ripani observed the album and title track showcased the variety of contemporary R styles, making [...] "use of elements across the R spectrum, including use of a <b>sample</b> <b>loop</b> , triplet swing, rapped vocal parts and blues notes (D naturals and G naturals)." [...] This style of music, known as new jack swing, was immensely popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Though officially credited to the production techniques of Teddy Riley, Ripani theorized Riley was influenced by Jackson's 1986 single [...] "Nasty", which also features a distinctive triplet swing. Jon Pareles observed the album's diversity catered {{to a wide variety of}} radio formats, including pop, quiet storm, Adult contemporary and mainstream rock. [...] "Black Cat" [...] was a stand-out for the record, not only for being composed exclusively by Jackson, but for its stark departure from her general style of music, delving into hard rock. While Jellybean Johnson was elected to produce it, Dave Berry was recruited to play guitar for the song. It was recorded using a mixture of Rockman and Marshall amplifier to give the song a heavy metal sound.|$|E

The injection valve has a sample loading port through which the sample can be loaded into the injection loop, usually from a hypodermic syringe using a Luer-lock connection.|$|E

Their first release was ReCycle, a <b>sample</b> <b>loop</b> editor that could change the tempo of a loop without affecting the pitch. The export medium was Propellerhead's own REX format. ReCycle was launched in conjunction with Steinberg, who marketed it as a companion to Cubase, as it brought a simple way of gaining control over tempo and timing of audio loops.|$|E
50|$|The {{components}} of a CCC system are similar to most liquid chromatography configurations such as high-performance liquid chromatography. One or more pumps deliver the phases to the column which is the CCC instrument itself. Samples are introduced into the column through a <b>sample</b> <b>loop</b> filled with an automated or manual syringe. The outflow is monitored with various detectors such as ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy or mass spectrometry. The operation of the pumps, CCC instrument, sample injection, and detection may be controlled manually or with a microprocessor.|$|E
