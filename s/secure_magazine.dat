5000|$|The agency's {{first account}} was <b>securing</b> <b>magazine</b> {{advertising}} space for Wedgwood. It had its first successful ad with Ogilvy's concept [...] "The Guinness Guide to Oysters", which {{was followed by}} several other similar food and Guinness pairing guides. Hewitt, Ogilvy, Benson, & Mather's first large client was Sunoco (then called Sun Oil), procured by Hewitt in February 1949. Helena Rubinstein cosmetics was the first client won by Ogilvy.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} {{observers}} noted smoke {{coming from the}} vicinity of No. 3 turret and the aircraft area just forward of it, just before the explosion. Compared with other nations' warships in wartime service, Japanese battleships contained {{a large amount of}} flammable materials including wooden decking, furniture, and insulation, as well as cotton and wool bedding. Although she had been modernized in the 1930s, some of the Mutsus original electrical wiring may have remained in use. While fire in the <b>secure</b> <b>magazines</b> was a very remote possibility, a fire in an area adjacent to the No. 3 magazine could have raised the temperature to a level sufficient to ignite the highly sensitive black-powder primers stored in the magazine and thus cause the explosion.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>magazine</b> <b>secures</b> {{much of its}} {{material}} from [...] "insider" [...] sources, and promotes contact with its Goldhawk phone line.|$|R
50|$|The {{inclusion}} of Holmes's re-worked essays in The Atlantic Monthly in 1857 helped <b>secure</b> that <b>magazine's</b> early success and was well received by critics and readers alike. In book form, The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table sold ten thousand copies in only three days. It has become Holmes's most enduring work.|$|R
50|$|The Skinny {{was founded}} and {{launched}} in 2005 {{as a free}} Edinburgh and Glasgow listings magazine. From the outset, the <b>magazine</b> <b>secured</b> interviews with high-profile music acts, including Mogwai, Pearl Jam, GZA and Muse.|$|R
50|$|Since September 2012, Steinberg has {{authored}} {{a column}} entitled Business, Cybersecurity, and Life, {{which was published}} by Forbes until July 2015, and since then by Inc.

50|$|Another was the Elizabeth Kellog. This ship, {{which had}} been torpedoed and {{abandoned}} on the 23rd, ran around the survivors (she was still underway because the engines could not be <b>secured).</b> Her after <b>magazine</b> exploded and she burned for 12 hours before sinking.|$|R
50|$|Not {{long after}} the {{relocation}} to New York, Mays <b>secured</b> the <b>magazine's</b> first newsstand distribution agreement, quickly increasing the publication's distribution from 30,000 to 80,000. The first newsstand edition of The Source featured rap performer Tracy Lauren Marrow, also known as Ice-T, in New Jack City. The magazine was heavily funded by selling ad space throughout it, most notably the ongoing Tommy Boy ad. Tom Silverman and Monica Lynch are cited as being extremely supportive of The Source in its earliest days.|$|R
50|$|In March 2007, the <b>magazine</b> <b>secured</b> {{the first}} UK {{interview}} with Arcade Fire {{after the release}} of hit album Neon Bible. The following month, it secured the first UK magazine cover for the band Battles in anticipation of the release of their debut album Mirrored.|$|R
60|$|Another {{company was}} to run down and <b>secure</b> the <b>magazine,</b> and, {{breaking}} it open, to serve out cartridges to all. Two other companies were to rush aft and overpower the officers; the sixth and seventh were to form round {{the head of the}} hatchway leading to the decks where the sailors slept, and to allow only those to come on deck who had entered into the plot. The other three companies were already on deck. The arrangements were excellent, but the care taken in preparing for them, and the necessity for doing this in silence lest the stir should be heard and an alarm be given on deck, occupied time which the officers were turning to advantage.|$|R
5000|$|The 75 {{rounds of}} {{ammunition}} was evenly distributed in {{each side of the}} magazine with a central feed [...] "tower" [...] where the ammunition is fed to the bolt. Various methods where used to <b>secure</b> the <b>magazines</b> in the aircraft, while a carrier of 3 mags each were used on ground. Ammunition was fed by a spring forced spiral double-drum containing 75 rounds total (not 150 as is often mistakenly claimed). This combined with a firing rate of 1000+ rpm means it could empty the magazine in 4.5 seconds or less. Typical practice was to provide at least 10 reloads for each gun on the aircraft, not including the magazine on the gun.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>magazine</b> <b>secured</b> a {{booth at}} the IFBB Mr. Olympia contest held on September 15, 1990 in Chicago. At the {{conclusion}} of that competition, the booth handed out press releases announcing the WBF's formation. The press release stated that the WBF would [...] "revamp professional bodybuilding with dramatic new events and the richest prize money {{in the history of}} the sport." [...] It also mentioned that Tom Platz would be Director of Talent Development for the organization.|$|R

40|$|The Plutonium Immobilization Program (PIP) is a {{joint venture}} between the Savannah River Site (SRS), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). When {{operational}} in 2008, the PIP will fulfill the nation's nonproliferation commitment by placing surplus weapons-grade plutonium in a permanently stable ceramic form and making it unattractive for reuse. Since there are significant radiation and security concerns, the program team is developing novel and unique technology to remotely perform plutonium immobilization tasks. The remote task covered in this paper employs a jointed arm robot to load seven 3. 5 inch diameter, 135 -pound cylinders (magazines) through the 4 inch diameter neck of a stainless steel canister. Working through the narrow canister neck, the robot <b>secures</b> the <b>magazines</b> into a specially designed rack pre-installed in the canister. To provide the deterrent effect, the canisters are filled with a mixture of high-level waste and glass at the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) ...|$|R
50|$|Before 1866, {{the powder}} {{magazine}} {{was in the}} southern part of the interior. Slightly before the Turkish attack, and in fear that it could easily be broken into and the monastery blown up, the munitions were moved to the cellar, which was situated approximately 75 centimetres below where it had been originally placed, which was more <b>secure.</b> The powder <b>magazine</b> is an oblong vaulted building. It is 21 metres long and 5.4 metres wide and was destroyed entirely during an explosion in 1866, with the exception of a small part of the vault in the western part of the room.|$|R
60|$|It was now harvest, and our crop in good order: {{it was not}} {{the most}} {{plentiful}} increase I had seen in the island, but, however, it was enough to answer our end; for from twenty-two bushels of barley we brought in and thrashed out above two hundred and twenty bushels; and the like in proportion of the rice; which was store enough for our food to the next harvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards had been on shore with me; or, if we had been ready for a voyage, it would very plentifully have victualled our ship to have carried us to any part of the world; that is to say, any part of America. When we had thus housed and <b>secured</b> our <b>magazine</b> of corn, we fell to work to make more wicker-ware, viz. great baskets, in which we kept it; and the Spaniard was very handy and dexterous at this part, and often blamed me that I did not make some things for defence of this kind of work; but I saw no need of it.|$|R
6000|$|From Erfurt, on {{the night}} of his arrival, finding the Dauphiness in such humor, Friedrich had ordered Ferdinand of Brunswick with his Division and Prince Moritz with his, both of whom were still at Naumburg, to go on {{different}} errands,--Ferdinand out Halberstadt-Magdeburg way, whither Richelieu, vulture-like, if not eagle-like, is on wing; Moritz to Torgau, to <b>secure</b> our <b>magazine</b> and be on the outlook there. Both of them marched on the morrow (November 14th): and are sending him news,--seldom comfortable news; mainly that, in spite of all one can do (and it is not little on Ferdinand's part, the Richelieu vultures, 80,000 of them, floating onward, leagues broad, are not to be kept out of Halberstadt, well if out of Magdeburg itself;--and that, in short, the general conflagration, in those parts too, is progressive. [In Orlich's First Moritz, pp. 71-89; and in Westphalen, ii. 23-143 (about Ferdinand): interesting Documentary details, Autographs of Friedrich, &c., in regard to both these Expeditions.] Moritz, peaceable for some weeks in Torgau Country, was to have an eye on Brandenburg withal, on Berlin itself; and before long Moritz will see something noticeable there! ...|$|R
5000|$|Frazier was {{routinely}} photographed and popularized {{the famous}} “white-face” look; powdered white skin contrasted by red painted lips combined with perfectly coiffed dark hair. (She later said she suffered from neck problems because she rarely moved her head {{for fear of}} mussing her hair.) During this time, Frazier developed anorexia and bulimia to keep her weight down. Both disorders would plague her {{for the remainder of}} her life. In 1938, the year of her debut, Frazier was dubbed the #1 Glamour Girl. The title character in the long-running comic strip Brenda Starr, Reporter was named after her.In November, her photograph appeared on the cover of Life <b>magazine,</b> <b>securing</b> her international fame. Frazier would go on to pose for Woodbury soap and Studebaker car ads (even though she could not drive), among others.|$|R
60|$|David Duffy, who {{had fallen}} upon a volume of Dickens, was growing purple in the face, because of his habit of {{restraining}} laughter until it forced its way in little squeaks through his nose. Stephen Lockley, who had evidently got hold of something more serious, sat on a locker, his elbows resting on his knees, the book in his hands, and a solemn frown on his face. Hawkson was making desperate efforts to commit to memory a hymn, with the tune {{of which he had}} recently fallen in love, and the meaning of which was, unknown to himself, slowly but surely entering deep into his awakening soul. Bob Lumsden, who read his pamphlet by the binnacle light on deck, had <b>secured</b> an American <b>magazine,</b> the humorous style of which, being quite new to him, set him off ever and anon into hearty ripples of laughter.|$|R
5000|$|Ryusuke Genda is the forty-three-year-old {{captain of}} the Library Task Force and is ranked Supervising Librarian Third Class.

He is very strong, and Kasahara even thinks he has enough brawn to take on a bear. He is a veteran field {{commander}} and possesses great politic acumen; on one operation he ensured the Media Betterment Act forces <b>secured</b> books and <b>magazines</b> the Library Defense Force already had copies of so that they do not leave empty handed and in disgrace. He is willing to take great risks to achieve objectives, such as purchasing a building for declared use as a future library only so that the Task Force could raid the premises in order to rescue Kasahara and Inamine when they are taken hostage.|$|R
6000|$|Friedrich's {{motions and}} {{procedures}} in canton-quarters, through Winter and in late months, {{have led to}} the belief that he means to stand on the defensive; that the scene of the Campaign will probably be Saxony; and that Austria, for recovering injured Saxony, for recovering dear Silesia, will have to take an invasive attitude. And Austria is busy everywhere preparing with that view. Has Tolpatcheries, and advanced Brigades, still harassing about in the Lausitz. A great Army assembling at Prag,--Browne forward towards the Metal Mountains <b>securing</b> posts, gathering <b>magazines,</b> for the crossing into Saxony there. There, it is thought, the tug of war will probably be. Furious, and strenuous, it is not doubted, on this Friedrich's part: but against such odds, what can he do? With Austrians in front, with Russians to left, with French to right and arear, not to mention Swedes and appendages: surely here, if ever, is a lost King!-- ...|$|R
5000|$|The Lee-Enfield rifle {{was derived}} from the earlier Lee-Metford, a {{mechanically}} similar black-powder rifle, which combined James Paris Lee's rear-locking bolt system with a barrel featuring rifling designed by William Ellis Metford. The Lee action cocked the striker on the closing stroke of the bolt, making the initial opening much faster and easier compared to the [...] "cock on opening" [...] (i.e., the firing pin cocks upon opening the bolt) of the Mauser Gewehr 98 design. The rear-mounted lugs place the bolt operating handle much closer to the operator, over the trigger, making it quicker to operate than traditional designs like the Mauser. The action features helical locking surfaces (the technical term is interrupted threading). This means that final head space is not achieved until the bolt handle is turned down all the way. The British probably used helical locking lugs to allow for chambering imperfect or dirty ammunition and that the closing cam action is distributed over the entire mating faces of both bolt and receiver lugs. This is one reason the bolt closure feels smooth. The rifle was also equipped with a detachable sheet-steel, 10-round, double-column magazine, a very modern development in its day. Originally, the concept of a detachable magazine was opposed in some British Army circles, as some feared that the private soldier might be likely to lose the magazine during field campaigns. Early models of the Lee-Metford and Lee-Enfield even used a short length of chain to <b>secure</b> the <b>magazine</b> to the rifle.|$|R

2500|$|In mid April 1757, the {{regiment}} formed {{part of the}} army that invaded Bohemia. On 6 May, although in the region, {{the regiment}} did not take part to the Battle of Prague.

They were deployed in the cavalry vanguard at the extreme left under General von Zieten. At the end of August, the regiment {{was part of the}} small Prussian army assembled at Dresden [...] by Frederick II to head towards Thuringia and to offer battle to the Franco-Imperial army invading Saxony.

60|$|The {{king was}} {{exceedingly}} provoked at this repulse, and {{indeed it was}} a great surprise to us all, for certainly never prince began a war against the whole strength of his kingdom under the circumstances that he was in. He had not a garrison, or a company of soldiers in his pay, not a stand of arms, or a barrel of powder, a musket, cannon or mortar, not a ship of all the fleet, or money in his treasury to procure them; whereas the Parliament had all his navy, and ordnance, stores, magazines, arms, ammunition, and revenue in their keeping. And this I take to be another defect of the king's counsel, and a sad instance of the distraction of his affairs, that when he saw how all things were going to wreck, as it was impossible but he should see it, and 'tis plain he did see it, that he should not long enough before it came to extremities <b>secure</b> the navy, <b>magazines,</b> and stores of war, in the hands of his trusty servants, that would have been sure to have preserved them for his use, {{at a time when he}} wanted them.|$|R
5000|$|Gulbranssen {{demonstrated}} {{a talent for}} drawing at an early age, and attended a number of drawing schools starting at age twelve. At age fifteen he produced a series of humorous drawings which he sent to a Danish joke <b>magazine,</b> <b>securing</b> for himself {{a small amount of}} supplementary income in the process. He enrolled in the Royal Norwegian Art and Handicraft School in the fall of 1909. This was a , where, {{with the exception of a}} hiatus in 1911, he continued his studies until 1916. In 1914, a drawing of a horse that he had made was selected for the 1914 Jubilee Exhibition. [...] Werenskiold inspired me to draw, simply draw. Gulbranssen’s personal notes. [...] One of his professors once said to him while Gulbranssen was enlarging a drawing: “Take life in its true proportions; it is hard enough as it is. By reshaping it, one is apt to find small joys and large sorrows. Follow it exactly as it is, take hold of what is important, remain simple. I am showing you an essential truth: simplicity is life’s greatest art.” Gulbranssen found good use for this advice in the course of writing his books.|$|R

And now having a full supply of food for all the guests expected, I gave the Spaniard leave to go over to the main, to see what he could do with those he left behind him there: I gave him a strict charge in writing not to bring any man with him, who would not first swear, in the presence of himself and of the old savage, that he would no way injure, fight with, or attack the person he should find in the island, who was so kind to send for them in order to their deliverance; but that they would stand by and defend him against all such attempts; and wherever they went, would be entirely under, and subjected to his command; and that this should be put in writing, and signed with their hands: how we were to have this done, when I knew they had neither pen or ink, that indeed was a question which we never asked.|$|R

60|$|When the King {{set off for}} Hampton Court, {{the gentlemen}} and {{soldiers}} {{who had been with}} him followed him out of town as far as Kingston-upon-Thames; next day, Lord Digby came to them from the King at Hampton Court, in his coach and six, to inform them that the King accepted their protection. This, the Parliament said, was making war against the kingdom, and Lord Digby fled abroad. The Parliament then immediately applied themselves to getting hold of the military power of the country, well knowing that the King was already trying hard to use it against them, and that he had secretly sent the Earl of Newcastle to Hull, to <b>secure</b> a valuable <b>magazine</b> of arms and gunpowder that was there. In those times, every county had its own magazines of arms and powder, for its own train-bands or militia; so, the Parliament brought in a bill claiming the right (which up to this time had belonged to the King) of appointing the Lord Lieutenants of counties, who commanded these train- bands; also, of having all the forts, castles, and garrisons in the kingdom, put into the hands of such governors as they, the Parliament, could confide in. It also passed a law depriving the Bishops of their votes. The King gave his assent to that bill, but would not abandon the right of appointing the Lord Lieutenants, though he said he was willing to appoint such as might be suggested to him by the Parliament. When the Earl of Pembroke asked him whether he would not give way on that question for a time, he said, 'By God! not for one hour!' and upon this he and the Parliament went to war.|$|R
