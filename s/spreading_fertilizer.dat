50|$|For example, if a {{researcher}} feeds an experimental artificial sweetener to sixty laboratory rats and observes that ten of them subsequently become sick, {{the underlying cause}} could be the sweetener itself or something unrelated. Other variables, {{which may not be}} readily obvious, may interfere with the experimental design. For instance, the artificial sweetener might be mixed with a dilutant and it might be the dilutant which causes the effect. To control for the effect of the dilutant, another treatment is added which is the dilutant alone. Now the experiment is controlled for the dilutant and the experimenter can distinguish between sweetener, dilutant and non-treatment. Controls are most often necessary where a confounding factor cannot easily be separated from the primary treatments. For example, {{it may be necessary to}} use a tractor to spread fertilizer where there is no other practicable way to spread fertilizer. The simplest solution is to have a treatment where a tractor is driven over plots without <b>spreading</b> <b>fertilizer</b> and in that way the effects of tractor traffic are controlled.|$|E

40|$|Stereovision {{can be used}} to {{characterize}} of the fertilizer centrifugal spreading process and to control the <b>spreading</b> <b>fertilizer</b> distribution pattern on the ground reference. Fertilizer grains, however, resemble each other and the grain images contain little information on texture. Therefore, the accuracy of stereo matching algorithms in literature cannot be used as a reference for stereo images of fertilizer grains. In order to evaluate stereo matching algorithms applied to images of grains a generator of synthetic stereo particle images is presented in this paper. The particle stereo image generator consists of two main parts: the particle 3 D position generator and the virtual stereo rig. The particle 3 D position generator uses a simple ballistic flight model and the disc characteristics to simulate the ejection and the displacement of grains. The virtual stereo rig simUlates the stereo acquisition system and generates stereo images, a disparity map and an occlusion map. The results are satisfying and present an accurate reference to evaluate stereo particles matching algorithms...|$|E

40|$|A {{hand-operated}} {{machine that}} buries fertilizer some 5 cm {{below the surface}} of rice paddies should enable a farmer to halve his fertilizer costs yet still maintain his yield levels. <b>Spreading</b> <b>fertilizer</b> in the conventional way on paddies is very wasteful, as only about one-third reaches the crop. Consequently, rice farmers have not made full use of fertilizer to boost their yields In 1982 engineers at the Inter' national Rice Research Institute (IRRI) began a project to develop a machine that would place the fertilizer into the soil and so avoid wastage. Laboratory experiments have shown that once fertilizer is placed in deep furrows these have to be closed quickly otherwise much of the fertilizer will be lost. Other tests have shown that, up to a depth of 10 cm, the deeper the fertilizer is placed the better. But getting it down to that depth is hard work, so the engineers compromised and aimed at a depth of 4 to 5 cm. Many machines were designed and tried but IRRI have selected two or three designs which are suited to different soil conditions. The applicator has a small auger that drills the fertilizer into the soil and then closes up the furrow as it moves forward. The auger itself moves up and down, taking its drive from the wheels. There are single, two and four-row machines that can be easily pushed through the paddy either just before or just after transplanting. Using the applicators it is possible {{to increase the amount of}} fertilizer that reaches the crop from 30 % to 50 %, and IRRI researchers expect rice farmers to use up to 50 % less fertilizer to get the same yields. There are now over 100 machines in operation, 50 in the Philippines and the remainder in other Asian countries. So far the machines have been well received by farmers. The next stage is to get local manufacturers to produce the applicators. For further information write to: International Rice Research Institute P.

40|$|Background: Broadcast {{fertilizer}} distribution using spinner-disc spreaders equipped with variable-rate technology {{has become a}} widely adopted practice. However, a few spinner-disc spreaders provide dual bins permitting the independent metering of two products. The questions at hand does the individual {{fertilizer distribution}} pattern vary if two products are applied in blended form or independently metered onto the spinner discs. Therefore, this study compares the distribution uniformity of a common phosphorus and potassium fertilizers applied using variable-rate technology in blended versus independently metered forms. Methods: A common US spinner-disc spreader with a dual bin, {{and the ability to}} independently meter two products onto the spinner-discs was used for this study. Prior to <b>spreading</b> <b>fertilizer,</b> particle analysis determined that the bulk density of diammonium phosphate (DAP), muriate of potash, and a blended fertilizer (10 - 26 - 26) were 1009, 1105, and 1025 kg m- 3, respectively. All three fertilizer mixtures were broadcast and nutrient distributions determined using standard procedures. Different spinner disc speeds (600, 700 and 800 RPM) and application rates (220 and 440 kg ha- 1) were included as treatments. Results and discussions: Results indicated differences between independently metered DAP and potash versus blended. Distribution patterns did not vary at the different application rates. Also, {{it was found that the}} application rate and divider position had no effect on the efficiency of fertilizer distribution, while the disc speed improved distribution uniformity. Conclusion: These results indicate that while spinner-disc spreaders are inefficient by nature, opportunities exist to increase distribution uniformity through using newer technology such as dual bin spreaders...|$|E

40|$|Sugar beet seeders {{have been}} {{developed}} in other countries, in order to place nitrogen into the soil at a few cen-timeters from the seed. Placing fertilizer has proved safe for seedling emergence, successful in reducing soil resid-ual nitrogen at harvest, sometimes even better-yielding than broadcast applications. In a 3 -year research on sugar beet, <b>spreading</b> <b>fertilizer</b> on the soil surface followed by incorporation was compared with placing in rows 6 and 3 cm far from the seed ones, slightly deeper than the seed, in combination with two rates of urea-N, 60 and 120 kg ha- 1, plus an unfertilized check. The course of soil mineral nitrogen and that of N-uptake were evaluated during crop cycle. Yield and quality were evaluated at harvest. Nitrogen placement close to the seed (3 cm) negatively af-fected crop emergence. In the plant-soil system, placement showed a higher soil N-content in the first phases and a lower plant uptake at harvest. As for yield, placement attained a slightly-lower level than broadcasting at 60 kg N ha- 1 of N, almost the same at 120. No significant difference in quality was observed between the two patterns. At a certain distance from the seed, placement proved a safe way of applying fertilizer. Its yield and quality, the up-take by the plant {{and the amount of}} soil residual-N are comparable with those of broadcast fertilizer; in the case of soil nitrogen, it is perceived that the year/location effect is potentially stronger than that of rate/pattern of ap-plication.

40|$|April 1959 an {{aircraft}} {{was used for}} the first time in Britain to broadcast fertilizers on to an existing forest crop. This operation was the culmination of investigations over the previous 8 years into the causes of slow growth of spruce plantations (Picea spp.) over appreciable areas of soils derived from Culm Measures, notably at Wilsey Down forest, Cornwall, and Halwill forest, Devon. At these sites, many plantations dating from the early 1930 's are almost com-pletely 'checked', having failed to close canopy in up to 30 years.

50|$|Manure tea is {{the product}} of the manure of {{livestock}} being steeped in a bag submerged in water. This tea is used for the fertilization of crops. This is an organic alternative to chemical fertilizers and is a more sustainable practice of fertilization. The process of making manure tea begins with the collection of manure. Manure of all different types of livestock may be used. The next step in the production of manure tea involves fermenting and curing the manure that has been collected. This process involves storing the manure in a location that is free from any type of run-offs, and lies below direct sunlight. Once stored, this manure must be checked on and stirred up on a regular basis to allow the even curing of the material. Once this manure is cured properly, destroying any potentially harmful pathogens, it may be transferred into a steeping mechanism of choice. For example, placing the manure in gunny sacks, then completely submerging these bags into a bucket of water. This manure is now steeped over a desired period of time, and spread over and directly onto crops once finished. Some methods of <b>spreading</b> this <b>fertilizer</b> include a watering can or an attachment placed on a hose. The remains of manure left in the gunny sack may also be <b>spread</b> as <b>fertilizer</b> around crops. The process of using manure tea as fertilizer is considered sustainable because it utilizes an otherwise wasted product such as the manure of livestock. It is also cost effective.|$|R
