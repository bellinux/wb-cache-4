5|$|The logic board, {{the central}} circuit {{board of the}} computer, {{was based on the}} Macintosh SE design. Its size, however, was reduced using <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> <b>technology</b> to 9×5inches (23×13cm), half the size of the SE board. This redesign, and the absence of {{expansion}} slots, kept manufacturing costs low. This lack of expansion abilities, along with the small screen size and Macintosh's popularity in the burgeoning field of desktop publishing led to such oddities as video displays that connected through the SCSI port by users seeking to connect a larger full- or dual-page display to their Mac. The Classic design was used once more in 1991 for the Classic II, which succeeded the Classic and replaced the Macintosh SE/30.|$|E

In traditional DC control, {{the speed of the}} train is determined by the amount of voltage supplied to the rails. The direction of the train is determined by the polarity of the power to the rails. Since the end of the 20th century, an increasing number of enthusiasts have started using digital train control systems to determine the speed and direction of their trains.

40|$|AbstractThe {{introduction}} of microvia and <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> <b>technologies</b> into {{the manufacturing process}} for printed circuit boards (PCBs) has significantly improved the interconnection density. However, as the speed of signals for data communication on the board approaches and begins to exceed 10 Gb/s, the loss and crosstalk of copper interconnections increase. To resolve these problems, optical interconnections (OI) have been suggested as a viable solution. Literature reports have proved the photochemical nature of excimer laser ablation with its minimal thermal effect, and other ultra-violet lasers are also being investigated for the fabrication of polymer waveguides by laser ablation. In this paper, the authors demonstrate the fabrication of multimode optical polymer waveguides by using infra-red 10. 6 μm CO 2 laser micromachining to etch acrylate-based photopolymer (Truemode™).

In this study, we analyzed the ceramic radiator fins which were obtained by the screen-printing copper paste method and using scanning electron microscopy to examine the surface and the cross-sections of copper film and Cu/Ni film. The adhesive properties of copper film during electroless plating was studied.
