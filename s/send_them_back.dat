A passive DSS is a system that aids the process of decision making, but that cannot bring out explicit decision suggestions or solutions. An active DSS can bring out such decision suggestions or solutions. A cooperative DSS allows for an iterative process between human and system towards the achievement of a consolidated solution: the decision maker (or its advisor) can modify, complete, or refine the decision suggestions provided by the system, before <b>sending</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> to the system for validation, and likewise the system again improves, completes, and refines the suggestions of the decision maker and <b>sends</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> to <b>them</b> for validation.|$|R

25|$|On January 10, 1817, Captain D’Orsonnes retook Fort Douglas without {{firing a}} shot and there {{captured}} Mclellan and 15 Nor'Westers. Though not quite abandoned as rumours suggested, dwindling provisions at the fort accounted for the small garrison. Soon after, D’Orsonnes’s men captured 2 sleighs of provisions from Bas de la Rivière en route to relieve the men at Fort Douglas. D’Orsonnes next sent a force to capture Bas de la Rivière {{in order to secure}} provisions for Selkirk and his men he expected would arrive in the spring or summer. It was also taken without firing a shot. On February 19, Cuthbert Grant arrived at Rivière la Souris with 26 Métis and attempted to raise a force to go to Fort Douglas and demand the release of NWC prisoners and possibly retake the fort. Grant ordered the NWC voyageurs to take up arms and join him but they refused. He threatened to <b>send</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> to Montreal to be punished for disobeying an officer but to no effect. On the 22nd, Grant departed for Fort Douglas with a small party of Métis and freemen. Grant {{sent a letter to the}} recently returned ex-governor Miles Macdonell demanding the release of NWC prisoners but was refused. On March 3, Grant devised a plan to set up an ambush at Frog Plain to capture the boats of the Red River settlers that were expected to arrive from Jack River House, however the plan was abandoned. A second plan was to attack Selkirk’s men at Pembina, as the Métis did not wish to return home without a victory, but a dispute between Grant and one of his officers caused the venture to be abandoned while en route.|$|E
