50|$|As {{well as a}} lubricant, {{vacuum grease}} is also used as a <b>sealant</b> <b>for</b> <b>joints</b> in vacuum systems. This is usually limited to soft vacuums, as ultra high vacuum or high {{temperatures}} may give problems with the grease outgassing. Grease is most commonly used with glass vacuum systems. All metal systems usually use knife-edge seals in soft metals instead. Where O ring seals are used, these should not be greased (in static seals at least) as it can cause the O rings to become permanently distorted when compressed.|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of a new <b>sealant</b> <b>for</b> molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC) requires a study of the attack of molten carbonates on selected materials. Silica and Pyrex glasses have better corrosion resistance against molten carbonates than other glasses, but they have unsuitable thermal expansion coefficients. Comparisons have also been made between borosilicate glasses of suitable thermal expansion <b>for</b> <b>sealants</b> <b>for</b> MCFC and silica and Pyrex glasses. The corrosion kinetics in molten carbonates follows two limiting relations and involves two corrosion mechanisms. The weight loss varied linearly with time, indicating a dissolution of the glass network at short times. Longer times show corrosion, depending on the square root of time, typical of a diffusion mechanism and indicating formation of a protective layer {{on the surface of the}} glass. The main crystalline corrosion product is lithium methasilicate. The glass-corrosion rate follows the well-known Arrhenius law.
