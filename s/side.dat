5|$|A Test {{match is}} won when one <b>side</b> has scored more runs {{than the total}} runs scored by the {{opposing}} <b>side</b> during their two innings. If both sides have completed both their allocated innings and the <b>side</b> that fielded last has the higher aggregate of runs, it {{is known as a}} win by runs. This indicates the number of runs that they had scored more than the opposing <b>side.</b> If one <b>side</b> scores more runs in a single innings than the total runs scored by the other <b>side</b> in both their innings, it is known as a win by innings and runs. If the <b>side</b> batting last wins the match, it is known as a win by wickets, indicating the number of wickets that were still to fall.|$|E
5|$|A {{limited edition}} picture disc vinyl version was {{additionally}} {{released in the}} UK; it had the album cover printed on <b>Side</b> A and the track listing printed on <b>Side</b> B.|$|E
50|$|Insulated <b>siding</b> {{has emerged}} as a new <b>siding</b> {{category}} in recent years. Considered an improvement over vinyl <b>siding,</b> insulated <b>siding</b> is custom fit with expanded polystyrene foam (EPS) that is fused {{to the back of the}} <b>siding,</b> which fills the gap between the home and the <b>siding.</b>|$|R

50|$|In 1922 {{a second}} <b>siding</b> was {{opened on the}} Knott's <b>Siding</b> known as Fullwood's <b>Siding,</b> this {{operated}} until 1941. The main Knott's <b>Siding</b> was closed in 1922, and was used only as a shunt from Fullwood's <b>siding.</b>|$|R
5|$|A one-story kitchen addition, {{built in}} 1961–1962 and {{measuring}} about , {{extends from the}} northwest <b>side</b> of the original 1855 house. The addition has a gabled standing seam metal roof, and its exterior is covered in white-painted board-and-batten siding. It has a vinyl bay window on the southwest <b>side,</b> a one-over-one double-hung vinyl window on the northeast <b>side</b> and a door (adjoining {{the wall of the}} 1855 house) on the southeast <b>side.</b> An enclosed board-and-batten porch, measuring about , and a shed roof extend from the front (southwest) of the kitchen addition. The original basement under the 1855 house is accessible through this porch extension. A ghost building outline on the northwest <b>side</b> of the 1855 house indicates an earlier structure where the present kitchen addition stands.|$|E
5|$|A similar project, East <b>Side</b> Access, was instigated in December 2006. The East <b>Side</b> Access {{project will}} {{construct}} a new LIRR terminal beneath the current Grand Central Terminal, and {{will use the}} 63rd Street tunnel's lower level.|$|E
5|$|All battleships are top {{heavy and}} tend to settle upside down when they sink. Arkansas settled upside down, but a 1989 diver's sketch of the wreck shows hardly any of the {{starboard}} <b>side</b> of the hull, making it look like the ship is lying on her <b>side.</b> Most of the starboard <b>side</b> is present, but severely compacted.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the biggest}} issues with home <b>siding</b> is its {{propensity}} for rotting and warping at the seams. Majic manufactures and installs seamless <b>siding</b> to prevent these common <b>siding</b> issues. Majic is the exclusive provider of vinyl seamless <b>siding</b> in Southeast Michigan. With a classic wood-like appearance, Majic seamless <b>siding</b> is accepted in certain historical districts where traditional vinyl <b>siding</b> is not.|$|R
5000|$|Jointed {{horizontal}} <b>siding</b> (also called [...] "drop" [...] <b>siding</b> or novelty <b>siding)</b> may be shiplapped or {{tongue and}} grooved (though less common). Drop <b>siding</b> {{comes in a}} wide variety of face finishes, including Dutch Lap (also called German or Cove Lap) and log <b>siding</b> (milled with curve).|$|R
50|$|District <b>sides</b> had a {{difficult}} metamorphosis into their respective professional <b>sides</b> in Scotland. The district <b>sides</b> were not members of the Scottish Rugby Union; the amateur clubs were. This meant that many top amateur club <b>sides</b> fancied their own chances of turning professional instead of the district <b>sides.</b>|$|R
5|$|At {{international}} level, Giovinco {{has represented}} Italy {{at all levels}} since first being called up by the under-16 <b>side</b> in 2003; at youth level, he took part at the 2008 Summer Olympics with the Italian under-23 <b>side,</b> and later helped the Italy under-21 <b>side</b> to the semi-finals of the 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship. He made his debut with the Italy senior <b>side</b> in 2011, and he later took part at UEFA Euro 2012; winning a runners-up medal, and at the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup; winning a bronze medal, and also scoring his first international goal during the tournament.|$|E
5|$|At pH values {{between the}} two pKa values, the {{zwitterion}} predominates, but coexists in dynamic equilibrium with small amounts of net negative and net positive ions. At the exact midpoint {{between the two}} pKa values, the trace amount of net negative and trace of net positive ions exactly balance, so that average net charge of all forms present is zero. This pH {{is known as the}} isoelectric point pI, so pI = ½(pKa1 + pKa2). The individual amino acids all have slightly different pKa values, so have different isoelectric points. For amino acids with charged <b>side</b> chains, the pKa of the <b>side</b> chain is involved. Thus for Asp, Glu with negative <b>side</b> chains, pI = ½(pKa1 + pKaR), where pKaR is the <b>side</b> chain pKa. Cysteine also has potentially negative <b>side</b> chain with pKaR = 8.14, so pI should be calculated as for Asp and Glu, even though the <b>side</b> chain is not significantly charged at neutral pH. For His, Lys, and Arg with positive <b>side</b> chains, pI = ½(pKaR + pKa2). Amino acids have zero mobility in electrophoresis at their isoelectric point, although this behaviour is more usually exploited for peptides and proteins than single amino acids. Zwitterions have minimum solubility at their isoelectric point and some amino acids (in particular, with non-polar <b>side</b> chains) can be isolated by precipitation from water by adjusting the pH to the required isoelectric point.|$|E

50|$|Station {{also has}} a {{dedicated}} cargo <b>siding</b> for freight loading and unloading. The <b>siding</b> has 3 zones: open <b>siding</b> for coal, cement, fertilizer etc, a petroleum terminal bay of BPCL and, a closed <b>siding</b> terminal for all other type of goods. The <b>siding</b> is located about 1.9 km East of the station.|$|R
50|$|Insulated <b>siding</b> is home <b>siding</b> that {{includes}} rigid foam insulation, fused behind the exterior {{surface of the}} wall, {{for the purpose of}} reducing energy consumption, increasing the insulation value of the wall system and improving the stability and appearance of the <b>siding.</b> Currently, insulated <b>siding</b> is commercially available as a type of vinyl <b>siding.</b>|$|R
50|$|The petrie polygons of {{the regular}} 4-polytope define regular skew polygons. The Coxeter number for each coxeter group {{symmetry}} expresses how many <b>sides</b> a petrie polygon has. This is 5 <b>sides</b> for a 5-cell, 8 <b>sides</b> for a tesseract and 16-cell, 12 <b>sides</b> for a 24-cell, and 30 <b>sides</b> for a 120-cell and 600-cell.|$|R

5|$|Buffon has {{represented}} Italy at all youth levels, from the under-15 <b>side</b> to the under-23 <b>side,</b> {{as well as}} the Olympic <b>side</b> in 1996. With the Italy under-16 <b>side,</b> he reached the final of the 1993 UEFA European Under-16 Championship, saving three penalties in the semi-final shootout. With the Italy U-17 <b>side</b> he took part at the 1993 FIFA U-17 World Championship in Japan. In 1995, he reached the final of the UEFA European Under-19 Championship with the Italian U-19 <b>side.</b> He was most notably a member of Italy's 1996 UEFA European Under-21 Championship-winning squad. Buffon {{was a member of the}} Italy squad that won the gold medal for football at the 1997 Mediterranean Games in Bari, on home soil. Buffon currently holds the record for the most clean sheets with the Italian national <b>side.</b>|$|E

5|$|Comprising {{an area of}} 1.6ha (4 acres), with a {{perimeter}} of 480m (1570ft), the Scottish Parliament building is located 1km (0.6mi) east of Edinburgh city centre {{on the edge of}} the Old Town. The large site previously housed the headquarters of the Scottish and Newcastle brewery which were demolished to make way for the building. The boundary of the site is marked by the Canongate stretch of the Royal Mile on its northern <b>side,</b> Horse Wynd on its eastern <b>side,</b> where the public entrance to the building is, and Reid's Close on its western <b>side.</b> Reid's Close connects the Canongate and Holyrood Road on the southwestern <b>side</b> of the complex. The south eastern <b>side</b> of the complex is bounded by the Our Dynamic Earth visitor attraction which opened in July 1999, and Queen's Drive which fringes the slopes of Salisbury Crags.|$|E
5|$|Construction on the 63rd Street Line, {{including}} the Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station, began on November 25, 1969. The station was built {{using a combination}} of cut-and-cover construction and tunneling machines. However, after the construction of the Second Avenue Subway ceased in 1975 due to the city's severe fiscal crisis, the BMT 63rd Street Line <b>side,</b> the northern tracks, basically led to a non-existent subway line, so the BMT <b>side</b> was abandoned and walled off with a temporary orange brick wall, and a false ceiling was placed on the upper level's IND 63rd Street Line <b>side,</b> the southern <b>side.</b> Finishing touches were only applied to the IND <b>side</b> of the station. The tracks on the closed-off BMT <b>side</b> were used only to store trains outside of rush hour.|$|E

5|$|Each <b>side</b> has {{two sets}} of street stairs, with the {{full-time}} entrance at Grand Avenue and Broadway on the west end. There are two additional staircases by the crossovers; however, these are closed at night. HEET access {{at both ends of}} the mezzanine allow people to exit fare control without having to walk down to the middle of the mezzanine. Originally, there were two fare control areas at each end, which is clear from the presence of two closed staircases at the Manhattan-bound <b>side.</b> The mezzanine narrows to about two-thirds of its width on the southern <b>side</b> of the mezzanine directly to the opposite of the closed staircases. The narrowing of the mezzanine did not allow for staircases on the Queens-bound <b>side</b> in this location like on the Manhattan-bound <b>side.</b> Chain-link fence is used to separate the area inside and outside fare control. In total, this <b>side</b> of the station has four staircases in addition to the two closed ones mentioned, while the other <b>side</b> has five staircases.|$|E
