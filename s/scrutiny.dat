5|$|The Scrutineers add {{up all of}} the votes, and the Revisers {{check the}} ballots and the names on the Scrutineers' lists to ensure that no error was made. The ballots are then all burned by the Scrutineers with the {{assistance}} of the Secretary of the College and the Masters of Ceremonies. If the first <b>scrutiny</b> held in any given morning or afternoon does not result in an election, the cardinals proceed to the next <b>scrutiny</b> immediately. The papers from both scrutinies are then burned together at the end of the second <b>scrutiny.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{present in}} the United States there are three {{different}} levels of <b>scrutiny.</b> Firstly, if a law categorizes {{on the basis of}} race or national origin (which are regarded as suspect classifications), or infringes a fundamental right, strict <b>scrutiny</b> is applied. Accordingly, the law is unconstitutional unless it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. In addition, there should not be a less restrictive alternative available to achieve that compelling interest. Secondly, if the law categorizes on the basis of gender, legitimacy or similar quasi-suspect classifications, intermediate <b>scrutiny</b> is applied – the law is unconstitutional unless it is substantially related to an important government interest. Finally, the traditional rational basis review is applied if the law categorizes on some other, non-suspect, basis. In this case, the law is constitutional so long as it is reasonably related to a legitimate government interest.|$|E
5|$|In Malaysian Bar v. Government of Malaysia (1987), the Supreme Court of Malaysia {{referred}} to the strict <b>scrutiny</b> approach but asserted that in reality it was not {{very different from the}} traditional rational nexus standard, which it then proceeded to apply. The Court's endorsement of strict <b>scrutiny</b> was much less ambiguous in Government of Malaysia v. V.R. Menon (1990). It held that the impugned Act was concerned with economic and social welfare and not fundamental rights, and therefore the trial judge had erred in applying a stricter standard of review. As such, the court implicitly endorsed the application of the strict <b>scrutiny</b> test in cases concerning fundamental rights in Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|The four hijackers {{checked in}} for the flight between 07:03 and 07:39Eastern Time. At 07:03, Ghamdi checked in without any luggage while Nami checked in two bags. At 07:24, Haznawi checked in one bag and at 07:39, Jarrah checked in without any luggage. Haznawi was the only hijacker {{selected}} for extra <b>scrutiny</b> by the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS). His checked bag underwent extra screening for explosives, with no extra <b>scrutiny</b> required by CAPPS at the passenger-security checkpoint. None of the security checkpoint personnel reported anything unusual about the hijackers.|$|E
5|$|The {{staffing}} {{practices of}} Burke's Finance Committee came under <b>scrutiny</b> in local and federal investigations of ghost-payrolling abuses in local government {{and resulted in}} several indictments and convictions.|$|E
5|$|After the September 11, 2001 {{terrorist}} attacks, government <b>scrutiny</b> of {{train and}} airplane passengers substantially increased, but bus passengers are largely free of it. Baggage is seldom inspected, and cash customers {{do not require}} identification. Greyhound says that security wands have been deployed on buses, {{but they do not}} appear to be routinely used.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue that}} has {{undergone}} academic <b>scrutiny</b> {{is the nature of}} section8B(2) as an ouster clause. An ouster clause is an objectively worded provision which is drafted to exclude the jurisdiction of the courts.|$|E
5|$|Blair Cornelia Waldorf is {{the lead}} {{character}} of Gossip Girl, she is a comical overachiever who possesses both snobbish and sensitive sides. Due to her position as queen bee of Manhattan's social scene, Blair's actions and relations are under constant <b>scrutiny</b> from the mysterious Gossip Girl, a popular blogger.|$|E
5|$|Drogba faced {{problems}} off {{the pitch}} during {{the end of}} the season as his transfer from Marseille to Chelsea in July 2004 came under <b>scrutiny.</b> The Stevens inquiry in June 2007 expressed concerns because of the lack of co-operation from agents Pinhas Zahavi and Barry Silkman.|$|E
5|$|Dwayne Jones was a Jamaican 16-year-old who {{was killed}} by a violent mob in Montego Bay in 2013, after he {{attended}} a dance party dressed in women's clothing. The incident attracted national and international media attention and brought increased <b>scrutiny</b> to the status of LGBT rights in Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, growing <b>scrutiny</b> of Leopold's regime led to {{a popular}} {{campaign}} movement, centered in the United Kingdom and the United States, to force Leopold to renounce his ownership of the Congo. In many cases, the campaigns based their information on reports from British and Swedish missionaries working in the Congo.|$|E
5|$|He {{was known}} for his {{willingness}} to apply an equal degree of <b>scrutiny</b> to his own philosophical positions as to those of others, subjecting each position to rigorous analysis until he exposed its flaws. As a result, he acquired a reputation for frequently changing his own position.|$|E
5|$|Henry I's successors did not {{consider}} the royal touch fundamental, reducing its application. The ritual remained a marginal aspect of kingship until the 17th century, when its appeal grew to unprecedented proportions and when it suddenly became an object of <b>scrutiny</b> in literature.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the claims}} for 15 September 1942 are in serious doubt, {{following}} the first detailed <b>scrutiny</b> {{of the records}} of individual Allied squadrons by Australian historian Russell Brown. Moreover, Brown lists three occasions on which Marseille could not have downed as many aircraft as claimed.|$|E
5|$|In October 2017, Lohan {{received}} <b>scrutiny</b> for defending Harvey Weinstein, {{whom she}} worked with on several films, on Instagram and saying that his wife Georgina Chapman should stay with him. Weinstein {{had been accused of}} sexual harassment and sexual assault.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to acting, Kaif {{is involved with}} her mother's charity and participates in stage shows. She is guarded about her personal life, which is a subject of media <b>scrutiny,</b> as is her background.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that a proportionality analysis better safeguards equality compared to the American three-tiered <b>scrutiny</b> approach. The third limb of the proportionality test may also serve to strike down over-inclusive classifications which are currently tolerated under the rational nexus test.|$|E
5|$|Radyr and Morganstown electoral ward has an {{electorate}} of 4,368 (1 May 2008) and has {{one seat}} on Cardiff Council. The ward elected a Conservative, Roderick McKerlich, {{in the election}} of May 2008 and he was re-elected in 2012. Cllr McKerlich {{is a member of}} the Council's Environmental <b>Scrutiny</b> Committee.|$|E
5|$|Reportedly, all {{of those}} under <b>scrutiny</b> are now rarely seen in public and some have {{apparently}} left the country. They are also reportedly the subjects of an ongoing investigation to determine if any of their business practices warrant criminal prosecution.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the initial}} {{discovery}} of the plagiarism of Clowe's work, LaBeouf's other work has come under <b>scrutiny.</b> News outlets reported that LaBeouf's comic books, Let's Fucking Party and Stale N Mate, had been plagiarized from Benoît Duteurtre's The Little Girl and the Cigarette and Charles Bukowski's Assault.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} legal <b>scrutiny</b> surrounding DFS {{resulted in}} providers spending less on marketing {{in order to}} focus more on legal costs. On February 10, 2016, it was reported that ESPN had backed out of its advertising deal with DraftKings, and that Fox had marked down its investment in DraftKings by 60%—a loss of $95 million.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{cannabis}} {{and other}} drugs came under increasing <b>scrutiny</b> after {{the formation of the}} Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN) in 1930, headed by Harry J. Anslinger as part of the government's broader push to outlaw all recreational drugs.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{criticisms of the}} three-tiered <b>scrutiny</b> analysis, the most {{compelling}} reason against its adoption arguably being {{that it does not}} control judicial discretion: the identification of classifications as suspect, quasi-suspect or non-suspect involves unconstrained balancing of public and private interests, and political and social interests.|$|E
5|$|Waddingtons later {{produced}} special games during World War II which secretly contained files, a compass, a map {{printed on}} silk, and real currency hidden amongst the Monopoly money, to enable {{prisoners of war}} to escape from German camps. However, this story has come under recent <b>scrutiny</b> and is being disputed.|$|E
5|$|A week later, Marsh's {{action was}} again under <b>scrutiny</b> {{when he played}} his second shield match against Victoria in Melbourne. While Richard Callaway—the New South Wales umpire officiating the match—was {{satisfied}} with Marsh's bowling action, his Victorian counterpart Bob Crockett was concerned with the twisting of the bowler's wrist. Crockett no-balled Marsh {{three times in the}} match, but was reluctant to elucidate on the reasons for his call. Marsh took 3/39 and 3/51 respectively, dismissing Test batsmen Peter McAlister, Warwick Armstrong, Jack Worrall and Frank Laver. Marsh bowled three of his victims.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the retired}} senior U.S. {{intelligence}} official speaking to Hersh, bin Laden was ill at this point, financially supported by some within Saudi Arabia, and {{kept by the}} ISI to better manage their complex relationship with Pakistani and Afghan Islamist groups. According to the official, retired CIA officials {{emphasized the importance of}} bin Laden's courier to the press, because they were nervous over torture <b>scrutiny</b> and possible prosecution.|$|E
5|$|After {{the results}} of the first <b>scrutiny,</b> Cardinal Avila, Philip III of Spain's {{representative}} at the conclave, announced that Philip had vetoed Baronius. Baronius had critiqued the claims of Spanish monarchs in ecclesistical affairs in the volume of his Annales Ecclesiastici that had been published in 1605. This led the Spanish monarchy to have such an intense dislike for him that the publication of the volume which contained his criticism was banned in Spanish territory.|$|E
5|$|Around {{half of the}} Grenztruppen were conscripts, a lower {{proportion}} than {{in other}} branches of the East German armed forces. Many potential recruits were screened out as potentially unreliable; for instance, actively religious individuals or those with close relatives in West Germany. They were all subjected to close <b>scrutiny</b> to assure their political reliability and were given intensive ideological indoctrination.|$|E
5|$|As First Lady of the United States, Clinton was an {{advocate}} for gender equality and healthcare reform. Her marital relationship came under public <b>scrutiny</b> during the Lewinsky scandal, which led to her issuing a statement reaffirming her commitment to the marriage. In 2000, Clinton was elected as the first female Senator from New York. She was re-elected to the Senate in 2006. Running for president in 2008, she won far more delegates than any previous female candidate, but lost the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama.|$|E
5|$|As {{the content}} of comics matured {{throughout}} the 1980s, they {{became the subject of}} increasing <b>scrutiny.</b> In 1986, Calgary comic shop Comic Legends was raided and charged with obscenity. In response, Derek McCulloch and Paul Stockton of Strawberry Jam Comics established the Comic Legends Legal Defense Fund to help retailers, distributors, publishers, and creators fight against obscenity charges. To raise funds, they published two True North anthologies of Canadian talent.|$|E
5|$|At a 2006 {{conference on}} Commonwealth honours, Christopher McCreery, {{an expert on}} Canada's honours, raised the concern that the three grades of the Order of Canada were {{insufficient}} to recognize the nation's very best; one suggestion was to add two more levels to the order, equivalent to knighthoods in Australian and British orders. The order of precedence also came under <b>scrutiny,</b> particularly the anomaly that all three grades of the Order of Canada supersede the top levels {{of each of the}} other orders (except the Order of Merit), contrary to international practice.|$|E
5|$|Aviation {{safety in}} Brazil {{had been under}} {{increased}} <b>scrutiny</b> following the mid-air collision in September 2006 over the Amazon of Gol Transportes Aéreos Flight 1907 and an Embraer Legacy 600 (see Brazil's 2006-2007 aviation crisis). Congonhas was singled out for having safety issues relating to operations in wet weather due to its location and runway characteristics for the traffic it serves.|$|E
5|$|Because The Birth of a Nation {{attracted}} increased <b>scrutiny</b> due {{to possible}} Oscar nominations, {{and the film}} itself depicts a brutal rape, there was significant press coverage about damage control by Fox Searchlight Pictures, the studio releasing the film. Interviews in Variety and Deadline were a focus, as was Parker's response to the event in a Facebook post.|$|E
5|$|Blackout {{represents}} a musical departure from Spears' earlier work featuring a foreboding and atmospheric tone {{in terms of}} musical and lyrical direction. She collaborated with producers including Danja, Bloodshy & Avant, Sean Garrett, and The Neptunes in several recording studios around the United States, including Spears' home in Los Angeles, {{with the intention of}} creating uptempo, high-energy music. Their efforts resulted in a primarily dance-pop and electropop record, which sees additional influences from Euro disco, dubstep and funk. The lyrical themes revolve around love, fame, media <b>scrutiny,</b> sex, and clubbing.|$|E
5|$|Crinolines {{were worn}} by women of every social {{standing}} and class across the Western world, from royalty to factory workers. This led to widespread media <b>scrutiny</b> and criticism, particularly in satirical magazines such as Punch. They were also hazardous if worn without due care. Thousands of women {{died in the}} mid-19th century {{as a result of}} their hooped skirts catching fire. Alongside fire, other hazards included the hoops being caught in machinery, carriage wheels, gusts of wind, or other obstacles.|$|E
5|$|Eriksson's {{private life}} came under <b>scrutiny,</b> with an number of well-publicised accusations of trysts with women {{including}} Ulrika Jonsson, and FA secretary Faria Alam, despite his on-going relationship with Nancy Dell'Olio. Though Eriksson maintained in press conferences that {{his personal life}} was a private matter, his relationships with Jonsson in 2002 and Alam in 2004 were subject to tabloid headlines for several weeks.|$|E
