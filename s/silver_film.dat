40|$|In general, {{creation}} of superhydrophobic surfaces {{is composed of}} two steps: (i) {{creation of}} a rough surface and (ii) passivation of the surface with the low surface energy molecules or coatings. Superhydrophobic properties cannot be achieved on a surface without these two essential factors fulfilled. In the present work we have demonstrated that superhydrophobic <b>silver</b> <b>films</b> on copper (Cu) substrates can be created in just a one-step process via galvanic reactions by immersing the Cu substrates in silver nitrate solution containing benzoic acid, simplifying the complexity of two different steps involved in the former method. <b>Silver</b> <b>films</b> were also fabricated using similar process without benzoic acid for comparative studies.

50|$|There are {{two options}} for realizing apertureless NSOM-Raman technique: TERS and SERS. TERS is {{frequently}} used for apertureless NSOM-Raman and can significantly enhance the spatial resolution. This technique requires a metal tip {{to enhance the}} signal of the sample. That is why an AFM metal tip is usually used for enhancing the electric field for molecule excitation. Raman spectroscopy was combined with AFM in 1999. A very narrow aperture of the tip was required to obtain a relatively high spatial resolution; such aperture reduced the signal and was difficult to prepare. In 2000, Stȍckle et al. first designed a setup combining apertureless NSOM, Raman and AFM techniques, in which the tip had a 20 nm thick granular <b>silver</b> <b>film</b> on it. They reported a large gain in the Raman scattering intensity of a dye film (brilliant cresyl blue) deposited on a glass substrate if a metal-coated AFM tip was brought {{very close to the}} sample. About 2000-fold enhancement of Raman scattering and a spatial resolution of ~55 nm were achieved.|$|E
5000|$|Monochromatic {{aluminium}} K-alpha X-rays {{are normally}} produced by diffracting and focusing {{a beam of}} non-monochromatic X-rays off of a thin disc of natural, crystalline quartz with a <1010> orientation. The resulting wavelength is 8.3386 angstroms (0.83386 nm) which corresponds to a photon energy of 1486.7 eV. Aluminum K-alpha X-rays have an intrinsic FWHM of 0.43 eV, centered on 1486.7 eV (E/ΔE = 3457). For a well optimized monochromator, the energy width of the monochromated aluminum K-alpha X-rays is 0.16 eV, but energy broadening in common electron energy analyzers (spectrometers) produces an ultimate energy resolution {{on the order of}} FWHM=0.25 eV which, in effect, is the ultimate energy resolution of most commercial systems. When working under practical, everyday conditions, high-energy-resolution settings will produce peak widths (FWHM) between 0.4-0.6 eV for various pure elements and some compounds. For example, in a spectrum obtained in 1 minute at a pass energy of 20 eV using monochromated aluminum K-alpha X-rays, the Ag 3d5/2 [...] peak for a clean <b>silver</b> <b>film</b> or foil will typically have a FWHM of 0.45 eV.|$|E
50|$|The biggest {{technical}} challenge {{faced by the}} designers was the heat to which the probe is subject when it is near the sun. At 0.3 astronomical units from the Sun which undergoes heat flow is 11 solar constant (11 {{times the amount of}} received heat in the Earth's orbit) or 22.4 kW per square meter exposed. The temperature can then reach 370 C. The solar cells and the central compartment of the equipment and instruments are located must be maintained at much lower temperatures. The solar cell should not exceed 165 C, while the central compartment should be maintained between -10 and 20 C. These restrictions require the rejection of 96% of the heat received from the sun. The conical shape of the solar panels is one of the measures taken to reduce the flow of heat. By tilting the solar panels with respect to sunlight arriving perpendicularly to the axis of the probe, reflected a greater proportion of the solar radiation. Furthermore, as discussed above, the solar panels are covered 50% of its surface mirrors developed by NASA dubbed Second Surface Mirrors (SSM). These are made of fused quartz, with a <b>silver</b> <b>film</b> on the inner face, which is itself covered with a dielectric material. The central compartment sides are entirely covered by these mirrors. For additional protection, multi-layer insulation, consisting of 18 layers of 0.25 mm Mylar or Kapton (depending on location) held apart from each other by small plastic pins intended to prevent the formation of thermal bridges, was used to partially cover the core compartment. In addition to these passive devices, the probe uses an active system based on a system of movable louvers in a star lining the bottom and top side of the compartment. The opening thereof is controlled separately by a bimetal spring whose length varies depending on the temperature and causes the opening or closing of the shutter. Resistors are also used to keep a temperature sufficient for certain equipment.|$|E

30|$|To {{elaborate}} temperature {{effect on}} PL intensity of quantized states and trap states, we compare PL intensity of quantized states {{with that of}} trap states for CdSe on the quartz coverslip and <b>silver</b> <b>films,</b> respectively. The integrated PL intensity ratio of quantized states and trap states run up to 7.1 and 23 for CdSe QDs on the quartz coverslip surface and <b>silver</b> <b>films</b> at lower temperature (4  K) as shown in Fig.  4 c, respectively. From the ratio of PL intensities of quantized states and trap states, {{it can be concluded}} that the <b>silver</b> <b>films</b> further enhance the energy transfer (ET) process from the quantized states to trap states due to the surface plasmonic coupling effect. To elucidate the temperature effect on energy transfer process from quantized states to surface states, the energy transfer model consisting of core quantized state, surface state, and ground state was established [34].|$|R
