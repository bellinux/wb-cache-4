40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the economic effects EU membership has had on the countries Austria, Finland and Sweden since their accession in 1995, primarily focusing on implications for price stability and GDP growth.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{different levels}} of wage moderation in EMU member states since {{the introduction of the}} euro. Most arguments examining wage restraint have done so relying on the assumptions that relations between EMU member states are symmetric and that wage-setting systems are similar across sectors within one country. We introduce one innovation to these approaches and develop a second existing one. The paper adopts a dual-sector approach, where exposed sector unions are still tied to a competitiveness constraint on wages, while <b>sheltered</b> <b>sector</b> unions neither face a hard monetary constraint imposed by the central bank nor are subject to a competitive one. Wage moderation is higher in countries with wage-bargaining institutions which tie wage-setters in the <b>sheltered</b> <b>sector</b> to the exposed sector through a co-ordination mechanism. The second innovation is that of asymmetries between Germany and other EMU member states...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the rising}} {{divergence}} in sectoral wage moderation within European Monetary Union (EMU) member states since {{the introduction of}} the Euro is examined. During the 1980 s and 1990 s, wage restraint cycles between exposed, manufacturing sectors, and sheltered, private services sectors within EMU candidate-countries were highly synchronous, and differences in wage inflation between sectors within countries was low. After 1996, significant divergence in sectoral wage inflation emerged, and synchronicity of wage restraint cycles between sectors collapsed after 1999. This paper will address the question of why divergence occurred between sectoral wage restraint within EMU countries after 1996. It will be argued that monetary union’s removal of national exchange rate pegs and inflation criteria, and the central banks that enforced them, accentuated wage preference divergence between actors in the exposed and <b>sheltered</b> <b>sectors,</b> enabling unions in <b>sheltered</b> <b>sectors</b> to push for high wage increases while unions in more exposed sectors had to continue with wage moderation due to competitiveness constraints. Unlike some political science literature that assumes powerful, protected sectors produce excessive wage inflation {{at the expense of the}} exposed sector, it will be argued that the European Monetary System’s fixed exchange rate arrangements, and more importantly the Maastricht inflation criteria, provided an effective monetary constraint on sheltered sector wage growth, keeping sheltered sector wage moderation in line with wage restraint developments in the exposed sector in the 1980 s and early 1990 s...|$|E

40|$|Self-recovery in {{post-disaster}} shelter is not {{the exception}} but the norm. Following earthquake, flood or storm, the majority of affected families will inevitably rebuild their homes themselves, using their own resources, {{but there is little}} support from the international community to encourage good safe building practice. While the communication of key messages about safer building has been carried out effectively in development contexts, it rarely forms a major part of humanitarian response programming. If the humanitarian <b>shelter</b> <b>sector</b> is committed to the principles of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), more can be done to support the process of safer reconstruction among self-rebuilders. This paper argues the case for the humanitarian community to link post-disaster shelter programming with the more developmental approach of communicating building safety to a much wider audience than just the most vulnerable beneficiaries.

Accordingly, the paper focusses attention on the production side of the economy to gain further insight into the trends of the current account. Empirical evidence suggests that changes in relative factor prices and a relative demand shift toward non-tradable goods account for the bulk of the observed widening of the current account surplus. In turn, the impact of these factors on the current account appears to reflect both changes in factor proportions and deviations from perfect competition in the Dutch <b>sheltered</b> <b>sector.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The {{boundary}} between the mainland and the sea – the littoral fringe - crosses several sub-environments, among them, the rocky coasts whose evolution depends on marine and sub-aerial processes {{as well as on}} the rocks’ mass properties. The study area - in central Algarve (South Portugal) - is framed in a rocky coast exposing carbonate rocks. This work identifies the main drivers to the coastal morphology in that region. Several morphological features such as beaches, cliffs, and shore platforms were surveyed, mapped, and correlated with the most common wave conditions in the area. Shore platforms show a strong correlation with the most vigorous wave climate conditions. In opposition, zeta bays occur in the more <b>sheltered</b> <b>sector</b> to the dominant waves and in a relatively straight coastline.

The paper suggests that the shift towards more market-oriented and less interventionist policies, has allowed Italy’s legal and institutional framework to come closer to the mainstream of good regulatory practices in the OECD countries. With Italy having been initially a laggard on the regulatory reform front, recent achievements have been remarkable. They are, however, incomplete. A major challenge is the need to secure competition in the <b>sheltered</b> <b>sectors</b> of the economy, where inflation inertia raises costs and affects the exposed sectors, thereby weakening international competitiveness...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to provide new {{evidence}} concerning the effect of public capital on productivity growth in Spain. To this end, the article follows the growth accounting approach, which, in addition to measuring both the direct and indirect effects of public capital on the total factor productivity, allows for assessing {{whether there is a}} distinctive impact of public capital across economic sectors. The results lead to three main conclusions: (1) Public capital has a strong influence on growth when we use data from the whole economy; (2) this influence varies across sectors, being more relevant in the exposed sectors (industry) than in <b>sheltered</b> <b>sectors</b> (agriculture, construction, and services); and (3) irrespective of the definition used for public capital, these basic results remain unchanged.

The paper shows that `true productivity' was of minor importance, being outweighted by economies of scale {{as a source of}} growth. Productivity gains are large in the `miracle years'; from the late 1960 s onwards, productivity levels taper off and cost decreases can be entirely attributed to a combination of scale economies and short-run adjustment costs. In such a framework, we analyse Italy's post-war {{economic performance}} arguing that our results confirm the widely-held opinion that the inefficiency of the service sector, lack of competition in the <b>sheltered</b> <b>sectors,</b> powerful vested interests, outdated ideologies and corruption itself account for most of the productivity slow down that is observed after the mid- 1960 s.

40|$|Many {{scholars}} {{argue that}} global forces, such as increased economic integration {{into the global economy}} or interventions from international aid agencies, are directly affecting the governance of municipalities. This paper explores the process by which international influences affect local governance by using the history of a single institution, the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board in Chennai, India, and examining the evolution of the Board's policies towards slums and slum clearance from 1970 to the present. In its early years, state level political party incentives determined the shelter policies of the Board. The World Bank donated significant amounts of money to the Board for projects in low- income shelter provision between 1975 and 1996, and attempted to significantly change <b>shelter</b> <b>sector</b> policies in the city. However, the Bank faced a great deal of resistance in imposing reforms on the Board. It was not until they radically changed institutional structures within the Board to cut ties with local political parties {{that they were able to}} successfully implement policy reform. The history of the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board suggests that institutional structures are of great importance when trying to understand the way in which international influences affect local governance. by Nithya V.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the sources of}} output shocks in Finland as compared to other EU countries. The data consists of output fluctuations in main industries in nine current EU countries for the period 1978 – 1993. The sources of output shock are considered to consist of country-specific factors, sector-specific factors and a time factor, which is common to all countries and sectors. Fluctuation is partitioned using three-dimensional analysis of variance. Output shocks in Finland are clearly more country-specific than in other EU countries. A separate examination of the time period preceding the 1990 s demonstrates that the result is not due to the exceptional recession {{in the beginning of}} the 1990 s. The more central role that the country-specific factor has in Finland as compared to other EU countries is explained by the fact that average output growth was higher in Finland than in other EU countries until the end of the 1980 s. Differences in growth rates between sectors also were larger than in other countries. Examination of the time period including the recession revealed that idiosyncratic economic cycle was clearly a more significant source of disturbances in Finland than in other countries.

The subsequent acceleration in growth resulted from increased internal competition and greater technological and organizational transfers, both associated with membership of the European Community and substantial foreign direct investment.

In the earlier period until the mid- 1980 s, these challenges were of a macro-economic nature, and the effectiveness of national policy responses depended primarily on institutional capabilities for effective coordination between wage policy and monetary policy. After the mid- 1980 s, the dominant challenges arose from the global integration of capital markets and the increasing intensity of international competition in product markets. Now the greater or lesser vulnerability of countries was primarily determined by the structure of their welfare states – in particular by the dependence on particular sources of finance and by their effects on service employment in the <b>sheltered</b> <b>sectors.</b> What mattered was the institutional and political capacity to adopt and implement unpopular changes in the policy legacies of the welfare state...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Excessive fiscal {{spending}} is commonly {{cited as a}} root of the current European debt crisis. This paper suggests, like others, that the rise of competitiveness imbalances contributing to national imbalances in total borrowing are a better explanation for systemic differences towards EMU countries ’ exposure to market speculation. We identify one driver of this divergence: a country’s capacity to limit sheltered sector wage growth, relative to wage growth in the manufacturing sector. Corporatist institutions which linked sectoral wage developments together in the surplus countries provided those with a comparative wage advantage vis-à-vis EMU’s debtor nations, which helps explain why the EMU core has emerged relatively unscathed from market speculation during the crisis despite the poor fiscal performance {{of some of the}} core countries during EMU’s early years. Using a panel regression analysis, we demonstrate that rising differentials between public and manufacturing sector wage growth, and wage governance institutions which weakly coordinate exposed and <b>sheltered</b> <b>sectors,</b> are significantly correlated with export decline.
