50|$|A {{specialized}} type of vat dye called Inkodye is {{also used}} for sun-printing due to its light-sensitive quality. Unlike other vat dyes which use oxygen to develop their color, Inkodyes are developed by light. These dyes are suspended in leuco form appearing colorless until {{they are exposed to}} UV. Their usage resembles that of cyanotype, but unlike cyanotype Inkodyes are primarily used on textiles and exist in a full range of colors. Exposure times vary from 3 to 15 minutes depending on the desired color and intensity of light. Once exposed, the <b>sensitized</b> <b>material</b> is washed in soapy water to remove dye from unexposed areas.

40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} second {{particles}} on the grain boundary deformation in 304 type {{austenitic stainless steel}} was studied. Flat tensile samples with marker scratches on the surface were strained at slow rate at intermediate temperatures (300 - 500 °C) at ambient pressure. It seems that the <b>sensitized</b> <b>material</b> decreased creep rate and needed more stress to generate deformation of grain boundary, suggesting Cr carbides decreased the grain boundary sliding. Thus, the resistance to SCC crack propagation could be improved. The Charpy tests suggested that <b>sensitized</b> <b>material</b> had lower fracture toughness; {{this was due to}} the GB carbides that acted as nucleation sites for brittle fracture.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the use of}} nonlinear ultrasound to evaluate sensitization, a precursor to stress corrosion cracking in austenitic stainless steel. Ultrasonic Rayleigh surface waves are generated on a specimen; as these waves pass through <b>sensitized</b> <b>material,</b> second harmonic generation (SHG) increases. In austenitic stainless steel with oven-induced sensitization, this increase is due only {{to the formation of}} chromium carbide precipitates, key products of the sensitization process.

40|$|Scoping stress {{corrosion}} cracking (SCC) tests of 304 stainless steel (SS) were performed in 75 C and 250 C aerated pressurized water (APW) and 250 C deaerated pressurized water (DPW). The 250 C APW environment was used to initiate intergranular {{stress corrosion}} cracking (IGSCC) and then the water was deaerated and hydrogenated to see if IGSCC continued in 250 C DPW. Tests were performed with and without 200 ppb SO{sub 4 }{sup =}. The 304 SS test materials were evaluated in either the as-received, heavily sensitized (649 C for 1 h), fully sensitized (1099 C for 1 h/water quench/ 621 C for 17 h) or 20 % cold rolled condition. At {{the beginning of each}} test sequence, specimens were subjected to continuous cycling with a 500 s rise/ 500 s fall or a 5000 s rise/ 500 s fall to promote the transition from a transgranular (TG) precrack to an IG crack. After generating a uniform crack under continuous cycling conditions, a trapezoidal waveform with 500 s rise/ 9000 s hold/ 500 s fall was used to characterize the SCC behavior. Crack growth rates (CGRs) were monitored continuously with the electric potential drop (EPD) method and were corrected based on physical crack length measurements obtained when specimens were destructively evaluated. Continuous cycling with a 500 s or 5000 s rise time was found to produce both TG faceting and IGSCC in fully sensitized 304 SS tested in 75 C APW with 7 ppm O{sub 2 } and 200 ppb SO{sub 4 }{sup =}. However, no measurable crack extension occurred when a 9000 s hold time was introduced. Extensive IGSCC occurred in heavily sensitized and fully sensitized 304 SS in 250 C APW with 1 ppm O{sub 2 } and 200 ppb SO{sub 4 }{sup =}. IGSCC initiated under continuous cycling conditions with a 500 s rise time, and rapid IGSCC occurred when a 9000 s hold time was introduced. During the trapezoidal waveform test with a 9000 s hold, CGRs ranged from 1 to 3 mils/day for the heavily <b>sensitized</b> <b>material</b> and 5 to 10 mils/day for the fully <b>sensitized</b> <b>material.</b> When the test environment was dearated and hydrogenated to 30 cc H{sub 2 }/kg H{sub 2 }O, CGRs decreased by an order of magnitude ({approx} 0. 1 mils/day), and the cracking mode in 250 C DPW was predominantly TG. The only material that exhibited evidence of IGSCC in 250 C DPW was 20 % cold rolled 304 SS. IGSCC readily initiated in 250 C APW and continued in 250 C DPW. Metallographic and fractographic examinations showed that the IG cracking was highly branched and discontinuous. Results from the scoping SCC tests have revealed significant information regarding the nature of IG and TG cracking of 304 SS in APW and DPW.

40|$|Austenitic {{stainless}} steels {{have a wide}} range of applications in the energy industry. However, these {{stainless steels}} can be susceptible to stress corrosion cracking (SCC) under normal operating environments. Of particular concern is weld sensitization, a process by which chromium carbide precipitates are formed at the grain boundaries in the heat affected zone. Sensitization reduces the resistance of stainless steels to SCC by local depletion of chromium content in the <b>sensitized</b> <b>material.</b> This research uses nonlinear Rayleigh waves to quantitatively track the sensitization of AISI 304 and AISI 304 L stainless steels which were exposed to a temperature of 675 °C with variable time. The effect of the carbon contents of the alloys (AISI 304 versus AISI 304 L) to the sensitization process and the measured nonlinearity parameters are investigated. Note that an initiallymonochromatic propagating Rayleigh wave interacts with the grain-boundary precipitates due to the sensitization and generates higher harmonics. A set of laboratory specimens were created with different degrees of sensitization and varying precipitate sizes and contents using heat treatments at 675 °C in for varying heat treatment times. The acoustic nonlinearity parameter was determined from the first and second harmonic Rayleigh waves measured in the propagation direction.

This damage mechanism requires the simultaneous occurrence of high oxygen content in the fluid, <b>sensitized</b> <b>material</b> and tensile stresses. Both sensitization and tensile stresses can be the result of the thermo-mechanical loading due to welding. The loading of the circumferential pipe welds depends on many factors, like the pipe geometry, welding techniques or welding velocity. The influence of these parameters on the thermo-mechanical loading allows the risk of IGSCC to be investigated using computational methods. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop and validate a qualified computational model for welding simulation. Within the framework of this study four multi-pass pipe welds were fabricated. The thin walled, austenitic pipes were welded by Orbital Gas Tungsen Arc Welding. During the welding process, temperatures and displacements were monitored. When welding was complete residual stress measurements were performed using X-ray diffraction techniques. The measurements during welding generated the database for the validation of the computational calculations. In doing so they enable the understanding of the thermo- mechanical effects of the welding process. An important part of the computational weld analysis is the description of the temperature-dependent elastic-plastic material behavior. Therefore, stress-strain curves were determined for different loading histories and temperatures up to 1300 °C.

A practical realization of this idea is demonstrated on blends of electron donor and electron acceptor substituted poly(viny 1 cinnamates). In the triplet <b>sensitized</b> <b>materials</b> energy migration provides an additional method of sensitivity enhancement. The photographic performance of a solid resist film depends {{not only on the}} inherent photoreactivity of its components, but also on the immediate environment of the reactants in the solid matrix which may either favor or inhibit the photochemical transformation. This aspect is particularly important in photoprocesses which involve two, or more reactants, and where the success of the photoreaction depends on their mutual configuration. In conventional photopolymers the spatial arrangement of the reactants is a matter of chance and the fraction of reactive configurations is small [l].

The IASCC susceptibility of SSs that contain > 0. 003 wt. % S increased drastically. bend tests in inert environments at 23 C were conducted on broken pieces of SSRT specimens and on unirradiated specimens of the same materials after hydrogen charging. The results of the tests and a review of other data in the literature indicate that IASCC in 289 C water is dominated by a crack-tip grain-boundary process that involves S. An initial IASCC model has been proposed. A crack growth test was completed on mill annealed Alloy 600 in high-purity water at 289 C and 320 C under various environmental and loading conditions. The results from this test are compared with data obtained earlier on several other heats of Alloy 600...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{effects of}} natural {{adjuvants}} were examined on total and differential WBC counts in lung lavage of <b>sensitized</b> guinea pigs. <b>Materials</b> and Methods: In three sensitized groups of guinea pigs including: untreated sensitized animals (S), sensitized animals treated with adjuvant G 2 (S+G 2) and G 2 F (S+G 2 F) {{as well as}} non-sensitized group (C) (n= 6 for each group), total and differential WBC counts of lung lavage were examined. Sensitization of animals was achieved by injection and inhalation of ovalbumin (OA). Results: The results showed increased total WBC, eosinophil, neutrophil, and basophil counts, and decreased lymphocytes in lung lavage of sensitized animals compared with the control group (pConclusion: These results indicate important preventive effects of two natural adjuvants, especially G 2, on lung inflammation of sensitized guinea pigs. ...|$|R
40|$|The report {{points out}} the {{importance}} of socio-economic information, and particularly of gender related data as a pre-requisite for obtaining some impact in projects aiming at the integration of women in inland fisheries and aquaculture development. The project's immediate objective was the incorporation of gender issues in inland fisheries and aquaculture development sub-sectoral plans. The SADC region was chosen as a representative target area {{also because of the}} interest demonstrated by fisheries administrations in this matter. Besides, the ALCOM Programme `Aquaculture for Local Community Development' GCP/INT/ 436 /SWE, which is based in the region, provided the necessary logistic and technical guidance. The project prepared draft guidelines for collecting gender specific socio-economic information for development planning and project formulation in the inland fishery and aquaculture sub-sectors. The guidelines were prepared making maximum use {{of the results of the}} national reviews the project carried out in Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, as well as of methodologies used in two socio-economic studies carried out in Zambia and Tanzania in collaboration with ALCOM. The draft guidelines were reviewed at a regional experts' meeting held in January 1993 and widely distributed for comments. Field testing is being done by the ALCOM programme before their finalization. The project identified the need for training of trainers in gender analysis and for development of gender <b>sensitizing</b> training <b>material</b> for extension planners...|$|R
40|$|The {{current status}} of NASA Langley efforts to develop {{solid-state}} lasers {{for use in the}} Lidar Atmospheric Sounder and Altimeter (LASA) of the Space Station Earth Observing System is surveyed. The types of observations to be performed with LASA are listed, and the parameters of presently available lasers are compared with the LASA baseline goals: 2 kW output power; 500 kg weight; tunability to 727, 760, and 943 nm to within 500 fm; high spectral purity; efficiency greater than 3 percent; energy about 1 J/pulse, pulse length less than 100 nsec, and lifetime greater than 108 shots. The use of <b>sensitized</b> flashlamp-pumped laser <b>materials</b> or diode-laser pumping to improve performance is discussed, and particular attention is given to materials research on Ti:sapphire lasers, studies of higher-efficiency detectors, and the LASE and LITE airborne lidar and DIAL experiments...|$|R
40|$|Mononuclear {{cells from}} rabbit joint fluid were studied after {{synovitis}} was induced by various means, including the intra-articular injection of bacterial endotoxin or of aggregated human gamma globulin in normal rabbits, or of HGG in rabbits previously <b>sensitized</b> to this <b>material.</b> The {{large majority of}} mononuclear cells in all groups were monocytoid rather lymphocytoid, and these cells were most readily labeled with tritiated thymidine {{on the first day}} after injection. On day 2 and 3, the numbers of labeled cells decreased, except for the animals previously sensitized with HGG, in which there was an upswing of labeling on day 3. This upswing was associated with a considerable increase in numbers of cells resembing synovial cells, and may possibly be a reflection of synovial proliferation. Macrophages loaded with engulfed polymorphonuclear cells were observed in all experimental groups, a finding which emphasizes the lack of specificity of this reaction. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of studies showing that guinea pigs could develop delayed {{sensitivity}} to allotypic gamma globulin {{it was noted that}} an occasional animal immunized with denatured autologons gamma globulin became <b>sensitized</b> to this <b>material</b> (1). No animals immunized with native autologous gamma globulin developed delayed reactivity to this protein. These observations suggested that if an animal's own gamma globulin were appropriately modified it would become antigenic for that animal. The recent observations of Milgrom and Witebsky are consistent with such a hypothesis (2). These authors showed that rabbits immunized with autologous gamma globulin prepared by ammonium sulfate fractionation developed antibodies which, surprisingly, were present in much higher titer against human gamma globulin than against the rabbit's own material. The authors postulated that in {{the course of}} preparation some of the gamma globulin molecules underwent structural alteration so as to render them antigenic within the same animal...|$|R
40|$|Rationale: Repeated {{exposure}} to psychostimulant drugs causes a long-lasting {{increase in the}} psychomotor and reinforcing effects of these drugs {{and an array of}} neuroadaptations. One such alteration is a hypersensitivity of striatal activity such that a low dose of amphetamine in sensitized animals produces dorsal striatal activation patterns similar to acute treatment with a high dose of amphetamine. Objectives: To extend previous findings of striatal hypersensitivity with behavioral observations and with cellular activity in the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex in <b>sensitized</b> animals. <b>Materials</b> and methods: Rats treated acutely with 0, 1, 2. 5, or 5 mg/kg i. p. amphetamine and sensitized rats challenged with 1 mg/kg i. p. amphetamine were scored for stereotypy, rearing, and grooming, and locomotor activity recorded. c-fos positive nuclei were quantified in the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex after expression of sensitization with 1 mg/kg i. p. amphetamine. Results: Intense stereotypy was seen in animals treated acutely with 5 mg/kg amphetamine, but not in the sensitized group treated with 1 mg/kg amphetamine. The c-fos response to amphetamine in the accumbens core was augmented in amphetamine-pretreated animals with a shift in the distribution of optical density, while no effect of sensitization was seen in the nucleus accumbens shell or prefrontal cortex. Conclusions A lack of stereotypy in the sensitized group indicates a dissociation of behavioral responses to amphetamine and striatal immediate-early gene activation patterns. The increase in c-fos positive nuclei and shift in the distribution of optical density observed in the nucleus accumbens core suggests recruitment of a new population of neurons during expression of sensitization...|$|R
40|$|A {{new concept}} of {{luminescent}} host-guest materials {{was developed by}} introduction of Eu 3 + into COK- 16, a HKUST- 1 type hybrid metal-organic framework (MOF) with cation exchange properties. In Eu@COK- 16, the luminescent ion resides in the pore system of the MOF. The luminescent properties of Eu@COK- 16 have been studied based on excitation and emission, allowing analysis of intramolecular energy-transfer processes from the COK- 16 host to the exchanged Eu 3 + ions. Both, the framework trimesate (BTC) and encapsulated [PW 12 O 40] 3 - ions contribute to energy transfer. Since the antenna molecules (BTC) {{are part of the}} framework structure and [PW 12 O 40] 3 - ions only partly occupy one of the three types of cavities in the structure, a large fraction of the pore volume in this host sensitized luminescent MOF remains available for catalysis applications or adsorption of additional <b>sensitizing</b> molecules. The <b>material</b> structure was determined from a combination of elemental analysis, XAS, XRD, electron and luminescence spectroscopy. status: publishe...|$|R
