5|$|The Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes is an {{area between}} 14–28° <b>southern</b> <b>latitude</b> where {{volcanic}} activity dates to the Eocene. Ignimbritic activity has occurred over the whole area, particularly north of 25° <b>southern</b> <b>latitude</b> where the Altiplano–Puna volcanic complex is situated. Ignimbrites are primarily rhyolite and rhyodacite and subordinate shoshonite. The more southern ignimbrites are felsic and have a low crystal content. With {{the exception of the}} Luingo caldera and Cerro Galán, most volcanism south of 25° <b>southern</b> <b>latitude</b> is of low volume. After a phase of pyroclastic activity in the Antofalla area during the Eocene, a number of volcanoes formed from calc-alkaline magmas during the Miocene. Changes in subduction geometry including the removal of continental crust from the boundary 8-3 mya have caused a thickening of the crust as well as an eastward shift of the volcanic front. Huaynaputina volcano in Peru is part of the Central Volcanic Zone and had a major eruption in 1600.|$|E
5|$|Between 24 and 25° degrees <b>southern</b> <b>latitude</b> the Andean Dry Diagonal {{crosses the}} Andes. At this latitude, {{half of the}} {{precipitation}} falls in summer {{and the other half}} in winter. The formation of this dry diagonal is an effect both of the rainshadow effect of the Andes, air subsidence within South Pacific High, and the cold Humboldt Current off the Pacific coast. This is the reason why the Atacama Desert exists. The extremely arid climate at Llullaillaco is also a consequence of these climatic effects.|$|E
5|$|Incapillo {{is part of}} the Andean Central Volcanic Zone, {{which extends}} through the {{countries}} of Chile, Bolivia, and Argentina and includes six or more Quaternary caldera or ignimbrite systems, about 44 stratovolcanoes, and over 18 smaller centres. One of these stratovolcanoes, Ojos del Salado, is the world's highest volcano. This zone also includes the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex and the Galan caldera farther south. Incapillo is the southernmost volcano of the Central Volcanic Zone with Pleistocene activity; the next such volcano to the south is Tupungato in the Southern Volcanic Zone at 33° <b>southern</b> <b>latitude.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{disturbance}} {{associated with}} the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) left the coast of West Africa on August 9, producing mid-level winds of 75mph (120km/h) in Dakar, Senegal. A weak circulation formed near the sea surface on August10 within an area of thunderstorms. The disturbance moved slowly westward over the Atlantic Ocean, developing into a tropical depression at 18:00 UTC on August12, around the 10th parallel north, an unusually <b>southern</b> <b>latitude</b> the cyclone would remain around throughout its lifetime. On August13, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Alma about 375mi (605km) east of Trinidad and Tobago, as indicated by a Hurricane Hunters flight reporting winds of 65mph (105km/h). This same flight observed a circular eye with a diameter of , the only report of an eye-like structure from this storm.|$|E

25|$|While Centaurus {{now has a}} high <b>southern</b> <b>latitude,</b> at {{the dawn}} of civilization it was an {{equatorial}} constellation. Precession has been slowly shifting it southward for millennia, and it is now close to its maximal southern declination. Thousands of years from now Centaurus will, once again, be at lower latitudes and be visible worldwide.|$|E
40|$|The Antarctic {{topography}} and attendant {{katabatic wind}} regime appear {{to play a}} key role in the climate of the high <b>southern</b> <b>latitudes.</b> During the nonsummer months, persistent and often times intense katabatic winds occur in the lowest few hundred meters of the Antarctic atmosphere. These slope flows transport significant amounts of cold air northward and thereby modify the horizontal pressure field over the high <b>southern</b> <b>latitudes.</b> Three-year seasonal cycle numerical simulations using the NCAR Community Climate Model Version 1 (CCM 1) with and without representation of the Antarctic orography were performed to explore the role of the elevated terrain and drainage flows on the distribution and evolution of the horizontal pressure field. The katabatic wind regime is an important part of a clearly defined mean meridional circulation in the high <b>southern</b> <b>latitudes.</b> The position and intensity of the attendant sea level low pressure belt appears to be tied to the Antarctic orography. The seasonal movement of mass in the high <b>southern</b> <b>latitudes</b> is therefore constrained by the presence of the Antarctic ice sheet. The semiannual oscillation of pressure over Antarctica and the high southern latitutdes is well depicted in the CCM 1 only when the Antarctic orography is included...|$|R

25|$|Captain William Smith in the British {{merchant}} brig Williams, while sailing to Valparaíso, Chile in 1819 {{deviated from}} his route south of Cape Horn, and on 19 February sighted Williams Point, the northeast extremity of Livingston Island. Thus Livingston Island {{became the first}} land ever discovered south of the 60th <b>southern</b> <b>latitude.</b> Smith revisited the South Shetlands, landed on King George Island on 16 October 1819, and claimed possession for Britain.|$|E
25|$|The {{town was}} {{originally}} established at Fairfax, a settlement nestling {{at the foot}} of the hills which lie to the southeast of the town. As communication with the goldfields in the interior became more important, and the desirability of the town becoming a staging post increased, it spread down onto the plains around the river. A Gothic church, Tokomairiro Presbyterian Church, was built at this time by the architect R A Lawson. At the time of its construction, this church was the tallest building at such a <b>southern</b> <b>latitude</b> in the world. The church is still the town's most obvious landmark, and is visible across the Tokomairiro Plains from several kilometres away. It was located at the end of the main road connecting Fairfax with the main route south from Dunedin to the goldfields, and as such is an imposing structure dominating this road.|$|E
500|$|In March1909 it was {{announced}} that Shackleton had reached a <b>southern</b> <b>latitude</b> of 88°23′— [...] from the South Pole—before turning back; thus, as Amundsen observed, in the south [...] "a little corner remained". He was unreserved in his praise for Shackleton's achievement, writing that Shackleton was the south's equivalent of Nansen in the north. Following this near miss, Scott immediately confirmed his intention to lead an expedition (what became the Terra Nova Expedition) that would encompass the [...] "little corner" [...] and claim the prize for the British Empire.|$|E

500|$|According to Drake's Portuguese pilot, Nuno da Silva, their {{position}} at the anchorage was 57°S. However, there is no island at that latitude. The as yet undiscovered Diego Ramírez Islands, at 56°30'S, are treeless and cannot have been the islands where Drake's crew collected wood. This indicates that the navigational calculation was faulty, and that Drake landed {{at or near the}} then unnamed Cape Horn, possibly on Horn Island itself. His final <b>southern</b> <b>latitude</b> can only be speculated as that of Cape Horn, at 55°59'S. In his report, Drake wrote: [...] "The Uttermost Cape or headland of all these islands stands near 56 degrees, without which there is no main island to be seen to the southwards but that the Atlantic Ocean and the South Sea meet." [...] This open sea south of Cape Horn became known as the Drake Passage even though Drake himself did not traverse it.|$|E
500|$|According to the VOC’s Instructions to Tasman in 1644, Janszoon {{discovered}} [...] of {{coast from}} 5 to 13¾ degrees <b>southern</b> <b>latitude,</b> but found [...] "...that vast regions {{were for the}} greater part uncultivated, and certain parts inhabited by savage, cruel black barbarians who slew some of our sailors, so that no information was obtained touching the exact situation {{of the country and}} regarding the commodities obtainable and in demand there...." [...] He found the land to be swampy and infertile, forcing them eventually to give up and return to Bantam due to their lack of [...] "...provisions and other necessaries...." [...] Nevertheless, it appears that the killing of some of his men on various shore expeditions was the main reason for their return—he turned back where his party had its greatest conflict with aboriginals, which he subsequently called Cape Keerweer, Dutch for [...] "Cape Turnagain".|$|E
500|$|According to Morrell, Wasp {{reached the}} South Sandwich Islands on February 28. His {{presence}} there is corroborated by his {{descriptions of the}} harbour on Thule Island, confirmed by the early 20th century expeditions. In {{the next phase of}} the voyage Morrell records that he took Wasp southwards and, the sea being remarkably clear of ice, reached a latitude of 70°14'S before turning north on March 14 as fuel for the ship's stoves was running out. This journey, if Morrell's account is true, made him the first American sea-captain to penetrate the Antarctic Circle. He believed, he says, that but for this deficiency he could have [...] "made a glorious advance directly to the South Pole, or to 85° without the least doubt". Some credence to his claimed <b>southern</b> <b>latitude</b> is provided by James Weddell's voyage on a similar track, a month earlier, which reached 74°15'S before retreating. The words used by Weddell to express his belief that the South Pole lay in open water are replicated by Morrell, whose account was written nine years after the event. Thus it is suggested by geographer Paul Simpson-Housley that Morrell may have plagiarised Weddell's experiences, since Weddell's account had been published in 1827.|$|E

2500|$|Several factors {{combine to}} make the passage around Cape Horn {{one of the most}} {{hazardous}} shipping routes in the world: the fierce sailing conditions prevalent in the Southern Ocean generally; the geography of the passage south of the Horn; and the extreme <b>southern</b> <b>latitude</b> of the Horn, at 56° south.
