5|$|In 1971, Livingstone and {{his comrades}} {{developed}} a new strategy for obtaining political power in Lambeth borough. Focusing on campaigning for the marginal seats {{in the south of}} the borough, the safe Labour seats in the north were left to established party members. Public dissatisfaction with the Conservative government of Prime Minister Edward Heath led to Labour's best local government results since the 1940s; Labour leftists gained every marginal seat in Lambeth, and the borough returned to Labour control. In October 1971, Livingstone's father died of a heart attack; his mother soon moved to Lincoln. That year, Labour members voted Livingstone Vice-Chairman of the Housing Committee on the Lambeth London Borough Council, his first job in local government. Reforming the housing system, Livingstone and Committee Chairman Ewan Carr cancelled the proposed rent increase for council housing, temporarily halting the construction of Europe's largest tower blocks, and founded a Family <b>Squatting</b> Group to ensure that homeless families would be immediately rehoused through <b>squatting</b> in empty houses. He increased the number of compulsory purchase orders for private-rented properties, converting them to council housing. They faced opposition to their reforms, which were cancelled by central government.|$|E

Ten male athletes performed <b>squats</b> at three different speeds. Variables such as net torque and power about the joint were calculated during the descending and ascending phase of each <b>squat.</b> At the same time, surface electrodes were placed over the eight lower extremity muscles,. and %iEMG was also measured during the ascending phase of each <b>squat.</b> During the descending phase, the activity of elector spinae (ES), Gluteus maximus (Gmax), Gluteus medius (Gmed), Rectus femoris (RF), Biceps femoris (BF), Adductor longus (AL), and Vastus lateralis (VL) muscles was significantly greater for Quick <b>squats</b> than Normal and Slow <b>squats,</b> whereas during the ascending phase, activity was significantly greater for Quick and Normal <b>squats</b> than for Slow <b>squats.</b> Mean torque around the hip joint increased significantly when switching from Slow to Quick <b>squats</b> in the descending phase; and during the ascending phase, mean torque was significantly greater for Quick and Normal <b>squats</b> than for Slow <b>squats.</b> The median frequency (MDF) of an electromyogram of the Gmax was significantly lower for Normal <b>squats</b> than for Quick squats; and in the ascending phase, the MDF of the BF was significantly lower for Normal <b>squats</b> than for Quick and Slow <b>squats.</b> Quick <b>squats</b> use the stretch-shortening cycle so that the load around the Gmax may increase. Although mean muscle activity for Slow <b>squats</b> was smaller than for Nomal <b>squats,</b> MDF was greater.

5|$|A {{rehabilitation}} program often involves {{protection of the}} compromised articular surface and underlying subchondral bone combined with maintenance of strength and range of motion. Post-operative analgesics, namely a mix of opioids and NSAIDs, are usually required to control pain, inflammation and swelling. Straight leg raising and other isometric exercises are encouraged during the post-operative or immobilization period. A six to eight-week home or formal physical therapy program is usually instituted once the immobilization period has ended, incorporating range of motion, stretching, progressive strengthening, and functional or sport-specific training. During this time, patients are advised to avoid running and jumping, but are permitted to perform low impact activities, such as walking or swimming. If patients return to activity before the cartilage has become firm, they will typically complain of pain during maneuvers such as <b>squatting</b> or jumping.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} a {{new method}} for detection of short track irregularities, particularly <b>squats,</b> with axle box acceleration (ABA) measurements. A <b>squat</b> is a surface initiated short track defect, associated with high frequency vibrations of the wheel-rail system. High stresses in the contact patch at <b>squats</b> cause accumulation of plastic deformation of the rail and growth of cracks. Cracks growing in the subsurface can cause a rail fracture. Light <b>squats</b> can be treated by grinding of the rail surface; while mature <b>squats</b> lead to replacement of the rail section. For cost effective maintenance policy and operational safety <b>squats</b> should be detected at an early stage. Detection of light <b>squats</b> is the main aim of this study. Till now, ultrasonic measurements have been mainly used for detection of <b>squats.</b> By that method the depth of cracks is measured; hence, it is applicable only to detection of severe <b>squats</b> with sufficiently large cracks. In the present work, ABA measurements were employed. The advantages associated with this method are that ABA measurements can be performed on standard operating vehicles travelling with usual traffic speeds and <b>squats</b> can be detected at their early stage. The first goal {{of this study was}} to find a relationship between <b>squats</b> and ABA characteristics, such as magnitude and frequency content, and apply them for detection of <b>squats.</b> To this end, a three-dimensional finite element (FE) model was applied for dynamic simulations of the wheel-track interaction in the high frequency range. By parameter variation, the influence of the geometry of <b>squats,</b> speed of the train and location of the <b>squats</b> relative to the sleepers on ABA characteristics was studied. Local frequency characteristics of ABA at <b>squats</b> were obtained and their relation with the severity of <b>squats</b> was established. These frequency characteristics can be applied for detection of <b>squats</b> and their assessment. The second goal was to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of ABA measurements to enable detection of light <b>squats.</b> Several methods to improve signal-to-noise ratio of ABA measurements were suggested. These included noise reduction techniques, reduction of disturbances from the wheel defects and signal enhancement by improvement of the measuring system by using longitudinal ABA. Owing to the improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio, the hit rate of moderate <b>squats</b> increased from 60 % to 100 % and the hit rate of light <b>squats</b> together with trivial defects (small rail surface defects which are so small that they will be worn away) increased from 57 % to 85 %. Since light <b>squats</b> are larger than trivial defects and, therefore, easier to detect, the hit rate of light <b>squats,</b> which depends on the threshold that separates light <b>squats</b> from trivial defects, is higher. The third goal was to develop an algorithm for automatic detection of <b>squats,</b> which enables continuous analysis of track. The initial results indicated that 78 % of light <b>squats</b> and trivial defects can be detected automatically by ABA. The hit rate of severe <b>squats</b> was 100 %. The presented ABA method enables automatic detection of <b>squats</b> at their earliest stage, when preventive and early corrective actions can be taken. The employment of such method can significantly reduce life cycle costs of a track infected by <b>squats.</b> Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

5|$|European {{exploration}} of the future site of Wagga Wagga began in 1829 {{with the arrival of}} Captain Charles Sturt during his expedition along the Murrumbidgee River. Settlers arrived shortly thereafter with Charles Tompson establishing the Eunonyhareenyha 'run' on the north bank of the river in 1832, and then in soon after George Best establishing the Wagga Wagga 'run' on the south bank. Other settlers followed, with all of them initially <b>squatting</b> on the land illegally but by 1836 the colonial government regulated the tenure of land and established a licensing scheme. Within a few years settlers numbers increased greatly and before 1850 a local bench of magistrates and a place for holding petty sessions was established. The beginnings of a village formed near the ford used by most traffic passing through the area and included a crude blacksmith's shop, a hotel, and a post office. By 1849 the town was marked out by surveyor Thomas Scott Townsend and formally gazetted as a village.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the known}} Ankylosaurus {{specimens}} were not scientifically described at length, though several paleontologists planned to do so, until Carpenter redescribed the genus in 2004. Carpenter noted that Ankylosaurus has become the archetypal member of its group, and the best known ankylosaur in popular culture, perhaps due to a life-sized reconstruction of the animal being featured at the 1964 World's Fair in New York City. Many traditional popular depictions show Ankylosaurus in a <b>squatting</b> posture and with a huge tail club being dragged over the ground. Modern reconstructions show the animal with a more upright limb posture and with the tail held off the ground. Likewise, large spines projecting sideways from the body (similar to those of nodosaurs) are present in many traditional depictions, but are not known from Ankylosaurus itself.|$|E

40|$|Background A primary {{technique}} {{in the discipline}} of strength and conditioning the <b>squat</b> has two principal ‘back and front’ variants. Despite the physiological and strength benefits of the <b>squat,</b> the propensity for musculoskeletal injury is high. The current investigation examined {{the influence of the}} front and back <b>squat</b> variations on the load experienced by the Achilles tendon. Material/Methods Achilles tendon loads were obtained from eighteen experienced male participants as they completed both back and front <b>squats.</b> Differences between <b>squat</b> conditions were examined using Bonferroni adjusted (p = 0. 0125) paired t-tests. Results The results showed that the peak Achilles tendon load was significantly greater in the back <b>squat</b> (2. 67 ± 0. 74 B. W) condition compared to the front <b>squat</b> (2. 37 ± 0. 69 B. W). Conclusions Given the proposed relationship between the magnitude of the load experienced by the Achilles tendon and tendon pathology, the back <b>squat</b> appears to place lifters at greater risk from Achilles tendon injury. Therefore, it may be prudent for lifters who are predisposed to Achilles tendon pathology to utilize the front <b>squat</b> in their training.
