5|$|Ms. Mililani Minerva Mudd, Millie's mother, is a lawyer, who is as an older, wiser, more {{temperate}} {{version of}} Millie. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> Millie in her childhood, {{and as a}} result knows how to deal with any trouble caused by her, much to Millie's annoyance. While Ms. Mudd knows how to deal with Millie, she is also the first to lend her support if there is anything amiss. She married Llewellyn {{at the end of the}} strip's run in a storyarc from November–December 2008. Her full name was revealed on October 1, 2008.|$|E
5|$|When I got {{the call}} , I was like, 'I don't know if that's me. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> 'Nah, it's gonna be your type of beat.' I'm like, 'Oh, for real?' Then when Hov called he said, 'I'm gonna do it with you.' I was like, 'Dag, this is big.' But when I did it, I kept it me and kept it 'hood. At first I ain't think she was gonna like it but she called and said she loved it. From there it was a wrap. That's history. Mariah is known for doing remixes with street cats from Mobb Deep to O.D.B., so {{to be a part}} of that was a good look for me and the Def Jam movement.|$|E
5|$|Robin (Cobie Smulders) {{suggests}} Ted {{give up on}} Stella {{and instead}} focus on Abby. Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) agrees, as he made an appointment with Stella to check what <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> and discovered she had a condition where she is only attracted to men with mustaches. Although Ted does not believe him, he still tries to grow a mustache, which Stella laughs at (a year earlier, Barney had made a ten-dollar bet with Ted {{that he could get}} him to grow a mustache). Upset, Ted says he gives up, but Lily (Alyson Hannigan) tells him to try again, as Stella is interested in him, though she says she has not been to see her. It is then revealed that Marshall (Jason Segel) had gone to see Stella to talk up Ted, and found out Stella had a crush on him. The book ended up belonging to Marshall. Happy that Stella is interested in him, Ted asks her out after his last session, but she says she does not have time for dating because she has a daughter.|$|E

One of the first generation of opera singers to appear widely in recordings and on the radio, her performances, now reappearing on both compact disc and video, have provided a lasting testament to her ability. From these recordings, future generations will be able to form some impression of what <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> as a singer and to understand what made her unique as an artist.|$|E

25|$|The University was {{the site}} of social {{upheaval}} during the 1960s and 1970s, when nationalist students protested for civil rights, the independence of Puerto Rico, and taking the ROTC out of the campus. In 1970 Antonia Martínez was murdered by the police when they repressed students. As the shouting started in the street, everyone in the building she was in, on Ponce de León Avenue, went to the balconies to see what was happening. <b>She</b> <b>was,</b> <b>like</b> many others, watching the events, saw policemen attacking at the students, and allegedly shouted at the police ¡Asesinos! (Assassins!). A policeman turned and shot her in the head, killing her and injuring a roommate. A mural of her and her story existed on the College of Humanities, until administrative personnel covered it with paint. Other stories claim that she was shot by mistake.|$|E
500|$|She [...] {{gave me a}} call, and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> [...] "I {{would love}} to do a duet with you. Come by the studio." [...] When I got there, she played the song for me. I didn't expect to record the song, but when I heard it, I said, [...] "Man, there's no way I'm going to leave this studio without my voice being on that record." [...] Everything just {{happened}} so fast. I didn't expect for it to be a single or a video. Everything was just great.|$|E

And {{literally}} we came out the door and it was like just hundreds of people sort of coming around us. People everywhere, cameras, people yelling her name. It was incredible, I have never experienced anything like that. It was really reportage, loose, not planned, we went with feeling, we went with instinct... It's a beautiful cycle of energy." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{significant}} [...] in {{the development}} of hip-hop was the addition of eight-counts, a method of counting dance steps to stay in sync with the music. Toni Basil introduced this studio technique into locking in the 1970s. Basil was trained in ballet before being introduced to street dance by Don Campbell, the creator of locking and founding member of The Lockers dance crew. She is responsible for teaching the rest of The Lockers how to dance to counts. In an interview with NPR, Lockers member Adolfo [...] "Shabba-Doo" [...] Quiñones stated [...] "I would say that Toni Basil was sort of our Abe Saperstein in terms of how she was able to organize us into a professional dance troupe. I remember her teaching us how to count music. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> okay, we were like, count music? How do you count soul? It was crazy, you know?... all of our cues kind of went something like this, boom, pop, do boom, pada da boom, pada like that. And <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> how do you guys get in sync like that? I said it's a feeling, you know?" [...] Traditionally hip-hop dance, or any form of street dance, is not performed to counts as these styles were created on the street rather than in a studio setting. So the introduction of counts was a pivotal move into bringing hip-hop dance from the street into the studio. Even with this addition, it would be years before commercial hip-hop developed into its current form.|$|E
500|$|After Carey {{finished}} {{writing and}} producing the track alongside Williams, Dogg added his rap verse, and added some ulterior beats and components. Before taking the still-uncompleted song to the studio, Dogg described {{the song and}} beat [...] "The beat was just sick and it was bangin'. I was like, 'All right, give me that, M.C.' I took [...] down to my studio and flipped my style to it." [...] After slightly altering the song, as well as adding his verses, Dogg met with Carey once again for her approval on the song, [...] "When I played [...] for her, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> 'Oh, I love it!' I said, 'OK, give me a hug, baby.' She was just as soft as a cotton swab! Lord have mercy! Jesus, M.C.! What I wouldn't ... Let me stop." ...|$|E
500|$|Perry has a contralto vocal range. Her singing has {{received}} both praise and criticism. Betty Clarke of The Guardian commented that her [...] "powerful voice is hard-edged" [...] while Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone described Perry's vocals on Teenage Dream as [...] "processed staccato blips". Darren Harvey of musicOMH compared Perry's vocals on One of the Boys to Alanis Morissette's, both possessing a [...] "perky voice shifting octaves mid-syllable". Alex Miller from NME felt that [...] "Perry's problem is often her voice" [...] on One of the Boys, stating that [...] "somewhere {{along the line}} someone convinced her <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> well, a ballsy rock chick". Conversely, Bernadette McNulty from The Daily Telegraph praised her [...] "rock chick voice" [...] {{in a review of}} a concert promoting Prism.|$|E

500|$|When Dixon first {{emerged into}} the public {{spotlight}} with Mis-Teeq, she was primarily the group's MC, whilst one of her band-mates Sabrina Washington usually sang lead vocals on the records. Washington encouraged her to rap from the band's inception, saying: [...] "When she started she was a bit shy, but I always said that it adds something, an element of difference. It {{was the first time}} I'd ever heard a woman MC and I was like, 'Alesha, you have got to do that,' and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> 'No Bri, don't make me look stupid'". However, when she began her solo career her first UK album, The Alesha Show, saw Dixon undergo a genre-shift. The album featured no rapping and was primarily R and soul, unlike Mis-Teeq's music, which focused mainly on garage and hip hop. Dixon commented that the record consisted of [...] "a lot more guitar-written songs with pop produced around it". Dixons third album The Entertainer consists mainly of uptempo pop and dance-pop tracks.|$|E
500|$|However, {{before the}} filming of the video, the band was still {{finishing}} the album and when the time to shoot the video came, Lee didn't conceive an idea about how it should look like. As she felt the song was different for the band, Lee knew that they didn't want to [...] "go the classic, sort of fantastic, epic [...]" [...] Lee asked her sister Carrie to help her around {{the concept of the}} video. Her sister said that they should film the video for the song in New York and Lee agreed with her idea, [...] "She just started saying things that were right on. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> 'This should be in New York. You guys need to do something different, this song feels different.' And she started talking about running across the Brooklyn Bridge, and it being where I live, and I was like, 'Oh my God, this is great.'" [...] However, the final shot of the video filmed at Coney Island was Lee's own idea. The shot represented the band coming back in the world and [...] "heading into the unknown, coming into a new world".|$|E
500|$|In 1961, Holt married bank manager Gilbert LaPiere, who adopted Cher (under {{the name}} Cheryl LaPiere) and Georganne, and {{enrolled}} them at Montclair College Preparatory School, {{a private school}} in Encino, whose students were mostly from affluent families. The school's upper-class environment presented a challenge for Cher; biographer Connie Berman wrote, [...] " [...] stood out from the others in both her striking appearance and outgoing personality." [...] A former classmate commented, [...] "I'll never forget seeing Cher for the first time. She was so special... <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> a movie star, right then and there... She {{said she was going}} to be a movie star and we knew she would." [...] Despite not being an excellent student, Cher was intelligent and creative, according to Berman. She earned high grades, excelling in French and English classes. As an adult, she discovered that she had dyslexia. Cher achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior: she performed songs for students during the lunch hours and surprised peers when she wore a midriff-baring top. She later recalled, [...] "I was never really in school. I was always thinking about when I was grown up and famous." ...|$|E

500|$|British-Tamil {{recording}} artist M.I.A. {{was one of}} the songwriters of [...] "Elastic Love". According to her, [...] "Elastic Love" [...] was the first track that she recorded, even before she started working on her debut album. She added, [...] "It's the one I made in-between taking time out and having a baby and starting mine". When was asked about why she agreed to work with Aguilera, M.I.A. revealed, [...] "Other people were involved who I respect like Peaches and it was like a sea of women coming together to write this new thing. Christina had also had a baby, you know, so it was kind of an interesting situation". Aguilera's decision not to perform her [...] "trademark warbling" [...] while recording the song disappointed M.I.A., as she detailed in an interview with MTV News UK:I really thought I {{was going to be able}} to go in there and get her vocals on to the next level and she didn't want to do it. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> 'You might think that's great because it's not what you do, but to me I'm really bored of it'. It's interesting getting to work with people who can do things vocally that you can't... but yeah I only heard the song for the first time when everyone else did.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Blow" [...] was {{directed}} by Chris Marrs Piliero. The video was released on February 25, 2011. Kesha wanted the video to be [...] "different, a video that was cool and random". The director, Piliero, {{came up with the}} idea for the video's mythological aspect saying, [...] "I had this idea running in my head with just the idea of unicorns, If I massacred unicorns, they could bleed rainbows. I'm a fan of violence and I'm always trying to find a way to make it OK." [...] While being interviewed Piliero spoke of the collaboration with Kesha, explaining her point of view on the video, [...] "Before we started filming, we had quite a few talks. She was adamant you can't back away from the crazy; everything about the idea she loved and she enforced the fact that she wanted to embrace every aspect of it and really go for it, On set, she was having fun. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> 'I want to lick a unicorn.' It was rad working with her because there definitely wasn't a sense of her feeling awkward about stuff or detached; no ego. It felt like we had worked together before." ...|$|E
