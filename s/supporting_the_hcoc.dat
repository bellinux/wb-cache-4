30|$|Bittencourt and Madeira [15] propose <b>HCOC,</b> <b>the</b> Hybrid Cloud Optimized Cost, a {{scheduling}} algorithm that selects {{the resources}} to be leased from a public cloud to complement the resources from a private cloud. <b>The</b> objective of <b>HCOC</b> is to reduce makespan to fit a desired execution time or deadline while maintaining a reasonable cost. This cost constraint is introduced to {{limit the amount of}} resources leased from the public cloud, otherwise the public cloud would always be overutilized to address the time constraints. Intra-node communication is considered to be limitless, {{in the sense that the}} costs of local communication are ignored. Communication cost is calculated by dividing the amount of data by the link bandwidth, which is modeled as a constant value. Computation cost is based on the number of instructions and the processing capacity of a node, which is measured as instructions per time. There are several implicit assumptions in this model, such as fixed capacity for transferring and computing. There is not a function that varies the amount of computation based on the size of the input.|$|R
