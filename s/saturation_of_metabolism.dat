40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of time-related reduction in lidocaine clearance were studied using a “one-pass ” perfused rat liver system. Lidocaine was infused continuously {{for a period}} up to 150 mm (concentration ranged from 9. 6 to 278 SM). The time required forlidocaine to achieve steady state in the effluent ranged from 20 to 90 mm. Analysis of material balance suggested that capacity-limited tissue binding was partially responsible for determining the time to steady state. The characteristic rise of monoethylalycinexylidide to a maximum within 5 mm and decline to a stable level during constant lidocaine infusion suggested that the deethylation pathway may be partly deactivated. This observation could be the major determinant for the time-de-pendent effects of lidocaine elimination. <b>Saturation</b> <b>of</b> <b>metabolism,</b> mainly hydroxylation, and product inhibition by monoethyiglycinex-ylidide did not reduce the extraction of lidocaine significantly.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a physiologically based toxicokinetic model for 1, 3 -butadiene uptake, distribution, and metabolic clearance in mice. Model parameters for metabolic activity were estimated from the correspondence between computer simulation studies and experimental results as {{published in the}} literature.

With the resulting model, {{the relative importance of}} lung metabolism as compared to metabolism in the liver increased with decreasing ambient air concentrations.

40|$|New {{chemical}} entities often exhibit nonlinear pharmacokinetics (PK) {{profiles in}} experimental animals. However, {{the number of}} studies that have focused on species differences in nonlinear PK is very limited; thus, {{the aim of this}} study was to clarify the mechanism of the nonlinear PK of E 2074 (2 -[(2 R) - 2 -fluoro- 3 -{(3 r) -[(3 -fluorobenzyl) oxy]- 8 -azabicyclo[3. 2. 1]oct- 8 -yl}propyl]- 4, 5 -dimethyl- 2, 4 -dihydro- 3 H- 1, 2, 4 -triazol- 3 -one), a novel sodium channel inhibitor, in rats, dogs, and monkeys. Nonlinear PK profiles with more than dose-proportional increases of Cmax and area under the plasma concentration curve were observed in all species after oral ad-ministration. The Michaelis–Menten constant (Km) values <b>of</b> hepatic microsomal <b>metabolism</b> were 7. 23 and 0. 41 mM in rats and dogs in vitro, respectively, which were lower than the unbound maximum plasma concentrations after oral administration in vivo, indicating that the nonlinear PK in rats and dogs was attributable to the <b>saturation</b> <b>of</b> hepatic <b>metabolism.</b> However, we do not believe that the <b>saturation</b> <b>of</b> hepatic <b>metabolism</b> was the mechanism of nonlinearity in monkeys because of the high Km value (42. 44 mM) observed in liver microsomes.

40|$|Studies on {{inhalation}} pharmacokinetics of isoprene {{were conducted}} in rats (Wistar) and mice (B 6 C 3 F 1) to investigate possible species differences in <b>metabolism</b> <b>of</b> this compound. Pharmacokinetic analysis of isoprene inhaled by rats and mice revealed <b>saturation</b> kinetics <b>of</b> isoprene <b>metabolism</b> in both species.

In the lower concentration range where first-order metabolism applies, metabolic clearance (related to the concentration in the atmosphere) of inhaled isoprene per kilogram body weight was 6200 mL/hr for rats and 12, 000 mL/hr for mice. The estimated maximal metabolic elimination rates were 130 mumole/hr/kg for rats and 400 mumole/hr/kg for mice.

When the untreated animals are kept in a closed all-glass exposure system, the exhalation of isoprene into the system can be measured.

From such experiments the endogenous production rate of isoprene was calculated to be 1. 9 mumole/hr/kg for rats and 0. 4 mumole/hr/kg for mice.

The patient was treated with a therapeutic dose of VRZ but developed a neurotoxicity leading to hallucinations and coma while the plasma concentration of VRZ reached an exceptional level (20. 0 µg/mL on day 10 of the treatment). Since neurological disorders diminished in parallel with the decrease of VRZ plasma concentrations, the coma was likely due to VRZ. The VRZ half-life, calculated to 58 h in this patient, was by far higher than the values reported in the literature. While VRZ concentrations slowly decreased, the N-oxide voriconazole concentrations slowly increased from day 15. Hypotheses for this lack of metabolization of VRZ are an inhibition <b>of</b> the <b>metabolism</b> by esomeprazole, a <b>saturation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>metabolism</b> or an enzymatic auto-inhibition <b>of</b> VRZ <b>metabolism</b> but none <b>of</b> these hypotheses have yet been explored.

Concentrations of unchanged ticlopidine in plasma were measured by g. l. c. After a single 250 mg dose of ticlopidine, the mean area under the curve, AUC (0 - 12 h) was 1. 11 micrograms ml- 1 h in young subjects and 2. 04 micrograms ml- 1 h in old subjects (P = 0. 002). Mean values of t 1 / 2,z in young and elderly subjects were 7. 9 h and 12. 6 h, respectively (P = 0. 01).

40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarEight {{groups of}} six male RIV:tox rats {{received}} oral and intravenous doses of benzo(a) pyrene (BaP) {{in a parallel}} study plan. Intravenously and orally four dose levels were administered. BaF was dissolved in soybean oil for oral administration, and in glycofurol for intravenous administration. The doses were such, that the absolute oral bioavailability could be calculated for two dose levels. The plasma pharmacokinetics of BaP after intravenous administration were described by a two-compartment model. The corresponding kinetic parameters were calculated. The elimination half-life of BaP was approx. 30 - 60 min. in the period 0 - 12 h after administration. Therefore, unchanged BaP will not accumulate after repeated administration, when it is administered once daily. The AUC values (area under the plasma concentration-time curve) increased more than proportionally with the oral or intravenous dose. The deviation from linearity was small for the doses used in this study. After oral administration multiple plasma concentration maxima were observed, which {{may be explained by}} an interaction of the oil solution with the bile. The absolute oral bioavailability of unchanged BaP was approx. 13 % for a dose of 1 mg/kg and approx. 4 % for a dose of 5 mg/kg. This does not mean, that the absorption of BaP decreased with increasing doses, because the non-linear increase of the AUC values with the dose may be explained by <b>saturation</b> <b>of</b> <b>metabolism.</b> The kinetic parameters and the oral bioavailability were in the same range as found in the literature for other rat species...|$|E

It {{has been shown}} beyond doubt that a {{fraction}} of inhaled ethene is metabolized in mammals (including humans) via ethylene oxide, an electrophilic reagent that {{has been shown to}} be mutagenic and carcinogenic. To the extent that the linearity hypothesis for dose-response relationships at low levels is accepted, exposure to ethene is therefore expected to lead to a risk increment. In order to judge whether ethene as a single compound should be considered a risk factor, it has to be evaluated whether this risk increment is negligibly small or of concern to individuals or societies.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In humans gut wall {{metabolism}} can be quantitatively {{as important}} as hepatic drug metabolism in limiting the systemic exposure to drugs after oral administration. However, it has been proposed that the role <b>of</b> gut wall <b>metabolism</b> might be overemphasized, because high luminal drug concentrations {{would lead to a}} <b>saturation</b> <b>of</b> gut wall <b>metabolism.</b> Therefore we investigated the impact of concentration and rate of intraluminal drug delivery on absorption (Fabs) and gastrointestinal extraction (EGI) of a luminally administered cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 3 A 4 substrate (verapamil) using a multilumen perfusion catheter in combination with a stable isotope technique. METHODS: Two 20 -cm-long, adjacent jejunal segments were isolated with the multilumen perfusion catheter in 7 subjects. In this study 80 mg of unlabeled verapamil (d 0 -verapamil 15 min) was infused into one segment over a 15 -minute period, 80 mg of 3 -fold deuterated verapamil (d 3 -verapamil 240 min) was administered over a 240 -minute period into the other segment, and simultaneously, 5 mg of 7 -fold deuterated verapamil (d 7 -verapamil) was injected intravenously over a 15 -minute period. RESULTS: The rate of intraluminal drug delivery had only a modest effect on bioavailability of the verapamil isotopes (after correction for Fabs) (F/Fabsd 3 -verapamil 240 min versus d 0 -verapamil 15 min, 0. 24 0. 10 versus 0. 20 0. 09; P <. 05). Accordingly, the EGI value for d 3 -verapamil 240 min was 0. 50 0. 18 compared with 0. 59 0. 14 for d 0 -verapamil 15 min (P <. 05). In vivo, EGI(d 0 -verapamil 15 min) correlated strongly with EGI(d 3 -verapamil 240 min) (r = 0. 94, P <. 005). Moreover, intrinsic clearance of CYP 3 A 4 -mediated verapamil <b>metabolism</b> in homogenates <b>of</b> simultaneously collected shed enterocytes correlated with in vivo EGI of d 0 -verapamil 15 min/d 3 -verapamil 240 min (r = 0. 62, P =. 03).

40|$|Confidence in the {{extrapolation}} of animal toxicity data to humans {{can be enhanced}} by the application of pharmacokinetic concepts integrated with chronic toxicity data and knowledge of a chemical's mechanism(s) of toxicity. Basic pharmacokinetic concepts (including dose-dependent or Michaelis-Menten kinetics) {{and their relationship to}} the risk estimation process are discussed using vinyl chloride and styrene as specific examples. Species differences in metabolic rates must be considered in order to arrive at realistic estimates of human risk to vinyl chloride-induced liver angiosarcomas utilizing vinyl chloride toxicity data observed in rats. Because small animal species generally metabolize chemicals more rapidly than larger species on a body surface area basis, small animals should be more sensitive to chemicals (such as vinyl chloride) that exert their toxicities via the metabolic formation of toxic products. Inhaled styrene is a chemical whose clearance from the blood at low exposure levels in both rats and humans follows first-order kinetics. However, at higher exposure levels, the pharmacokinetic fate of styrene in rats is dose-dependent, suggesting a <b>saturation</b> <b>of</b> styrene <b>metabolism.</b> These data indicate that any {{extrapolation of}} observable toxicity at elevated exposure levels in rats to anticipated responses at lower levels in either rats or humans may be invalid.

40|$|The anticancer drug {{paclitaxel}} is formulated for i. v. {{administration in}} a mixture of Cremophor EL and ethanol. Its oral bioavailability is very low due to the action of P-glycoprotein in the gut wall and CYP 450 in gut wall and liver. However, proof-of-concept studies using the i. v. formulation diluted in drinking water have demonstrated the feasibility of the oral route as an alternative when given in combination with inhibitors of P-glycoprotein and CYP 450. Because of the unacceptable pharmaceutical properties of the drinking solution, a better formulation for oral application is needed. We have evaluated the suitability of various self-micro emulsifying oily formulations (SMEOF’s) of paclitaxel for oral application using wild-type and P-glycoprotein knockout mice and cyclosporin A (CsA) as P-glycoprotein and CYP 450 inhibitor. The oral bioavailability of paclitaxel in all SMEOF’s without concomitant CsA was low in wild-type mice, showing that this vehicle does not enhance intestinal uptake by itself. Paclitaxel (10  mg/kg) in SMEOF# 3 given with CsA resulted in plasma levels that were comparable to the Cremophor EL-ethanol containing drinking solution plus CsA. Whereas the AUC increased linearly with the oral paclitaxel dose in P-glycoprotein knockout mice, it increased less than proportional in wild-type mice given with CsA. In both strains more unchanged paclitaxel was recovered in the feces at higher doses. This observation most likely reflects more profound precipitation of paclitaxel within the gastro-intestinal tract at higher doses. The resulting absolute reduction in absorption of paclitaxel from the gut was possibly concealed by partial <b>saturation</b> <b>of</b> first-pass <b>metabolism</b> when P-glycoprotein was absent. In conclusion, SMEOF’s maybe a useful vehicle for oral delivery of paclitaxel in combination with CsA, although the physical stability within the gastro-intestinal tract remains a critical issue, especially when applied at higher dose levels...|$|R

In study A, 1, 000 mg mesalazine doses were given thrice daily for 5 days, and urine and blood samples were drawn during the last dosing interval. In study B, a 1, 000 mg single dose was given, and samples were taken for 48 h postdose. Pharmacokinetics of mesalazine and N-acetylmesalazine (LC-MS/MS) were calculated by noncompartmental methods.

40|$|A multicompartment biologically based {{dynamic model}} was {{developed}} to describe the time evolution of methanol and its metabolites in the whole body and in accessible biological matrices of rats, monkeys, and humans following different exposure scenarios. The dynamic of intercompartment exchanges was described mathematically by a mass balance differential equation system. The model's conceptual and functional representation was the same for rats, monkeys, and humans, but relevant published data specific to the species of interest served to determine the critical parameters of the kinetics. Simulations provided a close approximation to kinetic data available in the published literature. The average pulmonary absorption fraction of methanol {{was estimated to be}} 0. 60 in rats, 0. 69 in monkeys, and 0. 58 - 0. 82 in human volunteers. The corresponding average elimination half-life of absorbed methanol through metabolism to formaldehyde was estimated to be 1. 3, 0. 7 - 3. 2, and 1. 7 h. <b>Saturation</b> <b>of</b> methanol <b>metabolism</b> appeared to occur at a lower exposure in rats than in monkeys and humans. Also, the main species difference in the kinetics was attributed to a <b>metabolism</b> rate constant <b>of</b> whole body formaldehyde to formate estimated to be twice as high in rats as in monkeys. Inversely, in monkeys and in humans, a larger fraction of body burden of formaldehyde is rapidly transferred to a long-term component. The latter represents the formaldehyde that (directly or after oxidation to formate) binds to various endogenous molecules or is taken up by the tetrahydrofolic-acid-dependent one-carbon pathway to become the building block of synthetic pathways. This model can be used to quantitatively relate methanol or its metabolites in biological matrices to the absorbed dose and tissue burden at any point in time in rats, monkeys, and humans for different exposures, thus reducing uncertainties in the dose-response relationship, and animal-to-human and exposure scenario comparisons. The model, adapted to kinetic data in human volunteers exposed acutely to methanol vapors, predicts that 8 -h inhalation exposures ranging from 500 to 2000 ppm, without physical activities, are needed to increase concentrations of blood formate and urinary formic acid above mean background values reported by various authors (4. 9 - 10. 3 and 6. 3 - 13 mg/liter, respectively). This leaves blood and urinary methanol concentrations as the most sensitive biomarkers of absorbed methano...|$|R

The YL band intensity increases linearly with excitation power density and partially saturates above some critical value. The dependence is quantitatively described within a phenomenological model accounting for recombination statistics in GaN layer and <b>saturation</b> <b>of</b> acceptors with photogenerated holes. The incomplete <b>saturation</b> <b>of</b> the YL intensity at high excitation intensities is explained by gradual <b>saturation</b> <b>of</b> acceptors at different distances from the sample surface.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of my work}} was {{to find out how}} the client´ s disorientation changes the attitude of the nurse regarding the <b>saturation</b> <b>of</b> his needs. Another objective was {{to find out if the}} nurses are provided with enough information in the field <b>of</b> the <b>saturation</b> <b>of</b> needs of the disoriented client. I have made two hypotheses. Nursing care of a disoriented client makes higher demands on nurses (H 1) and nurses do not have enough information in the field <b>of</b> <b>saturation</b> <b>of</b> needs of the disoriented client (H 2). Based on the results H 1 was confirmed, while H 2 was not. The results show that the disorientation makes higher demands on nurses in the field <b>of</b> <b>saturation</b> <b>of</b> the disoriented client´ s needs in all respects while the communication with such clients did not prove difficult for nurses. The results further show that nurses are sufficiently familiar with this issue but the observations showed that some nurses do not satisfy these needs.
