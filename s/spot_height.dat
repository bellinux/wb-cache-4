5|$|Sydenham Hill {{is one of}} {{the highest}} {{locations}} in London; 109metres (357ft) above sea level (<b>spot</b> <b>height</b> on Ordnance Survey Map); {{and the size of the}} Palace and prominence of the site made it easy to identify from much of London. This led to the residential area around the building becoming known as Crystal Palace instead of Sydenham Hill. The Palace was destroyed by fire on 30 November 1936 and the site of the building and its grounds is now known as Crystal Palace Park.|$|E

Since 1960, much of Bradley Wood has been cut down with the remainder being transferred into the Home Farm Woodland Trust park, in Bentworth. Woods in the area include Preston Oak Hills, Brick Kiln Copse, Down Wood, Bradley Wood, and the Coombe Plantation. The parish contains no hamlets, {{and much of it}} borders Bentworth.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to design {{automatic}} detection of <b>spot</b> <b>heights</b> from airborne laser scanning data and its generalization. The first part is {{about the idea of}} spot height: the importance of <b>spot</b> <b>heights</b> for altimetry representation on maps and suggestions concerning the scatter of <b>spot</b> <b>heights</b> on maps. In the following part, different approaches for terrain critical points extraction (peaks, depressions, passes) from digital terrain models are described as suitable places for <b>spot</b> <b>heights</b> location. Further, we introduce a description of geomorphological characteristics of these points by which is possible to identify its significance and generalize them. In accordance to analysis of Základní mapa ČR and recommendation for <b>spot</b> <b>heights</b> location described in literature we designed own method of automatic generation and generalization <b>spot</b> <b>heights</b> from digital terrain models. This method were implemented and there is a description of the test data and results on the real data DMR 5 G of the algorithm in the end of the work. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|R

2500|$|The {{summit of}} Cruach Ardrain has two high points of similar same height, roughly 250 metres apart. [...] Current Ordnance survey maps give a <b>spot</b> <b>height</b> of 1046m {{for the north}} east top but no height for the south west top. [...] Older {{imperial}} maps show a 3428ft <b>spot</b> <b>height</b> (1045m) for the SW top but no height for the NE top. [...] Sir Hugh Munro chose the NE Top for the 1891 list with the comment “The Westerly top is given on the 6in OS as 3429; the easterly, -77, the first two figures being obliterated. [...] The height is probably therefore 3477 as above, as it is only slightly higher than the westerly top”. [...] The 1901 edition of the 6 inch (1:10560) map showed that the “-77” height was in fact 3377ft and therefore merely a point on the ridge. [...] Accordingly, the Munro summit {{was moved to the}} SW top in the 1921 edition of Munro's Tables. [...] This was reversed in 1981 when the 1046m <b>spot</b> <b>height</b> appeared on the 1976 1:25,000 map. The two high points are separated by a shallow depression at about 1031m with the current summit having a large cairn.|$|E

2500|$|Beinn a’ Chroin's summit 'moved' in the 1990s. [...] It has a 1.2 {{kilometre}} long summit ridge, {{two thirds}} {{to the west}} gently undulating with four tops and then one third with a distinct top at the eastern end, of the ridge separated by a col with a height of 877 metres. The recognised summit location of highest point of Beinn a’ Chroin changed in 1998. For all years prior, the official highest point of the mountain was the eastern end 940 metres. OS Landranger 1.50k map only showed a 938m <b>spot</b> <b>height</b> on western ridge. However autumn 1997 amateur cartographic sleuth Charles Everett noticed on the new OS 1.25k map, two small 940 metre contour rings without spot heights, on the western ridge, just 75 metres apart, one to NE one to SW. [...] Realizing that these both had {{to be higher than}} the eastern top, he sent a number of letters to the Ordnance Survey over next six months asking for: firstly, the exact heights inside these contour rings, and secondly, why these two points, both of which were clearly higher points on the mountain than the eastern 940m top, hadn’t had spot heights detailed on the map. [...] Initial response from some departments was unhelpful and frustrating and stating they were unable to give any information. [...] Persistence with another couple of letters eventually hit the jackpot with a July 8, 1998 letter confirming that there was a <b>spot</b> <b>height</b> of 941.5m in one of the contour rings, but frustratingly not specifying which. [...] Subsequently Harveys maps, when they republished their Crianlarich map, gave the NE contour ring on west ridge, 941m at 388186 and SW one 942m at 387185 representing the new summit position of Beinn a’Chroin. The eastern top has now become a subsidiary Munro “top” at 940 metres.|$|E
