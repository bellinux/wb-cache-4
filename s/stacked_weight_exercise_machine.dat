40|$|Objectives: The {{present study}} {{describes}} the oxygen uptake and total energy expenditure (including both aerobic and anaerobic contribution) response during three different circuit weight training (CWT) protocols of equivalent duration composed of free <b>weight</b> <b>exercises,</b> <b>machine</b> <b>exercises,</b> and {{a combination of}} free <b>weight</b> <b>exercises</b> intercalating aerobic exercise. Design: Controlled, randomized crossover designs. Methods: Subjects completed in a randomized order three circuit weight training protocols of the same duration (3 sets of 8 exercises, 45 min 15 s) and intensity (70 % of 15 repetitions maximum). The circuit protocols were composed of free <b>weight</b> <b>exercises,</b> <b>machine</b> <b>exercises,</b> {{or a combination of}} free <b>weight</b> <b>exercises</b> with aerobic exercise. Oxygen consumption and lactate concentration were measured throughout the circuit to estimate aerobic and anaerobic energy expenditure respectively. Results: Energy expenditure is higher in the combined exercise protocol (29. 9 ± 3. 6 ml/kg/min), compared with Freeweight (24. 2 ± 2. 8 ml/kg/min) and Machine (20. 4 ± 2. 9 ml/kg/min). The combined exercise protocol produced the highest total energy expenditure but the lowest lactate concentration and perceived exertion. The anaerobic contribution to total energy expenditure was higher in the machine and free weight protocols compared with the combined exercise protocol (6. 2 %, 4. 6 % and 2. 3 % respectively). Conclusions: In the proposed protocols, the combined exercise protocol results in the highest oxygen consumption. Total energy expenditure is related to the type of exercise included in the circuit. Anaerobic contributions to total energy expenditure during circuit weight training may be modest, but lack of their estimation may underestimate total energy expenditure...|$|R

40|$|Muscular {{strength}} can {{be measured}} by cable tensiometry, non-motorized dynamometry (e. g., handgrip dynamome-ter), motorized dynamometry, or with free <b>weights</b> or <b>exercise</b> <b>machines.</b> Advantages and disadvantages of each are discussed. Cross-sectional studies indicate that isometric and concentric strength levels peak between {{the second and third}} decade, remain unchanged until the fourth or fifth decade, and start to decline from about the fifth decade at a rate of 12 % to 15 % per decade until the eighth decade in men. Greater strength losses in both men and women have been suggested from the few longitudinal studies available on this topic. However, concentric strength levels in women tend to peak sooner, start to decline earlier, and decrease at a slightly slower rate than men. Age- and inactivity-induced sarcopenia explains some but not all of the losses in strength with age. There is a need to determine the separate roles of disease, inactivity, and normal aging on these losses. New findings from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging suggest a preservation of eccentric strength levels with age in women. ACCURATE and reliable assessments of muscularL strength in the elderly are important because of the many health and functional implications associated with the loss of strength and muscle mass with age (Hyatt et al., 1990; Buchner and deLateur, 1991; Bassey et al., 1992...|$|R

40|$|Music making has {{a number}} of {{beneficial}} effects for motor tasks compared to passive music listening. Given that recent research suggests that high energy musical activities elevate positive affect more strongly than low energy musical activities, we here investigated a recent method that combined music making with systematically increasing physiological arousal by <b>exercise</b> <b>machine</b> workout. We compared mood and anxiety after two exercise conditions on non-cyclical <b>exercise</b> <b>machines,</b> one with passive music listening and the other with musical feedback (where participants could make music with the <b>exercise</b> <b>machines).</b> The results showed that agency during <b>exercise</b> <b>machine</b> workout (an activity we previously labeled jymmin – a cross between jammin and gym) had an enhancing effect on mood compared to workout with passive music listening. Furthermore, the order in which the conditions were presented mediated the effect of musical agency for this subscale when participants first listened passively, the difference in mood between the two conditions was greater, suggesting that a stronger increase in hormone levels (e. g., endorphins) during the active condition may have caused the observed effect. Given an enhanced mood after training with musical feedback compared to passively listening to the same type of music during workout, the results suggest that <b>exercise</b> <b>machine</b> workout with musical feedback (jymmin) makes the act of <b>exercise</b> <b>machine</b> training more desirable...|$|R
