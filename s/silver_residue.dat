2500|$|With {{the rise}} of alchemy in the Chinese civilization, it {{was seen as an}} art. Among many practitioners, there were a {{significant}} number of women who mastered this art. The earliest recorded woman alchemist had the family name of Fang (...) , and she lived about around the first century B.C. Being raised in a scholarly family who were skilled in the alchemical arts, she was able to have studied alchemy with one of the Emperor Han Wu Ti's spouses, and therefore had access to the highest levels of society. Fang was credited with the discovery of how to turn mercury into silver. It was believed that she may have used the technique of silver extraction from ores using mercury, the pure <b>silver</b> <b>residue</b> is left behind from the boiled mercury. Fang's husband, Chheng Wei (...) , physically abused her, because he was trying to obtain the secret procedure from Fang, but she refused to give it to him. With the constant contact with mercury, Fang eventually went insane and killed herself, most likely due to mercury poisoning. It was noted that there were detail of Fang's life through the writing of Ge Hong, an author and alchemist.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop and characterize the polyethersulfone (PES) incorporated with silver (Ag) as an antibacterial membrane which can remove and disinfect bacteria in a single step for environmental application. The PES-Ag membrane was developed from PES, silver nitrate as an antibacterial agent and 2, 4, 6 -triaminopyrimidine (TAP) as compatibilizer. The influence of AgNO 3 loading, molecular weights (MW) of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as dispersant and type of compatibilizer have been investigated. The resulting membranes were characterized based on their thermal, tensile and structural properties which were used in correlation with the membrane antibacterial properties. The incorporation of Ag in PES membrane has increased the tensile strength doubled as compared to the unmodified PES. Furthermore, it was observed that the highest AgNO 3 loading (2 wt%) and the highest MW (360, 000) of PVP as dispersant has led to higher silver content on membrane surfaces. This is evidenced from energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). These properties have induced a better antibacterial activity in a disc-diffusion test against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). The structural characterization by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) revealed that by incorporating TAP as compatibilizer, smaller Ag particles size with improved distribution and average pore size of 0. 174 um was obtained. In addition, the <b>silver</b> <b>residue</b> during fabrication monitored by inductive coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was significantly reduced (62. 6 %). These parameters have led to E. coli removal of log reduction value (LRV) 3. 59 and 100 % growth inhibition tested on E. coli suspension of 1 x 106 colony forming unit (CFU/mL). From the adhesion test, this membrane exhibited the least E. coli adherence which in turn evidenced its anti-adhesion property. In conclusion, the PES-Ag membrane with TAP as compatibilizer produced was potential in bacteria removal and disinfection below the CFU maximum range for water and waste water treatment...|$|E

40|$|Dental amalgam {{residues}} {{are probably}} the most important chemical residues generated from clinical dental practice {{because of the presence of}} heavy metals among its constituents, mainly mercury and silver. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop an alternative method for the recovery of <b>silver</b> <b>residues</b> from dental amalgam. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The residue generated after vacuum distillation of dental amalgam for the separation of mercury was initially diluted with 32. 5 % HNO 3, followed by precipitation with 20 % NaCl. Sequentially, under constant heating and agitation with NaOH and sucrose, the sample was reduced to metallic silver. However, the processing time was too long, which turned this procedure not viable. In another sequence of experiments, the dilution was accomplished with concentrated HNO 3 at 90 ºC, followed by precipitation with 20 % NaCl. After washing, the pellet was diluted with concentrated NH 4 OH, water and more NaCl in order to facilitate the reaction with the reducer. RESULTS: Ascorbic acid was efficiently used as reducer, allowing a fast reduction, thus making the procedure viable. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed methodology is of easy application and does not require sophisticated equipment or expensive reagents. FAPESPODONTOPRE...|$|R

30|$|The Ag-NPs were {{synthesized}} {{by reducing}} AgNO 3 using ultrasonic {{waves in the}} presence of κ-carrageenan. Five suspensions were prepared, by adding 10 mL of 0.1 M AgNO 3 to 40 -mL κ-carrageenan. The κ-carrageenan solutions used were 0.1, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, and 0.3 wt%, respectively. The solutions were stirred for 1 h to obtain AgNO 3 /κ-carrageenan. Then, the samples were exposed to high-intensity ultrasound irradiation under amplitude of 50 % for 90 min at room temperature. Ultrasound irradiation was carried out with ultrasonic liquid processors (Hielscher ultrasound UP- 400 S, Teltow, Brandenburg, Germany, 50 / 100 Hz) immersed directly into the reaction solution. After that, the suspensions were centrifuged for 15 min and washed with double distilled water four times to remove the <b>silver</b> ion <b>residue.</b> The nanoparticles were precipitated then dried at 40 °C under vacuum overnight to obtain the Ag-NPs.|$|R

Feed {{material for the}} leaching procedures described in this report was the high-tension-separated metal concentrate obtained as a fraction from mechanically processing partially stripped electronic units. Initial pretreatment with a 20 -wt-pct-NaOH solution solubilized most of the aluminum. After washing, the resulting residue was incinerated to destroy any organics attached to metal particles. The incinerated residue was leached with 20 -vol-pct H 2 S 04 solution using two methods, countercurrent pressure and ultrasonic-aided leaching to solubilize the base metals, predominantly copper. Silver was recovered from the base metal leach residue using 50 -vol-pct HN 03, and gold contaminated with several percent palladium was recovered from the <b>silver</b> leach <b>residue</b> using aqua regia. The impure silver and gold plus palladium products represent about 1. 5 wt pct of the high-tension-separated metal concentrate.

Considering the environmental problems caused by the release and accumulation of silver chloride, this study aimed to design an efficient method for the recovery of silver nanoparticles in laboratory waste with antibacterial activity. Materials and Methods: This bench-scale experimental study was conducted on silver chloride waste samples accumulated during one semester from teaching laboratories in a batch system. Formalin and polyvinylpyrrolidone were used as the reducing and stabilizing agents, respectively. The size of nanoparticles, size distribution and stability of silver nanoparticles were investigated using transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering and UV-visible spectroscopy techniques, respectively. The antibacterial activity of silver nanoparticles was assessed by measuring minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) with a serial concentration method. Results: The {{results showed that the}} optimum silver recovery with small size and narrow size distribution was achieved in 0. 7 mol ammonia solution and the formalin/silver chloride mole ratio of 2. The MIC value against Gram-negative (E. coli ATCC 25922) and Gram-positive (S. aureus ATCC 29213) reference strains was 50 ppm, whereas the MIC of nanoparticles against the clinical isolate pathogen (Acinetobacterbaumanii) was 25 ppm.

40|$|Tobacco {{smoke is}} one of the {{greatest}} threats to human health and the leading cause of preventable death in the industrialized society. Among tobacco-containing products, cigarette represents the most commonly used. After cigarette combustion, a waste portion, defined as cigarette butt, is discarded. It consists of a filter, which retains in the matrix toxic smoke components, among which carcinogens and irritant substances. In spite of their benefits to smokers, cigarette filter pose a serious litter and toxic waste disposal problem, due to their not biodegradability and the persistence of many toxic chemicals. Therefore, cigarette butts need to be manipulated as special waste, with potential risks to human and environmental health. In present study, the genotoxicity risk of the cigarette butts was evaluated in the bacterial reverse mutation assay. Then, the ability of the natural sesquiterpenes β-caryophyllene (CRY) and β-caryophyllene oxide (CRYO) to inhibit their mutagenicity was studied, as a possible prevention strategy. A methanolic extract from the smoked Marlboro <b>Silver</b> cigarette <b>residues</b> (CBE, cigarette butt extract) was used as butt sample. The mutagenic effect of CBE was evaluated on Salmonella tiphymurium TA 98 and TA 100 and Escherichia coli WP 2 uvrA strains, both in the absence and presence of an exogenous CYP 450 -enriched metabolic activator (S 9) (Di Sotto et al., 2014). Thereafter, the antimutagenicity of CRY and CRYO was studied against CBE. In order to study the potential mechanism involved in the antimutagenicity of the extracts, three different protocols (pre-, co- and post-treatment) were applied. Results obtained showed that CBE produced mutagenic effects (increasing about twice the number of revertant colonies) in all the strains tested but only in the presence of the exogenous metabolic activator S 9. The concentration of 0. 3 mg/ml produced a sub-maximal mutagenic effect in all strains and was used in the antimutagenicity assay. Both sesquiterpenes (CRY 0. 43 - 1. 7 mg/m and CRYO 0. 09 - 0. 34 mg/ml) significantly reduced the CBE-induced revertant colonies, although with different potency and specificity. Antimutagenicity of CRY and CRYO was similar in S. tiphymurium strains, in all treatments. In contrast, CRYO was the most active compound in E. coli WP 2 uvrA, being the antimutagenic effect strong at all concentrations and protocols, while the CBE-mutagenicity inhibition produced by CRY was mostly moderate. In cell survival experiments, test compounds never produced cytotoxic effects in the presence of CBE. Present results allow hypothesize the involvement of multiple mechanisms (both desmutagenic and bioantimutagenic) in the antimutagenicity of the sesquiterpenes tested. Taking into account the potential toxicity due to cigarette butt exposure, also considering the mutagenic power here highlighted, CRY and CRYO appear to be possible further candidates as environmental decontaminants against this hazardous waste...|$|R
40|$|The Gaussian {{network model}} (GNM) {{can be used}} as a first {{approximation}} for describing the fluctuation dynamics of proteins, the limits of applicability and the range of validity of the model parameters need to be established. A systematic analysis of the GNM predictions is done within the scope of this thesis, and the potential utility of GNM for elucidating structure-dynamics-function relations in enzymes is explored. The application of the GNM to a set of 183 non-homologous proteins shows that it can predict the X-ray crystallographic temperature factors more precisely than full-atomic normal mode analysis (NMA) does. Furthermore, the application to 1250 non-redundant proteins indicates that the GNM predictions agree better with NMR solution data, than X-ray crystallographic, and measurements taken at high diffraction temperatures. A systematic study of 98 enzymes that belong to different enzyme classes (EC) shows that catalytic residues are distinguished by their restricted mobilities in the global modes. The amplitudes of their fluctuations rank in the lowest 7 % range amongst the rank-ordered mobilities of all residues. Catalytic residues also bear more restricted mobilities than their 4 flanked neighbors in sequence and this feature holds for more than 70 % of the examined catalytic residues, suggesting a communication between chemical activity and molecular mechanics. The observed restricted mobility of catalytic residues is used as a criterion for identifying active sites of enzymes in a newly developed algorithm (COMPACT). The method shows a high sensitivity and a moderate-to-low specificity for a set of representative monomeric enzymes. All the false-positives predicted by COMPACT are found to be highly conserved, suggesting that their finely tuned dynamics results from evolutionary pressure. These particular sites are proposed to serve as alternative drug binding targets. We have implemented this tool in iGNM, a database of protein dynamics. Protein dynamics stored in iGNM or computed from the online calculation server (oGNM) have assisted in identifying possible <b>silver</b> ion binding <b>residue</b> in creatinase and describing the loop mobilities of low-fidelity DNA polymerase.

40|$|The {{chemistry}} of radiotoxic ruthenium in a severe nuclear power accident has actively been investigated {{especially during the}} last decades. The Ru studies have covered the release from a fuel, the transport in the primary circuit and the behaviour in the containment building. The gathered experimental data have been utilized to understand the key parameters governing the Ru chemistry in a severe accident (SA) and to check {{the ability of the}} existing models of SA analysis codes to explain the experimental results. To further increase the knowledge on Ru behaviour, the collaboration on international level has been intensive. Lately, the widest and most active networks have been EU SARNET and EU SARNET 2. The valuable effort of these networks on sharing information of e. g. national programs and on interpreting the experimental results is continued in EU NUGENIA program. More detailed studies on separate phenomena have been conducted e. g. as part of OECD/NEA STEM/START and ISTP/VERDON programs. Furthermore, Phébus FP tests have produced valuable data on integral phenomena. The large-scale integral and semi-integral experiments have confirmed that Ru release depends strongly on carrier gas. Ru is significantly released from an irradiated fuel sample under oxidizing conditions, in particular when air is involved. In addition, the oxidation of UO 2 fuel seems to lead to a higher Ru release than in case of MOX fuel. Ruthenium can be transported to the containment atmosphere both in gaseous and particulate forms. The small-scale separate-effect experiments gave a detailed view on Ru transport. A high fraction of ruthenium was detected as particles at the outlet of the model primary circuit in an air atmosphere. However, the observed gaseous Ru fraction is higher than what could be expected based on thermodynamic equilibrium calculations. Further studies on the effect of flow residence time in a temperature gradient for the equilibrium of Ru oxides have been conducted. The effect of other fission products in the gas phase, as well as FP deposits on the surface of primary circuit, on the Ru transport has been investigated. For example, caesium containing deposits seemed to trap gaseous ruthenium effectively. Similarly in case of control rod <b>residues,</b> <b>silver</b> particles in the gas phase of the circuit acted as a sink for gaseous Ru. In an air ingress accident, the effect of air radiolysis products on the Ru chemistry becomes important. As the main air radiolysis products can be considered as oxidizing agents, their ability to oxidize the lower oxides of Ru to higher oxidation state has been examined. Most of Ru in the containment building ends up as deposits on the containment surfaces and in the sump. Experiments on the radiolytical revaporisation of ruthenium deposits on the epoxy paint surface indicated the release of gaseous ruthenium and it was enhanced under humid atmosphere and elevated temperature. It appeared that the products of air radiolysis caused by γ-radiation promoted the formation of gaseous ruthenium from Ru oxide deposits on paint in a higher amount than could be expected by pure ozone action. Concerning the irradiation tests of perruthenate aqueous solutions, they indicated the formation of gaseous Ru by γ-radiolysis products in solution...|$|R
