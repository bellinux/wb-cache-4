40|$|Abstract — Reliable {{furnace cooling}} {{technology}} is a domain of increasing concern to the metallurgical industry as it can significantly increase process intensities, productivity and campaign times of furnaces. Although there are many advantages in using cooling systems, they also impose a variety of problems mainly related to safety, heat losses and sustainability of the operations. The choice of cooling system is hence a matter of trade-offs and differs for every metallurgical application. This paper gives a systemic study and review of blast furnace <b>cooling</b> <b>stave</b> lining materials used in the metallurgical industries based on heat transfer analysis. Additionally, the paper describes a model which will be modeled and implemented using Pro- E modeling software.

40|$|The Phase- 1 upgrade of the LHC to full design luminosity, {{planned for}} 2019 at CERN, {{requires}} the modernisation {{of the experiments}} around the accelerator. The Inner Tracking System (ITS), the innermost detector at the ALICE experiment, will be upgraded by replacing the current apparatus by new silicon pixels arranged in 7 cylindrical layers. Each layer is composed by multiple independent modules, named staves, which provide mechanical support and cooling to the chips. This thesis aims to develop and validate experimentally an ultra-lightweight <b>stave</b> <b>cooling</b> system for the ITS Upgrade. The moderate thermal requirements, with a nominal power density of 0. 15 W/cm^ 2 and a maximum chip temperature of 30 ºC, are counterweighted by extreme low-mass restrictions, obliging to resort to lightweight, non-metallic materials, such as carbon fibre-reinforced polymers and plastics. Novel lightweight stave concepts were developed and experimentally validated, meeting the thermal requirements with minimal material inventory. The proposed staves are made of thin, layered, composite high thermal conductivity carbon fibre plates, with dimensions up to 1502 × 30 mm, and innovative polyimide cooling channels, with inner diameters (IDs) ranging from 1. 024 mm to 2. 667 mm and thin walls. Six different stave layouts were tested with water at sub-atmospheric pressure (leak-less cooling), showing excellent cooling performances: the temperature differences between the heated surfaces and the coolant are below 7 K at 0. 15 W/cm^ 2, with low surface temperature gradients. Cooling tests with evaporative C 4 F 10 refrigerant were performed on the baseline stave prototypes, yielding similar thermal performance as with water. This indicates that the thermal resistance of conduction in the stave dominates over the convective one between the channel wall and the coolant. A two-phase coolant would display low material inventory thanks {{to the presence of}} the vapour phase, lighter than liquid. An experimental study on the two-phase coolant inventory was carried out in one stave. The results are compared with void fraction prediction methods integrated along the cooling channel length, to find the best one for calculating the material budget of the two-phase coolant. An experimental study on the two-phase pressure drop and flow boiling heat transfer in a 2. 689 mm ID water-heated polyimide channel was performed, using R 245 fa as operating fluid. Mass fluxes ranging from 100 to 500 kg/(m^ 2 s), heat fluxes from 15 to 55 kW/m^ 2, vapour qualities between 0. 05 and 0. 80, and saturation temperatures of 35, 41 and 47 ºC were considered in the 300 -point experimental database. The influence of the two-phase flow parameters on the mean heat transfer coefficient was analysed parametrically, being its lack of dependence on the heat flux the major finding. Finally, the results were compared with other experimental data and with prediction methods in the literature.

40|$|We report {{results from}} a {{detailed}} study of the sloshing gas {{in the core of}} A 496. We detect the low temperature/entropy spiral feature found in several cores, we also find that conduction between the gas in the spiral and the ambient medium must be suppressed by more than one order of magnitude with respect to Spitzer conductivity. Intriguingly, while the gas in the spiral features a higher metal abundance than the surrounding medium, it follows the entropy vs metal abundance relation defined by gas lying outside the spiral. The most plausible explanation for this behavior is that the low entropy metal rich plasma uplifted through the cluster atmosphere by sloshing, suffers little heating or mixing with the ambient medium. While sloshing appears to be capable of uplifting significant amounts of gas, the limited heat exchange and mixing between gas in and outside the spiral implies that this mechanism is not at all effective in: 1) permanently redistributing metals within the core region and 2) heating up the coolest and densest gas, thereby providing little or no contribution to <b>staving</b> of catastrophic <b>cooling</b> in cool cores.

Three dimensional heat transfer and thermal stresses of a <b>cooling</b> <b>stave</b> in a blast furnace is modeled and analyzed using the developed system.

40|$|We {{examine the}} long-standing cooling flow problem in galaxy {{clusters}} with 3 D MHD simulations of isolated clusters including radiative cooling and anisotropic thermal conduction along magnetic field lines. The central {{regions of the}} intracluster medium (ICM) can have cooling timescales of ~ 200 Myr or shorter [...] {{in order to prevent}} a cooling catastrophe the ICM must be heated by some mechanism such as AGN feedback or thermal conduction from the thermal reservoir at large radii. The cores of galaxy clusters are linearly unstable to the heat-flux-driven buoyancy instability (HBI), which significantly changes the thermodynamics of the cluster core. The HBI is a convective, buoyancy-driven instability that rearranges the magnetic field to be preferentially perpendicular to the temperature gradient. For a wide range of parameters, our simulations demonstrate that {{in the presence of the}} HBI, the effective radial thermal conductivity is reduced to less than 10 % of the full Spitzer conductivity. With this suppression of conductive heating, the cooling catastrophe occurs on a timescale comparable to the central cooling time of the cluster. Thermal conduction alone is thus unlikely to stabilize clusters with low central entropies and short central cooling timescales. High central entropy clusters have sufficiently long cooling times that conduction can help <b>stave</b> off the <b>cooling</b> catastrophe for cosmologically interesting timescales.

40|$|X-ray {{observations}} of many clusters of galaxies reveal {{the presence of}} edges in surface brightness and temperature, known as "cold fronts". In relaxed clusters with cool cores, these edges have been interpreted as evidence for the "sloshing" of the core gas in the cluster's gravitational potential. The smoothness of these edges has been interpreted as evidence for the stabilizing effect of magnetic fields "draped" around the front surfaces. To check this hypothesis, we perform high-resolution magnetohydrodynamics simulations of magnetized gas sloshing in galaxy clusters initiated by encounters with subclusters. We go beyond previous works on the simulation of cold fronts in a magnetized intracluster medium by simulating their formation in realistic, idealized mergers with high resolution ((Delta) x approx. 2 kpc). Our simulations sample a parameter space of plausible initial magnetic field strengths and field configurations. In the simulations, we observe strong velocity shears associated with the cold fronts amplifying the magnetic field along the cold front surfaces, increasing the magnetic field strength in these layers by up to an order of magnitude, and boosting the magnetic pressure up to near-equipartition with thermal pressure in some cases. In these layers, the magnetic field becomes strong enough to stabilize the cold fronts against Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, resulting in sharp, smooth fronts as those seen in {{observations of}} real clusters. These magnetic fields also result in strong suppression of mixing of high and low-entropy gas in the cluster, seen in our simulations of mergers {{in the absence of}} a magnetic field. As a result, the heating of the core due to sloshing is very modest and is unable to <b>stave</b> off a <b>cooling</b> catastrophe...|$|R
40|$|Active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets {{carry more}} than {{sufficient}} energy to <b>stave</b> off catastrophic <b>cooling</b> of the intracluster medium (ICM) in the cores of cool-core clusters. However, {{in order to}} prevent catastrophic cooling, the ICM must be heated in a near-isotropic fashion and narrow bipolar jets with P-jet = 10 (44 - 45) erg s(- 1), typical of radio AGNs at cluster centers, are inefficient in heating the gas in the transverse direction to the jets. We argue that due to existent conditions in cluster cores, the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) will, in addition to accreting gas via radiatively inefficient flows, experience short stochastic episodes of enhanced accretion via thin disks. In general, the orientation of these accretion disks will be misaligned with the spin axis of the black holes (BHs) and the ensuing torques will cause the BH's spin axis (and therefore the jet axis) to slew and rapidly change direction. This model not only explains recent observations showing successive generations of jet-lobes-bubbles in individual cool-core clusters that are offset from each other in the angular direction with respect to the cluster center, but also shows that AGN jets can heat the cluster core nearly isotropically on the gas cooling timescale. Our model does require that the SMBHs at the centers of cool-core clusters be spinning relatively slowly. Torques from individual misaligned disks are ineffective at tilting rapidly spinning BHs by more than a few degrees.

40|$|During the construction, {{installation}} and initial {{operation of the}} Evaporative Cooling System for the ATLAS Inner Detector SCT Barrel Sub-detector, some performance characteristics were observed to be inconsistent with the original design specifications, therefore the assumptions made in the ATLAS Inner Detector TDR were revisited. The main concern arose because of unexpected pressure drops in the piping system {{from the end of}} the detector structure to the distribution racks. The author of this theses made a series of measurements of these pressure drops and the thermal behavior of SCT-Barrel <b>cooling</b> <b>Stave.</b> Tests were performed on the installed detector in the pit, and using a specially assembled full scale replica in the SR 1 laboratory at CERN. This test setup has been used to perform extensive tests of the cooling performance of the system including measurements of pressure drops in different parts of system, studies of the thermal profile along the stave pipe for different running conditions / parameters and coolant flow measurements in the system. The pressure drops in the system and the associated temperatures in the barrel cooling loops have been studied as a function of the system variables, for example; input liquid pressure, vapour back pressure, module power load and input liquid temperature. Measurements were performed with 10, 11, 12, 13 barabs inlet liquid pressure in system, 1. 2, 1. 6, 2. 0, 2. 5, 3. 0, 4. 0, 5. 0, 6. 0 barabs vapour back pressure in system, and 0 W, 3 W, 6 W, 9 W, 10. 5 W power applied per silicon module. The measurements clearly show that the cooling system can not achieve the design evaporation temperature of - 25 C in every part of the detector (SCT Barrel loops) in case of 13 barabs nominal inlet liquid pressure, 1. 2 barabs minimum possible back pressure and 6 W nominal power per SCT Barrel silicon module and especially at the end of the ATLAS ID operation period when modules will work on full power of 10. 5 W. This will lead to the problem of thermal run-away of the ATLAS SCT, especially near the end of the operational period after significant radiation exposure has occurred. The LHC luminosity profile, depletion voltage and leakage current values and the total power dissipated from the modules were revised. Thermal runaway limits for the ATLAS SCT sub-detector were also revised. Results show that coolants evaporation temperature necessary for the sub-detector's safe operation over the full lifetime (10 years) is - 15 C with a safety factor of 2. Laboratory measurements clearly show that the cooling system can not achieve even this necessary evaporation temperature of - 15 C. It is now impossible to make mechanical modifications to the cooling system, for example; changing the diameter of the cooling pipes, or the thermal performance of the in-system heat exchanger or reducing the vapour back pressure. It was therefore decided to investigate changes to the cooling fluid and to test mixtures of Hexafluoroethane (R 116) C 2 F 6 and Octafluoropropane(R 218) C 3 F 8 at differing ratios instead of just pure C 3 F 8 coolant presently used. For this purpose, a new "blending" machine was assembled in the SR 1 laboratory, with a new device an "on-line acoustic flow meter and fluorocarbon coolant mixture analyzer" (Sonar Analyzer) attached to it. The Machines were connected to the already existing laboratory test station and new extensive tests were performed to investigate different proportion of C 3 F 8 /C 2 F 6 blends to find the mixture ratio which resulted in the best operational performance as measured by: the temperature distribution, pressure drops and flow parameters over the system, to ensure best cooling performance of SCT Barrel cooling loops for long term ATLAS SCT operation.
