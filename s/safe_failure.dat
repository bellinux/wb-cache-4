40|$|Safety {{instrumented}} systems (SISs) are {{of prime}} {{importance to the}} process industry to avoid catastrophic consequences or even loss of human life. The dangerous situations that any equipment may face should be analysed in order to quantify the associated risk and to choose a design of the SIS that reduces the risk to a tolerable level. The <b>safe</b> <b>failure</b> fraction (SFF) is a parameter defined in the standards IEC 61508 and IEC 61511, and is {{used to determine the}} need for additional channels that can activate the safety function if a failure is present. The standards consider a high SFF as an indicator of a safe design, and by increasing SFF, one may allow a lower redundancy level for a SIS and therefore reduce costs. Safety engineers discuss the suitability of this parameter, and some argue that the negative effects of safe failures on the reliability are so significant that the parameter should not be used. For a safety shutdown valve installed to prevent overpressure, a <b>safe</b> <b>failure</b> is defined as a spurious closure where the source of high pressure is isolated. This thesis examines the effects of safe failures on the reliability of such systems by using a Markov model. According to IEC 61508 and IEC 61511 the system reliability of a safety shutdown system is measured by the probability of failure on demand (PFD). From the results it can be concluded that the time needed to restore the system back to initial state after a <b>safe</b> <b>failure</b> does not {{have a significant effect on}} PFD. A long restoration time after a <b>safe</b> <b>failure</b> in combination with a high frequency of safe failures is negative with respect to production downtime. The main contributor to PFD is the long run probability of being in a state where a dangerous undetected (DU) failure is present. DU failures are normally detected by function tests or sometimes upon demand, but they can also be revealed by a spurious closure. This effect is based on the assumption of perfect repair of safe failures, which means that all possible failure modes are detected and the failed items are repaired or replaced after restoration of safe failures. The ability to reveal DU failures is clearly dependent on the frequency of a DU failure and <b>safe</b> <b>failure</b> occurring in the same test interval. This thesis demonstrates that safe failures only have significant effect when the dangerous failure rate is high. Other parameters affect the PFD to a greater extent, and the importance of exact parameter estimation is crucial and more important than the positive effects of safe failures. The SFF must be close to 100 % to have a significant effect on the PFD, and since it is always aimed at minimising the number of dangerous failures, the alternative is to add safe failures. This is probably not the intent of SFF and is negative with respect to production downtime. Safe failures does not justify a lower degree of redundancy. On the other hand, the positive effects of safe failures show a satisfactory reason for adopting a longer test interval. This is an optimisation of PFD and can reduce costs or even the frequency of dangerous situations during start-up and shutdown. This thesis demonstrates that the PFD is not affected by safe failures, and indicates no reason to be in doubt about this parameter as a measure of reliability. The SFF gives hardly any information and the choice of SIS architecture should not be based on SFF alone. An alternative parameter that considers different means of revealing DU failures seems to be a better choice. </p...|$|E

5000|$|The first {{element of}} urban climate {{resiliency}} focuses on “systems’ or the physical infrastructure embedded in urban systems. A critical concern of urban resiliency {{is linked to}} the idea of maintaining support systems that in turn enable the networks of provisioning and exchange for populations in urban areas. [...] These systems concern both physical infrastructure in the city and ecosystems within or surrounding the urban center; while working to provide essential services like food production, flood control, or runoff management. [...] For example, city electricity, a necessity of urban life, depends on the performance of generators, grids, and distant reservoirs. The failure of these core systems jeopardizes human well-being in these urban areas, with that being said, it is crucial to maintain them in the face of impending environmental disturbances. Societies need to build resiliency into these systems in order to achieve such a feat. Resilient systems work to “ensure that functionality is retained and can be re-instated through system linkages” despite some failures or operational disturbances. Ensuring the functionality of these important systems is achieved through instilling and maintaining flexibility {{in the presence of a}} “safe failure.” [...] Resilient systems achieve flexibility by making sure that key functions are distributed in a way that they would not all be affected by a given event at one time, what is often referred to as spatial diversity, and has multiple methods for meeting a given need, what is often referred to as functional diversity. [...] The presence of <b>safe</b> <b>failures</b> also plays a critical role in maintaining these systems, which work by absorbing sudden shocks that may even exceed design thresholds. [...] Environmental disturbances are certainly expected to challenge the dexterity of these systems, so the presence of <b>safe</b> <b>failures</b> almost certainly appears to be a necessity.|$|R

Despite the extensive investment in flood control works, neither flood occurrences nor damages are decreasing. A possible consequence of climate change is an increased frequency of extreme meteorological events that may cause floods. Discussion is offered of some recent large floods in the world and of the experiences in combating floods in Japan. Floods change over time as societies change. There is no single universal remedy against floods and site-specific local efforts are necessary. It is essential to undertake damage mitigation measures together with physical control measures for flood management in an integrated approach, using a mixture of structural and non-structural means. A more disaster conscious society needs to be built with better preparedness and safe-fail (<b>safe</b> in <b>failure)</b> rather than, unrealistic, fail-safe (<b>safe</b> from <b>failure)</b> design of flood defences.

40|$|This article {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the research conducted by the authors from the design concept to the engineering and full-scale testing of the bundled glass column. Consisting of adhesively bonded solid glass rods, the bundled column is a promising solution for transparent compressive members. To investigate the feasibility of the bundled column for real applications, a production method is developed first for manufacturing specimens with guaranteed, consistent structural and visual performance. The final column consists of six solid circular rods adhesively bonded to a central star-shaped profile by a clear, UV-curing adhesive. To validate the design, series of prototypes up to 2. 4 m long are made and tested in compression. With the aim of securing a more gradual and thus <b>safer</b> <b>failure,</b> a post-tensioned steel tendon is introduced to one of the 2. 4 m long series and experimentally evaluated. The results demonstrate that the chosen adhesive and rod configuration enable the designed column to perform monolithically under loading and fail in values close to the theoretical buckling force. The results of the post-tensioned specimens suggest that post-tensioning allows for a more ductile and more consistent failure, which in turn can allow reduced safety factors. Based on the findings, suggestions are made for the further engineering of the bundled column.

40|$|A {{significant}} number of investigations has been performed to improve the unsafe (brittle) failure behaviour of glass beams. Similar to reinforced concrete, reinforced glass beams have been developed in which stainless steel {{is embedded in the}} glass laminate to obtain <b>safe</b> <b>failure</b> behaviour. The concept has been proven to be feasible when assuming statically determinate systems. However, the additional system safety of statically indeterminate systems has not been investigated yet. This paper presents numerical research outcomes on reinforced glass beams with statically determinate as well as statically indeterminate support conditions. In a first step, a model of a twosided reinforced beam subjected to three-point bending was created for validation purposes. The thickness and height of the constituents making up the model were based on experimental measurements of test specimens. Subsequently, the same numerical model was made using nominal dimensions for the glass and reinforcement. In this way, the effect of dimensional tolerances on the load-carrying behaviour was investigated. Furthermore, a single-sided reinforced glass beam was modelled under the same loading conditions to assess the effect of adding compressive reinforcement. In a second step, statically indeterminate two-sided reinforced beam models were constructed based on the statically determinate model. From these preliminary models, the load-carrying behaviour and effect of reinforcement percentage were evaluated. Finally, also the stress redistribution capacity of both beam models was assessed. It is concluded that dimensional tolerances {{have a significant effect on}} the load-carrying behaviour and should therefore be accounted for in the design of reinforced glass beams. The additional compressive reinforcement provides slightly higher bending stiffness, initial failure load and yield load to the glass beams, although it does not contribute in the yield phase. However, a different ultimate collapse mechanism is expected as the compressive reinforcement can take the stress when the glass compressive zone has failed. The statically indeterminate simulations proved the feasibility of applying reinforced glass beams in statically indeterminate systems as a <b>safe</b> <b>failure</b> behaviour was observed with significant stress redistribution capacity. Changing the reinforcement percentage has a significant effect on the load-carrying behaviour of these systems. However, the overall behaviour remains safe...|$|E

While transparency is the key reason to use glass beams. An edge integrated metal section, {{which is used to}} reach <b>safe</b> <b>failure</b> behavior, seems to provide an opportunity for a more transparent connection.
