40|$|The {{experiment}} {{introduced in}} this work used a so called reaction microscopes {{in connection with the}} free-electron laser in Hamburg (FLASH) to study the in fluence of very intense UV-radiation of 46 eV and 38 eV photon energy in the region of 10 [high 12]- 10 [high 14] W/cm 2 on the nitrogen molecule N 2. Besides the identi cation of various highly charged fragmentation channels and their intensity dependences radial distributions were measured and allowed a reconstruction of the excitation and ionisation pathways. Furthermore a multilayer mirror composed of molybdenum and <b>silicon</b> <b>wa</b> used to perform the rst pump-probe measurements with nitrogen. Strong intensity dependences were detected as well as formerly not observed effects of unknown origin...|$|E
40|$|The {{properties}} of phosphorus-doped molybdenum silicide as a gate elec-trode, interconnecting material, and impurity diffusion source for LSrs have been studied. The phosphorus-doped molybdenum silicide films were deposited by co-sputtering using specially designed Mo and Si targets in a PHs/Ar atmosphere. PH 8 decomposed to P and H 2 during sputtering and the phos-phorus combined with Mo and Si. Typically, a phosphorus concentration of 1. 5 â€¢ 1021 cm- ~ {{in the films}} was used. As-deposited films (Mo/Si [...] - 0. 5) had amorphous tructure and high resistivity. After the films were annealed at temperatures above 800 ~ they became polycrystalline and resistivity was decreased. The resistivity of the film with a Mo/Si ratio of 2 to 1 was 7. 5 X 10 - 5 ~-cm with annealing at 1000 ~ in N 2. Phosphorus was able to dif-fuse from the doped molybdenum silicide films to the Si substrate during annealing in 02. After high temperature annealing up to ll 00 ~ the contact resistance between the molybdenum silicide and the <b>silicon</b> substrate <b>wa...</b>|$|R
40|$|We use {{empirical}} {{molecular dynamics}} technique {{to study the}} low-energy vibrations in a large 4096 atom model for pure amorphous silicon {{and a set of}} models with voids of different size based on it. Numerical vibrational eigenvalues and eigenvectors for our models are obtained by exact diagonalization of their dynamical matrices. Our calculations show that localized low-energy vibrational excitations of rather complex structure are present in amorphous silicon models with voids. According to their spatial localization patterns we make an attempt to classify these excitations as modes associated with the void and "mixed" modes associated with the interaction of the void with strained regions of <b>silicon</b> network.
