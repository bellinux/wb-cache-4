After a preliminary experimental evaluation {{of the performance of}} the bare RC structure, a design approach based on the capacity spectrum method has been developed according to the procedure provided in the ATC 40 American guidelines.

40|$|Popularity of Cold-Formed Steel (CFS) {{structures}} {{has recently}} increased considerably {{in the last}} years as a consequence of discovered advantages such as lightness of the material, significant energy absorption capacity providing seismic performance against lateral loading, time efficiency and cost effectiveness. CFS structures are composed of <b>shear</b> <b>panels</b> which involve cold-formed steel bare frames coated with different kind of sheathings such as gypsumwallboard (GWB), oriented strand board (OSB), plywood or some infill materials which are connected to the frame. Combination of CFS bare frames and sheathing boards provides the shear panelswith lateral load resistance against seismic actions. There are several factorswhich have a direct influence on the behavior of CFS <b>shear</b> <b>panels</b> such as type of sheathing board, thickness of cold-formed steel, spacing of the screws binding the sheathing board to the bare frame and magnitude of the axial loads. On behalf of observing the impact of these outlined factors upon the behavior of CFS <b>shear</b> <b>panels</b> as well as to attain some experimental data to be utilized in the new Turkish Earthquake Code 2016, a considerable amount of laboratory tests was conducted in Structures Laboratory of Bogazici University on different configurations of CFS <b>shear</b> <b>panels.</b> Posterior to the acquisition of these experimental data, studies upon developing analytical models representing the actual experimental behavior of one of the <b>shear</b> <b>panels</b> have been conducted, thus providing possibilities for 3 -D seismic performance assessment of a representative one-story cold-formed steel structure for the final part of this paper. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. June 2016. Major: Civil Engineering. Advisor: Roberto Ballarini. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xii, 311 pages. This thesis presents {{the investigation of}} the performance of a new ductile seismic resistant steel bracing system, called the Braced Ductile <b>Shear</b> <b>Panel</b> (BDSP), which can be used to provide the necessary lateral strength to steel braced frame buildings in high seismic areas. The proposed system is comprised of a sacrificial rectangular <b>shear</b> <b>panel,</b> connected to the frame by four short concentric braces. The BDSP is envisioned as an economical alternative to more expensive bracing systems, while still providing increased design control and similar performance levels. First, the development of the BDSP concept is illustrated, and equations are developed to predict the elastic and plastic response of the <b>shear</b> <b>panel</b> based on its geometry by means of a reduced model, and a numerical parametric study. To validate the results of the computational study, an experimental program is conducted on a half-scale steel frame braced with a BDSP. Ten <b>shear</b> <b>panel</b> specimens with varying geometry are tested under quasi-static cyclic lateral loading. The data from this program is then used to verify the accuracy of the results obtained from a detailed three-dimensional finite element model, which is later used to compute the response of the BDSP systems. Finally, the design of the BDSP system for a sample 12 -story office building is presented. The design is then evaluated by conducting nonlinear dynamic analyses, following the methodology in FEMA P 695. This work shows that the Braced Ductile <b>Shear</b> <b>Panel</b> can achieve high level of ductility, and it can, in fact, represent a viable, economical alternative to provide a building with the necessary lateral strength...|$|E
40|$|Impact {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on <b>shear</b> <b>panels</b> fabricated from 6061 -T 6 aluminum and from woven fabric prepreg of Du Pont Kevlara fiber/epoxy resin and graphite fiber/epoxy resin. The <b>shear</b> <b>panels</b> consisted of three different composite laminates and one aluminum material configuration. Three panel aspect ratios were evaluated for each material configuration. Composite panels were impacted with a 1. 27 -cm (0. 05 -in) diameter aluminum sphere at low velocities of 46 m/sec (150 ft/sec) and 67 m/sec (220 ft/sec). Ballistic impact conditions consisted of a tumbled 0. 50 -caliber projectile impacting loaded composite and aluminum <b>shear</b> <b>panels.</b> The results of these tests indicate that ballistic threshold load (the lowest load which will result in immediate failure upon penetration by the projectile) varied between 0. 44 and 0. 61 of the average failure load of undamaged panels. The residual strengths of the panels after ballistic impact varied between 0. 55 and 0. 75 of the average failure strength of the undamaged panels. The low velocity impacts at 67 m/sec (220 ft/sec) caused a 15 to 20 percent reduction in strength, whereas the impacts at 46 m/sec (150 ft/sec) resulted in negligible strength loss. Good agreement was obtained between the experimental failure strengths and the predicted strength with the point stress failure criterion...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: One of {{the major}} {{shortcomings}} of conventional and rather high-rise structures is increasing lateral displacements arising from lateral forces which finally make the entire project un-economical. In this research, effort {{has been made to}} investigate the effect of shear walls arrangements on the lateral displacement of the structure. Two types of structures including 16 and 32 -storeys frameswith different arrangements of <b>shear</b> <b>panels</b> were examined. The findings indicate that compared to other frames, the performance of frame no. 1 in both types of structures was poor in controlling the overall displacement of structure. Furthermore, more number of <b>shear</b> <b>panels</b> are not necessarily effective in reducing the overall displacement of structure but the type of arrangement had significant effect.

It is a great candidate to prevent seismic disaster for tall buildings to pay minimum costs.

40|$|A <b>shear</b> <b>panel</b> dampers {{consisting}} of stiffeners and a panel surrounding four flanges {{are used as}} aseismic dampers for buildings in Japan. Cracks can easily form in a <b>shear</b> <b>panel</b> damper when the panel undergoes shear buckling during cyclic loading caused by a severe earthquake. The damper's plastic deformation capacity can be enhanced by installing several vertical and horizontal stiffeners on the panel. Plastic deformation capacity means the amplitude of cyclic deformation angle under which the damper's strength keeps its designed yield strength. Overall shear buckling of the panel causes sudden deterioration of the damper's strength. Hence, overall shear buckling in a panel must be prevented {{to ensure that the}} <b>shear</b> <b>panel</b> damper maintains its yield strength up to an assumed deformation angle. Chusilp and Usami proposed an optimum stiffener flexural rigidity ratio, which defines the stiffener's sectional properties in which subpanels divided by stiffeners reach shear buckling before the panel undergoes overall shear buckling. However, the terms of the Fourier series in the Rayleigh-Ritz method were 6 x 6, and the accuracy of the plate buckling coefficient is not satisfactory. The torsional rigidity of the stiffener is not taken into account in the analysis. Application conditions are restricted so that the vertical and horizontal stiffeners must be the same. Hence, we derived an equation for the shear buckling eigen value problem considering the effect of the stiffener's torsional rigidity from the principle of virtual work. Then, the optimum stiffener flexural rigidity ratio was calculated by the regula-falsi method using various combination numbers of vertical and horizontal stiffeners. Then, the required sectional properties of the stiffener are clarified for a <b>shear</b> <b>panel</b> damper...|$|E

The finite element method is applied to examine the buckling performance and postbuckling stability. The postbuckling response of the optimized truss lattice is shown to be stable in all cases.

40|$|Use of Cold-Formed Steel (CFS) {{systems has}} {{increased}} significantly {{during the last}} decades. Advantages of cold-formed steel involve short construction time, effective cost and time management, lightweight inherence of the material and high structural performance against lateral loading. CFS structures are mainly formed of CFS frames coated with different kind of sheathings such as gypsum wallboard (GWB), oriented strand board (OSB), plywood or some infill materials which are squeezed to the frame. As the CFS frame is sheathed {{with one of these}} sheathing types, it can behave similar to a <b>shear</b> <b>panel</b> which is capable of resisting lateral forces. The behavior of these shear panels is dependent on many factors such as thickness of the sheathing and cold-formed steel, dimensions of the <b>shear</b> <b>panel,</b> type and spacing of fasteners as well as type of sheathing.

It is called the Perforated Yielding <b>Shear</b> <b>Panel</b> Device (PYSPD). It comprises of a thin perforated diaphragm plate welded inside a short length square hollow section. The device is to be connected in the lateral load resisting system of a structure with the diaphragm plate being in {{the plane of the}} building frame. It is a displacement-based device in which energy is dissipated through plastic shear deformation of its perforated diaphragm plate. The PYSPD is {{a modified version of the}} previously tested Yielding <b>Shear</b> <b>Panel</b> Device (YSPD). Perforations on the diaphragm plate alleviate demand on supporting elements which reduces undesirable local deformations near the connections. As a result more stable force-displacement hysteresis is obtained. Three patterns of perforations are studied. Finite element models confirm that diagonal tension field develops under shearing action but stress patterns are affected by perforations. Two plate slenderness and three perforation patterns combinations were tested experimentally. Under quasi-static condition, devices with certain plate slenderness produced stable and repeatable force-displacement hysteresis, and achieved large energy dissipation capability. Compared to un-perforated specimens, perforations reduce elastic stiffness and yield strength. Under design displacement it produced a stable hysteretic behavior and endured code requirements against low-cycle fatigue...|$|E

40|$|In the Ph. D. thesis, {{the seismic}} effect of {{cladding}} <b>panels</b> and steel <b>shear</b> <b>panels</b> on the reinforced concrete and steel frames is discussed. We limited {{the research of}} sandwich panels to single-storey steel frame buildings, where {{the use of the}} sandwich panels is common. Using multi-storey RC frame buildings, we examined the effect of <b>shear</b> <b>panels,</b> which have bigger shear capacity than the cladding panels. First, we performed extensive tests aimed at determining the capacity of the connection of two shear plates, then we performed nine tests of the systems of cladding panels with dimensions 3. 0 / 2. 6 m. The tests have been examined closely and based on their results we defined a bi-linear envelope for an equivalent diagonal. The diagonal is used to model the cladding panels in frame structures. The envelope is defined {{on the basis of the}} bearing resistance of the steel sheeting, which is a result of shear test of the connection of two steel sheetings. In the cases, where experimental results were not available, we applied the Eurocode 3 formulas for capacity. We used the American standard AISC instructions to define the properties of the equivalent diagonal. We presented the influence of sandwich panels on an industrial steel building of the manufacturer Trimo. Results of numerical analysis show that sandwich panels are able to ensure a proper lateral resistance. However, the measures that insure the proper behaviour of the panels are extremely expensive and therefore economically unjustified. These expenses could only be reduced by developing a new cladding panel with better frame-to-panel and panel-to-panel connections. We examined the influence of the steel <b>shear</b> <b>panels</b> on an old three-storey RC frame building (SPEAR). We also compared its behaviour with the behaviour of four buildings, that were designed in complete or in partial agreement with Eurocode 8.
