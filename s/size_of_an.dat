40|$|We {{introduce}} a technique using linear programming {{that may be}} used to analyse the worst-case performance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> class <b>of</b> greedy heuristics for certain optimisation problems on regular graphs. We demonstrate the use of this technique on heuristics for bounding the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minimum maximal matching (MMM), a minimum connected dominating set (MCDS) and a minimum independent dominating set (MIDS) in cubic graphs. As a result, we show that for n-vertex connected cubic graphs, the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> MMM is at most 9 n/ 20 + O(1), the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> MCDS is at most 3 n/ 4 + O(1) and the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> MIDS is at most 29 n/ 70 + O(1). We also consider n-vertex connected cubic graphs of girth at least 5 and for such graphs we show that the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> MMM is at most 3 n/ 7 + O(1), the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> MCDS is at most 2 n/ 3 + O(1) and the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> MIDS is at most 3 n/ 8 + O(1) ...|$|R

5|$|Adult {{males and}} juveniles are quite {{different}} in appearance to the female. They are smaller in size, being about one sixth the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> adult female. Juveniles have a brown carapace, with a predominantly white abdomen which has a series of red-orange diamonds running along the dorsal region bordered on either side by irregular black lines. Males retain this coloration into adulthood. Due to its much smaller size, Urquhart (1886) believed the male to be a separate species and named it Theridion melanozantha. This was not rectified until 1933 when it was correctly identified as the male Latrodectus katipo.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the {{diameter}} of Eris {{was measured to be}} , using images from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object is determined from its absolute magnitude (H) and the albedo (the amount of light it reflects). At a distance of 97AU, an object with a diameter of 3,000km would have an angular size of 40milliarcseconds, which is directly measurable with the Hubble Space Telescope. Although resolving such small objects is at the very limit of its capabilities, sophisticated image processing techniques such as deconvolution can be used to measure such angular sizes fairly accurately.|$|E

Member States, regional groups and other Member State interest groupings developed different positions and proposals on how to move forward on this contested issue.|$|E

5|$|After {{a failed}} attempt to assassinate President Dale, the Martians invade Earth, {{starting}} with Washington, D.C. As they attack the White House (and incinerate the White House tour guide), the Secret Service evacuates the President, but the First Lady Marsha is crushed to death by the Nancy Reagan chandelier. Taffy vanishes during the chaos. After the U.S. government unsuccessfully attempts a nuclear attack on the mother ship, the Martians expand their invasion {{to the rest of}} Earth, defacing world landmarks for their own amusement as they do so. That night, the Martians breach the bunker where Dale has been taken and the leader reduces Decker to the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> insect before killing him. The Martians kill everyone else in the bunker except for Dale, who makes an impassioned speech in an attempt to plea for peace and his life. The Martians seem convinced, but then use a false hand to kill the President.|$|E
5|$|Due to lack {{of space}} at the University of Chicago, Spedding {{proposed}} to organise part of the Chemistry Division at Iowa State College in Ames, where he had colleagues {{who were willing to}} help. It was agreed that Spedding would spend half of each week in Ames, and half in Chicago. The first problem on the agenda was to find uranium for the nuclear reactor that Enrico Fermi was proposing to build. The only uranium metal available commercially was produced by the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company, using a photochemical process that produced ingots the size of a quarter that were sold for around $20 per gram. Edward Creutz, the head of the group responsible for fabricating the uranium, wanted a metal sphere the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> orange for his experiments. With Westinghouse's process, it would have cost $200,000 and taken a year to produce.|$|E

5|$|Great Britains {{builders}} recognised {{a number}} of advantages of iron over the traditional wooden hull. Wood was becoming more expensive, while iron was getting cheaper. Iron hulls were not subject to dry rot or woodworm, and they were also lighter in weight and less bulky. The chief advantage of the iron hull was its much greater structural strength. The practical limit {{on the length of}} a wooden-hulled ship is about 300feet, after which hogging—the flexing of the hull as waves pass beneath it—becomes too great. Iron hulls are far less subject to hogging, so that the potential <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> iron-hulled ship is much greater. The ship's designers, led by Brunel, were initially cautious in the adaptation of their plans to iron hulled-technology. With each successive draft however, the ship grew ever larger and bolder in conception. By the fifth draft, the vessel had grown to 3,400tons, over 1,000tons larger than any ship then in existence.|$|E
