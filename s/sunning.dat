5|$|Bee-eaters spend around 10% {{of their}} day on comfort activities. These include <b>sunning</b> themselves, dust bathing and water bathing. <b>Sunning</b> {{behaviour}} helps warm birds in the morning, reducing the need to use energy to raise their temperature. It also has a social aspect, as multiple birds adopt the same posture. Finally, it may help stimulate parasites in the feathers, making them easier to find and remove. Due to their hole-nesting lifestyle, bee-eaters accumulate a number of external parasites such as mites and flies. Together with <b>sunning,</b> bouts of dust bathing (or water bathing where available), as well as rigorous preening, keep the feathers and skin in good health. Bathing with water involves making shallow dives into a water body and then returning to a perch to preen.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the general}} effects of {{invasive}} animals {{is not as}} profound as plants, they are more noticeable in many instances and {{a constant reminder of}} the many exotic species in the region. A wildlife biologist and several construction workers near Homestead Air Force Base witnessed a scene where several iguanas <b>sunning</b> themselves in a canal were attacked by a spectacled caiman, to the surprise of all.|$|E
5|$|Other lemurs {{that do not}} exhibit {{dormancy}} conserve {{energy by}} selecting thermoregulated microhabitats (such as tree holes), sharing nests, and reducing exposed body surfaces, such as by hunched sitting and group huddling. Also, the ring-tailed lemur, ruffed lemurs, and sifakas are commonly seen <b>sunning,</b> thus using solar radiation to warm their bodies instead of metabolic heat.|$|E
5|$|String bikinis {{and other}} {{revealing}} clothes {{are common in}} surfing, though most surfing bikinis are more robust with more coverage than <b>sunning</b> bikinis. Surfing Magazine printed a pictorial of Kymberly Herrin, Playboy Playmate March 1981, surfing in a revealing bikini, and eventually started an annual bikini issue. The Association of Surfing Professionals often pairs female surf meets with bikini contests, an issue that divides the female pro-surfing community into two parts. It has often been more profitable to win the bikini contest than the female surfing event.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{have low}} basal {{metabolic}} rates (BMR), which helps them to conserve energy {{during the dry}} season, when water and food are scarce. They can optimize their energy use by lowering their metabolic rate to 20% below the values predicted for mammals of similar body mass. The red-tailed sportive lemur (Lepilemur ruficaudatus), for instance, reportedly {{has one of the}} lowest metabolic rates among mammals. Its low metabolic rate may be linked to its generally folivorous diet and relatively small body mass. Lemurs exhibit behavioral adaptations to complement this trait, including <b>sunning</b> behaviors, hunched sitting, group huddling, and nest sharing, in order to reduce heat loss and conserve energy. Dwarf lemurs and mouse lemurs exhibit seasonal cycles of dormancy to conserve energy. Before dry season, they will accumulate fat in white adipose tissue located {{at the base of the}} tail and hind legs, doubling their weight. At the end of the dry season, their body mass may fall to half of what it was prior to the dry season. Lemurs that do not experience states of dormancy are also able to shut down aspects of their metabolism for energy conservation.|$|E
25|$|Christie Islet and Pam Rocks {{just south}} of Anvil Island are {{recognized}} bird breeding sites and {{a great place to}} view seals <b>sunning</b> themselves. Pam Rocks is a reporting weather station for the marine weather system. Winter northerly gales can reach close to hurricane force here (see squamish wind).|$|E
25|$|Usually seen in {{the summer}} <b>sunning</b> {{themselves}} or crossing the road later in the day. The tiny rattle makes a buzzing sound {{that can only be}} heard from a few feet. Some individuals are very aggressive and will strike furiously, while others seem lethargic and do not even attempt to rattle. They do not dig their own burrows, but rather use those dug by small rodents or gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus).|$|E
25|$|The pool ranges {{in depth}} from four feet to depths of over eight feet near the grand waterfall, with a two-foot kiddy pool near the {{lifeguard}} station; {{the station is}} atop a bridge leading out to an island with two full size palm trees on it. A grotto, where natural water-filled caves stretch back over twelve feet into the hillside, is located across the pool from the island. There is a sandy <b>sunning</b> area for sunbathers and a café area that is commonly used for weddings and receptions. A walking path surrounds the whole complex.|$|E
25|$|The {{fireplace}} hearth in {{the living}} room integrates boulders found on the site and upon which the house was built— ledge rock which protrudes up to a foot through the living room floor was left in place to demonstrably link the outside with the inside. Wright had initially intended that the ledge be cut flush with the floor, but this {{had been one of the}} Kaufmann family's favorite <b>sunning</b> spots, so Mr. Kaufmann suggested that it be left as it was. The stone floors are waxed, while the hearth is left plain, giving the impression of dry rocks protruding from a stream.|$|E
25|$|Smaragd: The ripest wines {{that must}} contain at least 12.5% APV. The maximum {{residual}} sugar level for these wines is 9 g/l. This designation {{was first used}} in 1986, right after the diethylene glycol scandal and was intended to denote the highest quality level of Wachau wines. All grapes destined for this designation must attain at least 18.5°KMW and all finished wine must be sealed with a long natural cork that is at least 49mm long and branded with vintage year, since 2007 also screwcaps are allowed. The wines have to be aged in bottle and not released till after May 1 following harvest though some producers will age their inventory longer. Smaragd wines {{tend to be the}} most sought after and critically acclaimed Wachau wines with well made examples from favorable vintages having the potential to age for more than 20 years. The symbol for this class is an emerald lizard that can found <b>sunning</b> itself on the stone terraces along the Danube.|$|E
500|$|Drying: Drying {{is done to}} [...] "finish" [...] the tea for sale. This {{can be done in}} {{a myriad}} of ways {{including}} panning, <b>sunning,</b> air drying, or baking. Baking is usually the most common. Great care must be taken to not over-cook the leaves. The drying of the produced tea is responsible for many new flavour compounds particularly important in green teas.|$|E
500|$|In {{the mornings}} the ring-tailed lemur sunbathes to warm itself. It faces the sun sitting {{in what is}} {{frequently}} described as a [...] "sun-worshipping" [...] posture or lotus position. However, it sits with its legs extended outward, not cross-legged, and will often support itself on nearby branches. <b>Sunning</b> is often a group activity, particularly during the cold mornings. At night, troops will split into sleeping parties huddling closely together to keep warm.|$|E
500|$|Omaha was out patrolling with Memphis and Jouett on 6 February 1944, {{when the}} ships were given orders {{to be on}} the lookout for the {{survivors}} of a U-boat that had been sunk earlier in the day near their location. A yellow life raft was later spotted by Omahas lookouts. The occupants were German sailors that had survived the sinking of their boat, , that had been sunk by a Consolidated PB4Y-1 Liberator from Bombing Squadron (VB) 107 that was operating out of Ascension Island. U-177 had been sitting on the surface while some of the crew where <b>sunning</b> and swimming.|$|E
500|$|Congressman Theodore Burton {{had been}} elected as senator in Foraker's place in 1909, and {{announced}} that he would seek a second term in the 1914 elections. By this time, the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution had been ratified, giving the people the right to elect senators, and Ohio had instituted primary elections for the office. Foraker and former congressman Ralph D. Cole also entered the Republican primary. When Burton withdrew, Foraker became the favorite, but his Old Guard Republicanism was deemed outdated, and Harding was urged to enter the race. Daugherty claimed credit for persuading Harding to run, [...] "I found him like a turtle <b>sunning</b> himself on a log, and I pushed him into the water." [...] According to Harding biographer Randolph Downes, [...] "he put on a campaign of such sweetness and light as would have won the plaudits of the angels. It was calculated to offend nobody except Democrats." [...] Although Harding did not attack Foraker, his supporters had no such scruples. Harding won the primary by 12,000 votes over Foraker.|$|E

2500|$|... "Mok-qua Bennette was {{his real}} name. On {{the way to}} Beaver Bay in 1870 he spied a bear (named Mok-qua) <b>sunning</b> itself under a large spruce. Because of weather {{conditions}} - three feet of snow - {{it was impossible for}} the bear to move fast. The bear looked like good meat to the Indian who, unfortunately, didn't have a gun with him. He took a ten foot stick and attached a butcher knife to it thinking he would stab the bear to death. All he could do was tickle the bear. Seeing his method didn't work he cut a piece from a birch sapling with his tomahawk and tried to kill the bear by clubbing him to death. After the first blow he fell back while drawing away and got tangled in the limbs of the fallen tree. Mok-qua attacked the Indian, clawing his shoulder and arms. He did not bite him. The bear left the Indian who was unconscious. The Indian regained consciousness at night and when he did he was very sick and almost frozen. He somehow dragged himself to the farm of Jacob Hangarner who, after warming and feeding him, brough him to Beaver Bay. The Indian suffered more from exposure than from the attack." ...|$|E
