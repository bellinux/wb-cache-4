5000|$|The Hackworth {{valve gear}} is a design of valve gear used to {{regulate}} the flow of steam to the pistons in steam engines. It is a radial gear, with an actuating lever driven from the crank. The drive may be taken directly from the crank (top picture) or indirectly via a return crank (lower picture). The {{other end of the}} actuating lever is attached to a die block which slides in a <b>slotted</b> <b>link.</b> When the link is vertical, the engine is in mid-gear. Forward, reverse and cut-off adjustments are made by moving the link away from the vertical. The valve rod is pivoted to a point on the actuating lever.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1830s {{the most}} popular valve drive for {{locomotives}} was known as gab motion in the U.K. and V-hook motion in the U.S.A. The gab motion incorporated two sets of eccentrics and rods for each cylinder; one eccentric was set to give forward and the other backwards motion to the engine and {{one or the other}} could accordingly engage with a pin driving the distribution valve by means of the gabs: - vee-shaped ends to the eccentric rods supposed to catch the rocker driving the valve rod whatever its position. It was a clumsy mechanism, difficult to operate, and only gave fixed valve events. In 1841 two employees in Stephenson’s locomotive works, draughtsman William Howe and pattern-maker William Williams, suggested the simple expedient of replacing the gabs with a vertical <b>slotted</b> <b>link,</b> pivoted at both ends to the tips of the eccentric rods. To change direction, the link and rod ends were bodily raised or lowered by means of a counterbalanced bell crank worked by a reach rod that connected it to the reversing lever. This not only simplified reversing but it was realised that the gear could be raised or lowered in small increments, and thus the combined motion from the “forward” and “back” eccentrics in differing proportions would impart shorter travel to the valve, cutting off admission steam earlier in the stroke and using a smaller amount steam expansively in the cylinder, using its own energy rather than continuing to draw from the boiler. It became the practice to start the engine or climb gradients at long cutoff, usually about 70-80% maximum of the power stroke and to shorten the cutoff as momentum was gained to benefit from the economy of expansive working and the effect of increased lead and higher compression {{at the end of each}} stroke. This process was popularly known as [...] "linking up" [...] or “notching up”, the latter because the reversing lever could be held in precise positions by means of a catch on the lever engaging notches in a quadrant; the term stuck even after the introduction of the screw reverser. A further intrinsic advantage of the Stephenson gear not found in most other types was variable lead. Depending on how the gear was laid out, it was possible to considerably reduce compression and back pressure at the end of each piston stroke when working at low speed in full gear; once again as momentum was gained and cutoff shortened, so lead was automatically advanced and compression increased, cushioning the piston at the end of each stroke and heating the remaining trapped steam in order to avoid temperature drop in the fresh charge of incoming admission steam.|$|E
40|$|Disk plows {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} tillage tools. Two way (reversible) disk plows can perform continues plowing. So they can save time and costs and hence improve overall efficiency. In this study, a “two-way” disk plow was designed based on a λ-formed straight-line, four-bar linkage (Daniel mechanism). This design contains disk and rear wheel reversing mechanism, stabilization mechanism of the plow, a disk angle adjustment tool and transport condition for safe operation of the mechanism. Disk reversing mechanism was designed based on a geometrical analysis considering working condition of the disk plow. The suitable displacement of the plow’s frame was achieved by dimensional analysis of Daniel mechanism and a derived mathematical equation. The rear wheel mechanism was made by means of adding a <b>slotted</b> <b>link</b> to the previous four-bar linkage. The synthesized five-bar linkage was then analyzed for its kinematical and force conditions. For each analysis, related diagrams were plotted and discussed. This innovation has the advantages of low production cost and maintenance as well as easy operation, because of its design simplicity with minimum mechanical auxiliaries.

30|$|Several {{papers have}} {{addressed}} the problem of link scheduling to guarantee collision-free transmission. To deploy a link scheduling scheme in a WMN, the nodes must be synchronized and time must be divided into frames split into <b>slots.</b> <b>Link</b> scheduling schemes aim at selecting for each link in the network the slots in a frame during which the link is periodically activated while ensuring interference-free transmission and a maximum throughput in the network [14]. To avoid collisions, a link scheduling scheme should employ an interference model {{in order to establish}} which set of links can be activated simultaneously without causing any interference issue. The problem of link scheduling with the objective of maximizing the network throughput is known to be NP-hard, even with a simple interference model [12]. Thus, most existing works propose heuristic algorithms which produce close-to-optimal (sub-optimal) solutions. The efficiency of a sub-optimal algorithm is typically measured in terms of computational complexity (run time) and approximation factor (performance guarantee) [14]. Link scheduling schemes can be classified according to the interference model they are based on, which can be either a hop-based (e.g., [12, 19]), a distance-based (e.g., [20, 21]), or a SINR-based interference model (e.g., [10, 22 – 24]).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{traditional}} {{notion of}} instantiation in Object-Oriented Modeling (OOM) requires objects to be complete, i. e., be fully certain about their existence and attributes. This paper explores {{the notion of}} partial instantiation of class diagrams, which allows the modeler to omit some details of objects depending on modeler’s intention. Partial instantiation allows modelers to express optional existence of some objects and <b>slots</b> (<b>links)</b> as well as uncertainty of values in some slots. We show that partial instantiation is useful and natural in domain modeling and requirements engineering. It is equally useful in architecture modeling with uncertainty (for design exploration) and with variability (for modeling software product lines). Partial object diagrams can be (partially) completed by resolving (some of) optional objects and replacing (some of) unknown values with actual ones. Under the Closed World Assumption (CWA), completion reduces uncertainty of already existing objects, or deletes them if their existence is optional. Under the Open World Assumption (OWA), completion may additionally introduce new elements, perhaps uncertain. The paper presents a simple theory of partial instantiation and completion under the CWA. It shows that partial object diagrams can be modeled by subclassing and multiplicity constraints. As a result, class diagrams can implement partial instances with the well-known notions of subtyping and inheritance. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{physical}} link can be time-multiplexed {{to create}} several time slots, {{each of which}} corresponding to a virtual link.

30|$|In practice, the {{rechargeable}} {{wireless node}} {{is equipped with}} a harvester unit which transforms ambient signals into trickles of electrical energy. The energy buffer of the rechargeable node is often very limited in capacity due to the constraints of package size and cost. In addition, for some scenarios where the environmental energy is extremely low in output power, nodes have to use longer periods of time to recharge their energy buffer before they can carry out tasks. Therefore, it is often impossible for a node to quickly buffer much energy for longtime, continual operation. Combined with the challenge of co-channel interference, the constrained and intermittent energy provision motivates us to investigate efficient link scheduling in the context of recharging wireless networks, such that the network throughput can be improved by carefully assigning time <b>slots</b> for <b>links.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} problem of {{counting}} the number of nodes in a slotted-time communication network, under the challenging assumption that nodes do not have identifiers and the network topology changes frequently. That is, for each time <b>slot</b> <b>links</b> among nodes can change arbitrarily provided that the network is always connected. This network model has been motivated by the ongoing development of new communication technologies that enable the deployment of a massive number of devices with highly dynamic connectivity patterns. Tolerating dynamic topologies is clearly crucial in face of mobility and unreliable communication. Current communication networks do have node identifiers though. Nevertheless, in future massive networks, it might be suitable to avoid nodes IDs to facilitate mass production. Consequently, knowing what is the cost of anonymity is of paramount importance to understand what is feasible or not for future generations of Dynamic Networks. Counting is a fundamental task in distributed computing since knowing the size of the system often facilitates the desing of solutions for more complex problems. Also, the size of the system is usually used to decide termination in distributed algorithms. Currently, the best upper bound proved on the running time to compute the exact network size is double-exponential. However, only linear complexity lower bounds are known, leaving open the question of whether efficient Counting protocols for Anonymous Dynamic Networks exist or not. In this paper we make a significant step towards answering this question by presenting a distributed Counting protocol for Anonymous Dynamic Networks which has exponential time complexity. This algorithm, which we call Incremental Counting, ensures that eventually every node knows the exact size of the system and stops executing the protocol. Previous Counting protocols have either double-exponential time complexity, or they are exponential but do not terminate, or terminate but do not provide running-time guarantees, or guarantee only an exponential upper bound on the network size. Other protocols are heuristic and do not guarantee the correct count...|$|R
