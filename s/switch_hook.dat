500|$|The {{gameplay}} of Oracle of Seasons and Ages {{is similar}} to that of , copying basic controls, graphics, and sounds from the Game Boy title. Like most The Legend of Zelda titles, exploration and combat take place from an overhead perspective. Link uses a sword for his primary attack, complemented by secondary weapons and items. Basic items, such as bombs and a boomerang, are common to both games. Some new items are exclusive to one game, usually with a counterpart in the other, with similar uses (e.g. the slingshot in Seasons and the seed shooter in Ages both shoot seeds, while the magnetic gloves in Seasons and the <b>switch</b> <b>hook</b> in Ages are used to access otherwise unreachable areas via special targets). [...] Unlike most Zelda titles, a sword and shield is not always equipped when the player possesses them; they can be assigned like any other item into either of two available slots. Most of each of the games is spent finding the eight Essences (Essences of Nature in Seasons and Essences of Time in Ages), each hidden in a dungeon—a large, usually underground, area containing enemies and puzzles. Each dungeon culminates with a boss that guards the Essence.|$|E
50|$|As {{pulse dialing}} is {{achieved}} by interruption of the local loop, it was in principle possible to dial a telephone number by rapidly tapping, i.e. depressing, the <b>switch</b> <b>hook</b> the corresponding number of times for each digit at approximately ten taps per second. However, many telephone makers implemented a slow <b>switch</b> <b>hook</b> release to prevent rapid switching.|$|E
50|$|Most recognizable, candlesticks {{featured}} a base with a vertical cylindrical neck extending upright {{for up to}} 10 in in length. At {{the top of the}} stand was mounted a carbon microphone (transmitter) to speak into, and a <b>switch</b> <b>hook</b> extending sideways upon which an ear piece (receiver) was hung. In order to make or answer a telephone call, the user lifted the receiver off the <b>switch</b> <b>hook,</b> thereby activating an internal switch connecting the telephone to the telephone line.|$|E
5000|$|During the {{development}} of the [...]NET Framework 2.0, Microsoft extended the design of the Common Language Runtime (CLR) hosting APIs to handle fiber-based scheduling with an eye towards its use in fiber-mode for SQL server. Before release, support for the task <b>switching</b> <b>hook</b> ICLRTask::SwitchOut was removed due to time constraints.Consequently, the use of the fiber API to switch tasks is currently not a viable option in the [...]NET Framework.|$|R
50|$|During {{the early}} days of telephones, in the UK, a variety of {{instruments}} were produced, in low volume, often combining new and emerging technologies with the traditional skills of the wood joiner and cabinetmaker. They were simply known as Type 1, 2, 3 etc. These were often used on simple, internal links, sometimes taking the place of the 'speaking tube' in large houses. These instrument had no dials, and signalling consisted of a hand-cranked magneto generator. Often the bell at the other end would just be 'tinkled' by simply rattling the <b>switch</b> <b>hooks</b> up and down.From these developed the first, serious, GPO instruments, the 100 series. This comprised a wall phone, the Tele. 121 and a desk phone, the Tele 150.|$|R
50|$|An {{electronic}} <b>hook</b> <b>switch</b> is {{a device}} which electronically connects a wireless headset and phone. An EHS passes predefined signalling. Either bluetooth headset or DECT headset can be used.|$|R
50|$|The {{use of a}} handset lifter is {{considered}} archaic by most technical professionals. Technology from decades ago eliminated {{the need for such}} device, however many phones, including modern IP phones, still do not have discrete circuitry for <b>switch</b> <b>hook</b> operation.|$|E
50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{it used to}} be {{possible}} to make calls from coin-box phones (payphones) by tapping the <b>switch</b> <b>hook</b> without depositing coins. A person caught tapping could be charged with 'abstracting electricity' from the General Post Office and several cases were prosecuted under this offence.|$|E
50|$|Some phones {{only have}} a {{mechanical}} means of <b>switch</b> <b>hook</b> operation. The lifter allows cordless headsets to be used remotely with such phones. The phone user presses the appropriate headset button to either answer a call or terminate a call. The headset's base station's interface with the handset lifter will take the appropriate action - lift or replace the handset.|$|E
50|$|North Electric {{introduced}} a touch-tone {{version of the}} Ericofon in the United States in 1967. Production of this variant was much {{lower than that of}} the rotary-dial Ericofons. A design flaw in the <b>hook</b> <b>switch</b> mechanism can cause the touch-tone version of the phone to become unusable if it is set down too forcibly. North Electric ceased production of the Ericofon for North America in 1972.|$|R
50|$|Seating {{capacity}} {{remains at}} five. According to Nissan designers, {{the interior is}} inspired by the 'enveloping curves of a jacuzzi to promote a comfortable and social atmosphere.' Design cues include a water ripple motif that appears in the headliner and is repeated in details like the speaker covers and cup holders. Nissan has developed an extended line of accessories for Cube to encourage personalization. These include multicolor appliqués that can be placed around air vents and window <b>switches,</b> utility <b>hooks</b> and elastic bands in different colors, variable color LED accent lighting for the footwell and cup holders, and a sculptured piece of color-coordinated shag carpet that sits in a shallow well {{on the top of}} the dash.|$|R

50|$|Possibly one of {{the first}} {{phreaking}} methods was switch-hooking, which allows placing calls from a phone where the rotary dial or keypad has been disabled by a key lock or other means to prevent unauthorized calls from that phone. It is done by rapidly pressing and releasing the <b>switch</b> <b>hook</b> to open and close the subscriber circuit, simulating the pulses generated by the rotary dial. Even most current telephone exchanges support this method, as they need to be backward compatible with old subscriber hardware.|$|E
50|$|The phone {{consisted}} of a rotary dial, a handset cradle, <b>switch</b> <b>hook,</b> and a handset (sometimes called the receiver) wired to the base, and was constructed of a molded plastic housing covering a steel chassis. The user interface {{consisted of}} only the dial and <b>switch</b> <b>hook</b> buttons. No other components, switches, or controls were necessary, {{with the exception of}} a loudness control for the ringer, which was accessible on the bottom of the phone. The handset cradle was a molded part of the housing, formed of two U-shaped chairs which cradled the handle of the handset between the receiver and the transmitter cups. Each side of the cradle had a round plastic plunger positioned above a pair of levers connected in a spring-loaded yoke that operated the hook switch; pressing the plungers down ended the call and placed the phone on-hook. The plastic face of the dial under and surrounding the finger wheel was an integral part of the dial assembly and was exposed through a large circular opening in the housing. On the bottom, the flat steel plate of the chassis was exposed. The handset cord exited from the left side of the housing at the base, and the line cord emerged from the rear at the base.|$|E
50|$|The {{candlestick}} telephone is a {{style of}} telephone that was common from the late 1890s to the 1940s. A candlestick telephone is also {{often referred to as}} a desk stand, an upright, or a stick phone. Candlestick telephones featured a mouth piece (transmitter) mounted {{at the top of the}} stand, and a receiver (ear phone) that was held by the user to the ear during a call. When the telephone was not in use, the receiver rested in the fork of the <b>switch</b> <b>hook</b> protruding to the side of the stand, thereby disconnecting the audio circuit from the telephone network.|$|E
50|$|The model 102 {{telephone}} {{consisted of}} the handset mounting typically placed on the desk top and a physically separate desk set box or subscriber set. This box was typically {{mounted on a wall}} near the phone or {{on the side of a}} desk. The desk set contained only the dial, a handset cradle with <b>hook</b> <b>switch,</b> and the handset positioned in the cradle, while the subscriber set contained the ringer and the electrical components to interface the unit with the telephone network.|$|R
50|$|The model 302 {{is built}} upon a {{rectangular}} steel base plate on which are mounted the ringer unit, the induction coil, a metal can containing two capacitors, and a connector terminal plate. The base {{was supported by}} four felt- or leather-covered triangular feet attached under each corner. The housing sat {{on top of the}} base, secured with screws, and contained the rotary dial and the <b>hook</b> <b>switch,</b> which was activated with two plunger rods in the handset cradle by removing or replacing the handset.|$|R
40|$|The {{bacterial}} flagellum {{consists of}} a long external filament connected to a membrane-embedded basal body at the cell surface by a short curved structure called the hook. In Salmonella enterica, the hook extends 55 nm from the cell surface. FliK, a secreted molecular ruler, controls hook length. Upon hook completion, FliK induces a secretion-specificity switch to filament-type substrate secretion. Here, we demonstrate that an infrequent ruler mechanism determines hook length. FliK is intermittently secreted during hook polymerization. The probability of the specificity switch is an increasing function of hook length. By uncoupling hook polymerization from FliK expression, we illustrate that FliK secretion immediately triggers the specificity <b>switch</b> in <b>hooks</b> greater than the physiological length. The experimental data display excellent agreement with a mathematical model of the infrequent ruler hypothesis. Merodiploid bacteria expressing simultaneously short and long ruler variants displayed hook-length control by the short ruler, further supporting the infrequent ruler model. Finally, the velocity of FliK secretion determines {{the probability of a}} productive FliK interaction with the secretion apparatus to change secretion substrate specificity...|$|R
50|$|Both {{were based}} {{around the same}} handmade, wooden case, {{containing}} the telephone circuit and bell, but unlike the bellset, shown with the Tele 150, below, the Tele 121 had the transmitter mouthpiece screwed onto {{the front of the}} box and the <b>switch</b> <b>hook,</b> holding the receiver, protruding from the left hand side. Below the mouthpiece was a dial-mount, which either contained a dial(L) or a blanking plate (CB). This made it a true, one-piece telephone which was available either 'stand alone', mounted on a handsome, wooden, back-board, with integral writing desk or, as a Tele. 123, combined with the original, Button A & B coin-box.|$|E
5000|$|When a call is received, a jack lamp {{lights on}} the back panel and the {{operator}} responds by placing the rear cord into the corresponding jack and throwing the front key forward. The operator then converses with the caller, who informs the operator to whom {{he or she would}} like to speak. If it is another extension, the operator places the front cord in the associated jack and pulls the front key backwards to ring the called party. After connecting, the operator leaves both cords [...] "up" [...] with the keys in the normal position so the parties can converse. The supervision lamps light to alert the operator when the parties finish their conversation and go on-hook. Either party could [...] "flash" [...] the operator's supervision lamps by depressing their <b>switch</b> <b>hook</b> for a second and releasing it, in case they needed assistance with a problem. When the operator pulls down a cord, a pulley weight behind the switchboard pulls it down to prevent it from tangling.|$|E

40|$|The {{expression}} of flagellin in Salmonella typhimurium is coupled to {{the assembly of}} complete flagella. Mutations which disrupt this coupling define a gene, flgM, which represses the {{expression of}} the flagellin genes in strains with mutations in the basal body, <b>switch,</b> or <b>hook</b> flagellar gene (K. L. Gillen and K. T. Hughes, J. Bacteriol. 173 : 2301 - 2310, 1991). Complementation studies demonstrated that the flgM gene is contained within a 600 -bp cloned DNA fragment. Sequence analysis revealed that this fragment carries a small open reading frame corresponding to a 97 -amino-acid protein. The FlgM protein observed in a T 7 -mediated expression system showed an apparent molecular mass of 9. 5 kDa, similar to the predicted size of 10. 6 kDa. Upstream of the flgM coding region is a putative promoter sequence which shows strong homology to that thought to be recognized by the flagellin-specific sigma factor (FliA). Consistent with the use of this promoter in vivo, promoter mapping by primer extension demonstrated a transcriptional start site 11 bases downstream {{from the center of the}} putative - 10 promoter element, which was dependent on functional FliA for full expression...|$|R
50|$|The Western Electric model 500 {{improved}} upon several {{design features}} over the earlier telephones. While the 302 had the dial and <b>hook</b> <b>switch</b> mounted {{directly on the}} metal or plastic housing, all operational parts of the 500 telephone were mounted on the base plate, and the housing only contained two plungers to activate the <b>hook</b> <b>switch</b> when the handset was lifted from the cradle. Thus, the phone could be tested and serviced easily without the housing. This design improved manufacturing and servicing efficiency. The earlier 302 had been equipped with an enamel-coated dial plate that displayed the numerals and letters through the holes of the rotary finger-wheel. Years of use caused the lettering and numbering, and even the porcelain coating, to wear off. The design of the 500 improved this by molding the characters into the plastic, through a double-injection molding process. This design was carried over to the 1500 and 2500-series telephones and {{was used in the}} touch-tone keys to eliminate wear. The numbers and letters on the 500 were moved to the circumference of the dial plate to make them clearly visible {{from a wide range of}} viewing angles even while the dial was spinning back to its resting position, and dots were placed in the center of the finger holes as targets to help position the finger quicker for dialing of the next digit while the wheel was still spinning back. After extensive testing, this arrangement had the benefit of reducing the rate of dialing errors, and increased the speed of dialing each digit by fractions of a second. The 500 series replaced many metal parts, especially in the dial, with much more durable Nylon components.|$|R
25|$|At the time, modems {{generally}} came in two versions, {{one for the}} end-user {{that required}} the user to dial the phone manually and use an acoustic coupler for connection, and another dedicated to answering incoming calls that was intended for use on the minicomputer or mainframe the user was calling into. The connection and disconnection was entirely manual, with the user picking up the phone's handset, dialing manually, and then pressing the handset into the coupler if a carrier frequency was heard. Disconnecting {{at the end of}} the session was also manual, with the user lifting the handset out of the coupler and hanging it up on the phone body in order to depress the <b>hook</b> <b>switch</b> and return the phone to the on-hook state and end the call.|$|R
50|$|The 100 series, 'candlestick' two-piece {{telephone}} {{is now a}} collectible item. This one is a Tele. 150L circa 1929 and is a poor example {{since the}} original black finish has been stripped to reveal the brass. The bell receiver was originally coated in a black vulcanised rubber (Vulcanite) and the remaining brass work had a black oxide finish. The dial is also later, the original number 10 dial would also have been finished in black oxide on copper. The L denotes an alphanumeric (rather than number only) dial plate. The dial uses a slipping cam Rotary dial, as distinct from the CB (central battery) version, which was without any dial and relied entirely upon connection via the operator. The transmitter (microphone) was of a very poor, carbon granule construction, which absorbed moisture and required regular replacement. The low cost, however, ensured that this transmitter {{would continue to be}} used for many years to come. In contrast, the twin coil and diaphragm receiver was of very good quality, indeed.The Tele. 150, like its successor the Tele. 162, was actually only the 'front end' of the telephone. Containing only the transmitter, receiver and <b>switch</b> <b>hook</b> assembly; the entire electrical telephone circuitry was contained within an accompanying magneto bell set. This was initially the wooden cased version shown or the later, compact, Bakelite, Bell set 25.|$|E
50|$|The 5302 {{essentially}} was a 302 telephone {{under a new}} cover. The new {{shell design}} {{was based on the}} 500 design and accommodated the front-to-back shorter model 302 base. As the model 302 had the dial and <b>hook</b> <b>switch</b> mounted on the phone shell, the 5302 accommodated that design, in contrast to the model 500, which had all components mounted on the phone base. Like the 500, the dial also displayed the numbers and letters {{on the outside of the}} finger dial, however, the dial itself was actually the smaller 5H dial from the model 302, relabeled as 5M, or one of newer 6-series dials (6H). The 5300 type telephone housings were also produced in small quantities in the pastel colors blue, pink, beige, and white, when these became available in ca. 1958.|$|R
50|$|What {{turned out}} to be the most popular and longest lasting {{physical}} style of telephone was introduced in the early 20th century, including Bell's model 102 telephone. A carbon granule transmitter and electromagnetic receiver were united in a single molded plastic handle, which when not in use were placed in a cradle in the base unit. The circuit diagram of the model 102 shows the direct connection of the receiver to the line, while the transmitter was induction coupled, with energy supplied by a local battery. The coupling transformer, battery, and ringer were in a separate enclosure from the desk set. The rotary dial in the base interrupted the line current by repeatedly but very briefly disconnecting the line 1 to 10 times for each digit, and the <b>hook</b> <b>switch</b> (in the center of the circuit diagram) permanently disconnected the line and the transmitter battery while the handset was on the cradle.|$|R

The circuit diagram of the model 202 shows the direct connection of the transmitter to the line, while the receiver was induction coupled. In local battery configurations, when the local loop was too long to provide sufficient current from the exchange, the transmitter was powered by a local battery and inductively coupled, while the receiver was included in the local loop. The coupling transformer and the ringer were mounted in a separate enclosure, called the subscriber set. The dial switch in the base interrupted the line current by repeatedly but very briefly disconnecting the line 1 to 10 times for each digit, and the <b>hook</b> <b>switch</b> (in the center of the circuit diagram) disconnected the line and the transmitter battery while the handset was on the cradle.|$|R
40|$|Pathogenic Yersinia species {{employ a}} type III {{secretion}} system (TTSS) to target antihost factors, Yop proteins, into eukaryotic cells. The secretion machinery is constituted of ca. 20 Ysc proteins, nine of which show significant homology to {{components of the}} flagellar TTSS. A key event in flagellar assembly is the <b>switch</b> from secreting-assembling <b>hook</b> substrates to filament substrates, a switch regulated by FlhB and FliK. The focus {{of this study is}} the FlhB homologue YscU, a bacterial inner membrane protein with a large cytoplasmic C-terminal domain. Our results demonstrate that low levels of YscU were required for functional Yop secretion, whereas higher levels of YscU lowered both Yop secretion and expression. Like FlhB, YscU was cleaved into a 30 -kDa N-terminal and a 10 -kDa C-terminal part. Expression of the latter in a wild-type strain resulted in elevated Yop secretion. The site of cleavage was at a proline residue, within the strictly conserved amino acid sequence NPTH. A YscU protein with an in-frame deletion of NPTH was cleaved at a different position and was nonfunctional with respect to Yop secretion. Variants of YscU with single substitutions in the conserved NPTH sequence—i. e., N 263 A, P 264 A, or T 265 A—were not cleaved but retained function in Yop secretion. Elevated expression of these YscU variants did, however, result in severe growth inhibition. From this we conclude that YscU cleavage is not a prerequisite for Yop secretion but is rather required to maintain a nontoxic fold...|$|R
