2500|$|The Belphégor had {{its origins}} during World War II in Marcel Roca's SNCAC NC.3020 design, an {{ultimately}} unbuilt aircraft {{powered by a}} coupled pair of Hispano-Suiza HS.12Z engines mounted {{side by side in}} the nose driving coaxial propellers. [...] When work on the design resumed at the war's end these engines were replaced with a similarly arranged Daimler-Benz pair, resulting in a revised type, the NC.3021. The Belphégor was intended to provide a high altitude laboratory for studies of the meteorology of the upper atmosphere, high altitude aerodynamics and also of incoming cosmic rays. The measurements were to be made at altitudes between [...] and [...] [...] The pressurization system was fed from a large <b>scoop</b> <b>intake</b> below the engine into engine driven compressors. The pressurized cabin, slightly wider than high had an average diameter of about [...] allowing the two observers comfortable working room and a total cabin volume of [...] They had observation windows in the cabin roof and in its floor. The crew positions were also in the pressurized region: the pilot's cockpit placed his head above the upper fuselage under a clear canopy. Two other crew, navigator and radio operator sat wholly within the cabin.|$|E

50|$|There are 3 major {{styles of}} underglow LED lights: pod style led lights, LED strips and {{flexible}} LED tubes. LED pod {{consists of a}} rigid housing, bunch of led lights and a lens. LED strips are easy to install almost everywhere, including engine bays or air <b>intake</b> <b>scoops.</b> LED tubes put out steady light that resembles classic neon glow.|$|R
5000|$|After a {{crash in}} Scotland {{involving}} [...] "an internationally famous racing champ", a Zonda S owned by Scottish gas industry tycoon Gareth Jones {{was sent to}} the Pagani factory and became the one-off custom built Zonda GJ. It was finished in matte carbon and received a front wing upgrade and <b>intake</b> <b>scoops</b> located on the rear wheel arches, as well as several other features taken from the Cinque and F models.|$|R
50|$|Some DXs {{have been}} further modified, to operate through the over 8.5 km long and steeply graded Otira Tunnel on the South Island. The air intakes of these {{locomotives}} were remounted outside the locomotive body, and {{fitted with a}} downward heading <b>intake</b> <b>scoop,</b> {{to prevent them from}} drawing in exhaust gases accumulating at the tunnel's ceiling. The image at the top right of this article is of locomotives belonging to this variant, known as the DXC sub class.|$|R
5000|$|The 1959 Chevrolet Impala was redesigned. Sharing bodyshells with lower-end Buicks and Oldsmobiles {{as well as}} with Pontiac, part of a GM economy move, the Chevrolet's {{wheelbase}} 1-1/2 inches longer. Using a new X-frame chassis, {{the roof}} line was three inches lower, bodies were two inches wider, and curb weight increased. Its tailfins protruded outward, rather than upward. The taillights were a large [...] "teardrop" [...] design at each side, and two slim-wide nonfunctional front air <b>intake</b> <b>scoops</b> were added just above the grille, ...|$|R
50|$|The Douglas DC-6 fleet {{had been}} {{grounded}} by Civil Aviation authorities {{for four months}} during the previous winter {{as a result of}} the fatal crash of United Airlines Flight 608 on October 24, 1947. It was determined that the crash had been caused by a design flaw that allowed vented fuel to be drawn into the heater air <b>intake</b> <b>scoop</b> that caused a fire in the cargo compartment. As a result, changes were made and a fire extinguisher system was installed on all DC-6 aircraft, including the accident aircraft.|$|R
25|$|The {{production}} {{versions of}} the Friskysport and Frisky Coupe were very similar and used identical chassis, but there are differences to the bodywork. Early {{versions of the}} Friskysport are fitted with a separate chrome Reliant Sabre windscreen frame, they have a detachable tail section and dummy air <b>intake</b> <b>scoops</b> just behind the doors whilst later cars have the same lower body as the Coupe. The Friskysport has overriders, whilst the Coupe has plain bumpers. The Coupe initially used the Friskysport body with an integral, glassed-on roof and steel framed front windscreen, until the Family Three one-piece body became available in 1959, which was then used for both cars.|$|R
2500|$|The {{differences}} from other road-going Zondas were the new 6-speed sequential gearbox, resulting in shifts taking less than 100 milliseconds, dropping 0–62mph down to 3.4 seconds. The Cinque {{also had a}} revised form of carbon fibre called [...] "carbo-titanium" [...] which incorporated titanium to increase strength and rigidity. The suspension used magnesium and titanium components, and the 7.3L-engine's power and torque were increased to [...] and [...] Revised bodywork, which included a longer front splitter, new sideskirts, rear diffuser, bumper canards, and a flatter underside {{as well as a}} roof-mounted air <b>intake</b> <b>scoop,</b> enabled the Cinque to create [...] of down-force at [...] and 1.45 G of cornering force.|$|R
50|$|The {{cause of}} both the Bryce Canyon crash and the near-fatal Gallup {{incident}} was eventually traced to a design flaw. A cabin heater <b>intake</b> <b>scoop</b> was positioned {{too close to the}} number 3 alternate tank air vent. If flightcrews allowed a tank to be overfilled during a routine fuel transfer between wing tanks, it could lead to several gallons of excess fuel flowing out of the tank vent and then being sucked into the cabin heater system, which then ignited the fuel. This caused the fire which destroyed the United aircraft at Bryce Canyon and severely damaged the American aircraft that landed in flames at Gallup.|$|R

Revised bodywork, which included a longer front splitter, new sideskirts, rear diffuser, bumper canards, and a flatter underside {{as well as a}} roof-mounted air <b>intake</b> <b>scoop,</b> enabled the Cinque to create 750 kg of down-force at 355 km/h and 1.45 G of cornering force.|$|R
5000|$|For 1969, the 7s were {{evolved in}} order to adapt to {{problems}} on the original cars. The bodywork was completely redesigned, shaped similar to a large broad wedge for increased front downforce. For {{the rear of the}} car, the exhaust pipes were placed within the bodywork, while an <b>intake</b> <b>scoop</b> was mounted over the rollbar. These new 7s were referred to internally as the 474S, while press material referred to it as the New 7. [...] The revised New 7s continued to show their potential, winning the 1000 km Suzuka once again. [...] For the New 7s main event, the Japanese Grand Prix, Nissan arrived with their revised R382s. Although Toyota was able to outperform Porsche, including a factory-run squad in a new 917, the Nissans once again proved too daunting, taking the top two spots by a lap over the Toyota.|$|R
5000|$|The 2002 {{model was}} updated with 140 changes. While {{some of those}} changes made the bike easier to launch, with a heavier crank and a {{reshaped}} flywheel and fuel mapping tweaks. It also lost 1.3 horsepower because of this vs. the 2000 and 2001 model. Revised suspension composed of stiffer springs in the forks and a softer spring on the shock. Cosmetic changes include sportier front fender and panels added to the inner fairing below the instruments and bars to make a more refined look. A massive ram-air <b>intake</b> <b>scoop</b> centrally located, protrudes from the fairing {{to take advantage of}} the higher air pressure, revised to be even more efficient. Because of this improvement it got back the 1.3 horsepower loss to keep its [...] at high speed with ram-air intake. Kawasaki have always been the master of ram-air as stated by MCNews.com.au. This intake is integrated into a wider and shorter front cowling which causes less drag on its aerodynamics from a jet aircraft, lowering the drag coefficient by one point from 33 to 32. [...] The 2004 model got the addition of radial brakes and more fuel injection tweaks. The ZX-12R was discontinued in 2006 and followed by the ZX-14 (ZZR1400) the same year, also with a similar monocoque frame.|$|R
