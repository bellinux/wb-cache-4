50|$|<b>Seized</b> <b>items</b> {{that had}} been {{returned}} included {{hundreds of thousands of}} rounds of ammunition, numerous weapons and other material, but several items including illegal weapons taken as evidence had been destroyed by the Justice Department rather than returned to the acquitted Hutaree members.|$|R
2500|$|The {{agency will}} also <b>seize</b> <b>items</b> it labels obscene, {{as it did}} in February 2009 when it {{detained}} and banned two films by the adult film director Michael Lucas. The CBSA's Policy On The Classification Of Obscene Material states that the [...] "ingestion of someone else's urine... with a sexual purpose" [...] makes a film obscene.|$|R

5000|$|Marshall's dissent, at Reidel, {{distinguished}} {{that case}} from Thirty-seven Photographs {{by noting that}} the delivery of obscene material via the mail presented the hazard that children or unwilling recipients would be exposed to it, which the state {{had an interest in}} preventing, whereas only Luros would be exposed to the photographs. [...] "The <b>seized</b> <b>items</b> were then in his purely private possession and threatened neither children nor anyone else.|$|R

50|$|The {{court held}} that the first warrant {{authorized}} a search of a certain farm, and not of the applicant's house, which was on an entirely different property. Accordingly, the search of her house had been unauthorized and unlawful, as had been the seizure of her property. Moreover, hardly any of the property seized had been specified in the warrant. In consequence, the applicant was entitled to the return of all the <b>seized</b> <b>items.</b>|$|R

50|$|In January 1963, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{ordered a}} raid against the Academy's 19th Street location, seizing more than 100 e-meters (electronic devices used by Scientologists) and 200 pieces of literature. The raid {{resulted}} in {{a lawsuit filed by}} the FDA against the Founding Church. In 1971, the Church and FDA reached a settlement which included a ruling that all e-meters bear a prominent warning label. The <b>seized</b> <b>items</b> were returned to the Founding Church in October 1973.|$|R
50|$|In Magajane v Chairperson, North West Gambling Board, an {{important}} case in South African criminal procedure, Magajane sought {{leave to appeal}} against the dismissal of his constitutional challenge to the provisions of section 65 of the North West Gambling Act. This challenge {{was on the ground}} that the provision violated his right to privacy by authorising inspectors to search his commercial premises and to <b>seize</b> <b>items</b> without a warrant. While the section authorised inspections of both licensed and unlicensed premises, he confined his challenge to inspections of unlicensed premises.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} hours of 1 May 2012 about 800 police {{officers}} raided 26 properties, arresting 20 people on a variety of charges. They were confirmed by Macedonian Interior Minister Gordana Jankuloska as Islamic fundamentalists, some of whom had fought in Pakistan and Afghanistan. The arrests took place in the villages of Šuto Orizari, Jaja Paša and Aračinovo, and weapons were found in the residences of the suspects. Also, among the <b>seized</b> <b>items,</b> National Liberation Army propraganda was present. The police used surveillance and phone tapping during the operation.|$|R
5000|$|According to the IDF, {{the ship}} {{picked up the}} cargo in Damietta, Egypt; the cargo arrived in Egypt on a ship that sailed from Bandar Abbas, Iran on October 25. [...] The ship was then set to sail to Limassol, Cyprus and then Latakia, Syria. [...] The IDF {{suspects}} that the cargo was intended for Hezbollah, which fought Israel in the 2006 Lebanon War. Following the war, United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 forbade the shipments of arms to Hezbollah. In 2010, the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1929 authorized states to <b>seize</b> <b>items,</b> including arms, that Iran is forbidden from exporting.|$|R
50|$|Also {{among the}} <b>seized</b> <b>items</b> was {{an array of}} Stanford's private documents, {{insurance}} policies, personal correspondence, and even his marriage certificate. Due to this fact, {{and the fact that}} the investigation had yielded no evidence of criminal activity, Stanford filed a motion with the magistrate who had issued the warrant, requesting that the warrant be annulled and his property be returned. After a hearing, Stanford's motion was denied without further comment from the court. By statute, the decision of the local court was final on this matter, leaving only the supreme court as an avenue of appeal. The court granted certiorari and heard arguments on November 12, 1964.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with the}} posters and paperwork, {{a large amount}} of {{contraband}} items were also located in Knight's cell, such as blades, sharpened knives, articles associated with the Ku Klux Klan and the Nazi Party, magazines, book and articles on weapons and war, medication bottles, a leather belt, two television remote controls, an extension lead, a can opener, bale hooks, permanent markers, computer disks - many containing information relating to prison security and staff, pornographic material, sandpaper, masking tape, prison manuals, staff pictures, T.A.B. betting information, and prison and staff rosters. Knight's application was dismissed, even though many of the <b>seized</b> <b>items</b> were returned to him.|$|R
25|$|Part of {{the raid}} was {{broadcast}} live before officials disabled the transmitters. Dutch nationals {{were arrested and}} returned to the Netherlands, together with most of the broadcasting equipment. Non-Dutch staff were given the option of staying on the ship or returning to the Netherlands – most chose to stay on board. Caroline claimed boarding the ship and removal or destruction of equipment was piracy. The Dutch claimed the ship's Panamanian registration had lapsed in 1987 and it was not under legal protection from any country and that its transmissions breached international regulations which since 1982 had prohibited broadcasting from outside national territories. Several years later some of the <b>seized</b> <b>items</b> were returned to the station.|$|R
50|$|In early 1772, Lieutenant William Dudingston sailed HMS Gaspee into Rhode Island's Narragansett Bay {{to enforce}} customs {{collection}} and mandatory inspection of cargo. Rhode Island had {{gained a reputation}} for smuggling and trading with the French during the previous war. Dudingston arrived in Rhode Island in February and met with Governor Joseph Wanton, {{but he did not}} find the governor to be overly helpful. Soon after he began patrolling Narragansett Bay, Gaspee stopped and inspected the sloop Fortune on February 17 and seized twelve hogsheads of undeclared rum. Dudingston sent Fortune and the seized rum to Boston, believing that any <b>seized</b> <b>items</b> left in a Rhode Island port would be reclaimed by colonists.|$|R

5000|$|A {{new lead}} was {{discovered}} as of September 20, 2014. The police searched {{the woods of}} Thaxton, Virginia and entered a house in Hyattsville, Maryland, <b>seizing</b> several <b>items.</b> These searches were relevant to the new suspect named Lloyd Welch and his relatives.|$|R
50|$|His {{collection}} was looted by the Nazis during the Second World War and, according to German records, 2687 <b>items</b> <b>seized.</b>|$|R
25|$|At the scene, {{the police}} took Aldrete, De León, Orea Ochoa, Juan Carlos Fragoso, and Jorge Montes into custody. The police also arrested María de Lourdes Güero López and María del Rocío Cuevas Guerra, other cultists under Constanzo, in Mexico City later that day. They were renting one of Constanzo's apartments. The {{individuals}} arrested that day were held for homicide, criminal association, wounding an officer, and damage to property. Fearing that Constanzo might have purposely faked his own death, investigators conducted fingerprint analysis. They {{concluded that the}} corpse was indeed Constanzo's. Constanzo's 9mm Uzi submachine gun and his supposed suitcase were never formally presented by the police as <b>seized</b> <b>items.</b> On May 15, a judge refused to set bail for them because they were wanted for crimes accumulating over 50 years in prison.|$|R
5000|$|What {{began in}} September 2003, {{concluded}} with a massive crackdown in March 2005 near the coast of Marbella, Spain. Authorities estimate over €250 million has been recovered, and among the <b>seized</b> <b>items</b> are: 42 luxury cars, a yacht, 2 planes, paintings, and other luxury items. Spanish, French, Finnish, Russian and Ukrainian nationals were among the 41 apprehended.In 2006 the investigation spread, to consider allegations of bribery in the Marbella council. Specifically, it appears that developers were being asked to pay for planning permission, and that permission was granted outside the remit of the local plan (e.g. residential development on non residentially zoned land). Mayor Marisol Yague, planning supremo Juan Antonio Roca, and others were arrested, including almost two thirds of councillors. Heads of construction companies and real estate agencies were also arrested.|$|R
50|$|A copy of {{this book}} was among the <b>items</b> <b>seized</b> as {{evidence}} from Bruce Ivins in an FBI raid investigating the 2001 anthrax attacks.|$|R
5000|$|As in most {{developing}} countries, {{intellectual property}} protection in Senegal is weak. Copyright infringement is not {{regarded as a}} crime, and it is widely accepted by consumers. Senegal’s criminal law provisions do not provide for criminal procedures in case of trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy on a commercial scale. In addition, because of budget constraints, Senegal’s Copyright Office has had difficulty enforcing sanctions against individuals who infringe copyrights {{in the course of}} business, including hackers and distributors of infringed copies. Nonetheless, the Copyright Office has begun vigorous attempts against counterfeit media, <b>seizing</b> <b>items</b> as well as putting stickers on legal merchandise. It is currently continuing these enforcement efforts. Microsoft began an anti-piracy campaign in Senegal in early 2004 and reports some success in converting users of pirated Microsoft products through the sale of deeply discounted Microsoft licenses.|$|R
50|$|The UK {{is still}} the only Member State of the European Union that prohibits private imports of adult {{pornography}} by consumers coming from other Member States of the European Union. In the 2004-2005 fiscal year, the agents of HM Revenue and Customs <b>seized</b> 96,783 <b>items</b> of pornographic media carried by people travelling into the UK.|$|R
50|$|On June 18, 2002, {{members of}} the second {{respondent}} and the third respondent <b>seized</b> certain <b>items</b> on the second applicant's premises {{in terms of the}} warrant, annexure to the papers.

5000|$|Operation Full Disclosure (מבצע חשיפה מלאה) was a {{military}} operation {{carried out by the}} Israel Defense Forces on March 5, 2014 in the Red Sea. After days of surveillance far out to sea, Israeli Navy Shayetet 13 commandos seized the Iranian-owned and Panamanian-registered merchant vessel Klos C that had set sail from Iran, heading for Port Sudan via Iraq. [...] On board, the commandos found long-range missiles destined for Gaza concealed in [...] full of Iranian bags marked as Portland cement. [...] An unnamed senior Egyptian security official reportedly confirmed that the arms shipment was headed for militants in either Gaza or Sinai. A UN panel of experts concluded that the weapons came from Iran and were being sent to Sudan, accusing Iran of violating the arms embargo. [...] United Nations Security Council Resolution 1929 authorizes states to <b>seize</b> <b>items,</b> including arms, that Iran is forbidden from exporting.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the end of}} 1940 Sack started {{design of}} the AS-6, a full-sized, manned {{aircraft}} and successor to the earlier models. Its wing diameter was four {{times larger than the}} last model. He built it privately in a shed at his farm, using a wood construction. In 1944 the AS-6 prototype was finished and its design documents provisionally approved. Arthur Sack enlisted the help of the chief test pilot of ATG, a Leipzig firm that assembled Junkers bomber aircraft, to test the aircraft. Approximately a dozen tests revealed multiple failings, especially in the undercarriage, and managed little more than a hop off the ground. The tests continued at an airbase in Brandis by a pilot in a Messerschmidt Me 163 unit based there. As the AS-6 did not appear on an inventory of <b>seized</b> <b>items</b> when US forces captured the airbase it is assumed that the plane was destroyed to prevent capture.|$|R
50|$|The FBI {{conducted}} a second search on the legislative office of Republican State Senator Ben Stevens on September 18, 2006, <b>seizing</b> among other <b>items</b> {{documents related to}} the proposed natural gas pipeline and {{the oil and gas}} tax law which had been discussed in the Alaska Legislature during the regular and two special legislative sessions in 2006, as well as items related to his work on the Senate Ethics Committee and documents related to fisheries. Stevens disclosed to the Anchorage Daily News that the FBI <b>seized</b> <b>items</b> during both searches of his office related to the Alaska Fisheries Marketing Board (AFMB), created under legislation by Ben Steven's father, U.S. Senator Ted Stevens, to distribute federal grants to promote Alaska seafood. Ben Stevens had been chair of AFMB until early in 2006. He had received consulting fees from at least three organizations that had benefited from the grants — over $250,000 during the time he served on the board. Other documents related to fisheries were also seized in the September 18 FBI search. One of these was a copy of an affidavit by Victor Smith, a salmon fisherman from Friday Harbor who alleged that Stevens had been paid by a seiners association to lobby his father and that he failed to disclose that income as required by Alaska law.|$|R
5000|$|Fenn {{operated}} an {{art gallery}} with his wife Peggy after retiring from the United States Air Force. The gallery was located in Santa Fe, New Mexico and sold everything from artifacts to fine art and was quite successful. In 1988, Fenn {{was diagnosed with cancer}} and {{came up with the idea}} during this illness to hide a chest full of treasure for anyone to go find. He filled the chest with [...] "treasure" [...] containing gold nuggets, rare coins, jewelry and gemstones, along with an olive jar holding his autobiography. He intended to hide it and end his life nearby, with the treasure as a legacy. However, he survived his illness and waited until he was 79 or 80 to hide the treasure. Prior to the treasure hunt, Fenn found himself at odds with federal antiquities laws. FBI agents raided his home in 2009 as part of an investigation into artifact looting in the Four Corners area and <b>seized</b> <b>items,</b> but he was not charged. Two people targeted in the case committed suicide and Fenn has blamed the FBI for their deaths.|$|R
50|$|In November 2000, police raided Rebels clubhouses in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia {{and seized}} drugs, {{firearms}} {{and even a}} crocodile. A number of people were arrested on charges relating to the <b>items</b> <b>seized.</b>|$|R
50|$|Moïse Lévy de Benzion (1873-1943) was an Egyptian {{department}} store owner who built an important collection {{of art and}} antiquities. The collection was plundered by the Nazis in France during the Second World War and nearly 1000 <b>items</b> <b>seized.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Items</b> <b>seized</b> {{included}} 11 kg of hashish, 41 kg of cocaine, 2,300 crack rocks, 225 kg of marijuana, mix {{match of}} pills including speed, viagra, and ecstasy, {{computers and other}} electronic devices, Kevlar vests, $60,000 cash and 25 weapons and ammunition.|$|R
50|$|Generally the United States Supreme Court has {{upheld the}} {{principle}} of civil asset forfeiture. In addition, {{there are more than}} 400 federal statutes which empower police to take assets from convicted criminals, as well as from persons not charged with criminality. Sometimes the seizures happen as a result of different government agencies working together, such as the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Justice. Police at national and state levels cooperate in many instances according to procedural laws known as equitable sharing. In addition, there are laws which make it difficult for criminals to get dirty money clean by methods of money laundering; for example, law requires that cash deposits greater than $10,000 to a bank account be reported by the bank to the federal government, and there have been instances in which repeated cash deposits under this amount have looked suspicious to authorities even though they were done legitimately, leading to civil forfeiture seizures directly from a bank account. What has caused controversy is when the property of innocent persons is seized by police who believe that the <b>seized</b> <b>items</b> were involved in criminal activity.|$|R
50|$|The {{library was}} sequestered {{by the state}} during the French Revolution, and was greatly {{expanded}} by many valuable <b>items</b> <b>seized</b> from the abbeys of Paris and also by {{the archives of the}} Bastille. On 28 April 1797 it was declared a public library.|$|R
