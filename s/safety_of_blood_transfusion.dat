Objectives : This retrospective study aimed to analyze the percentage of voluntary and replacement blood donors and to know the sero-prevalence and changing trends of TTIs among blood donors in a tertiary care hospital. Methods : Blood donations collected over a 6 -year period were studied {{for the type of}} donation (voluntary or replacement), number of seroreactive cases. Samples were screened for anti HIV 1 & 2, HBsAg, anti HCV, syphilis and malaria. All reactive samples were retested before being labeled as seropositive. Results : Of the 187575 donors, 134391 (71. 6 %) were replacement and 53184 (28. 4 %) voluntary donors. Of all the blood donors there were 8577 (4. 57 %) seroreactive cases which included 492 (0. 26 %) of anti HIV 1 & 2, 1937 (1. 03 %) of HBsAg, 2867 (1. 53 %) of anti HCV, 3270 (1. 74 %) of syphilis and 11 (0. 006 %) of malaria.

A solid quality system to ensure safe and effective blood components that are traceable from a donor to the patient is the foundation <b>of</b> a safe <b>blood</b> supply. To stimulate and guide this process, National Health Authorities should develop guidelines for <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion,</b> including establishment <b>of</b> a quality system.

Leukoreduction prevents many adverse reactions and also improves the quality <b>of</b> the <b>blood</b> components during storage. The <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> red cells and platelets is improved by replacement of plasma with preservative solutions, which results in the reduction of isoantibodies and plasma proteins. Automation <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> collection, separation <b>of</b> whole <b>blood</b> into components, and consecutive processing steps, such as preparation of platelet concentrate from multiple donations, improves the consistent composition <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> components.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Blood {{transfusion}} has health-related, economical {{and safety}} implications. In order to optimise the transfusion chain, comprehensive research data are needed. The Dutch Transfusion Data warehouse (DTD) project aims {{to establish a}} data warehouse where data from donors and transfusion recipients are linked. This paper describes {{the design of the}} data warehouse, challenges and illustrative applications. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Quantitative data on blood donors (eg, age, blood group, antibodies) and products (type of product, processing, storage time) are obtained from the national blood bank. These are linked to data on the transfusion recipients (eg, transfusions administered, patient diagnosis, surgical procedures, laboratory parameters), which are extracted from hospital electronic health records. APPLICATIONS: Expected scientific contributions are illustrated for 4 applications: determine risk factors, predict blood use, benchmark blood use and optimise process efficiency. For each application, examples of research questions are given and analyses planned. CONCLUSIONS: The DTD project aims to build a national, continuously updated transfusion data warehouse. These data have a wide range of applications, on the donor/production side, recipient studies on blood usage and benchmarking and donor-recipient studies, which ultimately can contribute to the efficiency and <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion...</b>|$|E

Using an analytic decision model a cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted. An ICER of $ 16. 3 M per life year gained was derived. Sensitivity analysis found this result to be robust to uncertainty in the parameters used in the model. This result argues against moving to a policy of universal leucodepletion.

Background. Transfusion associated bacterial infection has remained more frequent with a sever risk of morbidity and mortality. This study assessed the bacteriological <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> collected for <b>transfusion.</b> Method. A cross-sectional study was conducted at University <b>of</b> Gondar hospital <b>blood</b> bank from December 2011 to June 2012. Bacterial isolation, identification, and antimicrobial susceptibility tests were done as per the standard procedure. Chi-square test an...|$|R
40|$|A fenotipagem eritrocitária pré-transfusional é um importante procedimento para aumentar a segurança das transfusões sangüíneas, sendo realizada rotineiramente no Hemocentro Regional de Uberaba-MG (HRU) desde 1996. O presente trabalho tem como objetivo geral avaliar a freqüência de anticorpos antieritrocitários irregulares em politransfundidos, de 1997 a 2005. Através de estudo retrospectivo foram levantados dados no arquivo do HRU de todos os pacientes aloimunizados, realizou-se análise estatística descritiva e comparam-se as proporções pelo teste "Z". Dos 23. 220 transfundidos no período, com média de 5, 7 transfusões por paciente, observou-se a ocorrência de aloimunização em 173 (0, 75 %). Os sistemas Rh e Kell juntos tiveram freqüência {{superior}} a 70 %. A proporção do anti-D foi significativamente maior nas mulheres (p Testing <b>of</b> the pre-transfusional <b>blood</b> phenotype, {{which has}} been carried out at the Regional Blood Bank in Uberaba since 1996, is an important procedure to improve <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> <b>transfusions.</b> This study aims to describe the frequency <b>of</b> irregular red <b>blood</b> cell antibodies in multiple-transfused patients from 1997 to 2005. In a retrospective study, data from all alloimmunized patients were collected from the blood bank files. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed and a comparison of proportions was made using the Z test. Alloimmunization was observed in 173 (0. 75 %) of the 23, 220 transfused patients, with an average of 5. 7 transfusions per patient. The frequency of the Rh and Kell systems jointly was over 70 %. The proportion of anti-D was significantly higher in women (p< 0. 05) and no difference was noted in the Rh system between Caucasians and non-Caucasians. Seventy percent (70 %) of the patients were over 30 years of age. Out of the 73 patients with registered diseases, 39. 73 % had acute anemias, 31. 51 % chronic anemias and 28. 77 % oncological or onco-hematologic diseases. Approximately 70 % of antibodies were discovered before the 10 th transfusion. The low frequency of alloimmunization observed at the Regional <b>Blood</b> Bank <b>of</b> Uberaba reinforces the importance <b>of</b> pre-transfusional <b>blood</b> phenotype screening for all multiple-transfused patients as well as its adoption as a common practice in all hemotherapy center...|$|R

This review {{addresses the}} evidence for red blood cell, fresh frozen plasma and platelet transfusions in acute and chronic blood loss, from both {{the upper and lower}} intestinal tract. It reviews the indications for transfusion in GI bleeding, the haematological consequences <b>of</b> massive <b>blood</b> loss and massive transfusion, and the importance of managing coagulopathy in bleeding patients. It also looks at the <b>safety</b> and risks <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion,</b> and provides clinicians with evidence to reduce unnecessary transfusion. Large controlled clinical trials <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> specifically in GI bleeding are required, along with further research into the use of adjuvant therapies such as recombinant activated factor VIIa.
