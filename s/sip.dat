40|$|Background: Epidemiological studies report {{markedly}} varying {{rates of}} adolescent alcohol involvement. Despite being a common adolescent behavior, a potential {{cause of this}} variation is that consumption of <b>sips</b> is either not measured or not distinguished from consumption of whole beverages. Methods: Participants were 1, 843 grade 7 adolescents recruited across 49 Australian secondary schools (M age = 12. 4, SD = 0. 5). Quantity and frequency of lifetime and past 6 -month consumption were assessed, distinguishing between <b>sipping</b> and drinking. For comparison with international population surveys, quantity was reported as any consumption, <b>sipping</b> only, and drinking only. Results: Combining <b>sipping</b> and drinking into a single category, lifetime consumption was reported by 67. 3 % of the present sample. Distinguishing lifetime consumption by <b>sipping</b> and drinking: only 7. 8 % of adolescents had consumed a whole beverage; the remaining 59. 6 % had only <b>sipped.</b> Consumption of whole beverages was mostly limited to 1 to 2 drinks (84. 2 % of drinkers). <b>Sipping</b> and drinking were also infrequent: 78. 2 % of <b>sipping</b> and 60. 4 % of drinking, occurred less than monthly. Heavy episodic consumption was uncommon (1. 2 % of the sample). When other population studies were inspected, a clear trend for higher drinking rates were found in those studies where <b>sipping</b> was counted as drinking and vice versa. Conclusions: Consumption of whole beverages appears infrequent in early adolescence, as <b>sipping,</b> but not drinking, was common in our sample. Comparing the present data with international population consumption measures highlights the need to more precisely measure and report adolescent consumption, particularly in relation to <b>sipping...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background Substantial {{rates of}} early {{adolescent}} alcohol consumption {{have been reported}} in population surveys and cohort studies, most often occurring in parent-supervised contexts. Having a <b>sip(s)</b> of alcohol (<b>sipping)</b> is a common early adolescent behaviour, typically preceding whole beverage consumption (drinking). No known studies have explicitly addressed rates of <b>sipping</b> in relation to drinking. Parenting practices, peer influences and problem behaviours are known predictors of adolescent alcohol consumption. How these factors differ in relation to <b>sipping</b> and drinking, and their relationship with parental alcohol provision, has not been addressed in existing literature. Methods Utilizing a longitudinal cohort of early adolescent parent-child dyads, four studies sought to examine: 1) the extent of <b>sipping</b> and drinking as distinct quantities of alcohol consumption; 2) cross-sectional associations between <b>sipping</b> and drinking in relation to parenting practices, peer influences, and problem behaviours; 3) prospective associations between parenting practices, peer influences, and problem behaviours with <b>sipping</b> and drinking one-year later; and 4) prospective associations between parenting practices, peer influences, and problem behaviours on parental alcohol provision one-year later. Results Study I documented that early adolescent lifetime alcohol consumption was high (67 %). Disaggregating consumption into <b>sipping</b> or drinking showed that most consumption was limited to <b>sipping</b> (62 %), and drinking was uncommon (5 %). Study II demonstrated that <b>sipping</b> and drinking were associated with lenient parental alcohol-specific rules, substance-using peers, and decreased problem behaviours. In the prospective analyses of Study III, lenient alcohol-specific rules, home alcohol access, decreased parental monitoring, and substance-using peers were also associated with <b>sipping</b> and drinking one-year later. Finally, Study IV found parental alcohol provision was unrelated to poor parenting practices, and was prospectively predicted by parental alcohol consumption, home alcohol access, lenient alcohol-specific rules, and parental perception of substance-using peers. Conclusions <b>Sipping,</b> but not drinking, was common during early adolescence. The present findings demonstrated the need to distinguish between <b>sipping</b> and drinking as independent quantities of alcohol consumption. Meanwhile, parental provision appeared to represent positive parenting opportunities and attempts to supervise adolescent alcohol initiation. Together, the present findings have significant implications for adolescent alcohol epidemiology, and future prevention and intervention research and policies...|$|R

5|$|Some lead {{compounds}} are colorful {{and are used}} widely in paints, and lead paint is a major route of lead exposure in children. A study conducted in 1998–2000 found that 38 million housing units in the US had lead-based paint, down from a 1990 estimate of 64 million. Deteriorating lead paint can produce dangerous lead levels in household dust and soil. Deteriorating lead paint and lead-containing household dust are the main causes of chronic lead poisoning. The lead breaks down into the dust and since children {{are more prone to}} crawling on the floor, it is easily ingested. Many young children display pica, eating things that are not food. Even a small amount of a lead-containing product such as a paint chip or a <b>sip</b> of glaze can contain tens or hundreds of milligrams of lead. Eating chips of lead paint presents a particular hazard to children, generally producing more severe poisoning than occurs from dust. Because removing lead paint from dwellings, e.g. by sanding or torching creates lead-containing dust and fumes, it is generally safer to seal the lead paint under new paint (excepting moveable windows and doors, which create paint dust when operated). Alternately, special precautions must be taken if the lead paint is to be removed. In oil painting it was once common for colours such as yellow or white to be made with lead carbonate. Lead white oil colour was the main white of oil painters until superseded by compounds containing zinc or titanium in the mid-20th century. It is speculated that the painter Caravaggio and possibly Francisco Goya and Vincent Van Gogh had lead poisoning due to overexposure or carelessness when handling this colour.|$|E

StephensConventional wood framing, {{also known}} as stick framing, {{has been around for}} {{hundreds}} of years. It is an easy, effective method for building new houses and small commercial projects. However, it may no longer the best option for new construction. The development of Structural Insulated Panels (<b>SIPs)</b> began over 70 years ago at the United States Forest Products Laboratory in Wisconsin. Scientists believed that plywood sheathing alone could provide adequate strength to support the loads a structure encounters. Over the years, <b>SIPs</b> have evolved to what they are today: a rigid insulation foam core sandwiched between two skins, often made of oriented strand boards (OSB). Compared to stick framing, <b>SIPs</b> are faster to erect in the field and also provide more strength to resist most loads; they are better with axial and transverse loads. Stick framing can be built more robust to resist in-plane shear loads. The quality of the material of <b>SIPs</b> also means better quality construction. The insulating values <b>SIPs</b> provide are far superior to that of fiberglass insulation used in stick framing, saving money for the owner as well as energy from natural resources. Not only do they provide better thermal protection, but they are also better for the environment because of manufacturing processes and construction practices. When it comes to other issues such as fire, smoke, termites, and ventilation, <b>SIPs</b> are no worse than stick framing. <b>SIPs</b> follow the same steps for construction used in stick framing with, perhaps a little more care needed to insure proper ventilation. <b>SIPs</b> have proven themselves in the laboratory and in the real world. <b>SIPs</b> should be considered more often as an option, replacing stick framing for the major structure elements and insulation for new buildings...|$|R
