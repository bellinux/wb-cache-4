40|$|Finite Element Method (FEM) {{was used}} to {{simulate}} the Photoelastic Stress Minimization (PSM) method developed by Durelli {{to solve the problem}} of finding the optimal <b>stress</b> <b>raiser</b> profiles in isotropic and advanced composite structures. In Durelli's method, material in lowly stressed regions of the design domain is removed so as to make the sections of the discontinuity boundary become isochromatics of the same Tresca stress. The process of material removal was simulated by iterative deleting of elements lying on the <b>stress</b> <b>raiser</b> boundary, followed by smoothing and remeshing subroutines. The criterion proposed for element "removal" was to select only a number of elements having lower stresses among those that are in the design domain and on the current boundary. This number was set by a removal rate and controlled to get smaller as the optimization proceeds. The process was terminated when the stress distribution on the boundary became uniform or the number of elements to be removed reached the predefined minimum value. It was shown that the proposed FEM simulation could be applied to solve various stress minimization problems involving isotropic materials. Investigations of the effects of parameters controlling the optimization process on the convergence and the final results were carried out. By taking into account the existence of isotropic points stress, which could lead to the divergence from the optimal profile, the proposed FEM simulation proved to be capable of handling more general classes of stress minimization problems. The FEM simulation was further extended to search for optimal <b>stress</b> <b>raiser</b> profiles for structures made of advanced composite materials...|$|E

50|$|A stress {{concentration}} (often called <b>stress</b> <b>raisers</b> or <b>stress</b> risers) is a location in an object where stress is concentrated. An object is stronger when force is evenly distributed over its area, so {{a reduction in}} area, e.g., caused by a crack, results in a localized increase in stress. A material can fail, via a propagating crack, when a concentrated stress exceeds the material's theoretical cohesive strength. The real fracture strength of a material is always lower than the theoretical value because most materials contain small cracks or contaminants (especially foreign particles) that concentrate stress. Fatigue cracks always start at <b>stress</b> <b>raisers,</b> so removing such defects increases the fatigue strength.|$|R

40|$|AbstractFixation {{failure of}} glenoid {{components}} {{is the main}} cause of unsuccessful total shoulder arthroplasties. The characteristics of these failures are still not well understood, hence, attempts at improving the implant fixation are somewhat blind and the failure rate remains high. This lack of understanding is largely due to the fundamental problem that direct observations of failure are impossible as the fixation is inherently embedded within the bone. Twenty custom made implants, reflecting various common fixation designs, and a specimen set-up was prepared to enable direct observation of failure when the specimens were exposed to cyclic superior loads during laboratory experiments. Finite element analyses of the laboratory tests were also carried out to explain the observed failure scenarios. All implants, irrespective of the particular fixation design, failed at the implant–cement interface and failure initiated at the inferior part of the component fixation. Finite element analyses indicated that this failure scenario was caused by a weak and brittle implant–cement interface and tensile stresses in the inferior region possibly worsened by a <b>stress</b> <b>raiser</b> effect at the inferior rim. The results {{of this study indicate that}} glenoid failure can be delayed or prevented by improving the implant/cement interface strength. Also any design features that reduce the geometrical <b>stress</b> <b>raiser</b> and the inferior tensile stresses in general should delay implant loosening...|$|E

With regard to the problem of transferring crack growth data, our results demonstrate that underlying assumptions of the current concept of ductile tearing evoke a suspicion from different points of view.

In particular, this work examines the effective values not only at the tip of a <b>stress</b> <b>raiser,</b> but also in the surrounding material.

40|$|In {{this work}} {{numerical}} simulations were performed {{in order to}} {{study the effects of}} surface roughness on the deflection of gold coated silicon cantilevers due to molecular adsorption. The cantilever was modeled using a ball and spring system where the spring constants for the Si-Si, Si-Au, and Au-Au bonds were obtained from first principal calculations. The molecular adsorption process was simulated by elongating the natural bond length at available bonding sites chosen randomly on the cantilever. Increasing the bond length created a surface stress on the cantilever causing it to deflect. In all cases the structure refinement was performed by minimizing the energy of the system using a simulated annealing algorithm and a high quality random number generator called Mersenne Twister. The system studied consisted of a 1 micrometer by 1 micrometer portion of a cantilever of various surface roughnesses with variable boundary condition and was processed in parallel on the ACEnet (Atlantic Computational Excellence Network) cluster. The results have indicated that cantilevers with a rougher gold surface deflected more than those with a smoother surface. The increase in deflection is attributed to an increase in <b>stress</b> <b>raisers</b> in the gold film localized around the surface features. The onset of <b>stress</b> <b>raisers</b> increases the differential stress between the top and bottom surfaces and results in an increase in the deflection of the cantilever. ...|$|R

30|$|The above {{studies show}} that the {{electrical}} properties are affected by the intermetallic compounds formed in the joint while it is in service. The studies also show that the intermetallic compounds affect mechanical properties of the joint. For instance, the study of Braunović and Alexandrov 1994 showed that high microhardness in the intermetallic compounds resulted in brittleness leading to easy fracture and low mechanical strength of the joint. A similar finding has been reported for brazing of an aluminium and copper joint containing an Al 2 Cu phase (Feng et al. 2012 b). The hardness characteristics created by the Al 2 Cu intermetallic compounds result in increased brittleness in the weld metal, which can act as a <b>stress</b> <b>raiser</b> leading to the initiation of cracks. A joint formed by Zn- 15 Al filler metal had the highest shear strength because of the uniform distribution of the Al 2 Cu intermetallic compound, which could also reduce the electrical resistance (Feng et al. 2012 b).|$|E

Besides, the medium flow past a thermowell causes vortices to be shed at a frequency, termed the wake frequency, proportional to the flow velocity. If the wake frequency is {{at or near the}} natural frequency of thermowell, a resonance condition may occur where massive amounts of energy are absorbed by the thermowell, resulting in very high stresses and possible failure.
