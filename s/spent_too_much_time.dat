5|$|Eisenhower favored Shoup {{because he}} feared other {{officers}} <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> in political affairs, and felt Shoup {{would reduce the}} influence of the military industrial complex. Immediately after his appointment, Shoup sought to place new officers in key positions, in an attempt to overhaul the leadership of the Marine Corps. He and Pate disagreed over some of the new appointments, as Shoup transferred many senior officers and encouraged others to retire. Shoup later wrote he felt the Joint Chiefs of Staff had an undue weight in the direction of military strategy. He also sought to curtail politicking by lower-level Marine officers seeking career advancement.|$|E
5|$|Christian Donlan of Eurogamer was {{surprised}} by the long length of the game and the amount of variety it offered given its simple premise. He enjoyed the game's pacing and felt that separating puzzles into short levels kept the game fun. Game Informer reviewer Kyle Hilliard also approved of the game's pacing. He remarked that BoxBoy!s low price and well-designed puzzles made it entirely worth playing. VentureBeat writer Gavin Greene agreed that the game offered a lot of content at an inexpensive price. The game's structure did draw some criticism from Jon Wahlgren, writing for Nintendo Life. He thought the game <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> teaching new mechanics and did not give players enough freedom to explore or experiment; as a result he believed the game felt restricted.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arriving}} at the artifact, Shepard has {{a vision of the}} Reaper fleet approaching. Kenson and her entire team, however, turn out to have been indoctrinated from having <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> studying the artifact. She attacks Shepard, who is eventually overwhelmed by her soldiers. Upon awakening two days later, Shepard manages to escape and reach the control room, where he/she sets the asteroid on course to hit the Bahak system's relay. In retaliation, Kenson plans to destroy the asteroid by overloading the reactor core of the facility, but Shepard ultimately stops her. Shepard then contacts his/her starship and escapes shortly before the asteroid hits the Relay, resulting in the destruction of the entire Bahak system. Shepard is later met by Admiral Steven Hackett, their superior officer, who explains that he/she has to go to Earth and face the consequences, setting the stage for Mass Effect 3.|$|E
50|$|She studied {{painting}} under John Opie and was {{the only}} female student that he taught. He painted her portrait between 1790 and 1800. Using a painting made by Opie, Read painted a portrait of Dr. Priestly. They {{may have had a}} romantic relationship. It was a concern of her uncle, Rev. William Betham (1749-1839) who warned Isabella about Jane and Opie <b>spenting</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> together. His comments soured William's relationship with the Beetham's. Opie's wife, the former Mary Bunn, ran off with another man and the Opies were divorced on December 23, 1796. Opie was adamantly rejected when he asked Edward Beetham if he could marry Jane. Soon after, Jane married John Read.|$|R
5000|$|Jerry Pournelle of BYTE {{named the}} Atari ST version his {{game of the}} month for August 1986, {{describing}} it as [...] "like the old 8-bit Star Raiders had died and gone to heaven.

5|$|Clough was {{appointed}} as manager at Third Division Brighton & Hove Albion on 1 November 1973, with Taylor joining as his assistant. Just after the pair were appointed, the team lost 4–0 {{at home to}} Walton & Hersham in an FA Cup replay and then 8–2 at home to Bristol Rovers on 1 December. Brighton finished 19th in the final table in the 1973–74 season, narrowly avoiding relegation to the Fourth Division, and the pair began to rebuild the team by signing Peter Grummitt, Andy Rollings, Ian Mellor, Steve Govier, and Ken Goodewe; Taylor felt that Clough never settled at Brighton however, and <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> away on media commitments. Clough left for Leeds United in July 1974, but Taylor refused to go with Clough as he felt Brighton and club chairman Mike Bamber had treated them well, and so the partnership ended after nine years as Taylor stayed at the Goldstone Ground as sole manager. He went on to sign striker Peter Ward and midfielder Brian Horton, but admitted that both he and Clough were much more effective as a duo; {{he felt that he}} had struggled to make the good players he signed play to their full potential whilst feeling that Clough had bought and sold poorly as Leeds manager. He stayed on at the South coast club for a further two seasons, guiding the team to a fourth-place finish in 1975–76, missing promotion by two points. His successor, Alan Mullery, managed to lead the team Taylor left behind to promotion in 1976–77 and then into the top-flight in 1978–79.|$|E
25|$|While Lord Sugar {{indicated}} that he thought Andrew should have been brought back into the boardroom instead of Navdeep, since the cakes he baked were deemed to be unimpressive, Navdeep was warned that she had <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> in the background, and needed to step up in the following task.|$|E
25|$|Robertson {{later came}} out to Beauvais in March 1917 to demand that Wilson keep him fully {{informed}} of all developments. On {{a visit to the}} Italian Front in March 1917 Robertson was unimpressed by the “white faces and white hands” of many Italian officers, which suggested that they <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> at headquarters and not enough time visiting the front lines.|$|E
5000|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} {{in which he}} assessed the band's discography up to that point, Brodsky said the album was [...] "the big, slick rock record we <b>spent</b> way <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> and money making. That’s basically what happens when too many people get involved in your business. Still, I can stand behind songs like [...] "Seafrost" [...] and [...] "Youth Overrided"." ...|$|R

500|$|Along {{with the}} release of Under My Skin, the musical style of [...] "Take Me Away" [...] was {{strongly}} compared with American rock band Evanescence. James R. Minchin III of Entertainment Weekly spoke out that Lavigne has transformed into a dour teen who seems to have <b>spent</b> way <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> listening to Evanescence. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine noted that Lavigne's sound was now much heavier and darker and compared her to Amy Lee, the co-founder and lead vocalist of Evanescence.|$|R
25|$|Barbaro was {{the last}} Venetian {{ambassador}} to leave Persia, after Uzun Hassan died in 1478. By this point only one of Barbaro's entourage was left. While Hassan's sons fought {{each other for the}} throne, Barbaro hired an Armenian guide and escaped by way of Erzerum, Aleppo, and Beirut. Barbaro reached Venice in 1479, where he defended himself against complaints that he had <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> in Cyprus before going to Persia. Barbaro's report included not just political and military matters, but discussed Persian agriculture, commerce, and customs.|$|E
25|$|Reed {{competed in}} (and {{was the first}} wrestler {{eliminated}} from) the first Royal Rumble match in January 1988. Two months later, he was eliminated {{in the first round}} of the WrestleMania IV championship tournament in the first round by eventual tournament winner Randy Savage. Reed dominated most of the match against Savage, but <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> mouthing off to Savage's manager (and real life wife) Miss Elizabeth while climbing to the top turnbuckle. Savage caught Reed, threw him off for a slam and immediately hit his Diving elbow drop off the top turnbuckle for the win.|$|E
25|$|The Polish nobles {{were unhappy}} that their new king <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> on Lithuanian affairs. It {{was clear that}} the war could {{continue}} for years and would not bring any benefit to Poland. In 1392, Władysław sent Henry of Masovia with an offer to make Vytautas regent instead of Skirgaila. Vytautas accepted and again broke with the Order. He burned three Teutonic castles and returned to Vilnius. Jagiełło and Vytautas signed the Astrava Treaty in which Vytautas recovered all Kęstutis' lands, including Trakai, and was given more. Vytautas would rule Lithuania in the name of Władysław. After Vytautas' death, all his lands and powers would revert to Władysław.|$|E

But it just felt lackluster for most of it and <b>spent</b> far <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> with Lucifer doing not much as the president. There {{certainly}} could be some interesting story to come from Lucifer's baby, but the contrived ending left me scratching my head rather than exuberantly looking forward to what's next." ...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] {{function}} call can be repeatedly called {{for short periods}} of time to slow the execution of a running program or code. Throttling code in this manner provides a course mechanism for mitigating the effects of overheating hardware or easing timing issues for legacy programs. The downside to cycling sleep and running states rather than leveraging cycle emulation (via an emulator) to control the execution speed of software is that interactive software will acquire a notable stutter if too little <b>time</b> is <b>spent</b> awake, <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> is <b>spent</b> sleeping, or a combination of both.|$|R

25|$|Four men, {{including}} Baker, {{announced their}} candidacy for the November special election {{to fill the}} remainder of Reynolds' term. The other candidates included Kentucky Court of Appeals Justices John Miller and Joseph Huddleston and William S. Cooper. Baker {{finished third in the}} special election with 30,278 votes; Cooper won the seat, garnering 33,670 votes to Huddleston's 32,137 and Miller's 26,592. Each candidate won by a large margin in his home county, but Baker, from Barren County, cut into Huddleston's margin in neighboring Warren County, while low overall voter turnout in Daviess County hurt Miller. During the campaign, fellow justice Joseph Lambert told Baker that he <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> writing opinions and not enough time campaigning.|$|E
25|$|At {{least one}} well-regarded {{political}} analyst (published by Foreign Policy and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty) said that {{conditions in the}} Central Asian republic of Turkmenistan were similar enough to those in countries currently experiencing protests and revolts that the autocratic government of President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov appears worried by the precedent of revolutions in North Africa and major political concessions in several Western Asian states. Berdimuhamedov's regime has censored all news of the protests and governmental changes. There have also been some credible reports of Turkmenistani authorities attempting {{to keep tabs on}} all citizens {{both inside and outside the}} country, with Turkmenistanis whom the government judges to have <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> abroad allegedly warned they could be barred either from returning to their home country, or from leaving again once they do return.|$|E
25|$|Forest Grove {{started a}} {{volunteer}} fire department on February 4, 1894, with {{combination of two}} fire companies. The department was created after bucket brigades were determined to be inefficient, and the two fire companies <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> fighting each other. One of the first chiefs was J. G. Lenneville, who was first elected to the post in 1901, and served through at least 1923. In December 1907, the city purchased a hose wagon for $100. The city replaced the fire bell that had been housed at a church and at the Old College Hall at Pacific University with an electric siren in October 1925. A 1907 steamer used by the Portland Fire Bureau was bought by Forest Grove in 1933 for $150, and is still owned by the fire department.|$|E

5000|$|I {{designed}} the waterbed during {{years as a}} bed patient in the middle thirties; a pump to control water level, side supports to permit one to float rather than simply lying on a not very soft water filled mattress. Thermostatic control of temperature, safety interfaces to avoid all possibility of electric shock, waterproof box to make a leak no {{more important than a}} leaky hot water bottle rather than a domestic disaster, calculation of floor loads (important!), internal rubber mattress and lighting, reading, and eating arrangements—an attempt to design the perfect hospital bed by one who had <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> damn <b>much</b> <b>time</b> in hospital beds.|$|R

Mr. Toad had <b>too</b> <b>much</b> to do. He was altogether too busy. He had a large garden to take care of, had Mr. Toad, and work in a garden is very hard on clothes. So Mr. Toad just wore his old suit over his new one and went on about his business.|$|R
500|$|Edwards' {{political}} {{rivalry with}} Jesse B. Thomas continued {{for the rest}} of his time as governor. [...] Edwards, along with much of the legislature, criticized the territory's judges for their inactivity. Among their complaints were that the judges did not hold court often enough and <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> absent from the territory. The legislature passed a bill in 1814 to reform the territory's judicial system. The judges refused to acknowledge the act, claiming that they were outside the jurisdiction of the legislature. In 1815 the issue was resolved by Congress, which passed a law supporting Edwards and the legislature.|$|E
500|$|In 1844 Bennett married Mary Anne Wood (1824–1862), the {{daughter}} of a naval commander. Composition gave way to a ceaseless round of teaching and musical administration. The writer and composer Geoffrey Bush sees the marriage as marking a break in Bennett's career; [...] "from 1844 to 1856 [...] was a freelance teacher, conductor and concert organiser; a very occasional pianist and a still more occasional composer." [...] Clara Schumann noted that Bennett <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> giving private lessons to keep up with changing trends in music: [...] "His only chance of learning new music is in the carriage on the way from one lesson to another." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{supporter}} of the annexation of Texas and [...] "manifest destiny", Breckinridge campaigned for James K. Polk in the 1844 presidential election, prompting a relative to observe that he was [...] "making himself very conspicuous here by making flaming loco foco speeches at the Barbecues". He decided against running for Scott County clerk after his law partner complained that he <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> in politics. In 1845, he declined to seek election to the U.S. House of Representatives from the Eighth District but campaigned for Alexander Keith Marshall, his party's unsuccessful nominee. He supported Zachary Taylor for the presidency in mid-1847 but endorsed the Democratic ticket of Lewis Cass and William O. Butler after Taylor became a Whig in 1848.|$|E

Without question, the first critical support I must acknowledge is that of my thesis advisor, Jonathan Smith. This dissertation could never have been completed without his unflagging belief in the subject matter and in my ability to do it justice. I must also express my gratitude toward my family, who had to do without me more than I would like so that I could, little by little, push this work to completion. I would particularly like to thank my wife Sarah, who shouldered {{the vast majority of the}} burdens that I did not have the time or the energy to take on myself.

40|$|For a Canadian, {{there is}} some irony in {{learning}} that rediscovering the American dream may turn decisively on resuscitating federalism and clarifying the division of powers between the central government and the federated units, as Dr. Alice Rivlin suggests in Reviving the American Dream. After all, Canadians have <b>spent</b> all <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> in this century worrying about an optimal division of powers between the orders of government. If there were an export market for proposals detailing alternate forms of federal organization, Canada would have few, if any, trade rivals. More often than not, Canadians are embarrassed by this preoccupation, believing that they are diverting attention from concrete matters of policy. Instead of worrying so much about who ought to exercise power over various policy domains, why not {{pay more attention to}} what the policy ought to be? In that sense, Rivlin 2 ̆ 7 s suggestion that rethinking federalism may increase living standards comes as a tremendous relief. Maybe Canadians haven 2 ̆ 7 t been wasting their time after all...|$|R

He decided against running for county clerk of Scott County after his law partner {{complained that he}} <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> in politics. In 1845, some local Democrats {{encouraged}} him to seek the Eighth District's congressional seat, but he declined, supporting instead Alexander Keith Marshall, the party's unsuccessful nominee.

500|$|Joyce was {{not invited}} to join Scott's Terra Nova Expedition, {{although}} several of Shackleton's men were, including Frank Wild who declined. Instead, Joyce and Wild both signed up for Douglas Mawson's Australasian Antarctic Expedition. In 1911 Joyce travelled to Denmark to acquire dogs for this expedition, and took them on to Tasmania. Joyce did not subsequently sail with Mawson. According to one account he was [...] "dismissed" [...] before the expedition left Australia, [...] while another suggests that Joyce was dropped when Mawson reduced his expedition from three shore parties to two. Whatever the reason, it appears {{that there was a}} falling-out; Mawson reportedly distrusted Joyce, saying that [...] "he <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> in hotels", which suggests that drink was an issue. Joyce remained in Australia, obtaining work with the Sydney Harbour Trust.|$|E
500|$|Black Beauty was {{originally}} released only in Japan in 1973. It contained four side-long tracks spread across a double album, grouping the songs as medleys titled [...] "Black Beauty Part I", [...] "Black Beauty Part II", and so on, {{all of which}} credited Davis as the composer. He {{did not want the}} actual segments specified on the track listing out of a distaste for critics and listeners who arduously analyzed his music; according to DeJohnette's wife Lydia, [...] "Miles really felt that critics and people <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> in their mental mind, analyzing and talking for hours about something that really just is." [...] Columbia spent several years identifying some of the individual compositions to ensure royalty payment for the actual composers. The Japanese release also mistakenly credited Michael Henderson—Davis' other bassist during this period—rather than Holland in the liner notes.|$|E
5000|$|Executive {{producer}} Allan McKeown {{fell out}} with Jimmy Nail during filming, {{as he felt}} his ego {{was out of control}} at this time and would often ask for his lines to be changed. In his autobiography, Nail said he was glad to be done with filming not just because of Holton's death but he felt the second series lacked the gritty edge of the first series, which is something Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais later said they agreed with. On the audio commentary for series two, Clement said the series was much more contrived in getting and keeping the gang together, and La Frenais said he felt the gang weren't trapped together enough like they were in Germany in the hut. In particular, he felt the Spanish episodes were too luxurious for the gang, and instead of sleeping rough, having arguments, and clashing with the Spanish locals, they <b>spent</b> far <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> just walking around in summer clothes and chilling out, {{and a few of the}} characters had their partners tagging along, which made the show much less edgy.|$|R
5000|$|Andy Gill from The Independent said, positively, that: [...] "other {{highlights}} include [...] "Just Can't Get Enough" [...] - not the Depeche Mode song - which vaults suddenly from the rare dignity of string-synth textures to a sweatily pumping techno finale". Lewis Corner from Digital Spy rated it three stars (out of five) and commented that: [...] "The back-and-forth production - reminiscent of vintage arcade game Pong - comprises electronic synths and soft strings teamed with heavy beats and, of course, the obligatory vocoded [...] "mega switch up" [...] - prompting its transformation into a thumping techno endgame.

5000|$|The [...] "Illustrious Guest" [...] (1847) is a {{depiction}} of U.S. Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky, {{the presidential candidate}} whom Beard supported in 1844, who lost to James K. Polk of Tennessee. The painting shows Clay relaxing in a chair in a country tavern as others watch his every move, he being nonchalant {{about the presence of}} the other guests. Beard later complained that Clay may have lost to Polk because Clay <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of his <b>time</b> campaigning in taverns. In early 2009, The Illustrious Guest was featured on the PBS television program, Antiques Roadshow. After viewing the program, art appraiser Alan Fausel was quoted as saying that the picture [...] "could hang in an art museum". Rebecca Lawton, the curator of paintings and sculptures at the Amon Carter Museum in Fort Worth, Texas, said that she was intrigued by the painting when she saw it on PBS. Upon viewing the art piece in person, Lawton was able to place the painting in the museum.|$|R
