Since then my eyes have been opened, and I understand many things--most of all that my father wished it, for he has told me so, and that Geoffrey is heavily interested financially in his ventures. I know that he has sunk large sums of money in the mine, and they have found no ore, while I heard a chance whisper of a mortgage on Carrington.

40|$|Abstract: The bulk of {{corporate}} governance theory examines the agency problems {{that arise from}} two extreme ownership structures: 100 percent <b>small</b> <b>shareholders</b> or one large, controlling owner combined with <b>small</b> <b>shareholders.</b> In this paper, we question the empirical validity of this dichotomy. In fact, one-third of publicly listed firms in Europe have multiple large owners, and {{the market value of}} firms with multiple blockholders differs from firms with a single large owner and from widely-held firms. Moreover, the relationship between corporate valuations and the distribution of cash-flow rights across multiple large owners is consistent with the predictions of recent theoretical models...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} takeovers {{of companies}} owned by atomistic shareholders and by one minority blockholder, {{all of whom}} can only decide to tender or retain their shares. As private benefit extraction is inefficient, the post-takeover share value increases with the bidder’s shareholdings. In a successful takeover, the blockholder tenders all his shares and the <b>small</b> <b>shareholders</b> tender the amount needed such that the post-takeover share value matches the bid price. Compared to a fully dispersed target company, the bidder may have to offer a higher price either to win the blockholder’s support or to attract enough shares from <b>small</b> <b>shareholders.</b> (JEL G 34) ...|$|R
40|$|Background: To {{maintain}} or increase the {{trust in the}} market, companies can disclose more voluntary information in the annual reports. According to prior research the annual report is {{the primary source of}} information for <b>small</b> <b>shareholders</b> and investors. Thus, it is of interest to investigate why companies chose to report the voluntary information inquired by this group. Purpose: We investigate some company-specific factors to decide whether these determine the extent of voluntary information, particularly inquired by <b>small</b> <b>shareholders</b> and investors, in the annual reports of listed Swedish companies. We also aim to discuss underlying causes for our result. Procedure: With statistical methods we have tested hypotheses on relations between company-specific factors and the extent of voluntary information in the annual reports. Results: It is significant that profitability, industry type and quotation status have relations with the extent of voluntary information inquired by <b>small</b> <b>shareholders</b> and investors. No relations have been found between the extent of voluntary disclosure and company-size, ownership dispersion, investments in tangible assets or share issues...|$|R
50|$|On a {{preliminary}} issue {{as to whether}} a duty of care existed in the circumstances as alleged by the plaintiff, the plaintiff was unsuccessful at first instance but was successful in the Court of Appeal in establishing a duty of care might exist in the circumstances. Sir Thomas Bingham MR held that as a <b>small</b> <b>shareholder,</b> Caparo was entitled {{to rely on the}} accounts. Had Caparo been a simple outside investor, with no stake in the company, it would have had no claim. But because the auditors' work is primarily intended to be {{for the benefit of the}} shareholders, and Caparo did in fact have a small stake when it saw the company accounts, its claim was good. This was overturned by the House of Lords, which unanimously held there was no duty of care.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies block {{trades and}} tender offers as {{alternative}} means for transferring corporate control in firms with a dominant minority blockholder and an otherwise dispersed ownership structure. Incumbent and new controlling parties strictly prefer to trade the controlling block. From a social point of view, however, {{this method is}} inferior to tender offers, because it preserves {{a low level of}} ownership concentration which induces more inefficient extraction of private control benefits. This discrepancy is caused by the free-riding behaviour of <b>small</b> <b>shareholders.</b> Moreover, the controlling block trades at a premium which reflects, in part, the surplus that the incumbent and the acquirer realize by avoiding a tender offer and the consequent transfer to <b>small</b> <b>shareholders.</b> Therefore, factors that alter the pay-offs of <b>small</b> <b>shareholders</b> in a tender offer (e. g. supermajority rules, disclosure rules and non-voting shares) also alter the block premium. Finally, the paper argues that greenmail, like block trading, enables the controlling parties to preserve low levels of ownership concentration and large private control benefits. block premia; greenmail; takeover regulation; tender offers...|$|R
