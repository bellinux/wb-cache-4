25|$|The {{pineapple}} gall adelgid is {{endemic to}} Europe, {{belonging to the}} 'woolly adelgid' group; it is also widely distributed in the north-eastern United States. <b>Spruce</b> <b>gall</b> <b>aphid,</b> eastern <b>spruce</b> pineapple <b>gall</b> adelges and eastern <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> <b>aphid</b> are alternative names. This insect belongs to the superfamily Aphidoidea, and family Adelgidae. It is the primary pest of Norway Spruce. Another similar species, the Cooley <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> adelgid, is indigenous to North America. This adelgid usually affects Colorado Blue, Sitka, Englemann, and Oriental spruces.|$|R

40|$|<b>Sitka</b> <b>spruce</b> (Picea sitchensis (Bong.)

In recent years the biodiversity of <b>Sitka</b> <b>spruce</b> plantations in Ireland has become a topic of much research interest. However, fungal biodiversity has yet to be systematically surveyed in Irish <b>Sitka</b> <b>spruce</b> forests. This study	reports	on	the	diversity	of	macrofungi	from	nine	<b>Sitka</b>	<b>spruce</b>	plots	in	five	counties surveyed over three years. One hundred and forty four species were discovered in the plots, including three species new (previously unrecorded) to the Republic of Ireland. Over half the species discovered were ectomycorrhizal species, highlighting the generalist nature of <b>Sitka</b> <b>spruce</b> as an ectomycorrhizal host in Western Europe. The 10 most common species are listed; members of the genus Mycena were the most commonly found macrofungi. On a relative sampling basis (species per m 2), the biodiversity of macrofungi in Irish <b>Sitka</b> <b>spruce</b> forests is comparable to that found in native <b>Sitka</b> <b>spruce</b> forests in Canada. The ability of <b>Sitka</b> <b>spruce</b> forests in Ireland to support native biodiversity is discussed with reference to studies of other taxonomic groups and recommendations for the promotion of fungal diversity in Irish <b>Sitka</b> <b>spruce</b> forests are made...|$|R

40|$|White {{pine weevil}} (Pissodes strobi, Peck.) {{is a native}} forest insect pest in the Pacific Northwest of North America that attacks species of spruce (Picea spp.) and pine (Pinus spp.). Young <b>Sitka</b> <b>spruce</b> [Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr. ] trees are {{particularly}} susceptible to weevil attack. Pockets of naturally occurring <b>Sitka</b> <b>spruce</b> resistance {{have been identified in}} high weevil hazard areas in coastal British Columbia. In this study, we characterize behavioral, physiological and reproductive responses of weevils to an extremely resistant <b>Sitka</b> <b>spruce</b> genotype (H 898) in comparison to a highly susceptible genotype (Q 903). The experiments relied on a large number of three-year-old clonally propagated trees and were therefore restricted to two contrasting <b>Sitka</b> <b>spruce</b> genotypes. When exposed to resistant trees, both male and female weevils were deterred during host selection and mating, females showed delayed or reduced ovary development, and successful reproduction of weevils was prevented on resistant trees...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} results concerning {{climatic conditions}} affecting diameter growth of <b>Sitka</b> <b>spruce</b> introduced to Baltic Pomerania (Sławno Forest District). A relatively high homogeneity of tree-ring series permitted to construct on their basis the tree-ring chronology of <b>Sitka</b> <b>spruce.</b> A significant positive correlation {{was found between}} radial increments of <b>Sitka</b> <b>spruce</b> and air tem-peratures of winter and spring months (January-April) and a negative relationship between radial in-crements and temperature of May. This study also showed a distinctly positive correlation between diameter growth and precipitation in July and November of the previous year, and precipitation in February and in summer season (June-August) of the current year. During years with low precipita-tion in summer or low temperatures in winter and spring all trees produced narrow tree-rings. The proportion of air temperature and precipitation in variation of radial increment of <b>Sitka</b> <b>spruce,</b> ex-pressed by the coefficient of multiple determination, was 52 %...|$|R

40|$|Iceland has {{suffered}} from massive deforestation since the Vikings settled on the island in 874. The woodland cover has gone from 25 - 30 % to 1 %. Since {{the beginning of the}} 20 th century, effort has been made to regain the forest. In these afforestation efforts many tree species have been used both indigenous and exotic. Coniferous species have {{played a major role in}} this afforestation. Species such as Siberian larch, Norway <b>spruce,</b> <b>Sitka</b> <b>spruce</b> and various pine species have been important in these efforts. The two spruce species mentioned earlier have both been very important in the afforestation of Iceland. However, the usage of Norway spruce has declined through time whereas usage of <b>Sitka</b> <b>spruce</b> has increased. This study was carried out in a forested area in West Iceland owned by the Icelandic forest service. The aim of the study was to find out how much yield difference is between Norway <b>spruce</b> and <b>Sitka</b> <b>spruce</b> in this area. The result shows a very big difference between those species and in all aspects the <b>Sitka</b> <b>spruce</b> has higher values.

40|$|Conifers possess {{inducible}} terpenoid defense systems. These {{systems are}} associated with the formation of traumatic resin ducts (TRD) and are underpinned by enhanced gene expression and activity of terpene synthases (TPS), enzymes responsible for oleoresin formation. We first determined that <b>Sitka</b> <b>spruce</b> (Picea sitchensis [Bong. ] Carriere) had the capacity for TRD formation by mechanically wounding representative trees. We then proceeded to investigate whether the white pine weevil (Pissodes strobi Peck.), a stem-boring insect, can influence the expression of genes encoding monoterpene synthases (mono-tps) in <b>Sitka</b> <b>spruce.</b> We went on to compare this response with the effects of a simulated insect attack by drill wounding. A significant increase in mono-tps transcript level was observed in the leaders of lateral branches of weevil-attacked and mechanically wounded trees. In this study, weevils induced a more rapid enhancement of mono-tps gene expression. A full-length <b>Sitka</b> <b>spruce</b> mono-tps cDNA (PsTPS 2) was isolated, expressed in Escherichia coli, and functionally identified as (—) -pinene synthase. The recombinant (—) -pinene synthase catalyzes the formation of (—) -α-pinene and (—) -β-pinene, both of which are known constituents of stem oleoresin in <b>Sitka</b> <b>spruce</b> and increase in abundance after weevil attack. These data suggest that increased (—) -pinene synthase gene expression is an important element of the direct defense system deployed in <b>Sitka</b> <b>spruce</b> after insect attack...|$|R
