40|$|The {{debate about}} {{behavioral}} economics â€“ {{the incorporation of}} insights from psychology into economics â€“ is often framed as {{a question about the}} foundational assumptions of economic models. This paper presents a more pragmatic perspective on behavioral economics that focuses on its value for improving empirical predictions and policy decisions. I discuss three ways in which behavioral economics can contribute to public policy: by offering new policy tools, improving predictions about the effects of existing policies, and generating new welfare implications. I illustrate these contributions using applications to retirement savings, labor supply, and neighborhood choice. Behavioral models provide new tools to change behaviors such as savings rates and new counterfactuals to estimate the effects of policies such as income taxation. Behavioral models also provide new prescriptions for optimal policy that can be characterized in a non-paternalistic manner using methods analogous to those in neoclassical models. Model uncertainty does not justify using the neoclassical model; instead, it can provide a new rationale for using behavioral nudges. I conclude that incorporating behavioral features to the extent they help answer core economic questions may be more productive than viewing behavioral economics as a <b>separate</b> <b>subfield</b> that challenges the assumptions of neoclassical models...|$|R
40|$|As a {{relatively}} young {{field of research}} and development started by work on cryptanalysis and machine translation around 50 years ago, Natural Language Processing (NLP) is concerned with the automated processing of human language. It addresses the analysis and generation of written and spoken language, though speech processing is often regarded as a <b>separate</b> <b>subfield.</b> NLP emphasizes processing and applications and as such {{can be seen as the}} applied side of Computational Linguistics, the interdisciplinary field of research concerned with for-mal analysis and modeling of language and its applications at the intersection of Linguistics, Computer Science, and Psychology. In terms of the language aspects dealt with in NLP, traditionally lexical, morphological and syntactic aspects of language were at the center of attention, but aspects of meaning, discourse, and the relation to the extra-linguistic context have become increasingly prominent in the last decade. A good introduction and overview of the field is provided in Jurafsky & Martin (2009). This article explores the relevance and uses of NLP in the context of language learning, focusing on written language. As a concise characterization of this emergent subfield, the discussion will focus on motivating the relevance, characterizing the techniques, and delin-eating the uses of NLP; more historical background and discussion can be found in Nerbonn...|$|R
40|$|Directionally {{selective}} (DS) neurons {{are found}} in the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of rabbits and rodents. In rabbits, LGN DS cells project to primary visual cortex. Here, we compare visual response properties of LGN DS neurons with those of layer 4 simple cells, most of which show strong direction/orientation selectivity. The response properties of these populations differed dramatically, suggesting that DS cells may not contribute significantly to the synthesis of simple receptive fields: (a) whereas the F 1 /F 0 ratios of LGN DS cells are strongly nonlinear, those of simple cells are strongly linear, (b) whereas LGN DS cells have overlapped ON/OFF subfields, simple cells have either a single ON or OFF subfield, or two spatially <b>separate</b> <b>subfields,</b> and (c) whereas the preferred directions of LGN DS cells are closely tied to the four cardinal directions, the directional preferences of simple cells are more evenly distributed. We further show that directional selectivity in LGN DS neurons is strongly enhanced by alertness via two mechanisms, (a) an increase in responses to stimulation in the preferred direction and (b) an enhanced suppression of responses to stimuli moving in the null direction. Finally, our simulations show that these two consequences of alertness could each serve, in a vector-based population code, to hasten the computation of stimulus direction when rabbits become alert...|$|R
40|$|Since their {{commercial}} introduction in 1996, {{genetically modified}} (GM) crops {{have been adopted}} by farmers around the world at impressive rates. In 2011, 180 million hectares of GM crops were cultivated by more than 15 million farmers in 29 countries. In the next decade, global adoption {{is expected to grow}} even faster as the research pipeline for new biotech traits and crops has increased almost fourfold in the last few years. The adoption of GM crops has led to increased productivity, while reducing pesticide use and the emissions of agricultural greenhouse gases, leading to broadly distributed economic benefits across the global food supply chain. Despite the rapid uptake of GM crops, the various social and economic benefits as well as the expanding rate innovation, the use of GM crops remains controversial in parts of the world. Despite the emergence of coexistence between GM, organic and conventional crops as a key policy and practical issue of global scale, there is no coherent literature that addresses it directly. Governments and market stakeholders in many countries are grappling with policy alternatives that settle conflicting property rights, minimize negative market externalities and associated liabilities, maximize the economic benefits of innovation and allow producer and consumer choice. This book intends to fill these needs with contributions from the top theoreticians, legal and economic analysts, policy makers and industry practitioners in the field. As the economics and policy of coexistence start to emerge as an <b>separate</b> <b>subfield</b> in agricultural, environmental and natural resource economics with an increasing number of scholars working on the topic, the book will also provide a comprehensive base in the literature for those entering the area, making it of interest to students, scholars and policy-makers alike...|$|R
40|$|Comparative Political Theory (CPT) {{focuses on}} {{political}} ideas of non-western thinkers and compares these to their western counterparts. In recent years, works of CPT {{have demonstrated that}} a comparative perspective allows {{us to see the}} many parallels in the theoretical projects of western and non-western thinkers. This approach towards political theorizing opens up previously unexplored avenues {{to gain a better understanding}} of the political. CPT has also strongly challenged traditional western political theorists, and political scientists alike, to reconsider the validity of several existing theories about the political. This is a result of CPT?s awareness of the bias introduced by western dominance in a globalized world. Works of CPT attempt to neutralize this power imbalance between the west and the rest by attempting to revitalize the non-west in terms of its self-understanding. This dissertation argues that a comparative perspective must be adopted in political theory, because, while it helps us to interpret non-western ideas it also allows us to understand how the west has come to its present self-understanding. Hence, unlike previous comparative works which argue for CPT as a <b>separate</b> <b>subfield</b> of political theory in the west, this dissertation brings the CPT enterprise to the center of the vocational landscape of the western political theory. The dissertation supports this claim by presenting an in-depth analysis of four cases of east-west encounters in the pre- Enlightenment period. The analysis is based on several primary and secondary sources from the western and non-western civilizations which span a period of over four centuries. The significance of the dissertation is distributed along four dimensions. First, it presents a comprehensive review and critique of scholarship done by comparative theorists till now. Second, it highlights additional points of significance attached to the integral role of the non-west in the construction of the west itself. Third, it extends the range of comparative analyses to the pre and early modern periods. Fourth, it considers actual cases of east-west encounters as against CPT?s exclusive focus on constructing imaginary inter-civilizational dialogues...|$|R
40|$|Research in the {{psychology}} of science has typically fallen into <b>separate,</b> isolated <b>subfields</b> within psychology. This chapter examines two models that tie together social and cognitive psychological variables important {{in the development of}} innovation in multidisciplinary science teams, separately considering convergent versus divergent creative processes. The models are theoretically examined from the perspective of explicit and implicit elements. The chapter then draws on a recent study examining the moment-‐by-‐moment interplay of conflict (a social variable) and analogy (a cognitive variable) in a real-‐world multidisciplinary science team to examine the empirical nature of connections between social and cognitive models. While both conflict and analogies can be implicit and explicit simultaneously, the significant connections between these two variables seem to be mainly implicit, drawing on underlying knowledge structures and differences. Paletz & Schunn 3 Implicit and Explicit Processes in Cognitive/Social Psychology of Science To what extent are key psychological processes of science implicit or explicit?

Despite the amount of {{interest}} in the field, it seems to have grown <b>separate</b> from other <b>subfields</b> of population genetics and evolution. In the current work I introduce the concept of Fisher's (1930) reproductive value into the study of evolution on graphs. Reproductive value {{is a measure of the}} expected genetic contribution of an individual to a distant future generation. In a heterogeneous graph-structured population, differences in the number of connections among individuals translates into differences in the expected number of offspring, even if all individuals have the same fecundity. These differences are accounted for by reproductive value. The introduction of reproductive value permits the calculation of the fixation probability of a mutant in a neutral evolutionary process in any graph-structured population for either the moran birth-death or death-birth process...|$|R
40|$|Biological and {{physical}} sciences possess a long-standing tradition of cooperativity as <b>separate</b> but related <b>subfields</b> of science.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{field of}} {{international}} law often is taught and {{thought of as a}} group of disconnected substantive subfields, each with its own epistemic community. These specialized subfields range from international human rights law to the law of the sea, from international trade law to collective security law. Examples where subfields conflict with each other and <b>separate</b> examples where <b>subfields</b> complement each other have led two camps of commentators over the past decade to comprehensively define international law’s nature as either united or fragmented in a binary fashion. Even the United Nations’ International Law Commission established a study group to explore this topic, which concluded in 2006 after over four years of study that international law is fragmented due, in part, to the collision of various branches {{of international law}}. Efforts of both camps to articulate a complete theory that largely ignores or severely downplays the examples of the other camp creates disturbing anomalies, or rather antinomies, which “requires a reexamination of our fundamental premises” if one assumes the accuracy of one of the two camps. This Article, which reflects the core theme of a forthcoming monograph by the corresponding author, does not attempt to definitively resolve this perennial debate over the nature of international law in such an all-or-nothing binary fashion. Rather, it takes a more nuanced, middle-ground approach by exploring how two subfields of international law – here, international health law and international climate change law – simultaneously conflict with and complement each other...|$|R
