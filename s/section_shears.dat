40|$|Techniques for {{modelling}} {{the seismic}} response of concrete structures {{are limited by}} {{the accuracy of the}} material models. Current models for reinforced concrete subjected to shear typically do not account for the effects of cracking and yielding. Diagonal cracking has a very pronounced effect on the shear stiffness of concrete structures, however, recommendations for cracked <b>section</b> <b>shear</b> stiffness are not readily available. The plastic strain of reinforcement is another important parameter that must be considered in the nonlinear seismic shear analysis of reinforced concrete. There is a strong relationship between plastic strain of reinforcement and plastic shear strain, e. g. yielding of the reinforcement results in yielding in shear of the element. Pinching of hysteresis loops is directly linked to the plastic strain in reinforcement, as is the deviation of principal compression stress and principal compression strain angles in concrete. The authors have recently developed a general model to predict the complete load-deformation response of reinforced concrete elements subjected to reverse-cyclic shear. A unique feature of the model is that deformations at the cracks are separated from deformations of concrete between cracks, and crack deformations are assumed to be a consequence of strain compatibility between concrete and reinforcement. This paper presents simplified methods for modelling the non-linear seismic shear response of reinforced concrete based on the underlying principles of the general model. The methods include an effective cracke...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the {{structural}} behaviour of high-rise buildings subjected to transversal loads expressed in terms of shears and torsional moments. As horizontal reinforcement, the resistant skeleton of the construction can be composed by different vertical bracings, such as shear walls, braced frames and thin-walled open section profiles, having constant or variable geometrical properties along the height. In this way, most of the traditional structural schemes can be modelled, from moment resisting frames up to outrigger and tubular systems. In particular, an entire chapter is addressed to the case of thin-walled open <b>section</b> <b>shear</b> walls which are defined by a coupled flexural-torsional behaviour, as described by Vlasov's theory of the sectorial areas. From the analytical point of view, the three-dimensional formulation proposed by Al. Carpinteri and An. Carpinteri (1985) is considered and extended in order to perform dynamic analyses and encompass innovative structural solutions which can twist and taper from the bottom {{to the top of the}} building. Such approach is based on the hypothesis of in-plane infinitely rigid floors which assure the connection between the vertical bracings and, consequently, reduce the number of degrees of freedom being only three for each level. By means of it, relevant design information such as the floor displacements, the external load distribution between the structural components, the internal actions, the free vibrations as well as the mode shapes can be quickly obtained. The clearness and the conciseness of the matrix formulation allow to devise a simple computer program which, starting from basic information as the building geometry, the number and type of vertical stiffening, the material properties and the intensity of the external forces, provides essential results for preliminary design...|$|R
