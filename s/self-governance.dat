5|$|Tripura sends two {{representatives to}} the Lok Sabha (the {{lower house of}} the {{parliament}} of India) and one representative to the Rajya Sabha (parliament's upper house). Panchayats (local self-governments) elected by local body elections are present in many villages for <b>self-governance.</b> Tripura also has a unique tribal <b>self-governance</b> body, the Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council. This council is responsible for some aspects of local governance in 527 villages with high density of the scheduled tribes.|$|E
5|$|Kriegseisen also {{remarks that}} there is a myth about the {{uniqueness}} of sejmiks to Poland, and notes that similar institutions of <b>self-governance</b> and regional parliamentary participation by nobility can be found in other places, such as in Hungary and various German provinces (Silesia, Prussia, Brandenburg).|$|E
5|$|For <b>self-governance</b> purposes, {{the city}} is divided into 17 boroughs, {{each of which has}} its own mayor (starosta) and council. The number of councillors in each depends on the size and {{population}} of the borough. Each of the boroughs coincides with the city's 20 cadastral areas, except for two cases: Nové Mesto is further divided into the Nové Mesto and Vinohrady cadastral areas and Ružinov is divided into Ružinov, Nivy and Trnávka. Further unofficial division recognizes additional quarters and localities.|$|E
5|$|Korçë {{belongs to}} the region {{regarded}} as Northern Epirus, a region with substantial Albanian, Aromanian and Greek populations. The Greek national view was to classify all Aromanians and Orthodox Albanians {{as part of the}} Greek minority. The Great Powers signed the Protocol of Florence and awarded the region to the newly founded Principality of Albania on December 17, 1913. Gradual withdrawal of the Greek army would enable the Albanian forces {{to take control of the}} region. Consequently, to avert this possibility, pro-Greek Epirotes decided to declare their own separate political identity and <b>self-governance.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1843 Sam Houston's Texas {{administration}} had returned to negotiations with the Mexican government to consider a rapprochement that would permit Texas <b>self-governance,</b> possibly as a state of Mexico, with Great Britain acting as mediator. Texas officials felt compelled {{by the fact that}} the Tyler administration appeared unequipped to mount an effective campaign for Texas annexation. With the 1844 general election in the United States approaching, the leadership in both the Democratic and Whig parties remained unequivocally anti-Texas. Texas-Mexico treaty options under consideration included an autonomous Texas within Mexico's borders, or an independent republic with the provision that Texas should emancipate its slaves upon recognition.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{conditions}} set out by Tikhon's decree for this temporary autonomy not being met, the American diocese of the Russian church declared <b>self-governance</b> in 1924, against the protests of the patriarchate, {{with which it}} had communication and which was capable of governance had its American branch been willing. The refusal of the American branch {{to submit to the}} patriarchate thus based itself officially on a document whose conditions it had not met. In reality, however, it was a fear of Communism and a belief that the patriarchate had been compromised which fueled the rebellion, paired with a desire {{on the part of the}} Metropolia to dissociate itself from the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR) of which it had been part.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{declaration}} of <b>self-governance,</b> Kedrovsky and the Living Church were awarded the Church's diocesan cathedral in New York City. To prevent further loss of property, the diocese allowed individual parishes to take ownership of their properties, which made them effectively independent. This, combined with {{the increasing number of}} ethnic parishes aligning themselves with other Orthodox jurisdictions (as well as some non-Orthodox), led to a unique situation in Orthodox America whereby multiple jurisdictions overlapped geographically. The remainder of the American Church became known informally as the Metropolia (or {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Metropolitan). Following Patriarch Tikhon's death, the Russian Orthodox Church, led by Metropolitan Sergius, began cooperating with the Soviet government. In 1933, the Russian Church declared the Metropolia to be schismatic.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, in February 1947, Prime Minister Clement Attlee {{announced}} that the British government would grant full <b>self-governance</b> to British India by June 1948 at the latest. On 3 June 1947, the British government {{announced that}} the principle of division of British India into two independent states was accepted. The successor governments would be given dominion status and would have an implicit right to secede from the British Commonwealth. Viceroy Mountbatten chose 15 August, {{the second anniversary of}} Japan's surrender in the World War II, as the date of power transfer. He chose 14 August as the date of the ceremony of power transfer to Pakistan because he wanted to attend the ceremonies in both India and Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Ryzhkov {{was one of}} {{the founders}} of the CPRF-led {{alliance}} of leftists and nationalists known as the People's Patriotic Union of Russia (PPUR) and was elected chairman of its Duma faction. The PPUR's formal leaders were Ryzhkov and Ziuganov, who was an unofficial leader. In September 2003, Ryzhkov entered the Federation Council of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation as the representative for Belgorod Oblast, subsequently resigning his seat in the State Duma. He currently serves as Chairman of the Federation Council Commission on Natural Monopolies, as a member of the Committee on Local <b>Self-Governance</b> and as co-chairman of the Russian–Armenian commission on inter-parliamentary cooperation.|$|E
5|$|In early 1947 the French {{administration}} {{instituted a}} new rule that increased {{the weight of}} the French vote over the Malagasy vote in selection of candidates, and three PADESM candidates favored by French conservatives were successfully elected to the Conseil de la Republique. The results of the election and popular discontent with French interference served to intensify widespread frustration against the colonial authority and desire for Malagasy <b>self-governance</b> across the island. These factors finally erupted in a nationalist uprising that began on the evening of 29 March 1947 with attacks against a police camp and several French plantations in the eastern rainforest carried out by militant Malagasy nationalists, chief among them the members of the nationalist secret societies Vy Vato Sakelika (VVS) and Jiny.|$|E
5|$|The {{system of}} local <b>self-governance,</b> which Article12 of the Constitution of Russia guarantees, is {{implemented}} on the republic's territory {{in accordance with}} the provisions of Federal Law No.131-FZ On the General Principles of the Organization of the Local Self-Government in the Russian Federation. While the law does not require any connection between the system of the administrative-territorial divisions of a federal subject and its municipal structure, Adygea's administrative districts are nevertheless incorporated as the municipal districts and the republican urban okrugs are incorporated as the municipal urban okrugs. On the lower level, the municipal districts are divided into municipal urban settlements, which combine an urban-type settlement and adjacent rural localities, and municipal rural settlements, which combine several neighboring rural localities.|$|E
5|$|Atrash {{was born}} 3 February 1925 in the Druze {{community}} of al-Qurayya in Jabal al-Druze (Jabal al-Arab), {{months before the}} Great Syrian Revolt, which was launched and led by his father Sultan al-Atrash. At the time, the Jabal al-Druze area constituted an autonomous zone (existing between 1922 and 1936) within the French Mandate of Syria (established in 1920). Tensions between the Druze and the French authorities stemmed {{from a number of}} reasons, particularly what the local Druze leaders saw as French encroachment into their domestic affairs and <b>self-governance.</b> The revolt began in the summer of 1925 and had soon spread throughout Syria, ending with the military defeat of Syrian rebels in 1927 and the self-imposed exile of Sultan to Transjordan after the Mandatory authorities issued a warrant for his arrest. He returned in 1937 after being pardoned by the authorities.|$|E
5|$|From 1983 to 1993, Arafat based {{himself in}} Tunisia, {{and began to}} shift his {{approach}} from open conflict with the Israelis to negotiation. In 1988, he acknowledged Israel's right to exist and sought a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. In 1994 he returned to Palestine, settling in Gaza City and promoting <b>self-governance</b> for the Palestinian territories. He engaged {{in a series of}} negotiations with the Israeli government to end the conflict between it and the PLO. These included the Madrid Conference of 1991, the 1993 Oslo Accords and the 2000 Camp David Summit. In 1994 Arafat received the Nobel Peace Prize, together with Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, for the negotiations at Oslo. At the time, Fatah's support among the Palestinians declined with the growth of Hamas and other militant rivals. In late 2004, after effectively being confined within his Ramallah compound for over two years by the Israeli army, Arafat fell into a coma and died. While the cause of Arafat's death has remained the subject of speculation, investigations by Russian and French teams determined no foul play was involved.|$|E
5|$|From {{that date}} on, through the Age of Discovery, European {{colonization}} brought extensive American territory {{under the control}} of Europe's monarchs, though the majority of these colonies subsequently gained independence from their rulers. Some did so via armed conflict with their mother countries, as in the American Revolution and the Latin American wars of independence, usually severing all ties to the overseas monarchies in the process. Others gained full sovereignty by legislative paths, such as Canada's patriation of its constitution from the United Kingdom. A certain number of former colonies became republics immediately upon achieving <b>self-governance.</b> The remainder continued with endemic constitutional monarchies—in the cases of Haiti, Mexico, and Brazil—with their own resident monarch and, for places such as Canada and some island states in the Caribbean, sharing their monarch with their former metropole, the most recently created being that of Belize in 1981.|$|E
5|$|Roughly 30% of {{the student}} body belongs to a social {{fraternity}} or sorority, with additional students involved in professional, service, and honor fraternities. Many of the university's fraternities and sororities are residential, meaning they own or rent a house for their members to use; many of these houses are located on Rugby Road and the surrounding streets, just north of the university. Additionally, three social fraternities hold reserved rooms on the Lawn and the Range: Kappa Sigma in Room 46 East Lawn, Trigon Engineering Society in Room 17 West Lawn, and Pi Kappa Alpha in Room 47 West Range. Reflecting UVA's tradition of student <b>self-governance,</b> the system is currently governed by four Greek Councils consisting of student leaders; however, it is also overseen by the Department of Fraternity and Sorority Life in the university's Office of the Dean of Students.|$|E
5|$|The local {{government}} bodies; Panchayat, Municipalities and Corporations have existed in Kerala since 1959, however, the major initiative to decentralise the governance {{was started in}} 1993, conforming to the constitutional amendments of central government in this direction. With the enactment of Kerala Panchayati Raj Act and Kerala Municipality Act in 1994, the state implemented reforms in local <b>self-governance.</b> The Kerala Panchayati Raj Act envisages a 3-tier system of {{local government}} with Gram panchayat, Block panchayat and District Panchayat forming a hierarchy. The acts ensure a clear demarcation of power among these institutions. However, the Kerala Municipality Act envisages a single-tier system for urban areas, with the institution of municipality designed to par with the Gram panchayat of the former system. Substantial administrative, legal and financial powers are delegated to these bodies to ensure efficient decentralisation. As per the present norms, the state government devolves about 40 per cent of the state plan outlay to the local government.|$|E
5|$|Voting is {{regarded}} as key to representative democracy, which requires that the leaders of a country are elected by the people. The basis of this concept is that everyone should be treated equally and everyone has equal rights. Every person, therefore, {{has a right to}} one vote, and no more, in the choice of representatives. The right to vote is a primary right, a right of fundamental importance by which other rights are protected. It is one of the important bulwarks of a representative democracy and in this regard, the ballot box is the people's ultimate mechanism to control the shaping of government policies. However, it must be recognized that voting is not an infallible litmus test for democracy; rather, it functions as a procedural device that is normally regarded as the best instrument for securing the ideal of <b>self-governance.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite Arnold's successes, he {{was passed}} over for {{promotion}} by the Continental Congress, while other officers claimed credit for some of his accomplishments. Adversaries in military and political circles brought charges of corruption or other malfeasance, but most often he was acquitted in formal inquiries. Congress investigated his accounts and concluded that he was indebted to Congress (he also {{had spent much of}} his own money on the war effort). Arnold was frustrated and bitter at this, {{as well as with the}} alliance with France and the failure of Congress to accept Britain's 1778 proposal to grant full <b>self-governance</b> in the colonies. He decided to change sides, and opened secret negotiations with the British. In July 1780, he was awarded command of West Point. His scheme was to surrender the fort to the British, but it was exposed when American forces captured British Major John André carrying papers which revealed the plot. Upon learning of André's capture, Arnold fled down the Hudson River to the British sloop-of-war Vulture, narrowly avoiding capture by the forces of George Washington, who had been alerted to the plot.|$|E
5|$|Richardson {{met with}} some initial success {{in his new}} role, {{learning}} Samoan and implementing a number of reforms. He focussed on transforming the country's economy into one based upon agriculture with a long term view of Samoan <b>self-governance,</b> and also implemented welfare and educational programs. His results were such that his term of three years in Western Samoa was extended by a further two years. He was also knighted, being made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the June 1925 Birthday Honours. However, {{over the next two}} years he had to deal with the increasing influence of the Mau movement, a nationalist group agitating for independence via peaceful means. While his administrative experience was helpful for carrying the reforms he had initiated, he lacked the political and diplomatic skills to deal with the Mau. He took a heavy handed approach to asserting his authority and deported several leaders of the Mau. This did not have the desired effect and dissent amongst the general population towards the New Zealand administration only increased. Richardson was forced to call in marines from the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy to deal with the civil unrest. Shortly afterwards, on 31 March 1928, he retired. Later in the year he was the New Zealand representative to the League of Nations meeting which discussed the administration of Western Samoa.|$|E
25|$|Czech {{universities}} {{have a long}} tradition of <b>self-governance</b> and independence from state interference, which goes back to the Middle Ages. Today, <b>self-governance</b> is assured by the University Education Act No. 111/1998 (the Act deals only with public universities). The following governance bodies are similar for all Czech public universities.|$|E
25|$|After Lim succeeded as Chief Minister, his top {{priority}} was to achieve full <b>self-governance</b> for Singapore from the British Government. The British {{had taken to}} account Singapore's future early during Marshall's tenure as Chief Minister. The British had agreed to Malaya's (Malaysia's predecessor) independence, and due to the strategic value of Singapore's geography, the British wanted to continue taking control over foreign and defence affairs of Singapore. Hence, the British are inclined to granting Singapore <b>self-governance</b> instead of independence. Though Sir Robert Black, the then-Governor had taken a more open and friendly approach to <b>self-governance</b> for Singapore, as compared to his predecessor Sir John Nicoll, he believed in gradual <b>self-governance.</b> If the handover of power were {{to be carried out}} too hastily, self-governing political leaders might not have sufficient experience in governing.|$|E
25|$|In {{some regions}} provincial States-General also {{continued}} {{to meet and}} legislate {{with a measure of}} <b>self-governance</b> and control over taxation within their jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|The Wichita tribe is {{headquartered}} in Anadarko, Oklahoma. Their tribal jurisdictional area is in Caddo County, Oklahoma. The Wichitas are a <b>self-governance</b> tribe, who operate their own housing authority and issue tribal vehicle tags.|$|E
25|$|December 4 – A {{contentious}} government-proposed local <b>self-governance</b> {{reform plan}} triggers more controversy after {{the head of}} the Georgian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Ilia II, denounces it as a threat to Georgia's integrity.|$|E
25|$|In 1887 a new {{constitution}} including the right of <b>self-governance</b> was drafted and in 1890, the Act granting self-government {{was passed by the}} British House of Commons and assented to by Queen Victoria.|$|E
25|$|Malta's Police Force (MPF) {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} in Europe, with the Maltese {{government}} taking over the force in 1921, following the grant of <b>self-governance.</b> Currently, there are approximately 1,900 members in the Force.|$|E
25|$|The British, {{on their}} part, were {{prepared}} {{to embark on a}} program of gradually increasing <b>self-governance</b> for Singapore and Malaya, although the British wanted to retain control of Singapore because of Singapore’s important port facilities and resources of rubber.|$|E
25|$|In 1887, a new {{constitution}} was drafted, providing for the right of <b>self-governance</b> of European Australians and in 1890, the act granting self-government to the colony {{was passed by the}} British Parliament. John Forrest became the first Premier of Western Australia.|$|E
25|$|The Canary Islands {{obtained}} <b>self-governance</b> in 1912. In 1927, Fuerteventura and Lanzarote {{became part}} of the province of Gran Canaria. The seat of the island's government (cabildo insular) is located in Puerto del Rosario. A total of 74,983 people lived on the island in 2003.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{federalism}} {{provides some}} <b>self-governance</b> for local matters {{in order to}} satisfy some of the grievances which might cause ethnic conflict among the masses. Moreover, federalism brings in the elites and ethnic entrepreneurs into the central power structure; this prevents a resurgence of top-down ethnic conflict.|$|E
25|$|On 29 August 2009, the Gilgit Baltistan Empowerment and <b>Self-Governance</b> Order, 2009, {{was passed}} by the Pakistani cabinet and later signed by the President of Pakistan. The order granted self-rule {{to the people of the}} former Northern Areas, now renamed Gilgit Baltistan, by creating, among other things, an elected {{legislative}} assembly.|$|E
25|$|The <b>self-governance</b> of Singapore {{was carried}} out in several stages. Since Singapore's {{founding}} in 1819, Singapore had been under the colonial rule of the United Kingdom. The first local elections on a limited scale for several positions in the government of Singapore started in 1948 following an amendment to the Constitution of Singapore.|$|E
25|$|As part of IFC or {{national}} organization <b>self-governance,</b> or University disciplinary action, chapters may be suspended ("de-recognized") or closed for a time. When a chapter is closed and/or forfeits its housing, {{it will be}} listed as a dormant chapter. See the Office for Fraternity and Sorority Life (OFSL) for current recognized IFC members.|$|E
25|$|The Jamtish people {{maintained}} some <b>self-governance.</b> The Jamtamót {{had been}} transformed into a Danish landsting in the early 16th century. Even though it was banned in the end of the same century, it continued to be held in secret. After the transition to Sweden some parts were transmitted into a Swedish landsjämnadsting.|$|E
25|$|On 3 June 1959, he officially {{stepped down}} as Chief Minister. The British officially proclaimed the {{establishment}} of the State of Singapore, marking the end of British colonial rule. PAP's Secretary-General Lee Kuan Yew was sworn in on 5 June as the first Prime Minister of Singapore, where Singapore came under full internal <b>self-governance.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Singapore Progressive Party (SPP), a {{political}} party with a progressive platform {{of working with the}} British for gradual reform and <b>self-governance,</b> won half of the seats. This was technically a plurality, as independent candidates won the other three: the SPP became the ruling party of the local representation. The majority of seats were still appointed by the colonial administration.|$|E
