30|$|This paper {{deals with}} video coding of static scenes viewed by a moving camera. We propose an {{automatic}} way to encode such video sequences using several 3 D models. Contrary to prior art in model-based coding where 3 D models {{have to be}} known, the 3 D models are automatically computed from the original video sequence. We show that several independent 3 D models provide the same functionalities as one single 3 D model, and avoid some drawbacks of the previous approaches. To achieve this goal we propose a novel algorithm of <b>sliding</b> <b>adjustment,</b> which ensures consistency of successive 3 D models. The paper presents a method to automatically extract the set of 3 D models and associate camera positions. The obtained representation {{can be used for}} reconstructing the original sequence, or virtual ones. It also enables 3 D functionalities such as synthetic object insertion, lightning modification, or stereoscopic visualization. Results on real video sequences are presented.|$|E
40|$|In the hawkmoth Manduca sexta, {{pheromone}} stimuli {{of different}} strength and duration rise the intracellular Ca 2 + concentration in olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). While second-long pheromone stimuli activate protein kinase C (PKC), which apparently underlies processes of short-term adaptation, minute-long pheromone stimuli elevate {{cyclic guanosine monophosphate}} (cGMP) concentrations, which correlates with time courses of long-term adaptation. To identify ion channels involved in the <b>sliding</b> <b>adjustment</b> of olfactory sensitivity, inside-out patch clamp recordings on cultured ORNs of M. sexta were performed to characterize Ca 2 +-, PKC-, and cGMP-dependent ion channels. Stepping to positive holding potentials in high intracellular Ca 2 + elicits different Ca 2 +-dependent ion channels, namely small-conductance channels (2 – 20 ps), mediumconductance channels (20 – 100 ps), and large-conductance channels (> 100 ps). Ion channels of 40, 60, and 70 ps opened after PKC activation, whereas 10 - and> 100 -ps channels were observed less frequently. Application of 8 -bromo cyclic guanosine monophosphate opened 55 - and 70 -ps channels and increased the open probability of> 100 -ps channels, whereas even {{in the presence of}} phorbol ester 40 -ps channels were inhibited. Thus, cGMP elevations activate a different set of ion channels as compared with PKC and suppress at least one PKC-dependent ion channel.

40|$|Calling female moths attract {{their mates}} {{late at night}} with {{intermittent}} release of a species-specific sex-pheromone blend. Mean frequency of pheromone filaments encodes distance to the calling female. In their zig-zagging upwind search male moths encounter turbulent pheromone blend filaments at highly variable concentrations and frequencies. The male moth antennae are delicately designed to detect and distinguish even traces of these sex pheromones amongst the abundance of other odors. Its olfactory receptor neurons sense even single pheromone molecules and track intermittent pheromone filaments of highly variable frequencies up to about 30 [*]Hz over a wide concentration range. In the hawkmoth Manduca sexta brief, weak pheromone stimuli as encountered during flight are detected via a metabotropic PLCβ-dependent signal transduction cascade which leads to transient changes in intracellular Ca 2 + concentrations. Strong or long pheromone stimuli, which are possibly perceived {{in direct contact with}} the female, activate receptor-guanylyl cyclases causing long-term adaptation. In addition, depending on endogenous rhythms of the moth's physiological state, hormones such as the stress hormone octopamine modulate second messenger levels in sensory neurons. High octopamine levels during the activity phase maximize temporal resolution cAMP-dependently as a prerequisite to mate location. Thus, I suggest that <b>sliding</b> <b>adjustment</b> of odor response threshold and kinetics is based upon relative concentration ratios of intracellular Ca 2 + and cyclic nucleotide levels which gate different ion channels synergistically. In addition, I propose a new hypothesis for the cyclic nucleotide-dependent ion channel formed by insect olfactory receptor/coreceptor complexes. Instead of being employed for an ionotropic mechanism of odor detection it is proposed to control subthreshold membrane potential oscillation of sensory neurons, as a basis for temporal encoding of odors...|$|E

40|$|There {{is a large}} {{repertoire}} for the (French) horn yet it {{is mostly}} confined to standard tuning systems. Development of new repertoire, as demonstrated in this thesis, may assist in bringing non-standard tunings out of the margins and into the mainstream. A significant compositional resource {{is provided by the}} available harmonics of the standard double horn, 13 - 24 on each of 16 tube lengths, along with traditional techniques of lip, right hand and valve <b>slide</b> <b>adjustments.</b> The performance of compositions in extended just in tonation is discovered to be within the realm of expertise of players using standard brass instruments. A deeper understanding of the use of harmonics produced on lip vibrated instruments or labrosones is gained by classifying them according to just intonation prime-limits. The use of harmonics is therefore linked with the long and rich tradition of just intonation and other microtonal exploration. A method specifically for training horn players in extended just intonation completes this thesis...|$|R

The <b>slide's</b> pitch <b>adjustment</b> on a single partial is approximately the interval of a tritone on a slide length of over 80 centimeters. The trombonist may use his/her ear to minutely adjust pitch on sustained notes. By coincidence, the position of the bell on most trombones provides a reference for third position, but this is not accessible during fast passages. Articulation is also an important consideration when playing trombone: imprecise articulation may add unwanted glissando to a note not requiring it.|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{framework}} for operator guidance during the image acquisition process for reliable multi-view stereo reconstruction. Goal is to achieve full coverage of the object and sufficient overlap. Multi-view stereo is a commonly used method to reconstruct both camera trajectory and 3 D object shape. After determining an initial solution, a globally optimal reconstruction is usually obtained by executing a bundle adjustment involving all images. Acquiring suitable images, however, still requires an experienced operator to ensure accuracy and completeness of the final solution. We propose an interactive framework for guiding unexperienced users or possibly an autonomous robot. Using approximate camera orientations and object points we estimate point uncertainties within a <b>sliding</b> bundle <b>adjustment</b> and suggest appropriate camera movements. A visual feedback system communicates the decisions to the user in an intuitive way. We demonstrate the suitability of our system with a virtual image acquisition simulation {{as well as in}} real-world scenarios. We show that when following the camera movements suggested by our system, the proposed framework is able to generate good approximate values for the bundle adjustment, leading to accurate results compared to ground truth after few iterations. Possible applications are non-professional 3 D acquisition systems on low-cost platforms like mobile phones, autonomously navigating robots as well as online flight planning of unmanned aerial vehicles. ...|$|R

40|$|DE 19819054 A UPAB: 20000112 NOVELTY - The {{object is}} finely positioned. Localized, part {{hardening}} takes place between component and fastening surface. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The object, e. g., a ball (6) is mounted and adjusted {{on the base}} (1) in two stages. A manipulator positions coarsely in the first. In the second, fine positioning in terms of directional and/or positional adjustment relative to the base, is achieved by exploiting adhesive longitudinal shrinkage. A subtlety is strictly localized, part hardening. This takes place between component and fastening surface, over {{only part of the}} circumference or area. Setting is triggered at specific positions (2). An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for the equipment used. Preferred Features: Modes of adhesive disposition, and provision of <b>adjustment</b> (<b>sliding)</b> surfaces are elaborated. Various forms of stops are indicated. USE - Used in precision mounting of microcircuits (claimed) and microelectronic components in alignment with tracks on circuit boards. Used to adhere objects to bases, positioning them first relatively coarsely, then finely by exploiting adhesive shrinkage using an advanced technique. ADVANTAGE - The method targets high precision mounting, commencing with a relatively crude manipulator pre-positioning. Manipulator cost can be reduced accordingly. Fine positioning is induced at localized regions of the adhesive, or by localized adhesive deposition. The object can be e. g. rotated and/or translated as required. The inventive method is discussed at some length in the disclosure...|$|R

40|$|Background As {{we enter}} {{an era when}} testing {{millions}} of SNPs in a single gene association study will become the standard, consideration of multiple comparisons {{is an essential part}} of determining statistical significance. Bonferroni adjustments can be made but are conservative due to the preponderance of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between genetic markers, and permutation testing is not always a viable option. Three major classes of corrections have been proposed to correct the dependent nature of genetic data in Bonferroni adjustments: permutation testing and related alternatives, principal components analysis (PCA), and analysis of blocks of LD across the genome. We consider seven implementations of these commonly used methods using data from 1514 European American participants genotyped for 700, 078 SNPs in a GWAS for AIDS. Results A Bonferroni correction using the number of LD blocks found by the three algorithms implemented by Haploview resulted in an insufficiently conservative threshold, corresponding to a genome-wide significance level of α = 0. 15 - 0. 20. We observed a moderate increase in power when using PRESTO, SLIDE, and simpleℳ when compared with traditional Bonferroni methods for population data genotyped on the Affymetrix 6. 0 platform in European Americans (α = 0. 05 thresholds between 1 × 10 - 7 and 7 × 10 - 8). Conclusions Correcting for the number of LD blocks resulted in an anti-conservative Bonferroni <b>adjustment.</b> <b>SLIDE</b> and simpleℳ are particularly useful when using a statistical test not handled in optimized permutation testing packages, and genome-wide corrected p-values using SLIDE, are much easier to interpret for consumers of GWAS studies...|$|R
40|$|Protein-DNA {{recognition}} {{is a central}} biological process that governs the life of cells. A protein will often undergo a conformational transition to form the functional complex with its target DNA. The protein conformational dynamics are expected {{to contribute to the}} stability and specificity of DNA recognition and therefore may control the functional activity of the protein-DNA complex. Understanding how the conformational dynamics influences the protein-DNA {{recognition is}} still challenging. Here, we developed a two-basin structure-based model to explore functional dynamics in Sulfolobus solfataricus DNA Y-family polymerase IV (DPO 4) during its binding to DNA. With explicit consideration of non-specific and specific interactions between DPO 4 and DNA, we found that DPO 4 -DNA recognition is comprised of first 3 D diffusion, then a short-range <b>adjustment</b> <b>sliding</b> on DNA and finally specific binding. Interestingly, we found that DPO 4 is under a conformational equilibrium between multiple states during the binding process and the distributions of the conformations vary at different binding stages. By modulating the strength of the electrostatic interactions, the flexibility of the linker, and the conformational dynamics in DPO 4, we drew a clear picture on how DPO 4 dynamically regulates the DNA recognition. We argue that the unique features of flexibility and conformational dynamics in DPO 4 -DNA recognition have direct implications for low-fidelity translesion DNA synthesis, most of which is found to be accomplished by the Y-family DNA polymerases. Our results help complete the description of the DNA synthesis process for the Y-family polymerases. Furthermore, the methods developed here can be widely applied for future investigations on how various proteins recognize and bind specific DNA substrates...|$|R
