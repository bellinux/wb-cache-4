5|$|In 1929 Gareloi Volcano {{underwent}} a major explosive eruption where it generated four lava flows, andesitic tuff, volcanic glass, and <b>scoria</b> of red tone. Thirteen craters, all {{located in the}} fissure, contributed to this episode. All are most likely phreatic. During the eruption, pyroclastic flows convened with tephra, as suggested by deposits. Lahar also streamed from the summit.|$|E
5|$|Marine {{transport}} {{can also}} be impacted by volcanic ash. Ash fall will block air and oil filters and abrade any moving parts if ingested into engines. Navigation will be impacted by a reduction in visibility during ash fall. Vesiculated ash (pumice and <b>scoria)</b> will float on the water surface in ‘pumice rafts’ which can clog water intakes quickly, leading to over heating of machinery.|$|E
3000|$|We {{measured}} the porosity of 18 fragments of <b>scoriae</b> in total, consisting of six fragments from three regions: {{the surface of}} the <b>scoriae,</b> the internal high-porosity region, and the regions including both the inside and surface. Here, it was difficult to excavate the fragile <b>scoriae</b> without deficiency. The large <b>scoriae</b> found on the road usually fractured. We thus could not obtain the porosity and size of whole clasts. For the same reason, the number of analyzed samples is limited. We {{measured the}} mass (m_s) and volume of the <b>scoriae</b> coated by a paraffin film and immersed within water (V_t) (e.g., Shea et al. 2010). The density of the solid part of the <b>scoriae,</b> ρ _s = 2720 [...] kg m^- 3, was obtained by weighing and measuring the volume of the grounded <b>scoriae</b> using a pycnometer.|$|R
3000|$|The Aso Volcano {{eruption}} in 2014 – 2015 {{is characterized}} by ash-dominated eruption and the occasional ejection of high-porosity <b>scoriae.</b> The high-porosity <b>scoriae</b> (ϕ _b< 0.94) have a low-porosity outer rim and flattened shape, suggesting that the <b>scoriae</b> erupted at a high temperature. We heated the high-porosity <b>scoriae</b> {{and found that the}} <b>scoriae</b> at > 1000 ^∘C could shrink to form a low-porosity rim. The deformation experiments show that high-porosity <b>scoriae</b> at a low temperature <  500 °C can easily fracture, even under low shear and normal stresses ∼ 10 ^ 4 [...] Pa. The permeability of the powder-like ash layer is high (> 10 [...] ^- 11 m^ 2), while the fine ash particles at 950 °C are sintered and generate a low-permeability layer (< 2.5 × 10 ^- 13 m^ 2).|$|R
30|$|As the ash {{eruption}} continues, {{the debris}} layer becomes thinner so that high-porosity <b>scoriae</b> can erupt (Fig.  14 d). The unburied <b>scoriae</b> {{found at the}} western rim of the Nakadake 1 st crater have low-porosity rims (Fig.  2 c). To make such a rim by surface tension-induced shrinkage, our heating experiments suggest that the <b>scoriae</b> erupted at a high temperature (> 1000 °C).|$|R

Los OGT won the AAA World Trios Championship on November 4, 2016, as they {{defeated}} Los Xinetes ("The Horsemen"; El Zorro, Dark Cuervo and Dark <b>Scoria).</b> They lost the title to El Apache, Faby Apache and Mary Apache on March 5, 2017, when Marvin was defeated by Faby in a singles match. On October 30, 2017, Marvin left AAA.|$|E
5|$|As the eruptions continued, {{they became}} {{concentrated}} at one vent along the fissure {{and began to}} build the island into a more circular shape. By 24 November, the island measured about 900metres by 650metres (2950 by 2130ft). The violent explosions caused by the meeting of lava and sea water meant that the island consisted of a loose pile of volcanic rock (<b>scoria),</b> which was eroded rapidly by North Atlantic storms during the winter. However, eruptions more than kept pace with wave erosion, and by February 1964, the island had a maximum diameter of over 1300metres (4265ft).|$|E
5|$|Several rock types {{with varying}} {{chemical}} compositions make up Level Mountain. Ankaramites and alkali basalts {{are the primary}} volcanic rocks comprising the basal shield. Alkali basalts form columnar jointed lava flows, vesicular lava flows, dikes and <b>scoria</b> while ankaramites are present as dark-coloured lava flows with several columnar cooling units. Trachybasalts, phonolites, trachytes, peralkaline trachytes, pantellerites, comendites and rhyolites form the overlying stratovolcano and domes. They comprise dikes, welded tuffs, pitchstones, volcanic plugs, laccoliths and flows. Trachybasalts are {{in the form of}} two textural types; phenocryst-rich lava flows and fragmental flow agglomerates. Phonolites are vesicular and pumiceous in nature, although phonolites with trachytic texture are also present. Trachytes and peralkaline trachytes are the primary volcanic rocks in the Level Mountain Range. Comendite lava flows appear to have erupted fluidly, forming lava tubes. Rhyolites are in the form of stubby lava flows and domes.|$|E
30|$|As {{the volume}} decreases, the {{porosity}} of the <b>scoriae</b> also decreases (Fig.  5 b). When the furnace temperature is 1055 °C, the minimum porosity of the <b>scoriae</b> becomes approximately 0.6, {{close to the}} random packing of spheres (e.g., Namiki and Tanaka 2017, and the references therein). Here, {{a change in the}} connectivity may occur as a governing mechanism of the final porosity. However, we could not check the evolution of the connectivity because of the difficulty of the shape forming of fragile <b>scoriae.</b> When the furnace temperature is sufficiently high, 1055 °C, the <b>scoriae</b> melt and become sufficiently less viscous; therefor bubbles segregate by buoyancy rather than permeable flow. As a result, their porosity becomes lower than 0.4.|$|R

5|$|At 07:15 UTC on 14 November 1963, {{the cook}} of Ísleifur II, a trawler sailing these same waters spotted a rising column of dark smoke {{southwest}} of the boat. The captain thought {{it might have been}} a boat on fire, and ordered the vessel to investigate. Instead, they encountered explosive eruptions giving off black columns of ash, indicating that a volcanic eruption had begun to penetrate the surface of the sea. By 11:00 the same day, the eruption column had reached several kilometres in height. At first the eruptions took place at three separate vents along a northeast by southwest trending fissure, but by the afternoon the separate eruption columns had merged into one along the erupting fissure. Over the next week, explosions were continuous, and after just a few days the new island, formed mainly of <b>scoria,</b> measured over 500metres (1640ft) in length and had reached a height of 45metres (147ft).|$|E

25|$|The hill's <b>scoria</b> cones were {{erupted from}} three craters – one is intact and {{two have been}} {{breached}} by lava flows that rafted away part {{of the side of}} the <b>scoria</b> cone. Lava flows went in all directions, many towards Onehunga, covering an area of , making it the second largest (in area covered) of the Auckland volcanic field, behind Rangitoto Island. The age of eruption is currently unknown, but it is older than 28,500 years as it has a mantling of volcanic ash erupted at that time from Te Tātua-a-Riukiuta volcano.|$|E
3000|$|The Nakadake 1 st crater {{usually has}} hot acid water, {{and the water}} level {{decreases}} {{with an increase in}} the volcanic activity (e.g., Terada et al. 2012). The water in the crater disappeared by late 2013, and eruption started on November 25, 2014 (Shinohara et al. 2018 a). The typical eruption style from November 2014 to May 2015 was continuous ash eruption sometimes including <b>scoriae.</b> The events during November–December 2014 were vigorous. A red-hot feature was observed in the root of the ash including the plume close to the vent. The ejected <b>scoriae</b> also showed a red-hot feature and were elongated and toned apart on the ballistic orbit. These characteristics suggest a high temperature of the erupting magma. The event on December 9, 2014, erupted a massive amount of <b>scoriae.</b> The large <b>scoriae</b> > 0.1 [...] m with a flattened shape were observed {{on the west side of}} the 1 st crater (Yokoo and Miyabuchi 2015).|$|R

3000|$|We {{note that}} the ratio μ =σ _τ/σ _N and Q {{measured}} at 500 – 700 °C, shown in Fig.  9 c, d, are plotted between those of the fractured and unfractured <b>scoriae</b> shown in Fig.  9 a, b. Here, the fractured <b>scoriae</b> have large grains, and the ash with larger grains (< 1 [...] mm) shows a lower μ and higher Q. These results suggest a grain-size dependence of the friction coefficient.|$|R

25|$|Lake Nyos {{lies within}} the Oku Volcanic Field, {{located near the}} {{northern}} boundary of the Cameroon Volcanic Line, a zone of volcanoes and other tectonic activity that extends southwest to the Mt.

25|$|The ideal {{lava flow}} {{will have a}} {{brecciated}} top, either as pillow lava development, autobreccia and rubble typical of aā and viscous flows, or a vesicular or frothy carapace such as <b>scoria</b> or pumice.

30|$|In {{the thick}} black ash deposit at the 3 rd crater, high-porosity <b>scoriae</b> were buried {{approximately}} 0.2  m {{below the surface}} of the deposit. We could not identify which events generated these deposits. The high-porosity <b>scoriae</b> have a yellowish color (Fig.  2 a, b). The high porosity and yellowish color are similar to the golden pumices described at Kilauea, Hawaii, and Villarrica, Chile (Gurioli et al. 2008; Sharp et al. 1987).

25|$|During a {{volcanic}} eruption the magma {{that leaves the}} underground is called lava. Lava cools and solidifies relatively quickly compared to underground bodies of magma. This fast cooling does not allow crystals to grow large, {{and a part of}} the melt does not crystallize at all, becoming glass. Rocks largely composed of volcanic glass include obsidian, <b>scoria</b> and pumice.|$|E

25|$|The earlier erupted {{group of}} {{volcanic}} deposits at Cinder Cone, which are relatively titanium-poor, consist {{of the older}} <b>scoria</b> cone, the Old Bench flow, the two Painted Dunes flows, and {{the lower part of}} the widespread ash layer. The later erupted, relatively titanium-rich group consists of the large, younger <b>scoria</b> cone, the upper part of the ash layer, and the two Fantastic Lava Beds flows. Flow 2 of the Fantastic Lava Beds (see geologic map) is the flow that everyone but Diller thought had been erupted in 1851. The ash on the Old Bench and Painted Dunes lava flows is brightly oxidized because it fell on the lava flows when they were still hot. This oxidized ash belongs to the same compositional group as the Fantastic Lava Beds flows, the last flows erupted at Cinder Cone. All the volcanic materials at Cinder Cone therefore represent a single eruptive sequence that probably spanned no more than a few months.|$|E
30|$|The {{measured}} porosities of the <b>scoriae</b> (ϕ _b= 1 -(m_s/ρ _s)/V_t) {{are in a}} {{range of}} 0.7 – 0.94. The average porosities around the outer edge, inside, and a mixture of both are 0.76, 0.88, and 0.82, respectively. Here, the classification of the locations, outer edge, inside, and the mixture of both, is not strict. Again, the high-porosity <b>scoriae</b> are fragile, {{and it is difficult to}} cut them at an ideal location. This range is close to that reported for high-porosity reticulite, 0.75 – 0.98 (Mangan and Cashman 1996), formed in the lava fountain in Kilauea.|$|R
40|$|Stromboli is {{the type}} {{locality}} of continuous and moderately explosive volcanic activity. Monitoring temporal variations {{in the composition of}} the material erupted allows constraints to be made on the magma chamber dynamics and volcanic hazard. Here we present an Sr isotope survey of <b>scoriae</b> and lavas erupted from Stromboli volcano during this century. The material erupted is transitional between shoshonite and High-K basalt, with relatively constant major and trace element composition. This implies no substantial physical separation of minerals during crystallization (ca. 50 vol% minerals in both lavas and <b>scoriae)</b> and hence a relatively homogeneous reservoir...|$|R

25|$|Lava was {{initially}} produced from {{close to the}} summit, spreading {{to other parts of}} the fissure and covering an area of 22km2 in around 24hours. The last <b>scoria</b> were seen on the morning of 20 August. This was an unusual eruption both in the short time since the previous eruption – the shortest since 1104, and the length – previous eruptions had lasted from 2months to 2years rather than just 3days.|$|E
60|$|The {{fragments}} of <b>scoriae,</b> {{embedded in the}} crystalline calcareous basis, are of a jet black colour, with a glossy fracture like pitchstone. Their surfaces, however, are coated {{with a layer of}} a reddish-orange, translucent substance, which can easily be scratched with a knife; hence they appear as if overlaid by a thin layer of rosin. Some of the smaller fragments are partially changed throughout into this substance: a change which appears quite different from ordinary decomposition. At the Galapagos Archipelago (as will be described in a future chapter), great beds are formed of volcanic ashes and particles of <b>scoriae,</b> which have undergone a closely similar change.|$|R
3000|$|Comparing Fig.  9 a, c may {{indicate}} {{the evolution of}} the ash in the conduit. The unbroken <b>scoriae</b> at 950 °C indicated by the circles in Fig.  9 a show rate strengthening at low angular frequencies ([...] < 1 [...] Rad. s^- 1). As the flow rate in the conduit becomes faster, the friction between the conduit wall and the internal magma increases. In addition, the magma is eventually cooled. Finally, bubbly magma fractures. The friction coefficient of the fractured magma, containing both large and small particles, like <b>scoriae</b> and ash (Fig.  6 d), is lower than that before fracturing but still shows rate strengthening, as indicated by the crosses in Fig.  9 a. Thus, large particles (small <b>scoriae)</b> further break down into small particles (ash). Concurrently, the size separation of particles takes place; that is, small particles (ash) flow down in the space at the grain boundaries of large pieces (<b>scoriae),</b> which causes hysteresis in the friction coefficient, as shown by the blue curve with crosses in Fig.  9 c, a measurement for ash with large grains at a low temperature. Once the particle size becomes uniform at each location, the frictional characteristic changes into rate weakening, as indicated by the blue and green curves in Fig.  9 c, measurements for fine ash at a low temperature. If the fine ash is reheated to a high temperature, the ash sinters, and the frictional characteristics return to rate strengthening again, as indicated by the red curves in Fig.  9 c.|$|R
