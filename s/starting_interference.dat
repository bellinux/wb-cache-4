Each experiment consists of two phases: a first phase where the QoS of the link under test is recorded without interference, and a second phase where interference is generated in the environment. Phase 2 of each experiment proceeds as follows: a. <b>Start</b> the <b>interference</b> transmission, b. wait 1 s to ensure interference is on the air, c. start the link-under-test transmission for n seconds, d. wait n seconds, and e. stop all data transmissions.

Because the types of systems differ so widely, we use a case by case approach to identifying the different parameters and criteria that capture their behaviour in a quantum mechanical framework. We find it helpful to categorise systems into three broad classes defined by mass, spatio-temporal coherence, and number of particles. The classes are not mutually exclusive and in fact the properties of some systems fit into several classes. We discuss experiments by turn, <b>starting</b> with <b>interference</b> of massive objects like macromolecules and micro-mechanical resonators, followed by self-interference of single particles in complex molecules, before examining the striking advances made with superconducting qubits. Finally, we propose a theoretical basis for quantifying the macroscopic features of a system to lay the ground for a more systematic comparison of the quantum properties in disparate systems. © 2014 Elsevier B.

Thus, recent research focuses on concepts for interference management for cellular OFDMA systems.

It is obvious, the more sophisticated these techniques are, the higher the demands for feedback and backhaul become. Performance results are provided by employing multi-cell simulations according to recommendations from 3 GPP.

40|$|Abstract—Topology {{control has}} been used to {{minimize}} in-terference or to reduce power consumption while maintaining connectivity in wireless ad hoc and sensor networks (WSNs) (which are represented as undirected graphs). In the graph model, the interference experienced by an edge in a WSN has been defined in at least two different ways: the sender-based and receiver-based interference models. These models have been extensively studied in the literature although the receiver-based model has received more attention. Recently, several researchers have <b>started</b> investigating <b>interference</b> in the more realistic physical model which is known as the Signal-to-Interference-Noise-Ratio (SINR) model. The SINR model better reflects the real environment than the receiver-based or sender-based graph models. In this paper, we study the problem of assigning power to nodes in the plane to yield a connected network of minimum edge interference in the receiver-based (RB-MEI) as well as the SINR models (SINR-MEI). We show that RB-MEI is NP-complete for geometric graphs. For SINR-MEI, NP-completeness holds for planar geometric graphs. We also propose some simple greedy heuristics based on the minimum spanning tree approach, and study their performance through simulation...|$|R

The algorithm delays decisions on splitting, spilling, and register assignment, and therefore, the register allocation may be better than what is obtained by a Chatin-style allocator.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of the gravitational lens delay time between light paths has relied, to date, on the source having sufficient variability to allow photometric variations from each path to be compared. However, the delay times of many gravitational lenses cannot be measured because the intrinsic source amplitude variations {{are too small to}} be detectable. At the fundamental quantum mechanical level, such photometric time stamps allow which-path knowledge, removing the ability to obtain an interference pattern. However, if the two paths can be made equal (zero time delay) then interference can occur. We describe an interferometric approach to measuring gravitational lens delay times using a quantum-eraser/restorer approach, whereby the time travel along the two paths may be rendered measurably equal. Energy and time being non-commuting observables, constraints on the photon energy in the energy-time uncertainty principle, via adjustments of the width of the radio bandpass, dictate the uncertainty of the time delay and therefore whether the path taken along one or the other gravitational lens geodesic is knowable. If one <b>starts</b> with <b>interference,</b> for example, which-path information returns when the bandpass is broadened (constraints on the energy are relaxed) {{to the point where the}} uncertainty principle allows a knowledge of the arrival time to better than the gravitational lens delay time itself, at which point the interference will disappear. We discuss the near-term feasibility of such measurements in light of current narrow-band radio detectors and known short time-delay gravitational lenses. Comment: 22 page...|$|R

Holographic {{interferometry}} (HI) is an optical technique, {{by means of}} which changes in the refractive index can be visualized as interference fringes. The technique {{has been used to}} study the behavior of brine discharges from desalination plants into the sea. When the brine discharges in the sea, the diffusion/dilution of the salts in the seawater begins thus causing concentration changes associated to changes in the refractive index. This variation of the refractive index can be visualized as an interference fringe pattern by means of HI. In the present work, the first aim has been to determine the diffusion coefficient of brine in seawater. Diffusion experiments, consisting on slowly introducing brine in spectrophotometric cell containing seawater, have been carried out. When both solutions get in contact, the diffusion of solute <b>starts</b> and <b>interference</b> fringes (interferogram) begin to appear. The diffusion coefficient of brine in sea water has been calculated using these interferograms and a value of 1. 27 • 10 - 5 cm 2 /s has been obtained. Dynamic experiments have also been carried out, introducing a flow of brine into a transparent container with seawater. Several characteristics of the brine discharge (flow rate, concentration, depth at which is poured and angle of discharge) have been studied. Using the interferometric fringe patterns obtained, concentration profiles in the container have been calculated. The results obtained show a better diffusion/dilution of the brine when the discharge is not horizontal and a moderate flow rate is used...|$|R

One major regulatory element of protein translation is the nuclease Dicer that cuts double-stranded RNA independently of the sequence into pieces of 19 – 22 base pairs <b>starting</b> the RNA <b>interference</b> pathway and activating miRNAs. Inhibiting Dicer is not desir-able owing to its multifunctional influence on the cell’s gene regulation. Blocking specific RNA se-quences by small-molecule binding, however, is a promising approach to affect the cell’s condition in a controlled manner. A label-free assay for the screening of site-specific interference of small mol-ecules with Dicer activity is thus needed. We used the Molecular Force Assay (MFA), recently de-veloped in our lab, to measure the activity of Dicer. As a model system, we used an RNA sequence that forms an aptamer-binding site for paromomycin, a 615 -dalton aminoglycoside. We show that Dicer activity is modulated {{as a function of}} concentration and incubation time: the addition of paromomycin leads to a decrease of Dicer activity according to the amount of ligand. The measured dissociation constant of paromomycin to its aptamer was found to agree well with literature values. The parallel format of the MFA allows a large-scale search and analysis for ligands for any RNA sequence...|$|R
40|$|In the gamma-echo {{technique}} a {{radioactive source}} is moved, {{with respect to}} a nuclear-resonant absorber, during the lifetime of first-excited nuclear state. This introduces a phase shift between the source radiation and the radiation from the absorber. If the source is moved abruptly, introducing a pi phase shift, the time-dependent intensity shows a sharp increase in the intensity at that time, the "gamma echo. " Using the recently developed one-dimensional quantum-mechanical model, based on the technique developed by Heitler and Harris, the gamma-echo effect is seen to be a phase-shift-induced transparency. A closed-form solution for the time-dependent transmitted intensity has been obtained. The solution has the form of a sum over coherent paths that the radiation takes in going from the radioactive source through the absorber to the detector. The model shows that the sharp increase in the intensity, the "gamma echo," at the time when the source is moved abruptly is due to constructive <b>interference,</b> <b>starting</b> at that time, between the source radiation and the radiation from the absorber.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{address the problem of}} {{distributed}} sum-rate maximization in small cell networks in the special case where users have incomplete information about the interfering cross-channels. The sum-rate maximization problem admits a decentralized solution based on pricing mechanism. This requires the exchange of some control parameters (prices) over a common signaling channel. In femtocell networks, this exchange of control data may occur through the wired backhaul (e. g., an ADSL channel) connecting the femto-access points (FAP's). The problem with the implementation of pricing is that it requires knowledge of the cross channels between the interfering nodes and this information typically is not available. In this paper, we address this problem by using only statistical information about the cross-channels. This leads to a Bayesian pricing mechanism. We <b>start</b> modeling the <b>interference</b> mechanism through a directed random graph. Then, we model the interference incorporating the fading statistics and the spatial distribution of the nodes. We provide a closed form expression for the expected value of the pricing term and derive distributed schemes able to converge to a stationary point of the sum-utility function.

As condições climáticas no estado de São Paulo após o plantio deste experimento (época normal de plantio da cana-de-açúcar no estado de São Paulo) são caracterizadas por deficiência hídrica e temperaturas amenas, sendo que o períodos chuvoso iniciou-se apenas quatro meses após o plantio. O resultados obtidos no experimento permitiram concluir que a cana-de-açúcar suportou um pequeno período de convivência inicial, de zero aos 41 dias após o plantio (DAP), sem sofrer interferência significativa de diminuição da produção.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of distractor interference indicates that information {{not relevant to}} the goal is processed and {{has an impact on}} goal-directed actions. Recent work in young, healthy participants indicates that distractors presented simultaneously and also 200 ms prior to targets have a significant, though attenuated, impact on responses to targets (Kritikos, McNeill & Pavlis 2008; Watson & Humphreys 1998). Beyond this interval, <b>interference</b> <b>starts</b> to diminish (Kritikos et al., 2008; Watson & Humphreys 1998). Incongruent distractors presented 200 ms prior to targets are associated with greater interference than neutral and congruent distractors (Kritikos et al., 2008; Watson & Humphreys 1998). These findings imply that internal representations of irrelevant information are capable of affecting subsequent responses to goals. In the current study, older participants were compared with younger participants to investigate age effects on response times and accuracy to simultaneously presented as well as temporally separated distractors at intervals at/greater than 200 ms. The impact of age on response times to manipulations of distractor congruence was also investigated. Simultaneous presentation of target and distrator, as well distractors preceded by the target by 200 ms or I 000 ms, was associated with increased distractor interference for both groups. The presence of incongruent distractors led to increased distractor interference for both groups. During all conditions in both experiments the older group had significantly longer reaction times compared to younger participants and was relatively more accurate in response selection. Overall, the older group's slower response style seemed to be more advantageous, allowing them enough time to think more carefully about their responses. These findings are discussed with reference to Salthouse' s (1996) reduced speed of processing theory, which states that normal ageing is associated with generalized slowing of neural transmission. The finding that older participants were accurate in their responses and had no greater difficulty than younger participants in inhibiting incongruent distractors does not support Hasher and Zack's (1998) reduced inhibition theory. Despite overall slower reaction times, older participants demonstrated a preserved ability to inhibit unwanted stimuli in their responses...|$|R
