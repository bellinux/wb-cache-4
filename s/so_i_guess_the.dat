The album {{was intended to be}} a prequel to the Coheed and Cambria albums.

5000|$|In a 2003 {{review of}} Timeless Flight, Martin Aston of Q noted: [...] "Timeless Flight bears plenty of Harley's melodic hallmarks, but some complex tripwires keep popping up: [...] "White, White Dove"'s borderline-poppy chorus is scuppered by skittish, borderline-jazz rock flourishes." [...] George Starostin {{retrospectively}} reviewed the album for his website, where he highlighted the song {{as the best}} track on the album. He said: [...] "Harley's newly-found love for funky rhythms is amply demonstrated on [...] "White White Dove", Harley's weird ode to Rosicrucians, of all people, with a very nice transition from the harsh funky verses to the pompous brass-filled poppy chorus and, again, an excellent processed guitar solo from Cregan at <b>the</b> end. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> it's <b>the</b> only number on the entire record that shows some ambition where melody and complexity are concerned, and, predictably, becomes my favourite song." [...] Dave Thompson of AllMusic spoke of the song {{in a review of}} the 2008 compilation The Best of Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel. He wrote: [...] "The real meat, however, lies among the excerpted album cuts, as the compilers treat all seven original Harley/Cockney Rebel LPs with more or less equal respect - many fans would have drawn a line after the first three. But [...] "White White Dove," [...] "Roll the Dice," [...] and the like all deserve a fresh hearing." ...|$|R
5000|$|Not {{fulfilling}} preexisting ideas Tillman {{used some}} sort of arbitrariness finding his new moniker 'Father John Misty'. For TheVine he explained himself as following: [...] "I had {{to give it a}} name, so I kind of wanted to confuse people with this ridiculous red herring and admittedly patently ridiculous name that’s also phonetically beautifully and looks good in print. Sort of a name I’ve decided to give to this weird, subconscious, dream fragmentation I have of this homosexual, shamanic drifter who bounces around and stirs up weird shit in my dreams. Like making out with my brother. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> aggregate of all those things just felt right. But really and truly, the whole thing is just kind of about the fact that it really doesn’t matter what the fuck you call yourself, as long as the goods are in the explicit honesty." ...|$|E
5000|$|Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} a [...] "C-", stating [...] "... tonight's classically themed outing didn't fare very well, {{starting}} {{with the story of}} one of the Bouvier sisters as Queen Elizabeth—an episode segment that clocked in at just over four minutes, far too short a time to do anything lasting... or funny. The longest stretch came near the end, {{in the form of an}} extended riff on MacBeth involving Homer killing a ton of people. But aside from the occasional random line or two, it was pretty much a boring retelling of the tale, with Simpsons characters subbing in for Shakespearean ones. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> question is: How much pleasure is there to milk from seeing familiar yellow people reenact parts of Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead? Given the show's shaky streak lately, not nearly enough." [...] Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a 6.2/10, ultimately saying [...] "Four stories instead of three, but there was really one worth watching." ...|$|E
5000|$|Canadian actor Christopher Heyerdahl {{talks about}} how he got his role and the rarity of a Scandinavian character: [...] "Well, luck and providence, I suppose. They say, 'What’s luck? Preparation and {{opportunity}}.' <b>So,</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> opportunity came, {{in the form of}} an audition. I put myself on tape, and they responded to it. I went in and did a call-back audition, and they felt that we were on the same track. My idea of who The Swede was, was the same as theirs, and vice versa. This kind of character is very rare, with the fact that it fit so well with my background and my understanding of a Norwegian man. It all just fell into place. I still get a little choked up thinking about how often a character like this comes along. For the viewer, it’s quite interesting. It’s not a character that we see very often, and certainly not in this form. As an actor, it seemed to be tailor-made for me. It’s quite wonderful." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1997, Trent Reznor invited Plug to remix the Nine Inch Nails track The Perfect Drug, {{which had}} been heavily {{inspired}} by UK electronic music. There exists confusion about how Trent {{had come to know}} Vibert's work, with Vibert himself stating, [...] "I could never understand how I got it (The Perfect Drug remix) in the first place. Somehow, Trent heard my stuff and really liked it." [...] He added, [...] "Someone told me that Alex Paterson from The Orb played my Plug stuff for Trent and someone else told me that Coil played it for him. All I know is that Nothing got in contact with me for the Nine Inch Nails remix and then expressed interest in releasing Drum 'N' Bass For Papa, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> passed <b>the</b> test." [...] Nothing Records label-mate Jack Dangers of Meat Beat Manifesto (who likewise appeared with a remix on Nine Inch Nails' The Perfect Drug single) credited himself as having introduced Vibert's work to Reznor. [...] Dangers had been a fan of Vibert's, inviting him to remix Meat Beat Manifesto around the same time, on MBM's It's The Music single (under the Plug moniker) and the Original Fire EP (as Luke Vibert). At the time, Vibert also had a standing offer from UK label Ninja Tune to re-issue the album. Vibert ultimately opted to accept Reznor's offer with Nothing Records.|$|R

50|$|Doe's work {{evolved into}} {{the focus of the}} female body. In an {{interview}} by Pierogi, Don Doe explores his thoughts on the transition into a new set of works; titled Scopophilia. These works depicted men taking photos of women in various poses. “I have another series of a solitary male utilizing a camera possibly as a voyeuristic device preparing to either document his female subject or keep a distance from her, a very open ended series without an outcome, but full of noir. I am working on two other series about pissing in public and another about gun hobbyists in the woods. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> men illustrate a problematizing of the male gaze, and other blurred distinctions between life and the authoritative nudes of the masters, that an eventual instillation will resolve.” The male and female figures play into the viewer's understanding of social reality, as well as the classical masters who also painted nude figures. This is further explored in an interview of a 2003 show that Don Doe partook in. This review in the New York Times by Ken Johnson briefly goes over the way Doe's work interacts with mythology and male desire.|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{would like}} to comment on the {{necessary}} courses a student should take to really be prepared to carry out research in model-based vision. As we can see the geometry of image projection and the mathematics of transformation is a very key element in studying this field, but there are many other issues the student has to be prepared for. If {{we are going to talk}} about segmenting images and getting good geometric clues, we have to understand the relationship between the intensity of image data and its underlying geometry. And this would lead the student into such areas as optics, illumination theory, theory of shadows and the like. And also the mathematics underlying this kind of computations would of course require signal processing theory, fourier transform theory and the like. And in dealing with algebraic surfaces such as this curved surfaces as we talked about here, courses in algebraic geometry and higher pure forms of algebra will prove to be necessary in order to make any kind of progress in research to handle curved surfaces. <b>So,</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> bottom line of what I'm saying is: math courses, particularly those associated with geometric aspects will be key in all of this." ...|$|E
