40|$|Chemical and {{physical}} features of polybutester <b>synthetic</b> <b>monofilament</b> (Novafil®) nonabsorbable suture {{were evaluated by}} a comparative study vs polypropylene. A random study on fiftyfive patients who underwent plastic surgery was performed. Our evaluations concerned specific features of the suture such as elasticity, resistance, knot rundown, knot security, knot tying, suppleness and more general features such as tissue reactivity and traumaticity. Our experience with the polybutester suture in plastic surgery has been satisfactory, being especially useful for intradermal sutures...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Throughout history {{many kinds}} of {{different}} suture materials {{have been used for}} closing and suturing surgical wounds. Medical literature describes four basic characteristics of suture material: knot safety, tensile strength, tissue reaction and wound safety. The tissue reaction is reflected in an inflammatory response, which, though minimal, occurs during first two to seven days after implanting suture into the tissue. The aim of this research was to investigate whether different suture materials affect the development of decubital damage of oral mucosa, which to a great extent can compromise the process of wound healing. Material and methods. The investigation was designed as a prospective clinical study including 150 patients of both genders, aged between 25 and 60. The patients were distributed into three groups of 50 persons. The suture Black Silk was used in the first group, designated as a control group. Nylon and Vicril were used {{in the second and third}} group, i. e. experimental groups, respectively. Decubital damage of the surrounding soft tissues was the main parameter for monitoring the effects of selected suture materials on the oral mucosa. Conclusion. The comparison of results obtained for the investigated suture materials after suturing oral mucosa revealed that certain advan­tage could be given to <b>synthetic</b> <b>monofilament</b> suture material...|$|E
40|$|Historical data on closing and suturing of {{surgical}} wounds describe {{a wide range}} of various suture materials. The choice of the surgical catgut, i. e. the type and diameter, depends on the locality, characteristics and condition of the tissue to be treated. From the standpoint of oral-surgical practice the following clinical parameters are of outstanding importance with respect to the selection of suture material: accumulation of soft deposits on the sutures, score of the adjacent soft tissues and dehiscence of the operative wound. Our prospective clinical study included 150 patients distributed into three groups of 50 subjects. The surgical procedure performed on each patient involved resection (apicotomy) of the tooth root end in the intercanine sector of the upper jaw. The following suture materials were applied: Black Silc 5 - 0, Nylon 5 - 0 and Vicryl 5 - 0. The effects of the selected sutures were evaluated according to the wound dehiscence. The effects of the applied sutures were recorded on Days 2, 5 and 7 after the surgery. The comparison of cited parameters of the investigated materials after suturing the oral mucosa revealed that none of the used material was ideal; however, a certain advantage might be given to the <b>synthetic</b> <b>monofilament</b> suture materials...|$|E
5000|$|By 1949, Fuller {{had begun}} making the {{abstract}} string compositions {{that would become}} her trademark, and was photographed {{with one of these}} large constructions for Life magazine. Fuller's own writing connected her abstract designs in string to the tradition of the cat's cradle, or string figure. In March 1949, Fuller had her first exhibition at the Bertha Shaefer Gallery, where she would continue to exhibit until 1969. In the early fifties, conservation concerns prompted Fuller to embark on a [...] "relentless search for a permanent palette of thread colors," [...] that prompted the artist to move from natural fibers to <b>synthetic</b> <b>monofilaments.</b> In 1951, she exhibited several string compositions at the Corcoran Museum of Art, and was included in the Museum of Modern Art exhibition [...] "Abstract Painting and Sculpture in America." [...] In 1954, the Whitney Museum of American Art acquired Fuller's String Composition #51, and the following year, the Metropolitan Museum of Art acquired her String Composition #50. Fuller also exhibited work at the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C. In the 1940s and 1950s she received fellowships from the Guggenheim and Tiffany Foundations, along with a grant from the National Institute of Arts and Letters.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To compare {{inflammatory}} response, fibrosis {{process and}} biomechanical properties of different materials already in use or proposed for augmentation of fascial repairs for genital prolapse. Materials and methods: We experimentally compared two porcine cross-linked dermal collagen and two synthetic polypropylene containing implants: Pelvicol™ and Pelvisoft™ (Bard, Haasrode, Belgium), the latter a modification with large longitudinal slits; Pelvitex™ (Bard) as a novel collagen-coated monofilament polypropylene implant and Vypro II® (Johnson & Johnson Medical NV, Dilbeek, Belgium), lightweight mesh which {{is composed of}} resorbable multifilament polyglactin 910 and <b>synthetic</b> <b>monofilament</b> polypropylene. The dermal collagen matrices are believed to induce a milder inflammatory response without compromising tensile strength. Implants were used to primarily repair a full thickness abdominal wall defect in 96 Wistar rats. Animals were sacrificed on day 7, 14, 30 and 90 after implantation. At sacrifice the explant (implant and surrounding host tissue) was evaluated {{for the presence of}} herniation, infection, erosion, adhesion formation and changes in size. Tensile strength was assessed both on implants and explants. Histopathology was performed to evaluate collagen deposition and inflammatory response. ED- 1 antibody was used to identify rat macrophages. Results: While no herniations occurred, two clinical and two additional pathology confirmed infections were observed, one in Pelvisoft and three in the Pelvicol group. Pelvitex induced the least adhesions. At 90 days Vypro II shrunk by 19 % while the other materials did not shrink. At 90 days all materials could resist tensile forces of 16 N/cm Pelvisoft), or higher (Pelvicol, Pelvitex and Vypro II; range: 25 – 27 N/cm). Pelvisoft, with its open macroporous construct, had a lower tensiometric strength than Pelvicol in the early postoperative phase at 14 days. The acute inflammatory response was most pronounced in Vypro II. The chronic inflammatory response and foreign body reaction was comparable in both polypropylene containing materials but more pronounced compared to dermal matrices. Collagen deposition at the interface between muscle and material was comparable for all materials, although it was architecturally more organised in the collagen products. Conclusion: Pelvisoft has a lesser tensiometric resistance than Pelvicol on the short term, but not at 90 days, at what time all materials were equally strong. Pelvitex has a slightly more attenuated acute inflammatory reaction, with fewer adhesions than Vypro II. It did neither shrink. Vypro II induces most adhesions, shrinks by one fifth and induces the strongest acute inflammation. status: publishe...|$|E

Biomaterials, primarily synthetic, are often utilized to augment surgical correction. Repair with biomaterials involves midurethral support to function against weakened connective tissue caused by injury, abnormal collagen metabolism, or genetic predisposition. Even though efficacy rates are high, the potential for complications, such as erosion, are great without comprehension of inherent characteristics of each graft material. Low-weight, macroporous, <b>monofilament</b> <b>synthetic</b> grafts and noncross-linked biologic grafts are examples of biomaterials that implant reasonably well with host tissue.

30|$|Our {{results suggest}} that polyglactin 910 {{may be the best}} choice for {{terrestrial}} annelids. Its low gross scores and relatively mild/bland microscopic changes as compared to controls may indicate it’s a good choice for other invertebrates with similar life styles. In addition all sutures were retained. This and monofilament suture materials produce the least amount of tissue reaction in several avian and domestic mammalian species (Bennett et al. 1997; DeNardo et al. 1996; Knowles 1976; Wood et al. 1984). Similar results were reported in fish, amphibians, and reptiles. Polyglyconate, a <b>synthetic,</b> absorbable, <b>monofilament</b> material, produced the least tissue reaction in koi carp (Cyprinus carpio), when compared with four other suture materials (Hurty et al. 2002). Consistent with these findings were favorable tissue reactions from monofilament nylon in African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis) (Tuttle et al. 2002) and poliglecaprone (Sanz et al. 1988) and polyglyconate in juvenile loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) (Govett et al. 2004). Polyglyconate performed well to close a skin excisional biopsy site in a cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis); the sutures dislodged/dissolved on their own (Harms et al. 2006). Interestingly, {{this was not the case}} in another invertebrate, Aplysia californica, where silk, a braided organic material, was superior to the monofilament sutures examined (Anderson et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} {{physical and chemical}} properties of the new synthetic absorbable suture materials are shown. Particularly this paper make a comparison between multifilament and monofilament suture wire {{from the point of view}} of tensile strength, "in vivo" tensile strength retention, reabsorbability, foreseeability of the reabsorption time of the capillarity. On these theoretical basis the AA. think that actually the best suture wire for the gastrointestinal surgery must be a <b>synthetic</b> absorbable <b>monofilament</b> suture material. Clinical and experimental experience of the AA. utilizing in the surgery of the gastrointestinal tract a copolymer monofilament of the glycolic acid and of the trimethylene carbonate (polyglyconate-Maxon), resorbable by not-enzymatic hydrolysis in about 180 days are described. The clinical experience was acquired performing 43 manual gastroenteric anastomosis by polyglyconate suture material and making an endoscopic follow-up in 19 cases (12 oesophago-jejunal anastomoses and 7 colo-rectal anastomoses). The experimental study consist of 30 enteric anastomosis performed on rats. The results evaluation was made from three points of views: bacteriological, optical diffuse light microscopy and electronic transmission microscopy. The conclusions of the clinical and experimental studies are favourable for the use the polyglyconate suture wire in digestive surgery, and confirm also "in vivo" its theoretical properties...|$|R
40|$|Background: The urethrovesical {{anastomosis}} is {{a particular}} challenging step of robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). Failure to achieve a watertight anastomosis is associated with postoperative urinary leak and its consequences, which include paralytic ileus, prolonged catheterization, urinary peritonitis and possibly re-intervention. The bidirectional barbed suture is a new technology {{that may lead to}} improve the quality of the urethrovesical anastomosis. Objective: To present our surgical technique of urethrovesical anastomosis, bladder neck reconstruction and posterior reconstruction, using a bidirectional barbed suture. Material and methods: The bladder neck reconstruction, posterior reconstruction and vesicourethral anastomosis were performed using a 2 - 0 <b>synthetic</b> absorbable bidirectional <b>monofilament</b> barbed suture Results: All cases were finished successfully without major complication or conversion to laparoscopic or open surgery. Conclusion: The authors successfully modified their RARP technique to take advantage of the properties of the bidirectional barbed suture. Comparative studies that evaluate objective outcomes such as leakage rates and operative time are needed to definitely establish the benefits of this device in comparison to the traditional absorbable monofilament.
