5|$|In September 1954, Monroe began filming Billy Wilder's comedy The Seven Year Itch, {{in which}} she starred {{opposite}} Tom Ewell {{as a woman who}} becomes the object of her married neighbor's <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies.</b> Although the film was shot in Hollywood, the studio decided to generate advance publicity by staging the filming of a scene on Lexington Avenue in New York. In the shoot, Monroe is standing on a subway grate with the air blowing up the skirt of her white dress, which {{became one of the most}} famous scenes of her career. The shoot lasted for several hours and attracted a crowd of nearly 2,000 spectators, including professional photographers.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{investigation}} has found traces of this {{drug in the}} other victims, with Black believing that the killer not only has access to it through his occupation but is likely consuming it himself while committing his crimes in order to readily act on his <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies.</b> Black follows up on this, and investigates Nesbitt's pharmacy. Nesbitt is not working at the time, but Black realizes he must be the killer. He interviews Nesbitt's wife (Barbara Howard), finding {{that they have not}} had sex in eighteen years of marriage—however, Nesbitt has recently become interested in trying again.|$|E
40|$|Although the {{phenomenon}} of <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy</b> has been extensively researched, little contemporary inquiry has investigated the content of <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy</b> {{within the context of}} sexual offending. In this study, a qualitative analysis was used to develop a descriptive model of the phenomena of <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy</b> during the offence process. Twenty-four adult males convicted of sexual offences provided detailed retrospective descriptions of their thoughts, emotions, and behaviors before, during, and after their offences. Using Grounded Theory, a model was developed to elucidate the content and themes of <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy</b> for <b>sexual</b> offenders, as well as the way fantasy content was used in the process of sexual offending. The <b>Sexual</b> <b>Fantasy</b> Content Model (SFCM) comprises of three higher-order (level 1) and five second order (level 2) categories that describe the content of <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy</b> across the offence process. The level 1 categories are general <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy,</b> nonspecific offence fantasy, and offence-specific fantasy, whereas the level 2 categories included demographic, behavioral, relational, situational, and self-perceptual considerations.

40|$|While the {{phenomenon}} of <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy</b> has been researched extensively, little contemporary inquiry has investigated the structural properties of <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy</b> {{within the context of}} sexual offending. In this study, a qualitative analysis was used to develop a descriptive model of the phenomena of <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy</b> during the offence process. Twenty-four adult males convicted of sexual offences provided detailed retrospective descriptions of their thoughts, emotions and behaviours—before, during and after their offences. A data-driven approach to model development, known as Grounded Theory, was undertaken to analyse the interview transcripts. A model was developed to elucidate the structural properties of <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy</b> in the process of sexual offending, as well as the physiological and psychological variables associated with it. The <b>Sexual</b> <b>Fantasy</b> Structural Properties Model (SFSPM) comprises eight categories that describe various properties of <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy</b> across the offence process. These categories are: origin, context, trigger, perceptual modality, clarity, motion, intensity and emotion. The strengths of the SFSPM are discussed and its clinical implications are reviewed. Finally, the limitations of the study are presented and future research directions discussed...|$|R
50|$|A <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy,</b> {{also called}} an erotic fantasy, is a mental image or pattern {{of thought that}} stirs a person's {{sexuality}} and can create or enhance sexual arousal. A <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy</b> can be created by the person's imagination or memory, and may be triggered autonomously or by external stimulation such as erotic literature or pornography, a physical object, or sexual attraction to another person. Anything that may {{give rise to a}} sexual arousal may also produce a <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy,</b> and <b>sexual</b> arousal may in turn give rise to fantasies.|$|R
5|$|The {{first series}} begins nine months later. Rachel and Adam move into their first house together. He is horrified to {{discover}} {{that she has been}} married for over six years. She contacts her husband Kris Bumstead (Lennie James) and after briefly considering going back to him and dumping Adam, she gets the divorce. After a misunderstanding with Karen, Rachel worries that Adam has stopped finding her sexually attractive, and they agree to indulge in each other's <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies.</b> Rachel shares her with Adam: to have sex in a shop window. Adam arranges to get the keys to a shop, and he and Rachel act out her fantasy, though are arrested when a ramraider leads the police to them.|$|E
5|$|Una Aue / Frau Von Üxküll – Una Aue is Maximilien's twin sister. She {{is married}} to the aristocrat Berndt von Üxküll, and {{although}} she appears only briefly in person, she dominates Aue's imagination, particularly his <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> and hallucinations. She lived with her husband on his estate in Pomerania, but apparently moved to Switzerland with him {{towards the end of}} the war. Like her husband, she is critical of Germany's National Socialist regime which, along with his hatred of their mother and stepfather, and his attraction to her, led to her being estranged from Aue following the war.|$|E
5|$|As {{an adult}} Reich wrote extensively, in his diary, about his sexual precocity. He {{maintained}} {{that his first}} sexual experience was {{at the age of}} four when he tried to have sex with the family maid (with whom he shared a bed), that he would regularly watch the farm animals have sex, that he used a whip handle sexually on the horses while masturbating, and that he had almost daily sexual intercourse from the age of 11 with another of the servants. He wrote of regular visits to brothels, the first when he was 15, and said he was visiting them daily from the age of around 17. He also developed <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> about his mother, writing when he was 22 that he masturbated while thinking about her.|$|E

5|$|Lester becomes {{infatuated}} with Jane's vain cheerleader friend, Angela Hayes, after seeing her perform a half-time dance routine {{at a high}} school basketball game with Jane. He starts having <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> about Angela, in which red rose petals are a recurring motif. Carolyn begins an affair with her married business rival, Buddy Kane. When Lester's boss and efficiency expert, Brad, tells him that he is to be laid off, Lester instead blackmails him for $60,000 and quits his job. Lester continues his liberation by taking a minimum-wage job at a fast-food restaurant, trading his Toyota Camry for a 1970 Pontiac Firebird, and starts working out after he overhears Angela tell Jane that she would find him sexually attractive if he got in shape. He begins smoking marijuana supplied by Ricky. The girls' friendship wanes after Jane starts a relationship with Ricky. Jane and Ricky bond over what Ricky considers the most beautiful imagery he has filmed: a plastic bag being blown in the wind.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} the video was meant to {{illustrate}} the lyrics of the song. It depicts the <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> of a rich and bored housewife played by Beyoncé who tries to seduce her man while having breakfast at her house wearing a white robe. The video opens with various shots of a big mansion in which the singer is seen {{in one of the}} rooms. She tries to get her man's attention while he reads a newspaper. As he does not notice her, she throws a napkin on the floor and her female servant comes to lift it. The clip transitions to scenes of Beyoncé dressed in a Victorian jeweled outfit with a mask in her hands, lip-syncing the lyrics and dancing to the rhythm of the song. Afterwards, she is seen entering a limousine in which Jay-Z is already inside. Scenes of Beyoncé with a black coat and lingerie walking in front of the car are also intertwined throughout.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> are {{distinct}} from limerent fantasies. Limerent fantasy {{is rooted in}} reality and is intrusive rather than voluntary. <b>Sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> are under more or less voluntary control and may involve strangers, imaginary individuals, and situations that could not take place. Limerence elevates body temperature and increases relaxation, a sensation of viewing the world with rose-tinted glasses, leading to a greater receptiveness to sexuality, and to daydreaming.|$|E

25|$|Sexual desire {{disorders}} or decreased libido {{are characterized}} by a lack or absence for {{some period of time}} of sexual desire or libido for sexual activity or of <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies.</b> The condition ranges from a general lack of sexual desire to a lack of sexual desire for the current partner. The condition may have started after a period of normal sexual functioning or the person may always have had no/low sexual desire.|$|E
25|$|Sexual arousal from {{watching}} animals mate {{is known as}} faunoiphilia. A frequent interest in and sexual excitement at watching animals mate is cited {{as an indicator of}} latent zoophilia by Massen (1994). <b>Sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> about zoophilic acts can occur in people who do not have any wish to experience them in real life. Nancy Friday notes that zoophilia as a fantasy may provide an escape from cultural expectations, restrictions, and judgements in regard to sex. Masters (1962) says that some brothel madams used to stage exhibitions of animals mating, as they found it aroused potential clientele, and that this may have encouraged the clients to engage in bestiality..|$|E
25|$|The bet paid off. Insatiable was the top-selling adult {{video in}} the U.S. from 1980 to 1982 {{and it was}} {{inducted}} in the XRCO Hall of Fame.

She also released six direct-to-video features in the early 1980s called Marilyn Chambers' Private Fantasies, in which she acted out her own <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> alongside some {{of the biggest names in}} the industry. The scenarios and dialogue for the series were written by Chambers. Despite her return to the adult film world, Chambers dreamed of launching a successful mainstream acting career, but was unable to do so.|$|E

25|$|In {{a survey}} of American {{students}} conducted by a magazine in 1996, 24% {{of the people who}} replied claimed to have <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> involving bondage. This was claimed by 40% of the homosexual and bisexual men, 32% of the lesbian and bisexual women, 24% of the heterosexual women and 21% of the heterosexual men. 48% of the lesbian and bisexual women, 34% of the homosexual and bisexual men, and 25% of the heterosexual men and women had had practical experiences of bondage. In a survey conducted in the USA in 1985, about half of the men considered bondage erotic, but according to the 1993 publication Janus Report on Sexual Behavior, only 11% of the representatives had had practical experiences of bondage.|$|E
25|$|As skirts became {{narrower}} and flatter in front, {{more emphasis}} {{was placed on}} the waist and hips. A corset was therefore used to help mold the body to the desired shape. This was achieved by making the corsets longer than before, and by constructing them from separate shaped pieces of fabric. To increase rigidity, they were reinforced with many strips of whalebone, cording, or pieces of leather. As well as making corsets more constricting, this heavy structure helped prevent them from riding up, or from wrinkling at the waist. Steam-molding also helped create a curvaceous contour. Developed by Edwin Izod in the late 1860s, the procedure involved placing a corset, wet with starch, on a steam heated copper torso form until it dried into shape. While tight lacing continued to be a hotly debated topic among moralists and physicians, most extreme descriptions came from male <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies.</b>|$|E
25|$|Critic Randy Rasmussen {{suggests}} that the character of Bill is fundamentally more naïve, strait-laced, less disclosing and more unconscious of his vindictive motives than his counterpart, Fridolin. For Rasmussen and others, the film's Bill Harford is essentially sleep-walking through life with no deeper awareness of his surroundings. In the novella, when his wife discloses a private sexual fantasy, he in turn admits {{one of his own}} (of a girl in her mid to late teens), while in the film he is simply shocked. The film's argument over whether he has fantasies over female patients and whether women have <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> is simply absent from the novella, where both husband and wife assume the other has fantasies. In the film, Bill's estrangement from Alice revolves around her confessing a recent fantasy to him; in the novella, both exchange fantasies, after which she declares that in her youth she could have easily married someone else, which is what precipitates their sense of estrangement.|$|E
