In addition, traditional <b>measurements</b> of <b>fertility,</b> such as pregnancy to first insemination, number of inseminations per service period and interval from first to last insemination were studied as well as associations between the early and late measurements. Data were collected from an experimental herd during 15 years and included 1106 post-partum periods from 191 Swedish Holsteins and 325 Swedish Red and White dairy cows. Individual milk progesterone samples were taken twice a week until cyclicity and thereafter less frequently. First parity cows had 14. 8 and 18. 1 days longer CLA (LS-means difference) than second parity cows and older cows, respectively. Moreover, CLA was 10. 5 days longer for cows that calved during the winter season compared with the summer season and 7. 5 days longer for cows in tie-stalls than cows in loose-housing system. Cows treated for mastitis and lameness had 8. 4 and 18. 0 days longer CLA, respectively, compared with healthy cows. OOE was affected {{in the same way}} as CLA by the different environmental factors. PLA was a good indicator of CLA, and there was a high correlation (− 0. 69) between these two measurements. Treatment for lameness had a significant influence on all late <b>fertility</b> <b>measurements,</b> whereas housing was significant only for pregnancy to first insemination. All fertility traits were unfavourably associated with increased milk production. Regression of late <b>fertility</b> <b>measurements</b> on early <b>fertility</b> <b>measurements</b> had only a minor association with conception at first AI and interval from first to last AI for cows with conventional calving intervals, i. e. a 22 days later, CLA increased the interval from first to last insemination by 3. 4 days. Early measurements had repeatabilities of 0. 14 – 0. 16, indicating a higher influence by the cow itself compared with late measurements, which had repeatabilities of 0. 09 – 0. 10. Our study shows that early <b>fertility</b> <b>measurements</b> have a possibility to be used in breeding for better <b>fertility.</b> To improve <b>the</b> early <b>fertility</b> of <b>the</b> cow, there are a number of important factors that have to be taken into account...|$|R
40|$|Variable rate {{fertilization}} of {{an agricultural}} field is done {{taking into account}} spatial variability in the soil’s characteristics. Most often, spatial variability in <b>the</b> soil’s <b>fertility</b> is <b>the</b> primary characteristic {{used to determine the}} differences in fertilizers applied from one point to the next. For several years the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) has been developing a Decision Support System for Agriculture (DSS 4 Ag) to determine the economically optimum recipe of various fertilizers to apply at each site in a field, based on existing soil <b>fertility</b> at <b>the</b> site, predicted yield of the crop that would result (and a predicted harvest-time market price), and the current costs and compositions of the fertilizers to be applied. Typically, soil is sampled at selected points within a field, the soil samples are analyzed in a lab, and <b>the</b> lab-measured soil <b>fertility</b> of <b>the</b> point samples is used for spatial interpolation, in some statistical manner, to determine <b>the</b> soil <b>fertility</b> at all other points in the field. Then a decision tool determines the fertilizers to apply at each point. Our research was conducted to measure the impact on the variable rate fertilization recipe caused by variability in the <b>measurement</b> of <b>the</b> soil’s <b>fertility</b> at <b>the</b> sampling points. The variability could be laboratory analytical errors or errors from variation in the sample collection method. The results show that for many of <b>the</b> <b>fertility</b> parameters, laboratory <b>measurement</b> error variance exceeds the estimated variability of <b>the</b> <b>fertility</b> measure across grid locations. These errors resulted in DSS 4 Ag fertilizer recipe recommended application rates that differed by up to 138 pounds of urea per acre, with half the field differing by more than 57 pounds of urea per acre. For potash the difference in application rate was up to 895 pounds per acre and over half the field differed by more than 242 pounds of potash per acre. Urea and potash differences accounted for almost 87 % of the cost difference. The sum of these differences could result in a $ 34 per acre cost difference for the fertilization. Because of these differences, better analysis or better sampling methods may need to be done, or more samples collected, to ensure that the soil measurements are truly representative of the field’s spatial variability...|$|R

In most countries CR has increasing from cohorts of the 1930 s- 40 s onward due to rise in childlessness. In cohorts of the early 1960 s CR varies from 0. 24 to 0. 46 among 20 countries.

Swedish population registers contain the information on childbearing of all people ever living in Sweden and thus allow us to avoid any problems of selectivity by virtue of survival or of out-migration when we estimate fertility measures for previous calendar periods. We calculate two types of fertility rates for each year in 1961 - 1999 : (i) rates {{that are based on}} the population that were living in Sweden at the end of 1999 and (ii) rates that also include the information on people who had died or emigrated {{before the turn of the}} century. We find that the omission of information on emigrated and deceased individuals, as the situation would be in any demographic survey, most often have negligible effects on our fertility measures.
