Due {{to the fact}} that it’s difficult to capture the relationship between the physical and economical aspects as a result of critical <b>sewer</b> <b>pipelines</b> failure, economic concepts are used to evaluate the economic loss {{as a result of these}} failures.

It is expected that the proposed approach could help in estimating the economic losses due to <b>sewer</b> <b>pipelines</b> failure especially for the intangible factors that are difficult to measure.

40|$|In sewer networks, the {{economic}} effects and costs {{that result from}} a pipeline break are rising sharply. In Qatar, majority of the <b>sewer</b> network <b>pipelines</b> were installed in the last 20 years and are currently in poor condition and constantly deteriorating. As a result, there is huge demand for inspection and rehabilitation of <b>sewer</b> <b>pipelines.</b> In addition to being inaccurate, current Practices of <b>sewer</b> <b>pipelines</b> inspection are time consuming and may {{not keep up with}} the deterioration rate of the pipelines. Consequently, this research aims to develop an automated tool to detect different defects such as cracks, deformation, settled deposits and joint displacement in <b>sewer</b> <b>pipelines.</b> The automated approach is dependent upon using image-processing techniques and several mathematical formulas to analyze output data from CCTV camera photos. Given that one inspection session can result in hundreds of CCTV Camera footage, introducing an automated tool would help yield faster results. Additionally, given the subjective nature of most defects, it will result in more systematic results since the current method rely heavily on the operator's experience. The automated tool was able to successfully detect cracks, displaced joints, ovality and settled deposits in pipelines using CCTV Camera inspection output footage. Using two different data sets, the constructed Matlab code could successfully differentiate between cracks and displaced joints with an overall crack detection success rate of 84 % and an overall displaced joint detection rate of 94 %. The code was also able to efficiently detect settled deposits in the pipelines with a detection rate of 90 %.

The most common problem occurring in sewerage is leaking, whose position and failure level is typically identified through closed circuit television (CCTV) inspection {{in order to facilitate}} rehabilitation process.

Traditionally, methods used to assess the status and inventory conditions of underground infrastructures have been based on after-the-fact information. Often, these infrastructure assets get neglected until they suffer catastrophic failures, which are inconvenient and costly to repair. To determine the health of infrastructure systems, regular and accurate assessment is essential. ^ Recent advances in optical sensors and computing technologies have {{led to the development of}} inspection systems for underground facilities such as water lines, sewer pipes, and telecommunication conduits. It is now possible for inspection technologies that require no human entry into underground structures to be fully automated from data acquisition to data analysis and eventually to condition assessment.

Although <b>sewer</b> <b>pipeline</b> breakage is not an emergent problem, they may cause epidemic disasters if left unrepaired. However, it is extremely expensive to find damaged parts and very time consuming to visually inspect all sewer pipelines laid underground. This demands a low-cost fracture monitoring system for sewer pipelines. The present study proposes a new fracture monitoring system for sewer pipelines and explains its demonstration using a small sewer pipe. The fracture monitoring system adopts fracture sensors made of fabric glass and carbon black–epoxy composite materials; a small embeddable terminal is included that can {{be connected to the}} Internet. In the sensor, a carbon black sheet is sandwiched between a surface layer and a base layer: both are made from fabric glass–epoxy plies. A part of the glass fibre in the surface layer is cut perpendicular to the loading direction to make a crack starter. Direct current electric voltage is charged in the embedded carbon black sheet; then, an electric resistance is connected serially to the carbon black sheet. Electric voltage of the resistance is monitored using the embeddable tiny terminal through the Internet. When the fracture sensor is loaded, large deflection causes a crack in the crack starter; then, the crack breaks the carbon black layer. This causes electric disconnection, and electric voltage of the resistance drops to zero. This system is applied to a fracture monitoring of a sewer pipe. As a result, the system successfully monitored fracture through the Internet.
