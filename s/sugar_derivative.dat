50|$|This aminocoumarin {{antibiotic}} {{consists of}} three major substituents. The 3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid moiety, known as ring A, is derived from prephenate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. The aminocoumarin moiety, known as ring B, is derived from L-tyrosine. The final component of novobiocin is the <b>sugar</b> <b>derivative</b> L-noviose, known as ring C, which is derived from glucose-1-phosphate. The biosynthetic gene cluster for novobiocin was identified by Heide and coworkers in 1999 (published 2000) from Streptomyces spheroides NCIB 11891.

40|$|Chapter 1 {{describes}} {{the synthesis of}} a 1, 4 -dicarbonyl compound 1 which was constructed by a sequence involving opening of a protected glucose epoxide with allyl magnesium chloride, alkylation and Wacker oxidation; the 1, 4 -dicarbonyl compound 1 readily underwent cyclisation under basic conditions to produce the cyclopentaannulated <b>sugar</b> <b>derivative</b> 2. Treatment of the cyclopentaannulated <b>sugar</b> <b>derivative</b> with N-bromosuccinimide and subsequent treatment with activated zinc completed the fragmentation of 2 to furnish the cyclopentanes 3. Chapter 2 {{describes the}} reduction of 2 which furnished a mixture of allylic alcohols 4 in a ratio of 8 : 1 in favour of either isomer depending on the conditions and reagents employed. The application of a Stork silyl methylene radical cyclisation of the a-cyclopentaannulated derivative led to a 2 : 1 mixture of trans and cis fused tricyclic ring systems. Treatment of the allylic cyclopentaannulated derivative, however, led to a single cis-fused product 5.

Chapter 3 describes the continuation of work in the Jenkins group directed towards the synthesis of taxanes from glucose. A model study was undertaken to show the viability of a stepwise diene synthesis utilising selenium chemistry. This succesful model study showed that an enone to diene conversion was possible.

40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{assessing}} {{the role that the}} thymine base of TSAO-T may play in the interaction 	 of TSAO compounds with HIV- 1 reverse transcriptase (RT), we have designed, synthesized, 	 and evaluated for their anti-HIV- 1 activity a series of 3 -spiro <b>sugar</b> <b>derivatives</b> substituted at 	 the anomeric position with nonaromatic rings or with amine, amide, urea, or thiourea moieties 	 that mimic parts or the whole thymine base of TSAO-T. Also, a dihydrouracil TSAO analogue 	 and O-glycosyl 3 -spiro <b>sugar</b> <b>derivatives</b> substituted at the anomeric position with methyloxy 	 or benzyloxy groups have been prepared. Compounds substituted at the anomeric position 	 with an azido, amino, or methoxy group, respectively, were devoid of marked antiviral activity 	 (EC 50 : 10 - 200 íM). However, the substituted urea <b>sugar</b> <b>derivatives</b> led to an increase in 	 antiviral potency (EC 50 : 0. 35 - 4 íM), among them those urea derivatives that mimic most 	 closely the intact TSAO-T molecule retained the highest antiviral activity. Also, the dihy-	 drouracil TSAO derivative retained pronounced anti-HIV- 1 activity. None of the compounds 	 showed any anti-HIV- 2 activity. The results described herein represent the first examples of 	 <b>sugar</b> <b>derivatives</b> that interact in a specific manner with HIV- 1 RT. Molecular modeling studies 	 carried out with a prototype urea derivative indicate that a heteroaromatic ring is not an 	 absolute requirement for a favorable interaction between TSAO-T and HIV- 1 RT. Urea 	 derivatives, which can mimic to a large extent both the shape and the electrostatic potential 	 of a thymine ring, can effectively replace this nucleic acid base when incorporated into a TSAO 	 molecular framework with only moderate loss of activity.
