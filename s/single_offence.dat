40|$|The {{permeation}} {{of technology}} into {{our daily lives}} has resulted in new types of criminal activity and new ways of committing old crimes. As with traditional crime, fundamental to the apprehension of offenders that have adopted technology, {{is the ability to}} identify the magnitude of the incident, assess its importance and response in a timely and appropriate manner. Over the past decade many authors have highlights the difficultly of coordinating investigations in relation to electronic crime. Within Australia several strategies have been developed to assist law enforcement agencies to meet these challenges. The Australasian Police Commissioner’s Electronic Crime Strategy has seen the development of the Australian High Tech Crime Centre at a National level and in South Australia’s case the electronic crime section (ACPR 2001). These initiatives have resulted {{in the development of a}} capacity for Australian Law Enforcement agencies to respond in coordinated manner in incidences involving either high value <b>single</b> <b>offences,</b> offences involving substantial threat to life and property, organised crime or terrorist activities. However, much of the focus thus far has been on the development of the capacity to response to serious criminal activities. This paper provides two recent case examples that identify the need for the development of further strategies to enable state based Policing agencies to respond in a more coordinated and timely manner to less serious but high volume electronic crime matters.

60|$|The {{great number}} of sufferers seems to arise from the misfortune {{incident}} to the variety of judicatures which have tried the crimes. It were well, if the whole had been the business of one commission; for now every trial seems {{as if it were}} a separate business, and in that light each offence is not punished with greater severity than <b>single</b> <b>offences</b> of the kind are commonly marked: but in reality and fact, this unfortunate affair, though diversified in the multitude of overt acts, has been one and the same riot; and therefore the executions, so far as regards the general effect on the minds of men, will have a reference to the unity of the offence, and will appear to be much more severe than such a riot, atrocious as it was, can well justify in government. I pray that it may be recollected that the chief delinquents have hitherto escaped, and very many of those who are fallen into the hands of justice are a poor, thoughtless set of creatures, very little aware of the nature of their offence. None of the list-makers, the assemblers of the mob, the directors and arrangers, have been convicted. The preachers of mischief remain safe, and are wicked enough not to feel for their deluded disciples,--no, not at all. I would not plead the ignorance of the law in any, even the most ignorant, as a justification; but I am sure, that, when the question is of mercy, it is a very great and powerful argument. I have all the reason in the world to believe that they did not know their offence was capital.|$|R

50|$|A one-year {{probationary}} period {{has been applied}} to newly qualified motorcycle drivers since 2000 and to private car/light goods vehicle drivers since 2009.

Motorcycle riders may not carry passengers during probation period. A driver who commits a minor traffic offence during the probationary period will see his period extended by six months, and a second minor <b>offence</b> or a <b>single</b> serious <b>offence</b> will cancel the license entirely, forcing him to retake the driving test for another probationary licence. Drivers who complete the probationary period without incident are eligible for a full-class driving licence.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Violent {{personality}} disordered offenders {{detained in}} secure hospital care present 2 major challenges. The {{first is the}} provision of appropriate treatment, as the group is heterogeneous. Here, {{it has been suggested}} that a typology based on the degree of anger control may be useful. The second is the assessment of their risk to others. AIMS: 1) To revisit the over-undercontrolled typology by examining the evidence for distinguishing criminological and psychopathological features between violent personality disordered subjects whose index offence was their only violent <b>offence</b> (<b>Single</b> Violent offenders, SV) and those who had more than one conviction for violence (Repeat Violent Offenders, RV). 2) To explore the process of risk assessment in respect of these offenders. METHODS: 1) 51 violent personality disordered offenders detained in medium or high secure care, were divided into SV and RV groups and were compared on variables of interest. 2) The process of assessing their risk was examined using a questionnaire administered to members of the patients' multidisciplinary team. RESULTS: 1) In comparison to the RV group, the SV group were less likely to be convicted of non violent offences. They were less antisocial and psychopathic, and showed greater anger and behavioural control. 2) Although perceived agreement as to the risk of future violent behaviour of their patients was high, actual agreement within the MDT was low. Clinicians rated offence and treatment factors as more influential on their risk judgments than other historical and social factors, and structured risk assessment tools. CONCLUSIONS: There were some distinguishing features between the SV and RV groups but these appeared to be due to the undercontrolled nature of the RV group, rather than the overcontrolled nature of the SV group. Risk assessment, as recommended in the research literature was not being carried out in practice...|$|R

For example, if a woman says she has been raped by her husband every day during a month, the Swedish police may record more than 30 cases of rape. In many other countries only a <b>single</b> <b>offence</b> would be counted in such a situation.|$|E

50|$|Magistrates' courts {{today can}} deal with minor {{offences}} (fines of up to £5,000, or imprisonment of {{up to six months}} for a <b>single</b> <b>offence</b> or 12 months for consecutive sentences, or both) and handle over 95% of the criminal cases in England and Wales and Northern Ireland. With more serious offences, magistrates are responsible for indictment and committal to the Crown Court (a task in former times dealt with by a grand jury). Magistrates also have a civil jurisdiction, such as a family jurisdiction. Although they had a licensing jurisdiction dealing liquor, betting and clubs licensing applications, this was transferred under the Licensing Act 2003 to local authorities. The magistrates now act in licensing matters only as an appeal court from the decisions of the local authority.|$|E

50|$|Australia's {{approach}} to criminalising money laundering {{differs from that}} of many other countries. Division 400 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (the Criminal Code) contains the principal criminal offences of money laundering in Australia. Division 400 was inserted into the Criminal Code by the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) in January 2003. There are currently 19 different offences of money laundering available under the Criminal Code, and these can be classified into two types: those linked to the proceeds of crime (funds generated by an illegal activity) and those linked to the instruments of crime (funds used to conduct an illegal activity). Possessing the proceeds or instruments of crime is a <b>single</b> <b>offence</b> under the Criminal Code. Persons receiving, possessing, concealing, importing into Australia, exporting from Australia, or disposing of the proceeds of crime may be guilty of this offence. Possessing the proceeds of crime attracts a maximum custodial sentence of two years. The remaining 18 offences of money laundering are those of dealing with the proceeds or instruments of crime. 'Dealing with' the proceeds of crime includes all the actions considered as possession of the proceeds of crime as well as engaging in banking transactions using the illicit funds. These 18 offences are distinguished by the value of the property involved and the intent of the offender. The punishments' severity increases with the value and with the offender's knowledge of the source of the funds. The Criminal Code classifies offences according to the value of the funds involved into bands of $1,000,000 or more; $100,000 to $999,999; $50,000 to $99,999; $10,000 to $49,999; $1,000 to $9,999; and funds of any value.|$|E
40|$|Purpose The {{number of}} {{measures}} available to practitioners to assess fire interest and other fire-related attitudes is limited. To help establish {{the utility of}} such measures, this study explored whether three fire measures contained multiple factors and whether such factors related to firesetting behaviour. Method The Fire Interest Rating Scale, the Fire Attitude Scale, and the Identification with Fire Questionnaire were administered to 234 male prisoners (117 firesetters, 117 non-firesetters) and results were factor analyzed. To determine {{the relationship of the}} resulting factors with firesetting behaviour, their ability to discriminate firesetters from controls was examined and compared to the original scales. Results Responses were best represented by five factors, four of which discriminated firesetters from non-firesetters. One factor demonstrated significant accuracy in discriminating <b>single</b> <b>offence</b> firesetters from repeat firesetters. Taken together the factors offered more clarity than using the original scale outcomes and showed equivalent predictive accuracy. Conclusions The five factors identified may aid practitioners in helping to formulate the specific treatment needs of identified firesetters...|$|E
40|$|The Offenders Index {{is a rich}} {{data source}} which {{consists}} of criminal conviction information collected from the courts. While {{it has been used}} to identify, for example, the proportions of particular birth years which have had a criminal conviction, there has been little interest in how the types of offences which offenders are convicted change over time. In this paper, we describe the problem of identifying patterns of offending behaviour,with the aim of identifying criminal lifestyles and how these might change over time. A latent class approach provides the methodological basis, and allows us to identify group profiles and the likely number of groups. While many offending patterns appear to be <b>single</b> <b>offence,</b> other offenders are involved in a mix of activity, some involving violence and others not. We observe strong changes over time and across birth cohorts, with the proportion of female offenders brought before the courts rising dramatically in later cohorts. While procedural changes offer some explanation of these results, social change will also play a part...|$|E
40|$|This thesis reviews {{both the}} history and current {{comparative}} landscape {{of the law of}} assault with a view to determining the optimal approach to be taken by Scots law in structuring its crime of assault. There is very little in the current literature offering either kind of review, and equally there has been very little analysis of the desirability of a <b>single</b> <b>offence</b> versus other methods of structuring assault or non-fatal offences against the person generally. These issues are therefore addressed in this paper, starting with an extensive examination of the legal history surrounding breaches of physical integrity from the seventeenth century right up to the present day. The development of a nominate crime of assault from a ius commune understanding of ‘injuries’ is considered, along with the slow evolution of intention as the culpability element in modern cases of assault. This analysis is then utilised to critically assess the rationality and efficiency of the current approach to assault. From here, a comparative analysis of culpability and harm is undertaken, involving an in-depth study of the English law approach to gradation of offences against the person based on harm, and the Model Penal Code approach to gradation through variation of conduct in the commission of the same offence. This thesis concludes that the current approach to culpability is the correct one, but argues that an approach which utilises the conduct element of offences, such as that of the Model Penal Code, can offer a more principled approach to assault in Scots law...|$|E
