5|$|On the way home, Peter and Brian argue until Brian {{gets out}} of the car. A police officer gives Brian a ticket, for which Peter has to pay $10, for violating the local leash law, which only widens the rift between Peter and Brian. Another {{argument}} ensues and Peter mentions that he found Brian on the road as a stray dog. Angry that Peter brought that up and becoming more angry when Peter then demands that Brian <b>stop</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> bad dog, Brian leaves the house, whereupon he is treated cruelly by the community, and is (ultimately) forced to sleep at the bus shelter. Peter buys a new cat which turns out to be mischievous and abusive; the family gets rid of it and searches for Brian. By the time Peter decides to apologize to Brian, Brian has been kicked out of a restaurant and a public store and chased by the police when he was found drinking from a water fountain. Brian becomes homeless, having actually attacked a man on the street for treating him as a drunken hobo and for not believing that he was not a good dog but a crazy animal. He is subsequently taken away by the police.|$|E

Bunker was paroled in 1975, having spent eighteen {{years of his life}} in various institutions. While he was still tempted by crime, he now found himself earning a living from writing and acting. He felt that his criminal career had been forced by circumstances; now that those circumstances had changed, he could <b>stop</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> criminal.|$|E
25|$|Chuck Surack {{established}} {{the company in}} 1979 in Fort Wayne, Indiana {{so that he could}} <b>stop</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> touring musician. The company originally offered recording services via a remote recording studio in Surack's Volkswagen microbus and a recording studio based out of his home. When the Kurzweil K250 programmable keyboard and sampler was introduced in 1984, Surack became known for his custom K250 sound library and programming skills as well as his upgrade kits. Surack became a Kurzweil dealer, but his clients were asking for advice regarding other products as well. Surack expanded Sweetwater to become a music retailer whose emphasis was pre- and post-sale customer service. By 1990, with 6 employees and annual sales of $6 million, Sweetwater had outgrown Surack's home and moved into its own commercial building.|$|E

25|$|By December 1978, {{one of the}} cornerstones, Tandberg, {{filed for}} bankruptcy. The company was split up and Norsk Data {{became one of the}} shareholders, {{although}} the computer division, Tandberg Data, was spun off. In April 1979 Norsk Data agreed to take over Tandberg's training materials' division and its facilities at Skullerud in Oslo, which would give ample space for expansion. However, Parliament decided in May that they wanted Tandberg to continue operations in the same scale, and offered a NOK105-million subsidy and a large discount in the Skullerud facility to Norsk Data if they took over all of Tandberg. ND accepted the deal and paid NOK12 million for 92 percent of the company, the last part being owned by the Industrial Development Corporation of Norway. Tandberg saw a NOK13-million loss of a NOK130 million revenue in 1979, which were consolidated into Norsk Data's accounts. Not until a February 1980 deal with Mobil secured a NOK25-million advance did the company <b>stop</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> burden.|$|E

500|$|Sir Ralph Richardson (1902–1983) was an English {{actor who}} {{appeared}} on radio, film, television and stage.

500|$|Peter Hall said of Richardson, [...] "I {{think he}} was the {{greatest}} actor I have ever worked with." [...] The director David Ayliff, son of Richardson's and Olivier's mentor, said, [...] "Ralph was a natural actor, he couldn't <b>stop</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> perfect actor; Olivier did it through sheer hard work and determination." [...] Comparing the two, Hobson said that Olivier always made the audience feel inferior, and Richardson always made them feel superior. The actor Edward Hardwicke agreed, saying that audiences were in awe of Olivier, [...] "whereas Ralph would always make you feel sympathy... you wanted {{to give him a}} big hug. But they were both giants." ...|$|E
500|$|Olivier said in 1963 that he {{believed}} he was born to be an actor, but his colleague Peter Ustinov disagreed; he commented that although Olivier's great contemporaries were clearly predestined for the stage, [...] "Larry {{could have been a}} notable ambassador, a considerable minister, a redoubtable cleric. At his worst, he would have acted the parts more ably than they are usually lived." [...] The director David Ayliff agreed that acting did not come instinctively to Olivier as it did to his great rivals. He observed, [...] "Ralph was a natural actor, he couldn't <b>stop</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> perfect actor; Olivier did it through sheer hard work and determination."

500|$|In 1961 Terry-Thomas played Archibald Bannister in A Matter of WHO, {{which he}} {{described}} as [...] "my first (fairly) serious role". He was joined in the film by his second cousin Richard Briers, with Terry-Thomas noting that he provided [...] "no nepotic help" [...] in getting Briers the part. The film was not well received by the critics; an internal BBC memo described that in the UK the film was [...] "murdered by the critics", although it was [...] "something of a success" [...] in America. By this time Terry-Thomas had decided to <b>stop</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> stand-up comedian and compere and instead concentrate solely on making films. He stopped appearing on television and radio shows of his own, declaring [...] "it was the cinema for me and me for the cinema!" [...] Having accumulated considerable experience by appearing in British films, he decided to try Hollywood, and moved to America.|$|E

500|$|Suppose Crusoe {{decides to}} <b>stop</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> {{producer}} and consumer simultaneously. He decides he will produce {{one day and}} consume the next. His two roles of consumer and producer are being split up and studied separately to understand the elementary form of consumer theory and producer theory in microeconomics. For dividing his time between being a consumer and producer, he must set up two collectively exhaustive markets, the coconut market and the labour market. He also sets up a firm, of which he becomes the sole shareholder. The firm will want to maximise profits by deciding how much labour to hire and how many coconuts to produce according to their prices. As a worker of the firm, Crusoe will collect wages, as a shareholder, he will collect profits and as a consumer, he will decide {{how much of the}} firm's output to purchase according to his income and the prevailing market prices. Let's assume that a currency called [...] "Dollars" [...] has been created by Robinson to manage his finances. For simplicity, assume that PriceCoconuts = $1.00. This assumption is made to make the calculations in the numerical example easy because the inclusion of prices will not alter the result of the analysis.

2500|$|Glaswegian is a dialect, {{more than}} an {{alternative}} pronunciation; words also change their meaning depending on context, e.g. [...] "away" [...] can mean [...] "leaving" [...] as in A'm away, an instruction to <b>stop</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> nuisance as in away wi ye, or [...] "drunk" [...] or [...] "demented" [...] as in he's away wi it. Ginger is a term for any carbonated soft drink, historically referring to ginger beer (A bottle o ginger, [...] ). Then there are words whose meaning has no obvious relationship to that in standard English: coupon means [...] "face", via [...] "to punch a ticket coupon". A headbutt is known {{in many parts of}} the British Isles as a [...] "Glasgow kiss", although this term is rarely used by Glaswegians, who say [...] "Malkie", e.g., [...] "ah'll Malkie ye" [...] or [...] "stick the heid/nut on ye".|$|E

However, by 1945, their preliminary story work was halted. During the writing stages of Song of the South, Dalton S. Reymond and Maurice Rapf entered into a personal dispute, in which Raft was reassigned to write for Cinderella. In his version, Cinderella was written to be a less passive character than Snow White, and more rebellious against her stepfamily. Raft explained, [...] "My thinking was you can't have somebody who comes in and changes everything for you. You can't be delivered it on a platter. You've got to earn it. So in my version, the Fairy Godmother said, 'It's okay till midnight but from then in it's up to you.'
