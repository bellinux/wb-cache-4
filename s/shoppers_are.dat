25|$|Babin et al. {{carried out}} some of the {{earliest}} investigations into shopper motivations and identified two broad motives: utilitarian and hedonic. Utilitarian motivations are task-related and rational. For the shopper with utilitarian motives, purchasing is a work-related task that is to be accomplished in the most efficient and expedient manner. On the other hand, hedonic motives refer to pleasure. The shopper with hedonic motivations views shopping as a form of escapism where they are free to indulge fantasy and freedom. Hedonic <b>shoppers</b> <b>are</b> more involved in the shopping experience.|$|E

In addition, holiday <b>shoppers</b> <b>are</b> planning to buy even more cards this year: an average of 5.5 cards, compared with the 4.6 cards they planned to buy last year. One in six consumers (16 percent) plan to buy 10 or more cards, compared with 11 percent last year. Consumers are also spending more in total on gift cards and more per card: $36.25 per card on average compared with $30.22 last year. Gift cards continue to grow in acceptance: Almost four in 10 consumers surveyed (39 percent) would rather get a gift card than merchandise, an increase from last year’s 35 percent. Also, resistance to giving gift cards continues to decline: 19 percent say they don’t like to give gift cards because they’re too impersonal (down from 22 percent last year). Consumers said that the cards are popular gifts for adults, teens and children alike, and almost half (46 percent) intend to buy them for immediate family; however, they are hesitant to buy them for spouses or significant others, with only 14 percent saying they plan to buy them for those recipients.|$|E

The Doctor takes Rose and the plastic head to the TARDIS {{and attempts to}} use the head to locate the controlling signal. With the head connected, the TARDIS takes them to the London Eye. The Doctor explains to Rose that the fake Mickey was an Auton, controlled by a signal from the Nestene Consciousness. He [...] has a vial of anti-plastic {{that can be used}} to destroy the Nestene if necessary. Realising that the transmitter is the London Eye itself, Rose and the Doctor descend underneath it to stop the Nestene Consciousness. They find Mickey, tied up but alive, and the Doctor speaks to the Nestene Consciousness. He tries to negotiate with it, but the Consciousness blames the Doctor for the destruction of its planet during the Time War. The Consciousness activates all the Autons at a shopping arcade, where several <b>shoppers</b> <b>are</b> shot and killed, including Clive. The Doctor is also held down by a pair of Autons, but Rose rescues him and the anti-plastic drops into the vat where the Nestene Consciousness resides, killing it. With the Consciousness dead, the Autons all collapse. The Doctor uses the TARDIS to take Mickey and Rose home, then persuades Rose to join him as his new companion in the TARDIS.|$|E

[...] While interviewing Hitchens on his show, Scarborough claimed to be outraged at Moore's portrayal of the Iraqi insurgency, claiming Moore's film suggests [...] "those killing Americans in Iraq aren't the enemy, but rather they are the revolution and the Minutemen, who are sure to win their battle against the occupation" [...] and that [...] "Moore says that the enemy is George Bush and Saddam Hussein and Mr. Zarqawi and Mr. Bin Laden are no problem. ...

40|$|In {{view of the}} interrelationship between {{shopping}} and tourism, {{the increasing number of}} travellers, and the rising amount of shops and sales at the airport, insight in airport shopping motivations and airport <b>shopper</b> types <b>is</b> crucial to work out an optimal marketing strategy for airport shops. Because traditional shopping motivations and <b>shopper</b> type research <b>is</b> mainly focused on home-, clothing and grocery {{shopping and}} the specific character of an airport environment creates the impression of different shopping needs and shopper types, travellers at the Brussels airport are questioned by means of a standardized questionnaire. The results revealed two traditional shopping motivations -experiential and functional- and two motivations relating to the airport infrastructure and atmosphere. Travellers can be incited to consume by characteristics that are typical for an airport environment, with multilingual shop communication and the possibility to pay with different currencies {{on the one hand and}} impulse purchase, purchase out of boredom and purchase urged by the surrounding atmosphere on the other hand. Furthermore, three airport <b>shopper</b> types <b>were</b> distinguished: “mood shoppers”, “shopping lovers” and “apathetic shoppers”. The apathetic <b>shopper</b> <b>is</b> the most universal shopper. This type of <b>shopper</b> <b>is</b> indifferent to shopping no matter the context. “Mood shoppers” and “shopping lovers” are both motivated to purchase due to features of an airport. While the mood <b>shopper</b> <b>is</b> mostly triggered by atmospheric and mood elements typical for an airport environment, shopping lovers like shopping in all its aspects, although the airportinfrastructure appears to be an extra stimulation for purchase. ...|$|R
