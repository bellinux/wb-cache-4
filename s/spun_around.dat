5|$|Discs : Circular fossils, such as Ediacaria, Cyclomedusa and Rugoconites led to {{the initial}} {{identification}} of Ediacaran fossils as cnidaria, which include jellyfish and corals. Further examination has provided alternative interpretations of all disc-shaped fossils: not one is now confidently recognised as a jellyfish. Alternate explanations include holdfasts and protists; the patterns displayed where two meet have led to many 'individuals' being identified as microbial colonies, and yet others may represent scratch marks formed as stalked organisms <b>spun</b> <b>around</b> their holdfasts. Useful diagnostic characters are often lacking because only {{the underside of the}} organism is preserved by fossilisation.|$|E
5|$|In agriculture, the {{increased}} usage of sheep with long-fibred wool allowed a stronger thread to be spun. In addition, the spinning wheel replaced the traditional distaff for spinning wool, tripling production. A less technological refinement that still greatly affected daily {{life was the}} use of buttons as closures for garments, which allowed for better fitting without having to lace clothing on the wearer. Windmills were refined with the creation of the tower mill, allowing {{the upper part of the}} windmill to be <b>spun</b> <b>around</b> to face the direction from which the wind was blowing. The blast furnace appeared around 1350 in Sweden, increasing the quantity of iron produced and improving its quality. The first patent law in 1447 in Venice protected the rights of inventors to their inventions.|$|E
5|$|The terrier George {{was played}} by Skippy, known as Asta in The Thin Man film series and co-starring with Grant (as Mr. Smith) in The Awful Truth. The tame leopard Baby and the escaped circus leopard were both {{played by a}} trained leopard, Nissa. The big cat was {{supervised}} by its trainer, Olga Celeste, who stood by with a whip during shooting. At one point, when Hepburn <b>spun</b> <b>around</b> (causing her skirt to twirl) Nissa lunged at her and was subdued when Celeste cracked her whip. Hepburn wore heavy perfume to keep Nissa calm and was unafraid of the leopard, but Grant was terrified; most scenes of the two interacting are done in close-up with a stand-in. Hepburn played upon this fear by throwing a toy leopard through the roof of Grant's dressing room during production There were also several news reports about Hawks' difficulty filming a live leopard, and some scenes required rear-screen projection.|$|E

5|$|During {{his stay}} in Tokyo, Kenshin {{establishes}} lifelong relationships with many people, including ex-enemies, {{such as the}} former Shinsengumi member Saitō Hajime. Saitō's arrival is a test ex-Ishin Shishi Ōkubo Toshimichi made in order see Kenshin's power {{to see if he}} can defeat Shishio Makoto. Shishio is the brutal, once-successor to Kenshin's position as Chōshū's hitokiri, masterminds a movement seeking to overthrow the Meiji Government, Kenshin leaves Tokyo to stop him. To defeat such a foe, Kenshin is forced to resume his training and mend his relationship with his teacher Hiko Seijūrō, who taught and took care of him as a child. He learns the , which deals nine simultaneous strikes to the fundamental targets of swordsmanship. The Kuzu-ryūsen, however, is a by-product used for the initiation in learning his strongest technique: , a battōjutsu that surpasses the speed of the Kuzu-ryūsen. Even if the technique is defeated, it can generate a vacuum in its wake and sucking the opponent in; as this happens, the body is <b>spun</b> <b>around</b> for a second stronger strike. Throughout the training, Kenshin increasingly wants to survive to any combat so that Kaoru will not be shocked by his death. After finishing his training, Kenshin's friends reunite with him and help him defeat Shishio and his army.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{analyzing}} the unique cracks lining Europa found evidence showing that it likely <b>spun</b> <b>around</b> a tilted axis {{at some point}} in time. If correct, this would explain many of Europa's features. Europa's immense network of crisscrossing cracks serves as a record of the stresses caused by massive tides in its global ocean. Europa's tilt could influence calculations of how much of its history is recorded in its frozen shell, how much heat is generated by tides in its ocean, and even how long the ocean has been liquid. Its ice layer must stretch to accommodate these changes. When there is too much stress, it cracks. A tilt in Europa's axis could suggest that its cracks may be much more recent than previously thought. The reason is that the direction of the spin pole may change by as much as a few degrees per day, completing one precession period over several months. A tilt also could affect the estimates of the age of Europa's ocean. Tidal forces are thought to generate the heat that keeps Europa's ocean liquid, and a tilt in the spin axis means that more heat is generated by tidal forces. This heat helps the ocean to remain liquid longer. Scientists did not specify when the tilt would have occurred and measurements have not been made of the tilt of Europa's axis.|$|E
5|$|The {{championship}} resumed {{one month}} later in Belgium. Jenson Button qualified on pole and broke away at the start while a four-car pile-up started behind him when Romain Grosjean made contact with Lewis Hamilton and they both slammed into Fernando Alonso and Sergio Pérez, eliminating all four on the spot and triggering the safety car. Kamui Kobayashi's car was also damaged, and Pastor Maldonado was <b>spun</b> <b>around</b> amidst the chaos. Grosjean was later given a one-race ban for causing the collision, becoming the first driver in eighteen years to be banned from racing. Maldonado retired shortly after the restart with a broken front wing after making contact with Timo Glock, while Narain Karthikeyan spun off at Stavelot mid-way through the race when his wheel came loose. Button controlled the race from the front and was unchallenged throughout, while Sebastian Vettel clawed {{his way up to}} second from tenth on the grid. Kimi Räikkönen started and finished third, let down by a conservative pit strategy that forced him to make a second stop late in the race in order to use both compounds of tyre as per the rules – even when it became apparent that Button and Vettel were racing on a one-stop strategy – and Nico Hülkenberg finished in a career-best fourth place. Button's win allowed him to regain precious ground on the championship fight, while Alonso's retirement from the race and Vettel's second place moved the reigning World Champion to within twenty-four points of the championship lead. Scuderia Toro Rosso scored their first points since the Malaysian Grand Prix, with Jean-Éric Vergne and Daniel Ricciardo finishing eighth and ninth respectively. Further down the order, Caterham was summoned to the stewards on charges of an unsafe pit release when Heikki Kovalainen was released directly into the path of Karthikeyan and the team was given a €10,000 fine for the incident.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} venue, {{then he went}} on with Michael Bevan to score an unbeaten 73-run 9th wicket {{partnership}} to ease Australia to victory which saw him hit 34 not out. In the Super Six stage, he came in against New Zealand at 84–7. He and Michael Bevan again saved Australia with his highest score of 64 as Australia put up a winning total batting first. In the semi-final against Sri Lanka, he bowled tightly conceding 0–18 in 10 overs but his pressure caused the spectacular run out of Aravinda de Silva as he picked up <b>spun</b> <b>around</b> and threw down the stumps to prevent a tight single off his own bowling.

25|$|For his 2013 season, Vickers {{performed}} well at Bristol. His second {{ride in the}} No. 55 at Martinsville was unlucky. He had crashed in the early laps and after repairing his car, got back on the lead lap and then <b>spun</b> <b>around.</b> After again getting back on to the lead lap, on the final lap of the race he passed Danica Patrick for 11th place. Seconds later he was intentionally spun by Kevin Harvick who was angry with Vickers for prior contact. In reply Vickers bumped Harvick when entering pit road after the race was over; he climbed out and the two briefly argued. Vickers ran the No. 11 FedEx Toyota at Texas, Kansas and Richmond for an injured Denny Hamlin. Though Hamlin returned at Talladega for the Aaron's 499, Vickers substituted for him on lap 23, though he was eventually collected in The Big One less than 15 laps after the switch.|$|E

25|$|The river rose in mid-April, and by April 19, 1870, judging {{that the}} river was high {{enough to make the}} run, Captain Miller ordered lines cast off. His plan was to drift down with the current, then run the engines in reverse to gain {{steering}} control in the rapids. Going over Copper Ledge Falls, just a few hundred yards downstream, the boat first <b>spun</b> <b>around</b> three times in a powerful eddy just above the drop. Then the bow went over and the whole boat tilted sharply downwards until the sternwheel was spinning around free in the air. Once the boat hit the bottom of the drop, the sternwheel started to break up, throwing the boat out of control and into some rocks which crushed part of her bow. The boat was twisting and wracking and then a boiler valve broke, filling the engine room with steam. Captain Miller put ashore after this, and the crew repaired the vessel. Fortunately the smashed portion of the bow turned out to be above the waterline, and by 9:00a.m. the next day they were ready to proceed.|$|E
25|$|Among the Horseman's Word {{group in}} Angus, {{initiation}} ceremonies typically {{took place at}} night, preferably {{at the time of}} the full moon, in an isolated barn, byre, stable, or steading. An individual known as the High Horseman would be seated in this space, holding a cloven goat's hoof in his hand; he would preside over the ceremony. The apprentice was then stripped to the waste and blindfolded, and <b>spun</b> <b>around</b> by his fellows in order to disorient him before being brought into the ceremonial space and made to stand before the High Horseman. The High Horseman asked a series of set questions of his fellows at which they responded with a series of set answers. Turning to the initiate, who I made to kneel and has his blindfold removed, the High Horseman then commanded the newcomer to provide vows to keep to the group's secrets. This achieved, all those assembled then recited the Horseman's Creed, which reminded them of the punishments that should befall them should they break their vows. Following the ceremony, a ceilidh was held in which toasts were made and the assembled horsemen drank from whisky that the apprentice had been required to bring with him.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, NASA {{released}} a detailed report on survivability {{aspects of the}} Columbia reentry. The crew would have had {{less than a minute}} between the beginning of orbiter disintegration and depressurization. The structural failure of the left wing set off alarms in the cabin, although they {{had no way of knowing}} that the wing had broken apart as the rear of the orbiter could not be seen from the cabin. All evidence indicated that the crew frantically tried to regain control of Columbia as it began to spin out of control, but the loss of the left wing caused the orbiter to yaw to the right, exposing its underside to extreme aerodynamic forces and causing total structural disintegration. The crew cabin separated from the rest of the orbiter and rapidly depressurized, which would have killed or incapacitated the astronauts within seconds. Afterwards, the cabin <b>spun</b> <b>around</b> at high RPM, which caused the seat restraints on their upper bodies to fail. They were thus whipped around violently and pummeled by flying and falling objects from the disintegrating cabin, along with their heads and necks being slammed against the helmets, which were not designed to provide any head protection. Even if the cabin had remained structurally intact and reached a lower altitude where air could refill it, the high altitude depressurization would have been fatal to the astronauts unless they received medical attention within 5 minutes, approximately the amount of time it would take between cerebral hypoxia and brain death.|$|E

500|$|The race {{started at}} 15:00 local time. The {{conditions}} for the race were dry and cloudy with the air temperature [...] and the track temperature [...] Häkkinen, who started alongside Michael Schumacher, jumped the start and moved into the lead. Coulthard managed to accelerate faster off the line and passed Michael Schumacher for second position heading into the first corner. Further down the field, de la Rosa, Heidfeld and Diniz, collided at the first corner and collected Prost driver Jean Alesi, who was <b>spun</b> <b>around</b> by Diniz. de la Rosa, Diniz and Heidfeld all became the race's first retirements whilst Alesi managed to continue. Both Minardi drivers were forced wide in avoidance. On the same lap, Ralf Schumacher was forced onto the grass while attempting to pass Irvine, with Trulli damaging his front wing after making contact with the Jaguar. Trulli made a pit stop for a new front wing, whilst Verstappen spun off. The resulting incidents caused the deployment of the safety car.|$|E
