5|$|The VT heralded the fitment of <b>semi-trailing</b> arm {{independent}} {{rear suspension}} as standard across the range, a significant selling point over the rival Falcon, along with increased electronics such as Traction Control. However, in terms of suspension, the original Opel design was simplified by removing the toe control links that was standard equipment on the European Omega since 1987. Consequently, this afflicted the VT with excessive tyre wear due to distortions to the suspension camber angle and toe under heavy load, such as heavy towing or when travelling over undulated surfaces.|$|E
5|$|The VP {{update of}} 1991 {{featured}} cosmetic changes and mechanical however most were not visible {{unless you were}} to pull the motor down; and a very similar revised 3.8-litre V6 and 5.0-litre V8 engines from the VN were carried over. The 2.0-litre straight-four engine previously available in New Zealand was discontinued. Exterior cosmetic changes included a translucent acrylic grille on the base level Executive and Berlina, with a colour-coded grille for the S and SS, and a chrome grille for Calais. Updated tail lights and boot garnishes were {{also a part of}} the changes, which were different for each model, with the Berlina having grey stripes and the Calais chrome stripes. <b>Semi-trailing</b> arm independent rear suspension became standard on the Calais and SS, but was made an option on lower-end models in lieu of the live rear axle, improving ride and handling.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after stylists penned {{the first}} design sketches, Holden {{engineers}} {{began work on}} developing the chassis. Opel, which had {{provided the basis for}} all previous Commodore generations, ceased production of their rear-wheel drive Omega in 2003. This meant that Holden had two options: to use another GM platform, or to develop an all-new vehicle. GM's new premium rear-wheel drive Sigma platform was to see production in the 2002 Cadillac CTS. Holden's engineers were offered this platform, but decided it was not appropriate. The Sigma platform's double A-arm front suspension and extensive use of aluminium were too costly for the VE's market segment. The luggage compartment was deemed too small and the Sigma interior package could not be stretched sufficiently to become a family-sized car. In particular, the rear-seat shoulder width was too tight. These major drawbacks made Holden decide to develop an all-new platform, known as the GM Zeta platform, on which a number of forthcoming GM vehicles will also be based. The Zeta suspension system comprises new double-pivot MacPherson strut for the front and a four-link independent rear setup. These replace the previous simple MacPherson strut design front and much criticised <b>semi-trailing</b> arm rear suspension, for improved ride and handling.|$|E
40|$|Five {{years old}} poplar (Populus spp.) {{plantation}} represents an interesting model of productivity. The most attractive characteristics of this energy crop are the handling flexibility, the high yield of biomass per area unit {{and the good}} quality of the chips obtainable. The mechanical harvesting of five-years old poplar plantations {{requires the use of}} specialized forest machineries such as harvester, feller, forwarder and chipper. Usually, after felling, the working phases consist of extraction, stacking and chipping. Generally, the last one is carried out in a “static phase”, where the product is taken from staked logs by using a hydraulic arm having a gripper that feed the chipping machine. In order to introduce technological innovations for the medium rotation forestry harvesting, the Consiglio per la Ricerca e la sperimentazione in Agricoltura, Unità di ricerca per l’Ingegneria agraria (CRAING) of Monterotondo (Rome, Italy) has developed a five years poplar cutwindrower and a self-propelled chipper equipped with a pick up system. The prototype of cut-windrower is a <b>semi-trailed</b> machine powered by a 95 kW tractor (at least). It mounts a cutting system and a double pincer with variable positioning. During the cutting phase the plant is grasped by the double pincer which conveys and unloads the stem along the inter-row. The trees are placed parallel to the progress of the tractor, but oriented in the opposite direction. The biomass windrowed is then chipped in a dynamic phase directly from the inter row using the self-propelled chipper equipped with the pick-up head. In the first tests, the cut-windrower has reached an operative working capacity of 0. 22 ha h- 1, with an operative production of 44 t h- 1. On the other hand, the self-propelled chipper has showed an operative working capacity equal to 0. 18 ha h- 1, and an operative production of 35 t h- 1 about. Both machines have shown good quality of the work performed and the results obtained indicates that the work phases could be simplified in order to reduce both the time of use and the harvesting costs...|$|R
25|$|A-arm {{suspension}} (short upper arm, long lower arm) with coils {{was used}} at the front and swing axle suspension with <b>semi-trailing</b> arms, Panhard rods and a transverse semi-elliptical leaf spring was {{used at the}} rear.|$|E
25|$|The KPGC10's successor, the KPGC110, was {{released}} in 1973 after its introduction at the 1972 Tokyo motor show. Powered by a 1989cc I6 S20 engine, the second generation GT-R delivered power to the rear wheels through a 5-speed manual gearbox. This car also had both front and rear disk brakes. The suspension was a <b>semi-trailing</b> ring arm setup and minor aerodynamic parts were added.|$|E
25|$|Celica Camry {{utilizes}} the front-engine, rear-wheel-drive {{layout and}} in A40 guise, a standard four-link rigid axle suspension system with gasoline inline-four engines displacing 1.6liters for the 12T-U (TA41) and 1.8liters with the 13T-U (TA46). Initial model grades comprised: 1600 LT, 1600 XT, 1800 LT, 1800 XT, and 1800 XT Super Edition. In August 1980, Toyota released high-end models with four-wheel independent suspension, denoted A50 (front MacPherson struts, rear <b>semi-trailing</b> arm setup; four-wheel disc brakes). For the TA57 series 1800 SX, Toyota fitted the 1.8-liter 3T-EU engine. Toyota designated the new 2.0-liter grades, the 21R-U powered 2000 SE and 18R-GEU-based 2000 GT as RA56 and RA55, respectively.|$|E
25|$|In North America, Datsun marketed the 810 series Bluebird sold as the Datsun 810 from February 1977 to 1980—the direct {{ancestor}} {{of the long}} running Datsun/Nissan Maxima range. The Datsun 810 model line began with the six-cylinder Nissan Bluebird 2000G6 sold in Japan. With a longer nose than the regular Bluebird, to accommodate a longer inline-six engine, it was powered by {{two versions of the}} SOHC L-series I6 engine: a 2.0L displacement for the Japanese market and a 2.4L24E unit (as found in the Datsun 240Z) for the US market. The Bluebird G6 used a carburetor for the base model and fuel injection for the sporty version. The 2.0L engine was good for 122PS JIS (90kW), while the bigger American engine could reach 125hp SAE (93kW). The sport version channeled power through a four-speed manual transmission for the sedan and wagon, five-speed transmission for the coupe. These cars were rear-wheel drive and had a <b>semi-trailing</b> arm rear suspension. The station wagon variant, only sold in North America, had a rear live axle for load carrying reasons. Some fuel-injected versions had automatic transmissions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{standard}} transmission {{for this}} year was the W58 5-speed manual with the A43DL 4-speed automatic transmission being an option for L-types. Both transmissions featured an overdrive gear and the automatic featured a locking torque converter. The top gear in the 5-speed was its overdrive whereas the automatic transmission featured an overdrive gear that would engage at speeds over [...] The 1982 model's rear differential featured a 3.72:1 ratio. The Celica Supra's four-wheel independent suspension was specially tuned and designed by Lotus and featured variable assisted power rack-and-pinion steering and MacPherson struts up front. At the rear, it had <b>semi-trailing</b> arm suspension with coil springs and a stabilizer bar. Braking on the Celica Supra was handled by four-wheel disc brakes.|$|E
2500|$|The first Skyline GT-R, {{known by}} the {{internal}} Nissan designation PGC10, was released on 4 February 1969, and was exclusive to Japanese Nissan dealership network called Nissan Prince Store when the Prince company was integrated into Nissan operations in 1966. It was available originally as a four-door sedan after a public debut at the October 1968 Tokyo Motor Show. It was advertised alongside the Nissan R380 racecar to showcase the Skyline's racing heraldry. It was equipped with the 2.0L DOHC S20 I6 producing [...] at 7000 rpm and [...] of torque at 5600 rpm. Power was delivered to the rear wheels by a 5-speed manual transmission. The first Skyline GT-R rode on a <b>semi-trailing</b> arm strut suspension. It was available as a coupe in March 1971 with the chassis code KPGC10.|$|E
2500|$|BMW {{knew that}} it needed a four-seat family car {{to keep up with}} the rising wealth and {{expectations}} of the German people, but it could not access funding to develop a new car for this market. They therefore developed the 600, a four-seat car based on the Isetta. [...] The 600 used the front suspension, the front seats, and the front-mounted door from the Isetta, but used a new, longer ladder frame with a longer, four-seat body, a rear-mounted 0.6L flat-twin motorcycle engine, and a full-width rear track. [...] The 600's rear suspension was BMW's first use of the <b>semi-trailing</b> arm system that would be used on their sedans and coupes until the 1990s. [...] Released in 1957, the 600 could not compete against the larger, more powerful Volkswagen Beetle. [...] Production ended in 1959 after fewer than 35,000 were built.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1970, {{the third}} {{generation}} Suzuki Fronte 71 (LC10 II) two-door sedan was introduced. Its aggressive design was {{commonly referred to as}} the [...] "Sting Ray Look". The rear-engined chassis design and engine remained the same as its predecessor the LC10, although with a slightly longer [...] wheelbase. Other minor chassis differences were the addition of a front anti-roll bar and the change to a <b>semi-trailing</b> arm rear suspension layout. There were 31, 34 or 36hp versions available, the lineup being topped by the S, SS, SSS and SSS-R (the letter [...] "R" [...] merely indicating the fitment of radial tires) versions. As of May 1971 a water-cooled version, the LC10W, became available in either GL-W (34hp) or 37hp GT-W/GTR-W ("R" [...] again meaning radial tires) versions. The success of the water-cooled models led Suzuki to quickly introduce further versions, with the lesser GO-W and GS-W models (also with 34hp) appearing two months later.|$|E

50|$|Like all Z3s, the M roadster’s {{suspension}} {{is made up}} of MacPherson struts in {{the front}} and <b>semi-trailing</b> arms in the rear. However, compared to the six-cylinder Z3 roadster, the M roadster included modifications such as wider front and rear tracks (by 0.4 inches), reduced ride height (by 1.1 inches), modified front suspension geometry, firmer springs and shocks, thicker anti-roll bars, stronger <b>semi-trailing</b> arms and a reinforced subframe.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{legacy of}} the 600 was its {{independent}} <b>semi-trailing</b> arm rear suspension. This was BMW's first use of this suspension system and, {{with the exception of}} the BMW M1, it was used on every BMW production automobile until the 1990s. It was eventually supplanted by the [...] "Z-axle" [...] multi-link suspension introduced with the BMW Z1 in 1988. The last BMW cars with <b>semi-trailing</b> arm suspension were the BMW Compact and the BMW Z3.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{features}} that added to the roominess of the E30 was the suspension. The front MacPherson struts and rear <b>semi-trailing</b> arm suspension were a compact arrangement that left a lot of cabin and boot space for the car's overall size. The <b>semi-trailing</b> arms {{have been criticized for}} the dynamic toe & camber changes inherent to the suspension geometry, causing bump steer in hard cornering situations (such as racing and autocross). This has contributed to the E30 as having a reputation for [...] "tail happy" [...] handling, where rear grip is reduced in certain situations, leading to oversteer.|$|E
5000|$|The three-box four-door saloon was in {{many ways}} conventional, using a unitary {{structure}} and MacPherson strut front suspension which were becoming mainstream {{by the time of the}} 1500s introduction. Less conventional was the independent rear suspension, which featured coil springs and <b>semi-trailing</b> wishbones pivoted from a stout cross beam that also supported the differential housing. [...] While BMW was using MacPherson struts for their first time on the New Class, they had used unit body construction on the 700 and <b>semi-trailing</b> arm rear suspension on the 600 and the 700. All New Class cars had front disc brakes.|$|E
50|$|Notable {{problems}} that developed with the 1500 included {{separation of the}} <b>semi-trailing</b> arm mounts from the body, rear axle failure, and gearbox problems. These were resolved in later versions of the New Class sedan.|$|E
50|$|Front {{suspension}} {{consists of}} MacPherson struts and the rear suspension is independent <b>semi-trailing</b> arms. In 1982, the front suspension was upgraded to include twin-pivot lower control {{arms and the}} geometry of the rear suspension was revised.|$|E
50|$|The 280ZX adopted {{suspension}} {{similar to}} that of the concurrent Bluebird 910, with MacPherson struts in front and <b>semi-trailing</b> arm independent suspension in the rear. The wheelbase was up from its predecessor (90.7 in) to 91.3 in for the two-seater.|$|E
50|$|As in the Triumph 2000 model line, unitary {{construction}} was employed, as was fully independent suspension - MacPherson struts in front, <b>semi-trailing</b> arms at the rear. Braking was by front disc and rear drum brakes, while steering was power-assisted rack and pinion.|$|E
50|$|The {{suspension}} was redesigned using {{coil springs}} instead of torsion bars, {{the first major}} engineering changes since the original 911. The front suspension used MacPherson struts, {{a system that has}} continued for all subsequent versions, but the rear suspension retained <b>semi-trailing</b> arms.|$|E
50|$|The E36/5 {{made use}} of the older <b>semi-{{trailing}}</b> arm rear axle, {{as opposed to the}} E36's Z-Axle Multi-link suspension. As the trailing arm design was smaller, it allowed for a lower trunk floor height, fold-down rear seats, and an exterior undermounted compact spare tire.|$|E
50|$|The Magic Iris is {{made using}} an {{all steel body}} and frame - {{reinforced}} by reverse hat section chassis rails and beams, welded under its floor.The vehicle features all-around independent suspension with coil springs - MacPherson struts in the front, and <b>semi-trailing</b> arms in the rear.|$|E
50|$|More {{unconventional}} {{was the use}} of a backbone chassis and four-wheel independent suspension.A-arm suspension (short upper arm, long lower arm) with coils {{was used}} at the front and swing axle suspension with <b>semi-trailing</b> arms, Panhard rods and a transverse semi-elliptical leaf spring was used at the rear.|$|E
50|$|Steering is by {{rack and}} pinion and has a {{comparatively}} low ratio. MacPherson strut suspension is used at the front and <b>semi-trailing</b> arms at the rear. Brakes are by disc and single-piston calipers at the front, with drums at the rear also serving for handbrake function, via cables.|$|E
5000|$|In November 1981, {{the range}} was {{supplemented}} by an attractive Škoda Garde, which {{was equipped with}} the 1174 cc, [...] engine from the 120 LS and 120 GLS Saloon models. This had much improved <b>semi-trailing</b> arm rear suspension, and {{paved the way for}} the 130-136 models of the late 1980s.|$|E
50|$|Wishbone and {{multi-link}} {{allow the}} engineer {{more control over}} the geometry, to arrive at the best compromise, than swing axle, MacPherson strut or swinging arm do; however the cost and space requirements may be greater. <b>Semi-trailing</b> arm is in between, being a variable compromise between the geometries of swinging arm and swing axle.|$|E
50|$|The Shamal used a {{traditional}} front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout and an all-steel unibody construction. Suspension was by MacPherson struts upfront and <b>semi-trailing</b> arms at the rear. All Shamals were {{equipped with an}} adaptive suspension developed by Maserati together with Koni. The system varied the damping rates, based on road conditions {{and the level of}} comfort desired.|$|E
50|$|A widened {{version of}} the E30 front {{suspension}} and the drivetrain from the E30 325i {{were used in the}} BMW Z1 roadster. The BMW Z3 (E36/4) and BMW Compact (E36/5) rear suspensions are also very similar to the E30, but utilizing five-lug hubs. The BMW M Coupe uses a widened {{version of the}} same rear <b>semi-trailing</b> arm suspension.|$|E
50|$|A beam axle's {{fore and}} aft {{location}} is constrained by either: trailing arms, <b>semi-trailing</b> arms, radius rods, or leaf springs. The lateral location is constrained by either: a Panhard rod, a Scott Russell linkage or a Watt's linkage. While shock absorbers and either leaf springs, coil springs, or air bags are used to control vertical movement.|$|E
50|$|The {{cars in the}} Biturbo {{family were}} of unibody steel construction, with a {{conventional}} layout of front-longitudinally mounted engine and gearbox. Suspension was of the MacPherson strut type upfront and <b>semi-trailing</b> arms at the rear, with coil springs, double-acting dampers and anti-roll bars on both axles. The differential and rear suspension arms were supported by a subframe.|$|E
50|$|The floorpans {{came from}} the Type 1 Karmann Ghia, which had a wider floorpan than the Beetle. Rear swing axle {{suspension}} with reduction gearing from the discontinued split-screen Volkswagen Transporter was used until 1973, when it was replaced with double-jointed axles used by Porsche and IRS <b>semi-trailing</b> arm setup as used on the 1303 and US-spec Beetles.|$|E
