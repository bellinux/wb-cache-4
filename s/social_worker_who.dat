It provides insights into what sustains these workers and how they integrate a range of knowledge, values, and skills in their work. The research findings suggest that experienced Aboriginal and non Aboriginal <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> prioritise the development of relationships with their Aboriginal clients and communities, which are characterised by reciprocity, the integration and valuing of Aboriginal and Western worldviews, {{and the application of}} microskills such as deep listening and stillness.
