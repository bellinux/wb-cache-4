5|$|Although {{competitions}} are {{no longer}} held outdoors, the most important competitions (Olympics, World Championships, World Cups) are still scheduled for the Northern Hemisphere <b>summer</b> <b>season</b> because they are combined with outdoor events. Many lesser international events, however, are held during the European indoor season between October and March, culminating in the European Championships each year. Most of these competitions are multi-day events held together with air rifle matches.|$|E
5|$|An amended {{version of}} the show toured across Britain in 1987. Sallis was {{reluctant}} {{to appear in the}} new production, and his role in the show was rewritten and played by Derek Fowlds.

40|$|The present work in {{relation}} to occurrence of Deuteromycotinous fungal flora over the groundnut fields (Arachis hypogaea L.) {{was carried out in}} winter and <b>summer</b> <b>seasons</b> of the years 2009 - 10 and 2010 - 11 using continuous Volumetric Tilak air sampler. Results revealed that the spores of Aspergillus and Cercospora occurred predominantly. Aspergillus spores contributed 8. 24 % and 4. 31 % in I and II winter seasons and 3. 67 % and 4. 08 % during I and II <b>summer</b> <b>seasons</b> respectively.

Curvularia spores contributed 0. 62 % and 1. 22 % during I and II winter seasons and 0. 32 % and 0. 98 % during I and II <b>summer</b> <b>seasons</b> respectively. Cladosporium spores contributed 1. 54 % and 1. 56 % in I and II winter seasons and 1. 35 % and 1. 73 % in I and II <b>summer</b> <b>seasons</b> respectively...|$|R
40|$|Hemolymph {{osmolarity}} {{has great}} effect on honey bee health, especially in arid and semi-arid zones. It regulates water and nutrients in stressed tissues. Osmotic concentration in three races (Apis mellifera ligustica, A. m. carnica and A. m. jemenitica) of Apis mellifera was tested in central Saudi Arabia during spring and <b>summer</b> <b>seasons</b> in 2015. Newly emerged bee workers were first marked and later their hemolymph was extracted after intervals of 1, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25  days. A significant {{positive correlation between}} age and osmolarity was found in all three races during spring and <b>summer</b> <b>seasons.</b> The lowest combined osmotic concentration for all three races was found after 1  day interval, while the highest osmotic concentration was recorded after 25  days. Among all races, A. m. ligustica showed significantly high osmotic concentration after 25  days in spring and <b>summer</b> <b>seasons</b> {{as compared to the}} other two races. Only A. m. jemenitica showed similar osmotic concentration after 10 and 15  days in both spring and <b>summer</b> <b>seasons</b> compared to other two races. Mean osmotic concentration of all three races was significantly different after 20 and 25  days in spring and <b>summer</b> <b>seasons.</b> Overall mean recorded during summer was significantly higher than the mean of spring season. Combined osmotic concentration in young drones of all races was significantly lower than that of old drones during spring and <b>summer</b> <b>seasons...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{simplest}} {{method of}} forecasting the weather, persistence, relies upon today's conditions to forecast the conditions tomorrow. This {{can be a}} valid way of forecasting the weather when {{it is in a}} steady state, such as during the <b>summer</b> <b>season</b> in the tropics. This method of forecasting strongly depends upon the presence of a stagnant weather pattern. Therefore, when in a fluctuating weather pattern, this method of forecasting becomes inaccurate. It can be useful in both short range forecasts and long range forecasts.|$|E
5|$|As seas {{surrounding}} Banton can {{be rough}} during the wet season, {{the best time}} to visit the island is from March to May during the dry (<b>summer)</b> <b>season.</b> This is also the typical time for Asi families living in Metro Manila or abroad to visit the island since it coincides with the Lenten season and barangay fiestas. Within the island, the main forms of transportation are passenger motorcycles (known elsewhere as habal-habal) and motorized boats. A circumferential road connects the 17 barangays of Banton to each other.|$|E

5|$|For its United States release, {{the film}} was {{originally}} scheduled to be released on November 25, 2015, but 20th Century Fox switched The Martian with Victor Frankenstein, so the former would be its first film for all audiences in the country's Autumn season (September–November). On the film's 3D screenings, RealD's chief Anthony Marcoly said 3D technology was proliferating from action-packed blockbuster films commonly released in the United States' <b>summer</b> <b>season.</b> Marcoly said the technology was being used in more immersive storytelling, citing The Martian and The Walk (released the same year) as two examples.|$|E
5|$|For {{those who}} {{remained}} new economic opportunities emerged through the export of cattle, commercial fishing and tourism. During the <b>summer</b> <b>season</b> in the 1860s and 1870s five thousand inhabitants of Lewis {{could be found in}} Wick on the mainland of Scotland, employed on the fishing boats and at the quaysides. Nonetheless emigration and military service became the choice of many and the archipelago's populations continued to dwindle throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries. By 2001 the population of North Uist was only 1,271.|$|E

5|$|In cool {{temperate}} regions, conifers often predominate; {{a widely}} distributed climax {{community in the}} far north of the northern hemisphere is moist taiga or northern coniferous forest (also called boreal forest). Taiga is the world's largest land biome, forming 29% of the world's forest cover. The long cold winter of the far north is unsuitable for plant growth and trees must grow rapidly in the short <b>summer</b> <b>season</b> when the temperature rises and the days are long. Light is very limited under their dense cover {{and there may be}} little plant life on the forest floor, although fungi may abound. Similar woodland is found on mountains where the altitude causes the average temperature to be lower thus reducing the length of the growing season.|$|E

5|$|In the sonnet, {{the speaker}} asks {{whether or not}} he should compare his beloved to the <b>summer</b> <b>season,</b> and argues that he should not because the {{comparison}} does not properly express the depths of his emotion. He also states that his beloved will live on forever through the words of the poem. Scholars have found parallels within the poem to Ovid's Tristia and Amores, both of which have love themes. Sonnet 18 is written in the typical Shakespearean sonnet form, having 14 lines of iambic pentameter ending in a rhymed couplet. Detailed exegeses have revealed several double meanings within the poem, giving it a greater depth of interpretation.|$|E
