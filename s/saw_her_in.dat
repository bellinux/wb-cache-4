5|$|George {{was invited}} to meet with Grey's Anatomy {{executive}} producers after the show's casting agents <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> the 2008 television drama, In Treatment. The actress' original contract included eight to eleven episodes of recurring appearances in season five, {{with the possibility of}} becoming a series regular. She was originally planned to be a romantic foil for Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith) and Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), but the role was retooled after the former departed in November 2008.|$|E
5|$|Leigh next {{sought the}} role of Blanche DuBois in the West End stage {{production}} of Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire and was cast after Williams and the play's producer Irene Mayer Selznick <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> The School for Scandal and Antigone; Olivier was contracted to direct. The play contained a rape scene and references to promiscuity and homosexuality, and {{was destined to be}} controversial; the media discussion about its suitability added to Leigh's anxiety. Nevertheless, she believed strongly in the importance of the work.|$|E
5|$|Madonna looks both {{older and}} younger than she does in the photos and the videos: a little more lined and {{possibly}} tired, but also less mature and grand. Her manner is quite teenaged, not femme fatale. She seems up for mischief, and yet quite conscious of her power. At the same time, her very frankness is almost innocent. These combinations are odd, and they give her {{the air of a}} prematurely wise child. Her current style is 1930s Hollywood meets early 1970s flash: Jean Harlow and Angie Bowie. She is not bewitching, but is certainly beautiful. She wears the nose stud that so troubled Norman Mailer in a recent interview. If you <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> the street, you'd think: she looks like a girl who looks a bit like Madonna.|$|E

25|$|On 7 April 1779, a {{few weeks}} after his {{ordination}} as a priest of the Church of England, Hackman followed Martha Ray to Covent Garden, where she had gone to watch a performance of Isaac Bickerstaffe's comic opera Love in a Village with her friend and fellow singer Caterina Galli. Suspecting that Ray had a new lover, when Hackman <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> the theatre with William Hanger, 3rd Baron Coleraine, he left, fetched two pistols, and waited in a nearby coffee house. After Ray and Galli came out of the theatre, Hackman approached the ladies just as they were about to get into their carriage. He put one pistol to Ray's forehead and shot her dead. With the other he then tried to kill himself but made only a flesh wound. He then beat himself with both discharged pistols until he was arrested and taken, with Martha Ray's body, into a tavern in St James's Street. Two letters were found on Hackman, one addressed to his brother-in-law, Frederick Booth, and a love letter to Martha Ray: both later appeared in evidence at the murder trial.|$|E

Cast {{in her first}} movie role, Hart was {{discovered}} by Wallis after he <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> a production of Joan of Lorraine at Loyola University. He screen-tested Hart on January 16, 1957, and later signed her for US$250 a week. Then named Dolores Hicks, Wallis requested her to change her name to favor her acting career. She adopted Hart, after the maiden surname of a friend. The actress changed it legally to [...] "Dolores Hart". A year after Loving You, Hart was cast as Presley's love interest in his 1958 black-and-white musical drama, King Creole.|$|E

She then portrayed Mariane Pearl in the drama A Mighty Heart (2007), and lent {{her voice to}} the computer-animated film Kung Fu Panda (2008). The 2008 action thriller Wanted, which <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> a supporting role, proved to be a commercial success. Her next appearance was as Christine Collins in the drama Changeling (2008), which earned her an Academy Award for Best Actress nomination. This was followed by lead roles in two of 2010's top-grossing thrillersSalt and The Tourist. In 2011, she directed the romantic drama In the Land of Blood and Honey, which depicted a love story set during the Bosnian War, and appeared in the animation sequel Kung Fu Panda 2. Jolie's biggest commercial success, as of 2014, came with the dark fantasy film Maleficent (2014), which grossed over $758 million worldwide, and featured her in the eponymous role. Later in the same year, she directed Unbroken (2014), a war drama based on a 2010 [...]|$|E
500|$|Ronalds was {{separated}} from her American husband, but they never divorced. Social conventions of the time compelled Sullivan and Ronalds to keep their relationship private. In his diary, he would refer to her as [...] "Mrs. Ronalds" [...] when he <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> a public setting, but [...] "L. W." [...] (for [...] "Little Woman") or [...] "D. H." [...] (possibly [...] "Dear Heart") when they were alone together, often with a number in parentheses indicating the number of sexual acts completed. Ronalds was apparently pregnant {{on at least two}} occasions and procured abortions in 1882 and 1884. Sullivan had a roving eye, and his diary records the occasional quarrel when Ronalds discovered his other liaisons, but he always returned to her. She was a constant companion up to the time of Sullivan's death, but around 1889 or 1890, the sexual relationship seems to have ended. He started to refer to her in the diary as [...] "Auntie", and the tick marks indicating sexual activity were no longer there, although similar notation continued to be used for his relationships with other women who have not been identified, and who were always referred to by their initials.|$|E
500|$|Selznick {{had been}} quietly {{considering}} Vivien Leigh, a young English actress {{who was still}} little known in America, {{for the role of}} Scarlett since February 1938 when Selznick <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> Fire Over England and A Yank at Oxford. Leigh's American agent was the London representative of the Myron Selznick talent agency (headed by David Selznick's brother, one of the owners of Selznick International), and she had requested in February that her name be submitted for consideration as Scarlett. By the summer of 1938 the Selznicks were negotiating with Alexander Korda, to whom Leigh was under contract, for her services later that year. Selznick's brother arranged for them to meet {{for the first time on}} the night of December 10, 1938, when the burning of Atlanta was filmed. In a letter to his wife two days later, Selznick admitted that Leigh was [...] "the Scarlett dark horse", and after a series of screen tests, her casting was announced on January 13, 1939. Just before the shooting of the film, Selznick informed newspaper columnist Ed Sullivan: [...] "Scarlett O'Hara's parents were French and Irish. Identically, Miss Leigh's parents are French and Irish." ...|$|E

Minaj spits her first verse in a spacious room filled with antler heads and wacky windows, Minaj is seen standing on a zebra print carpet. Minaj's second appearance <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> a bathtub, partially clothed - wearing only Alexander McQueen “Armadillo” jewel encrusted 12-inch stiletto shoes. She also wore a green, Marilyn Monroe inspired wig. There is also a scene with all three rappers. After the hook, Rick Ross is seen sitting at a gold banquet table reciting his rap, shirtless, whilst gold maniquins ascend behind him. For Cam'ron's verse the scene is located on a staircase of moving photos of the three rappers. Nicki's Young Money labelmate, Tyga also made a brief cameo appearance in the video. The video garnered positive reviews from critics, noting its high energy, fun and wackiness. MTV's Rob Markman gave the video a positive review saying, [...] "Only in a Nicki Minaj video can you find two of rap's hardest street figures performing in such a wacky setting, but it's the juxtaposition that [...] "I Am Your Leader" [...] offers which makes it so fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Around this time, Dickinson's {{behavior}} {{began to}} change. She {{did not leave}} the Homestead unless it was absolutely necessary and as early as 1867, she began to talk to visitors {{from the other side}} of a door rather than speaking to them face to face. She acquired local notoriety; she was rarely seen, and when she was, she was usually clothed in white. Dickinson's one surviving article of clothing is a white cotton dress, possibly sewn circa 1878–1882. Few of the locals who exchanged messages with Dickinson during her last fifteen years ever <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> person. Austin and his family began to protect Emily's privacy, deciding that she was not to be a subject of discussion with outsiders. Despite her physical seclusion, however, Dickinson was socially active and expressive through what makes up two-thirds of her surviving notes and letters. When visitors came to either the Homestead or the Evergreens, she would often leave or send over small gifts of poems or flowers. Dickinson also had a good rapport with the children in her life. Mattie Dickinson, the second child of Austin and Sue, later said that [...] "Aunt Emily stood for indulgence." [...] MacGregor (Mac) Jenkins, the son of family friends who later wrote a short article in 1891 called [...] "A Child's Recollection of Emily Dickinson", thought of her as always offering support to the neighborhood children.|$|E
500|$|Pollin largely {{agrees with}} Todd, speculating that Imlay saw Percy Shelley in Bath and he [...] "somehow failed her", {{causing her to}} commit suicide. Seymour and others {{speculate}} that Shelley's only failure was {{to live up to}} his financial promises to Godwin and it was this that helped push Imlay over the edge; she was convinced, like her father, [...] "that the worthy have an absolute right to be supported by those who have the worth to give". Todd, on the other hand, agrees with Pollin and speculates that Imlay went to see Mary Godwin and Shelley. Todd argues that Imlay had affection for Shelley and felt that his home was her only haven. Relying on scraps of poetry that Shelley may have written after Imlay's death, Todd concludes that Shelley <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> Bath and rejected her pleas because he needed to protect Claire's reputation as well as his own at this time. Todd also notes that Imlay had worn her mother's stays, which were embroidered with the initials [...] "M.W.", and the nicest clothes she owned. She had adorned herself with a Swiss gold watch sent to her from Geneva by the Shelleys and a necklace, in order to make a good impression. After Shelley rejected her, Todd concludes, Imlay decided to commit suicide.|$|E

500|$|Shelley {{wrote to}} his wife Mary that Allegra looked pale and quiet when he <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> 1818. When he saw her again in 1821 at the Capuchin convent in Bagnacavallo, when she was four, he again felt she looked pale and {{delicate}} and was infuriated by the Roman Catholic education she was receiving, though he had initially told Byron he approved of her being sent to a convent. [...] "(Besides) Paradise & angels ... she has a prodigious list of saints—and is always talking of the Bambino ... The idea of bringing up so sweet a creature {{in the midst of}} such trash till Sixteen!" [...] he wrote." [...] However, though Shelley thought the little girl was more serious and contemplative than he remembered, he said she had not lost her [...] "excessive vivacity." [...] After five months in the convent school, her behaviour had also improved; she obeyed the nuns readily and was well-disciplined, though Shelley didn't think the nuns had been too severe with her. The child asked Shelley to [...] "tell her mother she wanted a kiss and a gold dress and would he please beg her Papa and Mammina to visit her." [...] Allegra no longer had any real memory of Clairmont, but had grown attached to [...] "her Mammina," [...] Byron's mistress Teresa, Countess Guiccioli, who had mothered her. Teresa gave the little girl her own childhood toys and played with her when she spent weeks recovering from a childhood illness.|$|E
500|$|The role of {{the chief}} witch Muriel, {{described}} by Arterton as [...] "the queen bee of witches", was given to Dutch actress Famke Janssen. Janssen too described the film as [...] "Tarantino-esque", with [...] "a lot of blood, gore and exploding witches." [...] Wirkola {{said he had a}} crush on Janssen since he <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> GoldenEye as Xenia Onatopp, [...] "an amazing villain," [...] and that in his opinion her being not only a good actress but also a beautiful woman who is [...] "huge" [...] and [...] "menacing somehow" [...] made her [...] "a perfect combination" [...] of [...] "sexy and dangerous". Janssen said that at first the initial appeal was just money, but she quickly took a liking of the script and of Wirkola personally. She also thought the idea of playing an [...] "evil to the core" [...] witch [...] "was appealing and different", saying, [...] "I hadn't done anything like it…A character like a witch feels like you would have so much freedom, because there are no restrictions as to what you can do." [...] Later, however, she was constantly being distracted by the special effects work and felt that she [...] "really understood the character" [...] only {{in one part of the}} film. She found the time-consuming process of applying such makeup (taking three hours to apply and one hour to remove) [...] "very strange" [...] and also felt restricted and afraid of acting over-the-top in her witch role. In the end, she still had [...] "a lot of fun" [...] playing someone who is completely evil, and felt that it was [...] "so empowering" [...] to have [...] "an inner witch to get in touch with once in a while." [...] Janssen said the film might appeal to women and girls, too: [...] "There's a brother and a sister story. And there's a romance in it too - but obviously not with the witch. Nobody falls in love with the witch." ...|$|E
