40|$|Abstract. This paper studied {{impedance}} control {{problem for}} a biped skating robot. Impedance control for ground reaction force which is realized through varying load impedance between supporting leg and ground to maintain flexible contact is vital to motion control problem. Biped skating motion {{is divided into three}} phase, i. e. leg swing phase, weight reception phase and supporting phase. During weigh reception and supporting phase, one the of the robot legs has pushed onto ground to generated reaction force which must be controlled for dynamic stability. During swing phase a PID controller is used. Impedance control is realized by varying the load impedance between supporting leg and ground to maintain flexible contact. By proposed impedance control method, a dynamic stable <b>skating</b> <b>movement</b> controller was successfully developed for the biped robot with skating speed of 0. 13 m/s...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{main goal}} {{of this study was}} to {{investigate}} the influence of the extension of the support leg's joints during the repositioning phase of an ice dancing push-off on performance. The second objective was to identify the relevant kinematic parameters of this <b>skating</b> <b>movement.</b> Seven international level skaters were filmed in the sagittal plane while performing two starting push-offs. Extending the support leg's lower limb joints completed the first push-off. In the second push-off, subjects kept these joints flexed in a static position. Results pointed out that the extension of the support leg's joints significantly increased the push-off length and velocity by 9 % and 6 % respectively. The temporal structure of the push-off was not altered by the two testing conditions. Regarding the angular parameters of the support leg during the repositioning phase, the knee joint amplitude, average knee angular velocity and peak thigh velocity were positively related to the push-off velocity. Considering the above results, coaches should now focus on the development of the knee extensors' power during off-ice training sessions. This would enhance the velocity of the skater during the repositioning phase solely from the action of one lower limb...|$|E

5000|$|Intersection: An {{intersection}}, {{also known}} as a pass through, is when the skaters skate towards each other in lines and intersect. The intersection can be two lines, such as an angled intersection, but can have three or four lines, such as a triangle or box. At the point of intersection skaters could do turns or free <b>skating</b> <b>movements</b> to increase the difficulty. The entry to the intersection can be made more difficult by intersecting from an angle or from a whip.|$|R
40|$|More than 3000 years ago, peoples {{living in}} the cold North European regions started {{developing}} tools such as ice skates {{that allowed them to}} travel on frozen lakes. We show here which technical and technological changes determined the main steps in the evolution of ice-skating performance over its long history. An in-depth historical research helped identify the skates displaying significantly different features from previous models and that could consequently determine a better performance in terms of speed and energy demand. Five pairs of ice skates were tested, from the bone-skates, dated about 1800 BC, to modern ones. This paper provides evidence {{for the fact that the}} metabolic cost of locomotion on ice decreased dramatically through history, the metabolic cost of modern ice-skating being only 25 % of that associated with the use of bone-skates. Moreover, for the same metabolic power, nowadays skaters can achieve speeds four times higher than their ancestors could. In the range of speeds considered, the cost of travelling on ice was speed independent for each skate model, as for running. This latter finding, combined with the accepted relationship between time of exhaustion and the sustainable fraction of metabolic power, gives the opportunity to estimate the maximum skating speed according to the distance travelled. Ice skates were probably the first human powered locomotion tools to take the maximum advantage from the biomechanical properties of the muscular system: even when travelling at relatively high speeds, the <b>skating</b> <b>movement</b> pattern required muscles to shorten slowly so that they could also develop a considerable amount of force...|$|E
40|$|In {{the sport}} of long track speed skating, in recent {{years there has been}} an {{increasing}} desire for training tools which provide deeper technical insight of the <b>skating</b> <b>movement</b> to the athlete and coaches. In previous literature a variety of measurement systems have been presented; one such system included the instrumented klapskate developed at the Delft University of Technology. Alongside the implementation of this new instrumented klapskate, a simplified piezo-resistive pressure sensor system has been applied with high performance Dutch speed skaters; however, to this point the best application of such a system has not been shown. This research examined the potential ways in which this simplified system may provide valuable feedback to a skater, with consideration for the feedback currently available within the sport. Through a combination of bench and on-ice testing, the system was evaluated for its ability to predict skating forces (normal, lateral, and absolute), the center of pressure of force application, peak stroke force, and finally, contact time for individual strokes. Despite an inability to generate a full profile of skating force, the PRPS system provided reasonable estimations of peak stroke normal (RMSE = 50. 2 N) and absolute (RMSE = 50. 5 N) forces in the straights, while in the curve, peak normal (RMSE = 129. 4) and absolute (RMSE = 131. 5 N) force estimates were less accurate. Stroke timing was predicted with accuracy, giving minor underestimation in both the straight (RMSE = 0. 0671 s) and curves (RMSE = 0. 0474 s). Center of pressure measurement was largely unsuccessful when attempted on the bench using a tensile load cell, however estimations applied to on-ice data yielded trends in center of pressure position consistent with previous literature, suggesting future viability as a feedback parameter. For future work, a larger sample size and further on-ice testing would be recommended for verification and improved development of this prototype system. Mechanical Engineerin...|$|E

50|$|The {{idea of a}} hinging skate was {{described}} and patented in 1894 by Karl Hannes, from Raitenhaslach, Burghausen. It was re-invented by Gerrit Jan van Ingen Schenau, who started work on a hinged speed skate in 1979, created his first prototype in 1980 and finished his PhD thesis on the subject in 1981 {{on the premise that}} a skater would benefit from the extended <b>movement</b> with the <b>skate</b> on the ice, allowing the calf muscles to longer partake in the <b>skate</b> <b>movement.</b> The construction of the hinge was refined further in collaboration with Viking. In 1985 Ron Ket was the first to ride the clap skates in an officially timed setting, a 500-meter sprint on the Jaap Eden baan, clocking in on a promising 40.65. In February 1986 Henk Gemser who was coaching the Dutch national speedskating squad at that time expressed his intention to start training with the clap skate, though no subsequent trials were run on the new skate. In the 1986-1987 season a small number of marathon skaters intended to use the clap skate competitively, but its use was prohibited by match officials due to increased risk of physical harm to the skaters in case of a fall. The then current Dutch speed skating top professionals Ids Postma, Bart Veldkamp and Rintje Ritsma were unimpressed by the skate.|$|R

40|$|Synchronized bipedal {{movements}} of the pelvic fins provide propulsion (punting) during displacement on the substrate in batoids with benthic locomotion. In skates (Rajidae) this mechanism is mainly generated by the crural cartilages. Although lacking these anatomical structures, some stingray species show modifications of their pelvic fins to aid in benthic locomotion. This study describes {{the use of the}} pelvic fins for locomotory performance and body re-orientation in the freshwater stingray Potamotrygon motoro (M&# 252;ller & Henle, 1841) during foraging. Pelvic fin {{movements of}} juvenile individuals of P. motoro were recorded in ventral view by a high-speed camera at 250 - 500 fields/s- 1. Potamotrygon motoro presented synchronous, alternating and unilateral {{movements of the}} pelvic fins, similar to those reported in <b>skates.</b> Synchronous <b>movements</b> were employed during straightforward motion for pushing the body off the substrate as well as for strike feeding, whereas unilateral movements were used to maneuver the body to the right or left during both locomotion and prey capture. Alternating movements of the pelvic fins are similar to bipedal movements in terrestrial and semi-aquatic tetrapods. The pelvic fins showed coordinated movements during feeding even when stationary, indicating that they have an important function in maintaining body posture (station holding) during prey capture and manipulation. The use of pelvic fins during prey stalking may be advantageous because it results in less substrate disturbance when compared to movements generated by pectoral fin undulation. The range of pelvic fin movements indicates more complex control and coordination of the pelvic radial muscles...|$|R
40|$|Here {{we present}} a method for high-precision {{drilling}} using an industrial robot with high-bandwidth force feedback, which is used for building up pressure to clamp up an end-effector to the work-piece surface prior to drilling. The focus is to eliminate the sliding <b>movement</b> (<b>skating)</b> of the end-effector during the clamp-up of the end-effector to the workpiece surface, an undesired effect that {{is due to the}} comparatively low mechanical stiffness of typical serial industrial robots. This compliance also makes the robot deflect due to the cutting forces, resulting in poor hole position accuracy and to some extent in poor hole quality. Recently, functionality for high-bandwidth force control has found its way into industrial robot control systems. This could potentially open up the possibility for robotic drilling systems with improved performance, using only standard systems without excessive extra hardware and calibration techniques. Instead of automation with expensive fixtures and precise machinery, our approach was to make use of standard low-cost robot equipment in combination with sensor feedback. The resulting sliding suppression control results in greatly improved hole positioning and quality. The conceptual idea behind the force control is useful also in many other robotic applications requiring external sensor feedback control...|$|R
