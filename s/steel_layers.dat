40|$|AbstractLayered {{cylindrical}} {{vessels are}} used widely in process industries. During the girth welding of layered-to-layered sections, residual stresses are generated and influence the structure integrity. In this paper, the Finite Element Method (FEM) {{was used to}} predict the residual stresses in a layered-to-layered joint. The results of numerical calculation show that large residual stresses are generated in the weld and Heat Affect Zone (HAZ). Due to the material mismatching between inner stainless <b>steel</b> <b>layer</b> and outer low alloy <b>steel</b> <b>layer,</b> discontinuous stress distributions occurred. The gap between discrete layers has a great effect on the residual stress in HAZ. Through the whole vessel thickness of multi-layers, the stress distributions in layers are not continuous...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{multilayer}} piping {{has been}} used widely. Multilayer piping has excellent durability and corrosion resistance. An effective means for quality maintenance of multilayer piping is the laser ultrasonic technique for checking the state of adhesion of the vinyl chloride <b>layer</b> and the <b>steel</b> <b>layer</b> of multilayer piping. The wave is refracted at the interface between the <b>steel</b> <b>layer</b> and the vinyl chloride layer based on the wave motion principle. The arrival time of the reflection wave was calculated and confirmed by measurements. If measurement of piping under high temperature becomes possible, {{the effectiveness of the}} non-destructive testing technology by the laser ultrasonic technique can be expected, enabling the production of higher reliability and quality of multilayer piping...|$|R
50|$|The first {{widespread}} use of a composite armour {{appears to have been}} on the Soviet T-64. It used an armour known as Combination K, which apparently is glass-reinforced plastic sandwiched between inner and outer <b>steel</b> <b>layers.</b> Through a mechanism called thixotropy, the resin changes to a fluid under constant pressure, allowing the armour to be moulded into curved shapes. Later models of the T-64, along with newer designs, used a boron carbide-filled resin aggregate for greatly improved protection. The Soviets also invested heavily in reactive armour, which allowed them some ability to control quality, even after production.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{the arrival}} of the British 105 mm L7 gun and the US M68 variant of it, fitted to the Centurion and M60 tanks, forced the team to {{undertake}} another audacious première, with the adoption of composite armour. The recently created process was called [...] "K combination" [...] by Western armies: this protection consisted of an aluminium alloy layer between two high strength <b>steel</b> <b>layers.</b> As a consequence, the weight of the prototype rose eventually to 34 tonnes. But, as the engine was now a 700&thinsp;hp (515&thinsp;kW) 5TDF (also locally designed), its mobility remained excellent, far superior to the active T-62. The obyekt 432 was ready in September 1962 and production started in October 1963 in the Kharkiv plant. On 30 December 1966, it entered service as the T-64.|$|E
50|$|Hydraulic hose is graded by pressure, temperature, {{and fluid}} compatibility. Hoses are used when pipes or tubes {{can not be}} used, usually to provide {{flexibility}} for machine operation or maintenance. The hose is built up with rubber and <b>steel</b> <b>layers.</b> A rubber interior is surrounded by multiple layers of woven wire and rubber. The exterior is designed for abrasion resistance. The bend radius of hydraulic hose is carefully designed into the machine, since hose failures can be deadly, and violating the hose's minimum bend radius will cause failure. Hydraulic hoses generally have steel fittings swaged on the ends. The weakest part of the high pressure hose is the connection of the hose to the fitting. Another disadvantage of hoses is the shorter life of rubber which requires periodic replacement, usually at five to seven year intervals.|$|E

40|$|In {{inspecting}} steel-rubber multi-layered structure, shielding of <b>steel</b> <b>layer</b> {{and intense}} attenuation of rubber layer result in ultrasonic echo from the interfaces {{of the deep}} layers being very weak. In order to overcome the difficulty, the double mode testing method is put forward. This method synthesizes the characteristics of transverse wave and Lamb wave testing. In the double modetesting transverse wave and Lamb wave will be produced in <b>steel</b> <b>layer</b> at the same time.

50|$|Since {{the early}} sixties there were, in the US, {{extensive}} research programmes ongoing aimed at investigating {{the prospects of}} employing composite ceramic materials as vehicle armour. This research mainly focused {{on the use of}} an aluminium metal matrix composite reinforced by silicon carbide whiskers, to be produced in the form of large sheets. The reinforced light metal sheets were to be sandwiched between <b>steel</b> <b>layers.</b> This arrangement had the advantage of having a good multiple-hit capability and of being able to be curved, allowing the main armour to benefit from a sloped armour effect. However, this composite with a high metal content was primarily intended to increase the protection against KE-penetrators for a given armour weight; its performance against shaped charge attack was mediocre and would have to be improved by means of a laminate spaced armour effect, as researched by the Germans within the joint MBT-70 project.|$|E
5000|$|T-80 (Ob'yekt 219) (1976) - First {{production}} model. The T-80 {{has some}} features {{of both the}} T-64 and T-72, and other features unique to itself. In general, the offensive capabilities of the T-80 {{are similar to the}} T-64A, but it is faster thanks to the GTD-1000T 1,000 hp (746 kW) multi-fuel gas turbine engine. Visual keys are large, die-cast, irregularly spaced, ribbed, rubber-tired road wheels with three support rollers, a self-entrenching blade on the lower glacis, a Luna searchlight in the same position as the T-64. Significant differences are a coincidence rangefinder, and probable enhanced armor on the glacis (an upper glacis of <b>steel</b> <b>layers</b> enclosing fiberglass layers and a cast steel turret enclosing nonmetallic materials). Unlike the later models, the early T-80 had V-shaped splash plate on glacis plate. Due to its armour being obsolete, only a few hundred were built between 1976 and 1978 before the production switched to the T-80B. Some T-80s were later upgraded to B level.|$|E
40|$|The {{damping ratio}} of an added-story frame {{structure}} is established based on complex damping theory {{to determine the}} structure seismic response.

40|$|In the {{presented}} {{study the}} response of a carbon-glass composite/steel/(elastomer) multi-material structure to low-velocity impact was investigated experimentally. Two different <b>steel</b> <b>layer</b> thicknesses, 0. 125 mm and 0. 25 mm, {{as well as the}} addition of a rubber layer were assessed regarding their influence on internal and external damage, the absorbed energy, force evolution, and deformation. It was found that the doubling of the <b>steel</b> <b>layer</b> thickness stiffens the structure marginally and induces deeper indentations but has no significant influence on the absorbed energy or the damage threshold FD. The additional rubber layer increases the damage threshold load. Below this threshold, the response is dominated by global, elastic deformation decreasing internal and external damage and thereby the amount of absorbed energy. Above FDFD, large local deformations around the centre of impact lead to a more critical surface damage which dissipate a part of the energy decreasing the extend of delaminations...|$|R

40|$|Corrosion is a {{key issue}} for {{operators}} in {{the oil and gas}} industry since production fluids contain some water and both CO 2 and H 2 S acid gases. In this context, this paper illustrates the development of a reactive barrier polymer against corrosion by H 2 S of offshore flexible pipes. The role of this reactive material, called anti-H 2 S material, is to avoid H 2 S reaching the structural <b>steel</b> <b>layers</b> of the flexible pipe during the whole service life of the structure, usually 20  years, and hence to place the <b>steel</b> <b>layers</b> in a sweet service environment. Placed between the existing pressure sheath and the <b>steel</b> <b>layers,</b> the anti-H 2 S material has the ability to neutralize H 2 S during its diffusion within the material. The neutralization is ensured by an irreversible chemical reaction on reactive components that are dispersed in the material. The raw material selection is based on both accurate requirements for their use in a flexible pipe and expected performances in a sour service environment over a long period of time. Some laboratory qualifications and experimental techniques are used to qualify the behavior of the material and build the material database. A dedicated multiphysics model is developed based on the coupling of permeation mechanisms and gas-solid reactions. Qualification of both the material and the model is performed thanks to middle-scale and full-scale tests conducted in representative sour service conditions...|$|E

One of -typical composite structures for offshore application is multilayer unbonded composite pipe. The composite pipe comprised of several layers such as helically wound <b>steel</b> <b>layers</b> and polymeric layers, among which the helically wound steel wires play essential roles in providing axial and flexural stiffnesses of the pipe. Because of the -geometric nonlinearity of each {{layer of the}} composite pipe and the flexibility in motion of individual layers against their adjacent layers, analyses of the composite pipe are highly nonlinear and computationally challenging.

The better performance of the beams reinforced with welded wire mesh could be attributed to the material properties of the two types of steel meshes which resulted in higher tensile strength of the mortar-mesh composite for the case of welded wire mesh in comparison to that of the X 8 expanded steel mesh as explained in Eqs.

40|$|An Al/Stainless Steel/Al {{lamellar}} composite {{was produced}} by roll bonding of the starting sheets at 400 °C. Afterward, the roll bonded sheet was cut in half and the accumulative roll bonding (ARB) process at room temperature was applied seven times.

The tensile {{results showed that the}} roll bonded sheet has much higher strength and strength to weight ratio compared with the initial aluminum sheet {{as a result of the}} presence of continuous steel core. However, poor ductility properties were observed during tensile test, which were ascribed to the increasing deformation resistance and localized thinning of the central stainless steel sheet during the roll bonding process. The ARBed sample exhibited lower strength compared with the roll bonded sheet due to the breakup of stainless <b>steel</b> <b>layer</b> into many small segments. Anyway, an ultrafine grained microstructure with average grain size of 400 nm in the aluminum matrix and 71 % strain-induced martensite in the steel segments were detected by the electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) technique, which were found to be responsible for the enhancement of mechanical properties compared with the initial aluminum sheet...|$|R
