5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E

25|$|The ABC's {{television}} operations joined its {{radio and}} online divisions at the Corporation's Ultimo headquarters in 2000. The 2001 Centenary of Federation was celebrated across {{a number of}} outlets on 6 May. In the same year, digital television commenced {{after four years of}} preparation. In readiness, the ABC had fully digitised its production, post-production and transmission facilities - heralded at the time as 'the greatest advance in television technology since the introduction of colour'. The first programs to be produced in widescreen were drama series <b>Something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air,</b> Grass Roots and In the Mind of the Architect.|$|E

60|$|There must be <b>something</b> ghostly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> of Christmas--something {{about the}} close, muggy {{atmosphere}} that draws up the ghosts, like the dampness {{of the summer}} rains brings out the frogs and snails.|$|R
25|$|The heavy cost {{of these}} battles slowly {{exhausted}} Egypt's treasury {{and contributed to}} the gradual decline of the Egyptian Empire in Asia. The severity of these difficulties is stressed {{by the fact that the}} first known strike action in recorded history occurred during Year 29 of Ramesses III's reign, when the food rations for the Egypt's favoured and elite royal tomb-builders and artisans in the village of Deir el-Medina could not be provisioned. <b>Something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> prevented much sunlight from reaching the ground and also arrested global tree growth for almost two full decades until 1140 BC. One proposed cause is the Hekla 3 eruption in Iceland, but the dating of that event remains in dispute.|$|E
25|$|During the Second World War, Courtneidge devoted {{much time}} to {{entertaining}} the armed forces. In 1941, she presented a nightly three-hour show, raising funds, and then formed a small company which she took to Gibraltar, Malta, north Africa, and Italy, performing for the services and hospitals. She also toured in Hulbert Follies (1941), and Full Swing (1942), which she and Hulbert then brought to the Palace Theatre. Together with other prominent performers including Robert Donat and Florence Desmond, Courtneidge led professional opposition to a wartime proposal to allow theatres to open on Sundays. Instead, they proposed that only charity shows for the troops should be permitted on a Sunday. The Hulberts appeared together in another musical, <b>Something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> in 1943. The show received only moderate praise, although the performances of the two stars received good notices.|$|E
25|$|The heavy cost {{of these}} battles slowly {{exhausted}} Egypt's treasury {{and contributed to}} the gradual decline of the Egyptian Empire in Asia. The severity of these difficulties is stressed {{by the fact that the}} first known labour strike in recorded history occurred during Year 29 of Ramesses III's reign, when the food rations for the favoured and elite royal tomb-builders and artisans in the village of Set Maat her imenty Waset (now known as Deir el-Medina), could not be provisioned. <b>Something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> (possibly the Hekla 3 eruption) prevented much sunlight from reaching the ground and also arrested global tree growth for almost two full decades until 1140BC. The result in Egypt was a substantial increase in grain prices under the later reigns of Ramesses VI–VII, whereas the prices for fowl and slaves remained constant. Thus the cooldown affected Ramesses III's final years and impaired his ability to provide a constant supply of grain rations to the workmen of the Deir el-Medina community.|$|E
60|$|Andre-Louis {{began to}} {{apprehend}} {{that there was}} <b>something</b> sinister <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> He {{was a man of}} quick intuitions, quicker far than those of M. de Vilmorin, who evinced no more than a mild surprise.|$|R
60|$|Virginia {{gave him}} her hand limply. Her {{greeting}} would have frozen {{a man of}} ardent temperament. But it was not precisely ardor that Eliphalet showed. The girl paused and examined him swiftly. There was <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> man's <b>air</b> to-day.|$|R
6000|$|... "Any {{friend of}} my father’s is welcome to me, sir," [...] said the girl, coldly. She looked from the innkeeper to his odd-looking guest, and {{conscious}} of <b>something</b> strained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> gave him a little bow and quitted the room.|$|R

2500|$|With the {{exception}} of The Elephant Man and Dune, which are set in Victorian London and a fictitious galaxy respectively, all of Lynch's films have been set in the United States, and he has stated that [...] "I like certain things about America and it gives me ideas. When I go around and I see things, it sparks little stories, or little characters pop out, so it just feels right to me to, you know, make American films." [...] A number of his works, including Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks and Lost Highway are intentionally reminiscent of the 1950s American culture despite being set in the later decades of the 20th century. Lynch stated that [...] "It was a fantastic decade {{in a lot of}} ways... there was <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> that is not there any more at all. It was such a great feeling, and not just because I was a kid. It was a really hopeful time, and things were going up instead of going down. You got the feeling you could do anything. The future was bright. Little did we know we were for a disastrous future." ...|$|E
60|$|It was Benton's last night, {{and there}} was <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> menacing, terrible.|$|E
6000|$|Alice put {{her hand}} in his. [...] "I think I shall love it; I'm not afraid, Jake. There's <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> clear <b>air</b> and {{sunshine}} that makes one brave. Then it's virgin country; waiting {{for you and the}} others to make good use of." ...|$|R
60|$|Behind them sat {{the older}} children, {{some of them}} with rough, hard, sly faces. Some grinned rudely and nudged each other. The older girls sat with bated breath; they {{perceived}} <b>something</b> strange <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> Most of them had heard his sermon the night before.|$|R
6000|$|... "Take {{good care}} of him, Day, and beware of any men who may be prowling about," [...] {{answered}} Pawnee Brown. [...] "There is <b>something</b> wrong <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> but I'm satisfied that if we help this poor fellow we'll {{be on the right}} side of the brush." ...|$|R

6000|$|HECTOR [rising]. <b>Something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> of {{the house}} has upset you. It often does have that effect. [He goes to the garden door and calls Lady Utterword with {{commanding}} emphasis]. Ariadne! ...|$|E
6000|$|Father Brown {{was silent}} and {{motionless}} {{for half a}} minute, then he said: [...] "Superstition is irreligious, but there is <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> of this place. I think it's that Indian--at least, partly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{then you}} woke up? So did I. [...] . In {{a state of}} great bewilderment. Certainly there's <b>something</b> odd <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> I was--I was rushing along a road in a motor-car, very much excited and preoccupied. I got down----" [...] He held out a triumphant finger. [...] "Ironclads!" ...|$|R
60|$|Behind them sat {{the older}} children, {{some of them}} with rough, hard, sly faces. One or two grinned rudely and nudged each other.

6000|$|... "Been {{taking a}} walk?" [...] she said, pleasantly. There was <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> general <b>air</b> {{of this young}} woman which {{indicated}} {{that she should have}} worn a little apron with pockets, and that her hands should have been jauntily thrust into those pockets; but her dress included nothing of the sort.|$|R
60|$|But we didn't {{see very}} much of one another on that occasion. There was <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> between us that made a faint embarrassment; the mere fact, perhaps, that she {{had asked me to}} come up.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do enjoy it," [...] replied Prince Florestan, [...] "especially at Montfort Castle; I {{suppose there}} is <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> that agrees with one. But {{enjoyment}} of the present is consistent with objects for the future." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jackson was right," [...] {{the farmer}} said; [...] "there is <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> I {{can feel it}} rather than hear it. It {{is a sort of}} murmur no louder than a whisper. Do you hear it, Harold?" ...|$|E
60|$|A long night's {{sleep and}} {{a pot of}} delicious coffee for breakfast put so much {{sunshine}} into my world that I set out for Franklin Square with a gambler's countenance, resolute to conceal my dismay from my friends and especially from my publisher. There was <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> very <b>air</b> of Broadway which generated confidence.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, {{it is your}} fatherland, too, Aunt Mary! Is {{there not}} <b>something</b> inspiring <b>in</b> <b>the</b> very <b>air?</b> Come, Fred, can't you get up a little enthusiasm?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{remainder}} of the day passed quietly enough, although by <b>the</b> whispering <b>in</b> various tents {{it was easy to}} see that <b>something</b> unusual was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b>|$|R
60|$|The chamberlains {{who were}} used to carry the train put their hands near the floor {{as if they were}} lifting up the train; then they did as if they were holding <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> They would not have it noticed that they could see nothing.|$|E
60|$|Paul {{was just}} opening out from {{childhood}} into manhood. This atmosphere, where everything took a religious value, {{came with a}} subtle fascination to him. There was <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> His own mother was logical. Here there was something different, something he loved, something that at times he hated.|$|E
6000|$|... "London {{has changed}} since your last visit," [...] Lord Robert said, with a gentle smile. [...] "Believe me if I say--as your sincere well-wisher--that there is <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> at present {{positively}} unwholesome to you. I {{am not sure that}} unwholesome is not too weak a word." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is often}} <b>something</b> {{poisonous}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> of public rooms," [...] said Lydgate. [...] "Strong men can stand it, but it tells on people <b>in</b> proportion to <b>the</b> delicacy of their systems. It is often impossible {{to account for}} the precise moment of an attack--or rather, to say why the strength gives way at a particular moment." ...|$|R
60|$|Tallente smiled. There was <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fresh, cold <b>air</b> wonderfully {{alluring}} {{after the}} atmosphere of the room he had quitted. He turned his coat collar up and strode down the avenue.|$|R
60|$|And {{now for the}} clang of arms, the movement, the bustle, the {{excitement}} of combat! There are swords to polish, pistols to clean, cullivers to see to! <b>Something</b> is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air!</b> We have not been brought hither {{all the way to}} this God-forsaken and fog-ridden spot in order to stare on a tumble-down molens, or watch a solitary prisoner ere he hang.|$|R
