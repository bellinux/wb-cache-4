500|$|Degeneracy is the {{redundancy}} of {{the genetic}} code. This term was given by Bernfield and Nirenberg. The genetic code has redundancy but no ambiguity (see the codon tables below for the full correlation). For example, although codons GAA and GAG both specify glutamic acid (redundancy), neither specifies another amino acid (no ambiguity). The codons encoding one amino acid may differ in any of their three positions. For example, the amino acid leucine is specified by YUR or CUN (UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, or CUG) codons (difference in the first or third position indicated using IUPAC notation), while the amino acid serine is specified by UCN or AGY (UCA, UCG, UCC, UCU, AGU, or AGC) codons (difference in the first, second, or third position). [...] A practical consequence of redundancy is that errors in the third position of the triplet codon cause only a <b>silent</b> <b>mutation</b> or an error that would not affect the protein because the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity is maintained by equivalent substitution of amino acids; for example, a codon of NUN (where N = any nucleotide) tends to code for hydrophobic amino acids. NCN yields amino acid residues that are small in size and moderate in hydropathy; NAN encodes average size hydrophilic residues. The genetic code is so well-structured for hydropathy that a mathematical analysis (Singular Value Decomposition) of 12 variables (4 nucleotides x 3 positions) yields a remarkable correlation (C = 0.95) for predicting the hydropathy of the encoded amino acid directly from the triplet nucleotide sequence, without translation. [...] Note in the table, below, eight amino acids are not affected at all by mutations at the third position of the codon, whereas in the figure above, a mutation at the second position is likely to cause a radical change in the physicochemical properties of the encoded amino acid.|$|E
2500|$|Silent {{mutations}} are mutations that do {{not result}} in a change to the amino acid sequence of a protein but do change the nucleotide sequence, unless the changed amino acid is sufficiently similar to the original. [...] They may occur {{in a region that}} does not code for a protein, or they may occur within a codon in a manner that does not alter the final amino acid sequence. Silent mutations are also called silent substitutions, since they are not palpable changes as the changes in phenotype. [...] The phrase <b>silent</b> <b>mutation</b> is often used interchangeably with the phrase synonymous mutation; however, synonymous mutations are a subcategory of the former, occurring only within exons (and necessarily exactly preserving the amino acid sequence of the protein). Synonymous mutations occur due to the degenerate nature of the genetic code. There can also be silent mutations in nucleotides outside of the coding regions, such as the introns, because the exact nucleotide sequence is not as crucial {{as it is in the}} coding regions.|$|E

50|$|Conversely, <b>silent</b> <b>{{mutations}}</b> are {{mutations in}} which the amino acid sequence is not altered. <b>Silent</b> <b>mutations</b> lead to a change {{of one of the}} letters in the triplet code that represents a codon, but despite the single base change, the amino acid that is coded for remains unchanged or similar in biochemical properties. This is permitted by the degeneracy of the genetic code.|$|R
50|$|Because <b>silent</b> <b>mutations</b> do {{not alter}} protein {{function}} {{they are often}} treated {{as though they are}} evolutionarily neutral. Many organisms are known to exhibit codon usage biases, suggesting that there is selection for the use of particular codons due to the need for translational stability.

50|$|If {{the level}} 0 modules {{contains}} any unwanted restriction site, {{they can be}} mutated in silico by removing one nucleotide from the type IIS restriction site.

5000|$|Silent mutations: Code for {{the same}} amino acid (a [...] "synonymous substitution"). A <b>silent</b> <b>mutation</b> {{has no effect on}} the {{functioning}} of the protein.

5000|$|The McDonald-Kreitman test is a {{statistical}} test often used by evolution and population biologists {{to detect and}} measure the amount of adaptive evolution within a species by determining whether adaptive evolution has occurred, {{and the proportion of}} substitutions that resulted from positive selection (also known as directional selection). To do this, the McDonald-Kreitman test compares the amount of variation within a species (polymorphism) to the divergence between species (substitutions) at two types of sites, neutral and nonneutral. A substitution refers to a nucleotide that is fixed within one species, but a different nucleotide is fixed within a second species at the same base pair of homologous DNA sequences. A site is nonneutral if it is either advantageous or deleterious. The two types of sites can be either synonymous or nonsynonymous within a protein-coding region. In a protein-coding sequence of DNA, a site is synonymous if a point mutation at that site would not change the amino acid, also known as a <b>silent</b> <b>mutation.</b> Because the mutation did not result in a change in the amino acid that was originally coded for by the protein-coding sequence, the phenotype, or the observable trait, of the organism is generally unchanged by the <b>silent</b> <b>mutation.</b> A site in a protein-coding sequence of DNA is nonsynonymous if a point mutation at that site results in a change in the amino acid, resulting in a change in the organism's phenotype. Typically, silent mutations in protein-coding regions are used as the [...] "control" [...] in the McDonald-Kreitman test.|$|E
5000|$|Not all {{missense}} mutations lead to appreciable protein changes. An {{amino acid}} may {{be replaced by}} an amino acid of very similar chemical properties, in which case, the protein may still function normally; this is termed a neutral, [...] "quiet", [...] "silent" [...] or conservative mutation. Alternatively, the amino acid substitution could occur in a region of the protein which does not significantly affect the protein secondary structure or function. When an amino acid may be encoded {{by more than one}} codon (so-called [...] "degenerate coding") a mutation in a codon may not produce any change in translation; this would be a <b>silent</b> <b>mutation</b> (a type of synonymous substitution, which is not always silent) and not a missense mutation.|$|E
5000|$|... synonymous substitutions by {{definition}} do {{not result in}} a change of amino acid in the protein, but still can affect its function in other ways. An example would be a seemingly <b>silent</b> <b>mutation</b> in the multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1), which codes for a cellular membrane pump that expels drugs from the cell, can slow down translation and allow the peptide chain to fold into an unusual conformation, causing the mutant pump to be less functional (in MDR1 protein e.g. C1236T polymorphism changes a GGC codon to GGT at amino acid position 412 of the polypeptide (both encode glycine) and the C3435T polymorphism changes ATC to ATT at position 1145 (both encode isoleucine)).|$|E
50|$|Computational {{methods were}} used to {{identify}} 238 candidate ESEs.

40|$|A {{panel of}} nine {{neutralizing}} monoclonal ntibodies {{was used to}} analyse the antigenic properties of 188 plaque-purified type 3 poliovirus strains from 17 faecal specimens, derived from eight people during a 2 month observation period. Most poliovirus pecimens consist-ed of a mixture of antigenically distinct variants and he composition of the mixture was found to change between sequential specimens in many individuals, indicating antigenic evolution. Thirty-five strains re-presenting different a igenic patterns were selected for partial sequencing of genomic RNA.

The frequency of <b>silent</b> <b>mutations</b> was used to estimate the evolutionary potential of the virus. The largest difference in silent changes between strains isolated from one person was 0. 8 %, which corresponds to a minimum of about 60 mutations per genome within a period of 3 weeks.

50|$|There is a {{different}} tRNA molecule for each codon. For example, there is a specific tRNA molecule for the codon UCU and another specific for the codon UCC, both of which code for the amino acid serine. In this instance, {{if there was a}} thousand times less UCC tRNA than UCU tRNA, then the incorporation of serine into a polypeptide chain would happen a thousand times more slowly when a mutation causes the codon to change from UCU to UCC. If amino acid transport to the ribosome is delayed, translation will be carried out at a much slower rate. This can result in lower expression of a particular gene containing that <b>silent</b> <b>mutation</b> if the mutation occurs within an exon. Additionally, if the ribosome has to wait too long to receive the amino acid, the ribosome could terminate translation prematurely.|$|E

5000|$|Silent {{mutations}} are {{mutations in}} DNA {{that do not}} significantly alter the phenotype of the organism in which they occur.

The phrase <b>silent</b> <b>mutation</b> is often used interchangeably with the phrase synonymous mutation; however, synonymous mutations only occur within exons, and are not always silent mutations. Synonymous mutations can affect transcription, splicing, mRNA transport, and translation, any of which could alter phenotype, rendering the synonymous mutation non-silent. The substrate specificity of the tRNA to the rare codon can affect the timing of translation, and in turn the co-translational folding of the protein. This {{is reflected in the}} codon usage bias that is observed in many species. Mutations that cause the altered codon to produce an amino acid with similar functionality (e.g. a mutation producing leucine instead of isoleucine) are often classified as silent; if the properties of the amino acid are conserved, this mutation does not usually significantly affect protein function.|$|E

First, the use of an E. coli strain that is MMR deficient will eradicate this issue. However, this also results in a higher rate of other random mutations throughout the genome. Another method to reduce mismatch repair is to bury the mutations of interest within other <b>silent</b> <b>mutations.</b> Since <b>silent</b> <b>mutations</b> do not often cause catastrophic effects, they are poorly detected by the MMR machinery.
