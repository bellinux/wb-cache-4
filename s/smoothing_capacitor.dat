Thus if reservoir and <b>smoothing</b> <b>capacitors</b> of 2200 microfarads are used, a suitable minimum {{value for the}} inductor would be that which resonates 2200 microfarads (μF) to 10 Hz, i.e. 115 mH.

50|$|The control {{circuitry}} for active rectification usually uses comparators {{to sense the}} voltage of the input AC and open the transistors at the correct times to allow current to flow in the correct direction. The timing is very important, as a short circuit across the input power must be avoided and can easily be caused by one transistor turning on before another has turned off.

It arises mainly in power supplies (including switched-mode power supplies) after rectifying an AC voltage and flows as charge and discharge current through the decoupling or <b>smoothing</b> <b>capacitor.</b> The [...] "rated ripple current" [...] shall not exceed a temperature rise of 3, 5 or 10nbsp&°C, depending on the capacitor type, at the specified maximum ambient temperature.|$|E
2500|$|While {{half-wave}} and {{full-wave rectification}} deliver unidirectional current, neither produces a constant voltage. There {{is a large}} AC ripple voltage component at the source frequency for a half-wave rectifier, and twice the source frequency for a full-wave rectifier. [...] Ripple voltage is usually specified peak-to-peak. Producing steady DC from a rectified AC supply requires a smoothing circuit or filter. In its simplest form this can be just a capacitor (also called a reservoir capacitor or <b>smoothing</b> <b>capacitor),</b> choke, resistor, zener diode & resistor, or voltage regulator placed at {{the output of the}} rectifier. [...] In practice, most smoothing filters utilize multiple components to efficiently reduce ripple voltage to a level tolerable by the circuit.|$|E
2500|$|For a given load, sizing of a <b>smoothing</b> <b>capacitor</b> is a {{tradeoff}} between reducing ripple voltage and increasing ripple current. The peak current is {{set by the}} rate of rise of the supply voltage on the rising edge of the incoming sine-wave, reduced by {{the resistance of the}} transformer windings. [...] High ripple currents increase I2R losses (in the form of heat) in the capacitor, rectifier and transformer windings, and may exceed the ampacity of the components or VA rating of the transformer. [...] Vacuum tube rectifiers specify the maximum capacitance of the input capacitor, and SS diode rectifiers also have current limitations. [...] Capacitors for this application need low ESR, or ripple current may overheat them. [...] To limit ripple voltage to a specified value the required capacitor size is proportional to the load current and inversely proportional to the supply frequency and the number of output peaks of the rectifier per input cycle. Full-wave rectified output requires a smaller capacitor because it is double the frequency of half-wave rectified output. [...] To reduce ripple to a satisfactory limit with just a single capacitor would often require a capacitor that's infeasibly large.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Subsea {{power cables}} are a {{critical}} component of a voltage-source converter–high-voltage direct current (VSC–HVDC) transmission system in any offshore electrical power scheme. Subsea cables have complicated structures con-sisting of many different layers: conductor, insulation, sheath, and armor. Harmonic performance of the system depends upon the interactions between the subsea cable, the power converters, and other system components, such as <b>smoothing</b> <b>capacitors.</b> In this paper, a mathematical model of an HVDC-VSC transmission system is developed and its harmonic performance is investigated for steady-state operating conditions. The results suggest that the design of the subsea transmission cable has important effects on harmonic levels in the voltage and current waveforms in the cable and upon power loss within the transmission system. This paper demonstrates that it is always important to consider interactions between all of the system components when predicting harmonic performance in a VSC-HVDC transmission system.

The work that {{has been carried out}} includes laboratory testing of a permanent magnet linear generator, wave energy converter mechanical design and offshore testing, and finally design, implementation, and offshore testing of an underwater collector substation. Long-term testing of a single point absorber, which was installed in March 2006, has been performed in real ocean waves in linear and in non-linear damping mode. The two different damping modes were realized by, first, a resistive load, and second, a rectifier with voltage <b>smoothing</b> <b>capacitors</b> and a resistive load in the DC-link. The loads are placed on land about 2 km east of the Lysekil wave energy research site, where the offshore experiments have been conducted. In the spring of 2009, another two wave energy converter prototypes were installed. Records of array operation were taken with two and three devices in the array. With two units, non-linear damping was used, and with three units, linear damping was employed. The point absorbers in the array are connected to the underwater substation, which is based on a 3 m 3 pressure vessel standing on the seabed. In the substation, rectification of the frequency and amplitude modulated voltages from the linear generators is made. The DC voltage is smoothened by capacitors and inverted to 50 Hz electrical frequency, transformed and finally transmitted to the on-shore measuring station. Results show that the absorption is heavily dependent on the damping. It has also been shown that by increasing the damping, the standard deviation of electrical power can be reduced. The standard deviation of electrical power is reduced by array operation compared to single unit operation. Ongoing and future work include the construction and installation of a second underwater substation, which will connect the first substation and seven new WECs...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{the master}} thesis is to design, {{dimension}} and construct a power boost system for the drive trains in electric vehicles, utilizing supercapacitor technology. In order to build the system a supercapacitor bank and a converter has been constructed. The system {{has been designed to}} be used in the new Think electric vehicle, and each part of the converter has been dimensioned according to information provided by Think Technology. The master thesis is limited to the design and construction of the power boost system, and the implementation, interfacing and control of power sharing have not been dealt with. The supercapacitor bank and the converter are built based on analytical computations and simulations. The supercapacitor bank can store up to 100 Wh and is built from 90 series connected cells rated 1500 F each. The bidirectional DC 9 ̆ 6 DC converter is based on a standard intelligent power module with three legs in a bridge configuration and three inductors. An interleaved switching sequence is selected for the operation of the legs and each IGBT is capable of switching 150 A at 600 V. The thermal management of this module is solved with the use of a heat sink with fans for forced air flow. The inductors are made from amorphous alloys and copper foil, achieving an inductance of 0. 25 mH and a maximum current rating of 100 A. Voltage <b>smoothing</b> <b>capacitors</b> and measuring devices have also been implemented in the converter design. The results presented are held to be accurate, all though measurements gathered are affected to a certain degree by noise in the system.

Some tests are yet to be completed in order to make sure that the system works in continuous operation. Further work based on this master thesis should include more extensive testing on the system, and perform an optimization of the supercapacitor bank and the inductors. The intelligence for optimized load sharing must be created, and a communication interface with the power control unit in the Think electric vehicle must be made...|$|R

50|$|The {{idealized}} waveforms {{shown above}} are seen for both {{voltage and current}} when the load on the bridge is resistive. When the load includes a <b>smoothing</b> <b>capacitor,</b> both the voltage and the current waveforms will be greatly changed. While the voltage is smoothed, as described above, current will flow through the bridge only during {{the time when the}} input voltage is greater than the capacitor voltage. For example, if the load draws an average current of n Amps, and the diodes conduct for 10% of the time, the average diode current during conduction must be 10n Amps. This non-sinusoidal current leads to harmonic distortion and a poor power factor in the AC supply.|$|E
50|$|The {{function}} of this capacitor, {{known as a}} reservoir capacitor (or <b>smoothing</b> <b>capacitor)</b> is to lessen the variation in (or 'smooth') the rectified AC output voltage waveform from the bridge. There is still some variation, known as ripple. One explanation of 'smoothing' is that the capacitor provides {{a low impedance path}} to the AC component of the output, reducing the AC voltage across, and AC current through, the resistive load. In less technical terms, any drop in the output voltage and current of the bridge tends to be cancelled by loss of charge in the capacitor. This charge flows out as additional current through the load. Thus the change of load current and voltage is reduced relative to what would occur without the capacitor. Increases of voltage correspondingly store excess charge in the capacitor, thus moderating the change in output voltage / current.|$|E
5000|$|The {{simplest}} {{scenario in}} AC to DC conversion is a rectifier without any smoothing circuitry at all. The ripple voltage is very large in this situation; the peak-to-peak ripple voltage {{is equal to}} the peak AC voltage. A more common arrangement is to allow the rectifier to work into a large <b>smoothing</b> <b>capacitor</b> which acts as a reservoir. After a peak in output voltage the capacitor (C) supplies the current to the load (R) and continues to do so until the capacitor voltage has fallen to the value of the now rising next half-cycle of rectified voltage. At that point the rectifiers turn on again and deliver current to the reservoir until peak voltage is again reached. If the time constant, CR, is large in comparison to the period of the AC waveform, then a reasonably accurate approximation can be made by assuming that the capacitor voltage falls linearly. A further useful assumption can be made if the ripple is small compared to the DC voltage. In this case the phase angle through which the rectifiers conduct will be small and it can be assumed that the capacitor is discharging all the way from one peak to the next with little loss of accuracy.With the above assumptions the peak-to-peak ripple voltage can be calculated as: ...|$|E
