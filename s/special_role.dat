5|$|Agagianian {{sat on the}} Board of Presidency of the Second Vatican Council (Vatican II), {{which took}} place from 1962 to 1965. He was {{appointed}} by Pope Paul VI {{as one of the}} four moderators who directed the course of the debates, along with Leo Joseph Suenens, Julius Döpfner, and Giacomo Lercaro. Agagianian {{was the only one of}} these four from the Curia, and represented the Eastern Catholic Churches. He had a <b>special</b> <b>role</b> in the preparation of the missionary decree Ad gentes and Gaudium et spes, the Constitution on the Church in the Modern World.|$|E
5|$|Mongolian has vowel {{harmony and}} a complex syllabic {{structure}} for a Mongolic language that allows clusters {{of up to}} three consonants syllable-finally. It is a typical agglutinative language that relies on suffix chains in the verbal and nominal domains. While there is a basic word order, subject–object–predicate, ordering among noun phrases is relatively free, so grammatical roles are indicated by a system of about eight grammatical cases. There are five voices. Verbs are marked for voice, aspect, tense, and epistemic modality/evidentiality. In sentence linking, a <b>special</b> <b>role</b> is played by converbs.|$|E

5|$|On {{returning}} to Normandy {{for the last}} time in 1148, Matilda ceased to use the title Lady of the English, simply styling herself as empress again; she never adopted the title of Countess of Anjou. Matilda's household became smaller, and often merged with Henry's own court when the two were co-located in Rouen. She continued to play a <b>special</b> <b>role</b> in the government of the area around Argentan, where she held feudal rights from the grants made {{at the time of her}} second marriage.|$|E
5|$|The {{church has}} {{maintained}} its <b>special</b> <b>role</b> in the city's religious, civic and musical {{life as well}} as its close associations with the city's legal and medical professions through its proximity to the law courts and Sydney Hospital. Its original ministry was to the convict population of Sydney and it has continued to serve the city's poor and needy in succeeding centuries.|$|E
5|$|In future manned interplanetary spacecraft, 10B has a {{theoretical}} role as structural material (as boron fibers or BN nanotube material) which would also serve a <b>special</b> <b>role</b> in the radiation shield. One {{of the difficulties}} in dealing with cosmic rays, which are mostly high energy protons, is that some secondary radiation from interaction of cosmic rays and spacecraft materials is high energy spallation neutrons. Such neutrons can be moderated by materials high in light elements such as polyethylene, but the moderated neutrons {{continue to be a}} radiation hazard unless actively absorbed in the shielding. Among light elements that absorb thermal neutrons, 6Li and 10B appear as potential spacecraft structural materials which serve both for mechanical reinforcement and radiation protection.|$|E

5|$|Perforator veins {{play a very}} <b>special</b> <b>role</b> in the venous system, {{carrying}} {{blood from}} superficial to deep veins. During the muscular systole their valves close and stop any blood flow coming from the deep to the superficial veins. When their valves become insufficient, {{they are responsible for}} a rapid deterioration in existing varicose disease and for the development of venous ulcers. Detection of insufficient perforators is important because they need to be ligatured. However, the detection of competent ones is as important because they may be used strategically in new techniques of conservative surgery, for example a minimally invasive CHIVA. The ultrasonography report will include insufficient and continent perforators, which will also be shown on venous mapping. To test these veins properly, the examiner will need to use some techniques like the Paraná maneuver, toe and foot flexion, and hyper-extension on tip toes.|$|E
5|$|The QF 25-pounder Short {{received}} a mixed reception from gunners, and was particularly unpopular {{among members of}} AIF artillery units which had used the standard 25-pounder during the fighting in the Middle East. Guns were sometimes put out of action by damage caused by the absorption of violent recoil. The gun also {{had a tendency to}} tilt at low elevation; this was remedied by its crew standing on the trails, an expedient that had previously been used with the QF 4.5 inch Howitzer. Other limitations included a low rate of fire (three or four rounds per minute) and difficulties towing the weapon. Concerns were also raised over the quality of workmanship, and the commander of the 2/4th Field Regiment rejected a batch of Short 25-pounders sent to his unit before the Nadzab operation in the belief that they had been poorly manufactured. Inspectors subsequently concluded that most of his criticisms were unfounded, however. The most important deficiency compared to the regular 25-pounder was the shorter range. As a result of its experience with the gun, the 9th Division recommended that they be pooled and reserved for their <b>special</b> <b>role</b> rather than be employed in a day-to-day role alongside the regular 25 pounder.|$|E
5|$|The {{requirements}} for the priesthood differed over time and among the cults of different gods. Although detailed theological knowledge was involved in priestly offices, {{little is known about}} what knowledge or training may have been required of the officeholders. Priests were required to observe strict standards of ritual purity in the sacred space. They shaved their heads and bodies, washed several times a day, and wore only clean linen clothing. They were not required to be celibate, but sexual intercourse rendered them unclean until they underwent further purification. The cults of specific gods might impose further restrictions related to that god's mythology, such as rules against eating the meat of an animal that represented the god. The acceptance of women into the priesthood was variable. In the Old Kingdom many women served as priests, but their presence in clergies declined drastically in the Middle Kingdom before increasing in the Third Intermediate Period. Lesser positions, such as that of musician in ceremonies, remained open to women in even the most restrictive periods, as did the <b>special</b> <b>role</b> of ceremonial consort of the god. This latter role was highly influential, and {{the most important of these}} consorts, the God's Wife of Amun, even supplanted the High Priest of Amun during the Late Period.|$|E
