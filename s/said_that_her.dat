5|$|Details of Carol's death were {{revealed}} in the post mortem. There were severe injuries to the skull, and it was <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> face had been smashed by multiple blows. It was later found in court that the murder weapon had been an ice axe. The body {{was found to be}} in a foetal position, which suggested that the body had been dealt with within a few hours of death, before rigor mortis could settle in. It has since been said that the investigators failed to acknowledge that rigor mortis passes in a 24‑to48‑hour time period, and that the body could feasibly have been trussed once rigor mortis had passed. Many unusual knots were used to tie the body, and the same knots were said to be used in Gordon Park's house and boat. This was one of the key pieces of evidence used against Gordon in the trial.|$|E
