40|$|While shared stocks {{create some}} {{commonality}} of interests among states, they also present a {{potential source of}} tension, particularly when jurisdictional problems and resource access issues are present. Due to their mobility throughout the various maritime spaces, <b>shared</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> pose special management and conservation problems. [...] Lack of cooperation among relevant states and blatant disregard of the rights and duties of coastal states by distant water fishing (DWF) states {{have resulted in the}} uncontrollable harvesting of the resource and the cause of the many fisheries conflicts on the high seas. Canada's 1995 confrontation with Spain, which is now known as the 'turbot war' incident, is but one in the long history of high seas conflicts among sovereign states over <b>shared</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stocks.</b> Although the incident was the worst diplomatic dispute in the history of Canada-EU relationship, the action was necessitated by Canada's need to raise international awareness to the growing problems of managing <b>shared</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stocks.</b> [...] This paper sets out to examine the effectiveness of the current international legal regime for the conservation and management of shared fishery stocks on the high seas beyond national jurisdictions. It provides the reader with an overview of the evolution of the international legal fisheries regime, and using Canada's experience as the backdrop to the discussion, evaluates the regime's effectiveness in enforcing international conservation measures against illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing vessels on the high seas...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the impact of the advance of property rights in fisheries upon the management of internationally shared fishery resources. The management of these shared fishery resources did, in fact, come to prominence because of a revolutionary advance in state property rights to fishery resources through the advent of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) regime. The revolution in state property rights to fishery resources is not yet complete, however. The incompleteness of the revolution, it is argued, creates serious difficulties for the effective management for an important class of shared fishery resources, namely straddling and highly migratory <b>fish</b> <b>stocks.</b> The paper then discusses the impact, actual and potential, of the development of private property rights in fisheries upon the management of these resources. The discussion is speculative, however, and can be no more than that until there has been further advances in the game theoretic analysis of <b>shared</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stock</b> management. <b>Shared</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stocks,</b> game theory, property rights, regional fisheries management organizations, Environmental Economics and Policy, International Relations/Trade, F 53, Q 22,...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the end of}} the 20 th century, many <b>shared</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> {{throughout}} the world have been found in extreme danger of collapse. There are many calls for cooperation in utilizing and conserving the <b>shared</b> <b>fish</b> resources including the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 1995 UN <b>Fish</b> <b>Stock</b> Agreement. This study provides an important rationale for cooperation in utilizing a <b>shared</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stock</b> with several interested parties. The rationale is that an increase in the cooperation level leads to an increase not only in the steady-state <b>fish</b> <b>stock,</b> but also in total rent of the fishery. Moreover, the possibilities for cooperation in utilizing shared fisheries are examined. Some measures are also proposed to improve the cooperation level. According to this study, the prospects of cooperation in utilizing a straddling <b>fish</b> <b>stock</b> are not unlikely if a Regional Fishery Management Organisation (RFMO) forms with a leading role in a Stackelberg game or with an endogenous minimum participation level in a Cournot game. However, if the cost of enforcing RFMO members’ compliance with the terms of the agreement is high enough, there may not be any incentive for fishing countries to establish an RFMO for managing a straddling <b>fish</b> <b>stock.</b> This {{is one of the reasons}} for pervasive over-fishing around the world.

40|$|National {{jurisdiction}} over the fishery resources within the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) {{can be seen as}} an opportunity to overcome the problem of open access within the EEZs, but not on the high seas. Traditionally, it has been everybody's right to exploit the resources there. This right is now possibly under threat, cf. the UN <b>Fish</b> <b>Stocks</b> Agreement; however, it is still very much a juridical twilight zone. On the high seas, to some degree at least, open access is still the rule rather than the exception. Moreover, agreements between nations have to be based on voluntary cooperation, because there is no mechanism forcing nations to agree to something that would not be in their own interests. Therefore, this work is to a large degree about the possibility of overcoming the problem of open access through voluntary agreements. The questions analysed in the thesis covers several topics relevant to the fisheries economics literature. First, exploitation of internationally <b>shared</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> is considered under different assumptions about the regulatory regime, coalition formation, climatic conditions etc. In this part of the thesis, bioeconomic modelling and game theory are fundamental tools. Second, the production structure and capacity utilisation in a segment of a fishing fleet is analysed by means of duality theory and econometric methods. The span in topics and methods are perhaps large, but the topics have at least one important common feature; they are all related to the management of internationally <b>shared</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> and the consequences of strategic behaviour. The aim of the thesis is thus to contribute {{to the understanding of the}} economic management of shared fishery resources...|$|R
40|$|How do states {{allocate}} joint <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> that straddle international boundaries? What factors {{determine who}} gets what during international negotiations between fishing states? These questions {{strike at the}} heart of the literature on international cooperation, and thus answering them will shed light not simply on international and transboundary fisheries management but also on the general challenges of international cooperation. This paper examines how domestic groups influence negotiators and thus the ultimate terms of international agreements. The research focuses on seven agreements spanning 20 years (signed by Norway and Iceland) for managing four <b>shared</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> that straddle national and international waters. The main conclusion suggests that a state with a powerful domestic interest group usually gets a more favorable agreement when negotiating with a state with weaker domestic interest groups.

We construct a bioeconomic model, including the high seas and exclusive economic zones in order to study the incentives to form stable fully or partially cooperative agreements. We show that the spatial allocation of property rights is crucial for the success of cooperation as long as technical excludability is sufficiently high.

The fact that ASEAN countries bordering these waters are highly depended upon marine fisheries as the main source of revenue, employment, and food security, it is crucial for them to address these fisheries problems. This is especially the case with respect to the management and conservation of commercially important <b>shared</b> pelagic <b>fish</b> stacks, particularly in the South China Sea and Celebes Sea As the spatial migratory range of these stock transcends across many politically draw maritime zones of littoral States, it is highly impossible for one State, acting independently, would be able to manage these fisheries effectively within its own national jurisdiction Perhaps the best approach in dealing with this problem is through collective management and conservation of <b>fish</b> <b>stocks.</b> Hence, this paper examines interstate cooperative arrangement for the management of shared fishery stocks among ASEAN countries.

The exploitation of the cod stock in the Baltic Sea serves as an illustrative ex-ample.

The main findings of this paper is that, when ex-ternalities are present, a decrease in the resource rent implies that the threat for not free riding become less serious and thereby leave less room for stable solu-tion. Generally speaking, this implies that climatic changes with a negative ef-fect on the resource rent make joint solutions less likely.

The results show that accounting for non-consumptive values helps conserve the <b>fish</b> <b>stock</b> in that equilibrium fishing efforts are smaller and <b>fish</b> <b>stock</b> larger than without non-consumptive values under all possible coalition scenarios (full, partial and no cooperation). However, considering non-consumptive values {{does not affect the}} outcome of the game in terms of the prospects for cooperation: even with substantial non-consumptive benefits, the outcome is full non-cooperation. Hence, the trap of non-cooperation in international fisheries management cannot be overcome simply by explicitly accounting for non-consumptive values within IFAs. It is suggested that strengthening the role of IFAs and limiting the ability of non-member countries to free-ride be further investigated as measures fostering cooperation...|$|R
40|$|Indonesia {{is one of}} the world's largest tuna {{producing}} countries, yet regulatory oversight {{remains weak}} and management is poor. Incentive-based approaches are a way to improve state-based resource management, but they often require strong government regulation. In this paper, we use principal–agent theory and the notion of the ‘incentive gap’ to explore how incentives could be brought to bear in Indonesia through a combination of private and public actors. With a <b>shared</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stock</b> like tuna, we argue that a double principal–agent problem emerges, where information, asymmetries between various players complicate management. We focus on the problems of adverse selection and moral hazard in three different tuna fisheries in Indonesia to identify the nature of the incentive gap, and comment on the mix of public and private actors currently engaged in tuna fishery governance towards reducing the gap. The double principal–agent problem is a useful yet underutilized framework to understand the dynamics of shared stocks management. In this first application to a developing country fishery, we conclude that information asymmetries cannot be overcome without the involvement of private actors, who are increasingly becoming important in aligning regional and global objectives with those of fishers themselves...|$|R
40|$|Fishery {{management}} {{is a complicated}} task that often results in overfishing, overcapacity, and low profits for the industry. The management of <b>shared</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> is particularly problematic, especially if national authorities pursue different objectives. Multi-species fisheries add further complexity to the problem. It {{is no accident that}} management tools frequently used in Northern Europe, such as total allowable catches and individual quotas, are not applied in the Mediterranean Sea, where more target species are caught simultaneously. However, the European Commission intends to introduce a market-based driver for a strong, profitable fishing industry by phasing in transferable fishing concessions. This management approach is new for the Mediterranean, and it requires in-depth examination at institutional, legal, and economic levels. In this paper, after a review of the institutional setting, the economic perspective was analyzed by estimating the production function for the Italian small pelagic fishery in the Adriatic Sea. With the addition of Croatia to the European Union, the Adriatic Sea can become a Mediterranean communal exclusive fishing area. The results indicate that output measures such as total allowable catches and individual quotas should not cause serious discarding problems for this multi-species fishery...|$|R

40|$|<b>Shared</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> {{are such}} as migrate across borders between {{different}} countries’ exclusive economic zones. This paper discusses the incentive compatibility of fish-sharing agreements {{based on the}} zonal attachment of such stocks. Three types of migrations are considered: (i) a common stock that grows and reproduces and is then distributed in given proportions between two countries’ zones {{at the beginning of}} each fishing season; (ii) sub-stocks that breed and grow independently in their separate zones but spill over between zones according to relative abundance; (iii) a stock that grows and breeds in one country’s zone but migrates into the zone of another if it exceeds a certain size. It is shown that in all these cases the minor partner in a fish-sharing agreement may not have an incentive to cooperate unless he gets a larger share of the cooperative profits than corresponds to his share of the stock. This is particularly likely to happen when the unit cost of fish does not depend on the stock. An exception could occur if stock migration depends on the stock level; the major partner could then keep the entire <b>stock</b> by <b>fishing</b> it down to a critical level...|$|R

The road to ITQs in Norway has, however, been long and winding. The paper discusses the obstacles to ITQs in general and how they have played out in Norway in particular. Despite not being conservation tools, individual vessel quotas have been considered helpful in enforcing overall catch limits. The driving forces behind transferability are partly the capital gains quota holders can make, and partly the fleet rationalization that transferability generates. Main obstacles are controversies over initial allocation and ideological opposition against privatization and reliance on market forces. Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} model is developed to represent an idealized system of a <b>shared</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stock</b> associated with different exclusive economic zones. We apply such model on small pelagic fisheries shared between Southern Morocco, Mauritania and the Senegambia. The complete {{model is a}} set of six ordinary differential equations describing the time evolution of the fish biomass and the fishing effort in the three zones. The fish species targeted as small pelagics could be consid- ered to perform quick displacement between the different zones, in comparison to their growth and harvesting. We take advantage of the two time scales to obtain a reduced model governing the total fish biomass of the system and fishing efforts in each zone. We study existence and stability of equilibrium points of the reduced model. The simulations show {{that as a result of}} competition between fisheries per zone there can only be one winner in the general case. Nevertheless there is also an arising case that allows an operational management of shared fisheries by acting on the cost of fishing unit effort, indeed we found that a large number of equilibrium exist. From this last case the initial distribution of fishing effort strongly impact the optimal equilibrium that can be reached.

40|$|Conflict between {{recreational}} and commercial fishers resulting from competition for <b>shared</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> {{is a significant}} concern {{in the management of}} fisheries resources throughout Australia, with each sector calling for tighter restrictions on the activities of the other. In north Queensland, competition for a share of the barramundi resource is apparent through numerous media articles outlining opinions of both sectors. Opinions expressed in the media can influence decisions by managers and politicians who allocate and distribute access to fisheries resources, though usually it is not known whether such opinions are representative of the general fishing population. To address this uncertainty, a questionnaire program was implemented for recreational line fishers and commercial gillnet fishers. Questions focussed on fishers’ perceptions about competition and conflict between the sectors, their view and knowledge of their own and the competing sectors’ impacts, and their suggested solutions to competition. Results indicate that fishers from each sector holds negative opinions of the competing sector, and positive opinions of their own sector, perhaps indicating a likelihood for blame for negative outcomes, such as declines in catches. Negative opinions, however, appear to be based on perceptions that are not supported by scientific research, suggesting that correct information about fishing impacts of each sector is failing to reach the general fishing public. Solutions suggested by respondents include improving education and communication within and between sectors, or segregating the sectors via Recreational Only Fishing Areas (ROFAs). Overall, results suggest that current conflict between sectors may be eased through increased education and communication, highlighting the importance of social research into such situations...|$|R

Several high trophic level organisms (such as dolphins, benthopelagic cephalopods, large demersal fishes from the continental shelf, and other large pelagic fishes), and the herbivorous salema fish, were identified as keystone groups within the ecosystem. Results confirmed that fishing impact was high and widespread throughout the food web.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how non-binding cooperative agreements on fisheries management {{can be sustained}} when the management plans in participating countries are implemented imperfectly, and compares the effects of implementation uncertainty and of recruitment uncertainty on the potential for cooperation. The model developed assumes two countries that <b>share</b> a <b>fish</b> <b>stock.</b> Reproduction {{depends on how much}} fish each country leaves behind after harvesting and hence on random variation in each country’s achieved abandonment level. A self-enforcing agreement is proposed that accounts for the random variation. The agreement is illustrated with a numerical example. A self-enforcing cooperative solution can only be sustained when uncertainty is not pronounced and when the two countries control close to equal shares of the fishery. Even when a cooperative agreement can be achieved, frequent phases of reversion to non-cooperative harvest levels are needed to support the agreement. A comparison of the effects of recruitment and implementation uncertainty on implicit cooperation indicates that implementation uncertainty is more likely to hamper cooperation.

Although recreational and commercial fishing sectors are often in competition {{to the point of}} conflict with other users (including within their own sector), apparent conflict between recreational and commercial fishers is currently {{one of the most significant}} issues for fisheries management in Australia and many other countries (West and Gordon 1994; Brayford 1995; van Buerren et al. 1997; McPhee and Hundloe 2004; Arlinghaus 2005). Conflicts may be severe and expensive of management resources, regardless of whether they are “real” or only perceived (i. e. based on fishers’ beliefs but not substantiated) by one or more of the involved fishing sectors (Jacob and Schreyer 1980; Aas and Skurdal 1996). Many authors suggest conflict between recreational and commercial fishing sectors is increasing as contact between the sectors increases, particularly in coastal areas and close to population centres (Gartside 1986; Edwards 1991; Hannah and Smith 1993; Brayford 1995; Ramsay 1995; Scialabba 1998; O'Neill 2000; McPhee et al. 2002; Steffe et al. 2005 b). Increasing contact between the sectors may be due to a number of factors including: increased population; increased recreational fishing participation; and improved accessibility to previously remote fishing areas (Smith 1980; Henry 1984; Edwards 1990; van der Elst 1992; Hannah and Smith 1993; Green 1994; West and Gordon 1994; Kearney 2001, 2002 b; Williams 2002 a; Sumner 2003; Steffe et al. 2005 b). Although conflict can occur when commercial and recreational fishers target different species, the conflict situation is enhanced when the same species are targeted by both sectors (Arlinghaus 2005). In an attempt to reduce contact between competing sectors and hence reduce conflict, sector-specific closures are introduced in previously shared areas (Samples 1989; Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries 2003). Recreational Only Fishing Areas (ROFAs) (i. e. areas where commercial fishing is banned, leaving exclusive access to recreational fishers (anglers)) are becoming increasingly common in Australia and other developed countries (Owen 1981; Rogers and Gould 1995; Kearney 2002 b; McPhee et al. 2002; Walters 2003). All States and Territories in Australia have implemented ROFAs, particularly in coastal areas. For instance, in New South Wales (NSW) in May 2002, 30 areas along the coast became “Recreational Fishing Havens” (termed ROFAs here), where commercial fishing was either completely banned or significantly restricted. These ROFAs resulted in the closure of 24...|$|R
40|$|There {{currently}} is a breadth of literature outlining and justifying {{international best practices}} for regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs) to ensure that highly migratory and <b>shared</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> under their purview, such as tuna, are effectively conserved and managed. Most of this literature has noted the link between quality data and the formulation of scientific advice, which subsequently underpins {{the development and implementation}} of fishery conservation and management measures. However, the literature to date has not evaluated how tuna RFMOs can effectively balance the diverse capabilities of their members, including developing States, so that the best quality data can support scientific analyses on impacts of fishing. This thesis examines and analyses the implementation of international legal requirements, and application of international best practices, for fisheries data by a relatively young tuna RFMO: the Commission for the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory <b>Fish</b> <b>Stocks</b> in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPFC). The WCPFC was established following the adoption of the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 Relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling <b>Fish</b> <b>Stocks</b> and Highly Migratory <b>Fish</b> <b>Stocks</b> and is responsible for ensuring the long-term conservation and sustainable use of 50 % of current global principal market tuna catch. Approximately 20 % of global tuna resources are taken in the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of Pacific Islands States, and Pacific Island States therefore have a vested interest in ensuring that the best quality fisheries data underpins scientific advice. This thesis reviews the innovative and collective approaches established by Pacific Island States and their contribution towards WCPFC data practices. Also examined are the future implications of WCPFC data practices for Pacific Island States. 	 International law requires States to provide fisheries data to tuna RFMOs. Scientific analyses of impacts of fishing require fisheries data covering characteristics of tuna and the surrounding ecosystem, the catch and effort of the fisheries, the characteristics of the fisheries themselves and their response to fishing. Consistent with a sustainable and responsible approach to fisheries management, data should also cover species that are not targeted but may be impacted on by the fisheries, or that are dependent on or found in association with tunas. To ensure the best quality data can support scientific analyses on impacts of fishing, tuna RFMOs need: to establish: databases to compile these data; to establish integrated data verification schemes to check that data is complete and accurate; and arrangements to share fisheries data must include the requirement to maintain confidentiality. At the global level, data on tuna fisheries is compiled by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations and institutional arrangements have been established to cross-check with data compiled at the regional level by tuna RFMOs. 	 Pacific Island States have established practices to collect and <b>share</b> data on <b>fishing</b> activities in their EEZ, data needed to support stock assessment, vessel and gear information, and data on non-target species. These same data collection practices for Pacific Island States have formed the foundation of WCPFC data practices. The use of existing regional arrangements and standards has enabled the WCPFC to meet international legal requirements and to make significant progress towards achieving international recommended best practices for tuna RFMOs. However, there are gaps in the implementation of data requirements by WCPFC members, and progress can be made to further improve the quality of data, notably more complete coverage and improved accuracy. 	 This thesis concludes that if the WCPFC is to receive the best quality data, it is contingent on: first, coastal States, particularly Pacific Island States, continuing to take responsibility for leading the establishment and implementation of effective WCPFC data practices; second, the WCPFC establish a process to regularly assess WCPFC members data provision to the WCPFC; and third, the WCPFC continue progress to establish an integrated WCPFC verification scheme. Additionally, the Joint Tuna RFMO process could also be used to maintain pressure for the WCPFC to adopt best practice standards for tuna RFMOs. Ultimately, the achievement of long-term conservation and sustainable use of tuna fisheries in the western and central Pacific Ocean will depend on sufficient political will by all WCPFC members to heed scientific advice, and take effective conservation and management action in accordance with the precautionary approach...|$|R

40|$|Research PaperPresent {{resource}} rents in Norway's fisheries {{were compared}} for different fleet structures. Alternative values of TACs were assumed, {{which is consistent}} with how most fisheries in Norwegian waters are managed. Total allowable catches (TACs) are set on the basis of advice by fisheries biologists where the economics of the industry plays a minor role. The TAC is then shared between the nations <b>sharing</b> the <b>fish</b> <b>stocks,</b> according to agreed formulas. A model of the fisheries was implemented in GAMS. The basis for the model is fleet categorization used in the annual cost and earnings studies. Rents were maximized using an LP-approach, under various constraints regarding divisions of the total catches between different fleet categories. Currently the resource rent in Norway's fisheries is small and possibly even negative, depending on assumptions made with regard to capital costs and other uncertain factors. The potential rent is quite high and could be up to one half of the landed value, depending on constraints with regard to reallocation of fish catches between different categories of boats, and also on assumptions about capital costs and other uncertain factors. In some fisheries in Norway it is now permitted to trade in fish quotas through trading in fishing vessels. Vessels can be removed from the fishery and stripped of their quotas, which then are transferred to other vessels. As the fleet categories involved have undergone downsizing their profitability has increased and the value of the fish quotas has gone up. Data from the cost and earnings studies were used to estimate the value of fish quotas and to study whether they reflect resource rent in the fishery. Transaction value of these fish quotas in many cases seem to overestimate the resource rent in the fishery, probably due to excess capacity in the existing fleet...|$|R
