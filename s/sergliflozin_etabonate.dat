50|$|<b>Sergliflozin</b> <b>etabonate</b> (INN/USAN, codenamed GW869682X) is an investigational anti-diabetic drug being {{developed}} by GlaxoSmithKline. It did not undergo further development after phase II.|$|E
40|$|Inhibitors of sodium-dependent glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT 2) {{increase}} glucose excretion in {{the urine}} and improve blood glucose in Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Glycosuria provides an energy and osmotic drain that could alter body composition. We therefore conducted a pilot study comparing the effects on body composition of two SGLT 2 inhibitors, remogliflozin etabonate (RE) 250  mg TID (n =  9) and <b>sergliflozin</b> <b>etabonate</b> (SE) (1000  mg TID) (n =  9), with placebo (n =  12) in obese non-diabetic subjects. Both drugs were well tolerated during 8 weeks of dosing, and the most common adverse event was headache. No urinary tract infections were observed, {{but there was one}} case of vaginal candidiasis in the RE group. As expected, RE and SE increased urine glucose excretion, with no change in the placebo group. All the subjects lost weight over 8 weeks, irrespective of treatment assignment. There was a reduction in TBW measured by D 2 O dilution in the RE group that was significantly greater than placebo (1. 4  kg, p =  0. 029). This was corroborated by calculation of fat-free mass using a quantitative magnetic resonance technique. All but one subject had a measurable decrease in fat mass. There was significant between-subject variability of weight and fat loss, and no statistically significant differences were observed between groups. Despite a lack of a difference in weight and fat mass loss, the leptin/adiponectin ratio, a measure of insulin resistance, was significantly decreased in the RE group when compared to placebo and SE, suggesting that this SGTL- 2 inhibitor may improve metabolic health independent of a change in fat mass...|$|E
