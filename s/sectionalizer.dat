A <b>sectionalizer</b> is generally not rated to interrupt fault current and is therefore cheaper than a recloser. Each <b>sectionalizer</b> detects and counts fault current interruptions by the recloser (or circuit breaker). After a pre-determined number of interruptions, the <b>sectionalizer</b> will open, thereby isolating the faulty section of the circuit, allowing the recloser to restore supply to the other non-fault sections.|$|E

Autoreclosers sense and briefly interrupt fault currents, and then automatically reclose to restore service. Meanwhile, downstream sectionalizers automatically count current interruptions by the recloser. When a <b>sectionalizer</b> detects a preset number of interruptions of fault current (typically 3 or 4) the <b>sectionalizer</b> opens (while unenergized) and remains open, and the recloser restores supply to the other non-fault sections.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{placement}} of <b>sectionalizers,</b> as well as, a cross-connection is optimally determined so that the objective function is minimized. The objective function employed in this paper consists of two main parts, the switch cost and the reliability cost. The switch cost is composed {{of the cost of}} <b>sectionalizers</b> and cross-connection and the reliability cost is assumed to be proportional to a reliability index, SAIDI. To optimize the allocation of <b>sectionalizers</b> and cross-connection problem realistically, the cost related to each element is considered as discrete. In consequence of binary variables for the availability of <b>sectionalizers,</b> the problem is extremely discrete. Therefore, the probability of local minimum risk is high and a heuristic-based optimization method is needed. A Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (DPSO) is employed in this paper to deal with this discrete problem. Finally, a testing distribution system is used to validate the proposed method...|$|R

The traditional distribution protection system (recloser, <b>sectionalizers)</b> was configured to automatically isolate faulted circuits {{as well as to}} reenergize unfaulted loads after a certain number of reclosing operations. Internet Peer-to-Peer communication enables distribution relays to communicate with others connected to the communication network without having a master device. According to the results, the addition of peer-to-peer communication to a traditional distribution protection system significantly enhances its general performance eliminating undesired losses of unfaulted load.

40|$|Abstract: Power Distribution Networks {{have been}} {{operated}} {{in an easy}} and simple unidirectional way. Therefore, no automatism even remote control technology was applied to Ring Main Units or <b>Sectionalizer</b> close to the load in the distribution network. However, increase in load demand has led to instability in system which ultimately resulted into outages in power system. This paper presents the SIMULINK modeling of a control circuit of autorecloser {{which is one of}} the most important equipment in smart grid. The modeled control circuit is synchronized with circuit breaker in such a way that after occurrence of fault, breaker recloses automatically without any human interference. The other important aspect of smart grid is to make power system self sufficient. The importance of having Decentralized Generation at Medium voltage and Low voltage level is explained. Whenever transient fault occurs in the system at distribution level, autorecloser avoids outage for longer duration. However, if the fault is persistent then autorecloser isolates only affected part in system and avoids outage in other parts of system...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the research is to formulate and demonstrate protection schemes for radial and loop systems, an active distribution system, and a microgrid. The schemes are composed of a) A new loop scheme by utilizing voltage, current, and time (VIT) reclosers and <b>sectionalizers</b> and b) A new protection scheme, the dynamic state estimation-based protection, for active distribution systems and microgrids. The {{first part of the}} research explores the closing onto a fault during the conventional loop sectionalizing scheme and provides a VIT scheme that can solve the problem. The immediate benefit of the VIT schemes is a reduction of the nuisance trips because of the fault closing onto a fault. Moreover, the number of protection zones is increased by the application of the VIT <b>sectionalizers.</b> This thesis demonstrates the VIT protection scheme for a traditional distribution system and presents numerical experiments using various test scenarios with various fault locations. The simulation results verify that the protection scheme successfully performs the automatic load transfer scheme for a loop system. The second part of the research identifies the increased number of protection issues according to the installation of distributed generations (DGs) and provides solution to the problem. To solve the issue, a new fault detection scheme, dynamic state estimation-based protection scheme, is illustrated in this thesis based on synchronized measurements. The method uses dynamic state estimation, based on the dynamic model of the component that accurately reflects the nonlinear characteristics of the component. Numerical experiments show that the protection of active distribution systems and microgrids is feasible in real time. Ph. D...|$|R

The impact of distributed generation in a distribution network depends, among other aspects, {{on the design of}} the protection system and the coordination between the different protective devices. The presence of distributed generation changes the radial nature of distribution systems and affects the performance of the protection system. This document discusses the present protection practices for distribution systems and DG interties, describes the implementation of protective devices (circuit breakers, relays, reclosers, fuses, <b>sectionalizers)</b> in an EMTP-type tool, and presents some simulation results whose main goal is to analyze the impact of synchronous machine-based embedded generators on the coordination between the different types of protective devices...|$|R
40|$|The Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) have {{to ensure}} that {{electricity}} is supplied to customers according to voltage quality and power reliability requirements. The SAIDI (System Average Interruption Duration Index) is a performance index commonly used to measure reliability which expresses the average outage duration for each customer served. When an outage occurs on the distribution grid, remote controlled <b>sectionalizers</b> (RCS) are operated to enhance the restoration of power by sectionalizing the medium voltage (MV) grid before repairing the line. By analyzing data of outages, considering the frequency, the duration {{and the size of}} outages, statistical methods can be outlined to identify MV-lines where RCS investments may have significant improvements on reliability.

40|$|In this paper, {{the optimal}} {{allocation}} and sizing of distributed generators (DGs) in a distribution system is studied. To achieve this goal, an optimization problem should be solved {{in which the}} main objective is to minimize the DGs cost and to maximise the reliability simultaneously. The active power balance between loads and DGs during the isolation time {{is used as a}} constraint. Another point considered in this process is the load shedding. It means that if the summation of DGs active power in a zone, isolated by the <b>sectionalizers</b> because of a fault, is less than the total active power of loads located in that zone, the program start shedding the loads in one-by-one using the priority rule still the active power balance is satisfied. This assumption decreases the reliability index, SAIDI, compared with the case loads in a zone are shed when total DGs power is less than the total load power.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{penetration of}} Distributed Generation (DG) {{in the distribution}} grid that is nowadays taking place challenges the Network Operators to maintain the reliability indexes achieved in prior years. The contribution of the DG-units to the short-circuit currents can cause the mal-operation of devices that are not designed to operate under bi-directional current flows. However, in the isolated-neutral grounding system, in use {{in countries such as}} Spain, Finland, China or Japan, the bi-directional fault currents do not affect the performance of fault detection devices in case of phase-to-ground faults, the most common fault type. This is due to the high values of the capacitive, zero-sequence impedance with respect to the other sequence impedances. For this fault type, this earthing system is known as highly reliable because (i) the line-voltages remain unchanged during the fault and (ii) the fault currents are low (difficult to detect), with a high probability of becoming self-extinguishing faults. Because of this, the fault location is mostly based on a trial-and-error switching sequence, until the fault is isolated. This procedure is very time-consuming if performed with manually-operated switches and <b>sectionalizers.</b> Towards reducing the outage time, grid investment is required. One of the options is installing directional Fault Passage Indicators (FPI). This device is already 70 years old, and the technology has already proven to be a cost-effective solution to improve reliability in other grounding systems. Because of the particular features of the isolated-neutral system, directionality is required in any case, with or without DG. Implementing directionality in the conventional way requires installing voltage sensors and the devices are still susceptible to non-detection of high fault impedance faults. The main contributions of the thesis are three different methods to detect the direction in phase-to-ground faults in isolated-neutral grids. The first two methods are voltage sensor-less, whereas the third method is designed for small current fault detection, using zero-sequence voltage and current measurements. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Distribution grid {{reconfiguration}} {{is defined}} as altering the topological structure of distribution feeders by changing the open/closed states of <b>sectionalizers</b> and tie switches. The objectives achieved by grid reconfiguration typically are loss minimization, load balancing or improved grid reliability. The constraints include grid operation and safety limits. As the distributed energy resource (DER) penetration in a network increases, its variation will affect the power loss incurred by the network along with power quality issues like over voltage. This work addresses this power loss problem under normal operation of the distribution grid. Although grid reconfiguration achieves loss reduction in a distribution network, the switching operation involves cost. Hence, {{there has to be}} a balance between the number of switching done in a distribution network and the reduction in loss achieved due to switching. This PhD research uses the concept of grid reconfiguration to minimize power losses and ensure power quality while taking into account DER uncertainty and switching cost. This is achieved by proactively changing the configuration of the network, by taking into consideration the future variations in DERs, in determining the present optimal configuration of the network. In particular, this thesis discusses four major topics: factors affecting grid reconfiguration, methods to find the optimal configuration in the presence of DER uncertainty, methods to ensure robustness of the optimal configuration under DER uncertainty and a quantitative mapping between DER uncertainty indices and grid reconfiguration strategies. First, grid reconfiguration which is formulated as an optimization problem characterized by objectives and constraints is analyzed to identify the various factors that affect its benefits. It is found that the objectives, the constraints, the period of reconfiguration (PRC), the location of components of a network such as load and generation, the availability and location of switches etc. affect the benefits derived out of reconfiguring a network. Grid reconfiguration presents challenging issues due to the non-convex optimization needed because of non-convex objectives and integer constraints. It is conventionally considered a mixed-integer non-linear programming problem. This thesis uses genetic algorithm (GA) for solving single objective reconfiguration problems applied to small networks. Multi-objective reconfiguration problems on small networks are handled with the help of non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). For solving the optimization problem involved in reconfiguration of large networks, a deterministic approach based on mixed integer conic programming (MICP) is made use of. This takes advantage of the commercially available solvers and software tools in solving the optimization problem. Following the preliminary study to understand the factors affecting grid reconfiguration, the thesis focuses on identifying and accounting for the effect of photovoltaic (PV) uncertainty in the optimal configuration of the distribution grid. A heuristic method to find the optimal configuration for two days that differ only in their level of PV penetration is developed. Secondly, a scenario analysis based method is developed that helps to account for PV generation uncertainty in grid reconfiguration. Three reconfiguration methods namely Most probable scenario (MPS) method, conservative robust grid reconfiguration (CRGR) method and non-conservative robust grid reconfiguration (NCRGR) based on the concepts of scenario analysis and receding horizon control are developed to find the optimal configuration of the distribution network in the presence of DER uncertainty. Two of the developed methods resulted in robust configuration of the network, that is, the resulting configuration did not violate the constraints under any of the predicted DER variations. One of the developed methods resulted in a non-conservative robust configuration of the distribution network by taking into account the probabilities of all the possible DER variation scenarios. Finally, a general methodology to determine the PRC of a distribution network considering the uncertainty of DERs is developed. PRC is the periodicity at which the configuration of a distribution network is updated. The accuracy of forecast and the sensitivity of the network to the variation in predicted variable were identified as two key factors that influence the PRC. Using the developed methodology, the distribution system operator (DSO) can decide whether an hourly, daily, monthly, seasonal or yearly reconfiguration is to be done for a particular distribution network under a particular forecasting method adopted for predicting the variation of DERs. The following results and conclusions were derived out of the various sections mentioned above. The results show that benefits of grid reconfiguration are dependent on the characteristics of the network under consideration. The optimal configuration of two days that differ only in PV penetration level can be found by evaluating minimum loss reduction parameter. The scenario analysis based method helps in reducing the number of switches to be installed and operated in order to cater for the uncertainty in PV generation. The DSO can adopt MPS method of grid reconfiguration if the probability of the most probable scenario is very high and the probability of worst case scenario is negligible. This helps in extracting maximum benefits out of grid reconfiguration. For a network in which the worst case scenario is having a high probability the DSO can adopt CRGR method which ensures a robust and optimal configuration under the worst case scenario. For all other networks with various predicted DER scenarios and comparable probabilities of occurrence, the DSO can adopt the NCRGR method which guarantees robustness as well as nearly-optimal configuration under all scenarios. A closed loop implementation of the three methods can be adopted instead of the open loop implementation by the DSO if accuracy is paramount. In a network which is less sensitive to a change in the Distributed Generation (DG) output, the DSO can adopt a longer PRC. This low level of sensitivity can be due to the low DG penetration in the network or low value of the DG output. A shorter PRC has to be adopted by the DSO if the forecast is inaccurate or even in the presence of accurate forecast if the network is sensitive to a change in the DG output. In other words, this thesis helps the DSOs, by providing guidelines for adopting grid reconfiguration as an operation tool. To the network planners it helps in deciding the location of switches. This thesis also aims to further the state-of-the-art research in the field, by extending the limits and applications of grid reconfiguration. status: publishe...|$|R
