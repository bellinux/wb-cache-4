40|$|Introduction: Ewing's sarcoma is a rare, {{malignant}} tumour predominantly affecting young adolescent males. We describe a unique {{case of an}} isolated extra-skeletal metastasis from a skeletal Ewing's sarcoma primary, arising in the right <b>sinonasal</b> <b>cavity</b> {{of a young man}} who presented with severe epistaxis and periorbital cellulitis. Results: Histologically, the lesion comprised closely packed, slightly diffuse, atypical cells with round, hyperchromatic nuclei, scant cytoplasm and occasional mitotic figures, arranged in a sheet-like pattern. Immunohistochemical analysis showed positive staining only for cluster of differentiation 99 glycoprotein. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation identified the Ewing's sarcoma gene, confirming the diagnosis. Management: Complete surgical resection was achieved via a minimally invasive endoscopic transnasal approach; post-operative radiotherapy. Ten months post-operatively, there were no endoscopic or radiological signs of disease. Conclusion: Metastatic Ewing's sarcoma within the head and neck is incredibly rare and can pose significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. An awareness of different clinical presentations and distinct histopathological features is important to enable early diagnosis. This case illustrates one potential management strategy, and reinforces the evolving role of endoscopic transnasal approaches in managing <b>sinonasal</b> <b>cavity</b> and anterior skull base tumours. <br/...|$|E

The most common location of the tumor is pelvic retroperitoneum and musculoskeletal system of the lower extremities. It is rarely seen {{in the head and}} neck area. In addition, only 0. 8 % to 3 % of all orbital tumors and less than 5 % of primary sinonasal tumors are primary hemangiopericytoma, which demonstrates that the orbital and <b>sinonasal</b> <b>cavities</b> are rare locations for this tumor.

Excess risks were confirmed among men and women employed in the manufacture of footwear and other leather products and of wooden furniture. No risk significantly above expectancy was observed among wood workers outside the furniture making industry. Excess risks were also seen among men in all areas of basic metal industries (SPIR = 184 - 562) and in a subset of workers in industries producing metal containers (SPIR = 329 - 600). Most unexpected were raised risks among employees of both sexes in making cocoa, chocolate, and sugar confectionery (SPIR = 535 for men and 860 for women); these, in combination with the observed risks among female employees in canning and preserving fruits and vegetables (SPIR = 778) and in farming (SPIR = 735) may point to a common aetiology.

40|$|Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS) {{defines a}} group of upper airway {{disorders}} characterized by persistent inflammation of the <b>sinonasal</b> <b>cavities.</b> Depending {{on the presence of}} polyps on endoscopic examination, CRS can be further divided into 2 groups: CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) and CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). Typically, CRSwNP is closely related to eosinophilic and Th 2 -related inflammation while in CRSsNP neutrophils dominate the infiltrate. Secretory IgA (SIgA) represents a first-line mechanism of the airway immune defense, protecting the mucosal surfaces against inhaled microorganisms and antigens. Epithelial transcytosis of IgA is mediated by the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR), a transmembrane glycoprotein selectively expressed on the basolateral surface of epithelial cells which also serves as the precursor of secretory component (SC), a glycoprotein that enhances the immune functions of SIgA. One previous report indicated that Igs, including IgA, were increased in tissue homogenates from patients with CRSwNP (Van Zele, 2006). Our laboratory has identified in the bronchial epithelium of severe COPD decreases in pIgR and IgA expression (Pilette, 2001) and related these findings to airflow limitation and neutrophilic inflammation (Pilette, 2001, 2007). Based on this and on the role of IgA in mucosal host defense, as well as clinical evidence suggesting deficient first-line defense mechanisms, we hypothesized that secretory IgA production could be impaired in CRSsNP, considered as the upper airway counterpart of COPD...|$|R

Materials and Methods: Histopathologically diagnosed cases of ameloblastoma retrieved from past records of the Department of Oral Pathology were selected for the study. Totally, 148 cases were isolated from record of previous 7 years. The patients were divided according to (a) gender, (b) age group, (c) site of the lesion and (d) histopathological types. The findings of this study were compared with those available in literature. Statistical Analysis Used: This is a retrospective study, mean and standard deviation was calculated. Results: Among 148 patients, 88 (59. 45 %) were male and 60 (40. 55 %) were female. A maximum number of cases (101 of 148) of ameloblastoma were found in the second to fourth decades of life. Mandiblular posterior region was commonly involved (48. 6 %). Solid/multicystic variety was found in 63. 1 % followed by unicystic with 21. 5 %. We found one case each of extraosseous and desmoplastic ameloblastoma. It was difficult for panel of experienced oral pathologists to pinpoint the exact type in 15 (10 %) cases, this was due to mixture of follicular and plexiform variety with equal presence of both types of architecture, without predominance of any variety in particular.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare low- and standard-dose multidetector CT (MDCT) findings in patients with suspected chronic sinusitis. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Fifty patients underwent MDCT at 10 and 150 effective mAs. The low-dose MDCT protocol delivered a radiation dose of 0. 047 mSv in men and 0. 051 mSv in women, whereas the standard-dose MDCT protocol delivered a radiation dose of 0. 70 mSv in men and 0. 76 mSv in women. Scans of the right and left sides of <b>sinonasal</b> <b>cavities</b> were reviewed by three radiologists, with each physician reviewing a scan twice over an interval of more than 2 weeks. The reviewers were asked to evaluate the scans for eight mucosal and two bone abnormalities. We calculated the number of discrepancies in observed abnormalities between pairs of reviewers, among all three reviewers, and between findings on scans acquired with the two radiation doses. RESULTS: The mean number of discrepancies in observed abnormalities on scans acquired with different radiation doses ranged from 0 to 5. 2. Discrepancies between pairs of reviewers ranged from 1. 0 to 12. 8 for low-dose scans and from 1. 0 to 13. 0 for standard-dose scans. Discrepancies among all reviewers ranged from 1. 0 to 10. 3 for low-dose scans and from 1. 0 to 8. 7 for standard-dose scans. In analyzing cases of significant discrepancies in observations, we found greater variation between pairs of reviewers and among all three reviewers than between findings obtained with different dose levels. CONCLUSION: Dose reduction played a far less important role in discrepancies of detected abnormalities than did the human element of reviewer observation. Given this finding and the fact that low-dose MDCT delivers a radiation dose that is no higher than that delivered by a four-view radiographic examination, low-dose MDCT should be considered the imaging method of choice in patients with suspected chronic sinusitis.

Twenty of 29 (69. 0 %) patients cultured S. aureus postoperatively, of which 17 of 20 (85. 0 %) were screen-positive at surgery. Seven of 11 (63. 6 %) intraoperatively biofilm-positive but culture-negative patients progressed to culture S. aureus post-ESS. S. aureus culture was associated with selected poorer early post-ESS outcomes. S. aureus persists in the <b>sinonasal</b> <b>cavity</b> despite ESS. The postoperative culture of sinonasal S. aureus in patients previously biofilm-positive but culture-negative may reflect the dynamic ability of S. aureus to adapt to the surgically-altered microenvironment with subsequent biofilm dispersal and release of planktonic clones.

40|$|A 71 -year-old {{man with}} chronic rhinosinusitis {{presented}} with a purulent, foul-smelling nasal discharge and obstruction. One year earlier he had been treated with a dacryocystorhinostomy for nasolacrimal duct obstruction. During the procedure, bone wax {{had been used to}} control bleeding in the anterior upper nasal cavity. On computed tomographic imaging, a fat-density lesion was seen in the anterior upper <b>sinonasal</b> <b>cavity</b> and was found to be hypointense or signal-void on all magnetic resonance imaging sequences. The lesion, which proved to consist of bone wax, was surgically removed. Here, we present the imaging features of retained bone wax in a patient with clinically diagnosed chronic rhinosinusitis after dacryocystorhinostomy. 71 ? ??? ??? ???? 1 ? ? ??????? ? ??? ??, ???? ??? ??? ???????? ???. ?? ?? ?? ???? ?? ??? ?? ???? ?????. ????? ??? ??????? ???? ?? ???? ???, ?? ?? ?????? ????? ??? ?? ?????. ??? ????? ????? ????? ?????. ???? ??????? ? ????? ??? ??????? ???? ???? ?????? ????? ??...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} the diagnostic value of tumor blood flow (TBF) obtained with pseudocontinuous {{arterial spin labeling}} (pCASL) for the differentiation of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and malignant lymphoma (ML) in the nasal or <b>sinonasal</b> <b>cavity.</b> Methods: Thirty-three patients with SCC and 6 patients with ML in the nasal or <b>sinonasal</b> <b>cavity</b> were retrospectively analyzed. Quantitative TBF values were obtained using whole-tumor region of interest (ROI) from pCASL data. The histogram analysis of TBF values within the tumor ROI was also performed by calculating the coefficient of variation (CV), kurtosis, and skewness. The mean TBF value, histogram CV, kurtosis and skewness of the patients with SCC were {{compared with those of}} the ML patients. The diagnostic accuracy to differentiate SCC from ML was also calculated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. In addition, multiple logistic regression models were also performed to determine their independent predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy with the combined use of these parameters. Results: Between the SCC and ML groups, significant differences were observed in mean TBF, CV, and kurtosis, but not in skewness. In ROC curve analysis, the diagnostic accuracy values for the differentiation of SCC from ML in mean TBF, CV, and kurtosis were all 0. 87, respectively. Multiple logistic regression models revealed TBF and CV were respectively independent predictive value. With the combination of these parameters, the diagnostic accuracy was elevated to 0. 97. Conclusions: The TBF value and its histogram analysis obtained with pCASL can help differentiate SCC and ML...|$|E
40|$|Reconstruction of the {{anterior}} skull base and fronto-orbital framework following extensive tumor resection is both challenging and controversial. Dural defects {{are covered with}} multiple sheets of fascia lata that provide sufficient support and avoid herniation. Plating along the skull base is contraindicated. After resection of orbital walls, grafting is necessary if the periosteum or parts of the periorbital tissue had to be removed, to avoid enophthalmus or strabism. Free bone grafts exposed to the <b>sinonasal</b> or pharyngeal <b>cavity</b> are vulnerable to infection or necrosis: therefore, covering the grafts with vascularized tissue, such as the Bichat fat-pad or pedicled temporalis flaps, should reduce these complications. Alloplastic materials are indispensable in cranial defects, whereas microsurgical free tissue transfer is indicated in cases of orbital exenteration and skin defects. The authors review their experience and follow-up of 122 skull base reconstructions following extensive subcranial tumor resection. Most significant complications were pneumocranium in 4. 9 %, CSF leaks in 3. 2 %, and partial bone resorption in 8. 1 %...|$|R

Mucosal melanoma (MM) {{in the head and}} neck (H&N) is relatively rare and behaves in distinct pattern from cutaneous melanoma (CM). We performed this study to define clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients and emphasize MM differences from CM. Forty-one patients with MM located in H&N were assessed. 94 CM patients originated from H&N region were also used for comparison. Patients had oral cavity (51 %) and sinonasal location (49 %). The median age was 60 years and gender distribution was equal. Thirty-two (78 %) patients had localized stage, four (10 %) patients had regional lymph nodemetastasis, and five (12 %) patients had distant metastasis. The 1 - and 5 -year overall survival rates were 81 % and 58 %, respectively. Outcomes were similar between <b>sinonasal</b> and oral <b>cavity</b> patients...|$|R
40|$|Background The <b>sinonasal</b> <b>cavities</b> {{represent}} an anatomical region {{affected by a}} variety of tumours with clinical, aetiological, pathological, and genetic features distinct from tumours at the main head and neck cancer localisations. Majority being malignant tumours and squamous-cell carcinoma contribute 80 % of the sinonasal malignancies, maxilary sinus being the most affected sinus. The disease is associated with occupational exposure to a number of materials wood and leather dusts being among the culprits. Sinonasal tumours affect all races and males being the ones most affected compared to females. The peak age at diagnosis is sixth decade. Since the clinical symptoms are non specific, patients always present to the hospitals with advanced stage of the disease which make the prognosis to be poor despite improvement in the diagnosis and management of the disease. Objective This study aimed at determining the prevalence and presentation of sinonasal tumours among patients attending Otorhinolaryngology department of Muhimbili National Hospital,Dar es Salaam Tanzania. Study design Hospital-based, descriptive cross sectional study Methodology A total of 6630 patients attended Otorhinolaryngology department of Muhimbili National Hospital from June 2015 to February 2016 through convenient sampling were enrolled to participate in this study. Patients were interviewed by using structured questionnaire and clinical examination forms. Those with clinical presentations of sinonasal tumours underwent several investigations so as to confirm the presence and extent of the disease. They included biopsy for histopathology, CT Scan of the nose and paranasal sinuses and Chest X ray for those with malignancies. All information obtained was entered in the computer and analyzed using SPSS statistical analysis package. Frequency and percentage were calculated to determine the prevalence of sinonasal tumours in the study population. The Chi-square test was used to compare prevalence by age and sex and P value of < 0. 005 was considered statistically significant. Results Among 6630 study participants 3417 (51. 5 %) were females and 3213 (48. 5 %) were males. Their age ranged from 0 to 98 years with mean age of 27. 61 years, SD ± 22. 0. Most of them 2102 (31. 7 %), were in the age group of 0 – 9 years. The prevalence of sinonasal tumours among the study participants was 0. 6 %, and the age group of 50 years and above had higher prevalence 19 (1. 4 %) compared to other age groups. The prevalence obtained was higher among males, 23 (0. 7 %) compared to females, 15 (0. 4 %) with the ratio of 1. 5 : 1. Rhinological features were the most common clinical presentations (97. 4 %) while otological features were the least (26. 3 %). Among 38 patients with sinonasal tumours, 30 (78. 9 %) had malignant type and 13 (43. 3 %) were in the age group 50 years and above. Majority 6 (75 %) of those with benign type were in the same age group as for malignant type. Both benign and malignant sinonasal tumours had male preponderance. Inverted papilloma accounted for 62. 5 % (5 out of 8) of the benign sinonasal tumours while SCC constituted 42. 9 %(6 out of 30) of the malignant type. Most of patients with malignant sinonasal tumours 22 (73. 3 %) had stage IV disease while none was in stage I or II. Twenty percent had neck node metastasis to level I and II and one patient with metastasis to the chest. Most of them had all sinus groups being involved with tumours and 31. 6 % had outside sinuses involvement. Conclusion. Majority of sinonasal tumours in our setting were malignant type and squamous cell carcinoma being the most occuring histological type while inverted papilloma was the mostly frequent encountered benign type and both had male preponderance mostly seen at the age of 50 years and above. Rhinological features were the most clinical presentations of the disease. Majority of patients with malignant tumours were in stage IV of the disease and none in stage I or II and thus the need for advocacy for early health seeking behaviour to the community and early detection of the disease by health personnels in the primary health centers hence prompty referal to otorhinolaryngology specialists for definitive managemen...|$|R
