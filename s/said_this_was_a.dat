5|$|Lam Wing-kee (林榮基, age 60), {{the founder}} of Causeway Bay Books, has been missing since 24 October 2015. He habitually spent long hours at the {{bookshop}} and occasionally slept there. His wife filed a missing persons report with the police on 5 November and his family received {{a telephone call from}} him several hours later; he refused to reveal his whereabouts. When filing the police report, they were referred to the Immigration Department, who said it was against privacy policy to reveal a person's records of entry and exit of Hong Kong without the subject's permission. However, legislator James To <b>said</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> reasonable request that was exempt from privacy policy. Police followed up on his case once, asking whether they had heard from him. His family allege that upon learning that he had contacted his family, the officer who called them informed that the case would be closed as resolved.|$|E

Tom Searle said, [...] "some people might say we've regressed, but I think we've found our enthusiasm for playing heavy music again. I'm excited again by what I've come up with on guitar and lyrically it's much more political and less personal." [...] The band started to write socially aware lyrics during the writing phase of Daybreaker; vocalist Sam Carter <b>said</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> result of the band touring the world and seeing things he felt were downplayed by the media.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by John Swartzwelder and {{directed}} by Jim Reardon. New Zealand actor Sam Neill guest starred in the episode as Molloy, the cat burglar. Executive producer David Mirkin thought Neill, a big The Simpsons fan, was [...] "lovely" [...] to direct. Mirkin also said Neill was [...] "really game" [...] and did [...] "a terrific job" [...] on the episode. Neill considers recording this episode to be a [...] "high-point" [...] of his career. One scene of the episode features Kent Brockman reporting on the burglaries. Mirkin <b>said</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> joke the staff enjoyed doing because it pointed out how negative and mean-spirited news broadcasts can be, {{and how they are}} seemingly [...] "always trying to scare everybody" [...] by creating panic and depression.|$|E

500|$|With {{a decade-long}} career, MTV {{described}} Ali {{as one of}} the [...] "enduring empresses" [...] of electronic dance music and Queen of Clubs Trilogy as [...] "aptly titled". Noted for being the [...] "definitive" [...] and [...] "unmistakable" [...] voice of dance music, she is said to have [...] "enriched" [...] and [...] "invigorated" [...] the genre. Ali has gone on to become an oft-requested collaborator by DJs and producers. She was praised for acquiring notability in a male and DJ-dominated genre where vocalists serve as supporting acts. She <b>said</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> double-edged sword as she was also treated as competition by DJs.

[...] During her speech, in response to constant questions about her dumping the WWF Women's Championship belt in the trash on Monday Nitro, her inductor, Natalya, wheeled a trash can onstage. Miceli (calling herself both Madusa and Alundra Blayze) withdrew the belt, which she stressed was a good-looking [...] "women's wrestling belt", and said it was finally [...] "back home where it belongs" [...] after 20 years. She held the belt on her shoulder, and referred to herself as the reigning WWF Women's Champion.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Fowler {{was fined}} £60,000 by his club for {{bringing}} the game into disrepute. While celebrating his goal against Liverpool's Merseyside rivals, Everton, Fowler used the white line of the penalty area to simulate cocaine use. Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier stated {{that this was a}} Cameroonian grass-eating celebration, learnt from teammate Rigobert Song. Defending himself, Fowler later <b>said</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> response to Everton fans who had insulted him with false accusations of drug abuse. Fowler received a four-match suspension from the FA for this incident. At the same FA disciplinary hearing, Fowler received a further two match suspension due to a separate incident in which he had homophobically [...] taunted the Chelsea defender Graeme Le Saux by waving his backside at him as Le Saux's wife and children watched from the stands. Fowler later attempted to justify his actions by suggesting his taunts were simply an extension of gamesmanship. The FA imposed a £32,000 fine and a six-match ban for the two incidents. Fowler has since apologized to Le Saux for the incident.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{begins with}} the Simpson family {{watching}} a news broadcast in which the news anchor Kent Brockman calls the United States Army a [...] "kill-bot factory". Mirkin <b>said</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> joke the staff [...] "particularly loved to do" [...] because it pointed out how negative and mean-spirited news broadcasts can be, {{and how they are}} seemingly [...] "always trying to scare everybody" [...] by creating panic and depression. In one scene in the episode, Marge begins hallucinating after drinking from Springfield's water supply, which has been spiked with LSD by Springfield's rival town, Shelbyville. The Fox network's censors wanted the scene to be cut from the episode because they did not like the idea of Marge [...] "getting high" [...] on LSD. Mirkin, however, defended the scene and argued Marge was not [...] "doing it on purpose", so the censors ultimately allowed the scene to remain in the episode. In another scene, Homer becomes frustrated at God for not getting the tickets to the game, so yells at a waffle stuck to the ceiling that he believes is God. Marge points out to him, however, that it is just a waffle that Bart threw up there. This scene, inspired by some melted caramel stuck to the ceiling of the Simpsons writers' room, is one of Mirkin's and Richardson's [...] "all time favorite" [...] jokes.|$|E

[...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad thought that [...] "It's almost as if this was the season opener" [...] and that this episode was [...] "ambitious." [...] Michael N of Television Without Pity awarded the episode a grade of B. Robert Canning of IGN said that [...] "the overall story arc was less than what we had anticipated from this critical favorite making its post-writers-strike return, the episode was still pretty damn funny." [...] Canning also said that this was [...] "an episode that was divided between a less-than-average story and many hilarious moments."

2500|$|Before {{the album}} Combat Rock was {{released}} in 1982, Strummer wilfully went into hiding and band management represented that he had [...] "disappeared". Bernie Rhodes, the band's manager, pressured Joe to do so because tickets were selling slowly for the Scottish leg of an upcoming tour. [...] It was planned for Strummer to travel, in secret, to Texas and stay with his friend, musician Joe Ely. Uneasy with his decision, Strummer instead decided to genuinely disappear and [...] "dicked around" [...] in France. During this time, Strummer ran the Paris Marathon in April 1982. He claimed his training regime consisted of 10 pints of beer {{the night before the}} race. For this period of time, Joe's whereabouts were not only a mystery to the public, but the band's management as well. Joe later <b>said</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> huge mistake and you [...] "have to have some regrets". This was in spite of the popular success of the single [...] "Rock the Casbah".

500|$|In December 1987, as news {{began to}} {{circulate}} about the commissioned work, local Assyrians accused Parhad of misrepresenting Ashurbanipal. Criticisms included {{the depiction of}} the king holding both a book and a lion, which they argued he [...] "wouldn't do", and for dressing him in a skirt, which they claimed {{he would never have}} worn. The critics thought the statue made a better portrayal of the Sumerian king Gilgamesh. One critic said: It's very simple. The statue represents Gilgamesh.... No Assyrian has a right to imagine things about our king. It's exactly like making a copy of the Statue of Liberty and saying it is George Washington.... Assyrian kings didn't wear miniskirts. They wouldn't have <b>been</b> holding <b>a</b> lion or a book. It's an insult to the Assyrians. Narsai David responded: They are entitled to their opinion.... We have never <b>said</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> museum-quality reproduction.... We have always <b>said</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> characterization of Ashurbanipal as done by a 20th-century artist. If they choose to think of this as Gilgamesh, they are free to do so.|$|R

2500|$|The {{character}} Kent Brockman {{functions as}} The Simpsonss main character for news parodies. He {{was based on}} Los Angeles anchormen Hal Fishman and Jerry Dunphy, and modeled after anchorman Ted Koppel. Another influence on the character was The Mary Tyler Moore Shows Ted Baxter, played by Ted Knight. His role on The Simpsons is to host the news as the fictional television channel, Channel 6's anchorman. In addition to the news, he also hosts the programs Eye on Springfield and Smartline. In most of his appearances, he seems more interested in entertaining the viewers than informing them of real news. In [...] "Homer Loves Flanders" [...] Brockman calls the United States Army a [...] "kill-bot factory" [...] in a news broadcast.

Turner said that [...] "in Brockman's journalism, we see some of the modern news media's ugliest biases", of which he says are glibness, amplification, and sensationalism. MSN called Brockman one of the worst TV news anchors. Brockman is joined by Scott Christian and Arnie Pie on the Channel 6 news team. Originally, Scott Christian was the anchor and Brockman was the field reporter, but the show shifted focus to Brockman. Arnie Pie is a helicopter-based traffic reporter that sometimes help with field reports other than traffic.|$|E
