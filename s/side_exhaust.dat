2500|$|Engines and chassis {{components}} were mostly carried {{over from the}} C2, but the body and interior were new. The [...] engine replaced the old [...] as the base engine in 1969, but power remained at [...] 1969 was the only year for a C3 to optionally offer either a factory installed <b>side</b> <b>exhaust</b> or normal rear exit with chrome tips. The all-aluminum ZL1 engine was also new for 1969; the special big-block engine was listed at 430-hp (320kW), but was reported to produce [...] and propelled a ZL1 through the 1/4 mile in 10.89 seconds.|$|E
25|$|In 1965 a {{competition}} version with a stripped interior, no glove box, different instrument layout and revised suspension. The competition version {{also had a}} more powerful motor with only one carburetor, <b>side</b> <b>exhausts,</b> a roll bar and wider fenders to accommodate racing tires.|$|R
25|$|The battle {{continued}} {{back and}} forth and spread to Province Wellesley and the island of Penang and other secret societies joined the fray.

An official inquiry took place and both the Hai San and Ghee Hin societies were fined $5,000 each for violating the peace of Penang and their leaders, banished.|$|R
25|$|Equipped almost identically to CSX2522, {{this second}} example had {{aluminum}} valve covers, a tuned air cleaner, a Smiths heater, seat belts, {{front and rear}} brake cooling ducts, a hood scoop, brake cooling scoops, <b>side</b> <b>exhausts</b> and a painted roll bar (2522’s roll bar was chromed). Suspension options included Koni shock absorbers, front and rear anti-sway bars, unpolished six-inch magnesium pin-drive wheels, and Goodyear Blue Streak Sports Car Special tires.|$|R
2500|$|Although the 1996 {{model year}} is the {{beginning}} of the second generation, in the Viper community, the 96 RT/10 is sometimes referred to as generation 1.5 since it saw the carryover of many generation 1 parts during the model year while transitioning to generation 2 parts. [...] The roadster relocated the exposed <b>side</b> <b>exhaust</b> pipes to a single muffler at the rear exiting via two large central tail pipes during the middle of the model year. [...] Dodge said the reduced back pressure increased the horsepower to [...] for the 96 RT/10. [...] Torque would also increase by [...] to [...] [...] A removable hardtop was now available along with a sliding glass window. [...] Some steel suspension components were replaced by aluminum, resulting in a [...] weight reduction.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the low {{demand for}} luxury {{motorcycles}} during the Great Depression, Indian not only continued {{production of the}} Four, but continued to develop the motorcycle. One of the less popular versions of the Four was the [...] "upside down" [...] engine on the 1936-37 models. While earlier (and later) Fours had inlet-over-exhaust (IOE) cylinder heads with overhead inlet valves and <b>side</b> <b>exhaust</b> valves, the 1936-1937 Indian Four had a unique EOI cylinder head, with the positions reversed. In theory, this would improve fuel vaporization, and the new engine was more powerful. However, the new system made the cylinder head, and the rider's inseam, very hot. This, along with an exhaust valvetrain that required frequent adjustment, caused sales to drop. The addition of dual carburetors in 1937 did not revive interest. The design was returned to the original configuration in 1938.|$|E
2500|$|Mazda's RX-8 {{car with}} the Renesis engine met California State fuel economy requirements, {{including}} California's low emissions vehicle (LEV) standards. This was achieved {{by a number of}} innovations. The exhaust ports, which in earlier Mazda rotaries were located in the rotor housings, were moved to the sides of the combustion chamber. This solved the problem of the earlier ash buildup in the engine, and thermal distortion problems of side intake and exhaust ports. A scraper seal was added in the rotor sides, and some ceramic parts were used in the engine. This approach allowed Mazda to eliminate overlap between intake and exhaust port openings, while simultaneously increasing the exhaust port area. The side port trapped the unburned fuel in the chamber, decreased the oil consumption, and improved the combustion stability in the low-speed and light load range. The HC emissions from the <b>side</b> <b>exhaust</b> port Wankel engine are 35–50% less than those from the peripheral exhaust port Wankel engine, because of near zero intake and exhaust port opening overlap. Peripheral ported rotary engines have a better mean effective pressure, especially at high rpm and with a rectangular shaped intake port. [...] However, the RX-8 was not improved to meet Euro 5 emission regulations and was discontinued in 2012.|$|E

5|$|After the Battle of Mohács in 1526, which {{resulted}} in the end of the independent Kingdom of Hungary, Ferdinand I was elected King by the nobles of both Hungary and Croatia. This was followed by a series of conflicts with the Habsburgs and their allies, fighting against the Ottoman Empire. In the Little War in Hungary both <b>sides</b> <b>exhausted</b> themselves after sustaining heavy casualties. The Ottoman campaign in Hungary ceased until the offensive against Szigetvár.|$|R

2500|$|Four-wheel {{disc brakes}} were also {{introduced}} in 1965. The brakes had a four-piston design with two-piece calipers and cooling fins for the rotors. Pads were in frequent {{contact with the}} rotors, but the resulting drag was negligible and did not affect fuel economy. Further, the light touching kept the rotors clean and did not diminish pad life, which was, in fact, quite high: a projected [...] for the front brakes and about twice that distance for the rear binders. Total swept area for the new system was , a notable advance on the [...] of the previous all-drum system. Per pending federal regulation, {{there was also a}} dual master cylinder with separate fluid reservoirs (only on models with power brakes for 1965) for the front and rear lines. Road testers rightly applauded the all-disc brakes. Testers found that repeated stops from [...] produced no deterioration in braking efficiency, and even the most sudden stops were rock-stable. The drum brakes remained available, however, as a $64.50 credit option, but only 316 of the 23,562 Corvettes built that year came with drums. A <b>side</b> <b>exhaust</b> system appeared as an option as did a telescopic steering wheel. Also available were alloy spinner rims, at US$322 a set.|$|E
2500|$|Four-wheel {{disc brakes}} were {{introduced}} in 1965, as was a [...] "big block" [...] engine option: the [...] V8. <b>Side</b> <b>exhaust</b> pipes were also optionally available in 1965, and continued to be offered through 1967. The introduction of the [...] big block in 1965 spelled {{the beginning of the}} end for the Rochester fuel injection system. The [...] option cost [...] while the fuel injected [...] engine cost [...] Few people could justify spending [...] more for [...] less, even though FI could deliver over 20 mpg on the highway and would keep delivering fuel despite high G-loading in corners taken at racing speeds. [...] Another rare '63 and '64 option was the Z06 competition package, which offered stiffer suspension, bigger, multi-segment lined brakes with finned drums and more, only a couple hundred coupes and ONE convertible were factory-equipped this way in 1963. [...] With only 771 fuel-injected cars built in 1965, Chevrolet discontinued the option at the end of the '65 production, having introduced a less-expensive big block 396 engine rated at 425hp in the middle of the production year and selling over 2,000 in just a few months. For 1966, Chevrolet introduced an even larger [...] Big Block version. Other options available on the C2 included the Wonderbar auto-tuning AM radio, AM-FM radio (mid-1963), air conditioning (late-1963), a telescopic steering wheel (1965), and headrests (1966). The Sting Ray's independent rear suspension was successfully adapted for the new-for-1965 Chevrolet Corvair, which solved the quirky handling problems of that unique rear-engine compact.|$|E
2500|$|Mazda later {{abandoned}} the Wankel {{in most of}} their automotive designs, continuing to use the engine in their sports car range only, producing the RX-7 until August 2002. The company normally used two-rotor designs. A more advanced twin-turbo three-rotor engine was fitted in the 1991 Eunos Cosmo sports car. In 2003, Mazda introduced the Renesis engine fitted in the RX-8. The Renesis engine relocated the ports for exhaust from {{the periphery of the}} rotary housing to the sides, allowing for larger overall ports, better airflow, and further power gains. Some early Wankel engines had also <b>side</b> <b>exhaust</b> ports, the concept being abandoned because of carbon buildup in ports and the sides of the rotor. The Renesis engine solved the problem by using a keystone scraper side seal, and approached the thermal distortion difficulties by adding some parts made of ceramics. The Renesis is capable of [...] with improved fuel economy, reliability, and lower emissions than previous Mazda rotary engines, all from a nominal 1.3L displacement. However, this was not enough to meet more stringent emissions standards. Mazda ended production of their Wankel engine in 2012 after the engine failed to meet the improved Euro 5 emission standards, leaving no automotive company selling a Wankel-powered vehicle. [...] The company is continuing development of the next generation of Wankel engines, the SkyActiv-R with a new rear wheel drive sports car model announced in October 2015 although with no launch date given. Mazda states that the SkyActiv-R solves the three key issues with previous rotary engines: fuel economy, emissions and reliability. [...] Mazda announced the introduction of the series-hybrid Mazda2 EV car using a Wankel engine as a range extender, however no date of introduction has been announced.|$|E
25|$|A further Zeppelin moved {{towards the}} battle at around 1:00pm, having been {{contacted}} by L.43 for assistance but it loitered to the north-east {{and did not}} close in to attack. The engagement ended when both <b>sides</b> <b>exhausted</b> their ammunition around 2:30pm. The Zeppelin was forced to remain high {{to stay out of}} range of the flak, this meant that the bombs were dropped from too great of height to strike the Allied patrol. There was no damage or casualties. After the action, the Zeppelins departed the area and the British vessels completed their patrol before returning to Rosyth.|$|R
50|$|The battle left both <b>sides</b> <b>exhausted.</b> After losing as much if {{not more}} men than its enemy, Prussia was again {{severely}} weakened. However, without {{the prospect of a}} decisive victory against the Prussians, and with dwindling financial resources, Austria was also losing much of its offensive power. After the campaign of 1760, it had {{to reduce the size of}} its army, which left little hope of crushing Prussia without the help of Russia, which withdrew in 1762. For the Austrians, the battle was hence a severe psychological blow that decreased their hope of winning a decisive victory.|$|R
50|$|A facelifted VFR800 debuted at the 2013 EICMA show in Milan, Italy.
