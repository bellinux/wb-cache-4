In 2011 it was announced that the tower would be renovated and be renamed to Nobu, and to operate as the first Nobu Hotel with a restaurant. The concept was that the tower was to be a boutique hotel within the resort. Because the exterior was unchanged, the interior with only 181 rooms, small by Vegas standards, is more spacious with bigger rooms than the standard hotel. The motif is Asian luxury with high end amenities, including a sake bar and strict security which uses optical scanners. Each room has a sitting area, a spacious bedroom with black lacquered furniture and artworks. The bathroom contains a double-sized stall with a teak shower stall, black tiles and a large rain-style <b>showerhead.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the potential merits and opportunities of introducing national minimum performance standards (MPS) for water efficient appliances, in particular <b>showerheads.</b> At {{a national level}} the introduction of MPS for <b>showerheads</b> by 2005 is expected {{to result in a}} reduction in the demand for water by over 79 GL/annum by 2015. The reduction in energy consumption associated with reduced water heating needs by water efficient <b>showerheads</b> is 7. 7 million GJ/annum, while greenhouse gas emissions will be reduced by 1. 3 million tones CO 2 /annum, by 2015. This initiative will generate benefits to an array of stakeholders. These benefits include: increased allocation of water for environmental flows, reduced demand on groundwater sources, reduced wastewater flows and associated pollution, and financial benefits to water utilities, particularly if the utility is experiencing water supply or wastewater treatment constraints. Regulation will also protect the investment (estimated to be in the order of $ 16 million) that a number of water utilities are making in incentive and retrofit programs. The most effective form of regulation to achieve the greatest outcomes in terms of reducing water and energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions is regulation that controls the supply of <b>showerheads</b> on the basis of flow rate. The MPS being proposed is 9 L/minute, and regulation would involve mandatory labelling of <b>showerheads</b> and compliance with the AAA-rating. The legislative options and challenge of introducing such a requirement within the current regulatory environment are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted {{with the goal of}} clarifying the required conditions of water-saving <b>showerheads.</b> In order to this, the research analyzes the mutual relationship between water usage flow, the level of satisfaction and the physical properties of spray of <b>showerheads.</b> The physical properties of spray were measured using physical properties test apparatus of standard or scheme for water-saving <b>showerheads</b> issued in several water-saving countries, and satisfaction evaluation data was acquired through bathing experiments. The evaluated <b>showerheads</b> were separated into three groups according to usage water flow and the level of satisfaction. The relationships between usage water flow, the level of satisfaction and physical properties were compared. The results identified that Spray Force and Spray Force-per-Hole were physical properties that influence usage water flow. Spray force-per-hole, water volume ratio in Spray Patterns within φ 100 and φ 150, Temperature Drop and Spray Angle were identified as physical properties that influenced the level of satisfaction. The level of satisfaction and usage water flow has a spurious correlation through the physical properties of Spray Force-per-Hole and Temperature Drop. It is possible to improve the level of satisfaction independent of amount of water usage through designs that set an appropriate value for water volume ratio and Spray Angle for Spray Patterns within φ 100 and φ 150...|$|R
40|$|Students: Jayson Tasaka, Krishna Lamichhane, Yanling Li, Kristen Au On cover: Technical Memorandum # 2 A water fixture {{survey was}} {{conducted}} on the University of Hawaii Manoa (UHM) campus in which the number of toilets, urinals, faucets, and <b>showerheads</b> in each building were counted. The total number of fixtures and the number of retrofittable fixture units were documented in the prioritization report of surveyed water fixtures prepared by Honeywell DMC Services, LLC in 2004. According to the prioritization report, only 4, 830 water fixtures out of the 7, 632 surveyed can technically and economically be retrofitted. The 4, 830 retrofittable fixtures include 2, 149 toilets, 265 urinals, 1, 614 faucets, and 802 <b>showerheads.</b> Toilets and <b>showerheads</b> appear to constitute the greatest retrofit opportunity. Many of the urinals on the UHM campus were previously retrofitted with low-flow flush systems.

40|$|Potential {{pathogens}} from shower {{water and}} aerosolized shower mist (i. e., shower aerosol) {{have been suggested}} as an environmental source of infection for immunocompromised patients. To quantify the microbial load in shower water and aerosol samples, we used culture, microscopic, and quantitative PCR methods to investigate four shower stalls in a stem cell transplant unit at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, MO. We also tested membrane-integrated <b>showerheads</b> as a possible mitigation strategy. In addition to quantification, a 16 S rRNA gene sequencing survey was used to characterize the abundant bacterial populations within shower water and aerosols. The average total bacterial counts were 2. 2 × 107 cells/liter in shower water and 3. 4 × 104 cells/m 3 in shower aerosol, and these counts were reduced to 6. 3 × 104 cells/liter (99. 6 % efficiency) and 8. 9 × 103 cells/m 3 (82. 4 % efficiency), respectively, after membrane-integrated <b>showerheads</b> were installed. Potentially pathogenic organisms were found in both water and aerosol samples from the conventional showers. Most notable was the presence of Mycobacterium mucogenicum (99. 5 % identity) {{in the water and}} Pseudomonas aeruginosa (99. 3 % identity) in the aerosol samples. Membrane-integrated <b>showerheads</b> may protect immunocompromised patients from waterborne infections in a stem cell transplant unit because of efficient capture of vast numbers of potentially pathogenic bacteria from hospital water. However, an in-depth epidemiological study is necessary to investigate whether membrane-integrated <b>showerheads</b> reduce hospital-acquired infections. The microbial load in shower aerosols with conventional <b>showerheads</b> was elevated compared to the load in HEPA-filtered background air in the stem cell unit, but it was considerably lower than typical indoor air. Thus, in shower environments without HEPA filtration, the increase in microbial load due to shower water aerosolization would not have been distinguishable from anticipated variations in background levels...|$|R

50|$|On average, showers were 18% of U.S. indoor {{water use}} in 1999, at 6 - 8 gal per minute {{traditionally}} in America. A simple method to reduce this use is {{to switch to}} low-flow, high-performance showerheads. These showerheads use only 1.0-1.5 gpm or less. An alternative to replacing the <b>showerhead</b> is to install a converter. This device arrests a running shower upon reaching the desired temperature. Solar water heaters {{can be used to}} obtain optimal water temperature, and are more sustainable because they reduce dependence on fossil fuels. To lessen excess water use, water pipes can be insulated with pre-slit foam pipe insulation. This insulation decreases hot water generation time. A simple, straightforward method to conserve water when showering is to take shorter showers. One method to accomplish this is to turn off the water when it is not necessary (such as while lathering) and resuming the shower when water is necessary. This can be facilitated when the plumbing or <b>showerhead</b> allow turning off the water without disrupting the desired temperature setting (common in the UK but not the United States).|$|E

5000|$|In {{an average}} home, {{showering}} {{is the second}} largest water use after toilets. The average shower uses 15.8 gallons (59.7 liters) and lasts for 7.7 minutes at average flow rate of 2.1 gallons per minute (gpm) (7.9 liters per minute). On average, in a household of average size (2.65 persons) 12.4 showers are taken each week. For comparison, a navy shower lasts only 2 minutes and can use less than 3 gallons (11.4 liters) of water. The most water-frugal approach {{is used by the}} crew of the International Space Station (ISS) who use less than 1 gallon (4 liters) to bathe. For showerheads, the standard for maximum flow rate continues to be 2.5 gallons per minute (gpm) (9.4 liters per minute (lpm)) as set by the Energy Policy Act of 1992. However, manufacturers now offer ultra-efficiency showerheads with maximum flow rate below 2.0 gpm (7.6 lpm). Examples include a <b>showerhead</b> with flow rate of 1.75 gpm (6.61 lpm) at high water pressure and 1.45 gpm (5.48 lpm) at low pressure, or a <b>showerhead</b> with three pressure compensated flow rates (by non-removable pressure compensator) with options of 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 gpm (1.9, 3.8, 5.7 lpm). A widespread use of more efficient showerheads (with flow rates of 1.6 gpm) would reduce average water use for showering by 2 gphd (7.6 lphd)(or by 8 percent).|$|E
